jesus christ and the truth says amen and amen and amen uh certainly happy to be here tonight on another tuesday night for our our bible study and um it's not a preaching service it is a study around scripture where we go to the sacred scriptures and we encourage one another around the word of god and you know we fulfill that part of that responsibility that we should all be undertaking to meditate on the word day and night and i trust that in your own uh secret closet as it were your own personal time that you take heed to the word of god and you get encouragement from how god has operated uh through time and and how he has unfolded himself in in in so many ways are so certainly happy to see everybody here out tonight and certainly want to welcome i see brother kelly salt is here certainly want to welcome you on by the nick edmonds and i i don't know mr lois is here as well we certainly welcome you uh to our bible study tonight happy to have you here with us all from uh in the us so we we thank you for joining us tonight and our our church uh for being faithful to the cause and the call of the gospel um we don't take it for granted there are a lot of things that we could be doing but we respond to the call towards getting closer to god it is what sustains us it is what drives us and to know that we read the bible not as you know someone reading it from an intellectual perspective but we thank god for the prophetic ministry and message of william branham that messenger of malachi 4 5 and 6 in luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 that we could read from this book as an open book and we can go through and see you know how about ibrahim brought certain things out and see how we can now take this in our daily lives because the reality is is god is interested in every aspect of our lives he's interested in our spiritual walk he's interested in our you know our natural work he's interested in the very simple things um in life you know and and and once you catch that balance and that focus and you realize that he is in in every aspect of our lives it it makes us so conscious and it also humbles us and makes us so grateful that we are we become totally dependent upon him you know so tonight i uh want to spend some time in the book of second kings and uh i had of i have if i call it a mean text but um i i went this evening to to kind of do a little background to it and i was saying that when you read this it's like it is really bible days or special days god knows god knows what day to put us in you know but when you read through particularly the old testament and so how those days were you know sometimes you say you have trials and you have testing that when you read what what uh took place in those times you know it makes you really see god knows who to put where and how and what their purpose is and and how this whole big plan of redemption would come together and how god would see it fit that little you little me could be the final you know leg of this really race you know to win the final battle so we're gonna be in second kings tonight and um i encourage you to to when when you do have time you know to spend time reading second kings from the beginning we wouldn't have time tonight to get all of it our our main reading will be in in second kings uh six into seven um but i did want to kind of just talk a little bit about what led up to that context so you would understand you know as we get a little deeper into this particular aspect of scripture you know kind of what was playing out um at that time and um i will give my title now sometimes i i choose not to give it too early so to not telegraph exactly where i'll be um but uh just to put it on note um my my text tonight is why sit here until we die um and i think it is a it's something that is appropriate um not just spiritual but it's also a natural encouragement um to believers um in such a time as this so um just kind of as just of a quick overview the book of of second kings you know really starts up with a lot happening um we have this transition that's taking place in the realm of the kings of leadership uh there's our there's transitions of power taking place we also see in the beginning of of second kings we see elijah and the mantle being passed on to elisha and in and around that time we have king ahab who is leaving the scene and his son who would be his son with jezebel jehoram becoming the king of israel who at that time would be in in samaria at this time as well the kingdom of judah would have already been separated from israel so you would have multiple kings over what was once the entire domain of king david had already begun to separate so judah is being led by jehoshaphat and you have israel for the most part in samaria being led by jehoram and when you look at it and how second kings three introduces the description they say now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign i'm reading second kings three verse one just quickly touching through a few scriptures to bring us to our point so let's you see you know just how how we get to where we're at now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the 18th year of jehoshaphat king of judah and urane for 12 years and it's written and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord so you have a king over israel and it is defined that you wrote evil in the sight of the lord but not like his father you know so this is like a really a structured description so he was bad but not as bad as his father and like his mother for he put away the image of baal or baal that his father had made so at least he took down the idols but all of his actions in trying to correct what had been going on that was wrong was still not seen as enough because nevertheless in verse 3 he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of nibert which made israel a sin he departed not there from so we have a king and this is not a king of of of of uh uh people who are not connected from god this is the children of israel being led by a king who is clearly out of order he is he is not spirit he is not in the spirit but this is all unfolding and in along this time elisha is coming into his own he has just gotten the mantle so all of this is happening and it's happening in parallel it's it's happening and you have now as you begin to move from from second kings three and second kings four you see elisha minisester the woman who said all she had was one bit of oil and elijah tells her you know go and borrow as many vessels as possible and close the door and pour the oil and and she obeys she is humble and as she pours into all of the envious vessels everyone gets filled up and he tells her go pay all your debts and live happy so we see elijah as it were beginning to be recognized beginning to be observed beginning to be noticed we have the tsunamite woman who would be a fantastic cook according to scripture and she would tell her husband this is in second kings four you know this man of god who is in the area let's invite him to eaton and elisha would have this way he would drop by for a good meal and there was something about this woman that she said she told her husband let's put a little side room for the house so that whenever he comes by to eat he could kind of rest and stuff like that and and elijah is so blown away by this he asked her what you want and she said you know well grab a child and and and like you say well you're going to have a child you say why would you why would you tell me something that can happen almost similar in parallel to what what sierra would have almost gone through and the story went unfold and you know it one day the boy ended up seeing his head hurting him and then he dies and she says put him on the same bed where elisha does sleep and she gets a horse and rides the elisha all of this is there so this is building up into a momentum of of understanding the the context and of course we know the story elisha gives his staff to his servant he said if somebody wave at you don't wave back if somebody call you don't call back go straight to that boy and put my staff on him and and the servant came back and said he's still dead elisha goes he put his his mouth out he put his whole body on him and the boy comes to life so this is building elisha's recognition his his reputation and by the time he reached second kings five which is one chapter before where we will spend some time this evening we have neyman and we dealt with neyman a few months or so ago that neyman as a syrian you know with his leprosy condition was able to catch the eye of a little of a little servant girl and he would interact with elijah and we spent a lot of time going uh through that you know so this is now building so by this time now elisha is a known entity everyone knows that elisha is a man of god he's a he's a prophet of god everybody is clear on that and then we reach to second kings six where later in second king six um we will really find where we want to start tonight but even within second king six you know we have this very famous scripture that we refer to when in and this is second king six and verse eight and when the king of syria ward against israel so there was already a bit of a contention by this time between israel and syria so israel and syria is at war and so i'm reading now from second kings eight second king six verse eight and then the king of syria ward against israel and took counsel with his servant saying in such and such a place shall be my camp and the man of god sent unto the king of israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for viva the syrians are come down so basically in this whole story here every time the king of syria is planning his attack against children of israel elisha is getting clear instructions from god clear vision from god of exactly what is being planned by the king of syria in so much that by verse 11 the bible says therefore the heart of the king of syria was so troubled for this thing and he called his servant and said unto them will ye not show me which of us is for the king of israel and one of his servants said not my lord o king but elisha the prophet that is in israel tell it the king of israel the words that those speakers in thy bed chamber and that is a powerful thing to see no matter the attack that the syrians were trying to do against israel god was stopping it every single time and this is what led to him saying let's go find him and we find elisha and we have preachers many times there you know he is he's about his business and his servants a master master they're all around us and he likes to say open this boy eyes they're more for us stand against us and we know that story we're getting closer to where we want to be at so i want us to understand that all of this is what is leading up to this particular situation now bear in mind friends that god is a god who is a god of his word now many times and as christians we have to be very careful of this as believers we have to be very very careful of this once you step out of the will of god or you disobey god there are consequences to that and even if you repent of it repentance doesn't necessarily change consequences of breaking god's law god will accept your your your your repentance he will accept you coming back but he is still in his right to take action to disobedience because his word says if you disobey me certain things will happen to you i want us to to catch that right so in as much as and i want to make the point here elisha is a prophet and he's operating and working with the children of israel the fact is the children of israel they are still under judgment because they are fundamentally and truthfully out of order and you you need to be very very clear that even if there are signs of god working with you doesn't change the fact that you have to get your life in order i want to say that one more time many times we operate and say well i was blessed with this i was blessed with that god did this for me and this happened for me and and and we made the assumption that because things are working out or things seem positive that the things that we do that we should not do that god is somehow ignoring it i want to i want to make sure we get that point clear because god is sovereign he can do what he wants to do so he can open a door for you and allow you to run a certain way for some time and still decide now is not the time to deal with the other issues you have going on and and and that's a that's a serious serious thing and it reminds me um and i know my grandfather gonna use a natural example was more of this than my own father but my dad i'll share something with you he had this ability when i was younger to distance himself from the discipline and it is the most unnerving disturbing thing you can go through it is as if to say i'm gonna you see what you just did i will deal with that you know but not today and listen when you hear that that can mess up your whole weakener because you're no judgment coming you don't know when it will strike but you know it's going to strike so it's as if you said you see you know don't take any cake from the fridge that cake is for saturday but you know certain people like cake so you end up taking the cake earlier than saturday and he says i will deal with that and i wouldn't deal with it today so you have a situation where you know jobbing is coming you're living your life normal tuesday friday it could be monday and and the reality is it is up to him to decide how he will deal with the discipline because he make a statement i don't want to touch i just give you an example of this so all that being said when the syrian army came around elisha and elisha said open this boy jahazi's eyes and they are more for us than against us many times we don't really go into what happened after that the bible says and when they came down to him this is second kings six and verse 18 and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and said smite this people i pray thee with blindness so this syrian army that came for elisha not only was it a situation of more force than against us but he actually smote them with blindness and elijah said unto them this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom you seek but he led them to samaria so i want you to remember they came looking for elijah you know and elisha smote them with blindness and say this is you're in the wrong place and know who you're looking for i know where he is let me carry you to meet him and elijah led them to samaria which is the city or the area or the territory that israel is at under the kingship of king jehoram and it came to pass verse 20 when they came into samaria that elisha said lord open the eyes of these men that they may see i'm reading verse 20 and the lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of samaria and the king of israel jehoram said unto elisha when he saw them my father shall i smite them shall i smite them no this is this is a serious situation here because they were at war and he said and he answered now this is elisha because this is the context we need to get that leads into what happens next so i want you to understand there's war going on every time the children of israel coming under attack by the syrians they have the hedge of elisha's protection the syrians are upset they come to get elisha elisha says i'm not demanding any place let me carry it in the place takes them to samaria head to head so the two armies effectively facing off at this point in time and the king of israel jehoram has the opportunity to take out the syrian army and elisha says and he answered verse 22 thou shalt not smite them what has doused my those whom thou has taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow select bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master so elisha steered the hand at that time of the king of israel against the syrian army and ibrahimovic said and he prepared great provision for them and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away and they went to the master so the bands of syria came no more into the land of israel so it would appear at that point as if okay there's peace and there was no reason for any contention as it were between jehoram the king of israel and elijah and this right here is the full background into our text tonight so thank you for being a great audience for the background now let's get into into where we're going now so we clear on the background verse 24 and it came to pass this is our teaching that now we we we now starting to get down into what we want to get into tonight so we are in second king six and verse 24 and it came to pass after this so after some time had passed that ben had that king of syria and i'm going to put in some elements as we read it clearly forgetting the grace that was extended to him by the king of israel when his army was eaten in front of them and he they had the opportunity to kill them all right the king of syria gathered all his hosts and went up and besieged samaria so the men who had eaten been fed relax went back home to their master who was a king of syria and now rallied and they besieged sumaria the word besiege means to surround and when you surround a city effectively you cut off supply you cut off transportation you cut off access those who are inside can't come out if you're outside your car come in you are besieged if you have products you cannot export it if you need product you cannot import it if the doctor who you need to operate on you happens to be outside you have to do without that doctor if you are a doctor and your patient happened to be outside you can't go out because you are besieged so in other words you're in lockdown does this sound familiar at all i i i don't know and it came to pass that ben haddad king of syria gathered all his hosts and went up and besieged samaria when you besiege a city again whatever you have is what you have to live with the longer the siege continues what begins to happen is you begin to lose resources because you have a limited supply if you happen to be an environment you could grow things you could grow for as long as you could but if you're running a seed or it's a dry period or whatever it is you're limited so we are clear on that and there was a great famine in samaria who was 25. and behold they besieged it until and as his head was sold for four score pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cab of doves dung for five pieces of silver dove's dung is dull is dove's extra excrement so in other words this pricing in history is basically saying it was so bad that you had to be extremely wealthy to buy the excrement of a dog of a dove that's how bad it was prices would have skyrocketed because of the economic scarcity that existed is either you really really had and if you had yours you had little purchasing power so this was a economic crisis brought about by the war between two nations israel and the enemies of israel verse 26 and sometimes you know you think things are bad let's go on in verse 26 and as the king of israel backslidden brother jehoram son of ahab and jezebel was passing by upon the wall they cried a woman unto him saying help my lord o king you know whenever people are in trouble you look towards some level of leadership you look to somebody who is in a position who can do something about the situation that is human nature so you would think that in seeing the king person the belief would be that the king could maybe step in and do something about whatever this woman's issue was i'm not going to be too long with you just taking us through this and seeing what we could catch from it and this is the king's response and he said if the lord do not have thee when shall i help thee out of the barn floor or out of the wine press in other words if the lord not intervening in your situation where you want me to get help from the band floor because the bands are empty your wine press we have nothing in there in other words i can't help you don't look to me because if the lord who is bigger than me can i help you you can't look to me for help so it's a helpless situation it's a hopeless situation i don't think anybody in this room has ever been in a situation as helpless and as hopeless as this particular situation and the king said unto her now listen to the problem what a let me so in other words still tell me still tell me what the problem is and i'm trusting most of you would have studied this before already before but if you never encountered the details here then it's a it's a really really interesting you know it's really really something else and the king said under what led and she answered so if you're reading this slowly and you don't continue so i don't want to rush ahead i want to take it slowly if you're starving and you see the king passing and you can't say how can i help you logically speaking you will say well i want some food i have no money what assistance can you give me can you help me out this woman and she answered this woman said unto me give thy son that we may eat him today and we will eat my son tomorrow so this is the help she was looking for so we boiled my son and did eat him and i said unto her on the next day give thy son that we may eat him and she had hid her son so when i read this and i slowed down and i started to think because meditate on your word means sitting on think about it because your kite has readers this is this is not this is not a novel things had gotten so bad that there was no vegetation to eat there was no animals to eat until they had reached the point that they were eating their own children the help she was asking from the king wasn't helped for grief she wasn't saying i am in grief because i ate my son things were so bad that she was beyond the issue of her son being dead she wasn't asking for help from the king for her dead son she wasn't asking for help because of the situation and i want you to see how when you're out of the will of god how bad things can get because the only reason this was happening was because they were out of the will of god and this what we're reading here in second kings was actually foretold in scripture so if you go back to deuteronomy 28 indulge me for one second in deuteronomy 28 which is the book in the old testament that deals with the blessings and the curses deuteronomy 28 and verse 52. is a a strong just bible teaching tonight deuteronomy 28 and verse 52 and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates until thy high and fence walls come down wherein thou trusted throughout all thy land and he shall besiege thee and all thy gates throughout all thy land which the lord thy god had given thee and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters which the lord thy god had given thee in the siege and in the straightness where it an enemy shall distress thee and all of these curses here in deuteronomy was as a result of one thing and one thing only disobedience to god's word so for anybody who was in israel who would have known what was in the torah because the five sacred books of moses would have included all of these things so it was it should have been no surprise to the spiritual of that day that this was not a natural issue it was not a natural situation this was in direct response to blatant disobedience of god's word so from that perspective i want us to understand that it was not hunger that this woman was asking for help was looking for she wasn't even saying king i need help or king why don't we repent i want us to stop for a minute because at this point in time there's no attempt to you know what this is judgment why don't we try to fix it there was no discussion about this has befallen us because we have left god's word the commentary was not a discussion about we have left something undone that should be done and as a result there are consequences because god is a god of his word and he is no respecter of persons this is scripture being fulfilled the situation was so bad that she was still trying to get the king to enforce but this woman promised that after we eat my son we will eat her son and now she having second thoughts so in other words king i want you to make her bring her son out of hiding wherever she finds wherever she had him bring him out so we can boil him and eat him too friends this this is not a fairy tale you know you have to really slow down there are people who say i don't eat this i don't eat that this is not that you know how bad does it get that you could even conceptualize eating your child so i wanted to understand that it is beyond sin in this case it is beyond that and bad it meant that it got so bad at logic and reason and family life and purpose and destiny and legacy because this is a sun being eaten a sun is is is delineates being continued so eating your children is tantamount to cutting off your descendants so in other words they have gotten so far from god this is bible so far from god that they were willing to eat their children and it came to pass verse 30 when the king heard the words of the woman that he rent his clothes in other words he felt the grief he felt the grief that she didn't feel the reality of the situation because understand this in this time the king would have been in a in a different room so to speak than iman on the street especially in those days if there was anything to eat something would go to the king so maybe he's walking there trying to get a feel of what's happening in the kingdom and the reality of it strikes this thing is worse than i thought and maybe he is reflecting on himself maybe he is reflecting on his leadership maybe he is reflecting on his decision making and he rents his clothes which in that day is a is a great sign of oh this is this is too much renting closes is a combination of grief and anger mixed into one and he passed by upon the wall and the people looked and beheld he had sackcloth within upon his flesh so the king is going through his own turmoil because at the end of the day it is not as if the man on the street really has a position in this context to change it it had to be leadership make a decision we need to repent we need to fix this we need to get this in order in order for us to fix what has gone wrong then he said god do so and more also to me listen so let me finish and i'll talk about it if the head of elisha the son of shafa shall stand on him this day so i wanted to see the switch now because this is powerful this here is a lot in here and we still building up to our teacher we have reached the core of it here this is still background so the king sees this and he does what most people do when they can't seem to understand the role that they have to play in fixing the issues of their life the king's response is i have to blame somebody the king is the only one who is in position to do something about it and his response to the situation is god do so and more also to me in other words god better do the same thing to me you know if i don't see elisha head on this day god bless my head so he say listen elisha have to die in other words not only did he not take responsibility for the condition that they were in he said the man of god have to pay a price for this maybe he was saying to himself you know if i had killed them earlier on when they came in front of me and elijah didn't steal my hand they would not have had the strength to be seen just now understand this he's not seeing the sin the sin and the failures the spiritual issue that was a real problem was not his issue he is focused on what he believed he could have controlled while living the way he was living all along i want us to kind of hold on to that thought a little bit there in other words he is saying i want to live my life breaking the spiritual rules but you know what i had the opportunity to take all these syrians and when i had the opportunity i didn't take it it was elijah's fault that held my hand if i had done what i wanted to do the city would never be besieged but god is not trying to get is not victory over the syrians is the objective here it's repentance it is the change of behavior i want us to catch that now friends many times when we are looking outward to blame anybody for our situation most times we should be looking inward i'm not trying to bring it to us for us to get into a pity party or for us to get into depression or or feeling frustrated i want us to understand that no matter what we have a choice and the best choice the king had was to do what he should have known which was to repent get the people in in order do these spiritual things but that was not his focus he didn't see it as a spiritual problem so he was trying to solve it with a natural solution so i want us to catch now we we just finished in verse 31 verse 32 but elisha sat in his house and the elders sat with him and the king sent a man from before him in other words the king himself wants to come and deal with elisha but the king bigner so yeah just showing up he's sending somebody in front a forerunner but uh the messenger came to him he said to the elders see he how this son of a murderer but uh but elijah sat in his house and the ella sat with him and the king sent a man be from before him but uh the messenger came to him he said so in other words before the messenger that the king was sending in advance could even reach elisha this is elijah see how this son of a murderer had sent to take away my head now this is a paradox that i don't understand with the enemy this is the same elisha that was advising the same jehoram when the syrian army do this do this when a syrian army go in here move here you jehoram don't understand that he can't just roll up on elijah so the same way elisha could have seen where the syrian army was is the same elijah in his home fellowship with the brothers and you see you see all this murderer trying to come from ahead before he before jehoram and his make it even reach elijah and see the whole thing happen and he said look when the messenger cometh shut the door and hold him fast at the door it's not the sound of his master's feet behind him and while he yet talked with them behold the messenger came down unto him so in other words elijah explaining what's about to happen and as he finished explaining here playing out in real time is what he was explaining to the brothers man you see what would happen whenever prophet any land the man of god fellowshipping and as he's saying you know this is about to happen and as he's saying it it's as if you rewind the tape and see the tape play out what what a vindicat this would have a vindicated prophet in your image anybody with me tonight and while he yet talked with them behold the messenger came down unto him and he said behold this evil is of the lord what what should i wait for the lord any longer and elisha said hear ye the word of the lord this is seven verse one so elijah as a prophet is now prophesying and we know whenever a prophet speaks it must come to pass then elisha said hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord hallelujah tomorrow about this time now you know how the brothers around elijah must feel this is the peak in other words the the the timeline of this thing is almost immediate the king gets so upset this is the same day we can we actually reading all year in the same day because the king said this day mustn't end until i see he lies ahead so in the very same day this whole thing playing all right here the the the king is heading down to elisha with his men he's setting things up and elijah is saying hear the word of the lord thus see the lord tomorrow about this same time shall a measure of fine flower be sold for a shekel and two measures of valley for a shekel in the gate of samaria in other words by this time tomorrow the market will crash in other words by this time tomorrow there'll be so much food that the man who have no money will have plenty by this time tomorrow the man who just have a shekel alone will get two measures of valley earlier on that same day it say you couldn't even buy the excrement of a dove unless you're a millionaire but by this time tomorrow the market conditions will change the environment will change your situation will change hallelujah and listen now no this in this context i want us to understand this in this context this prophecy would qualify as a virtual impossibility because it is and this is where you have to be careful now it is it is so unreasonable because you're on a day when your people dying nobody has strength to fight the city is surrounded armies are around you you have no food you have no army what could possibly change overnight i want this again you said this is not the situation being changed in a week in two weeks in a month over the next three months don't worry this is by this same time you're coming from my head by this same time tomorrow all your problems gone whatever trouble you're going through could you have faith to believe that god can move so quickly in your situation by this time tomorrow hallelujah the athletic pain you have in your body could be gone that you could have faith to believe that by this time tomorrow hallelujah that high blood pressure could be normal do you have fear to believe by this time tomorrow there could be reconciliation between your family do you have faith to believe and this is the prophetic ministry of elisha who came after elijah now listen then a lord on whose hand the king leaned in other words lord on whose handy king lean is like a right-hand man is the way he would write a right-hand manner advisor senior man to the king one of j jerome topman listen now answered the man of god and said behold if the lord would make windows in heaven my distinct be in other words what you saying can happen oh my and this is a challenge for us in this room tonight this man who this i want us to understand these people we're talking about is not unbelievers and this is not people out outside the household of the of the tribes of israel these are people who born into this thing but living outside of the privileges of god because they have broken the covenants of god they're broken the laws of god in other words they should know better and the reality is no matter how backslidden you find yourself in you should know better because once you have come in contact with your jain and who you are and where you come from and where your heritage is your temporary mishap and your fall and failure doesn't change the fact that you know better and you know god is the god of the impossible the challenge and the prophecy was too great for this right-hand man of jehoram to process and i want to challenge the church tonight that your faith has to climb higher to believe that just like that god could change your situation if it's anything this is to teach us is god is serious about the impossibility of his word being made possible let me say that one more time if it's anything this teaches us it is when god says something and brother branham speaks about it he says when god does something like this you just have to say amen he said respond quickly don't even try to figure it out don't try to figure out how the situation in your life will change the situation in your business will change what god will move around for your benefit how it will happen is not your concern if he said it's going to happen it's going to happen you'd have to figure out how he has to want to respond and say yes sir but look how much god was upset with this negative response and i want to challenge the church tonight you cannot be negative let me say that one more time you cannot be negative not you not us not after we serve a god of miracles not after god sent our elijah to give us promises that he's interested in every aspect of our lives we cannot be negative you can't speak negative you can't respond negative this might sound too exciting for you you say well oh god just choose the night here but isaac just this is a bit much to me i want you to see that your city which you could change overnight it is one thing i want you to catch is that your situation can change overnight your marriage could change overnight your business could change overnight your life could change overnight your joy could change overnight your peace could change overnight and god wants to do it for you in this season when this world is besieged oh come on now when this world is surrounded by the virus by economic siege by political siege by siege of bad doctrine and teaching and this and that god could do something overnight why because that's how he is he's a god of promises he's a god of his word he said the message would seem broken down but yet in the midst of that time he will raise up a people he'll raise up a bride for such a time as this just like esther for such a time as this oh anybody with me tonight hallelujah people say nothing moving nothing moving oh come on now in the midst of that there's something moving there's a rustle in the mulberry b there's still there's a stillness that's being broken tonight in the atmosphere don't take this for granted tonight don't take it light tonight i don't care what's going on out there i don't care what's happening out there we are dealing with the promise of god the individual who received the promise because this man this man we're going to talk about him he heard the promise but he didn't receive it i'm not speaking to those who hear it and don't receive it this was not about hearing it or listening to it this was about believing it and taking action about it and this man said good god could god open a window and do this or tonight i say yes he could open a window he could open a door he could change things around he can make a road at the back of your house i have to pay you to to to do a bigger house i don't care what has to happen have faith in god this is a message of faith tonight in the darkest of hours in the darkest of moments when things are so depressing and things are so down and people are so gloomy somebody told me yesterday it's a mental strain the world is under it's it's every day is a bad news it's this it's that it's how it's uncertainty and in the midst of that these people in the midst of uncertainty and one day a mother is saying oh gosh i eat my child my only child i thought i would get food but and they don't even know they don't even know that in in in in a few hours by the next day they have too much food they can't even have room for food anybody with me tonight be careful then a lord on whose hand the king lean answered the man of god their answer was you have the audacity to answer the man of god and said behold if the lord would make windows in the heaven my destiny be and he said listen to elisha's response to the negativity so and i'm making it a call of action to the church please don't bring your negativity listen to how elisha responded and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof in other words you will see it because the prophecy is coming to you and you must know that when a prophet speaks the prophecy must come to pass so you're going to see the prophecy fulfilled in 24 hours you're gonna see me change don't doubt it believe it but you will not be able to eat thereof now everybody feeling fine how is this so far is this is this any kind of encouragement to you overnight i want to see the testimonies you know of of of who have enough faith to believe that overnight your day your mind going you're trying to figure things out and you trying to solve it not even knowing that god already planned the overnight hallelujah you don't even know that your efforts as best as it could be could never compare to you overnight hallelujah what god has in store for you as a child as a mother as a father as a businessman as an employee whatever your station in life wherever you are in life god has a plan for your life glory to god but but isaac this is not a mystery tonight this is nothing no this is real tonight because people are in their struggles and you have to realize that you might be on top of your mountain but there's somebody in their valley and i say if tonight is for one person may that one person lift their head up and rise above their situation and begin to claim their promise in god verse 3 i don't know who this is for and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate i want to stop right there there were four leprous men so context these four leprous men were actually in a worse position than the lady who was fighting to eat a friend's son if you're taught that that lady added bad these men had it worth and i find it very interesting four leprous men and the bible puts them together so it's not like a leprous man here makes one over here and everyone over here it's the truest sense of misery like company these four men all in trouble these four men have to deal with this incurable disease called leprosy these four men are equally privileged to not have access into the city i want you to get this the reason they're outside is because they were not welcome inside not as if inside had anything for them anyway so they're outside they actually buffering they are between the city and the syrians and they're just out there fellowshipping and they said to one another i heard somebody say this was a management meeting this was one of the most strategic meetings in bible history right here in the midst of this is four leprous men who the odds are against them they can't go and talk even to the king so the woman who had to get her her food tried to get his son she had access to the kingdom these four men have no access to the king they're outside the city they said to one another why sit we here until we die i want you to process that for a minute in other words they don't even know what's happening they don't know about elisha they don't know the king stomp of vex they don't know the king palliator kill elisha they don't know a miracle about to happen they just there all of these circumstances around them and they just say wait a minute hold up hold up hold up one minute hold up one minute you know we're going to die you know they tell us to stay here the reason they were there because they couldn't go inside so they had to be outside so they tell us come outside we have to die but do we have to stay here in other words is there anything we could do about the situation and this is what i want us to capture tonight and i and i and i said it on sunday and i said i would address this tonight if the lord would help me that they began to strategize they start to analyze the situation and i'm saying before many times a lot of us don't sit and analyze our situation these men sat there long enough to do all of the possible analysis that they could do they understood in their mind that all of the options has depth at the end of the equation so if debt is the equal sign the variable is sitting here or moving it's some real logic and analysis so in other words the equal sign is die die die from all appearances but we have a choice and i was making the point that no matter what you have a choice you have a choice tonight to leave this room depressed or with hope you have a choice tonight to leave this room saying my family will be delivered or you can leave this room going back and do what i used to do before you can leave this room speaking totally positive and kill negativity from your language you can leave this room tonight saying by his stripes i'm healed you can leave this room tonight saying i am going to have a revival you can leave this room tonight saying things might be bad but i'm not going to sit here and just let it get worse come on now you could leave this room tonight saying i'm not what i used to be but i'm i'm not where i'm supposed to be but i'm not where i used to be but no matter what i'm not just going to sit down and let life happen to me oh come on now i'm not gonna let what is happening around me determine what my mo i'm not gonna just sit down here and do nothing about my family i'm not gonna sit here and hope something changes what can i do different anybody with me tonight what can i do about my situation i could sit down here you know many people just freeze can we go on a little bit why sit we here until we die it's a real deep question if we say look at the analysis and i want you to go through it whether it's in your business in your life in your family whatever it is if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there let's pause for a minute in other words first option they analyze was let us go back into what was familiar ground we could go back in the city where we may have lived there before i don't know go back into what we know we write outside at least even if we go back inside and they he wasn't gonna do is push us back out but at least i saw millia ground at least we know fred and joe and harry on the inside and at least even if we die we can say hey fred it's a long time i see you because you know out here and i can't see you but they understood the famine is also in the city and we shall die there so it is an option going into the city and dying there the reason is still better than sitting on here and dying here sitting down dying here i don't even get to see what change in the city but if i go inside at least if they change the color repeat at least i will die knowing it used to be orange and now it's blue it's still a better position in other words i'm showing you in this doing something was better than doing nothing so if we say we will enter into the city then the families in there and we shall die there and if we still sit here or sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall i said fall unto the host the whole host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall die so let us is a 50-50 situation here so these brothers analyze and i want us to take this whole analysis in our lives because a lot of people when things happen they just curl up and say okay that's it i've given up i i done i don't know i don't know what to do again i try this i try that i do it i do that you know what i just don't yes wherever i'm at you ever hear anybody talk so i can't be the only one who hear that wherever i'll put my parents let's live just taking school says i i work too hard i try too much i think the thing i just go and sit down here and you know die is it yes whatever happened virus if it was a virus if it's not embarrassing something else is that people talking so but these lepers who knew death was their portion by virtue of the disease they had still but abandonment called a dingy feet he said it wasn't much of it it was a little bit of it fade based on pure reasoning facebook and logic it was logically never put pen on paper i said i do the calculation first equation equal debt hundred percent debt if we go in into the city second question if we stay here hundred percent debt because matter time anyway because we have no food so understand this is not just the debt of the leprosy you know it's famine they were not the fear they had let me make sure i clear on this the fear they had was not dead from leprosy their fellows over that they don't accept that as a reality they were trying to extend their lapras life oh god lord help us i may have never heard it like that before the leprosy wasn't concerned the fear let me read it again if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city they were concerned about the famine not their leprosy i want you to catch that so they were saying even though i have a problem i want to deal with the area of my life i can fix i can't fix the leprosy but you see my belly empty high trying to find food if we go into the city there's no food if we stay here there is no food the syrians they are not deceived i want food i want you to understand if they save us alive we shall live in other words because you will get food we will live and if they kill us we shall but die we'll be back to the same position but unlike equation one which was a hundred percent debt and equation two which is a hundred percent dead this was 50 50. we have an opportunity to make it through this thing anybody with me tonight amber branham in preaching this short about the possibility of saying you have an option to run out of where you act and run into your blessing and he showed it as christ okay and they rose up in the twilight could somebody say twilight they rose up in the twilight which was that period because they don't want nobody see them they don't want their people to see them because they're not supposed to be moving they don't want the enemy to see them to go into the camp of the syrians and when they will come to the utmost part of the camp of syria behold there was no man there hallelujah for listen for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said to one another oh my i don't think i'll finish tonight they said to one another lord the king of israel had hired against us the kings of the hittites and the kings of the egyptians to come upon us so the magnitude of this situation so let me let me read this other verse and then talk about it wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their life so here it is and this i'm going to try to close up soon god is so great at fulfilling his word there are a few things here it doesn't matter to god who he uses first point god is so interested in his word being fulfilled that he could take the four most unlikely people four lepers who using logic they're not in the spirit they're not saying is the lord tell me to go they are being purely motivated by their hunger and they decide to just step out and fit as they move in the twilight lepers are not known for being physically fit it's not that they were running up on the enemy but by the branham said as they begin to move god caused a rumble so their men shuffling down taking their little choir time and as they're shuffling god amplified that shuffle into a rumble in so much that the syrians who know that the israelites have no army say vietnam you mean them fellas go and hire the hittites and hire the egyptians because they can't fight they go on and get reinforcements and those fellas run they even jump on the horses that has to be fair great fear when you even say well i'm a ride away they love their horses you see when god wants to do something how we can bring such fear to the enemy that the enemy can even catch itself they start to invent a story of what happened you know they said to themselves that the israelites hired the hittites higher the egyptians they were so running for fear fever their life they leave their horse they leave their donkey they leave the tent they leave everything and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp they went into one tent i can imagine i want you to imagine they state these are men who are used to when you come a certain amount of feet from somebody say unclean unclean that was in law in fact under the law if you didn't say unclean you could have been put to death basically because as a leper you had to say unclean because it was contagious these were men who were used to tentatively easily being very careful with their movement so so they're not rushing because they ready they come and they themselves understand and this is what it is when god began to bless you you might even understand how it happened these men and the easily imagine they slowly pull back the top lane or whatever one tent and say is this real boy let me just let me just peek inside and see if some people are eventually hiding inside here and they just waiting to trap us and these leopards came in and they went into one tent they'd eat and drink and they carried them silver and gold and raiment and they went and hit it they never doesn't have a revival they they eat they get clothes they get silver they get cold and then they came again you know what nfl i say listen listen hold up hold up hold up we can go back in there they came again and entered into another tent and carried dents also and went and hit that too and then they said to one another they call another management meeting but this one was not like the first one they call another management meeting and say we do not do well we do not well we do not well this day is a day of good tidings and this good tiding is the same thing i say in the gospel and we hold our peace if we tarry till the morning light some mischief will come upon us now therefore come and we may go and tell the king's household so these men say listen this blessing is too good to keep it a secret what god has done for me is too good to keep it a secret and when god does something for you you always know when god does something for somebody you know you can't keep it a secret if you can keep it a secret then you need to get a bigger miracle you need to ask god for big things you know brother branham said that ask god for big things because i got for small things because that woman who was at the well when she found out who she was in the economy of god she said come see a man it drove her i don't know if she was shy but clearly the time she went she really didn't want to be observed so she broke all of her own rules of going when nobody else was there because what had happened to her was so tremendous she had to tell somebody and these men had such an experience that they say we cannot keep it to ourselves god gave us believers with such experiences in the supernatural realm that you were excited to tell somebody about the goodness of jesus can somebody say amen i'm trying to find a place to close out here soon so they came and called onto the porter of the city and they told him they came and called him because remember they already you know walking like normal people we came to the camp of the syrians and behold there was a man there there was no man there neither voice of a man but horses tied and ashes tied and the tents as they were and he called the porters and they tore it to the king's house within and the king arose in the night now remember friends this is hours now this is remember with a day and 24 hours it was twilight so now we're in the night time it's a lot happening quickly right so the king arose in the night and said unto his servants i will now show you what the syrians have done to us so now this is the interpretation now this year it's interpretation they know that we be hungry therefore are they going out of the camp to hide themselves in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall catch them alive and get into the city now you can imagine when the leopards here is this here this you you you could see how somebody fear and somebody perspective and somebody opinion you see like i listen to opinion the king have no clue but look how we invent a scenario and one of his servants maybe this servant had more hope maybe this woman had a little more feet one of his servants answered and said let some take i pray five of the horses that remain which are left in the city behold they are as all the material of israel that are left in it behold i say they are even as all the modular israelites that are consumed and let us send and see in other words 17 things are so bad at least you can try 75 and see if there's any truth to this thing and they took there for two chariot horses and the king sent after the horse of the syrians saying go and see and they went after them unto jordan and low all the way was full of garments and vessels in other words these men went even beyond the camp that was there and they realized that and they went unto them under jordan and lo all the way was full of garments and vessels with the syrians had cast away in their east in other words them fellas left so fast that whatever they were hearing even the little they took they drop it and was running harder so god already had them he has something because they love the horses they left things they might have whatever court they had whatever wallet they had never let's say listen wherever come in it's worse than we thought drop everything you have what even you have you're willing and run and the messengers returned and told the king and the people went out and spoiled the tents of the syrians so a measure of fine flower was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel according to the word of the lord hallelujah you see prophecy fulfilled word for word what the prophet said and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned in other words he might have a big work in the ministry he appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate and the people when they saw the food they lost all sense of reason and thrown upon him in the gate and he died as the man of god had said so he saw it he saw the fulfillment of prophecy he saw it so this would have been now just a day later as the man of god had said who speak when the king came down to him and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the king saying two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of samaria and the lord answered the man of god and said no behold if the lord should make windows in heaven might such a thing be and he said behold thou shalt see with thine eyes but shall not eat thereof and so it fell out upon him for the people trod upon him in the gate and he died i just wanted to read one quote from the prophet before we close out from the message as the eagle stir it up her nest but ibrahim said like the lepers at the gate they said why do we lay here until we die why they said if we go in the city how many knows the story samaria was being sieged by the syrians and they were so hungry they were starving till they either back off the tree the grass off the ground and they boiled one another's children to eat do you remember that and these lepers couldn't come into the city they were leopards they thought it was contagious and so they set at the city and they said why do we sit here till we die now listen close if we go into this city we can't get nothing to eat they are dying in there if we sit here we'll die if we go down to the syrians if they kill us what if it we're going to die anyhow sit in here and they just save us why we be made whole how many remember the story all of you sure now they had to take a chance you know what the story was but that feat they started down towards the syrians and god had a big rumble to come on the desert and they ran away and left their tents and left their food they found plenty to eat and not only and i want you to catch this now and not only did it save their own life but they saved the life of the city the people how many knows that now look what a chance they had to take you don't have to take that chance but if you sit where you are your sickness if your doctors give up on you you'll die and that's all you cannot lose by trusting god and you're not asked to go down to the camp of an enemy but you're invited to the house of god who is waiting for you there's no losing there's only one way to lose that sit still and don't act on it how many says that's true amen is there's one thing god can do yes there's one thing god can do did you ever know that he can't feel that's one thing he can do he cannot feel he has to win every single time because hold on he has to win every single time because he is god heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail i love what the prophet said there's only one way to lose and that's the don't act upon it that's to sit there and use the type if your doctor give up on you don't sit there do something about it and he also said listen friends when those lepers stepped out they must have had family they must have had friends they must have had connections in the city that they were kicked about because of the leprous condition but the faith that they had to do something about their situation was what led to the salvation of their family of their loved ones of the people of israel so i come tonight to challenge you to encourage you to motivate you with this simple scripture yet a powerful story as part of spiritual history because it's not a fairy tale this actually took place this is history that we're talking about without this we wouldn't have this to even talk about we wouldn't be where we at but this is how god allowed it to play out and we could look back to this day and say you know what yes i have a choice yes you have a choice and yes there's a choice to do nothing but i choose to do something i choose to make a church that will make a revival i choose to double up on praying i choose to believe that god could change every situation around i choose to believe that he didn't bring us this far to leave us i choose to believe that he is in control of my house he's in control of your house i choose to believe that the prophecy of adoption is over me it's over you i choose to believe that the promise of the holy ghost is just as real as it was in the day of pentecost i choose to believe i don't have to sit here and die but we have strength we have faith with the little we have if we have to die at all let me die out there fighting don't let me die doing nothing if i have to die let me die fighting if i have to die let me die making every effort oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord remember that testimony of of that man who wanted the holy ghost he said lord if you want to fill me with the holy ghost you're going to find my bones right here in other words these lepers are willing to lay it all on the line for the chance for the chance to see things turn around are you willing to lay it all on the line not just for a chance but now for a promise because we're not playing by chance it's a promise and the promise is unto you it's unto your children it's for your family it's for your house a promise of the holy ghost a promise of revival a promise of him providing for you because you are children of the most high and if you are out of order tonight if you are not in the position you should be in spiritually then get back in line friends get back in line because once you're in line then the channel of god is there for you to be blessed can we bow our heads to our word of prayer our gracious heavenly father just a simple thought tonight lord and this scripture in second kings what you learn later in my heart to encourage your people that we don't have to accept this environment that we're in that the world wants to force this way and force that way lord but we're not going to sit down and let the world happen to us just as we are doing tonight this meeting tonight is is is pushing against sitting down and dying because we we make a choice tonight to be in this bible study we make a choice tonight lord to do something more to do something different to fight for every instagram in the spiritual in the natural in our lives so father god may you bless your people may you bless your church may you bless the young people may you bless those who may hear this tape and father may you encourage your people to be courageous to take the risk on jesus as the prophet said you don't have to go and fight no syrians you have to fight no war you're not fighting a war but you can have faith and confidence that god has a plan for us so lord may you bless your people may you strengthen your people lord may you bless the service tomorrow night lord and the minister who would speak father may you bless the prayer meeting father on friday and the sin was this coming sunday and until we meet again may you be with the people in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen may the lord bless you tonight you've been a wonderful audience god bless you good night
