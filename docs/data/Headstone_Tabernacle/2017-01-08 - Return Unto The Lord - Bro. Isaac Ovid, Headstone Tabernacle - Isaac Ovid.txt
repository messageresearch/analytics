Standing on the Promises we are standing on the word of God we thank you for sending a Malachi for Prophet to reveal the Hidden Mysteries so we could stand with a confidence that we are more than conquerors it's not just a scripture to us it is a reality to [Applause] us father we commit the service into your hands may you take complete control of the world as it goes forth it's not my word it's not man's word but it's your word may you use me as your instrument may you take my thoughts out of the way my ideas out of the way and Lord any man can read a scripture but it takes the Holy Ghost to walk out the pages of the Bible Lord whatever you want done today we surrender to your will and to your purpose we commit everyone into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says and the church says he amen amen amen God bless you if you have your Bibles would you turn with me to one portion of scripture we actually read this in our oldest night service and I do want to continue from my thought from old's night this week is a special week for us service continues here at the Tabernacle on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. and this coming Saturday we are calling a call to Arms a an assembling a solemn assembly this Saturday from 400 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. we want to call a prayer meeting for the entire church amen so clear your schedules clear your calendars and put God's business first so service continues on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. and this Saturday at 4:00 p.m. from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. we want to call upon God because we could preach too much much we could sing too much we could dance too much but we could never pray too much so you want to come and put everything else aside and shut down the weak and the thoughts of the weak and the agendas of the week and put God in his place because when he is in his place everything else falls into place you believe that this morning so we want to read one scripture reading from the book of Hosea chapter 6 I'm just going to read three verses verses 1 to 3 Hosea chap 6:1 Come and Let Us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he had smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain the latter and former rain unto the Earth may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated special welcome this morning to Samantha mahes where is she at Samantha mes invited by Maria Lui Welcome to The Headstone Tabernacle this morning and we are happy to be in the house of God so I have a title this morning it's return unto the Lord and this is part two I started this thought on all years night so is return unto the Lord part two and for a subject recognizing your day and your message and an inspiration a call to return a call to return and I'm praying and I have a burden in my heart this morning you know there are different types of services there are Services where you you preach the word and it's it's always a blessing because it's through the foolishness of preaching God ordained that Souls come to him there's also teaching Services where you teach the word and there's also Services where the needs of the people are ministered to and as we come into this new year of 2017 we must resolve in our hearts deep down that there must be a change it cannot be that year in year out service in service out you not seeing results at the end of the day life is about results the only way to measure your performances through some type of results it's easy to talk it's easy to to say things it's easy to even be positive and to be bold but being bold and being positive still doesn't mean results you could tell somebody you will do it and the saying of will do it or having the intention to do it still doesn't mean results you could start to do it and if you don't finish it's still not done you still don't have results and God is calling us to have results and the title this morning return unto the Lord it's such a burden on my heart because as I look and I've I've grown up in this message I've grown up in the church and as I look around and I see what has transpired over the years and the struggles but the Brandon preached a message why are we so tossed about he preached a message letting off the pressure to indicate the struggles of the day and the tug and the pull and the times you don't feel like you're in the spirit and the times you're on top of the mountain but at the end of the day every message that has been preached since the Garden of Eden and still being preached today is to return unto the Lord not to return to the church because they are people who are in church and they have not returned to the Lord it has not returned to the pastor because they are people who have a good relationship with the pastor but they don't know the Lord what we are talking about for 2017 is do you know the Lord and and that's what the burden is because he the Lord he is the pillar of fire he was the cloud by day the pillar of Fire by night it was the Lord that visited them on the day of Pentecost it was the angel of the Lord that met the prophet do you know the Lord hallelujah return to the Lord you could only talk about returning if you were somewhere before if you are in stand you right now and you came from Barataria or digo Martin or wherever you could only return to digo Martin because you were there you cannot return to where you never were before that's why this gospel we preach is not for everybody it's for the predestinated because the predestinated had representation by predestination you come from somewhere that's why even Jesus said I come from God and I'm going back even Jesus had a return to talk about he had to return unto the Lord in the midst of job's trial the exal the encouragement that job got was where was thou it was a reminder that he came from somewhere where you come from is just as important as where you are going to because we are creatures of Eternity we come from a different place we come from different rules there are different rules of engagement where we come from yo you walk different where you come from you talk different where you come from and we are going back to where we come from we are going back to the Lord you may be seated for a minute I'm praying that this morning will be a different kind of service that deep down in your soul you'll be compelled to do something different without a vision the people perish without a bur to people perish without listen in anything in life there is nothing in life that comes easy and if that's a law of natural life you think spiritual life will come easy if Jesus had to learn obedience by the things that he suffered it's a teaching to us that if you want something you have to want it bad enough real enough that's why brother Brandon preached a message desperation because you have to want it bad enough because when you want it bad enough you'll do anything is there anybody who wants it bad enough you want your healing bad enough you want your breakthrough bad enough you want the Holy Ghost bad enough you want to see your house in order bad enough you want to see your marriage in order bad enough it's real to you it's tangible to you not words not just coming to church what good is it to come to church and not have a difference in your walk what good is it to come to church and not see the blessings of the Lord there has got to your results there's got to be signs there's got to be Miracles there's got to be a change you should be able to testify I'm not what I'm used to be I'm not what I'm supposed to be but I'm changed 2016 is dead it's finished it's over but this year I'm going to return unto the Lord somebody say Amen [Applause] returning unto the Lord many in the church have lost their way we have preached about it before Mary and Joseph they were so caught up going to church they were so caught up in the convention so caught up in the routine that when they went to worship and perform their sacrifices and celebrate that they left feeling so good what a meeting what a service what a convention and for three days they testifying after the meeting and then ask the question where's Jesus so it's not so much in the shouting and the jumping and but if you lose the Lord in the picture we have missed a whole business there are people caught up in this quote versus that quote and they don't know the Lord come on now Hallelujah debating quotes doesn't make you closer to the Lord that's about a personal experience you don't even need to read or know how to read to know the Lord because he wants to introduce himself to anybody who will open up their hearts to him that's the real gospel an individual experience with Jesus Christ is there anybody here this morning you didn't come just to have church you didn't come just to be here because it's the first Sunday of 2017 you didn't come just to let people know you're still in church but you came to meet Jesus that's why I came because if you came for any other reason you are here for the wrong reason it's more important to know Jesus than to be [Applause] healed let me say that again it's more important to know Jesus than your healing your healing is a result of a relationship let me is there anybody in the house this morning no wonder David could say though he slay me yet I'll trust him forget about the flesh forget about the situation make sure that you leave this service knowing you know the Lord can the Church Say Amen [Applause] [Music] a lot of religious Spirits that's right people take from the gospel or from the scripture as if it's a buffet you know I'm going to di this year so I'm not eating cake and ice cream and I'm not speaking about me personally this is this is the buffet approach so they're selective I'm eating chicken now I'm eating fish um whatever it is and they want to take from the gospel what they want and then they want God to do something for them but returning to the Lord the choice of the word return puts the word Lord in a place so you return to the Lord you return to a place brother bandam taught us he said if you ever Miss Jesus anywhere it's not that he ever left you because he never will leave you it's because you left him so if you want to find him back you have to go back to the place where you left him because that's where he'll find him right where you left him he's not walking away from you we are the ones who walk away from God and whenever you walk away from God your life will never be blessed you hear this young people whenever you go against the law of God there is no blessing it may look like it's a blessing but there a price to be paid when you transgress the law of God and you know better than there's a consequence that has to be met there's a price that has to be paid oh yes oh yes we have in church this morning but I believe there are some young people in the house that want to return to the Lord there are some fathers in the house that want to return to the Lord we want to we want to dig deep we want to come to your house this morning let me read something from the prophet brother brand in the message Gyra said that's the way it is today with the people that's what's the matter with America tonight the only thing that could save America from Total Annihilation is to return to God with the baptism of the Holy Ghost so the way to return to God is with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the means to get back to God he said that's exactly right that's right and they are scared of it that's right God help us to have a Revival that will shake the shells off why are people scared of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will make you change your walk the Holy Ghost will expose in you what people cannot see it'll make you look at yourself different because there a new operator on the control tower of your heart the Holy Ghost will make you stop your line there are people who don't want to stop their line they want to hold on to their jealousy hold on to their Envy they want to hold on to something but the Holy Ghost makes you throw all of that out in the message what is the Holy Ghost given for but the bandam said it'll make you stop wanting to be a big shot that's what the Holy Ghost for he said it gives you power in speech it gives you power in prayer it gives you power to live a holy life it gives you power to overcome you may be seated so brother Isaac I'm I'm struggling are you desperate for the Holy Ghost are you looking for God to work or are you walking away from God so things didn't work out in 2016 things didn't work out for you so what does it mean give up no backslide walk away brother Bram was speaking one time and he said that he had somebody who would help him and he would drive around with this guy and this guy was used to smoke and he said the goodly brothers came to him and said brother brandom this guy you have with you who is smoking he's he's stumbling us because you're a man of God how could you be going around with this guy who's smoking he say okay no problem I'll fire the guy he said the same man who told him that he should fire the guy he said he went to meet with him and the minister said to brother brandham brother Bram I want you to meet my wife and brother brandham the way he describes it in preaching he said I'd never seen anything like that before he said her hair was bobbed back the dress was so tight looked like she poured herself into it she he had these blue and so much makeup and stuff and he he turned to the minister the same one who told him get rid of the smoker he said is your wife a Christian and the minister said yes she's a saint and brother Bram said no she's a haint and he said the reason it got to that point is because men who knew better had walked away from the Lord you could have a Bible in your hand and be walking away from God Amen amen the amount of services you attend doesn't bring you closer to God it's what's on your heart it's your prayer life it's not what we see it's what God sees understand this this is a requirement people over the years have gotten it twisted Church an attending church is not an option it's not something to do it's not it's not some it's a requirement the Bible says don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some it puts these some as a group of people who have the audacity and the arrogance to say that they could sit at home and edify themselves when God has placed in the church ministers for that purpose the arrogance because you may be seated you know what brother random said one time he spoke about even if you don't have a good church to go to still go to church and get a half a loaf get a quarter loaf get a piece of bread get a CCS biscuit but there is no excuse for sitting at home you may be seated it takes wisdom in 2017 to discern because all tools could be used for good and evil isn't that right you could use a gun to kill an animal you could use a gun to kill somebody you could use a gun to kill something that's coming against you so it's not the gun that's bad is how you use [Applause] it anybody with me this morning so the internet and the live streaming wasn't meant to replace the sovereignity of the local church it was not meant to replace assembling yourself together it was not is there anybody in the house this [Applause] morning the arrogance of some people to make their own scriptures I can sit at home and read the prophet quotes and edify yourself how it's a dangerous thing to venture Where Angels Fear To Tread it's a dangerous thing to think that that that that you could do it on your own when God has an order when you return to the Lord It's returning back to his order to his principles to the way he wants things can the church say Amen can I preach a little bit you may be seated I was having a great conversation with my wife and I said to her you know what I didn't choose to be head of this house the position was placed upon me because that's God's order oh you don't hear me is there anybody in the house this was not me pulling rank in the house I was just having I say wait a minute it was not my choice to be head of the home it's not the choice of the man it's a responsibility placed on the man to be head of his house that's the Bible is there anybody awakeing the church this morning we are returning to the Lord and when we talk about R return to the Lord it means returning to the scripture return it to the word return it to the principles that were laid down by the prophets and the apostles can the church say Amen you may be seated this is a different kind of service and that's why I love why God placed every church as Sovereign yes amen and we have one headquarters and that's the Holy Ghost can the church say Amen so I'm not accountable to anybody except God and my pastor so I'm I'm I'm free this morning to speak to the fathers I'm free this morning to speak to the husbands I'm free this morning to speak to the young people because we're going to have a real church or no church at all I didn't come here this morning to have a conversation or a discussion or a debate I came to see Jesus I came to return unto the Lord is there anybody Elight house that's the reason you came [Applause] here 2017 has got to be different from 2016 can I get a witness in the house you may be seated in management consultancy they say when you want to change a company you have to start from the top because no matter what you do on the ground level if the top isn't changed the problems will exist again and again and again and the problem in the message is not the [Music] people the problem in the message is not the Sheep the Sheep love Jesus the Saints won the Lord the problem is the ministers the elders the deacons oh my we having church this morning brother Shane I'm not speaking about any other church I'm making sure that we clean this place up so that the Holy Ghost can move in because no man could stop the Holy Ghost God will find you listen you don't belong to man you belong to God you have to return not to brother over it not to headstone Tabernacle return unto the Lord keep may be seated no wonder brother Bram said I didn't come to build a denomination and I come to bring people to myself that's not what he came he came to point you to the Messiah he came to point you to the [Applause] Lord every scripture every Prophet every apostle was pointed to the Lord so why is it we have men who pointed themselves why do we have people in churches who they can't talk about Jesus but they could talk about their pastors come on now I'm not talking about anybody else I want to make sure it doesn't exist in here because my responsibility is to make sure it doesn't exist in here the Lord is the head of this church it is his church we are instruments he can replace at any moment because you are the ones he died for and I put myself in that category the pillar of fire is preaching this morning I'm not even worthy to stand behind the sacred desk because what we want is the pillar of fire to take his place in this church can the church sa amen [Music] [Applause] so when a position is placed upon you now you have two choices Emmanuel two and only two choices you step up or you step out that's it on now if you are promoted on your job you have two choices you embrace the position and you step up to the task at hand or you will fail because you do not meet the challenge of the hour and in 2017 to the men in the church I'm speaking to the men in the church this morning right now you have been entrusted placed in a position of authority as head and priest of your house how could you be a priest of your house when you don't pray what kind of priest are you when you haven't talked to God about your family I told you this morning we coming to your house we coming into your living room we're coming into the kitchen we're coming into the bedroom we're going in the back to see what's going on because we have to returnto the Lord and he has laid out the blueprint every Prophet every evangelist every preacher has been pointed to the blueprint which is the Bible can the church say Amen anybody with me this morning so if we want to have a Revival that's why brother Earth brandom said the preacher could never bring the Revival the minister could never bring the Revival the Revival as to start in your home and the same way we have to set the church in order is the same way you must set your house in order and say you know what I'm taking back the Reigns of my house I'm going to start the pray meeting let's have family prayer I'm going to pray in my closet when they thought I'd be reading the papers I'm praying when they thought I'd be worried I'm [Applause] praying can the church say Amen it's all right to get somebody to encourage you but when the Bible tells you David encouraged himself we have too many Christians who have become dependent and it's not just a spiritual thing it's a societal thing the government didn't do it for me my boss didn't give it to me the neighbor didn't do it for me and the reality is you are born to dominate born to have dominion born to be your creator just like your father what you speak is supposed to come into existence it's the fall of Man that prevented this power reaching to you but you are predestinated to get that same kind of power [Applause] back you may be seated I done left my notes already but husband love your wives even as Christ loved the church that's 2017 it's not a suggestion it's not a recommendation it's not advice it's not even counseling it's just the word of God it's just the truth and you know there's no scripture that says why love your husbands there's no scripture you can't find it because I'm speaking to the men we're going to get to the sisters in a little while husband love your wives because it's easy for a man's affection to go to his car to go to his house to go to a game to go to sports to go to this or that or the other that's right but God had to place instruction in there for husband to love their wives even as Christ loved the church and that even as Christ brings some qualification in there because Christ loved the church the Corinthian Church the Ephesian Church the Philippian church with all their mistakes he did everything in his power to get them back on track so you have no excuse in here you man of God you men of God I don't care what's happening in your house your love for your wife is unconditional because his love for us is UNC can I get a witness in the house this morning you may be seated can I preach a little bit husband love your wife doesn't mean if she washes the wees if she wash the clothes if she clean the house it's unconditional I don't care if the we tack to the roof if the clothes reach outside the door the instruction is love your wife there's no room for interpretation there's no [Applause] we are talking about returning to the Lord to his principles whether she could cook like the best chef or there's trouble to boil water it doesn't matter you chose her you married her deal with it love your wife that's the word and your blessing your freedom your anointing Your Grace your inspiration your walk with God is based on you [Applause] can the church say [Applause] Amen love has no eyes when you were married you didn't have eyes you loved everything now I sit with ch suddenly you're seeing [Applause] things stuff you never saw before you didn't see it when you were getting married but now you see I F you doing it this way and I I'm not talking about sight I'm not talking about the five senses I'm talking about love because God is love it's the attribute of God to love you may be [Applause] seated and as a consequence we should be such examples to the world it's a travesty it's an embarrassment when in the church we cannot have men who would show love to their wives [Applause] we have people in the world trying to put examples do it this way Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man all these scripts are when the Bible already sort all this thing out with two principles husband love your wies regardless and all your problems are solved when you do that it's all for you now we could go on to her but when you love her you sign your paper it's like you're on a job and you are co-workers in the vineard of the Lord and your kpis anybody with me your key performance indicator the way you are being evaluated is on one thing and one thing only in the house husband love your wives and when you do that say okay good you pass now wives Hallelujah [Applause] we are returning to the Lord this morning wives reverence your husbands you know what reverence means the amount of debates I've heard and then you know because men have lost their position God didn't put Eve in a garden first he put Adam he never spoke to Eve he gave adam instructions Adam was supposed to communicate to Eve what the instructions were anybody read a Bible anybody know what I'm talking about we are back back to the Bible this morning I'm you see when I come from behind the desk it's a whole different Ministry we are inside the house this morning so wives reverence your husbands we live in a messed up world it was not so from the beginning men have lost their place I was sharing with somebody yesterday when I was in university it was starting to happen that the males years ago 20 40 years ago Engineers doctors lawyers palot they were all males but men have stepped away stepped away stepped away there are times that driving the road and you see young ladies going to work and all the fellas sitting down in the corner men have lost their place but not because men have lost their place gives a sister or a woman or a lady let me use the word lady the right to disrespect your man reverencing your husband has nothing to do with what job he has how much money he makes what he does it's simply the word of God there is no excuse debate argument discussion your blessing is tied to you reverencing your [Applause] husband children the only commandment with a promise obey your parents honor your father and your mother you know that doesn't apply it doesn't qualified if they're in church or out of church some powerful teaching right because you could never win somebody to Jesus if you act disrespectful and arrogant to them because all they will say is now you're in church and look at you you're in church here and you can't even whatever they say after that but your life your testimony your testimony you you understand your testimony is based on the test that God send your way to see how you act that's your testimony your testimony is your response to the test your response to the situation I pray that when you leave church today you will vow to never do some of the stuff You' have been doing and you will truly leave 2016 in the past and say Lord 2017 I'm getting my heart right for the Holy Ghost to take preeminence in my heart in my house in my life on my job wherever I go can the church say Amen Give the Lord a hand of Praise this morning [Music] [Applause] Glory Hallelujah wonderful when you return to the Lord you find Joy true Joy when you return to the Lord you find peace real peace when you turn to the Lord you find success yes God wants you to be successful amen naturally financi spiritually God wants you to be successful why because he said you are to be his advertisement board so God wants to use you to win somebody else so your life supposed to be so blessed you supposed to be so happy you supposed to be so inspired so encouraged when people see you they say you know what whatever you have I need some of [Applause] that it has nothing to do with how you feel it has to do with your relationship it has nothing to do with your present condition it it is with a revelation of where you are going so because you know you're going to a city whose Builder and maker is God where there's no more pain there's no more sadness there's no more depression there's no more problems aren't we supposed to walk happy all the time knowing that what we're going through is temporary and the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed in us God will use you to reveal his glory his power his authority his anointing will be all over you people will see it they will take note that you have been with Jesus can the church say Amen everybody feeling fine this morning is this an encouragement to you this morning amen so we are talking about to return unto the Lord and it's a call to return my desire is that this message would ignite something in you that you could find yourself back to the Lord in the message of restoration of the Bride tree but the B said to restore means to return to the former owner or to bring back to the former estate of condition and we can enforce a claim to be restored we find in return and Jubilee and brother Brandon was speaking about this whole return in the M of return and jubile now we find out I'm going to read a little bit of course then we going to get into some preaching again don't fall asleep on me don't even think about anything else you know people have people who could selectively zone out you know Zone in and out Zone in and out don't know the devil take your mind and carrier down to Memory Lane and what happened last week and it's under the blood forget about it hallelujah what happens tomorrow God already took care that you are walking into your destiny your boss is there for a purpose he don't even know why he there but he there for you imagine God Chang the law just to make sure that Jesus could be born in Bethlehem the whole law he land the whole nation everybody had to pay the price for Jesus to be born in Bethlehem the airport full the harbor full the port is full people have to go back to where they come from the family just to make sure that Joseph and Mary start to make the move to get down to Bethlehem because Messiah had to be born in Bethlehem God will move governments Nations armies doctors lawyers bosses owners neighbors to make sure that that that Christ that's supposed to be born in you could be born in the place prepared for the word to be made manifest do we have any Bible believing Christians in the house this morning Hallelujah [Applause] brother I can't wait for the day when it's not just word only but we see the power and after 15 minutes the Holy Ghost move all over the building whatever is locked up in you that you've been carrying for the last 10 years it just unlocks and the fire of God drops him and burns the snake inside of your soul and you have such a joy such a liberty such a freedom Give the Lord a shout of Praise [Applause] somebody you may be seated Hallelujah this is the place to let off the pressure this is the place to relax in his presence this is the place to feel good about yourself this is when you can really be yourself you can let your hair down because this is your environment this is your atmosphere this is this these are your people this is who you'll be with for all eternity so make yourself comfortable feel at home you are welcome in the presence of the Lord he welcomes you this morning won't you welcome him with your worship welcome him with your praise he loves to inhabit the Praises of his people oh hallelujah oh my I feel so good I feel so good this morning this is God's time right now we're in God's time it's not your bosses time not your bills time not your sickness time all that we put on pause we put it on stop it's over but right now we are in the house of God we are on God's business enjoy the moment enjoy the service get in the atmosphere worship God be happy that he called you be excited that he predestinated you the trials could be hot it could be Heavy but you are blessed you are chosen for such a time as this that's 90% they are 10% you're not sure the trial so hard the trial you going through has your name on it because when you come through the trial you'll be an overcomer and unto him that overcometh will I [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God somebody say Amen Let the young people say amen let the Caleb say amen hallelujah you may be seated I know what the problem is you know some of you don't practice the presence of God during the week so it takes you some time to get back like you have to warm up so it takes a good one hour to wind you up but those who always in the spirit the moment you feel the anointing this reminds me of where I was D when I laid the foundation I might have slipped through eternity into time but every moment I could be reminded that I'm not from here that I come from God and I'm going back to God I embrace every moment to be reminded that I'm a warrior I'm a son of God I'm a conqueror I'm an [Applause] overcomer Hallelujah this week is going to be the best week of your [Applause] life you didn't hear me this week is going to be the best week of your life because you're starting it right you started in the house of God and you're going to be blessed because of your decision Because of Your Action because of your attitude because of your approach you may be seated you know when you listen to the business Community somehow I feel like this going to help somebody this morning huh you listen to business they tell you to be successful as an entrepreneur one of the things you must have is optimism you see if you're not positive you cannot make it negative people cannot make it and I tell you you have to do your affirmations anybody ever heard that they do your affirmations you wake up in the morning and these coaches charge a lot of money this is free this morning because God's word is without money without price and they tell you wake up in the morning look in the mirror and say I am strong I can make it I'm going to get more business I'm going to get more customers I speak negativity away and when you read the scripture let the weak say I am strong I can do all things through Christ who strengthen it me I say wait a minute these people go on and done pull things out the Bible and trying to sell it I try to motivate you when that's our thing all along let the weak say I'm strong I'm not feeling it but I'm not even going to speak the weakness I'm going to say I'm strong I'm an overcomer if you shall say to this mountain and don't that's the gospel [Applause] you may be seated why are you accepting sickness I heard a businessman from the US said last year he was not sick because he told himself I will not accept sickness in my body and I was like he's not even a [Applause] Christian when the Bible says life and death is in the power of your tongue so whatever you speak you can whatever you bind on Earth it's not a law you bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth so your children they already delivered say it speak it your finances free your health you are already well speak it walk into it Own It claim it it's your promise it's the word of God you may be seated let me give you another example whether brandham spoke about this he said a blind man came to him he prayed for him but the guy didn't know about affirmations so he went back he come back to the line again but the BR said you're healed but I want you to go around saying by Stripes I'm Healed by Stripes I'm Healed and listen at first when he was saying it there was no weight in what he was saying because it was just words but after a while it start to resonate by Stripes I'm heal by Stripes I'm heal by Stripes I'm heal by stripes and heal until one day his words connected with his faith and whenever words and Faith connect it's a chemical reaction something has got to happen so I'm going to be filled I'm going to be filled I'm going to be healed I'm going to have a Revival I'm going to get a breakthrough God is going to make a way he will deliver me he is going to work it out he's going to work it out oh I'm going to have joy I'm going to have peace I'm going to be adopted I'm going to be perfected I'm going to be changed I'm going to be transformed I'm going to have a Revival I can't stop now I can't stop saying it I can't stop believing it God said so that settles [Applause] it can the church say Amen he's a little warmer in here feels a good in here wonderful Hallelujah Give the Lord a hand of [Applause] Praise now let me get in a little deeper in the M return and Jubilee brother Bram said now we find out when Joshua divided the inheritance to the people each person was placed positionally exactly the way these Hebrew mothers named those children how they were placed in Palestine just at their place Asher G and naal and each one Judah everyone just placed in their position so you must be placed in your position what a wonderful picture it gets us because it's a type of God placing in the church himself listen to the prophet he placing himself every member every stone every place every Christian to itself each one of us in our peculiar way that's why we can't be like everybody else you can't be like the person next to you God chose you in your own peculiar way you are a flower in his garden and he loves you just the way you are he loves your height he loves your walk he loves your smile all he wants is your heart to be a new heart a new spirit and his spirit in there can the Church Say Amen so you know something is wrong because brother talk about it some Churches you see the spirit of the pastor and the people all everybody dress like Pastor smileing like the pastor the pastor to shake his hands like this everybody doing that and they lose their own peculiar way because they have the spirit of man but what we want is the spirit of the Holy Ghost because that's the only Spirit that's important because I don't know if I'm going to get to it but but said man will fail man will fail do you understand that preachers will fail and God set it up that way so that your confidence is not in the man but it's in the Holy [Applause] Ghost you mean God will let the P to make mistakes of course because he's the one doing the moves because God will share Glory with [Applause] nobody listen God will not even share his Glory with the prophet because the prophet was on the fields ministering and people were baptizing in his name he left the convention to go to clean that up because he didn't want no worship he's not deserving of worship Hall only God deserves a worship can the church say Amen let's move on so what a wonderful picture it gets us because it's a type of God's placing in the church himself every member every store every place every Christian to itself each one of us in our peculiar way has a place in the house of God hallelujah like Solomon's Temple when it was cut out all over the world but when it was brought into jopa by floated in and took there by oxcart and all these rocks had their place when the temples went together and I think that God down through this time has cut out some very odd stones that we might not have understood amen oh my and there brothers and sisters you can't understand but you can judge it because God cut the stones odd an odd means you can't understand it it's odd to you but to God the peace fits just where it's supposed to be so don't get fight with anybody brother so and so where no he's odd it's so easy to look at other people's problems you know I saw a letter from somebody blasting everybody I told my dad there's nobody didn't blast at least he got to end it to say well let me shoot myself too and say I'm wrong but you want to shoot me shoot you shoot you but the George is this but the jerem is this but the mon is when they tell you finish you finish you kill everybody so you alone going to heaven like I saw a meme on Facebook a young girl crying and somebody consoling her and she's crying and the other girl is saying I know he promised you the whole world but where were the rest of us supposed to [Applause] stay so the end of the day be careful when you go around pointing this one you see how that one living how that one living has nothing to do with your walk with [Applause] Christ we have to be so mature and grown up now that you could come to church and your focus is the word if other people want to do foolishness that's them listen that's why there's a remnant yeah that is actually a har statement huh but it is the truth because I want to shake some of you that's why there's a Remnant and the remnant will be made up of people who heard the word but did not recognize and act upon it that's why but PE hearing recognizing and acting upon the word are we there this morning everybody with me this morning so when you hear and you don't recognize but I would like to believe that everybody here is hearing and recognizing so the issue is the action putting the word of God into action the action of forgiveness is an action love is an action word isn't that right Hallelujah worship is an action word I'm a I'm a silent worshiper don't worry my mouth will ever move I'm worshiping in my heart when the 24 Elders throw down their crowns John say all in heaven heard him all on the earth heard him all under the Earth heard him and you want to be a silent worshiper you worshiping God in silence that silence was at least Even Silence in the Bible was for a space of half hour it was a limit so I pray the limit of your silence could be broken this morning and you could be free to give God a shout of Praise like you've never shouted before so let's continue do we have time this morning are you enjoying the word this morning you know I heard somebody say and I just find myself 2017 is just for me but the George I've just been so tired of the routine and people just coming to church going home is just a normal thing and say you know what we got to do something different so I heard somebody ask a professional how long you know in this world of modern technology they say video is the future so video on Facebook video he say how long should should a video be short long how to hold people attention he said it doesn't matter about the length you know it's about the content am because something could be 10 seconds and it's boring but you know much people are still watch TV series for days the eyes day they holding up a because it good they watch a game for 5 hours game go to overtime and they say well it's only 90 minutes a half of this game when the game go now now it go to overtime they have they paying more attention because it's a tiebreaker and in the spiritual realm we have reached the tiebreaker all the ages that were playing this game we have now come to the tie breaker seven Church ages we at the end of finishing of the seventh seal now it's overtime we are in overtime this morning it's already been spoken time shall be no more we in overtime this morning but there are some names that are written in the book that still need to be delivered so we are in overtime this morning for your husband for your wife for your children [Applause] woo glory to [Applause] God so when you come to the house of God is to get some good content Mana hidden Mana from under the seven seal it eating good it tasting good you could share it with everybody that's how it's supposed to be contagious you should never come in here for a at but he is downstairs I want a box put up somewhere that save frustration right outside the door when you walking just tap it just say that's it I leave it there leave it there and the deacons will empty a juny service so you can't even pick it up when he walk back out Jesus because that's what the gospel is Jesus said de at a well have no need of a physician but I came to those that are sicken and are weary and when he finished with you you're healed you're delivered you're set free you're not the way you used to be and brother Bram taught us whenever you come to the house of God you either get better or you get worse so I pray that by the end of this service you all leave here better with a confidence and a boldness that you could approach the throne of God and say Lord I want my inheritance I want my portion I want my individual experience I want my family I want my house can the church say Amen so let's move on hallelu Jesus just exactly uh Hallelujah every one of us has a place right all these odd rocks had their place when the temple went together and I think that God down through this time has cut out some very odd stones that we might not have understood but they have their place exactly in the temple in the building of God so it's not our place and that's why somebody asked me recently what my thoughts were and a matter outside of this church I said my authority is limited to to this church that's what sovereignity does am sovereignity places my responsibility in this Sovereign church and God entr trust and places the responsibility of other churches on their pastors and if they don't deal with the situation God is the one who will move the pieces out if he has to amen amen can the church say Amen so I think that God down through this time has cut out some very odd stones that we might not have understood but they have their place exactly in the temple in the building of God and Joshua by inspiration not by just mathematics that's the prophet he inspired by God he lotted each one of those Patriarchs in their position just exactly the way their name belongs what a picture it puts before for us of God in his master Works no one could have ever done it but God there's no way of doing it God Alone huh it was for to be there forever it was a gift from God God by His Marvelous Grace give these people this land in this position and place them in it according to his word and the birth of his people just perfect how it clocked right together and I think it was a type Hallelujah can the church say amen hallelujah and now no one else could take that place in other words when God places you in your position that's your position nobody else could take that place it had to be for Israel alone just them alone was the only ones that could take this place and the blessings on the place so only they can take the place and the blessings that come with the place so when he return to the Lord Brother Shan there are some blessings that come with returning to the Lord when you return to the Lord It's returning to your position that you were supposed to be in and your blessing is tied to your position you may be seated So when you say I've been a Christian but God has not been blessing me are you in your place are you where God wants you to be because your blessing is tied to your position and listen you cannot be living in sin when you're outside of your position because when you're are in your position you are protected when you are in your position you are on your ground because that's the ground God gave to you the only time you get yourself in trouble is when you went away from your position but this morning the message is return unto the Lord return to your [Applause] position can the church say amen God bless you brother Hugh good to see you how many appreciate brother Hugh always working behind the scenes amen amen amen amen and I do want to recognize Brother Thompson brother Timothy Granville Brother Francis Timothy who came up here I believe last week Thursday to work on the sound system there's so many things behind the scenes you want to put your hands together for them listen everything in life takes work if they didn't come up this wouldn't be working this way this morning so you do your part ask how you could support because it's a kingdom of God it's a move of God it's a work of God don't just come and it's going to happen no it's going to happen when you help make it happen can the church say Amen we all have our part to play It's one bu right now the leg here and and you and the hand you still behind here but let's move together can the church say Amen so now no one could take that place it had to be for Israel alone just them alone was the only ones that could take this place the blessings on the place and if somehow or other and this might be for some of us this morning if somehow or other during these times if they lost their inheritance by some means by some so somewhere along the road in your Christian Journey you find yourself just not at that place that you know where you felt the power of God because you know when you got save you know when you had experience how it was for you but somewhere along the journey you have come from that place somehow be it your home be it your job be it sickness whatever the situation is you could look back and no matter what the situation is cuz it's different for different people you know you are not in the place that you're supposed to be so but the pr said if they lost their inheritance by some means it might been poverty it might been some other way that they lost inheritance their fathers one would leave it to his son and he would leave it to his son it belonged to the tribe it belong to that people forever because it was an inheritance and if I'm not misunderstanding the scriptures wrong I believe in a great Millennium that is to come you know what I mean they'll take right back to that place for we know Zion and we preach about Zion and the holy city some weeks ago that great City they'll not have day or night for the light will hang on Zion and I believe in the Millennium those tribe will take their position again all right now if somehow or the other the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God they come a year called The Jubilee I see there are some Bible Believers here this morning the year called The Jubilee every seven years they had a rest a Sabbath and every seven days they had a Sabbath every seven years and the seventh Sabbath was 49 years and the 50th year was a jubilee is anybody with me this morning and in this Jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance every man that found himself away from God away from his position away from his inheritance in this Jubilee every man that has lost his inheritance by some means whatever the means was if he was a Freeborn and a true blooded Israelites no matter who held a position it had to go back to him free what an encouragement this morning he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't to do a thing but just listen stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance what are you saying with Isaac it was not your labor it was not your work it wasn't even your prayer when the Jubilee sounded it just meant stop doing what you were doing and go back to where you're supposed to be and brother that's what I believe this year is for us it's our Year of Jubilee to stop whatever you were doing and go back to the place where you belong oh you don't hear me this morning oh you don't hear me this morning in other words you could stop being sick stop being depressed stop being a Halfway Christian stop just coming to church stop oh now you're getting it stop just just being up and down you could stop all of that there's no more Taskmaster Pharaoh just got serveed as notice this is Jubilee time this is bride time you got to let them go there's nothing he could do about [Applause] it glory to God you may be seated you just stop whatever you're doing you don't even need permission he just stop Hallelujah stop the tape stop the movie stop the internet stop FIFA stop the work routine stop the schedule just stop just hit stop don't even worry about the consequences of stopping stop those friends Stop Those phone calls Stop Those WhatsApp Communications Stop Those Facebook just stop and return two action stop and return just stop and return there's no other work required it's just stop and come back stop and turn around stop and repent and watch God do the rest because he is the master of the Year of Jubilee He is the deliverer he is the restorer he is the baptizer oh Hallelujah is there anybody this morning who's going to stop you ready to stop stop being under the payroll of the enemy Hallelujah you maybe see it you know the devil has pay right the Bible speaks about it of I said the wages of sin sin have wages when you do sin you're getting paid don't worry you're getting paid God do pay he said the workers came and he say I going to give you a penny yes there those come for the first hour or the second hour everybody with me is a this gospel is a simple gospel know people want to make it complicated so mysterious that you leave here your eyes open you don't know where you're standing you don't know where you're going but it's simple wages of sin have payment and is debt but the penny you get even if you're a 11 hour worker and you come in last minute just before they say we paying some people will even but some people may even get much work to do you know because in 11 hours how much work you have to do you have to feel for those who started in the first hour you know they they would they would have done a good 12h hour work and you just do one hour but they can look at you funny because the master say given the same pay the same Holy Ghost the same token the same inheritance the same signs the same wonders the same Miracles the same adoption the same Perfection same spoken word same 16 elements getting changed same Rapture same the same thing so you can walk in today and get the same pay can the church say [Applause] amen he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance Oh my he had a right to it yes sir it was a god-given right because he God by Grace oh oh no no no no hold on he had a right it was a god-given but he the individual rather by Grace had inherited it so God through his grace gave him the inheritance and it would have been given to his fathers and handed down year after year no matter what had taken place it doesn't matter what the situation is friends no matter what had taken place if he lost it it must go free it meant Grace is way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance what a picture it gives us tonight of the church in this last days hallelujah you see what man could do and then you see what God does What man does is failing and listen to the prophet and will fail has failed and always will fail amen that's right but what God does is eternal and must forever remain nothing can ever take it away God give it it's his free gift and by Sovereign foresight saw it and placed it and there's nothing can ever move it it's there eternally and at Jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people for restoring or be brought back to their rightful position am amen so friends there's a rightful position for you young people you heard that there's a rightful position for you there's a place that you're supposed to be and I believe brother Adam said that this is the hour again of Jubilee I believe it's a time of Jubilee can the church say Amen oh can we give the Lord a hand of praise and brother bam goes on in that message return on Jubilee to describe how the church has lost its burden and its Zeal and it's enthusiasm and he speaks about here in that same quot and he says and brother ly and I as we said there and out there that sister Mo's father and how he told me in the early days back in those days when they were persecuted and turned out from everywhere that he was a meeting on to where they had forbid them to Worship the Lord in the spirit and a group of people came up and shut through the windows with pistols and rifles and an old sister standing in the floor with her hands up in the air praising God while the windows was being riddled with bullets and rifles and the bullet struck the woman's dress and fell to the floor without harming her that's that's gospel is that the season we're going back to they supposed to be powering the Church you are Eternal listen to The Prophet after he said he say we need to go back to a power of God and something that could do the same thing today can the church say Amen listen although in our numbers but but the said persecution always gives strength to the church listen to The Prophet we've had it too easy we get full we get to a place where we don't want to move on because everything's just handed to us listen to The Prophet it takes so sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the holy spirit let me say that again it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and Fai and promise to move forward in the power of the Holy [Applause] Spirit brother said that Zeal and power that they had in those days has long time vanished from our assemblies he said I'm afraid if the windows would be shut out tonight people would run everywhere and never come back again speaking about the power that should be in the church in the message the first seal could you take some more I'm I'm just I'm still on the introduction huh in the message of first seal while all them Scruples of denomination arguing their differences about Creeds God promised listen that he would send us a true prophet of the true word with a message to return I'm talking about that return to the Lord to return he said to the original word of God and the faith of the fathers to do what to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost amongst the people with a power that will raise her above these things and take her in at that same time so this prophet of God and this word of God is to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost so when you return to God when you return to the word when you return to the prophet's message all of a sudden you are now a candidate for the expression of God by the means of the Holy Ghost to bring a power into the church a power to not only deal with the situations around us but to take us up can the Church Say Amen [Applause] God will bless anyone in the message Father the hour has come God will bless anyone who will go back to the old landmark of the Bible and start from the Bible not according to theology or some man-made theology but from True Bible theology and start from the old landmark and move up God will move with you and that's what I'm looking for friends to start with the Bible because you know what the prophet said we have to get back to the Bible and if you start with the Bible the prophet said because the Bible is the word of God the ministry of that Elijah Prophet was to make clear the Loose Ends that are in here that are above our pay grd above the pay of the Pentecostals who could interpret some of it but a prophet had to come to open up to an elect lady it was not for everybody but to an elect lady to open up the Mysteries and show you your name in here and to show you the journey and the battle plans from Glory so you could understand where this War Began where the war went through the Old Testament where the war went through the New Testament where the war went through the church ages so you could understand the devil at every one of his tricks and you could overcome and you could be victorious because David is waiting on you Noah is waiting on you Abraham is waiting on you brother brandham is waiting on you can the church say Amen Oh Glory to God somebody give God a shout of Praise from the message of zuza Jubilee brother B said what we need to do is get rid of a lot of our fancy fandangos and get back to the Bible and back to the oldfashioned Holy Ghost and back to the place where man and woman look and act and walk like Christians oh God take us away from the fancy fangles where men and women would look like Christians not just on a Sunday but look like Christians on a Monday on a Tuesday people must see Christian written all over you when you walk the street can I get a witness come on young [Applause] people man and woman look like Christian act like Christian walk like Christian amen you might think I'm a little excited that's a prophet he's getting as excited as I am I'm just a little crazy but I tell you I love to be this way that's the prophet do you love to be this way do you love this gospel do you want to be a real Christian it takes sweat it take tears it takes prayer it takes Faith but that's the only way is birth pains but you're going to make it can the church say Amen [Music] hallelu in the same message of zza Jubilee we're talking about going back returning to the Lord friends returning to the old Landmark returning to the scripture to the principles that were laid down for us on the day of Pentecost by the holy ghost itself but over the church ages it just weigh down and weigh down and there'll be a Revival and then it'll weigh down and Luther's day they had mechanical Dynamics and then after that but this day is the last day this day we have to return to the Lord the relationship that Adam lost we are going to have that relationship back can the church say Amen the whole of creation the whole of nature but said can will be a tooth AE to what's coming all of these sicknesses and diseases is because nature is out of balance because the sons of God are not in their position but God help us today a son get into the position nature knows when a son is in position God may you place somebody in this adoption season hallelu you may be seated hallu what we need today ministers hallelujah hallelujah what we need today brothers and sisters I'm reading from the prophet is this one thing amen not 18 things not 22 things this is the prophet's word what we need is this one thing the devil has got into our church and got us all formal indifferent what we need is a calling back a return to God what we need is in an oldfashioned Gathering Together Again is there anybody who feels that way oldfashioned Gathering oldfashioned prayer meeting oldfashioned sighing and crying for the abomination in the city oh God we need you now more than ever before oldfashioned sisters young people who catch a burden for their houses catch a burden for other young people catch a burden for the sick catch a burden in the house hallelujah what we need is an oldfashioned gathering together again the sounding of the Jubilee the pouring forth of the Holy Ghost the outcoming of the spirit amen sure there's cause to come back to the prayer meeting that's the word and I thank God for the burden this week to have that prayer meeting this coming Saturday don't you miss it make it your business from 4: to 6:00 p.m. be here in the house of God for that prayer meeting amen it's true we have just begun to Fashion off just like the world do just the same things the world does right Hallelujah that's right we need to return unto the Lord yes sir how it happened brother's a lot of Hollywood evangelism and a lot of Television staying home at night watching television instead of going to prayer meeting all right and in those days he couldn't talk about Facebook and YouTube and Instagram and PlayStation and Wei but if brother anim was in here in this day he would deal with that as well because it's the time wasting element that sucks away your focus and attention from the things of God how do you explain somebody I missed the Rapture because I was just watching TV when you should have been at the premon or you're so caught up on doing stuff on your time that you had no respect for God's time you had no fear of the Lord which is the beginning of wisdom to understand that God will not call all the time and he said it seek ye the Lord while he might be found so he puts a time limit on his grace a time limit on his Mercy because grace and mercy can't exist forever after a moment it switches from grace and mercy to judgment in fact the prophet brought it out it's not even a mercy seat it's a judgment seat but because there's blood under the seat it's a mercy seat friends there's still blood there's still Power in the Blood there's still Mercy this morning for you to return unto the Lord don't you leave this morning if you know you are not in your position your prayer life is not in the right position your walk with God is not in the right position on the job you know nobody could tell you a Christian because you are just living any way you want your neighborhood they can't tell you a Christian when we just read we're looking for Christians who could walk like a Christian act like a Christian and live like a Christian return unto the Lord there's a lot more that I have but I'm not going to go too much longer the message today is a call to return amen her return unto the Lord Jesus himself said in Matthew 11:28 come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laden and I will give you rest people tried to find rest you know what rest is rest is a pause it's a it's a break because so many times in life the stress and the struggle and the pain could be so overwhelming we get frustrated we get tired tired we feel like giving up and and we look for that rest and then the problem is we try to find the rest in the wrong places amen that's what drugs is you know it's a rest it's a break it's an attempt to separate from the reality of life and in that moment when you are drunk or you are high you have rest a break from your life a break from your reality but Jesus stood there in the volume of the book and said come unto me all ye who are heavy laden all ye who are weary all ye who are tired all ye who are think of giving up and come and I will give you rest you don't need drugs for this rest you don't need to fornicate for this rest you don't need to steal for this rest I will give you rest the doctor cannot give you a prescription for the rest that I will give you but come unto me and I will give you rest is there anybody heavy laden this morning anybody need a rest this morning the struggle of Life the pain of Life the agony of life could get so overbearing but for this year you don't want to carry that weight this morning amen listen friends there's nothing wrong with being in labor there's nothing wrong with being heavy laden amen that's life sometime it gets heavy sometime it gets weary some sometime it gets tired sometimes you can't explain what's going on it's what you do when you are in that state and Jesus give he say come don't go by your neighbor don't go by your friend no no no no no no no no no don't let them try to solve that problem come unto me and I will give you rest you father you frustrated in your house come unto me I'll give you rest you don't know what to do

Inner Man return to the Lord and I will give you rest oh somebody say Amen the musicians can get ready come unto me all ye he didn't ask what the situation is he didn't ask what's the heavy laden issue he didn't see what are you laboring about what's troubling your spirit what's bothering you he doesn't want to know what the problem is he said if you're heavy just come if you're laboring in your spirit just come if there's a burden in your heart just come I don't care what it is just come and I will give you rest let us as a church let us as a people let us as Believers return unto the Lord let's cast aside the foolishness let's cast aside the things of the world let's empty our closets of the clothes we are not supposed to have let's empty our shelves from the movies we are not supposed to have let's empty our friends list from the friends we are not supposed to have Come All Ye who are heavy laden you are wary you tired and I will give you rest can the church say Amen hallu you can begin to play something very softly hallelujah hallelujah a call to [Music] return I am the Lord I am your God I am your king that's how the Lord speaks just very softly he said I am the way yes oh God have you left the way he is the way so to return to the Lord means to return to the way the Bible say there's a way that seeth right for a man are you walking on the way that seems okay in your mind you find justification for why you do what you do and it seems all right but it's not the way because only he is amen amen it's time to return to the Lord this morning he says I am the truth all right have you left the truth have you you accepted the devil's lie Eve had the truth but he rejected the truth to accept the devil's lie come on Father come on mother come on young people the devil been lying to you you don't need to dress that way young sister to get a husband you don't need to do it God will give you a husband in your time and season because God wants you to be happy he has not forgotten you he will take care of you put him first he'll take care of the rest to become all ye who are heavy laden and I will give you rest don't accept some lie God is the truth return to the truth this morning he says I am the life so to return to the Lord means to return to the life friends outside of this it's just death outside this it's just [Music] pain he said I am the door have you left this door what doors are you walking through right now they are doors you should not enter There Are Places you should not go he said I am the door this is the door that you're supposed to come through not some other door he said I am the bread of life what bread are you eating where are you going what are you trying to do in your own strength Jesus fed them with bread and fish and then say listen that's not my Ministry I am the bread of life can you return to the bread of life this morning he said I am the Good Shepherd when the pastor makes mistakes he is the Good Shepherd when you can't reach the Elder he is the Good Shepherd when there's no deacons around he is the Good Shepherd he said I am the light of the world have you left the light are you walking in Dark Places this morning are you going places you should not go doing things you should not do may this go down deep into your soul because if this reality is that confronted you'll be cut off because you'll be held accountable for what you hear this morning return unto the Lord and make your heart right it'll be painful but it it's a sweat it's a cry it's a deep desire in your heart to not go back where you were before not stay where you are but stop whatever you're doing and just return and see God he said I am the resurrection and the life so when we say return to the Lord It's return unto the resurrection and the life friends it's a joy to know that they who have gone before they're not dead they are sleeping amen but because they know the resurrection and the life in that Resurrection they going to raise up again we will see David again we'll see brother brandom again we'll see those who have gone before because they knew the Lord I challenge you this morning to make your calling an election
