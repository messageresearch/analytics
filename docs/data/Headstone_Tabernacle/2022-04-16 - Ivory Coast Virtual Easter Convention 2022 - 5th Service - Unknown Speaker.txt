for this great opportunity again to speak just in a little way of testimony to the bride of jesus christ around the world i want to thank all the believers around the world fellow ministers those that are going to minister in this convention and those that will testify as well i want to say god richly bless you i trust the grace of god is sufficient for us and i pray he will continue to keep us until the day of his return in a moment i just would like us to read through the scriptures i have here in the uh the bible talk with me to the book of isaiah and uh is reach these wise i'm taking this from isaiah chapter 61 from verse one to three the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord had anointed me to preach good tidings onto the meek he has sent me to bind up the broken heart to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that more to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to to give unto them beautiful ashes the oil of joy for money the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified amen let us have a word of prayer father in the name of jesus christ we want to thank you at this time and lord your word we just read and we want to bless you lord that you will help us in this hour to be a manifestation of your own person in the reflection by the characters of your world father i pray that you will bless our brother paul and ajaka and his entire team and church i pray that you will also bless our precious brother teo ovid and his entire church for all the great efforts they have been doing in getting us to have these meetings come around about us around the world and at the same time blessing everyone all the efforts they put together their time and everything we pray that you bless them our father lord them that are going to listen to this short testimony and many more things that will be spoken out in this convention we pray may your holy spirit visit every heart convict every heart of every saint and purify the people and prepare them all god for the coming of the lord this is the only thing that remains in this hour as we see these scriptures totally fulfilled our prayer oh father whatever you are doing in this season please don't do it without us we pray our holy spirit to be our guide we pray our holy spirit to be our teacher we pray our holy spirit to remind us we thank you in everything that at the end of it all lord only you will take all the honor and glory in jesus mighty name we pray amen amen once again i want to thank again uh brother paul and nigerica for this great opportunity for this easter meeting convention the team of which is the manifestation of christ in you will be the vindication of the rapture what a wonderful uh team that has just been selected much in the hour we are living in uh i believe that through the scriptures that we have read we have joined all the way from genesis down to revelation in the sequence of the timing of the church ages and it has come to the point that we are all everything we hear everything we see is pointing to us about the coming of the lord and if the lord is coming there had to be a people he's coming for and if there have to be people they're coming for it has to be that the bible has made us to understand that everyone has to prepare i could just imagine sometimes when we want to make a trip we will always get ourselves a prepared prepare prepare and everybody is preparing for a time because you know you're going to move at this particular time but we are in a strange world today that the same voice is calling from heaven and speaking all around and getting the people to get ready get ready get ready and it seems by the way things are going that some people are not understanding the readiness and how serious it is the voice that is still speaking to us that we should be ready and the only identity the only guarantee that we have is that even if everybody begins to get ready and whatever he thinks he wants to be ready about there is only one assurance one one thing that's that would assure you assure us that we be a manifestation of the readiness that we are the ones to be in the rapture what makes you to be what gets you to be now that brings about what we call the common statement people always said they say satisfaction is guaranteed that brings me back again to a liberal explanation and understanding of what is guaranteed what is warranty amen so we find that warranty and guarantee they speak too close about the same thing and i would like to say what is a warranty a warranty is a a guarantee from a seller that a defective product will be repaired or replaced within a specific time that is your warranty now we are talking about products and we are human beings we cannot see ourselves as products but like as a type and then what is a guarantee according to the ashford dictionary we find that a guarantee is a more general time and a warranty is a more specific it's more specific that is written and it's legal so the warranty is like a guarantee like i said before of the integrity of a product and of the maker's responsibility for it now in the team of this meeting he said that the life of christ in you is the total assurance what guarantees the rapture is a manifestation is what proves the manifestation that you are in the rapture many believers today believe that they are believers because they go to church they do all kinds of things they can act anyhow so long as they flow along with the religion of what flows within the church that is the assurance they're going to make a rapture everybody keeps saying oh i'm in the bride i am in the bride i am in the bride all right it's going to be not that way there is an assurance there is a specificity of some a specific thing that we really have to confirm you a true believer that is prepared to be raptured the bible say christ in you the hope of glory and we are waiting for this glory manifested to be manifested in us the glory plan god sent forth elijah the prophet in this end time william abraham according to malachi chapter 4 from verse 5 to 6 of a total restoration the hearts of the children to of the fathers to the children and the house of the children to the fathers said at least i come and smith the whole earth with the curse what is this restoration the full restoration of god's word because we knew in jewel we realized that there had been the eating down of the bryce tree this vice tree had always been the same tree that made manifested in the garden of eden and we saw how the locals the palma won the the the caterpillar they all came to really wash it down but thank god there was still life in the roots and at a point in time god promised that he's going to restore again and the restoration that he's bringing back again to his church is the restoration of his word by the holy spirit the reason why we must do all we can to get the holy ghost according to second peter chapter one from verse two and we have to look at what the scripture said there and he said to your fate at virtue to virtue knowledge to knowledge temperance temperance patience patience godliness godliness broadly kindness and then the holy spirit comes in to inspect all these virtues which is the true statue of a perfect man with the prophet made us to understand whether i'm able to feed my family or not let these vicious live in me and at the selling of this by the holy spirit because the holy spirit still leads the way from the beginning from the time of being converted and the holy spirit leads the way to begin to bring this additions adding of these virtues right into our lives so the quality of a believer that we really make the rapture that will bring the manifestation of the rapture is the one that has this life of christ in him these victims of christ in his life and that is the one the holy spirit is going to seal you become a finished work that would be the manifestation not one that we go we are in church you are in the bottom line we don't know where you are going to you know where you are going to we must be very specific in this hour to know that there is only one satisfaction that has been guaranteed for us christ that life of christ is the satisfaction guaranteed and that is the specific thing we need the entire world has been restored in this hour god sent forth his prophet and let it be your thai post today many people are in church are now living the life many people are in church and they don't want to do what the world says do many people are in church and they are worshipping other gods some are worshipping money some are worshiping all kinds of things somebody doing anything and whenever you bring up any issue they will have to question it it's not the time to make any question but it's the time that the manifestation of these virtues because you are not going to force it into your life it will be a thing that will operate in a very simple way because it has to be god in simplicity again so my brothers my sisters before i round up and as i wish as the ministers will be coming to minister the word of god i want to really address your mind back again to understand that there is only one thing that is guaranteed in your life and that is the life of jesus christ the start of a perfect man and so long as that has to be in you everything will be all right but if you do not have this you are not going to get it from your backyard or from the market or from the supermarket or buy with your money you only need to surrender your life to christ you need to repent repent of your sins call him into your life tell him to change your life let him change your life to what he wants to be done total surrendered life to him and let him feel you all completely and by so doing his life will completely enrich your life and when that is done the holy spirit god himself will be satisfied that when he come as a trumpet sounds that same voice the holy spirit will identify that's some word you have put in your life and from there up into the rapture may god richly bless you thank you god bless you hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah glory to god you appreciate those greetings today amen and amen god bless you amen we thank god for you amen and we appreciate that hallelujah to his name amen and amen praise the name of the lord we feel his presence he's all around us friends no matter where we are no matter how we feel amen the presence of god is always there we just have to reach

parts of the world that you might be listening in today uh for this easter program so it might be safe for me to say good morning good day good afternoon good evening depending on what part of the world you are and we thank the lord for giving us another privilege to have a time of easter which has assumed a better meaning and different dimension to the bride of jesus christ and we want to thank pastor paul for giving the privilege and the platform to be of service to the people of god believing god that somewhere along the line we can be of a blessing appreciate the sense in every course and in many parts of the world where they will be listening in may the lord bless you all very much also appreciate the technical team in uh in trinidad for the good work they are doing and for the blessings they have been to the body of christ by availing the sense their platform and technology to reach out to the believers in all parts of the world may the lord bless everyone and give you a very wonderful easter i bring greetings from the saints in nigeria too the saints are doing very fine and i'm sure they will be happy to know that the believers are well in all the parts of the world god bless you you are welcome to his presence amen um i will humbly request that will rise up for the reading of the scriptures this morning if you have your bibles with you i want us to thank to the book of exodus chapter 19. exodus chapter 19. i was wondering now if i should read the old chapter but if i didn't do i hurt everyone to read the whole chapter but i will get my thoughts very clear from the scriptures exodus 19 i'll read from verse one in the third month when the children of israel were gone fought out of the land of egypt the same day came day into the wilderness of sinai or sinai for they were departed from rephidim and we had come to the desert of sinai and that pitched in the wilderness and there israel camped before the mount and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shall say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bear you on egos wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priest an unholy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel i think this has a new testament also similarity when opposed to peter said that we're peculiar people a royal priesthood a holy nation separated unto god amen so we now know the secret of how to meet this qualifications the secret is very simple he said if you will obey my voice indeed amen let's not pay lip service to the world let's obey indeed then we shall be a peculiar treasure a treasure with distinction amen a unique treasure unto the lord oh wonderful verse 7 a moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him and all the people answered together and said all that the lord had spoken we will do and moses returned the words of the people unto the lord and the lord said unto moses lo watch this verse lo i come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and believe thee forever god said he will come down in the cloud thick one for the purpose of doing one thing for the purpose of vindicating his servants for the purpose of establishing the words of his servants he said let me read that again he said and the lord said unto moses lo i come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and believe thee forever and moses told the words of the people unto the lord we must finish this passage and the lord said unto moses go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and let them wash their clothes and be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai and thou shall set bounds onto the people round about saying take it to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoever touches the mount shall be surely put to death there shall not an end touch it but it shall surely be stoned or short through whether it be beast or man it shall not leave when the trumpet sounded long they shall come up to the mount and moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified the people and they washed their clothes and he said unto the people be ready against the third day come not at your wives and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud amen upon the mount and the voice of the trumpet exceedingly loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with the god and they stood at the nether part of the mount and mancini was all together on a smoke because the lord descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof accented as the smoke of the furnace and the whole mount quick greatly and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and works louder and louder moses spake and god answered him by his voice and the lord came down upon mount sinai on the top of the mount and the lord called moses up to the top of the mount and moses went up and the lord said unto moses go down charge the people lest they break through unto the lord to gaze and many of them that and many of them perish and let the priests also which come near to the lord sanctify themselves lest the lord break forth upon them and moses said unto the lord the people cannot come up to mount sinai for thou church or saying set bounds about the mount and sanctify it and the lord said unto him a way get thee down and thou shall come up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priest and the people break through to come up unto the lord lest he break forth upon them amen verse 21 verse 20 chapter 20 verse 1 says until and god spake all these words saying i am the lord a god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage thou shall have no other gods before me and on and on he gave all the entire commandments amen and when he has fully given the entire commandments it went into the ordinances and statutes and all the instructions and principles and everything right when it came down in the cloud and still on the mount so the fellowship stretched up to chapter 22 chapter 23 somewhere there before it was over may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his holy word god bless you you may be seated this moment if the lord will be our help which i trust he always has and he always will i want to speak on the subject that i called the easter cloud of our redemption the easter cloud of our redemption amen from the chapter where we reach we saw israel been brought out and they have actually come out and in their coming out god took them through the wilderness but the wilderness was not meant to be the end of their journey the wilderness is a place of sanctification a place of purging in order to really sift out the people for whom the exodus was actually meant because the bible told us that when the journey began because many people saw it as a great new revival just as a song that we do sing says i'm going through i'm going through lord i have started to walk in the light shining upon me from heaven so bright i begged the world and it follows at you i've started with jesus and i'm going through in another verse he said so many started to run in the race many believed it because it is new but not very many expect to go through and the only reason for this is because every revival always attracts all kinds of seeds every revival attracts all kinds of people it will attract the genuine ones who will be able to go through completely it will attract those number who will only stay within the range of the message they can go past the range of the message of the hour it will also attract those people who will come in just to take offense at the message all these things i'm saying the message had already for warned us about each and that is why in the message unveiling of god the prophet said sometimes we need to speak or do things in a certain way and the prophet said it is done intentionally it is done deliberately in order to do what thin down the crowd but you see everybody will hear the same thing just like abel and kane heard the same thing but came with different response to the same gospel that they had because one will be hearing by revelation the other will be hearing carnally everybody will hear the same thing but the prophet said there is going to be different type of reactions to the same thing that will be heard god is not going to call some people somewhere else or put some people another place to talk to them if we talk to them the same thing the same way the same time but each will pick their understanding of the same thing by the type of seed that they have this is why the prophet said this one thing they will hear will make some people to ponder we make some people to get annoyed and work out when they walk out they stay in the compound weather wondering whether to live permanently or to come back inside but the same thing and it will make some people to just walk out to the gate and go forever never to come again and it will make some people never to leave their seats but to sit there and to ponder and say lord have mercy upon me and the prophet said that thing is said intentionally in order to achieve that why because every revival is also attractive not only to the genuine ones but to the mixed multitudes and this exodus here and its revival was no different in the scripture the bible told us that when moses came with many mighty signs and wonders which there were signs miracles and wonders to the real exodus people but a judgment to the egyptians the plagues were signs and wonders amen it punished the egyptians but it was a blessing to the true israelites now all those great things attracted some parties from even people who are non-israelites for people who do not even know what the content the context and the and the and the fact of that revival is it attracted them because as in every situation many will be attracted to a revival for different reasons when martin luther had a mighty revival a lot of people were attracted to it not because they understood the message of justification not because what martin luther was saying was anything to them but because they saw it as an avenue to be free from the yoke of the roman system whether spiritually or physically and they are seeing a man who was championing the cause of coming out of that system and is not getting out he's not getting killed nobody is disturbing him they said this is an opportunity for us to also do what for to also come out of it some wanted to be free from the burden of penitents from wanted to be free from the burden of offerings and the levies that they have been put on them amen and that was the reason they left luther and that was why it was said the greatest victory in luther art was not to protest the catholic church and get by with it but to be able to rise above the fanaticism that greeted his revival because in that revival mixed motion also went with him mixed multitude are people who do not understand why we are doing what we are doing they just wanted to be free so they consider that revival a means to their own end so in this revival also the scripture made it clear to us that a lot of mixed multitudes went with them we don't know their number but they were in that number they sang with them they enjoyed the water from the rock they were eating manna with them every blessing that god send that upon the people it was sent unto them even when god was given instruction he said this instruction these ordinances are not only meant for you israelites even for the strangers who are in your means folks also a lot of them perhaps they were first born and so forth they you know they saw the revival started with the blood of the passover lamb do you know what they did they also put themselves under age and because the deal is when i see the blood i will pass over you they also escape the death of the passover night so every blessing that a true israelite is enjoying was also enjoyed by the mixed multitudes but then the seed cannot be aired with the shock mixed multitude could go very far but it can never go to the end judas's carriage went very far but he never went to the end and as such these guys are going so far this is the reason god did not just take its people out of egypt and just put them straight into the land of canaan what did he do he allowed a gap period of a wilderness journey the wilderness journey is like a sanctifying time wherein we test virtue and we test rebellion your own individual sanctification is also a testing time to test whether you will be a rebellious child or a general child of god that we go through that is the message of the prophet and the message of our present water from the living rock so it's a period to test the genuinely of the people because redemption itself has two harms as most of us know it involves coming out of a place and going into another place are you here church so you must come out of somewhere and you must be taken to somewhere if you are brought out and you are left hanging your redemption is not complete so god has brought israel out of egypt their journey cannot end in the wilderness but the wilderness experience is essential because it will prove it will save amen it will separate it will cut it with lies so that only those who are genuine enter into god's inheritance [Music] there is nothing wrong with the message of the hour this is the third exodus if the first exodus went through that the last must go through it exodus is actually a redemption because it involves a calling out and bringing into somewhere the prophet said if god brought you out of a place and he didn't take you to where issues he would have done a poor job he brought israel hallelujah out of egypt is taking them into the land of promise amen when he came in flesh in the second exodus he brought the church out of religion amen he brought them out of religion and he brought them to the church amen he called them out of the religion and they make a church out of them hallelujah in this last one he is calling the bride out of the church and if he calls us out of the church there must also be a homeland amen there must be a fresh canaan a spiritual land of the baptism of the holy ghost that he must bring you and i into and so the journey is just the same but you see i want us to watch something here very important when he brought them out they have crossed the red sea they have sung the song of victory amen they have enjoyed all the goodness of the lord god knew that for these people to be sustained he must give them something for their journey the signs and wonders up through the crossing of the red sea up to the water from the rock up to the manor from heaven up to the flesh and the meat that they ate when they cried for a variety of meals they were all signs miracles and wonders i want you to follow me because if you understand the first exodus you will understand your own exodus as i've always said the first exodus was the planting exodus the last one here is the harvest of all the planting and if you planted one seed in the planty season you are not going to rip just one seed you are going to read plenty seeds out of that one seed if it is a maze or icon from your one seed you have the potential to reap 612 seats if you plant two that is 1224 seats and many more like that so there is always more of whatever goes down in the planting coming up in the harvest so like i said before where you see one coral expect several colors today where you see one dayton expect several daytimes today where you see one abhiram expect many abyrams today and where you see one joshua expect many joshuas [Applause] expect many calibers those who will never come up with an evil report those whose report will not only bless them it will preserve them [Applause] and the prophet said the bible said they were able to give a better report because they have another spirit so we can begin to see the working of the holy spirit even from the old testament it might come upon them as an anointing or as an inspiration and is these last days is coming upon us as a baptism it's coming inside of us so if you show forth a greater life a more glorious life than it was under shadow after all if you see the shadow of something a man it is still not very clear until the substance declares it you are the substance of all the shadow that was in the first exodus so this age presents a more glorious age [Applause] you love him all right this is where i'm coming in that wilderness there were many outstanding things that took place and all these things we had done to prove the people in other to separate between the genuine siege and the falsies between the people for whom the revival is meant and the mixed multitude so whatever happened then expect a repeat of it now if that is god's pattern and program it is going to be exactly the same thing now in the first exodus the ministry that brought the exodus suffered both from within and without balaam attacked from outside but dayton quran and abiram attacked from within amen if those are the characters and if that is the shadow you would be expecting to see the same thing in this substance now here we come to one of the most crucial aspects of that exodus you will appreciate it as we go on in fact the redemption of the exodus was sealed by this aspect you heard god he said if you will indeed acting unto me and obey my words do you know that up till that moment he has not given the word for that hour go search the bible they have only been living by the first two blessings of every ministry they were living by the signs that we can say the sign in the end the messianic discernments which the prophet called the healing service that was why the face of moses ministry up to that point revolved around signs and wonders i want you to follow this very closely it will help you in your journey [Music] they saw the plagues they saw the passover amen they saw the manner they received water from the rock hallelujah they saw all those external blessings now when god was given all these things is to be able to gather faith in a bracket for the main thing i want to tell the church this morning that as powerful as those things were that even elicited so much revival until sisters and brothers were singing the song of victory and it looks like every supernatural god heart he was pouring upon the church by which he put the fear of that church upon all the people around yet that was not the main blessing that didn't make them a peculiar treasure to god oh listen to me for your good church it didn't make them watch a peculiar treasure to god as god was settling down with those things god raised the stakes and it came with an ayah with a higher standard then he began to tell the church if indeed not by much because there's a generation that will pay leap service to the message there is a generation that will not go for you will see big banners and mighty signbots in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when it shall begin to sound and yet in the midst of that congregation the voice of the seventh angel will be so despised and hated who will deceive who here church you have been amped with the word of the lord if you fought for deception it is your fault you see mighty banners you see great imprints on bosses in the voice of the sadness of the seventh angel when it shall begin to sound and it is an aberration to even read one quotation of the prophets in the midst of such a congregation what is the voice of the seventh angel who is that voice friends don't pay lip service to the message of the hour whatever the word says amen must be an absolute must take your absolute consideration whatever the word says must be swallowed and accepted lying ook and sinker we have no better formula for redemption than that which the lord has given unto us you could enjoy your signs you could enjoy your wonders and yet your heart is far from the lord those are simple patterns even from the message of our lord jesus christ people followed him for signs and wonders for mighty miracles the bible declared at a point they ever wanted to make him king but you know what is the bible said he said all this great emotional outpouring is not because of his words but it's because of the miracles of bread and so on and so forth but there is a generation that is designed to move beyond these levels many we hence their journey in the wilderness we cannot help it but by the grace of god there's a generation that we go through i'm going through friends by stranger we go through no matter what comes no matter what goal i will go through [Applause] because if we cannot go through we have failed if we cannot go through we have not made it there will never be a second chance for a man who has heard the truth who has acknowledged it is the truth and refused to walk in the light of the truth it is an unpardonable sin that's what the word says [Applause] [Music] so make up your mind to serve the lord prepare to meet your lord so these people have enjoyed all those blessings till that very moment i want to drill this so hard so that you can see what is happening in your own day now but all the things they have enjoyed has not made them a peculiar treasure to god while we make them a peculiar treasure that god will do many mighty things for as he said in the book of exodus 19 is if indeed they will obey and follow his words we will obey and follow his conduct we will obey and follow his order we will obey and follow his doctrine [Applause] [Music] if there is nothing in us to do that oh you are fierce for handing it in the wilderness exodus 19. so it follows that the signs and wonders and all the mighty things attracted all kind of congregations it was the same thing in the second exodus and it is the same thing in the third exodus are you following me when the prophet was going around the world healing the sick doing mighty things outstanding great miracles such as have never been heard before except in the bible days amen they still urge the prophet today as the person that started the post-world war healing and revival by which the nations of the earth we are healed both in mind in body and in their spirits because the messenger by the ministry represented a new hope for a world that has been bedeviled by the effects of war thank god for the message of the hour thank god for sending a messenger thank god for brother abraham i am not ashamed to mention his name i mentioned apostle paul freely i mentioned prophet moses freely and i must mention brother brown freely if that is offensive oh my it shows you are prone to offence amen but you see all those things that he did they were just to attract a lot of people who we attracted we get stuck there they will never be able to move beyond that all some people asked today was god sent us brother abraham all some people have today is a water baptism in jesus name beyond that they can't go any further and it is in that father that there is actually redemption because the redemption of the last days will take you beyond the healing service ministry it will bring you to the abundant revelation of the world it is that revelation that can change you it is that revelation that can give you a true healing that can give you true conversion that can give you genuine salvation and i can plant your feet into the land of promise outside of that you cannot make it it is that revelation that will make you a peculiar treasure in other words it is that revelation that vindicates you as the hillage of the hour you will appreciate why i'm drawing this background shortly you love him [Music] now when they got to that place [Music] god told moses i called your attention to it in the scripture he said i'm going to come down in the thick cloud amen if you can put it on the on the screen for me i'm going to come down in the word thick clouds so clouds will be associated with this journey are you with me cloud will be associated with this journey fire will be associated with this journey and by the grace of god in these last days we have the witness of a cloud and we have the witness of the pillar of fire the pillar of fire brought them out the cloud will take them in the generations of the earth must understand this the pillar of fire will bring them out amen because in exodus chapter 3 he said i am come down amen and whom did i see whom did moses see he saw a bush that was burning and the leaves were not consumed amen that was the pillar of fire in the midst of the bush come down to do what he said i have heard the cry of my people and now i am come down for the purpose of what delivering them i am going to take them out amen at ohio river in 1933 the pillar of fire came down and he gave a commission amen of watch or for running of christ amen that which is aimed at bringing people out people cannot be brought out without some sort of signs and attraction and that was why moses asked the lord if i get to that place what do i say say i am the i am send you what will be the vindication that you sent me if they want to see something because moses knew people would want to see some vindication they would want to see some things and god began his vindication with his rod amen they saw signs of supernatural by the road because the road was given over to god it then god gave him two signs one by the road one by his arm and he said if they do not believe the voice of the first they will accept that of the second and from that road came many other mighty miracles and signs of wonder which really attracted the people that god must have been with this man because even though god came down it was not god himself that went to confront vero it was moses pharaoh saw hallelujah and the vessel of moses became a confusion to pharaoh he took the words of moses as the watch of a man instead of taking it as the words of god he didn't realize that moses felt the pillar of fire in these last days the messenger filled the pillar of fire to interpret the words to you it is the interpreted watch that will make you a peculiar treasure a holy priesthood a royal nation that will vindicate you as the seed of god when you have problem with that interpretation you are oh you are a wilderness man and many are wandering in the wilderness today that is why they were devising all kinds of programs in order to keep up alive but there is nothing that will sustain the believer than the revealed world it is the revival of the oblige [Music] so moses had all his first second pools but it is the church which is the opening of the wedge that would actually produce the treasure the first and the second pulse the mixed multitude and the real seat enjoyed it alike is it getting clear to you they all enjoyed the blessings but it's the blessings of the thought pool is eventually to sieve out of mixed multitude so that only the peculiar treasure makes its inside and that is the real redemption this is the reason the prophet said i want this easter to mean more to you than any other easter how many ever read that in the quotations it is the in the message it is the rising of the sun if you look at the topic of that message alone and you are spiritual you will realize that god was announcing the beginning of a new day because the horizon of the sun announces the beginning of a new day begins the beginning of a new dispensation or the beginning of a new economy are you following me so both the topic and the content for the spiritual mind means a great deal sometimes in order to enjoy the content you must have the revelation of the topic a new day was declared hallelujah just as it was for israel also a new day a new month the new season was declared and this declaration inside this declaration the prophet using this horizon of the sun to explain what is to the believer the easter we celebrate is not what the world does amen in fact the easter of the water become polluted and it has become commercial they don't even remember christ as such in the entire thing if they are fasting there is a commercial excellence they will advertise things that will help you retain your body nutrients so to the people of the world is for them to make money at such times amen and also to the church but to the believer islam means much more than that the prophet said for many years what we have been celebrating is the resurrection of the groom of the lord jesus christ but in the easter of 1965 he said i want to call you attention to another easter egg amen then they began to say the same watch that applies to the groom applies to the blight amen he said because the bride will be word of his words life of his life power of his power in fact she will be him so where the bible said he is risen he is not here i can safely say she is risen she is not here because the bride is part of the groom and if that took place for the groom the blood must also manifest each where was the blight dead in the blood was dead in denominations hallelujah there are so many blights in the denomination that will have their easter we all were once in that but because we carried the seed of election the signs and wonders were not enough to bring us out but this bride will hear the voice of the mama eagle and deep we call to the deep at the noise of the water spout and the real blood will not be comfortable again because when that deep cause makes the call he's going to ignite something in you was it igniting the seed of god once that seed is shaken and come alive amen it's like the dry bones of ezekiel the bible said the moment is caught life it never remained dry there was motion in progress there was thing there were things taking place it was progressing and progressing until it progressed to a statue to a point of a full-blown man radius and harmony [Applause] i don't know what this does to you believers but once that seed is struck life has begun you cannot stop life you cannot in their life let life be on the rock it will come out i've seen plantations come up on the rock i would happen i do not know but these are god's supernatural signs and evidences to show that life is unstoppable this life of god in us once ignited by the word of god my goodness you love him this morning so this church that has received so many abundant powers signs and wonders having been brought up by the pillar of fire need something to take care of them in the wilderness and beyond the wilderness it will be a permanent blessing to establish them and show them fought as a different people a royal priesthood a peculiar treasure among all the people of the earth these blessings came out of the clouds god said i will come down in a thick cloud amen lord i come unto thee the thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak within and do what and believe thee forever [Music] [Applause] we must believe this message for whatever because by the opening of the wedge it has the content to take your force throughout time and throw us into eternity this is why the prophet said that seven seal is like a rocket that drops air that drops there that drops there and drops there and what does it do again he said that seven seal is the end of time is the end of a struggling watch is the end of everything so as long as we are here waiting for eternity we shall be in the seventh seal amen and the seventh till it's a revelation designed to take care of you forever so we will that exodus church will have no alternative than the message of their hour oh they are not getting this you will have no alternative to the teaching of moses because god wanted to come down in a cloud to vindicate his servant and put him in a position that the church before him must believe him forever whether he is there or not moses didn't even live to enter into canaan physically he saw it but his feet never got in there are you catching it but something will survive moses amen it is not the presence of moses that will be blood will be important than the teaching the word moses brought amen so in the absence of moses the word must remain believed forever because it's got the content to take care of them all the way through the wilderness into the inheritance and establish them in their inheritance this was why when joshua came listen to me god want joshua he said this book of law i will tell you what came out of the cloud so you will appreciate it he said this book of law hallelujah must not depart from your mouth day and night you must meditate dearing church of the living god this message of the hour must not depart from your mouth must not depart from your family must not depart from your church you must meditate therein day and night till when till jesus comes there must not be an alternative to the message of the hour it follows the pattern of the biblical exodus that was the shadow this is the substance [Applause] do you see why it is difficult for us to leave off the message do you see why we must do everything by the message do you know why we must loyal to the message because it is the same commandment if club vindicated moses to be believed forever i want to tell you cloud has come again [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this cloud was not signs and wonders it wasn't the festival it wasn't the second pro it wasn't an healing service it was the revealed world that was why before the cloud took place god won the church amen if you will indeed do you know friends when the prophet or our lord jesus christ was having the ministry of healing service the signs and wonders do you know it gathered all kind of congregations do you know everybody was attracted to each i've shown you that of jesus our lord in the bible how about that of the prophet a lot of people were attracted to him the full gospel the united pentecostal the oneness the assemblies the foursquare and many other mighty assemblies of god mighty denominations they were the one who sponsored them around the world seven times you know why because the message then they can manage it because then it wasn't much of the message that was the measure it was the attraction of the signs and wonders are you catching it but that could take care of denominations that cannot take care of the seed it could attract the seeds to come close but the seed needs something more for his own redemption for his own body change for his own conversion for his own deliverance this is what the prophet said the evidence that you have the holy ghost is that you have the ability to follow the watch to the storehouse all the way through amen many had had a claim that they have the holy spirit before the opening of the wedge the evidence that they truly have the spirit is their ability to follow the wage completely in conduct in order in doctrine if they cannot do it he put a question mark on their conversion this must not be the opinion of man this was what the prophet said at the opening of the word you got no thought coming it is no longer your faith in the son of god but you will live by the faith of the son of god the conviction of the son of god the belief of the son of god the revelation of the son of god because you've denied your own thinking you have no more opinion in this matter you only want to think what god says and nothing more this is how we are delivered to church we were attracted like the others amen it's like a fisherman's bait you get that the fisherman threw the night in the water amen what attracted the fishes and all kinds of water things crabs and all kinds of things is not the net is the bait in the niche are you catching it the is always nice and attractive sweet smelling hallelujah but you see when they are attracted they all come into the ledge but is the fisherman interested in all sick creatures no sir the people he really wanted is fish he is not a crab man he is a fisherman so when they pull out his net what does he do he separates hallelujah so the message of separation is what came in exodus 19. the message of separation today is the tadpole is the opening of the word and it came from the cloud until that moment the real bride is not identified do you know up till this moment you don't know who is who it was after the giving of the message that some people began to become obvious date and quran and aberrant became obvious it was at the giving of the message that you realize that some people can still come up with golden calves are you here it's after that you realize that after two years of journey some people are still ready to go back two years backwards instead of two weeks forward into the inheritance as a matter of fact they began to look for a captain to take them back to egypt it was after this exodus 19 that you saw some elders who brought evil reports you will never know there's a congregation like that you will never know that there are no men like that great preachers like that who could preach just one service in few hours and convert the entire church into worldliness and convert the entire church into egypt so much inspiration until people were ready to look for a captain to take them back to egypt after two years journey to kadesh bernier exodus 19 is very important do not play with the message of the hour if you don't have a conviction of it you better go on your knees pray for revelation if you take everything and you become a cesspool something is wrong watch this church i will come onto the in a thick cloud and what did he do he told the folks is that moses tell the people this is my plan so god gave it in advance so it looks like a what a prophecy there's going to be a mighty visitation a mighty blasting so rocky so tremendous it will shake everywhere prepare the mind of the people didn't god told william brown to prepare our mind are you spiritual he told him to bring a message says is this the time it was a message to prepare our mind for the visitation of the cloud in the message is this the time the prophet said i saw a terrible blast are we together he said this blast was so rocky until the prophet thought it was the end of his life and brother brown began to guess many things that blas could be could it mean this could it mean that could mean the other why which why would there be such a concern because it is coming to a need to edge point for the church at that hour it is coming to such a point a pointed edge a thin razor hedge that is difficult to stand and maintain your balance without a supernatural end holding you forth it is coming to the edge of the cliff but most of what the prophet thought it could mean it never meant because god held it in his chest hallelujah but as he told moses in exodus 19 to prepare the art of the people he also told willie abraham to prepare the heart of his people even william brown prepared his house he told his wife that he believes this he gave a valedictory message and now she should leave her life and cope with the children after he is gone i think sister meadows saw a lot in life no wonder she grew gray healthier than a time oh my god so much pressure from the ministry but you see what the prophet never realized was that it was meant to be a change of the ministry it was meant to be a time to be giving commission and a vindication that the people might believe him forever up to that time the message of the hour wasn't perfected listen to me church up to that moment that the prophet was preaching that says is this the time the message of the hour wasn't perfected i am not one of those who will tell you to throw away the messages before 1963. are you listening to me god uses prophet all the time but india before 1963 the prophet said still there were things that we guessed art amen in other words there were things we guessed at we've not had the absolute truth of it [Applause] it's not because the ministry has problem it's because the program of god must run like that to bring it to perfection and those were the seasons we even called the white house rider the lord jesus christ because in those times we were also appealing to the great teachings of theologians like uriah smith to understand some facts of the bible are you catching it amen but it doesn't mean there were not many blessings that came by inspiration at that time but the prophet was an honest messenger while he was waiting for the truth of many things he said we guessed at some things which we believe we are so right and that was why he said when those angels came down the things they gave me came better than my personal understanding and judgment and he said that makes my bible a new book in my hand we must appreciate that we must realize that that the cloud experience is important to our redemption it's important to our perfection is important to bringing us to full stature because it was by the cloud that we received our full resurrection what is easter easter is a resurrection and the prophet said this easter what it means to us is that it is not the easter of the groom again it is the easter of the blight that has been resurrected out of what dark dead denominationalism into the glorious age we have been taken out of the wilderness into our inheritance into our land of promise into our homeland into our spiritual canon which is not heaven but the heads into the dispensation of the open world into the age of the bride where we could feed on things that we have been given by the clouds so don't get stuck church of the living god don't stop there because the prophet never stopped there when you say things like this it annoys the people and you get annoyed maybe because you're a generation that must get stalked am i not coaching the prophet it is the prophet i'm coaching the prophet came to a junction in as i was with moses is he said either to where we have gotten we've gotten to jordan amen how many ever read that isabel you see the inheritance of some people were given before jordan amen two and half tribes got their inheritance before jordan do you realize that but there's a generation that the inheritance is across jordan amen i am part of that generation pentecostal got their blessings before jordan because laudacian h is in twofold the pentecostal age of laodicea and for the believer the blind age of laudacia my inheritance is not in that period is not in the era of the healing service something in me tells me that there is a greater blessing and that is exactly what he told the prophet is that there is something more than this there is something more than water baptism in jesus name amen amen after water baptism if we truly receive the spirit it should give an hunger for something greater and the prophet says something tells me my inheritance is across jordan he said as many as feels that way come over with me let us cross this jordan so jordan means death that means we are going to pass through the death die to the things of the world die to the church die to creeds die to dogma and be resurrected out of denominationalism into the glorious age of the blood of jesus christ [Music] where our opinion no longer counts we are our beliefs no longer count it is the word and the word alone where we say be eaten to me according to your words we are every man's word is a lie and only the word of god be the truth glory to god [Applause] this is exactly where this brethren were in exodus chapter 19. in one church the lord actually descended amen the bible said it descended in a world thick cloud when it descended it descended as a pillar of fire into the clouds and there were smokes everywhere there were blastings there were rockings everywhere but it didn't consume moses moses of 33 bird brahms for 33 years a fellowship with a pillar of fire he never got used to it amen every experience leaves him shaken amen but it never consumed him oh glory to god this pillar of our message only consumes sin it consumes hypocrisy he consumes unrighteousness he consumes indifference it consumes prejudice it consumes complex it comes in fornication it consumes adultery it consumes lying it consumes all works of the flesh it exposes them it drives them out from the camp of the believers but it attracts holiness purity joy faith long suffering loving kindness blessings unspeakable [Applause] you love him this morning so friends he actually came down and when he came down he told moses set boundary before he came inside set boundary there's a limit to which the five-fold goes in this matter the people who we attracted to come within the range of the boundary were not of ordinary people they were all priests he said tell them to come amen and some renowned people is about you and aaron come up a bit higher because aaron is the high priest a type of the lord jesus christ amen so figuratively the high priest the lord jesus christ is the one that takes moses into the cloud of himself are you catching it all right then moses got to a range he entered into the cloud what is this cloud experience for this is what is important to me it was in the cloud of exodus 19 that god gave the message of that hour did you hear me i better read something here to prove that to establish that to you you love him church it was in that cloud that the message of that hour came the prophet calls the message that came from that cloud as the seals this is what i wanted to be patient to read if you can bear with me let's read in the message the unveiling of god paragraph 299 the unveiling of god 1964 14th of june the prophet said and think of it the same pillar of fire that come upon those men that wrote the bible is the same pillar of fire here today inter preaching the bible amen are we thank him for that same what a comfort what identification i'm so glad to be identified in that i don't know what to do i would rather be identified in that than all the baptists methodists presbyterian lutheran and all the rest of them identified in death where the shekinah glory and revelation lays [Applause] [Music] amen the pillar of fire appearing visibly among us identifying that the message is right like it did at mount sinai mancine is exodus 19 20 dear from is that right like it did we're on mount sinai remember watch this before the true message come forth moses preached and let them out of egypt are you spiritual [Applause] can you beam it on it before the true message oh remember before the true message come forth moses preached and he led them out of egypt so the message of that exodus hadn't come when moses led them out of egypt what did they leave them by he left them by instructions by signs and by wonders the healing service the first pool the second poll he brought them hard by each amen but certainly those two pools cannot take them into the promise and keep them in their land of inheritance you catch an age now listen he said but there before the real commandment was laid down what did he call the real commandment the seals was brought in so the first exodus at their seals oh church oh bride of jesus christ the first product had their seals before the seals was brought down what did god do god came down before the people and proof that moses was sent from him isn't that the scripture we have reached amen he said behold i come down in what thick clouds that i may prove you before the people and the people might believe you forever so you will agree i'm not preaching outside of the message of the hour are you catching it you must understand the program of your own easter you must understand the program of your own redemption amen god in the message christ is the mystery of god reveal the prophet said everything god wanted to do he has shown its truth types and shadows throughout the entire scriptures he said i'm proof that moses was sent from him in a pillar of fire that moses said he had seen in a bush and talked to him so that same pillar of fire of exodus 3 came upon the mountain in a thick cloud so moses entered into the cloud to fellowship with the pillar of fire and what was the product outcome of the fellowship the giving of the true message for that hour the seals of that hour that we put legitimacy to everything moses had spoken about from the beginning till the end even beyond moses it will make it so true unto them until after moses leaves they will keep believing it they will keep saying moses said that was what joshua couldn't but said moses said he even divided the land by moses search common church why you are not with brahms search can you ever get into your inheritance without brahms saying your problem is that you think it was the watch of willie abraham willem brown was a man but god god came through him evade god to interpret the word the interpretation is sure and the message it brought is correct and it was until it was not until that time that everything mercy said was certified by god it was the open seals that satisfied the entire message to us as the perfect truth because when the sins became open things we need to pull back upon to adjust to correct to put in a better light we did that is not my watch that is the watch of the prophet he went back and touched correctly the 70 weeks of daniel it brought the truth of marriage and divorce correctly he went back into the for us riders and showed to us that this ride that white house rather is not christ is satan in his deceptive form [Applause] so we need the cloud to certify the entire message so that we can believe it forever so the price will not be perfected by signs and wonders their redemption is not that it only attracted them to see what is going on when they came around then the true message of perfection was given and that is why we hold tenaciously today to what the word says it might be instruction it might be cancer even if it's an advice [Music] everything paul said he told the church is that all scripture was given by watch by inspiration and it's profitable amen including that which paul said this is i not the lord it form part of our scripture if any man took it for his opinion and disobeyed it oh god you will incur the wrath of god so whether it's a decision not the lord or he said that which i received from the lord it form part of all scripture that supersede your opinion that supersede your belief that you must accept it that you must accept because moses was vindicated by god to be believed forever [Applause] if that was what happened in the first exodus let's see our exodus you are happy you didn't take offense with the first one don't take offense with the last one you are the generation that will not take offense because you are not prone to offense you are prone to believing blessed are those who are not offended have i shown you a pattern have i shown you the program of god have i proven from the scripture as a prophet gradually not be bringing it to our day let's follow him he told us that what moses got the true message he got after a mighty revival was what was the seals and that seals were the ten commandments and the expansion of it into over 600 ordinances and statutes do you know even the building of the tabernacle this specification they were all given in that fellowship moses never came down until 40 years brethren 40 days brethren so it wasn't a small time fellowship it was a real fellowship without food without water being taken care of supernaturally in the realms of glory bride we are no man we are not fivefold could approach untrue [Applause] you love him then here we come in this last exodus which was to be the substance the great signs and wonders and supernaturals have also taken us far until 1962. glory to god somewhere around 1962 the god told the prophet by a vision to forewarn the church because he saw a vision of a blast that's what says is the time was all about the prophet left it finished that message presuming he couldn't bring you exactly what the blast means he gave many postulations but you see if god gives a sound it's got to be certain amen so all that taught the prophet was to wait for god's appointed time when he will reveal the certainty of all that he had seen you love him then in february 1963 four to six months later just what he saw in the vision like in picking a boss from all of his trousers before witnesses like genuine and fred sotman if i have the names right amen fred suttman if i have their names right then he saw circling some white something circling down and they turned out to be angels amen february 1963 you can even i'm going to read few things about that cloud it is important i do because if the cloud that god came down god's intention by it was to make people believe moses forever then we must certify that the cloud that we receive is genuine otherwise our soul and our life lang hangs in the balance because today we see a lot of generation of people generation of mixed multitudes i have no apology for saying that that are coming up with contradictions battling at the mystery cloud i want to take the battle back to them this morning [Music] but we are not going to be vulgar we'll prove it with facts i've taken it from scriptural points tracing it for you church is that right do i have the witness that we have seen it from the scripture and do i have the witness that the prophet is beginning to connect it to what happened in our day is that moses brought them that far but the true message that will take care of them in that exodus hasn't been given yet oh glory to god and they call that message the seals my goodness how else could the world be this plane he called it the seals so the first exodus had their sales that took care of them in the journey that showed them the tabernacle specification you aren't going to come to full stature today in this spiritual temple god is building without the seals the earlier you start embracing the messages that came out of the experience of the seals the better it is for your life your stature is not what you are going to walk yourself into your stature is a message the prophet in the message touch of a perfect man he said when he say heart he doesn't mean it like literally like that it's a quotation the addition is you taking more of the wage and more of the world begin to blossom in your life this is your easter church of the living god what we release the materials is the seals amen so instead of looking for materials look for the seals when you see what the seals unfolded into and you embracing the revelation that came out of the seals automatically the material is building in your life church the program couldn't be more planar from the commandments that was given came several ordinances and statutes there are from their experience came the building of the tabernacle in the wilderness came all the specification came even the specification of the levites and the levitical orders and the priesthood even to their government to their services and to their offerings one encounter moses got everything complete before it came back that the people might believe in what forever so everybody adds their portion so this encounter of the prophet with the cloud is important for us because india leaves everything complete to put perfection on the messages before them and what we will do after then [Applause] [Music] so what did you see it's a seven ninjas came down while in that circle like a light and when they came down they took him up in the pyramid of themselves amen because it was high up that moses got the revelation from so they took him the prophet said the revelation of the word only known to them so is god of fellowship in the midst of those angels in order to get the words the message the true message as the bible said for that hour in our own exodus [Music] and this was i when they brought him back after the encounter how long it was i don't know they brought him back with the church to go back where east he was in the west arizona where he had that experience they said go back it's jeffersonville to go and declare a new day and he went back and for seven nights he was having angelic visitation to do what to open the seals which you get the church of the living god that was what is edge that was what happened and this experience came out of where it came out of the cloud when these angels were going back they formed a cloud a ring of mystery let me read what people said this is not message of the hour this was which you can google yourself this was an account amen of witnesses that have been passed down from generation to generation i have the original look magazine that carried this may 17 19 edition of 1963 i have it in my house the original magazine that carried that event now i was going through such google or what you call it to even see if in the internet if on the search i would see anything like that so i searched mystery cloud in history and they brought out ten and out of the ten this one was number five on number six in the ascending what you call it indeed in the order of events that has happened and this is what they said about the ring of mystery in the closing hours of february you can go through this in the wonderlist wonderlist.com it is not a message website amen it is just people who are gathering facts of history they said in the closing hours of february 1963 the residents of arizona are reported to have seen a mysterious cloud formations that in scientific time defied all rational explanation [Music] i'm coming for backsliders who are attacking this cloud but i told you i will bring my case in the most humble only way we are not going to go vulgar like they have done we are not of the same material but no amount of vulgarity and attack can take this blessing from us every article of redemption in every exodus had always come under attack they attacked the red sea they said it never happened it was just a dry land a bunch of reeds that moses you know took people through friends they attacked they attacked uh they also attacked once again they also attacked the virgin birth of jesus christ they said it was not virgin born the day they attacked that and 500 preachers denied virgin birth it wouldn't change my position on virgin birth if you take the red sea out of the experience of the fair excess with us that means they never came out there was no redemption if you take the clouds out of that experience that means they never entered into anywhere else because nothing to take care of them so if you take the virgin birth out of redemption in the second exodus no redemption for you no redemption for me if you take the clouds out of these last days it shows we are not better than denominations but it was from the cloud that we received the message that separated us as a peculiar treasure as a holy people that proved to us that we are the jin siege father spiritual gene that gave us the open word you can't take it from us regardless of what you say thank you for putting it on the board let's read it together this is not message people this is just ordinary people gathering fact of history this archaeology work amen we are not following the conley device people church of the living god if you are still having doubts and the message having come this far there is little hope for you listen to me he said divide all rational explanation [Music] the cloud was reported to be 48 kilometers that is 30 miles across white it was such a large that was why it stretches from tucson to phoenix into mexico that was how why they could see it from mexico because it was so high also so why i'm 41 kilometer 26 miles high in the bright dark cloudless sky according to witness the clouds suddenly appeared to have been drawn by an unseen entity [Music] hey i'm coming for you backsliders who are saying this is the smoke of aeroplane i'm going to prove it by science and i'm going to prove it by fact of history just give me a few minutes by fact of history that you are a liar you are a backslider and you are a blasphemer [Music] don't keep company with these folks unless you partake in their sin some of you are having sympathy for them for whatever reason don't be a partaker of their sin let their sin be only upon their head let me say one thing categorically clear brother the lord jesus said i did things and you call it beautiful he said i will forgive you for it he said but the spirit of truth when he returns in the last days and he do it does things one word against age will never be forgiven on this earth or in the world to come those of you who entered into the military and think that your ministry can only survive by attacking the prophet or the message of the hour oh i i pity your ministry i pity you oh i feel for you i feel for your destruction because it will come i'm not crossing i'm speaking the truth every i do watch the bible said against the spirit will not be forgiven be very very careful who you accompany with who you keep friendship with friendship must not be at all cause are you listening to me cause behind the friendship where the word of god is at stake [Applause] [Music] [Applause] these are ordinary men testifying these are not christians they said according to witnesses people who saw that thing they said the cloud suddenly appeared to have been drawn by an unseen entity so it wasn't like a graduate and it's forming could only seven ninjas have done that did you catch that all of a sudden they just saw it oh glory by an unseen entity and was visible for several minutes smoke disappears smoke have no retention smoke are like vapor they move away very fast hallelujah but this one stayed so it formed for several minutes to leave a witness to this art that god came in the thickness of a cloud to prove his messenger that we might believe what he brought forever as john the baptist was sent to forum the first coming of christ you are sent with a message that we for on his second coming until he physically appears in the sky to take his children home we must believe the message forever [Applause] listen courier citizens immediately flooded the university of arizona institute of atmospheric physics for answers but the scientists were amateurs as well [Applause] didn't the prophet said they were looking for answers did you not read it on the pages of the message so did the prophet tell a lie he told the truth amen if he said this way if he said that way it was intentional in order to take care of those who are prone to offence but the believers are not prone to offence some people we are saying he said it was there on that day when it appeared why and it was not there the first public comment of the prophet on this thing message of come follow me is a distance upon either two days before or two days after i was there then in the standing of the gap when he has done his research to know when he said these things happened when the angels who came down we are going back how long it took them to go back and flood that thing and keep their visibility it's up to him amen what is that right under where that thing appeared was where we were two days before so where did this say that it was there when it was happening it is the way you were reading it you never read with revelation i challenge you to bring it where he said so he said i was under it amen under it meaning we are nothing up here when they draw the geographical location of where the prophet stood with the angels it was right under it but you see if you have prone to offense and if you are pro to contention every little little thing got that momentum for you he said this it does this it because you are just looking for fault you are seeking location many of you have contentious spirits it's a demon you pick at words the prophet said take me for what i mean not sometimes what i say it's still a quotation of the wage [Music] [Applause] but this is another thing that intrigued me the article writer said unsurprisingly in other words without surprise a tele evangelist called and confessed to have been visited by seven angels who made the cloud as they flew back to their heavenly approach did you hear that amen because they couldn't explain amen the rate at which this thing formed because they couldn't explain the height at which this thing is they couldn't explain the whiteness of this thing it was beyond scientific explanation when somebody now offered a clue they said they are not surprised in other words they accepted it as a supernatural occurrence we are in backsliders i am not done yet amen i am not done yes i want to bring another one they told you some of you dock your hedge on the internet they told you you see he said i'm trying to listen to many so that i can take my opinion let me tell you who are the people to form an opinion on the prophet for you who is the backslider that we form an opinion on the prophet are you okay what is their call what is your vindication why are you touched on through why isn't there anything that's settled it for you amen could it be the messenger wasn't sent to you so doesn't vote for whom he sends they don't doubt they don't look for anybody to validate the prophets no no no no no no no no no no no the validation of the prophet comes from god and i'm showing you his validation even in exodus 19 the prophet said throughout the entire bible i can show you the seventh seal here is it brethren i've debunked it for you he never said it was there the same day they took the picture i've debunked that for you say that two days before two days after first public comment later on it said it was the angels that formed when they were going back after their message amen to which to which wonderlist.com amen history researchers attested to they said the tele evangelists said this was what happened they are not surprised because that event was too supernatural for it to have any other explanation apart from that science couldn't explain it think about that for a minute then latter day backsliders are coming to tell you it is a smoke of aeroplane i want to bring another fact when they cut this morning hallelujah how many enjoy in this court session i'm bringing another fact now this is from time magazine for me to have a position because if the prophet told me that i'm in exodus 19 amen that's exactly what he was saying that i'm in exodus 19 by the mystery cloud then i must be sure what came out of there i could put my life my entire bet on it now backsliders have come to tell us that it is the smoke of aeroplanes is that right whereas in the message the prophet said it was beyond the height of aeroplane how many ever read it in the message he said it was beyond the height of where a plane could fly and even till today i want to proceed i want to submit that it is still beyond the height of aeroplane despite our advancements i went back to do a research how i do planes actually fly in the 50s and here is what i found i would like to read a little amen oh we have to enjoy this a little over 42 000 planes take flight in the u.s every day with 5000 in the sky at any given time according to the federal aviation administration coordinating the many arrivals departures and okay here is what to know about how i plane really fly listen to this church one reason that planes cruise above the clouds is so they can fly fast the higher airplanes climb the thinner the air gets and the more efficiently they can fly because of less resistance in the atmosphere with these larger jets when they take off from the airport their first job is essentially to get out and get as high as possible as quickly as possible commercial aircraft typically typically fly between 31 000 to 28 000 feet today those of you who have bordered planes traveling overseas can attest to that they don't go past that and that is just about 5.9 to 7.2 miles today i and usually reach their cruising altitude in the first 10 minutes of a flight a cut of a flight planes can fly much higher than this altitude but that can present safety issues flying aya means it will take a long time to return to a self-altitude in case of an emergency like rapid decompression it also isn't the most efficient use of well to fly that eye in the first place he said since planes can fly at a lower altitude with the assistance of wind are we together i want you to continue reading that later i will give you decide i want to see in 1958 they told us in the 50s that planes don't fly beyond 19 000 feet which is less than four miles history said so that it was in 1958 they introduced jet and concord who could fly a little higher than that and they don't go past 38 000 feet they haven't shown up in history which one went past 40 000 except you are doing rocket launching or something like that are you here with me now for a smoke to form today it will form around 38 000 feet which is like 7.2 miles of line but do you know what they said we had this the height of this cloud 26 miles i the cloud was higher than the height of a plane by about four times that is about 123 000 feet so where will it become a smoke of an aeroplane and even at this time we are saying is researched as that before 1958 no plane flies higher than nineteen thousand feet which is less than four miles but the cloud formed at 26 miles eye do you see why science said they become and they became an amateur to explain what happened they found no answers it defied all logic so can you get it out of your head backsliders and blasphemous that this cloud i'm seeing here is not a smoke of an airplane the smoke cannot set and retain itself on the same spot in thickness for several minutes it is your box living condition inspired by satan in your heart amen that makes you talk ill of a god-given vindication to prove his servant forever that we might believe the words that he gave forever [Applause] [Music] but we see every falsehood we have sympathizers god has allowed us to take care of some people but not us [Music] [Applause] no matter the level of opposition the believer is moving on the prophet foretold it before it happened amen god won the church we saw the warning in exodus 19 so as to prepare for the event amen and the prophet said the events they were being worked for is to bring the true message of that exodus and from the cloud came the ten commandments came the ordinances six hundred and something ordinances from the cloud came the levitical orders from the cloud came the specification of the tabernacle the building plan and all the materials that we go into it to build a total message for a perfect exodus thanks be to god let's see what came back from the clouds let's see what came up from this cloud that they are trying to deny us off are you ready to see what came out from the cloud you will see why the devil is fighting the clouds and why the people are yielding themselves amen as a servant to satan amen you love the lord you love the lord if you love him rejoice in him oh glory to god [Applause] in the message that third eggs with us let's start from here i'm winding down now but you must get this amen in the message he told exodus the prophet said paragraph 265 the second exodus he brought a prophet anointage which was his son god prophet moses said he would be a prophet and hurt the pillar of fire and done signs and wonders and that same prophet said whosoever believeth in me the works that i do will he do also and here he promised the same thing in the exodus in the last days and they cannot change it and by scientific proof by the witness of the spirit by the works of the spirit we see it today the great pillar of fire moving among us and the signs and wonders and of the resurrection of jesus christ calling the people from denominationalism into the presence of jesus christ to live going to a land there's there's no mistake friends amen it's not what i'm saying i'm just your brother but it's what god is proving to you what makes it the truth same pillar of fire he used for the other two is brought it among you today and prove it by scientific as you know life magazine packed it last month over there how many was there and heard me tell about that what happened before it did i think about everyone in the church there it is is coming to the cloud again they don't know what it is all about the science are trying to did we read it now did we read their research amen anybody got a picture of it according a cloud we have it here 26 miles yeah i in the shape of a pyramid seven ninjas represent in there brought back and brought you the word of what did they bring you the message of the hour they brought you the seals just as they brought moses the seals for his own day under the inspiration he tells you these hours that you are coming and living in this spiritual mind we pick that right now and get it what is it it is on it is an so what called out our exodus the ring of mystery god came down in a thick cloud to give us the message of exodus the prophet said the mystery cloud is an exodus it's an exodus calling out oh come on church let's get one more before we go if he causes the word of god what words did he give what what did he give this day the scripture is fulfilled 29th february 1965 paragraph beginning from paragraph 176 what watch did he give us if he gave us the seals what war did he give us amen what are the contents of the seals amen i'm going to read it for you he helped us to know who satan is the white house rider is that right he helped us to know this the the the radar's rider he helped us to know the black horse rider we know what they paid us right there we know souls under the altar oh friends we know the tribulation judgment we know all the wars and the epidemics and the pandemics we are loosed under the sixth seal and all the calamities that are befalling man came under the sixth seal then he also told us the seventh seal and he said the fault of it is the seven thunders so the seven thunders revelation came out of where came out of the thick cloud divinely revealed mystery truth that we do a literal work of changing us let us see the unfolding contents amen i've given part of the content let the prophet give the rest okay why they are looking for that paragraph one sum of the six this day the scripture is fulfilled he said that morning when those seven angels come down amen and blasted the earth did they bless the earth they blasted the earth amen and rocks flew everywhere just exactly as it happened in exodus 19. you know when it happened in exodus 19 do you know god achieved his name do you know what the people said after the encounter they said god don't speak to us is that right church are we together the saints in the world he said they said god don't speak to us directly let moses speak to us because they found the voltage too high for them to absorb and any voltage that comes from a power generation center is always too high for any man to absorb are you following me this is why they give you transformers on your streets or in your houses in other words the transformer absorbs the voltage and steps it down and begin to regulate it and give it in the content that you are able to receive that transformer is the messenger of the howard the prophet of god who absorbed of the energy of the voltage who kept some truth until you arrived to receive it he knew marriage and divorce two years before he preached it he said if we preach it earlier it will it will destroy it with scatter god keep those things in that attend vessel and they preserve it there until the people have matured to be able to accept it we thank god for our transformer that is given in to us in regulated content so that our houses our temple is not destroyed by what was sent to redeem you and her the people never wanted to hear god directly again they said let god speak only to moses and you moses speak to us what was god's intention to achieve that he said that they might listen to you and hear you forever that money when those seven ninjas come down and blasted the earth and rock flew every way seven ninjas two there and said return back to jeffersonville hallelujah from where you come from for the world for the seven seals of the seven mysteries will be opened oh hallelujah here we are today church here we are today understanding serpents so the full revelation of servancy never came in 1958 it ran through to the opening of the seals here we are today understanding seven seals in few days if god willing we will understand the correctness of marriage and divorce things you need to teach the church to place it positionally not by your touch your church tradition objection or sense but by the revealed world to build a total church a total people who will know how to approach every situation but the council of the world you are ignoring that and chasing shadows you ain't going to walk anybody up to come to full stature these are the things that we bring them to that statue the supernatural ingredients that came from the cloud and all these things amen that god has opened every seal the mystery since the foundation ah bring it up church since the foundation of the world and we've been enjoying the presence of his blessings that is true this day this scripture is fulfilled hallelujah is that what it says is that what he said is that what we said god bless you let me get one more and we can close on that amen that is our own deliverance that is our own redemption that is our elongation was preserved walking upon the atoms of our body that gives us answer to every devil's questions he said the entire seals have been opened and the bible has perfectly been revealed for those who can see if you can see it this is it amen and that is your redemption that is your salvation this is your deliverance church amen brother brahm called it he called it the little stone amen i'm trying to see if i could get there okay let's continue reading this one ah let's continue reading it there's a blessing here come on come on i've not even finished it this day this scripture is fulfilled paragraph now we started from paragraph 17 this is let's move to 179 we reach 178. let's read on brother fred sutman and brother gene norman and i standing there witnesses three is a witness amen what was god doing to moses on exodus 19 he was adopting his messenger to a position of hearing him that they might believe him for [Applause] did he do that to our lord jesus christ in the second exodus in the third exodus it must be the same thing so what was taking place among sunsets another abduction him said this is why he took witnesses amen tree is a witness like at the top like at up on the top of the mountain peter james and john is the prophet saying it himself don't be skeptical accept the review word forgive witness stood there and watched it when it happened and seen it done there it is hanging in the sky you see it again so far there is no humidity no moisture or nothing to make a fog how could they come there it was the angels of god returning back after their message this day that prophecy has been fulfilled in our midst this day this scripture has been fulfilled watch seven seals has been opened the one wind is to the west coast now don't miss it like they did back yonder don't miss it like they did back yonder do you know god also vindicated this not by just the vision of the blast in sas is this the time he also vindicated it by junior jackson's dream some say he didn't have the dream some say he didn't how why did you wait for junior jackson to pass away before you start speaking nonsense where was junior jackson when the prophet was referring to him or are there all rebellious collaborators or forcefuls oh you are a backslider for speaking tomiroz for speaking nonsense you are filling up the cup of your fathers generation of mixed multitudes hallelujah i close with junior jackson do you know jackson saw a period media stone amen on that many things we were written on age and brethren gathered and the prophet was fellowshipping around those things and everybody was rejoicing amen and when they were settling down thinking that was all of it the prophet took a crowbar to do what knock off the edge and inside that thing which is inside brother brother connected it to the opening of the entire thing is there in the pages of the world it said that inside was revealed a stone looking so innocent and precious as if no light has ever flashed upon it initially thought it was something outside the bible amen but the spirit of the lord came to correct him that no revelation could come outside of the word then he realized that it was the truth in the bible upon which nobody has attempted to bring revelation did you catch his church and he told the generation that we're with him to do what [Music] to watch and look on this until he does watch until he comes back and he started going what west are you catching it west was sunset was where oh hallelujah west was where we have the encounter with the angels in order to bring the thick cloud and as it was going i want to show you something as i close west was where he had that encounter with the angels amen he was going up down the hill down the hill until he disappeared when he disappeared the people are told to look started looking away with a corner eye and they begin to ask themselves how far is he where is he gone what is it doing until a whole lot of them many did watch many left many thunder away and disobeyed the instruction are you catching it when they disobeyed the instruction the prophet said they left that place with their private interpretation of what they thought that meant they never waited for the messenger to return to bring the truth of age listen to me church watch it carefully now years later the prophet referred back to that dream and he said many people have begin to say things and teach things today that i am not responsible for he said do you remember junior's jackson dream when i told them to wait they were coming up with theories and great interpretations that looked like it but it was not exactly it and the only thing it succeeded in doing is to arrest giants again a generation of old fighters who started posse lighting and making denominations out of the message of the hour knowing that the message cannot be denominated they unconsciously and deceptively took people out of the message when they thought they went the message if you have ever been caught in such error your redemption is to throw away those opinions and come and embrace the message and start all over [Applause] then the prophet said do you remember the golden calf scream do you know before moses came out of the cloud there was a generation that said as for these moses we don't know what has become of him and they used the force of jezebelism to intimidate the high priest to submission to do what to erect a golden calf those things are shadows they are playing out perfectly today hallelujah and until and i present the old israelite your god that took you brought you out of egypt this is why people became high dogs today amen people can die for their pastors even if it's contrary to the message because as far as they are concerned he is the one that has the understanding of the message there is no private interpretation or private understanding to this it is true we shall make more sense to it that is the job of the fight for about not one person god will give grace here he will give grace here it will give grace here stretch of the living god you must raise your heads above the fanaticism of this revival to be a peculiar treasure take the message in its simplicity the seals have been opened the entire world has been revealed feed on these eternal things it will change you from glory to glory and present you as a total masterpiece a full stature that is your history that is your deliverance that is your resurrection that is your blessing resurrected out of that dead denominationalism both perseveration and general denomination addition and suppression is denomination try it out and take the message in its purity god bless you [Music]
