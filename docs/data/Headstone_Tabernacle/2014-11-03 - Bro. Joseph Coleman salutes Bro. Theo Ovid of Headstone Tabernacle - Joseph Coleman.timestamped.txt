[0:04] greetings to my precious friend and
[0:10] brother on the feel of it is wisest
[0:14] Amory
[0:15] and their precious family and all the
[0:19] elders deacons helps his stone
[0:25] tabernacle Trinidad that it has part in
[0:33] this appreciation to our precious
[0:37] brother
[0:38] behold the father says honor to whom his
[0:42] honor and misurkin
[0:46] take this time out to honor our brother
[0:49] and brother Michael my male asked me to
[0:54] say a few words and so for me it's a
[1:00] privilege to say a few words today
[1:02] half-brother feel so but I would like to
[1:06] invite you tension to st. John 13 verse
[1:12] 20 and I'll read it verily verily I say
[1:18] unto you he that receiveth whomsoever I
[1:23] sin receiveth me and he that receiveth
[1:27] me receiveth him that sent me
[1:30] may the Lord of the blessing to the
[1:32] reno's war brother Theo
[1:43] well first maybe they read backward
[1:47] brother Brown said about this first
[1:51] scripture st. John 13 2007 to you
[1:58] he receives himself I send it sees me he
[2:02] never sees matrices him that sent me
[2:05] no I'm reading from a spoken word his
[2:08] original seed volume 3 number 2 page 53
[2:12] and Jesus said he never sees them that I
[2:16] sin perceives me and now them that he
[2:20] sent and them that receives me raise him
[2:25] receives him that sent me wish we had
[2:29] time to laying on that now notice you
[2:34] can only serve God as you as you can
[2:39] only serve God as you do and believe the
[2:44] servants that God sent you the only sort
[2:49] of God on earth see as God's servants
[2:52] that set on earth by divine inspiration
[2:57] interprets the word to you so therefore
[3:02] I believe it's self-explanatory
[3:06] it is a reveal word from the spoken word
[3:10] and of course we own all the prophet
[3:12] interpreted and so therefore I believe
[3:15] that to the headstone Tabernacle or that
[3:19] your pastor for the field is a man with
[3:26] divine inspiration for you look around
[3:31] the world and we knew for years that
[3:33] they would not be many that would have
[3:37] divine inspiration and I've been known
[3:39] as for years because brother Brennan has
[3:42] said so so that's why I need me such a
[3:45] privilege to know over the field brother
[3:50] Michael Mike mail brought in to me
[3:52] it was 1981 and Harris and he told me
[4:00] that brother feels a man that has a
[4:04] revelation of loving-kindness so when I
[4:08] heard that while I was very happy they
[4:11] have breakfast they'll be the world
[4:13] lunch and they sit with him and talk
[4:16] with him but you finally very few many
[4:20] would knowledge but very few that are
[4:23] humble and with forgiveness and brother
[4:26] kindness that's the only way you can
[4:29] read the priests seventh under
[4:31] inspiration so then the Lord spoke to me
[4:35] after I met him he told me - this is my
[4:41] testimony to get a hold of brother feel
[4:44] and start putting him into the
[4:48] convention meetings because I want to
[4:52] train him and I said he had to work for
[4:55] him to do so I did that and that's all
[5:01] as we as he preached and came over we
[5:05] became closer and closer and then and
[5:07] that was expanded and the truth as he
[5:11] began to us go out his ministry bless
[5:15] has blessed countless thousands go see
[5:19] the tapes on recopy in Africa in
[5:22] different places in America and so he's
[5:26] come over here to murder - the meetings
[5:28] and people Canada Africa South Africa
[5:32] South America
[5:34] Paula Rico and anyway else he has gone
[5:38] and so then these tapes of copy and his
[5:42] ministry with divine inspiration has
[5:46] blessed countless thousands as I've said
[5:50] belief that God has been preparing
[5:53] brother
[5:54] Ovid for the Ministry of perfection
[5:58] I won't dwell on doctrines and so forth
[6:03] because I know
[6:04] you are well instructed and what we
[6:07] believe so I just want to honor him and
[6:11] so therefore I really thank God for
[6:15] because all of you know me
[6:19] in Trinidad in 1974-75 I trying to bring
[6:23] the inspiration here
[6:24] and then in time of what came back and
[6:27] said be fine
[6:28] that's when well let's say it was
[6:31] rejected by the olive has a hold
[6:35] Trinidad but there were many individual
[6:40] believers later and so I met many
[6:43] medicines there I know many medicines
[6:45] there but I haven't seen anybody come up
[6:48] with dividing interpretation of the word
[6:50] as I have seen this gift in brother
[6:55] field so that's why I thank God for him
[6:59] and I take up this time - I am full
[7:04] stained with the word and straight on
[7:07] the word and he's a man that does not
[7:10] play his no foolishness comes in a
[7:13] pulpit equates to people he said now
[7:16] this open your Bibles and he's not
[7:19] afraid he'll stand alone if he has to
[7:22] and that's what I appreciate about it
[7:24] because I know because I had to do it
[7:26] myself
[7:26] it's just 1961 so therefore I really
[7:31] appreciated the quality they sent him
[7:34] was the gift and God put in appreciate
[7:37] his wife sister Ann Marie for standing
[7:40] by him and I know it's been hard to be
[7:42] there and to be ostracized and and
[7:47] reviled and so forth but the Bible says
[7:50] blessed or he when you are reviled my
[7:54] old man so it's really been countless
[7:57] blessings and so and I certainly
[8:00] appreciate his family and the lies it
[8:03] has been right in his father's footsteps
[8:05] been a blessing to many in Europe and
[8:08] also in Africa and here in America know
[8:13] he has something in land
[8:14] his heart so the morning dear
[8:17] bless you brother feel in your family in
[8:22] a mighty way and I appreciate the people
[8:25] in the headstone tabernacle ear and the
[8:27] brethren the way you stand behind your
[8:30] pastor and God will certainly bless you
[8:33] for this and I think it's a wonderful
[8:35] thing to give a man that deserves it a
[8:39] book he rolls is now rather than wait
[8:42] and give a wreath on is great so I think
[8:46] this is wonderful what you are what you
[8:49] are doing and right now I believe that
[8:53] this my words will be part of a tape of
[8:56] the lead from others so therefore I
[9:00] thank God again to salute him and this
[9:04] awareness no greater honor can die a
[9:09] savior of the stole about a man upon a
[9:13] man and other than to say that I feel
[9:16] that he's part of the ministries of
[9:18] perfection and that in itself wouldn't
[9:22] brother Brown he said many times why you
[9:26] maybe just hold his hand as an
[9:29] illustration you said there won't be no
[9:32] more than that winning then of the head
[9:35] in the fire for ministry and many rather
[9:38] not understand about the powerful
[9:39] ministry this is the the age of adoption
[9:43] so when we come into the age of the
[9:45] adoption the Apostles whenever they were
[9:48] taught by Jesus and when the Holy Spirit
[9:50] fell the person I'm talking about now
[9:52] not to birth like for Matthew no 6 but
[9:55] the person come down in the upper room
[9:56] and fill them with the Holy Ghost and
[9:59] not only fill them inside there's a
[10:01] birth but an quicken and mechanics as
[10:05] well the Grenaa brought up this truth
[10:06] and the rising of the Sun pays 31 days
[10:10] 30 and 32 and many have missed that
[10:12] little revelation and he dropped all and
[10:15] so therefore I feel that our brother
[10:19] here has in this age of adoption has
[10:23] been going about doing this work
[10:26] a pastor and going on the season doing
[10:29] the work over there and many medicine
[10:32] don't accept this fact but it is a fact
[10:34] because if you can find a church on
[10:38] earth today with the resurrected Lord
[10:42] Jesus Christ
[10:43] the original faith the D faith same life
[10:47] same signs same oneness same miracles as
[10:52] they had in the early bride more than us
[10:55] they show it to me if you cannot find it
[10:57] then therefore we have been contending
[11:00] for the faith restored back by Malachi 4
[11:06] and that's why I say double honor to
[11:10] brother Theo open for standing and
[11:13] catching this revelation then you must
[11:16] contend for it fight for it is stand-in
[11:20] there are you for it and stand up and
[11:23] they'll think you mean you know you
[11:24] think they'll think this no you are
[11:27] contending for the faith not have the
[11:30] contentions but contending and so I just
[11:35] like to read what the Ministry of
[11:37] perfection is and perseverance South
[11:42] Carolina Southern Pines North Carolina
[11:46] 1962 now I believe that there's a church
[11:52] coming into that perfection that
[11:57] ministry of perfection were the officers
[12:01] we apostles prophets teachers passes
[12:05] avenges for the perfecting of the church
[12:10] then passes and teachers now on page 44
[12:15] such of a perfect man brother bran was
[12:17] reading Ephesians 4:11 through there and
[12:21] he's saying he gets to the work of the
[12:23] ministry and he says the work of the
[12:25] ministry of christ and that's why i say
[12:28] all these different ministers around way
[12:31] as an entity of christ that i have not
[12:33] seen since brother brandon left
[12:35] that's why they were contending for it
[12:37] as Julie exhorted us to do and so
[12:41] therefore I feel that our brother has
[12:44] been contending for it and I feel that
[12:46] God is gonna richly reward him there and
[12:50] in Trinidad with dementia perfection and
[12:54] the man because your perfection will be
[12:57] there for perfecting of the saints
[12:59] well then working the ministry until you
[13:01] all come to get into that to one faith
[13:03] and the statue of the fullness of Jesus
[13:06] Christ and then bring the people from
[13:09] babies and bring them up by the word
[13:11] even unto the head and we all until we
[13:14] all come together with the same measure
[13:17] and when the offices were apostles
[13:21] prophets teachers pastors evangelists
[13:25] for the perfecting of the church they
[13:27] have pastors and teachers and so forth
[13:29] and his alone I'm safe he's been trained
[13:32] in a word and he stayed right with the
[13:34] word a mini monk and say you have to
[13:37] read quotes and I've been through it and
[13:40] they don't understand that you you must
[13:42] bring back the reveal word from the
[13:45] prophet in all it for it to have an
[13:47] anointing on it many men will feel like
[13:51] that
[13:51] that's not a real minister that without
[13:54] real preacher that they can just preach
[13:57] and in the message but that's not so if
[14:00] the revealed word is what we are is
[14:02] bringing the anointing has done us it's
[14:04] a Revere word and so forth now brother
[14:08] grandma saying that he's prophesied here
[14:10] they will be sold with the word until
[14:15] the whole thing will work right up into
[14:18] the coming of the Lord and we already
[14:20] are in it the Morning Sun descended from
[14:23] heaven with a shout so we end the coming
[14:26] of the Lord and your pastor there has
[14:29] been working with the word and it'll
[14:33] work right up into the coming of the
[14:34] Lord
[14:35] I believe that unbelievably near that
[14:37] time now he's promised I'm back in 1962
[14:39] I believe his soul you know we know that
[14:43] Jesus said and taught us all through
[14:45] this
[14:46] at the works that he did will be done
[14:48] also now my brethren I hope that if they
[14:51] disagree with me it would be on a
[14:53] friendly basis so I feel that the
[14:56] histone tabernacle when the Holy Spirit
[14:58] pours out the dynamics there will be a
[15:01] Messier perfection right there in your
[15:03] myths and the person of the field over
[15:08] put on a whole lot of God Santa Maria
[15:10] California 1962 now how does CalPERS and
[15:15] his army he bring us he presents his
[15:18] army in the form of five offices first
[15:21] apostles prophets teachers pastors
[15:24] evangelists
[15:26] that's his army that's his soldiers
[15:28] that's his commanding officers all with
[15:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting
[15:35] out there to meet the enemy on any
[15:36] grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy
[15:39] with a word of God amen
[15:41] each one back in one one another up and
[15:46] that's what I appreciate about brother
[15:48] Theo and the other brethren that we've
[15:50] been with we back one another up we
[15:53] don't go around this way that's way in
[15:55] and stay a woman in the back when we
[15:58] back one another up with him the chief
[16:01] captain not out in front up here above
[16:07] all back be honey but in them that's the
[16:12] army sorry that's the army vindicating
[16:17] vindicating what his resurrection by the
[16:20] proof of his words so it comes right
[16:23] back to what I said before the the thing
[16:26] in the original faith will be the
[16:29] resurrection of Jesus Christ back in our
[16:32] churches and here brother Graham is
[16:34] placing the fivefold ministry right in
[16:37] there so that with Christ in each each
[16:41] one of the final menaces and then he
[16:44] said here vindicating what his
[16:47] resurrection
[16:48] it'll be Christ in the ministry they're
[16:51] vindicating his own resurrected
[16:54] resurrection by being in your
[16:57] faster there and the size and the one
[16:59] that some intervals following so
[17:02] therefore and not only that st. John
[17:05] 14:12 will he to believeth on me the
[17:08] works of that do she how to do also and
[17:10] greater works than these shall you do
[17:12] because they go to my father
[17:13] and that that sort of scripture that's
[17:16] twofold brother branham said it many
[17:19] have done the works of Christ the
[17:20] seventy the disciples without the Holy
[17:23] Ghost and then it was proven on down
[17:26] here our age and the 50s and all the
[17:28] great evangelists and so forth did the
[17:31] works of Christ right along but as
[17:33] brother Branham was doing the greater
[17:35] works and the works so now I feel that
[17:38] the greater words the prophets said will
[17:41] be given on eternal life so I'm leaving
[17:43] your pastor will be a vessel chosen by
[17:46] God given a medicine of perfection to
[17:50] stand up there like Peter and while he
[17:52] yet speaks the word the greater works
[17:55] will come out eternal life the baptism
[17:58] of the Holy Spirit from pouring out to
[18:00] the people there and therefore there by
[18:03] remaining assault of sins of their souls
[18:08] so brother Theo I salute you for the
[18:13] long battle and stand in the great stand
[18:17] that you have taken and I believe this
[18:21] and may God richly bless you
[18:24] the headstone Tabernacle for taking his
[18:27] time out to respect your pastor and to
[18:31] give him a day of appreciation for I
[18:35] believe is doing him and so I myself
[18:38] thank God to be part of this celebration
[18:41] which I could be there but this is my
[18:44] way of contributing something something
[18:49] to the appreciation so may the Lord
[18:52] bless you and may it be a great Memorial
[18:56] Day and made a holy spirit pour out on
[18:59] each one of you and if I may I like to
[19:02] just bomb ahead and order my head and
[19:05] word of printed my heads together
[19:08] and as we give thanks unto the Lord
[19:10] Almighty God just speak of a few words
[19:15] and behalf of your servant brother the
[19:18] feel of it and the work that he has done
[19:20] Lord and he's proved himself out there
[19:23] to stay with the word and bring back did
[19:27] these reveal quotes and things Lord
[19:30] where the fire is on them and many
[19:33] minutes that don't understand that they
[19:35] just want to preach a thought but we
[19:37] want but therefore if you want he wants
[19:40] to hide it and get out of the way that
[19:42] you might be glorified and this is what
[19:45] Christ is looking for and I know that he
[19:49] has found one such a man as brother feel
[19:54] of course the others there and but we
[19:57] are honoring for the field so I'll keep
[20:00] it there so I believe he is one of those
[20:03] that you're going to give the Ministry
[20:05] of perfection to as brother Graham said
[20:08] page 59 touch of a perfect manner that
[20:12] is our duty to friend the no friend sake
[20:15] a swim never die to stand there and
[20:17] portals virtues into the people to the
[20:22] coming of to a perfection of the coming
[20:26] of the Lord
[20:26] and that's what I believe is for
[20:28] according to ephesians 4 11 through 16
[20:31] so Lord God may you pull out the Holy
[20:34] Spirit now upon the gathering near the
[20:38] group the church the friends the family
[20:41] whoever's there to honor your servant
[20:44] and truly give honor to whom honor is
[20:47] due and that's what we're doing today so
[20:50] may your blessing would a great mighty
[20:52] ministry Lord and bless his wife and his
[20:54] sons and be with them and may the church
[20:57] made the dynamics to the mechanics pour
[21:00] out there and all around or it may be a
[21:03] beacon of light all over trinidad and
[21:06] many finally realized that yes indeed a
[21:09] brother field did have a seventh under
[21:12] revelation which which is faith to bring
[21:16] on eruption grace so we pray lord you
[21:20] blessed them and
[21:22] gathering and all the festivities to
[21:24] speak into singing and all that will be
[21:27] done in behalf of his servant god bless
[21:31] you brother feel and may the Lord
[21:33] richest blessings be upon you
[21:35] Jesus name we ask the question amen and
[21:38] amen
[21:39] so I say the three words that the Lord
[21:45] spoke through the Prophet to me in 1964
[21:47] is in my darkest hour June 14 and the
[21:52] message was the out ball and I had to go
[21:55] outside because the ministers wanted to
[21:57] as they say they want they had the only
[22:00] gang up on me and say something and I
[22:04] went outside to see brother Branham and
[22:07] brother read him turn and walk toward me
[22:12] damaging two parked cars in the dark and
[22:15] he's a brother Coleman I was looking for
[22:18] you and brought a hunt to call you out
[22:20] and I want to say to you God bless you
[22:25] and so like I said it I believe in the
[22:30] meaning brother Branham said to the
[22:33] minister that told him in February 1965
[22:37] did brother Joseph Coleman get ahead of
[22:40] you because he preached cast out the
[22:42] bondwoman and brother Graham says no he
[22:46] says all you ministers are supposed to
[22:49] preached by a revelation and but it has
[22:53] to be in my message so I come back to
[22:56] what I've said
[22:57] but the RAM said here are you people
[23:02] but you believe was rather have have had
[23:06] the blessing of heaven God's servant
[23:10] with my divine inspiration interpret the
[23:13] word to you and therefore you can look
[23:16] around see you anointed you alive your
[23:19] Liberty Bissell's and there's more the
[23:22] greater part is yet to come
[23:23] so may the Lord which you bless all the
[23:25] Menace's that are there and
[23:29] and what they have said and so forth may
[23:31] it all be a blessing to you and me you
[23:34] continue on and mother feel but I'll be
[23:37] talking to you may the Lord of richly
[23:39] bless you and your wife and family and
[23:43] the entire church and so we thank you
[23:47] for all that you have done for us
[23:49] and blessed us so many blessings come
[23:52] back to you 104 god bless you is what
[23:57] brother Brown told me I say it back to
[23:59] you god bless you
