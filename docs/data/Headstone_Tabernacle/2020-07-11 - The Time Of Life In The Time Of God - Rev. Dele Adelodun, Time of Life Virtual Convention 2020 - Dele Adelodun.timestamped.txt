[24:17] scripture and I have the scripture here
[24:20] Genesis chapter 18 from verse 9 to 14
[24:25] and reached this wise and they said unto
[24:28] Him we re Sarada wife and he said behold
[24:33] in the tenth and he said I will
[24:37] certainly return unto thee according to
[24:39] the time of life and Lord Sarah the wife
[24:43] shall have a son and Sarah hary in the
[24:48] tent door which was behind him now
[24:53] Abraham and Sarah were old and was
[24:56] stricken in age and it seems to be with
[25:00] Sarah after the manner of women
[25:03] therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[25:07] saying after I am waxed old shall I have
[25:11] pleasure my lord being old also and the
[25:16] Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did
[25:20] Sarah laugh saying
[25:22] shall I of a surety be a child which I
[25:26] am told is anything too hard for the
[25:30] Lord added time appointed I will return
[25:35] unto thee according to the time of life
[25:37] and Sarah shall have a son
[25:41] may God a blessing to the reading of his
[25:44] ward in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[25:47] you may be seated just very little
[25:50] salutation I want to greet and salute
[25:55] the our hosts pastor T Ovid and his
[26:00] family and church and acres of
[26:03] government for the Reno's together for
[26:07] this special summertime meeting I want
[26:17] to also recognize I know the presence of
[26:21] other ministers here from all around the
[26:24] globe from Nigeria Ghana South Africa
[26:28] Europe Germany UK and America Argentina
[26:33] all around the world and all of you
[26:36] there in the internet or watching I want
[26:39] to say may God richly bless you
[26:41] so for me is a privilege to be here to
[26:45] bring you this testimony of our Lord
[26:48] Jesus Christ I'm here to testify
[26:51] amen and I want to keep the title of my
[26:56] testimony running through the
[26:59] inspiration and I title it seat time my
[27:04] subject is time of life and inspiration
[27:09] recognize your message and your day
[27:13] praise God a main hallelujah time of
[27:19] life time of life is a very special time
[27:24] is a seed time and recognizing that the
[27:30] Word of God is a seed
[27:32] jesus said that in the Bible and he said
[27:35] that this seed that was planted said
[27:38] that was the Word of God praise God
[27:40] remain hallelujah
[27:44] amen so and we know that God came to
[27:50] visit Abraham according to the promised
[27:52] word and when that time came for God to
[27:57] fulfill his promise nothing could stop
[28:00] him and I want to say for those of you
[28:03] that are here I want to let you know
[28:06] that God already had him plan and
[28:09] everything he has purposed for you in
[28:12] your life shall surely come to pass at
[28:15] his own time not at your own time
[28:18] praise God Amane and what is it the
[28:22] evening time message is the message of
[28:25] the hour is the message of Malachi 4 it
[28:28] has come it is to here with us because
[28:31] the Holy Spirit is still identifying
[28:33] with his word according to how it has
[28:36] been spoken and I notice that the Lord
[28:38] can never fail so God sent Malachi 4 at
[28:42] this end time and we know the challenges
[28:45] that normally come when God sends his
[28:46] prophets when he sent Moses he faced the
[28:49] challenge when he first nor infests the
[28:52] challenge and this time around he also
[28:54] sent Malachi 4 we will also have a
[28:57] challenge but despite of all these
[28:59] challenges I want to let you know God
[29:01] has already made a way of escape for you
[29:03] so there is a way of escape for you
[29:05] escape for you in your situations escape
[29:09] for you in your sickness escape for you
[29:12] in your maybe you think that everything
[29:15] is just going down and down I want to
[29:17] let you know God has you implant
[29:19] praise God a Maine so and the only thing
[29:22] that is required for us in this hour is
[29:24] nothing but God coming to take his bride
[29:26] away because we have seen Israel
[29:29] imposition we have seen that they are
[29:31] waiting to welcome back the Lord again
[29:34] but before that we take place the bride
[29:36] would have been taken praise God and
[29:39] therefore what is it god build his art
[29:43] and he framed it with his word and
[29:46] having framed it it doesn't matter how
[29:49] you may have tried to backslide or
[29:51] whatever no devil
[29:54] the one that I've done nothing to you
[29:56] for any reason it is that you are the
[29:59] one that's really strode away from the
[30:02] fortified wall that God has really done
[30:05] of this earth and all around by his word
[30:08] and then all you need to do follow the
[30:11] tracing of that blood the sprinkled
[30:14] blood of Christ and come back again into
[30:17] the framed Word of God and that's what
[30:20] God wants in this hour and I want to let
[30:22] you know the bride is already here and
[30:24] being in she's ready for the rapture and
[30:27] then what is it here
[30:28] the prophet in the message United time
[30:32] and sign it says here God United time
[30:36] yes
[30:37] oh my now remember now there is a
[30:40] uniting of the world unite him back
[30:42] again bring him back the faith that was
[30:46] once delivered to the Saints bring him
[30:48] back that this could only be done in
[30:52] this day the only time it could be done
[30:55] is right now it never was a attacked
[30:59] anyway as the went off on denominational
[31:03] sprays but now it don't belong to no
[31:07] denominational spray because it is time
[31:10] for the uniting of man and woman of
[31:12] every race every color every Creed
[31:15] everything on the Christ by the baptism
[31:18] of the Holy Spirit and back to the world
[31:21] praise to remain and then I want to also
[31:24] here before I close amen
[31:28] charities God is united his bride she is
[31:32] coming together from east and west and
[31:35] north and south there is a uniting time
[31:38] and dance on right now what is the
[31:41] worship uniting for the rapture amen
[31:44] God's getting her ready yes uniting what
[31:48] is what is it she is uniting width with
[31:52] the word for all the heavens and earth
[31:55] we pass away but my word shall never
[31:58] pass away she's uniting herself with all
[32:01] said the Lord regardless of what any
[32:04] denomination
[32:05] anybody has says she is uniting herself
[32:09] she's getting ready why she is the bride
[32:13] that's right and she is United herself
[32:17] with her bridegroom see and the
[32:20] bridegroom is the word in the beginning
[32:22] was the word and what was with God and
[32:26] what was God and what was made flesh and
[32:29] dwelt among us and that is the promise
[32:32] in this last day and that is our message
[32:35] praise God a main now in the message the
[32:38] world is falling apart I don't care what
[32:40] goes the world can fall apart but God is
[32:43] getting his people back again with his
[32:45] word he says here this is what we are
[32:50] supposed to stay fortified by is the
[32:53] world see we are surrounded by the world
[32:57] the world is in you God is in you around
[33:02] you wherever you go it is the word the
[33:05] word keep him always before you remember
[33:09] before we be conscious of him everywhere
[33:14] now when Eve and Adam walked like that
[33:18] there was no deaths the man a woman that
[33:22] works like that now there is no dead to
[33:25] him

[40:58] you are welcome in the name of Jesus
[41:01] Christ amen if you have your Bibles with
[41:06] you please turn with me to the book of
[41:09] Genesis chapter 18 Genesis chapter 18
[41:16] and in Genesis 18 I want to read from
[41:23] the ninth verse the background is the
[41:29] visitation of three hinges actually two
[41:33] angels and one hello him amen
[41:37] through Abraham so I just like to cut it
[41:42] from verse 9 to 19 amen and they said
[41:48] unto Him where is Sarah thy wife and he
[41:52] said behold in the tent and he said I
[41:57] will certainly return unto thee
[41:59] according to the time of life and lo
[42:03] Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[42:07] Sarah had it in the tent door which was
[42:11] behind him now Abraham and Sarah were
[42:15] hold and well striking in age and it
[42:18] ceased to be with Sarah after the manner
[42:21] of women therefore Sarah loved within
[42:25] herself saying after I am waxed old
[42:28] shall I have pleasure my lord being old
[42:32] also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[42:36] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[42:40] of a surety bear a child which I'm hold
[42:44] is anything to
[42:47] for the Lord at that time appointed are
[42:51] we return unto thee according to the
[42:53] time of life and Sarah shall have a son
[42:57] then Sarah denied saying I loved not for
[43:02] she was afraid and he said nay but thou
[43:06] did love and the men rose up from thence
[43:09] and looked toward Sodom and Abram went
[43:13] with them to bring them on the way and
[43:16] the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham
[43:20] death in which I do saying that Abraham
[43:25] shall surely become a great and mighty
[43:28] nation and all the nations of the earth
[43:31] shall be blessed in him for I know him
[43:35] that he will command his children and
[43:38] his household after him and they keep
[43:42] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[43:45] judgments that the Lord may bring upon
[43:49] Abraham that which he had spoken of him
[43:52] may the Lord had his blessings to the
[43:56] reading of his holy word god bless you
[43:59] you may be seated
[44:00] I greet you all in the name of the Lord
[44:09] Jesus Christ and welcome all the
[44:13] believers both present and on the
[44:17] virtual land to the meetings this year
[44:23] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:27] I've been told that believers connected
[44:33] from many parts of the world Latin
[44:36] Spanish French English many more
[44:40] language speaking countries amen and
[44:45] well known unto God how all his ways
[44:48] that we cannot at this time be
[44:52] physically present in the land of the
[44:56] Caribbean
[44:58] they call Twin Cities Trinidad but
[45:03] physically we might be hindered in our
[45:05] movement but the Word of God cannot be
[45:08] hindered amen there is no circumstance
[45:12] on earth that can hinder God or his word
[45:16] so we were told that if our technology
[45:21] rise up to eat even the words that our
[45:24] Lord Jesus Christ spoke while was he on
[45:27] earth can still be you know captured or
[45:30] honest and brought to the hearing of
[45:33] mankind because God's Word does not die
[45:37] so if it does not die and it cannot die
[45:41] it cannot also be hindered because that
[45:44] word is life
[45:45] so we thank God it knows about this time
[45:49] before the foundation of the world and
[45:52] he has also made adequate arrangements
[45:55] to get his watch across to his own
[45:58] despite all their hearts amen
[46:02] we thank God for a season like this we
[46:06] were told that there have been true
[46:10] global major pandemic on earth in recent
[46:16] time those who know if they arrived told
[46:19] us we had a major one in 1820 then
[46:23] another one in 1920 and a century later
[46:26] we are having another one in 2020 in
[46:30] between we have at Severus but they said
[46:33] they haven't be one that had a global
[46:35] spread all over the earth than this ones
[46:39] that we haven't and the remarkable thing
[46:43] for me about this current pandemic is
[46:46] that it's apt us to look at some silent
[46:52] things that are taking place for which
[46:55] believers should not gloss over the
[46:58] world by not know anything about it but
[47:01] as children of God will understand
[47:05] according to the scriptures and their
[47:07] review world Israel is our time peace
[47:11] the Prophet said if you want to know
[47:13] what time of the deities you can look at
[47:16] your wrist watch or a clock but if you
[47:18] want to know the hour you are living in
[47:20] the garage of Li spiritually look at
[47:23] Israel amen and one thing I saw in
[47:27] Makapuu in Israel which I have shared
[47:31] locally is that for the first time in
[47:35] known history since the advent of Christ
[47:41] the perfect and the original Passover
[47:43] Israel has not been able to celebrate
[47:48] their Passover within the context of the
[47:53] solemnity and the sincerity of the very
[47:58] first one that was instituted in the
[48:02] book of Exodus and the book of Exodus
[48:05] the Passover was meant to be a ransom
[48:09] for the firstborn amen and because the
[48:14] firstborn of the Egyptians were to be
[48:16] wiped out
[48:17] while the firstborn of the Israelites
[48:19] were to survive and the article for
[48:23] survivor is the blood he said when I see
[48:26] the Blood I will pass over you is that
[48:29] what the Bible said all right dust was
[48:32] the article for Survivor it never meant
[48:35] much to the Egyptian but it meant
[48:38] everything it mental life to an
[48:40] Israelite amen
[48:42] but you see the way it was to be
[48:45] celebrated was with serious caution and
[48:48] the so banished it was to be celebrated
[48:52] endure it was to be celebrated you know
[48:56] with some sobriety people are to be
[48:59] gathered ready prepared to leave the
[49:03] land of their slavery so it wasn't with
[49:06] such funfair you know ceremonies
[49:10] something to laugh about it was
[49:12] something to really be sober about and
[49:15] to do it with our consecration that was
[49:18] the spirit with which the Passover was
[49:21] instituted but over the years
[49:24] after the advent of Christ I think that
[49:27] soberness was lost because it became a
[49:30] celebration it became a party it became
[49:33] a family gathering until blows away even
[49:36] gathering for the Passover never
[49:39] understood the purpose or the meaning as
[49:42] it is always said the meaning of it get
[49:45] lost from generation through generation
[49:48] amen and you can see Israel returning
[49:52] back to the homeland in 1948 with the
[49:55] proclamation of 1946 and since then they
[49:58] restore the Passover but they were doing
[50:01] it more like a party like a funfair but
[50:04] for the first time in any known history
[50:08] hallelujah God allowed Israel to go back
[50:13] to the solemn celebration you know there
[50:16] was no Israel in 1820 there was none in
[50:20] 1920 Israel exists but never as a nation
[50:26] amen because since they were scattered
[50:29] in AD 70 by the invasion of Rome
[50:32] entitled general they were never
[50:35] recognized as a nation again so if there
[50:39] was any celebration at all it would be
[50:41] in the land of they're scattered in a
[50:43] wand'rin but as a nation they came back
[50:47] together after ad 70 in 1948 but the
[50:52] celebration they began to have threw out
[50:55] the meaning and the solemnity and the
[50:58] soberness of that ceremony until this
[51:01] year so the blessing the pandemic
[51:05] brought was to return Israel back to the
[51:08] sober celebration of Passover
[51:11] now this Passover of this year happens
[51:15] to be just exactly at the time of the
[51:19] Gentiles Easter and it is the same
[51:22] celebration it was Easter to the
[51:26] Gentiles it was a pass over to his
[51:28] realized amen
[51:30] they were celebrating the shadow
[51:32] Passover for the Gentiles that of
[51:35] accepted Christ are celebrating the real
[51:37] power
[51:38] Savva which is the Lord Jesus Christ and
[51:40] gods who arranged that it came together
[51:43] it's a pond at about the same time
[51:46] senses in this time around but God
[51:51] forbid Israel to do it like a party it
[51:54] returns to the original and a lot of
[51:58] Israelites were not happy about it
[52:00] they said that Passover was to be
[52:02] celebrated endure and they said the
[52:05] young people we are so sad but to me it
[52:08] was a joy
[52:10] you know I it's a call return it's a
[52:14] call to return to the original form of
[52:16] worship it's a preparation for Israel to
[52:20] start preparing for their visitation
[52:23] while it's a message to the Gentile
[52:25] world to stop preparing for their home
[52:28] no Israel in 1820 no Israel in
[52:34] 1920 but there is Israel in 2020 for the
[52:38] first time Israel celebrated Passover
[52:41] like it was in the original behind the
[52:44] closed door and in so banished that
[52:48] should speaks something to the bride of
[52:50] Jesus Christ it's a message French
[52:52] things are winding down and coupled with
[52:56] the fact that we've just been told that
[52:59] the greatest interest of Israelites
[53:02] young people today it's about the advent
[53:05] of the Messiah
[53:06] so if young people in Israel are
[53:09] watching for the coming of Messiah and
[53:12] the Gentile people are going into
[53:15] apostasy it's indeed true that the
[53:18] Gentile days are numbered so friends
[53:21] things are happening they will be rising
[53:24] and it will be going down and one of
[53:27] these days in the midst of each our Lord
[53:29] will come let's get ready for our
[53:32] redemption is near I want to appreciate
[53:35] a statue of it for a time like this and
[53:40] a platform to reach out to the sense of
[53:42] God all over the world appreciate
[53:45] brother heizak Oviedo also and all the
[53:48] rest of the minister's the
[53:50] officers the boat and the church at edge
[53:53] stone Tabernacle he ain't Rena Dutch and
[53:55] we pray that the blessings of God will
[53:58] rests upon your ministries upon your
[54:01] churches your families and your labor
[54:03] for the kingdom may God bless and be
[54:06] with you all and to the audience all
[54:08] over the world
[54:09] I say Shalom to the bride of Jesus
[54:11] Christ so this moment if the Lord would
[54:16] be our health I want to go with the
[54:20] theme of the convention by speaking on
[54:24] that time of life in the time of God
[54:30] amen
[54:31] the time of life in the time of God amen
[54:38] the scripture average which I believe is
[54:41] also the scripture for the convention
[54:45] was speaking of the visitation of three
[54:50] men to a God's elect
[54:55] in the beginning generation and this
[54:59] scripture is very important
[55:01] more than importance to the bride of
[55:05] Jesus Christ because this is one of the
[55:09] Old Testament scripture that explains
[55:12] the condition and the working of God in
[55:16] our own generation whatever you read in
[55:21] Genesis chapter 18 is a shadow as
[55:25] powerful as it is amen
[55:29] Abraham was a shadow Sarah was a shadow
[55:37] the holy real thing in there was the
[55:42] angel I'm not even speaking of the three
[55:46] angels I'm speaking of one from among
[55:49] the three amen
[55:51] is the only one who represented himself
[55:58] the rest that you saw in there the other
[56:01] angels
[56:03] all this character called Abram and
[56:05] Sarah we are representing something as
[56:08] people some people as their reason that
[56:15] one angel represented himself is because
[56:19] is the Ancient of Days is the same
[56:22] yesterday today and forever he is the
[56:25] one writing this entire story he is the
[56:29] one that story revolves around a man so
[56:33] evenly brought in some other actors in
[56:36] other to give us a preload of what is to
[56:40] take place in this end time and that is
[56:45] why this scripture is important to the
[56:47] bride of Jesus Christ
[56:49] so in this shadow we saw an angel that
[56:54] was caught hello him amen Abram gave a
[56:58] proof that it was not a Trinitarian here
[57:01] that it was a believer in the only one
[57:04] God of Israel because one of the sons of
[57:08] Abraham later said yea o Israel the Lord
[57:12] thy God is one and if it was truly a son
[57:17] of Abraham
[57:18] then that means abraham believed in one
[57:21] God you will ask me how when this angel
[57:24] came down the reason it was women to
[57:27] unveil himself to Abraham was because it
[57:30] said Abram will teach his generation so
[57:35] one of the things Abram taught is
[57:37] generation was the true revelation of
[57:40] Godhead that God is not three God is
[57:44] just one because Abraham was a believer
[57:48] in one God so it wasn't difficult for
[57:51] Moses to believe in one God it wasn't
[57:55] difficult for the Patriots to believe in
[57:57] one God three angels actually came down
[58:01] amen but when Abraham will address the
[58:05] three angels he said my lord
[58:08] he never said my Lords of many when two
[58:13] of them went to shoulder
[58:15] and lots call them my lords both three
[58:19] appeared to Abraham and Abraham said my
[58:22] lord so Abram believed in one God Abram
[58:28] had the perfect God at revelation a new
[58:31] three people came down but he knew who
[58:34] is God was among them because before
[58:37] that time he has been interacting with
[58:39] Abraham so Abram only listened to a
[58:42] familiar voice Alleluia and the Prophet
[58:47] give us a background to this visitation
[58:49] I hope I don't take your time today amen
[58:53] he told us that Abraham having made a
[58:56] proper choice of choosing the lunch of
[59:01] the desert as against the lunch we are
[59:05] not chose the land of the plain well
[59:08] watered Lance Amen things never went
[59:12] easy for Abraham but the Abram was
[59:16] demonstrating a Christian character here
[59:18] in preferring his brother ahead of
[59:21] himself it was the one who brought lot
[59:24] out it was the one who made lot whatever
[59:28] worth lot a Hodge Abram was responsible
[59:33] because he brought a lot of nothing and
[59:36] he made him so large they became so
[59:39] large until the lands will not contain
[59:43] the truth and there is a need for them
[59:45] to separate that separation was the
[59:49] program of God because without that
[59:51] separation Abram will not have this
[59:54] visitation of the three angels and that
[59:57] visitation was very important because
[1:00:01] the continuity of Abraham's generation
[1:00:05] by covenant relied upon that visitation
[1:00:10] without that visitation Abraham's
[1:00:13] generation we only before that by
[1:00:16] Ishmael but Ishmael was not a covenant
[1:00:21] product the plan of God was to deal with
[1:00:25] Abram according to a covenants
[1:00:27] and the only person that can carry on
[1:00:30] that covenant has to be somebody from
[1:00:33] Sarah
[1:00:34] but don't forget Sarah does not feel
[1:00:38] does not look though is not in a
[1:00:41] situation amen to be able to bring forth
[1:00:45] to continue that generation this is why
[1:00:49] this visitation is necessary for a great
[1:00:52] beam to come and restore the time of
[1:00:55] life because without the restoration of
[1:00:59] the time of life in God's time there
[1:01:03] will never be an Abrahamic generation
[1:01:06] you will have the Arabs but you will
[1:01:09] never have Israel another would you have
[1:01:12] Israel by the spirit so you yourself
[1:01:16] will never be here so this visitation
[1:01:20] was very important and I think the devil
[1:01:24] appreciated the importance of the
[1:01:26] visitation and it tried out to make sure
[1:01:30] it never happened
[1:01:31] the Prophet by the Revere word told us
[1:01:35] that the deadest visitation was to come
[1:01:37] was a terrible bad day for Abraham
[1:01:42] because of the choice image set and
[1:01:46] mature it was afflicting him when he
[1:01:50] told not the land is before us choose
[1:01:52] decide you want the Bible said by sites
[1:01:56] not by revelation Lord chose the path
[1:02:00] towards Sodom it was able to see
[1:02:03] opportunity for better economy he was
[1:02:06] able to see opportunity for financial
[1:02:09] and economic prosperity because it was
[1:02:12] looking by sight but friends when you
[1:02:15] are looking by sight the thing you are
[1:02:18] not seeing a much more than what you are
[1:02:20] saying believers are not to be are not
[1:02:24] strange and not built up to look by
[1:02:27] natural eyes they are to look by faith
[1:02:31] FET is the power to see beyond what your
[1:02:34] five senses can declare and it is those
[1:02:37] things that your five senses cannot
[1:02:39] declare that are more material to your
[1:02:42] existence it is those things that will
[1:02:45] affect your eternity is gonna be by
[1:02:50] faith church Lord couldn't see the
[1:02:54] destruction of his wife the destruction
[1:02:57] of his children they wiping out of all
[1:03:00] that he had in life
[1:03:02] it didn't seem safe ending up in a shame
[1:03:05] of having to become father by his own
[1:03:08] daughters why because he was looking by
[1:03:12] natural aside but the Bible told us
[1:03:16] Abram by faith Abraham didn't look
[1:03:20] natural it looks super natural and so
[1:03:24] when Lord choose that better place it
[1:03:27] wasn't nothing to Hebron he accepted the
[1:03:30] desert land but the devil will always
[1:03:33] make you feel you did a wrong thing so
[1:03:35] the Prophet said you know what the devil
[1:03:39] did he made him so far for that choice
[1:03:42] each day there was one story or the
[1:03:45] other oh the land was too dry that
[1:03:48] grasses wither the kacho couldn't get
[1:03:51] food and they were dying and we were
[1:03:53] like this we were coming this way and
[1:03:55] this one died and that one died that cat
[1:03:59] who had died this was happening brother
[1:04:02] Brahm said it got bad on sister Sarah
[1:04:06] mama Sarah and to begin to pull trouble
[1:04:11] with Abraham for allowing a little lot
[1:04:14] to take a better pass and the commotion
[1:04:19] was so much in the house and until
[1:04:22] father Abraham had to say excuse me I
[1:04:25] have enough eat let me just go out for
[1:04:27] some fresh air
[1:04:29] amen sometimes the pressure pile up on
[1:04:33] horse just walk out for a fresh air
[1:04:38] don't give in to your pressure because
[1:04:41] you know I when it gets so much under
[1:04:45] pressure it is the Scarecrow of the
[1:04:48] devil to keep you from your visitation
[1:04:51] it is really gets the darkest before the
[1:04:55] daybreak the darkest part of the night
[1:04:58] is not true a.m. is not 1:00 a.m. is not
[1:05:03] even 3:00 a.m. it is that time when the
[1:05:06] darkness are being congealed pressed
[1:05:08] together to give way to sunlight that is
[1:05:11] around 4:00 5:00 a.m. in the morning
[1:05:14] what a paradox but that is when it gets
[1:05:18] the darkest and when it gets the darkest
[1:05:22] around you it's an announcement that
[1:05:24] your son will soon shine don't ever give
[1:05:28] in to the devil don't buckle down under
[1:05:32] pressure
[1:05:33] don't faint in the days of adversity
[1:05:36] because it is only a scarecrow trying to
[1:05:40] keep you from your visitation Abram
[1:05:44] refused to Baku down it just said mama
[1:05:47] Sarah everything will be all right it's
[1:05:49] okay just calm down let me take some
[1:05:52] fresh air
[1:05:53] we've got enough bad news for the day
[1:05:56] but we need some fresh air and as he
[1:05:59] came out to get some fresh air within a
[1:06:03] few moments here came the three men
[1:06:06] coming the professor that was what did
[1:06:10] ever want Abram to miss so if they are
[1:06:14] picked up Korah with the wife if he had
[1:06:16] been in a state of a trouble in a state
[1:06:20] of Sue stupa in a state of sadness it
[1:06:24] will never see those people pass by so
[1:06:29] land to rise above it French land to buy
[1:06:32] passage that was the language of the
[1:06:35] Prophet is that I bypass that land to
[1:06:37] bypass that so that you don't miss your
[1:06:40] visitation and when these three men came
[1:06:44] they must have saluted each other under
[1:06:50] the next message the nestin was Abraham
[1:06:54] they met a store they will go but
[1:06:57] Abraham said gentlemen please turn in I
[1:07:02] can see a lot of doors over you I can
[1:07:06] help you a bit with some refreshment
[1:07:08] you must have been traveling for long
[1:07:11] just get in
[1:07:12] let's make refresh you get some watch
[1:07:15] get some drink and you can continue your
[1:07:17] journey as the accepted to come around
[1:07:20] he offered them more packages the user
[1:07:23] the reason why the Bible said give
[1:07:25] yourself to hospitality amen
[1:07:28] seeds of Abraham are us beatable if you
[1:07:33] are not hospitable you need to find out
[1:07:36] what your genealogy is amen Abraham was
[1:07:40] willing to give everything to strangers
[1:07:43] it didn't know because there was a
[1:07:46] witness in his heart
[1:07:48] hallelujah and the masalas beard up
[1:07:51] witness in our heart there must always
[1:07:53] be a bubble of compassion for every true
[1:07:57] seed of Abraham even if it cost you your
[1:08:00] last meal give it the one all restored
[1:08:04] the flan the oil of the widow woman is
[1:08:07] still in charge the Bible told me the
[1:08:10] same yesterday today and forever does
[1:08:18] the nature of seeds of Abraham
[1:08:20] hallelujah so they turned in and he did
[1:08:26] all he could
[1:08:27] it wasn't an easy thing for a man to go
[1:08:30] and kill a goat in Rama whatever it did
[1:08:33] it dress it they prepare it and these
[1:08:36] three visitors waited patiently enough
[1:08:41] until dustin's we are prepared and ready
[1:08:44] to be eating friends God hate
[1:08:49] [Laughter]
[1:08:51] a drunk milk is how did he do it
[1:08:56] God knew what was going to happen the
[1:08:58] Prophet told me to reveal what told me
[1:09:01] that when is tap done from glory with
[1:09:04] his angels knowing that we eat in the
[1:09:06] eyes of Abraham is Pope to be bodies
[1:09:10] into existence
[1:09:11] hallelujah because in the firm they came
[1:09:14] down they will never heat but they know
[1:09:17] they must eat amen because they must
[1:09:20] give us a message
[1:09:21] amen the anonymous it so is Pope to be
[1:09:25] partisan to assistance he told his
[1:09:28] angels to step into those bodies and
[1:09:30] himself tapped into one so they look
[1:09:35] like ordinary people but they were
[1:09:37] Angelica visitors this is the reason the
[1:09:40] Bible said be auspey table he said
[1:09:43] because this is the way you entertained
[1:09:45] angels unawares they can come in the gap
[1:09:50] of the flesh of your neighbor that might
[1:09:52] be an angel and friends after they hit
[1:10:00] they enjoyed themselves I hope I'm not
[1:10:03] too slow for you this morning they
[1:10:05] enjoyed themselves and they were
[1:10:08] satisfied they declared their mission
[1:10:13] amen I think it's light it feels like
[1:10:17] the nature of God when that when - soon
[1:10:20] a mad woman has done everything amen for
[1:10:24] the representative of God at that time
[1:10:27] that was when they on the students needs
[1:10:30] they said what can we do for God is
[1:10:34] still in that business amen
[1:10:37] it knows what to do for you but
[1:10:39] sometimes he wants you to create a
[1:10:41] platform for each it wants you to
[1:10:44] present something as a basis for which
[1:10:47] it will bless you you want to use
[1:10:50] something as a medium for a visitation
[1:10:53] unto you this is why you must never be
[1:10:56] weary in well-doing it is a simple
[1:11:00] subject Amen so
[1:11:04] after they have eaten and drunk and
[1:11:06] enjoy themselves that one was the elohim
[1:11:11] among them said we are is Sarah thy wife
[1:11:13] as if she didn't know it didn't know
[1:11:16] that is just in the tents behind here so
[1:11:20] you know why we came down here few
[1:11:23] things in the message and 98 ones at the
[1:11:28] end time the prophet tops of those few
[1:11:31] things is that three things will happen
[1:11:34] one the world will be in a certain
[1:11:37] condition women it's a number two this
[1:11:41] is the hour for jinns and Gimbels to
[1:11:43] arise we have seen them already
[1:11:45] amen and I said number three it is also
[1:11:49] the hour for the revelation of the Son
[1:11:51] of Man
[1:11:53] so we have come down for few purposes
[1:11:57] number one I not we again so the god
[1:12:06] amongst them know himself and under
[1:12:12] children who are connected to that God
[1:12:14] also know themselves and they know their
[1:12:16] father amen
[1:12:18] it will take a bastard to after he
[1:12:21] father's as a matter for no one as three
[1:12:24] fathers but it is it looks but static
[1:12:28] when three people are laying claim to a
[1:12:31] father thank God we are songs were not
[1:12:36] bastard we know our Father we know where
[1:12:40] we came from we are pedigree because we
[1:12:44] can trace our genealogy Alleluia is a
[1:12:49] high we'll visit Sarah according to the
[1:12:55] time of life when Sarah Hodge that she
[1:13:03] knew what it meant
[1:13:05] said he said by this time next year
[1:13:10] Sarah will carry a son that was too much
[1:13:15] for Sarah
[1:13:16] who believe she said me out of my head
[1:13:21] don't forget by the time it came to
[1:13:24] Abram and Sarah hundred years old even
[1:13:27] less than hundred was already well
[1:13:30] stricken in age do you realize that in
[1:13:36] the days of Enoch in the days of
[1:13:38] Methuselah Abram would be a kid but
[1:13:42] since it was pronounced the day you eat
[1:13:45] the error of that day you die that death
[1:13:48] has been shown in symptoms in the
[1:13:50] decimation of the age of the individual
[1:13:54] until when it came to Abraham being an
[1:13:57] honorary Alfred or ninety was already
[1:14:00] hold and striking in age because that
[1:14:05] was the testimony of the Bible
[1:14:07] concerning this couple said they were
[1:14:09] old and well stricken
[1:14:11] so Sarah saying what he said she knew
[1:14:14] what she was saying she understood the
[1:14:17] rhythm of our body she understood a
[1:14:20] chemistry but this doesn't matter to God
[1:14:23] who created that body who knew about
[1:14:27] that chemistry in new world Sarah was in
[1:14:32] new it has ceased to be with her
[1:14:35] according to the manner of women before
[1:14:38] he said I will visit and for you to
[1:14:48] understand it he said I will do it
[1:14:51] outside of my natural range because
[1:14:55] Abram knee Sarah will need a restoration
[1:14:59] of the time of life follow me now in
[1:15:04] order to be able to bring forth the
[1:15:06] promised son but Sarah was not in a
[1:15:12] position to carry time of life again it
[1:15:18] assists to be with our she doesn't feel
[1:15:21] like any other woman feels on a monthly
[1:15:24] basis again so medically speaking
[1:15:29] physiologically speaking by lecture
[1:15:31] naturally speaking all that this man had
[1:15:34] come to say cannot happen and that was
[1:15:39] why as a human being she doubted and
[1:15:43] loved within ourselves but the one who
[1:15:48] came down was no ordinary man he didn't
[1:15:55] have to look at the construction of your
[1:15:57] face before he knows what is in your
[1:15:59] bank because some people as much they
[1:16:05] look great with their countenance but
[1:16:07] their mind is speaking something else
[1:16:09] some people are that deftly smart no
[1:16:13] matter how deafness Macchio ha you can
[1:16:15] be smarter than God so there's no
[1:16:21] pretenses before him he had his back
[1:16:24] turned to detent and guess what he hacks
[1:16:27] Abraham it didn't even turn back because
[1:16:30] it was with Abram a our business is that
[1:16:34] why did Sarah laugh even he didn't
[1:16:39] challenge Sarah immediately because in
[1:16:42] know Sarah as Noah torment to present
[1:16:45] him n as the one who could stand as an
[1:16:49] atonement for Sarah amen
[1:16:52] the circumcised man becomes the
[1:16:55] atonement for his own wife you can see
[1:16:58] that Abram made no defense Abram was
[1:17:02] come it's a maybe I didn't worry about
[1:17:05] that let's call the attention of Sarah
[1:17:07] Sarah why did you laugh is I didn't
[1:17:11] laugh that was enough to cause the death
[1:17:16] of Sarah instantly do you know why she
[1:17:20] said it to the face of God that you lied
[1:17:26] that would look like a blaspheming but
[1:17:30] thank God for hey bruh ha
[1:17:32] thank God for the Lord Jesus Christ if
[1:17:35] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:17:38] light the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[1:17:41] us
[1:17:43] now what cleanseth means constant
[1:17:46] atonement you know the prophets that God
[1:17:51] doesn't even see you
[1:17:53] he only hears your voice when it looks
[1:17:56] to see you is his Jesus amen and that is
[1:18:00] why you can never be faulted before him
[1:18:02] because you are represented before
[1:18:05] Christ before God by your sacrifice and
[1:18:08] this sacrifice was examined totally from
[1:18:13] the outs of critics to the outs of the
[1:18:15] supporters the verdict was the same we
[1:18:18] found no fault in him the people of the
[1:18:22] earth found no fault in him in L they
[1:18:26] found no fault in him in heaven they
[1:18:28] found no fault in him that is right it
[1:18:31] became the perfect sacrifice and the
[1:18:34] captain of your salvation so if your
[1:18:37] sacrifice is not faulty you are not
[1:18:39] faulty it doesn't give you lessons to
[1:18:42] live anyhow amen
[1:18:44] because if you have truly accepted the
[1:18:47] sacrifice it changes your nature
[1:18:49] it changes you from denomination to the
[1:18:52] wedge it changes your habit it changes
[1:18:55] your desire sin cannot come to you by
[1:18:58] desire it might come as a mistake but
[1:19:01] not as a willful desire when you are
[1:19:04] still a willful sinner you have not
[1:19:06] accepted the sacrifice Oh glory to God
[1:19:12] are you seeing the beauty of atonement
[1:19:15] this is why the Prophet pronounced the
[1:19:18] bread as a sinless virtuous bride of
[1:19:22] Jesus Christ always standing pure the
[1:19:26] Prophet true challenge is that in your
[1:19:28] face I may not be perfect amen but in
[1:19:32] the face of a who matters I am more than
[1:19:35] perfect
[1:19:36] because I am blood wash I am sin free I
[1:19:40] am guilty free that is what the blood of
[1:19:44] jesus crisis a generation of people upon
[1:19:48] unseen can never be imputed they are the
[1:19:52] blessed of the Lord that's what my
[1:19:54] scripture says so it's a name you loved
[1:20:03] but don't worry don't mind we won't
[1:20:08] argue about that I know what you did the
[1:20:11] Bible says she was afraid
[1:20:13] then God threw a challenge is anything
[1:20:16] too hard
[1:20:17] Church of the Living God I'm asking this
[1:20:21] morning in the face of your Downton
[1:20:24] problems or the challenges you are
[1:20:26] facing in the face of that debt crisis
[1:20:29] is anything to add for the Lord the
[1:20:33] answer was no 10 the answer is still no
[1:20:36] now because is the same yesterday today
[1:20:41] and forever you love him it's an I will
[1:20:50] visit you according to the time of life
[1:20:54] amen
[1:20:55] if the most visitation according to the
[1:20:59] time of life that means that with Sarah
[1:21:01] as lost by menopause let me come a plane
[1:21:07] must be restored for there to be a
[1:21:11] restoration of that there must be a
[1:21:13] restoration of youth amen there must be
[1:21:18] a restoration of the stream of life and
[1:21:21] look you've got to assess this friend
[1:21:24] because the Prophet said what God was
[1:21:27] using Abram and Sarah to demonstrate is
[1:21:30] what is going to do to every sons and
[1:21:34] daughters of a bruh
[1:21:36] old age is not our final reward eternal
[1:21:42] youth is the final reward of the
[1:21:44] believer but that youthfulness is not by
[1:21:47] this time body whether we are life or we
[1:21:50] are gone before it comes there will be a
[1:21:52] change of the body they are big
[1:21:55] glorification amen and in that body
[1:21:59] there will never be an old man this is
[1:22:01] what we come to the house of the Lord to
[1:22:04] connect from where we are to where we
[1:22:06] should be because we fell from somewhere
[1:22:09] but tell it to the righteous this
[1:22:11] morning they are be returned glory to
[1:22:15] God so if there must be a visitation
[1:22:21] according to the time of life there must
[1:22:24] be a restoration of those things and
[1:22:26] that was too much for Sarah amen
[1:22:30] it's been too much for them for a while
[1:22:33] but let me tell you this morning God
[1:22:36] will never visit the bright outside of
[1:22:40] the time of life I will explain it amen
[1:22:46] now the time of life was explained by
[1:22:50] the Prophet in two ways
[1:22:54] he used the 28-day cycle of woman you
[1:23:00] understand what I'm saying to explain
[1:23:02] the time of life but that is one amen
[1:23:07] and I will come back to heat because
[1:23:10] even that as the nature speaks of our
[1:23:12] supernatural visitation today who will
[1:23:15] come to eat then he also explained time
[1:23:19] of life as a cycle in which God does his
[1:23:23] things
[1:23:26] it was talking of Zechariah and was the
[1:23:31] name Elizabeth he said then knew God
[1:23:35] gave them a very proper charge who
[1:23:37] become a messenger but they were so
[1:23:41] sober and such because they know that
[1:23:44] according to the time of life
[1:23:47] that we never lived to see that boy get
[1:23:50] into his ministry so that is not
[1:23:54] speaking of the transience death cycle
[1:23:56] of a woman now it speaking of that cycle
[1:23:59] that time at which God will bring his
[1:24:01] purpose to pass so these two things are
[1:24:07] similar in nature and they are
[1:24:11] interwoven and that is why I am speaking
[1:24:13] of the time of life in that time of God
[1:24:18] now for you to understand where we are
[1:24:21] going
[1:24:22] it is not everybody or every woman who
[1:24:30] sees what you call a period that can
[1:24:34] conceive even though medically speaking
[1:24:40] that is the basis for conception is that
[1:24:45] right if she could see a period it's a
[1:24:48] sign that she still agates eggs to be
[1:24:51] what to be fertilized but we have a
[1:24:56] whole lot of women in the world today
[1:24:59] who had no problem Ganic illogically
[1:25:02] amen who as their heads every month and
[1:25:06] when the eggs are not you know you know
[1:25:09] met with life they become pasta tossed
[1:25:11] blood is all right that's what they
[1:25:13] explained to us but we still have a lot
[1:25:16] of them a marriage and trusting God for
[1:25:18] children and medically which are the
[1:25:21] tests they said there was no problem in
[1:25:24] their life there was no problem with a
[1:25:26] brother there was no problem with the
[1:25:28] sister and yet the child is not coming
[1:25:34] so meaning that for a human being
[1:25:37] that time of life cycle is not enough
[1:25:41] for anything to happen that time of life
[1:25:45] must come into the time of God are you
[1:25:51] catching it the superior Trainmen is the
[1:25:54] time of God because until God's
[1:25:58] appointed time
[1:25:59] that time of life we always fill you so
[1:26:03] if you said I went in I conceived I had
[1:26:07] my baby
[1:26:08] I consider again I have my baby you were
[1:26:11] a venire conception because it was God's
[1:26:14] time for hitch are you cutting it and I
[1:26:21] wanted to understand these principles
[1:26:23] because that is also the spiritual
[1:26:26] principles with which God has dealt with
[1:26:28] his bride in these last days if you can
[1:26:32] catch this you've caught 60% of the
[1:26:34] message amen you might be able to
[1:26:40] experience time of life but until it
[1:26:45] comes into that time of God conception
[1:26:49] will never take place that is why you
[1:26:51] see every couples they've done every
[1:26:55] test that is possible under heaven and
[1:26:58] every test at vindicated that there was
[1:27:01] no problem and yet they couldn't have a
[1:27:04] charge lets them not fresh let them not
[1:27:09] worry nothing is actually wrong with
[1:27:12] them let them not allow the devil to
[1:27:14] work them off and keep them in anxieties
[1:27:17] because anxieties will never allow them
[1:27:20] to see the purpose of God
[1:27:23] anxiety we make them miss that time of
[1:27:27] God for their lives let me say this
[1:27:30] there's actually no Baroness with God's
[1:27:32] children listen to me the whole thing is
[1:27:37] only wait until God's time said they
[1:27:42] said there is nothing wrong with me
[1:27:44] and yet I'm burning you are not buried
[1:27:48] amen
[1:27:49] tell it to that sister she is not barren
[1:27:52] it's just that that time of life must
[1:27:55] come into God's time
[1:28:00] let me prove it to you more radical
[1:28:03] Sarah saw that time of life all our
[1:28:06] years that is why the Bible could say is
[1:28:10] cease to be with her are you following
[1:28:13] simple Scripture she was enjoying that
[1:28:16] time of life but it came to a point that
[1:28:20] it never appeared again which shows to
[1:28:23] you that that is not as important as the
[1:28:26] time of God so don't keep your eyes on
[1:28:29] the time of life keep your eyes on that
[1:28:32] time of God yes the season for
[1:28:38] everything God does until you come in
[1:28:41] season you will fail I prove it to you
[1:28:47] so you will understand what time of life
[1:28:49] is time of life is when God activate is
[1:28:53] Popish and they won't do it until the
[1:28:58] time he has appointed for each human so
[1:29:02] time of life actually is time of God it
[1:29:08] ceased to be with Sarah and as far as
[1:29:12] God is concerned there was no problem I
[1:29:16] thank God the prophet described in Abram
[1:29:19] for us as far as Abram was concerned
[1:29:21] there was no problem is that he told the
[1:29:24] doctor the one who promised me can never
[1:29:27] fail so menopause shouldn't be a problem
[1:29:31] to you no condition should be a problem
[1:29:34] to you amen
[1:29:36] if it's a condition brought by fallen
[1:29:38] nature doubts that condition deny that
[1:29:42] condition because it can never be
[1:29:44] greater than the promises of God it says
[1:29:53] to be with her Peyman and she was
[1:29:56] hopelessly hopeless but when God's time
[1:30:01] came in Genesis chapter 18 is that I am
[1:30:07] now ready to visit
[1:30:09] according to the time of life so this
[1:30:14] visitation is God's timing amen and God
[1:30:18] knew that Sarah needed that time of life
[1:30:22] even if is just to be restored for once
[1:30:25] in other to prepare are to receive see
[1:30:28] amen
[1:30:29] is anything too hard for the Lord but
[1:30:33] why they did not happen when she was a
[1:30:35] lot younger it was in God's time a new
[1:30:43] covenant
[1:30:45] Elizabeth and Rebecca and Zachariah
[1:30:48] couldn't have had John the Baptist
[1:30:51] earlier than that time they had him do
[1:30:54] you agree with me do you agree with me
[1:30:57] of what use will be a foreigner who will
[1:31:01] be almost dead before the one who is to
[1:31:03] foreign comes there must be
[1:31:08] contemporaries they must meet themselves
[1:31:13] here when this endtime foreigner Jesus
[1:31:16] Christ our Lord came the Prophet told us
[1:31:19] it must be on earth at the time of
[1:31:20] Revelation 10 7 amen because it must be
[1:31:25] a concept in Misaka contemporary
[1:31:27] ministry with the one whom he is for
[1:31:30] running amen how can I introduce an
[1:31:34] abstraction bin to you amen there it
[1:31:41] must be here to us declare behold the
[1:31:44] lamb of God that carried away the sin of
[1:31:48] the world
[1:31:50] amen the Prophet told us when the mighty
[1:31:54] angel amen which is going to have one
[1:31:57] leg up on the head and one leg up on the
[1:31:59] water when nothing will fulfill he said
[1:32:02] the aptly seventh angel must be here
[1:32:05] amen they must have a contemporary
[1:32:08] ministry because one must introduce the
[1:32:11] other
[1:32:12] so William brand couldn't have comma
[1:32:14] edge of this time because is the 1/2 in
[1:32:18] produced Christ is the one to tell us
[1:32:20] and it was our Lord up there no one
[1:32:25] could've done that before the love of
[1:32:28] God the Korea tradition of the world
[1:32:30] John and Jesus must be contemporaries
[1:32:37] so was Elizabeth Barron Erin it's deep
[1:32:42] she wasn't barren hallelujah
[1:32:46] she was our time of life was also was
[1:32:50] only waiting for our time in God let her
[1:32:58] be an encouragement to you
[1:33:00] you know I'm stressing this Satan we
[1:33:04] always want you to heart outside of the
[1:33:08] time of life or we want you to invent a
[1:33:13] Reviver outside of the time of God Moses
[1:33:18] looked at himself the professor at 40 I
[1:33:22] felt is got to go by the business right
[1:33:26] now it must be done Amon it never waited
[1:33:31] for God's timing and he launched a Dutch
[1:33:35] revival but what did he produce death of
[1:33:39] only one Indian all these military
[1:33:42] training and skills and everything of
[1:33:44] Moses achieved only one Egyptian anytime
[1:33:49] you take the matter upon yourself your
[1:33:51] achievement will be one Egyptian get
[1:33:57] from me and this is your one Egyptian
[1:33:59] you will not even wait be able to wait
[1:34:02] to defend your victory you will run away
[1:34:06] hallelujah because you are trying to
[1:34:10] invoke time of life outside of the time
[1:34:13] of God you don't get conception you
[1:34:19] don't get Reviva just by your ability to
[1:34:23] produce eggs or to produce gems amen
[1:34:27] when that informs the conception it's
[1:34:30] because it was God
[1:34:31] timing to do a service inside the will
[1:34:39] of God
[1:34:39] timing is one of the Kadena thoughts the
[1:34:43] Prophet taught us
[1:34:44] Moses means that timing even though he
[1:34:48] knew he had a revelation and it was
[1:34:51] correct he was sent to do the job it was
[1:34:55] a correct revelation by usually the one
[1:35:00] who promised Israel the one who promised
[1:35:03] Abraham in Genesis 15 according to the
[1:35:05] convenant he said deliverance will come
[1:35:08] after 400 years not before when you do
[1:35:15] your mathematics very well Moses was
[1:35:17] trying to bring deliverance before 400
[1:35:20] years because if we spend if we sent
[1:35:25] spent fund 40 years running away amen
[1:35:28] and Israel eventually came out at 430
[1:35:32] years take 40 years from 430 that was
[1:35:36] three 90 years
[1:35:38] if God has allowed Moses to succeed at
[1:35:42] that time in started it will have broken
[1:35:44] the scriptures but you see how powerful
[1:35:48] it is that God watches over his word to
[1:35:51] perform it to the letter
[1:35:54] [Applause]
[1:35:56] he wouldn't do under it wouldn't do over
[1:36:00] it must be exactly as I said is that
[1:36:03] after 400 years some people are
[1:36:06] challenging that is a founder yes but
[1:36:09] they came Authority as a go back and
[1:36:11] read your Bible I didn't say 400 years
[1:36:14] is there after four zero one is after
[1:36:18] four zero four ninety-nine is even after
[1:36:23] so for 30 years is perfectly in line
[1:36:27] what that word says is the funda
[1:36:31] must be accomplished then after eat
[1:36:33] something can take place
[1:36:35] Moses attempted it at 390 years Gaza
[1:36:38] uh-uh
[1:36:41] so you will think it's God's Reviva why
[1:36:44] is the devil you see that believers are
[1:36:50] seeing the devil beyond the bad man who
[1:36:53] just who is just can't Icarus we know
[1:36:56] the devil is one of the closest ally is
[1:36:59] it so close to the light and yet there
[1:37:02] is no light in him it works around the
[1:37:06] boundary of the truth and yet there is
[1:37:08] no truth in him until you see the devil
[1:37:12] like that you have missed him you see
[1:37:20] the reason why the professor the
[1:37:21] greatest light I was ever told as a 9910
[1:37:24] 2.9 truth in age did you catch that so
[1:37:29] what is light by the way 99.99% truth
[1:37:34] point 0 0 1 lie arrow makes it what a
[1:37:39] lie
[1:37:40] this is my friends we don't believe
[1:37:42] prophecy or any truth that has imagined
[1:37:45] of hero is that least when you look at
[1:37:47] this is the present of it came to pass
[1:37:49] the 40 percent can be forgiven we shall
[1:37:52] not forgive it because it is not 40
[1:37:55] percent that proves is the devil oh
[1:38:00] praise the Lord
[1:38:02] you love him this morning so 3 90 years
[1:38:08] God said no that period is going to
[1:38:11] accomplish that was why God kept him
[1:38:13] away he was too excited to be catch in
[1:38:17] Egypt he probably will have attempted
[1:38:19] another one
[1:38:20] amen so God kept him away for 40 years
[1:38:23] amen by the time we came back the people
[1:38:26] were also ready at that time the
[1:38:30] brethren went already but by the time we
[1:38:33] came back everybody was ready so the
[1:38:36] revival was universal I am feeling the
[1:38:38] way my brother is feeling
[1:38:40] because God has sent DiSpirito
[1:38:42] supplication he has sent a spirit of
[1:38:44] revival so is catching fire on you is
[1:38:47] catching fire Amy is catching fire in
[1:38:49] everybody and all of us are ready so
[1:38:53] also in this end time let me say it
[1:38:56] without fail a lot of us are trying to
[1:39:00] manufacture Reviva you will fail and it
[1:39:04] is not God's let me tell it is not God's
[1:39:07] move it is pure Satanism is that this is
[1:39:12] deep I see yeah I know it is deep but
[1:39:15] you got to receive it say why is there
[1:39:17] no revival in the back well then who
[1:39:19] told you there is no revival in the
[1:39:21] bride hey that sounds like the devil to
[1:39:26] me hmm
[1:39:30] people who feel they're very spiritual
[1:39:32] want to agree with ish so where's
[1:39:35] general Rivera you know what you are
[1:39:37] doing you are trying to define Reviva by
[1:39:40] by what you have seen in the Pentecostal
[1:39:43] which is proven dead by there to be what
[1:39:47] to be false to be Arrangements to be
[1:39:52] fraudulent moves you can only be
[1:39:56] deceived if you have a seed of deception
[1:39:59] in you but let me tell it to the blood
[1:40:02] of Christ this message of the hour
[1:40:05] the professor is the program of God it's
[1:40:10] not yours is not mine
[1:40:12] Amen I didn't make myself what I am
[1:40:15] today
[1:40:16] you did make yourself what you are if he
[1:40:19] brought you this far it will take you
[1:40:22] truth for those of you are concerned
[1:40:27] about the future of the message save
[1:40:29] your worries the future of the message
[1:40:32] is secured it was already secured from
[1:40:35] eternity before we came to time God is
[1:40:39] not having one day sleepless night over
[1:40:42] the continuity of the message oh yes it
[1:40:47] is you defuse that you want to have good
[1:40:49] at the harvest sleepless night
[1:40:51] oh yes brother there is nothing wrong
[1:40:56] with the future of the message how about
[1:40:58] all these things people are doing they
[1:41:00] are things data to be it is the our
[1:41:04] fortunes and jimba to arise amen and
[1:41:08] gents and Jambres will always rise up to
[1:41:11] attack the truth amen but it wouldn't
[1:41:15] change the truth it didn't change Moses
[1:41:18] it didn't change Aaron even though their
[1:41:20] activities and the pressure of Egypt was
[1:41:23] affecting the Brethren but it never
[1:41:25] changed those who had the mission it
[1:41:30] wouldn't change you and I we should be
[1:41:34] having this we should be having that we
[1:41:36] should be listening that Hotel you dead
[1:41:38] is not be enraged sick I've been healed
[1:41:43] I'm seen hands data with a straightening
[1:41:45] out obscene honey has disappeared
[1:41:48] absent two more disappeared some of you
[1:41:51] are witnesses of it
[1:41:53] absent people upset people received
[1:41:55] their children absence and rise up and
[1:41:58] acts foreign with data from plane and
[1:42:01] Austin's are taking place they are in
[1:42:03] line with God's program do you hear the
[1:42:08] words is what the program is the
[1:42:11] professor attitude that we have received
[1:42:13] we have got to drop down he told us of
[1:42:17] the thought pool is said that which we
[1:42:19] have worked in this small measure him n
[1:42:22] friends although since you have seen RT
[1:42:26] writes children they the fish they
[1:42:29] received back life thus curious that was
[1:42:31] poking into existence they are all
[1:42:33] worked in what small measure the profits
[1:42:39] that we are slowing down waiting for the
[1:42:42] time to use it in a greater way you know
[1:42:46] why because in this race the Antichrist
[1:42:50] lacks the power it lacks the provocation
[1:42:54] as at that time of the Prophet amen
[1:42:58] to bring to full effect all the powers
[1:43:01] and glory of God
[1:43:03] we'll do it this is what it looks as if
[1:43:07] we have run too far ahead
[1:43:09] amen and the professor we will slow down
[1:43:12] waiting for them to catch off he said
[1:43:15] when they catch up
[1:43:17] watch what I'm fixin to tell you he told
[1:43:21] you what that Todd pulled damn you know
[1:43:25] God was releasing beats by beats in her
[1:43:27] in Egypt amen the BT was religion was
[1:43:31] much in the power of Pharaoh the BT was
[1:43:35] religion was matching amen and when God
[1:43:38] saw that Pharaoh was evil ready to bow
[1:43:40] kudani with a you can't you can't repent
[1:43:43] I promised Abraham I will bring his
[1:43:46] people had my mighty hand you need the
[1:43:49] wickedness the level of wickedness that
[1:43:52] we provoke the greater power so God is
[1:43:55] allowing the Antichrist to come to
[1:43:57] ripening is allowing this world to come
[1:44:00] to a level of decadence is allowing them
[1:44:03] to come to the earth to their most
[1:44:05] atrocious form of Sodom
[1:44:07] before he unleashes greater power
[1:44:10] otherwise it will be it will be a
[1:44:13] situation of using sledge Amato Killa
[1:44:15] fly for those of you are crying forever
[1:44:20] that is the answer to your cry don't
[1:44:23] manufacture one many of you are trying
[1:44:26] to manufacture and it is backfiring you
[1:44:29] are given professes that are failing you
[1:44:32] are working up emotions that are not
[1:44:33] working it is not your program when you
[1:44:37] behave like that you are taking the
[1:44:39] program out of the hand of God you are
[1:44:41] sin is too slow or is too late I love
[1:44:44] God tour on this program
[1:44:46] he's never Ledger's never gone brother
[1:44:49] Brahms I live a simple Christian life
[1:44:52] and watch more
[1:44:54] followed they are big grid unfolding
[1:44:59] friends hey man before you can come to
[1:45:03] such out of demonstration you must
[1:45:04] become the message you are to
[1:45:06] demonstrate amen
[1:45:08] it will not be cotton the message is
[1:45:10] again it to be caught in yourself come
[1:45:13] to a situation that you have power of
[1:45:15] his power
[1:45:16] what of his watch you are no longer
[1:45:19] saying does say the Lord
[1:45:20] it becomes according to my watch because
[1:45:23] the Prophet said when we are quoting we
[1:45:25] will be caught in ourselves Alleluia
[1:45:28] word of his word life of his life he
[1:45:32] said in fact she is and when the bride
[1:45:39] come to such a level of ripening watched
[1:45:42] the power of God and it's a promise
[1:45:44] friend it will come to pass but don't
[1:45:47] allow the devil on that the guise of
[1:45:49] being spiritual amen take you out of the
[1:45:53] blessing he did it to Sarah hey man he
[1:46:00] said this promise may be Abraham if you
[1:46:03] take agra maybe that promise may be true
[1:46:06] that way God would bring his promise to
[1:46:08] pass God doesn't need your help
[1:46:10] it doesn't mean resistance there is a
[1:46:13] timing for everything when he promised
[1:46:16] after Sarah's proposal wanted a gas they
[1:46:19] got an Ishmael they got a match they
[1:46:21] couldn't undo themselves they caught a
[1:46:26] wild man who's and will be upon every
[1:46:28] nation until today the Scriptures he
[1:46:31] fulfilling you've got them all
[1:46:34] everywhere you've got the book where I'm
[1:46:36] Zuccotti his who absolute God all this
[1:46:38] we as the orientation from from the
[1:46:40] descendants of Ishmael
[1:46:42] we will not fail to tell that regardless
[1:46:45] of who feel of an edge is too short to
[1:46:49] you and high that does say the Lord can
[1:46:51] never fail
[1:46:53] Ishmael was not a product of God's
[1:46:55] promise it was an attempt of man to come
[1:46:59] outside of God's program it was an
[1:47:02] attempt of man to work outside of God's
[1:47:05] timing for life and let me bring - God
[1:47:14] is a great farmer isn't it he gave you
[1:47:17] plants in season
[1:47:18] cultivating season spring season
[1:47:21] maturing season and a vest season is all
[1:47:24] right is all right
[1:47:25] but is God limited by those seasons can
[1:47:29] you not do everything in one day didn't
[1:47:32] approve we can do it when - five loaves
[1:47:35] a day man and a blessed and five loaves
[1:47:40] fed 5000 amen
[1:47:42] and seven loaves fed 4000 the professor
[1:47:46] do you understand what happened there
[1:47:49] within few hours which was planted
[1:47:53] within that hour with grew up with was
[1:47:57] cultivated with much worth with was
[1:47:59] arrested which was processed into flour
[1:48:02] which was built and it became bread all
[1:48:06] within split second in the hand of
[1:48:08] master Jesus only believe within split
[1:48:16] seconds Dustin's happened but this same
[1:48:19] one who can do it in those split seconds
[1:48:21] decided to give you seasons no matter
[1:48:26] how far science became they can never do
[1:48:28] what Jesus did they were still each
[1:48:32] day's my brother they will still need
[1:48:35] time my sister they say ok let us shot
[1:48:38] let us shorten you know the length at
[1:48:41] which misurkin matures from 9 months
[1:48:44] let's make it three to four months and
[1:48:46] what it is succeed in producing by that
[1:48:49] high bridge and what did I brought death
[1:48:54] it is the cause of all kind of genetic
[1:48:57] aproblem as you have today diseases an
[1:49:01] affliction because people are not ready
[1:49:04] to which according
[1:49:05] to the time of life and so spiritually
[1:49:11] speaking
[1:49:12] if you don't wait on God's timing for
[1:49:15] his program you only dead hand that if
[1:49:21] ever you think you want to invoke we
[1:49:22] only bring death nothing more nothing
[1:49:26] less
[1:49:28] do you see why some of the things the
[1:49:31] prophet knew before a preach marriage
[1:49:35] and divorce listen to my church the
[1:49:38] Prophet our understanding of marriage
[1:49:40] and divorce the fullest understanding at
[1:49:44] least three years by his own testimony
[1:49:47] before a procedure or two years the
[1:49:57] fullest of it revelation came when the
[1:49:59] sins were opened a man but God has been
[1:50:03] touching it for the Prophet and has been
[1:50:05] putting the puzzle together
[1:50:07] a man by led 63 and 64 had the complete
[1:50:13] revelation but why did he not British
[1:50:18] it was waiting for God's timing to bring
[1:50:24] that blessing because I said if it never
[1:50:27] waited for God's time it will do more
[1:50:30] harm than the good it was intended for
[1:50:33] are you catching it so time of life must
[1:50:37] be in that season of God's time in other
[1:50:40] to be a blessing now let me tell you
[1:50:43] charge the revealed mysteries and the
[1:50:45] blessings we have today do you know that
[1:50:47] Daniel saw it is the a doubt on that do
[1:50:54] you know that John saw it Daniel saw it
[1:50:59] it was forbidden to write John was
[1:51:02] allowed to write but he was forbidden to
[1:51:04] explain it was coming gradually Amen why
[1:51:13] God told him
[1:51:14] leave it till the time of the end is
[1:51:21] that Daniel you will go to your place
[1:51:24] don't worry what you have seen that I
[1:51:28] didn't allow you to write or author
[1:51:30] Israel as already bless you you will go
[1:51:34] into thy Lord is about the enter in the
[1:51:37] end time knowledge shall increase and
[1:51:40] Papa we run to and fro looking forward
[1:51:43] knowledge but in that time the wise
[1:51:48] shall watch understand so why didn't God
[1:51:54] allow it to be preached it must wait
[1:51:58] till God's timing did you get it - the
[1:52:05] hassling judge hallelujah the reason it
[1:52:09] wasn't given was because it must wait
[1:52:11] till cost Timon so time of life must be
[1:52:15] watched
[1:52:16] must be in that time of God in order to
[1:52:21] produce a blessing hallelujah let me
[1:52:25] begin to random by this when you take a
[1:52:29] woman's time of lifecycle of 28 days you
[1:52:35] will see a blessing in here
[1:52:37] they say for some women it could stretch
[1:52:40] to 35 days cycle does what science edge
[1:52:44] but the most normal is 28 days and the
[1:52:48] wonder prophet mentioned was 28 days now
[1:52:52] inside this 28 days there are only seven
[1:52:57] days in all that a woman can conceive if
[1:53:04] he stretches to 35 days cycle it could
[1:53:07] extend to ten days for conception are
[1:53:11] you following but I'm going to adopt the
[1:53:13] one the Prophet adopted 28 days amen
[1:53:17] because he has a reason for their
[1:53:19] adoption
[1:53:20] now this seven days inside
[1:53:23] these seven days three days are the most
[1:53:28] important it could fall to the beginning
[1:53:34] it could fall to the middle it go for to
[1:53:36] the end but because life could survive
[1:53:41] inside a woman for few days if he had an
[1:53:45] encounter with Mel within seven days
[1:53:48] that these three days are inside there
[1:53:52] is a possibility for what conception
[1:53:56] because the revelation the egg producing
[1:53:59] days of a woman in those seven days are
[1:54:03] just three days so if life was waiting
[1:54:08] before the egg drops their life that was
[1:54:11] waiting for that egg could survive two
[1:54:13] days if within two or three days egg
[1:54:18] drops that woman can conceive if it's in
[1:54:21] the time of God for her to do it and if
[1:54:26] the egg drops the eggs can also survive
[1:54:28] a day or two so if life comes after the
[1:54:32] egg drops it is still possible for
[1:54:34] conception to take place so all this
[1:54:38] drama of twenty-eight days can only be
[1:54:41] blessed within seven days by a three-day
[1:54:45] event did you catch that so the entire
[1:54:51] 28 days or a month of a woman's life
[1:54:54] look forward to only seven days amen so
[1:54:59] we can say seven days is the time of
[1:55:02] life season we are conception can
[1:55:05] technology if it's in that time of God
[1:55:09] or if it is God's time for that life to
[1:55:13] be made manifest upon the earth are we
[1:55:16] together is that clear to you
[1:55:18] alright let's bring it back amen
[1:55:22] do you know how the redemption plan of
[1:55:26] the brides of Jesus Christ the gentle
[1:55:30] bride of Jesus Christ we're just in
[1:55:32] seven days it was a seven day
[1:55:37] or seven dispensation aplan did you get
[1:55:40] that a dick a minute dispensation in
[1:55:43] God's economy so I'm preaching the
[1:55:45] scriptures
[1:55:46] amen amen when you say the day of the
[1:55:51] Lord the day of the Lord tell me when I
[1:55:52] sat on your Monday it's a period of
[1:55:56] God's dealing are you catching it so
[1:56:00] these seven days amen
[1:56:02] God was using nature is why the Prophet
[1:56:06] said I preached by nature I will do my
[1:56:10] preaching by types and by shadows amen
[1:56:13] I've just told you now that what
[1:56:16] happened the three angels that came down
[1:56:18] Abram and Sarah they were shadows
[1:56:20] hallelujah let's begin to fix the
[1:56:23] original Apostle Paul said amen
[1:56:27] they're without us cannot be perfected
[1:56:31] now II thought that the program we held
[1:56:35] in his own day is a right
[1:56:38] that was why feels like they were the
[1:56:40] capping of all things not knowing that
[1:56:43] God still has some six more days after
[1:56:46] the death of Paul of Ephesus amen
[1:56:49] so we are the one who rightly and fitly
[1:56:52] said today because we are in the final
[1:56:55] day the seventh day the seventh age Amen
[1:56:59] if you are still confused about the days
[1:57:02] let me put it back to you the professor
[1:57:04] the several feast days of Israel is a
[1:57:06] type of the seven Church edges how does
[1:57:10] an H become other say they become an age
[1:57:13] those are spiritual language languages
[1:57:17] are you following so it's a this day
[1:57:21] that we are living in because it is the
[1:57:24] day that fitted perfectly at the end
[1:57:26] amen it is the seventh day after number
[1:57:29] seven you go back toward to the
[1:57:32] beginning again Enoch was the seventh
[1:57:35] from Adam amen
[1:57:37] Enoch was one who took the rapture amen
[1:57:40] and that is our time we are the servants
[1:57:43] from the second Adam amen so this is the
[1:57:46] age that would take the rapture so we
[1:57:49] are the one
[1:57:50] actually owns the scripture day without
[1:57:53] us and not complete we are the
[1:57:55] perfection of the bright building of the
[1:57:59] Gentile hitch congratulate yourself
[1:58:04] Alleluia
[1:58:06] so we've got a seven days every other
[1:58:09] day look forward to these seven days
[1:58:12] this is my brother Brahm in the message
[1:58:15] horizon of the Sun he said that program
[1:58:18] is between the E and the Shi the program
[1:58:20] of redemption he is the Lord Jesus
[1:58:23] Christ
[1:58:24] she is you and hi-brite and his
[1:58:27] bridegroom Alleluia now it was only on
[1:58:31] this seventh day that the shadow of
[1:58:37] Genesis 18 perfectly came to his
[1:58:42] fulfillment three angels came down as
[1:58:47] usual amen
[1:58:50] looking for who for the Abraham's group
[1:58:53] again amen
[1:58:55] Abram who had suffered and you know buck
[1:59:00] would are not so many persecutions you
[1:59:03] know of doctrines you know mind
[1:59:06] pollutions and battles was wondering
[1:59:08] what to do it came up for a fresh air is
[1:59:14] fresh air to please by coming out of the
[1:59:18] door allowed this year you know Lassa
[1:59:23] Lassa if you are not spiritual you come
[1:59:25] follow me no don't look lost
[1:59:28] Amen Philadelphian age and age before
[1:59:31] lord isaiah was the age of open door is
[1:59:34] that right by the time you came into la
[1:59:37] decisión age it becomes the edge of a
[1:59:39] closed door
[1:59:40] they shot oh ha sight they shot Christ
[1:59:43] outside he said build I stand at the
[1:59:46] door whoever we get a fresh air most
[1:59:49] come out of the closed ossification the
[1:59:53] church was becoming a suffocation the
[1:59:56] pressure was getting so much that was
[1:59:58] where why you had
[2:00:00] that's great noise comment from among my
[2:00:04] people so you came out for watch a
[2:00:07] breath of fresh air and when you came
[2:00:12] out guess what you saw you saw the
[2:00:16] angels coming again ah just like Abram
[2:00:20] saw three men by window they were three
[2:00:23] michi even know they were three I mean
[2:00:28] to say I thought you a catcher dad I can
[2:00:31] see them resistant at every spiritual
[2:00:35] people amen
[2:00:36] even though they were three yet the
[2:00:40] Abraham's group knew who is on God who
[2:00:44] is on messenger was is that right the
[2:00:51] new era robot wasn't sent to them the
[2:00:55] new Billy Graham wasn't sent to them
[2:00:57] they got a message no doubt and their
[2:01:01] message as a project and their message
[2:01:04] as a way it will be disseminated and
[2:01:07] their message as is own audience that it
[2:01:10] will attract but then know that there
[2:01:13] must be a peculiar messenger meant only
[2:01:16] for the Abraham's group and never in
[2:01:20] history since the time of Abraham
[2:01:23] have we had messengers with Vietnam and
[2:01:26] in H am than in this day it wasn't a
[2:01:34] coincidence
[2:01:35] it was to announce the closing of time
[2:01:40] but Graham Graham came with six letters
[2:01:44] six is the number of man amen
[2:01:48] but there was another who came with
[2:01:51] several letters and ending ham halt so
[2:01:54] that wasn't a coincidence that was
[2:01:57] Branham that was the one sent to the
[2:02:00] Abraham's group Abram has seven letters
[2:02:04] Brom has seven letters hallelujah
[2:02:09] they all came out at the same time amen
[2:02:13] one to the Evangel occurs one to the
[2:02:16] protestin some fundamentals and one to
[2:02:18] the bright of Jesus Christ we know our
[2:02:21] messenger brethren amen
[2:02:24] the risen brother Brom couldn't prosper
[2:02:26] so much with them despite the fact that
[2:02:28] it was one that did the greatest number
[2:02:31] of miracles and the highest level among
[2:02:33] them was because it wasn't sent to them
[2:02:36] it was sent to us when people are
[2:02:40] annoyed that you quoted brother Brown or
[2:02:43] you are quoting him don't fight them
[2:02:45] it's possible that it wasn't sense to
[2:02:48] them amen but orders only was sent to it
[2:02:53] is not a sacrilege it is a joy amen
[2:02:59] to coach the message because when we are
[2:03:02] caught in the message William Brown
[2:03:04] never represented himself he brought the
[2:03:06] Ministry of Christ the reincarnated
[2:03:10] Ministry of Jesus Christ but to you and
[2:03:13] I so what did that messenger said when
[2:03:19] it came to Sarah is that I will visit
[2:03:22] you according to what that time of life
[2:03:26] so if this messenger a man will come and
[2:03:30] is this to fulfill that Genesis 18 to
[2:03:33] you and I what is it to announce to the
[2:03:36] bride I will visit you according to that
[2:03:39] time of life why didn't that visitation
[2:03:44] come before now because it was in time
[2:03:48] amen
[2:03:50] the visitation of time of life must be
[2:03:53] in the time of God that was right Daniel
[2:03:57] could not have done it amen don't worry
[2:04:00] Oh sir brother okay that was right
[2:04:02] Daniel could not have done it that was
[2:04:04] right John could not have done it it has
[2:04:07] to take a william branham to do that for
[2:04:10] you and i in the season of god's time
[2:04:14] and watch those three days again in
[2:04:18] these last seven days
[2:04:20] amen justification dropped
[2:04:25] sanctification dropped amen baptism of
[2:04:29] the Holy Ghost dropped in order to do us
[2:04:32] in other to materialize and reproduce
[2:04:35] Christ again on two feet
[2:04:39] did you catch that Christ must be
[2:04:44] reproduced again on two feet the world
[2:04:50] must become flesh amen that Christ that
[2:04:55] walk through the streets of Jerusalem
[2:04:56] must be expressed perfectly in the body
[2:05:01] of some people and that is the reason
[2:05:03] for the three days amen
[2:05:06] so justification came sanctification
[2:05:09] came it dropped a life amen
[2:05:13] now before those realized a skin
[2:05:17] efficient age started as watch if it's
[2:05:20] an age started as a great light but
[2:05:24] don't forget that lights couldn't retain
[2:05:27] itself is that a dwindling only when it
[2:05:31] came to the middle age the what age
[2:05:33] there was no more light again almost
[2:05:36] it was almost complete darkness did you
[2:05:39] catch that so if the edges of the
[2:05:42] Gentile ended at that time nothing much
[2:05:46] was achieved it shows that we started
[2:05:49] and we degenerated are you catching it
[2:05:52] before there to be a generation again
[2:05:56] hallelujah for there to be an ascension
[2:05:59] again for there to be a rapture like it
[2:06:03] was before
[2:06:05] a fizzle started with the rapture of
[2:06:06] Christ under sense they are must beat
[2:06:09] these last three days otherwise Christ
[2:06:14] will have lost in his arrest
[2:06:17] amen you see why the professor is the
[2:06:21] Alpha and what Omega what he planted
[2:06:25] what is started with in Ephesus the only
[2:06:28] time it can get it imperfection will be
[2:06:31] on the last day did you catch that
[2:06:36] this is why these three days of seat
[2:06:39] dropping was important and is started by
[2:06:44] dropping justification pure it came
[2:06:48] again dropped scientific asian then they
[2:06:52] came again he dropped watch Holy Ghost
[2:06:54] baptism amen
[2:06:56] and only Ghost baptism produced what
[2:06:59] adoption amen
[2:07:02] the full stature of Jesus Christ again
[2:07:05] just as it was in the beginning so the
[2:07:09] Alpha indeed became the homemaker the
[2:07:12] condom was planted in the beginning
[2:07:14] became the condoms arrested in several
[2:07:18] folds are the hinge so this end time is
[2:07:21] the time of life again
[2:07:24] Alleluia but the seat that Jam couldn't
[2:07:30] be dropped to materialize in the womb of
[2:07:33] your heart in order to produce Christ
[2:07:36] again amen until will eat the season of
[2:07:40] God to to H and this is why the message
[2:07:44] of the hour with H still this time
[2:07:46] friends when you feed on that message it
[2:07:50] begins to work in your body because it
[2:07:53] is your visitation it is the Sarah's
[2:07:57] visitation again to bring forth the
[2:07:59] promise on that is why you can never
[2:08:02] fellowship under this reveal world and
[2:08:04] your life remain the same again there
[2:08:07] must be a change from glory to glory
[2:08:09] until you come to a stature Amen that
[2:08:13] you can say the life an olive is no
[2:08:16] longer me but Christ doing his walk and
[2:08:19] when the church comes to that perfection
[2:08:21] your perfection will provoke
[2:08:24] resurrection
