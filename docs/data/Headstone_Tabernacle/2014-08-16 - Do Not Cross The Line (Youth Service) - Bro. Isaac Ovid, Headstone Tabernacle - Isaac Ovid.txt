TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there is none like you no one else can touch my heart like you do I can search for all eternity long and fine there is none like you with every hand raise oh there is none like you and no one else no one else can touch my heart like you do I can search for all eternity long and find there is none like you there is none oh there is none like you no one else oh I can search all eternity long and find there is none like you everybody sing with your hands lifted up oh there is none that's it like you Hallelujah glory to God no one else can touch my heart like you do oh I can search Eternity long and find there is none like you give the Lord a hand to praise this evening oh blessed be the name of the Lord give him glory give him honor thank him for being alive thank him for being in the house of God thank him for being in his presence thank him to have breath to have the energy to have something on the inside and brought you here tonight to hear from God Amen blessed be the name of the Lord how many appreciate brother Andrew amen how many appreciate brother stepen with the music amen wonderful what I like to welcome you all in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated for a minute it's certainly a great honor to be in the house of God tonight for this special youth service and I believe it's truly a special service for all of us and I know that God is going to do something tremendous in the lives of the young people here tonight you know and uh some of you may already have seen it on our Facebook account but I put up the inspiration for this hug service so that you can meditate on it even before you reach here you know and in this world that we're living in the enemy is on the attack and we have a choice we allow the enemy to gain ground or we push the enemy back and we gain ground so I believe that the time has come for us to gain ground and do whatever is in our power to make a difference to make a change I'm tired of seeing young people just backslide I'm tired of seeing young people just give up hope I'm tired of seeing young people just move wherever the wind blows them and I believe the time has come for us to fight and for us to fight back so I encourage you for a long time I am also guilty in a sense of blasting Facebook and there are many things about Facebook that I don't like there are many things about Facebook that I still want to blast but there are also some positive State as well I always say a knife can be used to cut piece of meat or cut bread and but the bread that same knife could be used to kill somebody so in a certain sense is about how you use the tools that are available to us and I believe that our Facebook page is a way for us particularly the young people to be kept a breast of what's going on and to have the opportunity to express yourself some of you are too afraid to testify and stand up and talk about Jesus but at least you could put a comment and say I love Jesus somebody say Amen am amen so um everybody feeling fine amen everybody feeling on fire amen everybody come to give the devil problems no matter what situation you came through how you felt this week what happened all of that doesn't matter right now we come to to to to do what we need to do for us to be where we need to be can the church say Amen so I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome all the visitors in our midst Welcome to The Headstone Tabernacle all who are here for the first time we love you we appreciate you thank you for making it out special welcome to everyone here and special greetings to all of you young people who came out today it it is it is a sacrifice it is an effort but I believe God will bless you for that sacrifice and that effort somebody say amen amen amen so before we even get to the message tonight I found this quote and I thought I'd read it even before I read the scripture and I want you to think on this in a message making the valley full of ditches but the brandom said show me your company and I'll tell you who you are let me walk into your house let me see what's laying over on the table let me see how the Bible's marked up let me see where it's all true two stories let me listen to what kind of music you're playing on your radio let me see what kind of pictures you got in your house I'll tell you what you're made out of yes sir that's what your Soul's that's what your soul is feeding on regardless of what your testimony is your fruits prove what you are that's right oh it's the truth your soul feeds on something and whatever the characteristic of your soul is that is what it'll show forth that's the reason Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them somebody say amen amen and if tonight you think I'm going to do all the work you got to twist it tonight you have to be on fire tonight you have to worship I am becoming more radical about Jesus I have a problem where the world is becoming more expressive of what they stand for and what they believe and we as Christians we want to be quiet and hide when we have the gold when we have the precious elements when we have the best thing that there is we can't hide it under Abell this light has got to shine out can the church say Amen so let's stand to our feet and let's go to the scripture this evening let's go to one scripture tonight reading from Isaiah 55 reading verse 6 and the Bible says seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon shall we bow our heads for word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy Lord that has been extended to us as young people and Lord God as we pause father from the routine of life from the hustle and the bustle from working to pay the bills from working to to to accomplish the dreams and the vision that we might have Lord from going to school trying to learn from doing whatever it is we do during the time in the week we have taken this pause this saah this rest Lord to commune with you to hear a word that could bring transformation to our lives to wake us up to a true realization of what we are born for what we are called to do Lord any man could read a scripture but it takes the Holy Spirit to breathe life upon it may you speak to your people here tonight and bring permanent change in their lives we are a needy people tonight father we have so many conditions in this room this evening father people who are bound Lord with lust father bound with Lord evil bound with lying and jealousy and and envy and Malice and hatred and strife father Lord we come against it all tonight Lord in the name of Jesus Christ father Lord Lord may you lift the weariness the tiredness the depression the feeling of loneliness the feeling of being lost and confused father and may you build a faith father Lord as we hear the word May the faith Banks Eyes Lord until the people can leave here shouting and rejoicing knowing that they are born for such a time as this may you speak to your people Lord may you break the chains of sin May the house of Hell give way to the name of Jesus father may you anoint me tonight and anoint your people let a holy spirit move in this house tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ bless the word the reading of the word and bless your people in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated so for a title tonight my title is do not cross the line that's my title tonight do not cross the line my subject seek ye the Lord while he may be found and my inspiration time no longer and I took my title from a quote at brother brandham uh in a message but brandom spoke called the deity of Jesus Christ and I want you to listen carefully I'm not going to be too long with you tonight but it's to pay close attention but the brandom said father we come this morning and I say this evening as your humble children I realize that we are living in the last hour closing time something can happen at any time men women boys or girls here are without God and I pray thee father you be merciful I pray thee to be merciful to those who have received and now realize that you are near in their hearts and I re and realizing that little things of the world through cares I pray God that every one of them this morning will be really consecrated to you for the coming days to come and how much longer we are going to wait before your coming we believe it's right at hand now and after a while listen carefully they're going to try to get saved and listen this is where I get it from and this is brother brandom man it it struck me it it it it interrupted my sleep last night and brother Bram said I'm thinking of those young people that night down there at the altar trying to be saved but had crossed the line No Redemption for them they were gone could not be saved I'll read it again I'm thinking of those young people that night down there at the altar trying to be saved but had crossed the line No Redemption for them they were gone could not be saved and from that I took a title do not cross the line my heart is heavy tonight it's burdened by what's happening all around us but the brandham said in a message influence what we see happen should put every soul into action it should make a church that would make a Revival young people that Revival is up to us every single one of us here tonight and I'm troubled tonight because there's a great Falling Away Hallelujah there are people who were once rejoicing and you can't find them anymore people who were once happy about being with the Lord and you can't find them anymore there's a great Falling Away HJ it comes as no surprise to us because brother brandham told us this was going to happen he spoke of a thinning out of a falling away of people walking away from their first love but even though we know that this was supposed to happen it still doesn't take away the pain when you see your young brother or young sister suffer under the task under the whip of the Taskmaster somebody say amen and I know that they are young people here who are on fire for God you're pressing on you're giving it your all you're doing your best you're trying your best you have made it in your mind that you're going to serve God no matter what I know there have some young people here who are holding on you might have your ups and downs you might have your questions and you're wondering but there's something on the inside that that brings you and I salute you and I give glory to God for keeping you give the Lord a hand of Praise I know there are some young people here who are willing to fight a good fight they're willing to leave it all behind and forsake all they want to serve Jesus amen but I also know that there are some young people here tonight and some young people who would hear this tape who are living on the edge they are standing on the edge of a line that they don't even know exists wake up tonight friends standing on the edge of a line that you don't even realize is even there tonight we're going to speak about that line and if it's five words that you remember from this service is do not cross the line a line is used to divide an area of space a line helps you to understand boundaries and limitations Aline helps maintain balance and Order almighty God created a heavens and the Earth and he put a line between them to separate them somebody help me this evening amen a line does not always have to be visible countries go to war because of a line that separates one country from another sometime that line you can see it but they go to war because they feel you crossed into their territory because you cross a line that maybe you didn't even realize was there somebody help me people die because of lines that they cannot even see how many young men go to war for a country because they crossed a territory and they didn't even know that line was there young people tonight there are some lines that are safe to cross amen but there are also some lines that are not safe to cross Whenever there is a nuclear meltdown Whenever there is chemical exposure Whenever there is a viral outbreak a line is set up listen carefully to keep those who have been not affected from becoming affected everybody with me that's the line I'm speaking about tonight Young Brother young sister because I believe a line has been set up to keep those who have not been affected from becoming affected amen it's very serious tonight friends because if you cross that line there is no cure amen if you cross the line there is no hope if you cross the line line there is no coming back friends Young Brother young sister do not cross the line Amen in brother bram's words he said for those who cross the line No Redemption for them they were gone could not be saved where are you standing tonight amen if you are trying to live on the edge make sure that you do not cross the line this line we are speaking about church separates the Lord's Side from the devil sides yes there are only two sides tonight and you must know where you are standing tonight friends you might be surprised young people how many other young people have already sold their souls to the devil if you don't know it witchcraft is in high schools in junior high schools in the kindergarten and young people have already sold their soul to the devil because they want to be successful and they want to pass an examination and they want to get into this University there is Darkness all over the world it might surprise you to know how many of the entertainers and the singers and the musicians have sold their souls to the devil they have crossed that line they have already crossed a line and there is no salvation for them there is no mercy for them this is definitely not one of those shout for Joy Services friends it is a message of warning that you do not cross the line the Bible tells us in second Peter 3 the Lord is not slack concerning his promises as some men count slackness but is long suffering to us in other words he'll wait for us not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance so God is waiting hoping that every single person here tonight would come to repent come to turn their lives around come to change the way you walk change the way you talk change the way you act but then the Bible goes on but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night you don't know it's coming cuz if you know the thief is coming you look out for him but it'll come as a thief in the night in which the Heavens will pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up listen carefully seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved everything around you will be dissolved amen everybody paying attention everybody listening carefully everybody focused on what is being said tonight seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness what do you spend your time talking about how do you spend your time expressing yourself where is the bulk of your time spent that's why I opened with that quote where brother brandham says show me what you listen to show me who your friends are show me what you're doing and I'll see how close you are to that line amen amen the closer you are to the edge the further you are from God too many of us we walking along the edge of that line and we are in danger of crossing the line tonight but we are seeing do not cross that line tonight run away from the line and run back into the safe territory run back to God run to Jesus Christ tonight somebody say Amen I believe that this message tonight is a final warning to those who will hear it there is no excuse tonight you know there are some people who just like to do what they want to do you know they might see a no entry sign on the street and maybe it's a street you lived your entire life and maybe you went out for the weekend perhaps and you went and spent a couple days in too and Monday morning you're driving back home and you come to your street you live there you know this street you know the neighborhood you come back home and you come to your street and you see a no entry sign and instead of you ask why it's there you say who put this sign here and because you feel you know it's your street you just drive down the street because in your mind you tell yourself somebody made a mistake and put the no entry sign on the street and you didn't realize that earlier that morning some virus broke out on that street and and that sign was a warning to you to keep you off of the street anybody with me tonight do not cross the line don't do your own thing tonight I'm not talking about the line that separates families and churches and friends I'm talking about the line that is a separation between worshiping God and worshiping the devil because if you're not worshiping God you automatically worshiping the devil and brother brandham taught us you could worship anything because God is the object of worship and whatever you spend your time doing becomes your God you could worship your car you could worship your house you could worship your job you could worship your neighbor you could worship anything because that's where you spend your time and your effort but the God I serve is a jealous God he doesn't want anybody to share worship with him he wants all your worship all your praise all the honor all the glory because you couldn't even be here tonight if it wasn't for his grace if it wasn't for his love if it wasn't for his Mercy can the church say Amen Give the Lord a hand of praise tonight this message is to rock your world tonight it's to change the way you live it's to change the way you talk it it change the way you act because I'm I've said it so many times when I read a quote a couple weeks ago where brother brandham was saying people keep telling him they're tired of hearing him say certain things and brother bram's response was I'm tired of seeing you do the same things because the moment you stop doing these things I'll have a reason to stop saying it but if you keep doing the wrong thing I'm going to keep saying it until it sticks or you decide you want to cross the line permanently but we are going to have a perfect Church we're going to have a church full of the Holy Ghost going to have a church that sin cannot stay in that church somebody say Amen you may not understand everything tonight and I'm trying to bring it as simple as possible that a two-year-old could understand amen amen and preach it back amen tonight I say unto you do not cross the line on this side friends where we at right now on this side in this presence in the word of God there's joy there's peace there's a holy ghost but on that other side of this line that we're talking about is weeping wailing and nashing of teeth amen what side do you want to be on Young Brother young sister how long will you play with God and entertain the enemy we're going to say some hard things tonight but it is to bring Deliverance to you so that you can receive the Holy Ghost that's what this servic is for for you to clean up your house so that the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire can come into your heart the Holy Ghost is not going to come and sit down on the snake in your heart we're here to fire bom the snake with the word of God tonight somebody say Amen I'm trying to preach as hard as I could I said in maraval a couple weeks ago I'm guilty of not preaching hard enough Hallelujah and he to preach harder you need to shake things up some more because the enemy is not holding back the devil is not playing games he wants your soul he wants to kill you so we have a reason tonight to fight for every Young Brother fight for every young sister so you could be delivered and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and live this message of Brother brandham live this message of Malachi 4 I don't care what condition you came in here tonight give God praise give God glory we going to have this place so hot your sinful nature you'll be repenting at the door before you even come in here because the Holy Ghost will be in this place somebody say Amen if you want to mess with the world and you don't on God that's your business but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord do not cross the line don't give up your Birthright don't give up your inheritance you are called for such a time as this somebody say amen that's what we are here for we're not here to play Church to play games I didn't drive all the way from Belmont to come here to sit and just watch you I came to see the devil running out of this island running from in the church running from your life when you go home they must wonder what happened to you and you must be able to say I met Jesus somebody say Amen how long will you live on the edge friends it's dangerous trying to live on the edge amen I'm not telling you to walk around with a picture of of of the Bible on your back and and try to hold five Bibles so you could prove a point but I'm saying have a testimony live a life don't be ashamed of this gospel the people in the world they do what they want to do amen Hallelujah they identify with what they want to identify with all the time I spent in prison I saw young people who had their identification around them all the time if they're in a gang all their colors show the gang colors all the gang symbols everything to identify that's where their heart was at and you don't want to be identified with eternal life and you don't want to be identified with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you want to please some boy some girl some friend some neighbor with their foolishness when they're going to hell and play games with this Gospel of Jesus Christ what's wrong with you do not cross the line tonight huj Hallelujah somebody say Amen tonight I will say to you what your father never said to you what your mother never said to you what your teacher never said to you and I'm speaking for heaven tonight do not make the mistake and cross the line because you'll be finished if I'm not making it clear enough you help me wave your hand and let me know make it harder make it tougher make it rougher so now I'm clearing yeah so that when I see you doing your nonsense I could say weren't you in church don't you know better than them how long the Bible says will you be slack concerning the promises how long will you live double-minded some of you in here tonight you are wasting your time I'm telling you straight because you plan to go and do some foolishness tonight or tomorrow or the next day don't waste my time don't waste God's time I'm not here for that I want to talk to people who want God who want reality who want to see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is there anybody in the house who wants to see the same God wrote the word manifest the word in your life if that's how you feel stand to your feet right now you may be seated we had a full house that's wonderful so I'm preaching to the right group tonight everybody stood up if somebody kept sitting now was going to call the deacons right away clear them out they don't belong here amen hallelujah Glory we going to have church or no church at all can the church say amen amen amen that's why the scripture we read said seek ye the Lord while he may be found in other words it's coming a time when you'll be looking for God and you'll be knocking and crying out but he will not answer because time will be up friends we are running out of time why because eternity is getting ready to take over time is temporary only eternity is eternal amen can the church say amen amen friends the fact that you are here tonight means that you have come too far to backslide Hallelujah you have come too far to give up amen you have come too far to quit amen it's the devil's job to tell you to quit and you know what the problem is friends you see this line we're preaching about tonight if you spend too much of your time living on the edge you're going to hear all the voices from on the other side of this line right but if you come away from the line you're going to hear a whole different kind of conversation because behind you is a host of the angels and the Lord himself and there's power and the word and the anointing when you step away from this line into the presence of God every day gets deeper the more you in the word the more you in prayer the more in the spirit as you come away from the line your walk begins to change your talk begins to change can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah so if you want to shut up the negative voices what do you got to do come away from the line there are some friends you must never talk to again that's right is that clear enough am no conversation no explanation just don't answer the phone is that rude no cut them off amen because if that voice is not driving you to heaven it's going to drive it to hell it's only two options amen is that clear enough but I want to tell them nicely that I can't talk to them to tell them what to give them the opportunity to get you to try to explain yourself you know who you are you don't need to explain yourself your father is the king your father owns a cattle in a thousand hills when your father snaps his fingers the clouds begin to move the sky begins to roll back somebody say Amen do you know who you are do you know where you come from do you know where you're going do you know what your promise is do you know what you are born to do in such a time as this somebody say Amen maybe you never heard preaching like this before we're not crazy they already tested me I passed I am crazy about God you got to be crazy about something yes you got to be crazy about something something you might as well be crazy about God cuz this world brother Bram said is going totally insane so if the whole world is going insane I want to go insane for Jesus let me talk about Jesus let me laugh about Jesus let me walk in the street talking to myself seeing the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting his goodness endureth forever surely goodness and mercy shall follow me let me be called crazy for being identified with the God who made Heaven and the Earth somebody's say amen amen how we doing tonight am trying to find myself so H I already went ahead of my notes I have you yes and no you've been coming to church and you've listened to all the services and the ministers but the reality is too many of us are hearing the voices from the other side of the line more than on this side of the line friends you come to church on a Sunday a few hours maybe you come in the midweek service I understand maybe you finish work so late by the time you get your service is over okay but that's why there is a library that's why there's a website that's why there are resources so that you have no excuse to miss a service it is your responsibility when you can be here to be here there is no excuse for not being here when you physically could be here if you physically cannot be here that's what the website and the library and all the other things are foren because if it's two Services a week maybe three services and a prayer meeting maybe you spend all the other hours of your day hearing these voices why don't change CH your shoes why don't cut your hair why don't wear this chain why don't try this drink why I don't do this listen you hear the new Beyonce song you didn't hear it well I not really supposed to listen to No I know you're not really supposed to listen to No but just just listen like 2 minutes and before you know it by let me resume that song still in your head isn't that right the voes of the world is all around you you're driving your car you see the sign on the street bum bed the music the fashion the style is all around you but you are not from this world so you have to shield and protect yourself by doing what stepping away from that line the problem is when you live on the edge and you want to please the people in your circle that's why brother brandham said you want the Holy Ghost spend time with people who have the Holy Ghost because your conversation will be different your behavior will be different your attitude and action this life is not about what you do when you're in service everybody here looking Christian right now everybody here looking looking very very holy very Sanctified I can't look at you and see anything else the problem happens when you leave this place and you in the workplace and all of a sudden forget it your words change you know you know here you say bless Jesus God bless bless you I'm blessed that's highly favored you have all these you know these phrases this too blessed to be stressed you have all these nice phrases when somebody ask you how are you doing I'm too blessed to be stressed really when they get to work and they ask you how you doing that's not what they saying I'm challenging you tonight step away from the edge because if you spend too much time on the edge you are at the risk of crossing the line somebody say Amen this message friends is a call to action let these five words be your Anthem if anybody asks you about this youth service you have five words to give them do not cross the line let these five words be your battlecry let these five words be your inspiration do not cross the line listen to brother brandham in a message beginning and ending of the the Gentile dispensation but the brandom said here now a man is permitted to travel so far but there's a separating line between life and death he must never cross that see you can go on with your little foolishness for a while but you better know where the line is can the church say amen and we are making clear tonight that this line is being drawn out so that you know that you got to change your walk change your talk but brandom goes on did the Lord ever check you on anything he does all of us pull the check reins say say that's fine enough now then you had better watch what you're doing from then on if you're stepping across towards that line so don't take this light friends don't take this light today August 16th is the most important day of your life I read a statement this week the two most important days in your life are the days one that you were born and the second the day you find out why and I pray that today is the day you find out why you were born what your purpose is what you are called to do and that you have to be in the presence of God for the word of God to be manifested in your life that you could live this thing out what good do it do to gain the whole world and lose your soul I see so many young people I have it written my later who go to university and they go to school and they try to become this or that and they lose their salvation they lose their soul they lose their desire for God they were on fire and they allow a little degree a little certificate a little education to turn them away completely a little job they pray Lord give me a job help me get a job Lord give me a job when they get a job you can't see them in church Lord give me a car give me a car so I can drive to church when they get the car they by the beach can't see them in church is the truth why they were always living too close to the edge friends the only way you could backslide is to be on the edge you know that's why brother over always says when you backslide it's not because yesterday something happened it's all along you were just walking towards the line until one day you just kept doing what you were doing and you end up crossing the line and when you cross that line there's no way back right can the church say Amen so tonight we're saying that's far enough if you've been moving towards the line August 16 2014 is the day you realize that you were doing the wrong thing and it's time to back up it's time to come away from the line can the church say Amen Give the Lord a hand of praise tonight when your friends in school call you to hang out do not cross the line when your friends tell to wear this wear that try this try that do not cross the line when your friends send you a picture to put up as your profile on Facebook do not cross the line when you go to the mall do not cross the line friends you have to know what your weakness is there was a brother many years ago he was delivered from alcohol he was a drinker but whenever he drove you know around Barataria or M around they have the brewery whenever he drove there like the scent of it the memories just hit him and for a while he had to like catch himself because that was his weakness that's why the message said you got to die and rot die is when you you you just you know you get control of not doing it but rot is when the desire comes completely out of you so he died out to he because able to resist it but it didn't rot completely because when he came into the environment if you leave him too long you have to drive there fast if you have a traffic jam you have a problem if you have a traffic jam you might lose him so you have to know what if I could use the word your Kryptonite is is they say Superman have a cryptonite well this is service tonight boy read Superman if you know Superman had Kryptonite which is his weakness the thing that affected him you have to know what your Kryptonite is some of us we have different cryptonite some of us is the music forget it when did he release a track WKA flocker I know all of them two chains you name it when the new mixtape come out forget it you can't find you in church for two weeks when it's the Grammys or the Oscar and you watch the outfit that's it you there losting after the outfit you wish you could wear that dress know if your mother only go away for a week you're wearing it the hair side everybody have their own cryp Tonight the music the fashion did this did that whatever it is the movies the shows the books whatever it is you you have to know how to protect yourself from it because that's what keeps you on the edge of the line and listen but the brandom says the devil is entitled to that punch you know so if he knows what your weakness is you don't you have to understand the devil will inspire Beyond to sing a song just for you you know when she trying to make a platinum record for the world is you are the target you want you yes you so if you know you're Kryptonite but the brandom said it like this the devil will only attack your weak spot that's right so if you know it's your weak spot you have to close all the gaps in your life to protect you somebody say amen and the safest thing to do is come away from that line that's why I says some of you need to take your cell phone tonight and either throw it in the trash or delete all the contacts of people who know you change your phone number defriend people on Facebook I learned that this week because you don't want them to be a friend anymore this is rough no this is not rough this is you protecting your soul someone that's precious to you why you do not want to cross the line somebody say amen amen everybody getting this tonight well I'm talking about lying so many by the grace of God tonight when you see any kind of line you'll remember this message I wrote it in my notes when you see a Clos line you say do cross the line I wanted to be so real to you that you say I ain't crossing any kind of line so tangible this must become to you tonight forgive me tonight if I don't sound too deep or too spiritual I could have brought a message tonight a deep message but I thank God for the ministry of the spirit to rightly divide a word we need to hear tonight because I've come to the realization we have a lot of people in the message who are not really saved they are not saved because if they were saved they wouldn't be behaving how they behave they would not be acting how they act their only claim is they're in the message that's why you can't judge a group or a church by the Believers you have to judge it by the word you have to judge how the ministers stay with the word as revealed by God's Prophet can the church say amen amen you know this quote from a message angels of the Covenant brother kman in 1981 said and you young people the devil is telling you that you didn't taste the world yet wait a little longer and you keep waiting and you're going to wind up in the tribulation period in hell because there ain't no more time yet no more time left time no longer the day you hear my voice hard or not your young hearts I'm not going to be too much longer with you friends if you cross the line you can't get the Holy Ghost if you cross the line you can be adopted if you cross the line there's no Rapture for you so many people have allowed situations in their lives to lead them to doubt God to doubt the prophit to doubt the Bible to doubt the message of the hour don't make that mistake friends do not cross the line Daniel had a choice he prayed so much that they say let's make a law that whoever pray in whatever way that's not how we want them to we'll thr them in the Lions then he had a choice he could have crossed that line in his day and given up on what he believed but he held his ground the three Hebrew boys had a choice they could have crossed the line like everybody else but it said we will not bow down God give us some more young people who will not cross the line and give up what is the truth and what is Right friends crossing the line is a choice you have a choice tonight brother brandom in the message God's provided way and I had put this up on our Facebook page earlier this week but the bandam said it's not necessary that any man would go to hell and God don't send no one to hell he said you send yourself to Hell God's done everything in the world he can to put you from going to keep you from going to hell and yet you determined to go to hell you fight over every barricade God puts in your way you just go right on over it I don't believe in this I don't believe in this I don't believe in this I don't believe a car cut me here I don't believe a car wear this pants I don't I do this I don't believe I listen to the music is a tan going through why I listen love song I don't believe but the BAM said now there's a red light here in the city and it turns red and green that tells you when you can stop and go if you run it well don't blame the city they put the light up there for your protection but if you run on through it that's up to you it's you you you you brought your own judgment friends today come back into the presence of God come away from that line tonight it's always a choice it is a choice tonight God is not going to choose for you young brother young sister brother brandham taught us that in the Year of Jubilee you could go free if you want to go free anybody knows that in the Year of Jubilee what was yours had to come back to you in the year of the devil had to let you go we know this but brother brandham also taught us that there was a choice there was a line if you cross that line you were saying to the slave owner you don't want to be free your air was pierced as a sign that you had crossed the line there was no Redemption for you you were gone you could not be saved the Jubilee trumpet could be sounding right next to you but you had crossed the line it no longer apply to you I warn you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ do not cross the line we always preach about the Jubilee about being free but what about those who crossed the line it was said that the slave owners tried different ways to encourage the slaves to stay and I can't help but wonder if those those who crossed the line those who chose to stay I wonder if they had any regrets imagine for all their lives they lived knowing a jubilee was coming they lived knowing that there was hope they lived knowing that there was a possibility that they could be free and Friends it is the possibilities and the hopes that give us a reason to live it is the possibility that this Mortal could put on immortality that keeps us coming to church it is the possibility that you don't have to be sick anymore that keeps you coming here but the brandom said missing limbs will be restored there's a possibility if you're missing a hand or missing a leg it could be restored because that's the God we serve it is the possibilities and hopes that keeps us going and the greatest hope which is Christ in you the hope of glory so friends the slaves for their entire lives they had lived with the purpose that could only come with knowing that one day they could be free but as the so far the trumpet of the Jubilee is sounded now they have a choice and I believe the trumpet is sounding tonight for some of you young people and you have the same choice friends as I was meditating on this message I'm writing I say it is difficult to understand it is difficult why after being forced to be a slave you would now choose willingly to be one and friends in our case it is because Adam fell in sin that we were born in sin we had no control over our birth but why would you willingly choose to stay in sin when you could be born again why would you willingly want to do the same thing keep the same on life when there's power in the name of Jesus to break Every Chain to take that evil out of you to give you the Holy Ghost and Fire to give you a new walk a new talk a new life a living faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and charity I can't figure out but after being a slave for their entire lives when Freedom was now made available without money without price they would choose to continue to live the same way they had been living by doing what by crossing the line from Life unto death but the brandham said in the message the 10 virgin and the 144,000 brother the brandham said what do you mean brother the brandham listen carefully if you hear the gospel truth and you refuse to walk in it then God marks your air where you'll never hear it no more more you have crossed the line between life and death then you'll go on with your organization your denomination the rest of your days forever so friends it's a warning to every one of us to change how we live not what we talk but change how we live for message this day the scripture is fulfilled brother brand said what a perfect example it is of the Gospel of Jesus Christ when it's preached the acceptable time and the time of Jubilee anybody no matter who you are what color you are what denomination you belong to how far you have stooped in sin or what's wrong with you you can go free when you hear the gospel trumpet sound out you are free but listen but if you turn your back upon the message and refuse to hear it notice you are Bor in your air with an oil that means to say that you have crossed the line between grace and judgment and you will never hear the gospel again you'll never get any further you must be a slave to the system you're in the rest of your days if you refuse to hear the acceptable year friends tonight the holy spirit is speaking tonight you know brother oid spoke to me I believe early this morning and he was asking me what type of response I expect to get from the young people and I said to him brother if it's one person comes tonight I will preach as hard as I can to that one person because I believe that there's one person here there's always one person who God is going to speak and arrest your lives you make sure you be that one person tonight you make sure you are that one person if there's one person to make their calling and election sure you be that one person tonight to make the choice I have decided to follow Jesus no turning back no turning back the holy spirit is speaking tonight the holy spirit is doing something tonight listen to what brother bam said listen carefully because for you to grow in God you have to know exactly what the word says but Bram says in a message greater than Solomon is here and when you see the Holy Spirit doing something like he's doing right now and you make fun of it you play games with it you take it lightly you take it for granted listen you have crossed the line that you'll never cross back again it'll never be forgiven you so friends this is very serious tonight it's a time of decision for every single one of us here I'm about to close I'm on my last page but this even can get ready to come up in a message God's power to transform brother the brandham said that's thus sayth God's holy word if we disbelieve willfully in other words you make a choice after what you heard tonight if you choose after this message tonight if we disbelieve willfully after we have seen it and heard it then we are cross the line there'll be never no more forgiveness for it you have crossed the line oh you say God still blesses me butam said oh yeah but the BAM said remember Israel the Border Lines when God gave them a promise over in the Holy Land in the land it was good of milk and honey when Moses sent out Caleb and Joshua and the spies to go and spy the land and brought back the Vindicated evidence and 10 of them said we cannot do it we're unable look at how difficult it is and Joshua and Caleb said we are more than unable to do it God made the promise he said and remember they turned back that was kades Baria and they turned back and become Wanderers in the wilderness and every one of them died lost eternally Jesus said so don't cross that separating line see listen carefully when you know to do good and do it it not to you it's a sin friends the time has come for Action the time has come to believe or don't believe that separating line comes to every man and woman it comes to every child sometimes when you pass that line there's only one thing left that's judgment when you pass between mercy and judgment when you pass that line friends move away from that line tonight let's stand to our feet you have a choice tonight friends like I said some of us we're not doing too badly we're fighting with all that we got but there are too many of us we've been living on the edge some of us we are pushing our foot so close to the edge we're just on the line right now maybe you're one of them tonight you're on the line you know your situation you know your condition I'm challenging every one of you tonight to make a declaration to God lord tonight is my night today is my day I'm coming home I'm coming back to my first love I'm willing to do whatever it takes to do Lord but I don't want to cross the line Lord I don't want to cross the line I could imagine how painful it was for brother brandham as he said I'm thinking of those young people people on that night down there at the altar trying to be saved but had crossed the line God help us No Redemption for them they were gone could not be saved and I and I think of Noah when God shut the door and Noah was in the ark and for years he had preached that it was going to rain but nobody really believed him but then all of a sudden the rain began to fall and the people who were outside the ark they screamed out Noah open the door so we could get saved but it was too late they could not be saved the time of Grace the time of Mercy the time of Salvation was over friends time is running out today could be your last day your last day your very last day I'm not even reaching tomorrow yet today could be your last day to make things right today could be your very last day to move away from that line before judgment strikes you but brandham said when you cross the line you could still be in church and you don't even know that you're finished still come to church every Sunday and you could never make it because you already crossed the line friends where are you standing tonight maybe you've been living in sin but you don't you don't need to live in sin anymore maybe you have been living and you know what's right you don't need a preacher to tell you that that's right and that's wrong you know it you've heard it long enough everyone in here you know what's the truth you know what's right maybe you haven't been studying the message as you should or reading the Bible as you should or praying as you should you've been living so long in the edge you know more worldly songs than church songs you have more worldly friends than church friends you have more worldly clothes and church clothes you have more worldly desires than desires for God check yourself tonight come away from the edge tonight and come back to God because you do not want to cross the line I'm going to challenge you tonight every head bound every eye closed the holy spirit is already here don't make fun of him don't play games with him he said if you play games you make fun of this thing you you already crossed the line I'm going to challenge every one of you if you have been living on the edge and you want to make your life right with God you begin to talk to God right now and I want to challenge you because I believe as brother brandham said you have to do something for something to happen you have to take a stand because if you stand for God He he'll stand for you Hallelujah and I don't like to preach a message like this who had given people the opportunity to come to the altar because brother bam spoke about young people down there at the altar trying to be saved but they had crossed the line but I believe tonight tonight you could come to the Altar and you could be saved you could come to the Altar and you could be restored you could come to the Altar and you could be delivered you could come to the Altar and the peace that you lost could be restored you might have come in here backsliding you're in church but you're backslid you're out of church and you're backsliding but you don't need to leave that way tonight you were called to this service for such a time as this is there anybody here tonight you've been living on the edge and you want to say Lord take me back lord if that's how you feel I want you to come to the altar right now as a declaration of coming home I don't care where you at I don't care where you at you come to the altar right now you're tired of living on the edge don't play games with the Holy Spirit now he's here if you know you need to be here don't lie to the Holy Ghost he knows who needs to be up here right now he knows who needs to be here because if you go home without making it right and you know there are things to be made right you've already crossed the line don't play games tonight God will cut you off if you need to be here you come to the altar right now you've been living on the edge you've been living in sin you've been living under your privileges oh God we don't want to cross the line deliver your people tonight is there anybody else friends we should all be at the altar hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah maybe you have not been living on The Edge but you want to be drawn closer to God and you say Lord I've been living Lord and I need more of you I need you more more than yesterday I need you more more than words could say oh God help us tonight seek ye the Lord while he may be found he's here tonight but God is a gentleman he's not going to knock on your heart forever he said I stand at the door and knock and if any man here you open the door to him it's your choice to open the door some people want to hear a good service they want to hear a good sermon to fulfill that desire in their heart to be in church I'm not talking about that tonight I'm not talking about you coming to church I'm talking about your soul getting right with God I'm talking about you coming back returning to your first love I'm talking about you being trans transformed in the Inner Man it'll make you throw away clothes that you're not supposed to wear it'll make you throw away music and movies and books and magazines it'll make you stop talking to certain people it'll make you come to church every service it'll make you come to church on time it'll make you pray in the morning pray in the daytime pray in the night time oh Lord I need the oh I need it is this your prayer tonight every every hour I need the yes yes the Holy Ghost is here oh bless me now my saor I come oh he wants to give you the Holy Ghost friends that's why he's here oh God Lord take the evil out of my heart today Lord Lord I don't want to go home the same way I came tonight Lord have mercy on me have mercy on me tonight Lord I didn't even know what kind of service I was coming to tonight I didn't even know where this message was going Lord but I didn't even realize how close I was to the line at the risk of being cut off forever the Bible says God would not strive with Man Forever you wouldn't have this opportunity every time you wouldn't have the opportunity to come to the altar every time I need it oh Hallelujah every hour thank you Jesus oh bless me myor I come to I want to challenge you right now you begin to talk to God you begin
