[5:33] Heavenly Father, we thank you to be here
[5:36] today and I pray you will come down in a
[5:39] special
[5:41] way and minister to your
[5:44] people. May you take me out of the
[5:48] way and may divine revelation
[5:52] break upon your
[5:53] children in Jesus name I ask it.
[5:57] Amen and amen. Amen. Amen.
[6:02] So God bless
[6:03] you. If you have your
[6:06] Bibles I like you to turn to Romans
[6:08] chapter 8.
[6:10] Romans want to read 28-33.
[6:15] I want to read Romans chapter
[6:18] 4 verse 20 to
[6:22] 25 read in Romans chapter
[6:26] 8 verse
[6:28] 28 and we know that all things work
[6:31] together for good to them that love God
[6:33] to them who are the called according to
[6:35] his
[6:42] purpose For whom he did forno, he also
[6:45] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[6:48] image of his son, that he might be the
[6:51] firstborn among many
[7:01] brethren. Moreover, whom he did
[7:03] predestinate them, he also called, and
[7:05] whom he called, them he also justified.
[7:08] And whom he justified, them he had also
[7:11] glorified.
[7:22] What shall we then say to these things?
[7:24] If God be for us, who can be against
[7:34] us? He that spared not his own son, but
[7:37] delivered him up for us all. How shall
[7:39] he not but him also freely give us all
[7:43] things?
[7:52] Who shall lay anything to the charge of
[7:55] God's elect? It is God that
[8:02] justify and Romans uh uh
[8:07] four reading from verse
[8:10] 20. This is speaking about
[8:14] Abraham. He staggered not at the promise
[8:16] of God through unbelief but was strong
[8:18] in faith giving glory to God.
[8:27] And being fully persuaded that what he
[8:30] had promised he was able also to
[8:31] perform.
[8:45] No, it was not written for his sake
[8:47] alone, but was imputed to him.
[8:56] But for us also to whom it shall be
[8:58] imputed, if we believe on him that
[9:01] raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.
[9:14] who was delivered for our offenses and
[9:16] was raised again for our justification.
[9:24] And let's just read one more verse
[9:26] there. Verse chapter 5 verse one.
[9:28] Therefore, being justified by faith, we
[9:31] have peace with God through our Lord
[9:33] Jesus Christ.
[9:42] Let us pray once more.
[9:44] Heavenly Father, we have read your
[9:47] word and I pray the fire of your
[9:49] presence
[9:51] will come into your
[9:52] word and breathe life to your
[9:56] people in Jesus
[9:58] name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[10:02] [Applause]
[10:11] So have a title this
[10:13] morning. Conform to the image of his
[10:16] son.
[10:19] conform to the image of his son.
[10:24] I have a
[10:25] subject predestinated to be molded.
[10:32] subject predestinated to be molded
[10:36] and have inspiration
[10:39] raised again for our
[10:44] justification. Jesus Christ, this
[10:47] morning resurrection morning,
[10:51] he was raised up for our justification.
[10:55] Praise the name of the
[10:57] Lord. Now in the
[11:00] amplified Romans
[11:03] 8:29, for those he
[11:05] forneew or whom he was
[11:08] aware and loved
[11:11] beforehand, he also destined from the
[11:15] beginning to be
[11:17] molded into the image of his
[11:20] son and share his inward likeness.
[11:26] that he might be the firstborn among
[11:28] many
[11:30] brethren. And those he for
[11:34] ordained, he also
[11:36] called. And those whom he called, he
[11:40] also
[11:42] justified, which is to be
[11:45] acquitted, made
[11:48] righteous, and put in right standing
[11:50] with God.
[11:53] So to be justified
[11:55] is like God you are not guilty.
[11:59] You are free from the people.
[12:05] Your case vodka is
[12:10] dismissed. You are free.
[12:15] The devil wanted to keep you.
[12:18] But Jesus pay the price that you can be
[12:22] justified.
[12:25] [Applause]
[12:31] Glory. So therefore you may be
[12:34] seated. to the present suffering of this
[12:36] time
[12:38] is not worthy to be
[12:42] compared to be compared with the glory
[12:46] that shall be revealed in us.
[12:49] Praise God. You may be seated. We said
[12:53] last
[12:54] night, Adam, a perfect man, a man spoken
[12:59] into existence,
[13:01] he fell.
[13:04] But God, he's doing something
[13:07] different. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[13:09] Hallelujah. You are going to be born
[13:12] again by the word and by the spirit and
[13:17] you're going to grow. You're going to
[13:20] press. You're going to overcome.
[13:23] You're going to stand.
[13:25] You're going to walk like a ser. You're
[13:27] going to talk like a
[13:30] [Applause]
[13:44] ser now to be conformed to confirm.
[13:48] Listen, the word
[13:51] conform means to comply with rules,
[13:56] to be similar to be the same
[14:01] something. To do what other people
[14:04] do, to be
[14:06] obedient, to be compliant,
[14:11] to act in harmony,
[14:15] to conform to rules,
[14:19] So if you
[14:21] conform, you behave in a
[14:24] way that is expected of you
[14:29] to behave.
[14:32] Glory to God.
[14:34] If you
[14:35] conform, you behave in a
[14:38] way that you are
[14:41] expected or supposed to be.
[14:46] You may be seated.
[14:56] When when when Cain and Abel
[15:01] was given the opportunity
[15:04] to worship,
[15:05] Abel by
[15:07] faith offer up a
[15:10] lamb cut the
[15:12] truth. The blood splash
[15:15] and fire fell.
[15:18] God was pleased
[15:20] because
[15:21] Abel by faith. Cain, he offer fruits and
[15:27] flowers.
[15:29] Now God told
[15:30] Cain, "If you do like your brother,
[15:34] if you preach like your brother,
[15:37] if you talk like your brother,
[15:39] if you walk like your brother,
[15:42] I will bless you.
[15:45] I will bless you."
[15:48] Did you get
[15:49] that? What? What an easy thing.
[15:53] In other words, God tell king,
[15:58] you don't even need a revelation.
[16:01] Just do what your brother do
[16:05] and I will bless
[16:17] you. But you know what?
[16:21] Cain couldn't
[16:24] conform. Cain couldn't
[16:28] adjust. Cain wasn't flexible
[16:33] to see that if
[16:35] God blesses this
[16:37] man. There is
[16:39] something about
[16:42] why this man is blessed and what God
[16:47] bless.
[16:49] No man can kill.
[16:52] [Applause]
[17:09] [Music]
[17:12] 2 Timothy 3
[17:14] verse 16
[17:16] it says all scripture
[17:19] is given by inspiration of God
[17:23] and is profitable
[17:25] for doctrine for
[17:28] reproof for correction
[17:30] for
[17:31] instruction in
[17:34] righteousness, that the man of
[17:36] God may be perfect,
[17:39] thoroughly furnished,
[17:42] thoroughly furnished,
[17:44] unto all good works.
[17:47] In the
[17:49] amplified, every
[17:51] scripture is God
[17:53] [Music]
[17:54] breathed, is given by inspiration.
[17:59] Scripture has the breath of God on it
[18:04] and is profitable
[18:06] for
[18:07] reproof for conviction of sin,
[18:11] for correction of error,
[18:14] for discipline and
[18:17] obedience. Listen, and for training in
[18:22] righteousness, in holy
[18:26] living. Here we go. in
[18:30] conformity to God's
[18:33] will in
[18:35] thought,
[18:37] purpose and action.
[18:45] So our lives
[18:48] are to be conformed
[18:50] to God's will
[18:53] in thought,
[18:55] in
[18:56] purpose and in action.
[18:59] We have to think like
[19:01] God, speak like
[19:03] God, walk like
[19:06] God, live like God.
[19:15] You will be seated. Let's go.
[19:19] 2 million people
[19:21] under a prophet message Moses
[19:26] came out of
[19:29] Egypt. Out of two million,
[19:33] just
[19:35] two came out.
[19:38] The same God.
[19:40] that brought them
[19:42] out. Killed them.
[19:51] Did you get that?
[19:53] They were under Moses message.
[19:56] They were under Moses shout
[19:59] message to come out of Egypt.
[20:03] And the same God you that brought them
[20:06] out. There's a he killed them. There's a
[20:09] king. Don't play with
[20:12] God. This message is
[20:15] real. This is the same
[20:17] God that
[20:20] Abraham. This is the same God that
[20:25] Moses. This is the same God that opened
[20:28] the Red Sea.
[20:31] The same God
[20:33] would heal you, deliver you,
[20:37] free you,
[20:39] deliver you the same God.
[20:44] He's the same yesterday. Today all your
[20:48] failure and 10
[20:49] [Applause]
[21:07] month each day ends a
[21:12] generation. Each day
[21:15] you shak each
[21:18] day to a generation.
[21:22] Each day ends a 40-year period for
[21:28] somebody and each day so many is sealed
[21:33] away in the
[21:37] kingdom. You mean it must be
[21:40] sealed? Sealed.
[21:43] Set eight seals set. Seven seals set
[21:47] forth. Seven spirits set free. Seven
[21:49] thunders. Seven voices. Seven virtues.
[21:54] You have to be sealed with God. You by
[21:58] the Holy Ghost. Not by
[22:01] might. Not by power, but by my spirit.
[22:07] [Applause]
[22:19] Each day
[22:21] so many are sealed
[22:23] away in the kingdom.
[22:26] One day, the last day will
[22:31] arrive while we in our right
[22:35] mind where the Holy Spirit
[22:39] has identified himself.
[22:42] Don't you
[22:43] stop. Don't
[22:46] rest day and
[22:48] night until that quickening
[22:51] power has brought you
[22:54] from the things of the world into the
[22:57] kingdom of God.
[22:59] And you know that you
[23:02] truly are brought into the kingdom of
[23:06] God and quickened by the spirit.
[23:10] How
[23:11] happy with tears of joy.
[23:14] We should be on our knees
[23:18] day and night thanking God for what he
[23:22] has done.
[23:24] You are going to be sealed.
[23:26] You are going to be filled.
[23:29] God going to baptize you.
[23:32] The Holy
[23:33] Ghost fire.
[23:35] [Applause]
[23:48] I know.
[23:50] [Applause]
[23:52] I know.
[23:54] That this is not preached much in the
[23:56] message.
[23:58] They just want you to
[24:00] believe. But when John when they asked
[24:04] John, "Are you the Messiah?"
[24:06] He said no I am not he the one who was
[24:11] coming he going to baptize
[24:14] you fire the John said I baptize in
[24:20] water the one that is
[24:23] coming the one that is coming there is
[24:26] someone coming they are coming this
[24:29] morning it's coming
[24:32] today that one is here he is Yeah. Yes.
[24:37] He going to baptize you baptism. Take
[24:40] the Holy
[24:41] Ghost with fire
[24:44] [Applause]
[25:03] and You may be
[25:05] seated now. There's a natural church,
[25:09] a natural church.
[25:12] Church natural
[25:13] and there's a church spiritual.
[25:16] There's a church spiritual
[25:18] and there's a church intellectual.
[25:21] The intellectual.
[25:23] They're only talking word
[25:26] word. But there's a church spiritual.
[25:29] They are born of the spirit. They walk
[25:32] in the spirit. A connection to the
[25:35] spirit.
[25:37] That connection
[25:39] is that horizontal connection man to
[25:42] man.
[25:44] That connection connection is vertical.
[25:46] A vertical God and me. God and you.
[25:53] That's how it's coming. Come.
[26:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[26:06] Hallelujah. So, brother Bam says, "We
[26:09] find
[26:10] out when these natural and spiritual
[26:14] churches when they come together,
[26:17] there's always a
[26:19] clash and there's a
[26:22] clash because there is
[26:24] jealousy and
[26:26] jealousy causes kind of comparisons.
[26:29] [Music]
[26:31] How do you
[26:33] think Satan is feeling this morning?
[26:38] This resurrection
[26:43] morning on Friday night
[26:47] he is dead. Satan wipe his brow.
[26:53] He said my problems are over.
[26:56] Saturday night.
[26:58] Silence.
[27:00] Nothing moving.
[27:02] Nothing moving.
[27:04] But Easter morning,
[27:08] he is not dead.
[27:11] He is raised.
[27:45] Woo! Hallelujah.
[27:52] [Music]
[27:53] So brother says
[27:56] when the other side
[27:58] cannot get the spiritual results
[28:02] they have to take it by political
[28:06] power to upset the people's
[28:10] minds to draw disciples after
[28:14] themselves. Oh give the Lord some
[28:17] praises. And that's what we said last
[28:19] night.
[28:21] God didn't argue with the darkness.
[28:25] God didn't debate with the darkness.
[28:29] God didn't question the darkness.
[28:32] He just
[28:33] said, "Let there be
[28:41] light. You don't have to argue with
[28:45] anyone.
[28:47] You are the light.
[29:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[29:05] Listen, you don't take a
[29:08] light and hide
[29:10] it. You don't take a light and cover it
[29:14] up. You put the light where everybody
[29:18] could see
[29:19] it. God will take
[29:31] you. So brother,
[29:35] Abel and Faith, Abel and Abel and Cain,
[29:38] there was a clash. Clash. Abraham and
[29:41] Lot. Lot. There was a clash.
[29:45] Moses and Satan and Kora.
[29:48] There was a clash. When the carnal and
[29:52] the spiritual meet,
[29:54] there is a clash. Clash. When Judas and
[29:58] Jesus meet,
[30:00] there was a clash. Oh, glory to God. We
[30:04] are ready.
[30:07] We are ready for that clash.
[30:10] the Lord shout.
[30:13] We are ready. We are ready for that
[30:17] cash.
[30:19] Oh, glory to God.
[30:21] This message is real.
[30:25] Ivory coir.
[30:28] This message will
[30:31] live in you. In you in you.
[30:46] You may be saying now Esau
[30:50] was a very nice brother.
[30:53] Esau had good works.
[30:57] But Jacob.
[30:59] He wanted a birthright.
[31:01] He wanted the Holy Ghost. He wanted a
[31:04] revival.
[31:06] He wanted a breakthrough.
[31:09] And God recognized
[31:13] Jacob as spiritual.
[31:17] Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham.
[31:21] It always cause the natural
[31:25] to hate the spiritual.
[31:28] The spiritual
[31:31] can't
[31:32] hate because hate
[31:35] is not part of the spiritual.
[31:47] So what do they do? They try to destroy
[31:51] the
[31:53] influence. They try to destroy
[31:55] everything
[31:58] because it is nothing but jealousy.
[32:02] It started in
[32:03] Cain and prove it was
[32:06] jealousy. It's the same
[32:09] today when the
[32:11] natural and the spiritual
[32:13] meat because jealousy
[32:17] comes from
[32:18] Satan
[32:20] jealousy come from
[32:22] Satan. Satan was jealous of
[32:26] Michael and Satan tried to perform a
[32:30] coup and overthrow in heaven.
[32:34] But there was a war in heaven.
[32:37] War in
[32:38] heaven. Michael
[32:40] fought. Dragon
[32:42] fought and he was kicked
[32:45] out. He fell to the
[32:47] earth. But the earth belongs to us.
[32:51] [Applause]
[33:03] In the beginning, there was no plan of
[33:08] God for Satan to rule on the earth.
[33:12] In the beginning, what God did, he saw
[33:16] it was
[33:18] good and the devil was not in part of
[33:20] it.
[33:23] God put his son in the garden to rule
[33:28] the
[33:29] earth. We are coming back. We are coming
[33:33] back. Sons of God are coming back. We
[33:38] shall rain on
[33:40] you. We shall rain on
[33:43] you. We are coming back. We're going to
[33:47] conquer
[33:48] sickness. Conquer cancer.
[33:51] Conquer diabetes.
[33:54] Conquer
[33:55] disease. The blind could not see.
[33:58] The crippling on the
[34:01] walk. Sons of God
[34:04] are coming back.
[34:06] [Applause]
[34:36] Listen, we are only
[34:40] here in this condition
[34:43] because of Adam and Eve.
[34:47] Let me blow your mind.
[34:50] What said it was not your fault.
[35:02] It was not your
[35:07] fault. You were supposed to be
[35:10] born at the spoken word.
[35:14] Adam. Adam. was to speak for
[35:17] you. If Adam did not
[35:21] fall, let me say that again. If Adam did
[35:25] not fall, you was going to be on the
[35:29] earth, perfect
[35:31] man dominion.
[35:34] [Applause]
[35:47] So because Adam fell,
[35:50] we came through sex.
[35:52] That's how sex was permitted.
[35:56] What Brandon said, sex wasn't the
[35:58] perfect
[36:00] will. Sex was the permissive
[36:03] will because at fall,
[36:06] let us go to the elected.
[36:12] This virtuous
[36:14] bride, the bride is always part of the
[36:17] bridegroom.
[36:19] So the bride will not be a denomination.
[36:25] It will have to
[36:27] be the word manifested
[36:31] to be the bride of Christ.
[36:34] Not the word taught
[36:36] but the word walked.
[36:40] In other words, This
[36:42] word, the word was invisible
[36:47] until it become flesh.
[36:51] [Applause]
[37:01] The scribe and Pharisees,
[37:04] they had Moses books and tapes.
[37:08] They never saw never saw a devil cast
[37:11] out.
[37:13] Never saw the dead
[37:16] raised. Never saw a sick being
[37:19] healed. And one day they called somebody
[37:22] to read the
[37:24] scripture and Jesus raised his hands.
[37:28] Amen. Jesus say I am ready
[37:33] for years.
[37:35] Jesus going to
[37:38] service nothing.
[37:40] He is not talking. But this
[37:43] service he raised his
[37:45] hands. He came to the
[37:48] temple. He took the
[37:50] book. He found where it is written.
[37:54] The spirit is upon me.
[37:58] Hold it. Holy, holy. They thought
[38:01] he was reading a text.
[38:04] They couldn't see
[38:06] the spirit that was upon him. He wasn't
[38:10] talking text.
[38:13] He was talking
[38:23] reality. He wasn't talking text.
[38:27] Spirit
[38:29] is upon me because he has anointed me to
[38:33] bring good
[38:35] tidings to open the eyes of the
[38:37] plan to set at
[38:40] liberty them that are bound. And he
[38:43] closed the
[38:46] book. And then
[38:48] Jesus, he sat down. And when he sat
[38:52] down, he said, "This
[38:54] day, the scripture is
[38:58] fulfilled in your ears.
[39:01] [Applause]
[39:10] This is
[39:12] that Isaiah spoke up.
[39:16] And one day we will say this is
[39:20] that the prophet
[39:24] William spake.
[39:27] [Applause]
[39:45] So your natural life
[39:48] because it was associated
[39:52] with man and woman
[39:54] together in a sexual affair.
[39:58] That association
[40:00] brought on sin and
[40:02] death. So your nature is associated with
[40:06] death.
[40:08] I'm still reading.
[40:10] Your first
[40:11] husband had rule over you
[40:15] because of your nature.
[40:18] By your natural birth,
[40:21] naturally, you love the world because
[40:24] you are the world and you are part of
[40:27] the
[40:28] world. God don't condemn
[40:31] you for
[40:33] sinning because you are a
[40:36] sinner. You are nature
[40:39] to
[40:40] sin. What God condemn you
[40:43] for is when he makes a
[40:46] way for you to come out of your
[40:49] sin and you turn that
[40:51] down. God knows we are flesh. God knows
[40:57] what's in this flesh.
[41:00] But she make a way that we could be
[41:02] directed.
[41:04] That we could be led
[41:07] by the spirit. The spirit is here. The
[41:12] spirit will anoint the inner man. The
[41:17] spirit will anoint inside of you. And
[41:22] what's inside of you? prepare his flesh
[41:26] in subjection
[41:28] to what's inside of you. Give the Lord a
[41:31] praise.
[41:44] So your first
[41:46] husband is this natural life. He said
[41:50] you have to die to that first husband.
[41:54] You say, "I will divorce
[41:56] him and hang
[41:58] him." You put your first
[42:01] husband in the
[42:03] closet. So when you're
[42:05] ready, you pull him
[42:08] out. You want to move on, but you have
[42:11] your
[42:13] ex-boyfriend or
[42:16] ex-girlfriend at the side somewhere.
[42:19] No. No. That's not allowed.
[42:23] You have to die. Hallelujah. Isn't that
[42:26] right? Brother Brandham, the nature of
[42:29] this world
[42:31] has to die.
[42:34] Your
[42:34] name of your first nature
[42:38] was put in a book of
[42:41] life and all your
[42:43] deeds was wrote in it.
[42:47] Everything you
[42:48] done under that
[42:51] nature was put in a book.
[42:54] It is called the book of life.
[42:57] Isn't that right? But then your name has
[43:02] been
[43:06] transferred into the new book,
[43:10] the lamb's
[43:11] book. And when your name is transferred,
[43:15] all your sins
[43:18] is put in the sea
[43:20] of his forgetfulness,
[43:23] not your forgetfulness,
[43:26] his forgetfulness.
[43:28] And when he drop your
[43:30] sins in that sea,
[43:33] he don't remember. He can't
[43:37] remember. Hallelujah.
[43:45] Brother,
[43:47] your name is now in the new book.
[43:51] He said you God put it
[43:54] your sins in the sea of forgetfulness.
[43:58] You
[43:59] stand perfectly before God.
[44:05] [Applause]
[44:08] Brother, brother,
[44:11] I don't feel perfect.
[44:13] I don't see myself perfect.
[44:16] That is you. That has to do with
[44:19] God. That's you. That is your feeling.
[44:24] That's not God
[44:25] feeling wrecked for
[44:27] you. What God is feeling.
[44:31] [Applause]
[44:42] Your name is now in the new book. Not
[44:47] the book of life, but the lamb's book of
[44:50] life.
[44:52] The lamb has redeemed.
[44:55] You are a new
[45:00] bride. Remember
[45:04] [Applause]
[45:06] the woman at the well.
[45:09] You could understand what really take
[45:11] place there.
[45:13] Her
[45:14] name is in the book. She doesn't know
[45:18] it.
[45:20] Jesus is the book.
[45:23] [Applause]
[45:29] Jesus is the book with flesh on it.
[45:34] So when he begin to speak to that woman
[45:39] and told her, "Go call your
[45:42] husband," she said, "I have none." He
[45:45] said, "You had
[45:46] five." I said, "One you're living with
[45:50] is not
[45:53] yours." Note
[45:56] Jesus didn't say
[45:59] so much.
[46:01] But how you do that? How long you doing
[46:04] that?
[46:06] When did you do that?
[46:18] Jesus to show
[46:20] you how that
[46:22] woman was free on the inside.
[46:26] It wasn't an outside
[46:28] thing. It got a revelation
[46:31] that she ran.
[46:34] When you get revelation,
[46:38] Revelation is not water.
[46:42] Revelation is
[46:43] wine and wine of
[46:47] stimulation of
[46:49] revelation. When that
[46:52] woman Jesus finished with that
[46:55] woman, she ran Come see a man. Come see
[47:00] a man. Come see a man.
[47:10] And some church sister,
[47:14] she say another one,
[47:18] another man. And that woman said with
[47:21] revelation, she said, "No, no, no, no,
[47:24] no. Not them men. There's a perfect
[47:28] man."
[47:32] Oh, glory to God.
[47:35] It is
[47:36] something for God to free you, for God
[47:39] to tell you, neither do I condemn
[47:43] thee. Go and sin no more. No
[47:48] more. No more. You are free. And Jesus
[47:53] said,
[47:54] not who the church members set
[47:57] free, not who the pastor set
[48:00] free. Jesus said who the son of man get
[48:05] free is free indeed.
[48:08] Oh glory to God. If you are not
[48:12] free get free
[48:14] today this morning you want to be
[48:18] free to
[48:21] worship. Praise
[48:26] God. Hallelujah.
[48:30] [Applause]
[48:35] Brother Brandham,
[48:37] Romans 5:1.
[48:39] Therefore, being justified by faith,
[48:42] look up the word. Here we go. This is
[48:46] deep. The word don't mean
[48:50] [Music]
[48:52] forgiven.
[48:53] Justify don't mean you are forgiven.
[48:58] For instance, If you heard I got drunk
[49:02] and done some evil
[49:04] thing and you found you come and say to
[49:06] me, you found out I didn't do them.
[49:10] Then you say, "But Brandham, I forgive
[49:13] you. Forgive
[49:15] me. I didn't do it in the first
[49:18] place. Now if I do it, I am
[49:22] guilty. You could forgive me
[49:26] and I wouldn't be guilty. But yet I am
[49:29] not
[49:30] justified because I actually did
[49:33] it. But the word justified,
[49:37] I don't want you to use your head now. I
[49:40] want to use your
[49:41] heart to believe what is being spoken.
[49:46] The word justify,
[49:48] are you ready?
[49:50] Are you ready? The word justify
[49:54] is though you never done it. Love
[49:58] [Applause]
[50:13] Sh. It is not even regarded.
[50:17] It's in God's book of the sea of
[50:19] forgetfulness.
[50:20] [Music]
[50:22] Listen, it is not even in the memories
[50:25] of God.
[50:36] Now I
[50:37] know many of
[50:40] us ain't get this yet
[50:48] because you are think you are still
[50:50] thinking about yourself.
[50:53] You are still thinking about what you
[50:54] have done.
[50:56] Listen to what justification
[50:59] mean. What was the scripture we
[51:03] read? Who he
[51:05] forneew? He
[51:07] called or who he knew
[51:10] before. He called. He knew you.
[51:14] Therefore, he called
[51:16] you. He knew you
[51:18] before the foundation of the world.
[51:22] [Applause]
[51:30] He didn't come
[51:32] to see how much he was drinking,
[51:35] how much it was
[51:37] smoking, how much it was in
[51:39] adultery, how much it was in
[51:42] fornication. He looked at and see your
[51:45] name and he called you
[51:49] just as you are. Come visit. Visit
[51:54] Now, he did not call you
[51:57] to remain as you are,
[52:00] but he called you to be conformed to
[52:04] have conformed or to be molded
[52:07] into the image of his
[52:16] son. So, let's say it again.
[52:20] Who
[52:21] he called
[52:23] who he call be justified.
[52:27] [Applause]
[52:31] Not forgiven.
[52:34] This is beyond unforgiven.
[52:37] Listen, remember what we preached last
[52:39] night.
[52:41] God had an
[52:43] intent and a desire to bring back his
[52:47] sons. So he had to make a way for us to
[52:52] get back on
[52:54] track. Justification,
[52:56] you can't cancel
[52:58] that. No man could cancel that. Who he
[53:02] found you? He found you me. He called.
[53:07] He called me. He justified. He justify
[53:10] me.
[53:12] Listen. And who he justified?
[53:16] You're already glorified.
[53:20] In between
[53:21] there, in between there is a sanctified
[53:25] work,
[53:27] a
[53:28] process from being
[53:30] justified by faith and you act to your
[53:35] faith, knowledge, emperor,
[53:41] patience, kindness, and the glory.
[53:46] The glory, the glory, father.
[53:51] That day we won
[53:53] as you and I. We
[53:55] won and the glory
[53:58] I had with you.
[54:01] I would share with
[54:02] them that we all
[54:05] maybe in one
[54:17] Brother,
[54:20] the
[54:21] bridegroom bore your shame.
[54:25] The bridegroom took your place.
[54:28] You were predestinated for him
[54:32] to be in his bride. You were
[54:36] deceived by your first
[54:39] marriage to your adulterous parent
[54:43] Eve. It's no fault of your
[54:46] own by your natural
[54:49] birth. You come after
[54:51] Eve. You are sinner to begin
[54:54] with. You were deceived into
[54:57] it. It ain't your fault.
[55:01] You never did it
[55:03] because that germ that was in you
[55:06] was to be in
[55:08] you before the foundation of the world.
[55:11] God put your
[55:13] name on the lamb's book of
[55:16] life before
[55:18] depression before
[55:20] frustration before your pain.
[55:24] And you can't stand it no
[55:25] more before all of that. He put your
[55:29] name Before the devil tempt you, he put
[55:33] your name before the devil pull you to a
[55:36] side. He put your name before them
[55:40] church
[55:41] folks try to mess your
[55:46] mind. Let me go. Let's
[55:49] go. You was put
[55:52] there by predestination.
[55:55] [Applause]
[56:11] You were for ordained
[56:14] to be a son of God.
[56:17] You were in
[56:19] God before the foundation of the world.
[56:22] And you are only manifested
[56:27] in this
[56:28] day his honor
[56:31] and his
[56:33] [Applause]
[56:41] glory.
[56:43] Brother the
[56:46] bridegroom took your shame
[56:49] and put in a sea of forgetfulness.
[56:53] by the washing of the water, by the
[56:55] word. And then he said this, "You are
[57:00] standing completely
[57:04] justified as though you never did
[57:07] it in the
[57:08] beginning." This is my message to the
[57:11] church.
[57:12] Now, if you are standing on God's
[57:16] word and with God's word, every judge,
[57:21] where are you standing?
[57:23] You are, the pure, virtuous, sinless,
[57:30] bride of the son of the living God.
[57:34] And every man and woman that's born of
[57:38] the spirit of God washed in the blood of
[57:40] Jesus Christ
[57:42] stands as though you never
[57:45] sinned in the first
[57:52] place. That is
[57:54] not the preachers
[57:57] revelation or for pastors the pastor for
[58:01] the fivefold. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[58:03] no. Every man, every man, every man
[58:08] under the blood stands perfect,
[58:11] perfect
[58:13] standing. Your state
[58:16] is not perfect yet.
[58:19] You have your ups and downs, your ins
[58:21] and outs. But when God look down, that's
[58:25] my child. That's my child. That is my
[58:27] child. That is my child. God could tell
[58:31] the angels
[58:33] Go to tell the angels, they are coming.
[58:36] They are coming. They are coming. They
[58:38] are coming. They are coming. They are
[58:40] coming. Because there is something
[58:42] inside of you. There's a germ inside of
[58:45] you. There's a seed inside of
[58:48] you. God put
[58:50] that. God put that. And the devil can't
[58:55] take it out.
[58:57] [Applause]
[59:12] Let's go. You may be seated. Brother
[59:16] Brandham, he was talking about Elisha.
[59:19] Elijah was about to leave
[59:23] and he took his mantle
[59:25] and chuck it on a young
[59:27] man. I didn't leave it there.
[59:30] Pull it off.
[59:37] So that young
[59:38] man, he got a
[59:41] taste of the power. I went and hit
[59:46] him. He said, "I am leaving this
[59:49] man. Wherever you go, I'm going.
[59:56] [Applause]
[59:59] Men in the message
[1:00:02] of that
[1:00:02] hour tell him know you not your master
[1:00:07] will be taken from you
[1:00:09] today he said yes I know it but hold
[1:00:13] your
[1:00:14] peace don't try to give me any negative
[1:00:18] talk I'm
[1:00:20] going listen to
[1:00:23] this God usually puts us in the shop
[1:00:30] and trims us.
[1:00:32] He didn't alter his robe to fit
[1:00:37] Elijah. He altered
[1:00:40] Elisha to fit the
[1:00:42] robe. He also alters
[1:00:45] us to fit the
[1:00:48] robe, not the robe to fit us.
[1:00:52] Sometimes we want to make the
[1:00:55] robe fit us but we can't do that.
[1:01:00] We You have got to be altered
[1:01:03] yourself for the robe. It is God's robe.
[1:01:08] He made it perfect.
[1:01:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:01:12] Hallelujah. And that is where perfection
[1:01:15] comes. from ignoring our own
[1:01:19] holiness, which we have
[1:01:21] none, and our
[1:01:23] thoughts, which we ought not to be,
[1:01:27] but we rest
[1:01:29] solemnly upon the finished work of the
[1:01:31] Lord Jesus.
[1:01:34] Here we go, all these
[1:01:37] years, as far as we know,
[1:01:40] he just had one baptism of the robe
[1:01:44] going over him.
[1:01:47] [Music]
[1:01:49] So when
[1:01:50] Elijah dropped that robe on Elisha,
[1:01:54] he was baptized,
[1:01:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:59] But listen to this.
[1:02:01] Watch all these
[1:02:03] years. As far as we
[1:02:06] know, he just had one baptism of the
[1:02:09] robe over him. But through the years,
[1:02:15] God had molded the man's
[1:02:19] character into a
[1:02:22] place after he was called,
[1:02:25] he would
[1:02:27] fit the robe and be a servant of the
[1:02:31] Lord. So God, the robe is perfect,
[1:02:36] but you have to be cut or shaped or
[1:02:41] honed
[1:02:42] or molded
[1:02:44] to fit in that.
[1:02:54] Now
[1:02:55] Jesus was our example
[1:02:58] and he is the example
[1:03:00] that we ought to be looking
[1:03:02] at. Now we find out be seated as we go
[1:03:06] through
[1:03:07] life our character
[1:03:11] molds the image that we
[1:03:17] are you as you
[1:03:20] live so is your
[1:03:23] character it molds you
[1:03:27] to what you
[1:03:29] are now you have seen
[1:03:32] people you just love to be around
[1:03:35] because of the atmosphere atmosphere
[1:03:38] that they carry.
[1:03:41] So their character
[1:03:43] creates whatever they are.
[1:03:46] But when God looked upon his lost
[1:03:50] creation, how he fashioned
[1:03:52] it and saw it being
[1:03:55] perverted, his loving
[1:03:58] character, God had this great plan.
[1:04:03] for mankind
[1:04:06] to inhabit the earth
[1:04:08] and to live in
[1:04:10] peace and to never die,
[1:04:13] never to be
[1:04:14] sick or have a heartache or any
[1:04:19] worry. That was the
[1:04:21] desire. Isn't that right? So his loving
[1:04:25] character, there we go. His loving
[1:04:28] character molded
[1:04:31] himself into the person of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:36] God's own character
[1:04:39] of love projected himself
[1:04:42] in the man Christ Jesus.
[1:04:46] Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're
[1:04:49] coming onto the home church. Now listen
[1:04:51] to this. Remember,
[1:04:54] when nobody else could do it,
[1:04:58] we are invited.
[1:05:02] [Applause]
[1:05:04] I just love that. He's not forcing you.
[1:05:08] An
[1:05:09] invitation is going out this morning.
[1:05:12] Listen to this.
[1:05:13] We are invited
[1:05:16] to shape
[1:05:18] our own character to his
[1:05:21] by his grace.
[1:05:23] We are invited.
[1:05:26] Think of it to become characters like
[1:05:28] his.
[1:05:31] Praise God.
[1:05:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:05:35] Hallelujah. We are invited
[1:05:38] to be molded
[1:05:40] in his image that we might reflect
[1:05:44] his presence.
[1:05:46] So when we let his character
[1:05:49] be in us then we become sons
[1:05:52] by having the mind of Christ which is
[1:05:55] his character.
[1:05:57] And then he said this your mind makes
[1:06:01] your character.
[1:06:03] Oh glory to God. Jesus said, "You have
[1:06:07] not chosen me, but I have chosen you."
[1:06:11] The bride was
[1:06:13] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:06:16] world. The choosing of the
[1:06:18] bride was purpose in
[1:06:21] himself. The eternal
[1:06:23] God, he
[1:06:26] purpose to take a bride
[1:06:29] of his own choosing.
[1:06:32] Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God,
[1:06:36] he was the eternal spirit
[1:06:39] and the bride was already in his mind.
[1:06:43] She was existing in his thoughts.
[1:06:46] The unchangeable God. God is
[1:06:49] unchangeable,
[1:06:51] in essence and
[1:06:53] behavior. God is
[1:06:55] infinite in his
[1:06:58] ability. He is not now
[1:07:00] learning or even taking comfort with
[1:07:04] himself. He cannot act his
[1:07:07] knowledge. He cannot act his
[1:07:10] knowledge. Glory to God. That's the
[1:07:13] thoughts of
[1:07:14] God are
[1:07:17] eternal. They are
[1:07:19] real. They are not. Like a man of a
[1:07:25] blueprint, like like an architect.
[1:07:28] You have a picture blueprint and one day
[1:07:31] going to build a building. He said God
[1:07:33] thoughts are not like
[1:07:34] that. God thoughts are
[1:07:37] real. Yeah. It's already substance
[1:07:40] substance. Glory to God. So when Jesus
[1:07:44] said when the word said I knew
[1:07:48] you before he was in a mother's womb,
[1:07:52] I knew you that is real.
[1:07:56] You were in his thinking.
[1:07:58] You were in his mind.
[1:08:00] You were in the background of God.
[1:08:09] Let's go. Adam
[1:08:12] was form of the dust of the
[1:08:14] earth and his spiritual being
[1:08:18] created by God.
[1:08:20] Then Adam become God's thought
[1:08:23] expressed.
[1:08:25] Those eternal
[1:08:27] thoughts are now being
[1:08:30] manifested that give eternal quality
[1:08:34] to the elect. Hallelujah. These elect
[1:08:38] were not only the eternal thoughts of
[1:08:40] God which were expressed in flesh
[1:08:44] in their due season
[1:08:47] but their same elect.
[1:08:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:08:51] He identified the elect.
[1:08:54] as the children of promise.
[1:08:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are the
[1:09:00] children of promise.
[1:09:03] Royal seeds.
[1:09:06] Royal seeds royalty of Abraham.
[1:09:16] your president,
[1:09:18] the president of Iricos,
[1:09:22] he don't come out on the
[1:09:23] streets and just say, "I'm going to
[1:09:26] travel. I want to buy something by this
[1:09:29] shop." No. Because of who he
[1:09:33] is. You have
[1:09:36] security. You have lights flashing
[1:09:41] and because of who you are.
[1:09:47] You have
[1:09:50] security. You have angelic protection.
[1:09:55] You have
[1:09:57] angels watching over
[1:09:59] you because you are going to be the
[1:10:03] final
[1:10:04] voice to the final.
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:21] So the bride
[1:10:23] is the literal
[1:10:26] spoken word seed bride literal even
[1:10:30] though even even though she is feminine
[1:10:33] in
[1:10:36] designation she is called the body of
[1:10:40] Christ. We did not become seed by the
[1:10:45] rebirth. We were
[1:10:48] seed. Therefore, we could be
[1:10:52] reborn. Only the
[1:10:54] elect can be
[1:10:57] reborn. Because we were
[1:11:00] seed in none
[1:11:03] seed. There is nothing to quicken.
[1:11:06] but in you. Oh, glory to God.
[1:11:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:11:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:11:14] Musicians, come up, please.
[1:11:16] Glory. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:11:20] Hallelujah. Praise God. Let me give you
[1:11:23] a
[1:11:24] bomb. Jesus said, "My sheep,
[1:11:28] hear my voice. And they follow me. You
[1:11:32] never were a pig."
[1:11:35] Did you get that?
[1:11:36] You never were a
[1:11:38] pig or a dog that turned into sheep.
[1:11:44] You always was a son.
[1:11:47] You always was a
[1:11:54] daughter. I'm finished. Listen to this.
[1:11:58] Brother Brandon, he was praying. He
[1:12:01] said, "Lord,
[1:12:03] confirm it right now.
[1:12:05] While I'm before your throne,
[1:12:08] take every one of these people.
[1:12:11] Take the world out of us.
[1:12:14] Take me, Lord.
[1:12:17] While we in your presence,
[1:12:19] take the world. Ring our
[1:12:22] hearts. Pull the world away from
[1:12:26] us. Let us be consecrated Christians.
[1:12:31] We are before your throne.
[1:12:33] We are waiting upon thee.
[1:12:36] Ring my heart, Lord.
[1:12:39] I see my
[1:12:41] errors. I I see my mistakes.
[1:12:44] From this time, I am trying to live the
[1:12:48] best.
[1:12:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I want to go
[1:12:52] consecrated my
[1:12:54] life. And then he said
[1:12:57] this, "May there come
[1:12:59] forth, a revival
[1:13:03] of the
[1:13:05] just he pray that the justified
[1:13:10] will have a revival." He said, "May they
[1:13:12] come forth,
[1:13:14] a revival of the
[1:13:16] just and great power come among the
[1:13:20] church."
[1:13:21] It's not too hard to pray that
[1:13:25] because you promise it.
[1:13:27] So Jesus Christ, he was raised up for
[1:13:31] our justification.
[1:13:34] Now we are free. God bless you.
