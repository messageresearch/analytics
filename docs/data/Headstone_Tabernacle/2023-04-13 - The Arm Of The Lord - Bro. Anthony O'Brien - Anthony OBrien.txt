a portion of two portion of scripture quickly I preached from Isaiah 53 for the context Okay so amen so Deuteronomy 26 Deuteronomy 26 and verse 7 to 9. specifically we want to read from and look on our affliction and our labor and our oppression and the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand and when an outstretched arm this place and had given us this land even a land that floweth with milk and honey and turning over now to Isaiah 53 we want to read the first five verses there amen praise the Lord Isaiah 53 and verse 1. says who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is the spies and rejected of man A Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne on griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of all peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed may God add blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our hands as we pray one more time almighty God we thank you to be in your house tonight Lord we do not take it lightly Lord father Lord we do not take it by chance Lord but Lord only who you predestinate them you also call and who your call is who you're Justified you've already glorified

father Victory after Victory you're gone we'll be careful to give you all the praise and not only on and all the glory in Jesus name amen praise God he may have your seats amen Hallelujah amen amen well praise God are you happy to be in the house of the lawn when we come into his house we are glad David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord amen and amen and amen praise God so we had to praise him we had to worship him tonight I have a title tonight the arm of the Lord amen that's my title tonight the arm of the Lord and uh I actually had this inspiration quite a long time but then when uh brotherhood last Wednesday I think he read the same scripture Isaiah 53 and so uh when he struck it I said well we're on to something now amen so praise God and then last week with such an anointed week felt the presence of God in a special way in my own life remember the Terence praise God we know that uh God is here Among Us he's speaking to us and if we eat at an air let him hear what the spirit of God is saying to us we want to be in such a way that God could speak to us that God could tap us on the shoulder God is looking for such men and women tonight upon the face of the Earth that he could rest his hand on and say here is my spirit flowing freely he wants to be able to touch somebody in order to perform a work to perform an action to perform an activity there's things that God wants to do tonight but he's looking for Willing hearts willing Souls willing lives isn't that right William Marion Branham was such a life William Marion Branham was such a prophet that God could put his hand on and say come here I want you to Walk This Way don't ask any questions just come follow me and miracles would follow and power would follow and healing would follow because here is a man who is under the influence of the Holy Spirit and that is what we need tonight men and women who are under the influence of the holy spirit that God could move in such a way upon your life that you could be a blessing to somebody that you could be a help to somebody the gift is not for you it's for somebody else you were meant to reach somebody else to encourage somebody else to bless somebody else to heal somebody God wants to use somebody tonight may that be you my Christian brother may that be you my Christian friend let whom that is greatest among you let him be your servant can you say man God is looking for servants tonight amen to become Servants of the Lord in order to do that he has to break us he has to mold us he has to shape us he has to take us aside oh hallelujah hallelujah he has to pull us aside from all the distractions praise God and when I think about that I think about Moses because here was Moses a man of God called of God of course the call of God is upon his life it sound wonderful to be chosen but God allow rejection God allow us a certain level of scrutiny to come into His Life by the killing of the Egyptian isn't that right he fled Egypt and went out into the Wilderness he should have died when they were killing all of the firstborn males oh Hallelujah isn't that right oh hallelujah it's not right he was the only one of his generation that survived he was the only one of his age that survived oh hallelujah praise God is not right hallelujah hallelujah and God call him out many died and were killed and so forth like that isn't that right he's one of the very to go into something he had to be stripped he had to be beaten he had to be changed he had to be chastised he had to be brought into a certain uh order praise God had to break him subject to his own word and that's what we need tonight praise God hallelujah it's wonderful to say I'm chosen I'm a Child of God but in order for you to get into that adoption in order to get into that for his purpose and for his kingdom and for his glory in order for you to come into that state God has to take charge will subject you to his word subject you to what he once done what he once said even Jesus said Hallelujah the arm of the Lord so we serve our Supernatural God isn't that right God is a supernatural being you believe that tonight and because he is Supernatural it really exists outside of it isn't that right he's both within and without it isn't that right therefore it means so chooses he can step in and tonight it means that God could step into your circumstance tonight and some things that you were praying about maybe something that's upon your heart he can begin to perform Miracles because he exists outside of the natural he is Supernatural and anytime call a manifestation of the arm of the Lord coming into your life it's his hand his hand of predestination his hands are blessing his hands of guidance Earth is my footstool what how shall you build for me but God wants to dwell with you tonight and if he needs me to nudge he write down into your world abideth forever whatever his word says is forever and forever therefore if you answer and pull down the Eternal Word for your situation oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's called divine intervention his hand comes down we'll try to kill you be for that team and try to catch your daughter or get your shekhana do something for you tonight he is present tense tonight your deliver y Hallelujah glory to God amen Brothers divine intervention call themselves intervene in our situation and we see the hand of God come down made to be slaves they had Wicked task Masters over them making them make break bricks without straw they were crying out get into his domain he will praise God do what he wants with you because he don't like you because you represent everything that he hands into the hand of the enemy oh he'll make mincemeat out of you he will Advantage people of God came up to The Heirs of God and God looked at his watch and recognized that the time had cries of the people for the reason of their taskmasters they screamed they cried and they said Lord you promised to deliver us where is the god of Abraham where is the god of Isaac where is the god of Jacob where is the god of Joseph you prayers of God the Bible said God remembered the promise that he had made to his father their fathers Abraham and he said the time has come let me come down to deliver under persecution from the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus Street Revival came because somebody cried Somebody Prayed and Hallelujah that pants legs was bragging at the knees somebody called on the Lord that's how revivals come because people got desperate they say revivals don't happen among the rich among the men of the cloth of social rejects people who considered that they'd have no estate they have they have nothing coming nothing going Tim for the bread in their mouth for the water upon their lips they need God so they've sent us a Revival we need a Stern we need an Awakening and when God hears the promised word [Music] oh Sam Hallelujah my it was based on so God will bring his hand into your situation and begin to move things around he'll bring down Kings is that what Hannah said oh and she got a blessing she said Lord I love the Hummer oh you're the god that tries us the god that sees what is in our hearts Egypt inside of them he took them through the long way and the narrow way and tonight God's taken you through the long way the lust and the lies and everything out of you that everything that the world's trying to hold on to you God's gonna pull you away from it your weakness his strength is made perfect in your witch I'm not even a medium shot I'm a no party for him to show me his glory and for him to reveal to me his love who am I I could have been anybody this oh Hallelujah Glory let's not ties you he carry you through the fire he take you through the flood some to the waters some through the flood some to Chris therefore and repent oh and turn to the Lord and he'll make your paths trembling he'll bring Deliverance to your husband come on now I can't hear you he'll bring Deliverance to yourself humble before God if my people shall humble themselves and pray and turn from their wicked ways I shall hear from heaven now I will forgive their sins but it comes by a cry you've got to have a cry to get in the spirit a passion to know his word of fervent desire to please God oh leave an event stand up and say Amen respond to the word of God God Is Calling You Higher tonight we are he's calling a church to Perfection not many men answer that call I pray it be you my Christian brother huh wow it's a God came to Moses in a time when Deliverance was at hand there was now a need put a hand of and upon God upon Isaac moving things around but there come a time when Deliverance was necessary into such a state that the people began to cry by reason of their Affliction and God allows things to come into our lives that is the only way God could answer oh and if love don't get you desperate then God will let conditions because Spirit has a tendency to be very relaxed and to be very Slot full and to be very lazy and to be very upset absolute so God has to remind God for your life because house can save your son and a car can save your wife and land can save your your mother save you is the same God I have to save your world when we pray when we cry we know that there's a God that can do something that we age let that God be God let him speak to your hearts let him save the loss let him save the Fallen let him give strength to the weak let him bring up the weary find their homes power and their families that the children oh after that I shall pour out my spirits upon All Flesh your sons and daughter periods the spirit of God it's gonna sweep over you tonight sure let me free I Wanna Be Free from the bondage of Sadie sets us let us lay us set aside tonight let us call upon the name of our God for he in a time of trouble with us Upon Our Rock oh Hallelujah and now shall my eyes be lifted up victory over the devil victory over everything that feels like it's conquering you God's gonna come into you and make you more than a conqueror more than a conqueror ah the call of God echoed in your heart we know who we are we know where we come from we know feel that way tonight Oh Glory Glory took so God is a king it's not right he's a king over holy Earth and perform an action he usually takes up a position he takes up a new position he stands up in the court of his counsels prologue the feathers and they put it in the ink because the king is about to decrease something he's about to declare something oh so let it be written so let it be done if any time God has had enough of the enemy in your situation in your circumstance and you begin to cry I'm of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time but at that time Michael shall stand up against the enemy the king is now on the move the King has 10 against the enemy take a stand against the devil in your life oh Hallelujah gonna receive Victory after Victory power after power you're going to be filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire taking up a new position and my people

there's gonna be so much water we won't can't drink it all no church can hold the Holy Ghost he pours out upon individuals he's pouring out upon you tonight he's pour not upon us tonight his spirit is here pruning over us bringing us to life bringing ought to bring those seeds alive he that abide it in me out of his belly out of his belly shall flow I have seen nowhere has heard oh Hallelujah Glory

Marvelous work I'm so happy I Met You by the blood of Jesus Christ I call you brother I can call you sister what a Grace that is going to be blacked out but God by the grace of God the prophet put a Slither of light in this loud decision age and that represented you and I oh that you would not be deceived that you would not be turned aside but the grace of God could find you and reach down his hand for you oh my this right hand of the Lord is Christ isn't that right and as it goes down into aggressions brood for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed present tense tonight but the purpose of his power is not just to display Paul but it was to bring the people out from the clinic because Redemption is in two parts coming out of and

where this is in Exodus 13 21. to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of Fire night time is the same God that was with them in the daytime amen saying great and the god of the mountain is the god in the valley oh all the same God that you need for the rain is the same God that brings the sunshine he's with you every step of the way nothing moving but that's the time that you have to be certain of your God in your situation be certain of him because he will never leave you never it's time sure forever and ever oh Hallelujah anything we can rely on tonight is the word of almighty God to lead them in the way by Night a pillar of Fire to give them light to go by night and the prophet said and with a reverend sincere heart I believe that that's that same angel of God Slam in the natural is leading us to the promised land today in the spiritual can we say amen he said for in my father's house are many mansions today and it is the same holy spirit all the same Holy Ghost oh

God promised us sealer bride home by the Seal of the Living God Hallelujah isn't that right that's what we're waiting on ulcery and compelling unnecessary that you receive the holy ghostness of his spirits you've got to have your soul like John Wesley I think one of them said your soul has got to be stamped with the power of God with the spirit of God branded inside of you oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh man Hallelujah seals promise to take you through isn't that right hallelujah amen if you see if I haven't told you the truth he said now if this is my last service that's the

depend on that you associate with the world then from every feta from the world and come to God that hand of God will be upon you as long as you stay with that word get off that word when the groups organize they organize the Holy Ghost right out and the Holy Ghost move down because he didn't have anybody he could put and he needs people in order to fulfill it isn't that right Psalms 98 says we'll sing unto the Lord a new song for he had done marvelous things and his right hand and His holy arm had gotten him to Victory oh can we say Amen the Lord had made known as salvation his righteousness had he openly showed in the sight of the heathen he had remembered his mercy and his truth toward the children of Israel and all the ends of the Earth have seen the salvation of our God

Believer in Christ Jesus and I accept my healing and I walk by faith right now I believe it the prophet said I like that amen verse 16 he said the lord of the right hand of the Lord is exalted and the
