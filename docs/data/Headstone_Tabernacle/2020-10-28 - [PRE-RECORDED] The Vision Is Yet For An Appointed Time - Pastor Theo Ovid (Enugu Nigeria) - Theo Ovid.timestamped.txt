[16:31] and the lord answered me and said write
[16:33] the vision
[16:34] i'll make it plain upon tables that he'd
[16:38] run that readed it

[17:32] mercies of god
[17:34] that you present your body is a living
[17:35] sacrifice
[17:37] holy acceptable unto god which is a
[17:40] reasonable service
[17:41] i'll be not conformed to this world but
[17:44] be transformed
[17:46] by the renewing of your mind that you
[17:48] may prove what is that good
[17:50] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[17:53] let us bow ahead so we'll pray heavenly
[17:55] father we
[17:57] we stand in your presence tonight and
[18:00] we are so dependent upon you that you
[18:03] would give the option to speak
[18:05] and the unction to hear bless the
[18:07] hearers of your word lord
[18:09] interpret it to their hearts may they
[18:12] see the plainness of god that they will
[18:14] know how to conduct themselves
[18:16] in the present day that they live in
[18:18] granted father
[18:19] and bring their bodies into the behavior
[18:22] of the word
[18:23] granted god and jesus might ask it amen
[18:26] you may be seated
[18:27] o praise the lord blessed be the name of
[18:30] the lord
[18:38] [Music]
[18:40] but tonight i have a title
[18:44] the vision is yet for an appointed time
[18:49] the vision is yet for an appointed time
[18:52] and i have an inspiration
[18:54] catch the vision and cope with the world
[18:59] that's the inspiration that i have catch
[19:01] the vision
[19:03] and cope with the word
[19:06] now jesus he rebuked his own disciples
[19:12] when they didn't have a real positive
[19:14] testimony
[19:16] when he was talking to them after he
[19:18] rose from the dead
[19:19] he actually told them all fools and slow
[19:22] of heart
[19:23] to believe all that the prophets have
[19:25] spoken
[19:26] ought not christ to have suffered these
[19:28] things
[19:29] and to enter into his glory so he was
[19:32] telling them
[19:32] i mean you're supposed to know this
[19:34] stuff because i told you i'll be offered
[19:36] i told you all these things but he went
[19:39] on and did something to them
[19:41] and he the bible says
[19:45] that these are the words this is
[19:48] luke this is from 2444 which i spoke
[19:51] unto you
[19:52] while i was yet with you that all things
[19:56] must be fulfilled which was written in
[19:59] the law of moses and in the prophets
[20:01] and in the psalms concerning me then
[20:05] open he their understanding
[20:09] that they might understand the
[20:11] scriptures
[20:12] and said unto them thus it is written
[20:15] and does it behooves christ to suffer
[20:19] and arise from the third day or from the
[20:21] dead on the third day
[20:23] and so on and verse 49 he's pretend
[20:26] he's presenting to them so now that he's
[20:28] opened the understanding to the
[20:30] scripture
[20:31] opening the word to them he is
[20:33] presenting to them
[20:34] the vision of what they must expect
[20:37] and what they have to look forward to
[20:40] what was the target
[20:42] what was the endgame what was the goal
[20:45] and he said behold i send the promise
[20:48] of my father upon you but tarry
[20:51] in the city of jerusalem until you be
[20:54] endured
[20:55] with power from on high you'll always
[20:58] say stay there until
[21:00] stay there until this power that has
[21:03] been loosed by my father
[21:05] because i pay the price i pay the price
[21:09] i just come off the cross i am now risen
[21:12] from the dead
[21:13] and now that i have done that nothing
[21:15] could stop the power
[21:17] from being released the power is on its
[21:20] way
[21:21] but be in position to receive it
[21:25] and he jesus led them as far as the
[21:28] bethany
[21:28] he lifted up his hands and blessed them
[21:31] and it came to pass
[21:33] while he blessed them he was part in
[21:35] from them
[21:36] so he was leaving now nobody was crying
[21:39] nobody was depressed nobody was
[21:41] frustrated
[21:42] and jesus was leaving and they worship
[21:45] him
[21:46] and return to jerusalem with great joy
[21:49] he's gone
[21:50] oh hallelujah he have left us glory
[21:55] what do you think happened there jesus
[21:57] told him if i don't go
[22:00] the comforter will not come and they
[22:03] knew he was leaving
[22:05] something else is coming or give the
[22:07] lord a shout in the house
[22:13] oh hallelujah and that is when
[22:17] and they were and they were continually
[22:19] in the temple
[22:20] praising and blessing god because now
[22:22] their mind
[22:23] is open up the understanding is open up
[22:26] the world has been broke to them
[22:28] praise god they don't have to look for
[22:29] some man to interpret more words to them
[22:32] they don't have to look for some bishop
[22:33] somewhere or some man of god from
[22:36] somewhere
[22:37] or a certain man have to come and do
[22:39] this and this certain man did have to
[22:41] look for that no more
[22:43] they got spoken word they got jesus own
[22:46] words
[22:46] they got the breath of god receiving the
[22:49] holy ghost
[22:50] they got the breath of god upon their
[22:52] life no man didn't speak
[22:54] it as god spoke it and we are promised
[22:58] we have been promised according to luke
[23:00] 17 30
[23:02] the son of man would be revealed again
[23:05] that's not a son of man that's the son
[23:08] of man
[23:09] so this son of man was failed in that
[23:11] prophet
[23:12] the son of man was failed in william
[23:15] branham
[23:16] so the words coming on that prophet's
[23:18] mouth wasn't william branham's words
[23:21] watch the words of the son of man and he
[23:24] the son of man
[23:25] who came to abraham he said i will
[23:28] return unto thee
[23:30] according to the time of life
[23:33] there's an appointed time this vision
[23:37] of god this prophetic vision
[23:40] that was released by seven seals and
[23:42] seven thunders
[23:44] there's an appointed time for this
[23:46] vision to be fulfilled
[23:48] but it shall be fulfilled it shall come
[23:50] to pass
[23:52] god swore by himself that ain't going to
[23:55] come to pass
[23:56] oh do you believe that this evening oh
[23:59] glory to god
[24:00] [Applause]
[24:02] hallelujah call you might be caesar
[24:05] oh hallelujah so when god came down
[24:09] in genesis 18 genesis 19 to tell them i
[24:12] will return to thee according to time of
[24:14] light
[24:15] two angels went down to seram under
[24:17] investigating judgment
[24:19] isn't that right but one angel stayed in
[24:22] the backside of the desert with abraham
[24:24] another angel said the lord said shall i
[24:26] hide from abraham
[24:28] the thing which i about to do so god had
[24:31] to break the seals
[24:33] on the back side of the desert to
[24:35] abraham
[24:36] to reveal to abraham judgment was next
[24:39] coming to sodom
[24:40] oh glory to god but abraham as the elect
[24:43] had to get the
[24:44] divine revelation and vision
[24:48] as things that ought to be oh glory to
[24:51] god we believe that
[24:53] and because god broke that upon abraham
[24:57] abraham broke into intercession to plea
[25:00] for lot
[25:01] because luck was a believer backslidden
[25:03] but a believer
[25:05] formal but a believer lukewarm but a
[25:07] believer
[25:08] it was family or glory to god
[25:12] and you cannot break revelation 22 17
[25:16] and the spirit and the bread
[25:20] say come it has to be a scriptural voice
[25:25] oh hallelujah so abraham
[25:28] was anointed with revelation 20 through
[25:31] 17
[25:32] to go after his brother lot oh glory to
[25:35] god isn't that right
[25:37] oh hallelujah praise praise is his
[25:39] family
[25:40] isn't that right and abraham plead
[25:42] before god
[25:43] if there is 50 if there's 25 if there is
[25:46] 10
[25:47] and they couldn't find 10 10 with christ
[25:50] living in them
[25:52] and god sentenced that city to judgment
[25:55] and that same god
[25:57] oh sentence the world to judgment oh
[26:00] hallelujah because we are back to sudden
[26:02] condition today
[26:03] again we are back into sodom condition
[26:05] again and it has to be a manifestation
[26:08] of the revealing of the son of man again
[26:12] but this time in a body bride that is
[26:14] what you're called to do
[26:16] to give one final witness and they're
[26:18] going to be a voice going out the spirit
[26:20] and the prides that come
[26:22] they don't even know what they would
[26:23] what the world is going to head for
[26:25] oh glory i could see a woman going to
[26:28] the bank
[26:29] start among them or she going to collect
[26:30] a pay but they didn't know next morning
[26:32] fire was coming
[26:34] i could see somebody carrying their
[26:35] children amen into the babysitter
[26:38] but they wasn't seeing fire was coming
[26:40] on the backside of the desert
[26:42] seals being open mysteries being
[26:44] revealed
[26:46] vision being made clear and they don't
[26:48] see
[26:49] the seals of judgment is about to be
[26:51] poured out with the wrath of god
[26:53] or glory to god and people have sat so
[26:56] long enough in this message
[26:58] it become ordinary it become normal
[27:01] like if nothing has taken place like if
[27:03] the law delay is coming
[27:05] and they're fighting one another and
[27:07] accusing one another
[27:08] and chopping on one another but the
[27:11] vision
[27:12] is for an appointed time the vision
[27:16] is correct the vision is thus saith the
[27:20] lord
[27:21] we have not been gathered in vain seven
[27:24] thunders

[27:40] bright promise that's why you're here
[27:43] tonight
[27:44] no devil in hell could stop the brand
[27:48] from these promises because the devil
[27:50] himself

[27:55] seventh seal
[27:56] is only the brand ordained
[28:00] to go under there oh hallelujah praise

[30:21] this that's the ambition of
[30:23] of lucifer wanting the kind of worship
[30:26] that we give in our god this morning
[30:28] because the father secrets such to
[30:29] worship him and lucifer got jealous
[30:32] and wanted to worship and we were
[30:35] represented by those angels
[30:37] and we say who you not you
[30:40] you not getting this worship oh glory to
[30:43] god

[30:46] heaven

[32:09] that we could deal with them devils
[32:12] trying to cut us off
[32:14] from the resurrection

[36:08] a policy or whatever to not on
[36:12] on a stretcher came to this church
[36:15] service and
[36:15] and it couldn't get no way in it's
[36:17] packed out
[36:19] nobody got washing him there's no deacon
[36:21] there's nothing they can't come in
[36:23] and those brothers refuse to go back
[36:24] home like that
[36:26] they said we come too far there was no
[36:28] bus there was no taxi there was no car
[36:30] they walked with that guy that was their
[36:32] friend they walk with him
[36:36] because they heard jesus is in town and
[36:38] if jesus is wrong something has to
[36:40] happen
[36:41] jesus either turning water into wine
[36:43] multiplying bread
[36:45] wherever something has to be taken place
[36:48] jesus isn't a quiet man there is always
[36:51] activity around
[36:52] jesus some prostitute being forgiven
[36:55] somebody being healed
[36:56] some blind eye opening some devil being
[36:59] cast out
[37:03] once jesus is wrong
[37:08] [Applause]
[37:12] and what those guys did to tear up the
[37:13] roof and let down the man
[37:16] in front of jesus you think they're
[37:18] wasting time
[37:20] you think the idol you think they don't
[37:22] have faith they have to have faith to
[37:23] climb the roof
[37:24] that's our faith to pull them the guy
[37:26] who on the stretcher had to think that
[37:27] these guys have hit
[37:36] it must have been painful to go up the
[37:38] wall side of that building
[37:40] but when he left in front of jesus he
[37:43] was letting down and coming up in the
[37:45] atmosphere
[37:46] it was all around jesus so he was coming
[37:49] along in the
[37:50] atmosphere my god and jesus said which
[37:53] is easier to say
[37:55] wake up your bed and walk or die still
[37:56] be forgiving me he said which one
[37:58] which one i could do both
[38:05] i can forgive you of your sins and free
[38:08] you
[38:10] from your condition oh you want
[38:13] to go free tonight
[38:14] who the son of man set free
[38:18] it's free indeed oh you can go free
[38:30] tonight
[38:35] may be seated so when god given the
[38:38] promise of the promised land
[38:40] long in egypt the prophet said god came
[38:42] down
[38:43] to make this promise a reality so it's
[38:47] good to say we have a promise
[38:49] but the promise has to become a reality
[38:53] hallelujah glory to god
[38:57] these guys were so inspired god told
[39:00] abraham
[39:01] 100 years before that he was going to do
[39:03] it
[39:04] jesus said don't move my bones i'm here
[39:07] until you go to the promised land
[39:08] and bury me with the rest of my fathers
[39:11] because you know the resurrection was
[39:12] coming
[39:14] oh glory to god each one of them
[39:17] prophets
[39:18] knowed what the other prophet said so
[39:21] they were consulting the prophetic
[39:22] utterance
[39:24] oh glory to god of those men of god that
[39:27] went before them
[39:29] to see what the prophecies say because
[39:31] all of them knew
[39:32] it was men that was moved by the spirit
[39:37] [Applause]
[39:38] so they were not speaking from the
[39:39] intellectual level they were speaking
[39:42] from the intelligence of god
[39:44] that drop down into their heart to give
[39:46] them gossip of the lord
[39:48] [Applause]
[39:53] [Music]
[39:55] so abraham said bury me right here where
[39:56] jew was buried
[39:58] said sarah i'm gonna buy a piece of crap
[39:59] we're gonna be buried right here
[40:01] isaac was a prophet after his dad he
[40:03] said listen do you bury me here don't
[40:04] leave egypt
[40:05] take me right to the promised land oh
[40:07] glory to god
[40:09] so that's how they were you may be
[40:11] seated
[40:12] when joseph died years later he said
[40:14] don't bury me here
[40:16] take my bones with you because
[40:19] god will surely visit you so they were
[40:22] in the spirit
[40:24] they knew our resurrection is promised
[40:26] they were looking for it so much
[40:28] that they could say don't put me don't
[40:29] leave me in egypt because that's a non
[40:31] general pass in egypt at all
[40:33] that anointing is only coming in the
[40:34] promised land if you stay in egypt
[40:37] you can't get this anointing you got
[40:40] what i'm saying
[40:42] glory listen one time one time they were
[40:45] burying a man
[40:47] and they heard some enemy coming and
[40:49] they flicked that man in the grave of
[40:50] elijah and when they just throw him and
[40:52] just run
[40:53] when that body hit elijah pose quickness
[40:56] power
[40:58] quickly
[41:02] listen the bible didn't say that i was a
[41:04] christian that was an ordinary man
[41:07] but when that dead man hit quitting
[41:10] power
[41:10] it bring the dead back to life and if
[41:13] the quickening power
[41:14] on elijah bones could bring a dead man
[41:17] to life
[41:18] what about elijah coats william branham
[41:21] died since 1965
[41:24] and we are resting we are
[41:27] resting on this coach
[41:31] on these words because the spirit
[41:34] the prophet and the bride will say the
[41:37] same thing
[41:39] and what they said would already be said
[41:42] in the world
[41:51] [Applause]
[42:00] oh
[42:08] it's got to be a promise to enter into
[42:10] the rest
[42:12] what to fear that we don't have a
[42:14] promise but we have a promise
[42:16] the promise is to enter into his rest
[42:19] you may be seated
[42:22] [Applause]
[42:28] hallelujah
[42:33] tonight to fight to get into his rest
[42:37] because his rest is the promise what
[42:40] abraham said this year
[42:42] he said watch notice let us there for
[42:45] fear
[42:46] lisa promise being left us to enter into
[42:48] this rest so i want you to remember
[42:50] that unless we final unless god reveal
[42:52] it to us here we go
[42:54] no matter how much we go to church that
[42:56] has nothing to do with it
[42:58] god must come by revelation and reveal
[43:01] himself to
[43:02] us and that takes all the teams of the
[43:05] world
[43:10] that's not good i'm not hearing enough
[43:13] amens on that
[43:14] [Applause]
[43:17] that's something like sixty percent
[43:20] it sounds like a one i had to read it
[43:22] again maybe you didn't get it yet
[43:24] god must come by revelation
[43:28] and reveal himself to us and that takes
[43:31] all the world of
[43:32] all that in the world
[43:39] because once it's being being made plain
[43:42] to you
[43:43] you could run if you read it don't walk
[43:46] you'll run with it
[43:47] because you run with a message it is
[43:50] clear to you
[43:51] that you're not only coming for your
[43:52] soul all your spirit
[43:54] you're coming for your very body itself
[43:57] you want to be completely redeemed
[43:59] oh hallelujah praise god amen
[44:02] brother branham now remember now
[44:05] remember you may be seated they were on
[44:07] their road to rest the pillar of fire
[44:08] led them
[44:09] and we want to find out what is this
[44:11] rest watch
[44:13] so first you have to enter into this
[44:15] rest but you shouldn't come
[44:16] short of it so when you know you have a
[44:18] promise don't come short of it
[44:20] you want to be faithful to the promise
[44:22] of god
[44:23] you want to see it manifested in your
[44:25] life
[44:26] not in the church but in your life
[44:30] and then you could come to church with
[44:31] it in your life
[44:33] you want to start revival in your home
[44:36] you can't start something in the church
[44:38] what you don't have in your home you
[44:40] have to get it on the inside inside
[44:42] that way just when you pray go in the
[44:45] secret closet and pray
[44:46] that your heavenly father who sees in
[44:48] secret will reward
[44:50] you openly oh give the lord a shout
[44:54] hallelujah praise god as the prophet
[44:56] said no minister being a revival
[44:58] the revival have to come for the people
[45:02] you have to
[45:04] [Applause]
[45:07] you have the revival you have to bring
[45:10] it
[45:11] look you're starting it right now right
[45:14] now
[45:15] by your worship by your shouts by your
[45:17] amends by your hallelujah
[45:23] you are creating the atmosphere right
[45:26] now
[45:26] [Applause]
[45:29] may be seated here is the promise
[45:33] here is what we got to fear if there's
[45:36] not a promise left us
[45:39] but the prophet said but there is a
[45:41] promise and the next thing
[45:43] don't come short of it now the thought
[45:46] is
[45:46] if we are on our way to the rest what is
[45:48] the rest where is it
[45:49] it is joining church is it being
[45:51] baptized in a certain way
[45:53] is it becoming a member of the greatest
[45:54] church in the city where in better
[45:56] clothes it is education
[45:57] is it money so we can quit work and just
[45:59] lay down rest the rest of our lives
[46:02] that's not it listen to what the bible
[46:04] says it is
[46:05] let us therefore fear lisa promise left
[46:08] us to enter into
[46:10] his rest that you should come short of
[46:12] it
[46:13] for unto us the gospel was preached as
[46:15] well unto them
[46:16] what is the gospel the good news the
[46:19] good news came to them in egypt that god
[46:21] has sent a deliverer
[46:22] he's going to bring us out and take us
[46:24] to the promised land
[46:25] the good news to us now is that god sent
[46:27] a deliverer
[46:29] the holy ghost and we are on the road to
[46:32] the promised land
[46:33] and the people has made queens and
[46:35] denominations but god still remains
[46:37] that our rest is the holy ghost so this
[46:40] rest
[46:41] is the holy ghost we are pressing
[46:43] towards the holy ghost
[46:45] that's our promised land it's the land
[46:47] of the holy ghost
[46:48] in that land of power in that land of
[46:51] deliverance
[46:52] in that land of freedom in that land of
[46:54] miracles
[46:55] in that manner of anointing in that
[46:57] manner of contact with the supernatural
[46:59] in that land of angels descending angels
[47:02] walking
[47:02] back and forth that's in that land oh
[47:05] it's a good man
[47:07] or he is here tonight oh glory to god
[47:10] amen
[47:11] hallelujah so brother rahm says here
[47:14] the word preached did not prophet them
[47:16] not being mixed with faith
[47:18] and then they heard it so afterwards
[47:20] you'd have to go beyond your shout and
[47:21] praise
[47:22] you have to be praising god and applying
[47:24] it to your own heart
[47:25] he said no no matter how much the word
[47:27] is preached how well you like the way
[47:28] it's been preached
[47:29] unless you yourself are a partaker of
[47:31] that it won't do you one bit of good
[47:34] so you got to say this is minds man i'm
[47:36] taking it tonight
[47:38] am i taking it back home to my wife oh
[47:40] glory to god husband love your wife
[47:42] that's the word
[47:43] oh glory to god you have to express it
[47:45] you have to show it you have to live it
[47:46] take it back home
[47:48] hallelujah praise be to jesus oh glory
[47:51] to god
[47:52] amen hallelujah you may be seated
[47:55] so genesis 1 god said let every seed
[47:58] bring forth after its kind
[48:00] and god could only speak that because
[48:02] god knows the seed of the power to
[48:03] transform itself
[48:05] into whatever the seed is isn't that
[48:07] right
[48:08] and but abraham was talking about
[48:09] transform to be made different to what
[48:11] has been
[48:12] it's character and everything has to be
[48:14] changed and that's the word to be
[48:16] transformed isn't that right and god saw
[48:20] cares and darkness and god saw the
[48:22] condition
[48:23] but that didn't intimidate god darkness
[48:26] and
[48:27] chaos and confusion didn't intimidate
[48:29] god
[48:30] all that has to happen is the spirit
[48:32] have to move
[48:34] and once the spirit moves it has to have
[48:36] a voice
[48:37] because god has to use the voice of his
[48:39] word oh glory to
[48:41] god it's not just the spirit move the
[48:44] spirit have to connect with the voice
[48:46] the voice have to speak and the word
[48:48] becomes that seed
[48:50] to produce the miracle oh glory to god
[48:53] so god transformed chaos into a garden
[48:56] of eden
[48:57] isn't that right everything was perfect
[49:00] he commanded each one of those seas of
[49:02] what they would be
[49:03] that they would transform themselves
[49:06] into the plant of which kind of life
[49:08] that the word of god spoken in them
[49:10] should be if it was an oak tree
[49:13] it was to bring forth an oak it was a
[49:15] palm it was written for the palm
[49:17] because the creator just sent this word
[49:19] and everything under his control
[49:22] now when he put the seed in the earth
[49:23] the seed can only comfort
[49:25] with the power of life within it and
[49:28] that is why
[49:29] god put that seed in you when before the
[49:32] foundation of the world
[49:33] you are not in charge of that seed
[49:35] that's his seed
[49:37] oh glory to god let me say it again
[49:40] you are not in charge of that seed
[49:43] the predestinated mystery of who you are
[49:46] he's in charge of that
[49:47] it's who he for you he called he had to
[49:50] knew you before
[49:51] that's why he called you because he knew
[49:53] the seed where they planted in nigeria
[50:00] your scene whatever village
[50:04] whatever state he had to find you
[50:08] and you know where you are oh glory to
[50:11] god
[50:12] that mother eagle know where you are
[50:14] there's a seed inside of you
[50:16] oh yes you have fleshly habits yes you
[50:19] have your human spirit
[50:20] you didn't even know you had a seed when
[50:22] you were smoking and drinking
[50:24] but god was looking after you all the
[50:26] time because you know one day you have
[50:28] to hear that call
[50:29] you have to hear that call oh glory to
[50:32] god
[50:33] listen we were dead in sin and we heard
[50:36] a call
[50:37] and the people that are dead in the
[50:38] grave they're gonna hear a call one day
[50:40] too
[50:41] oh glory to god god call you the baptist
[50:44] church of methodist church
[50:45] god call you the university of the
[50:48] drunkenness out of adultery of the
[50:49] fornication
[50:50] god could call you further and transform
[50:53] you
[50:54] into a son and daughter of the living
[50:56] god
[50:57] to reproduce and manifest jesus christ
[51:02] do you believe it amen each one of those
[51:05] seeds
[51:06] here we go you may be seated each
[51:09] one of those seeds has the power
[51:13] in itself i love this
[51:16] to transform itself into the species
[51:20] that i desire it to be that is what make
[51:24] me
[51:25] that that's what it must be because i
[51:27] have given every seed
[51:29] here we go transforming power
[51:36] to make out of itself in its potentials
[51:40] now to make out of itself exactly
[51:43] what i want it to be god has
[51:47] never changed and just the same as he
[51:49] was then
[51:50] god is determined to do something
[51:52] nothing is going to stop him
[51:54] and he will do it that's why when god
[51:57] finished with his works
[51:58] he turned his back and rested
[52:02] because you know every single report of
[52:03] this kind stopping after the sky
[52:06] adam after every seed of this kind so
[52:09] god just rested
[52:10] and let the magic work
[52:18] and god acting on this drama come down
[52:21] and say adam
[52:23] like if god is he you got some he said
[52:27] adam where though
[52:29] i hide you gotta see
[52:32] where get away from
[52:37] how are you out of position
[52:40] then then humans start to take over well
[52:44] is the woman they give me you know it's
[52:46] not even me
[52:48] so he began to pass the buck and
[52:50] passable and god came
[52:52] kill a lamb bring this atonement
[52:55] that's very first thing come because
[52:56] death was required
[52:58] so god couldn't spare them he said the
[53:00] day you eat thereof
[53:02] that did you die and there was no
[53:04] gambling house
[53:05] there was no uh drinking house there was
[53:08] just adam eve his wife and
[53:10] a gardener eating and mansfield
[53:17] it had no rockstar and hollywood you
[53:19] know man fell
[53:20] in that environment so man can fall
[53:24] [Applause]
[53:26] anywhere
[53:29] oh oh
[53:33] i thought you wasn't born in sin and
[53:34] shaping integrity i thought it was me
[53:36] alone
[53:37] i thought all of us was born in sin and
[53:39] shape iniquity understand this
[53:41] if god don't hold you you fall
[53:47] let's let's talk
[53:50] [Applause]
[53:54] so don't play more righteous than anyone
[53:57] inside of here
[53:58] if god don't hold you you fall
[54:04] that's why david said i look unto the
[54:06] hills
[54:07] from whence come at my head my health
[54:10] comes from the lord
[54:24] hallelujah i like what
[54:27] isaac said this morning about the
[54:30] tapestry of david's life
[54:32] from a young man the king to the old man
[54:34] to die
[54:35] whole god make sure this life span from
[54:38] childhood go straight up a whole big
[54:40] circle
[54:42] of life and god call him a man after
[54:46] my own heart you may be seated oh praise
[54:49] the name of the lord
[54:50] so then god the power to transform and
[54:53] the devil bring up something to deform
[54:55] and the reform is to take us from his
[54:58] original state
[54:59] make something go wrong with it same
[55:02] seed but messed up
[55:03] same seed but tied up hallelujah we have
[55:07] virgin who's tied up and they deform
[55:09] sometimes they think they straight but
[55:11] they're twisted
[55:13] but there's coming of power and there's
[55:16] coming a prayer
[55:17] they're gonna have revelation 22 17
[55:21] and the voice of that is not go
[55:25] the voice of that has not cut you off i
[55:28] have not agree with you

[56:06] that is your home
[56:09] you're going back home abram was seeking
[56:12] a city
[56:14] whose maker and building is good
[56:17] [Applause]
[56:20] you may be caesar you should see me in
[56:23] my home
[56:24] there's no gray hair there
[56:30] you should see my house
[56:32] [Applause]
[56:34] you should see the street leading to my
[56:36] house my god i see the wandering oh you
[56:38] know
[56:39] i'm not talking about in trinidad that
[56:41] old house
[56:43] oh my god you should see the real one
[56:46] [Applause]
[56:56] i'm gonna be season do you understand
[56:59] that god's objective was to bring back
[57:03] the original man that was supposed to be
[57:06] standing in the garden of eden
[57:09] as if he never did fall
[57:12] that's why god introduced justification
[57:16] not just forgiveness but justification
[57:18] is
[57:19] you never did it we can't even figure
[57:23] that out
[57:24] but god could because only he as far as
[57:27] i know
[57:28] have a sea of forgetfulness
[57:32] everybody remember what you did but when
[57:35] god take
[57:36] your sins
[57:41] and drop it
[57:45] you remember and remember
[57:49] some of the things i've done but jesus
[57:53] with the special blood forgive me
[57:57] of everyone
[58:09] glory tonight
[58:12] under the blood of jesus you stand
[58:15] justified
[58:17] as if you never did it and you'll never
[58:20] get it
[58:21] because god said so
[58:25] oh give the lord a shout
[58:43] may be seated you see you need to get
[58:46] that
[58:47] because that will affect your confidence
[58:50] to approach your throne of grace
[58:52] with boldness you need to get that
[58:55] because that will affect you
[58:57] from going into the angel to say give me
[59:00] a little book
[59:01] because if you're not sure of your
[59:03] salvation
[59:04] of the redemption and predestination you
[59:07] wouldn't even think about going to the
[59:09] angel
[59:09] because you interpret that you're not
[59:11] worthy but the question wasn't if you're
[59:14] worthy
[59:14] jesus died for you to have access
[59:18] to the book
[59:22] satan don't have the password
[59:25] to go into the book access denied
[59:40] no you don't even have to type in a
[59:43] password
[59:44] you could just put your fingerprint he
[59:46] doesn't have your print
[59:48] no you don't even need a print we could
[59:51] just show your face
[59:53] lord jesus your son
[59:58] and the book opens to you the vision
[1:00:01] breaks
[1:00:02] what the lord is about to do
[1:00:09] hallelujah
[1:00:12] i told him back home you may be seated i
[1:00:15] said they go outside on the street level
[1:00:17] you see in this street that street that
[1:00:19] street
[1:00:20] if you fight at that level you would
[1:00:22] lose you only seen the street
[1:00:25] i said but if you go in a helicopter you
[1:00:27] would see beyond the streets
[1:00:29] you will see the village you go higher
[1:00:31] you see the city
[1:00:32] you go higher you see the state you go
[1:00:34] higher you see nigeria
[1:00:36] you go higher you start to see ghana you
[1:00:38] start to see the whole of africa
[1:00:39] because you're going higher and the
[1:00:41] higher goal you see a bigger vision
[1:00:43] and the vision when you come down to the
[1:00:45] street now it changes perspective
[1:00:48] because you see a broader picture you
[1:00:50] see the enemy coming down the road
[1:00:52] you know you coming along the streets so
[1:00:53] you're moving on that street or you're
[1:00:55] cutting more fear
[1:00:56] because god takes you up into a vision
[1:00:58] and when you come down from that vision
[1:01:00] you are invincible because you know the
[1:01:02] next move
[1:01:03] and that's what god did to abraham shall
[1:01:05] i hide from abraham what i'm about to do
[1:01:07] just think you are here and cause about
[1:01:09] to break a seventh on the revival
[1:01:14] it's about to break
[1:01:20] you'll be seated oh man you'll be seated
[1:01:25] so caught up in that helicopter gives
[1:01:27] you a bigger vision
[1:01:29] hallelujah inspired vision that's why
[1:01:32] brother brown was so caught up he's i
[1:01:34] see the bright cold
[1:01:35] i see she's sealed into the cave where
[1:01:38] he where is he talking from
[1:01:40] he's talking from up there he see you
[1:01:42] sealed
[1:01:43] he said oh god so close i could feel it
[1:01:48] my god sons of god going down the
[1:01:50] streets and praise god silvan gold
[1:01:53] having none
[1:01:54] he said god help me live to see it he
[1:01:56] said it's so close
[1:01:58] i could see it missing limbs being
[1:02:01] restored
[1:02:02] the prophet prophesy missing limbs
[1:02:07] that's why i'm excited because we have a
[1:02:10] lot to look forward to
[1:02:11] [Applause]
[1:02:17] there's a lot of negative lots of
[1:02:19] negative we could go into
[1:02:21] but we're not talking about that we're
[1:02:22] talking about bridal promises
[1:02:24] and the vision that had to be clear to
[1:02:25] you because when those guys got the
[1:02:28] vision from jesus
[1:02:29] they were clean and clear about what
[1:02:31] they were about
[1:02:32] that's why they're waking up a room and
[1:02:34] they waited in fear
[1:02:39] it's not that they were they were
[1:02:40] spoiled and no no they were fearful
[1:02:43] but they know what they're expecting
[1:02:45] power to take away that fear
[1:02:47] they were nervous but power control i
[1:02:49] take over all of that
[1:02:50] this power is promised i love it i love
[1:02:53] it i love it
[1:02:55] oh glory to god in the upper room was
[1:02:58] pastor and congregation
[1:03:00] a porcelain congregation bishop and
[1:03:02] congregation everybody was up in upper
[1:03:04] room
[1:03:04] your heart wants to hit the upper room
[1:03:06] because power is from the father
[1:03:08] oh do you believe that tonight oh glory
[1:03:11] to god
[1:03:12] hallelujah amen amen amen
[1:03:16] glory to god so before
[1:03:20] before the word can be manifested a seed
[1:03:22] has to be spoken
[1:03:24] let there be let there be let there be
[1:03:26] that's the word seed
[1:03:28] and then it's manifested is the real
[1:03:30] seed so god has to speak you first
[1:03:33] [Applause]
[1:03:36] so you are thought by pastors you often
[1:03:38] need a word
[1:03:39] god sent a prophet to connect you back
[1:03:41] with your word so when you hear the word
[1:03:43] preach
[1:03:44] you connect with it because the word is
[1:03:46] an expression of you
[1:03:48] the thought of what you are you are
[1:03:50] become a world expression
[1:03:51] so you have to connect with the word oh
[1:03:54] glory to god you can't help it
[1:03:56] it's part of your makeup it's part of
[1:03:58] your core
[1:03:59] it's part of the gene in your soul you
[1:04:02] can't help it
[1:04:03] i'm going to be a perfect man on the
[1:04:05] earth i'm going to be a
[1:04:07] perfect man because that is my seed
[1:04:13] [Music]
[1:04:16] [Applause]
[1:04:18] whatever i'm talking about ministers
[1:04:19] could be halfway god will make halfway
[1:04:21] preachers
[1:04:22] but creatures can be halfway reason they
[1:04:24] get their own weird
[1:04:26] messed up and interrupted programmer god
[1:04:28] for their lives
[1:04:29] but god don't make half preachers he
[1:04:31] makes full preachers
[1:04:32] he put something in tears to teach
[1:04:34] preachers to preach
[1:04:36] isn't that right but the thing about it
[1:04:38] we could get mixed up and messed up in
[1:04:39] our own human spirit
[1:04:41] and affect the program of god because
[1:04:43] god wants to be conductors of the spirit
[1:04:46] so we have to become the word isn't that
[1:04:48] right and once you become the word then
[1:04:50] you become a conductor
[1:04:51] that the spirit can flow through our
[1:04:53] gift is not messing up and doing
[1:04:55] a lot of things i'll give his hope to
[1:04:56] come out of the way
[1:04:58] if i come out of the way tonight who is
[1:04:59] speaking
[1:05:02] you say a brother have a gift the gift
[1:05:03] is how to come out of the way
[1:05:05] that the holy spirit could operate and
[1:05:07] speak through that gift
[1:05:09] where the teaching gives a prophetic
[1:05:10] gift whatever gift it is
[1:05:12] it's how they cut out of the way and
[1:05:14] once man move out god moves in you hear
[1:05:16] from god
[1:05:18] and you know you hear from god oh glory
[1:05:20] to god
[1:05:21] so sin john 14 12 is a seed the same
[1:05:24] works i do shall you do also
[1:05:26] saint john 15 7 is a seed if you abide
[1:05:28] in me in my words i bury you you can ask
[1:05:30] what you will
[1:05:31] sin mark 16 is a seed these signs shall
[1:05:34] follow them that believe
[1:05:36] not maybe not perhaps these signs shall
[1:05:39] follow them
[1:05:40] not you follow signs signs following you
[1:05:43] wherever you go the signs are right
[1:05:46] behind you
[1:05:47] you can't help it because this is the
[1:05:50] word
[1:05:51] you can't help it because this is true
[1:05:55] [Applause]
[1:06:03] so when god made man you may be ceased
[1:06:05] in his own image
[1:06:06] after his kind the bible says what is
[1:06:09] his kind
[1:06:10] the word
[1:06:11] [Applause]
[1:06:14] so the man that god made was word kind
[1:06:17] not interpretation kind
[1:06:19] word kind of thing
[1:06:23] you see man like to follow force
[1:06:25] interpretation because man make it
[1:06:28] that easy to believe because god
[1:06:32] is saying
[1:06:36] it's easy for it's easy for abraham to
[1:06:39] believe
[1:06:40] to go to hagar to have a child
[1:06:43] that they believe all wrinkles syrup go
[1:06:46] have it
[1:06:47] so that's why abram could move like that
[1:06:49] because when god
[1:06:50] shake abraham with vision of isaac he's
[1:06:53] seen the baby
[1:06:55] but when you look at syria he say oh
[1:06:58] lord
[1:07:04] abraham is true sarah so he got divorcer
[1:07:10] you have to treat that woman right
[1:07:12] whatever she is you want to cook
[1:07:14] something she don't want to put food on
[1:07:15] the table someday it doesn't matter
[1:07:17] that is still zero it's true that woman
[1:07:20] he will get that promise
[1:07:22] so abraham had to walk right
[1:07:25] talk right
[1:07:29] and make sure sarah don't leave him
[1:07:35] because god didn't talk to sarah
[1:07:38] poor sarah sarah only watching the
[1:07:40] mirror and say good lord
[1:07:44] but abraham believe god not sarah grey
[1:07:48] here
[1:07:49] not sarah wrinkle not sarah grumpy
[1:07:56] and the bible consider him a hero of
[1:07:58] faith
[1:07:59] father of faith and it's so accurate is
[1:08:02] he
[1:08:03] listening ibrahim at false ibrahim
[1:08:05] struggle but when when they start to
[1:08:06] write
[1:08:07] his testimonial the bible said he
[1:08:09] staggered
[1:08:10] not at the promise of god to unbelief
[1:08:14] sign god god signed that that sign
[1:08:18] already
[1:08:19] you can't question that testimonial but
[1:08:21] who signed it
[1:08:23] staggered not it's written staggered
[1:08:27] and tonight we have not staggered
[1:08:31] we stand on that rock
[1:08:36] if i perish i perish
[1:08:40] but i'm going in
[1:08:52] [Applause]
[1:08:57] this vision can't change
[1:08:59] [Applause]
[1:09:03] do it terry
[1:09:04] [Applause]
[1:09:17] i am not frustrated i am not tired
[1:09:21] i am not fed up faith has an anchor
[1:09:25] faith is a long-range vision faith don't
[1:09:28] back down
[1:09:39] i'm fate listen listen fit knows how to
[1:09:43] [Applause]
[1:09:46] wait
[1:09:52] [Applause]
[1:10:00] appreciated
[1:10:02] here a man of vision leave here
[1:10:06] a woman of vision leave here a pass our
[1:10:10] vision
[1:10:10] don't just go to the motion get a vision
[1:10:17] all the vision the people perish
[1:10:20] know the vision may be seated
[1:10:33] [Applause]
[1:10:38] [Music]
[1:10:41] right in your own country you see people
[1:10:42] with vision you go to one city and see
[1:10:44] so different from another city
[1:10:46] we've got this bishop for this governor
[1:10:48] who are not here ripping off the money
[1:10:49] and corrupt as ever
[1:10:51] roads are this way the city the
[1:10:53] country's this way there's the
[1:10:54] atmosphere that is there
[1:10:55] because the man have no vision he just
[1:10:58] in power
[1:10:59] but no vision no heart for the people
[1:11:06] the romans when they took over they
[1:11:09] brought the
[1:11:10] roads and transportation that's how
[1:11:13] goods and services start to
[1:11:14] get through all in europe all over also
[1:11:17] about plagues
[1:11:19] but that's how the rats and and and
[1:11:22] diseases was
[1:11:22] able to spread but every one of those
[1:11:25] kingdoms brought
[1:11:26] something to the plate daniel saw the
[1:11:29] unfolding of these kingdoms
[1:11:31] one by one but then daniel saw a stone
[1:11:35] cut out with all the hands of man
[1:11:40] the coming of that headstone and the
[1:11:42] brotherham said the pringle was never
[1:11:44] kept
[1:11:44] but it will be kept and you will be
[1:11:47] capped
[1:11:48] because brother branham slip a pyramid
[1:11:50] inside of you
[1:11:52] a pyramid inside of you and the capstone
[1:11:55] of love
[1:11:57] have to come upon you
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:12:03] the love of god have to come upon you
[1:12:05] which is the bond of perfectness
[1:12:08] because we have to speak to the killable
[1:12:11] we have to talk bull language
[1:12:29] passing through this field he forgets
[1:12:31] his gun god alone if i get the gun
[1:12:33] he forget about the killer bull all of a
[1:12:35] sudden when you middle the field here
[1:12:36] comes killable
[1:12:38] nobody branham he said if he had the gun
[1:12:40] back sparks
[1:12:41] oh shoot it pay for it
[1:12:45] go home everything settled
[1:12:48] but he didn't have pax packs had no gun
[1:12:53] and watching the ball he said this is it
[1:12:55] and something came over here
[1:12:59] that's what we're talking about
[1:13:04] listen what ram didn't say killable look
[1:13:07] a quote look at coach
[1:13:08] look i've caught the mystery of the
[1:13:11] trumpets

[1:16:54] one moment there
[1:16:55] got to be people that will be affected
[1:16:59] by this bright ministry just as abraham

[1:17:03] just as the spirit hunt after adam and
[1:17:05] the garden of eden
[1:17:07] god will give you a part of this
[1:17:09] redemption plan
[1:17:10] to collect the last seeds in your area

[1:17:27] brother branham the seven angels message
[1:17:32] is to open the mystery of the seals
[1:17:35] calling the 11 hour gentile workers to
[1:17:38] receive the same pay
[1:17:40] that the first hours received simply
[1:17:43] so all this serious opening mystery has
[1:17:45] been revealed it's for purpose
[1:17:48] it's for pay for salad reading
[1:17:53] same thing if you don't know what pay is
[1:17:55] salary
[1:17:56] when you go to collect the money you
[1:17:58] offer for the month that's what we're
[1:17:59] talking about
[1:18:01] same pay not pentecostal salary
[1:18:05] we don't want a pentecostal's titan
[1:18:07] you're supposed to get 7000 a month and
[1:18:09] against 700.
[1:18:10] you holding on to 700 until you get like
[1:18:13] if you're
[1:18:14] doing doctor or something you have the
[1:18:15] internship i don't know if it's getting
[1:18:17] my stipend and whatnot but you can't get
[1:18:19] you're not a real doctor yet
[1:18:21] you have you're looking to be confirmed
[1:18:23] so when you get confirmed in the
[1:18:25] position you get a different salary
[1:18:27] so in the meantime you have something to
[1:18:28] keep you going
[1:18:30] we don't want you to drop out so we keep
[1:18:33] you with give god give you something
[1:18:35] to keep you going but the same pay is
[1:18:37] coming

[1:18:41] get the same pay
[1:18:43] so you wouldn't short yourself
[1:18:47] no if if if you don't find yourself
[1:18:50] worthy of that pay you could still
[1:18:54] thanks for the blessing as good as that
[1:18:58] no you have to want
[1:19:02] cmp not more not more
[1:19:05] you're doing one more you want simply
[1:19:09] because peter cursed peter denied christ
[1:19:13] and peter get paid

[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:20] do you see what i'm saying peter said i

[1:19:26] pedicure fully come he got his full pace
[1:19:36] didn't say peter as your curse have paid
[1:19:38] and you're doing this quarter pay
[1:19:40] and this is no no same thing
[1:19:49] that pain was so powerful that when a
[1:19:52] nurse and the pharah came into the
[1:19:54] church
[1:19:55] and they think digest brother peter you
[1:19:57] know whatever we do deny christ
[1:19:58] three times and they're talking here you
[1:20:01] see
[1:20:05] i never deny him but you're a liar
[1:20:09] [Applause]
[1:20:12] and peter had his pay so the pillar of
[1:20:15] fire
[1:20:16] was on the throne in peter's heart and
[1:20:19] brother and i
[1:20:19] and sister sapphira come in the church
[1:20:21] thinking like jet brother peter oh i
[1:20:23] know him a long time ago
[1:20:26] they come lying peter say you're lying
[1:20:28] to the holy ghost and then pluck them
[1:20:29] out dead
[1:20:31] wife come and the wife knows she lives
[1:20:32] on this liar a long time she lives on
[1:20:34] any man she must know he's a liar
[1:20:36] she's blocking him she defending the lie
[1:20:38] too
[1:20:39] they packs you out too after that nobody
[1:20:42] is joining that church like that you
[1:20:43] know he got by saying and god added to
[1:20:45] the church
[1:20:46] no man joined themselves when the power
[1:20:49] of god started to manifest himself
[1:20:51] there are those who are going to fly out
[1:20:52] the church full speed they're not even
[1:20:54] looking back
[1:20:55] because there will be fire bombs
[1:20:57] there'll be missiles
[1:20:59] there'll be dynamites there'll be an
[1:21:01] explosion
[1:21:02] the fire got refined back and dear
[1:21:05] praise god you get your life in order or
[1:21:07] you get out
[1:21:08] oh the thing will be hot now
[1:21:12] do i hear a rumble in the house do i
[1:21:15] hear a shulk in the house
[1:21:17] or you're starting to get nervous
[1:21:19] already you could start to get nervous
[1:21:22] because it's coming this is part of
[1:21:26] division
[1:21:28] we're going to have another book of acts
[1:21:30] oh glory to god let me see if i could
[1:21:32] wrap up somewhere here now
[1:21:33] what abraham says the evil time message
[1:21:35] is to restore back again
[1:21:37] to bring back the same thing oh glory to
[1:21:40] god just a little more again
[1:21:43] praise god but i'm talking about the
[1:21:45] holy church united and this was made
[1:21:47] possible
[1:21:47] when god sent the seven seals and give
[1:21:50] us a sign by it
[1:21:51] and send seven angels down all the
[1:21:52] heaven and come to bring back
[1:21:55] the scattered word in their
[1:21:56] denominations and
[1:21:58] tie it back into the word again what's
[1:22:00] the purpose
[1:22:01] to bring down his holy spirit so the
[1:22:04] object
[1:22:05] of the seals being open picking up all
[1:22:07] this scattered word
[1:22:09] tying it back in the word to present
[1:22:11] this vision
[1:22:12] of faith back to the people is to bring
[1:22:15] back the holy ghost
[1:22:16] why would god send a prophet to turn our
[1:22:18] hearts back to the faith of the fathers
[1:22:20] that fear is to do what that faith is to
[1:22:23] pull down what
[1:22:24] that faith is to anoint what to say we
[1:22:26] have a church
[1:22:27] to say my church better than your church
[1:22:29] to say i have a bigger ministry than
[1:22:30] your ministry
[1:22:31] that's not what the faith is for the
[1:22:33] faith is to bring on the power
[1:22:35] what's the power for to transform your
[1:22:37] life
[1:22:38] because in the seed and you have a life
[1:22:42] and when that light in that seed in you
[1:22:44] meet the life of the spirit
[1:22:46] they're going to transform you into what
[1:22:49] you're supposed to be
[1:22:51] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:22:54] glory to the god he said the church has
[1:22:57] brought the holy ghost
[1:22:58] for nearly two thousand years on the
[1:23:01] martyrdom it's been bombed
[1:23:02] not at the river euphrates but at the
[1:23:04] door of trees and dogmas you may be
[1:23:06] seated
[1:23:06] that the holy spirit can't work in the
[1:23:08] church here's why
[1:23:10] because of man-made systems but she is
[1:23:12] going to be liberated
[1:23:14] prophecy the church is going to be
[1:23:16] liberated
[1:23:17] oh glory the holy spirit has been bombed
[1:23:20] by these nominational rivers for two
[1:23:21] thousand years
[1:23:22] but is to be loosed in the evening time
[1:23:26] by the evening time message the evil
[1:23:28] time message is you know what
[1:23:30] loose the holy ghost what are we
[1:23:32] supposed to be looking for
[1:23:34] the holy ghost what are we supposed to
[1:23:36] be expecting
[1:23:37] the holy ghost what is the holy ghost
[1:23:39] the rest what is the holy ghost the
[1:23:41] promised land

[1:23:52] if it happened amongst the people
[1:23:53] tonight if all america all the people
[1:23:56] that call himself christian
[1:23:57] would rally around god's gift in this
[1:23:59] last day
[1:24:00] the pouring out of the holy ghost upon
[1:24:02] the people
[1:24:03] that is god's gift in the last day
[1:24:06] is the holy spirit oh that's where we
[1:24:10] could rally around
[1:24:11] oh not doctrine not teachings but the
[1:24:14] holy spirit
[1:24:15] we need power thing but isaac read the
[1:24:17] quote national force but israel in the
[1:24:19] world comes
[1:24:20] a national force for the churches to
[1:24:22] work on the churches but the power of

[1:24:26] labored we have strife we have
[1:24:28] sown seeds and so on but it was take

[1:35:08] i wouldn't read it tonight
[1:35:09] but he said god want to help you more
[1:35:11] than you want help
[1:35:12] god can't wait to help you god want to
[1:35:15] help you
[1:35:16] more than you want help
[1:35:19] that's why you're supposed to be
[1:35:20] shouting tonight because the mercy of
[1:35:23] god
[1:35:24] is what brought this message to us from
[1:35:26] malachi 4.
[1:35:28] oh let me see if we can wrap up here now
[1:35:30] glory to god
[1:35:32] hallelujah glory to god amen
[1:35:35] [Applause]
[1:35:37] so what about unless another message and
[1:35:40] in that message have a promise of
[1:35:41] dynamics
[1:35:43] don't let nobody take that promise away
[1:35:45] from you
[1:35:46] we are looking for the spirit to come
[1:35:49] upon the bride
[1:35:50] we're looking for dynamics to come upon
[1:35:52] that word inside of you
[1:35:54] he used to bring back that fate and
[1:35:56] barbara says he said what we see
[1:35:59] oh i'll go skip that oh praise god oh my
[1:36:02] my my my my
[1:36:04] so this whole message this whole
[1:36:06] prophetic vision that the prophet
[1:36:08] brought
[1:36:08] was to really set us up to receive the
[1:36:10] intelligence of god
[1:36:12] the mind of god in this age of knowledge
[1:36:14] increase
[1:36:15] we cannot go uh just like he said anyhow
[1:36:19] just anyway hoping things going to work
[1:36:21] out that's not how god sends
[1:36:23] instructions
[1:36:25] jericho instruction was specific walk
[1:36:27] around once a day
[1:36:28] on the seven days seven times specific
[1:36:30] to take jericho
[1:36:32] god will be given specific instructions
[1:36:34] so the men of god gonna be anointed
[1:36:37] with the will of god to bring specific
[1:36:39] instructions
[1:36:40] that god will test your obedience
[1:36:43] because you have to be able to cope with
[1:36:44] the word
[1:36:45] you have to catch the vision and then
[1:36:47] cope with the word
[1:36:48] if that is what god said i have to cope
[1:36:50] with it don't twist it
[1:36:53] don't try to adjust it don't try to
[1:36:55] soften it don't try to water it down
[1:36:57] this is the word we have to cope with it
[1:37:06] you may be caesar listen god tell joshua
[1:37:10] every place you put your foot is yours
[1:37:11] no man shall be able to stand before

[1:38:52] to be bringing all these promises and
