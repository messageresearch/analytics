[31:22] message I didn't understand a lot of
[31:24] things he was talking about I didn't
[31:25] understand it but something inside of me
[31:27] say this nothing but the truth
[31:31] amen and I what convinced me this myth
[31:35] had a powerful experience in New York
[31:37] but the relator was there they really
[31:40] changed my life it was more powerful
[31:43] than any Pentecost experience I've ever
[31:45] had a man I said lord I don't know what
[31:47] they're talking about God's son a
[31:48] prophet and all seven of the seven seals
[31:51] all this but I said something to it amen
[31:55] and I went back home to my church we had
[31:57] about by 200 people and I was come
[31:59] against at that time and I had to meet
[32:02] with my church and I met with my church
[32:06] that told us say now first thing I said
[32:08] we have no more women preachers in this
[32:11] church as CEO I had five look at that
[32:17] and I made a statement under the while I
[32:20] made the statement I said I don't know
[32:21] what I'm gonna be preaching but I will
[32:23] not be preaching what I've been
[32:24] preaching that's mistaken for past
[32:27] supper standing in front of this
[32:28] convocation saying it's a boy
[32:30] you could imagine what happened I knew
[32:34] what I had wasn't sufficient I knew what
[32:37] I had wasn't enough to sustain me I knew
[32:39] that I needed more this message came in
[32:43] came into my life amen
[32:45] and I was willing brother Theo to lose
[32:47] my whole church for this message and I
[32:50] knew nothing about it I never ran a
[32:52] spoken word book never heard of tape of
[32:54] her on the random you know I knew
[32:56] nothing about the best my wife was
[32:58] reading the books these the old spoken
[33:00] word books you know she was night
[33:01] reading these books and I was like honey
[33:03] you better put some books down and get
[33:05] your Bible she said no this is the word
[33:07] I said now I'm gonna stick with the
[33:09] Bible but she kept praying for me so you
[33:14] come and I said I have arrived already
[33:17] raised why she kept praying for me but
[33:20] that experience that I had a New York
[33:22] City convinced me that this business of
[33:24] God and I tell you I want to take
[33:27] nothing in this world for this message

[40:35] brother oh it's this morning but I
[40:40] everyone after the gift of Jesus Christ
[40:44] in his heart
[40:45] and so we are different but one thing
[40:49] brother open I appreciate this this
[40:51] morning it was like a fresh wind came in
[40:56] when you said I'm not in South Africa
[41:00] I'm in heavenly places that was said was
[41:05] from your heart and I like this this is
[41:10] where we are where we should be we
[41:13] should be in a place where there's no
[41:15] sin no sickness no trouble no filthiness
[41:21] and God sees this world like this and he
[41:26] should see it the same way it's this few
[41:30] is called say kingdom of God and then
[41:33] Aparna gave me our inner brother branham
[41:36] said I'm since 33 years I'm in heavenly
[41:40] places and I never came out listen
[41:43] that I never came out I checked myself
[41:49] and I have to do some repentance because
[41:54] this is something is that I never come
[41:58] out and have the confidence I've said I
[42:01] will never come out in my life so he
[42:06] lived in that in that realm and Peter
[42:12] and all of them first disciples say live
[42:17] in that realm no demon could come into
[42:23] this realm where they lived there was a
[42:26] presence of God with them all the time
[42:28] so praise the Lord and I also enjoy it
[42:32] my son was showing me a video clip where
[42:36] I've said all the pastors came in front
[42:38] and and identified themselves missus let
[42:45] me read the scripture my title is Lord
[42:48] prepare me and the scripture is found in
[42:51] chain st. John 17 24 and revelation 20
[43:01] 22 20 cents on 17 verse 24 and she and
[43:15] here Jesus says he is praying and
[43:19] remember you shouldn't even pray when
[43:23] you don't believe what you pray and just
[43:26] pray Lord prepare me you shouldn't do
[43:30] this
[43:31] it's a prayer we pray we sing it and we
[43:35] believe in the Paris and so Jesus he
[43:39] believes what he is praying listen what
[43:41] he is praying father I will that they
[43:44] all also whom thou has given me be wispy
[43:49] and where I am that they may behold my
[43:54] glory which thou has given me for thou
[43:57] lovest me before the foundation of the
[44:00] world and just before he said it is not
[44:04] only for them for this my disciples but
[44:08] also for Sam said well here's a verb
[44:11] through them for them it is also and he
[44:14] prayed also for you and for me and his
[44:18] prayer will be fulfilled hallelujah and
[44:23] and if you get catch the inspiration
[44:26] this is not when the doctor says it's
[44:28] all finished this is for right now for
[44:33] this life to be with him all the time to
[44:37] have him with us all the time so we
[44:41] don't have to be scared and fear
[44:42] anything
[44:43] in Jesus name God bless you you may be
[44:46] seated
[44:48] so praise praise the Lord my remembrance
[44:54] goes back to 1981 in December we were I
[44:59] think it was Pretoria first Pretoria
[45:03] first and I have a special remembrance
[45:07] here brother Coleman preached a message
[45:12] sales speak to the rock and we have a
[45:16] quote also said I will mention after
[45:18] from speak to the rock and but what
[45:21] really touched me what I have in my
[45:25] remembrance was a song says the gale was
[45:28] singing as special and she was singing
[45:33] that was 37 years ago on the platform
[45:38] this song it sounds like this if I
[45:43] really have it in my remembers make me
[45:45] pure make me clean this is a prayer so
[45:50] that you might be seen make me a
[45:53] blessing Lord wherever I would be this
[45:55] is some part that I remember us together
[45:57] now eight weeks later I was in the
[46:01] hospital in intensive care
[46:03] this is diagnosed heart attack
[46:06] for three days laying there this song
[46:19] always the invited day and night been
[46:27] through me all the machines around me
[46:34] resistor whenever you sing a special
[46:38] sing from your experience you may not
[46:43] know what will happen what will be
[46:49] happening to these believers said are
[46:53] listening to the voice of an experienced
[46:57] we have to become more sincere because
[47:00] this hair-pull has to do something with
[47:03] sincerity and with your heart it was
[47:07] sister Hetty right she spoke from the
[47:09] heart
[47:10] it was this brother Luke and this
[47:16] prophecy fishes you know where the fish
[47:18] was come back to life they spoke to one
[47:23] another that we should go to this lady
[47:26] and tell her that we became Christians
[47:29] and brother Brennan many Herod's you see
[47:32] that was spoken from the heart and it it
[47:36] started something so it's so important
[47:41] to speak from the heart the truth and
[47:47] God does something it does something in
[47:51] these meetings this is very important
[47:55] brother Coleman in Port Elizabeth 1981
[48:02] is present when I'm here is he is he
[48:06] still here you he was here I don't see
[48:10] him but who was there in 81 in Port
[48:13] Elizabeth oh oh we have good remembrance
[48:18] we have good remembrance brother Coleman
[48:21] was standing behind the platform and it
[48:24] was a real quiet auditorium he wasn't
[48:28] useless because it was a complaint there
[48:32] that people made too much noise and so
[48:37] brother Roscoe said to his church people
[48:40] stay in the back and no clapping no
[48:44] amens this time brother Coleman came in
[48:47] the in the pulpit and sent before a real
[48:50] quiet congregation and then he is he
[48:55] talks a quote from Daniel where Daniel
[48:59] was had a division of the man standing
[49:03] on the water and you remember this and
[49:06] he compared it to a revelation 10 to
[49:11] revelation 10 the angel coming down
[49:13] having his phone is first put on the
[49:15] water and one on the on the land and he
[49:18] compared it and he said I'm standing now
[49:22] before real quiet congregation and he
[49:27] said but if you don't want it then stand
[49:31] on me and proclaim time no longer and he
[49:38] said when Shopp got such a revelation he
[49:42] fell on his face but you go out and say
[49:46] it was a nice sermon and send the Holy
[49:50] Ghost in the people in the pack couldn't
[49:53] keep it any longer they couldn't keep it
[49:55] any longer
[49:56] say I'm screaming in front and we had an
[49:59] outpouring of the Holy Ghost for about
[50:01] one hour you were several Dovan and yeah
[50:06] you were saying and brother Peter
[50:08] Chandler was on the platform yeah he was
[50:10] he was here and and down you went
[50:14] brother Peter in the glory of God was
[50:16] poured all over over the place now he
[50:19] spoke our Comment spoke from his heart
[50:22] he said what he felt and he remembered
[50:26] but it is not right said we react like
[50:30] this when the revelation
[50:32] comes like this in the Holy Ghost in the
[50:34] people also made some - something real
[50:38] from their heart
[50:39] nobody had to tell them come come in
[50:42] front coming from - this jump or
[50:44] whatever it worked by itself it works by
[50:47] itself hallelujah and it specially works
[50:51] in your home the needs the same
[50:54] anointing behind the pulpit we need in
[50:57] our living room then our children will
[51:00] be filled with Holy Ghost in the living
[51:02] room

[52:32] gives him a special day in Jesus name
[52:35] Amen
[52:37] be seated so as I said my tightness Lord
[52:42] prepare me and and I want to mention
[52:49] again the spirit of Priscilla kindness
[52:52] on the pastor's that came to the
[52:55] platform at the end of your message
[52:56] proverb brother of it could that be a
[53:00] sign for a beginning healing of the
[53:02] sickest bodies the body of Jesus Christ
[53:05] healing comes to this body by two things
[53:09] the Prophet set by brotherly kindness
[53:11] and by the word the word is restored and
[53:16] brotherly love is our part and if you
[53:21] don't know where you find it you find it
[53:23] at Calvary all these glorious things to
[53:27] find it Calvary hallelujah
[53:30] there's a prophecy of brother Branham as
[53:33] brother
[53:34] Thompson mentioned in one of his
[53:37] messages brother Branham is crying out
[53:39] he gets into a vision he says I see
[53:43] something say will be one of these days
[53:47] don't feel a little preacher they will
[53:51] be one why Jesus Christ prayed he said
[53:56] say maybe one and his prayer will be
[53:59] fulfilled
[54:00] no devil can't change this hallelujah
[54:03] praise the Lord and there is a prayer of
[54:09] Jesus Christ in st. change 1:17 set will
[54:13] be fulfilled
[54:14] amen so the glory said Jesus had with a
[54:18] father this is John 17:5 22 26 I don't
[54:25] read it do you you know his prayer the
[54:28] prayer of our Lord Jesus in John's st.
[54:31] John 17 so he said so zyk Lord excuse me
[54:36] so the glory is that Jesus had with the
[54:38] father before the world was
[54:41] it's very important now in in st. John
[54:46] 17:17 he says he speaks about as he said
[54:50] father glorify myself with the glories
[54:54] that I had before you before this world
[54:58] came in their existence so you have your
[55:05] idea about what kind of glorious is is
[55:09] we would like to find out because there
[55:15] is an also promise in him in a message
[55:19] from brother Branham the glory of God
[55:24] this is a unspoken message only written
[55:27] out prepared for December 25 1965 he
[55:33] couldn't preach it anymore but in his
[55:36] notes he is here I got a copy from
[55:40] brother Coleman or actually he allowed
[55:42] us to make a photo picture he had it on
[55:45] his table in his living room and he
[55:47] allowed us and but I feel it's so
[55:50] important said we should share this for
[55:53] the ones had never heard it brother
[55:57] Branham had written out his glory came
[56:00] down to mosey on a range in Midian four
[56:04] thousand years ago his glory came down
[56:08] to Shepherds on a range in Bethlehem
[56:11] 2,000 years ago his glory came down on a
[56:16] range in Arizona three and a half years
[56:19] open to us seven seal mystery of his
[56:25] verbs said had he written out on one
[56:31] page in his notes hallelujah so his
[56:37] glory came down sick glory said Jesus
[56:42] said glorify me reset glories that I had
[56:45] before the foundation of the world with
[56:48] you his glory came down and did
[56:52] something now if he didn't did it one
[56:56] time two times three times in a special
[57:00] basis serve time
[57:01] so he can do it also for you and for me
[57:05] to do the same thing because we know and
[57:09] not a lot of quotes and of the message
[57:13] and of the word but to catch the life in
[57:19] the world for our soul that's what we
[57:22] want
[57:23] hallelujah now God's glory is his divine
[57:28] nature it's his nature his glory is his
[57:32] attributes did you ever see this pyramid
[57:37] what's written inside said this is God's
[57:41] glory you will appreciate that and this
[57:48] makes us one as process with different
[57:52] ideas coming from different churches
[57:55] brother Branham said the first 20 years
[57:59] or how it was in the first time after
[58:01] Pentecost everybody was satisfied with
[58:04] Jesus Christ and and the great
[58:09] atmosphere in the hearts of the people
[58:12] and it's ended since something started
[58:15] but became bigger and darker and darker
[58:18] all through the ages something started
[58:21] he said it started little fellowships
[58:26] somebody had a revelations on brother
[58:29] and they grouped around him his Sahab
[58:34] was very innocent said he said they were
[58:37] not satisfied with Jesus Christ she
[58:41] started to fellowship there this is
[58:46] obvious with that you see but the glory
[58:50] of Jesus Christ makes us one one again
[58:56] and this is what I want you know for my
[59:01] life I want this so I mean so we know as
[59:08] you see if he knows the trick of the
[59:10] devil we are careful because it
[59:12] something can start very innocent and
[59:14] then it goes it goes by and by in the
[59:19] more and more in the wrong direction
[59:22] so how by hearing hearing his voice
[59:29] world promises ceases away we become
[59:36] partakers of his divine nature the noses
[59:40] intellectually Luther Martin Luther had
[59:45] an experience and I say this because ii
[59:49] said to show something what in Luther
[59:52] has an experience he gave lessons to
[59:55] monks concerning Psalms and scriptures
[59:59] and letters in the New Testament and so
[1:00:03] he should speak to them about the Roman
[1:00:09] letter to Roman's that Paul was writing
[1:00:13] and so he got so nervous and angry with
[1:00:18] God and he said we as sinners we are so
[1:00:23] condemned and living this condition how
[1:00:26] can we beat such and you want us to be
[1:00:31] right righteous as you are and he was
[1:00:34] anger against God and then the grace of
[1:00:38] God dropped down on him in the same way
[1:00:41] as the grace of God dropped down on him
[1:00:44] he the same grace can drop down on you
[1:00:47] and will drop down on you if you believe
[1:00:50] severe and if you obey the words very
[1:00:52] simple send all these things coming to
[1:00:55] pass
[1:00:56] so it's a grace drop down on him and he
[1:01:00] realized said it when he believes his
[1:01:04] sis God gives him his own righteousness
[1:01:08] and God's righteousness will work in him
[1:01:12] this ice became open and and he
[1:01:17] surrendered himself he started to
[1:01:19] believe his righteousness and it worked
[1:01:21] it worked in him he told his friends he
[1:01:25] said it was like paradise was opening
[1:01:29] for me it was and it is it is paradise
[1:01:33] is opening for you if you start to
[1:01:36] believe the promise if you start to set
[1:01:39] your receives the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:01:41] Ghost is for you if you started it is
[1:01:44] given to youth before the foundation of
[1:01:46] the earth is given and you start a
[1:01:49] praise him by face it will come down
[1:01:52] hallelujah whatever you ask it will
[1:01:55] happen unto you but you have to believe
[1:01:58] it since is a key hallelujah and Jesus
[1:02:03] gives the Peter to peel this is a key to

[1:05:14] quarters across you see for birth
[1:05:16] progress is it I have to just kept some
[1:05:20] skip something here it says there's a
[1:05:23] tremendous code you may be seated
[1:05:26] I hope I find it here in my inside
[1:05:29] different letters but but maybe I mean
[1:05:31] coming coming to it so let me see know
[1:05:38] if there was another one so so you
[1:05:44] become a partaker of course nature isn't
[1:05:48] that something for me this is this is
[1:05:53] gold hallelujah
[1:05:55] and if we are told if you make
[1:05:58] investment versus all things are
[1:06:02] possible in our life all six because
[1:06:06] this glory comes on us and controls us
[1:06:09] controls our family controls my mouse
[1:06:12] controls everything this wonderful you
[1:06:16] see people especially young people in
[1:06:18] this measure say say say give often up I
[1:06:20] say give up and say I cannot live it
[1:06:22] sure we can also not live it yeah yeah
[1:06:25] we are sinners saved by grace and make
[1:06:28] mistakes we cannot live but to have this
[1:06:31] insight that lifts it that lifts it and
[1:06:34] if you make a mistake
[1:06:35] quickly we say Lord Jesus I come again
[1:06:39] under your blood Here I am
[1:06:41] please Lord I talked about this problem
[1:06:44] forgive me Lord forgive me Lord I did
[1:06:47] sis here I I was angry say I didn't
[1:06:51] didn't behave in your glory Lord forgive
[1:06:54] me and then you grow that without
[1:06:57] repentance no growing without repentance
[1:07:00] no starting hallelujah this is the key
[1:07:03] this is the key
[1:07:06] hallelujah so God's nature because
[1:07:10] attributes are his glory being a savior
[1:07:16] salvation is a his glory comes down on
[1:07:19] your soul he saved me presence all these
[1:07:24] attributes he is my healer and is
[1:07:29] healing
[1:07:32] it's only evil our problem is we don't
[1:07:39] experiment enough in our personal life
[1:07:43] we think we go to church and send
[1:07:45] somehow we will get it somebody prays
[1:07:47] fast and ok and however we don't take it
[1:07:56] really sincere it should be so advanced
[1:08:00] so advanced there are there are promises
[1:08:05] laying before our before us said we have
[1:08:10] no idea in such a greatness but we have
[1:08:14] to start an experiment this is so and
[1:08:28] second Corinthians really give us a
[1:08:30] scripture but we always open face
[1:08:34] beholding as in a glass mirror the glory
[1:08:39] of the Lord in other words his glory is
[1:08:47] reflecting in us you go on your little
[1:08:49] chamber close the door and such a
[1:08:56] chamber in as Jesus said in Palestine
[1:09:01] doesn't have the window it is a it is a
[1:09:05] little chamber there's no window for for
[1:09:10] food to put food cellar to store foods
[1:09:14] here so it's a good example you go there
[1:09:17] no nothing from the outside you know you
[1:09:20] just be within your glory Lord I
[1:09:23] experiment this is for me your glory
[1:09:28] Father in heaven you made all this to do
[1:09:31] this I do this and it's tremendous
[1:09:36] it is so tremendous it changes me and I
[1:09:41] know some of my children that are doing
[1:09:43] this it changes us this is something
[1:09:50] real it's not something in the head you
[1:09:54] have to say we are changed into the same
[1:09:56] image in His image we are changed
[1:10:01] just let it let it down the channel here
[1:10:04] we are change if you say it for yourself
[1:10:09] I face Lord Jesus I am change this
[1:10:15] presence come down his glory come down
[1:10:17] save confirmation comes down that's the
[1:10:20] ceiling in this lamb like nature I want
[1:10:29] to speak something about it we have
[1:10:31] strangled it brother
[1:10:34] brother Branham spoke about this this
[1:10:38] glory we have killed when we were raised
[1:10:46] as children first lie so first stealing
[1:10:53] the first anger all this killed the lamb
[1:11:00] like nature it's not a literal damned
[1:11:03] brother Graham said but in his in his
[1:11:13] it's in your own heart see if you feel
[1:11:19] something
[1:11:20] tuck tingling at your heart that's what
[1:11:24] it is it's a attribute trying to declare
[1:11:28] itself if you feel I'm missing something
[1:11:34] in my life I believe so Lord Jesus I go
[1:11:37] to church right I need something
[1:11:42] this is stealing from the attribute and
[1:11:47] Heavenly Father he says take us now Lord
[1:11:50] let's a great Shepherd secretary deeming
[1:11:53] shepherds a great Shepherd who left
[1:11:55] glory
[1:11:56] listen knowing said some of the
[1:11:59] attributes was lost on them great
[1:12:02] valleys of sin where the wolves and the
[1:12:06] animals would soon divorce them devours
[1:12:10] him said little sheep but he left the
[1:12:13] golden corridors come down into the
[1:12:15] earth and was made one of us so he
[1:12:18] coulda clay as the love of God to us say
[1:12:21] he founds him some of same in them and
[1:12:24] denominations he found me there also
[1:12:28] some of them in a house of ill Fame some
[1:12:32] of same on the streets blind some of
[1:12:35] them in hedges and highway but he
[1:12:38] redeemed everyone that have father had
[1:12:41] ordained him Dorothy
[1:12:46] [Applause]
[1:12:49] so Jesus he loved sinners that's what
[1:12:54] the Pharisees hated on him say this had
[1:12:57] he had so much fellowship with his
[1:13:00] sinners that didn't even try to lift up
[1:13:03] their hand when they were praying said
[1:13:07] and and and felt condemned and the
[1:13:11] Pharisees in the back say look you see
[1:13:13] he doesn't even lift his hand so but he
[1:13:19] loves his kind of people and he still
[1:13:24] loves them he still loves us when we are
[1:13:28] falling he loves us so much
[1:13:33] and we are very stupid if we don't come
[1:13:36] to him when a child Falls it goes to
[1:13:38] mama or Papa if he's his clothes he
[1:13:43] knows he runs and and if we don't
[1:13:46] mistake we try to hide instead of
[1:13:50] quickly immediately like brother Bryan
[1:13:52] him he was used to do this he said I
[1:13:55] came in the plane and I was I got angry
[1:13:58] about child said always cried and got
[1:14:05] angry I said I thought Cannot some
[1:14:07] mother stops this child coming from
[1:14:09] India or somewhere and then he confesses
[1:14:13] to this church and said said if I go on
[1:14:17] like this I will lose a favour with God
[1:14:21] he said say little things if we do these
[1:14:25] little things in our families it will
[1:14:28] become heavenly confess it forgive me
[1:14:33] and say Calvary makes all the difference
[1:14:39] Sarris where we get the spark to our
[1:14:42] knowledge to the mechanic at Calvary I
[1:14:46] believe this I got my spark I did not
[1:14:49] know how to repent because I was raised
[1:14:51] as a child in a Christian home and
[1:14:54] didn't know really I prayed and believed
[1:14:57] you know many know my story and I had a
[1:15:01] problem I thought how can I get the
[1:15:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost because I met
[1:15:07] some people that had this experience and
[1:15:11] I saw this is real I also met some that
[1:15:14] was imitating but I met some that was
[1:15:16] real and I wondered said and hits a
[1:15:18] problem but I I said I don't want to be
[1:15:22] a hypocrite and kneel down and say I'm
[1:15:24] such a bad guy I didn't feel that I am
[1:15:26] bad guy raised up in a Christian home
[1:15:29] praying and believing the world and all
[1:15:31] this but never had a real experience
[1:15:34] with repentance and then I confessed it
[1:15:38] in a group of Christian businessmen and
[1:15:41] in some some of them some of some of
[1:15:44] these people
[1:15:45] Oh sis is not a problem I said no
[1:15:48] problem I will I would rather be a
[1:15:50] drunkard on the street and have a really
[1:15:53] experience with the Lord and I had one
[1:15:54] helpers he said she said no no no it's
[1:15:57] not a problem if you really want it you
[1:15:59] pray Heavenly Father give it to me and
[1:16:01] even give it to you
[1:16:02] this is sis's it's all Pentecost
[1:16:05] hallelujah and be pizzas because we
[1:16:08] wanted said my wife and myself and we
[1:16:12] met Calvary hallelujah we prayed and God
[1:16:17] opened up and if you need anything just
[1:16:20] pray don't they pray and believe and
[1:16:26] remember this don't just pray without
[1:16:30] thinking God said he's doing this what
[1:16:33] you pray we should not all our singing
[1:16:36] also in we are praying in our singing we
[1:16:38] shouldn't just not not sing like this
[1:16:41] and but know when you've been missing
[1:16:43] thank you Lord you are doing this you
[1:16:45] are doing this it will be fulfilled in
[1:16:47] my life it is a continuous fellowship
[1:16:50] with the Lord our life Alleluia
[1:16:53] forgive me that's my vein that's how I
[1:16:57] built predominately you can drive it
[1:17:03] down brother Conte also when it comes to
[1:17:06] tonight I believe he will drive it down
[1:17:08] hallelujah
[1:17:10] but this may be and it works also
[1:17:13] hallelujah god bless you richly
[1:17:16] hallelujah brother Brian continues and
[1:17:21] he said but he left see : corridors came
[1:17:24] down into the errors and was made one of
[1:17:26] us he was made one of us is not
[1:17:30] something left his glory to be one of us
[1:17:35] and he said even father glorify me again
[1:17:42] and a voice came I have done it and will
[1:17:46] do it and the people heard asunder
[1:17:50] hallelujah we know this came down into
[1:17:57] the earth and
[1:17:58] made one of us so he could declare the
[1:18:01] love of God to us there he found some
[1:18:06] summoned emanation I read it already
[1:18:08] summoned the elf ill-famed how some
[1:18:10] streets and he redeemed them all is that
[1:18:14] something his attributes got lost in the
[1:18:22] valleys of sin but he redeems em and
[1:18:30] yeah praise the Lord we know so much
[1:18:38] scripture and how much do we practice it
[1:18:43] in our personal life there's another
[1:18:45] scripture says I really came over it
[1:18:49] jesus said no man put his a piece of a
[1:18:52] new garment upon an old if otherwise
[1:18:56] sent bows in you make us a rent it rains
[1:18:59] and and the peace said was taken out of
[1:19:01] the new areas not with old so it is a
[1:19:08] problem in our life if you just take one
[1:19:12] piece one revelation and lean on that
[1:19:17] and then don't come to the fullness in
[1:19:22] our time this fullness is glory is
[1:19:26] promised us in this glory will bring the
[1:19:32] adoption perfection the fulfillment of
[1:19:37] everything in the rapture I believe in
[1:19:41] this glory it is Jesus Christ his glory
[1:19:45] and there's where the power lays I
[1:19:47] believe sure lays in the world sure all
[1:19:51] his glory lays in the world but there's
[1:19:54] two things you see you can say all we
[1:19:57] have taken from his fullness everything
[1:20:00] we have in us free everything is true
[1:20:04] but did we receive it
[1:20:08] did we take it in this is a question
[1:20:12] brother branham said Jesus is coming I
[1:20:16] hope I have it baby
[1:20:22] thank you but here I want to read the
[1:20:28] real music the code
[1:20:30] he says confess you wrong
[1:20:35] bear Spain's God helps us if we come
[1:20:43] before him and confess it it's so pond
[1:20:45] it's so important he says confess you're
[1:20:48] wrong there's pains it's hard to die but
[1:20:51] I right now tie come out of your own
[1:20:54] unbelief and the devil wants to keep us
[1:20:57] with little things that we don't confess
[1:20:59] in in our unbelief and we confess it
[1:21:03] said we have an experience agains as
[1:21:06] this glory comes down in our soul and we
[1:21:09] are growing by that we become men and
[1:21:11] women in in in this in this in this
[1:21:14] message in this life come out of this
[1:21:17] conditions this is the Word of God made
[1:21:18] manifest just as it was when Jesus came
[1:21:21] on earth it is Jesus Christ again among
[1:21:24] you proven it is good to come to church
[1:21:32] on to praise Him and worship but also
[1:21:35] it's good to go in in a corner sometimes
[1:21:39] and say Lord Jesus you are living in me
[1:21:43] make fellowship with sincereness it is a
[1:21:48] serious thing it's not just polished up
[1:21:52] just trained it's a serious thing in the
[1:21:58] heart Sir Paul has to do with our hearts
[1:22:01] we will speak from the heart and things
[1:22:05] will happen either just three standings
[1:22:07] here and the love of God will drop down
[1:22:09] and take all the evil and
[1:22:18] roses we cannot afford to not love and I
[1:22:27] mean really love one another if we have
[1:22:31] this glory in our hearts so it makes us
[1:22:35] always won unless they shed blood
[1:22:38] it makes us always won and if you hear
[1:22:42] this pray about it
[1:22:43] pray about it it could change it could
[1:22:46] it could come to a revival it can bring
[1:22:49] a revival and here there is one thing
[1:22:52] before I close I want to read this
[1:22:55] brother Branham said in the message
[1:22:58] birth pains 65 he said and Jesus is
[1:23:03] coming again this is our subject will he
[1:23:06] find face there's a son of man find face
[1:23:09] is our subject of this convention now I
[1:23:11] read this here and she says is coming
[1:23:13] again brother Branham said that's his
[1:23:16] spirit thank you lord
[1:23:20] now you can do an experience with Jesus
[1:23:23] coming this my way
[1:23:28] some may know the grieves I may have a
[1:23:29] better idea I don't know but I take it
[1:23:31] for myself say this is Paris he is so
[1:23:35] close to the earth so close to coming
[1:23:39] said he is ready to receive you if you
[1:23:44] are ready to receive him
[1:23:56] if Martin Luther would live in our day I
[1:24:00] believe he would experiment with his
[1:24:06] experience concerning a rat the
[1:24:09] righteousness of God and and all his
[1:24:13] great characteristics of God he had
[1:24:17] experience here
[1:24:18] he hadn't we said the time wasn't so it
[1:24:25] wasn't a season it must always be also
[1:24:28] in the right season for him so but if he
[1:24:31] would be in our season I believe he
[1:24:33] would experiment with his experience
[1:24:37] concerning the righteousness of God said
[1:24:40] open paradise for him he would
[1:24:43] experiment with this quote he is so
[1:24:47] close to the earth so close to coming
[1:24:50] said he is ready to receive you if you
[1:24:54] are ready if you are ready to receive
[1:24:57] him at least you should say now hard
[1:25:03] Lord Jesus comes home comes home sees
[1:25:08] the spirit and the bride say speaks the
[1:25:11] same thing say up turning in the hearts
[1:25:15] together in the spirit and the bride say
[1:25:20] the same things come Lord Jesus comes
[1:25:25] home and it is it is a way a personal
[1:25:29] way to receive him president sisters God
[1:25:34] has given as a key in this little
[1:25:37] afternoon meeting if he uses it will
[1:25:40] change our life she is just believed
[1:25:45] said take it in your heart
[1:25:49] receive it yes so it shall happen to me
[1:25:54] and then wait and adore him and praise
[1:25:59] and the glory of God will come down and
[1:26:02] seal it in your heart and there's a new
[1:26:05] life god bless you
[1:26:07] for a Mightiest service tonight this was
[1:26:10] just a little preparation all these
[1:26:12] things you find at Calvary anyhow let me
[1:26:17] here I have it that's good yeah we know
[1:26:24] this is a message speak to the rock
[1:26:28] brother : preached in Pretoria here
[1:26:33] brother Branham says the gospel came to
[1:26:37] us not in word only but through power we
[1:26:40] all agree demonstration of the holy
[1:26:42] spirit we heard it this morning would
[1:26:44] come and demonstrate the gospel bringing
[1:26:47] the world to a living reality that's
[1:26:50] that's our theme brother with bringing
[1:26:55] the word to a living reality and then he
[1:26:59] continues this is what we want living
[1:27:03] reality and he continues if your chest
[1:27:06] receives the word so it's a different
[1:27:09] ways of receiving me if he said if you
[1:27:14] receive him he is ready to receive you
[1:27:17] it's a different way of receiving we
[1:27:19] must we must catch this now he said if
[1:27:22] you just resist severe pain knowing the
[1:27:24] word set doesn't you any good this is
[1:27:30] what we learn in Sunday school and go
[1:27:32] through the process and send we go on
[1:27:34] church and grow up like this and this
[1:27:37] this is not doing any good to you say
[1:27:43] let Achilles Suspiria give his life said
[1:27:47] you must be born again and then the Holy
[1:27:50] Spirit quicken swear to you yeah I know
[1:27:54] I must be born again but how can it
[1:27:57] happen to me you must be worrying saying
[1:28:00] Holy Spirit quickens
[1:28:01] severe to you in other words like a
[1:28:05] grain of corn if it's laying in my hand
[1:28:08] it is just a grain of corn
[1:28:11] it will never be no see
[1:28:14] else and here it comes but very it says
[1:28:22] why we died with him it's across buried
[1:28:26] with him and resurrect lose him but it
[1:28:28] is a process and it kills you and it it
[1:28:32] has it has pains in it tremendous pains
[1:28:35] but bury it it comes listen it comes
[1:28:41] contaminated weather-related did you
[1:28:44] know this code yeah he said Perry is is
[1:28:49] corn this seed Perry it it comes
[1:28:54] contaminated you know we don't want to
[1:28:57] see it being contaminated Jesus Christ
[1:29:02] the seed of God got contaminated it's a
[1:29:04] cross this bit on him say that
[1:29:08] everything with him with his body with
[1:29:10] his soul is everything he could
[1:29:14] contaminate it and same thing with us we
[1:29:18] cannot go around this but bury it it
[1:29:20] becomes contaminated molds tell all
[1:29:24] around and sin it brings up another
[1:29:27] grain of corn just like it
[1:29:30] you see be speaking about seed and the
[1:29:33] real seed and we once said because in
[1:29:36] the real seed there is it has a power
[1:29:39] the power working so enormous see it's
[1:29:43] the word see it has it in it but it's
[1:29:48] not working in us if we just know it
[1:29:50] it's it doesn't help so we must dive is
[1:29:54] our lamb and it's painful you have to
[1:29:57] tell him since I'm so wrong you have to
[1:30:02] fear personal experience all that all
[1:30:05] the time I'm so wrong father but you
[1:30:09] forgiving you are so great you're so
[1:30:11] close your glory is so great and you get
[1:30:13] a baptism you you get another baptism
[1:30:17] another baptism in another ceiling is
[1:30:20] another feeling and we have to go
[1:30:23] through this process
