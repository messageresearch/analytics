want to read a scripture from Luke chapter 21 and I want to read from verse 24 to 28 Luke chap 21 want to read from verse 24- 28 if you find it you could stand have a few words to say to you this morning before the speaker come brother Anthony going to bless us this morning with the word and it'll be blessed but I want to read these scriptures here Luke 21 verse 24 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trotten down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled and there shall be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men Hearts filling them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and they shall see the son of man coming in cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption joet n may God bless his word you may be seated how many appreciate the service last Sunday now therefore give me this mountain and that was such a a stirring sermon to my soul to see that after years of fighting as a team as a group conventions preaching fighting against false teachings false preaching false interpretation and Revelation there's a transitioning from the group thing to the individual and I don't think that has struck the message world yet you see people have been pointed to church as if church is God the word is God but people have been safe behind churches pastors fivefold Ministry so soall this man of God of the hour this man of the hour and so on but the truth is there'll be two in the bed that's the word now amen one taken one left it didn't say there'll be two groups so you want to be in the right group you know you want to be in Christ am you want to be in the token you want to be if Trinidad gets split up in 16 pieces because of an earthquake and you and one of those pieces you still alive unto God hallelujah if you can't even go to church you are still Anchored In Christ Hallelujah because the heavens will be shaken and Men Hearts will be failing for fear for the things that are coming upon this earth oh Hallelujah okay here we go so this is Sunday morning and we are happy to be here [Applause] I am grateful to be here I am not barely here I wanted to be here even as that day approaching don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together because in this togetherness in this atmosphere the spirit could speak expressly things pertaining to the kingdom and things for now and in this atmosphere here you could get a word in due season hallelujah hallelujah not just any word but your word Oh Glory to God after 40 years in the wilderness 5 years of fighting Caleb was waiting for his word so when Joshua had to talk about dividing the land and Judah came forward Caleb saw his opportunity he didn't wait for a young man he didn't wait for somebody to go ahead of him he just stepped forward and said listen I want my family back I want my Mountain I want my health I want my strength I want my joy your R man are backl for so long but not after today no no no not after [Applause] today taking back my sunship taking back my godship taking back my inheritance because the lamb took the book that I could take back from the devil what he took from me oh give the Lord some Praises people look at me started inside of here oh Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah want to start a rebellion want to start a revolution a rebellion against unbelief a rebellion against system a rebellion against you have to go to the deacon know the elder or the pastor or the bishop forget about that the veil has been rented from the top to the bottom you have accessed rights to go into the holiest of the holies you have access rights to possess your Mountain you don't have to leave your sick body you could leave your whole you can leave your well you can leave your heal because Jesus Christ is the same yest today today and forever [Music] you may be seated we not looking for more teachers we had them for 40 years we not looking for more preachers we had that for 40 years we looking for power we're looking for Dynamics we're looking for the anointing to strike the church oh that's a promise that you have glory be seated you think Samson after his eyes dug out and he's a Grand Mill you think he want more postcards somebody reading how he sined how he fail how he fall from God it's 5 years it's 10 years how long Samson grinding at the Mill you think he want to hear more sad story how down he is and if he didn't have sin and if he didn't fall and if he didn't go with the lia and if he didn't cut the locks do you think Samson want to hear that after all them years it don't have time for that H what has is the past is the past forgetting the thing that I passed I press I press but I can't look back I have to look up because my Redemption drw at [Music] n Oh [Music] Glory my my heart is s s in the hour sred and and yet I'm scared not scared in terms of frighten but scared in terms of how uh people are so comfortable in their scenario that what B says if love don't get your desperate conditions will so I get to realize and I'm feeling now in my spirit that a a bunch of conditions is about to be loosed to get the people into a different mode into a desperate mode and I had a Thanksgiving Mir yesterday and I was read a strange scripture about Mary and Taxation and then when she bought her baby in swaddling cloth and so on but the emphasis I was bringing out is that pressure sometimes come to positionally place you where God want you to be up to Mary she never make it to to Bethlehem because she was Heavy with child but the pressure of Taxation having to go back into the City and so forth forc her to get there and because everybody was going there all the hotels were booked up so she came to the point where there was no room in the end and and today the hotels are booked up people minds and hearts are booked up booked up with interpretation booked up with idea booked up with your own feelings for you to go forward you have to shake off your own feelings you can't even go now with your feelings have to shake that off our weak I struggle and what you to shake all that off because weakness can't take it through struggling can't take you through that's why that's why the people Daniel said the people that know their God sh shall be strong and do great exploits God didn't cat off God didn't cater for weaky and struggling and no no that that was not he said even the third pull is for those that are struggling in faith those that can't must up the great fith God will give them words just to speak heal deliver free just just the word could you imagine you can't must up Faith they Brethren with faith they can frighten you with the faith and you don't have that kind of Faith he said that's what the third PA is about my God you just speaking Hallelujah I see my God devil get out that's all you can say hallelujah and the devil have to leave because God put the words in your mouth God put his thoughts in your heart Oh Glory to God you think I come here to say all these things have stuff here but there is something moving upon me the holy man of God move by the holy when you moved by God when you moved by the spirit oh when the spirit of the Lord come upon my heart you don't know what you're going to say this morning the preacher don't know what you're going to preach this morning Hal we want the glory of God to fill this house that the minister will not be able to minister we may have a 15 minute service today we don't know but one of these days that Glory that CH kind of Glory that one behind the veil that one that kept the man fresh to come upon your life oh Hallelujah come on oh my okay help me Jesus you may be seated from the angel of the Lord I know I read it before I said let bring it back again but BR the word of the little lamb that rose up in ran 13 probably a little horn civil and ecclesiastical power and after is LAM freedom of religion and so forth but after a while he spake like a beast like the Dragon and exercise here we go all the power that the dragon did before him a bitter religious persecution that is not skim milk that is what is upon us it's coming near you amen we are nearing that time you remember church this is in 1951 second of me you remember Church you are living in the best day that you ever live in right [Applause] now until Jesus come it will get rapidly get worse and worse prophecy when Russia goes down there to get that oil look out that is all she needs that's what the prophet said would do we are ready for it then so Church get ready to meet Christ not meet some Pastor not meet some man of the hour not meet some Bishop get ready to meet Christ amen 1965 29th of April brother manam is in California Los Angeles he's saying this is a solemn warning we don't know what time you don't know what time that this city one day is going to be laying out in the bottom of this ocean oh capernum said Jesus thou who has exalted in heaven will be brought down into hell for if the mighty Works have been done in Sodom and Gomorrah it would have been standing to this day and Sodom Gomorrah lays in the bottom of the Dead Sea and Capernaum is in the bottom of the Dead Sea D City who claims to be the city of the Angels which is Los Angeles who have EX exalted yourself in the heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of Fashions and things till even the foreign countries comeing to pick up our filth and send it away to your fine churches and steepers remember one day you'll be laying in the bottom of the sea your great Honeycombs under right now the wrath of God is belting under you how much longer will he hold this Sandbar hanging over that when that ocean out yonder a mile deep which sliding Plum back to the salt and see it will be worse than the last day of pompy repent Los Angeles repent the rest of you and turn to God the hour of his wrath is upon the Earth flee while there is time to flee coming to Christ so brother manam directly prophesied yes that those Angel is going to sink and that is the happened before the coming of the Lord amen and the bride will still be here yes sir to witness these things that are coming upon the Earth next prophecy you see back again in the shame this is in 1965 this is in July of course he said there's a prophecy that the ocean shall weep its way into the desert now this Sultan SE is a part of a desert part of California this Sultan SE is a man-made mistake that that produce the sea and S what they call the salt and sea it's a man-made thing but he said of course the salt and sea is about 200 ft below CA level and if that big churning and earth swallowing it like that with hundreds of square miles he said hundreds and hundreds of square miles sinking in the earth it will throw a tidal wave Plum into Arizona it sure word Mrs Simpson I think she's with us today I see brother Fred she went and got a prophecy I made in 1935 the time would come it's written in a book where the sea would weep its way into the desert look what will take place if that thousands of square miles fall into the lav of the earth and slide there there will be million die at one time Millions die at one time that will cause such a tidal wave uh Plumb into the sult and sea 200 ft lower than the sea level that water will probably come up almost almost a Tucson the water will come Plum up to the salt and sea Los Angeles is doomed for judgment I tell you it before it happened just reading for message called live you know woman is on increase in the nation and it's about three to five children born three of them are girls and the women are getting bigger the men are getting smaller women are taking over of course that's just the trend of the prophecy that this nation is a woman Nation it will be run by a woman and remember 1933 I saw that coming a vision a great powerful woman that will take over the whole nation someday before the end time before the total Annihilation then he spoke about the car the car in that day will be shaped like an egg running back in this form and this is interesting how it is phrased here and it will be controlled by some kind of power that they won't even have to use the steering wheel at times so even now the autonomous car that they have they could put it in automatic and it will drive for itself you just sitting there you don't have to use the steering wheel but they even more have it right now they're getting more and more with technology and so on and woman will take over and the doctrine of the Catholic Church which always would take over the Catholic Church the United States is almost here right now worship of a woman Mary which is contrary to the Bible now you remember I predicted 933 it will be way too I saw Vision before the end time a great powerful thing St up United States and become stubbles it's going to happen I said automobiles will be in the shape of an egg they'll be traveling on a road and they won't even have to guide it they can't hit against one another I've got a roote in 1933 I we know the cars now have all the sensors so it wouldn't bounce the next car and everything else it's already there it would break for itself and everything else we are at the end he said now when the woman being permitted to vote would help to elect the wrong person for this nation see what they have done oh praise God then the 10th version he said 1914 the world went to war d never been at peace since constantly swinging swinging swinging they're doing the very same thing what they're doing holding oh God have mercy holding that great thing that I saw in a vision when the whole thing become to destruction holding the atomic walls so it's coming every time man invent a weapon he has always used it be it gun be it slingshot be it bow and arrow whatever man made he used it amen they have Atomic they will use it has already been used and it will be used again isn't that right praise God do you believe that holding the wars that they don't destroy themselves until the thing come to destroy it until Israel returns back and get together then the message will go to Israel and she'll be sealed with the seed of the Holy Ghost the Gentiles is called out a people for his name's sakes and then Israel only receive a three and a half year month's message this is the news now this came on this week Putin orders all Russian children and relatives studying abroad to return to the motherland as he prepares for World War I the move comes after Moscow helped defense drills for 40 million citizens in apparent preparation for allout nuclear war Russia is ordering all of its officials to fly home any relatives living abroad amidst tensions over the prosp ECT

reported call to return to the motherland which comes after Putin suddenly cancelled a visit to France applies to all state employees workers were reportedly told to pull their children out of school immediately the top level orders applies to administrative staff Regional administrations I'll just skip a little bit Russian political analysist stanev B scy said this is all part of a package of measures to prepare Elites for some big war Russia recently had defense drills for 40 million citizens in apparent preparation for an allout nuclear war and earlier this month Putin Minister announced they had buil bunkers capable of housing Moscow 14 million people that's the capital of Russia Moscow now there's another but this was an interview with Putin all tells American vote Trump or face nuclear war America should vote Donald Trump as president next month or risk being dragged into a nuclear war according to a Russian Ultra nationalist Ally of President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Janoski a flamboyant veteran lawmaker known for his fiery rhetoric told routers in an interview that Trump was the only person able to deescalate dangerous tensions between Moscow and Washington by contrast Democratic rival Hillary Clinton could spark World War II said J who receed a top state award from Putin after his Pro liberal so on relations between Russia and United States can't get any worse and so forth last article I have here I'm almost done prepare for war puting is Russia to find bum shelters and gas mask Vladimir Putin has put Russia on a war footing warning citizens to check the availability of bumb shelters and gas mask ahead of potential conflict and so on oh praise the name of the Lord so God is so good amen and we thank God for sending us a prophet with a message to show us how to go amen hallelujah are you with me God sent a message to show us how to go Putin is not waiting he is preparing for war you supposed to be preparing for a [Applause] Rapture your preparation is for Dynamics your preparation for super Church a super race as we near The Headstone you your preparation for the sons of God to come forth to challenge the world system because nothing can move until these sons of God be sealed into the kingdom of God and brother bam said we are striving to enter into the kingdom of God before these plagues strike a lot of things will to be happening a lot of things will be taking place but you got to be ready once you are ready you are fine you are okay oh praise God I'm going to close praise God look at Moses God give instructions Pharaoh called death

appreciate that exaltation now we before well without further Ado we want to go to the word this morning thank you musicians amen God bless you on the internet praise God we like to turn to acts chap 1:8 we also want to read from from St John chapter 1 and we'll read from Romans 8 as well so you can find a marker for those but we's start with acts 18 praise God hallelujah amen amen Acts chapter 1 and verse 8 and it says but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth now turning over to St John 1 we want to read from verse 10 to 12 uh inclusively praise go so St John 1 see John 1:10 and it says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not this is St John 1 verse 11 now and he came unto his own and his own receive him not but as many as receive him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name and lastly you want to read from Romans 8 CH uh verse 11 praise God Romans [Music] 8 Romans 8 and: 11 says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the Flesh in other words we don't owe the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you live through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of this body then ye shall live in other words count the Deeds of this body as though it were dead yet ye shall live because we are debt does not to the flesh but to the spirit isn't that right verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage against fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God may God have blessing through his word let's just bow our heads and pray heavely father Lord we thank you for this time and season that we are standing in Lord Jesus Lord we know

amen but over the same we may not have this privilege all the time so while we have the time let's redeem the time praise God let's take back the time that the work took from you and your busyness took from you and your schedule took from you and let's praise God a little bit and get into the spirit a little bit because in the spirit God could speak to you this morning do you believe that my title is Dynamics to our mechanics and my subject is virtue power for service power to become Hallelujah that's what virtue is this morning morning glory to God hallelujah so let's let's start this morning amen so what are they were're living in all the things brother said about just before I came real stiring stuff talking about Russia and their position and America and where they at now and the earthquakes and all the wars and rumors of wars yet the end is not yet Jesus said don't look to these things as your sign these things are supposed to happen these things are going to be there but that is not our sign our sign is to preach the gospel throughout all the Earth and then the end shall come what is the gospel the gospel is not in word only but that gospel is in power and in demonstration of the Holy Spirit Allelujah it's called taking the word and manifesting it himself bringing it to pass himself isn't that right all the time the word laying there as a seed but in this season an anointing is about to strike the word in the pride and let it begin to take on life then you begin to live those virtues then out to come fate out to come virtue out to come knowledge out to come Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness it will be scripturally proven to be in your heart and when it is like in that condition down will come charity and seal the whole thing that's what we're looking for this morning we didn't come to church to warm a church bench or to occupy space air occupies space but the bride is here to make a mark and to let the world know what side we are standing on oh who's on the Lord's Side this morning I'm not afraid of the devil God is raising up a bride in this hour in this season who's not afraid of the enemy she does not fear what is coming upon the Earth great distress of Nations but that doesn't shake her the earthquake didn't shake the prophets the fire didn't shake the prophet the wind didn't shake the prophet but what attracted that Prophet Elijah was a still small voice speaking praise God hallelujah somebody say Amen What attracted that Prophet Elijah was a still Small Voice revealing Glory plans abiding kind of Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hal Vindicated voice word that's what's coming upon the bride in this hour do you believe it do you believe it do you believe it this morning somebody say [Applause] Amen oh Hallelujah so this is a time to be certain of God though the winds Willow contrary though the mountain Shake with the swelling thereof and know a thousand fall on your left side and 10,000 on your right we know this morning that we shall not be moved because we are standing upon God's promised word and whatsoever he spoke it was done not one word of God has ever failed throughout the ages and he's not about to fail now come on little woman come on little bride he will not fail us now though she's in the minority she'll be there at the final Trump praise God Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah on certain time America is very uncertain about Russia's next move Hallelujah isn't that right they don't know what to make of Putin they're trying to figure out if he's clinically insane praise God as far as they concern his madman actions they can't track his actions one day he up one day he down he's just like bipolar praise God some say it's a tactic of War some says this some says that Hallelujah but it take one mad man to push the button and that'll be the end of it isn't that right it's already prophesied to be and the devil right now this morning is very scared about our next move he cannot predict what we are about to do next Hallelujah because as far as he concerned there's nothing special about us we look like ordinary people living ordinary lives Hallelujah PR isn't that right glory to God Samson was just like that he look like a little fell but when the power of God come upon Samson he could move Kats he could move pillars he could beat a thousand Philistines he could do anything he wanted to do he could do great exploits he could run through a troop Hallelujah and when the power of God strikes you in this hour yes yes you with all your complaining you with all your faults you feel like you can't make it when the power of this church Rises oh somebody say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah brother sister I'm excited I'm excited about what God is going to do I'm excited what God is going to achieve in this bride he's been waiting a long time for this bride oh isn't that right Luther come Hallelujah with their part but they couldn't fulfill all of it Wesley come with their part they couldn't fulfill all of it Hallelujah isn't the Pentecostal and so on and so on but finally God's going to have a church God's going to have a people that he could work through and say here is my spirit flowing freely are you looking for that oh hallelujah hallelujah amen so what are we looking for what are we looking for this morning what are what is the church looking for we need power because we can't make it with what we got right now isn't that right we're looking for the Holy Ghost we're looking for Dynamics to our mechanics we need the power to make this word live isn't that right H and just just as Jesus left his disciples with a promise of power he said t and wait in Jerusalem in the upper room until I you be endued with power from on high I am going and the comforter is coming another spirit is going to come and lead you into all truth he is the spirit of truth hallelujah and they waited in the upper room for something to come upon them isn't that right because they knew by Revelation what they were waiting to receive and the bride this morning is poised and ready she is waiting for her Dynamics she is for her life the prophet said to come to her in her time and in her season oh can we say Amen this [Applause] morning so Malachi 4 message left us with a promise of Dynamics and we're here to preach these promises this morning and breath them over you this morning Halle because it's going to be Hallelujah the prophet's word cannot fail let me read something here first seal I believe over spoke this morning the comments he was saying amen and it just struck my heart Hallelujah and I felt led to bring it back to you this morning prise God do you love him amen and at the end of the Pentecostal age Prophet said we are supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me tonight to show you through here that we are see to receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there amen and reveal the the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church he said and there's coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that's not even written at all that's right he said and I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing fi Hallelujah do you believe it this morning he said because what we got right now Hallelujah we wouldn't be able to do it there's something we've got got to step farther he said we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly he said we've got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment and to be swept out of this Earth isn't that right Hallelujah the prophet said with his own words what you got right now you cannot make it in this condition there's got to be some Spirit some anointing to come upon the bride to commission her and anoint her for her time and for her season oh hallelujah hallelujah the spirit of adoption we have not received the spirit of bondage against a fear I am not afraid not in this hour that's not the spirit that was promised to me but what was promised to me was a spirit of adoption to lead the sons of God Into the Wilderness to be tested and to be tried and to be proven hallel to have those virtues in them then we be coming down from the mountain Hallelujah with power power from God power of God not no man giving you power in this season it is God placing his sons and his daughters in the adoption season oh somebody say Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah from ISAC message last Sunday he was saying how that God from this from adoption how that God had set some in the church through their labor pains oh they get tremendous sometimes oh Hallelujah hallah pain and my wife was describing to me what it was like and the whole experience and so on feel like your back want to split open excruciating you're not sure if you're going to make it days in and out isn't that right she was saying when the church groaning under the persecution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus the persecutions are there the trials are there the testings are there but what are we doing this morning we are Believing on the Lord Jesus cuz nobody else is going to take us out nobody else is going to take us through this morning the only way out is up not to the side not to the left hallelujah hallelujah all kind of forces pulling on the left and on the right but the bride has a promise something is going to take her up into Glory it will be those Dynamics oh Hallelujah to strike a mechanics oh hallelujah hallelujah it's coming in [Applause] now GL groaning under the P persecution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost he said how they grown and cry under their labor pains he said but when they are born and positionally born Hallelujah into the church so first you're born the Holy Spirit reing the Holy Ghost then you're bir in there then it drives You Into the Wilderness to face the demons to face the lust of the eyes to face the lust of the flesh to place a pride of life three wild attacks Hallelujah but the bride Will Conquer because it is written it is written and it is also written just as Jesus overcome by the word the bride will overcome by the word and until his word came the word of the Lord tried Joseph but Joseph is coming out of prison doesn't matter what happens doesn't matter who forgets her that pride is smitten and rejected but she will be glorified with her Lord when that time comes oh say Amen somebody oh hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church not an electoral college of bble parent ministers put it in the church no no no no but the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists then

we got we are not going to make it but With God all things are possible and if God could pour out his Spirit upon the alpha Church upon the early church then what about a bride what about our day there's coming an anointing this morning Hallelujah I know it for a fact the Prophet prophesied that that day would come oh and I'm looking for it I'm contending for it I'm looking for my portion in

separate you from the love that is in Christ Jesus he bought you at a price when the was whipping his back he screamed out but your name was being redeemed your name was going out name was called blood was splitting out that was you being Redeemed by the blood and after you've been redeemed by the blood now you're going to be Redeemed by power Redemption by power dynamics to your mechanics glory to God I feel religious hey hey it's coming down it's coming down from [Applause] heaven this is what we come for a Revival amen give him [Applause] praise oh wonderful you feel good the holy spirit is here you feel good this morning my it's good to Shake The Devils off huh amen it's for good to forget about the bill sometimes it's good to forget about the work sometimes one day there'll be no more job there'll be no more trial there be no more courts to pay there be no more mortgage no more car installments don't you look for that day aren't you longing for that day no more car installments you don't even need a car you think Philip needed a car to go to the European un ethiopan unic no understand it what read somewhere later in Antioch [Applause] [Music] hallelujah oh wonderful well we in the spirit all right let me read a quote here keep your M huming amen time mechanics okay in every age there had been some of it left off all right the reformer the messenger of that hour didn't have time to take care of it okay so in the days of Luther he only preached justification my faith then he was gone right then they made a church the prophet said but then after that Wesley he preached sanctification there it was and then Along Came the Pentecostal and so forth and keep repeating all right then he said but we're promised according to Revelation 10 and according to Malachi 4 and St Luke 22:17 and so forth all the scriptures that there's got to come an Ephesians to this there is promis it friends there must come an Ephesians that these Sevenfold Mysteries of the word of God must be unfold it and it's in the loudest age that this takes place and I believe that we we're there and I believe we're right in the shadows of the coming of the Son of God am and as Joshua just before the Ephesians raised up amen so the John the bapt Baptist raised up just before the next Ephesians he said and where promis another Ephesians it's predicted here in the scripture he said so therefore I think that we living in the Ephesians age again he says it by faith as present tense he said we are living in the Ephesians [Music] again and before you said it going to happen right in this leian age so what happens while the world is getting darker while the world is going more and more into the lisian spirit while second Timothy 3 is running through the churches and cutting out the uncircumcised the BR is being honed and shaped and sealed into an age of Promise which is another Ephesians which is the bride Age The Eternal Church age oh hallelujah hallelujah so while the world is getting darker we are getting more light and more light the prophet said if God reveal it try it see if it's right and he said if it's right send more of it and he said just keep moving just keep moving don't stop don't stop to build tents don't stop to build churches don't stop to build organizations he said just keep moving keep moving until every fell takes his place in the adoption [Applause] season that's right listen Kaleb turn up outside the promised land 45 years looking at his house that he going to live in he start to make recommendation to what curtain he going on by as far as kayb was concerned the land is his own you know we're just waiting on a time and season for the individual portion and inheritance to start to to be divided amen so that Caleb could State his claim amen you have to ask for what you want Hallelujah when you get into the land when you get in there put in your request this morning I am putting in my request Hallelujah I want my wife I want my daughter in that Land Of Promise put in your request I want my family my son my children oh Hallelujah put in your request this morning ask anything in my name and it shall be given oh Hallelujah they have not because they ask not ask for big things go above your expectation if you're custom asking for a, ask for more than that Hallelujah God is able to provide for your every need according to his riches in glory and the God who is rich in Mercy not only in material things but the God who is rich in Mercy but BR said when I look back and see where he brought me from I was a sinner uh but I was saved by his grace and the God who is rich in Mercy open his word to me and begin to read my inheritance from this border to this border to this border to this border to the land of the Hittites and the jebusites oh all of the Philistines all of those personal demons they are going to be overcome how Dynamic the mechanics oh say Amen [Applause] somebody amen oh my so he said there must come an Ephesians that the seven formes of God word of God must be unfolded and it's the loudest in Asia this takes place isn't that right he said so now we know therefore that Luther couldn't get to it Wesley and so forth the reformers KNX finny Calvin so on down so forth they didn't get it at all but what they had for that hour what they had was the Gospel truth but now in the last days we are given the understanding by the word that we are going to we are going to understand it and there's a promise in there now you're going to understand it because it will come an Ephesian age to it and we are here now he said now Paradox he said I'll leave that hang cuz I got to get 10 more minutes and so on amen amen but the prophet spoke it slipped it in there a promise another Ephesians isn't that right oh wonderful believer thou this amen another message Believers all this he said and our friends as it was on the day of Pentecost when our manner was poured out while they were all gathered in one place and in one Accord they wasn't arguing whether it was Methodist or Baptist or Lutheran huh there wasn't arguing what this church belonged to and that church belong to who their Pastor was no no no no that wasn't the argument he said they was in one place and they were in one Accord expecting God to keep his word it wasn't arguing whether the prophet say this or whether the prophet say that or whether he tried to say this here or he tried to say that there no no no no they wer debating they were just believing on his promised word for that hour oh they were in one mind they were in one Accord in one place and that's how you got to come to this church here you got to come with one single purpose single motive single objective to bring down a Capstone that's what you were raised up for hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to make a church that will make a Revival the people will come flying in to say the seven Thunders that is not even written is being made manifest that's what you come for that's what we're praying for that's what we're looking for all this while amen amen amen Dynamics attract the church okay all right uh let me get on he said now for in Luke 24:49 he said t in the city of Jerusalem until you are ined so t means to wait wait in a certain place in Jerusalem the Bible said he led him as far as to Bethany that was as far as he could carry them but he told them wait until the promise of my father come upon you wait in that C Place wait for that certain time something will come upon you don't go ahead and say you got it don't go ahead and say you in the fivefold and say it this and say it that no no no no wait until the promise of my father come upon you T in a certain place and we are waiting this morning in a certain place until we are endued with power from on high not from the on the side not from some brother somewhere but from on high acts one brother B says when the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you'll be witness of me not before [Applause] amen this word is so loaded we've read this before but it's coming our alive this morning because there's a promise that is to come upon you and that promise we believe is just as real as it was on the day of Pentecost hold on let me get on so the Holy Ghost will come upon you then you'll be Witnesses of me in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the world and 120 people yes had gathered together in the upper room waiting for their sustaining strength to take down among the people so there are people waiting for this revival to break out listen it had devout Jews in them days but they didn't what they were not privy to the ministry of Jesus Christ but they were waiting on a Ministry to prove what Christ had spoken in reality Cornelius was praying all the time long time he praying but he was waiting on 120 to step out with a witness of Jesus Christ for that hour your family is waiting this morning your loved one is waiting your husband is waiting your children is waiting they're waiting on a real witness after 50 years in this message Malachi for spoke a message but the people of that message are going to be manifest in this season I believe we are that people I believe this is that time oh Hallelujah your loved ones are waiting on your testimony say Amen somebody oh Hallelujah listen listen if have a man at the gate called Beautiful they still in the upper room praying and he there begging for arms he there long time he's supposed to be healed Peter is the one supposed to heal him but Peter have to get in position so that that man could get his healing that man is not there because this one sin and that one sin but he is in that condition because the glory of the Lord is to be made manifest and when Peter received the Holy Ghost the down come the angel say Peter go down now here he come by the gate go beautiful and he that man ask for the arms scriptures lying up he said I don't have silver I don't have gold but I've got something to give you I got it in the upper room here it is rise up and [Applause] walk oh my now what if Peter wasn't in his position what if Peter wasn't looking for the Holy Ghost what if Peter started printing out Jesus scriptures and say okay when you meet the man get to go beautiful give him a book and let me read this and let him feel some inspiration from it no no no no no God has no hands but your hands God have no feet but your feet Jesus ultimate mission was always to multiply himself that's what he told Adam in the beginning said multiply and replenish but Adam failed from that commission so God had to reproduce it again in the upper room so when he multiplied himself up there 3,000 Souls were safe then it multiplied then the devil got matter then when the G called Beautiful signs wonders Miracles the devil tried to close down the whole thing but it was too late because the word was already in the bride and the mind of Christ had already dropped down to show them what to do with the word be healed be delivered be sealed be set free receive the Holy Ghost here come your children and ience of [Applause] fire Christ directed service that's what we're looking for in this hour another Ephesians to this oh say Amen [Applause] somebody wow time is going all right all right oh you having fun this morning amen amen well that's where we come to let off the pressure it's in the house of the Lord come to let off the stress come to let off depression we come to depress depression with the word of God we come to oppress oppression with the word of God when oppression see you can't make it you say count it all joy with the fiery trial that he in his wisdom send my way he doesn't give me more than he could bear I reckon of the present suffering are not worthy to be compared oh you could praise God in your trial because you know who your father is you could praise God in your test I can't hear you I can't hear you this morning you could praise God right in the middle of your circumstance because re reation give you prevailing [Applause] power I know some of that ain't hit you yet because you looking at the depression you looking at the circumstance with your naturalized and saying that this thing cannot be but because Jesus knew that his father was eternal when they woke him up from the storm he knew that beyond that storm there was a sun shining somewhere so he tell his storm listen you're Roy in a long time now but take a little break peace be still I just want to see the sun again and because the storm obeyed the sounds of God he roll away that storm and the sun come out shining again this morning if you shall say to this mountain be moved I ask you speak to the storm this morning speak to the storm in your life but because beyond that storm there is the sun shining somewhere this morning that sun is always shining hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah isn't that right Amen brother Stephen job see the sun go down he see the Sun go up he said the plants go down the plants rise up again he said if a man die shall he live again he was Waring himself he was cutting the boils off his flesh he was in a condition he was thinking in a mess of his own flesh and his own mind and he was hating himself and he was cursing Hallelujah is not right and he was in a conflict he was in a mind battle and that's how some of us are sometimes when we get in the midst of our trial in the midst of our storm when the world begin to shake us like this and we have no safe place to go but the Bible said down come the Lord in a whirlwind and begin to speak something to Jo what did that worldwind say it said Job answer me as a man G up your loins pick up yourself pull up your pants buckle your belt answer me like a man where was thou get next to you shake yourself this morning shake off the tiredness shake off the slackness how long are you going to be slack concerning your promise wake up yourself this morning where was thou when I laid the foundation of the earth and the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted with joy get next to yourself the devil is nobody this morning the devil is nothing praise God when you see your Mountain before us when we see our enemies laying before us in the Red Sea how can we say hallelujah that there is no God if God before us who can be against us this [Music] morning oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] H GL GL Hallelujah you be you have to be concerned about what God promised to you Caleb was very concerned about it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's on his heart it was on his mind was on his system Hallelujah every day he wake up every night he go to bed he thinking about it it had people who saw miracles in the wilderness it that people who saw signs it are people who saw wonders and it didn't make it out they didn't make it in rather to that Ephesians land of promise but Caleb said now therefore give me my Mountain I want what God promised to [Applause] me so just because you see big signs and wonders doesn't mean or guaranteed your success in this Ephesians it had plenty people who see cancers fall off and tum must fall off in the prophet day where are they now where is the Fate because the word was not mixed with fate they couldn't go in but Caleb said I'm not counting on those other guys those are my brethren I love them but they didn't have enough Faith to reach up and grab a hold of their promise but I Hallelujah I'm not pegging on their testimony I cannot depend on anybody else's testimony I got to have my own testimony I want my portion that's how you got to beat in this hour you got to want your portion [Applause] it's the attitude that brings the results the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God the prophet said will bring it to pass and the prophet said if you meet those same conditions he said if the same conditions are met then God is obligated to to do the same thing he did when the conditions were met so if Cornelius was devout if Cornelius was prayed up if Cornelius was Sanctified waiting on the Lord Jesus if he was in that condition and he received the Holy Ghost that ESS is on you this morning to be prayed up to be Sanctified to be waiting on the Lord Jesus to do the right thing and for the sin oh my you could receive your anointing okay I broke off here and all of a sudden there came down a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were setting clothing tongues appeared upon them out in the streets he said oh let me tell you something right now and but is talking about Catholicism this just perfect here he said Virgin Mary and them was right among them that's right he said and if God wouldn't respect the holy Virgin Mary to get to heaven any other way besides receive the Holy Ghost he said woman what about you he said that's right he said you will have to pay the same price and get the same experience and have the same thing that they had back there at the beginning oh is that right so where you going out of the Holy Ghost in this season nowh that's why we've got to get it that's why it's got to bring us into a desperation to see what is required of us so that we could go after it with all our hearts amen I'm continuing he said for I tell you when the power of God Begin to Fall he said they lost all dignity and everything else all who want to iron their shirt Shar Shar and starch up the color was rolling on the ground screaming and receiving the Holy Ghost it had no time to keep your white dress white it's time to get something to get that token am you can't stay stiff and starchy in that environment no no no no when there's a desperation to receive the Holy Ghost Hallelujah listen the disciples were under persecution right Jesus missing from the tomb and the Roman centurions looking for this man Jesus some of them say they hide the body so the FBI knocking on the doors CIA knocking on the doors trying to find the this elect group there certain a bunch of people that was with him all this time and these people claimed to be Disciples of the Lord Jesus and they were in the upper room they was afraid but they was taring they were afraid but they were waiting but when the holy ghost trapped down no more fear no more fear Peter push up the doors and say this is that that was spoken by the toel the prophet he was staggering but he got something he was weeping he was crying but he got something and he told the people that this same promise you've got to get it too because this promises to you and to your children and to your children hallelujah oh hallelujah what a promise amen he said for I tell you the power of God Begin to Fall he said he lost all dignity everything else he said they were out on the streets staggering like drunk men he said they were filled with the Holy Ghost ghost Peter said this promis is unto you and to your children and to them that's far off he said brand said even Minneapolis Minnesota he said as far as many as the Lord Our God shall call he said brother I'm telling you he said every man that will pay that price and will step out for Christ has the right to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost isn't that right you make a step out by faith then God's going to make a step out on your behalf and back you up Hallelujah no wonder Joshua said Sun stand still Moon hang over aelon he knew that God was going to back him up because he was in God's [Applause] service oh amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen okay all right am man wonderful okay where was I he said not something makeup but original an original thing like in the beginning like they had on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah he said they're going to call me a Holy Roller anyhow so you might as well get used to it Hallelujah that's right amen oh the prophet was shouting here he amen he said let me tell you something more he said the Holy Ghost is a real product it's not a thought in your mind it's not some sense ation he said but it's a real genuine product he said you don't have to receive some duplicate or something he said but you wait until you get a taste of the original Mana that fell on the day of Pentecost oh it's not right but over it there is a place where the Mana is kept fresh that's sh kind of Glory oh Hallelujah that Vindicated voice word hallelujah he said yes sir there are was they there they receive the Holy Ghost oh that's right he said you know what's the matter with the church today he said it needs a good old time St Paul Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost taught in it again he said that's right takes Fire coming down from heaven oh hallelujah hallelujah do you believe it this morning all right let me read quot here and I'll quot a little bit he said a c syrop phenician woman or Greek actually she was he said when she said to her when Jesus said to her it is not meat for me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs she said that's true Lord but the dogs under the table see look at the attitude he said she said the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs Jesus said for this saying the daughters let the Devils left your daughter say good things then oh the prophet he break into something here I love this let me read this he said say good things then say something good about somebody talk about Jesus say something loyal something real he said that's the way to get rid of devils oh Hallelujah I made up in my mind a long time ago that waran has not solved anything will not solve anything never has solved anything never will solve anything Hallelujah but if you could say the right thing have the right attitude in the midst of your trial the Bible says say the right thing that's the way to get rid of devils oh what a weapon you're all depress you're all frustrated I can't pay the bills I can't do this but if you could say the right thing in the middle of that though he slay me yet I trust him a million Devils run away from you oh somebody say Amen oh Hallelujah the wife's acting up the husband's acting up the children's acting up say the right thing amen watch The Devil what the Bible say a kind answer turn away your ass oh Hallelujah that's right amen oh we're learning in the presence of God huh okay he said never he said never said he uh he never prayed for the girl he never said one thing about her being healed he just said for this saying for this say isn't that right he said hatti right the other day she didn't ask for nothing she was just sitting there but she said the right thing Hallelujah which please the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit spoke back and said hat you right ask anything you will whatever you got and you want he said find out what it whether it's real or not he said ask anything the prophet put in bracket uh they put in Brackets the healing of her little crippled sister there's a thing she could have asked for is that right setting there all draw up she had a crippled sister $10,000 to keep her from digging on them Hills over there the youth restored to her her well rown body and so forth could have asked for anything isn't that right he said whatever you ask you ask it right now Hallelujah he said uhh and you know the story she asked for her two boys and down come the Holy Spirit and gave her her request on the spot oh just because she said the right thing oh you could say the right thing this morning you could have the right attitude in this service you could have the right attitude right now and receive an anointing oh hallelujah hallelujah hallah say the right thing okay uh he said whatever you want to ask the prophet said you ask it right now he's talking to you now he said you ask it right now he said and if it don't come and give it to you right now he said then I'm a false prophet Hallelujah he said that's something isn't it he said Jesus said say to this mountain and you've heard uh about what what's been taking place he said and the ministry that we are entering into he said way up the road now soon the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ he said and we've got to have Rapture in faith in a church that will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go but don't worry he said it'll be there it'll be there he said and when the power of this church Rises he said it will bring its Brethren he said then the power of T tries it'll bring his Brethren he said then the power of T tries this church realize who they are that church realize they Church rise this church rise this church rise bringing the other Brethren the prophet said then there'll be a gener general Resurrection we're looking forward to it oh Hallelujah so there's no eight group there's no eight group that alone that going up in the Rapture by themselves and they alone have the anointing and they alone have the Holy Ghost no no no no but it'll be this little group here this little group here this little group here the prophet said rising up and taking their place in the Capstone amen hallelujah amen he said we're looking forward to it he said you know Mary and Joseph made that mistake one time he said they were good people he said they went up to Jerusalem at the feast and on they road back they missed Jesus among them so they sought him among their other among their people but he wasn't found he said and I think that's a whole lot today and they went trying to find where he was at he said do you know where they found him right where they left him that's right well that's where we'll find him Prophet said that's where the church will find him we won't find him in lectures come on now we won't find them in entertainers we won't find them in the way we dress that's a big one some people believe they long skirt will take them to Heaven Hallelujah Hall that's right he won't find a way we dress or the denomination we belong to comfortable in the churches and so on he said but we go back to the day of Pentecost where he came into the church amen and there is where we'll find him because that's where the early church left him at the ner counil and there is where he's been left ever since so it's we have to go back to that time to get him in other words go back to the original Hallelujah Landmark amen that was set by the first Fathers Hallelujah the the fathers at Pentecost isn't that right go back to that ancient Landmark isn't that right and pick up what they had that genuine Holy Ghost a promise [Music] am hallu friends I'm realizing more and more that there's no Escape in this you have to receive the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost as an individual anointing the Holy Ghost is pour out not in a group but upon individuals stepping out and claiming their portion claiming their inheritance every one blade of grass asking for their reain in their time and in their season and if you recognize your day and your message brother you should be praying without ceasing until every one of these virtues are living in you the prophet said oh Hallelujah not good enough just have virtue knowledge keep going in until you have the whole role then charity comes down amen pray without ceasing oh hallelujah hallelujah all right huh wonderful he said right where the left that's right okay there where we find him my so we have to go back and get him okay go back where we left him to where we can take this word and not add nothing to it not take anything from it just believe it the way it is isn't that right that's the way it was written and that's what it is God has watched over it to keep it this way and that's the standard we will be judged by by the word isn't that right amen amen let me read this excert here from the exposition of the seven Church ages loud eent church age he said now this messenger Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7 has got to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers Hallelujah isn't that right in other words we have to go back and pick up what they had at Pentecost the original dollar the original Holy Ghost the genuine anointing isn't that right upon the holy ghost back in the church the Bible said holy men spake as they will move by the Holy Ghost so we have seen the ministry of man all these years but sir this is a time where we would see Jesus we are looking for Jesus back in the church again to bring back some Apostles and some prophets some teachers Jesus was stepping the church hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right and live these things out that's what we're looking for am if we don't have that then where are we going what are we doing isn't that right two he will reveal the mysteries of the 700s in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals and he said it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers the prophet said exactly so amen okay back this quote he said now these Greeks were not looking for a lecturer certain Greeks came and came and asked for Jesus isn't that right in the scripture the prophet is bringing it out he said they didn't look for a lecturer on Jesus Christ no they wasn't looking for a Pulpit clown he as he said a moments ago they're not looking for that he said they're not looking for entertainers and what do we come for this morning we didn't come for entertainment we didn't come to put up our foot this is not a Jehovah Witness Hall we didn't come to lecture to you we didn't come to give you information about what Hallelujah what's going to take place and all this no no no no no we come for the Holy Ghost that's what we come for we come for a refilling of what they had back there in the upper room the anointing to come upon the word in US Dynamics or mechanics that's what we come here for we didn't come to sit and stare we didn't come to take up space no no no no but we believe the Holy Ghost is just as real just as real just as real oh healing is just as real Deliverance is just as real salvation is just as real the power is just as real as it was on the day of Pentecost the blood is just as real the anointing is just as real that angel that was with the prophet will be here one more time he said I'll ride this Trail one [Applause] more Hallelujah and the world will hear direct from God Amen oh Hallelujah give him a shout of praise hallah [Applause] H amen amen you love him okay hallelujah amen amen amen so let me try to strike my text here after this and that's it all right he said they're not looking for entertainers he said they want to see him the person Jesus Christ he said they long to see him oh do you long to see him this morning in the church oh to him to see him set in the church oh some groaning some looking for the Holy Ghost laboring under the labor pains graning to be placed to be positionally born into the kingdom of God oh H to put a mark upon those that sigh and upon those that cry for the Abomination that being done in the city all the sexual lust and demons that have polluted the Earth but God is getting ready to redeem the Earth by fire and he does the same thing to the individual you are going to redeem by fire oh fire got to come and burn the snake out of your heart burn the lust out of your heart burn the demons out of your heart out of your life and then God takes up his residence in there then it is no more I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me that's what I anthonio brand I'm looking for in this hour I will not rest until the Holy Ghost is in my soul H I'm looking for it I'm under expectation for it you have to be under expectation for your promised Dynamics and if love don't get us desperate conditions Will You Bet Your Life on it oh man Hallelujah my God amen amen okay amen amen uh oh do you love him this morning amen amen okay now he said uh they long to see him because they had heard of him and Faith cometh by hearing the word or aren't you glad you heard the word all these years he said and he is the word see he is the word and they wanted to see Jesus they long to see Jesus and we long to see Jesus Jesus said the world see me no more but you are going to see me that's a promise laying in the scripture hallah he will appear once more in his pride in the voice of the Archangel isn't that right he said they wanted to see him oh they never wanted to hear him they had already heard but they wanted to see that wasn't the question we want like to hear Jesus s he said no we want to see Jesus oh that's beautiful he said that's their purpose of inquiring it was to see him not to have him explain today with great intellectual messages he said we could explain it until you could see the picture but he said that isn't what we're looking for tonight he said we're looking for the mechanics he said we're looking for the Dynamics of it he said that's it he said so many say that's it we've got the mechanics of religions in the Bible so bottled up say until it looks like a great big 1635 coach train sitting out there on a track he said but if you haven't got any steam in it then he said it doesn't make sense it dicks the Dynamics to per form the mechanics and what we need now is to see that this that we've been taught all these years is it the truth or not it's been explained over and over and over to the churches and so forth but we are looking to see who this person is this person of the Holy Ghost this person of Dynamics he is a literal person the person of Jesus Christ isn't that right and he has characteristics he has a likeness he has a manner elect doesn't persecute elect Hallelujah no no no no the spirit of Christ believe it all things hope it all things endure all things you know when somebody has got the Holy Ghost you know when somebody has a genuine experience they begin to live a life that is worthy of the gospel and that's what we need in this church that's what we need in this world that's what we need on this island genuine Holy Ghost Believers that have the power to live something and this morning we are looking for Dynamics to strike our mechanics so that we could live something in this [Applause] scripture oh my said takes the Dynamics of perform the mechanics amen okay amen isn't that right Bible said he came unto his own his own receive him not but as many has receive him to them give he power to become the sons of God in other words a trans home and power come upon the seed that is in your soul to turn it into what it's supposed to be isn't that right L had mechanics and Dynamics they became the fullness of justification for their day Wesley sanctification and sword isn't that right so if we have received a seed of perfection then when that anointing comes what will it produce it has to produce a perfect Pride it cannot produce everything else it's got to produce whatever the seed is because the law in the SE seed is to bring forth whatever life is in that seed and we have not received conly Divine fables we have not preached to you men's ideas not men's thoughts but we have stayed on that word of God in season out of season the pure unadulterated word of God and when that word is mixed with faith and the anointing strikes that word it's going to bring to pass another Ephesians because another Ephesians is promised oh give God a shout of Praise hallelujah oh my oh my Hallelujah my brother Raymond from overseas from England sent me this quote here he said a gospel is not in word only but in power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost he said in other words it's the Holy Ghost taking the word of God and making it manifest see and otherwise he said the only way that the signs of of St Mark 16 can follow the believer is that the Holy Spirit himself has got to take the word of God and demonstrated it to the people oh not handing out a track about it not handing out a quote about it but this is that that was spoken of the prophet in those days I pour my spirit look it here in other words it have to come back to the Token on display God have to be manifested with you identified with you this is my son and I love him and I am manifesting myself in him present tense oh H isn't that right like a little while ago we was talking about that py tree isn't that right and my wife asked me the question what does a py tree look like and I said I don't know it looks like any other tree it look like a normal tree you would mistake it for another tree in the forest but let that tree begin to come into its season let that tree begin to come into its time then all the leaves begin to fall off then all the blossoms begin to come out then that tree begin to look a little different then that tree begin to stand out amidst the crowd amidst everybody else and you could see a poy Tree on a hill look another one there look another one there it's different from the others that's how the sons of God are going to be in this last day they are going to to be very different from the world look one here look one there look one there there's my spirit flowing freely glory amen hallelujah okay amen said the gospel not one only all right he said now holy spirit takes the word of God and demonstrated to the people that's it he said now Faith makes that word live see the word of God in the beginning was a word and the Word was with God and the Word was God uh he said and then Jesus said if you abide in me and my word in you ask what you will and it shall be done for you see that's staying with Christ in the word he said don't go right or left he said stay right with it see and then it's actually not your word he said but then it's his word and his word has the power and the authority behind it oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so when you take his word you are taking his power and his authority behind his own word hallelujah isn't that all the power Hallelujah is laying in this word here Hal when so when you claim a scripture Hallelujah he Health the heal I am the one that Health all thy diseases when you take that and you begin to anoint it to yourself watch the devil run from you watch that sickness run from you watch that disease run from you why because he was anointing the word promis to himself Abraham couldn't rely on his feelings Abraham couldn't rely on his Sensations Abraham had back trouble Abraham I'm arthritis but Abraham keep saying I'm going to have a son I'm going to have Isaac he keep anointing the promise to himself Hallelujah isn't that right job said though the skin worms destroy his part but yet in my flesh I shall seek God and even though Joseph was rejected until his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him tried him he knew what the dream meant but he had to wait until God fulfill his own promise and the bride has got to wait until those seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who could take the word who could really take that word and hand it there it'll slice and it'll cut because she'll have the mind of Christ to know what to do with his word oh give him a shout of [Applause] Praise oh Hallelujah I don't mean to keep here just about two more minutes and I'm finished amen amen okay hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right all right he said now God's provided a place of worship the prophet said I think that's what the matter with the church today he said we're lacking that dynamical power to press this word and make it live for this day m Mar Luther had the mechanics and dynamics of this his day John Wesley had them of his day Pentecostal had them with their day he said but what about our day he said this is another time he said the church should be fully grown now ready to meet Christ with a manifestation of every blessing that he promised in the Bible operating by that one great body where he promised he would meet the people and be worshiped in this great church of his in other words there's coming a time he told the woman at the well there's coming a time he said you don't know what you worship we know what we worship he said but the hour is coming when the Hallelujah when you Hallelujah will not worship not only at this Temple and so on he said but spirit and truth hallelujah de real worshippers are going to step out of the pages of this Bible and worship the father in spirit and in truth you will not only have truth but the spirit will be there bearing witness with the truth that you have stood for all these years the Dynamics to your mechanics the anointing striking you him moving in and out Hallelujah that's what we're looking for hallelujah amen amen he said what shall I do with Jesus called the Christ he said let me say something too he said this uniting time to see churches uniting Nations uniting he said it's a uniting time of God and his bride too is that right he said and I say this with reverence and respect oh hear the prophet approach he said I believe that the bride of Christ is called I love how he said that he is not speaking in the past tense as if it's something that will happen he is speaking it present tense he said I believe that the bride of Christ is called amen isn't that right he said I believe she is sealed in the kingdom of God oh hallelujah oh say Amen somebody that word is for me this morning it's not going to happen it's all already done in the mind of God he said I believe there seal in the kingdom of God he said I believe the mechanics is there he said and they're waiting for the Dynamics that will take her off the Earth and into Glory into the Rapture he said I believe it with all of my heart oh are you looking for it are you under expectation for it we need a Dynamics to this church this morning Hallelujah he said I believe it all my heart he said yes sir he said we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it because he is the Dynamics he said we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper another Ephesians what is it his love gifts handed to us before for the wedding supper isn't that right he said we're waiting watching for that their big church is to be United Hallelujah he said the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and that body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that he said even the dead even the dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago oh Luther is waiting on us Wesley is waiting on us the Pentecost is waiting on us irenius Martin Columba all these messengers of old who had mechanics and Dynamics in their day the Bible said they without us are not made perfect Hallelujah isn't that right it means therefore it's waiting on somebody to catch a reality to catch a burden for this message to catch a burden for what's required of each of our individual lives that we have to meet the mark that we have to be pressed towards the mark of the high calling if we want to make it out of here I don't know about you but I didn't come all this way just to skill time I didn't come all this way just to be a church member no no no no the Rapture is not for church members Rapture is not for those who want to just pay ties and go on no one day church will be over one day all this will be over you better have the token you better have the life you better have the anointing you better have the Holy ghost to show for this message oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah listen I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow but said Los Angeles could sing tomorrow in the morning Hal but if this is my last service I want to preach this Hallelujah and believe this because I know that this is what will take us into the Rapture and into Glory Hal it'll take his Dynamic power to strike our mechanics and to make this word live I can't do it on my own I can't do it in myself but With God all things are possible and what we see this morning should make a church that should make a Revival oh hallelujah hallelujah oh get desperate friends time is short get desperate friends time is finishing this world is all about over but I hear a sound of the abundance of rain something is about to happen something is about to break that this world is not yet ready for hallelujah oh don't be caught with your work undone musician can get ready to come I'm finished prise God oh hallelujah amen uh but then when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies thank you Lord the Dynamics is is the holy spirit amen no dispute okay amen all right let me read this last quote here and finish amen our educational system our denominational system has took the place of the Holy Spirit leading in the church he said our great fine training of ministers and things has taken the place of all night prayer meetings and the all time way we used to get to God now instead of having preachers we got lecturers man who knows the word just as well could sit there put it together in such away and it's astounding how they could do it they know the mechanics but that ain't the Dynamics he said we want the Dynamics he said I don't care about the mechanics he said I want to know the Dynamics what does it do oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right he said that's what we know he said God made the promise I'll sport my spirit Upon Our flesh Prophet talked about it he said it's like a fine car you have a car outside it tuned up it polished up all the Pistons and gear and everything and the muffler in the right place but if you can't turn the key it don't make no sense you just have a pretty car sitting down there and all they have now is pretty churches and nice people sitting there nice mechanics but no Dynamic power nothing to stir the bride up but the prophet said it would take those unknown Thunders to wake her up again the prophet said he will send it he promised it and I know it's going to happen oh because it's th sayth the Lord oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah few moment I'll finish he said I know that car runs out there he said it's got pistons and cylinders I know how much pressure it used you can play something softly the only thing I know is the Dynamics put her out there and drive it he said and that's what we know God made the promise he said I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh he said and your sons and daughters shall prophesy how is he going to do it I can't tell you but I just want to know that the Dynamics of God system he said that's the main thing oh and we're here to keep the main thing the main thing oh say Amen somebody he said today we studied the mechanics you can begin to stand he said until it's all mechanical but what good is an automobile without someone in it to drive it what good is the lights or the fixtures or whatever he said see we've got to have we got all the mechanics we've got school Educators could train man till he could stand in the pulpit and so on he said that don't bring the power of God he said where is the power of God that used to be in the church he said where is that Pentecostal blessing that used to flow through the churches he said that's the reason our world is falling apart because we've got away from the real principles of God and educated men into systems and things and that's what God Us in the condition we're today he said I believe that's the reason that our world is falling us apart he said like Israel back in her Promised Land she didn't know how she got back there but she just automatically got put back there why he said National Force put her in her place he said no I'm going to say something National Force put Israel in a Homeland National Force will put the church in a world Council of churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride oh do you believe it the world force is this way and the world forces is that way but God's force is upward the spirit of God which is the word of God my SP word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place cuz she'll recognize her position in the word and then she's in Christ it'll put her in her place n no National Force would do it but the National Force will drive his to the Homeland so forth and so on but the power of God will raise the bride into glory and out of it I'm finished this morning may the Lord bless you let's lift our hands give God a shout of Praise this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh yes Lord Jesus amen hallelujah oh thank the Glory Hallelujah oh am oh hallelujah hallelujah oh of Glory will Rive oh again oh hallelujah hallelujah send the power send the
