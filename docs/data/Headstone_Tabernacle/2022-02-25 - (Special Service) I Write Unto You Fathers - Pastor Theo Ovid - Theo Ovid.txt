lord tonight that your spirit will deliver lana totally and completely father new healer and free your father in the name of jesus lord this is the time for us to see a real move of god among your people among your children any other person's second body but a barrier's wife visit them in a special way father god and any other person not feeling well god may your holy spirit overshadow them may bless us tonight as we look to you father we look to your spirit we look to your guidance we look to your leaders father come and lead us with knowledge understanding about your wisdom granted father in jesus name i ask it god bless you things and welcome and what what um how things could change so rapidly right in front of very eyes as you all will all know about uh russia uh invading ukraine and um bible but obama was russia the king of the north and this is what kings do kings conquer kings gain territory russia uh is not a democracy it's what you call a dictatorship it's and um maybe i don't know what the lord will do when i'm unfold on sunday but the thing about it russia was raised up to judge america you know sometimes backwards feeling america's already judged just waiting for these sometimes to know russia was raised up to do that destroy america destroy iran russia is in the hands of god foreign and um we are here we are on the border of world war three we under the door of it you know uh our generation we were not fortunate to be that may not be the right word but we were not in the times of the forties and and when that world war one to the tree and world war two and all these different things like that face anything major in that kind of a way but here it is with all these bombs and nuclear weapons and so on and and i'll tell you this though that you can't say this is distant from us because nuclear power and all this destructive thing blend would affect the entire world so we are going to some treacherous time and you know i was thinking to myself if at this point in time uh the king of the north could make this move in the face of everybody hollering don't do it don't do it and you know he just went in and do what he has to do he's moved to do what he has to do what about the bride of jesus christ with all these promises that we have i believe there's a spirit the spirit itself to call upon our bride for the brighter maker move and i hope um that we would get help tonight from what what will be shared and that will be edified and striking we are living in treacherous time but ibrahim talked about lies being governed by these sinful men who has the ability to press this nuclear bomb sinful men i want to think about that a minute now these guys are christians no part of the world have christian men leading the country satan already told jesus all these kingdoms are mined that crew in trinidad america russia the whole bunch all these are mines all these little principalities powers demons territorial spirits i'm sitting on drones and influencing flesh and blood and um you know there was a king i think in the scriptures and that is the way god was speaking to that lucifer spirit behind that king where was dawn and how adult fallen and all a spirit behind a king so sometimes you look at people and you don't know what spirit is behind them what spirit is influencing them you know um i was talking to my son isaac i said but isaac said have you ever studied that scripture uh that the children eat the fathers eats our greeks and the children's teach is on edge and i find that is an astonishing scripture a finishing scripture in that you are seeing the effect of generations you've seen the effects of what fathers have done and the effect of future generations and i could see how god could tell a man abraham and thy seed shall only be blessed god has this law this principle and this principle cannot change this is law every fee been fought after is kind it is law and if we tap into god's law things will become different in all eyes to understand of a truth god can't change whenever his people mess up rebel against sin against you there's always some king of babylon to take them into captivity and when these people repent you're poorly thinking about it god is a disciplinarian he's correct his children every son that commit to god must be tested and tried and he god is our example as a father as husband we the church to personally bride the true example of life whether it be marriage whom family is gone and you hear me say it many times in the beginning was in church all these daughters church wars and foolishness that carry on with ministers and churches and ministries and stuff in the beginning i had none with church in the beginning it was a family i want you to remember that tonight a family that's what the gardener is all about a place prepared called eden a garden there and then god pleased his son because that is what father does a father peers a father will oversight and see everything is fine i believe in one the simon's uh from ghana i can't remember who it was preaching about the father will see that everything is fixed and right by the helps before his fun brings his pride in you know it's it's it's important tonight i want to speak about fathers uh last session we had we spoke about parenting a story i want to draw more in the parent and but not tonight um because fatherhood and and father is part of this direction to effective parenting and i um i know that men we as men have certain challenges and um there's no school of fathering there's no school of marriage there's the school of being a great husband great wife great mother great father there's no school nobody teaches on that but yet god is there to be our example so tonight if you have your bibles i hope it doesn't come across like a bible teaching but i will share what's on my heart tonight i'd like to turn to two scriptures tonight first john chapter 2 we want to read from 10 to 17 i think it's okay i think we use that scripture yes first john chapter 2 want to read verse 10 to 17 and the title of what i want to share tonight is taken from in this scripture text and it's i write unto you fathers i'm taking this the quote from paul first john chapter 2 reading from verse 10. he that loved his brother abided in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him but he that he hated his brother is in darkness and walk it in darkness and know it not whether he goes because darkness has blinded his eyes so hating someone hating your brother actually put you in darkness a blindness because forgiven and we still dear we haven't left there forgiving others and having that spirit of forgiveness it frees you and don't ever forget now we're not talking about freeing the other person who hurt you or lie about you or twistings concerning you and want to pull you down and make you look bad because that is evil of course there are people who have that kind of spirit they feel by trying to dismantle or break or shame or pull you down a day will get light that they will grow that they will bless them that they will try it doesn't work that way uh you don't grow blossom strife or shining light by trying to send somebody else into darkness or pulling somebody down and they control you grow shine light when you could pull somebody up so the bible clearly sees that this spirit of hatred hidden that person really is in darkness verse 12 i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake i write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one i write into your little children because you have known the father i've written unto you fathers because you have known him that's from the beginning i have written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of god abides in you and you have overcome the wicked love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world and he identified three main things the lust of the flesh one the lust of the eyes two and the pride of life three is not of the father but of the world and the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that do it the will of god abide it forever let us pray heavenly father read your word and lord is very broken up tonight but i pray your fitter together lord and may it come out right maybe interpret it right in the hearts and lives of your children i ask that you bless this session this special service we call it that will edify and help them sons and daughters mothers and fathers god husbands and wives young men young women father may help them because we live in a treacherous time we need your guidance we need your knowledge we need your understanding in jesus name we ask and help us father amen god bless you thanks again for being here i might run too quickly the amplified of that scripture whosoever loves his brother believes abides lives in the light and it is it is in or in him there is no occasion or stumbling or cause for error or sin but he who hates detest despises his brother in christ now this isn't this is brethren he's in darkness and walking living in the dark he is strained and does not perceive or know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes i am writing to you little children because of his namesake for his namesake your sins are forgiven pardon to his name i'm writing to your fathers because you have come to know recognize be aware and understand him who existed from the beginning i'm writing to you young man because you have been victorious over the wicked one i write to you boys lads because you have come to know recognized to be aware of the father so there are four classes here really the children the lads the young men and the fathers i write you fathers verse 14 this is amplified because you have come to know recognize or be conscious of and understand him who existed from the beginning i write to you young men because you are strong and vigorous in the word of god always abiding in you in your heart and you have been victorious over the wicked one do not love or cherish the world or the things that are in the world if anyone loves the world love for the father is not in him wow for all this in the world the lusts of the flesh craving for sensual gratification the lust of the eyes greedy longings of the mind and the pride of life assurance in one own resources or in the stability of eighty things these do not come from the father but are from the world itself and they will pass it away and disappears and with it the forbidden cravings the passionate desires the lust of it but he who does the will of god and carries out his purpose in his life abides and remains forever one of the difficulty with us males men we i don't know if it's pride or what that but many times we don't ask for help we don't seek help many times i see for my own self i see brothers men act arrogant act like they know it all and see them get what you call a bump head because that is what happens eventually when you don't know and not just don't know but don't understand and when i was in school i had problems with mathematics and there was this boy strange enough he's one of the guys that have never forgotten his name he had a mole on his face and he used to become out of his mouth but he was bright he could deal with mathematics and either ask him to help me and he said help me do it and help me do it and then i because i just wasn't getting the key to it and then i decided to go it over slowly because i wanted to do it for myself and when i crack it and i begin to understand it the formulas that has to be used and everything else then i actually got a love for mathematics and i went further to do additional mathematics i so love new mathematics but the joy was getting the key to it and this is what i see in life if you don't get the key it's hard to unlock the doors so many times a lot of things are caught than taught you catch it you see it and then you can have it sometime back i think we spoke a scripture i think it was in proverbs 24 we talk about what a house is built on and we identify the three things knowledge understanding and wisdom knowledge being the information part understanding being the comprehension part and wisdom to put it together effectively the highest one of course is wisdom that's how we're supposed to dwell in our house in our lives in our homes in operation with wisdom but it is very hard to be assigned a task and you don't know how to do this task it's very hard to be in a position and you don't even know what you're called to be in that position because life real life and fulfillment in life comes when you could catch a revelation of your purpose when you don't know what you are born for called for called to do you're just doing stuff you're doing things with no aim little mark jesus you could see that he was determined you could see he had a clear vision and he could say these words i must be about my father's business he was dedicated and devoted because he understood that he was called to do this thing do you understand what you are called to do and i see all of this as a backdrop of this thing called father what is father and just the title i write unto you and i was thinking how could i present this i know this is not detailed it might be more general but i still feel it needs to be spoken because there's no school of fathers and fatherhood and what a father supposed to be and what a father is supposed to be like and what happens when the father is not dear what happened when there's no father in the house what happens to the children what happens to their lives what happened to their focus what happened to their vision this is something else when you really think it through because a father is not someone who has children children is because you know you have a relationship and a child is born but a child being born or booted of a mother that receives seed from father is not that doesn't make the man a father let's call him for in our internal purpose tonight dad a dad but father is much more than just being you know that's my child because you have people who are have the office or have the title but don't have the function of father because father carries the weight of having a real function no sisters here you might say well what am i doing this meeting the night talking about men talking about father wait a minute hold it hold it hold it good don't do nothing you can just sign off no side not yet don't sign sides a man can be a father without a woman the only way he could be a father is to have a wife a woman or whatever it is that's how he becomes a father and i want you to see it a little deeper not just as father like husband but father that affects and infects generations because this is what is striking me more than ever not just oh that's what our father is supposed to be understand this that you males here tonight your picture of men or male or father has been influenced by your father or no father in other words what we live now is part of being influenced it affected our lives let me see if i could bring it down like this on saturday past we had a zoom memorial for my mother who passed away two years ago on on saturday that date and um i had a meeting with my family and told them i want to do this with an eye of posterity i want when the grandchildren get of age many of them wouldn't know her they could listen and cut something from what was shared about my mother and amazingly i hear my brothers all them almost saying the same thing so what was done was we asked them to make like a recording and we stitch it together and play it back in his room meeting himself and what was interesting is how they could say we never saw my mother and father fight they never saw my mother and father that have an argument and these are things i will tell my own children my own sons of what i saw one time my father got an accident and he broke his hand he put a steel in his hand and after that i had us to help him carry the basket to go to the market to buy market goods and as a child that is how i learn you know to check tomatoes and you know i enjoy making i don't know i still love going to the market i like to see the fresh goods and everything else pick and choose quality stuff and what i realize is that and one of my brothers he's 43 years my marriage next one i have so much years i mean i have so many years or 40 years and so like that and what i realized is that the influence of our parents had a profound effect on the meal men in our whole food let me say that again the influence of how we saw our mother and father how they operate now is 12 children okay it was tough it was not easy but the reality is this we saw something of value something that we cherished and i didn't know that they saw the same thing i would talk to it and talk about it but to hear my other brothers who i've never heard them speak about this is the first time i'm hearing their story and they saying almost the same thing it speaks volumes to me no my mother said you know those who marry are sons they get good men my brother was saying when he was 10 years old my mother called him in the kitchen to show him how to cook i want to teach him how to cook because she says she don't wanna know woman nick style on them and that's why you say all the boys could cook so this is just a digress into the whole thing so i told them i wasn't there for that part i wasn't there as i learned to cook after i resigned after i retired and i was so pleased when i could bring a whole lunch to my wife that i cook from start to finish i was very pleased with myself i wanted to do that it was in my heart and since then so she thought when i asked canada what to do with here oh you do it how are you doing i was just asking what i wasn't asking i was asking because i want to i want to get to do it myself but this is just beside me but i want to see this that our lives today are because of what has been influenced around us what pictures we hold what pictures we see and in going forward our children would be affected by what they see not by what we say so much but by how we live and and how we operate and so on like that so there's a challenge on tonight i write unto you fathers and because there is no book or manual on fatherhood it is good if we could have a talk or conversation uh very well but the classes tell me you know to be good if we have some interactive ones like this session like a session and i think that would be so great i'd want to have that sometime in the future where you could ask questions you could inquire and you know and it would be so helpful if we could share you know something like this and and so on and get questions get feedbacks and so on so i know i'll be kind of going off track but i will continue okay all right so i'll just get down now all right so i have here written here not because the father is in the house his father that he is actually doing the work of a father father is not a title it's a rule or function we have to know that we don't know all what we're supposed to know and as long as we open up ourselves for the right kind of knowledge the right kind of information we can get the help that we need and sometimes you say studying or reading or trying to get information it's kind of hard it's tough but we know for sure for a fact the cost of ignorance is very high it's better you seek knowledge it's better you seek after the knowledge that will benefit you and grow grow you i see so much destruction today and it could get you and that is why this day of information misinformation disinformation and everybody who have a phone is like a voice everybody who have a phone that could do facebook and whatsapp or whatever it is they like uh they like a missionary even if they can't talk they could forward something that somebody forward to them so they are forwarders and so on they don't have to be the original makers of it they could just be the forwarders of this is the age we're living in but you have to know how you are benefiting as a christian as a believer here's what i was thinking about paul how paul said i died dearly this is a christian i'm unfair with the holy ghost why does he have to die there you want to study that why a prophet messenger that the pillar of fire holy ghost filled have the same idea what i realized is that it's almost like some christians believe that when they give their heart to the lord get baptized in jesus name go to church problems solve every day where jesus is sweeter than they before sure but the reality is i'm beginning to understand more and more and that is why we are so much a twisted and challenged people in church that that believes and yet the lines are not as it's supposed to be now the reason i talk about sisters hold on those are not yet because we talk about male and men and fathers and so on is because a lot of men have been influenced if i could use the word negatively by their mothers i'm not talking about you here tonight i'm talking about i talking about love them to smother them mother's thinking is love but it's not really love they love to smother and they actually affect the men or male from becoming the man that is supposed to become because they choose to use their mommy power or mother power for manipulation and influence many times against the father i'm not talking like i read it in a book i'm talking because i'm aware of this as real and so real it's just scary because i often tell my wife i cannot understand the whole that i see some of these mothers have on their sons now i know mother and son have a good connection father and daughter have a great connection but i'm talking about it is said from a psychological standpoint the children of course because of that maternal thing stick to the mud in the beginning but they grew towards the father that is how it is that is how like nature have it the surrender they up under the mother and so on very nurturing and caring and so on but they actually grow towards the father so when a mother especially if she has um a conflict or issues with the that the husband and then the children becomes a weapon the children becomes a tool a tool of manipulation and when that is used the children get caught up in the crossfire of two adults that should know better or i could say could know better or could have learned to do better and then the result is confused children grow up becomes adults and these folks get married be a wife be it husband and then in their own relationship they find they have certain challenges challenges because of what was displayed or unfolded and then you get now a next generation of manipulators and there's a whole next section already i have to get in that some point in time only recently just two days ago i was talked to my wife about it about these kind of manipulating women and um it's almost evil almost and especially if your husband's a christian if your husband servant the lord and anything like that there should be no way the clearance should be uh the effect of the father is made unknown because of the mother i've seen it with my own eyes i've seen it and it is terrible it is terrible because that is not what god pleased in the beginning in the beginning god he created man in his own image and likeness spirit man he put a dust man we know and put that spirit man that dustman and that me was added and that body of dust is what god used to pull out this next man that he called woman as somebody say a man with a womb okay still man that's what god made original man and when you think about it when eve who god did not speak to spoke to adam according to leave a word so his adam is the one who told eve about the tree because that's what adam was called to do to give eve the word when eve took up that tree when she gave her husband everything folder and then you beg to wonder the bible never speaks about the sins of the mother or the sins of the mother it's sick so talk about the sins of the father we as fathers male men we will be held accountable let me see it again we as male men would be held accountable and that's the fact so stop blaming your wife stop blaming this one and that one you as a male right now when you look back and see what was absent in your life and how you could get the help now and how god wants to help you know because if anybody talk about father was jesus jesus was the father man i owe you that because my father my father work and i work and jesus is going on that broadway too it's not me that glorifying myself it's my father that this my father my father my father my father even to pray he said our father jesus was who i call an example seed son and that example son demonstrated that he truly reflected the father so in other words the real father-son connection how it's supposed to be is that the father the son supposed to be a genuine reflection of the father or give the lord some praise this is how it's supposed to be in this originality that the sun so so when when when when philip asked show us the father it almost appears as jesus was stunned because he said for so long oh how long i was you when you see me what he was seeing is the operation of the reflection of my father and then even my father are one so what was to be is that the sun represented the next generation glory hallelujah the next generation that would carry on this fatherhood thing i don't want you to see it as just father i want your seat as fatherhood god i want you to see seed of the righteous i want you to see how god is pushing down righteous seed especially when he notices a sip and seed that is multiplying and taking over the eat or give the lord some praises for that hallelujah so really and truly the devil's job is not really even at the romanian the devil's job is to see how we could chew down the man this meal man notice lucy for not stupid he didn't go to adam i don't go talk to you come come come come on talk to you yeah i'm under my dog that tree talking about that tree he's not sure enough he never didn't do that the devil knew better to approach that original seed son called adam so he approached it by product he approached a woman he approached a female and to the female he chewed on the meal that this day he's still using females to chew on who the male he's still using females to destroy family marriage wrecks and everything else to try to get the mail off track because if they may get off track the home get off track the family get off track and then the next generation that i want to get to gets off track how do we get that contract how do we get back in line how do we get back to get the course of where of where we supposed to be as male as men because right now you know with this gender benefiting they have in america and they bend in the gender and they're trying to say things that go they see and and and all kind of it's crazy it's just sodom and steroids but the point about it is this there's a crisis in men at the educational level at the job level qualification level is the crisis and if systems could catch and see the seriousness of this challenge that is before men and before us they could rewire their thinking as to how to give the correct support for the husbands and the correct support for fatherhood because you find people say don't touch me don't talk to my child because that is your child is that right some women believe that the child is their own alone i make it is that right you make it understand this says you were the incubator but the man carries the seed god designed that way that true male seed is released and that's why that that father becomes like the author hallelujah the author of a generation the author that is where it begins like i have we have a family uh whatsapp group called it your clan that's that's my tribe so and they have isaac idiom and andrew and their wives and everything else that's that's my tribe so when we want everybody to know something it's put there in the teal clan because it's not our next clan called the over clan that is at my level not my brothers and sisters that's another come out again so the thing of it is god and that is why god could say that um your seed thy seed will possess the gates of those that hate them because remember what we carries like four generations remember i've been here was resident and great great grandfather that is what we are taught you you follow him saying um he said levi peterson abram was four generations back but god saw that dear so you wasn't just ops because you have a grandfather he was even before that as a seed that god ordained to be on this earth at this point in time wow i hope this helping somebody tonight praise the lord so you know jesus it might look strange and and this is one of the examples that and this is where we have to admit where we need help i need help in my marriage i need help in my relationship i need help as a father i need help as a husband i need help i need help sometimes we need to identify what help we need you heard a blind man with jesus the man is blind and jesus asked the blind man what did you see by man what do you want me to do for you float my sight because sometimes you might see something that and think it is obvious but that doesn't mean that they want that so if the question is asked to you tonight what do you want me to do for you not me for you me jesus what would you tell him do you want a greater knowledge a greater understanding because if you don't understand what you read or understand what you hear it is you can't act on it you can't possess it you can't claim it because you don't understand it you need to understand it and when you understand it then other thing could open up to you if let's say it this way i'm talking to you to the father's you know this is a special point if in your father's home you are allowed to do whatever you want to do that's how the host grow this one do what they want i wonder what they want i wonder everybody at the freedom when your turn come and you get married the example that was around you your environment and example will be everybody do what you want when you have your children the tendency will be to do the same let them do what they want and you have a next generation and you let them do what they want and you see a bunch of slackers and characters and everything else because sometimes the child really crying out for discipline they try kind of a help they may be 17 18 19 20. and you because your father never disciplined you or corrected you or straightened you out you should be a big man you you you make a choice like i know there's some people glad when the children of age you have age you have age and that your age is not just telling you of age is you are saying you have age because you don't want to accept responsibility to discipline the guy to teach to lead and this is what father does i always do that which pleases my father jesus own words your father is there to correct protect provide guide teach read what we find out you find out men telling the children go to your mother let your mother deal with that men who supposed to take lead keep sending the children to their mother maybe that is why the mother have a such a grip over some of these sons and bind them to herself and then when the father looking together woody want to hear this one you listen to his mother and your mother awfully beaten back i don't mean to be offensive i'm not trying to king anybody but i'm trying to bring a point this is real so sometimes coming to church and you think everything is over and you see people in church get divorced people in the message they divorce and marriages break up and everything else right there and they claim to believe personal prophet and whatnot because it has things to do in applying with marriage with life with love it says it has certain principles that we have to keep that that to ensure that things not be broken and and these principles are universal come on god said love the lord okay i'll i'll get on into something this is one that blew my mind when i was reading it studying it this one blew my mind okay if you have your bibles i wanted to the first kings too i know another bible study but this one is so good and this is how our father talks to us first kings chapter 2 you want to read verse 1 to 4. this is father and his father is david he's talking to his son his son is solomon now david had his share of fears had a fear of drama had a share of life his son and we know through that relationship with bathsheba who was you know outside woman as we would say but god and work out stuff so he has this son called solomon listen to this ruth now the days of david drew 9 that he should die and he charged solomon his son's sin i go the way of all the earth be those strong therefore and show thyself a man now that is man talking that is father talking there guys and her father who backs them on his bed and he ain't worse than he said oh god cried this is david david is leaving these are his passing words he's talking to his son solomon the first thing he tells the man is show yourself a man dobby vampish don't be immature show yourself come on let's continue how you do that and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgment and his testimony as it is written in the law of moses that though mayors prosper in all the dodust and whatever so ever though to this thy self here's why here's why it was four that the lord may continue his word which he speak concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart with all their souls they shall not feel thee said he a man on the throne of israel so david is telling solomon solomon god spoke to me but you got to do something for him to continue this word he spoke i want you to walk in his ways to do his judgment and his laws and i love him and everything else that is father talking to sir now [Music] if you are not prepared to shepherd or father by example you can't talk like that you can't tell your son do as i say but not as i do you know you know some people say that don't do don't do what i do you know but do what i see you're saying the right thing but you're not doing the right thing therefore how could you expect it to come out right because what you see and what you do have to line up what you see and what you do have to come in harmony for it to be effective and i want you to be conscious of that i am not talking about just here i'm talking about what affects generations i'm seeing that that you'll get a broader picture a broader picture to see how these brethren how they refer to things so therefore you have to have and this is the scripture that we read last time proverbs 24 3-4 says true wisdom is a house builded and by understanding it is established and by knowledge shall the chain must be filled all precious and present riches so three things identify knowledge understanding and wisdom wisdom we identify is applied knowledge if you have the knowledge and you have the comprehension or the understanding of it you're still messed up you still don't because you don't understand you know become like making a cake you don't pelt an egg in a bowl and you spell some flour and you tell thing and you put and bake it no there's a process there's an understanding what taking place there's a knowledge so you go to a recipe book and you see you need two eggs beaten two pounds of flour you see some essence you need this you need butter you need to figure out whatever it is and then now you have the understanding to say the process be the eggs do this first mix put it in the mixer blend it on different things and then when you come to a certain stage you put in the prunes and put it in this that and you bake it any of them at a temperature of 350 degrees for 30 minutes at all complicated now if you don't have the knowledge and you do have the understanding and you don't get the formula right and you take it and bake it for five oh you get a toast you you get a cake you get something hard you know and rocky and you can't even digest that but the thing about it that is what the understanding is for that is what the comprehension is therefore and that is i trust god help us help us that we will understand that the next generation is dependent upon us and if we don't have fathers some of you may not have your father some of you you know never had that image when they had a picture we could draw pictures we could draw an image from christ we have other brothers or fathers that are examples that we could draw from and we could understand that it is dear because god is the father and that title uh you call our father and and and to think that god blessed us with the privilege of getting this title of father just like him just like him a title you know so father is there to teach but guess what you can't teach what you have not learned you cannot give what you do not have and it's very very very unfortunate that there are many brothers who have not grown as they could have grown they have not been wholly supposed to be not because they don't love the lord not because they don't believe they believe they love the lord they serve in the lord but they didn't really apply themselves to knowledge they didn't apply themselves their heart to wisdom they didn't apply this enough to the understanding of the role and function that they've been called into so you come like you get a job and you sit down there but i'm talking about that and you didn't didn't ask what am i here for what am i called to do you sit down you're waiting and you're saying nobody tell me nobody ain't nobody else anything then you will not get enough to say no what am i supposed to do here you want me to clean here you want to do this here you know what you're getting to find out you're seeking after him he's seeking his will that's why i said love not the world because that's gonna pass away but he that do it the will how do you get the will of god if you're not getting it through the word of god if you're not seeking god need knowledge of god to get the will of god because it's a will of god for your life it's not the will for your sister life or a better life because god stuff is customized for you the individual you cannot take your sister's operation or brother's operation and say that is what you're going to do too you cannot be lazy looking to loaf on somebody else's testimony you want your own testimony so you have to have your own burden to find out what god's will is for your life now proverbs 1 8 says my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother hear what the instructions do you as a father give instructions or do you let your sons do what they want to do your doctors do what they want to do okay and then afterwards somebody complain look what your son do look what you're doing to do look doesn't do one do i do but if you instruct them or do you wait for them to come in age 21 or 18 and say well yeah big man no go to your house listen to this genesis 18 17-19 this is god about to judge serum god about to bring destruction just like he come into america rome behold it god come down to abraham verse 17 of genesis 18 and the lord said shall i hear from abraham that thing which i do seeing that abraham surely shall surely become a great and mighty nation so god talking to abraham god is seeing generations down the road even a nation and all the nation of the earth shall be blessed in him hear why hear what god knew about him for i know him watch watch watch i know him hear what he will do that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he had spoken of him we'll give the lord some praise oh hallelujah praise god but god said i know him i know what this man will do hear what he will do he will command his children and his household after him that they shall keep the way of the lord have you commanded your children do you understand part of what this father role is that even when they reach 18 20 20 30 especially if they know in yours in your house if they want to do their own thing let them get your own house especially when they're under your roof do you instruct them do you command them do you teach them or is it that is somebody else's jaw and this is so important because where we feel you have others ready to pick up the task and that is why boys get into gangs because somebody playing the role that a father should have played somebody is teaching them somebody is invigorating them somebody is coaching them somebody's directing their lives and you said ma go to church and you feel like i prayed for him that he's not god god talk about ibrahim and abraham i know him he will pray for his children no that's not what god said he will command them he will teach them to come into the way of the law you know after my father died as i said sometime back because then i understood the cut tail that was called here the licks that i got was because he love when he cares for me when he wants to cut my ear and i clap on a tree and tap my eye coming down and i see when he when he say come down from there about it my father had something called a cooler and my brothers talk about the cooler was them the electric wire where you check it in middle part i used to rest it and tap the ledge and he's the one here three times and he said i wanted the first one the second one and after the third one and there's no more warning there's no more one it is really cooler he's equally cooler because that that when he finished with you he's a cool little at that time follow her money grown and when i think he went forward hit me so he put it into his leg and he pay him he had some skills but he was a genuine genuine father he i don't know much bibles he knew but his straight kids are spearly rather than spoiler child he wasn't spending a run spoiling on children he had 12 of them to see about and he had no time in a foolishness baby said the word shall put away foolishness is in the heart of the child but the russians put some of him yeah he gave who is just a weak almost so we'll be wise sons no this modern generation that i get psychological assistance to talk to each other they can't hit the child in school they can't disappoint the child it's horrible it's awful just to talk and talk and talk and talk and talk to america and i think cheering for the fourth parents and all right it is insane this world upside down this world is in a crazy place but but things have got come back to the reality the reality is this the bible could talk about the word because god is used it think about it now all joke aside every son that committed god gonna be chastised god will put the red and if he can't take the blondes you see like a bastard child not my child so the rudder correction even though it's not a great experience during it but afterwards you come out right you come out on a better side all because the word has been applied all right let me see if i could try to see okay so then i know him versus 90. that he will command his children and his whole soul afraid and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he had spoken of him and then i think this may be my final scripture and this is from genesis chapter 32 and we want to read from verse 7 to 11 chapter 3. then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed this is when jacob's going to meet his brother esau and he's afraid and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds the camels into two paths and said if eso come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape and jacob said now this is the verse i want to get to verse 9 and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac let me stop right there before we do that could our children say the god of my father this is the this is the cap of what i want to share tonight god has to be so real in our lives that our children could see the god of my father that is what you represent here tonight you in true fatherhood should represent god i think that's a very profound statement this is the core i want you to think god not asking of the woman god is not asking of your wife god is asking of you remember when moses saw the backpack of god he's on the back part of a man because not a woman god is a man the feminist will be crazy over here in something like this be the craziest have they don't know they want to make god a woman he's not a woman he's a man that is why male men are so important to god because of what they represent that is why pharaoh still say kill all males three years and under because men carry seats men carry generations men carry the seeds of the righteous and when you understand the rule and function of why you are where you are and how you are and your purpose it comes a different picture altogether so then you have to be aware and conscious of the effect of what you do and how you live and how it affects other generations because we are affected by what has gone on before and i tell you i was so surprised to hear my brother speak the thing i was speaking i never even know they had those same thoughts it's only because having to do it i was like the host of his own meeting and stuff i went to college and together i want to hear it it was quite an experience for me to listen to them having the same testimony of what they see or if somebody see their father beating their mother if somebody see violence in the home and they grow up under that atmosphere when that person get married what do you mean that person go to church and that's why when i talk about parenting a story because some mothers they are not real mothers material and motherly lord not because they don't want to be because they never experienced what that money love was towards them they themselves don't know what that is and because they don't know what that is they can't give it and that is why i can't condemn them there are some people very maternal very caring very hard to save boy and [Music] they have a lot of empathy they feel for others there's some people don't fear for nobody they don't think and care about anybody they care about things but not people they they they care they rub them or they hurt them or they oh but sometimes it has to do with what is back there let me just finish read this off and you're gonna wrap up and jacob said oh god of my father abraham god of my father isaac the lord which said unto me return unto thy country to thy kindred and i will deal well with thee i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth mr has shown unto thy servant for with my staff i pass over this jordan and now i am become too bad deliver me i pray from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him least he will come and smite me and the mother with the children this is a great experience because jacob was wealthy uh he had flocks and you know the whole works and here it is he's confessing his fears he's afraid of his brother he's able to identify his weakness can you he's able to recognize you know all this money but all these children with all these bands with all this reputation and recognition it's not working i need your intervention i cannot rely on my own strength god i don't have it and sometimes god break us down to that sometimes in ill health sometimes in tragedy sometimes in so different many ways that we could come to that spot of depending on him i hope tonight that something said here tonight would help you in some way as a mother ask yourself how you are dealing with your sons ask yourself what will be the next generation like the pictures that they have heard of seeing ask yourself if you could do better if you could do more if you could get the right pictures and you here who know that you don't have the right pictures ask yourself do you want the right picture you have to come to that spot to say you know what i need help and you have women are strong today stronger than they ever was before but this is also according to prophecy every billboard whether it is selling a battery or they're selling no water it's a woman they have most likes that is just where we are qualifications women studies women on going up up up just women that's just how it is we knew what his end time is like as it wasn't this or no shall be mislead and jesus was saying the same spirits that was at that time would be in this thing and as we say just as putin make his move to invade to take over the world shattered that but god doesn't run the democracy he runs the kingdom and in that kingdom the king is in charge we are citizens of a kingdom abraham was seeking a city of make and delivers god he's a ruling boss in that kingdom we have invasions we just conquer that kingdom we just take over in that kingdom the land of the hippies and occupied but we because of the dominion appointed that was released in genesis 126 let us make man then have a million god release that if they take the lamb so understand this putin is not a prime minister he's a king he's in capacity and god calls us to be kings and priests to read and to rule but we have to begin by ruling our own lives our own selves lust of the eyes lust of the flesh oh my lord oh all right so let's close jesus was the example of son constantly references father when you see me you see my father my father is a husband man i am the true man i believe that the highest level that god could give somebody is to reach to become a father i'm closer with these words boys are writing to you children i write unto young men i run to you little lads i write unto you young men i write into your fathers the object of maturity the object of god is to get from children blood to young men to family you can't go past that father is the ultimate fulfillment because that is the purpose that god brings up the meal for menfolk to become a father to become a platform to become an author to become a generational builder that's what god called us to be get back instead show yourself a man get back instead sisters and wives have to get back into them a lot of them are totally out of order let me repeat that there's no mistake no separation a lot of them totally out of order god did not make man for woman he made woman for man you have it wrong if you think it's otherwise jabber did wrong it's not scriptures god wants to get it right if the sister sees a role correctly she would be given the husband 100 support and not battling and fighting him because we as jesus bright so called we not using our name he said in my name you shall we use in jesus name so a wife who want to be independent of a husband or like somebody said this people need too actually dead back to back and somebody says the same coin just two sides i don't i just agree with that one on one side is that one side that they backed back they backed back and the two sides same point i'm the two supposed to become one it's supposed to be a different thing altogether but god help us this is the first of i believe some deeper stuff that i'd like to share but tonight i decided to just say i write unto you fathers just give the father notice that more letters come in god bless you brothers sisters who here know let's bow our heads is going to pray heavenly father i thank you tonight for these precious people that are listening and god i thank you for this open door that gave us the opportunity to share stuff that we would not preach behind a puppet we wouldn't preach as a sermon but we could talk we could share we could fellowship we could share our own experience give our own testimonies god god i love fatherhood i love seeing men raised and boys become nervous it's a joy for me to see that and i would love to help when i can and father i pray that somehow in all these broken up pieces and broken up words that you would help not just the brothers but the sisters not just the husbands but the wives that they will be interested in find out their real role what they are called to do not put their feelings aside and their emotions aside and say god what could i do for this kingdom how could i be a better fulfill your purpose oh god and to see how jacob could say the god of my father abraham the god of my father isaac they knew god operated with abraham in abraham they knew god operated with isa they saw they heard it has a historical reference point of the history of their own lineage and experiences with god and they could refer the god of their fathers because things are so terrible people don't even want to hear about the father some of them some of them may never know their father they don't know the father disappeared the father gone a long time ago leaves them on their own and this is what the devil wanted lies without protection lies without direction lies without guidance and instruction you said i know abraham i know he would command his children to follow the way of the lord father such a beautiful testimony may it be so with his father here tonight if they have not done so if they have not take take it upon themselves to teach to show to god the children might look old bigger adults but lord as we get older we still need guidance we are being guided even here tonight bless them in a special way i commit their lives into their hands i this with some sound into your hearts your jesus in my ask it amen god bless you and thanks again for being here i certainly appreciate your attention and she says i'm so glad that again checking out and walk out and and just exit and leave but i trust you that you would understand that because your hand rocks the creeper cradle the son that you may have the baby that you may have child around your heart you don't know he could be a prophet a priest the king whatever but he is in your heart god be with you thanks again for being here tonight god bless you god bless you
