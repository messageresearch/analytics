[7:53] Prius goes to get the beer tonight he
[7:56] meant god bless you if of your Bibles
[7:58] are ligated into Romans chapter 7
[8:00] second Corinthians chapter 3 and then we
[8:04] go to Romans chapter 12 verse 50 reading
[8:06] tonight Romans chapter 7 billion from
[8:15] verse 1 to 6 know ye not brethren for
[8:19] fun so long as he liveth but if the
[8:23] husband be dead she is loosed from the
[8:25] law of a husband so then if while her
[8:28] husband liveth she be married to another
[8:30] man she shall be called an adulteress
[8:33] but if a husband be dead
[8:35] she's free from the law that law so
[8:38] she's no adulteress though she be
[8:41] married to another man
[8:42] wherefore my brethren ye also have
[8:45] become dead to the law by the body of
[8:48] Christ
[8:49] that you should be married to another
[8:51] even to him who is raised from the dead
[8:54] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[8:57] God for when we were in the flesh the
[9:00] motions of sins which were by the Lord
[9:02] did work in our members to bring forth
[9:05] fruit on the debt but now we had a liver
[9:09] from the law that being dead where we
[9:11] were held that we should serve in the
[9:14] newness of spirit are not in the allness
[9:18] of the letter and reading from 2nd
[9:23] Corinthians chapter 3 do we begin to
[9:26] commend ourselves or need we are some
[9:29] others epistles of commendation to you
[9:31] letters of combination from you
[9:33] Yahoo pistol written in our hearts known
[9:36] and read from you from all men of all
[9:39] men for as much as ye are manifestly
[9:41] declared to be a pistol of Christ
[9:44] ministered by US written not with ink
[9:46] but with the spirit of the Living God
[9:49] not in tables of stone but in fleshy
[9:52] tables of the
[9:53] heart okay let's continue and such
[10:01] trusts have we true Christ to God would
[10:03] not that we are sufficient ourselves to
[10:05] think anything of ourselves but our
[10:07] sufficiency is of God who what meet us
[10:09] evil ministers of the New Testament not
[10:12] of the letter but of the spirit for the
[10:15] letter killeth but the spirit to give it
[10:17] life and I'll ask of you from Romans
[10:20] chapter 12 I beseech you therefore
[10:22] brethren by the mercies of God that you
[10:24] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[10:25] holy acceptable to God which is your
[10:29] reasonable service and be not conformed
[10:32] to this world but be transformed by the
[10:35] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[10:38] that what is that what is that good and
[10:41] acceptable and perfect will of God s
[10:43] ballheads
[10:44] father we thank you for your word
[10:45] tonight you come and interpreted to our
[10:47] hearts and speak Lord to us know that
[10:50] our lives will be changed and the image
[10:53] and likeness granted father in Jesus
[10:55] name I ask it amen
[10:56] you may be seated or praise the Lord
[11:02] tonight
[11:03] our type of God's power to transform his
[11:06] seed to produce his kind god's power to
[11:10] transform his seed to produce his kind
[11:13] of a conduct scripture from Genesis 1 it
[11:16] says in the beginning God created heaven
[11:17] in the earth it was a tall form and void
[11:19] and darkness was upon the face of the
[11:21] deep and the Spirit of God move up on
[11:24] the face of the waters and God said let
[11:26] there be light and it was light and God
[11:27] saw the light that it was good and God
[11:30] devises a light from the darkness and
[11:33] God called the light D the darkness he
[11:35] called night and the evening and the
[11:37] morning were the first day
[11:38] and God said let there be a firmament in
[11:40] the midst of the waters and let it
[11:43] divide the waters from the waters and
[11:44] God made the firmament and divided the
[11:46] waters which were under the firmament
[11:48] from the waters which were above the
[11:50] firmament and it was so and God called
[11:52] the firmament heaven and the evening and
[11:54] the morning were the second day
[11:55] and God said let the waters under the
[11:57] heaven be gathered together in one place
[11:59] and let the dry land appear and it was
[12:01] so and God called a dry line
[12:04] the garden together of the waters called
[12:06] he seas and God saw it was good and God
[12:09] said let the earth bring forth grass the
[12:12] herb yielding seed after his kind and
[12:16] the tree even fruit whose seed was in
[12:19] itself after his kind and God saw it was
[12:22] good so if I know from Genesis 1:26
[12:27] every seek on the bring forth after its
[12:29] kind and but abandonment is invisible in
[12:32] the brightest printed prayer you see Oh
[12:34] God
[12:35] knowing seen how fragile we are knowing
[12:40] that we are walking on the brittle
[12:42] treads of life of this mortal life not
[12:46] knowing what time that we're going to be
[12:49] someone's to answer on hi
[12:51] let us O Lord lay aside everything in
[12:54] our heart everything in our mind and
[12:57] look straight to your word tonight for
[13:00] you to come and interpret it but live in
[13:03] Oracle's grant it may your spirit fall
[13:07] upon us and anoint the wood or heart
[13:09] that we might go from here this evening
[13:11] better people that we are now but we
[13:14] might have a closer insight on Jesus
[13:16] Christ granted Lord that we might
[13:19] understand the day we are living and the
[13:22] preparation of God for this hour for his
[13:25] people miss our this great crucial dark
[13:28] time that we're now living in God anoint
[13:31] us not only speaker but here and
[13:33] together make our hearts to tremble at
[13:38] your word for the fear of God is the
[13:42] beginning of wisdom grab these things
[13:44] father we ask in Jesus name Amen oh
[13:46] praise the name of the Lord what a
[13:49] prayer oh praise the name of the Lord
[13:53] are you ready for the word tonight so we
[13:56] know we find out that Elohim he-men came
[13:59] down and spoke to Abraham when Sarah
[14:01] died wife and this focal region C Brown
[14:03] says and he said I'm going to visit you
[14:05] I'm going to visit you according to the
[14:08] time of life and you're gonna have that
[14:11] baby that you're waiting on and hear the
[14:14] prophecy the Lateran is fixin to fall
[14:16] you have held that seed in there long
[14:20] enough believe in but you are looking
[14:22] for coming son and he is coming so right
[14:26] now tonight you're under prophecy of the
[14:28] Lateran fixin to fall so that's that's
[14:31] the seer the Lord nobody could change
[14:34] that nobody could say that not going to
[14:36] happen so the rain is not the problem or
[14:39] glory
[14:47] you
[15:07] Ramos was given it and invisibly only
[15:09] bride paul was given illustration about
[15:11] margin divorce it pertains the greater
[15:14] portion of margin divorce and hold that
[15:16] he's trying to set in order the church
[15:18] can no more be married to the world and
[15:20] the Kranks at the same time and be legal
[15:22] and lawful about it
[15:24] then it can be a woman to be living with
[15:25] a husband while she has a live-in
[15:27] husband no he said I believe is to my
[15:30] belief that it unfolds one of the great
[15:33] mysteries of prophecy no a woman is
[15:36] always tied to church because the church
[15:38] is considered a bride she's the bride
[15:40] for the Lord g-god so Gordon looking for
[15:43] their hearts that want to line up at
[15:44] this world because the world is the
[15:46] conduct of the Spirit
