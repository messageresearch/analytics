[12:06] Thank you so much, brother Anthony. God
[12:08] bless you, church. It's certainly a
[12:11] great privilege to be here tonight. Uh,
[12:15] one more time, can we just bow our heads
[12:18] for a word of prayer? Our gracious
[12:20] heavenly father, we thank you tonight
[12:22] that we could gather as a body of
[12:25] believers, as a church, Lord, on this
[12:27] Friday evening, Lord. There are so many
[12:30] things that we could be doing, so many
[12:33] ways to spend our time, Lord. But father
[12:37] you have chosen and seen it fit that we
[12:40] could come together Lord in this way
[12:42] around your word Lord per adventure a
[12:46] word be spoken tonight that would touch
[12:48] the hearts of your people Lord just one
[12:51] word from you tonight makes all the
[12:53] difference Lord we pray for the church
[12:56] we pray for the body of believers we
[12:58] pray for those that are already here
[13:00] those that would join us during the
[13:02] course of this Bible study tonight Lord
[13:04] those that would listen to the recording
[13:06] We pray for Lord the needs of the people
[13:10] Lord many needs Lord for Lord physical
[13:13] healing Lord how the enemy has attacked
[13:16] Lord but we have a right as a church of
[13:18] the living God to push back against
[13:20] every sickness every disease every
[13:23] affliction by the power that was in you
[13:26] that you poured into Christ and that has
[13:28] been poured into the church we stand
[13:30] Lord on the confidence of faith Lord
[13:32] knowing that you are the same yesterday
[13:34] today and forever. So, Father, may you
[13:37] touch your people. May you strengthen
[13:38] your people. And for the moments that we
[13:40] spend here tonight, Lord, may you take
[13:42] me out of the way. And may your Lord,
[13:44] you speak directly to your children, to
[13:46] your people. Lord, may you touch lives
[13:47] and hearts. And may we see something in
[13:49] the word, Lord, that maybe we have not
[13:51] seen it quite that way before, Lord.
[13:53] That we could relook, Lord, from the
[13:55] word at our own lives, Lord, and make
[13:57] the right decisions, Lord. Because,
[13:59] Father, there's a choice to be made
[14:01] tonight. There's a choice to be made
[14:02] tomorrow. There's a choice to be made
[14:04] every single day. So help us Lord
[14:06] through the guidance of your word being
[14:08] led by the spirit to make the right
[14:10] choices. Father may you bless us. We
[14:11] commit the session into your hands in
[14:13] the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[14:15] And amen and amen. Well, God bless you
[14:18] church. It's certainly a great privilege
[14:20] to be here uh on this Friday evening on
[14:23] this 22nd day of August. Certainly a
[14:26] great privilege to uh have a Bible study
[14:29] one more time and to see um that you are
[14:33] at your post of duty. Um we haven't had
[14:36] one of these Bible studies in a while,
[14:37] but by the grace of God, we are here um
[14:40] to put our shoulders to the wheel uh to
[14:42] do all that we could do, redeeming the
[14:45] time, knowing that time is short. And
[14:48] for the moment that we have that we
[14:49] could be drawn closer to the Lord and
[14:51] closer to each other, we want to do as
[14:53] much as we can. I invite you tonight to
[14:57] get into the spirit of the Bible study.
[15:00] I encourage you to not take uh this
[15:03] lightly or any service for that matter
[15:05] lightly that you pay very close
[15:07] attention. I don't intend to be too long
[15:10] with you tonight. Um, but I do believe
[15:13] that if we focus and we take out of this
[15:19] what God wants us to hear that we could
[15:22] be edified and strengthened in the inner
[15:24] man. Uh, you know, because the race is
[15:27] not for the swift, but we're dealing
[15:29] with the ability to endure until the
[15:31] end. So, uh, certainly good to be back
[15:33] home as well. Um, I had the privilege
[15:36] last weekend of being in France uh, for
[15:39] the youth meeting over there. So I bring
[15:40] greetings from the believers from the
[15:43] various churches that were gathered
[15:44] there in France and from brother Jano.
[15:46] Uh we had a wonderful time in the Lord.
[15:48] So certainly um happy to bring greetings
[15:51] from them to the church and certainly to
[15:53] see that all over the world the spirit
[15:56] is moving. I had the opportunity to
[15:59] catch uh some aspects of the services
[16:02] that um took place here. Yes, I really
[16:04] want to salute um all of the services
[16:08] and the servants of the Lord who would
[16:10] have spoken from brother Gideon last
[16:13] Wednesday to the prayer meeting with
[16:15] brother oid to brother Anthony last
[16:16] Sunday to brother OID on Wednesday as
[16:18] well and to see God um loves to feed his
[16:23] sheep um with a a seven course menu
[16:27] dealing with everything from the inner
[16:29] man to our conduct to our behavior to
[16:31] our transformation. So, um, we are
[16:34] grateful, we are thankful, and I want to
[16:36] invite you, um, like I said, to get in
[16:39] the spirit of the study. Um, if someone
[16:41] is supposed to be here, send them a
[16:43] message. We have been Bible study
[16:45] tonight, and we want to make sure that
[16:48] we get as much of the food value as we
[16:51] can so we could grow tonight. So, um, by
[16:54] the grace of God, we're going to we're
[16:56] going to get right into it. So, I have a
[16:58] bit of a thought for this study tonight.
[17:01] Um it's a familiar character in
[17:03] scripture but I believe there are some
[17:05] things out of this that we could look at
[17:08] and uh I was sharing with someone
[17:10] recently you cannot exhaust scripture
[17:12] you cannot exhaust the Bible you know
[17:14] sometimes you read it and then you see
[17:15] something and you see something and you
[17:17] see something and it opens up and the
[17:19] reality is I think if it's one of the
[17:22] things we don't do enough of is really
[17:24] spend time in the word of God I find
[17:28] your life begins to really change the
[17:31] more your relationship with the word
[17:33] goes beyond a ritual and beyond a habit.
[17:37] Um even if it's a good habit, it has to
[17:39] move from a ritual or a habit into a
[17:42] practice and into a way of life and
[17:45] trying to see that every single
[17:47] scripture is there for a reason. God is
[17:49] very intentional. We have said this in
[17:51] many studies. God is very intentional
[17:53] with why every single word in scripture
[17:56] is there. And by the grace of God, as we
[17:59] look at it once, twice, three times,
[18:02] sometimes you look at a character and
[18:03] you see them in their context. But when
[18:05] you bring it into 2025 and what's
[18:07] happening now and what God wants to
[18:09] achieve and we thank God for a prophet
[18:11] that we could read the scripture in a
[18:13] way that the Pentecostals cannot because
[18:15] to us the book is completely open. As
[18:17] brother Brandham said, the opening of
[18:19] the seals made the Bible a new book. So
[18:20] we are reading it through the lens of
[18:23] the reveal word of the hour with the
[18:25] insight of the prophetic eagle eyes that
[18:27] we could see what God wants us to see
[18:29] tonight. So for a bit of a thought the
[18:31] rise and fall of King Saul the rise and
[18:35] fall of King Saul and it is interesting
[18:42] there are many people who start off
[18:44] good.
[18:47] There are very few people who actually
[18:49] start off bad when you really look at
[18:51] it. When someone comes into an
[18:54] experience with the Lord
[18:56] for every person who has backslid, walk
[18:58] away, end up in trouble, who has been in
[19:00] church, they started off good. They
[19:03] started off with the best of intentions,
[19:06] with the best of ambitions in the
[19:08] spiritual realm. They're trying to do
[19:10] God a service. They have caught a hold
[19:12] of something, whatever that looks like.
[19:14] And the challenge in more cases than not
[19:19] is not with the starting, it is with the
[19:21] finishing. And when we look at the
[19:24] narrative of Saul in scripture, this
[19:27] pattern holds true. And for the few
[19:29] minutes we speak tonight, I want to
[19:32] position this as a cautionary tale. It
[19:34] is a tale of warning to us. It is a
[19:37] story in the Bible. It is a it is a it
[19:40] is a place in scripture that if you
[19:44] don't watch closely you can make the
[19:46] same mistake and end up with the same
[19:48] problem. So let's dive into it tonight.
[19:52] So the setting and the time is just at
[19:55] the end of judges. We would recall and
[19:57] we have touched this in many different
[19:59] ways. After Joshua, Israel would have
[20:03] entered a period of the judges
[20:07] where there was a cycle of rebellion and
[20:10] oppression and repentance and
[20:13] deliverance within this period of
[20:15] judges. There are names in this that we
[20:17] have done Bible studies on and we have
[20:19] preached on. So you have Jeffa was in
[20:21] this period. Gileion was in this period.
[20:23] Samson was in this period and there was
[20:26] this cycle and we would have said in
[20:28] Alaskan mentioned every single judge
[20:30] that came the Bible told us it was worse
[20:32] and worse and worse and worse until
[20:34] Samson the final judge met the worst
[20:37] condition.
[20:39] The oppressor at the time in the days of
[20:41] Samson was going to be the Philistine.
[20:43] So we find ourselves at a point in
[20:45] scripture where there was a repeated
[20:48] statement made multiple times in the
[20:50] book of judges. There was no king in
[20:53] Israel and every man did what is in his
[20:55] heart.
[20:57] It was hinting to the fact that a king
[20:59] was going to come.
[21:01] Now brother Brandham was very clear in
[21:03] positioning that the king that was to
[21:05] come was the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[21:08] there's one quote that I'm going to
[21:09] reference because I want us to
[21:11] understand more and more that 99% of the
[21:15] issues that we think we have are
[21:17] distractions and smoke and mirrors.
[21:20] Because the battle is really not against
[21:22] flesh and blood, but is a spiritual
[21:24] battle. And if the enemy can distract us
[21:27] with the cares of life, the issues of
[21:30] life, the people around us, the work
[21:32] issues, the financial issues and all
[21:34] these other things, then the devil has
[21:36] won the battle because you are really a
[21:39] spirit being here to prove something.
[21:42] And if you allow the stresses and the
[21:44] challenges of life to distract you from
[21:46] that, you could find yourself not living
[21:48] into your full potential because you
[21:50] have lost sight of what is really
[21:52] happening here.
[21:54] And I'm saying that because in the realm
[21:56] of the heavenly and in the spiritual
[21:58] dimension, the lamb was slain before
[22:00] Adam was even born.
[22:03] The lamb was slain before sin even
[22:05] existed. So what is happening here in
[22:08] the natural realm is really a reflection
[22:11] of the celestial mind of God that's
[22:14] being reflected here to us. And the
[22:16] reason I'm making that point is we know
[22:19] a story because we we know the
[22:20] background here that when Israel
[22:24] approached Samuel and the elders and
[22:27] they say, "Hey, listen. We're looking
[22:28] for a king." God had to comfort Samuel
[22:30] and say, "Listen, Samuel, they haven't
[22:32] rejected you. They already rejected me."
[22:37] Okay. So, we're going to spend some of
[22:39] our reading in the book of Samuel, 1st
[22:41] Samuel specifically.
[22:43] And we're going to start in 1st Samuel
[22:45] 8, reading verse 4. Then all the elders
[22:49] of Israel, not some, all the elders of
[22:52] Israel gathered themselves together, and
[22:54] came to Samuel and Rama, and said unto
[22:57] him, Behold, thou art old,
[23:00] and thy sons walked not in thy ways. now
[23:03] make us a king to judge us like all the
[23:06] nations.
[23:10] And God had to comfort Samuel by the
[23:14] time he reached verse seven. And the
[23:16] Lord said unto Samuel, hearken unto the
[23:18] voice of the people in all that they say
[23:20] unto thee. For they have not rejected
[23:23] thee, but they have rejected me. Listen
[23:27] carefully that I should not reign over
[23:30] them.
[23:32] So God is picking up a deeper issue
[23:34] here. It is not just that they were
[23:36] comparing themselves with the other
[23:38] nations.
[23:40] God was looking at the motive of the
[23:42] heart behind the issue. They were
[23:44] outwardly expressing we want a king like
[23:47] the other nations to lead us into
[23:49] battle. And on a certain level that
[23:51] could sound good. But God went deeper
[23:54] than that. And his message to Samuel was
[23:56] really what they were saying. He was
[23:59] picking up that in the spiritual realm
[24:02] that I should not reign over them.
[24:06] So that's the first thing I want us to
[24:08] capture in this that in the mouth of the
[24:12] people they wanted a king to lead them
[24:14] in battle to judge over us. We're
[24:16] looking at the other nations. We want to
[24:18] be like them. And God is seeing behind
[24:21] all that expression and talk. There's a
[24:23] heart matter that's playing itself out
[24:26] in words. And as God is saying, they are
[24:28] rejecting the reign or the control that
[24:32] I want to exercise over them.
[24:36] Can God direct us? Because the issue is
[24:39] and when you look in scripture in the
[24:41] word, you realize if you were to
[24:43] attribute, so we could say Samson had a
[24:46] woman problem. We could agree with that.
[24:50] There was an issue there. If you were to
[24:52] attribute the failure of Saul, Saul had
[24:55] an obedience problem.
[24:58] The children of the day had an obedience
[25:02] issue. And obedience really has to do
[25:04] with reign and control because we want
[25:07] to be in charge. We want to do things
[25:09] our own way. And we see the first break
[25:11] where God get upset with Saul had to do
[25:15] with him breaking God's order.
[25:20] And we will go into this in a service
[25:22] we're going to have coming up soon where
[25:24] the Lord has opened up some things to me
[25:26] there. But I want us to appreciate that
[25:29] when God wants to reign over us. He
[25:31] wants to be lord of our lives. He wants
[25:34] to be king of our lives. He wants us to
[25:36] operate not by our own will but but by
[25:40] what he wants. So let's go on right now
[25:44] to build on that and just to give us
[25:46] some insight and this quote really
[25:48] helped me a lot in the message in in the
[25:51] exposition of the seven churches Smurian
[25:53] church age. Brother Brandham said God
[25:55] was the leader of the people.
[25:58] Actually he was their king. He was a
[26:01] father king. He took care of Israel like
[26:04] a man cares for his family. He fed them,
[26:08] fought their battles, smoothed away
[26:10] their difficulties, settled their
[26:12] problems. He just busied himself over
[26:15] them. They were the only nation to which
[26:18] he was truly God. But one day they got
[26:21] to looking around and they saw the
[26:24] Philistines and other nations had kings
[26:27] with them or with kings over them. It
[26:29] caught their eyes and they decided that
[26:32] they ought to humanize their leadership.
[26:34] So they wanted a king. Now listen
[26:37] carefully to the prophet's words here.
[26:40] Now God was going to humanize the
[26:43] leadership himself
[26:45] in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[26:49] Now this is where it gets deeper to
[26:51] influence.
[26:53] But they got ahead of him.
[26:56] Listen carefully. This is the prophet's
[26:58] word I'm reading here. So brother Brham
[27:00] is looking through under divine
[27:03] authority. And this is the beauty of us
[27:05] being able to do a study like this with
[27:07] the insight from a pro from a prophet of
[27:09] the age to say God was going to humanize
[27:12] leadership in the person of the Lord
[27:15] Jesus Christ. But they got ahead of him.
[27:17] And listen to this quote. Satan knew the
[27:21] plan of God
[27:23] direct from the prophet.
[27:26] Satan knew the plan of God. So he put in
[27:29] the hands of the people to get ahead of
[27:32] God the word direct quote
[27:36] and this is in direct reference to Saul
[27:39] and David and the kingship.
[27:43] So I want to to to to this here is like
[27:46] a big nugget. So now we see in three
[27:48] things we see the outward expression of
[27:50] the people we are comparing ourselves
[27:52] with people around us.
[27:55] God looking deeper and saying in their
[27:57] heart they don't want me to reign. And
[27:59] then the prophet picks up even deeper
[28:02] than that. There's a influence that led
[28:04] them even into that spot which was Satan
[28:07] who knew the plan of God that a king was
[28:11] going to come and Satan tried to bring a
[28:15] fake a a counterfeit a interception of
[28:19] the plan because he knew the plan of
[28:20] God. And I was having some fellowship on
[28:22] this and I by the grace of God I'll get
[28:24] to preach on it. But in Ezekiel 28 just
[28:27] to pick it up there where the king of Ty
[28:30] is a type of Satan. The Bible says he
[28:33] once stood in the holy mountain of God
[28:36] walking among the stones of fire. So
[28:39] within that so the Bible says in the
[28:40] king of Ty he walked Eden. So so the
[28:42] devil is not a fool.
[28:46] He had divine access because when you
[28:48] look at the religious order of the day
[28:50] and I was sharing with young people in
[28:52] France, the devil was the chief
[28:53] musician. It should come to no surprise
[28:56] to us that he uses music as one of the
[28:58] most powerful weapons because he was the
[29:00] chief musician. He was telling the
[29:02] bassman to play this, telling the
[29:03] keyboard man to play this, telling that
[29:05] is what he was. So while he's operating
[29:08] in our realm, he uses the ministers of
[29:11] darkness in the form of the entertainers
[29:13] and the singers. They are ministers.
[29:16] This is why music is so powerful. And
[29:18] you will even see here with Saul because
[29:21] in the entire of the Old Testament, you
[29:23] cannot find a demon being cast out. But
[29:26] you see music having spiritual
[29:28] implications with David playing the
[29:29] harp.
[29:31] It's spiritual forces that we're dealing
[29:33] with here. But I want us to now see that
[29:36] behind words, behind intentions, behind
[29:39] the heart, there's an influence. Brother
[29:41] Brandon preacher about influence. You're
[29:42] either influence from above or influence
[29:44] from below. So, but the Brandham through
[29:46] the eagle eyes could tell us that entire
[29:49] rejection of God could look beyond the
[29:52] heart of man himself into the devil
[29:55] actually whipping up something among the
[29:57] people to say we need a king. Everybody
[29:59] with me?
[30:02] But God
[30:04] allowed their request,
[30:07] warns them of the cost,
[30:09] and says in 1st Samuel 8,
[30:14] "This will be the manner of the king
[30:16] that shall reign over you. He will take
[30:19] your sons and appoint them for yourself
[30:22] for his chariots and to be his horsemen.
[30:25] And some shall run before his chariots
[30:27] and he shall cry out in that day because
[30:29] of your king which he shall have chosen
[30:32] you. And the Lord will not hear you in
[30:34] that day.
[30:37] And bear in mind s Sam Samuel is saying
[30:39] this to the people and he says okay we
[30:41] still want it.
[30:44] You see, you have people who you want to
[30:46] know how they could still want things
[30:47] and you tell them this thing wrong, this
[30:48] thing bad, this ain't good for you. Nah,
[30:50] I still want it. You warn people, you
[30:52] tell people if you go down this road,
[30:54] they'll end up in trouble. And nothing
[30:56] you say moving them because it is in
[30:57] their heart. It is one thing if it in
[31:00] people mind, but you see when in people
[31:01] hearts is very difficult to shift them
[31:03] from what their intent is. Everybody
[31:06] with me tonight?
[31:09] So we're moving beyond that now to this
[31:13] brother called brother Saul
[31:17] and in slowing down and reading it I was
[31:21] blown away.
[31:23] So in first Samuel 9 we are first
[31:26] introduced
[31:29] to Saul.
[31:31] Now there was a man of Benjamin
[31:35] which we know is the smallest tribe. So
[31:37] God has a way of doing these things,
[31:38] right? There was a man of Benjamin whose
[31:41] name was Kish, the son of Adiel, the son
[31:44] of Zer, the son of Bacharath, the son of
[31:47] Afia, a Benjamite, a mighty man of
[31:50] power. Now in the amplified, that mighty
[31:54] man of power is a man of influence and
[31:56] wealth.
[32:01] And he had a son whose name was Saul, a
[32:04] choice young man.
[32:06] and a goodly. And there was not among
[32:11] the children of Israel a goodlier person
[32:14] than he. You hear the description?
[32:17] Talk about having the right pedigree,
[32:19] your good family, family of influence,
[32:23] family of wealth.
[32:25] And this description is true here. Out
[32:28] of all of Israel, a choice young man.
[32:31] Choice young man mean if you're picking
[32:32] somebody, first man to pick your first
[32:35] choice. choice young man goodly.
[32:39] Not anybody among the children of Israel
[32:41] a goodly a person. What a description
[32:43] there. Bearing in mind is hundreds of
[32:46] thousands of people in Israel at the
[32:47] time.
[32:50] From his shoulders and upward, he was
[32:52] higher than any of the people
[32:56] outwardly handsome, tall, good-looking,
[33:00] good of breaking up of bringing the
[33:02] carpine fault with him.
[33:06] And the Bible goes on to say that
[33:09] effectively
[33:13] there was a situation where he would
[33:15] have had to go and and do something for
[33:17] his father to to to find some of the
[33:19] donkeys that went missing. And all of
[33:21] this was part of God's plan for him to
[33:24] meet Samuel. I'm going to skip over that
[33:25] part.
[33:29] We're going to skip down to verse
[33:34] 14.
[33:39] And they went up into the city. This is
[33:40] after they were looking for the donkeys
[33:42] that were missing. And when they were
[33:44] coming into the city, behold, Samuel
[33:46] came out against them for to go up to
[33:49] the high place. Now the Lord had told
[33:52] Samuel in his ear a day before Saul
[33:54] came, saying, "Tomorrow about this time,
[33:56] I will send thee a man out of the land
[33:59] of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him
[34:02] to be captain over my people Israel,
[34:06] that he may save my people out of the
[34:08] hand of the Philistines, for I have
[34:10] looked upon my people, because their cry
[34:12] is come unto me." I want us to notice
[34:15] that in God speaking to Samuel here,
[34:18] this is God's desire, his heart on the
[34:21] matter
[34:23] and he is expressing. So in other words,
[34:25] when you read this here, God did not
[34:27] want Saul to fail. That's the lesson I
[34:30] want us to get here first. It was God's
[34:32] intention and we will see it later on.
[34:35] It was God intention that this thing
[34:37] work. It was God's permissive will and
[34:39] action. It is not that he wanted them to
[34:41] have a king yet. But if this is what
[34:43] they want and I'm going to give them a
[34:44] king, I want to give them the best
[34:47] chance of success. I want us to take
[34:49] that away from this verse here. And when
[34:52] Samuel verse 17 saw Saul, the Lord said
[34:55] unto him, "Behold the man whom I spake
[34:58] to thee of this same shall reign over my
[35:01] people."
[35:04] Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the
[35:06] gate because Saul don't know who it is.
[35:08] Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's
[35:10] house is. And Samuel answered Saul and
[35:12] said, "I am the seer."
[35:15] And we could skip a few things there. I
[35:16] don't want to spend too much time there.
[35:19] What I want to amplify here is verse 21.
[35:24] I want you to see Saul in his in his
[35:27] beginning stages and are talking about
[35:29] starting off right. I want us to notice
[35:32] the humility of Saul, the approach of
[35:35] Saul. And we'll see more of it later on
[35:37] in verse 21. And Saul answered and said,
[35:40] "Am I
[35:41] am not I a Benjamite
[35:45] of the smallest of the tribes of
[35:47] Israel?" So firstly, we see in Saul not
[35:50] trying to push himself.
[35:53] Saul is not a overly ambitious person.
[35:56] Saul not hunting for power. So, so in
[36:00] terms of starting off right, he is
[36:01] described as goodly. He's described as
[36:04] choice. He is saying the right things.
[36:07] There's nothing that to this point you
[36:09] cannot point a finger at brother Saul.
[36:11] If people like this come into the
[36:13] service to church, you want everybody
[36:14] coming like this. Everybody with me?
[36:19] Small tribes of Israel and my family the
[36:21] least of all the families of the tribe
[36:23] of Benjamin. Almost like how Gideon
[36:25] talk. Smallest tribe, smallest family.
[36:27] I'm the small in in the family. Saul
[36:29] started off just like that. Whereof then
[36:32] speakest thou so to me? So Saul is
[36:35] saying why are you coming to me? I am
[36:37] unworthy for you to be the man of God
[36:39] even having that kind of conversation.
[36:43] I want us to just go to the last verse
[36:45] of that chapter.
[36:48] Verse 27. And as they were going down to
[36:50] the end of the city, Samuel said to
[36:52] Saul, "Bid the servant to pass on before
[36:55] us." And he passed on. But stand thou
[36:58] still a while that I may show thee the
[37:01] word of God.
[37:04] So we see now that Saul is being given
[37:07] some prophetic words
[37:10] direct from the prophet. He ain't hear
[37:12] from nobody else. The word of the Lord
[37:14] to prepare him for kingship.
[37:19] If we could all start off with that kind
[37:22] of thing then we would end up fine. And
[37:25] Saul like I said he start off good. Then
[37:29] verse 10, then Samuel, sorry, chapter
[37:32] 10, verse one. Then Samuel took a vial
[37:34] of oil and poured it upon his head and
[37:38] kissed him and said, "Is it not because
[37:41] the Lord had anointed thee to be captain
[37:44] over his inheritance?"
[37:47] So here is a private anointing.
[37:51] This is not in the public eye, but Saul
[37:54] is anointed. Are we all here tonight?
[37:57] Are we are we are we are we here?
[38:03] So
[38:06] the hunt for the donkeys Samuel tell him
[38:09] how to sort that out. And what we see
[38:11] here is God is building Saul's
[38:13] confidence by giving him sign after sign
[38:16] giving him a word a private word a
[38:19] private audience with the prophet. So he
[38:22] has he has heard from the prophet what
[38:23] others have not heard. He is anointed in
[38:26] private. Nobody else knows this is going
[38:28] on just yet. I want us to appreciate
[38:30] this, right? So, so there's something
[38:32] that's happening behind the curtain, so
[38:34] to speak, because God is preparing a man
[38:36] to deal with a certain thing
[38:41] as we progress
[38:46] in that same chapter
[38:50] down to
[38:55] to verse four. Uh let's go to verse
[39:00] five of that same chapter. After that,
[39:02] thou shalt come to the hill of God,
[39:04] where is the garrison of the Philistine,
[39:06] and it shall come to pass when thou art
[39:08] come thither to the city, that thou
[39:10] shalt meet a company of prophets coming
[39:13] down from the high place with a salt
[39:15] tree, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a
[39:18] half before them, and they shall
[39:20] prophesy. and the spirit of the Lord
[39:23] will come upon thee. So this is Samuel
[39:26] speaking to Saul. And thou shalt
[39:28] prophesy with them. Talk about God
[39:31] giving a man experiences
[39:34] to show that God is with you and shall
[39:38] be turned into another man. In other
[39:40] words, you're having a spiritual
[39:41] experience. And the man you were before,
[39:44] you're going to you're going to be a
[39:45] change.
[39:48] And let it be when these signs are come
[39:50] unto thee, that thou do as occasion
[39:53] serve thee, for God is with thee.
[39:57] What a confidence. What a vote of
[39:59] confidence that the prophet is saying,
[40:03] God is with thee. And thou shalt go down
[40:06] before me to Gilgal, and behold, I will
[40:08] come down unto thee to offer burnt
[40:10] offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices
[40:12] of peace offerings. Seven days shalt
[40:15] thou tarry.
[40:17] till I come to thee and show thee what
[40:20] thou shalt do. Now I want us to look at
[40:23] this here because all this is building
[40:26] up to something
[40:28] and this is where some of us get mixed
[40:30] up. So everything to this point is
[40:33] there's soul is getting 10 out of 10 100
[40:36] out of 100 point. There's nothing nobody
[40:39] can find fault in this. There's no other
[40:42] example in scripture almost where God
[40:44] takes a man who nobody regarded. He has
[40:47] to wonder why am I called? God said let
[40:49] me give you a word. God says let me go
[40:51] and anoint you. I'm going to give you a
[40:53] spiritual experience. You're not a
[40:55] prophet but let me have you prophesy.
[40:56] Are you with me? But within here is a
[40:59] saying.
[41:01] Thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal.
[41:04] And behold, I will come down unto thee
[41:06] to offer burnt offerings, and to
[41:08] sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings.
[41:12] Seven days thou shalt tar till I come to
[41:15] thee and show thee what thou shalt do.
[41:21] And it was so verse 9 that when he had
[41:23] turned his back to go from Samuel, God
[41:26] gave him another heart.
[41:30] So not only is he having the same but
[41:32] God actually changed his heart.
[41:36] So I want us to see because some we
[41:38] could see Saul and we see all the mystic
[41:41] side of it but I want us to see that
[41:43] many believers God does things for you.
[41:46] He encourages you. He builds your faith.
[41:49] There's a healing in your family.
[41:50] Something take place and God is showing
[41:52] you I'm with you. I'm with you. I'm with
[41:53] you.
[41:55] But within all this, our prophet told us
[41:59] full obedience to the entire word of God
[42:01] is what entitles us to the token. And
[42:04] the lesson here is about obedience.
[42:06] Because between this, there's a mystery
[42:08] that is dropped in here to say, "Wait
[42:10] for seven days."
[42:13] Between the prophesying and the change
[42:15] of heart, God say, "Wait for me through
[42:18] the prophet Samuel. For seven days, I am
[42:21] coming to do something." Let's go on.
[42:25] God gave him another heart. And all
[42:27] those signs came to pass that day.
[42:30] And when, verse 10, they came thither to
[42:32] the hill, behold, a company of prophets
[42:34] met him, and the spirit of God came upon
[42:36] him, and he prophesied among them. And
[42:39] it came to pass when all that knew him
[42:41] before time saw that old knew the old
[42:45] man, the old you.
[42:49] And when all that knew him before time
[42:51] saw that, behold, he prophesied among
[42:54] the prophets. Then the people said to
[42:56] one another, "What is this that is come
[42:58] unto the son of Kish?"
[43:01] It sound familiar. Could anything good
[43:04] come out of Nazareth? Who who is this?
[43:06] We see this boy grew up. He was never a
[43:08] prophet. He was how is he doing these
[43:11] things? Is Saul also among the prophets?
[43:13] You see the question there? And one of
[43:16] the same place answered and said, "But
[43:18] who is their father?"
[43:21] Is this not Joseph's son? You see the
[43:23] typology in scripture, right? The same
[43:25] behavior.
[43:26] Therefore, it became a proverb. Is Saul
[43:29] also among the prophets? That is the
[43:31] word. Is Saul also among the prophet? Is
[43:32] Saul also among the prophet? It's become
[43:34] a proverb.
[43:36] And when he had made an end of
[43:38] prophesying, he came to the high place.
[43:44] Let's drop down to verse 17.
[43:47] We're building now into something. So, I
[43:49] want us to appreciate to this point in
[43:53] Saul's journey, natural, spiritual, God
[43:57] dealing with Samuel, God dealing with
[43:59] the different situations. You can't find
[44:02] fault with Saul's testimony. Are you
[44:04] with me?
[44:06] Verse 17. And Samuel called the people
[44:09] together unto the Lord to Misper,
[44:13] and said unto the children of Israel,
[44:15] thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel, I
[44:18] brought
[44:19] up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered
[44:22] you out of the hand of the Egyptians,
[44:24] and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and
[44:27] of them that oppressed you. And ye have
[44:29] this day rejected." What an inauguration
[44:32] speech
[44:34] God is putting on record. We're going to
[44:37] anoint. We're going to place this king.
[44:38] But are placing on the record. How I
[44:40] feel about it. And you have this day
[44:42] rejected your God who himself save you
[44:46] out of all your adversities and your
[44:48] tribulations. And ye have said unto him,
[44:51] "Nay, but set a king over us." Now
[44:53] therefore,
[44:55] present yourself before the Lord by your
[44:57] tribes and by your thousands. And when
[45:00] Samuel had caused all the tribes of
[45:02] Israel to come near, the tribe of
[45:04] Benjamin was taken. So he's picking from
[45:07] the tribes. He pick one tribe, Benjamin.
[45:09] And when he had caused the tribe of
[45:10] Benjamin to come near by their families,
[45:12] the family of Matri was taken. That is
[45:15] the family that Saul is is part of. And
[45:19] Saul, the son of Kish, was taken. And
[45:21] listen to this. And when they sought
[45:23] him, he could not be found.
[45:27] Saul went and hiding.
[45:32] I want us to appreciate
[45:36] the brother that we dealing with. There
[45:38] are some people who are very pushy. They
[45:40] want to be in the limelight. They want
[45:42] to be called. They want to be noticed.
[45:44] They want to be recognized.
[45:48] Thus far, not only does Saul have a
[45:50] testimony of being a choice, goodly,
[45:54] well behaved, good family, humble, meek,
[45:58] he also shy.
[46:00] He actually they calling Saul. Where is
[46:03] he? Where's the man? Saul. And they
[46:05] can't find him. Saul going and hide.
[46:11] He could not be found. Therefore, they
[46:13] inquired of the Lord further. They say
[46:16] when they say Lord know because they say
[46:18] Lord he is sure because we calling for
[46:19] this man and this man not showing up.
[46:23] Therefore they inquire of the Lord
[46:25] further. And the reason I'm amplifying
[46:28] this is to see because I have seen
[46:30] people who come meek and humble and nice
[46:33] and gentle and they become mapped and
[46:36] snake and gorilla and giraffe.
[46:40] Anybody with me? People come to you
[46:43] gentle and me good brother nice brother
[46:45] nice sister thing and by the time change
[46:48] come like this car be the brother who
[46:50] come in here so nice you used to see
[46:52] somebody in work the first day of work
[46:54] they're gentle they're meek they're
[46:56] quiet they're give them two years they
[46:59] are terrorist
[47:02] because time change experiences
[47:07] change the dynamics of who they are and
[47:10] this is what happened with Saul Because
[47:12] the Saul that end up trying to kill
[47:13] David. Think think think about it. We
[47:16] know where Saul end up. Saul end up
[47:19] trying to kill David try to set David up
[47:21] all these kind of but that's not how we
[47:23] start off.
[47:25] You have to go and find where is Saul.
[47:27] Is he in the bathroom? He he outside he
[47:29] hiding. We we trying to call Saul up to
[47:32] anoint in front of the people. And when
[47:33] we looking for Saul, Saul can't be
[47:36] found.
[47:37] Therefore, they inquired of the Lord
[47:38] further if the man should yet come
[47:41] further. And the Lord answered. The Lord
[47:44] had to answer. They couldn't find him.
[47:45] And I want you to appreciate this.
[47:47] They're searching for Saul. And had it
[47:49] not been for the Lord answering, they
[47:50] couldn't find him. I want us to Anybody
[47:52] with me tonight.
[47:54] They sent deacons. They sent us. They
[47:56] sent trustees. They sent. They're
[47:58] looking to find. So, and it had to be
[48:00] the Lord
[48:02] answered, "Behold, he had hid himself
[48:04] among the stuff."
[48:06] In the amplified,
[48:10] it says here, this is uh verse 22, in
[48:13] the amplified, he is there hiding
[48:16] himself by the provision and the
[48:18] supplies. Saul big, tall. It's one thing
[48:21] for you to be a short man and hide. It's
[48:24] a whole next thing for you to be the
[48:25] tallest man. It's like when a claron
[48:27] trying to hide somewhere in the church.
[48:30] and they couldn't find him. And the Lord
[48:32] had to say, "Look behind the truck. Look
[48:35] under the provision."
[48:38] And this is an interesting thing because
[48:40] here we have a man who not pushing for
[48:42] power. He not trying to be in charge.
[48:44] Yes. Say, "Brothers, look me here." The
[48:46] man who God had chosen. This was not
[48:49] Saul's beginning. It was a humble, meek,
[48:52] gentle. I don't want to be in the
[48:54] limelight. I don't want to be in the
[48:55] forefront. Start off the way you wish
[48:58] every person is.
[49:01] And they ran and fetch him then. And
[49:04] when he stood among the people, he was
[49:07] higher than any of the people from his
[49:09] shoulders and upward.
[49:12] And Samuel said to all the people, "See
[49:15] him whom the Lord had chosen." I want us
[49:19] to appreciate this was not man's choice.
[49:24] The people did not choose Saul. They
[49:28] wanted a king, but God chose Saul.
[49:32] I want us to catch that.
[49:37] And Samuel said to all the people, "See
[49:40] him whom the Lord hath chosen,
[49:43] that there is none like him among all
[49:46] the people." And all the people shouted
[49:49] and said, "God saved the king." Then
[49:51] Samuel told the people the manner of the
[49:54] kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid
[49:57] it up before the Lord. And Samuel sent
[49:59] all the people away, every man to his
[50:02] house.
[50:04] And Saul also went home to Gibia. And
[50:07] there went with him a band of men whose
[50:10] hearts God had touched.
[50:13] So God put men around him that he
[50:16] touched their hearts. So they rally
[50:17] around this man who is shy, who may be
[50:20] insecure, who was never trained, they
[50:22] never had a king. There was no
[50:23] precedent. There was no book they could
[50:25] rely on. Israel had never had a king.
[50:28] There was nobody to mentor Saul. There
[50:30] was no playbook he could follow. There
[50:32] was no way to advise him. All he had was
[50:34] the word of the Lord. And God had to
[50:36] touch the hearts of men around him so
[50:39] they could protect his gift.
[50:42] To this point, the picture is perfect.
[50:46] There is nothing out of order
[50:51] until verse 27.
[50:53] But the children of Bial
[50:57] and that is worthless. Like you we see
[50:59] here in Trinidad worthless. The
[51:01] worthless children in every tribe in
[51:04] every church has tr Israel it has
[51:07] somebody who had to find a problem with
[51:09] something.
[51:11] How shall this man save us?
[51:14] It always somebody in the crowd know how
[51:16] this man come and save us
[51:18] and they despised him. You see the type
[51:21] of Christ they know him from nowhere but
[51:24] they despise him. That word despise is a
[51:26] powerful word. They know him but they
[51:28] despise him and brought him no presence
[51:34] showing that there was a level of work
[51:36] because if we are appointing a king you
[51:37] bring a gift to the king. You come to
[51:39] the Lord you bring a gift to the king.
[51:42] So God is picking up the attitude of
[51:45] some of the people, but he held his
[51:48] peace.
[51:50] Everybody with me tonight? We we we
[51:53] doing fine.
[51:55] So at this point, there's no public
[51:58] appreciation of Saul. There is no
[52:03] real outside of Samuel speaking, people
[52:06] saying, "Okay, the Lord touched me. We
[52:07] supporting this king. We don't
[52:08] understand it, but okay, we wanted it,
[52:10] but we don't understand it. we support
[52:12] it. You have those who saying how this
[52:13] man want save us. So so there's a lot
[52:15] going on and this is why when you talk
[52:17] about God taking a man and and like
[52:20] Joshua he magnify his ministry in front
[52:23] of the people. So Saul needed something
[52:26] and this here would be what we're going
[52:27] into very briefly is the birth of the
[52:30] song of part one of the song that the
[52:32] sisters sing that caused the problem
[52:36] because they sing Saul killed thousand
[52:38] but David killed 10,000. Remember that
[52:40] song? So we go and read the first verse
[52:42] of that song because that there was a
[52:45] testimony that led to Saul being seen a
[52:48] certain way
[52:50] 1st Samuel 11.
[52:52] Then Nahash the Ammonite
[52:56] one of those itites came up and encamped
[52:59] against Jabesh Gilead which is a body of
[53:03] believers in Israel.
[53:06] And all the men of Jabesh said unto
[53:08] Nahash the Ammonite king, "Make a
[53:11] covenant with us because they have been
[53:13] encamped like they under pressure. They
[53:15] can't go anywhere. Make a covenant with
[53:17] us and we will serve thee. Let's come to
[53:19] an agreement." And Nahash the Ammonite
[53:22] type of evil spirit type of the enemy
[53:24] answered them on this condition when I
[53:27] make a covenant with you that I may
[53:29] trust out all your right eyes. So in
[53:32] other words, the only deal I'm making is
[53:34] to take out everybody right eye. We read
[53:37] in the same Bible, right? And lay it for
[53:40] a reproach upon all Israel. So the devil
[53:42] saying the only deal we making is a
[53:44] taking out your right eye. Is so in
[53:46] other words, we not making no deal. I'm
[53:48] destroying you, holding you, you'll be
[53:50] muslav, whatever that looks like.
[53:53] And the elders of Jabesh said unto him,
[53:56] give us seven days respect respite a
[53:59] pause that we may send messengers unto
[54:02] all the course of Israel. And then if
[54:05] there be no man to save us, we will come
[54:08] out of thee.
[54:10] Then came the messengers to Giba of Saul
[54:14] and told the tidings in the ears of the
[54:16] people. And all the people lifted up
[54:18] their voices and wept. And behold, Saul,
[54:22] the anointed of God, the chosen of God,
[54:25] the called of God. They don't know his
[54:27] ministry. They don't know his journey.
[54:29] They don't know his story. And behold,
[54:32] Saul came after the herd out of the
[54:34] field. And Saul said, "What ali the
[54:37] people that they weep."
[54:40] And they told him the tidings of the men
[54:42] of Jabesh. Our brothers in Jabesh are in
[54:44] trouble, brother Saul. And look at the
[54:47] scripture. And the spirit of God came
[54:49] upon Saul when he heard those tidings,
[54:51] and his anger was kindled greatly. And
[54:54] he took a yoke of oxen, and he themed
[54:57] them in pieces, and send them throughout
[54:59] all the course of Israel by the hands of
[55:02] messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not
[55:04] forth after Saul and after Samuel, so
[55:07] shall it be done unto his oxen. And the
[55:10] fear of the Lord fell on the people. And
[55:12] they came out with one consent.
[55:15] This is the first time in the history of
[55:18] Israel since the days of Moses and
[55:20] Joshua that the army of Israel is about
[55:22] to rise up like this.
[55:25] And when he had numbered them in Bez
[55:29] of Israel were 300,000.
[55:32] You you hear you hear the number. You
[55:34] know how much soldiers we have in in
[55:35] Trinidad and Tobago? We have a regiment
[55:38] because we're not qualified to be an
[55:39] army.
[55:42] You know that we don't have an army. We
[55:44] have a Tobago army regiment regiment
[55:47] because you need a certain amount of
[55:48] people to be an army. We have an air
[55:51] guard. We have an air force because to
[55:52] be a force you need more than a guard.
[55:55] So when they So so here it is. He show
[55:57] the strength of Israel under King Saul.
[56:00] And when he numbered them in Bez, the
[56:02] children of Israel were 300,000
[56:05] and the elite forces the men of Judah
[56:09] 30,000. Because you know Judah is a
[56:11] whole different story.
[56:13] So you have 300,000 in Israel and 30,000
[56:18] of the tribe of Judah. Them are the
[56:19] fearless warriors of Judah. And they
[56:22] said unto the messengers that came, thus
[56:25] shall he say unto the men of Jabesh,
[56:28] tell our brothers in Jes.
[56:34] Hallelujah. I like that kind of thing.
[56:37] Saul said, "Tell them, tell them,
[56:39] brothers, by midday tomorrow, you'll get
[56:42] help. You're looking for help, help
[56:43] woman."
[56:45] And the messengers came and showed it to
[56:47] the men of Jabesh. And they were glad.
[56:49] Now, the men of Jabesh, they easy
[56:51] either. Therefore, the men of Jab said
[56:54] to the Ammonites, "Tomorrow we will come
[56:57] out to you, and you shall do with us all
[57:00] that seemth good to you." Red setup talk
[57:02] now because they have confidence. They
[57:04] say, "Tomorrow we will come. Whatever
[57:06] you want to do to us, you go ahead and
[57:07] do because they feeling good about
[57:09] yourself. That's some help coming. Isn't
[57:12] it a confidence when they know you have
[57:13] help coming from the Lord? Isn't that to
[57:15] know that somebody praying for you and
[57:17] they can and they can move a certain
[57:18] way? Them fellas change from a fearful
[57:20] kind of talk to they're telling the
[57:22] enemy tomorrow we coming out. Whatever
[57:24] you want to do us do us now.
[57:28] And it was so verse 11 on tomorrow that
[57:31] Saul put the people in three companies.
[57:33] This was Saul. They had no formal army.
[57:36] All of a sudden, this is inspiration.
[57:38] This is uncction. This is anointing.
[57:40] This is grace. This is God giving him
[57:42] what it takes to lead. Not just lead,
[57:45] but to firmly establish who he is as
[57:48] king, appointed, chosen by God. And it
[57:52] was so on the tomorrow that Saul put the
[57:54] people in three companies. And they came
[57:56] it in the midst of the host in the
[57:58] morning watch. So in the early morning,
[58:03] Saul moving 338,000
[58:06] men early in the morning and slew the
[58:08] Ammonites until the heat of the day,
[58:10] beat them in the morning all the way to
[58:12] lunchtime.
[58:15] And it came to pass that they which
[58:18] remained were scattered, so that two of
[58:20] them were not left together. In other
[58:22] words, when you look at the field, no
[58:24] two ammonites was next to each other.
[58:26] Nevertheless, was in single one man over
[58:28] there, one man over there, one man
[58:30] running for your life.
[58:33] And the people said unto Samuel, who is
[58:36] he that said, "Shall Saul reign over us?
[58:40] Bring the men and we will put them to
[58:41] death." You see them worthless men in
[58:43] the last chapter
[58:44] who say what Saul go and do. When the
[58:48] people see how the Lord worked with
[58:50] Saul, they say all the people who had
[58:52] negative thing to say about King Saul,
[58:55] let me bring them here and kill them. In
[58:57] other words, it's saying we have seen
[58:59] with our own eyes the Lord move upon
[59:01] King Saul. Everybody with me? And I want
[59:04] us to see for those who were in Israel
[59:07] looking at this because the testimony,
[59:09] the talk, the narrative was there. He
[59:12] meets Samuel, Samuel anoint him, God
[59:14] placed him. There's nothing going wrong
[59:16] with this picture. This picture to this
[59:18] point is picture perfect. It is not how
[59:21] we start. Everybody with me tonight.
[59:24] Could we take some more?
[59:27] All right. But Clarence say we going on.
[59:29] If only they have any issues take it up
[59:31] Clarence.
[59:36] And the people said unto Samuel, who is
[59:38] he that said, "Shall Saul reign over us?
[59:41] Bring the men and we will put them to
[59:42] death." And Saul said, "There shall not
[59:44] a man be put to death this day." We are
[59:47] not here about that. For today the Lord
[59:49] hath wrought salvation in Israel.
[59:52] Hallelujah. Then said Samuel to the
[59:54] people, "Come and let us go to Gilgal
[59:57] and renew the kingdom there." Now
[59:59] remember Gilgal in the last chapter is
[1:00:02] where Samuel say me there in seven days
[1:00:06] and I will offer sacrifice.
[1:00:11] And there they sac they they sacrifice
[1:00:13] sacrifice of peace offering for the Lord
[1:00:15] and their soul and all the men of Israel
[1:00:17] rejoice greatly.
[1:00:22] I want to skip
[1:00:24] to
[1:00:33] to chapter 13
[1:00:40] to connect with this mystery here.
[1:00:48] Chapter 13
[1:00:51] to verse 5 and 13.
[1:00:55] And the Philistine gathered themselves
[1:00:57] together to fight with Israel 30,000
[1:00:59] chariots and 6,000 horsemen and people
[1:01:02] as a sandwiches on the seashore in
[1:01:04] multitude. And they came up and pitched
[1:01:06] in mcmatch eastward from Beth Heaven.
[1:01:10] When the men of Israel saw that they
[1:01:12] were in a straight, for the people were
[1:01:14] distressed, the people did hide
[1:01:15] themselves in caves and in tickets and
[1:01:16] in rocks and in high places and in pits.
[1:01:19] And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan
[1:01:21] to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for
[1:01:23] Saul, he was yet in Gilgal. And all the
[1:01:26] people followed him trembling.
[1:01:30] And he tried seven days according to the
[1:01:33] set time that Samuel had appointed.
[1:01:37] Now I want us to notice up till this
[1:01:40] point, picture perfect, but Samuel came
[1:01:44] not to Gilgal,
[1:01:47] and the people were scattered from him.
[1:01:51] And Saul said, "Bring hither a burnt
[1:01:54] offering to me and peace offerings."
[1:01:59] And he offered the burnt offering.
[1:02:03] And it came to pass, as soon as he had
[1:02:06] made an end of offering, the burnt
[1:02:08] offering, behold, Samuel came, and Saul
[1:02:12] went out to meet him, that he might
[1:02:14] salute him. And Samuel said, "What hast
[1:02:17] thou done?" And Saul said, because I saw
[1:02:22] that the people were scattered from me,
[1:02:26] and that thou camest not within the days
[1:02:28] appointed,
[1:02:30] and that the Philistines gathered
[1:02:32] themselves together at Mcmatch,
[1:02:35] therefore said I, the Philistines will
[1:02:38] come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I
[1:02:41] have not made supplication unto the
[1:02:43] Lord. I forced myself therefore, you see
[1:02:46] how we positioning it here,
[1:02:49] and offered a burnt offering. Now, I
[1:02:51] want you to understand the instruction
[1:02:54] about this type of offering is not for
[1:02:56] King Saul to ever do.
[1:02:59] He's not a priest. He's not a prophet.
[1:03:02] So, a few things happening right here
[1:03:03] now. One, he not taking responsibility.
[1:03:07] Two, he say, "I forced myself to do it."
[1:03:09] Three, he say, "The people caused me to
[1:03:10] do it.
[1:03:15] Verse 13. And Samuel said to Saul, now
[1:03:18] again before I even go there,
[1:03:22] it looked right. You know, he do not
[1:03:23] sacrifice to the Lord.
[1:03:26] And this is where and this again is
[1:03:29] before the obedience is better than
[1:03:31] sacrifice situation
[1:03:33] because that was the last straw. So
[1:03:35] we're talking about levels of
[1:03:36] progression of foolishness. This is like
[1:03:39] Samson going to Timnath before he reach
[1:03:41] all the way to Delilah. It is how much
[1:03:43] grace would God give when he show you
[1:03:46] I've been with you. God is with you.
[1:03:48] That's what settles to to us all. God is
[1:03:50] with you. The anointing upon you. The
[1:03:52] spirit of prophecy came upon you. You
[1:03:54] have everything you need to trust God at
[1:03:56] his word because the issue now becomes
[1:03:59] if the word comes from the prophet. It
[1:04:01] was the prophet who told him hold on
[1:04:03] here. Don't do it. I will be there to do
[1:04:06] it myself.
[1:04:09] This here is mindboggling because it
[1:04:12] makes you really look at the situation a
[1:04:15] bit differently. Verse 13. And Samuel
[1:04:18] said to Saul, "Thou has done foolishly.
[1:04:21] Thou has not kept the commandment of the
[1:04:25] Lord thy God, which he commanded thee."
[1:04:29] Listen to what Samuel says here.
[1:04:32] For now will the Lord have established
[1:04:34] thy kingdom upon Israel forever.
[1:04:38] This is mind-blowing because Samuel is
[1:04:41] saying because of this thing now here is
[1:04:46] what God will break what would have been
[1:04:48] forever is broken with this one thing
[1:04:50] here.
[1:04:52] In other words, had Saul stayed obedient
[1:04:56] because something shifted in Saul to let
[1:05:00] him disobey, he presumed. He assume
[1:05:03] authority he didn't have. That that
[1:05:05] that's a big thing. Doing God a service
[1:05:07] without it being his will. And here it
[1:05:09] is Samuel is saying, "But now
[1:05:15] thou has thou hast not kept the
[1:05:17] commandment of the Lord thy God which he
[1:05:19] commanded thee. For now, what the Lord
[1:05:21] have established thy kingdom upon Israel
[1:05:23] forever.
[1:05:26] But brother Samuel, I make an offering
[1:05:28] unto the Lord. It was the Lord. But it's
[1:05:29] not your place to do that.
[1:05:33] That is not what you were born to do.
[1:05:34] That's not your ministry. Why are you
[1:05:35] trying to be why you do? That is not
[1:05:37] what God said. And many of us because it
[1:05:40] feels good. Because it we think it's
[1:05:42] spiritual. Because it's something that
[1:05:44] we in our heart. And this here is about
[1:05:46] impatience because Saul been saying I
[1:05:48] couldn't wait. I didn't want to wait on
[1:05:50] the Lord.
[1:05:52] I find the Lord taking too long. So I
[1:05:54] took matters in my own hand.
[1:05:57] This is what is is happening here is a
[1:05:59] few things here because it's not just
[1:06:01] impatience but by what authority do you
[1:06:05] go to offer a sacrifice when that is
[1:06:07] reserved to priest and prophet
[1:06:10] and you're not a priest or a prophet.
[1:06:12] No wonder the prophet say don't desire a
[1:06:14] ministry. Here we have a man who is
[1:06:17] anointed and called for a specific
[1:06:19] purpose and he's supposed to be batting
[1:06:21] in his crease as we say here
[1:06:24] and whether you call it pressure from
[1:06:26] the people because I don't buy pressure
[1:06:28] from the people because at the end of
[1:06:30] the day it's still a choice he made a
[1:06:33] choice
[1:06:34] and when it comes down to accepting
[1:06:37] responsibility
[1:06:39] Samuel didn't say because of the people
[1:06:42] your kingdom will no longer be
[1:06:43] established because thou has done this
[1:06:46] thing.
[1:06:49] And Samuel verse 13 said to Saul, "Thou
[1:06:54] hast done foolishly, thou hast not kept
[1:06:57] the commandment of the Lord thy God." I
[1:07:01] want to drill here a bit
[1:07:04] because many times we hear things in the
[1:07:07] word. We hear things from the pulpit and
[1:07:10] the Lord is saying, "Do this. Don't do
[1:07:12] this. Do this. Don't do this. Do this.
[1:07:15] Don't do this. Saul had a perfect track
[1:07:18] record.
[1:07:20] And here it is. God is saying, "All I
[1:07:22] want you to do is to obey."
[1:07:26] Obedience. And that's why I made
[1:07:29] reference to the prophet's own teaching
[1:07:30] to us. Full obedience to the word of
[1:07:34] God. The entire word of God is what
[1:07:36] entitles you to the token.
[1:07:40] Jesus himself had to learn obedience by
[1:07:42] the things he suffered.
[1:07:45] It was this same soul that Samuel had to
[1:07:48] rebuke later on if we get to it with
[1:07:50] obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:07:53] because here it is Saul is saying but I
[1:07:55] feel if I didn't do a sacrifice at least
[1:07:57] at least I cover myself.
[1:08:00] It was the same kind of talk because
[1:08:02] clearly this teaching didn't even stick
[1:08:06] because God was saying to him here you
[1:08:08] will still remain king. It will not be
[1:08:10] established forever. By the time he
[1:08:12] spared King Aag God say I'm done with
[1:08:14] you. You done your whole line finished.
[1:08:17] Anybody with me? Over the issue of
[1:08:20] obedience.
[1:08:22] It baffles me how the word could be
[1:08:25] clear on things and people refuse to
[1:08:27] obey and they expect God to bless them.
[1:08:33] God is God know he's not at our level.
[1:08:38] If God say forsake not the assembling.
[1:08:40] If God say drop your alts. If God say be
[1:08:43] holy
[1:08:45] present your bodies a living sacrifice.
[1:08:47] We take these things too casually. God
[1:08:50] looking at it as a suggestion. This is
[1:08:52] what I want us to appreciate here. God
[1:08:55] say you have done foolishly.
[1:09:00] Thou has not kept the commandment of the
[1:09:03] Lord thy God. Have I not given you
[1:09:05] enough signs, enough confirmation,
[1:09:08] enough everything for you to stand on
[1:09:11] the word and wait until power fall in
[1:09:15] the upper room. But I don't want to type
[1:09:17] but they say somebody feeling inspired
[1:09:18] to say no wait until power comes from.
[1:09:23] But I want to drive this home church.
[1:09:26] We cannot present God an alternative
[1:09:29] view of the word because that's what
[1:09:31] this also was. But Lord, I still give
[1:09:33] you a sacrifice to know
[1:09:36] because that is what Saul showed later
[1:09:38] on. I reserved this to sacrifice unto
[1:09:41] you. And God said, I ask you to do that.
[1:09:45] I told you to kill all your Amalachites.
[1:09:49] You can interpret that because you
[1:09:51] feeling spiritual.
[1:09:53] Are you with me?
[1:09:57] Thou has done foolishly. Thou has not
[1:09:59] kept the commandment of the Lord thy
[1:10:01] God, which he commanded thee. For now
[1:10:05] would the Lord hath established thy
[1:10:07] kingdom upon Israel forever. But now thy
[1:10:11] kingdom shall not continue. The Lord had
[1:10:14] sought him a man after his own heart.
[1:10:18] And the Lord hath commanded him to be
[1:10:20] captain over his people because thou
[1:10:23] hast not kept that which the Lord
[1:10:25] commanded thee.
[1:10:30] It makes us re look at what is the Lord
[1:10:33] saying to us?
[1:10:36] Everybody feeling fine?
[1:10:45] So that was the first
[1:10:48] break in the relationship
[1:10:51] between
[1:10:53] Saul the timid Saul hiding Saul where is
[1:11:00] Saul to Saul reaching to a presuming
[1:11:03] making assumptions making decisions
[1:11:06] assuming power he don't have
[1:11:09] like many people you give them some
[1:11:11] power they can't they start to lose
[1:11:13] sensitivity all of a sudden they start
[1:11:14] to assume assume they have more. They
[1:11:16] had to think it's their own strength.
[1:11:18] This is a lesson to us. That's why I
[1:11:20] call it the rise and fall of King Saul
[1:11:24] because his testimony was spotless. And
[1:11:27] we have seen many men rise, great
[1:11:31] ministries, great experiences, great
[1:11:33] businesses, great all kind of different
[1:11:35] things. But there comes a point where
[1:11:38] something trips or something triggers.
[1:11:41] And the sad truth is for most there's
[1:11:44] never a recovery
[1:11:46] because it becomes an affront to God and
[1:11:49] the depend because I want us to process
[1:11:52] this. What Saul is saying is I can't
[1:11:54] wait on the prophet.
[1:11:57] I have a better idea because if the
[1:11:59] prophet and me wait here he coming and I
[1:12:01] recognize well I find like he taking too
[1:12:03] long boy I suddenly going to do what the
[1:12:05] prophet supposed to do. I going to
[1:12:08] interpret to the people what the
[1:12:09] prophets was to interpret to the people.
[1:12:11] There are so we could spend the next
[1:12:13] three hours on this thing here.
[1:12:16] And the reason is important because God
[1:12:19] for that one act destroy what could have
[1:12:22] been Saul's kingdom forever.
[1:12:29] So that is Saul's the beginning of the
[1:12:32] end. And let's just jump quickly because
[1:12:34] time is almost spent to what almost
[1:12:36] solidify or what solidify the end in 1
[1:12:39] Samuel
[1:12:41] chapter 15. We can't get to all of it.
[1:12:44] This is a wide is a case study as a
[1:12:47] cautionary tale.
[1:12:50] 1st Samuel 15. Samuel also said unto
[1:12:55] Saul,
[1:12:57] "The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be
[1:13:00] king over his people, over Israel." So
[1:13:03] at this point,
[1:13:05] what we know to be true is the eternal
[1:13:08] reign that could have been his legacy
[1:13:10] has already been affected by a previous
[1:13:12] decision. But he is still king. Are we
[1:13:15] together? He is still king. God still
[1:13:18] honoring the choice.
[1:13:20] The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be
[1:13:22] king over his people, over Israel. Now
[1:13:25] therefore, hearken thou unto the voice
[1:13:27] of the words of the Lord. And what I
[1:13:29] want us to notice here is there is no
[1:13:32] context in scripture where there isn't a
[1:13:35] space where somebody could almost turn
[1:13:37] back or turn back like like So you
[1:13:40] messed up the first time, but here was
[1:13:42] another opportunity
[1:13:44] for Saul to do the right thing. Anybody
[1:13:47] with me?
[1:13:50] Thus say the Lord of hosts. Verse two, I
[1:13:54] remember
[1:13:55] that which Amalecch did to Israel. This
[1:13:59] is the Amalachites. We're going to talk
[1:14:01] about this again. We talked about this
[1:14:03] before that Amalecch was
[1:14:08] the one when Israel left Egypt. They had
[1:14:10] no army. They were defenseless. They had
[1:14:13] no weapons. They were a broken people.
[1:14:16] They were a tired people. They spend
[1:14:17] their time in slavery. They had no
[1:14:19] military strategy. They had no generals.
[1:14:21] They had no fighting men. They had none
[1:14:23] of these things.
[1:14:25] And Amalecch attacked them at their
[1:14:28] weakest point. And God hated it in so
[1:14:32] much that he said, "I will blot out
[1:14:34] their name forever."
[1:14:38] Because God hates when you knock
[1:14:41] somebody down. Who down?
[1:14:45] Can I say that one more time?
[1:14:48] The people were broken. They were now
[1:14:50] getting free from bondage. They could
[1:14:52] not defend themselves. They couldn't
[1:14:54] protect themselves. They couldn't help
[1:14:55] themselves. They had no war machines.
[1:14:57] They had no military experience. For 400
[1:14:59] years, they were in bondage. They were
[1:15:01] not fighting people. Amalecch was a
[1:15:03] warrior tribe. And we're going to preach
[1:15:05] about that again. Amalecch traces were
[1:15:07] way old to to to Hmon in the days of
[1:15:09] Esther, the Agagite. This is why God was
[1:15:12] so upset that King Aag was left alive
[1:15:15] because had you killed when I preached
[1:15:17] this before I said you should have
[1:15:18] killed all the Amalachites because had
[1:15:19] you killed all the Amalachites you would
[1:15:21] have never had Hmon in the days of
[1:15:22] Esther. But God said he was angry and
[1:15:26] here he said thus said the Lord of
[1:15:28] hosts. I remember
[1:15:32] in other words this thing bother God so
[1:15:33] much that centuries later it still
[1:15:36] bother him. I remember you don't have to
[1:15:39] remind God about the things that
[1:15:42] happened in your life that go vengeance
[1:15:44] belongs to God.
[1:15:46] It is not as if Israel was looking for
[1:15:48] revenge against Amalecch. You know Saul
[1:15:51] wasn't thinking about revenge. Samuel
[1:15:53] wasn't thinking about revenge. Israel
[1:15:55] wasn't thinking about revenge. They
[1:15:56] weren't thinking about vengeance. God
[1:15:57] sit down in his sovereignty and says,
[1:16:01] "You know what? I remember what Amalecch
[1:16:04] did." Hallelujah.
[1:16:07] that which Amalecch did to Israel, how
[1:16:09] he laid weight for him in the way when
[1:16:11] he came up from Egypt. And now go and
[1:16:14] smite Amalecch, and utterly destroy all
[1:16:18] that they have. Spare them not, but slay
[1:16:22] both man and woman, infant and suckling,
[1:16:25] ox and sheep, camel and ass. And Saul
[1:16:29] gathered the people together and
[1:16:31] numbered them in Telm, 200,000 footmen,
[1:16:35] and 10,000 men of Judah.
[1:16:38] And Saul came to a city of Amalecch, and
[1:16:41] laid weight in the valley.
[1:16:46] And Saul said unto the Kennites, "Go
[1:16:48] depart, get you down from among the
[1:16:50] Amalcites, lest I destroy you with them,
[1:16:53] for you showed kindness to all the
[1:16:54] children of Israel when they came up out
[1:16:57] of Egypt." So the Kennites departed from
[1:16:58] among the Amalachites,
[1:17:00] and Saul smote the Amalachites from
[1:17:03] Havila until thou comest to Shure, that
[1:17:07] is over against Egypt. And he took Ag,
[1:17:10] the king of the Amalachites alive, and
[1:17:12] utterly destroyed all the people with
[1:17:14] the edge of the sword.
[1:17:18] But Saul and the people spared Ag
[1:17:22] and the best of the sheep and of the
[1:17:25] oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs
[1:17:28] and all that was good and would not
[1:17:31] utterly destroy them. But everything
[1:17:34] that was vile and refuse that they
[1:17:36] destroyed utterly. So the things they
[1:17:38] didn't want is what they get rid of but
[1:17:40] everything that was nice they keep it.
[1:17:43] What the issue here again is the lesson
[1:17:45] here is about full. So when you talk
[1:17:46] about Saul the issues full obedience you
[1:17:48] know because what we see is partial
[1:17:51] obedience.
[1:17:52] People want to serve God with a
[1:17:55] percentage of serving.
[1:17:58] That is the lesson here tonight. People
[1:18:01] want to serve God to a degree to a point
[1:18:04] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:18:06] the power thereof. They want to serve
[1:18:07] God the way they want to do it not the
[1:18:10] way God says to do it.
[1:18:15] Then came the word of the Lord unto
[1:18:17] Samuel saying, this is verse 10 into
[1:18:20] verse 11. It repented me that I have set
[1:18:23] up Saul to be king. It was after this
[1:18:27] God say n boy, this thing going too far.
[1:18:32] The last time he said the kingdom was
[1:18:34] going to be eternal. No, it was going to
[1:18:37] be a long reign. But here you say I
[1:18:39] really picked the wrong man.
[1:18:42] It gone beyond cutting off the kingdom
[1:18:44] to saying this year was a bad decision.
[1:18:50] Could you imagine?
[1:18:53] It repented me
[1:18:56] that I have set up Saul to be king for
[1:18:58] he is turned back from following me. How
[1:19:01] does a man who was shy, hiding behind
[1:19:03] the fruits, hiding behind the caravan,
[1:19:06] nobody know me, smallest man in the
[1:19:08] tribe, humble brother, nice brother, no
[1:19:10] problem, no trouble, reached the point
[1:19:13] where God could say, listen, he has
[1:19:15] turned back from following me. He doing
[1:19:17] his own thing.
[1:19:20] I thought I picked somebody who could
[1:19:22] follow my instruction, follow my
[1:19:24] guidance, follow my leading. And here it
[1:19:26] is. The Saul that I call is not the Saul
[1:19:28] who king who is king now. The nice
[1:19:31] brother, the nice husband, the nice
[1:19:33] wife, the nice son who was in church and
[1:19:36] has been in church. All of a sudden,
[1:19:37] they're not the same person.
[1:19:40] Anybody with me? Something has changed
[1:19:44] in him.
[1:19:49] Turned back on following me and had not
[1:19:51] performed my commandments plural. And it
[1:19:54] grieved Samuel and he cried unto the
[1:19:57] Lord all night.
[1:19:59] You hear that?
[1:20:02] All night Samuel cried.
[1:20:06] Some of us have issues we supposed to be
[1:20:07] crying about and we crying.
[1:20:10] Lord help us.
[1:20:14] And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul
[1:20:17] in the morning because bear in mind God
[1:20:19] talking to Samuel and Samuel realize he
[1:20:23] don't know fully what God talking about
[1:20:25] and want us to appreciate this God say
[1:20:28] this man are listening to me but he get
[1:20:31] the insight yet when Samuel rose early
[1:20:33] to meet Saul in the morning it was told
[1:20:35] Samuel saying Saul came to Camel and
[1:20:37] behold he set him up a place and is gone
[1:20:40] about and passed on and gone down to
[1:20:42] Gilgal
[1:20:43] and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said
[1:20:45] unto him, "Blessed be thou of the Lord."
[1:20:48] Nice words there. Nice greeting and
[1:20:50] thing. God bless you. Good to see you.
[1:20:53] I have performed the commandment of the
[1:20:55] Lord. And Samuel said, "What meaning
[1:20:59] then this bleeding of the sheep in my
[1:21:02] ear, and the loing of the oxen which I
[1:21:05] hear?" And Saul said, "They have brought
[1:21:08] them from the Amalachites.
[1:21:10] For the people spared the best of the
[1:21:13] sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto
[1:21:15] the Lord thy God, and the rest we have
[1:21:18] utterly destroyed here because here what
[1:21:20] we is already a religious spirit in
[1:21:25] is a religious spirit because they're
[1:21:27] saying and it sound good if you not
[1:21:29] spiritual and you not on the word you
[1:21:31] say but I hear but brother Saul say
[1:21:32] we're going to sacrifice to to the lord
[1:21:34] you're in the army I say but but what
[1:21:36] but I I don't see what wrong I don't see
[1:21:38] why Samuel vex
[1:21:41] because it's sacrifice. We go and
[1:21:42] sacrifice. Aren't we supposed to
[1:21:43] sacrifice unto the Lord?
[1:21:47] Because this here is a form of worship.
[1:21:52] Then Samuel said unto Saul, "Stay, and I
[1:21:55] will tell thee what the Lord has said to
[1:21:56] me this night." And he said, And he said
[1:21:59] unto him, "Say on." And Samuel said,
[1:22:02] "When thou was little in thine own
[1:22:04] sight," you see it here again. You see
[1:22:06] what? Pick up the shyness and all that
[1:22:07] stuff.
[1:22:09] When thou was little in thine own sight,
[1:22:11] was thou not made the head of the tribes
[1:22:14] of Israel? In other words, you have seen
[1:22:17] yourself as nobody. In other words, you
[1:22:18] raise yourself, you put yourself there.
[1:22:22] You are promote yourself. You didn't
[1:22:24] volunteer. You didn't choose. You didn't
[1:22:26] apply. You was just living your life.
[1:22:28] You were small in your own eyes.
[1:22:33] Was not thou made the head of the tribes
[1:22:36] of Israel? And the Lord anointed the
[1:22:38] king over Israel.
[1:22:40] And this is friends. I want us to preach
[1:22:42] something. And I said this to the young
[1:22:44] people in France. I believe all the
[1:22:46] achievement you make, it's not you make
[1:22:48] the achievement. You you are the one not
[1:22:49] the one who study. Well, I study hard
[1:22:51] and I work hard for you. Work hard for
[1:22:52] what you have.
[1:22:54] If the Lord give you brain and strength
[1:22:56] to get up in the morning people can't
[1:22:57] get up who I get up this morning yet.
[1:23:00] It have people that make it up the bed.
[1:23:02] I work hard. Well, I haven't. You ain't
[1:23:04] know how hard I work. What hard you work
[1:23:06] if it's not the Lord wake up and give
[1:23:08] you the strength the presence the mind
[1:23:10] ability you ought to be so grateful what
[1:23:13] end up happening so end up getting
[1:23:15] beyond himself you know because for you
[1:23:18] to start to do what you want it means
[1:23:19] you start to forget how you reach where
[1:23:21] you reach you start to forget is the
[1:23:24] grace of God is the mercy of God is the
[1:23:26] provision of God is the providence of
[1:23:27] God I'm I'm I'm about to close out we
[1:23:30] can't finish I I barely scratch the
[1:23:32] surface of the elements I want to get
[1:23:33] into but I believe the point getting
[1:23:35] home here to us because we touch on the
[1:23:38] rise this journey of a man who came from
[1:23:41] nothing and God blessed him and blessed
[1:23:43] him and blessed him and blessed him and
[1:23:46] God didn't judge judge judge God didn't
[1:23:48] break down break down break down God
[1:23:49] didn't punish punish punish he made
[1:23:52] choices to do his own thing
[1:23:54] and this is the issue with us we by our
[1:23:57] very nature want to do anything and you
[1:24:01] being anointed or being in having a gift
[1:24:04] yet again with the gift of prophecy
[1:24:06] doesn't change the fact that people end
[1:24:08] up choosing to do their own thing and
[1:24:11] God hates it because none of the things
[1:24:13] he got the anointing the gift of
[1:24:15] prophecy all the was is nothing that he
[1:24:17] earned himself
[1:24:20] verse 17 we closing out when thou was
[1:24:23] little in thine own sight was thou not
[1:24:26] made the head of the tribes of Israel
[1:24:28] and the Lord anointed thee king over
[1:24:30] Israel and the Lord sent thee on a
[1:24:33] journey
[1:24:35] and said, "Go and utterly destroy the
[1:24:37] sinners, the Amalachites, and fight
[1:24:39] against them until they be consumed."
[1:24:42] Wherefore then, listen to this, "Didest
[1:24:45] thou not obey
[1:24:49] the voice of the Lord? But did fly upon
[1:24:52] the spoil, and didest evil in the sight
[1:24:54] of the Lord?"
[1:24:57] And Saul said unto Samuel, "Yeah, I have
[1:24:59] obeyed the voice of the Lord, and I have
[1:25:01] gone the way which the Lord sent me, and
[1:25:04] have brought A, the king of the
[1:25:05] Amalachites, and have utterly destroyed
[1:25:07] the Amalachites."
[1:25:09] But, and here again is the lack of
[1:25:12] responsibility, but is the people.
[1:25:16] We see ministers seeing us as the people
[1:25:20] who do it, but the people took up the
[1:25:22] spoil. But you are king.
[1:25:26] You have to accept resp. God not holding
[1:25:28] the people here responsible. No, God
[1:25:29] saying you are king. The instruction was
[1:25:31] to you.
[1:25:33] But the people took of the spoil sheep
[1:25:35] and oxen, the chief of the things which
[1:25:37] should have been utterly destroyed to
[1:25:39] sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in
[1:25:41] Gilgal.
[1:25:42] And Samuel said, Had the Lord as great
[1:25:45] delight in burnt offerings and
[1:25:47] sacrificing as in obeying the voice of
[1:25:51] the Lord? Behold,
[1:25:54] to obey is better than sacrifice,
[1:25:58] and to hearken than the fat of rams. For
[1:26:02] rebellion
[1:26:04] is as the sin of witchcraft. That's a
[1:26:08] powerful statement. So God actually saw
[1:26:12] Saul's action as rebellion and equate
[1:26:16] that rebellion. So for him, disobedience
[1:26:19] equals rebellion,
[1:26:22] rebellion equals witchcraft,
[1:26:24] disobedience equals witchcraft. It's a a
[1:26:26] equal bal c equation you write here.
[1:26:31] For rebellion is as the sin of
[1:26:34] witchcraft and stubbornness
[1:26:38] is as iniquity and idolatry.
[1:26:43] Because thou hast rejected
[1:26:46] the word of the Lord, he hath also
[1:26:51] rejected thee from being king.
[1:26:55] We will stop there tonight and we may
[1:26:58] have to do a part two if the Lord allows
[1:27:00] us because I have another one I want to
[1:27:02] do on another character to highlight
[1:27:05] things because I do find that when you
[1:27:06] take it from a character perspective,
[1:27:08] it's easier to remember some of these
[1:27:10] things. Brother Brandham say he could
[1:27:11] preach your blew to the face.
[1:27:17] I ponder sometimes when people hear the
[1:27:20] word of God
[1:27:22] saying do this, do this, do this,
[1:27:24] worship, sing, pray, come to service,
[1:27:28] cut off the world, dress right, live
[1:27:30] holy.
[1:27:32] These are things that are doable.
[1:27:37] They're not impossible. present your
[1:27:39] bodies a living sacrifice.
[1:27:42] He calls it a reasonable service
[1:27:46] and we become so casual we don't even
[1:27:48] realize when we end up into rebellion,
[1:27:51] witchcraft and idolatry.
[1:27:54] I trust tonight as we close this session
[1:27:57] we ponder very carefully the word of the
[1:28:00] Lord concerning us because none of us
[1:28:03] call ourselves, none of us chose
[1:28:05] ourselves. All of us in some way or the
[1:28:07] other would be like Saul hiding because
[1:28:11] we didn't choose this. This chose us. We
[1:28:13] were predestinated for this thing. In
[1:28:16] fact, Jesus said, "You have not chosen
[1:28:18] me, but I have chosen you." And the
[1:28:20] choice he has made towards us also came
[1:28:23] with provision based on the choice to
[1:28:26] endure for the journey.
[1:28:28] So in other words, you have what it
[1:28:30] takes to be a Christian.
[1:28:32] God did not lack in equipping you with
[1:28:36] what it takes to be a Christian. The
[1:28:38] problem with Saul was his choices, not
[1:28:42] the gift, not the anointing, not the
[1:28:44] spirit, not the vindication, not the
[1:28:46] present, not even the word. Even though
[1:28:48] Samuel the prophet shared things with
[1:28:49] him spiritually, the third pole as it
[1:28:52] were to give him insight into the
[1:28:53] prophetic realm and that was not enough
[1:28:56] to prevent him from making bad choices.
[1:29:00] It doesn't care how long you're in
[1:29:01] church, what position you hold. The
[1:29:04] issue and the lesson here is making bad
[1:29:07] decisions
[1:29:10] because at no time did God set Saul up
[1:29:13] for failure.
[1:29:16] And in both scenarios,
[1:29:19] Saul had somebody to blame. It was the
[1:29:21] people. It was the people. It was the
[1:29:23] pressure. It was the enemy. It was the
[1:29:25] enemy. And God is saying, but you had a
[1:29:27] choice.
[1:29:29] And in both situations,
[1:29:31] the action that was done was crafted in
[1:29:35] a way to make it spiritual. So in the
[1:29:38] first instance, he offered a sacrifice
[1:29:40] he should not have offered. And in the
[1:29:42] second situation, he say, well, I keep
[1:29:43] these things. I didn't obey because I
[1:29:46] wanted to make it spiritual and offer
[1:29:48] sacrifice to God. Many of us hide our
[1:29:51] foolishness behind spiritual
[1:29:52] descriptions.
[1:29:57] I'm doing this because I feel the Lord
[1:29:59] leading me this way. The Lord is leading
[1:30:00] you that way at all. Because the Lord
[1:30:02] leading you to follow the word.
[1:30:04] Hallelujah. The Lord is leading you to
[1:30:06] be obedient to the word against your
[1:30:09] feeling against your fear. I get it. I'm
[1:30:12] closing. I get it. Saul was afraid in
[1:30:14] the first situation. The people were
[1:30:16] trembling.
[1:30:17] The Bible said the Philistines were
[1:30:19] pressing them. They were under pressure.
[1:30:23] But true leadership
[1:30:25] is what shows up under pressure. Not
[1:30:28] because you have pressure or you have
[1:30:29] nerves or something going wrong. Do you
[1:30:31] break the word
[1:30:33] because the word is more than powerful
[1:30:36] enough to defeat any situation. There
[1:30:38] will be situation that will bring fear.
[1:30:40] That's why the word say fear not.
[1:30:42] There'll be situation where the prophet
[1:30:44] said he say I see you have a nervous
[1:30:46] condition. None of that is an excuse to
[1:30:49] go against the word.
[1:30:53] I hope this resonates in our hearts that
[1:30:56] we can get more aggressive
[1:30:59] in closing the gap about taking what the
[1:31:02] prophet said because this is the prophet
[1:31:05] Samuel
[1:31:07] we have the prophet in the form of books
[1:31:08] and tapes our prophet we can have
[1:31:11] personal conversation with the prophet
[1:31:13] you can put on the tape you can listen
[1:31:14] to the books you could read the books
[1:31:16] you and it's there for us to be able to
[1:31:18] look into the word because the whole
[1:31:20] objective of this prophecy to get us to
[1:31:22] leave here and for us to be part of the
[1:31:24] eternal kingdom. I trust this is a
[1:31:27] blessing to us tonight from young to old
[1:31:31] from seasoned to someone who has just
[1:31:33] come into the faith that we place more
[1:31:36] priority not just on the word but the
[1:31:40] obedience to the word and taking it
[1:31:42] under that umbrella of full obedience to
[1:31:45] the entire word of God will entitle you
[1:31:48] and I to the token. May the Lord richly
[1:31:51] bless you tonight. Before we close in
[1:31:54] prayer, I encourage you to make every
[1:31:56] effort to be in service this Sunday. Too
[1:32:00] many of us have excuses. Think the
[1:32:02] Sunday before I flew out to France, I
[1:32:04] said if you have a good excuse to miss
[1:32:07] Wednesday, still come.
[1:32:10] I want to encourage you. The Bible says
[1:32:12] as the day approaching, we should meet
[1:32:15] more often.
[1:32:18] Forsake not the assembling. Even as the
[1:32:20] day approaching, it's supposed to become
[1:32:22] more serious to us. That's part of the
[1:32:25] word to obey. Some of us take that
[1:32:27] casually.
[1:32:29] Church is a is a is a thing to do when I
[1:32:31] when I could make space for it. Whereas
[1:32:33] everything else should be subject to
[1:32:34] what God but but say put God first. Some
[1:32:38] of us can't see our way because we don't
[1:32:41] want to put God first in every aspect of
[1:32:43] your life. And you're you're fighting
[1:32:44] up. You're fighting why God and God is
[1:32:46] saying do my thing first. and watch the
[1:32:50] blessing unfold
[1:32:52] in your finances, in your life, in your
[1:32:54] marriage. Put God first. Acknowledge him
[1:32:57] first. Give him preeminence and watch
[1:33:00] the blessing of the Lord so much that
[1:33:02] you can't even receive it. So, I want to
[1:33:04] encourage you to make a extra effort and
[1:33:07] invite somebody. There are people who
[1:33:10] are not here in Bible study who supposed
[1:33:11] to be here tonight.
[1:33:15] We have to challenge one another. We
[1:33:17] have to push one another. We have to
[1:33:19] ensure that we do all we could do. But
[1:33:21] Abraham cried out, "I haven't done
[1:33:23] enough." It's got me scared.
[1:33:30] So I encourage you and also to remind
[1:33:32] you the last Sunday of this month, which
[1:33:35] is our Independence Day special service.
[1:33:39] And on that service, we will have an
[1:33:42] opportunity to pray for all of the
[1:33:44] children going back out to school. And
[1:33:46] this is not something I take lightly at
[1:33:48] all. The forces of hell are targeted.
[1:33:53] Brother said the lid of hell is
[1:33:55] uncovered.
[1:33:57] Demons have been loosed and these demons
[1:34:00] are hellbent not just on the world but
[1:34:03] on those who are swimming like the
[1:34:05] rainbow trout against the current.
[1:34:08] So we want to pray for our young
[1:34:10] children. We want to pray for our school
[1:34:11] teachers that are going out to school
[1:34:13] and to also use that service as a line
[1:34:15] in the sand, a demarcation into a new
[1:34:18] season, the new school year, the new
[1:34:20] period. A lot of stuff is transitioning
[1:34:22] on a economic level. We're going into
[1:34:24] September month budget period. All kind
[1:34:26] of stuff happening. We see warships
[1:34:28] coming down into the seas near to us.
[1:34:30] Time is short. Is there no games? If in
[1:34:32] a day or two Venezuela decide to send
[1:34:34] some rockets against the ship, what you
[1:34:36] going on a small island? I don't say we
[1:34:38] have no army already. Anybody volunteer
[1:34:40] to go and fight?
[1:34:42] Our 5,000 men, we say we we we we are
[1:34:45] peacekeeping force.
[1:34:47] Our men don't want to fight nothing.
[1:34:49] Peacekeeping force.
[1:34:51] Wars, rumors of wars. Well, it's no
[1:34:53] longer a rumor. Warships. Why are there
[1:34:55] warships in the Caribbean Sea?
[1:34:58] There will come a time because for us in
[1:35:00] the West who have not seen these things
[1:35:02] and bombs falling in Gaza and Israel, we
[1:35:04] treat things casually as if this thing
[1:35:07] would never come to us.
[1:35:10] is always something on the news only
[1:35:12] news. You read the papers but but but we
[1:35:14] are reaching a point where the islands
[1:35:16] will break.
[1:35:20] The world is heading into judgment. It's
[1:35:23] not a game
[1:35:25] I shared in France. Noah would have had
[1:35:27] friends.
[1:35:29] Noah went to school. The signs they had
[1:35:32] in that day we haven't touched that day.
[1:35:34] When Noah preached for 120 years, they
[1:35:36] didn't believe him. But God shut the
[1:35:38] door and when the rain fall because
[1:35:41] preaching for seven days to the eternal
[1:35:43] loss the ark was there people didn't
[1:35:45] take it but when the first drop of water
[1:35:48] dropped and they say wait now like Noah
[1:35:50] is right there would have been people
[1:35:52] say let me in Noah let me in and Noah
[1:35:55] had no influence no power he didn't
[1:35:57] close the door he couldn't open the door
[1:36:00] there's such a time when it is too late
[1:36:03] and I want to challenge the church the
[1:36:05] things we take for granted we take for
[1:36:07] easy. It is very evident that Saul end
[1:36:09] up taking the gifting, the anointing,
[1:36:11] the kingship, the throne for granted to
[1:36:14] reach a point where he even considered
[1:36:16] doing what he wanted to do
[1:36:18] in the way he wanted to do because
[1:36:20] something has to bring us to a point to
[1:36:22] assume authority we do not have.
[1:36:26] And that is why Jesus had to learn
[1:36:28] obedience by the things that he
[1:36:30] suffered.
[1:36:31] And we are doing our children a
[1:36:33] disservice by enabling them into
[1:36:35] foolishness when we should be preparing
[1:36:37] them for disappointment, for failure,
[1:36:39] for pain, for hurt, for suffering.
[1:36:41] Because the scripture said the suffering
[1:36:42] of this present time are not worthy to
[1:36:44] be compared with the glory. And we don't
[1:36:46] want to discipline. We don't want to
[1:36:47] teach. We don't want to tell them the
[1:36:48] truth because only the truth will set
[1:36:50] you free. We're not talking about being
[1:36:51] abusive or being hard. But there's a
[1:36:53] level of clarity that must come to us
[1:36:55] because the devil is moving about like a
[1:36:58] roaring lion seeking whom he will
[1:37:00] devour. He want to destroy your
[1:37:02] marriage, your home, your life, your
[1:37:04] mental state, mental health. All these
[1:37:07] things that are talked about in a
[1:37:09] psychological physiological realm is a
[1:37:11] spiritual world in which we deal with.
[1:37:14] If you are out of your mind, how you
[1:37:16] could even reconcile coming back to God.
[1:37:20] Bel, why are we so tossed about? Why is
[1:37:22] it so hard to live the Christian life?
[1:37:24] These are actual messages. You want to
[1:37:26] know why it hard to live the Christian
[1:37:27] life? Go listen to that tape.
[1:37:29] because you're dealing with a war,
[1:37:31] spiritual wickedness in high places, not
[1:37:34] targeting the entire world, but the end
[1:37:36] time bride. So, let's take it more
[1:37:38] seriously. Not let let it be a casual,
[1:37:40] well, who want it, want it. It's more
[1:37:42] than that. It's not who want it, want
[1:37:43] it. The promise is unto you and to your
[1:37:46] children. It's your inheritage. It is
[1:37:48] your inheritance. It's your heritage.
[1:37:50] You have a responsibility to fight for
[1:37:52] this thing, to make a church, to make a
[1:37:54] revival, to re-establish the altar in
[1:37:56] your home.
[1:37:59] So I want to encourage you make an
[1:38:01] effort that 31st Sunday is a public
[1:38:05] holiday effectively. It's depend
[1:38:07] independence day the day after is the
[1:38:08] holiday. So you really have to have a
[1:38:10] written excuse to miss that service cuz
[1:38:13] a public holiday line and then the
[1:38:15] government want to cancel the parade. So
[1:38:16] if he was looking for the parade but
[1:38:18] that gone
[1:38:21] to just make sure you can't miss it and
[1:38:23] then put a day of prayer on top of it
[1:38:28] to let you know that wherever we do it
[1:38:30] is a spiritual day. So I want to
[1:38:31] encourage you make every effort and on
[1:38:33] that day as you know we have a special
[1:38:35] thanksgiving service as well where the
[1:38:37] pastor has graciously put things in
[1:38:39] place to have a meal with the church so
[1:38:40] we can have fellowship and thanksgiving
[1:38:42] and we are looking for God to do
[1:38:43] something among the church among the
[1:38:45] believers among families among homes.
[1:38:48] God is looking to do something for you
[1:38:50] friends tonight. Let's bow our heads in
[1:38:51] a word of prayer. Oh gracious heavenly
[1:38:53] father we thank you for your love for
[1:38:54] your grace for your mercy for your word
[1:38:56] tonight. Lord, we pray that it found a
[1:39:00] good resting place in good ground
[1:39:02] tonight. We all have challenges, trials,
[1:39:05] situations, issues that come up, Lord,
[1:39:07] but there's provision in the word to
[1:39:09] deal with every one of these, Father.
[1:39:11] Lord, we see the life and times of men
[1:39:15] and women through scripture, Lord. Some
[1:39:18] started off good, ended up bad. Some
[1:39:20] started off bad, end up good. Lord Paul
[1:39:23] could say, "I've run the race, finished
[1:39:26] the course, kept the feet." That's what
[1:39:29] we want our testimony to say, that we
[1:39:31] have run our race.
[1:39:34] We have kept the fate. We have finished
[1:39:37] the course. We have done what you put us
[1:39:40] here to do. We don't want to start off
[1:39:42] good and end up bad. We don't want to
[1:39:44] start off strong and end up weak.
[1:39:47] We want to stay steady. He said the race
[1:39:49] is who endure to the end. Endurance is
[1:39:52] staying power.
[1:39:54] It's not a sprint we running.
[1:39:56] It's a marathon. Steady, steady, day
[1:40:00] after day. Read Bible, pray, meditate,
[1:40:04] shun the very appearance of evil. We
[1:40:06] want to be in the spirit. We want to be
[1:40:08] testifying every day. We thanking you,
[1:40:10] acknowledging you, reading the word,
[1:40:12] adding the virtues, walking through the
[1:40:15] trials. There are some trials you take
[1:40:17] us out of. There's others you want to us
[1:40:18] to go through to build our character.
