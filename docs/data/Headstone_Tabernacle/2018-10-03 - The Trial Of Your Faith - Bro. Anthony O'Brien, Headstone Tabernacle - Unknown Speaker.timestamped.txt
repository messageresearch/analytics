[37:36] the trial of your faith a many many men

[37:58] valuable we talk about having a big bank
[38:00] account

[39:48] are not drunk as you suppose this what
[39:51] you're hearing this noise that you're
[39:53] hearing this worship that you're hearing

[40:03] royal people a royal feed royal seed of
[40:07] Abraham they are here tonight you fought
[40:11] to death you fought to hell you fought

[40:16] trials but we made it tonight
[40:19] Oh somebody shout somebody praise God we
[40:24] are modern overcomers tonight because of
[40:27] he that limited us it's greater than our
[40:30] trial greater than all chests greater

[40:49] [Applause]
[40:50] [Music]
[41:04] gives us a reason to be happy to come to
[41:07] service excited because we are not
[41:10] expectation for quarters about - - we've
[41:14] been me intro for night but Troy comment
[41:17] in the morning the trial is not forever
[41:20] but the trial is only to prove what is
[41:24] inside of you but a Panem said why would
[41:28] God choose a prize in this evil age it
[41:32] is to try to prove to the devil to prove
[41:36] to Satan to prove to Lucifer that you
[41:40] are not like Eve - are not be deceived
[41:43] but you're gonna step out right in this
[41:46] scientific age right in this age of lot
[41:49] easier with all the internet and with
[41:52] all the cellphones and with every
[41:55] distraction there is right in this last
[41:57] thing God's gonna call up people for his
[42:01] name's sake say man God's gonna call our
[42:04] young people for his name's sake they
[42:08] will be filled with the Holy Ghost they
[42:10] will do great wonders signs and wonders
[42:13] and miracles and the pillar I'll go
[42:16] before them hallelujah I believe tonight
[42:19] glory to God glory to God oh that's why
[42:24] we came that's probably excited that's
[42:27] why you're not expectation hallelujah
[42:29] because we have a more sure word of
[42:31] prophecy we're not just expecting a
[42:34] little blessing we not just expecting a
[42:36] little sprinkle but we have a promise
[42:39] I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[42:42] and your sons and daughters shall
[42:45] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[42:48] young men shall see visions it's
[42:51] specific
[42:52] it's appointed it's anointed it's a more
[42:56] sure word of prophecy tonight
[42:59] but uh Nicholas you're gonna be totally
[43:01] respawn halle-loo you're gonna be a
[43:03] young man again you're gonna dance and
[43:06] shout and jump higher and you jump
[43:08] before people even 11 tonight
[43:27] are you on fire tonight praise God he
[43:31] may for the trial of your feet be more
[43:37] precious than gold you put so much
[43:42] emphasis on natural things people put so
[43:47] much emphasis on temporary stuff but
[43:53] your blessing or rather your your
[43:57] calling is not based upon these natural
[44:01] things but it's peace upon the call of
[44:04] God in your life it's not a natural
[44:07] thing it's not a temporal thing here at
[44:11] Columbine it is dead but he that is
[44:14] spiritually minded that is life and
[44:16] peace Oh hallelujah and he that walks
[44:19] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[44:22] of God then they are the sons of God so
[44:26] I know who I'm talking to tonight
[44:28] because he didn't come here because of
[44:30] natural things but there's a spiritual
[44:33] call in your heart a spiritual call in
[44:36] your life a spiritual call in your soul
[44:39] jesus said my sheep hear my voice a
[44:43] stranger's voice they will not follow we
[44:47] know what voice called us when we were
[44:50] in the world we know what voice call us
[44:53] when we were past live when we had no
[44:56] face when we felt like giving up but
[44:59] there was a voice that was calling us up
[45:01] here
[45:02] calling us
[45:04] calling us into the heavenlies that
[45:06] proves that you are son of god because
[45:09] the pride has the ability tonight to
[45:12] hear from car certain Irina hear from a
[45:16] man but when we pick up this Bible oh
[45:19] there's a voice that calls us for Homer
[45:22] when you read the scripture when the
[45:24] scripture is anointed to us
[45:26] that's Courts points calling us home
[45:30] calling you out of your situation come
[45:32] on out out of your circumstance out of
[45:36] this natural plane into a spiritual
[45:39] plane follow your trial become like
[45:41] nothing your testings are like nothing
[45:43] when you begin to lift your hands and
[45:46] even get to worship your God you begin
[45:49] to enter into an atmosphere that makes
[45:51] all these little things paint away cause
[45:54] he comes on everything he is all all in
[45:57] all he's a reason why shouts he's the
[46:01] reason why I came to church tonight I
[46:03] came for reality I came for deliverance
[46:06] that's what I need oh is that what you
[46:10] need tonight oh it's not what you came
[46:13] for
[46:13] it's not what your faith is hauling on
[46:16] to Oh
[46:19] your feet must rest
[46:21] on God's solid promise with a many man
[46:27] glory to God the trial of your feet it's
[46:35] not precious I can't get off that
[46:38] scripture of gold that perisheth and
[46:42] then are we going to talk about that
[46:44] goal seeing that do it be tried and fire
[46:49] it will be found unto praise and honor
[46:53] and the glory at the appearing of Jesus
[46:57] Christ
[46:58] Oh hallelujah hallelujah we behold him
[47:04] we become all like him hallelujah we
[47:08] behold in a glass the glory of the Lord
[47:10] we are being changed into that same
[47:13] image
[47:14] from glory to glory to glory even as by
[47:17] the Spirit of the law it is not man
[47:21] doing the work but every day you walk
[47:24] with God you get closer to God and he
[47:28] comes closer to you you're supposed to
[47:30] get into his image into his likeness
[47:33] become a resemble God begin to talk like
[47:37] God and the more of the world you give
[47:39] up but I Branham said that button of
[47:41] light that comes into your heart must
[47:44] expand and as you pull out the world
[47:49] something inside of you is pressing
[47:52] something inside of you is getting
[47:54] bigger it's getting bigger it's getting
[47:56] bigger you begin to push the world out
[47:59] come on we're gonna push hallelujah the
[48:01] delegates have out we're gonna push the
[48:04] demons out push out everything that's
[48:06] not like God and you begin to change and
[48:09] transform and transfigure why because
[48:14] the sea has the power to transform
[48:18] itself into whatever it's supposed to be
[48:21] so if it's a sea praise god of
[48:24] discrepancy it's gonna come to life in
[48:26] its own way but if it's a seed of God
[48:29] you better believe tonight that it's
[48:32] going to find its way home it's going to
[48:35] produce something something that looks
[48:39] just like its father and tonight if we
[48:42] be seeds of call predestinated by God
[48:45] and what are you going to produce you
[48:48] will produce the same life the same size
[48:51] the same wonders the same miracles the
[48:55] same things that Jesus said when he heal
[48:58] the sick you're gonna heal the sick too
[49:00] because as attributes was locked up in
[49:03] the seed it's gonna come to life
[49:06] [Music]
[49:08] Oh hallelujah those attributes come to
[49:15] life but it doesn't just happen
[49:18] overnight it's a process and that's what
[49:23] we want to talk about tonight the
[49:25] process that takes you from point A to
[49:28] point P is now we know that God has a
[49:34] desire and an expected end for us harlot
[49:39] is not Harlan is not when God foreknew
[49:43] you in his mind he had an image of what
[49:46] you are going to be when you come to
[49:49] your fullness when you come to your
[49:51] fruit when you come to your maturity
[49:54] when that seed and you go to taking on
[49:57] life and go to bearing fruits God has an
[50:00] actual picture of what that's supposed
[50:02] to look like and the devil always try to
[50:05] present his picture his picture is what
[50:08] you look like now what you feel like now
[50:10] what you're going through now what
[50:13] frustrates you now what easily besets
[50:16] you now but that will only is not that
[50:19] will not always be because that is not
[50:21] God's picture of you when God saw you in
[50:24] the beginning that picture of you was
[50:26] perfect that picture of you was seven
[50:29] perfect spirits God manifested himself
[50:32] right in your simplicity right in your
[50:36] humility God's gonna find a nesting
[50:39] ground in your heart in your soul in
[50:42] your life God's gonna go to school with
[50:45] you he's gonna go to work with you he's
[50:48] gonna go under chop with you and he's
[50:50] gonna live out the things that you used
[50:53] to do you won't do them no more because
[50:57] it will be caught working his way out
[50:59] out of your heart into your life oh
[51:06] that's what we want tonight
[51:10] for the world to see Jesus in us the
[51:20] eleventh anang trial ever feet so what's
[51:25] a trial a trial is a test
[51:30] somebody say test it's 5%
[51:35] somebody said test a trial is a test of
[51:40] the performance the qualities or the
[51:45] suitability of someone or something so
[51:51] before God could ever put somebody in
[51:54] power or before God could anoint
[51:57] somebody with power like he wants to
[52:00] he's got to first test that person test
[52:05] them on their performance oh he's got to
[52:08] test them on their qualities to see if
[52:11] they fit the description of the right
[52:14] kind of a son oh you're not hearing me
[52:17] tonight God has to test he has to put
[52:21] that person on trial to see if they
[52:24] really got what it takes to go all the
[52:27] way and you better believe tonight that
[52:31] the devil's caught some of you on a test
[52:32] to see if you really are who you say you
[52:35] are Oh hallelujah prey is allowed to
[52:42] ruin things and to turn things upside
[52:45] down to try to get you out of the
[52:47] atmosphere to try to stop you from
[52:49] calling the church tonight to try to
[52:51] stop you from being a Christian from
[52:54] trying to stop you from holding on but
[52:56] the devil is a liar tonight because

[54:31] what feels like a nun food for life
[54:34] what promise God's Word what he breeds
[54:37] over your souls are not what we are

[54:47] promise of strength Oh hallelujah ask

[55:13] it's a test of performance it's a test
[55:17] of the quality and it's a test us of the
[55:22] suitability of the individual or
[55:26] whatever it is that is being tested so
[55:32] before you could qualify hallelujah for
[55:35] this race you gotta be tested oh honey
[55:37] you gotta be proven you're gonna be
[55:40] tried by God hallelujah not by man
[55:44] hallelujah we're not talking about the
[55:46] trials we give ourselves now that's a
[55:49] different kind of trial I'm talking
[55:53] about a trial because you didn't pay a
[55:56] bill that's you not paying your bill
[55:59] that's not what I'm talking about ma I'm
[56:01] talking about when he said he could turn
[56:03] the church against you I'm talking about
[56:06] what a prophet said when he turned your
[56:08] neighbor against you he do this and he
[56:10] do that
[56:11] hallelujah threw him in a bed of
[56:14] sickness that's the kind of trial I'm
[56:16] talking about I'm talking about a trial
[56:18] and you're wearing when you feel like
[56:21] hope is gone and you can't feel anything
[56:24] you feel like you can't feel the
[56:27] anointing it's not right the Prophet
[56:30] went through those types of trials he
[56:32] went five years without the anointing
[56:34] lost his daughter lost his wife and God
[56:38] tried him this wing tried him back way
[56:41] is now you tried to reach up to a drop
[56:48] down you wanna hear nothing and still
[56:51] have to go on he was still God's prophet
[56:54] he was still God's Son
[56:57] he was still God's chosen one it didn't
[57:00] change that the dark skies are not a
[57:03] sign of course approval Oh
[57:06] somebody say man now hallelujah you're
[57:09] topless is not a sign of God's approval
[57:11] neither is a pride sighs skies a sign of
[57:15] his acceptance but his acceptance is
[57:18] when you accept you in the beloved when
[57:21] you are placed positionally in the party
[57:23] and you know who you are and who you are
[57:27] then you could go into the illness with
[57:31] confidence you could go into the desert
[57:33] with confidence knowing that if he is
[57:37] with me and if he is leading me I will
[57:41] need to be wearing neither will I faint
[57:43] at the promise of God oh but he is
[57:46] keeping me come on now
[57:48] he is anointing me come on now Oh
[57:51] hallelujah is keeping me Alleluia in my
[57:54] tri spell in my weary times so that's
[58:07] what makes a difference between genuine
[58:10] Christianity and people who just come to
[58:12] church for a show for a charm of a baton
[58:16] or maybe just to shake hands or to make
[58:19] people think that well everything's okay
[58:21] with me it's more than just that this is
[58:25] what really proves you now when that
[58:28] tryna scums in when the tax cars pull
[58:31] over how do you know who your God is Oh
[58:34] hallelujah hallelu in the chest car when
[58:38] the trial come to you know who God is in
[58:41] the test you have to know him in the
[58:44] chest you have to know him in the trial
[58:46] in order to stand
[58:48] you've got to got something that's more
[58:50] than go in your soul something that's
[58:54] more precious what is it a fate that's
[59:00] tried by fire
[59:02] a feat that's more precious than that of
[59:05] gold what is it it's also a person or an
[59:09] experience a trial talking about it's a
[59:12] person I experience our situation a
[59:16] situation that tests a person's
[59:19] endurance or forbearance isn't that
[59:22] right
[59:23] hallelujah and God permit trials called
[59:27] permit situations to come always
[59:30] hallelujah to try what is in us to try
[59:34] what is inside of us it is not a God
[59:36] hates us it is not a god hallelujah
[59:38] doesn't want to hear from us but he
[59:41] wants to see what you're going to do
[59:42] it's like a child you can't hold a
[59:45] child's hand all the time there's got to
[59:47] be a time when you let go of the hand
[59:49] and see what they will do and in that
[59:52] moment they mate might feel like they
[59:53] need a hand but God wants you to be
[59:56] independent God wants you to walk surely
[59:59] knowing that he is with you and he will
[1:00:02] not leave you or forsake you but you've
[1:00:04] got to have confidence in your call of
[1:00:07] God in your life that you could walk
[1:00:09] hallelujah praise in Jesus name when
[1:00:12] nobody's looking when nobody's watching

[1:08:58] header on him so I didn't really
[1:09:00] interfere with him because he got a
[1:09:03] protection barrier he got something
[1:09:05] keeping him in the midst of the trial
[1:09:07] something is keeping him blue a thousand
[1:09:10] fallen his left side ten thousand on his
[1:09:13] right he is not moved because he's got a
[1:09:16] hedge around him
[1:09:17] he's got a protection around him when
[1:09:20] you are God's child there's something
[1:09:22] special about you there's a special
[1:09:25] anointing that goes with you
[1:09:27] it's that same anointing that was with
[1:09:29] Caleb and he said it the Lord be with me
[1:09:32] I shall be able to try out the
[1:09:35] Philistines
[1:09:36] it's another spirit
[1:09:38] which you hallelujah that's
[1:09:40] overshadowing you that is protecting you
[1:09:43] that is keeping you from the table
[1:09:45] keeping you from all is harm from all
[1:09:48] his tricks you don't even know half of
[1:09:52] the things you escape but I was caught
[1:09:54] keeping you in your situation keeping
[1:09:58] you on the streets keeping you in the
[1:10:00] bank
[1:10:01] you almost got robbed you almost got
[1:10:04] killed you almost got the shrine but God
[1:10:07] mercy said no your blood was like a
[1:10:10] pumper pumping off the sin pumping off
[1:10:14] your failures bumping off your
[1:10:16] circumstance pumping off your situation
[1:10:19] pumping off things from affecting you
[1:10:26] [Music]
[1:10:34] it's okay to praise him it's okay to
[1:10:37] worship Him it's okay to bow down before
[1:10:40] his feet it's okay to thank him Oh in
[1:10:44] the good times giving thanks and the bad
[1:10:46] times to the sing oh devil said well you
[1:10:57] got a hedge
[1:10:58] God said fine I'll take away that hinge
[1:11:01] it's nice do anything you want you to
[1:11:04] him but don't take his life and I love
[1:11:08] that words because it means that a devil
[1:11:11] once he would have taken his life if he
[1:11:13] could have he would have taken his life
[1:11:15] if he had a chance then Joe would never
[1:11:17] have a testimony for God but God said to
[1:11:21] what you want try him this way try him
[1:11:24] that to him you could take his family
[1:11:26] take his loved ones take his money take
[1:11:28] his car take his house take his
[1:11:29] microwave but don't you take his life Oh
[1:11:32] hollow because in his life I will be
[1:11:34] proven in his life I'll be glorified
[1:11:37] right in his life hear what the people
[1:11:39] are gonna see poor boo they're called
[1:11:43] walking hard living Oh hallelujah
[1:11:46] louia hallelujah hey man what a job see
[1:11:53] though he slay me yet I trust him
[1:11:56] isn't that right Sam 105 19 says until
[1:12:01] that time that his wood came talking
[1:12:04] about Joseph it's not the word of the
[1:12:07] Lord
[1:12:07] tried him Oh hallelujah tried by what
[1:12:11] the word of the Lord the word that he
[1:12:13] had spoken to him since before he was
[1:12:17] not being tried by that very same word
[1:12:19] and God loves to set up the situation to
[1:12:23] make it look contrary to what he had
[1:12:25] spoken hallelujah and God who knows the
[1:12:28] end from the beginning Maps this whole
[1:12:30] thing out but where you are doesn't feel
[1:12:34] like what God said God said you're gonna
[1:12:36] be perfect
[1:12:37] God's ain't gonna be just like me he
[1:12:39] said you're gonna walk like me you're
[1:12:40] gonna talk like me
[1:12:41] the sick are gonna be here the dead are
[1:12:43] gonna be raised and your present
[1:12:45] situation may not heal like that but
[1:12:48] that has nothing to do with the word of
[1:12:50] God spoken it has nothing to do with the
[1:12:54] prophecy that has been spoken over your
[1:12:57] life
[1:12:58] Oh what God said concerning you Paul
[1:13:02] would perfect
[1:13:03] don't you worry tonight tonight take a
[1:13:06] hold of fate take a hold of God's
[1:13:09] promised word for your life Oh
[1:13:11] hallelujah
[1:13:12] God is able to bring to pass what he
[1:13:15] promised to bring to pass what he spoke
[1:13:20] hallelujah hallelujah but we know all
[1:13:23] things will work together for good to
[1:13:27] them that love God and to them who are
[1:13:30] called according to his purpose and if
[1:13:34] you know tonight that you are called
[1:13:36] not according to the purpose of man no
[1:13:39] forget about man forget about what
[1:13:41] people say but what did God say
[1:13:43] concerning your life Oh hallelujah what
[1:13:46] the cards say Oh hallelujah look to the
[1:13:49] promise of God forget about the world
[1:13:52] forget about the things of the world
[1:13:54] forget about what you feel but what it
[1:13:56] forget about what's going on
[1:13:58] oh it's not look to what God's promise
[1:14:02] were that's what faith is it's a
[1:14:11] substance of things hoped for and it's
[1:14:15] the evidence of things can't see that
[1:14:18] you can't see so faith is when you can't
[1:14:23] see it it's not based on the things you
[1:14:26] can see it's about the things you can't
[1:14:29] see
[1:14:29] so forget about what you see what about
[1:14:33] the things you can't see the Prophet
[1:14:35] Peter magical looking on to the unseen
[1:14:38] Oh Hannah is now right Oh hallelujah a
[1:14:42] little why Jesus said in the world will
[1:14:43] see me no more but you are gonna see me
[1:14:47] how can that be because God put
[1:14:50] something inside of your soul a reality
[1:14:53] a substance something that keeps you
[1:14:57] something that holds the reins despite
[1:15:00] the situation despite the trial despite
[1:15:04] what you're going through something
[1:15:06] inside your soul says so he slay me yet
[1:15:09] I trust him but I can't see a way out he
[1:15:14] doesn't give me more than I can bear
[1:15:16] Oh hallelujah he make a way of escape in
[1:15:20] every situation in every circumstance in
[1:15:23] every trial
[1:15:29] Maryna quote here from the Prophet I
[1:15:31] won't be longer with you on a message
[1:15:34] how can I overcome
[1:15:35] he said now we're expected to be tested
[1:15:39] isn't that right
[1:15:41] I'll say that again now we're expected
[1:15:45] to be tested oh praise God in many many
[1:15:49] men what a difference honey not the test
[1:15:53] is not a surprise but you got to expect
[1:15:55] it because your son of God you are
[1:15:58] special somebody your message Jesus
[1:16:00] Christ
[1:16:01] we can't just pass through here like
[1:16:03] praise God where nobody no no no the
[1:16:06] devil want to see if you like wheat
[1:16:10] but Jesus said I pray for you that your
[1:16:12] faith fail not or but the trial of your
[1:16:15] faith will produce a character will
[1:16:18] produce a bold that is more precious
[1:16:21] than gold that perishes but it's a
[1:16:24] spiritual goal oh it's a character the
[1:16:26] nature of Christ that gives you the
[1:16:29] ability to walk like Christ to talk like
[1:16:32] Christ to pray like Christ to forgive
[1:16:34] like Christ or hollow to achieve and to
[1:16:38] believe oh we expected to be tested he
[1:16:44] said that's a good lesson for my brother
[1:16:46] back there also say he that cometh to
[1:16:48] God must first be tested tested the
[1:16:53] Prophet said what with the word Oh
[1:16:57] that's God's test oh so we're not
[1:17:01] talking about self-made trials amen and
[1:17:04] the bad decisions that we make what
[1:17:06] we're talking about being tested by the
[1:17:07] word now holla the Holy Spirit led Jesus
[1:17:10] into the wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:17:13] devil
[1:17:14] Oh hallelujah that's different
[1:17:17] hallelujah that's when God Himself
[1:17:19] that's when the Tov come down to lead
[1:17:22] the Eagles through the wilderness or to
[1:17:25] the low places through the valleys Ojai
[1:17:28] but though he slay me
[1:17:30] yeah now trust them it's not about what
[1:17:32] you feel but it's a wall of patronage
[1:17:35] it's not about what you're going through
[1:17:37] no no but it's a wall of patronage Oh
[1:17:40] hallelujah the God that set your
[1:17:43] destination up he's gonna take you to it
[1:17:45] from glory to glory to glory doesn't
[1:17:49] matter what condition your family is in
[1:17:50] darkness terrorize the prophets that
[1:17:53] live or wrong all a little sink or float
[1:17:55] is now right let this life that is in
[1:17:57] Christ live in me Oh hallelujah help me
[1:18:01] to pray it out season until every one of
[1:18:04] these virtues are living in me is my
[1:18:07] prayer is that your prayer tonight is
[1:18:10] that your testimony tonight or I to pray
[1:18:13] it out she said to praise without
[1:18:15] ceasing the price without ceasing until
[1:18:18] God is living in your heart
[1:18:20] living in your life living in your soul
[1:18:28] what we realize now is that we've gone
[1:18:31] beyond talk now we've gone beyond
[1:18:34] shaking hands and join in church you've
[1:18:37] got to have a genuine reality it's got
[1:18:40] to be something real in your soul
[1:18:42] something vibrating on the inside that's
[1:18:45] what the bull could understand that's
[1:18:48] what the bees could understand it's got
[1:18:51] to be a living reality oh don't you
[1:18:54] worry I'm almost closing it's got to be
[1:18:56] a living presence in your soul I'll live
[1:18:59] and walk I live in talk a real Jesus
[1:19:04] Christ moving in your heart moving in
[1:19:07] your life that's what making the
[1:19:09] difference hallelujah baby fine repeat
[1:19:12] between everything else between John and
[1:19:14] church and then paint adds all that is
[1:19:17] fine but a prophet said let us go on to
[1:19:20] perfection there is something that we
[1:19:22] have to achieve and coming to church as
[1:19:25] part of it but that is not it
[1:19:28] that is not it that is not the
[1:19:30] destination no no no no cause
[1:19:32] destination is that we could become sons
[1:19:35] and daughters of God that's what the
[1:19:38] finished product is supposed to look
[1:19:40] like so church is only a process come on
[1:19:44] now
[1:19:44] church is only a journey but that's not
[1:19:47] the destination
[1:19:48] God's purpose God's intent was for his
[1:19:53] word to be put inside of you so that you
[1:19:56] could walk like him so that you could
[1:19:58] look like him so that you could defeat
[1:20:01] the devil in your wilderness honor with
[1:20:04] any tree while attacks the city I sell
[1:20:07] to the flesh but you can still overcome
[1:20:09] it is written it is written it is
[1:20:13] written you overcoming in your home

[1:20:34] it's always been about sons and
[1:20:37] daughters of God so that's why he gives
[1:20:40] you the Holy Ghost and places you in
[1:20:43] there
[1:20:44] and you are predestinated of birth from
[1:20:47] above tonight to place you into the body
[1:20:50] of Christ that's not going to come from
[1:20:53] a man but that's gonna come from the
[1:20:55] Holy Spirit itself it's gonna place you
[1:20:59] as a son and as a daughter of God and
[1:21:02] tunicate your corner and into the family

[1:23:43] God must be tested that only shows a
[1:23:47] true child then see must be tested he
[1:23:52] said when the test comes on he said you
[1:23:55] can't overcome unless there's a test
[1:23:58] gave to you oh yes the only way for you
[1:24:02] to overcome for you to prove that you

[1:24:26] he's never early he is always on time
[1:24:32] unless there's a test gift to you now
