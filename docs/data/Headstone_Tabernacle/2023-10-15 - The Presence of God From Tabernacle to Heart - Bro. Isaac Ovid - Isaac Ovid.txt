church says and the church says amen thank you musicians thank you brother Gideon thank you sister ingred for a wonderful atmosphere that paves a way for the Holy Ghost to move in the way that he wants to move so I'd like to greet one and all in the precious name of Jesus Christ and if you have your Bibles this morning would you turn with me to two portions of scripture this morning reading from Isaiah 6 I'm reading from Acts chapter 2 two familiar scriptures to connect small thought today for us by the grace of God reading from Isaiah 6 and reading from verse one in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord God of hosts and the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was full of smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken from the tongues from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this had touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I he am I send me and reading Acts chapter 2 and reading verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord this morning amen it's certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the Lord and we are so thankful for what God has done is doing and is about to do and we are so grateful for his grace for his love for his Mercy to be in the land of the living and to be able to participate in this move of God in this season that many long to have been here the prophet wanted to be here when you read through the scriptures to know that this is the greatest age the greatest time that you could ever live in this is the time that God had to reserve a special group of people to be in this age because not everybody was qualified to be here so even though you may not be qualified as brother Raymond Thompson said you have been chosen to be here in this move and it's a difficult time it's a rough time brother the Bram called it a rough time for the unbeliever but a great time for the believer so when men's hearts are feeling for fear and there are Wars and there are rumors of War Wars and there's pestilence and there's stress and there's strains and there's struggles going on God is getting a bride ready not man getting a bride ready but God is getting a bride ready his way he is the one doing the fixing he is the one doing the moving he's the one doing the shifting and the prophet taught us that the angel of the Lord is on the earth now fixing things around for the coming of the Lord while you sleeping he's fixing when you're in your job he is fixing he doesn't need to be reminded of his responsibility the angel of the Lord is on the earth now the prophet said fixing things in order for the coming of the Lord he doesn't need an alarm clock to know what he's supposed to do he is doing what he is supposed to do and as Sons and Daughters of God we have to know what we're supposed to do and do what we're supposed to do it's that simple can the church say amen God is a god of order he's a god of systems he's a god of putting things in place that there's no room for things to fall apart can the Church Say Amen from the very beginning with god he's a god of order there's no Department of I heard somebody say recently there's no Department of angels that get up to make sure the sun is moving God made the sun to move a certain way can the church say amen he doesn't have to wake up somebody say going move the Sun and no no no no no no no no no the sun moves because it's part of a system it's it's part of a solar system the the Earth moves as part of a system There's No Angel responsible for gravity when you throw a ball up he hits it down no God put a system it's a law that's there this law called gravity means whatever goes down is supposed to come up but there are ways to defy the laws because butam taught us whenever you lift your hands in the sanctuary you defy the laws of gravity and you could only do that because you are a creature that comes from time so you can defy the laws of time and oh you don't hear me this morning when Jesus came he defied every natural law because he came from a place that was not governed by the natural law can the church came and that's why he could take Five Loaves and two fishes and he could feed 5,000 that is not a natural law he broke the natural law and he multiplied and when God's Prophet was on the earth he did what Jesus didn't even do because Jesus Took Loaves and fish and multiplied but that little Prophet where there was no squirrel he said let there be a squirrel showing that a restored sun was on the earth as a type to us that we are walking into that restoration that he's a wave sheath the first of many to come meaning he is not just the only one but there would be more who would step up to the plate and take their position as sons of God Daughters of God despite the opposition despite what the enemy does despite the resistance despite the rejection despite what takes place on your job in your family it's down to an individual Affair of God speaking to individuals and calling them out and you've got to know that that law that work it inside of you is a law of the seed that must bring forth after it it's kind that seed cannot bring forth anything else but what it's programmed to do oh you don't hear me this morning even your natural body you're not actively thinking right now of how to breathe Hallelujah because if you have to think about it but Steven one day you might forget about it if you're doing something important you're not reminding breathe breathe breathe no your body has a system that takes care of breathing your body have a system that takes care of digestion there's a solar system there's an economic system there's a political system there's a financial system these are all systems systems of God and manmade systems uh trying to put things in place uh to distract God's elect from seeing what God is doing that's why the Bible said when it looks a certain way look up for your Redemption draw it n don't look to the left don't look to the right don't look down but look up because only God is coming from above only he is high high and lifted up and I saw the Lord high and lifted up his train fill the temple can the church say Amen so we are so happy to be called we are so happy to be chosen we are so happy to be identified not just with a prophet but the whole Plan of Redemption because the prophet was a player in the great Plan of Redemption so you are not just a message believer or a church goer you are called unto Redemption you are the called unto adoption but without this Prophet there'll be no way for there to be complete Redemption without this Prophet there would be no way for there to be complete oh come on now somebody preach back to me so we are so happy to be in the house of God and but over called me yesterday speaking about a wonderful time in India he had to preach four messages Mikey I'm young and I felt tired for him I said cannot be human strength and after he preached twice he told me I'm feeling good you see my voice feeling strong and that can be human strength Hallelujah like Caleb I'm just as strong as when I first started out been in a battle for a long time but the devil can't take my joy he can't take my worship Hallelujah if I lose my teeth I'll gum the devil can the church say Amen so he's about 10 and 1 half hours ahead of us and so we thank God for the Victory and the testimony and how many were blessed with the service last Sunday with brother yadel Thornell and yadel Tabernacle being here what a blessing what an encouragement and he called me during the week and it was such a wonderful anointing and an atmosphere and a presence and and God is doing things God is moving things around if it's up to man man wouldn't do what God wants to do you know but when God starts to do it it's undeniable when God is doing it and you have to trust that God will do things in your life he said all things work together for good it's not you doing it but it's he shifting things around and God had his his own timing he has his time he wants to bless you he has his time to deliver you he has his time when he stops you from doing certain things because he knows the trouble you're going to get into if you go down a certain road but when God is ready to bless you forget about it David said my cup run it over he laid out a table for me in the presence of my enemy I couldn't even stop him from laying out the table he laid out the table for me in the presence of my enemies that's what God does when he wants to do it and I'm telling you bride of Jesus Christ God one day will pull you aside and give you something the world know nothing about and it will speak for itself you won't have to tell tell nobody about it but they will take note that youve been with Jesus you could be 12 years old 20 years old or 100 years old it's undeniable when you have been with the Lord notice I didn't say been to church I said been with the Lord because it's impossible for you to be with the Lord and walk out the same way you came can the church say Amen oh I'm so glad he set me free are you glad he set you free are you under expectation to be transformed are you under expectation to be changed are you looking forward for the gray hair to go back black are you looking forward for the heart of the the surgeon to go in your heart and pull out the Stony heart and put his spirit inside it yeah listen you can't do it or no but he could do it are you ready to give him permission to operate this morning to take his Tony heart out and put his Spirit then he he said I'll put my spirit in there are you willing to take part of the operation because that's what we came a church for to not leave the same way that we came to not leave with the same problems or at the very least leave with the same perspective of the problem because there are some problems God allows you to keep you know for you to change your perspective about the problem because if you don't have certain problems God can't keep you humble oh you don't hear me this morning morning this is not the kind of preaching we like but God leaves us with TS in our flesh to keep us humble for us to know that it's him doing the work and it's not you doing the work and it's not your Holiness and it's not your grace and it's not your power but it's his grace it's his power it's his ability it's his Mercy it's his love it's he keeping you you can't keep yourself so we always allow something to stay in your life so he can say it's me carrying you through the fire some through the water come through the flood oh come on some through great trials but all come through the blood that's the gospel without an agenda that's the great Gospel of Jesus Christ he came to change he came to deliver he came to set you free not just free physically but free in your mind free in your soul free about who you are free about yourself free about your purpose in God not your purpose you think you have but your purpose in God you may be seated that's why the Bible says all things work together for good to them who are the called according to his purpose you want to do your own purpose and expect things to work out but God has his purpose so we come to church to find out Lord what is your purpose for my life simple but important because God is a god of order he's a god of systems he's a god of process he's a god of procedure he say all that the father has given me must come and every son that come has to be chasen every son that come has to be chastised every son that come has to be corrected he corrected Moses he corrected Elijah he corrected the prophet even Jesus had to learn obedience by the things that he so what are we complaining about he didn't say well because it's Jesus I'll give him a past I my only son no Jesus had to learn obedience so obedience wasn't a natural thing to Jesus he had to learn it you ever thought about what Jesus had to suffer to learn obedience Hallelujah but for God to say this is my beloved Son he had to pass the exam because not God given that kind of power to if you be it's only the ones who could obey that's we say full obedience come on you know the word now full obedience what entitles you to the Token because when you fully obey God God is obligated to give you it's a channel open up to you you obey the Lord in everything you obey his Commandments and watch God bless you can the church say [Applause] Amen so just Tes any temperature Hallelujah just seeing who in church this morning to see who come to hear from the Lord or is just a social fulfilling an expectation to be in church or it's more than that so I have a title this morning the presence of God from Tabernacle to Heart the presence of God from Tabernacle to Heart it's been a burden on my heart for some time and it's so interesting but over had been on this thought in different ways on in his presence you know and there was this book on his desk and some of you don't even know how things have to connect together and for a while this book there and then but the yadel came in last week when he saw the book he said but that book boy there's something but in his presence and then this week he called me say that in his presence and and I said but something speaking to me about a few weeks now but in his presence how much God loves for you to be in his presence and what happens to you when you're in his presence and the change that you go through in his presence can the church say amen and how God wanted to move his presence because his present justness operate in any kind of a way can the church say amen God exist existed alone we know the scripture bear with me this morning self-existent one eloh there was nobody to worship him so he created the angels to worship and that made him God because God by definition is the object of worship so because the Angels worship him now he is God but God longed for communion he longed for Fellowship he longed for the ability to be a father to be a Healer to be a way maker to be a restorer to be a deliverer to be a comfort to be a in the midst of the storm to be all of this but there was nobody to deliver can the church say amen and I want to share to you how powerful is thing with Redemption do you know that the Angels who fell from heaven can be redeemed there's no provision for the angels to be restored you know because the penalty of sin is death and death means eternally separated from God separated from God so that angel can't come from the fall who fell who fought in that that great water that was in Heaven until I I want to come back now you know you you you heard what I said a angel can't come and say take my back I make a mistake can the church say Amen D made a decision and the consequence of that is death there's no hope for Angels who fell from their first estate but sons of God have a different relationship with God and if you fall there's a way for you to come back to [Applause] godallah that's one of the reasons the Demonic forces are so upset because there's no hope for them you make a decision in the spiritual realm there's a permanent consequence even if the devil wanted to make amends he can't make amends CU there's no provision for him to make amends those angels cannot make amends but but sons who fall out of position can come back into position because God is a judge and because there's blood on the Judgment seat it makes it a Mercy Seat but that blood is Kinsman blood that blood is only for Kinsmen only for sons and daughters and that blood come the church same will never lose its power there's no blood for those angels but there's blood for you this morning there's blood for your son blood for your wife blood for your childrenall can the church say Amen there's Mercy for you hallu and God longed for a relationship so when he put man there in the Garden of Eden that perfect man walked around God loved to come down and his presence was in the Garden of Eden I'm going to share a few things with you this morning Hallelujah and in the cool of the evening God as it were found a place a GPS location with a conle for his presence there in the garden on every evening every evening brother George in the cool of the evening you can find his presence because that was a relationship he wanted Divine Fellowship as it were he wanted to dwell among his people he wanted his presence to be accessible no wonder David cried or take not thy present take me not away from your presence oh Lord create in me a clean heart renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from your presence how important presence wasu Adam and they when they fell they heard the voice of God so listen even when man fell his presence was still there relationship was broken but his presence was still there because they heard the voice walking unable the Bible said they hid from his presence Hallelujah when you go through Genesis even when Cain and Abel were commanded brother the K to bring sacrifice God's presence was still addressing Cain even though Cain was the son of the devil because the Bible said only after Cain killed Abel God drove him from the presence that's why you could be broken and in sin today and God still allows you to come into His presence hallelujah hallelujah as a means to bring Deliverance to you it's how you act in his presence that makes a difference so when Isaiah we read the scripture went into the presence of the Lord he recognize say who is me in his presence the prophet will go on in the message in his presence is when he had to recognize wait a minute there's some issues that I didn't realize I had but the more you come into His presence is the more playing the issues become friends you know we don't see our issues right in our minds we have a view of how the world sees us that's different from how the world sees us you know you ever see somebody but a punch walk in the street and ask them if they have a mirror at home because it couldn't be they didn't have a mirror because they thought they they had to have thought they left the home looking okay but when you see that person looking crazy you know I don't want to think they left the house like that thinking they were not looking good they left you home with a view that they were okay you say things and then somebody to tell you afterwards you know how you said it wasn't right maybe you meant something different by it but the way it came out was different from what you expressed is because it's very difficult for us to see ourselves because we are in ourselves it takes somebody outside of us for us to see what we are doing that's not right or it takes a perspective Through The Eyes of the word for example to say well that behavior is jealousy or is Envy or it's gossip or it's malice or it's something else so we talk about the the the the Prodigal Son the brother the brother was fine until his situation came to highlight there was an issue in his heart if the younger brother never came back and never went through that it would have never known what was in the older brother's heart are you with me this morning so in God's presence is a way for you to see but wait a minute something is wrong you know I've had young people say well I really don't Joy anymore you don't know why come into His presence come closer into his presence and the closer you come into His presence I can guarantee you you will find out why because you begin to see wait a minute from the word from the anointing and not praying and not crying and not seeking and not forgiving not holding all of God it's impossible for you to not come into his present and recognize there's something to change and that willingness to change has to come from you can the church say [Applause] Amen the presence of God but God's desire was not to be a presence in a garden God desire was always a Tabernacle his presence anybody with me but he couldn't do it there in the garden he couldn't do it there in Genesis because there was no way for him to do it because that tabernacling had to take a process can the church say Amen so God went from in the garden to when you look through scripture when the children of Israel left Egypt God was present the presence of God was with them how they knew he was with them he was a pillar of fire and a cloud you wake up in the morning you see the cloud you wake up in the night you see the pillar of Fire and you feel confident that the Lord is with me Caleb could say if the Lord is with me meaning if his presence is with me I'll be more than able to drive all the enemy God told Moses my presence will go before thee you know what it is to go into your job and his presence is with you you go into a meeting with your boss but you're not alone because his presence is there you go into the hospital room and the doctor is there but it's more important that his presence is there oh come on now you go to the car in the Maxi in the taxi for the meeting for the interview it doesn't matter what it is you're there but his presence is there what a joy to know that his presence is there [Applause] hall hallelujah and God long to be here he wants to be there he wants to be accessible he wants to be touched he wants to be contacted he wants to have communion with you can the church say Amen the great this desire of God to have fellowship and this process this journey as it were of God tabernacling himself you go through the scripture in Exodus God gave Moses instruction to build a tabernacle which was supposed to be the movable mechanism to move the presence of God because they were on the Move by the church so they have have a way to move with the cloud as it were and then put the pillar the the Ark of the Covenant and everything and there all of the instructions but that wasn't a permanent place for God to dwell and they had tremendous victories when they know the presence was there that's why when they had to cross over in into into the the the the the to go over Jericho that the ark had to go before them because that represented the presence of God going with them can the Church Say [Applause] Amen but God wasn't happy to be in a in a in a movable in a in a one day a day one day a day no no no no no God is looking for somewhere we could stay he could rest he could be comfortable to operate can the church say amen he wanted a presence of God to be to have a a place where he could be always there can the church say Amen anybody with me this morning we're going to get into a few things but we know through it through all the and all the stuff that happened with Moses and the Tabernacle and Through the Ages all through the judges and to the point where it reached to the Kings but abam said God always knew he wanted a king you know but man interrupted God's plan for a king he said the devil interrupted it and man looked around and said but all the other kingdoms have leaders why we don't get one and God have to tell Samuel they haven't rejected you they rejected me but God always knew he was going to have a king through the line of David but Saul stood there as it were until God finally have a better manall and while Saul is King David is learning to understand the presence of God Saul is there and an evil spirit come and when David come and play the H David is able to drive away the evil spirit and welcome the presence of God it's important that you know how to move in the presence of God do you know how to create an atmosphere in your home an atmosphere in your car one time the brandom said somebody spoke a Blue Streak into his car remember that talk about the present and the atmosphere and what's around you that's why always say you C be coming out of a prayer meeting and cuss somebody out because impossible to come from the presence of God and go into anger and go into because the presence has an effect on you when people walk to the prophet they will feel but said it's it's okay it's okay because they felt the presence oh come on now there was something around the prophet it was emanating from the inside so when you come close to him you would feel it he said that's okay that's just his anybody with me so there's coming a time brother George when he will walk and you walk the Cru and people just look at you and I don't know why they looking at you but what what they're feeling something different about you there's a presence that's pulsating from inside your soul you can't read it into there no no no no no it's come by an experience and a placing that God does something and he feels comfortable to step inside of there can the church say Amen come on now hallu so all through this David by the time David is King David in his heart David looking at this all these things they've been doing all they say this C be right and in his heart he have a bird I want to get a place I want to get a house of the Lord David was one in all the Psalms he said I was glad when they said unto me let's go to the house of the Lord he want a place that God could be present a place you could go and he could know that he is there can the church say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but God looked at David and said David there's too much blood on your hands and God picked David's son Solomon to build the temple Hallelujah give him wisdom Beyond his ears give him Wealth Beyond what he asked for give him whatever he needed to be able to perform the task give the prescription and the order and to get the right elements but most importantly the Bible says that when everything was in place the glory of the Lord the presence of the Lord filled the house and they all knew that the presence of the Lord was in that place Hallelujah this was now the fixed place where you know the glory was because the presence was there the high priest had to move a certain way because the presence was there you had to operate a certain way but all of this is a journey because God don't want to be Tabernacle in a physical building can the church say amen God don't want to be locked up in a physical building he can't have an effect in the building he wants to have an effect on lives can the church say Amen so what was a Tabernacle in the wilderness becomes a temple that Solomon build then we know about the whole Babylonian Invasion and the temple got destroyed and then through nemiah they restor the the temple and then Jesus comes in the earth and the Pharisees didn't realize who he he was because the temple the Tabernacle was not walking among them the presence the great presence that was there in the Garden of Eden that was housing the Tabernacle in the wilderness that was there when Solomon built the temple all of that was locked up in Jesus God and man come together and the temple was now moving and it was fixed at the same time can the church say Amen because his presence never left that Temple but that Temple could move that Temple could come to your house that Temple could meet you at the point of your need that Temple could walk to Blind [Applause] bmus that Temple could go to the temple and he didn't realize that the real Temple had come to the temple oh you don't hear me this morning friends there's no Temple or no Tabernacle without the presence of God but when Jesus was there all I was in God was locked up in Christ and he was that Temple oh come on now somebody say Amen Oh Glory to God the presence of God had moved from Tabernacle to heart so when Jesus stood there and said destroy this temple in three days they were so out of spirit they were looking at the physical Temple they didn't realize that the presence had been moving he had moved from In the Garden of Eden he had moved from pushing people out the garden he had moved into the wilderness to be a comfort for them in the trouble and the trials and the wars in the time of Solomon there was peace and stability when the Pres was Tabernacle in the temple all of this was signs and types pointing to what was to come but here was Jesus on the earth now bringing a new kind of Temple a new kind of Tabernacle that Paul and they would speak about don't you know that you are temples of the Holy Ghost don't you know that you are living Tabernacles don't you know that you are living temples God moving Dwelling [Applause] [Music] Place can the church say Amen somebody give God praise somebody worship Him hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah oh in First Kings 8:27 God said but will God in inde the dwell on the earth behold the Heaven and the heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee so God knew that the Earth can't hold his glory you know that's why when the power rise it'll be a short quick message that shake the whole nation this Earth can't take the power but these vessels these Tabernacles in here could handle the power all of God was locked up in Christ and he could handle the power and the Bride of Jesus Christ will handle the power Hallelujah can the church say Amen oh you are walking nuclear bomb you are walking weapon of Destruction demon powers will tremble when they see the power of God risen in the the presence of [Applause] God you may be seated friends do you realize it will not be you that they will fear you know it'll be the presence of God that's inside of you that's the what Mak the devil tremble Hallelujah when they saw the presence in Peter they knew who was speaking they were healing Peter's Shadow it had nothing to do with Peter it was the presence of God that was inside of Peter somebody give God praise somebody worship Him and one of these days there's a prophecy over you that the presence of God the Lord himself a portion of the Lord himself s will sit on the throne of your hearts oh your husband will see it your boss will see it your neighbor will see it your children will see it your bank account will see [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it you may be seated on the same boldness that Jesus could speak with he said destroy this Temple and ENT treat his are ra it back up again because he knew the present that was in him it's the same way you could walk boldly like Paul said death where's where's your thing grave where is your Victory he knew what was in him he say if we cast down this body another body waiting for me because I know what's working inside of me it's not an intellectual understanding but it's a presence of God that had no beginning that could have no ending his presence bring brings life his presence bring healing his presence brings Deliverance one time Aaron left his rod in the holy of holies the presence was in there brother Anthony and when he came back that Rod that was a dead Rod had sprouted and blossomed and brought forth fruit he left it by accident and accidentally it was transformed maybe you're here this morning by accident but in his presence you will accident oh you don't hear me this morning in in his presence mistakes get corrected in his presence doubt gets fixed in his presence unbelief cannot stand can the church say [Music] [Applause] Amen 1 Corinthians 3:16 know ye not that he are the temple of God that's individuals in other words God has seen it fit that the body these human Tabernacles are more important to him than the Tabernacle in the wilderness these Tabernacles in here this morning are more important to God than the temple that Solomon built with all the ornate carvings and all the materials these temples in this room are more important to God oh you don't hear me this [Applause] morning somebody give God praise [Applause] the presence of God from Tabernacle to heart it's a heart matter it's always a heart condition it's not an intellectual presence it's not an idea of a idea of God or have an understanding of God no no no no no no no no no it's a presence that's why the prophet would say we we are waiting on him he said you know what I'm waiting on the prophet understood that he could do nothing until he was here he said we're waiting on him and then he would say he is here he said now I take every Spirit under my control because his presence is here because when his presence is here no demon could stand that demon of female condition in his presence it's finished that demon of high blood pressure in his presence it's finished and I'm declaring to you this morning by the testimony of Jesus which is the spirit of Prophecy that the angel of the Lord his presence is here he has been here all along when the prophet left his presence did not leave his presence sits on the word waiting for sons of God with faith to reach into the word he said one day the right thing will be spoken the right thing will be done oh come on now and we could Dash into the presence of God hallelujah hallelujah Young Brother young sister do you feel his presence do you know he's real what are you going to do about it Isaiah today said war is me this was a prophet a great prophet he said I'm undone I thought my laces was tie but I recog my laces not tie I'm undone that's what undone mean stuff that was supposed to be in place that I thought was in place I didn't realize it was done in place but I'm in its presence and I'm seeing stuff that I didn't realize and that impact was the presence outside of Isaiah but the popular that wasn't the pillar of fire in his heart that was him coming into contact with presence and God wants to do more than that for us because only when Jesus came and opened the door for his presence to not just be on the outside or felt on the outside you could because you could feel his presence and his presence not be on the inside many people feel the presence and they go back and they do the same things because they didn't allow the presence to move from the outside to [Applause] in and what we really want to get is the presence to move outside to in so that it could control from inside to out because when the Holy Ghost moves on the inside and begin to control from the outside in then it's no longer you that's why Peter could say he didn't lie to me you lie to the Holy Ghost because you thought it was me brother Peter I preached last week but this Peter today is a different Peter he didn't lie to me you lie to the Holy Ghost because he has tabernacled himself you're coming to a temple and he he holies the holies is here and the angel of the Lord is on the throne and he's the one taking the questions and the answers he's dealing and heing the thought of the heart he know what you came in with he knows how you want to leave friends we're going back to that you know ananas and Safa they came to church thinking it was a temple headstone Tabernacle and didn't realize inside the temple was another Temple inside the Tabernacle was a temple called Peter there was a presence in the Tabernacle but inside of Peter inside of that Tabernacle was the Holy Ghost itself [Music] so we can call this the Tabernacle inside the Tabernacle the temple inside the temple is the thing in the thing the temple inside the temple inside they have a thing inside of it call the Holy Ghost the control tower he's the power that leads you to say things and do things that somebody don't want to do it you don't want to forgive in your heart to know but that Holy Ghost said you have to do it drop the art forgive your your brother go shake their hand go say I'm sorry even if you're right you apologize anyhow die die out of yourself die out of big self die out of Pride die out of good self die out of how holy you are die out to how you feel die out to how long in the message eat some Humble Pie and drink some water with that oh come on now somebody help me this [Applause] morning everybody feeling fine God want them to take complete control not partial control but take complete control and his presence friends could you take some more but the brandom speaks about losing the sensitivity or the sense of Consciousness or the sense of conscience he said that the still Small Voice the presence of God will speak to you and he said every time you ignore it the volume gets lower until you could reach a point where you can't hear it anymore the word teaches us that God doesn't send anybody to Hell God doesn't send any way to hell but the BAM said it this way he say you run all the red lights because God does every single thing possible to stop you from going to hell the Bible said God doesn't want anyone to be lost it is his desire that everyone be saved but he doesn't choose for us but the whole principle of predestination is based on for knowledge which knows what you will choose and God now writes his story based on your choice but it always comes on to your choice and the choice now to do what you need to do in his presence and that's why the but over and the service will always say come to church in the spirit come in the atmosphere don't wait for the song leader to put you in the atmosphere you have to come with your Revival because when you are in the spirit the spirit can now speak to you and deal with you and the word now could have a deeper impact and effect in you because you are now already open to receive and you're in his presence now God could say something to you to change your life not just for more information but to change your life because information don't change your life the world is to give you Faith to reach into the promise of God that's already given you know God not paying for the price now the price already paid for he already died he don't have to die again he already died but do you have the faith to reach into that already took place and say Lord I want my healing or know I want more Deliverance you already paid for it it's paid for I preached it before it's sitting on a shelf already paid for you know you don't need no money to get it just take the receipt and see I coming to get it or right the check is it's already paid for it don't require any payment your healing doesn't require payment your family being delivered doesn't require payment your adoption doesn't require payment it's already paid for anybody can go and say I I want my own

hallelujah hallelujah don't run from his presence but the pre about a man running from the presence of God about Jonah ran from the Pres presence think about that friends we trying to run into his presence I want to be in his presence Jonah ran from his presence Young Brother young sister stop running from his presence stop running into your own thing come on mama papa stop running from his presence listen God will hold up certain blessings for you until you come into His [Music] presence because he wants you your blessing to be connected to his presence there are things you praying for that God just saying are just waiting for them to come into my [Applause] presence God wants to bless you more than you want to receive it God wants to heal deliver restore and he just waiting for you to come in his [Music] presence you spend your time with people with family with friends with your work with the news with all of that stuff and God is saying when they come into my presence the whole design was because God didn't want to be alone and he looking for Fellowship that hasn't changed he wants you to come into His presence so he can have fellowship if you could understand that God wants to talk to you talk with you have Fellowship to you fellowship with you he said come unto me all ye who are heav Laden and I will give you rest just come into my presence God wants his family around him as a as the great father the great Shepherd he's saying come come come come don't stay away come come come come unto me come unto me my yoke is easy my burden is like just come just come just come come come come come into His presence come into His presence the musician get ready come into His presence this morning he is here he is [Applause] here the Bible said that King Uzziah died and brother brandom taught us that Isaiah was leaning on Uzziah Uzziah was a crutch for him a comfort for him it was a place where he feel he could have confided and maybe share things with and all these things Uzziah was taken time from Isaiah away from time and say could have spent in the presence of God and it was only when Uzziah died and Isaiah was left alone he found himself being pushed into presence Hallelujah I wonder how many things God needs to remove from around us so we could be driven in into his presence in his message in his presence I'm getting ready to wind down but the BAM said in Exodus 3 we finded Moses the great servant and prophet of God when he was in the back side of the desert that man was a holy man he had been born for a purpose don't you know that you're born for a purpose he was born from his mother's womb to be a prophet he had tried to get his education and do everything he could to deliver his people because he understood that he was to deliver his people but he understood it by a theological standpoint he understood it from the word and the scriptures and the message of the hour he was trained he was well scholar he could teach the Egyptian wisdom which was the most smartest people in the world he knewed all the ins and outs brother Bram said he know the scriptures from to Z that's why you hear Spirit tell me don't matter how long any message how much quotes you know he said Moses knew the scripture from A to Z Moses would be the one God would use to write the first five books of the Bible it'll be Moses was there among Transfiguration he's a critical piece of God's puzzle hallelu but all of his knowledge and his experience was nothing Hallelujah until he came into presence hallu hallu brother bam said he know it from an intellectual standpoint he was a great military man but one day on the backside of the desert when he come into the presence of God he jerked his shoes and fell to his feet knowing that he was on Holy Ground in other words before God could even speak with him he had acknowledge he was on Holy Ground he had to have respect he had to recognize that God was present he had to recognize he wasn't in his houseall he had to recognize it wasn't a a casual thing it wasn't now well I going to church thing no he was in presence he couldn't stand upon his feet when he come into the presence of God he fell to his face like Abraham did he could not even stand in the presence of [Music] God friends do you approach it with reverence do you approach it with respect it has nothing to do with me has nothing to do with man or no has to do with the presence of God ananas and saf approached Peter thinking it was Peter not realizing the season change right if they had realized a season changed it would have been different towards brother Peter and you don't know what day you walk into the church and the Deacon different the Usher different the musician different the technician different the minister different you'll see brother Anthony but it's not brother Anthony you'll see brother stepen but it's not brother Steven you'll see the pastor but it's not the pastor you'll see me but it's not going to be me because the Holy Ghost wants a tabernacle himself the presence went to Tabernacle himself you'll see your brother next to you and it's not your brother because it's the Holy Ghost itself be careful of what you say be careful of what you do this is not just a Ministry thing God wants a tabernacle himself in temples the temples in the temple the Tabernacles in the Tabernacle and that's why we fight in this church to create an atmosphere because the Bible say when the glory and the Praises go up the glory glory of God can come down this Glory can never come down without an atmosphere when the Praises go up the glory of God comes down it will never just walk into the room it's when the people begin to sing and worship and say holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come the Earth is filled with his glory when they begin to sing praises and they say there is none like you the oh Hallelujah he is worthy of the praise when you create that atmosphere God feels [Applause] comfortable and then the healings take place and then the Breakthrough takes place [Music] brother Bram said man in the presence of God realizes he's a sinner he said Adam recognized himself wrong Moses recognized himself wrong Israel recognized himself wrong Isaiah recognized himself wrong you cannot come into the presence and see you're right I am wrong this morning in his presence we are all wrong in his presence we all have things to fix in his presence all our issues get raised up not for you and me to see one another's issues but for him to address it

brother bam say I'd like to stop here a minute and say that to thing you might have got a DD PhD whatever you might be you might have went to church since you was a child you might have done all the religious acts there is but once in the presence of God you'll feel so little and no count oh God help me to feel little help me to feel like I'm a nobody help me to understand that I need help help me to understand that I need a breakthrough I may have come in feeling I'm okay God not looking at percentage you know he want to see you at zero Hallelujah he want to see you broken L he want you to say Lord I need you more Lord I'm wrong every good thing I've ever done is still wrong prise God Godus he said Paul realized that he was wrong and fell to the ground under the influence and the power and when he looked up and he seen the very God that he had been preaching against and thought he knew and seeing that he was wrong he fell from his feet to the ground because he was in the presence of God he had seen that Pillar of [Music] Fire he said we could come to church and talk and praise God and so forth but oh brother when we see him coming something will be different in our hearts we might think we do our religious Duty by going to church and paying our tithings we might think we keep the laws of the church and recite all the Creeds but once let us get a look at him at him the whole things change all the way around the Bible said that John felt as if he was a dead man bring us back to that kind of sincerity you knowall thank you Lord thank you Lord we see Isaiah the scripture you read Hallelujah the Great Mighty Prophet Hallelujah one of the greatest prophets there is in the Bible Isaiah was one of the Major Prophets but one day I'm reading the prophet's words he had been leaning upon the arm of Uzziah the great king and Uzziah had been taken from him and he was down he was a pretty good fellow he was a righteous man Isaiah saw Visions he was a prophet Isaiah preached the word he was a minister Isaiah was a holy man but one day standing in the temple he fell into a trans and he saw the glory of God he saw the angels with wings over their face Wings over their feet flying with wings crying holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty the prophet realized he was nothing whoo is me for I'm a man of unclean lips brother said a prophet a mightiest prophet of the Bible one of them I am a man with unclean lips and I dwell among people that unclean lips woe is me because I see the glory of God hallelujah and he said when the angel cried the post of the temple Shook Back and Forth that's what presence does you know the presence was shaking the building and when he comes in your heart he'll shake your life up brother not only is the post of the temple going to shake but the whole Heaven and Earth is going to shake when he comes again the mountains will flee and the Sea will fade away and scream it's going to be a terrible time I tell you sinner friend you better be checking it up [Music] now now Isaiah said woe is me I'm a man of unclean lips I dwell among unclean people now remember if such holy men and recognize themselves as sinners in the presence of God what will the Sinner and ungodly do at that day what will people do who sit in these meetings what will people do I say this morning who sit in a tabernacle today what will the people do that see in the power of God that heard a countdown on the word that seen God manifest himself and beyond a shadow of a doubt every scripture fulfill and will still try to make it to heaven without being born again and receive the Holy Ghost thank you you see what the prophet asking Hallelujah the Bible said if a righteous man be scarcely saved where will the sinner andung Godly appear
