[Music] Oh I like an attorney Bibles the Ephesians up24 Colossians chapter 1 and first corinthians chapter 12 first capture freedom reading Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 to 16 and it gives some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we hence what we no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the three of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make an increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love Colossians 1 reading verse 16 to 18 speaking about Jesus and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have oh sorry from 16 I'm sorry first Colossians 1:16 for by him all things created that in heaven and that an earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence and last krypter from 1st Corinthians chapter 12 wanna read verse 13 it says for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and I've been all me to drink into one spirit let us pray father God we thank you for your word and I pray a bit interpreter to the hearts of the people father God you know what your place upon me and I pray that you give it to me that I give it to them may blessed land confirm a word with signs wonders miracles and deliverances in Jesus name I ask it amen amen you may be seated praise God hallelujah and my inspiration is from Matthew 16 when Jesus asks the question who do men say either son of mine am and then he asks his own disciples who do you see that I am and Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus answered this is verse 17 of Matthew 16 and jesus answered and said unto Him blessed a dowse I'm about Jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say on the deed our Peter here we go and upon this rock I will build my church okay a backdrop but a Branham from a message called life the cars and that day will be shaped like an egg running back like this form here and it'll be controlled by some kind of power that won't even have to use the steering wheel at times just set up and it go like that see before the annihilate the annihilation you remember that that's on record a woman will take over woman will take over I've always said it will take overnighted States right here the worship of a woman from 17 week of Daniel now the 15 the Branham 9 into the tree had seven visions which he said must come to pass before Jesus come again he's talking about the fifth vision the sixth vision is the woman the seventh vision is when America was bombed up and smoke and so on listen to the fifth vision science will progress in such a way until they will make a car that will not have to be guided by a steering wheel and the cars will continue to be shaped like an egg until the consummation the untying I seen an American family going down the road in a broad way riding in a car with their backs turned towards where the wheel should be it looked like they were playing checkers of cars he says it's controlled by remote controlled by Rader they won't even have to have any steering wheel in it just set your dial like a dial your phone your car takes you right onto it a cataract or nothing no other kinds the magnets keep the rest of them away from you see they got it I predicted this 30 years before it happened and the reason I'm reading this because this week passed about four years ago Google who have been working on driverless cars cars that you don't need to drive and so on they just released a prototype and they have demoed it it's just like an egg just like the Prophet said just cook like that gonna eat and they said it's like that shapes so it have no blind spots and they dismiss the steering wheels they say they don't need any steering wheel they no pedal they don't need no brakes you just because they be computer and the the reader whatever and so on will control the whole thing now Google I've been doing this for a couple of years now and they have a car chalked up 700 thousand miles without one accident the caucus stuff for the red lights move on a child's are wrong all the sensor that there in other words you don't need to drive it and it's safe and and human beings who look em in the road and so on I'm seeing this because butter Brandon said this is going to be before the consummation or before the annihilation it's already here they don't need a steering wheel and I saw it the person was driving it that a blind person or somebody else and it just pressed it just one up the press you set where you go in the press and they say your phone will build a quality car bring the car to use is impressive what the Prophet says is kind of mind-blowing so I said I'll drop that in you and this is what the new said if you're an uneasy of the this is just what to treaties ago at the idea of rising in a vehicle that drives itself just wait till you see Google's new car it has no gas pedal no brake no steering wheel google has demonstrated its driverless technology for several years by retrofitting Toyota's Lexus is another cars with cameras and sensors but now for the first time the company has unveiled a prototype of its own cute little car that looked like a cross between a Volkswagen Beetle and a golf cart they won't have any steering wheel accelerator pedal or brake pedal because they don't need them Google said in the black spot unlike previous models these cars won't have human drivers monitoring them all the time Google said the cars can detect objects up to 200 yards away in all directions adjust your speed tune and brikene accordingly no driver no brakes so God sent the Prophet and it doesn't matter how long it takes to come to pass whatever that prophet said it's gonna come to pass because the Prophet goes up in the spirit goes into the future comes back and ball does see at the Lord he's not tell you what's not gonna happen he's telling you what already happened because he sees my vision brings God got to come to pass and that prophet said I believe the bride is called you already see you call I believe is sealed into the team of God you already see you sealed or Chloe God how many believe that this morning hallelujah praise God that means that you are gonna be delivered all glory to glory man hallelujah separation I will build my church the rebuilding of the church by the spirit in the last days but a Brannon preen their God one by one we are called one by one we have to meet the challenge to walk down to the valley of the shadow of death is due to every one of us as mortals but tonight you have offered us your petition that if we will believe on him and be baptized in his name you would take us in then in this body the body of Christ not in church but in the body of Christ that body has already been judged it will not have to come to judgment God poured out his wrath upon that body and that body is free from sin and being in him puts us free from sin by his atonement that died for us and in dear we have fellowship one with another while the blood of Jesus Christ God's Son keeps us clean from all sin and judgment God at this little altar of every heart present here and around the nation may the waters from the altar of god gosh down upon this long upon your church and water it Lord for the season just about finish give it life the waters of life that it might be able to lay in the presence of the Sun to be ripened for your great gana father I pray for them but the stalk must dry so I cannot pray for it it must die so it is dead but I pray for the replied that's forming into the body of Christ Clawd grant that the fresh waters of God will keep its cheek bade with tears of joy and understanding until the combined comes to take it home in Jesus name I commit to you the results is yours amen and amen oh what a prayer for this talk he can't pray for the shock but he could pray for you the seed that the water will gush upon you as the body of Christ is being formed you mean a budget crisis being formed yes Oh hallelujah choosing a bride but a man army and we find out what she said now notice a nun in the Catholic Church that woman to become a nun I'll be going good it takes alas veal she's absolutely solo to that church soul buddy spirit property of that church she has no mind of her own she can't have when she takes that last wheel no mind of her own no will of all you see oh sit and make them book us the true Church of Christ the bride is so so loud to him and his promised word till the very mind that was in crisis in you that's how the bride after being oh praise God we find out today that the modern church modern world Church the modern world Church and also the spiritual church are both pregnant 'add to give birth the sons are you with me we going somewhere this morning Oh hallelujah praise God so they are pregnant both churches one of them is a denomination of birth it's gonna give one of these dears the World Council of Churches and we produced the Antichrist true denomination that's exactly the truth I may not live to see it I believe I will but you young people remember that you heard a minister say that it will finally wine up that the mark of the beast renergie forms that were conferences she will give birth to her son the Antichrist the other by the Word of God will bring forth the body the finish body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that Oh hallelujah glory to God shake at the title now please caught the body of Christ his church his bride hallelujah important to bring forth that body or get the Lord some praise his people how many knows that he said a man and a woman is one oh here we go Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes one body again oh man like Adam was at the beginning man and his wife a one know she the true bride so so loud to him she used on my never own his man of course is his will and his will is his word oke praise the Lord hallelujah so but abandoned weapons he said no the message is to bring the word Malachi for bring the people back to the world watch a bill is to be she is to be delivered of a new bird according to Malachi for in the church well today there are two systems working not three not four not five just two is either quarter than ever and time in between and I'm not in-between man it's caught on one side and the devil on the other side I look at the devil holds the Bible and way up I praise God God is the word and the telus anything although the word come on say Amen somebody there is no in between Jemmy Church there is no in between Oh get a lot some glory hallelujah hallelujah I really desperate is some hell when when Paul would say I want you to put her in line and put away this he was not talking to unbelievers it's just people's talking to let him that see stole no more do this do that it's not unbelievers he talking to it's church people we talking to Oh hallelujah many rebuking is that unbelievable because he began church people oh come on just watch me somebody [Applause] knowledge we all know it listen I want you to get this it's the Word of God and denominational system there are two systems at work Esau and Jacob one after the spirit and the other after the flesh and they are fighting one another it's been so denominational and the word and then he said now it's always been that way and the reason they're bearing birth pains because as I fighting her there's Esau a man of the world verily just good fellow clean moral but he don't know nothing about the birthright he's born at me and Jacob I don't care what he is what he wants the built right he's the spiritual one and true today is in the womb of the church that's the great big system trying to be formed called the work on the churches and from the world that Jill is coming for two children the word here we go must deliver the word bright church come on baby come on baby come on [Applause] [Music] [Applause] baby's not coming you're not pregnant but their various trouble I'll be waiting a long time there they know him a long time [Applause] Oh hallelujah hallelujah let's go here we go damn that fell asleep in all ages we'll make up that bride that come out on the word that they come to put that they come out on your feet coming out to your head she gets greater the more you have as the body grows up so the body of Christ grows up and then finally the head will come to it and it's all linked to the head the head does the pulling so what I want to say to you today is this where I'm standing on this platform let's put this platform as the top of brotherly kindness there that means we are on the top of the ages that means the majority of bride that makes up the body is already called come on oh come on oh god is not know getting a list and so better start to make up the body this is finishing the body this is finishing of the seventh seal this is finishing he promised together all things and Christ in heaven at an act so let's look at it now the majority of the brain is below it was so bad that God allow the Prophet to put a little light to represent the bright and last is Christ is the head let's say this is the head coming down here now so the head is coming down we are in between which will put us in the rainbow the holy spirits lot with the head coming down and bright below the majority of them then we have to be stones called out to be fitted and when around setting this way to make the headstone that he could come into it make him dead below without us the can be perfect because we complete [Applause] Loreena God hallelujah hallelujah my god Oh glory to God when I begin to see this in the spirit realm when I began to see the magnitude of what God was doing all along how he called the Jews as a people and he came unto his own his own receiving not so he had to turn from the Jews and code to the Gentiles and Paul was an apostle to the Gentiles and he said across Britain to the partition between the Jews and the Gentiles and now by one Spirit we are baptized into one body the body of Christ his church [Applause] when I'm talking about the wheat Taco Bell the same boat in the same for you water by the same water same sunlight one is the word one is not the word under two a-fightin there have been fighting since the first traffic Reformation they are still fighting there we are there you are what system are you in Oh hallelujah or glory to God just imagine now if you would have lived back in the other day under the joltin of God's prophets and woods that comfort what side would you want to be on back there you got the same choice today she is fixed in to bring forth the perfect word back there and the word is coming for a word bride and as a woman is part of a man taking from him so the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of the Bible not systems not dogmas no watch they build so many systems around the word until then the Prophet come it shakes them notice whenever God comes on the scene it rocks the system because [Applause] from God God given vision God given purpose God give him a son because he hear from God [Applause] gonna be season no watch so when the Prophet come share birth pains what was it back to the word back to the life systems doesn't have a life it's only God's would have life systems are built around it it doesn't have life so if the system say everybody else falls on unit system then you see everybody as force is a system say everybody blue then you see everybody blue because the system said that but what does the word say then people who in the system have questions about the word but the bride have no questions because as a husband who made the reveal world once the world is revealed that's your husband don't wanna kiss him they want to hug him you want to hold him because that is your husband come on Sam and somebody Oh give the Lord some bull ring get the lights on bro [Applause] so watch came on his own rejected go to the Gentiles what sitting up in his last day we don't raise up the tree with all eyes talented or knock what they do they kick out Christ he's outside he said any man hear my voice not church now individuals Oh glory to God Oh hallelujah we're gonna deal with that in the evening service if any man hear my voice and open up I'm gonna minister to him what Chloe did what he will open his mouth to the escaped ones [Applause] why why why because gonna come a famine in the last days for the hearing of the word of God then cor go to speak tyreq from God living here direct from God formal openness mouth Judy escape ones not to deceive ones no no escape ones escape the reception Oh hallelujah her glory they're gone so therefore systems are built along the life but only the word that give life watch something a little group will come out and believe in north time there's eight people caught Rock the remnant and destroy the rest of them to Rockaway but a banner preached a message qualified definite definite identifications of the true Church of the Living God and when God Oh pops certain things for me I didn't know it was spoken so it was a real excitement to find where the prophets pocket Oh glory to God listen to brother Branham he said the word church and in this is I want to speak to you what is the church who set it up what is this message how do we become a member of it and can we get the heaven without being a member of it and that's how we approach this message and we just go along now the first place the word church itself means they called out now Israel was not the church as long as they were in Egypt they were the people of God but when God call them out of Egypt they become the Church of God so God was always interested and having Church in his program of vision of church because they would have called out now that still remains the same today the word church means called out ones those that are be called out separated made different not only Old Testament the church was known as the kingdom of God I love that Saul as king and David as king and kingdom means king over domain that's like a kingdom king ruling in the domain king was the head the people were under him when it switch to the church Christ is the king and he is the head of the body the church but in the church he become the cap to you the pyramid come on out then the bride becomes his body are you with me so the bride is not just a bride the bride is not just sales people the bride is the body of Christ my my mind and that body is a mystery that body that we appreciate about today is a mystery let's continue now watch in the Old Testament a church was called the kingdom of God I'm talking from the chronology of the Bible Old Testament the church was called the kingdom of God in other words God is a king the church's domain and in the New Testament it is called a Masonic Empire he say like that Masonic in in other words where the Messiah rules and reigns no denominational barriers or nothing the Messiah rules in his Empire is not wonderful the Masonic Empire therefore the church here we go is not an organization let's go down deeper now the church is not a gardener people the church is the people of God that's been called out of the world to serve in another Kingdom Oh hallelujah this centrist member scattered to serve well in another Kingdom that's why Jesus said My Kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world my nan would cite for me but my kingdom is not of this world forget the loss of glory take the loss on praises people and we belong to that techni Booya hallelujah hallelujah my God my God and I travel around the world I find every nation has its own spirit all nations are controlled by the devil all governments are ruled by the devil pick anyone I want to repeat that all nations are controlled by the devil all governments are ruled by the devil the Bible said so they fight the war and they will tell Jesus come as one King demon who inside the station fight a Mexican demon and the next nation and they fight his demons having their own show that has nothing to our kingdom [Applause] oh right now Russia making a move and China making a move I'm Japan seeing this I'm not Korea China service and we are ears on the whole dirt what are you saying you are possesses a thin sheet and unsealed what are you saying you are called the possessive case of the enemy what are you saying you are called to be all over come on what are you saying [Applause] let's go when you're going to Germany you find a German spirit you're going to England you find the English spirit you're going to Sweden you find a Sweden spirit spirit spirit you went to France you find a friend spirit you come to America you finally make this right but when you're born of the heavenly spirit yeah spirit is no more come on now no more American no more German no more Swedish no more French is by one by one spirit hi Santa one buddy there is one Lord there is one face there is one baptism and there is one body the church his bride that's a mystery are you in the church I am front are you in the Savior's bride come and be baptized into the body Oh hallelujah hallelujah many thought that they were in the body tell the Holy Ghost she's had a feeling right in front of me I see your side of fiddling I see the kingdom I see the people who every nation every tongue every people baptized into the body no man could control let's not go there Torrio better control Church buddy that woman that sees this woman Jesus prize that's Jesus Church Oh hallelujah she won't be manhandled Oh hallelujah watch they are born of a heavenly spirit their spirit is no more Americanized it's no more germanized it is heavenly lized but I'm saying that the new word it is heavenly lies for the kingdom of God because we had another Kingdom a kingdom of God where decency holiness and power exists we have access to our King we have an interview with him whenever you want to call upon him we have no other intercessors no other mediator between the king and us but one man Christ Jesus so we are living in a kingdom it is called the Messiah kingdom in other words where the Messiah rules in every life in his Dominion ruling the lives of his people a call or people in every walk of life gather em together in a group that he calls it his church his called out ones it's a beautiful thing so Israel was the people of God until they were called the Church of God isn't that right and now the Church of God today is the same thing called out of everything of the world called out of a religious cult called out of every religious denomination calling of every religious organization to walk with God not being governed by a bishop but being gone by Christ in this Messiah kingdom that we live in Christ is the king now Christ here we go is the head of this so when I don't want headquarters you know we're talking about Nora he's he head in headquarters Christ is the head of this Christ is the head of this Messiah Kingdom and you cannot organize a kingdom of which Christ is the head I want to help you in on that you cannot organize a kingdom on which Christ is the head you cannot denominator Kingdom which Christ is the head because Christ is king and you cannot take the intellectuals of man and make an organization to which Christ will come on he is not a CEO he is not a CFO he is the king of his domain of his kingdom even the massage Empire or we shall call him king of khang oh [Applause] you are free this morning my card you're free this morning I feel the freedom in here this morning Oh glory no thought is a great pain to be free no change finding you nobody holding you down nobody holding you back we have no enemies on the outside no church keeping us back let's go huh therefore you cannot take the intellect of a man and make an organization to which Christ will govern therefore here we go butter brown any companies any people's any groups of men that tries to organize the kingdom of God is going contrary to the king if they're going to control you the king it will be against the king and if it's against the king it would be Antichrist [Music] [Applause] what about it that's pretty rough if I had a little more voice we would make that player it is Antichrist or Antichrist I wanna say it it's the same thing oh don't we give the Lord some praise it and if you'll be able to me a few minutes I prove it now we talk about two boots right one is the word I want to analyze spirit true organization no organization the spirit but a Birnam an antichrist spirit tries to take the people and call them from organization to organization organizing them together which never was the will of God now people had always fuss at me because I struck so hard at organizations it isn't the people in there I am striking at it's the dominating spirit that makes the people think that we are the people [Applause] the people think that but there's a mystery of the body of Christ that they miss completely because you do join that you are baptized into that so people that put you out of the company out of their churches out of their circles but they can't put you out of the party but random God's people is a caller people I believe they're in every denomination they could be Catholic they could be put Testament there could be Jewish there could be any kind of church but the real church here we go is the mystical body of Jesus Christ we kept them down into business Oh hallelujah upon this rock that's why we are standing because God has given us a rock a revelation [Applause] hallelujah hallelu go go in a god Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah pizza salad from heaven you may be seated that's the problem right there people he ran from men because yeah and what this brother say without minister say that one on tape sale this man a convention say that's caring men but when you hear from heaven Jesus happy the flesh and blood flesh and blood what you heard didn't come from flesh and blood what would reveal was run flesh and blood leprosy listen to you my father heaven [Applause] maybe Caesar woman with a bloody shoe Ischia take on a husband she never went to Jesus they shall take on their associates a friend's party friends mitten and so in France we shall take them or her cake cake making friends if you take them on she was gonna go to Jesus because he's super sweet in the money right now this money some of you your money to run out praise God you're stuck up and puff up because we think lead in your pocket praise God hallelujah it's ringing some toys knocking inside your pocket and have you been someone godly pride but when that money ran out she knew she had lost her then don't oh and get on different to get what she had beat up and when you are stripped of your pride trip of your envy and jealousy shift of who you think you are you are ready for God to minister to you you are ready for something to make upon your life some of you needs a break up inside of here somebody to get out there yourself get a ashell give your God some glory [Applause] be seated you cannot organize the mystical body of Christ you are member of that body when you are brought and baptized into this mystical body it's not Methodist it's not Baptists it's not Pentecostal it's not Nazarene pelorus not Catholic but the body of Christ we'll pick it up a little he said now watch the body of Christ is the church now he liked knit in many parables like husband and wife he calls the church the bride and the bride is no longer the bride was no longer two people there one she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and then when a man a woman is called to the mystical body of Christ by the Holy Spirit I love how he placed these words I'll say it again when a man a woman is called and I trust that this service will give you a burden a hunger to be in that body to be into his church would have nice Pentecostal church nice message Church my all kind of nice churches fine people go there but that's not the real surgeon that's not the church that will erase you have to get into him that body is already judged so you've been in him God there's no judgement for you because we already take judgment for you you are free in Christ you're delivered in Christ oh you are fine in Christ the work is finished for you in Christ you have a rest in Christ crisis of victories or salvation peace or joy hey man Oh hallelujah then I should love him serve him with all your heart now watch he said know when I'm on a woman is called to the mystical body of Christ by the Holy Spirit they become a full member of his body when they are filled with the Holy Ghost cause God took they spread out of Christ raise up his body place it on his throne and send back listen the Holy Spirit to make up the mystical body of Christ which were united at the marriage supper at the coming of the Lord you cannot organize it and here we go it is a mystery so how you go overnight a mystery how you go raining a mystery you're looking at the mystery behind you look at some issues around you I caught you I caught you you thought I'm the oil industry here you have

much I tell her secrets she get next to you and love you and everything you know it is that's what God Christ is doing the church he is letting her know the secrets just the secrets not these flutters I mean it's wife by having the revelation of a secret memo to them by His grace how the grace of God comes to God's people and Paul said in the last days there shall be people heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God choose breakers false accusers and continent despisers of those that are good heady highminded having a form of godliness led away by divers lust never able to

member of a nice of an organization I'm a member by the grease and the body of Christ I'm your brother I have no selfish motives my motive to achieve anything personally I am only zealous for the Lord God and I see this with all my heart the very thing that you were called out of you have gone back into it again as the so good a while on a daughter dances from it the vomit made a dog sick in the first place why if organization and creeds has got the people so burned up and God has quality they're free people and your turn right back is a sin to you notice somewhat Sampson had him doing tricks to entertain them that's just about the way it is he says it got instead of the holy spirit and when someone raises up and gets arrogant the Holy Spirit is obligated to God to shut that thing up oh praise the name of the Lord they can't be original if watch is it that's the way the churches can't be let one church get something not in the city the other just can't stand it until they get it they're not original anymore God word is original it's the word it has to bring for its kind it's kind in its season how do we get into this church by one spirit we all baptized into one body oh my soul would cry hallelujah to God oh praise God him when I think that God puts in his tooth the best that he can find God takes his children and test them with acid tests then he places them into the body of Christ because they are tested come on I expect you to run that one hallelujah that's the plumb-line acid test he said they believed they went to trials they had the experience there are witnesses of his they know what they're talking about not just intellectual conception but I've been born again of the precious Holy Spirit and time tested and tried until their souls up like flint towards Calvary yes that time tested they are witness on his power or glory in the last day revelation of seven seals revelation 6 in the last day revelation we find out loudest and the last messenger during the time of his prophecy the seven seals will be open the seven mysteries the seven for mysteries we left off to every age and so forth but we are promised according to revelation 10 Malachi 4 that there will come an Ephesians to this what does it means you're gonna come to one Lord one faith one baptism one body when you see that buddy you're gonna want to be after that buddy being here in the church is nothing what if the main thing is to be in the body this church here is to get that you could get the word that's something to come upon your life that you could dig a desperate as the Lord baptized my soul put me into heavenly places hallelujah let the white light pass through my bill leave a portion of yourself in me fill me with your spirit Oh glory to God amen so Ephesians is not the local church Ephesians is the bride body international Oh hallelujah the fight for ministry is not just a local church the faithful ministry is for international it's for the bride body the bride body not churches not conventions the bride body or the body of Christ focus the loss on praises people Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory hallelujah amen but a Branham almost through a screen rounded but about Christ michigo reveal Christ is revealed as a little world if anybody misinterpret Jesus Christ in the Bible of not being God himself making the second person he says that this will upset every word in the entire Bible it may break the first commandment thou shalt have no other God before me he said no watch for Jesus himself is the interpretation of the Bible and he is made manifest in the age that the part of his body is being made manifest so even though he's the word we have to connect with what part of the body is being manifested because the feet and the legs and the chest was already taken up we come like the neck part and he is the head part and all the rest of the body is underground written for the voice of the resurrection even the Trump to call them from the dead but I say that the voice of the Archangel which is promised to come upon the brain which will bring on the intelligence to bring us to a place well you could see it because you have to see it before you process it come on say him and somebody you have to see it before your possess it in other words you may be seated they didn't have the full seat all along and your Carberry part seed so Luther had part Wesley had part all them fellas had part but a Branham came to gather all the parts to present a whole seed which is the word so by the time he came on the scene son of man ready to unveil himself and the son of man is his saw of the seed but the seven errors committed come from eternity the God of all is scattered with all the loose ends and tied back into the world to bring down the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost couldn't come on as Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Pomona's promises and Peter said by these promises we become partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world you lost so for the escape once we have these virtues to fight for the content for the press for hallelujah by one Spirit we are baptized into that promoter [Applause]

Khan please you don't receive the Holy Ghost to become seed but a Branham because you are seed so listen eNOS it struck my soul about the body the body of Christ people could put y'all to their company or the churches they could take your tips or to their churches they could take your messages all to the library that's fine anybody could do whatever they want to do that's no problem nothing against that but they kind of take you out of the body of Christ and one person in the body can fight an exhibition in the body one ought to be in the body and next one alter the body elect don't persecute elect that is an impossibility my finger a factor in my foot and I know that I will my mouth my nose is there to smell my mouth is yet to speak my ass is data here and my eyes are still seeing I won't say my somebody and everybody belong where I belong we want everybody to be working everybody to be active everybody to be contributing to the effectual working of every measure we gonna continue to season are we gonna get you into it today was introducing the body of Christ the bride his church are you in the church I am front but a see but come on say are you in this Vegas bride Oh hallelujah hallelujah Old Glory decor just pushing a little bit [Music] Oh hallelujah hallelujah come on raise your hand I give awesome glory [Music] or are you in the church [Music] [Music] come and be baptized into the body and forever oh are you how are you [Music] are you the same girl come and be baptized into the body fat for a buh-ba-ba-bah children reach a mother sister are you in that just dry up -
