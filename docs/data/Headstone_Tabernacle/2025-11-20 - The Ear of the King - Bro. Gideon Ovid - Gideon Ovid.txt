Yes, Lord. Yes. [music] Thank you, Jesus. Blessed be your name, Lord. Lord, we worship you tonight. We praise you tonight, Lord. We lift you up tonight. [music] Blessed be his wonderful name. Let's just bow our heads a word of prayer. Oh heavenly father, at this time we just want to thank you and praise you, Lord, for being so good, Lord. Lord, for your loving kindness, for bringing us together in this way, Lord. Lord, we pray that you have your perfect [music and singing] way over this service, Lord. Everything that will be said, every song that was sung, that will be sung in the future, every word that will be spoken, every scripture that's read, Lord, I pray for everybody under the sound of my voice, everybody in this auditorium, Lord. Lord, those that might be at home or different places or may even see this content afterwards. I pray that your Holy Spirit will drop down wherever they are, Lord. May lives [music] be changed and transformed. [singing] May needs be met. May may hearts be restored, Lord. May minds be renewed, Lord. Lord, I pray that you inspire your people. I pray that you will lift them up, that you will raise them up, Lord, that you will heal, you will seal, baptize, deliver, Lord. Lord, I pray even as the service goes forth that mighty testimonies will come, God. Lord, Lord, wherever they are, Lord, Lord, you know the needs of your people, you know we are hungry, Lord. Lord, you know we are thirsty for more of you, Lord. Lord, we know we want a reality, Lord. We want a manifestation of your word in this hour, Lord. Lord, we didn't come here just to see each other, Lord, just to hear some words, Lord. But we came to be drawn closer to you, Lord. Lord, and we know you will meet us based on our faith, based on our expectation, Lord. Lord, have your way throughout this service in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. You love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Blessed be his holy name. Thank you, musicians. Amen. At this time, we want to switch over. And if you have your Bibles, I'd like to invite you to one scripture. You love him tonight. &gt;&gt; I believe we in for a time. We've had some inclement weather. We had some a lot of rain this evening and tonight. But by God's grace, we're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. He chose us before the foundation of the world to be here right now. &gt;&gt; We predestinated to be here in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you have your Bibles, I like you to turn with me to the book of Matthew, reading chapter 7 from verse 7 to 11. Amen. And it says, "Ask and it shall be given you." &gt;&gt; Seek and ye shall find. &gt;&gt; Knock and it shall be opened unto you. For everyone that askketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knockketh it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you, whom if his son asks bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Oh heavenly father, we've read your word, Lord, and anybody could read the scriptures like this, Lord, but we pray that you would breathe life into it, Lord. That you would reveal it to our hearts, Lord. That you would open our understanding, Lord. Lord, that we would see just a little more what you have in store for us tonight. Lord, I pray that you take me out of the way and and inspire the words that will be shared. Lord, Lord, I pray that you put these thoughts together in the way you want it to be placed. Lord, Lord, I pray that it'd be edifying to your body. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats at this time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And just for a title, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The heir of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. the heir of the king. It's so important tonight that we have the heir of the king. &gt;&gt; So when you ask, he could respond. &gt;&gt; That when you ask that he hears a familiar voice, that he's accustom, and that you have that kind of relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For an inspiration, you have not because he asked not. So tonight we're going to talk a little bit, share a little bit, and look at this concept of asking and relationship and being in such a place that we know that our prayers will be answered. &gt;&gt; That we know we have faith that anything is possible for you. &gt;&gt; Not just for your neighbor, but as an individual. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I I I'll start by asking if you have the heir of the king. Do you have the heir of the king? And what does that really mean? It means when you have a request, it's recognizable and he could respond accordingly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That when you say, "Oh God, Lord, father Jesus," and you have a particular request &gt;&gt; that he could acknowledge that and he knows &gt;&gt; he doesn't have to go, you know, from time to time. In a natural sense, if somebody doesn't call you for a long time, you haven't spoken to somebody for two, three years, and they dial your phone and you answer, at some point, you're almost unsure of who it might be because they're not familiar &gt;&gt; and you ask, "Who who is this? I know you're you call me by name, but I'm not too sure who you're trying to identify as." Right? That's not the way we want to be with the king, &gt;&gt; with the king of kings and lord of lords. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With the ruler, with the bright and morning star, &gt;&gt; with the lily of the valley, with the rose of Sharon, with the wheel in the middle of a wheel, &gt;&gt; with a shield and buckler, you don't want to play with that relationship. You want to know when you say, "Oh, God, &gt;&gt; he could answer." &gt;&gt; And he could hear your cry. He could hear your plea. He know you're sincere. He know you're called for a reason. He knows you have that kind of relationship in a natural sense. Again, &gt;&gt; can you just imagine? You have issues paying your rent. You have issues paying your bills. You have issues doing the things that you believe need to be done. &gt;&gt; But somewhere far off, you have a wealthy uncle. He has an estate. He has no children. He has more than he needs. He is looking for people that he associates with to bless them and help them. But you don't have relationship. &gt;&gt; You don't talk to him. &gt;&gt; That is uncle in the distance. &gt;&gt; At family get togethers. You don't talk to uncle. &gt;&gt; But uncle could assist you. Uncle could bless you in a spiritual sense. You know God wants to bless you more than you are even willing to receive. &gt;&gt; He wants to reward you. But you know what he says? &gt;&gt; He said without faith in Hebrews it's impossible to please God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But they say he that cometh to God must know that he is &gt;&gt; believing that &gt;&gt; and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you have to have the right kind of attitude to have this relationship we're talking about. &gt;&gt; To be able to have the heir of the king, the king has to know who you are. &gt;&gt; The king in a natural sense is not just going to open his go his gates and open his doors to strangers. &gt;&gt; He has security details. He has ambushments. He has guards. He has in a spiritual sense angels, &gt;&gt; seraraphims and cherubims around &gt;&gt; making sure everything is in order. &gt;&gt; But when you as a son, as a born son, as a filled son, as a qualified son with character comes and calls upon him, &gt;&gt; you want to see a way made &gt;&gt; where there seem to be no way. &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO SEE A HIGHWAY STRAIGHT TO to God himself &gt;&gt; without hindrances. So it means as he said when you stand praying &gt;&gt; if you have ought against any you have to forgive. &gt;&gt; So it means you need to remove the obstacles in real estate we call that encumbrances things that could easily beset you. Things that that could throw you off THINGS THAT COULD PRE PREVENT TRANSACTIONS from being completed. &gt;&gt; So when you pray you want to know that God could hear and God COULD ANSWER THAT GOD COULD RESPOND TO YOUR REQUEST. AMEN. That's the kind of an attitude we want to have because when we want to to to have the heir of this king, we need to consider who this king is. &gt;&gt; Who is this king of glory we talking about? &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT ANY KIND OF KING. THIS IS THE KING OF KINGS. THAT'S MY KING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT. THE ONE THAT'S he's his he's his he's his he's his he's his he's his he's his he's his he's his he's his he's lord. HE IS STRONG AND MIGHTY. &gt;&gt; HE IS MIGHTY IN BATTLE LIKE DAVID SAID. HE SAID, "Lift up your heads, O gates. even lift them up, ye everlasting doors, and the KING OF GLORY SHALL COME IN. HE SAID, "WHO IS THE KING OF GLORY?" THE LORD OF HOSTS, he is the king of glory. So if you want to have the air of the king, &gt;&gt; there must be an approach to the king. &gt;&gt; There must be a way to approach. There must be a way to have the air of the king. &gt;&gt; He must have given instructions and examples and said, "Look, that's what I want you to do. If you want best results, I don't know if if I've seen that before, often times you see you're given medication or you're given something that you have to do and they say for best results take in the morning and last thing before bed. &gt;&gt; Now, it doesn't mean you can't take it at other times, you know, &gt;&gt; but for best results, you need to follow the instructions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way God operates. He likes rules. He likes standards. &gt;&gt; He like things that you can follow. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's almost like an exact science. You do this and you get blessed. It reminds me of Cain and Abel when they were called upon to make a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; It's well known and well documented that Abel had a more excellent sacrifice. &gt;&gt; It didn't mean Cain didn't make a sacrifice, you know, but Abel had a more excellent sacrifice. &gt;&gt; So, it stands to reason that what Abel did was not just accepted by God, but is really what God wanted. Amen. &gt;&gt; When that happened, it was now easy for Cain &gt;&gt; because God could step back and say, "Listen, you see that there you have an example now." &gt;&gt; If you do that, you will get blessed. &gt;&gt; If you could follow my rules, follow my way cuz my thoughts higher than your thoughts and my ways higher than your ways. So you may not understand, but that is a revelation there. And if you could follow that, you will get blessed. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, you'll get the same blessing. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's the way God is. So if God said there's a particular approach if you want to approach me, I think it's it's reasonable and fair to think that we should be interested in knowing what that approach looks like. &gt;&gt; Because if we could do as God say, &gt;&gt; we will get the same results. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He can't lie. He can't fail. So if you do what's required, if you could fulfill his requirements, you get same pay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember those workers? Some would have started in the first hour. Some may have started in the third or fifth or ninth. But at the 11th hour when he said, "Listen, I have too much work and too few laborers." And he called the 11th hour laborers to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It didn't matter what time they came. You know, &gt;&gt; they met the requirement which was come and assist. Come and work, come and labor, come do what it takes to get the results. And guess what? Same pay. &gt;&gt; It entitled you to the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you had the requirement. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. So to have the heir of the king, you need to have the right approach &gt;&gt; and the right approach is before us as examples. SO IF WE COULD ADOPT THAT, GUESS WHAT? We will have the heir of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says we have not because we ask not. But you know there's a wrong way to ask &gt;&gt; as a parent when my children walk up to me and they say I want juice. You stop them one time. That's not the way to ask. You had to ask better than that cuz a more excellent way to request something you might want. So it might be better to say can I have some juice please? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So with God it's like that you could try your own thing you know but he has his way. &gt;&gt; He has a more excellent way that you want us to adopt in order to get the results because he wants to bless you but he wants to SEE THAT YOU ARE MATURE enough to take correction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that that that he could prune you that he could trim you so you could bring forth more fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he don't want you just remain like children. Paul said, "When I was a child, I spake as a child and I understood as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things because I'm mature now and I could understand. I could I could assimilate and manipulate the information because I've been tutored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been trained. &gt;&gt; I've gone through some trials and some challenges and some experiences &gt;&gt; because my objective is to be perfect. &gt;&gt; My objective is to be like my father. My objective is when they come they will say your signature just like your father. &gt;&gt; You all think the same way, you talk the same way, you act the same same way. So when I see him, I see you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if that's the the objective, we need to do the things it takes to get there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandon preach a message the approach to God. And in it, paragraph seven here, here what he said. Now notice, blessed is the man whom thou art chosen to approach thee, that he, the chosen one to approach, may dwell in thy courts, and we will be satisfied in thy temple. Notice the approach to God. God has a way of approach. &gt;&gt; This is not my way. &gt;&gt; This is not a new doctrine or teaching here. This is God's way. &gt;&gt; He said, you know, if you're going to visit a king in the natural, &gt;&gt; there's a way you approach a king. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I would say in Trinidad is a way you approach the prime minister or the president or the head of state. You will dress a particular way. You may operate a particular way. You may walk a particular way because you're going to approach a dignitary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this sense, you say, well, make it more simpler than that. The boy that wants to approach a young lady to get acquainted with with her, there's a certain approach. &gt;&gt; So, we see in consistency. There is an approach if you want the result. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You just can't come up there and say, "Hey, I like to meet you. I like you." &gt;&gt; No, it wouldn't work. So, &gt;&gt; she isn't very much of a lady. She let you know where to get on and off. All right. There's a certain way that you want to approach it. You want to come up with respects to the lady and so forth. And there's a way to approach all things and there's a way to approach God. That's where we started. And if we don't know the approach to God, we'll never be able to get an audience with God. &gt;&gt; Cuz it starts there. You want an audience with God &gt;&gt; because if you're not talking to God, who you talking to? &gt;&gt; Who you talking with? &gt;&gt; So you want an audience with God. See, you have to know in a court, you don't just walk up and the judges on the stand and say, "Hey, judge, I want to talk to you a little bit." Somebody will throw you out the court, be held in contempt. You might have to pay some extra fines in addition to why you were there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's a way to approach a judge. &gt;&gt; Just like there's a way to approach a king. &gt;&gt; There's a way to approach a lady. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we are concerned about the way to approach God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They lock you up for disorderly conduct. See, there's a way you have to approach a judge. And we must find a way to approach the great divine judge, God himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When one time man through angelic beings perhaps when he came before the pre presence his majesty the great king of heaven perhaps approach in some other way. But since sin separated the relationship obviously the rules would have changed &gt;&gt; cuz there might have been a different approach you know &gt;&gt; but now I could tell you in advance &gt;&gt; the only way to approach God is through the blood. There's no other way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's a fundamental issue. The fundamental issue with which we are faced is often times people are challenged with how to approach, how to get that air and what they asking for. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; those two two two challenges. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; how and what. All right. &gt;&gt; You see, how speaks to preparation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If I tell you, I want to explain to you how to approach the king. There might be some steps involved. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; It means you may have to prepare. You may take some notes. You may record it. You may try to perhaps role play to make sure you're doing it correctly because we talking about how. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It have a level of faith involved &gt;&gt; because you can't approach without faith. Without faith, it's impossible to please God. &gt;&gt; And he want you to please him. &gt;&gt; So when you please him, he could now respond to you and say, "There is my spirit flowing freely." &gt;&gt; Because you're just like him. &gt;&gt; You're doing things the way he will want it done. &gt;&gt; It speaks to the desire to do what it takes to get the result. &gt;&gt; All right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know there are some folks I wanted to know but I wanted bad enough. &gt;&gt; You mean I really had to go to the Jordan to be baptized? &gt;&gt; You mean I had to go grandandy? I had to go through this rain. You might want it but you don't want it bad enough. &gt;&gt; But you see when you look at how the approach goes, &gt;&gt; it speaks to our desire, our willingness to do whatever it takes to get the result. So having faith is one thing but you see it reminds me the woman with the issue of blood &gt;&gt; just as a as a backstory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This wasn't she feeling sick today so I feel I hear a crusade and I go in. No it wasn't that &gt;&gt; she had this issue as a continuous issue for 12 years. &gt;&gt; Bleeding for 12 years. That was a serious condition. What was worse is that she went and her medical issue was real long because she went doctor after doctor, &gt;&gt; physician after physician, &gt;&gt; clinic after clinic. &gt;&gt; She went private, she went public. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She went private first. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Until the money ran out, &gt;&gt; went public after. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then realized they still couldn't help her. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; She knew the doctors by first name. But you see, the scripture said &gt;&gt; she then heard of Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not against the doctor, you know, &gt;&gt; but she perhaps didn't hear of Jesus before. &gt;&gt; Cuz then she might have been healed and wealthy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But the the money was already spent. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So when she heard of him, it speaks to preparation. &gt;&gt; Yes. It speaks to faith &gt;&gt; and it speaks to having a desire to do whatever it took. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The reason I say preparation is because she heard &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; of Jesus &gt;&gt; and what he was doing &gt;&gt; and what he did. &gt;&gt; So she heard a testimony and she believed. &gt;&gt; That's where the faith come. &gt;&gt; She believed that and she told herself. Read the scripture yourself. &gt;&gt; It says, "If I could touch, that's right. &gt;&gt; Not if the elder pray for me. If I So she took PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER ACTIONS. She said, "If I could only touch the hem of the garment, &gt;&gt; I don't need to to give him a big hug or a high five. &gt;&gt; IF I COULD JUST TOUCH THE HEM, &gt;&gt; I know, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; it's in order. &gt;&gt; The last part is &gt;&gt; Jesus wasn't doing independent viewings. He wasn't working by appointment, &gt;&gt; right? So there was a crowd around him &gt;&gt; and you could imagine the needs might have been diverse. &gt;&gt; This one foot hurting, this one have a headache, this one have a back pain. These three on this side, they have something going on. And she &gt;&gt; told herself that listen you see today &gt;&gt; you see this day, this Wednesday night here, &gt;&gt; I not going home unless I touch &gt;&gt; because I know IF I COULD TOUCH, THAT'S IT. It's settled. It's finished. I have no other question. I don't have to go anywhere else. I don't have to look to the left, to the right. I don't even need a second opinion. &gt;&gt; If I could just touch. &gt;&gt; So that's the motivation she had. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So at that point, &gt;&gt; she went, &gt;&gt; you could imagine sometimes faith will build a level of excitement. Today are going are going because I hear Jesus is in tongue and are going and I are going to be delivered. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when she reach and she see the crowd. So &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; could imagine when you're about to leave home and you see the rain. So &gt;&gt; all of a sudden the excitement now starting to be conflicted and confused &gt;&gt; because I know tonight is my night. But &gt;&gt; I seeing some obstructions. I seeing some distractions. I seeing some incumbrances. I seeing some things TRYING TO HINDER ME FROM THE GOAL. But you see that last part, the desire to do what it takes. &gt;&gt; It means some through the water, some through the flood, some through the fire. Wherever you're going, all going through the blood, YOU KNOW, BUT YOU HAD TO JUMP OVER SOME. YOU MIGHT WALK and step aside a little bit, but you know the destination because you know that is what it takes to get the result. &gt;&gt; You can't get the air the king just staying home. You rock back home &gt;&gt; hoping to get healed. &gt;&gt; You just rock back home. &gt;&gt; No, but you see when you put it in the action like like this, guess what? She touch and go. &gt;&gt; She she she just touch and go. Jesus turned back and say, "Who touched my clothes?" &gt;&gt; And you know the story they say, "But everybody, everybody pushing, everybody is like a a Maxi Initiate right now. Everybody just trying to, you know, trying to reach &gt;&gt; and he said, "No, this one was a little different &gt;&gt; because I felt virtually leave me &gt;&gt; and he actually turned and addressed her and recognized that listen." He said listen go at peace and you'll be made whole. Now she already healed you know. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But in essence he is saying I acknowledge that you're healed. But the kind of faith expressed and the things that you went through to reach here I want you to know that I know that you healed and I want you to know that you had my air because you receive and was able to pull from me right now and that is not going to impact you again. &gt;&gt; That's not going to come back. So you can afford to go your way in peace. You don't have to worry. You don't have to think about it. You don't have to wonder if you're going to be impacted anymore. This day, LISTEN, JUST LIKE THE Egyptians know, this is the last you're going to see at them forever. &gt;&gt; It not going to affect you again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; we're still talking about how &gt;&gt; that centurion was a similar story. If you could recall &gt;&gt; when he in the first instance he decided that I heard about this Jesus thing too. I may not be all familiar and chummy chum with him, you know, but you know what? I know he has the ability to fulfill a need that I have at home &gt;&gt; because this servant home that I love &gt;&gt; need to be healed. &gt;&gt; He cast sick &gt;&gt; and I believe. &gt;&gt; So you see the faith. &gt;&gt; I believe Jesus have what it takes to respond to that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Listen, &gt;&gt; this is my story. Yes, &gt;&gt; my servant isn't well. He's back home. &gt;&gt; I really have a desire for him to be healed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But I don't even feel worthy for you to come under my roof. &gt;&gt; Cuz we are not of the same kind, you know. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to express something here that's a little different. &gt;&gt; I'm going to express a certain level of respects, a certain attitude, and a certain level of faith that is unprecedented. cuz he say listen I'm a man under authority and I tell one come and he come and tell one go and he go &gt;&gt; and I realize too that you are similar to me in that respect we may not be of the same tribe or the same ilk but what I could tell you is that I could recognize that you have a similar ability to tell the demons to go and they go &gt;&gt; and that's what I'm interested in &gt;&gt; so he was able to develop very quickly a unique relationship with Jesus &gt;&gt; to be able to relate to him in a way that Jesus could understand. &gt;&gt; And at that point, &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't only say that the servant was healed at that hour. You know, he said in whole in listening the whole country, whole of Israel, wherever he s he could search high, low, front, back, east, west, he had not seen that level of faith anywhere else. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the man had such a conviction, such a belief that he didn't care &gt;&gt; if Jesus was like him or not. He didn't care how it go look. He didn't care how it felt at that time. Well, what how it going to feel as a big centurion as a kind of boss where I am and I going and talk to Jesus about doing me a favor. He didn't care about that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was willing to do whatever it took &gt;&gt; to ensure &gt;&gt; that he had the air of the king. &gt;&gt; King Jesus was in front of him at that time. &gt;&gt; He could have gotten direct communication to the king at that time. &gt;&gt; So he had to have the right attitude. &gt;&gt; He couldn't just come and say, "Listen, I'm the big boss here." No, they call me senu cuz I a centurion. &gt;&gt; That wasn't his approach. He said, "I recognize &gt;&gt; that the same way I am under authority &gt;&gt; that you have a real unique relationship with the father &gt;&gt; that you could do the thing that I desire at this point." &gt;&gt; And as a matter of fact, you know, sometimes we say to to to butter it up. Listen, as a matter of fact, I am not even worthy for you to come to my home. &gt;&gt; I have a nice house, you know, but my house not even nice enough for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now this is natural manner. &gt;&gt; This is not necessarily the people that going to church Sunday and Wednesday and Friday and you know who here in line upon line and word upon word. You know this is just a natural man in his position &gt;&gt; being able to communicate and connect &gt;&gt; with the king. Now, a very popular one we know is Queen, Queen Queen Esther, of course, &gt;&gt; and we know the backstory. At that point, there was a decree that essentially meant it could have been their death, could have been their demise, right? Morai got rid of it and he knew what was going to happen. And you say, Esther, here's what I don't want you to feel that you're protected and you're spared because of your position and your location and where you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, as they say, desperate times call for desperate measures. So, we need to do something different. &gt;&gt; Speaking still about approach, &gt;&gt; in this case in the book of Esther, and I want to read it directly from from the Bible, &gt;&gt; Esther 4:16, just two verses there. It says, "Go." And this was the instruction not to Esther, but this was her response to what Mordei encouraged her to do. She said, "Go gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. &gt;&gt; I also and my maidens will fast likewise, and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law." &gt;&gt; So she knew. &gt;&gt; Yes. This wasn't the norm. This wasn't what the law said is is supposed to happen. So, she was taking risk. &gt;&gt; What does that speak to? Willing to do what it took. Having a desire to get the result and the desire was so strong, she went into preparation mode. She said, "Listen, all you're fasting for three days, day and night, don't eat or drink anything. We fasting together as a group. And at the end of the third day, I am going as an individual. Although I know this is not the law, I going and do it &gt;&gt; because I can't sit down and do nothing. &gt;&gt; I have a need &gt;&gt; and I want to have the air of the king &gt;&gt; cuz I know if I could only get the air of the king, my circumstance could change. &gt;&gt; Everything around me could change tonight if I could only get the air of the king. &gt;&gt; So listen, she said, "If I perish, I perish." Amen. &gt;&gt; So Modi went his way and did according to all that Esther had commanded him. &gt;&gt; In Esther 5:1, here's what it says. Now it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel. Now, she didn't just wake out of bed and say, "Today the day I go in, you know, no, she put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house. And the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house. God. &gt;&gt; So, she went into preparation. &gt;&gt; She went into listen, I want to make sure although this is not the law, I want to make sure things are in place. &gt;&gt; I want to make sure I am in position. &gt;&gt; I want to make sure I have on the right attire. &gt;&gt; I want to make sure my dress is the way it's supposed to be. I don't want to have any questionable thing going on that causes doubt that causes any kind of drama to take place outside of the objective I have because I want to make sure I have the king's undivided attention so the king could attend to my prayer to my cry to my plea to my need my condition. Amen. &gt;&gt; In verse two here's what it says. And it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight. And the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter. Then said the king unto her, "What wil thou, Queen Esther? And what is thy request?" Her objective was achieved. At that point, she had the heir of the king &gt;&gt; because she adopted the right approach. &gt;&gt; Now granted, if you look on the surface, it looks like this is a suicide mission. &gt;&gt; This is not the law. This is not the way it's supposed to be done. &gt;&gt; This is not the way that is outlined for you to approach the king. But guess what? This time the need was great. &gt;&gt; The desperation was strong. And she had prepared, she had the faith. And similar to the Hebrew boys, she say, "Listen, I'm going in." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; If a perish, I perish, &gt;&gt; but are going to see the king. &gt;&gt; You know when they say, "Listen, &gt;&gt; we not even convinced that he will deliver us out of the fire. &gt;&gt; But guess what? &gt;&gt; Even if he doesn't deliver us, we are more convinced &gt;&gt; in who he is. We are more convinced in his word &gt;&gt; and being faithful to his promise &gt;&gt; that we willing to take that chance. &gt;&gt; So we still not bowing down. &gt;&gt; Listen when I explore this you know what I realized faith don't really give exit clause you know you know when when I was younger in school we used to do pro programming and we used to have a a circle in programming called if then else. So if this happen then this is going to happen else this is going to happen. So it always had these kind of options. If you go right then you're faced with two options else you go some somewhere else. In God's word it don't have a exit clause. The way it does work is if I perish I perish. That's it. &gt;&gt; I going in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I perish then I perish. &gt;&gt; It have no else. Well, I could use another approach or another way. No, this is it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God's way. &gt;&gt; That is what he he outlined. &gt;&gt; That what that that's what he put for us. &gt;&gt; That is the way he listen. He craft his word. It's so beautiful. It's so awesome. Just talking about Jesus, just talking about his word, his promises, and the things he lay out for us. It's amazing, you know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the book of Luke, it speaks about a woman who &gt;&gt; having 10 coins, she lost one. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; yeah, she lost one. &gt;&gt; And it says, either what woman having 10 pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, do not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it. &gt;&gt; And when she had found it, she called it her friends and her neighbors together, saying, "Rejoice with me, for I have found the peace which I lost." &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. You know in the beginning when I said you know those who seek will find. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we talk about asking a little bit just now. But in this woman's case she had a great need. Her need was to locate a missing piece. &gt;&gt; Something she had lost. But you see, it was so meaningful to her. It was so valuable to her that they say she willing to light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently. So she not looking halfway, you know. She not lifting up the counter, little couch or something, a pillow and say, "Are you tired?" You know, you see the sun hot these days. Are you able to search it? Best I go and buy a new one. Best I get a next one. If it lost, it lost. when it find it fine. No, &gt;&gt; her approach &gt;&gt; was listen you see today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am finding this lost coin today. &gt;&gt; This missing piece will be found today. &gt;&gt; I am getting a testimony about this today. &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving it till next week and calling friends to come and help. She took personal responsibility &gt;&gt; for what was meaningful to her. &gt;&gt; So imagine your prayer prayer life. Imagine you have an excuse that well I accustom praying you know but you see my wife wasn't praying so I decide on not praying or my children was giving a little trouble so I decide I I'll take a little time off and spend some quality time with them. No, she didn't pass the responsibility, you know. She took personal responsibility for her need and decide listen whether you have to do it or not this is my reasonable service. This is what I choose to do myself as my personal responsibility and you after she found it cuz of course she was successful in finding it then she could call her friends. So she aligning and putting God after the fact. She aligning and putting her responsibilities after. She not taking it easy and after the fact she decide I go give a a little thing. No after she find it. She call her friends her neighbors together and say you could rejoice with me now. We can have a party now. We could lime now. Listen we could smile and we could enjoy each other at this point because I am whole. I am not missing any pieces. I had listen all the virtues &gt;&gt; all of them. &gt;&gt; I'm not missing any at all. I I I don't want to leave that because per adventure my husband come now. &gt;&gt; I want to have all &gt;&gt; per adventure God comes tonight AND SAY LISTEN MARKING papers tonight and he looks so and he tried to measure you up and you say well I had really planned to work on brotherly kindness tomorrow. I really planned that. As a matter of fact, I have it in a book. I have it written. I have it written in a notepad. I really plan to. No, no, no. Listen. You have to do what needs to be done first. &gt;&gt; Take personal responsibility for those things first. &gt;&gt; Why you think the Bible says seek first the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; and righteousness and all other things shall be added &gt;&gt; afterwards? You know, &gt;&gt; it wouldn't be left undone. Amen. &gt;&gt; It will be added. &gt;&gt; So don't worry about it too much. But you have to make the main thing the main thing. You have to focus on the things that are important. You have to take responsibility, personal responsibility to the things that are meaningful to you. &gt;&gt; And meaningful to you should mean &gt;&gt; it's meaningful to God. &gt;&gt; Because you know what he said? He said, "Listen, if you love the world and the things of the world, you don't love me. &gt;&gt; You are my enemy. Because in essence, you keeping me away from my objective &gt;&gt; because my goal is to serve him. My goal is to please him. My goal is to be close to him. My goal is to be like him. So if you throw me off that, then I should really walk away from you. Because how could two walk together? At least they agree. &gt;&gt; They can't. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we move on a little bit and I want to just touch on the unjust judge because we talk about asking and seeking and and knocking and stuff and I wouldn't go into the whole story but but you know it really wanted this judge to avenge her. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She wanted justice. &gt;&gt; She wanted equality. She wanted fairness. She wanted somebody &gt;&gt; who was in a position to deal with her scenario. &gt;&gt; So she had to get his air. &gt;&gt; And the scripture went on to say, you know, &gt;&gt; she really wear him down &gt;&gt; because he was a mean guy. &gt;&gt; He really didn't have her to study. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to take her on. &gt;&gt; Now this is not a license to harass folks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm just making it clear. It's not a license to it's not a license to harass folks. But you know this is how life is. &gt;&gt; You know you know everybody and the neighbor tell you the boss mean the neighbor mean that person mean they have an attitude they operate a particular way &gt;&gt; but that is not a license for you to disrespect them. &gt;&gt; That's not a license for you to treat them unjustly. That's right. &gt;&gt; It actually opens the scenario to you for you to be lovely to them &gt;&gt; for you to change the the perception, the status quo, the mindset, the approach &gt;&gt; cuz they they may grow so accustomed to people believing that they are mean &gt;&gt; and standoffish. They're arrogant. They have an attitude. &gt;&gt; But what if you respond in love? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What if you respond in humility? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What if you respond in a way to relate to them? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, it may elicit a different response to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this woman, she had a need &gt;&gt; and she approached the unjust judge. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And naturally, he had no time with her. &gt;&gt; That was his his mindset. &gt;&gt; That was his personality. That was the way he operated. &gt;&gt; He had no time with her. But you see, after a while, &gt;&gt; after a while, &gt;&gt; we talk about diligently seeking, &gt;&gt; diligently knocking. &gt;&gt; Listen, she was resolute. She wasn't giving up. She was like Jacob and the angel. &gt;&gt; She not, Listen, he not going and let the angel go unless he bless him. She wasn't going and let that unjust judge sleep. &gt;&gt; She was knocking. She was asking, &gt;&gt; she was requesting. She was beseeching. She was begging. She was sending emails, text message, WhatsApp and and listen, she was writing on LinkedIn, Instagram. She make Tik Tok videos. Any way that she could reach him, she wanted to reach him because she had a need and she knew he was qualified to address it. &gt;&gt; Switching quickly to what? &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; it could take whole night to talk about how &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; your approach. You must have faith. You must believe. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Especially when it looks impossible, &gt;&gt; when it looks difficult, when it looks like it can't be done. &gt;&gt; That's the time to be certain of God. &gt;&gt; That's the time to see the faith expressed. &gt;&gt; And remember, listen, when Lazarus died, they said, "Lord, if you had been here, &gt;&gt; he would not have died." &gt;&gt; You know what he said? Well, he wept. He cried. He was saddened &gt;&gt; because that was his friend. &gt;&gt; They say he loved Lazarus and his sisters Mary and Martha. But there came a point in which he said listen this is not the way you looking at it. You looking at it as as your brother died &gt;&gt; but the reason this is so is because I really want God to be glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not really about us here. All right. &gt;&gt; It's not even about showing that something could happen here. They just wait for me. No, it's not that. &gt;&gt; But we want God to get the glory because he's the king of glory. You know, &gt;&gt; he's the king of kings. &gt;&gt; He is above. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Everything you could ask or think, he bigger than that. &gt;&gt; The things you have need of tonight, he could fix it tonight, you know. &gt;&gt; But do do you have his air? &gt;&gt; Do you use the right approach? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Chronicles 1st Chronicles 4:10, you have to find it. They said, "Jabz called on God of Israel, saying, "Oh, that thou wouldest blessed me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, and it may not grieve me." And God granted him that which he requested. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I read this scripture and it's a familiar scriptures scripture I I know something referred to as the prayer of Jabz that that you enlarge his territory, enlarge his coast, &gt;&gt; enlarge what he could look over and be in control of. &gt;&gt; But you know what stood out to me? The fact that his prayer was so specific. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have requests are so general. Bless me Lord and God asking you how but you done done you done pray and you walk off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord I want more. So you look at you say more of what? But you listen you done prayer. You sleeping tomorrow again. Bless me Lord. You say how Lord I want more. He say you know what? Let me give them some harder trials. Yes. Because &gt;&gt; I don't know if that is what you're asking for. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But Jabus was very specific. &gt;&gt; He say enlarge my coast &gt;&gt; and that thy hand might be with me. &gt;&gt; I don't want you just enlarge it and like a fish out of water trying to man manage above and beyond. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But you see, every place I put my foot, I want to be able to manage it, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz he who were faithful in little, faithful in much, but I don't think I could do it for myself. So I want your hand to protect me. I want you to form a hedge around me. So as I scale and as I expand, you could protect me. &gt;&gt; Keep me humble. Keep me grounded. KEEP ME SIMPLE SO I could see you right through. &gt;&gt; I don't want to become puffed up and proud. I want to be able to walk as you shine the light by my feet because your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light onto my path. So I want you to say with me as we go and he say that thou would keep me from evil because I know as my co expand people might get jealous of me. &gt;&gt; People might be envious and may try to do wickedness. And I know the battle is not against flesh and blood but against principalities and power. So I want you to cover me &gt;&gt; with a mighty hand. So not just walk with me, but protect ME THAT YOUR PRESENCE will surround me always &gt;&gt; that it may not grieve me. &gt;&gt; And guess what? God granted his request. &gt;&gt; Read the Bible. God granted that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; David in Psalm 61 is a popular one. Say it. We sing it. Hear my cry, oh God. Attend unto my prayer. &gt;&gt; This is a man who God will say is a man after my own heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Attend unto my prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the ends of the earth will I cry unto thee. When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is higher than I. &gt;&gt; For thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy. You see how specific? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will abide in thy tabernacle forever. I will trust in the convert of thy wings. Silah, for thou, oh God, has heard my vows. Thou has given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. Thou will prolong the king's life and his years as many generations. &gt;&gt; He shall abide before God forever, or prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So will I sing praise unto thy name forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I may daily perform my vows. You see how specific? &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; This is a man with the air of the king. &gt;&gt; I just want to skip down now. &gt;&gt; You see in Psalms 86, &gt;&gt; I'm going to wind up just now. I don't want to be too long. From verse one, it says, "Bow down thine ear, O Lord. Hear me for I am poor and needy." &gt;&gt; So this is speaking to what? So you meet the king. what you going to tell him if God is to sit right next to you and say what you have need of a haterite was given that opportunity &gt;&gt; what you have need of tonight &gt;&gt; where you go and say &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus &gt;&gt; Lord I want to pay off my mortgage &gt;&gt; Lord I want to pay for my car &gt;&gt; Lord heal my foot you going to tell the king if you have his Have you ever considered that? &gt;&gt; What you're meditating on, &gt;&gt; what you're thinking about, &gt;&gt; what you have on your heart, what you're sighing and crying about, &gt;&gt; that praying about every day that you have a burden for, that you have a desire about. &gt;&gt; In verse two, he says, "Preserve my soul. I am holy, oh thou my God. Save thy servant that trusteth in thee. Be merciful unto me, oh Lord, for I cry unto thee daily, not monthly. You know, &gt;&gt; daily. You see, when God used to come in the Garden of Eden, he did he didn't used to do a app a praisal every month. Every evening in the cooler evening, you would come. Adam, where where you at? Let's have a little chat. How things went? Everything all right? You're good. The animals good. The mountains looking nice. The trees still green. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Daily. &gt;&gt; You know what I call that? Relationship. &gt;&gt; That's relationship. &gt;&gt; You're relating daily. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you have relationship, it's easy to get an air. &gt;&gt; It's easy to put in a request. [applause] &gt;&gt; Come on. We live Trinidad. Imagine you have to get something done. The first thing I'll ask who you are know working so so so if I know the person but I haven't spoken to the person for the year is not helpful to you. &gt;&gt; You really want to know who do you have relationship with that it could help to benefit me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So God in coming down in the cool of the evening, you know when he discovered that Adam was out of place. You you know when? Same day. &gt;&gt; You know why? The last time they spoke was the day before. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So he knew something had to be wrong. &gt;&gt; Now he knows what was going to happen. You know, &gt;&gt; he always had a redemption plan, &gt;&gt; but he also knew the day drama was going to start. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because he had daily communion, daily conversation, daily relationship. &gt;&gt; David here said, "Be merciful unto me, oh Lord, for I cry unto thee daily." So you you know my voice by now cuz it's every day a crying unto you. &gt;&gt; Rejoice &gt;&gt; the soul of thy servant. For unto thee, oh Lord, do I lift up my soul. For thou, Lord, are good and ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. In verse six, hear what it says. Give heir, oh Lord, unto my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplications. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the day of my trouble, I will call upon thee for thou wil answer me. &gt;&gt; You see that there? &gt;&gt; In the day of my trouble. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You say, "I have no issue calling you." You know, because I know I will get an answer because of the relationship we have. I know you will respond. &gt;&gt; Essentially, if I dial your phone, I know you'll pick up. I know for certain you will pick up because we good like that. &gt;&gt; We close. We have relationship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Listen, I have your air. [applause] Just want to skip down a little bit &gt;&gt; talking about Solomon &gt;&gt; in the book of first kings. &gt;&gt; It says this is first kings 3:9 give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people. This was the request of Solomon. But we talking about what we asking for. What we want to ask the king for that I may discern between good and bad. For who is able to judge this thy so great a people? It just speaks to specificity. How specific he was. He didn't just say I want I want to judge folks or I want to be a judge. No. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "I want to have an understanding heart &gt;&gt; to judge thy people." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That I may discern between good and bad. &gt;&gt; Very specific. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For who is able to judge this thy so great a people. In verse 10, and the speech pleased the Lord, &gt;&gt; that Solomon had asked this thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God said unto him, because thou has asked this thing, &gt;&gt; and has not asked for thyself long life, neither has asked riches for thyself, nor has asked the life of thine enemies. &gt;&gt; Remember, you could ask for anything, you know. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When you have the air of the king, that is where character becomes important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you can ask for anything. Amen. &gt;&gt; You ask for sickness. You ask for debt. You ask for riches. Whatever you ask for. &gt;&gt; He said, "But has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment." &gt;&gt; He says, "Behold, I have done according to thy words. Lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart." So, you get that? &gt;&gt; So that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I have also given thee that which thou has not asked. &gt;&gt; Remember God know the thoughts and intents of your heart to know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. So even the things you ask, the things you don't ask, he's still aware of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He say both riches and honor so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days. And if thou will walk in my ways. So this is the caveat here. Now &gt;&gt; so in addition to all that you get &gt;&gt; he say if thou wil walk in my ways &gt;&gt; to keep my statutes and my commandments &gt;&gt; as thy father did walk that father being David as thy father David did walk then I will lengthen thy days. &gt;&gt; So you get a little caveat there. So beside all the blessing, beside all the wealth, beside all the wisdom, beside all the understanding, if you walk and follow my ways like father &gt;&gt; David, &gt;&gt; right? Like your father David did, I will lengthen your days too so you live long. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Musician can get ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, as we close, I just want to say that God has a pro he has provided an approach. He's a He has a provided an approach tonight &gt;&gt; to be able to have his air. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As sons and daughters of God, as predestinated children of God, it must be important to you to have the air of the king. &gt;&gt; So at any point, &gt;&gt; you could reach out Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; At any point &gt;&gt; he could respond &gt;&gt; knowing that that's my son and all &gt;&gt; I know he went through a rough time today but you know what I have a surprise for him tomorrow &gt;&gt; because you have relationship &gt;&gt; you're not a stranger &gt;&gt; you see &gt;&gt; he has an approach &gt;&gt; that's through his bloodise &gt;&gt; he gives an approach through his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He gives an approach through his end time message. &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you play the song true through the blood. &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you tonight &gt;&gt; to look at yourself &gt;&gt; and see &gt;&gt; as an individual &gt;&gt; if you have the air of the king. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have that kind of relationship with him, &gt;&gt; that you could speak with him, converse with him, commune with him, have that type of relationship, like David said, he said, "Listen, in my day of trouble, I will call you cuz I know you will answer [music] &gt;&gt; because we have that type of relationship." Glor. &gt;&gt; So it's one thing to have a oneoff heal my cousin, heal my neighbor, but when you have that personalized relationship with him, nothing could stop that. Friends can't stop that. Family can't stop that. [music] &gt;&gt; Neighbors can't stop that because that's something on the inside that they can't take away. As a matter of fact, he wants that for you more than you want it for yourself. &gt;&gt; He wants that so much that he said, "Listen, if love don't do it, conditions will." &gt;&gt; He will turn your family against you, your friends against you. He will throw in a bed of sickness &gt;&gt; because he wants to have that type of relationship with you tonight. May we stand? &gt;&gt; You love him tonight.
