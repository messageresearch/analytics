[12:00] god bless you things
[12:01] and welcome and
[12:03] what
[12:04] what um
[12:08] how
[12:09] things could change so rapidly right in
[12:10] front of very eyes
[12:12] as you all will all know about uh russia
[12:16] uh invading ukraine
[12:19] and um
[12:20] bible
[12:22] but obama was
[12:23] russia the king of the north
[12:25] and this is what kings do kings conquer
[12:29] kings gain territory
[12:31] russia
[12:32] uh is not a democracy
[12:35] it's what you call
[12:37] a dictatorship it's
[12:39] and um maybe i don't know what the lord
[12:41] will do when i'm unfold on sunday but
[12:44] the thing about it
[12:46] russia
[12:47] was raised up
[12:49] to judge america you know
[12:51] sometimes backwards feeling america's
[12:53] already judged
[12:54] just waiting for these sometimes to know
[12:56] russia was raised up to do that destroy
[12:58] america destroy iran russia is in the
[13:01] hands of god
[13:02] foreign
[13:05] and um we are here we are on the border
[13:08] of world war three we under the door of
[13:10] it
[13:11] you know
[13:12] uh our generation
[13:14] we were not fortunate
[13:16] to be
[13:18] that may not be the right word but we
[13:21] were not in the times of the forties and
[13:23] and when that world war one to the tree
[13:25] and world war two and all these
[13:27] different things like that
[13:28] face anything major in that kind of a
[13:30] way but here it is with all these bombs
[13:32] and nuclear weapons and so on and and
[13:34] i'll tell you this though
[13:36] that you can't say this is distant from
[13:38] us
[13:39] because nuclear power and all this
[13:41] destructive thing blend would affect the
[13:44] entire world
[13:45] so we are going to some treacherous time
[13:48] and you know i was thinking to myself if
[13:50] at this point in time
[13:52] uh the king
[13:54] of the north
[13:55] could make this move
[13:58] in the face of everybody hollering don't
[13:59] do it don't do it and you know he just
[14:02] went in and do what he has to do he's
[14:04] moved to do what he has to do what about
[14:06] the bride of jesus christ with all these
[14:08] promises that we have
[14:10] i believe there's a spirit
[14:12] the spirit itself to call upon our bride
[14:15] for the brighter maker move and i hope
[14:18] um that we would get help tonight from
[14:21] what what will be shared
[14:23] and that will be edified and striking we
[14:25] are living in treacherous time
[14:27] but ibrahim talked about
[14:29] lies being governed by these sinful men
[14:31] who has
[14:32] the ability to press this nuclear bomb
[14:35] sinful men i want to think about that a
[14:36] minute
[14:37] now these guys are christians
[14:40] no part of the world have christian men
[14:42] leading the country
[14:44] satan already told jesus all these
[14:46] kingdoms are mined
[14:47] that crew in trinidad america russia the
[14:49] whole bunch
[14:50] all these are mines all these little
[14:52] principalities powers
[14:54] demons territorial spirits
[14:56] i'm sitting on drones and influencing
[14:59] flesh and blood
[15:01] and um you know
[15:04] there was a king i think in the
[15:05] scriptures and that is the way god was
[15:06] speaking to that lucifer spirit behind
[15:08] that king
[15:10] where was dawn and how adult fallen and
[15:12] all a spirit behind a king
[15:15] so sometimes you look at people
[15:17] and you don't know what spirit
[15:19] is
[15:20] behind them
[15:21] what spirit is influencing them
[15:23] you know um
[15:25] i was talking to my son isaac i said but
[15:27] isaac said have you ever
[15:28] studied that scripture
[15:31] uh that the children eat
[15:33] the fathers
[15:35] eats our greeks
[15:37] and the children's teach is on edge
[15:40] and i find that is an astonishing
[15:42] scripture
[15:44] a finishing scripture in that
[15:46] you are seeing the effect of generations
[15:49] you've seen the effects of what fathers
[15:51] have done
[15:52] and the effect of
[15:54] future generations
[15:56] and i could see how god
[16:00] could tell a man abraham and thy seed
[16:02] shall only be blessed
[16:05] god
[16:06] has this law
[16:08] this principle
[16:10] and this principle cannot change
[16:13] this is law every fee been fought after
[16:15] is kind it is law
[16:17] and if we tap into god's law
[16:20] things will become different in all eyes
[16:23] to understand of a truth god
[16:26] can't change
[16:29] whenever his people
[16:31] mess up
[16:32] rebel against
[16:34] sin against you
[16:35] there's always some king of babylon to
[16:37] take them into captivity
[16:39] and when these people repent you're
[16:41] poorly thinking about it
[16:44] god is a disciplinarian he's correct his
[16:46] children every son that commit to god
[16:48] must be tested and tried and he god
[16:52] is our example
[16:54] as a father
[16:56] as husband
[16:58] we the church to personally bride
[17:00] the true example of life whether it be
[17:04] marriage whom family is gone
[17:08] and you hear me say it many times in the
[17:10] beginning was in church all these
[17:12] daughters church wars
[17:14] and foolishness that carry on with
[17:16] ministers and churches and ministries
[17:18] and stuff
[17:19] in the beginning i had none with church
[17:21] in the beginning it was a family
[17:23] i want you to remember that tonight
[17:26] a family
[17:27] that's what the gardener is all about
[17:30] a place prepared called eden a garden
[17:34] there and then god pleased
[17:37] his son
[17:38] because that is what father does
[17:41] a father peers
[17:43] a father
[17:45] will oversight
[17:47] and see everything is fine
[17:49] i believe in one the simon's
[17:52] uh from ghana
[17:53] i can't remember who it was preaching
[17:55] about the father will see that
[17:57] everything is fixed and right by the
[17:58] helps before his fun brings his pride in
[18:02] you know it's it's it's important
[18:04] tonight
[18:06] i want to speak about fathers
[18:09] uh
[18:10] last session we had
[18:12] we spoke about parenting a story
[18:14] i want to draw more in the parent and
[18:16] but not tonight
[18:18] um because fatherhood
[18:20] and and father is part of this direction
[18:23] to effective parenting
[18:26] and i um i know that
[18:29] men we as men have certain challenges
[18:32] and um
[18:33] there's no school of fathering
[18:35] there's no school of marriage there's
[18:37] the school of being a great husband
[18:38] great wife great mother great father
[18:41] there's no school nobody teaches on that
[18:43] but yet god is there to be
[18:47] our example
[18:49] so tonight
[18:50] if you have your bibles
[18:52] i hope it doesn't come across like a
[18:53] bible teaching but i will share what's
[18:56] on my heart tonight i'd like to turn to
[18:59] two scriptures tonight
[19:00] first john chapter 2
[19:03] we want to read from 10 to 17
[19:08] i think it's okay
[19:12] i think we use that scripture
[19:14] yes
[19:15] first john chapter 2
[19:17] want to read verse 10 to 17
[19:20] and the title of what i want to share
[19:21] tonight is
[19:23] taken from in this scripture text and
[19:25] it's
[19:26] i write unto you fathers i'm taking this
[19:29] the quote from paul
[19:31] first john chapter 2
[19:34] reading from verse 10.
[19:37] he that loved his brother
[19:40] abided in the light
[19:42] and there is none
[19:44] occasion of stumbling in him
[19:47] but he that he
[19:49] hated his brother
[19:51] is in darkness
[19:53] and walk it in darkness
[19:55] and know it not whether he goes because
[19:58] darkness
[20:00] has blinded
[20:02] his eyes
[20:04] so hating someone
[20:07] hating your brother
[20:09] actually put you in darkness
[20:12] a blindness
[20:14] because forgiven and we still dear we
[20:16] haven't left there
[20:18] forgiving others and having that spirit
[20:20] of forgiveness
[20:22] it frees you
[20:24] and don't ever forget now
[20:27] we're not talking about freeing the
[20:28] other person
[20:29] who hurt you or lie about you or
[20:32] twistings concerning you and want to
[20:34] pull you down and make you look bad
[20:37] because that is evil of course there are
[20:40] people who have that kind of spirit they
[20:42] feel
[20:43] by trying to dismantle or break or shame
[20:47] or pull you down a day will get light
[20:51] that they will grow that they will bless
[20:53] them that they will try
[20:54] it doesn't work that way
[20:56] uh
[20:58] you don't grow
[20:59] blossom strife
[21:01] or shining light by trying to send
[21:03] somebody else into darkness or pulling
[21:05] somebody down
[21:07] and they control you grow
[21:09] shine light when you could pull somebody
[21:10] up
[21:11] so the bible clearly sees that this
[21:13] spirit of hatred hidden
[21:16] that person really is in darkness
[21:18] verse 12
[21:20] i write unto you little children
[21:22] because your sins are forgiven you
[21:25] for his name's sake
[21:27] i write unto you fathers
[21:29] because you have known him
[21:31] that is from the beginning
[21:33] i write unto you young men
[21:35] because you have overcome the wicked one
[21:38] i write into your little children
[21:39] because you have known the father
[21:42] i've written unto you fathers because
[21:45] you have known him that's from the
[21:46] beginning i have written unto you young
[21:48] men because you are strong
[21:50] and the word of god abides in you
[21:53] and you have overcome the wicked
[21:56] love not the world
[21:57] neither the things that are in the world
[21:59] if any man love the world the love of
[22:02] the father
[22:03] is not in him
[22:05] for all
[22:06] that is in the world
[22:09] and
[22:10] he identified three main things the lust
[22:12] of the flesh
[22:14] one
[22:15] the lust of the eyes two
[22:17] and the pride of life three
[22:19] is not of the father
[22:21] but of the world
[22:23] and the world passes away
[22:25] and the lust thereof
[22:27] but he that do it the will of god abide
[22:29] it forever
[22:30] let us pray heavenly father read your
[22:32] word
[22:33] and lord is very
[22:36] broken up tonight but i pray your fitter
[22:38] together lord and may
[22:40] it come out right
[22:42] maybe interpret it right in the hearts
[22:44] and lives of your children
[22:46] i ask that you bless this session this
[22:48] special service we call it that will
[22:51] edify and help them sons and daughters
[22:55] mothers and fathers god husbands and
[22:58] wives
[22:59] young men young women father may help
[23:00] them
[23:01] because we live in a treacherous time we
[23:03] need
[23:04] your guidance we need your knowledge
[23:06] we need your understanding
[23:08] in jesus name we ask and help us father
[23:10] amen
[23:12] god bless you thanks again
[23:15] for being here
[23:17] i might run too quickly
[23:18] the amplified of that scripture
[23:20] whosoever loves his brother believes
[23:22] abides lives in the light and it is it
[23:25] is in or in him there is no occasion or
[23:28] stumbling or cause for error or sin but
[23:31] he who hates detest
[23:34] despises his brother in christ
[23:37] now this isn't this is brethren
[23:39] he's in darkness
[23:41] and walking living in the dark
[23:44] he is strained and does not perceive or
[23:48] know where he is going because the
[23:50] darkness
[23:51] has blinded his eyes
[23:54] i am writing to you little children
[23:56] because of his namesake for his namesake
[23:58] your sins are forgiven
[24:00] pardon to his name i'm writing to your
[24:02] fathers because you have come to know
[24:06] recognize
[24:08] be aware and understand him
[24:12] who existed from the beginning i'm
[24:14] writing to you young man
[24:16] because you have been victorious over
[24:18] the wicked one i write to you boys lads
[24:21] because you have come to know
[24:23] recognized to be aware of the father
[24:26] so there are four classes here really
[24:28] the children the lads the young men and
[24:31] the fathers
[24:33] i write you fathers verse 14 this is
[24:35] amplified because you have come to know
[24:37] recognize or be conscious of and
[24:39] understand him who existed from the
[24:41] beginning i write to you young men
[24:43] because you are strong and vigorous in
[24:45] the word of god
[24:46] always abiding in you in your heart
[24:49] and you have been victorious over the
[24:51] wicked one
[24:52] do not love or cherish the world
[24:55] or the things that are in the world
[24:57] if anyone loves the world love for the
[25:00] father is not in him
[25:02] wow
[25:04] for all this in the world
[25:06] the lusts of the flesh
[25:08] craving for sensual gratification
[25:11] the lust of the eyes
[25:13] greedy
[25:14] longings of the mind
[25:17] and the pride of life
[25:19] assurance
[25:21] in one own resources
[25:24] or
[25:25] in the stability of eighty things these
[25:29] do not come from the father
[25:31] but are from the world itself
[25:34] and they will pass it away
[25:36] and disappears
[25:37] and with it the forbidden cravings the
[25:40] passionate desires the lust of it but he
[25:43] who does the will of god and carries out
[25:46] his purpose
[25:47] in his life
[25:49] abides
[25:51] and remains
[25:52] forever
[25:55] one of the difficulty with us males men
[25:59] we
[26:01] i don't know if it's pride or what that
[26:03] but many times we don't
[26:05] ask
[26:06] for help
[26:09] we don't
[26:11] seek
[26:12] help
[26:14] many times i see for my own self
[26:17] i see brothers men
[26:19] act arrogant act like they know it all
[26:22] and see them get what you call a bump
[26:23] head
[26:25] because that is what happens eventually
[26:27] when you don't know
[26:29] and
[26:31] not just don't know but don't understand
[26:35] and when i was in school
[26:37] i had problems with mathematics
[26:40] and there was this boy strange enough
[26:42] he's one of the guys that have never
[26:43] forgotten his name
[26:44] he had a mole on his face and he used to
[26:46] become out of his mouth but he was
[26:48] bright
[26:49] he could deal with mathematics
[26:52] and either ask him to help me and he
[26:54] said help me do it and help me do it
[26:56] and then i
[26:58] because i just wasn't getting the key to
[27:00] it
[27:01] and then i decided to go it over slowly
[27:05] because i wanted to do it
[27:08] for myself
[27:10] and when i
[27:11] crack it
[27:13] and i begin to understand it
[27:16] the formulas that has to be used and
[27:18] everything else then i actually got a
[27:21] love for mathematics
[27:23] and i went further to do additional
[27:25] mathematics
[27:26] i so love new mathematics
[27:28] but the joy was getting the key to it
[27:32] and this is what i see in life if you
[27:35] don't get the key
[27:37] it's hard
[27:38] to unlock
[27:40] the doors
[27:42] so
[27:43] many times
[27:45] a lot of things are caught than taught
[27:49] you catch it you see it and then you can
[27:51] have it
[27:52] sometime back i think we spoke a
[27:54] scripture i think it was in proverbs 24
[27:57] we talk about what a house is built on
[27:59] and we identify the three things
[28:02] knowledge understanding and wisdom
[28:05] knowledge being the information part
[28:07] understanding being the comprehension
[28:09] part and wisdom to put it together
[28:11] effectively the highest one of course is
[28:13] wisdom
[28:14] that's how we're supposed to dwell in
[28:15] our house in our lives in our homes in
[28:18] operation with wisdom
[28:20] but it is very hard to be assigned a
[28:22] task
[28:23] and you don't know how to do this task
[28:26] it's very hard
[28:28] to be in a position and you don't even
[28:30] know what you're called to be in that
[28:31] position
[28:33] because life
[28:35] real life
[28:37] and fulfillment in life
[28:40] comes when you could catch a revelation
[28:42] of your purpose
[28:44] when you don't know what you are born
[28:46] for called for called to do
[28:49] you're just doing stuff you're doing
[28:51] things with no aim little mark
[28:54] jesus
[28:56] you could see that he was determined
[28:58] you could see he had a clear vision
[29:00] and he could say these words i must be
[29:03] about my father's business
[29:05] he was dedicated and devoted
[29:07] because he understood
[29:09] that he was called to do this thing
[29:13] do you understand
[29:15] what you are called to do
[29:17] and i see all of this as a backdrop of
[29:19] this thing called father
[29:21] what is father
[29:24] and just the title i write unto you
[29:26] and i was thinking how could i present
[29:29] this i know
[29:30] this is not detailed it might be more
[29:32] general but i still feel
[29:34] it needs to be spoken
[29:37] because there's no school of fathers and
[29:40] fatherhood
[29:41] and what a father supposed to be and
[29:43] what a father is supposed to be like and
[29:45] what happens when the father is not dear
[29:47] what happened when there's no father in
[29:49] the house
[29:51] what happens to the children what
[29:52] happens to their lives what happened to
[29:54] their focus what happened to their
[29:55] vision
[29:57] this is something else when you really
[30:00] think it through
[30:01] because a father
[30:03] is not someone who has children
[30:07] children
[30:08] is because
[30:10] you know you have a relationship and a
[30:11] child is born but a child being born or
[30:15] booted of a mother that receives seed
[30:17] from father
[30:18] is not that doesn't make the man a
[30:19] father
[30:20] let's call him for in our internal
[30:22] purpose tonight
[30:24] dad
[30:26] a dad
[30:28] but father is much more than just being
[30:31] you know that's my child
[30:34] because you have people who are have the
[30:36] office
[30:37] or have the title
[30:39] but don't have the function
[30:41] of father
[30:44] because father carries the weight
[30:47] of having a real
[30:48] function no sisters here you might say
[30:52] well what am i doing this meeting the
[30:53] night talking about men talking about
[30:55] father wait a minute hold it hold it
[30:56] hold it good
[30:59] don't do nothing you can just sign off
[31:01] no side not yet don't sign sides
[31:05] a man can be a father without a woman
[31:11] the only way he could be a father is to
[31:12] have a wife a woman or whatever it is
[31:14] that's how he becomes a father
[31:18] and
[31:19] i want you to see it a little deeper
[31:22] not just as father like husband
[31:26] but father
[31:28] that affects
[31:30] and infects
[31:32] generations
[31:34] because this is what is striking me more
[31:36] than ever
[31:37] not just oh that's what our father is
[31:39] supposed to be
[31:40] understand this
[31:42] that you
[31:44] males here tonight
[31:47] your picture of men or male
[31:50] or father
[31:52] has been influenced by your father or no
[31:55] father
[31:56] in other words
[31:57] what we live now
[32:00] is part of being influenced it affected
[32:04] our lives
[32:05] let me see if i could bring it down like
[32:06] this
[32:07] on saturday past
[32:09] we had a zoom memorial for my mother who
[32:13] passed away two years ago
[32:15] on on saturday that date
[32:18] and um
[32:20] i had a meeting with my family and told
[32:23] them
[32:24] i want to do this
[32:26] with an eye of posterity
[32:28] i want
[32:30] when the grandchildren get of age many
[32:32] of them wouldn't know her
[32:34] they could listen
[32:36] and cut something from
[32:38] what was shared
[32:39] about my
[32:40] mother and amazingly
[32:44] i hear my brothers all them almost
[32:45] saying the same thing
[32:48] so what was done
[32:50] was we asked them to make like a
[32:52] recording
[32:53] and we stitch it together
[32:55] and play it back in his room meeting
[32:57] himself
[32:59] and
[33:00] what was interesting is how
[33:03] they could say
[33:05] we never saw my mother and father fight
[33:08] they never saw my mother and father that
[33:10] have an argument
[33:12] and these are things i will tell my own
[33:14] children my own sons
[33:16] of what i saw
[33:18] one time my father got an accident and
[33:22] he broke his hand he put a steel in his
[33:23] hand and after that i had us to help him
[33:26] carry the basket to go to the market
[33:29] to buy market goods
[33:31] and as a child
[33:34] that is how i learn
[33:35] you know to check tomatoes and you know
[33:38] i enjoy making i don't know i still love
[33:39] going to the market i like to see the
[33:40] fresh goods and everything else pick and
[33:43] choose quality
[33:44] stuff
[33:46] and what i realize
[33:49] is that and one of my brothers he's 43
[33:51] years my marriage next one i have so
[33:52] much years i mean i have so many years
[33:54] or 40 years and so like that and what i
[33:56] realized is that
[33:58] the influence of our parents
[34:02] had a profound
[34:04] effect on the meal
[34:07] men
[34:08] in our whole food
[34:11] let me say that again
[34:12] the influence
[34:14] of how we saw
[34:16] our mother and father how they operate
[34:18] now is 12 children okay
[34:21] it was tough
[34:22] it was not easy
[34:24] but the reality is this we saw something
[34:27] of value
[34:29] something that we cherished
[34:31] and i
[34:32] didn't know that they saw the same thing
[34:35] i would talk to it
[34:37] and talk about it
[34:38] but to hear my other brothers who i've
[34:41] never heard them speak about
[34:43] this is the first time i'm hearing their
[34:45] story
[34:46] and they saying almost the same thing it
[34:49] speaks
[34:50] volumes to me
[34:53] no
[34:56] my mother said you know those who marry
[34:58] are sons they get good men
[35:04] my brother was saying
[35:06] when he was 10 years old
[35:09] my mother called him in the kitchen to
[35:10] show him how to cook
[35:12] i want to teach him how to cook
[35:14] because she says she don't wanna know
[35:16] woman nick style on them and that's why
[35:17] you say all the boys could cook
[35:19] so this is just a digress into the whole
[35:21] thing so i told them i wasn't there for
[35:23] that part i wasn't there as i learned to
[35:25] cook after i resigned after i retired
[35:28] and i was so pleased when i could bring
[35:30] a whole
[35:31] lunch to my wife that i cook from start
[35:33] to finish i was very pleased with myself
[35:36] i wanted to do that it was in my heart
[35:39] and since then so she thought when i
[35:41] asked canada what to do with here oh you
[35:42] do it how are you doing i was just
[35:43] asking what i wasn't asking i was asking
[35:45] because i want to i want to get to do it
[35:47] myself but this is just beside me but i
[35:49] want to see this
[35:51] that our lives today
[35:54] are because of what has been influenced
[35:57] around us
[35:59] what pictures we hold
[36:02] what pictures we see
[36:04] and in going forward
[36:06] our children
[36:08] would be affected
[36:10] by what they see
[36:13] not by what we say so much
[36:16] but by
[36:18] how we live
[36:19] and and how we operate and so on like
[36:21] that
[36:22] so there's a challenge on tonight
[36:24] i write unto you fathers
[36:27] and because
[36:29] there is no book or manual on fatherhood
[36:32] it is
[36:33] good
[36:34] if we could have a talk or conversation
[36:37] uh very well but the classes tell me you
[36:38] know to be good if we have some
[36:40] interactive ones like this session like
[36:42] a session and i think that would be so
[36:44] great i'd want to have that sometime in
[36:46] the future where you could ask questions
[36:49] you could
[36:50] inquire
[36:51] and you know and it would be so helpful
[36:55] if we could share
[36:56] you know something like this and and so
[36:58] on and get questions get feedbacks and
[37:00] so on
[37:01] so i know i'll be kind of going off
[37:03] track but i will continue okay all right
[37:07] so i'll just get down now
[37:10] all right so i have here written here
[37:12] not because the father is in the house
[37:14] his father
[37:17] that he is actually doing the work of a
[37:19] father
[37:21] father is not a title
[37:24] it's a rule
[37:26] or function
[37:29] we have to know
[37:33] that we don't
[37:34] know all what we're supposed to know
[37:38] and as long as we open up ourselves
[37:41] for the right kind of knowledge
[37:44] the right kind of information we can get
[37:46] the help
[37:47] that we
[37:48] need
[37:50] and sometimes
[37:53] you say
[37:54] studying or reading or trying to get
[37:56] information it's kind of hard
[37:59] it's tough
[38:00] but
[38:02] we know for sure for a fact
[38:05] the cost of ignorance is very high
[38:09] it's better you seek
[38:11] knowledge
[38:12] it's better you seek after
[38:14] the knowledge that will benefit you and
[38:16] grow grow you i see so much destruction
[38:19] today
[38:20] and it could get you and that is why
[38:22] this
[38:23] day of information misinformation
[38:25] disinformation and everybody who have a
[38:28] phone is like a voice everybody who have
[38:30] a phone that could do facebook and
[38:33] whatsapp or whatever it is they like uh
[38:35] they like a missionary
[38:36] even if they can't talk they could
[38:38] forward something that somebody forward
[38:39] to them so they are forwarders and so on
[38:42] they don't have to be the original
[38:43] makers of it they could just be the
[38:45] forwarders of
[38:47] this is the age we're living in
[38:49] but you have to know
[38:52] how
[38:53] you are benefiting
[38:55] as a christian
[38:57] as a believer
[38:58] here's what
[39:01] i was thinking about paul how paul said
[39:03] i died dearly this is a christian i'm
[39:05] unfair with the holy ghost why does he
[39:07] have to die there you want to study that
[39:10] why a prophet
[39:12] messenger that the pillar of fire holy
[39:15] ghost filled have the same idea
[39:18] what i realized
[39:20] is that
[39:22] it's almost like some christians believe
[39:25] that when they give their heart to the
[39:27] lord
[39:28] get baptized in jesus name
[39:30] go to church
[39:32] problems solve
[39:34] every day where jesus is sweeter than
[39:36] they before sure
[39:37] but the reality is
[39:40] i'm beginning to understand more and
[39:41] more and that is why we are so much a
[39:43] twisted
[39:45] and
[39:46] challenged people in church
[39:48] that that believes
[39:50] and yet
[39:52] the lines are not as it's supposed to be
[39:55] now the reason i talk about sisters hold
[39:57] on those are not yet because we talk
[39:59] about male and men and fathers and so on
[40:01] is because
[40:03] a lot of
[40:05] men
[40:07] have been influenced
[40:09] if i could use the word negatively by
[40:11] their mothers
[40:13] i'm not talking about you here tonight
[40:16] i'm talking about
[40:18] i talking about love them to smother
[40:21] them
[40:22] mother's thinking is love but it's not
[40:24] really love they love to smother
[40:28] and they actually affect
[40:31] the men
[40:32] or male
[40:33] from becoming the man that is supposed
[40:35] to become
[40:37] because
[40:39] they choose to use
[40:42] their mommy power
[40:44] or
[40:44] mother power
[40:46] for manipulation and influence
[40:49] many times against the father
[40:52] i'm not talking
[40:55] like i read it in a book
[40:58] i'm talking because i'm aware of this as
[41:00] real
[41:02] and so real it's just scary
[41:06] because i often tell my wife i cannot
[41:09] understand
[41:11] the whole that i see some of these
[41:13] mothers have on their sons
[41:15] now i know mother and son have a good
[41:17] connection father and daughter have a
[41:18] great connection but i'm talking about
[41:21] it is said from a psychological
[41:23] standpoint the children
[41:26] of course because of that maternal thing
[41:28] stick to the mud in the beginning but
[41:30] they grew towards the father
[41:32] that is how it is that is how like
[41:34] nature have it the surrender they up
[41:37] under the mother and so on very
[41:38] nurturing and caring and so on but they
[41:41] actually grow towards the father
[41:44] so when
[41:45] a mother
[41:46] especially if she has
[41:49] um
[41:51] a conflict or issues with the that the
[41:54] husband
[41:55] and then the children becomes
[41:58] a weapon
[42:00] the children becomes a tool
[42:02] a tool of manipulation
[42:05] and when that is used
[42:07] the children get caught up in the
[42:10] crossfire
[42:11] of two adults
[42:13] that should know better
[42:15] or i could say could know better
[42:18] or could have learned to do better
[42:21] and then the result is
[42:24] confused children
[42:27] grow up
[42:29] becomes adults
[42:31] and these folks get married
[42:34] be a wife
[42:36] be it husband
[42:38] and then in their own relationship
[42:41] they find they have certain challenges
[42:45] challenges
[42:46] because of what was
[42:48] displayed
[42:49] or unfolded
[42:51] and then you get now a next generation
[42:54] of manipulators and there's a whole next
[42:56] section already i have to get in that
[42:57] some point in time only recently just
[42:59] two days ago i was talked to my wife
[43:00] about it about these kind of
[43:02] manipulating women
[43:04] and um it's almost evil almost and
[43:07] especially if your husband's a christian
[43:09] if your husband servant the lord and
[43:12] anything like that there should be no
[43:14] way
[43:15] the clearance should be uh
[43:17] the effect of the father is made unknown
[43:20] because of the mother i've seen it with
[43:22] my own eyes
[43:23] i've seen it
[43:25] and it is terrible it is terrible
[43:27] because that is not what god pleased in
[43:29] the beginning
[43:30] in the beginning
[43:31] god
[43:33] he created man in his own image and
[43:35] likeness
[43:36] spirit man
[43:37] he put a dust man we know and put that
[43:40] spirit man that dustman and that me was
[43:42] added
[43:44] and that body of dust is what god used
[43:47] to pull out
[43:48] this next man that he called woman
[43:51] as somebody say a man with a womb okay
[43:54] still man
[43:55] that's what god made original man
[43:59] and when you think about it
[44:01] when eve
[44:03] who
[44:04] god did not speak to
[44:08] spoke to adam
[44:09] according to leave a word
[44:11] so his adam is the one
[44:13] who told eve about the tree
[44:16] because that's what adam was called to
[44:18] do
[44:19] to give eve the word
[44:21] when eve took up that tree when she gave
[44:23] her husband everything folder
[44:26] and then you beg to wonder
[44:28] the bible never speaks about the sins of
[44:31] the mother
[44:32] or the sins
[44:34] of the mother it's sick so talk about
[44:36] the sins of the father
[44:40] we as fathers male men
[44:43] we will be held
[44:45] accountable
[44:47] let me see it
[44:48] again we as male
[44:51] men
[44:53] would be held accountable
[44:56] and that's the fact
[44:58] so stop blaming your wife
[45:01] stop blaming this one and that one you
[45:04] as a male right now when you look back
[45:06] and see what was absent in your life and
[45:08] how you could get the help now
[45:11] and how god wants to help you know
[45:12] because if anybody talk about father was
[45:14] jesus
[45:16] jesus was the father man i owe you that
[45:17] because my father my father work and i
[45:19] work and jesus is going on that broadway
[45:22] too
[45:22] it's not me that glorifying myself it's
[45:24] my father that this my father my father
[45:26] my father my father
[45:29] even to pray he said our father
[45:33] jesus
[45:34] was
[45:36] who i call an example seed son
[45:39] and that example son demonstrated
[45:43] that
[45:44] he truly reflected the father so in
[45:47] other words
[45:48] the real
[45:50] father-son connection how it's supposed
[45:53] to be
[45:54] is that the father the son
[45:56] supposed to be a genuine reflection of
[45:58] the father or give the lord some praise
[46:01] this is how it's supposed to be
[46:03] in this originality
[46:05] that the sun
[46:06] so
[46:08] so when when when when philip asked show
[46:10] us the father
[46:12] it almost appears as jesus was stunned
[46:15] because he said for so long oh how long
[46:17] i was you
[46:19] when you see me
[46:21] what he was seeing is the operation of
[46:23] the reflection of my father
[46:26] and then even my father are one
[46:29] so what
[46:31] was to be
[46:32] is that the sun
[46:35] represented
[46:36] the next generation
[46:39] glory hallelujah the next generation
[46:43] that would carry on this fatherhood
[46:46] thing
[46:48] i don't want you to see it as just
[46:49] father
[46:50] i want your seat as fatherhood god i
[46:53] want you to see seed of the righteous i
[46:55] want you to see how god is pushing down
[46:58] righteous seed especially when he
[47:00] notices a sip and seed that is
[47:02] multiplying and taking over the eat
[47:05] or give the lord some praises for that
[47:08] hallelujah
[47:10] so really and truly
[47:14] the devil's job
[47:16] is not really
[47:18] even at the romanian
[47:21] the devil's job is to see how we could
[47:23] chew down the man
[47:25] this meal
[47:27] man notice
[47:29] lucy for not stupid
[47:31] he didn't go to adam i don't go talk to
[47:33] you come come come come on talk to you
[47:35] yeah i'm under my dog that tree talking
[47:37] about that tree he's not sure enough he
[47:40] never didn't do that
[47:42] the devil knew better
[47:44] to
[47:45] approach that original seed son called
[47:47] adam
[47:48] so he approached it by product
[47:50] he approached a woman he approached a
[47:52] female and to the female he chewed on
[47:55] the meal
[47:56] that this day he's still using females
[47:59] to chew on who the male
[48:02] he's still using females to destroy
[48:04] family marriage wrecks and everything
[48:06] else to try to get the mail off track
[48:08] because if they may get off track the
[48:10] home get off track the family get off
[48:12] track and then the next generation that
[48:14] i want to get to
[48:16] gets off track
[48:19] how do we get that contract how do we
[48:21] get back in line how do we get back to
[48:24] get the course of where
[48:27] of where we supposed to be as male as
[48:30] men because right now
[48:32] you know with this gender benefiting
[48:34] they have in america and they bend in
[48:36] the gender and they're trying to say
[48:37] things that go they see
[48:39] and and and all kind of
[48:41] it's crazy it's just sodom and steroids
[48:45] but the point about it is this
[48:47] there's a crisis
[48:49] in men
[48:51] at the educational level
[48:53] at the job level
[48:55] qualification level is the crisis
[48:59] and if systems
[49:01] could catch
[49:04] and see
[49:06] the seriousness of this challenge
[49:10] that is before men and before us
[49:13] they could rewire their thinking
[49:16] as to how to give
[49:18] the correct
[49:19] support
[49:20] for the husbands
[49:22] and the correct support for fatherhood
[49:26] because you find people say don't touch
[49:27] me don't talk to my child because that
[49:28] is your child is that right
[49:31] some women believe that the child is
[49:32] their own alone
[49:34] i make it is that right
[49:38] you make it
[49:40] understand this says
[49:42] you were the incubator
[49:45] but the man carries the seed
[49:48] god designed that way
[49:52] that true male
[49:54] seed is released and that's why that
[49:57] that father
[49:58] becomes
[49:59] like the author
[50:02] hallelujah
[50:03] the author of a generation
[50:06] the author
[50:08] that is where it
[50:10] begins like i have we have a family uh
[50:14] whatsapp group called it your clan
[50:17] that's that's my tribe
[50:20] so and they have
[50:21] isaac idiom and andrew and their wives
[50:24] and everything else that's that's my
[50:25] tribe
[50:27] so when we want everybody to know
[50:28] something
[50:29] it's put there in the teal clan
[50:32] because it's not our next clan called
[50:33] the over clan that is at my level not my
[50:35] brothers and sisters that's another come
[50:37] out again
[50:39] so the thing of it is
[50:42] god
[50:44] and that is why
[50:46] god could say
[50:48] that
[50:48] um your seed thy seed will possess the
[50:51] gates of those that hate them because
[50:54] remember
[50:56] what we carries like four generations
[51:00] remember
[51:02] i've been here
[51:03] was resident and
[51:05] great great grandfather
[51:07] that is what we are taught
[51:10] you you follow him saying
[51:12] um he said levi peterson abram was four
[51:14] generations back
[51:16] but god saw that dear
[51:18] so you wasn't just ops because you have
[51:20] a grandfather he was even before that
[51:23] as a seed
[51:24] that god ordained to be on this earth at
[51:27] this point in time
[51:29] wow
[51:30] i hope this helping somebody tonight
[51:33] praise the lord
[51:36] so
[51:39] you know
[51:43] jesus
[51:46] it might look strange and and this is
[51:48] one of the examples
[51:49] that
[51:50] and this is where we have to admit where
[51:52] we need help
[51:53] i need help in my marriage
[51:56] i need help
[51:57] in my relationship i need help as a
[51:59] father
[52:00] i need help as a husband
[52:03] i need help i need help
[52:06] sometimes we need to identify what help
[52:09] we need
[52:12] you heard a blind man with jesus
[52:14] the man is blind
[52:16] and jesus asked the blind man what did
[52:17] you see by man what do you want me to do
[52:19] for you
[52:23] float my sight
[52:25] because sometimes you might see
[52:26] something that and think it is obvious
[52:28] but that doesn't mean that they want
[52:29] that
[52:32] so
[52:33] if the question is asked to you tonight
[52:36] what do you want me to do for you not me
[52:37] for you me jesus
[52:40] what would you tell him
[52:42] do you want
[52:44] a greater knowledge a greater
[52:45] understanding because if you don't
[52:47] understand what you read or understand
[52:48] what you
[52:49] hear
[52:50] it is you can't act on it you can't
[52:53] possess it you can't claim it because
[52:55] you don't understand it you need to
[52:57] understand it
[52:59] and when you understand it then other
[53:01] thing could open up to you
[53:04] if
[53:05] let's say it this way
[53:10] i'm talking to you to the father's you
[53:12] know this is a special point
[53:16] if in your father's home
[53:19] you are allowed
[53:21] to do whatever you want to do
[53:24] that's how the host grow
[53:26] this one do what they want i wonder what
[53:27] they want i wonder everybody at the
[53:28] freedom
[53:30] when your turn come and you get married
[53:34] the example that was around you
[53:37] your environment and example will be
[53:39] everybody do what you want
[53:41] when you have your children
[53:44] the tendency will be to do the same
[53:47] let them do
[53:49] what they want
[53:52] and
[53:53] you have a next generation
[53:56] and you let them do what they want and
[53:57] you see a bunch of slackers and
[53:59] characters and everything else
[54:01] because sometimes the child really
[54:03] crying out for discipline they try kind
[54:05] of a help they may be 17 18 19 20. and
[54:08] you because your father never
[54:11] disciplined you or corrected you or
[54:12] straightened you out
[54:14] you should be a big man you you you make
[54:16] a choice
[54:17] like i know
[54:18] there's some people glad when the
[54:19] children of age you have age you have
[54:21] age and that your age is not just
[54:23] telling you of age is you are saying you
[54:26] have age because you don't want to
[54:28] accept responsibility to discipline the
[54:30] guy to teach to lead and this is what
[54:33] father
[54:36] does i always do that which pleases my
[54:39] father
[54:41] jesus own words
[54:42] your father is there to correct
[54:45] protect
[54:46] provide
[54:47] guide
[54:48] teach
[54:50] read
[54:51] what we find out you find out men
[54:53] telling the children go to your mother
[54:59] let your mother deal with that
[55:03] men who supposed to take lead keep
[55:06] sending the children to their
[55:08] mother
[55:10] maybe that is why the mother have a such
[55:12] a grip over some of these sons and bind
[55:14] them to herself
[55:16] and then when the father looking
[55:17] together woody
[55:19] want to hear this one
[55:20] you listen to his mother and your mother
[55:22] awfully beaten back
[55:26] i don't mean to be offensive i'm not
[55:28] trying to king anybody but i'm trying to
[55:30] bring a point
[55:31] this is real
[55:33] so sometimes coming to church and you
[55:35] think everything is over
[55:37] and you see people in church
[55:39] get divorced
[55:41] people in the message they divorce and
[55:43] marriages break up and everything else
[55:44] right there and they claim to believe
[55:46] personal prophet and whatnot
[55:48] because
[55:50] it has things to do in applying with
[55:52] marriage
[55:53] with life
[55:55] with love it says it has certain
[55:57] principles
[55:58] that we have to keep
[56:00] that that to ensure that things not be
[56:02] broken
[56:04] and and these principles are universal
[56:07] come on god said love the lord okay i'll
[56:09] i'll get on into something this is one
[56:10] that blew my mind when i was reading it
[56:13] studying it this one blew my mind okay
[56:18] if you have your bibles
[56:19] i wanted to the first kings too i know
[56:21] another bible study but this one is so
[56:23] good
[56:24] and this is how our father talks to us
[56:28] first kings chapter 2
[56:30] you want to read verse 1 to 4.
[56:33] this is father
[56:35] and his father is david
[56:37] he's talking to his son
[56:39] his son is solomon
[56:42] now david
[56:43] had his share of fears
[56:46] had a fear of drama
[56:48] had a share of life
[56:51] his son
[56:52] and we know through that relationship
[56:54] with bathsheba who was you know
[56:56] outside woman as we would say
[56:59] but god
[57:01] and
[57:02] work out stuff
[57:03] so he has this son called solomon
[57:06] listen to this ruth
[57:08] now the days of david drew 9
[57:10] that he should die
[57:13] and he charged solomon his son's sin
[57:17] i go the way of all the earth
[57:21] be those strong therefore
[57:23] and show thyself
[57:25] a man now that is man talking
[57:29] that is father talking there
[57:31] guys and her father who
[57:33] backs them on his bed and he ain't worse
[57:36] than he said oh god
[57:38] cried
[57:45] this is david
[57:47] david is leaving
[57:50] these are his passing words
[57:52] he's talking to his son
[57:55] solomon
[57:56] the first thing he tells the man is show
[57:58] yourself a man
[58:03] dobby vampish
[58:07] don't be immature
[58:10] show yourself
[58:11] come on let's continue
[58:16] how you do that
[58:18] and keep
[58:20] the charge of the lord
[58:23] thy god
[58:24] to walk
[58:26] in his ways
[58:27] to keep
[58:29] his statutes
[58:30] and his commandments
[58:32] and his judgment
[58:34] and his testimony as it is written in
[58:37] the law of moses
[58:39] that
[58:41] though mayors prosper
[58:43] in all the dodust
[58:46] and whatever so ever though to this thy
[58:48] self
[58:50] here's why
[58:52] here's why it was four
[58:54] that the lord
[58:56] may continue his word
[58:59] which he speak
[59:00] concerning me saying
[59:02] if
[59:03] thy children
[59:05] take heed to their way
[59:08] to walk before me in truth
[59:10] with all their heart
[59:12] with all their souls
[59:14] they shall not feel thee said he a man
[59:17] on the throne of israel
[59:21] so david is telling solomon solomon
[59:24] god spoke to me
[59:26] but you got to do something
[59:28] for him to continue this word he spoke i
[59:32] want you
[59:33] to walk in his ways
[59:35] to do his judgment and his laws and i
[59:37] love him and everything else
[59:40] that is
[59:42] father
[59:43] talking to sir
[59:46] now
[59:46] [Music]
[59:48] if
[59:50] you are not prepared
[59:53] to shepherd
[59:55] or father by example
[59:58] you can't talk like that
[1:00:01] you can't tell your son
[1:00:04] do as i say but not as i do you know you
[1:00:06] know some people say that don't do don't
[1:00:08] do what i do you know but do what i see
[1:00:11] you're saying the right thing
[1:00:13] but you're not doing the right thing
[1:00:16] therefore
[1:00:17] how could you expect it to come out
[1:00:19] right
[1:00:20] because what you see and what you do
[1:00:23] have to line up
[1:00:25] what you see and what you do have to
[1:00:27] come in harmony
[1:00:28] for it to be effective
[1:00:31] and i want you to be conscious of that i
[1:00:33] am not talking about just here
[1:00:35] i'm talking about what affects
[1:00:37] generations
[1:00:39] i'm seeing that
[1:00:40] that you'll get a broader picture
[1:00:43] a broader picture to see
[1:00:45] how these brethren
[1:00:47] how they refer to things
[1:00:49] so therefore you have to have
[1:00:51] and this is the scripture that we read
[1:00:53] last time proverbs 24 3-4 says true
[1:00:56] wisdom
[1:00:57] is a house builded
[1:00:59] and by understanding it is established
[1:01:03] and by knowledge
[1:01:05] shall the chain must be filled all
[1:01:07] precious
[1:01:09] and present riches
[1:01:11] so three things identify
[1:01:13] knowledge
[1:01:15] understanding
[1:01:17] and wisdom
[1:01:18] wisdom we identify is applied knowledge
[1:01:22] if you have the knowledge and you have
[1:01:23] the comprehension or the understanding
[1:01:24] of it you're still messed up you still
[1:01:26] don't
[1:01:27] because you don't understand
[1:01:29] you know become like making a cake you
[1:01:31] don't pelt an egg in a bowl and you
[1:01:34] spell some flour and you tell thing and
[1:01:35] you put and bake it no there's a process
[1:01:38] there's an understanding what taking
[1:01:40] place there's a knowledge so you go to a
[1:01:42] recipe book
[1:01:44] and you see you need two eggs
[1:01:47] beaten
[1:01:48] two pounds of flour
[1:01:50] you see some essence you need this you
[1:01:52] need butter you need to figure out
[1:01:53] whatever it is and then now you have the
[1:01:56] understanding to say the process be the
[1:01:58] eggs do this first mix put it in the
[1:02:00] mixer blend it on different things and
[1:02:02] then when you come to a certain stage
[1:02:03] you put in the prunes and put it in this
[1:02:05] that and you bake it any of them at a
[1:02:07] temperature of 350 degrees for 30
[1:02:10] minutes at all complicated
[1:02:12] now if
[1:02:13] you don't have the knowledge
[1:02:15] and you do have the understanding
[1:02:18] and you don't get the formula right
[1:02:20] and you take it and bake it for
[1:02:23] five oh you get a toast
[1:02:26] you you get a cake
[1:02:27] you get something hard
[1:02:29] you know and rocky and you can't even
[1:02:31] digest that but the thing about it that
[1:02:34] is what
[1:02:34] the understanding is for that is what
[1:02:37] the comprehension is therefore and that
[1:02:39] is i trust god help us help us that we
[1:02:41] will understand that the next generation
[1:02:44] is dependent upon us
[1:02:45] and if we don't have fathers some of you
[1:02:47] may not have your father some of you you
[1:02:50] know never had that image when they had
[1:02:52] a picture we could draw pictures we
[1:02:54] could draw an image from christ
[1:02:56] we have other brothers or fathers that
[1:02:58] are examples that we could draw from and
[1:03:00] we could understand that it is dear
[1:03:02] because god is the father
[1:03:04] and that title uh you call our father
[1:03:07] and and and to think that god
[1:03:10] blessed us with the privilege of getting
[1:03:12] this title of father just like him
[1:03:15] just like him a title
[1:03:17] you know
[1:03:18] so father is there to teach but guess
[1:03:21] what you can't teach what you have not
[1:03:22] learned
[1:03:24] you cannot give what you do not have
[1:03:27] and it's very very very unfortunate
[1:03:30] that there are many brothers
[1:03:33] who
[1:03:34] have not grown as they could have grown
[1:03:37] they have not
[1:03:38] been wholly supposed to be
[1:03:41] not because
[1:03:42] they don't love the lord not because
[1:03:44] they don't believe they believe they
[1:03:46] love the lord they serve in the lord
[1:03:48] but
[1:03:49] they didn't really apply themselves to
[1:03:51] knowledge they didn't apply themselves
[1:03:53] their heart to wisdom they didn't apply
[1:03:55] this enough to the understanding of the
[1:03:57] role and function
[1:03:58] that they've been called into
[1:04:00] so you come like you get a job and you
[1:04:01] sit down there but i'm talking about
[1:04:02] that and you didn't didn't ask what am i
[1:04:05] here for
[1:04:07] what
[1:04:08] am i called to do
[1:04:10] you sit down
[1:04:11] you're waiting and you're saying nobody
[1:04:13] tell me nobody ain't nobody else
[1:04:15] anything then
[1:04:17] you will not get enough to say no what
[1:04:19] am i supposed to do here you want me to
[1:04:20] clean here you want to do this here you
[1:04:22] know what you're getting to find out
[1:04:24] you're seeking after him he's seeking
[1:04:26] his will that's why i said love not the
[1:04:28] world because that's gonna pass away but
[1:04:30] he that do it the will how do you get
[1:04:33] the will of god if you're not getting it
[1:04:35] through the word of god if you're not
[1:04:37] seeking god need knowledge of god to get
[1:04:39] the will of god because it's a will of
[1:04:40] god for your life it's not the will for
[1:04:42] your sister life or a better life
[1:04:44] because god stuff is customized for you
[1:04:47] the individual you cannot take your
[1:04:50] sister's operation or brother's
[1:04:52] operation and say that is what you're
[1:04:53] going to do too
[1:04:54] you
[1:04:55] cannot be lazy looking to loaf on
[1:04:57] somebody else's testimony you want your
[1:04:59] own testimony so you have to have your
[1:05:01] own burden to find out what
[1:05:04] god's will is for your life
[1:05:06] now proverbs 1 8 says my son hear the
[1:05:10] instruction of thy father
[1:05:12] and forsake not
[1:05:13] the law of thy mother hear what the
[1:05:16] instructions
[1:05:17] do you
[1:05:18] as a father give instructions
[1:05:21] or do you let your sons do what they
[1:05:22] want to do
[1:05:24] your doctors do what they want to do
[1:05:26] okay and then afterwards somebody
[1:05:27] complain look what your son do look what
[1:05:29] you're doing to do look doesn't do one
[1:05:30] do i do but if you instruct them
[1:05:33] or do you wait for them to come in age
[1:05:35] 21 or 18 and say well yeah big man no go
[1:05:37] to your house
[1:05:39] listen to this genesis 18
[1:05:42] 17-19
[1:05:44] this is god about to judge serum
[1:05:48] god about to bring destruction just like
[1:05:50] he come into america
[1:05:51] rome
[1:05:52] behold it
[1:05:55] god come down to abraham verse 17 of
[1:05:57] genesis 18 and the lord said shall i
[1:05:59] hear from abraham
[1:06:00] that thing
[1:06:02] which i do
[1:06:04] seeing that abraham surely shall surely
[1:06:07] become a great and mighty nation
[1:06:09] so god talking to abraham
[1:06:12] god is seeing generations down the road
[1:06:15] even a nation
[1:06:16] and all the nation of the earth shall be
[1:06:18] blessed in him
[1:06:20] hear why
[1:06:22] hear what god knew about him
[1:06:25] for i know him
[1:06:26] watch watch watch i know him
[1:06:29] hear what he will do that he will
[1:06:31] command
[1:06:32] his children
[1:06:34] and his household after him
[1:06:37] and they shall keep the way of the lord
[1:06:40] to do justice and judgment that the lord
[1:06:43] may bring upon abraham that which he had
[1:06:46] spoken of him we'll give the lord some
[1:06:48] praise
[1:06:49] oh hallelujah praise god but
[1:06:52] god said i know him
[1:06:53] i know what this man will do hear what
[1:06:55] he will do
[1:06:56] he will command
[1:06:58] his children
[1:07:00] and
[1:07:01] his household after him
[1:07:03] that they shall keep
[1:07:05] the way of the lord
[1:07:07] have you commanded your children
[1:07:10] do you understand
[1:07:12] part of what this father role is
[1:07:16] that even when they reach 18 20 20 30
[1:07:19] especially if they know in yours
[1:07:22] in your house
[1:07:24] if they want to do their own thing
[1:07:27] let them get your own house
[1:07:28] especially when they're under your roof
[1:07:31] do you instruct them
[1:07:33] do you command them
[1:07:36] do you teach them
[1:07:38] or is it
[1:07:40] that is somebody else's jaw
[1:07:43] and this is so important because
[1:07:46] where we feel you have others ready to
[1:07:48] pick up the task and
[1:07:50] that is why boys get into gangs
[1:07:53] because somebody playing the role
[1:07:56] that a father should have played
[1:07:59] somebody is teaching them somebody is
[1:08:01] invigorating them somebody is coaching
[1:08:03] them somebody's directing their lives
[1:08:07] and you said ma go to church and you
[1:08:09] feel like
[1:08:11] i prayed for him
[1:08:15] that he's not god god talk about ibrahim
[1:08:17] and abraham i know him he will pray for
[1:08:20] his children no
[1:08:21] that's not what god said
[1:08:24] he will command
[1:08:25] them
[1:08:26] he will teach them
[1:08:28] to come into the way of the law
[1:08:32] you know after my father died as i said
[1:08:34] sometime back
[1:08:36] because then i understood
[1:08:38] the cut tail that was called here the
[1:08:40] licks that i got
[1:08:42] was because he love when he cares for me
[1:08:46] when he wants to cut my ear
[1:08:48] and i clap on a tree and tap my eye
[1:08:50] coming down
[1:08:51] and i see when he when he say come down
[1:08:53] from there about it
[1:08:55] my father had something called a cooler
[1:08:57] and my brothers talk about
[1:08:59] the cooler was them the electric wire
[1:09:00] where you check it in middle part
[1:09:02] i used to rest it and tap the ledge
[1:09:10] and he's the one here three times
[1:09:14] and he said i wanted the first one
[1:09:17] the second one and after the third one
[1:09:19] and there's no more warning
[1:09:22] there's no more one
[1:09:24] it is really cooler he's equally cooler
[1:09:26] because that that when he finished with
[1:09:28] you he's a cool little
[1:09:31] at that
[1:09:32] time follow her money grown and when i
[1:09:36] think he went forward hit me so he put
[1:09:38] it into his leg and he pay him
[1:09:41] he had some skills
[1:09:43] but he was a genuine genuine father
[1:09:48] he i don't know much bibles he knew
[1:09:51] but his straight kids are spearly rather
[1:09:52] than spoiler child he wasn't spending a
[1:09:54] run
[1:09:55] spoiling on children he had 12 of them
[1:09:57] to see about and he had no time in a
[1:09:59] foolishness baby said the word shall put
[1:10:02] away foolishness is in the heart of the
[1:10:04] child but the russians put some of him
[1:10:07] yeah
[1:10:08] he gave who is just a weak almost
[1:10:10] so we'll be wise sons
[1:10:13] no
[1:10:14] this modern generation that i get
[1:10:17] psychological assistance to talk to each
[1:10:19] other they can't hit the child in school
[1:10:21] they can't disappoint the child
[1:10:23] it's horrible it's awful just to talk
[1:10:26] and talk and talk and talk and talk to
[1:10:29] america and i think cheering for the
[1:10:31] fourth parents and all right
[1:10:35] it is insane this world upside down this
[1:10:37] world is in a crazy place
[1:10:40] but but things have got come back to the
[1:10:41] reality the reality is this
[1:10:44] the bible could talk about the word
[1:10:47] because god is used it
[1:10:50] think about it now
[1:10:52] all joke aside
[1:10:54] every son that committed god gonna be
[1:10:56] chastised
[1:10:58] god will put the red
[1:10:59] and if he can't take the blondes you see
[1:11:01] like a bastard child not my child
[1:11:05] so the rudder correction even though
[1:11:07] it's not a great experience during it
[1:11:10] but
[1:11:11] afterwards you come out right
[1:11:13] you come out on a better side
[1:11:15] all because
[1:11:16] the word has been applied
[1:11:19] all right let me see if i could try to
[1:11:20] see
[1:11:21] okay
[1:11:22] so then
[1:11:25] i know him versus 90.
[1:11:27] that he will command his children
[1:11:29] and his whole soul afraid
[1:11:31] and they shall keep the way of the lord
[1:11:33] to do justice
[1:11:35] and judgment
[1:11:36] that the lord may bring upon abraham
[1:11:38] that which he had spoken of him
[1:11:42] and then i think
[1:11:43] this may be my final scripture
[1:11:46] and this is from genesis chapter 32
[1:11:49] and we want to read from verse 7 to 11
[1:11:52] chapter 3.
[1:11:54] then jacob was greatly afraid and
[1:11:56] distressed this is when jacob's going to
[1:11:58] meet
[1:11:59] his brother esau
[1:12:01] and he's afraid and he divided the
[1:12:02] people that was with him
[1:12:04] and the flocks
[1:12:05] and herds
[1:12:07] the camels into two paths
[1:12:10] and said if eso come to the one company
[1:12:13] and smite it then the other company
[1:12:15] which is left shall escape
[1:12:17] and jacob said
[1:12:19] now this is the verse i want to get to
[1:12:22] verse 9
[1:12:24] and jacob said
[1:12:27] o god
[1:12:28] of my father abraham
[1:12:32] and god
[1:12:34] of my father isaac
[1:12:37] let me stop right there before we do
[1:12:38] that
[1:12:42] could
[1:12:44] our children say
[1:12:47] the god of my father
[1:12:51] this is the
[1:12:53] this is the cap
[1:12:55] of what i want to share tonight
[1:12:59] god has to be so real
[1:13:02] in our lives
[1:13:04] that our children could see
[1:13:06] the god of my father
[1:13:11] that is what you represent here tonight
[1:13:16] you in true fatherhood
[1:13:20] should
[1:13:22] represent god
[1:13:26] i think that's a very profound statement
[1:13:31] this is
[1:13:34] the core
[1:13:37] i want you to think
[1:13:39] god not asking
[1:13:42] of the woman
[1:13:44] god is not asking of your wife
[1:13:47] god is asking of you
[1:13:50] remember when moses saw the backpack of
[1:13:52] god he's on the back part of a man
[1:13:53] because not a woman
[1:13:55] god is a man the feminist will be crazy
[1:13:57] over here in something like this be the
[1:13:59] craziest have they don't know
[1:14:01] they want to make god a woman he's not a
[1:14:02] woman he's a man
[1:14:04] that is why
[1:14:06] male
[1:14:07] men are so important to god
[1:14:10] because of what they represent
[1:14:12] that is why pharaoh still say kill all
[1:14:14] males three years and under
[1:14:18] because men carry seats
[1:14:20] men carry generations
[1:14:22] men carry the seeds of the righteous
[1:14:25] and when you understand the rule and
[1:14:26] function of why you are where you are
[1:14:29] and how you are and your purpose it
[1:14:31] comes a different picture altogether
[1:14:35] so then
[1:14:37] you have to be aware
[1:14:39] and conscious of the effect
[1:14:41] of what you do
[1:14:43] and how you live
[1:14:44] and how it affects other generations
[1:14:47] because we are affected by what has gone
[1:14:49] on before
[1:14:51] and i tell you i was so surprised to
[1:14:52] hear my brother speak the thing i was
[1:14:54] speaking i never even know they had
[1:14:56] those same thoughts
[1:14:58] it's only because having to do it
[1:15:01] i was like the host of his own meeting
[1:15:02] and stuff i went to college and together
[1:15:04] i want to hear it it was quite an
[1:15:06] experience for me to listen to them
[1:15:08] having the same testimony
[1:15:10] of what they see or if somebody see
[1:15:14] their father beating their mother
[1:15:16] if somebody see
[1:15:18] violence in the home and they grow up
[1:15:20] under that atmosphere
[1:15:22] when that person get married what do you
[1:15:23] mean
[1:15:26] that person go to church
[1:15:29] and that's why when i talk about
[1:15:31] parenting a story
[1:15:32] because some mothers
[1:15:34] they are not real mothers
[1:15:36] material and motherly lord
[1:15:38] not because they don't want to be
[1:15:40] because they never experienced what that
[1:15:42] money love was towards them
[1:15:44] they themselves don't know what that is
[1:15:47] and because they don't know what that is
[1:15:49] they can't give it
[1:15:51] and that is why i can't condemn them
[1:15:54] there are some people very maternal
[1:15:56] very caring
[1:15:58] very hard to save boy
[1:16:01] and
[1:16:01] [Music]
[1:16:02] they have a lot of empathy
[1:16:04] they feel for others
[1:16:06] there's some people don't fear for
[1:16:07] nobody
[1:16:10] they don't think and care about anybody
[1:16:12] they care about things but not people
[1:16:15] they they they care they rub them or
[1:16:17] they hurt them or they oh
[1:16:28] but
[1:16:29] sometimes it has to do with what is back
[1:16:31] there
[1:16:32] let me just finish read this off
[1:16:34] and
[1:16:35] you're gonna wrap up
[1:16:37] and jacob said oh god of my father
[1:16:39] abraham
[1:16:40] god of my father isaac
[1:16:42] the lord which said unto me return unto
[1:16:45] thy country to thy kindred and i will
[1:16:48] deal well with thee
[1:16:49] i am not worthy of the least of all the
[1:16:52] mercies and of all the truth mr has
[1:16:55] shown unto thy servant
[1:16:58] for with my staff i pass over this
[1:17:01] jordan and now i am become too bad
[1:17:04] deliver me i pray
[1:17:06] from the hand of my brother
[1:17:08] from the hand of esau
[1:17:10] for i fear him
[1:17:12] least he will come
[1:17:14] and smite me
[1:17:16] and the mother with the children
[1:17:20] this is
[1:17:21] a great experience
[1:17:23] because
[1:17:24] jacob was wealthy
[1:17:26] uh he had flocks and you know
[1:17:28] the whole works and here it is he's
[1:17:31] confessing his fears
[1:17:34] he's afraid of his brother
[1:17:36] he's able to identify his weakness can
[1:17:38] you
[1:17:40] he's able to recognize you know
[1:17:42] all this money but all these children
[1:17:44] with all these bands with all this
[1:17:46] reputation and recognition
[1:17:48] it's not working
[1:17:50] i need
[1:17:51] your intervention
[1:17:53] i cannot rely on my own strength
[1:17:57] god i don't have it and sometimes god
[1:17:59] break us down to that sometimes in ill
[1:18:01] health
[1:18:02] sometimes in tragedy sometimes in so
[1:18:05] different many ways that we could come
[1:18:07] to that spot of
[1:18:09] depending on him
[1:18:12] i hope tonight that
[1:18:15] something said here tonight would help
[1:18:16] you
[1:18:18] in some way
[1:18:20] as a mother
[1:18:22] ask yourself how you are dealing with
[1:18:24] your sons
[1:18:25] ask yourself
[1:18:27] what
[1:18:29] will be the next generation like
[1:18:31] the pictures that
[1:18:32] they have heard of seeing
[1:18:35] ask yourself if you could do better if
[1:18:37] you could do more if you could
[1:18:39] get the right pictures
[1:18:41] and you here who know that you don't
[1:18:43] have the right pictures ask yourself do
[1:18:45] you want the right picture
[1:18:48] you have to come to that spot to say you
[1:18:50] know what
[1:18:51] i need help
[1:18:53] and you have
[1:18:55] women are strong today stronger than
[1:18:58] they ever was before
[1:18:59] but this is also according to prophecy
[1:19:04] every billboard
[1:19:06] whether it is selling a battery
[1:19:08] or they're selling no water
[1:19:11] it's a woman they have most likes
[1:19:14] that is just
[1:19:16] where we are
[1:19:18] qualifications women studies women on
[1:19:22] going up up up just women
[1:19:24] that's just how it is
[1:19:26] we knew
[1:19:27] what his end time is like as it wasn't
[1:19:29] this or no
[1:19:30] shall be mislead and jesus was saying
[1:19:33] the same spirits that was at that time
[1:19:35] would be in this thing
[1:19:37] and as we say just as putin make his
[1:19:39] move to invade
[1:19:41] to take over
[1:19:42] the world shattered that
[1:19:44] but god doesn't run the democracy
[1:19:47] he runs the kingdom
[1:19:49] and in that kingdom the king is in
[1:19:51] charge
[1:19:53] we are citizens of a kingdom
[1:19:57] abraham was seeking a city of make and
[1:19:58] delivers god
[1:20:00] he's a ruling boss
[1:20:02] in that kingdom we have invasions we
[1:20:04] just conquer that kingdom
[1:20:06] we just take over in that kingdom the
[1:20:08] land of the hippies
[1:20:11] and occupied
[1:20:13] but we because of the dominion appointed
[1:20:15] that was released in genesis 126 let us
[1:20:18] make man then have a million god release
[1:20:20] that if they take the lamb
[1:20:22] so understand this putin is not a prime
[1:20:25] minister
[1:20:26] he's a king
[1:20:28] he's in capacity
[1:20:30] and god calls us to be kings and priests
[1:20:32] to read and to rule
[1:20:34] but we have to begin by ruling our own
[1:20:36] lives
[1:20:38] our own selves
[1:20:40] lust of the eyes
[1:20:41] lust of the flesh
[1:20:46] oh my lord oh
[1:20:49] all right
[1:20:51] so let's close
[1:20:56] jesus
[1:20:57] was the example of son
[1:21:00] constantly references father
[1:21:06] when you see me you see my father
[1:21:09] my father
[1:21:11] is a husband man
[1:21:12] i am the true man
[1:21:16] i believe
[1:21:18] that the highest level that god could
[1:21:20] give somebody is to reach
[1:21:22] to become a father
[1:21:23] i'm closer with these words
[1:21:25] boys are writing to you children
[1:21:28] i write unto young men
[1:21:31] i run to you little lads i write unto
[1:21:33] you young men i write into your fathers
[1:21:36] the object of maturity
[1:21:39] the object of god is to get from
[1:21:41] children
[1:21:42] blood
[1:21:44] to young men
[1:21:45] to family
[1:21:47] you can't go past that
[1:21:50] father is the ultimate fulfillment
[1:21:53] because that is the purpose that god
[1:21:54] brings up the meal for
[1:21:57] menfolk
[1:21:59] to become a father
[1:22:00] to become a platform
[1:22:02] to become an author
[1:22:04] to become a generational builder
[1:22:06] that's what god called us to be
[1:22:11] get back instead
[1:22:15] show yourself a man
[1:22:19] get back instead
[1:22:21] sisters and wives have to get back into
[1:22:23] them
[1:22:24] a lot of them are totally out of order
[1:22:27] let me repeat that
[1:22:29] there's no mistake no separation
[1:22:31] a lot of them totally out of order
[1:22:36] god did not make
[1:22:38] man for woman
[1:22:40] he made woman for man
[1:22:42] you have it wrong
[1:22:44] if you think it's otherwise jabber did
[1:22:45] wrong
[1:22:47] it's not scriptures
[1:22:49] god wants to get it right if the sister
[1:22:53] sees a role correctly
[1:22:55] she would be given the husband
[1:22:58] 100 support
[1:23:01] and not battling
[1:23:02] and fighting him
[1:23:04] because we as jesus bright
[1:23:06] so called
[1:23:08] we not using our name
[1:23:10] he said in my name you shall
[1:23:12] we use in jesus name
[1:23:15] so a wife who want to be independent of
[1:23:16] a husband or like somebody said this
[1:23:18] people need too actually dead back to
[1:23:20] back
[1:23:22] and somebody says the same coin just two
[1:23:23] sides i don't i just agree with that
[1:23:27] one on one side is that one side that
[1:23:28] they backed back they backed back
[1:23:31] and the two sides same point i'm
[1:23:37] the two supposed to become one
[1:23:39] it's supposed to be a different thing
[1:23:41] altogether
[1:23:42] but god help us this
[1:23:44] is the first
[1:23:46] of i believe some deeper stuff that i'd
[1:23:48] like to share

[1:24:39] these broken up pieces
[1:24:41] and broken up words that you would help
[1:24:44] not just the brothers but the sisters
[1:24:47] not just the husbands but the wives
[1:24:49] that they will be interested in find out
[1:24:52] their real role what they are called to

[1:24:57] emotions aside and say god what could i
[1:24:59] do for this kingdom how could i be
[1:25:01] a better
[1:25:03] fulfill your purpose
[1:25:05] oh god and to see how
[1:25:07] jacob could say the god of my father
[1:25:09] abraham the god of my father isaac
[1:25:12] they knew
[1:25:14] god operated with abraham
[1:25:17] in abraham they knew god operated with
[1:25:19] isa they saw they heard it has a
[1:25:22] historical reference point
[1:25:25] of the history of their own lineage and
[1:25:27] experiences with god
[1:25:28] and they could refer the god of their
[1:25:30] fathers
[1:25:31] because things are so terrible people
[1:25:33] don't even want to hear about the father
[1:25:34] some of them some of them may never know
[1:25:36] their father they don't know the father
[1:25:38] disappeared the father gone a long time
[1:25:40] ago
[1:25:41] leaves them on their own
[1:25:42] and this
[1:25:44] is what the devil wanted
[1:25:46] lies without protection lies without
[1:25:49] direction lies without guidance
[1:25:51] and instruction you said i know abraham
[1:25:55] i know he would command his children to
[1:25:58] follow the way of the lord father such a
[1:26:00] beautiful testimony may it be so with
[1:26:02] his father here tonight if they have not
[1:26:04] done so if they have not take take it
[1:26:06] upon themselves to teach to show to god
[1:26:09] the children might look old bigger
[1:26:11] adults
[1:26:12] but lord as we get older we still need
[1:26:14] guidance
[1:26:15] we are being guided even here tonight
