Oh [Applause] thank you oh Jesus Oh [Music] [Applause] hallelujahs so we want to go straight into the wood this morning as we want to turn our Bibles to sin John chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 and Hebrews chapter 11 verse scripture reading this morning we greet you in the name of Jesus it's always a blessing to come to church always a blessing to be in a position to have here the would have God greetings to those connected us on the Internet may God richly bless you and a whole soul and family wherever you are wherever at sea it would be played that at the Eddy fire and strength meter and this toughened our core that we live in him amen so you want to go to Saint John chapter 8 two verses there verse 28 and 29 then said Jesus unto them when he have lifted up the Son of man then shall he know that I am he and I do nothing of myself but as my father had taught me I speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father had not left me alone for I do always those things that please him Romans chapter 8 we want to read verse 1 and then we want to go from 5 to 8 Romans chapter 8 there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit let's go on to verse 5 for the data after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit for to be carnally my name is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God within Hebrews chapter 11 two verses there verse five and six by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God I would all feel it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that has it that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him let's bajas forward a prayer father receive us tonight and the buns of Calvary die son we renounce all knives and all that we are we renounce it to be nothing we would not even breathe without you the beating of our hearts the pumping our lungs we will be nothing we would not have come to this world without you Father we are confessing that we have mistreated you and when we see what you have done for us we ashamed of our lives we are shame of ourselves of our small faith forgive us now Lord and help us this morning and minister to us by your word take me out of the way hide them behind Calvary's cross and may you be glorified in all what we see undo this day in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you you may be seated praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord we believe that prayer changes things hallelujah so if bread changes things keep on praying but a brown say all Christianity all that you are all that you ever will be is based upon feet in the world I think that statement would repeat all you are all you ever will be is based upon feet in the word I can't put my feet on nothing else if I was gonna put my feet on a church what church will it be he said now where could I put it on I don't know they're all scooping up on everything else twist lines and everything else but when I put my feet in this world it is uncut you put your faith and flesh and blood at my fail at my fall it's my crash but when you put your faith in the word there's no way that could fail because the word is God and people don't really believe that but the word really is God hallelujah didn't either he sends his word and create just like that he said let there be and it was because he spoke it man could speak whatever they want to speak but when God speaks that would can't fail it is so positive he said my word shall not return unto you boy return to me void but it shall accomplish a purpose I send it for to accomplish Oh glory to God so we are required to have faith and faith is that Foundation and fit is a revelation and revelation comes from God that's what Jesus told Peter flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto you but my father had written to you and upon this rock I will build my Church and that's the first place to use the word church hallelujah and that rock was the rock of Revelation it wasn't big stone and concrete and Dylan and blocks it was the rock of Revelation and that rocks to trollee ages men died without Rock men meant the fiery furnace in that rock the tourneys under with that rock but that rock held because the gates of hell can't reveal again somebody with divine revelation I don't care what condition you in God said so the case of hell just cannot prevail against somebody with divine revelation I don't care what happened with your wife I don't care what happened with your husband I don't care what happened your job I don't get more with your house with your cup the gates of Hell cannot prevail come on say Amen somebody Joe lost his wife Joe Costas don't lost that he was his children rather he lost his hell and it stays put come on same as somebody Jesus said destroy this body and she does I will raise it up myself praise God because the word said I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption no leave his soul in hell and Jesus had confidence in the word that if they destroy the body got to raise it up hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord are you with me all glory Lord amen sorry that's so excited I forget title everything just in the scriptures but a title is a final of a three-part message series the full fun desire to please God that's the title I have tonight it's treating the passions another word behind that we had that the cries get in the spirit and this morning to conclude the full fun desire to please God have an inspiration this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased who blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah oh praise God where is my contact scripture or our context scripture is from Matthew dr. Fannin I'll read it it's on Matthew chapter 21 and it reads thus a certain man had two sons Matthew 21 was twenty-eight to treat you a certain man had two sons and he this is Jesus this is an ER and Jesus is speaking his parable and he came to the first and said son go work today in my Vanya and he answered and said I will not but afterward he repented and went he came to the second and said likewise and he answered I will go sir and went not whether of them Twain that the father did the will of the Father they said unto him the first jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you it's a very simple parable that's why you have to go back in the Bible that's why you go back in the scriptures he went to one son on one son he said I'll read again he said he tell the son going today and work in my Vanya the son said I will not but repented and went second son he said I will go sir and went not whether of them did the will of the Father the first one so Jesus bust them out right he tell them and say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you because not that who mount say they will is the who they who do his will so God's objective is to get the job done or could we get a shout in the house all this talk talk warming up church benches that is nothing if you're talking tend to act upon what God said hallelujah marvellous iguanas to talk about the scripture Jesus what if anyone come after me let him deny himself I kind of like that yes if any man waitin on me you know he say if any man come after me say coming after he's moving he's coming after him he say but little did not sell pick up your cross and follow then he made an astonishing statement my sheep knows my voice and they follow me hallelujah so a she can get stumbled by the word the word is God the word is Jesus so if Jesus leaving you this way you would follow because my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow they're going to follow the word because you are part of the wood that is wide my god that's why you're gonna follow the word that's why the devil could only give you so much and no more come on now because when that word said again like a baby that is a commode you're pregnant with the word when the way that'll come other would have to come out haul it back no more doctor break out I feel tonight I feel this morning that we're going to break out in your life oh god you're struggling struggling struggling but one day the woodland to break oh so it's not those that say I will and then the dust they do not his doors that could say I do I will not and come and do hallelujah do the will of the Father I always do that come on now doing something going after him blessed not citizens here in pressing towards the kingdom of God there's always something for you to do to do not to talk to do not sell a ship into do we talk about the first miracle of Jesus raw was still water into wine in finest our wedding he was a guest like everybody else and wine right now they came to Jesus welcome to Jesus he's at the wine he's a no here manufacturing wine he doesn't mean wine exporting business manufacturing business Jesus didn't have a vineyard of grips the squeezing line they come to Jesus I like that's it alone any problems go to Jesus he said he said what have I to do with that then they say whatever he see do it so you find yourself none do it your business do whatever that's you know go to Jesus [Applause] if your car find your shoelace and good to Jesus you don't know where the salt is to put in the food go to Jesus don't worry you know he could do all right he could he could fix you right there are the money gota Jesus he could turn away to go with the find out fish to get that coin come on now this killed him trouble him yeah keep knocking on his door and if I don't get it you will hear more from me tomorrow or glory not God problem our by heart by your government excited because you have to have a passion to know the world yes they're gonna private you telling me excited I feel we don't have death church back more members this morning I feel your people on fire this morning feel the fires of war for you this morning they're gonna hear direct from heaven this morning we have a word for you this morning Oh hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise be to Jesus for he is wonderful this morning first Peter for said for as much then as Christ as suffer for us in the flesh on yourself likewise with the same mind for he does not suffered in the flesh had ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God for the time pass of our life may suffices have wrought the will of the Gentiles when we walked in las officiousness lust excess of wine revellings banquet ins and abominable idolatries we're in the think extreme that you run not with them to receive excess of riot speaking evil of you not in the amplified yet these words since Christ suffered in the flesh for us for you arm yourselves with the same thought and purpose patiently to suffer rather than to feel to please God you prefer to suffer them feeling to please God for whosoever has suffered in the flesh having a mind of Christ is done with intentional sin has stopped pleasing himself and the world and pleases God it's a growth process to come to that spot where you're really not interested in pleasing man the world or even yourself you come to a spot where you have an intent to please God I'm hearing you this one I'm not talking about going to church the oceans going to church this morning we're not talking about that if that is the goal we people will just go to church on your win but we're talking about an intent to please God we not talking money fervent desire yet that's what we're gonna preach on we're talking about the intent to please God you walk out of here and you're turning as a woman because you are my intent to please God it's the fat up yet when that colored fire forget it you're unstoppable glory to God nor devil moving you you can say like David or ten toes and fall on my right side forget about it I shall not be moved I don't care what dress the lamb I don't care where they're going That's not me that's them I don't care who do what I'm a Christian I'm a son of the Living God come on say man somebody you stand for God anywhere anytime anyplace honor any condition everybody's smoking you can say I don't do that anybody cursing you could stand on the job on the street in the car on the boss anywhere you go you'll spend anyhow come on say man somebody let's go call that a man on fire [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah uncompromisingly godly uncompromisingly a witness for Christ Oh hallelujah you want your wife to know your Christian and want your husband a Christian you want your children to know your Christian your what the father mother know you're a Christian yours tell me for something because if they don't stand for something you'll fall for anything that's the problem people are not standing for anything then let them they go with the flow of the group they go with the flow of the crowd they go with the flow of the ministers Association they have no revelation they have to get in my fax text or email or house and listen to somebody else did they get some kind of inspiration to preach but when a man seeking God and he'll come down on who can stop that man that man from God when God call you you know I'll never leave you and never shake you that's my Jesus the God said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased or claw readers or he was pleased and yet Jesus I always do that which pleases my father but somebody help me preach this morning but how could you please somebody when you don't know what pleases them come on kill a lot a shelf in the house I will sail again how

I didn't give them is the law some prisons we serve on time God nothing happened by chance that's why you put a clause in his world like insurance our sub-clause from Romans 8:28 and we know we supposed to know her others don't know we know all things work together you know that you supposed to note that we know that all things that door closed and your face water want to go to that door [Applause] that's not your door you have six other doors after good olive oil come on same as somebody all things work together for good to them that love God hallelujah when he came down to Lazarus when he killed her the very last if he had been here my brother had not died he said no problem it's a reason why I was not there he had to die come on saving somebody but I feel to give you a promise that I am the resurrection and I am the life come on same as somebody sometimes ambition tones are going to give you a promise me pre somebody something something comfortable give your promise we look god hit my mother's old Sarah was all past Iberian uncovers waiting for him to challenge him the tougher promise on him and whenever I want to say what are you gonna give me see I go childless God said come outside from the skies so shall thy seed be you know I want to give you this I want to know what kind of believe the promise that I want to drop on you and I say this morning there are some promises and power there's some anointed and blessed that want to jump on you but I already saw it [Applause] you will be seasoned we talked about the rapture I'm going the rapture he'll be wrapped in the morning hold on special rapture right whatever the rapture what ron [ __ ] on rapture but there's no way to interrupt you the Bible said Enoch walk with God but before he was trying to leave he had testimony what was his testimony where I was reading a quote and it's all real good to my heart and I bless my soul we had that for years that was not in ox testimony he knocks testimony that he pleased God I without feet you can't please him so those that econo those that are natural those that are in the flesh cannot please God because the flesh is warring against the spirit so that's why I gotta press your way to get into to be in the spirit that you could get in position for divine revelation a rosetta translator here this morning I'm preaching so slow that anybody could translate it right now louia you gettin in a channel divine revelation but break upon you when it hit you the deficit ouch let me back off because you know he watch but kept touch or chlorine Oh God you understand that revelation it's Brazilian power then why are people born why do people dead if they have this big revelation over 40 years of this endtime message its intellectual you're hearing a message but I believe that the Ministry of the Spirit is don't moving to bring divine revelation I believe the Ministry of the Spirit is to quicken the word to you to make those promises real to your heart I'll give the loss of worship eBook [Applause] bcz if somebody wrote something I can order was the Christian journey I'm in the book but they described something about the slow of this one pilgrim progress that's a book I remember you know comparing it to have your big boots and you're walking through some snow she would sometimes your trials like that slushee no film steps just a muddy situation and you have a long way to walking like some masses and it's rush slash your own you have to just walk the catwalk good because it's true and your dog some slushy muddy but keep on walking come on come on up you won't be get ever keep on walking I'm on seeing that somebody something you come to that spot hallelujah it's depressing it's frustrating sometime your foot come on your boots and they gotta push back your foot in the boots because that muddy slushy mess around your life holes you done but you're pressing on because you come from somewhere and you're going back the way it come from come from God God publicans Alaura so if you didn't know slush is part of it no you know [Applause] hallelujah if you didn't know know you'll know don't wonder why let's keep on walking they're gonna get on the slushy section of your life of your trial of your situation you're gonna get out of it [Applause] be seated the danger of the slow of this pond if I could call it that way is when you stop when you look unless the mud when you look at dominance in money and they see in slush when you look back away control you seen weight was dry but you see they go back yeah all eyes are in the cup cause there's no place to walk journey you better keep walking you know if you stop to get depressed if it gets stopped if you to give up but we don't give up instilling any mud help them help you you

light on the internet tunnel yes clapping to break away for you please leave that I want to be a man do you believe that [Applause] lead me to the rock overwhelms me why did I get overtaken me lead me to the rock that is hard and I know what my shield my comforter my strong and mighty tower my deliverer hallelujah my help here's my song or get the Lord a shout of praise oh I feel like singing this morning see like something this mornin Oh hallelujah hallelujah David cried out why does a hidden imagine of fainting cheering where is your God look at your condition where is your God let them call let them question where is your God but our God will come and he will do right God give them a chance to laugh and to mock he always let them do that and then he comes riding on in and shut them all to the critics how could there be critics there must be critics there must be people laughing at you they don't expect you to make it don't expect you to break out they expect us fix you in a box and seize you right there they see you going through your slow of the spawn and they waiting for you to mess up trip up back up mess up but are gonna bring your true come on see him as somebody job after while isidori slimming yet I will trust him the Lord kill the Lord taketh away when the devil heard that so he bow his head in the person and frustration mine I won't hit him from behind when job said the Lord kill never wasn't expecting that he thought job might have focus on his trial he told Joe I'm gonna be talking about his condition but job switches to the Lord he said the Lord guess the Lord dig come on now you're hearing me you have to stop talking about you and what to going through and this child is destined let me get your testimony both the Lord I'm here because this is what going on here you see that grandfather give your house land wherever it is you don't need to look for that ox the grandfather you don't need fear for that he promised you that you got any will yes you have a car our house has some money bank that's cool that's fine but when you know you will be blessed abundantly and there's no grandfather in sight there's no will are wrong but you just know that the windows of it is about to open and use our to make provisions for the window to pour out you have to get empty vessels you have to take your kitchens then I know you are feet that you under expectation for a mighty blessing from God when I see you all tight up and you all kind of figure out that's not fit that's the prison God by fit Moses by fit Noah by faith gesture say it means you bill in an act and there is no rent of floated there is no water to float it you do something that's so unusual something paradoxical nobody could explain why you are where you are oh you are oh you are you can't even explain you you can't explain how you in this service today you but you've made it i but i told me something he doesn't even know what keeping him but something keep telling him keep on keep pressing on keep pressing on many times you to give up you don't even know what keeping him it's not you keeping god it's God has been keeping you that's why you should shout inside of here that's why that's why you oughta worship you never open them up before open your mountain can cut the praises prism maybe a gray hair might turn back black press em maybe like you my Maggie's our prayers now maybe you're gonna be here but give called your praises because he deserves it [Applause] [Applause] here are some people love the fish mysteries some people if you I'm against mysteries I'm not I am a mystery if I'm against miss Jam against myself our mystery a live-in mystery you are mystery to your mystery in Goa but sometimes their life is so mysterious you wonder what kind of machine they were the unfolding because she after we hear all the mysteries we still have to live something ball handlers already do I know all mysteries do I have know all knowledge if I don't cannot any space where it could be manifested I am zero so that is why we have to get all the world history teaching revelation inspiration exhortation fire whatever it is you need all of it using the full package I can't give all of it that's why the different gifts and so on isn't that right and that's why kids come to edify Billups rent in the church the the fivefold ministry or the ministry of ministering and so on is not for the glorification of ministers it's for the perfecting of the scenes so when it comes to ministers war/battle passed away passed about a convention war convention battle is foolishness that's nonsense it's not that because first for the Gospels to bring Christ living in you the customer lists that become the wood burns in the hole from Genesis to Revelation to be summed up in three words three words would need flesh not would meet more would word made flesh and ticket a Kentucky Fried Chicken I'll buy some chicken fare as you would mean flesh what miss fest comes alive have no fellowship run with that it have a life with it thunders them all the time the Pharisees doing their own stuff right when she has come on the scene he was the world spirit hit him and then drive him into the wilderness to get pain before pleasure but I will preach pain before blessing we like pleasure first and then we cap in after hallelujah but God program is a difference he have this suffering Eman that produced character which which which which she called the process of character development which people don't like to hear hallelujah so when Jesus the spirit struck him he was truly led by the spirit into the wilderness to deal with the devil by the word now what if Jesus were getting wasn't in the world between instructor Satan the devil make a spinner on him but he knew the world so when they never bring words it's also written don't come with that don't try that I'm on say my somebody you can't fool me with that you got caught that alone bring something else with that coat come on say my somebody give the Lord a show Loreena chorus when our man is in the word nobody could fool that man come on say man somebody the typing law on Scripture hidden mystery for that man even did the hidden altar the devil in that mystery I assure you there will be a hidden mystery that's not in the word because the Prophet and the spirit and the bride will say the same thing and this much is important and what they say will have already been said in the word you can't make a mistake with that that's just share the Lord will give the Lord a shout of praise you could judge me by the word you to judge me by the message you could just what I preached by what you're reading the books come on give the Lord a show that's why we called the way we cook Oh hallelujah because the Prophet brought us here the Lord he brought Spirit spoken world and if we echo back those words if we speak those words and those would come into you and some alive into you that devil is finished Oh glory to God hallelujah you may be seated my whole time have changed oh time have changed only this weakness show you a picture Russian command center victory story building a little Putin

fort people don't know the world that woman grown so much what given my prophet the prophet Samuel go give up Samuel hallelujah and when goes I'm a very young what Colin because Eli was distilled in God he and his sons was a distilled monster God and anytime tasty ones come whatever reason somebody and it goes small holy little and what's that a call Samuel and I'll do something that will cause minted it is it is the tingle a word hallelujah when them guys get the will of the fearless Moses you know there were kings they will tell what effect it doesn't matter you know people feel all my the field God has some booties grandfather he is not squad oh let me continue whoa so since Christ suffered in the flesh for us I was going in amplified arm yourselves with the same thought and put my patiently to all suffer rather than to fall feel the please God for whosoever hath suffered in the flesh having the mind of Christ is done with intentional sin has stopped pleasing himself on the world and pleases God so that he no longer live spend the rest of his natural life living his human appetites and desires but he lives for what God wills oh do you love him Oh blessed be the name of the Lord Romans 15 one listen to the scripture we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves what are we little again Romans 15 1 we then that are strong ought to be R in other words you are fine you bless you have this you have that but you ain't key about nobody else that naughty scriptures descriptors are we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak are not to please ourselves so all this gospel is coming to strip self self out that Christ could really come in and Christ serves Christ gives Christ delivers Christ restores Christ reconciles Christ heals that's what Christ does but self defense protect I know everything else but that's not Christ Oh blessed be the name of the Lord could we continue now how can you please someone if you don't know what pleases them tinnitus many rubbish and come to passion to know his word so if I'm not in the word you are not yet interested in really pleasing God my and that brings us the cry to get in this spirit because Brown says the Christ mission of God reveal the Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of the divine revelation of Christ isn't that right and this is what I was given to see to you today the people that day has made gods in their own image and likeness what did think he is it's a god of their own invention a God made with the hands of their imagination a God of their own choosing not a God of the world so because of that they could see anything do anything live any way they want and it's okay there in the message what message is that that they claim is not did not they don't know the Scriptures don't form your own gods and make that think you are right because that God is according to the deeds of your own heart so because you think that is God you do what you want live how you want and think that is okay it is not God is a word of the word so all of us Minister elder Deacon trustee whoever have to subject ourselves to this wood because the word itself is God listen to what Jeremiah in Jeremiah chapter 7 verse 23 let me read this what God said but this thing I commanded I am seeing this is God speaking JAMA 720 or be my voice and I will be your God ye shall be my people and walkie in all the ways that I have commanded you that it may be well unto you but they had not not incline their air but walked in the consul's and the imagination of the evil heart and went backward and not forward since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets daily rising up early and sending them yet they had not under me not in kindly air but harden their neck they did worse than their fathers therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them but they will not happen to thee thou shalt also call unto them and they will not answer thee but thou shalt say unto them this is a nation that albeit not the voice of the Lord their God nor receive it correction truth is perish and cut off from their mouth this is the God we serve his like that that is how he speaks he speaks truth when the nation's backslide and get the condition he rebukes them he corrects them he doesn't let them say where continuances no he let them go the captivity until they begin to cry until the recognized God is the strength God is there help God is who destroyer mighty tower and when they started crying to God God sends them a deliverer because he is the God understand this he is their God but you could backside he is their God but you have to turn away from him he is your God but you have to obey Him and serve Him because in obeying him you'll be pleasing him but abandoned you can't have anything from God but only my feet my feet the walls of Jericho fell by Moses refused to become call us on a favorite daughter Gideon did so and so my feet without faith is impossible to please him if you want the please God you must come to him with faith believe in his word is truth so let it be this morning the world is true not your dreams not your feelings not me it wasn't your past Church and this used to come to you and that should come to you weird people are kind of cuckoo testimonies what kind of visions and revelations and time for my them not in my wrong right now to confirm the own vision because God didn't speak to him and God didn't show them it was all the

do not believe he meant the mountain was holy it wasn't a holy mountain it was the holy God in the mountain it isn't the holy church as the holy ghost in the church that makes it what it is it isn't the holy man is the Holy Spirit now we find out that God God never did anything just random every move he made it was ordained of the father we do random things he said I always do that which pleases the father so every movie need had a meaning and it was to please God I oh I would say here would it not be wonderful if we could have a testimony like that that we always do that which pleases God look at what he does for us in the condition we are in what would he do if we would be one hand and one Accord and the only way we can do that it's a unify our hearts together with brotherly love will be the officers of the church and the pastor obeys God and God worked through the pasta to the board into the church and all together a one unit the kingdom of God and Kabul here when we have a unified group nothing bothers you you don't know don't know the dismay about anything that's the kind of person God ordained to take the land motive was complete he was a man that wouldn't compromise

because they behaved badly to you and God is not talking about them at all God is talking to you about you and too much of us too many of us accept the excuses and I'm challenge you to cut it out I
