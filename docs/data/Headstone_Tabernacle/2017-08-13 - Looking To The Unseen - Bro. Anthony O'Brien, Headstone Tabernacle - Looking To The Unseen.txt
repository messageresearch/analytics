you could feel free to to be seated Amana we'll just so open our Bibles now amen as we turn over to the word amen and have a free portion of Scripture from the book of habakkuk in the Old Testament and in the New Testament want to read Romans II and we also want to read a Hebrews 11 so so we read first from Habakkuk which is almost latter part of the Old Testament and have a cup to a man reading from verse 1 how about to induce one says I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me on what I shall answer when I am approved and the Lord answered me and said write a vision and make it clean upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the NHL speak and not lie though it sorry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry a man are eating over all turning over editor Romans 8 wanna read down this just about foods for food since then a man on those familiar tear I'll touch on it more of the chapter as we go through the series a in Lord please to do that but but I just want to read a food for who says Amen so Romans 8 verse 1 says they therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh now the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now Hebrews 11 and we'll just read from from verse one now Hebrews 11 amen and it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than King by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh now let me skip down to this 13 here no I want to pick up something in this chapter verse 13 says these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth Hebrews 11 14 says for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they have been mindful of that country from when they came out they might have opportunity to have returned say for instance like Egypt and the Israelites come out and they wanted to go back every time something happened because they were mindful of that country see but he said but now they desire a better country that is and heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he had prepared for them a city he many may call a blessing to Rio jewel in Malaysia's Bar is one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you Lord this morning for your word and for your promises law law

dimension and you know we have what's called human science is man's science and so on the observance on the study of nature and how it affects us and the environment that's what science is just a study of how things systematically progress in nature and so and you know God made all of it so God is reflected in nature isn't that right what a brand said if you look close enough you'll see God on

Eagles when you look at it either you see true christianity reflected or holily and not being in that animal at all created what I want I want a wonderful being we will study it for years to see how

Oh hallelujah my Cecil encouraged this morning all the word is a lamp unto our feet he is an encouragement this morning to us oh I keep on pressing on the Holy Ghost is right at the door oh it's an open door this morning you can go through this morning Oh hallelujah hallelujah go through that door before the ten times dispensation is over you run to that door this morning his arms open wide he

you his sonship many my oh my oh please gone we man oh wow alright so amen so I started thinking about this dimension that we in and yet certain laws that govern this dimension isn't that right and in all dimensions there's something called the law of gravity basically it says what goes up has got to come back down the earth it tells the atmosphere the earth pulls objects towards it so once you're within the gravitational field halleluyah off you're an object up there it's got to come now and knock but Jesus already decide those laws when you stood up on the mountain and he was talking to them he said go into all the world and preach the gospel all of a sudden begin to raise up out of their sight the Bible said a cloud received him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said but tarry in Jerusalem I'm coming back down at the appointed time I'm gonna come back and visit you Oh hallelujah Allah with the Holy Spirit with the Holy Ghost in other words I come back when I want gravity can't hold me no more in the spirit world it's zero gravity there's no spin hole in you there's no fill tool in you there's no unbelief hole in you there's nothing to pull you down it's only th pushing you up on up into the heavenlies up into the Rainbows up into the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now when you lift your hands in the sanctuary when you lift your hands in the service what are you doing defying gravity other sign I know who I am I know who my father is all earlier this work and hold me one of these days I'll soon be gone it won't be long friends it's gonna be soon friends Oh hallelujah praise coffee like dancing [Applause] in our dimension there's something called buoyancy I didn't research if you throw an object into the water or if you're underwater there's part of it that's supposed to sink in there is another part that's teased up and depending on the mass or the density of the object it could either sink or it could show that a certain portion but Jesus already defied that law because one needs disciples were in a boat and they were in a song and they were all worried but all of a sudden they look and it saw something coming up on the water at first he thought it was a course but upon further scrutiny he thought it was Jesus walking on top of the water that has nothing to do with natural laws he wasn't a natural praise God he was from the supernatural hallelujah those laws on a subject to him that's how a son of God operates Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah nothing to do with natural laws so spiritual or image Galilean motion oh my hallelujah is nigh hallelujah there's natural laws but it's also spiritual laws and there was a law of sin and death this one time that Paul talked about and when you were born this law of sin and death was within your members hallelujah it was of taking away the roots of your heart how are you driving in to do sin Paul said when I would do good evil is present with me so there's another spirit playing in my members is he talked about it is not right praise for when I could do good evil is present with me when I try to pray the devil try to hold me down when I try to break through the devil try to hold me down when I try to have page the devil said you did this tree to detach you you did whatever the law of sin and death willing you aware from what you want from what you need but Paul says there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus for the law live the life in Christ Jesus is what sets you free from the law of sin and death praise God it's a greater law it's a greater power that's going to come into you and burn all the root of evil another slick in your heart you are going to be walk like a Christian talk like a Christian act like a Christian praise God hallelujah hallelujah that's a promise to you receive it o Holy Ghost you are going to receive something or out of the world doesn't know about it Oh hallelujah hallelujah we try within ourselves Oh hallelujah but there's coming a time where you won't have to try no more where the Spirit in you will bear witness with feedback follow the Christ son of the Living God Peter said it my revelation but he still had to get a supernatural element inside of his soul to really speak it back so that on the day of Pentecost when they were all praising in his name how come the power how come the fire bird within his heart all of sake I was in their praise God was born out it was burned out it was cutting out a root in our praise God that's what I want that's what I'm looking for this morning that's what you came for this morning Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's what we want or we have a desire to meet with God we need God more than ever before hallelujah hallelujah to go past human elements it has a go party out of court into the holy place Oh hallelujah praise an altar you gotta want it you've got to want to go in there you are predestinated to go in there you caught put something inside of you to have the ability to get into contact with Jesus who you are his child the devil is a liar this morning he told you that you couldn't do it but look at you now you already in the spirit and something fixing to take place Sunday it cannot happen this morning I challenge you this morning to rise up into the heavenlies and to proclaim Jesus Oh hallelujah worship God this morning Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you can't get anything in its natural realm you can't get spiritual things in its natural realm if you want spiritual things you have to go into a spiritual place go into a spiritual atmosphere shock appeal behind you you cut yourself off a mass or higher like a man do for me oh it's got to come to a point where it's complete desperation that's how I felt she said life I perish I perish but I've got to go in I've got to see the king the situation is too dire I am my people in time if we don't get what we need and that's how you've got appeal when you come into this church when you come into this place you mean business with God I've got to see the king who opened the doors oh I left me on through I've got a praise I've got a press I thought on doing my promises Oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] my halleluyah halleluyah Romans 8 honey what was day 20 that's what a creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected to semen hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God hallelujah it was at all will to be bit subjective parenting but because of Adam's sin we come down in this condition hallelujah hallelujah whatever was it for Jesus where will we be this morning is only to Jesus Christ we have access rights to the promises of God we are access to every retentive right and he guide for so let me tell you what he died for he died for your freedom he died for your Liberty he died for you to receive the Holy Ghost he died for you to be healed he died for you to be healed he thought were you to be perfect he died for you to be adopted he tired hallelujah that you might have life he said I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah except for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which are the first fruit of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body amen okay hallelujah enemies keep on long you know he-man I think you got that amen amen so brother Branham God's prophet is all right was born of the ability to see beyond our world it's not right to see beyond what we could see and its profit identifier that went in came in we drop down into a hickey it's never got going is a loop that loop was time it's nine I'm not hickey represent times all right are we dropped on from eternity at the time and we bypass Oki often is not we didn't know who he was we come into a state of ignorance as it was it's not right we didn't know who our Father was didn't know who I'm we're called to do who our family was what all rights was it's not who we are connected to praise or who our family was we had no idea so it took the voice of God to call us in every age to call every seed to call every son's on the call every thought in every age Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh praise God thank you Jesus oh I shudder to think that in every age even in a horse and buggy age or people drink tea and people had they had all these ping England in different places in John Wesley and all the revivals that took place all back in their day they had no TV they had no internet they had no cell phones Ohan earlier nothing like that it was a completely different lifestyle yet in that age and yet end up disposition the voice of God found a way to contact John Wesley the voice of God on the way to contact Martin Luther holler because I was his time that was his Jesus I was his days for God to be manifested in their day and I think about our days and sometimes we complain but I know you say it's so hard sometimes to find the time to be with God sometimes you find it so hard to pull a 5-time from the work schedules and from the work routine and from all the hustle and the bustle of life and I shudder to think that even still know things have change and though the lifestyles of people have changed a long time ago people had one job no people have three trying to pay the bills trying to make ends meet single-parent homes they have different challenges even in the midst of those challenges Paul is still gone car is still gone and the supernatural is still there and the same signs that Jesus is when he was here on earth the same signal is here the dead I was raised the blind that saw the that walk both elements are still on the earth right now all it takes is a supernatural faith to reach up into that place and pull down those promises for allergy but it is still here divine healing hasn't stopped Oh hallelujah hallelujah rapport is Telenet he might have taken his prophet but part is still here Oh hallelujah Rihanna and that boy changers it's getting ready to speak for me reasons for a true Jesus ministry on here once more the world ahead Tyra from God Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it happened yet but it will it will come it's promised to come is now right points of God in the last days a true voice Oh hallelujah so right now we will be contending for it but we haven't seen that perfect church yet we are only pressing for it we are only praying for it that's what we're doing this morning hallelujah hallelujah prepare for the dynamics we can look to the rapture yet no we have to die out the rapture is coming but in order for you to be ready for that rapture you have to receive power power has to come first you are not going to go into a rupture in this condition no no no no this mortal must put on immortality because it's another world it's another place it's another dimension Oh hallelujah Alice you've got to get in shape you've got to get fit you've got to get into a condition that you could go into that rapture it's not right it's not right astronauts before they could go into space they have to go into training first because it's zero gravity you can't walk how you want to walk you can't call you an AK and go and zero gravity you have to be trained for that you have to be schooled in that you have to know how to move how to go how to put your hand this way also glide across that way well so it is in the supernatural but in order for you to handle a supernatural you have to be trained first how to speak how to move how to wait on God how to wait for God adaptation scruple go ahead a revision but wait until the appointed time so it's Ari's wait for it it shall surely come to pass it will not perish isn't all right good night it's like that time with the Prophet when you had that vision it's not right you're supposed to go up repo baby your child I think it was when he went to you got a vision God shoot him ho would happen and he went ahead of the vision and prayed and it got worse he said O Lord I do and he shrunk back and then he began oh wait no of a sudden the pieces of the vision that was showed to him before started to come into place and as the person came and this one came when the glasses was supposed to rest on a certain place then when it happened the way God showed him he did it again and he went back and prayed and everything got better and right there gorgeous food him not to go ahead of the vision but to wait until I show you to go hallelujah wait until I show you how supposed to take place Oh hallelujah I'm right now people are going ahead of the vision same things they shouldn't say claiming things they shouldn't claim don't go ahead of the vision you wait until my name is come Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah go it hurry wait for it it's also leaked on the past halleluyah halleluyah I caught profited Oh H then we had to wait all Seoul if port profit had to wait for the anointing he said you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on the Holy Spirit and he would stand there and talk and wait and wait and wait on which without all of a sudden hit on the Holy Spirit he's actually carrying spirit under my control for the glory of God all right now this morning we all wait in we are waiting on God we are waiting for God standing on his promises be steadfast be unmovable this morning remember us even praise hallelujah hallelujah Jesus said I do nothing as a part of show me person good night oh my oh my praise God that I profit a man so that means therefore that what events are to take place in future and what events are past it's already set in gold mine is now it supposed to happen a certain way it supposed to take place at a certain time Gord shooters proffered a vision but that vision is now dusty at the Lord it cannot change is now it's gotta happen exactly though we go smoke it Amen hallelujah God's prophet so go to prophet when a vision break he say it transport him to the event itself into the place where is happening and he see shadows of people and I think that will happen he said sometimes their subconscious oh he he explains it here let me see let me see let me see if I can read it here you actually explained it here and a message picked her up is it well yeah amen all right is that now what he said nah let's let's see settle lines already all right he said as the meetings go on each night the annoying thing begins to get very deep even if you understand he said you break into another dimension see he said sometimes I don't know how loud I'm talking just imagine standing here no talking and something that happened back yonder 40 years ago and in the spirit I'm back there with them and where that is happening and knowing but I'm knowing that I'm talking but I don't know where my voice is Wow so he can't even hear his own voice he is fully in the event of what's taking place he's so far away from the present that he could do longer his own voice speaking but he's conscious there's a different consciousness in our eye he said I know I'm supposed to be here in this tabernacle he said I am here but yet I am always on the somewhere he said you don't know what a feeling it gives he said it's no wonder daniel said he was troubled at his head and different things that have taken place see he said now how many ever dreamed a dream he said he said now you couldn't dream a dream you know I couldn't tell you dreaming a dream he said you couldn't do it he said now he said that's your subconscious he said no one ordinary person dreams dreams for his subconscious is probably about that far from him I'm trying to demonstrate but he said when this conscious becomes inactive this one takes over this one sets up is that right you can't know how many remember the things that you dream how many remember the things that you dreamed years ago what caused you to remember it well you are somewhere in some kind of a condition wasn't you because you still remember it when this conscience became active he said well now some people doesn't dream at all their conscience could be way back like that like overturn our wall somewhere he said no a person he said now you can make yourself what you are he said I believe that all gifts and and callings are without repentance so he said God gives them serenity as he will God he said you couldn't come to God less God called you it's not so we know that it's God who calls you is my right God who gives you you take God who put you in a church he said it's God who does everything not in him rest all in all in there he said that scriptural as it can be and you know that's right if that but now look he said a fear his subconscious is not back there neither is it here he said it's right here he said you don't go to sleep use a spring from one into the other one into the other and then when you just let it alone and then it comes at its own leisure he said see this is but here here is just raising up like her not hold to see something he said you're praying he said we wait just a minute there's something breaking here no he said this is it he said but here it's raising up looking through like a Knothole to see something you're praying you're trying to take a parable which is words that God gave me alone to know and it just keep repeating then you break you see the position as you're contacting them you say and then they catch their spirit it goes to them then you just see something happen maybe it'll close off maybe you look again maybe you'll see something else that'll close on and so on he said but when God gives it just as his leisure he just looks like he raises you up he said he raises you up over the fence and lets you see the whole thing said that's what it's all about so here's a prophet explaining what these visions are like and it's really the subconscious and the conscience he's slipping into those two worlds sometimes you'd be praying and by the time he gets up he's in a different place seeing different pictures experiencing different things not aware of the present but in somewhere in the past or future seeing things that I've been looking at things that will be oh what a place to be in I was God's prophet isn't all right proving that that supernatural world was right there all of you right there among us he was no learning man he was no big education but I was a gift of God given to see what man couldn't see to go into the spiritual realm and to see things that are before things that are holily that think that was it's not right no for a message that I would Lord here there is a prophet discerning I wanna read this here again our readers here know you don't know we are strangers he said I believe although your life all through your life is ministering to somebody you get all through your life you've had a hunger haven't you he said ah now here in these days that you're coming to now he said yes I see something coming before me is that oh it's a but you have a stomach trouble don't you that is not right he said you've never served God like you wanted to so he's picking up a hunger and a stomach trouble he said you've never entered into that place that you've hunger and thirst for isn't that right you can right he said do you want to receive him he said may the Lord Jesus heal you and fill you with his spirit until your heart is bubbling over with His grace in the name of Jesus Christ I ask it amen he said now go our cistern receiving the name of Jesus Christ he's still deserting he says let's see he said now he's here let's say praise the Lord everybody said praise the Lord he said have faith in God now he said it's such a plug he said watch he described it he said it's a blast right through here he said now honestly my brother my brother my sister he said if you would just enter into that other into that other dimension enter into that realm he said just don't think about how sick you are you can if you just move on up here and God where you can touch him he said something gonna happen in a few minutes oh I'll er er er er er oh so the man of God is on the pulpit and he feels something in the atmosphere trying to tell the people that the door is open go in and get your blessing go in and get what God has for you because it's a supernatural world Oh hallelujah hallelujah I believe that will is right here among us this morning but no

your hearts he said God here to bring it to pass then he breaks off you said there's somebody right in here he said they keeps pulling on something right in that way see I I can't place where it's at

heart he just healing himself Oh God I got showing him things showing him things and he was a perfect channel of the supernatural to us Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you are gonna find some more

right you see says he says uh so when you die you say well I see what it's all about now hey man you see the plan of God from up there but but down here you're you're depressed you're frustrated and you go through ups and downs and trials and so on but when you're up there he says you see what it's all about you see the plan of God you see why this had to happen and you see why that had to happen

promise please go on hallelujah hallelujah isn't all right please go on hallelujah let's start on huh back up too quickly before I rounds up amen it says I stand upon my watch and set me upon a tower to see what he will see unto me it's nice and what I shall answer when I am approved amen and the Lord answered me and said write a vision make it plain upon tables that he does me run me read us it so the vision is what God has revealed it's now you cannot give yourself a vision it takes call to show the vision it takes call to reveal it it takes God to reveal what is what's going to happen it

being sent for by Cornelius and about a city Rossellini morning and they left to go to Cornelius his house and when he came Cornelius said I've been expecting you Cornelius don't know this man from

coming in wanna Sarah another time of life next 28 days your deliverance is coming Oh hallelujah hallelujah 9 oh my freeze gone let's strike fate now we close out this sick sense of fate right so we have five senses see taste feel smell in here but at six cents is what we use to contact go and see come by hearing and hearing the Word of God and the preaching of the word is what brings faith so that's why the devil try to keep you out of the atmosphere try to keep you out of the Assemblies holily for signal your selling of ourselves sometimes things get in the way on a life captain away mistakes on this thing hallelujah but it pays the pina atmosphere k9 atmosphere until car take over I said God do something for you only poor to do sunny for you but you have to be any atmosphere of it Cornelius was praying always giving arms just a live out in the atmosphere pray instead anointing speaking oh until something takes place are there something breathe forth in his life break forth in the supernatural oh yeah that's what we're looking for this morning a man say to believe what God said will come to pass see faith is the only sense that has the ability to reach God the contact God the core God on the scene is now right as Hebrews 11 it says now faith is some of the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and true faith we understand the world will frame by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear is now right Oh musicians could get ready to come I'm almost finish but a balance out on Israel and the church he said me won't have time on this to go back there but we're going to start up here at the beginning of the church and and that was when he said no you found another church the word church means called out to call our people he said I believe in I need every denomination under the heaven today there's got to be some good people in every one of them and I believe that if Jesus comes it's good to be a call out group and I believe that way away away away from the coming of the Lord as far as the church is concerned or conditions are no conditions for the coming of the Lord he said we can have faith for divine healing let alone to be raptured he said has got to come something to happen he said why if somebody speak of rapture and they say well what are you talking about some of the people members of the church they talk about divine healing said I do believe and such he said they can't see well he said I believed it they hypnotized them said well how could that person ever go in a rapture how could he resurrects on the dead when there's nothing to resurrect from there's nothing to resurrect him it's just a make-believe a mental psychic when you say I believe Jesus Christ is the son of God he said that's all right he said but brother if that isn't coming from the heart hear what he says why it's only mentally he said if it can't come from the heart it can't come from the heart until the Holy Ghost there's record of it jesus said no man or the Bible said rather no man can say that jesus is a christ only by the Holy Ghost and you can't say it in yourself the Holy Spirit has to speak it from you he said when Peter confessed him he said thou art the Christ son of the Living God he said blessed are thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven and I say thou art Peter upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it he said you see where we're at he said to a man so the Holy Ghost in you is what bears record of Christ hallelujah hallelujah in your heart and in your life the holy goat has to speak back bow out the Christ in order for you to be a proper witness so that when the Holy Ghost can speak back to God that a genuine son of God speaking back Oh hallelujah that's what we want not just a mental state but a spiritual state part on on the inside the thing that ankles the finger rules the thing that held brother Branham in is trial that's the thing that's got to speak back so you see me here I trust him power the Christ Oh hallelujah I believe every promise in the book is right whoa only the Holy Ghost could speak back like that in many many many lujah and God could see his own reflection in you speaking back to him isn't alright you can play something softly a meadow one that Jesus told Nicodemus you must be born again ignite jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit he said Marvel not that I see entity you must be born again the wind blew it where it listeth and don't hear it the sound thereof what you don't know where it's coming from or where it was so it is every one that is born of the Spirit Oh hallelujah hallelujah work and figure out no more you will no longer from here you are from eternity you just passing through time Oh hallelujah you pick up children you pick up a family but you just pass into time oh hi but you come from glory and you going back to glory you only drop down here in this earth they give a testimony that you please God Abraham please call Paul please cause Jacob please God and you are gonna please God also because without faith is impossible to please him isn't there a man one more quote that I'm finished the Prophet said at the end of the Pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the word and God help me tonight to show you through here with receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends I'll be and reveal the whole secret of God for the rafting of the church and it's coming for seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right and I believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride ready it's together for rapture and see because what we got right now we won't be able to make it there is something we've got to step further and we can have sweet enough for divine healing hardly but we've got to have enough heat to be changed in a moment and to be swept up out of this earth and we have finally after a while the Lord willing where it is written a man Israel in the church he said I believe when the border line tonight even I was wondering about all my meetings and things and how I have to cancel them and I truly truly believe that before the church can have the rapture it's got the abrupt rain see we cannot plead for divine healing you said but we've got our faith that will change and in this body and be ticularly he said I believe there's a church on its route tonight a power of the Living God that men will speak and the word here and there you get a little flash like lightning and a church is coming out not a
