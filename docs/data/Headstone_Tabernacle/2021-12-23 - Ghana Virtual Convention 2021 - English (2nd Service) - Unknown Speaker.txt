organized through your servants now that we are greeting this convention may you pour out your grace and your blessings upon every person that will be watching upon every listener lord bless the bride all over the world and father touch our lips that every member of the bride's body be quickened in this end time in the precious name of your son jesus i prayed amen amen may god richly bless you we are certainly glad to be with you this morning i bring special greetings to pastor solomon nachina for the endeavor to host this convention which is a blessing for the bride all over the world may god richly bless him he gives us the privilege to be to greet the bride this morning may god bless you without further ado we shall turn to our bible in matthew 24 verse 12 to 14 matthew 24 verse 12 through 14 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wash goals but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come may our lord bless the reading of this world heavenly father bless this word and quicken them in the name of your son jesus christ i pray amen may god bless you the theme of this convention behold the bridegroom comments the selection time the separation time the time when the members of the bride should be set aside for the glorious day the time we are waiting on to be raptured may god bless you we can see all these signs that are coming to pass all over the world and anointing men of god are trying to put together everything they can to get the bride ready in this end time we shall first read in the message the first seal the first seal in paragraph 98 to 99 98 to 99 200 rather what am i trying to say i'm not trying to scare you worry you i want you to be on your toes be ready watching every minute quit your nonsense just get down to business with god because it's later than you think now you remember the true bride no there's a false bride we get that in revelation 17. she said i am a widow and i and i've known it of nothing you see sitting up on this scarlet colored beast and so forth the beast rather now that the true bride will be made up of thousands times thousands of people but it will be the elect out of every church age every time a message went forth and the people believed it and accepted it in all the light it was when they were sealed away until that day of redemption every time they believed it and accepted it in all the light it was glory be to god then they were sealed blessed be the name of the lord then in the message what was the holy ghost given for malachi 4 says same holy spirit that said the lutheran that sanctified the methodist that baptize the pentecostals he's now setting another coming of the lord jesus when it will be so powerful that body that is the bride will come into this group a church that will draw the rest of them from the grave there will be a resurrection that's what the holy ghost is for what is the holy ghost without us they cannot be made perfect they live in the in one day under that we live in another day when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will rest standard against it they couldn't make an atomic bomb or an automobile they didn't [Music] buy some dust and so forth and take some analysis and try to prove it to make infidels out of people but now when we need it and i believe that the bride all over the world the spirit of god raises the standard what is it is pouring it in spirit then those who are resting out yonder in the grave are under the artery of god as the scripture says are crying how long lord how long how much longer god is waiting on me on you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when god can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and christ become so close together if christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go into the rapture brothers and sisters there shall be a rapture we must go and meet our bridegroom our bridegroom is charity the seven virtues glory be to god and we must get ready with these that is these characters inside of each one of us glory be to god brother branham is saying in the first seal quit your nonsense and go to the main thing and the book of hebrews says leaving the principle of the doctrine of christ and let us go on to perfection there shall be a rapture brethren don't let satan get your attention away from it say amen this morning glory be to god now we are going to say show after a while that just does what we are feeling we are going to show after a while that just those who are filled with the holy ghost god in that rapture yet what is the holy ghost today is the seventh spirit that formed one spirit the rainbow spirit glory be to god you can't just have six virtues and liver the seventh one the brotherly kindness the virtue of the age you must gather all the seven virtues the seven spirit that form one spirit the holy ghost today the person of christ say amen and i believe this morning i believe with all my heart that the message has been brought forth and echoed back to keep us from being distracted and lost in this day and to have the seven virtues to grow and grow in our soul that's by resurrection power glory be to god glory be to god be anointed be quickened satan won't prevail we are on our way to resurrection we are on our way to resurrection say amen this morning and i believe with all my heart i believe with all my heart that the voice of resurrection is in the bride the voice of resurrection is in the bride and we have to go and meet our lord hear that challenge you are unto the end don't you come and then go state the message is real the virtues are real he's the character of god there shall be trials that shall be absent down but the character of god shall be formed in the image of christ inside of you till christ becomes visible and this is the season this is the time i believe it with all my heart you must believe it you must say amen you must be anointed this morning and i believe that as you're hearing this message your soul is quickened your soul is revived and this morning you're going to stand like a stand up like a like a talker and go forward he does have an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church this morning glory be to god glory be to god may god richly bless you i believe i believe that there is a pride marching on and nothing shall be able to stop her in this end time nothing our bridegroom cometh quickly there shall be a separation of the resurrection those who have been prepared those who matured those who came to maturity i'm not talking about bastard children the children will form the image of christ they are the one who shall grow up the image from inside of them years after years charity charity is not coming it's here charity is here it's not coming you must get possession of it so it can get possession of you too glory be to god may god richly bless you god bless you brother may god bless our brothers may god bless you may god bless this conviction and may god's peace rest upon every one of you may god bless you praise god at this moment i'm just here to greet the convention and let us build our hearts for a word of prayer before i say anything heavenly father we are most grateful to be in your presence and to be part of this great convention and to be part of this inspiration that you laid on the heart of your servant with a solomon to put this together lord what a seasonal inspiration father we ask for your blessing upon these meetings may you bless all the organizers all of them that are supporting to make it a success bless all the bride of christ across the world that would view this virtual meetings and father may the anointing be so much that even in their homes in their churches in their working places they will have an atmosphere as never before grant your grace upon me at this moment and bless me in a special way as i greet the saints father may this greeting be a blessing to somebody in jesus mighty name i ask you with thanksgiving amen so god bless you it's good to be a part of this great convention bra solomon god we should bless you for your love and for trying to put this together every december we put our shoulders to the wheel to support you in this um great christmas meetings the inspiration bra solomon put together is behold the bridegroom cometh lamp trimming time and i'm identified with this inspiration because our message that we have believed by malachi false prophets is a lamp treatment message and this message gets us ready for the rapture i want to greet brother theo overt and the entire headstone tabernacle team for their support putting this together for us to be part of this meetings and to listen to all the ministers across the globe the world condition is not helping us to meet physically but by god's grace we are able to meet virtually and listen to all the ministers that will speak in this meetings so god bless you shall we take our bibles as i read from first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 to 18. the bible said but i will not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep jesus will bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and let's put a lot of emphasis on that with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen and that is the only event that we are waiting for the coming of the lord all the signs and wonders have been done already all the mysteries have been spoken already the only event that the church the bride is waiting for is the coming of the lord and paul said we should comfort one another with these words that jesus is going to come we are we are going to see him face to face we are going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye from this body into a glorious body to me the lord in the air and i'm an expectation for this change in the message the rapture abram said the first thing comes when he starts descending from heaven he says there is a shout amen the process of his coming is a shout a voice and a trump and the first thing is there's a shout so what is it it's a message to get the people ready the shout is to get the people ready that is the message that put us in readiness that's the message that gets you to trim your lump so a message come from first and said now lamb trimming time so the message comes forth and it's now what lump trimming time so rise and trim your alarms so what watch was that it wasn't the six watch it was the seventh watch oh you cannot trim your lamp in the sixth watch no but the seventh so behold the bridegroom comet rise and trim your lamps and they said some of them found they didn't have any oil in the alarms see but islam trimming time praise god islam dreaming time the message has gone forth we've seen the signs we've seen the wonders we've seen all the miracles take place max 16 is being fulfilled in all the holy ghost field ministries all the holy ghost field church marxist 10 is fulfilled the signs shall follow them that believe it's lump treatment time church it's malachi 4 time it's saint luke 17 time he said all those prophecies that can perfectly set in order for this day in the scripture we see a living right there so this message of the hour this message spoken through the lips of malachi false prophet was a shout message to get us prepared to train our alarms and get us prepared to leave this earth to get ready to go home praise god so if you are in this message this message is not just another preacher preaching something no it's a message to get you ready in the message here as i get ready to leave here escape heather i come quickly the prophet said christ declared himself to every nation and through every generation he's doing it today the church normally sets asleep the chest spiritual is awake church nominal is sleeping but the chest spiritual is awake the sleeping virgin has went off to sleep don't forget they were all virgins the sleeping virgin has what went off to sleep that would take the tribulation period so that sleep investment will go through the tribulation but the one that has the oil in your lamp is ready and you are the one that had the oil in your land you've had the short message you believed it and the voice is in the bride the voice is in you said blessed be the name of the lord so how i love the problem of the virgin you know the old cold oil lamps we used to have we never had like um lights till the the till just recently so and look here the oil is in the bottom of the lamp and there is a wig that draws it up now that week has to be a special made piece of material and the fire comes on the end of the week the prophet said here and now notice you couldn't put a pipe down in there and it would draw it up it won't come through iron-made man-made thins it's a special material the wig that goes into the lantern that goes into the lamp is a special made material you cannot just cut your clothes and put it in there it's a special made material it only comes through god's provided way and this message is providing that this shout message is providing that now listen to the prophet and the weak is faith so this message what is it doing it's pushing what faith in the believer that weak that special made material is faith not just any ordinary faith but perfect faith anointed faith and the weak is faith and the only thing that can pull the holy spirit into light is the holy ghost itself oh my and when you got your faith one end of it on fire on fire for the glory of god and the other dip into god's holy ghost oil there's going to be a shining light as certain as i'm standing in this pulpit and this day the bride who i believe this message of the hour who are feeding on this unfailing body word of this message of the hour that faith is built in the bride that's why the brahmanas could say that the end time con the end time message will meet the end time conditions because this message builds a special faith in the bride that is dip into the oil and when the fire is lit on the other end it never runs dry you can always trim your lamp in the darkest hour when the shower comes forth you are ready to trim your lamps amen he's sure and certain that when a man is built with faith built in that special material oh praise god and is dipped in that oil of the holy ghost his light will never go off but if you got it down in all mixed up with water today you are in shape tomorrow you don't believe the message the next department if you got it all mixed down with water you know what it will do it will sputter you can never trim your lump it takes a total surrendering to this message because this message supports the lamb and once the the the weak is dipped in the oil it builds a special fate in you that you can always trim your lamp that's what the matter with the lamps of today of many they are sputtering amen because today they believe tomorrow they don't believe but we thank god that there is a group of people who are wise virgins they are pure they believe this message of their hour it is totality in its fullness and nothing can change them amen so we thank god for the message which is putting us in readiness for the coming of the lord friends loved ones the only thing left is the coming of the lord and you have to be ready and the only preparation to make you ready is this message of the hour that's the only thing that you can use to trim your lamp nothing else apart from this message of the hour god we should bless you god bless the convention god bless every individual and merry christmas to every one who is watching this meetings amen shall we bother our heads for a prayer father we thank you for this meetings once again lord we are grateful to be a part of the bride of christ in this hour to be a part of the called our lord bless every individual this morning or this evening this afternoon wherever they are listening to from the globe lord may they receive such a blessing as never before may they resonate with this message of the hour that you send malachi false prophets saying luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 angel to speak lord and father we have believed it and lord we know that is what is keeping us in

hallelujah in this message between the church edges and the seven seas it is not his watch look at this you broke the seals you reveal the mysteries and at the last church the only one that is living the rest of them are sleeping and he said that if he comes in the first watch second watch third watch and so forth down to the seventh watch and in the seventh watch a command or a call went out behold the groom behold the bridegroom cometh [Music] blessed be his holy name hallelujah oh thank you lord thank you jesus in this message [Music] and he said he now remember the bible said in the seventh watch that's right some of them slept at the first watch at the second one are they felt at the fourth at the people [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] not another message in every age we found the very same sample this is why the light comes through a messenger in a certain place and then from this messenger [Music] [Music] the lights come in a certain area and this glorious message is spread through channels people who were faithfully taught people were faithfully we were faithfully taught from 1963 [Music] so these ministers we were faithfully taught the message [Music] it is about experiences experiences in the life of people not another thing [Applause] we have to be very careful to just listen one voice for the spirit has only one voice that is the voice of god and paul as peter wants them to just repeat just repeat what he said and he want them saying [Music] that even if himself cannot change one ayatollah and the revival was down i want to take one of the fights that was faithfully taught brother joseph coleman look at watch all his messages it is to bring man in an experience for the shout message declares behold the bridegroom cometh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye going out to meet him this is love dreaming time this is the time to be conscious that i do have an experience with god there and by the way the revival washed down and while we were ministering the message was just quite quiet for he believed nothing of what we were seeing for his own past to believe that william pronoun he is the person of the holy spirit that william pronoun is jesus christ that william [Music] is the great elohim himself amen [Music] and then he made a rainbow a complete rainbow and then the past will tell them the person will say something against against these speeches he will die right away and then one day he came to see me and then we were speaking and i told him about what you believe and all those pictures it is the devil [Applause] and then he was waiting to see if i would die right away and he went to sleep early in the morning he came to knock at my door and i told him i'm still alive and then i opened the door and he just saw me alive and then he changed his doctrine and we baptized him again in the name of the lord jesus christ and he called his pastor he said i don't believe again what i used to believe before and he said what happened and then he gave back the testimony and the pastor said i need to see those people and we went back we went we went to congo and we speak with him about fog for about two days and we told him that prophet said from the day of pentecost up to the last elected get into the body of christ the baptism in the name of jesus christ still the same he will baptize contrary to that is a curse the one you call your guards curse you [Applause] they just got that spirit that i am the holy ghost i am this i am that i am this amen but nevertheless there are some elected god has fighters god has spiritual commandos god has sons and daughters of god amen in the year 2000 [Music] may god bless this man of god amen and brother although he has never never changed the way he preached the gospel he always preached the life of jesus he always preached that divine nature he always preaches on a spirit and a divine experience amen when we we were receiving the tapes of brother thereof he's always in the ephesians he's always in the book of it is joshua in the life of jesus christ leave the voices and when you listen to jesus it is still the same life of
