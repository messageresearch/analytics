Heavenly Father, we thank you for guiding us together and we thank you for this great opportunity you have given us to serve you in the final closing hours of time. The time itself runs out. When the angel came down 10, the voice said, "Time shall be no more." Time itself runs out. Help us, Lord, tonight by your word and by your spirit to climb a little higher, to go a little further, to go a little deeper, that we could catch your mind, your intelligence for as for this hour. Granted, God in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you. Welcome. I trust the Lord that you're doing fine. And I trust the Lord that all your experiences has been to encourage you because the devil job is to bring great discouragement, depression and frustration. And once it gets into that discouraging tend to lose faith and you know as the prophet says just as fate uh send away sickness and so on, unbelief will bring it right back. And you have to hold your grounds. You have to hold and maintain your grounds at grounds of faith. Tonight I have something special I like to share with you tonight and the scripture I have is from Exodus chapter 6 want to read from 1 to8. Exodus chapter 6 reading from 1 to8. It reads thus. Then the Lord said unto Moses, "Now shalt thou see what I shall do to Pharaoh, for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land." And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord. And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, unto Jacob, by the same the name of God Almighty. But by my name Jehovah, was I not known to them. And I have also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant. Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments, and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God, and he shall know that I am the Lord. your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. And I will bring you into unto the land concerning which I swear to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it to you, give it to you from heritage. I am the Lord. May God bless his word. And this is such a inspiring scripture and how God choose to introduce himself. He said, "I am the Lord." That statement separates the Lord from every false god and idol. It defines and declares identity, who he is. It defines his authority. Thou shalt see what I shall do unto Pharaoh. It defines his sovereignity over nations and people. Now, could you imagine how angry and upset God is when you see people worshiping idols of stone, of wood, of gold, of car, of man and woman and beast and whatever it is when he know that is foolishness. The first thing he said, I am the Lord. So it define who he is over nation and people. And he shall know that I am the Lord which bringeth you from under the burdens of the Egyptians. And this word struck me and you shall know. And this you shall know comes by act of deliverance, restoration or judgment. God by mighty acts of judgment or deliverance or restoration make the people to know who is God. And it struck me that God is going to make himself known, not just to us, not just to the church, not just to his people, but to the entire world. Look at this scripture here in Joel 2 when he begin to describe, be glad then anything of Zion, rejoice in the Lord, for he given unto you the former raid moderately. So he's prophesying what is going to happen. He will cause to come down for you to rain the former rain, the latter rain in the first month. So you don't have to doubt because he going to do it. And the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil. And I will restore to you the years that the locust had eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar and the palm worm. My great armies I sent among you, and he shall eat prophecy in plenty and be satisfied. and praise the name of the Lord your God that address wonders with you and my people shall never be ashamed. And here the hear the scripture now. And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and I am the Lord and none else and my people shall never be ashamed. You know years I keep preaching and teaching that this message world have not seen judgment yet. They have not seen God's hands of wrath and vengeance. I said something that spit out my mouth on Sunday came out that God will remove some completely off the chessboard and leave some to demonstrate his judgment. So these acts of God are the means by which God shows himself to nations, the peoples and tongues. This will be seen. This will be known. God will declare himself that the people may know. So don't think for one moment this God is bash ashful and shy and he's hiding somewhere he don't want to get himself out there to be known. No that the world may know he is intent on making himself known to the entire world. So the title of this exhortation tonight is deliverance restoration or judgment that the people may know that I am the Lord. Look how he declares his judgment on nations. The first nation, just a few examples I want to give you to get on what we're in, is Moab. Ezekiel 25:11, he says this, "And I will execute judgments upon Moab, and they shall know that I am the Lord upon the Philistines." Ezekiel 25:1 16. Therefore, thus sayeth the Lord God, behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines. I will cut off the ter the cherithims and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes and they shall know that I am the Lord when I shall lay my vengeance upon them. Zidon Ezekiel 28 21-23. Solomon set thy face against Zidon. prophesy against it and say, "Thus sayeth the Lord God, behold, I'm against thee, O Zidon, and I will glorist listen. and I will be glorified in the midst of thee, and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and be sanctified in her, and I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets, and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon every on every side, and they shall know that I am the Lord. So I'm showing you here and this is this is it has much more but I just example here three examples that God sees himself being glorified being identified being sanctified through judgment upon peoples upon nations upon lands. In Elijah's time the people were backsiden and we know the story. I'm just going to read a little part of the scripture. When Elijah talk about if God is God serve him and he put a challenge to Bal and all the worshippers and so on and we know what Elijah did he put the wood in order cut the bullet in pieces and he filled four barrels of water pour it upon the bird sacrificing on the wood because what was the story what was the challenge led to God that answer by fire not coats everybody had the coats everybody have books everybody had tapes but fire now and he says pour water on the burnt sacrifice on the wood He said, "Do it a second time." This is a second time. He said, "Do it a third time." Did it a third time. And the water ran round about the altar, and he filled the trench also with water. And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet came near, and said, "This is his prayer. Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou has turned their heart back again. So this was a restoration here by manifestation. And the Bible said to verse 38, the fire, then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burn sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and lick up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their face and they said, "The Lord, he is the God. The Lord, he is the God." When the people saw it, not heard it, but saw it, it was God demonstrating his power through that Elijah prophet. And the people had to confess the Lord, he is the God. And I'll close off this portion here with one more. I think we struck it on on Sunday. And Nars and Safy and we know the story. And Peter said, "Why had Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghost concerning the piece of land?" He asked them, "Is it worth the full price?" And they said, "Yes, it was a lie. Why it remained? Was it not thine own after it was sold? Was it not in thine own power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? Thou has not lied unto men, but unto God." So here was the axe church. Here was the church in action, the bride church in action. This was beyond books and tapes. They had none of that. Then this was be unwritten. This was living word. This was living God in a people being made manifest. And as hearing these words fell down, give up the ghost. Great fear came on all them that heard these things. His wife came in. You know what happened to her? And at the ending, she fell straight away at her feet, at his feet, yielded up the ghost. Young men came in, found a dead barrier for buried her by her husband. And great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things. So this is what I try to introduce to you now that this is going to repeat this going to happen. God making himself known that I am the Lord. It's like him declaring himself amidst all the gods the mini G's amidst all the idols amidst all the denomination and those are also idols people worshiping their churches and their ministry and ministers and different things like that amidst all that idolatry God could come down and say I am the Lord I'm going to prove that to you but Brandham familiar quote when a church is groaning because you say I've heard the cries of my people believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost just as real as it was to Pentecost. And I hope you don't get fed up tired me hearing preaching this and saying this because this is a promise. How they grown and cry on labor pains. But when they born and positionally born, God set the church in order. Nature itself is groaning. All the world is groaning. Waiting for what? For the manifestations plural of the sons of God. Waiting for the church to get back in its place again. Sons of God to be made manifest. waiting for that hour. I hope that don't hurt. I just had to say it. The church is so far away from its place. It needs to be back to be sons and daughters again, rulers, governors of the earth under the spiritual reign. It will be someday when the chief one comes. Jesus Christ nature is grown. And I'm going to close familiar quote. The bride has no revival as yet. There'll be no revival there. No manifestation of God to the bride. You're looking for it. It will take those seven thunders get to wake her up again. He will send it one to he promised it. So he will send it. He promises. But this is the part I want to get to. Now if the churches would forget their creeds, forget their dogmas and take the Bible and keep the promises. And if you check out all the false doctrines have now in this message, they're only quoting and twisting and and kneading like flour and putting their own yeast and interpretation and they making a good bake and giving the people and serving them to eat. But it it have addition inside of there. But he say if they could take the Bible because what the prophet came to do is to reveal the Bible. So whatever he says have to be able to slide back in the scriptures. A lot of doctrine and teachings it could hang in the message and they could they could play what I call verbal verbal gymnastics with it in the message. But they cannot play verbal gymnastics in the Bible. So if it cannot come true from Genesis to revelation, it's it's time to throw it out. If they will take the Bible and plead the promise, he said then it will become effective to them. But Jesus said you with your tradition make the word of none effect. So we want to pray tonight but we want it to be effective. So that is why in a couple of the prayer services we talk about dropping yours. If you have something the altar make it right. Why? Because we want your prayer go through. We don't want your prayer stuck on the roof, stuck by your chair or chucked by a table wherever you sitting or kneeling tonight. But we want your prayer to go straight up to heaven and glory. But a Brandon says he says when a man made God what he said while he was pray okay there was a old man one time that he wouldn't he couldn't make up his mind the devil kept beating him out of it one day out the cornfield. So he's getting licks in his mind and one day in the cornfield he needed to pray while he was praying he drove down a stub whatever that is stick it down on the ground and said let this be a memorial Satan. So he's talking to the devil. If you ever come to me again, I will point you to this stub. I will tell you that right here I met God and it was settled from here on. That's what we need. Maybe not a stub in a field, but somewhere, some secret closet, some place or tonight there will be hundreds of vows taken, thousands of them taken. And next year we will be have to take them all over again. We were saying we will quit lying. We will quit doing this. We will lay aside our temper. We will do more for God. We will do this that or the other only to find this in vain. But what a man needs to do tonight is to come face to face with God. And from then on, he's a changed creature. I wish I could tell it the way I believe it. But when a man meets God, he is changed from that minute. Oh, blessed be the Lord. The sick man can walk in the face of God. When the doctors had said he's going to die, he can walk in the face of God and plead his case and he will come away a different person. And I like this word to plead to please to beg to ask to remind God of what he promised. So children of Israel came to the point when they could say, "Lord, you promise to send a deliverer. Oh God, send a deliverer now. Oh God, send your deliverer. Whoever it is, send it. Lord, send deliverance. Send a deliverer. And then he come and say, I've heard the cries of my people, pleasing the promise. And I think almost done. Wow, this is great. Baron said he here. Some time ago, I was called to a bedside looking out of a meeting and there was a young boy dying and the old father came to me 15 years ago, I guess, would come to my son. He says dying with a horrible thing, a disease of the heart. And I said, I beg your pardon. It went to his heart and he said I was about 40 years old. I said well I'm 40 years old. My faith tells me it's all right for me to go and pray for this man want to be prayed for and so on. And the man himself the doctor I understood was Catholic. He said I want to ask you something. If I was a priest this man so he didn't want him and it was the last rights and bam got to go through. He said I went in there and the boy was so low till he was just barely breathing. He had been unconscious about two days. I didn't understand medicine and the great scientific research that God has let men do for sick people. I forget what the beat was. I was almost gone. So the mother was standing there. I spoke to her. So I got to the other side of the bed and then he says, "So I went across to the other side of the bed, knelt down and just a simple prayer and laid hands upon the boy. I said, "Lord Jesus, this father and mother has brought me here to pray for their son and he's dying and only you, Lord, can help him. And I know that you said, "These signs shall follow them that believe." You see what brother I'm doing there? He is praying and he is serving back to God his own words. He is telling God, I know that you said these signs shall follow them that believe. So this is a sample prayer, right? If they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover. And here's words. I plead that promise to you, Lord Jesus, for the sake of this boy's life. That's I said, "Thank you, Lord." No change come at all. The old father raised up and said, "Lord, I'm so grateful to you. Ever grateful for healing my son." And they reach around. The mother fell into his arms. She said, "Dad, think of it. He's going to be well known. I stood and looked and they were happy and rejoicing and weeping and the boy, here we go, was just as low as he could be. They said, "Oh, it's wonderful." And the little nurse looked around. She looked at me, she said, "I believe you you misunderstand the doctor's orders." She said, "I believe you misunderstand the boy's dying." Oh, the old man said, "No, he isn't dying. He's going to live." And so she said look sir I appreciate anyone having faith like that but said how can you laugh and gone like that and you see there's no difference in the boy and said the boy will die I said she he can't live well well well we don't see how he has lived this long said it's never been known in among sick people or science rather that a person ever went that low with a heartbeat like that some kind of cardiogram or something that never come back again and I will never forget that old man. He put his hands upon her shoulder just like a father to a daughter. He said, "Look, my dear child, that cardiogram is what you are looking at. That is what you are trained to look at. That's all you know about is that cardiogram. But I'm looking at a divine promise." The boy is married, got three children. Now, it depends on what you're looking at. He never got any better for two or three days. But after a while, the first thing you know here, he come right out of it, went home, he's a missionary in South Africa now with three children. Now see, it just goes to show or you've got to be persistent that never butter that old man that settle. So friend, I am convinced that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of Malachi 4, the God of the Bible, will make himself known to nations, to people, whether in deliverance, whether in restoration or whether in judgment. In the church, he demonstrated his power and make himself known. When Saul was blind and he was told to go to get hands laid on him to receive his sight, God was taking a man that was persecuting the church to make him a mighty gentile, a mighty prophet of God for this hour, for that hour. Paul an apostle. Paul a prophet. Paul had to humble himself to to to lay to get hands laid on him to receive his sight, to receive the Holy Ghost. that man called and the church had to receive him as a messenger from God. What God is going to do in this last day when he say I will cause to come down for you the rain, the former and latter rain in the first. I want to encourage you tonight. Don't let go. Don't give up. Don't trust your own senses and feelings. Believe what God says. God is truly bigger than your problem. God have the whole world to deal with. Your problem is a small thing in his sight. Be burly. Ask for big things. Come on a great expectation Sunday. Invite somebody out. Share the link with somebody to encourage them to encourage some soul out there. I want you to press forward in faith. Great faith. Show your faith. This family that son was prayed for in that short prayer. A long long johnong prayer. Just a short prayer believing that God will do it by reminding God what he promised. There are so much promises that we have preached, so much promises inside on in you that you could anoint. God promised the Holy Ghost. God promised revival. God promised super church, super race. God promised you to be strong. God promised you to be a overcomer. God promised you dominion, to be a king and a priest. All these are promises that you could remind God of what he promised and you could have a a hold of him tonight in prayer. Let us bow our heads. Heavenly Father, it was such an excitement to come to share these words with your people that you told Moses, "See what I will do with Pharaoh. You shrink Pharaoh down to size." And you could tell your servant and prophet Moses, "Look what I'm going to do to that man. Look what I'm going to do to Egypt. I'm going to judge Egypt, but I'm going to deliver you because we have our flesh to contend with this flesh, this Egypt, this world. But Lord, you promise a total and complete deliverance. Not just a perfect standing by your blood, but a perfect state by your spirit. Father God, will you give the people a witness of your spirit tonight by baptizing them with your Holy Ghost right where they are even now tonight? Give them experience of the glory, vision, revelation, inspiration, and of your presence. release the uncction that may cross into you. There are many that battle with depression, frustration, discouragement, feeling Lord out of it. But I pray somehow this word pierce through just as you could deal with Moab, you could deal with the Philistines, you could deal with Zidon and told them about the judgments coming to them. Right in our news, we just hear bloodshed in the streets and and all kind happening and we don't even know the magnitude of what has happened to that country and that nation. why it is what it is, why it is how it is. But here we are Lord in the midst of prophecies being fulfilled. Here we are Lord looking for own victory looking like how Caleb look 40 years now therefore give me my mountain. Father God give the people great courage not to go into that channel of I'm unworthy and I don't deserve it and all that sort of negative stuff. But may they understand as Samson broke through to recognize the locks have been restored. He could pray once more. Lord, Samson, saw a possibility. Samson, so an opportunity. May our people tonight see a possibility, an opportunity. Whether they sick with disease, cancer, tumor, whatever condition they are in tonight, may they believe in their heart, I am the Lord that healed thee. God, give great courage to your people to believe in signs, wonders, and miracles. You are still a work of miracle. Work a miracle for them tonight. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you. I trust the Lord that this uh was inspiring to you and an encouragement to you that you would go forward in faith to believe that God will do more than you could ever ask or think. So God bless you as we get down to prayer. Praise the Lord. Thank you Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. [Music] Thank you. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.

Father, believing all the promises spoken by this end time prophet messenger that you have sent in this last day before the terrible day of the Lord. Father God, the time of judgment, the time of restoration, the time of redemption. Oh, I thank you for the people gathered here tonight. May your blessings and the canopy of life fall over them, Lord. Even charity, the love of God take away all evil, all unbelief, everyone not like you, Father. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. We bless it tonight, Lord. We worship you, Lord. We thank you for healing. We thank you for deliverance. We thank you for your virtue. We thank you for strength. We thank you for encouraging us. We thank you for inspiring us. We thank you for drawing us near unto you. Even as your word declare, "Draw nigh unto me, I'll draw nigh unto you." You promise these things, Lord. You promise, "My people that call by my name shall humble himself and pray that we will hear from heaven." And Lord, you would heal our land. This is your word. You cannot change that. You spoke that. We plead these promises Lord that oh God this will become effective to us Lord. We don't want to be like scribe and Pharisees and just going with traditions. We want this word to be a learn reality. We want this word to become flesh. We want this word in the young people and the mothers, the fathers, the husbands, the wives, the brothers and sisters. We want this word be expressed. We want this word be on fire in the church. Lord, if each the person, Lord, if the people would forget their dogmas, forget their own ideas, forget their feelings and just plead what you promised. Take the Bible, you said, and plead a promise. By stripe, I'm healed. I am delivered. I'm free. Oh God, you promise and make us the head, not the tail. You promise to raise us up in good health and strength that we could serve you better. Oh God, heal the sick in our midst, Lord. Touch the elders, touch the deacons, touch the trustees. Father God, touch the anchor points in the church. Go from the pulpit to the backbench. Father, may your virtue flow to the sisters, to the brothers, to the single ones, to the married ones. Oh God, flow onto them, Father, with your love and with your presence. Life is just temporary. We're in a temporary holy be. Father, as we step out, oh God, in faith, to connect with eternity, oh God, help us tonight. Bless the upcoming service, this coming Sunday, this special youth oriented service. May you inspire it. May the anointing come down upon it. And most importantly, may you confirm the word with signs, wonders, miracles, and mighty deliverances granted, God, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost being poured among your people in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. Glory. Hallelujah. God bless you, saints. It's so good to be here. So good to have you. And I commit you into the hands of God and pray that God will bless you and keep you and preserve you. God bless you and see you on Sunday. Lord be with you. Praise the Lord.
