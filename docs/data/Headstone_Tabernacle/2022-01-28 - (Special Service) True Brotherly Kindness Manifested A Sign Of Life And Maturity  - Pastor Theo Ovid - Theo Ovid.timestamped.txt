[12:46] and we have one prayer request
[12:48] tonight for
[12:50] sister wendy blade's granddaughter
[12:53] who has been taken to the hospital i
[12:55] don't know what's the full condition the
[12:56] case
[12:57] but we want to pray for her tonight
[13:00] she's the wendy blade's granddaughter
[13:04] so let us
[13:05] she was actually taken to the emergency
[13:07] room
[13:08] let's all hear that heavenly father we
[13:10] thank you for
[13:12] your presence tonight and you promised
[13:14] with the twos and three the gathered
[13:15] lord and lord we in this virtual room
[13:17] tonight and we want to agree and we have
[13:20] a sister wendy blitz granddaughter who
[13:22] has been taken to the emergency alone in
[13:24] the hospital
[13:25] and to the doctor and we don't know what
[13:27] the case is but lord you know exactly
[13:29] what the condition is and we pray a
[13:31] healing virtue and strength will reach
[13:33] out to that child
[13:34] and heal and touch and deliver in the
[13:36] name of jesus and fathers we
[13:39] come to your word and to the service
[13:41] here tonight this special service
[13:43] i pray that you would inspire word to
[13:45] our hearts may the word truly become
[13:47] flesh but the bible becomes a fresh book
[13:49] a new book where we see clearly the
[13:52] vision of god granted father
[13:54] in jesus might ask it amen and amen but
[13:57] god bless you and welcome welcome thanks
[14:00] for taking the time off to be here
[14:02] with us tonight
[14:04] i certainly
[14:06] appreciate
[14:07] um the bible study on tuesday
[14:10] about dealing with conflict i think
[14:13] that if god would help us and
[14:16] to get
[14:18] to
[14:19] deal with things not just like
[14:22] preaching and teaching and so on but
[14:25] the practical part of life
[14:27] about isaac will often see we would see
[14:30] things present in life
[14:32] and godliness
[14:33] and um we want to continue
[14:36] on a certain vein tonight um
[14:38] and i trust it will help you
[14:41] and
[14:42] you know in this hustle and bustle of
[14:44] life sometimes we we're just speeding
[14:47] we're just pissing on the road
[14:49] not taking time to
[14:52] observe to look
[14:54] to read to read again
[14:56] to listen again and when we begin to
[14:58] listen and
[14:59] slow down we see things a bit different
[15:03] we have to
[15:05] and it reminds me of life
[15:07] in your youth
[15:08] you operate with peace
[15:10] and as you get older
[15:12] you find it's not that you can't do
[15:14] peace and push
[15:16] but you find yourself
[15:18] being thrown down so you get slow down
[15:20] your whole beat and rhythm
[15:22] make it things through a lot of things
[15:25] and that is why
[15:27] i think he was asked what age you would
[15:29] like to be
[15:30] and it's something like
[15:32] in late 70s or whatever it is because
[15:34] your past really you can pass through so
[15:36] much of an experience you would be
[15:39] a learned person by them
[15:41] an experienced person right there you
[15:43] would have your regrets you would have
[15:45] your failures you would have your fears
[15:47] and all what you have been through
[15:49] but you were able to look back at life
[15:50] and see you know
[15:52] where you could have done better
[15:53] where you didn't do your best
[15:55] but as we are here tonight we are here
[15:58] to share
[16:00] um
[16:01] i
[16:02] have some stuff i can read but i don't
[16:04] know what
[16:05] god will do tonight i'm open and
[16:07] i trust them that you get the help
[16:09] because that's what we come here for
[16:10] tonight you know to get help help from
[16:12] god all of us
[16:15] so i want to kind of connect a bit
[16:18] with what isaac said because when he was
[16:20] preaching about conflict i couldn't help
[16:22] but think about
[16:24] this scripture from genesis to thing
[16:27] and i'll just read it out to you before
[16:28] we go into our thing tonight
[16:30] and abram went up out of egypt he and
[16:33] his wife and all that he had
[16:35] and lot
[16:36] with him into the salt
[16:39] and abram
[16:40] was very rich
[16:42] in cattle
[16:44] in silver and in gold
[16:46] and he went on his journey from the
[16:48] south
[16:49] he went to bethel unto the place where
[16:50] his tent had been at the beginning
[16:53] between battle and high
[16:55] unto the place of the altar which he had
[16:57] made there at the first
[16:59] and abram called the name of the lord on
[17:01] the name of the lord
[17:02] another also which went with abraham had
[17:05] flocks and hoods and tents
[17:08] and the land
[17:09] hit us
[17:10] was not able to bear them
[17:13] not because they were small
[17:16] they they had a lot also had abra with
[17:20] abram had flocks
[17:22] and hoods
[17:24] and tents
[17:25] so there was big movement
[17:27] and big
[17:29] multiplication and growth on on these
[17:31] two sides of this family here lot labor
[17:35] the land was not able to be at them vi
[17:37] that they may dwell together for their
[17:39] substance was great
[17:42] so that they could not dwell
[17:44] together and there was a strife between
[17:47] the herdsmen of abraham's cattle
[17:49] and the hood men of lot's cattle
[17:51] and the canaanites and the paris i dwelt
[17:53] down in the land and iran said unto lot
[17:56] let
[17:57] there be no strife i pray thee
[17:59] between me and thee
[18:01] and between my his men and i heard them
[18:04] for we be brethren but isaac was talking
[18:06] about being a peacemaker
[18:08] and wanted peace and bible speaks about
[18:11] as much as possible live peacefully with
[18:13] all men both of these guys are rich
[18:16] both of these guys are qualified
[18:18] do they do both of these guys have
[18:20] more than they could you know manage and
[18:22] haven't surrounded and and because of
[18:24] that that greatness
[18:26] and have issues among their herdsmen
[18:30] and look at abram's attitude
[18:33] ibrahim said let there be no strife i
[18:35] pray between me and thee between my
[18:37] husband and that husband for we be
[18:38] brethren it's not the whole land before
[18:41] thee separate thyself i pray thee from
[18:44] me if thou will take the left hand i
[18:46] will go to the right if they'll depart
[18:48] to the right i will go to the left
[18:50] so he was very open
[18:52] he wasn't saying
[18:53] god called me you know and remember you
[18:55] talk alone and remember remember because
[18:58] i'm blessed you are blessed remember you
[18:59] had it had to stay in the back yeah you
[19:01] had to take a sight no
[19:03] abraham wasn't in that beat it was in
[19:06] that zone
[19:07] he says the whole land separate yourself
[19:10] lest you take left right right you're
[19:11] right it's up to you
[19:13] lot
[19:14] so you put the choice over the lot lot
[19:17] lifted up his eyes the senses is all
[19:20] activated now and beheld the plane of
[19:22] jordan it was well watered everywhere
[19:26] before the lord destroyed solomon
[19:27] gomorrah this verse is so well written
[19:30] it's just a
[19:32] class act in writing so he says it all
[19:35] over was well watered everywhere and he
[19:37] had insert now before the lord destroyed
[19:39] some gamora even at the garden of the
[19:42] lord like the land of egypt as thou
[19:44] comest resort then lord choose him or
[19:47] the plane of jordan allah during the
[19:49] east and they separated themselves the
[19:52] one
[19:52] from the other abraham dwell iran of
[19:55] canaan blood dwell in the cities of the
[19:56] plain pictures tend towards some but the
[19:59] men of sodom
[20:00] were wicked and sinners before the lord
[20:02] exceedingly another interjection
[20:04] and the law answered unto abraham after
[20:07] the blood
[20:08] was separated from him
[20:10] lift up now thy eyes and look from the
[20:12] place where thou art not with and
[20:14] southward and eastward and westward for
[20:18] all the land wish taught see us today
[20:20] will i give it
[20:22] until i see it forever and i will make
[20:24] thy seed as the dust of the earth so
[20:26] that if a man can number the dust of the
[20:28] earth then shall thy seed also be
[20:30] numbered arise
[20:32] walk through the land in the length of
[20:34] it and the breath of it for i will give
[20:36] it unto thee
[20:38] and abraham removed his tent
[20:40] and came
[20:41] and went in the flame of mambury which
[20:43] is in hebrew
[20:45] and built the an altar
[20:47] unto the lord
[20:48] it remains then with all the money and
[20:50] wealth
[20:51] with all that he had
[20:54] he chose after god spoke to him
[20:57] to build an altar
[20:58] the bill of altar and offer prayers and
[21:01] praise to god
[21:02] and this is how we have to become things
[21:04] so connected
[21:06] that you have your own altar altering
[21:09] your heart to give praise
[21:11] and thanks to god in the good times
[21:13] in the bad times you are grateful
[21:15] you are thankful
[21:17] so tonight
[21:18] i have a thought
[21:21] and i'll just put a title here true
[21:23] broadly kindness manifested
[21:26] a sign of life
[21:27] and maturity i want to revisit
[21:31] broadly kindness
[21:33] tonight
[21:34] i want to revisit this terminology
[21:37] this thing called broadly kindness
[21:40] and i want to read two portions of
[21:41] scripture from mark 11
[21:43] 22-26
[21:45] and ephesians
[21:46] 4
[21:47] 36-32 if you have your bibles you want
[21:49] to read it so this is where we get
[21:52] going tonight
[21:53] uh mark 11
[21:55] verse 22 to 26 and ephesians 4
[21:58] 30-32
[22:00] reading
[22:01] from verse 22 of mark 11.
[22:03] and jesus answered says unto them
[22:06] have faith in god
[22:08] for verily i say unto you
[22:11] that whosoever shall see unto this
[22:13] mountain
[22:14] be thou removed
[22:16] and be outcast into the sea
[22:18] i shall not doubt in his heart
[22:21] which i believe
[22:23] that those things which he it shall come
[22:25] to pass
[22:27] he shall have
[22:28] whatsoever
[22:30] he's he's here
[22:31] so what he gives here is like the two
[22:33] prophets
[22:35] then he say how to get to dear
[22:37] we go down to step number two
[22:40] therefore is unto you
[22:42] what things so ever you desire
[22:45] when you pray
[22:47] this is the way now
[22:49] believe that you receive them
[22:52] and you shall have them
[22:53] so that's
[22:55] the second ladder of the wrong of the
[22:57] ladder
[22:58] then jesus is drilling down further
[23:01] when you stand praying
[23:04] so in other words
[23:06] uh
[23:07] you have to get to speak the word
[23:09] but before you can speak the word you
[23:10] have to pray
[23:12] now
[23:13] how do you pray
[23:15] when you stand praying
[23:17] forgive
[23:18] if you have an ought against any
[23:21] reason
[23:22] that your father also
[23:24] which is in heaven may forgive you your
[23:27] trespasses
[23:28] but if you do not forgive neither will
[23:30] your father
[23:32] which is in heaven
[23:34] forgive your trespasses
[23:36] and we want to read ephesians
[23:38] 4
[23:39] 30 from in the scripture and grieve not
[23:42] the holy spirit of god
[23:44] whereby you are sealed
[23:46] unto the day of redemption
[23:48] let all bitterness and wrath
[23:51] and anger
[23:53] and clamor
[23:54] and evil speaking be put away from you
[23:56] with all marriage
[23:58] and be kind one to another
[24:01] tender hearted
[24:03] forgiving one another even as god
[24:06] for christ's sake had forgiven you let's
[24:07] pray again
[24:08] heavenly father i pray that your
[24:11] presence would come now
[24:13] upon your word and upon your people
[24:14] right where they are
[24:16] visit them lord with inspiration
[24:19] with revelation
[24:20] with this illness granted father and
[24:22] jesus might ask it
[24:23] email me
[24:25] this here
[24:27] ephesians 4 50
[24:29] was from i want to read this in the
[24:31] amplified
[24:33] and it says here and do not grieve the
[24:35] holy spirit of god
[24:37] do not offend
[24:39] or vex
[24:40] or sadden him
[24:42] by whom you were sealed marked branded
[24:45] as god's own secured
[24:48] for the day of redemption of final
[24:50] deliverance through christ from evil
[24:52] and the consequences of sin
[24:55] here we go
[24:56] let all business
[24:58] and indignation
[25:00] and wrath
[25:02] passion
[25:04] rage by temple now bear in mind he's not
[25:07] talking to sinners here
[25:10] he's not talking to wooly people here
[25:13] he's speaking to the church
[25:15] he's speaking to lies
[25:17] he's speaking to families he speak until
[25:19] hearts little bitterness
[25:21] and indignation
[25:23] and wrath
[25:24] passion rage
[25:26] bad temper
[25:28] and
[25:29] resentment
[25:30] anger
[25:31] animosity
[25:33] and quarrelling
[25:35] brawling clamor contention
[25:38] and slander
[25:39] evil speaking abusive or blasphemous
[25:42] language be banished from you
[25:45] with all malice
[25:46] that is spite
[25:48] ill will
[25:49] or business of any kind
[25:52] and become useful
[25:54] one and helpful too
[25:58] kind to one another
[26:00] tenderhearted
[26:02] compassionate
[26:03] understanding
[26:05] loving-hearted
[26:07] forgiving one another
[26:08] readily and freely
[26:11] as god in christ
[26:14] forgive you
[26:15] and that's the key right there
[26:18] as god
[26:20] in christ
[26:22] forgive you
[26:23] now when they asked jesus the teachers
[26:26] to pray and he began to say our father
[26:28] and heaven will be thy name and he went
[26:30] through that and even praise give us his
[26:32] holy bread and then he brought that part
[26:35] on top there and forgive us
[26:37] of our sins this is christ now teaching
[26:40] the disciples to pray as
[26:43] we forgive those
[26:45] who trespass against us
[26:47] and they come back to what isaac was
[26:50] sharing and teaching on tuesday
[26:53] that conflict is part of life
[26:56] anguish disappointment
[26:59] hurt
[27:00] uh
[27:01] upsets
[27:02] people do you wrong
[27:04] and i was thinking because one or two
[27:06] people point out something that i spoke
[27:09] when i talk about tips and so on life
[27:11] things depends in life and godliness
[27:13] about communication something struck
[27:15] some of the people on communication and
[27:17] i would just like to do something on
[27:19] that it is a deep topic actually
[27:21] communication is a study all by itself
[27:24] people actually get a degree in
[27:26] communication they go and study and get
[27:28] qualified in this thing called
[27:30] communication
[27:31] and i was thinking about it you know
[27:34] sometimes we think communication is talk
[27:36] and you know sometimes i just put it in
[27:38] a flat way which is not really very
[27:41] light the way i might present it
[27:43] um from where the studied people were
[27:45] presented from like i guess i would say
[27:48] communication is when what you speak
[27:50] has reached the person in the same way
[27:52] that you meant it and sent it
[27:54] and but what i recognize now though
[27:56] is that
[27:58] we have
[27:59] how to see it
[28:01] it's almost like if words is like
[28:03] encoded
[28:04] words have to be decoded and everybody
[28:06] have their own encoder inside
[28:09] and it's almost as if
[28:11] we could be hearing the same thing but
[28:13] processing it differently
[28:15] and it's mind-boggling that it's even
[28:17] even possible
[28:18] and
[28:19] what came to my mind is the story of
[28:23] uh being described about the eagle and
[28:25] the chicken how an eagerly an egg
[28:28] and among some chickens and the egg was
[28:31] hatched
[28:32] and the ego was different from the rest
[28:34] of chickens of course and then the great
[28:36] mother eagle passed by and scream out
[28:39] and that eagle recognized that that
[28:41] being that fly over him or something
[28:43] like him
[28:44] and he finally looking just like him and
[28:47] the mother said come on you could fly
[28:48] you could do it
[28:49] and it was a comparison
[28:52] of eagle and chicken
[28:54] and of course we know the story the
[28:55] eagle jump in the barnyard and fly will
[28:57] fly off and so on
[28:59] and
[29:00] somebody heard that story and one person
[29:02] said my
[29:03] i am an eagle
[29:05] and the next person said my that man
[29:07] called me a chicken
[29:09] no
[29:10] it was the same story
[29:13] but whatever is in your system
[29:17] processes it a certain way
[29:20] so
[29:21] like the scripture i actually have it to
[29:23] the pure all things are pure
[29:26] but if there are issues on the inside
[29:29] let's say you're negative
[29:31] then
[29:32] you would be hearing
[29:33] the negative part
[29:35] and you'll be taking something off of
[29:37] that
[29:38] instead of trying to get to the positive
[29:40] part
[29:41] so
[29:43] it really it really takes the holy ghost
[29:45] it really takes a holy ghost to
[29:47] translate
[29:48] that is where we really need divine
[29:50] revelation we need to really hear from
[29:53] god and in sessions like these where
[29:56] things are more caught than taught
[29:59] you have to have an inner ear to listen
[30:01] and to hear what you can learn but you
[30:03] can benefit from them but you can draw
[30:06] from them you know i like
[30:08] as i say when i go to do marital
[30:11] counselling or with a couple or whatever
[30:12] it is i like to
[30:13] carry what i call a toolbox
[30:16] and i would hear the complaints or hear
[30:18] the issues and challenges and said okay
[30:20] let's see if we could look in the
[30:21] toolbox and get some tools
[30:24] and we have a toolbox the two boxes of
[30:26] the bible
[30:27] and that bible have different things
[30:29] that we can look at and go into
[30:32] and um so this one here on broadly
[30:34] kindness forgive us
[30:36] because we have sins we have failures we
[30:38] have short comments we do mistakes we
[30:40] say things we're not supposed to say and
[30:41] we act a certain way we ourselves
[30:45] you yourself would need god's pardon
[30:48] unforgiveness
[30:49] because remember
[30:51] because you are born in sin shape
[30:53] iniquity
[30:54] we are we have a
[30:56] let us say a default
[30:58] world mode a default sin mode a default
[31:02] unbelief mode if i could use that
[31:04] terminology
[31:05] that is why the bible talks about
[31:07] putting you on your lord jesus
[31:09] it's not just well you're waiting for
[31:11] the court to fall on you there are
[31:12] things you have to do in terms of an
[31:14] effort
[31:16] you have to have an intent to change
[31:18] there's some people they love themselves
[31:20] like the story of the woman she husband
[31:22] died when he died he said she said he
[31:24] did and he couldn't change me
[31:26] you know and she's proud of that
[31:28] and she
[31:30] was unchangeable
[31:31] and she will pay the penalty of that
[31:33] kind of attitude and wage of course
[31:35] but the thing of it is
[31:37] all of us like i can say i was a hot
[31:39] tempered person i was a 50 person
[31:42] and over the years
[31:44] i learned to wait i learned to be
[31:47] patient
[31:48] i grew into patience i could wait a long
[31:51] time
[31:51] for things
[31:53] i'm not history or anything
[31:55] and i remember in my early christian
[31:56] experience
[31:57] um coming from a catholic background
[32:00] and um
[32:02] after a while i was going in the wrong
[32:04] direction
[32:06] not even knowing i was going in the
[32:08] wrong direction
[32:09] i love the lord i went to church i'm i
[32:11] believe
[32:13] bible the
[32:13] read scriptures but when my parents and
[32:16] family talk to me and tell me anything
[32:17] it's like i don't have to bother with
[32:18] them because they
[32:20] they don't know what i know
[32:22] they don't understand what i understand
[32:24] and one day
[32:26] my sister told me you are so hard like
[32:29] nobody can get to you
[32:32] and then it hit me
[32:34] that this is not the right direction
[32:37] and i said to her
[32:39] sorry
[32:40] please forgive me and she was in shock
[32:45] and i was in shock that she was in shock
[32:48] and i would never forget that experience
[32:51] she was in shock
[32:52] she said i never knew you could see that
[32:56] and sometimes i'm wondering
[32:59] how hard it is
[33:01] to say i'm sorry
[33:03] forgive me
[33:06] how hard is this to see
[33:08] you know i was wrong
[33:11] i thought wrong
[33:13] i acted wrong
[33:15] i was wrong about this forgive me i'm
[33:16] sorry i had the wrong thoughts about you
[33:21] and but this to me i
[33:23] see it as something almost impossible
[33:26] for somebody to go through a christian
[33:28] walk on christian life
[33:29] without being able to express those
[33:31] words
[33:32] i remember
[33:34] a service i was a young christian wasn't
[33:36] minister just a normal believer
[33:39] and the pastor came and preached and he
[33:42] was speaking against another minister
[33:46] and
[33:47] i just came in and i just taken what
[33:49] he's seen not knowing he's putting seeds
[33:53] against another brother
[33:55] and i find myself
[33:57] disliking
[33:59] not having anything to do with that
[34:00] minister brother and so on like that
[34:02] and afterwards i recognize but this
[34:03] can't be right i don't even know the
[34:05] brother he doesn't
[34:07] i i why would i
[34:09] why would i think so but you see
[34:13] words are powerful
[34:15] and seeds are powerful
[34:18] words
[34:19] we speak to our children
[34:22] words we speak to ourselves
[34:25] words we speak to
[34:27] others
[34:28] words are seeds
[34:30] because a long story short i don't know
[34:32] why i'm introduction this during the
[34:33] testimony
[34:34] but
[34:35] that same brother that i had an issue
[34:38] with
[34:38] without a cause if i could use those
[34:40] words
[34:41] eventually
[34:42] he actually became my pastor i actually
[34:45] had to go to him and repent of course
[34:48] because that's what we have to do
[34:50] when things are not as it's supposed to
[34:52] be we supposed to say sorry
[34:54] i was wrong
[34:56] i
[34:57] shouldn't have done that
[34:59] and i didn't even have a clue that he
[35:01] one day would be even my pastor
[35:03] but that is how life is i'll just say
[35:05] that with you
[35:06] that this thing called
[35:08] forgiveness
[35:10] it is real
[35:11] and um
[35:13] you have to experience god's pardon
[35:17] to get a grasp
[35:19] of how god wants you
[35:22] to pardon others and to forgive others
[35:25] if you yourself never had an experience
[35:28] and i use the word experience
[35:30] of god pardoning grace
[35:33] i don't know how
[35:35] you would be un to understand what it is
[35:37] to partners the bible give a parable you
[35:40] know the problem the man who was
[35:42] forgiven for a small stuff he was in
[35:44] prison and got released
[35:46] and then he he come like he got
[35:49] free for a hundred dollars and then he
[35:51] comes and locked my neck for ten dollars
[35:53] and they said buying him bring him back
[35:54] inside because he qualified
[35:57] and we have to be careful
[36:00] there are lots of quotes
[36:02] but i'm talking about you're standing
[36:03] over here
[36:04] on
[36:05] on one ought
[36:07] you're
[36:08] dangling over hell
[36:10] or against your brother the doctor
[36:12] begins a brother could be against your
[36:13] wife
[36:14] you could think of your husband because
[36:16] your children
[36:17] could be those in your family that
[36:18] embarrass you and if you feel
[36:20] embarrassed and hood
[36:22] and
[36:23] you more
[36:25] you you are more caught up in your own
[36:27] embarrassment
[36:28] than the condition of that person that
[36:30] you embarrass about whether it's your
[36:31] wife
[36:33] husband children family doesn't really
[36:35] matter
[36:36] remember dear sinners gesture and it's
[36:37] not
[36:39] dear sir
[36:40] so you can't feel guilty
[36:43] for their behavior at you what you have
[36:45] to find yourself having an anchor point
[36:48] is what can you do now
[36:51] you
[36:52] would find that
[36:54] many times i'll talk about
[36:56] there's no school of parent there is no
[36:58] school of marriage
[37:00] there's no school that
[37:02] that
[37:03] trains us to be a great husband not good
[37:05] great husband a great wife
[37:08] you know there's no school that does
[37:09] that
[37:10] the wife who could cook could cook
[37:13] cook but she has a husband
[37:15] the husband who lazy lazy and here but
[37:17] he has a wife
[37:19] and we go through stuff and learn stuff
[37:21] sometimes
[37:22] hard way
[37:24] but eventually
[37:25] you know it comes true
[37:27] and that is why um
[37:30] you know for this question a man leave
[37:31] his father mother and cleveland to his
[37:32] wife and this is why from whom how as
[37:36] parents we supposed to be
[37:38] we're supposed to have these children
[37:40] come and raise to a level of maturity
[37:42] that they could stand on their own
[37:44] this is what life is about
[37:46] reproducing
[37:48] reproducing off his kind coming to
[37:50] maturity and so on so this is
[37:52] the title of what i have tonight
[37:56] is
[37:58] true brotherly kindness manifested
[38:01] a sign of life
[38:03] and maturity
[38:04] what god wants us to get is the material
[38:08] mature
[38:10] but brown said something that blow my
[38:11] mind
[38:12] you talk about when you newly get
[38:14] married love your wife and everything
[38:16] and afterwards if something happens like
[38:19] you want to turn and finish and whatnot
[38:21] but as the years rolled by
[38:23] and as
[38:24] the two parties blend into one another
[38:27] he says they can kind of do without each
[38:30] other
[38:32] it's like you press osterize
[38:35] press the machine
[38:36] and it can't separate it anymore it's
[38:38] just a blending that is steel
[38:40] and i think time and life
[38:43] time
[38:44] produces that level of maturity
[38:47] now
[38:48] i am saying that
[38:50] because he went on to say when he
[38:52] started in the ministry
[38:54] anybody do something off he's like cut
[38:57] them off he finished and whatnot
[38:59] but as time ruled on so he took that
[39:02] parallel and bring it into his own
[39:04] growth
[39:05] as a minister
[39:07] in ministry
[39:08] as time grew on he recognized
[39:12] he needs the brethren
[39:15] and that is where we have to start
[39:18] who is the person next to you in front
[39:21] of you behind you who's the person you
[39:24] shake your mind
[39:26] abraham
[39:28] had every reason to pull rank unlocked
[39:31] he could have embarrassed lot
[39:33] he could have
[39:35] put pressure on a lot to say well you
[39:37] know you are loafing on my blessing or
[39:39] you
[39:41] your blessing is because of me and this
[39:43] court called me god spoke to me and me
[39:45] and i in the iron story but he didn't do
[39:47] that
[39:48] he was very very gracious extremely
[39:51] gracious
[39:52] he could have even told lot
[39:55] look go ahead and go so and point in
[39:57] where he's supposed to go and if he led
[39:59] blood should go that way no he didn't
[40:01] even do that
[40:02] he was the one that was elected
[40:05] abraham was the one that was called
[40:08] amen was the one that heard god's voice
[40:12] and yet he's the same one that said look
[40:14] listen if you go less i go right you go
[40:15] right there go listen you choose
[40:18] wherever you want to go and
[40:20] my goodness when you see now you see it
[40:24] is what
[40:25] is on the inside
[40:27] that choice
[40:30] that look picked
[40:32] it was based upon
[40:34] the encoder if i could use that word or
[40:36] whatever things inside of him that he
[40:38] could look around with his eyes and say
[40:40] you know what
[40:41] they were watered
[40:42] so it appeared
[40:45] that abraham
[40:47] was dealt a hard hand
[40:49] because he was facing more like
[40:51] wilderness
[40:52] and and please that doesn't have the
[40:54] water and something like that and yet
[40:57] when they were separated god for labor
[40:59] but east west north and south all his
[41:01] euros
[41:02] so now we fight for things
[41:05] and
[41:06] is
[41:07] is really
[41:08] axis of what are you fighting for
[41:11] what are you fighting to prove
[41:13] what are you heightened to accomplish
[41:15] because if you just
[41:17] take a time and pause a little bit and
[41:20] do what god tell you to do
[41:22] you would hear god say if not and salt
[41:24] is always yours
[41:26] your blessing or your inheritance
[41:29] is already reserved for you
[41:32] having jealousy and envy and malice
[41:35] and evil intent and i'll do this and
[41:39] would do that it doesn't make any sense
[41:41] when your
[41:42] your thing is reserved
[41:44] brotherly kindness is a big thing
[41:48] in god's plan and program
[41:50] it's a key
[41:52] it's on the preaching
[41:54] it's not as human it's not something
[41:57] that is highlighted much
[42:00] because you cannot fake it
[42:06] you can't
[42:08] fake forgiveness
[42:09] so
[42:10] so you say somebody doing something
[42:12] right and you say you forgive them by
[42:14] talking to tom dick and harry
[42:16] and you tell them
[42:17] you know
[42:19] i forgive her for
[42:21] for doing this
[42:23] that is not how it's supposed to be
[42:26] your forgiveness should come
[42:28] freely
[42:29] freely from in your heart from your mind
[42:31] from in your spirit hope i'm not
[42:33] rambling
[42:34] but brother branham said this now and
[42:36] this is a message perfect fate
[42:38] now fate
[42:40] is based on forgiveness
[42:42] let's stop right there
[42:45] what will take us to the rapture
[42:47] rapture in faith
[42:49] and faith is based on forgiveness
[42:52] so how could we have faith for divine
[42:54] healing
[42:56] if
[42:58] we have oughts
[43:00] grudges
[43:02] and that is why god will judge those
[43:04] pastors and ministers
[43:06] that are sowing evil seeds
[43:08] against other ministers
[43:10] and this to their congregation
[43:12] they will pay for that
[43:14] i can guarantee you that not for me i'm
[43:17] not paying my not i'm not the judge
[43:19] because it's god's people
[43:22] and um what we're supposed to show
[43:25] is for the kingdom of god
[43:27] so that is why i don't buy any pastors
[43:30] fight
[43:31] ministers fight apostle prophet preacher
[43:33] evangelist fight nobody's right
[43:35] if you are probably somebody else and we
[43:37] are friends i am not going to promote
[43:39] that person because your problem with
[43:41] them that is you and them
[43:42] that have none of me
[43:44] i am not a nobody fight that is politics
[43:48] and i refuse to be a politician
[43:51] i am not into politics
[43:53] because this wonder why you go here you
[43:55] have a friend with this one don't talk
[43:56] to this one the doctor no no no school
[43:59] tell your story walking
[44:01] everybody must have their liberty
[44:04] everybody will have the liberty to love
[44:05] to forgive
[44:07] to have fellowship
[44:09] this is what god wants
[44:10] this is what wants on us you see
[44:13] so faith is based on forgiveness
[44:17] now
[44:19] this
[44:21] so okay
[44:22] so
[44:23] the majority of times the emphasis is
[44:25] faith
[44:27] um your faith comes by hearing the
[44:28] hearing the word of god
[44:30] so you're pumping word fake number
[44:32] hearing i mean mysteries come along on
[44:34] the word and we gotta bomb some
[44:36] mysteries and you get faith
[44:37] but you're born in glory of the
[44:39] mysteries i never ordered against your
[44:41] brother and sister
[44:42] glory
[44:43] and halloween mysteries and wife faced
[44:46] that way on the bed and he has mentioned
[44:48] that anybody glory hello to the
[44:49] mysteries and white's not talking to
[44:51] husband with your service in the car
[44:53] glory hallelujah see
[44:55] and yet fate is based upon forgiveness
[44:58] no
[44:59] just hope are not just rambling
[45:02] but
[45:02] i always have a problem
[45:05] with brothers
[45:07] who
[45:08] don't treat their wives nicely and might
[45:11] talk to their wife however and we'll
[45:13] talk to other sisters other people nice
[45:16] and what i believe that that is that is
[45:18] that is nuts to me
[45:20] i believe charity begins at home
[45:23] i believe that that love have to start
[45:26] at the whole level love god love your
[45:29] wife love your family you know and i
[45:32] always say not as your father your
[45:33] mother but as christ loved the church
[45:36] i am not jesus christ
[45:37] i can't love you like jesus christ jesus
[45:39] might love the church i will tell you my
[45:41] righteousness are not churches
[45:43] sorry
[45:44] who want to make sure you're right that
[45:46] is the business
[45:47] i am not into that i don't preach that i
[45:49] don't teach i believe clearly but i'll
[45:51] make a pointed reference you know the
[45:53] wife husband choice like the rights of
[45:54] the past and so on men take that and
[45:56] take that overboard and make a big old
[45:58] seed and watching with that they'll be
[46:00] people stunned
[46:02] it's like they want to get rid of the
[46:04] husband they have and they can't move
[46:06] can they marry to him
[46:07] but i don't see me bible
[46:10] god didn't teach that i am not into that
[46:12] i have one wife her name is anne marie
[46:15] that i'm still in love with
[46:17] so
[46:19] christ
[46:21] god wants you to love him
[46:24] this is what it's about
[46:26] love for god
[46:29] so when you begin to exercise just being
[46:32] affectionate being kind you have to
[46:34] start somewhere
[46:36] because some
[46:38] some of us have some temper spasms not
[46:40] right here someone's then you know
[46:43] baron says sweeten your temper with
[46:44] prayer it's not like you can't have them
[46:47] bible say let your son go now you let
[46:49] his son go in a rut not that you won't
[46:50] get angry and something that you're
[46:52] really i mean
[46:54] it just took pay off
[46:56] but is how do you manage
[46:58] the internal conflict
[47:00] and the external conflict
[47:02] and if you have the internal right
[47:05] you could handle the external so much
[47:07] better
[47:08] so really and truly it is coming along
[47:10] to our own self so fate is based upon
[47:13] forgiveness
[47:15] and then you know what he said as we
[47:17] said this morning trying to get the
[47:19] church into the place
[47:21] to where we could really see apostle
[47:23] times moving among us
[47:25] that is what we all hunger
[47:27] it's just laying right at the door we
[47:29] see it
[47:30] but we want to see more of it we want it
[47:34] to flow
[47:35] and it will be a hell to us to flow out
[47:38] to others
[47:40] so could you imagine
[47:41] but a brahmana speech in perfect field
[47:44] he slips in there a key
[47:46] this key is forgiveness
[47:49] very simple
[47:51] and he says no
[47:52] we want to have apostate times we want
[47:55] it
[47:56] that it could flow to others
[47:58] what the flu to others this quality of
[48:01] faith
[48:02] that is based on forgiveness so faith
[48:05] really
[48:06] is a key
[48:08] this brotherly kindness
[48:10] is what will
[48:12] mashup satan's kingdom of jealousy and
[48:15] hate
[48:16] the commitment
[48:18] to love the brethren
[48:21] um
[48:23] i try to second there's going to be a
[48:25] united defeat because i have to believe
[48:27] what god said
[48:28] there is no unity
[48:30] of churches
[48:32] there is no unity of ministries
[48:35] there will be a unity of defeat
[48:38] there will be a ministry of affection
[48:40] which is the fifo ministry minister of
[48:42] jesus christ
[48:43] that will be in unity
[48:45] because the broadband said they'll be
[48:48] backing one of them up
[48:50] not
[48:51] cutting one another down
[48:53] it means
[48:54] that these brethren will not be insecure
[48:57] because part of cutting others tongue
[49:00] it shows up your insecurity
[49:03] because sometimes people believe
[49:05] by breaking down somebody they are
[49:08] putting themselves up
[49:10] if
[49:11] you have the assurance of the lord in
[49:14] your heart
[49:15] there's no need to break anybody's down
[49:18] because in the world today
[49:20] there will be always people greater than
[49:22] yourself
[49:23] and lesser than yourself
[49:25] just like the bible talk about great
[49:26] servants and small citizens
[49:28] the major prophets and minor prophets
[49:31] in life
[49:33] there'll be always people don't forget
[49:34] that now
[49:36] greater better
[49:38] stronger wiser
[49:40] have more money whatever it is than you
[49:43] and they're all people have less than
[49:46] you have shoes some people have none
[49:48] some people have tons of shoes
[49:50] you see what i'm saying now so when you
[49:53] accept
[49:54] your state in life not that you have to
[49:56] stay where you are then you let others
[49:59] live
[50:00] without being jealous
[50:02] without being envious
[50:04] without being hateful
[50:06] and you have to know
[50:08] that
[50:10] nobody could take what god has ordained
[50:12] for you
[50:13] and you can't really take somebody's
[50:15] blessing i've seen over the years
[50:17] people try to out this one light and you
[50:19] know even my own personal experience
[50:21] which i wouldn't talk about
[50:23] and i see it as all failed because they
[50:26] missed
[50:28] god's plan
[50:29] they miss
[50:31] that what god has blessed
[50:34] no mango kids
[50:35] they missed the thing
[50:37] what god has blessed
[50:39] no man could curse
[50:41] you see
[50:42] so
[50:44] when there are those who thought i was
[50:45] finished
[50:47] do you finish
[50:48] i was just laughing
[50:50] so you're done
[50:52] i have a revelation of my sonship early
[50:54] um
[50:55] i used to get really battles as a
[50:57] christian
[50:58] if i'm cold i want to read investigates
[51:01] but boy i had a fight i believed that
[51:04] did everything want to tell me i'm a
[51:05] discipline all kind of torture
[51:08] bang my mind
[51:10] and one day i got a revelation of my
[51:12] country and the devil never brought that
[51:14] back to my mind again at all
[51:17] so i was liberated
[51:19] from any negativity about my calling and
[51:22] god and everything else and that freed
[51:24] me so therefore
[51:26] whatever has sealed me over the years
[51:29] has been
[51:31] put in this way i have used as wind
[51:34] so i could fly
[51:36] [Laughter]
[51:38] i used it as wings that i could soar
[51:41] when people thought i would sit down i
[51:42] stood up
[51:43] and people thought i was keep silent i
[51:45] spoke
[51:46] when people thought i would disappear i
[51:49] made myself very present
[51:51] and um
[51:52] as
[51:54] completely opposite
[51:55] to the grain of my whole
[51:58] and sometimes that's what fate does
[52:01] fate does make you do things and operate
[52:03] in a way that is not even
[52:06] natural to you
[52:07] and that is how you know it's the lord
[52:10] and i challenge you tonight
[52:12] to step up
[52:13] step up step up from a church membership
[52:16] step up from
[52:17] you know uh just hearing you want to be
[52:19] able to apply
[52:21] you want to be able to
[52:22] that it could flow through you so this
[52:25] key
[52:26] the verb i'm dropping in perfect fit
[52:28] here is powerful
[52:30] because this is the thing they're going
[52:32] to
[52:33] you know break up the the walls and the
[52:36] partitions that the enemy has put there
[52:39] there's a scripture you have to find it
[52:40] i just want to in hebrews 12
[52:42] and it says here looking to follow peace
[52:45] with all men and holiness
[52:47] without wish no man shall see the lord
[52:50] looking diligently
[52:52] least any man feel of the grace of god
[52:56] please here we go any root of bitterness
[53:00] springing up
[53:01] trouble you
[53:02] and thereby many be defiled
[53:06] least
[53:07] there be any fornicator or profane
[53:09] person as etho
[53:10] who for one muscle of meat sold his boot
[53:13] right for you know that afterwards when
[53:15] he would have inherited the blessing he
[53:18] was rejected for he found no place of
[53:20] repentance though he sought it
[53:22] carefully with tears
[53:24] let's take a peek of that in the
[53:26] amplified strive to live in peace with
[53:29] everybody
[53:30] pursue that consecration and holiness
[53:33] without which no one will ever see the
[53:35] lord
[53:36] exercise foresight here we go
[53:39] and be on the watch to look after one
[53:43] another
[53:44] oh my my pause here you know how god
[53:47] loves
[53:49] when we have a genuine interest in one
[53:52] another
[53:53] to look out for one another
[53:56] you might not know what the system might
[53:58] be going through my brother
[54:00] you pick up your phone and say how you
[54:01] doing
[54:02] i began to talk and you don't know how
[54:04] that just
[54:06] slide right in but they help that person
[54:09] and you don't know it's god love god's
[54:12] grace upon your life
[54:13] to encourage somebody
[54:15] and try to
[54:17] lift them up
[54:18] these are age where people tend
[54:20] okay
[54:21] so in this age the default is to
[54:25] criticize
[54:26] that is the default position
[54:29] so you see somebody of challenges and
[54:31] instead of
[54:32] trying to reach out to help
[54:34] you talk about that person with somebody
[54:38] and then
[54:39] you have a supporter there and that's
[54:40] how click does that
[54:42] you know you see what you're doing you
[54:44] see how you're moving you see this you
[54:46] see this
[54:47] and i am challenging tonight to get rid
[54:50] of all those things see each other as
[54:53] two brethren
[54:54] even people not in our group
[54:56] on our church
[54:58] are not in our ministry they are
[55:00] brethren
[55:01] regardless of what they think and they
[55:02] feel that's how you should see them
[55:05] there are people that are striving for
[55:07] the kingdom
[55:08] striving to make it in
[55:10] striving to get it right nobody's trying
[55:12] to go to hell him
[55:13] everybody's striving
[55:15] to make it
[55:16] you know and
[55:18] like us thinking that as we get older
[55:20] the challenge is sickness the challenges
[55:23] is the creaks and the cracks and the
[55:25] different pains and
[55:27] and tiredness and weariness
[55:29] the young man he personally figured you
[55:31] know he young fellow
[55:33] i was like that you know
[55:34] you tried 21 forever is that changing
[55:38] the data change
[55:40] until it didn't change so much are they
[55:42] black and grey
[55:44] so the point about it is this
[55:46] we have to have a care one for love
[55:49] we don't have to wait to refuse all to
[55:52] do that but we could start now
[55:54] we could start when we pray
[55:56] sometimes you know there's a lot of
[55:58] prayers why you don't want a person to
[56:00] prove these are the proof of people you
[56:01] can run out of premiums you could tarry
[56:03] there and really pray
[56:05] and ask god to help this sister hey
[56:07] brother look at this one here you know
[56:09] different struggles and so on like that
[56:10] different health issues different
[56:12] challenges that we may not even give
[56:13] away the medium come forward and see it
[56:15] but we could really begin to pray them
[56:18] through or praise the lord
[56:20] so yeah let's exercise foresight and be
[56:22] on the watch to look after one another
[56:25] to see that no one falls back from
[56:28] and fails to secure god's grace is a
[56:31] merited fever
[56:33] and spiritual blessing
[56:35] in order
[56:36] in order
[56:38] that no root of resentment
[56:40] ranker
[56:42] bitterness or hatred hatred shoots forth
[56:46] and causes trouble and bitter torment
[56:49] and many become contaminated
[56:52] and defiled by it
[56:54] i have seen believers get defiled
[56:57] and contaminated
[56:59] i have seen people who
[57:02] want used to love
[57:04] want use the care
[57:06] turn bitter
[57:07] and angry they go to other churches of
[57:09] course and they are seen down they
[57:11] wherever they are
[57:13] but in reality they intercept
[57:16] because they haven't cleared up the
[57:17] business
[57:18] in their spirit and their souls in their
[57:20] heart they can't react in love
[57:23] they don't even want to shake your hand
[57:25] they will cross the street
[57:27] they want a doctor
[57:29] and they are seeing somebody in some
[57:30] other group some other church
[57:33] that is not the christian work
[57:35] that this prophet brought us
[57:38] he brought us into true discipleship
[57:40] to follow after jesus
[57:42] to follow his word
[57:43] okay so let's continue here now
[57:46] that no one become guilty of sexual
[57:48] advice and become a proofing godless and
[57:51] fake religious business he's did who
[57:53] sold his birthright for a single meal
[57:56] for you understand that later on when he
[57:59] wanted to regain title to his
[58:01] inheritance of the blessing he was
[58:03] rejected
[58:04] disqualified and set aside for he could
[58:07] find no opportunity to repair by
[58:09] repentance what he had done no chance to
[58:12] recall the choice he had made although
[58:15] he sorted carefully
[58:17] with bitter tears
[58:19] just a few
[58:21] the bad answer this year
[58:23] now there's so much in the day we live
[58:24] in patented gifts
[58:26] so many people judge people by this what
[58:29] they have
[58:30] i believe that these are gifts
[58:32] i believe that what we see take place is
[58:34] gifts they are god-given gifts but
[58:37] that's a butt coming you know
[58:40] if we do not use them in the right way
[58:43] that god intended them to be used
[58:47] then we can do more harm with the gifts
[58:49] than we could if we didn't have the
[58:50] gifts
[58:51] and that applied to gifts in in the
[58:54] church
[58:55] and ministerial gifts
[58:57] let me say it again good
[58:59] if it is not used in the correct way
[59:03] harm
[59:05] than good is done
[59:08] false doctrine
[59:10] and false teaching
[59:12] kills
[59:13] let me say that again
[59:15] it's not a matter of just force doctrine
[59:17] is a spirit
[59:18] behind false doctrine
[59:20] it's a spirit of error
[59:23] and and behind the right teaching is the
[59:25] spirit of truth
[59:27] and the spirit of truth will produce the
[59:30] fruit of that spirit long suffering
[59:33] meekness
[59:34] gentleness humility it will it will
[59:36] produce it because it's the spirit of
[59:39] truth
[59:40] and just as a spirit of truth there's a
[59:42] spirit of error okay so let's continue
[59:45] now brother brown
[59:47] if we do not use them in the right way
[59:49] that god intended them to be used then
[59:52] we do more harm with the gifts than we
[59:54] would if we do not have the gifts the
[59:56] other night i made a statement on the
[59:57] pulpit saying this
[59:59] i would rather see broadly love
[1:00:02] existing among the church
[1:00:05] if
[1:00:06] we didn't have
[1:00:08] one case of healing
[1:00:10] or anything else
[1:00:12] see
[1:00:13] we must know
[1:00:15] what these things are for
[1:00:17] why would the prophet say that
[1:00:21] he had a gift of healing
[1:00:23] he know the burden of people with cancer
[1:00:25] and what kind of conditions at that time
[1:00:28] and yet he could see he rather see
[1:00:31] broadly love
[1:00:32] why would he do that
[1:00:35] why didn't he say a water
[1:00:38] we have a lot of divine gifts our
[1:00:40] healing gifts
[1:00:42] no
[1:00:43] that is what they had at that time or
[1:00:45] roberts the whole pentecostal field was
[1:00:47] laden with gifts tommy hicks and all
[1:00:49] kind of
[1:00:50] people out there praying for these sick
[1:00:52] and different kind of things like that
[1:00:53] but
[1:00:54] he talked about this thing called
[1:00:56] brotherly kindness
[1:00:59] but about
[1:01:01] come with it love
[1:01:03] the world is dying today for love
[1:01:05] christians today we have got fines
[1:01:08] called literatures wonderful buildings
[1:01:10] but we got weak pulpits yes from the
[1:01:12] wrong
[1:01:13] the congregation
[1:01:15] don't
[1:01:16] feel to one another like they used to
[1:01:19] there is something missing
[1:01:21] the word is look into that christians
[1:01:23] what we need today is a baptism of love
[1:01:25] for one another
[1:01:28] this will all men know you're my
[1:01:30] disciples
[1:01:31] when you have love one for another
[1:01:34] so we can see clearly
[1:01:36] the mysteries
[1:01:38] the tear plane
[1:01:41] all this word word word
[1:01:43] hasn't done it
[1:01:46] it will take something more than that
[1:01:49] so the tape playing
[1:01:51] of the word you preaching the mysteries
[1:01:53] all these mighty gifts
[1:01:54] if it doesn't lead us
[1:01:57] into this love divine or divine love or
[1:02:00] this experience that we could express
[1:02:03] god love
[1:02:04] as god loves us we can express that to
[1:02:07] others
[1:02:09] it's not going to happen it's not going
[1:02:10] to make it because
[1:02:12] told him his wife that died and went on
[1:02:14] before it take perfect love to enter
[1:02:15] here
[1:02:17] so some way along the line
[1:02:19] we have to connect back to this
[1:02:21] to this main vein
[1:02:25] so then when you get into corinthians do
[1:02:28] i speak with a tongue feminine angels do
[1:02:30] i have give my body to be burned do i
[1:02:32] have all knowledge one no all mysteries
[1:02:34] two including new name
[1:02:36] seven thunders
[1:02:37] fires woes all mysteries and have this
[1:02:40] thing called l-o-v-e
[1:02:42] which will express itself to the
[1:02:44] brethren i am
[1:02:46] not nothing
[1:02:50] nothing
[1:02:52] okay
[1:02:53] let's continue
[1:02:55] so he said now what we need today is a
[1:02:57] baptism of love for one another
[1:03:00] this will all men know that you're my
[1:03:02] disciples when you have love
[1:03:05] for the other
[1:03:07] now no matter okay escape
[1:03:10] that is where the church is at that's
[1:03:11] what the matter they have lost
[1:03:13] their broadly love
[1:03:15] they have lost
[1:03:17] the feeling for one another
[1:03:20] they are so much mockery people say i'm
[1:03:23] a christian i believe in the value but
[1:03:25] act different
[1:03:27] he said but brother i rather give you a
[1:03:29] little correction now
[1:03:30] than when i come to the judgment you say
[1:03:32] brother branham i'm so glad you've done
[1:03:34] it it's too late then what we need is
[1:03:36] love and respect for god
[1:03:38] and for his people listen
[1:03:40] no matter what they belong to
[1:03:44] this is the part
[1:03:46] i am not talking about love for god and
[1:03:48] love for the people in person
[1:03:51] i am not talking that
[1:03:54] jesus busted his own disciples you know
[1:03:56] he accepted righteousness exceed that
[1:03:58] describing pharisees he said god they
[1:04:00] love one another
[1:04:02] he told them he has a lot better than
[1:04:03] that you love more than that
[1:04:06] you know so try to say you know like
[1:04:08] people say that they're the best church
[1:04:10] we are the best minister we have the
[1:04:11] best pastor and the lady bishop in
[1:04:13] tongue and you have all the mysteries
[1:04:15] and you have all your word you have all
[1:04:17] these singers you have all required you
[1:04:18] have all the music you have everything
[1:04:20] we are it
[1:04:22] that is when you're not it how when you
[1:04:23] know the gods they're off
[1:04:25] anytime you're somebody say they're it
[1:04:27] and this is it here you run now you can
[1:04:28] do it
[1:04:29] don't don't stop no that's right keep
[1:04:31] running
[1:04:34] because you have to have determined to
[1:04:36] know
[1:04:37] that
[1:04:38] can't and won't be it
[1:04:40] the bible gives a template
[1:04:43] of what
[1:04:44] it looks like in this kingdom jesus said
[1:04:47] peter come paul this one come james come
[1:04:49] what not tax collect everybody come
[1:04:52] they didn't choose each other because if
[1:04:54] we were given to choose the other who
[1:04:56] would we choose family and our friends
[1:04:58] people like us people that who we
[1:05:00] harmonize with we say come graduate
[1:05:05] but what jesus did he call them from
[1:05:07] different walks of life and call them
[1:05:09] together
[1:05:10] and say you are my disciples
[1:05:12] and you have not chosen me i have chosen
[1:05:15] you so when they look at each other
[1:05:19] [Music]
[1:05:22] is who jesus chose yes
[1:05:24] he even chose judas
[1:05:27] [Laughter]
[1:05:31] did you know he choose to do that
[1:05:33] joshua selected him
[1:05:35] he chose him
[1:05:37] no it was us i know jesus wanted to
[1:05:40] to to even let him come to him come to
[1:05:43] that door
[1:05:44] but not jesus
[1:05:46] but you just have to do what jesus do
[1:05:48] but jesus do what jesus do we can't stop
[1:05:51] the crooks trunks cooks and not for
[1:05:54] coming to church
[1:05:55] understand this let me say testament
[1:05:57] good
[1:05:58] teal ovid canister cooks cranks crazies
[1:06:02] crazy house or you want to call them
[1:06:04] from coming to the church
[1:06:06] i could stall them a little bit
[1:06:09] like one time again a pulpit sister
[1:06:11] walking to the church right after
[1:06:13] service i walk in the in the room and me
[1:06:15] was there me like a relationship just
[1:06:17] walking into it
[1:06:19] i'd smell them i could sense them
[1:06:23] i still look look one walking
[1:06:24] interesting i never talked to her
[1:06:26] because i'm a sinner i could tell her
[1:06:28] well two to form after what she stomp
[1:06:30] out or kind of a real character
[1:06:33] let us pick it up over the years so much
[1:06:35] power to us we we know we're sensitive
[1:06:38] to them
[1:06:39] that way they don't touch them you know
[1:06:40] that's it i don't drag it nobody i don't
[1:06:42] press the lights i don't pull it because
[1:06:44] i know rashford no
[1:06:52] this has been my
[1:06:54] my thing
[1:06:56] so that's why braham says you cannot say
[1:06:58] this this is a holy church he said the
[1:07:00] holy ghost can be preached in it but in
[1:07:02] there you'll find good bad indifferent
[1:07:05] he said the holy ghost is ported on
[1:07:07] individual childhood individuals in your
[1:07:10] house say individuals so you could
[1:07:12] tabernacle the holy ghost not the church
[1:07:15] as a group
[1:07:16] and the vigilance is that in uh sister
[1:07:19] shepard's dream and that's famous means
[1:07:21] the messenger poured his water and the
[1:07:23] water was the worst and no church could
[1:07:26] have hold the word the water leaked out
[1:07:30] but then the messenger went and get a
[1:07:32] big bucket of what
[1:07:33] honey
[1:07:34] and honey was what brotherly kindness
[1:07:37] and he poured that he said it will hold
[1:07:39] this
[1:07:40] so the church can hold broadly love
[1:07:45] it's not something that we cannot get
[1:07:47] it's not something that we cannot get
[1:07:49] connected with we can
[1:07:51] it needs to be revisited this thing
[1:07:53] called bloody love
[1:07:55] okay so what
[1:07:58] he says now
[1:08:00] what we need is love
[1:08:01] and respect for god and for his people
[1:08:05] no matter what they belong to
[1:08:07] the denomination
[1:08:09] oh i know i keep interrupting because
[1:08:11] trying to finish the school by clarence
[1:08:12] and keep erupting because i couldn't
[1:08:14] share my own experience
[1:08:16] and
[1:08:18] i tell you i had a good portion of watch
[1:08:21] in my heart and
[1:08:22] a solid a solid big portion
[1:08:27] and here's why
[1:08:28] because i felt that the ministers and
[1:08:29] trainers didn't give me a fair chance
[1:08:31] they condemned me because i'm actually
[1:08:33] in new york all i must watch with people
[1:08:35] all overseas but they would they would
[1:08:37] do like if we from hell you know and i
[1:08:39] find it was really nonsensical and
[1:08:42] nobody would invite or fellowship with
[1:08:45] anything like that
[1:08:46] and i had that
[1:08:49] and
[1:08:50] well you know my testimony 1981
[1:08:52] uh i saw a vision and a sheep drop down
[1:08:56] in a prayer meeting in cairo and i saw
[1:08:58] the second coming of the law
[1:09:01] and i went to find out where that
[1:09:02] message was at and whether mr program
[1:09:04] preached and when i went through that
[1:09:05] message so i went to that message by
[1:09:07] vision
[1:09:08] i'm gonna begin to preach from it
[1:09:10] and i begin to say when the church finds
[1:09:12] his brother love and whatnot and you
[1:09:13] know when i will testimony burly khan is
[1:09:16] broke
[1:09:16] and the strangest thing about it when it
[1:09:19] broke i said god forgive me of my sins
[1:09:22] why can't i forgive you of yours
[1:09:25] and that just freed me and all the
[1:09:27] different things that was in my system
[1:09:29] just disappeared and then the spirit
[1:09:31] poured out
[1:09:32] and since that time i knew by revelation
[1:09:36] we have access to that holy spirit sword
[1:09:40] so that is why the anointed atmosphere
[1:09:42] that's why i believe it's in the church
[1:09:44] you see because we have partaken of this
[1:09:46] revelation but we want a manifestation
[1:09:50] of this thing called broadly love you
[1:09:52] see and that to me will be a great sign
[1:09:55] of spiritual maturity that god could
[1:09:57] trust you
[1:09:59] to love the brethren
[1:10:00] trust you to handle others right for
[1:10:04] example when the two people came making
[1:10:06] love in the church but ram was preaching
[1:10:09] and he begged them he said stop it and
[1:10:10] they carrying on the kissing one and i
[1:10:11] said god that's not right and whatnot
[1:10:13] and then the holy spirit dropped down
[1:10:15] and said whatever you say will happen to
[1:10:17] them they say blind they'll go blind you
[1:10:19] say that they will die you know all the
[1:10:21] options there he choose none of that he
[1:10:23] said i forgive you
[1:10:25] and when he said i forgive you the holy
[1:10:27] spirit portal which was pleased because
[1:10:30] he said he'd done things that was wrong
[1:10:32] he said this is where
[1:10:34] you get conscious of your
[1:10:36] how to say it
[1:10:37] of your mortality
[1:10:39] of
[1:10:41] god's redeeming love for you
[1:10:43] of course lucy towards your life
[1:10:46] and as god extended to you
[1:10:49] you feel comfortable and very free to
[1:10:52] extend it to others
[1:10:54] you know in a pure reason in a genuine
[1:10:57] sensory that you could extend this thing
[1:10:59] to others this this this what god has
[1:11:02] accepted to you
[1:11:04] oh my lord
[1:11:06] not
[1:11:07] all right so no matter what they belong
[1:11:09] to denomination we will say the groups
[1:11:11] were churches fellowships as long as
[1:11:13] they are brothers they are brothers we
[1:11:15] need a love for one another
[1:11:17] and love will contact when nothing else
[1:11:20] will do
[1:11:21] now
[1:11:23] all right so let's get down now sorry
[1:11:26] all right here this one is a big one
[1:11:29] you remember in the blasphemous name he
[1:11:30] said honey looked like a one stick but
[1:11:32] it did stick it with stick
[1:11:34] all right
[1:11:37] now if pentecost was god's vine
[1:11:39] which was the new vine that was grown up
[1:11:42] when these four destroyers had sent it
[1:11:45] to vinyl let's find out what pentacles
[1:11:48] had and find out what we are got lacking
[1:11:51] the first thing
[1:11:53] that pentecost produced
[1:11:56] was bradley love
[1:11:57] now he's talking about
[1:11:59] pentecost
[1:12:01] the first thing that pentecost produced
[1:12:04] was bloody love it tore down
[1:12:07] the middle wall of partitions
[1:12:10] and made a brotherhood
[1:12:12] to such a way
[1:12:13] that they had everything in common in
[1:12:16] bible days a brotherhood
[1:12:18] they sold their stuff
[1:12:20] everybody had food shelter clothing the
[1:12:23] bible said they had everything in common
[1:12:26] that is what it produces what produces
[1:12:28] that pentecost what is that dynamics
[1:12:31] what is that the holy ghost
[1:12:33] what is that the power of god
[1:12:35] what is that lovee
[1:12:38] this is what it will produce
[1:12:40] but ivan says the first sign of the holy
[1:12:42] ghost is humanity
[1:12:44] the first thing
[1:12:48] he said you could talk i could talk to
[1:12:49] somebody in five minutes and know if
[1:12:51] they have to worry
[1:12:52] how much mysteries a man could talk in
[1:12:54] five minutes
[1:12:56] it's not your words
[1:12:58] it's not what in your head
[1:13:00] is what spirit is in your heart
[1:13:04] at the end of it all
[1:13:06] we have to be magnetized to the
[1:13:07] headstone to go in the rapture i keep
[1:13:09] saying
[1:13:10] it's not really you
[1:13:12] in that sense when the rapture is the
[1:13:14] spirit inside of you and your body
[1:13:16] wrapped around that that taking you with
[1:13:18] it too
[1:13:20] when the big magnet come
[1:13:22] and you're
[1:13:23] you are magnetized you have to go
[1:13:26] so that's why i keep saying the rapture
[1:13:27] is not outside in his insider you're
[1:13:29] looking for the rapture i would say
[1:13:30] you rapture had been saudi enoch
[1:13:32] mechanics became dynamics and god took
[1:13:34] him
[1:13:35] so if we can't get this right we don't
[1:13:37] have an opportunity to go you know
[1:13:39] friends we have known to be tribulation
[1:13:40] things i am not joining earlier i don't
[1:13:43] want to be any part of the tribulation
[1:13:44] states you know people
[1:13:47] trouble you know when then men have
[1:13:49] problems in their life and marriage
[1:13:50] something let's go and drink and they
[1:13:52] like to drink one another and clung
[1:13:53] their glasses and so on
[1:13:55] i don't want to be with tribulation
[1:13:56] scenes crying glasses but we miss it
[1:14:01] why because you hate somebody because
[1:14:03] you can't drop your arch and whatnot in
[1:14:05] your busy the hoop is so bad and they
[1:14:07] hurt you and you're hurting you all the
[1:14:09] expression they hurt you
[1:14:11] and you know
[1:14:13] you people just talk about other people
[1:14:14] so much and they can't see themselves
[1:14:19] it's like to blindly oneself
[1:14:21] blind to you and weakness
[1:14:25] could you laugh at yourself is that
[1:14:28] people who can't laugh at themselves you
[1:14:29] know they're so stiff
[1:14:31] they can't laugh at this and say
[1:14:33] when you could laugh at yourself man
[1:14:35] that is so good that is so healthy you
[1:14:37] make a relative
[1:14:38] a goof
[1:14:40] maker you could laugh at yourself you
[1:14:43] could be true to yourself you could be
[1:14:45] true to others
[1:14:47] see
[1:14:48] so to me
[1:14:49] this is what it's all about okay let me
[1:14:50] just wrap up here this boom
[1:14:53] so the first thing they produced on
[1:14:55] pentecost was bubbles right
[1:14:58] paul spoke of this brotherhood and he
[1:15:00] gave all the gifts of pentecostal church
[1:15:02] and then said in 1st corinthians 13 do i
[1:15:05] speak with tongues of men and angels and
[1:15:07] have not this love
[1:15:09] which brings the brotherhood this is by
[1:15:12] the brand now this is 20th century
[1:15:14] prophet
[1:15:16] viewering and putting a a
[1:15:19] a microscope on this thing do i speak
[1:15:21] with tons of men and angels i have not
[1:15:23] this love
[1:15:24] which
[1:15:25] brings the brotherhood i am nothing
[1:15:28] and do i have knowledge
[1:15:31] to understand
[1:15:32] all the mysteries of god
[1:15:35] i am still nothing
[1:15:37] without love
[1:15:39] the love of the brethren
[1:15:41] so show me a mighty man
[1:15:44] whether in trinidad
[1:15:45] the west indies usa europe africa or
[1:15:49] south america show me one mighty man
[1:15:52] with his mighty revelation with the love
[1:15:54] of the brethren i'm not about his own
[1:15:56] behavior
[1:15:57] love of the brethren have a burden
[1:16:00] that the people
[1:16:02] that the believers that lives emanate
[1:16:05] others brother branagh this word reading
[1:16:07] again this one i don't think i've ever
[1:16:09] read this quote before
[1:16:10] though i speak with tongues of men and
[1:16:12] angels and have not this love which
[1:16:15] brings
[1:16:16] the brotherhood i am nothing
[1:16:18] and do i have knowledge to understand
[1:16:21] all the mysteries of god i am still
[1:16:23] nothing without love the love of the
[1:16:26] brethren
[1:16:27] and jesus said
[1:16:29] this shall all men know that you are my
[1:16:31] disciples when you have love one for the
[1:16:33] other pentecost had that
[1:16:36] i am speaking pentecost meaning the
[1:16:38] first group of the apostles so he's not
[1:16:41] talking about 1906 okay
[1:16:44] and they had that bloody love here we go
[1:16:47] they wasn't greedy
[1:16:49] they sold
[1:16:51] everything they had
[1:16:53] for the furthering of the church
[1:16:55] they were so together until even when
[1:16:58] one heard the other one died they said
[1:17:00] let us go and die with him such a
[1:17:02] feeling
[1:17:04] now jesus spoke of this paul says let
[1:17:07] very love continue and you're only
[1:17:08] preparing this tonight i was talking
[1:17:10] about thinking about the scriptures let
[1:17:11] brothers continue i say but you can't
[1:17:12] continue if it's not even there
[1:17:15] you could only let one love continue if
[1:17:17] it hadn't
[1:17:18] if there was no very love it didn't
[1:17:20] continue no way how did it start
[1:17:22] so before we hit that scripture so
[1:17:24] are you reading the scripture let by
[1:17:26] love continue no we're just like well
[1:17:28] get my love going and when by love going
[1:17:31] then you could actually talk about
[1:17:32] continuing afterwards right
[1:17:34] now
[1:17:36] in the pentecostage of the day
[1:17:38] comparing the two
[1:17:40] if you notice the routine of the gifts
[1:17:42] the first of the gift is wisdom
[1:17:44] thank you
[1:17:46] the first is the gift of wisdom
[1:17:49] that is the best gift of the group
[1:17:52] and if you don't have wisdom you won't
[1:17:55] know
[1:17:56] how
[1:17:57] to use knowledge
[1:17:59] that is the second gift
[1:18:01] and if we can't use the second gift
[1:18:03] without wisdom how are we going to use
[1:18:05] the last gift interpretation or the next
[1:18:08] the last speaking in tongues
[1:18:10] our zealous eat up our wisdom our zeal
[1:18:12] for our denomination our enthusiasm has
[1:18:15] eaten up the wisdom of
[1:18:17] of divine
[1:18:18] bloodly love
[1:18:20] but
[1:18:21] this is what my mystical i will restore
[1:18:23] okay that's where
[1:18:26] he said let's take an example
[1:18:28] if a man don't believe the same as i do
[1:18:31] i'll go right into this coronation
[1:18:33] and preach with him
[1:18:34] just preach what he believes go right
[1:18:37] ahead and let it go because i love it
[1:18:39] right there fruits you know that if they
[1:18:41] don't believe it
[1:18:42] they haven't got brotherly love they
[1:18:44] drop out disagree fall away i have
[1:18:45] nothing to do with it
[1:18:47] why don't you come to me
[1:18:49] and talk to me about it
[1:18:51] you don't know what i believe see what
[1:18:53] difference does it make anyhow what i
[1:18:55] believe it is who i believe jesus christ
[1:18:58] i have never left a meeting yet with bad
[1:19:01] teeth as i know wolf but you see
[1:19:03] broadly love has all wheels
[1:19:06] has
[1:19:12] listen just a moment
[1:19:14] i would rather have a church
[1:19:17] that knows nothing about any spiritual
[1:19:19] gift
[1:19:21] and just be so in love with each other
[1:19:23] and with christ
[1:19:25] i'd rather have that than every
[1:19:27] spiritual gift operated in the church
[1:19:29] now that my son had in a pentecostal
[1:19:31] group
[1:19:33] but i would rather have it where there
[1:19:36] is gifts
[1:19:37] they would feel
[1:19:39] when there's gifts
[1:19:41] they'll bring confusion
[1:19:42] whatever is gift
[1:19:44] they can be questioned
[1:19:46] but there is where there is love it's
[1:19:48] perfect
[1:19:49] that's right
[1:19:50] if
[1:19:51] you have perfect love
[1:19:54] you'll have perfect gifts
[1:19:56] that's right
[1:19:57] so work first with love
[1:20:01] that
[1:20:02] brings
[1:20:03] fellowship
[1:20:05] and fellowship
[1:20:06] brings gifts
[1:20:10] work with love
[1:20:12] that brings fellowship
[1:20:14] fellowship
[1:20:16] brings gifts
[1:20:18] if we say we have no sin
[1:20:22] we deceive ourselves
[1:20:24] and the truth is not in us but if we
[1:20:27] would confess
[1:20:28] our sins
[1:20:30] he is faithful and just
[1:20:32] to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
[1:20:35] from all unrighteousness
[1:20:38] and if we see it all the words see it
[1:20:41] then
[1:20:42] through the blood of jesus
[1:20:44] we are fellowship one with another
[1:20:46] so the blood
[1:20:48] is connected to fellowship
[1:20:51] and the blood is connected to love
[1:20:54] so evidence of blood applied
[1:20:58] is expressed by the fellowship that we
[1:21:01] have with the brethren
[1:21:03] if there is no fellowship
[1:21:06] well you know i think the kangaroo
[1:21:08] moaning worm
[1:21:10] that was anointed and commissioned to
[1:21:12] already eat down the fruits of the tree
[1:21:14] and the first treat that womb beside the
[1:21:16] head because brotherly love you know eat
[1:21:18] it
[1:21:19] because after you hit bloody love as the
[1:21:22] fruit
[1:21:23] you hit the leaves of fellowship
[1:21:26] and barramundi the fellowship is he
[1:21:27] clapping his hands it turns out
[1:21:29] atmosphere you want to get good shade so
[1:21:31] then when that fruit eat away no residue
[1:21:34] and sit down stiff
[1:21:35] no clap
[1:21:37] no praise
[1:21:38] no worship you saw the devil wicked you
[1:21:41] see all the fighting worship and
[1:21:42] fighting is the devil and was lucifer
[1:21:45] himself you know hiding behind what
[1:21:47] mysteries
[1:21:49] hidden and more hidden than hidden and
[1:21:51] work on the mysteries and they find to
[1:21:53] you over always beaten ministries yeah
[1:21:56] i've beaten the intellectual part of
[1:21:58] this message i have to beat it because
[1:22:01] this has been binding people from the
[1:22:03] reality of the experience of christ
[1:22:05] so here we have the word with perfect
[1:22:07] vindication and whatnot so nice very
[1:22:09] intellectual i went brown forget the gun
[1:22:12] by defense and passenger killer bull he
[1:22:14] says something came over him wasn't that
[1:22:16] thought was not mystery wasn't some
[1:22:18] knowledge is something he said i wish it
[1:22:20] happened all the time it was an
[1:22:22] experience go give the lord a shout of
[1:22:24] feeling good now i'm free to jump onto
[1:22:26] this chair right now
[1:22:27] hallelujah praise god now i see we have
[1:22:30] to come to a spot where we could speak
[1:22:33] language
[1:22:34] the language that the bull understood
[1:22:36] wasn't violence plagues mystery seven
[1:22:38] thunder seven seals it wasn't nothing
[1:22:40] about the pope about rome dr fausti or
[1:22:42] imaginations it was nothing about that
[1:22:44] the language people understood was the
[1:22:47] language of love
[1:22:48] and this have to come back but ram
[1:22:51] didn't
[1:22:52] fake it he had it that's why he could
[1:22:54] speak to the bull and said go and lie
[1:22:56] down let's see if we could wrap up this
[1:22:58] thing
[1:22:59] oh blessed be love and tonight i hope
[1:23:00] this is a refined to you so here we go
[1:23:02] again first work with love
[1:23:04] love
[1:23:05] brings fellowship
[1:23:07] and fellowship
[1:23:08] brings gift
[1:23:10] oh my yes i'm gonna conclusive
[1:23:16] oh
[1:23:17] yes lord
[1:23:19] he's talking about a pregnant woman he
[1:23:20] said did you notice around the mother
[1:23:23] seems
[1:23:24] a sweet feeling what is it
[1:23:26] it's a spiritual body spiritual life
[1:23:30] waiting to come into that little body as
[1:23:31] soon as this is born now it's only
[1:23:34] begotten
[1:23:35] or when it is born it is born
[1:23:38] now on wednesday night service
[1:23:41] in the preaching and that was the
[1:23:42] perfection of the saints if you haven't
[1:23:44] heard it go back and listen to that
[1:23:46] listen to it once twice three times
[1:23:48] it's an important message
[1:23:50] it's
[1:23:51] solid stuff inside of there
[1:23:53] baron was talking about sanctification
[1:23:55] the baby's begotten
[1:23:56] and he's comparing that to word on top
[1:23:58] of word on top of a word in you
[1:24:01] when the baby comes through which is
[1:24:03] water
[1:24:04] then blood life
[1:24:06] another spirit life grabs that baby and
[1:24:09] that's gonna be born
[1:24:10] okay
[1:24:12] so the muscles quivering and jumping on
[1:24:14] the inside
[1:24:15] under sanctification is not the birth
[1:24:19] even though there are experiences
[1:24:21] on the inside
[1:24:23] but that is still
[1:24:25] begotten
[1:24:26] when it comes true
[1:24:28] it is born okay so now tonight we want
[1:24:32] to go a little further a little deeper
[1:24:34] he's talking about the atmosphere
[1:24:36] around the mother
[1:24:38] before delivery
[1:24:40] what kind of atmosphere is around the
[1:24:42] mother before that delivery so here we
[1:24:44] go hear what he's saying here now he
[1:24:47] says now
[1:24:48] you notice
[1:24:49] you can take a woman
[1:24:51] if she is so full
[1:24:53] or evil or wicked or whatever but when
[1:24:56] she's become mother a little while
[1:24:59] before the baby is born
[1:25:02] there's a kindness
[1:25:04] about the woman
[1:25:05] get around her there's always something
[1:25:07] more tender why
[1:25:09] there's an angel spirit
[1:25:11] waiting to receive
[1:25:13] the natural body
[1:25:14] and as soon as it is born
[1:25:16] the bread of life comes into it and god
[1:25:20] breathes it in there
[1:25:22] and it becomes a living soul now just as
[1:25:24] this baby is being born there's a
[1:25:26] spiritual ability to receive so he's
[1:25:27] going down something like that
[1:25:29] oh my praise peter jesus we're almost
[1:25:32] through here
[1:25:34] my lord
[1:25:35] so why did you say
[1:25:37] that brotherly kindness is a sign of
[1:25:39] life
[1:25:41] because
[1:25:42] the woman about to produce this baby
[1:25:45] means
[1:25:46] that she comes a full term
[1:25:49] a full
[1:25:50] nine months
[1:25:52] she is the baby is ready
[1:25:54] it's mature and evidence of that
[1:25:58] that the mother is about to give birth
[1:26:01] is this sweet spirit that comes around
[1:26:05] and i want to identify
[1:26:07] this sweet spirit
[1:26:09] as the spirit
[1:26:11] of brotherly kindness
[1:26:13] before the birth of the manifestation of
[1:26:16] charity
[1:26:17] the love of god
[1:26:19] so
[1:26:20] if you see
[1:26:22] and you see that kind of lion and i've
[1:26:24] seen a kind of kanga and a wolf you know
[1:26:26] the baby are far off the baby was being
[1:26:28] born yet
[1:26:29] and you start running it it didn't know
[1:26:31] eight months six months it wasn't
[1:26:32] started
[1:26:33] but i'm saying
[1:26:34] that once the woman is heavy with child
[1:26:38] at some point in time
[1:26:40] that gives a signal of life
[1:26:43] a sign of life
[1:26:45] a sign of maturity that a bird is
[1:26:47] beginning to have
[1:26:48] why are you saying all this tonight but
[1:26:50] over because i would know
[1:26:53] not just you walking into church
[1:26:56] and and seeing amen
[1:26:58] but how your life is being changed
[1:27:00] and that spirit atmosphere of sweetness
[1:27:03] coming around you
[1:27:04] is a sure sign to us
[1:27:06] that a recreate
[1:27:08] seven thunder holy ghost pride revival
[1:27:10] is about to break
[1:27:11] because that sweetness of drastic
[1:27:13] kindness is around you just how fusion
[1:27:15] are we gonna close here for the brother
[1:27:18] i think i'm going to wrap up with this
[1:27:19] here
[1:27:20] all right
[1:27:21] he's talking about 60 there's some
[1:27:23] stratography man the bible says
[1:27:26] add in broadly kindness now that's a
[1:27:28] good one here
[1:27:29] all right
[1:27:30] when we get to that burly kindness
[1:27:33] put yourself
[1:27:35] in his place
[1:27:37] on the matter
[1:27:39] what to do
[1:27:41] before you criticize
[1:27:43] before you complete
[1:27:44] before you find fault with your brother
[1:27:47] put yourself
[1:27:49] in this place
[1:27:50] put yourself in that sister's place if
[1:27:53] it was me i wasn't going to do this it
[1:27:55] was me you know i hope but as i was
[1:27:57] saying and i know that's so true when
[1:27:59] somebody started talking to school and
[1:28:00] whatnot and somebody come and say you
[1:28:02] taking that
[1:28:03] my wife was next door to me when this he
[1:28:06] was preaching and i said were you taking
[1:28:07] that that was so
[1:28:09] you know this was the thing to hype you
[1:28:11] up you taking that
[1:28:13] put yourself
[1:28:15] on
[1:28:16] in your brother's place on the better
[1:28:18] and you could feel for your brother and
[1:28:20] you see i'll tell you something
[1:28:22] it's very hard
[1:28:24] to be angry and
[1:28:27] say evil to what somebody that you pray
[1:28:29] for
[1:28:30] is very hard
[1:28:32] it's very hard to be bitter
[1:28:34] to what somebody that you really
[1:28:37] sincerely pray for
[1:28:39] and love and in concern
[1:28:40] you can't do that and that is where we
[1:28:43] have to
[1:28:44] grow a little more
[1:28:46] this seemed a lot
[1:28:47] okay
[1:28:48] that pictures tend to watch sort of end
[1:28:50] up inside we know the story i'm not
[1:28:51] going to go down here but the point i
[1:28:53] want to bring is this
[1:28:54] when god reveal the mysteries and unveil
[1:28:57] the seals to abraham
[1:28:59] and show him destruction is next to
[1:29:01] sodom
[1:29:02] abraham then say yeah
[1:29:05] god my nephew don david
[1:29:10] think no that was a lot of attitude
[1:29:13] you see lot wasn't religious
[1:29:15] religious spirits don't care about the
[1:29:16] family
[1:29:17] they care about their conviction and
[1:29:19] what is seeing and what the catching and
[1:29:21] the revelation their care but they found
[1:29:23] i'm going to go to hell they just pray
[1:29:24] they don't care the spirit
[1:29:26] abraham stood there and said lord
[1:29:28] there's 50 righteous what is he doing
[1:29:30] he's interceding because lot is down
[1:29:32] there
[1:29:34] that's the spirit of christ
[1:29:35] that's the love that he had
[1:29:37] lot abraham had dynamic dynamics he had
[1:29:40] an experience he had a supernatural
[1:29:42] encounter he had that and you could see
[1:29:44] it reflected
[1:29:45] moses
[1:29:46] god determined god moses so god so angry
[1:29:50] go tell moses move aside i will kill
[1:29:52] them what they say before i kill them
[1:29:53] kill me
[1:29:55] but i'm saying the spirit of christ
[1:29:56] standing in the camp there
[1:29:58] people were miserable enough it was
[1:30:00] troubling
[1:30:02] it wasn't easy
[1:30:03] and yet
[1:30:04] he stood for them
[1:30:06] i'm going to close
[1:30:08] broadly like probably kindness he says
[1:30:11] no my brother sinned against me said
[1:30:13] peter shall i forgive him he said seven
[1:30:15] times a day he says empty time said
[1:30:17] burnley kindness if a brother is allowed
[1:30:19] to tune don't don't be impatient with
[1:30:22] him see be kind to him
[1:30:24] go anyhow somebody said not long ago how
[1:30:27] can you believe these things the way you
[1:30:28] do and still go to the assemblies of god
[1:30:31] the oneness all the rest
[1:30:33] then see
[1:30:35] he's talking his own experience now see
[1:30:37] well the kindness open someday
[1:30:40] patient with him
[1:30:42] temporal
[1:30:43] enjoined with him
[1:30:44] knowledge to understand what he believes
[1:30:48] meekness with him having faith that
[1:30:50] someday god will bring him in
[1:30:53] broadly kindness
[1:30:55] the seventh thing
[1:30:57] and
[1:30:58] closing are close to me conclusion
[1:31:00] prayer
[1:31:01] from the second coming of the lord this
[1:31:02] is the message that i got inspiration
[1:31:04] from 1981
[1:31:05] talk about the woman lost a coin
[1:31:08] there was nobody ringing those times
[1:31:09] with a banner on her head every coin
[1:31:10] represent different things one of those
[1:31:12] points was barely love she lost it she
[1:31:14] said she had a husband time she scrubbed
[1:31:17] the floors she swept the walls she took
[1:31:19] it on the cobwebs she kept on so she
[1:31:22] found that she had lost and when she did
[1:31:24] she called her little sister churches to
[1:31:26] come now
[1:31:27] and that's the way the prophecy came in

[1:31:42] when the church finds his brotherly love
[1:31:45] when the church finds his holy decency
[1:31:47] when the church finds its place in
[1:31:50] christ it will call to the other members
[1:31:52] of the body come and rejoice with us
