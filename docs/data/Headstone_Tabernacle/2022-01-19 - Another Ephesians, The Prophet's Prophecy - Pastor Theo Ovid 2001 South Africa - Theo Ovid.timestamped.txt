[41:56] he said my word
[41:58] shall not return unto me boy
[42:00] but i shall accomplish the purpose
[42:08] of god amen understanding let's go in
[42:10] the bible for luke 8
[42:14] ephesians 4
[42:16] and isaiah 55
[42:18] first scripture reading tonight
[42:26] reading from luke chapter 8
[42:30] verse 4
[42:32] and when much people were gathered
[42:33] together and would come to him out of
[42:35] the every city he spake a parable
[42:38] a sword went out to
[42:40] the sea
[42:41] and as he saw it some fell by the
[42:43] wayside it was
[42:44] trodden down and the falls of the air
[42:46] devoured it and some fell among up on a
[42:48] rock
[42:49] as soon as it was sprung up it ridded
[42:51] away because it lacked moisture some
[42:53] fell among thorns and thorns sprang up
[42:55] with it and choked it and some fell on
[42:57] good ground and sprang up and be a fruit
[42:59] hundred fold when he had said this he
[43:02] cried he'd have ears to hear
[43:05] let him hear
[43:08] and the disciples asked him saying what
[43:10] might this problem be and he said unto
[43:13] you it has given them to know the
[43:14] mysteries of the kingdom of god but to
[43:16] others
[43:17] in power but seeing they might not see
[43:19] in here and they might not understand
[43:21] now the parable is this their seed is
[43:23] the word of god those that by the
[43:25] wayside are they that here then commit
[43:27] the devil and take it away the word out
[43:29] of their hearts at least they should
[43:30] believe and be saved
[43:32] they on the rock are they which when
[43:34] they hear receive the word with joy and
[43:37] these have no root which for a while
[43:39] believe and in time of temptation fall
[43:41] away
[43:42] and that which fell among tones a day
[43:44] which one day i've heard go forth on a
[43:46] choke with cares and riches and
[43:48] pleasures of this life and bring no
[43:51] fruit to perfection
[43:52] but that on good ground are they which
[43:55] in an honest and good heart having heard
[43:58] the word keep it and bring forth fruit
[44:01] with patience
[44:03] ephesians 4 verse 11 says and he gives
[44:05] some apostles and some prophets and some
[44:08] evangelists and some pastors and
[44:10] teachers for the perfecting of the
[44:12] saints for the work of the ministry for
[44:14] the edifying of the body of christ still
[44:17] we all come in the unity of the faith
[44:19] under the knowledge of the son of god
[44:20] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[44:23] the stature of the fullness of christ
[44:25] that we henceforth be no more children
[44:28] tossed to and through and carried about
[44:30] with every wind of doctrine by the slay
[44:32] of men and calling craftiness whereby
[44:35] the lion wait to receive but speaketh
[44:37] the truth speaking of truth and love may
[44:39] grow up into him in all things which is
[44:41] ahead even christ
[44:43] in whom from whom the whole body fitly
[44:46] joined together and compacted by that
[44:48] which every joint supply it according to
[44:50] the effectual working in the measure of
[44:52] every part make an increase of the body
[44:54] onto the edifying of itself in love and
[44:56] from isaiah chapter 55 or final
[44:59] scripture we want to read from verse 6.
[45:01] it says here seek the lord while he may
[45:03] be found call upon him while he is near
[45:06] let the wicked forsake his way in the
[45:07] righteous man his thoughts and let him
[45:09] return unto the lord he will have mercy
[45:12] upon him unto our god for he will
[45:14] abundantly pardon for my thoughts and
[45:16] not your thoughts neither are your ways
[45:17] my ways here the lord for the heavens
[45:20] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[45:22] higher than your wheels and my thoughts
[45:24] than your thoughts for as the rain
[45:26] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[45:27] return it not thinner but water with the
[45:29] earth and make it bring forth and blood
[45:32] that it may give sea to the saw and
[45:33] bread to the eater so shall my word be
[45:36] that go forth out of my mouth it shall
[45:37] not return to me void but it shall
[45:40] accomplish that which i please and it
[45:42] shall prosper in the thing where i sent
[45:44] to let us pray father we have read your
[45:46] word and any man could read the

[50:44] glory my feel good tonight
[50:47] praise god i am blessed i am blessed
[50:50] i'm already blessed
[50:52] praise god praise god
[50:55] one time the disciples walking with
[50:58] jesus for a couple of years
[51:00] jesus turned to them and said who do men
[51:02] say i am
[51:04] son of man who men say i want to hear
[51:06] what they're saying about me i want to
[51:08] hear what they're talking about tell me
[51:10] who did they say i am
[51:13] and they were happy to give the report
[51:15] they said some say you were this some
[51:16] say you were that i heard somebody said
[51:18] you were this somebody said you were
[51:20] that good
[51:21] that's very good you may be caesar
[51:24] no i want you who have been following me
[51:27] to tell me who i am
[51:41] you may be seated
[51:43] and guess what
[51:46] they didn't know
[51:49] they were following
[51:51] without even understanding
[51:55] or knowing
[51:57] what they were following
[51:59] in other words jesus caught them
[52:06] then all of a sudden
[52:08] a brother said don't have the christ
[52:13] jesus
[52:14] look at him he said flesh and blood
[52:17] you just be here like in some church you
[52:19] didn't hear that from somebody nobody
[52:21] can tell you that but the spirit
[52:24] the lord himself
[52:29] my father
[52:35] glory
[52:36] glory to god
[52:38] [Music]
[52:42] you may be seated
[52:43] to jesus
[52:45] watch
[52:47] jesus didn't address the whole group
[52:50] the whole 12. he talked he said what
[52:52] peter
[52:53] i'm talking to you man because you got a
[52:56] revelation
[52:57] i will talk to you because you've got a
[52:59] revelation and upon this rock i'll build
[53:01] my church and the case of hell shall
[53:04] never prevail against
[53:15] you may be seated
[53:20] and the whip revealed you know it means
[53:21] wrestling overcome
[53:23] it means the kill of hell gates of hell
[53:25] will wrestle with it
[53:26] but they will not overcome it
[53:31] so once
[53:33] and brother branham said the holy ghost
[53:35] alone
[53:38] is the revealer
[53:40] of the divine revelation of jesus christ
[53:47] the holy ghost alone
[53:49] is the revealer
[53:51] so you can be sitting there and you get
[53:53] a revelation and the person next to you
[53:54] don't even know what's happening with
[53:56] you
[53:57] they don't know why you're shouting they
[53:59] don't know why your hands up in there
[54:00] they don't know why you're jumping
[54:03] but revelation
[54:16] no true revelation doesn't come here
[54:18] just your mind
[54:24] true revelation comes to your heart
[54:27] you can't explain it
[54:29] i'm going to have a son that's abraham i
[54:32] can't explain it i can't show it i'm
[54:35] kind of old
[54:36] but i know god spoke to me and i know
[54:39] i'm going to have a son
[54:42] that's revelation
[54:52] you maybe see that
[54:54] so jesus didn't say my church will be
[54:56] built upon some man gift
[54:59] my gift my gift jesus never promised to
[55:03] build a church upon somebody's guilt
[55:08] jesus promised to build his church upon
[55:10] revelations
[55:20] you may be seated
[55:21] let me tell you this about revelation
[55:24] revelation will make you stand
[55:26] anywhere
[55:28] anytime
[55:29] anyplace under any condition
[55:32] revelation will make you stand if all of
[55:34] south africa don't believe this
[55:37] revolution will make you stand
[55:39] this is the correct inspiration
[55:42] of malachi sports message
[56:00] glory hallelujah
[56:03] glory to god
[56:05] amen
[56:06] you may be seated
[56:07] where is god
[56:10] mine
[56:12] there's such a charge inside of here
[56:15] maybe we don't have to read any notes
[56:17] maybe we don't have he master court
[56:20] because peter on the day of pentecost
[56:22] said this is the stone
[56:24] to build his reviews
[56:26] who told peter to say that
[56:40] you maybe see this
[56:51] [Music]
[56:56] championship time this is battle time
[57:03] you're on the winning side
[57:07] oh praise god
[57:09] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[57:14] so whatever god says is a seed
[57:17] his word is a seed
[57:19] so when gross darkness cover the earth
[57:21] god didn't argue and say why it's so
[57:23] dark
[57:24] gordon debate how long was it dark god
[57:27] didn't discuss with the darkness god
[57:29] just said let there be light
[57:35] come on preach back to me
[57:38] god didn't argue god didn't question
[57:40] because they let there be light
[57:48] that was the seed
[57:50] and here come the spirit
[57:52] and there was light
[57:55] the manifestation of the sea
[57:57] amen
[57:59] praise god
[58:01] you may be seated
[58:03] amen
[58:06] amen
[58:08] amen amen
[58:11] amen
[58:24] you may be seated
[58:31] no there must be a certain environment
[58:34] for perfection
[58:39] now we are beyond pentecost now
[58:41] we're not talking about bubble dancing
[58:43] and shouting and sweating and carrying
[58:45] on that we don't know who we are
[58:47] we had enough of that
[58:52] we're not talking about that
[58:54] screaming and having a good time and
[58:55] then who are you who are you i don't
[58:57] know
[58:58] where you going i don't know
[59:00] where you come from you still don't know
[59:03] but jesus said at that day you shall
[59:05] know
[59:07] i am in the father he and me and i knew
[59:10] jesus said so
[59:11] and that's the word
[59:13] and that can't be done void
[59:15] it shall accomplish
[59:27] you may be seated
[59:30] hallelujah
[59:34] so there must be a certain environment
[59:37] for perfection and jesus
[59:39] give this parable
[59:41] about the sword the seed and the ground
[59:44] now we know the soul son of man
[59:46] we know the seed generally speaking the
[59:48] word
[59:50] but
[59:50] what type of ground
[59:52] are we forced with all these ears
[59:55] since the prophet left
[1:00:02] since the prophet left
[1:00:04] what type of crown
[1:00:05] had we have to deal with since the
[1:00:08] prophet
[1:00:10] amen
[1:00:11] oh hallelujah
[1:00:13] so jesus said number one some fell on
[1:00:14] the wayside
[1:00:16] on the wayside is drunks that are
[1:00:18] unprepared
[1:00:19] i cannot receive seed
[1:00:22] it is off the beaten track
[1:00:25] it's people that come and hear and don't
[1:00:26] understand and go
[1:00:31] that's me sir
[1:00:34] so gordon can take all these years to
[1:00:36] get rid of the wayside
[1:00:42] that's why i say you are special
[1:00:45] i'm gonna tell you who you are
[1:00:47] you maybe see this
[1:00:56] number two
[1:00:58] the stone in the rocky hearts
[1:01:00] they are partially prepared grounds
[1:01:03] they shout a while
[1:01:05] dance a while
[1:01:07] stay in church a while
[1:01:08] but when trials come
[1:01:11] when they stand for the revelation come
[1:01:13] they are gone you can't see them no more
[1:01:19] are they trouble in the church they gone
[1:01:22] have a problem happened they gone
[1:01:27] you might be seated but they have rocks
[1:01:30] jealousy
[1:01:31] envy
[1:01:33] all of this inside of that their heart
[1:01:35] so if they dry up they don't laugh
[1:01:40] you may be seated
[1:01:50] come on jesus dropped the charges
[1:01:54] at calvary
[1:01:56] your case is dismissed
[1:01:59] you are free tonight
[1:02:01] you may be seated
[1:02:05] number three
[1:02:07] tony hat
[1:02:10] they are also partially prepared brown
[1:02:13] but the torns were not taken out
[1:02:16] just as the stone didn't take all the
[1:02:18] rocks
[1:02:19] the thorns were allowed to grow
[1:02:22] and the seed could not grow normally
[1:02:26] because of the strong cravings
[1:02:28] strong desires
[1:02:30] of the heart
[1:02:32] and the cures of life
[1:02:34] and the riches
[1:02:36] and the pleasures
[1:02:37] and you want to have a host like that
[1:02:38] brother and you want to have a car like
[1:02:41] that brother and you want this and you
[1:02:43] want that and you want the other and you
[1:02:46] don't want the holy ghost like that
[1:03:02] you may be seated
[1:03:04] just remember my friends
[1:03:07] you are leaving back your bank account
[1:03:09] you are leaving back your house you are
[1:03:11] leaving back your car you're leaving
[1:03:12] back your job
[1:03:14] where you going i'm going home brother
[1:03:17] there's a rapture
[1:03:18] there's a call to the wedding supper
[1:03:21] you can't carry those things with you
[1:03:24] covering up this world plain riches
[1:03:27] that soon rapidly
[1:03:29] seek to gain the heavenly treasures
[1:03:32] they will never pass away
[1:03:34] you may be seated
[1:03:35] oh praise god
[1:03:37] hallelujah
[1:03:39] now notice
[1:03:41] the closest in bringing fruit was the
[1:03:44] tawny
[1:03:46] because they grew
[1:03:47] but the thorns chopped them
[1:03:50] and jesus placed it correctly he said
[1:03:53] they bring no fruit to perfection
[1:04:01] they will bring fruit
[1:04:02] but not to perfect
[1:04:10] them oh my you may be seated
[1:04:14] oh praise god amen
[1:04:16] hallelujah
[1:04:18] blessed be the name of the lord we just
[1:04:20] lean our foundation here tonight
[1:04:22] oh praise god amen
[1:04:25] so we want to just look at this same
[1:04:27] parable
[1:04:29] you don't have to open the bibles in
[1:04:30] matthew 13.
[1:04:31] and i want to read verse 18. he said
[1:04:34] hear ye therefore the parable of the
[1:04:36] sword this is another way jesus saying
[1:04:37] that now
[1:04:39] when one hearing the word of the kingdom
[1:04:42] and understanding it not
[1:04:44] he's going down a little depth now
[1:04:47] watch
[1:04:48] and then they understand it not then
[1:04:50] commit the wicked one and catch it away
[1:04:53] that which was sown in his heart this is
[1:04:56] heath which received seed by the west
[1:04:58] side
[1:04:59] so the wayside didn't understand it
[1:05:02] this tony didn't understand it
[1:05:04] the tonys didn't understand it but
[1:05:06] listen to what jesus said in 23
[1:05:09] he said but he that receiveth seed into
[1:05:11] the good ground
[1:05:12] is he that carried the wood and
[1:05:14] understands it
[1:05:18] watch which also breathe with fruit and
[1:05:21] bring it forth some a hundred fold some
[1:05:23] sixty some city
[1:05:32] so you know who you are tonight
[1:05:34] you are good grown
[1:05:37] shake somebody hand and tell them i am
[1:05:38] good girl
[1:06:05] [Applause]
[1:06:19] you may be seated
[1:06:21] oh praise god so let's hit the message
[1:06:22] tonight
[1:06:23] amen
[1:06:24] now
[1:06:26] the sword is the son of man
[1:06:28] and the fever is the earth and the seed
[1:06:29] is the word of god the seed is the word
[1:06:31] of god
[1:06:32] now this is some show as the father he
[1:06:34] said now
[1:06:35] the seed in the right ground
[1:06:38] will produce its kind
[1:06:40] corn will produce corn powder will
[1:06:42] produce valley wheat will bring wheat
[1:06:44] and any divine promise of god will bring
[1:06:47] the results if it is placed on the
[1:06:49] ground and watered with prayer
[1:06:52] with faith
[1:06:54] and with trust
[1:06:55] god will bring it to pass i am saying it
[1:06:58] with experience
[1:07:00] amen
[1:07:01] now jesus had all these fine qualities
[1:07:03] of god in him do you believe it he had
[1:07:05] powers upon power so when he met satan
[1:07:07] he never used his power he gave an
[1:07:09] example for the weakest christian
[1:07:12] when he met satan he said it is written
[1:07:14] man shall live by bread alone but by
[1:07:16] every word i proceeded out of the mouth
[1:07:17] of god
[1:07:18] the weakest christian can take a whole
[1:07:22] of god's word
[1:07:26] and every time when he meets the enemy
[1:07:29] he said it is written i believe he had
[1:07:30] the power to do it but when he meant
[1:07:32] satan on the same grounds with the same
[1:07:34] way that you meet him you said it's
[1:07:35] written you believe it
[1:07:37] you maybe say that it's written now
[1:07:39] jesus went down in matthew 11. he said
[1:07:40] now whatsoever things you desire watch
[1:07:43] it
[1:07:44] when you pray
[1:07:46] believe you receive it
[1:07:48] and you shall receive it
[1:07:51] in other words believe it got it already
[1:07:54] and you will get it
[1:08:04] so that is why after you receive a
[1:08:06] promise you thank god for it because you
[1:08:08] accepted
[1:08:10] you maybe see this
[1:08:12] oh my
[1:08:14] praise god there was somebody with some
[1:08:16] disease i can't remember what disease
[1:08:17] was it was very contagious and they
[1:08:19] called by the brain of the free and the
[1:08:20] doctors didn't want to go around to go
[1:08:21] in the hospital room and and
[1:08:25] and eventually you know they say that if
[1:08:26] he was a priest that they said but is
[1:08:28] married he shouldn't go where he's going
[1:08:30] number one just went nearby oh lord
[1:08:31] jesus heal the child and jesus amen
[1:08:34] and walked out
[1:08:36] and the woman began to rejoice and say
[1:08:37] just think honey our child is going to
[1:08:39] be healed
[1:08:40] oh praise god thank you jesus the woman
[1:08:43] began to thank god immediately
[1:08:45] and the doctor said the doctor said oh
[1:08:48] you know are you fooling them or
[1:08:49] whatever
[1:08:50] and
[1:08:52] he said he said doctor you are looking
[1:08:53] at those instruments
[1:08:54] but i am looking at the word of god
[1:08:56] [Applause]
[1:08:59] so as soon as you are prayed for you
[1:09:02] believe you are going to be delivered
[1:09:04] thank you lord when you deliver us
[1:09:08] you are going to be healed thank you for
[1:09:10] healing
[1:09:11] oh glory you may be seated amen
[1:09:14] so watch he said now listen what brahman
[1:09:16] says now believe present tense you
[1:09:19] receive it you shall have it it will be
[1:09:21] given to you later
[1:09:23] this is words now but believe it now
[1:09:26] before you get your crop you have to
[1:09:28] plant the seed
[1:09:29] water it believe it he said don't dig it
[1:09:32] up every morning to see if they keep
[1:09:34] picking it up it will never grow
[1:09:40] that is why god said my word
[1:09:43] shall not return to me boy
[1:09:50] oh hallelujah amen
[1:09:53] amen
[1:09:55] praise god amen
[1:09:56] so therefore i the lord had planted it i
[1:09:59] watered day and night please some should
[1:10:00] pluck it out of my hand there you are
[1:10:02] god is in his word
[1:10:04] amen and anything god speaks he means
[1:10:06] that god sees it there's so many things
[1:10:08] but it must come to pass amen so he said
[1:10:11] tower in the city of jerusalem until you
[1:10:13] endured paul from one high i'm going to
[1:10:15] send you the promise of the father yes
[1:10:16] that was god's word christ was the word
[1:10:18] he said tarry in the city of jerusalem
[1:10:21] until you and you would pour from on
[1:10:22] high so that was the word that word is
[1:10:25] what drove them to jerusalem to wait
[1:10:27] there and when that word was manifested
[1:10:29] praise god that was the fulfillment of
[1:10:31] the word when the power came in the ring
[1:10:34] praise god so we have promised a rain to
[1:10:37] come on the seeds
[1:10:38] that have been planted
[1:10:40] but the prophet said all kinds of seed
[1:10:42] was sown
[1:10:47] but god
[1:10:48] have been looking for the right seeds
[1:10:52] to send the dynamics
[1:10:54] to the mechanics
[1:10:55] to send the lacquer in
[1:10:58] and i want to let you know tonight you
[1:11:00] are the right seat
[1:11:10] oh man
[1:11:12] you made me say that
[1:11:14] oh hallelujah like i tell them back

[1:11:29] they're going to fly out of them under
[1:11:30] the force anointed they're going to fly
[1:11:32] out because they're recognized as an
[1:11:34] individual affair
[1:11:36] between you and god
[1:11:37] and i wouldn't let no man stop me from
[1:11:39] going in the rapture
[1:11:44] if the whole jews leave i'm still going

[1:12:17] contrary church an interpretation church

[1:19:02] what god is doing in this weekend
[1:19:06] you may be seated
[1:19:08] one time there was a church meeting
[1:19:11] it was very ordinary
[1:19:14] the man walked into that building
[1:19:16] he found a scripture
[1:19:19] in isaiah 61.
[1:19:24] people were sitting the ordinary
[1:19:26] as usual
[1:19:28] they were hearing different teachings as
[1:19:30] usual
[1:19:31] all of a sudden this man took up the
[1:19:33] scripture
[1:19:34] and said the spirit of god is upon me
[1:19:37] for he has anointed me
[1:19:40] to bring good tidings
[1:19:42] to open the eyes of the blind and to to
[1:19:45] open the ears of the death
[1:19:47] hollow under set up liberty them that
[1:19:49] abound
[1:19:50] the proclaim to jubilee year to proclaim
[1:19:53] the acceptable year of the lord and they
[1:19:55] thought he was just reading the
[1:19:56] scripture but then he said this day
[1:20:00] in your hearing
[1:20:01] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:20:09] another man stepped forward in this last
[1:20:11] day named william marion branham
[1:20:14] and he prophesied that there was going
[1:20:16] to be another ephesians and we are
[1:20:18] coming tonight
[1:20:20] to say in your hearing
[1:20:22] in your hair and

[1:20:27] is fulfilled
[1:20:29] we are here
[1:20:33] original seed
[1:20:35] indicated well
[1:20:37] the world is already vindicated
[1:20:40] and we are preaching to you original
[1:20:42] seed
[1:20:43] seed from malachi 4.

[1:21:03] i want it will reign
[1:21:12] you may be seated why are you saying
[1:21:14] about all of it because the bible said

[1:21:20] having itchiness
[1:21:22] oh my they want to hear some favors
[1:21:25] they want to hear about angels
[1:21:27] they want to hear about the other side
[1:21:28] and this and that
[1:21:30] you maybe see this
[1:21:32] i always get a problem when a man
[1:21:33] preaching too long about the other side
[1:21:35] because he has never been there
[1:21:46] i have not seen
[1:21:48] yes have not heard
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:57] oh you may be seated i don't know how
[1:21:59] i'm going to get into this
[1:22:01] oh i'm locked inside of here tonight
[1:22:04] you will be seated oh praise god
[1:22:07] amen now listen to this but if i'm says
[1:22:11] i can prove he said
[1:22:13] that the right
[1:22:14] mental attitude
[1:22:16] towards any divine promise of god
[1:22:20] will bring it to pass
[1:22:22] he said no and he's not there with a
[1:22:24] shock notice that the two spiritual last
[1:22:27] days the true spirit
[1:22:31] is not just people now with the truth
[1:22:33] spirit the third spirit of the church
[1:22:35] people and the bright spirit of the
[1:22:36] bright people
[1:22:39] two spirits
[1:22:42] church spirit
[1:22:43] bright spirit
[1:22:45] listen he says it will be so close it
[1:22:48] will deceive the elect if it is possible
[1:22:51] now looter in the church is bringing
[1:22:53] forth the bright sea with the same
[1:22:54] spirit now let's go a little bit you may
[1:22:56] be seated now watch pentecost
[1:22:58] represented mary
[1:23:00] mary the last stage of it yet she was
[1:23:01] not the seed yet the life this
[1:23:06] the life
[1:23:07] of the seed was in her
[1:23:09] but it hadn't matured yet
[1:23:15] so as long as that seed is not mature
[1:23:17] mary carrying seed
[1:23:19] looking like seed mary resembling seed
[1:23:22] but she's not deceived
[1:23:24] but once the nine months is up
[1:23:28] jesus comes out
[1:23:34] and once you maybe see that once the
[1:23:37] time is up
[1:23:38] the seed gets mature
[1:23:41] and move from yellow to golden brown
[1:23:45] and the shark move from green to yellow
[1:23:48] you may be seated
[1:23:49] so in the message in the earlies
[1:23:52] all green
[1:23:54] chuck is green
[1:23:55] seed is green
[1:23:57] everybody green
[1:23:58] everybody's saying what they want
[1:24:00] preaching what they want but there comes
[1:24:02] a lot
[1:24:03] that we be no more children taught to us
[1:24:07] no becoming mature
[1:24:09] now we come and look like children when
[1:24:11] i was a child i speak like a child i
[1:24:13] understood as a child but when i became
[1:24:15] a man put away childish things we are
[1:24:17] talking about perfect man we are talking
[1:24:19] about a stature we are talking about an
[1:24:21] image
[1:24:35] one day they're going to come a
[1:24:36] representation of the seven months
[1:24:39] gonna represent seven churches january
[1:24:41] february march april may june
[1:24:43] july we'll have a harvest he said maybe
[1:24:45] some minister will pick it up
[1:24:47] and we will have it
[1:24:49] so right now we are right now
[1:24:51] praise god because the seed must be
[1:24:54] right
[1:24:55] in order to go down on the ground
[1:24:57] you see jesus he was seed
[1:25:00] oh let's back up a little bit
[1:25:02] adam was seed of the world
[1:25:06] he had character by creation
[1:25:09] jesus was the flesh of the world he had
[1:25:12] character by formation
[1:25:14] jesus learned obedience by the thing
[1:25:16] that he suffered
[1:25:18] he had 30 years of heart trials three
[1:25:20] years of harder trials
[1:25:26] hallelujah so when jesus came in the
[1:25:28] back god said i'm pleased with him
[1:25:31] i'm going to check him out
[1:25:33] i'm going to try
[1:25:34] hallelujah i'm going to put some
[1:25:36] pressure on him i'm pleased to dwell on
[1:25:38] him but give him some more time give him
[1:25:40] three more years and god come around to
[1:25:42] check on the son he said this is not
[1:25:43] only my standard please but hear him
[1:25:46] he is qualified
[1:25:48] he have his masters
[1:25:52] he could speak
[1:25:54] he could stand
[1:26:01] maybe see this
[1:26:03] so adam didn't have that character
[1:26:04] formation because he didn't have the
[1:26:06] grounds of trousers and testings
[1:26:09] so then the bible said in the beginning
[1:26:10] was the word the word was with god the
[1:26:11] word was god watched the word became
[1:26:14] flesh and dwelt among us he came onto
[1:26:16] his own his own received him not his own
[1:26:19] but as many
[1:26:20] or hear it to them give me power watch
[1:26:23] not to become the what he didn't get
[1:26:25] empowered to become an adult but power
[1:26:28] to become watched
[1:26:30] i should say that back again
[1:26:32] the power didn't make them an instant
[1:26:34] adult
[1:26:36] that's what i mean to say it was power
[1:26:38] to become
[1:26:43] [Music]
[1:26:46] so in other words god will give us
[1:26:49] tape a revelation virtue and
[1:26:51] manifestation knowledge praise god but
[1:26:54] we are going to die out
[1:26:56] and produce temperance patience
[1:26:59] godliness probably kindness
[1:27:07] oh hallelujah
[1:27:09] hallelujah
[1:27:11] then the seat is dead right
[1:27:13] ready for charity
[1:27:14] surprise absolute to come and seal it
[1:27:17] down and perfection
[1:27:19] paul called it the bund of perfectness
[1:27:21] seal everything in there was no leaks in
[1:27:23] the building nothing could shake you
[1:27:25] your imagination conscious affection
[1:27:27] seal them praise god nothing my evil
[1:27:29] talk will come inside of there devil has
[1:27:31] to get permission to even address you
[1:27:33] praise god when you speak demons flee
[1:27:35] praise back off because here come a son
[1:27:38] here come her daughter here come the
[1:27:40] manifestation amen by the peter of the
[1:27:42] sons of god
[1:27:47] oh hallelujah
[1:27:50] could you take some more
[1:27:52] why don't we have a whole lot inside of
[1:27:54] here
[1:28:12] words satisfication pentecost
[1:28:14] restoration of the gifts
[1:28:16] so buddha brown said no they denominated
[1:28:18] one word another would another word but
[1:28:19] they have got to
[1:28:21] we have got to get something
[1:28:24] that cannot be denominated
[1:28:26] and here what he said it is it is the
[1:28:28] entirety of the life
[1:28:31] that's in there has to produce itself
[1:28:33] again in the bride
[1:28:35] so the only thing that cannot be
[1:28:37] denominated is those seven virtues
[1:28:42] [Applause]
[1:28:45] the seven virtues is the entirety of the
[1:28:48] life
[1:28:49] now you may be seated
[1:28:51] now malachi 4
[1:28:54] had to gather all the scattered words
[1:28:58] you have to pick up all the loose ends
[1:29:00] or what they left off pick it up tie it
[1:29:02] back in the word to bring down the holy
[1:29:04] ghost
[1:29:06] now remember the holy ghost was born
[1:29:09] at the river euphrates
[1:29:11] by two hundred thousand thousand devils
[1:29:14] defend the holy ghost
[1:29:16] hallelujah but he said the anti-message
[1:29:18] is the lucid
[1:29:27] oh glory amen
[1:29:29] oh praise god amen
[1:29:31] you wanna be seated
[1:29:33] so therefore
[1:29:34] if there is a seed to come
[1:29:37] that must be the entirety of the life
[1:29:40] where must that seat come from
[1:29:42] under which seal
[1:29:44] the probably the first car to be second
[1:29:46] on the cabin third it cannot be fought
[1:29:47] cavalry is six it cut it it must only be
[1:29:50] the seventh seal
[1:29:53] we know whether branham took the seven
[1:29:54] thunders on the back and put it on the
[1:29:56] first four of the seventh seal on the
[1:29:58] inside
[1:29:59] that we wouldn't have fourteen seals
[1:30:02] because there were seven in and said no
[1:30:04] so he took the seven in the back and put
[1:30:06] it under the seventh seal on the inside
[1:30:14] and then they put silence over it and
[1:30:16] when he had opened the seventh sea there
[1:30:18] was silence in heaven for the space of
[1:30:19] half an hour
[1:30:21] when you have reason to see it god will
[1:30:22] show it god would reveal it
[1:30:29] are we ready
[1:30:31] let's go further you may be seated
[1:30:34] the messenger of malachi 4 is to do two
[1:30:36] things
[1:30:45] that's what he said right
[1:30:46] you may be seated two things reveal the
[1:30:49] mystery of the seven sundance
[1:30:52] and turn the half of the children
[1:30:54] back to the faith of the father
[1:30:58] two things
[1:31:02] but in reality it is one
[1:31:04] because he said it is these divinely
[1:31:06] revealed mystery truths
[1:31:08] is what will literally
[1:31:09] turn the house of the children
[1:31:11] back
[1:31:19] so let's come down now to the prophet's
[1:31:21] prophecy human beings
[1:31:31] let's go back again
[1:31:32] malachi forced to do two things
[1:31:34] according to jesus book reveal the
[1:31:36] mystery of the seven thunders and to
[1:31:38] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:31:40] the faith of the fathers let's say that
[1:31:42] a little different back to the faith of
[1:31:44] the ephesians fathers
[1:31:53] so to go forward
[1:31:55] you have to go back
[1:31:58] before you're going to rapture you have
[1:32:00] to go back pick up the fate that peter
[1:32:02] had paul had pick that up then go
[1:32:12] you see it
[1:32:16] you may be seated
[1:32:18] so in reality it was only one thing
[1:32:21] maybe just repeating again he said it
[1:32:23] will be these be finally revealed
[1:32:27] missed your truth
[1:32:33] you know
[1:32:38] no you know that people like to
[1:32:40] emphasize the mystic truths back
[1:32:43] i like to emphasize divine review part
[1:32:46] so in trinidad there was this brother
[1:32:48] he's talking about mr truth no they
[1:32:50] don't want to connect the virtues they
[1:32:52] don't want that they want to talk mr
[1:32:53] truth stop
[1:32:54] so he said mystery truths and he said if
[1:32:57] you're not preaching the mystery truths
[1:32:59] you're not preaching the thunders
[1:33:00] because the thunders unfold the
[1:33:01] mysteries and unfall into tongues and
[1:33:03] other things i say fine
[1:33:05] i said how many mr jews
[1:33:11] because they have flanked him
[1:33:12] institution
[1:33:13] i said how many he couldn't answer me i
[1:33:15] said friends there's only seven
[1:33:24] oh
[1:33:25] hallelujah
[1:33:27] glory never say a friend it's only seven
[1:33:30] and if you can't tell me those seven i
[1:33:32] don't want to hear the rest of mysteries
[1:33:33] that you have
[1:33:34] because the seven thunders equals seven
[1:33:37] mysteries
[1:33:39] that was thrown in the way and they
[1:33:41] fought for to bring there
[1:33:46] so all these mystery preachers forget
[1:33:47] that they are finished
[1:33:49] do i know all mysteries
[1:33:55] do i have all knowledge
[1:33:57] if i don't have the thing to catch the
[1:33:59] headstone i am nothing
[1:34:07] but i love you all might call you a
[1:34:10] blessed bunch to preach to hallelujah
[1:34:12] mom feel good preaching to you
[1:34:15] we must do this
[1:34:16] again hallelujah
[1:34:19] glory
[1:34:22] amen amen
[1:34:24] oh man you may be see that i've got to
[1:34:25] wrap up here somewhere
[1:34:27] oh my
[1:34:29] hallelujah
[1:34:30] so do you get it now
[1:34:32] brother branham came
[1:34:34] to reveal the thunder
[1:34:36] in order that our hearts could return
[1:34:39] back
[1:34:40] to the ephesian fathers
[1:34:48] oh hallelujah
[1:34:50] amen
[1:34:52] praise god so our message is to manifest
[1:34:54] christ
[1:34:56] you may be seated on the seventh under
[1:34:57] revelation
[1:34:59] is an invitation
[1:35:00] to mold your character
[1:35:03] into the world image of jesus christ
[1:35:05] you can take ii peter 1 4 through 7
[1:35:08] and slide it into ephesians 4 for the
[1:35:11] perfection of the saints for the work of
[1:35:13] the ministry for the any time of the
[1:35:15] body till we all come in the united
[1:35:16] states
[1:35:17] knowledge of the son of god here it is
[1:35:19] until a measure of this touch of a
[1:35:21] perfect man
[1:35:22] you can take second peter and slide it
[1:35:24] in there
[1:35:29] amen
[1:35:30] glory
[1:35:32] till we all come to the fullness
[1:35:34] of christ the system full of measure you
[1:35:36] man you may be seated oh praise god
