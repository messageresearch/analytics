back there Spanish amen and this evening we want to welcome brother Nigel aler Miss Tabernacle the Lord Brother also brother the girl is here God bless you welcome and brother Richard cat is here also and brother Daniel Hernandez God bless you and welcome so tonight we have a special speaker tonight brother Paul jaica from put Le have a scripture I like to read before he comes is Hebrews 1 5-7 it says For unto which of the Angels said he at any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be to him a father he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he sayeth and let all the Angels worship Him and of the angels He seeth listen who maketh his Angel spirits and his ministers a flame of fire amen but the BR we know that Paul had the Holy Spirit do you believe that but he was 14 days and nights upon the sea without any moon or Stars it was all dark and he went down into the galley to pray he came back and told the men be of good courage for the angel of God whose servant I am came to me last night and said f Paul is that right not the Holy Spirit the angel of God an angel of God sent from God and then John the Revelator the whole book of Revelation when it was wrote he said I have sent my angel Jesus did and John fell down to worship the angel but the angel said said stand up worship God you see a true angel of God won't stand to be worshiped but he said that he was of the prophets and was his fellow men that have been sent to signify these things therefore here we go Angelic beings is ordained ministers of God am to come to the Earth to Bear record of God and they work through mortal beings yes sir just as they did through Daniel back to the ages there and I believe that with all my heart amen so therefore friends as your brother that's all I am but God's gift is the spirit of God yes sir that came down in the form of an Angel so the spirit the gift yes sir is the spirit of God Amen that comes down from God yes in the form of an Angel he didn't have wings he looked like a man I heard him when he walked and he just walked on the floor walk right over just as normal as any man and talks just like any man he comes time after time through the room and different places when I'm fasting and praying amen and I believe this evening as brother Paul comes to minister to us that the angel of God could step into this place yes sir and Minister and meet your we need that close encounter we need to go beyond the church issues and church church stuff that this message is so full of and religious stuff yes to get into this God stuffen Moses was quite religious with the thoughts that he had and his intellectual conception of what he thought he was supposed to be but when that pillar fire encountered when he had that encounter he couldn't come it with small talk he knew that he knew that he know amen he heard from the iron let's all stand as we want to give God some Praises start a song for the Paul to come on with oh blessed I know you'll be blessed tonight brother Paul and Jacob amen I've known him for for quite some time there were some meetings in ton Arizona and I felt L to go to and I knew that uh I might not be so welcome but I had to go because the Lord was leading me to go and before the meeting even started I went straight to a restaurant and there was brother Paul and never I met them before walk straight into that I we begin to speak and I knew I was sent there to meet himall I was in 2012 or 2013 or 14 or something like that but he's here we're friends and we Associated over the years and I know that God will use him mightily God bless you yeah as he come let's sing that song very softly The Cloud of Glory is moving because the cloud is

Glory Glory you may take your Bibles we we are going straight in in the Bible Genesis 1 starting from verse 26 Genesis 1 verse 26 it read this wise and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the hair and over the and over all the Earth and over every thing that creth upon the Earth verse 27 so God created man in his own image in the image of God created him male and female created him them Revelation 10 verse 1 and I saw the mighty Angel come down from heaven clo with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his Earth and his face was as it were the Sun and his Fe as Pillar of Fire and he had in his hand the little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven tunders utter their voices and when the seven Thunders had uted the voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven us uttered and write them not let us bow our head for a word of pray Lord we thank thee we praise thee we glorify thy Holy Name we are aware that your presence is with usess bless all the in this and we believe that you you are our creator bless us Lord in the name of Jesus amen amen you may be seated we want to praise the name of the Lord God we appreciate

bless them bless them in a mighty way I have a little message Revelation 10 the full words must be B manifested and Vindicated and God said let us make man in our image let us make man in our image and say in Jehovah he said now the reason I've chosen to go back into Genesis because the word Genesis means the beginning religion upon the Earth today is not a cult today on the Earth there is nothing on the Earth today it is the SE chapter it is the seed chapter everything begins inesis it is in Genesis that you saw that we saw son of Son of God and daugh of God it is in the Book of Genesis that God say let us make m in our image let us make man in our image and it is in Genesis that you can find that you can find the serpent but in Genesis also you will find Son of God of God let us make in our image let us make man in our image blessed be the name of the Lord as brother John said book went back to his honor and the book came down and the book came down and this is and this book gave us Authority this book gave us power this book gave us Glory the message the seed is not with the Shar says he said now notice in the Pentecostal age through the Luan age through the
