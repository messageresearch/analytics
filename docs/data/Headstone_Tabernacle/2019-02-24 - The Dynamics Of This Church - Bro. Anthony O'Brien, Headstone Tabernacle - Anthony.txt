know it's a privilege to be here in this time of season a lot of old sages and prophets wish they were here but we are here we have a job to do this morning a many many man priests God is not right and I have a title this morning a man and it's from a quote from the Prophet a man that he preached and we know it's very familiar to us but for some reason well I know it's the Spirit of the Lord and you know reports speak something to you he just anoints it he knows how to bring it out and since Sunday there's one of coaches stirring in my mind and by the grace of God I've been able to see some things here that corresponding us to and so on this and my title is the dynamics of this church that's my title Eman the dynamics of this church now and every church had its dynamics Lutheran well Luther had the mechanics and dynamics is now right Wesley had their mechanics and dynamics for their Dean but we are promised mechanics and dynamics for our Dean and the Prophet clearly identified what was gonna be the dynamics for this church a many man is now right what was gonna take us to the rapture what was gonna take us to the skies amen he clearly identified it a man on this message here what shall I do with Jesus called a Christ he said there you are he said that's the hour that we've arrived at and that's the big machine that is set up he was talking about denominations and he was talking about the and her and her daughters is now right and all the the religion in organized is now right and as Luther came and as he left they organized and prophet said when they organized the pillar fire move right on out because you can't pine the Holy Ghost to any creed or talk man praise God you can't box Gordon put God a little box and pull him where you want to no no no no you can't do that to God as soon as God realize he's no longer welcome here move right on out hallelujah hallelujah is nothing you can't Park squat down if God wants to fill somebody today hey man he's suffering to do so hallelujah could do anything he wants to he is caught he said and I changed not he said and if he fell a man yesterday he'll do the same today you do the same for you if God delivered daughters who effects with unclean spirits how much more God today could deliver your daughter your son whosoever praise God I don't care who it is I don't care where it is the voice of God could break past dimensions oh oh if you're faking reach out this spawn and touch the thought of the unseen I believe God is able this morning to do more than you could ever expect Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and you're willing to comprehend forget about your mind is small forget about your intellects forget about your human reason and we're gonna talk about Jesus let's talk about Jesus the King of Kings the Lord of lords let's blow a trumpet this morning and blast out all human reasoning oh it's all filthy rats this morning oh but let copy glorified let god be praised and let your fate rise this morning to believe that God is able to deliver God is able to restore korra's able to seal God is able to heal he breaketh the teeth of the ungodly he breaketh the pans of wickedness voice breaking those cheaters of Lebanon Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now faith is the substance of things so for faith for now fate for right now we need faith today not tomorrow not next week we need fate right now the power of God is laying there but not enough faith to move it but this morning if you could just get started if you could just get the praising if you could just get any atmosphere creates a circle around you find an environment of worship create a place for him to move create a place for him to calm down inside all he inhabits the praises of his people when you praise when you shout when you lift your hands angels on this patch to fight for you to give you the victory Oh hallelujah praise God the devil loves to fight worship you love to fight the atmosphere because anytime you in the atmosphere you reconnect with who you really are oh you taught who you are now is who you really are no no no no not the struggling you not this tell us you thanks you praise God up one day down the next variable States that's not how God saw you in the beginning come on now come on now prayer was power and I laid a foundation I'm here listen listen the theophany we are going back to it's a victorious theophany the theophany party that you are going back to the glorified party the spiritual party that you are going back to it's not the defeated party that party doesn't know depression that party doesn't know frustration that party doesn't know praise I'll put the devil and whatever that party knows about kicking the devil out of heaven praise and if you're gonna go back to that party then we're gonna kick our depression kick our frustration while we have a being called a man Oh cast off the works of darkness this morning let us put on the armor of light please call her and fight the good fight of faith hallelujah amen amen that we'll be here for a many blessed a lot of people and not a joyful sound the toys the Lord is our strength this morning finally I am happy today I am happy today hallelujah hallelujah jesus said don't praise God because the demons are subject to you but give God praise and glory why because your name it's written in heaven hallelujah praise God that's why we praise God that's why we come this morning that's why we give the devil a run for his money because we know who we are all the people that know that God shall be strong and to create exploits Oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory be to God amen Oh hallelujah hallelujah a many man whoa many man said you feel the Spirit of God this morning amen sound like in a groove okay I think we can strike the Jordan now amen glory hallelujah okay so my title demand dynamics of this church isn't all right a man of my subject God reproduces himself now I was reading this quote here and I was saying that he said the big machine you've got all the mechanics see all the world system government system right its mechanic just leaning me he said any only thing they have to do is to have Satan get in here in there with his dynamics to force the marking of the beast so it's like the wires already plugged in everything is hooked up and all they waiting on is this Luciferian satanic spirit to come into it and to empower it and enforce this system but the devil has had a long time to set up his Eden and he has done it marvelously there's technology is convenience there's buildings his architecture is government system structures to second coffee why would you want to leave this earth there has to be a vision greater than this that your heart is longing for but your soul is crying out for all these pills and all this mortgage and all this mess there's got to be something more than this that we are looking at for City this morning who's bill and mica is caught I'm not satisfied we just come in a church no but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed Oh have you received the spirit it's a pill of fire burning in your heart if not Oh hallelujah so we see the end game we see what God is pointing us to back to the spirit before there was were there were spirits and that Great Spirit anointing spoke and out of it came logos word which had to go forth first before anything materialized so he said let there be and then like materialize but before like a come a word had to be spoken holily and that comes from the awesome praise God original Spirit of God now that spirit hallelujah it's trying to call you back to himself but the only way he could do it was to the word so you have to speak a lot here you come in 2019 ojala little pick up your word to pick up your spirit to pick up your anointing for your tale to run the devil's out of your life to let the devil know whose side we are to finish a battle that was started in heaven call him man hallelujah hallelujah Jesus came it's not right he said the Spirit of God is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel isn't that right but he stopped in the middle part the day of vengeance have all gone that was not his part to bring yet he was gonna bring a bride one day to do that part please Papa Haiti coming his first coming isn't that right and he was anointed isn't that all right he healed the sick he raised the dead he cast out Devils but look what happened when he died on Calvary you know what happened an instant transaction took place in some transaction all of the sin that the prophets could not undo that the Kings could not undo but the sages of their time could not - Moses went underground Joshua went in the ground I went underground Oh hallelujah it was cause people but there was pound oh holiday because there was no perfect sacrifice for sin but he came the sinless one he gave me all-powerful one he gave me omnipotent one and when he lay on the cross he said it is finished and the Bible said he gave up the ghost and when that happened when that happened the devil was finished right oh when that happened every sin he was about to commit in 2019 was remitted hallelujah hallelujah not guilty praise God Oh hallelujah hallelujah instant transaction Bible said a son hid his face the winds began to blow the mountains began to dance because they saw the great shepherd was smitten to redeem nature back again o all creation o begin the shout for joy the veil was rent from the top to the bottom the crane to open and the sleeping Saints a pair o in some transaction ha ha ha now I tell you this you think that something you wait till the power of God strikes this church the Prophet said when the power of call fully connected when the head unite with the party an instant transaction it's gonna take place come brother Branham overcome Wesley I will come all the Prophet glory of God hallelujah

even in this modern age with all of this technology we have creature comforts that Moses didn't have and Abraham didn't have look at the day that we're living in cell phones internet freezes narrator online transactions I pull up pick up my phone and I'm at the bank sending money to somebody else what are you living in and yet in all of this technology God is still the same its principles are still the same Oh hallelujah holidays to the same today it's same rules still apply you still have to have the token and it's gonna be another people in the land who in the midst of all of this modernist that has failed mankind still believe God in the core of the prophets in the court imposes in the court of Abraham on hell yeah we still believe that God don't care what the devil throw in our face don't care how much how much internet how much TV praise God it cannot distract us from what God has got to unveil in our hearts in our souls Oh hallelujah cannot help but speak of the things that we have seen and heard and at the line and roared who can but care a little lord or a spoken-- we can but process I praise God [Music] hallelujah oh my hallelujah line is getting ready to roll brother when that angel drop town he brought it was a row of authority how many open his mouth seven thunders under their voices a message to the prime the taker out from here and into glory it be so simple it be so sweet so humble she'd be living her life but you have to hurt you strength to strength from faith to faith growing in God right under the devil's nose oh and he won't be able to do a thing about it because he's six thousand years too late he took the book he took the keys right now this morning Jesus holds the keys of death and hell he's got the key to your purpose he has the key to your destiny he has the key this morning he has the key this morning all you've got to have a speech what says the promises of God the access the keymaster and he could turn that key this morning Mary had a key one time she said I know hallelujah Lazarus is dead four days old but even now you can still do something even now something could still happen for our brother and jesus said hallelujah hallelujah he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live resurrection power lay in him [Applause] hallelujah she turned the key and you could turn the key this morning to your baptism to your Holy Ghost to your anointing to your promise you guys have to have take this morning reach up with spiritual fate grab ahold of God's promise if you see the word go forth and you know it's for you that is mine [Applause] oh it's a glorious church without spot or wrinkle that's what he died for oh my hey I'm still trying to read this quote here I'm taking my time this morning is that okay all right he said now when she's forced down then the dynamics is working so the dynamics is a working palm that comes upon the mechanics that comes upon the material apart it's not much to make the gears turn to make the pulse move to make the thing push up and down it's a dynamic that is working that's a dynamic power that is turning isn't all right the Prophet said the mechanics is there he said they've already got them we'll system and he said now let me say something too he said this u19 time to see churches uniting nations uniting he said it's a uniting time of God and his bride - and he said that I say this with reverence and respect he has a prophet hear this he said I believe that the pride of Christ is called oh right then he spoke it yeah you're coming for hit he's picking you up he said I believe the part of God is Paul I believe Holland he is he's standing in 1963 he's speaking because he know there's a bride in 2019 who's gonna hear this very same message this morning he said I believe the bride is call I believe she sealed into the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is there and they are waiting for the dynamic that will take her off the earth and into glory in the rapture I have caught prophets pocket I believe it and praise God a man a man he said we don't know he said I believe it all my heart he's a man is not right he said we don't know dynamics I'll take off the words in the glory an interruption he said I believe it with all my heart do you believe it this morning it's the only hope the church has today so I believe it with all my heart because there's nothing to go back to we've already burned the boats so there's no going back we've got to go for whatever whatever I'll take your sword and run into the battle hallelujah praise calling man if God be with me then I shall be able I believe it all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's gonna do it but he shall do it he is the dynamic or let me say that again he is the dynamics so after he set up his own system God set up his own system in you burns all the lust and lies burns out the filth and trash burns all the worldliness all the desires for the things of this world then he comes and sets up his system his button of light is inside of you expanding expanding he's getting more greater holla little he's consuming you then he himself Christ Himself comes down into what he has created and he works the thing and if he wants to do a certain thing all you have to do is tap his mechanics on the shoulder come this way come this way unless there's something I want you to - I love her God move what have his own thing going on revival going on sweets Peter and James and John on all of them all of a sudden God whispered in Philippi and pull him aside and say there's somebody that is on his way to Ethiopia I have to go talk to him I know you're having fun in the church and are enjoying the blessings but in somebody you need to minister to and Philip was translated over to the Ethiopian eunuch travel like a fort broke through dimension to meet God's predestinated and this man was sitting in a horse carriage in a chariot and he was reading but he didn't understand and yet come Philip Philip was anointed he come and he asked him a question he said understand this what no Reedus and he didn't know I'm Philip pull him aside the Bible's he came up into the chariot watch me hard I happen because the chariot was going a mile a minute but this was Philip being translated hallelujah hallelujah oh quarters move up Rick next feat when he ready to deliver when he ready to anoint when he ready to restore hallelujah I'm Philip Minister Tim there and they found a pool and Philip baptized a man and you receive the Holy Ghost is not God use Philip no you might say Peters anointed man why God ain't called Peter or I gonna call Andrew you would tell god what to do if God find Philip is the man for the job God called Philip what you have to do attach forget about that praise hallelujah what is that to thee follow thou me God is in charge take care of his own wonderful is all gone Amen praise gone she says yes sir I believe it he said we don't know how he's gonna do it but he shall do it he is a dynamics he said we just become members of the Machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts that he hands them to us as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper and we're waiting we're watching for that there big church is to be United and here's what I got a phone and said the dynamics of this church what will it be he said it would be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body so while the headstone is coming down God in secrets in mystery it's getting a bride ready how by a refilling of the Holy Ghost Oh hallelujah you're gonna see your receive you're feeling [Music] [Applause] what does it mean it means that Joshua the Holy Spirit is gonna go through the camp with a knife and begin to circumcise all of the ones that came out of Egypt and will pawn along the journey God's gonna get a people ready to possess their Mountain the spray yeah Josh what a Holy Ghost trust what the Holy Spirit's gonna cover that knife knife of circumcision what's he coming for the cut off the excess flesh cut off the loose things cut off the world from you hallelujah hallelujah Oh Lord that you could be crowned with the glory of Jesus Christ everything so easily beset you give you the power to run this race with patience the Holy Ghost Joshua with the mocking knife angel all those that cry all those that want their portion on those that one day inheritance on those that are not satisfied this morning just to come to church just to be nice people no no no no no you want the Holy Ghost and fire you want a but from above you need that pillar fire the common side your soul and burn the demons out burn lose the fault of your heart alleluia alleluia and make you a real Christian or no Christian at all we want to clean church or no church at all we want all God or non God willing to go all the way hallelujah the devil will use the ninety nine and nine-tenths but those who's got a hundred percent on for God isn't that yeah they're the ones that God will use because God can the devil can't find an inch of space to work in you see you got yourself a 1% leave room for the devil the Bible said make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof and it makes me think about that rich young ruler when he come to Jesus he was a good man the Bible said Jesus loved him he come and he asked good master what should I do to inherit eternal life and so on are you gonna tell him well in obey the commandments and do what's right and it'll come to church be a nice Christian so he say well this I do from my UT I'm doing this since I'm a small man no I'm a big man and I still feel the same I come to church for a long time but I still feel the same I don't feel no change it's become a routine for me it's becoming order for me it's become a schedule to wake up in the morning and to go to church I don't feel the spirit I don't feel the anointing there's something wrong but I just can't put my finger on it Oh hallelujah I need a change but max I need something good master I need something to make me whole I'm only patch hallelujah hallelujah bull thing and at that point the Bible said Jesus loved him love projected itself and then in an atmosphere and not a holy holy spirit now was examining his soul almost like a x-ray on the outside people look normal but when you take x-rays it does expose some stuff we take an ultrasound it does expose some stuff that you didn't even know what's wrong with you thought she was okay you know you feel a little funny they come to the doctor for a checkup and here was this man come to the good master because I'm sure he went to other rabbis and priests of that time maybe he didn't get the answer he wanted but he ain't come to the right place he come at the right time and maybe this morning you come to the right place just at the right time to hear the right message hallelujah hallelujah yet Jesus said you've got a money demon it's like a soul you better sell all that you have [Music] sell all that you possess even not nice thing you put up on that pedestal that you have don't like those own now just turn on any morning and take off any night that thing sell it that thing that you idolize God said I will have no idols before me walk before me and be there for perfect that is the commission that God is calling us to is now but some of us we keep idols keep things locked away and no one knows we're shaking hands and we're trying to be the best we can and that's alright what was the cue yet jesus said he that loveth his life in this world shall lose it but he that hated his life in this world shall keep it until life eternal because he's gonna give you a new life a new walk a new talk to set your affection on things above halleluyah halleluyah if you're willing to give up or then God could fully occupy the space and he has in there and he put in man for the Holy Ghost profits it is a small compartment in the heart scientists don't know what it's for profits that I believe we've caught put a space there got to be a purpose for it I believe that's where that spirit wants to dwell in your heart you got to be able to take him to school with you to take him on the job with you when he stand in front of the bank teller he must be able to see Jesus looking back at him praise God have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe hallelujah glory to God a man [Applause] hallelujah the dynamics to this church the dynamics to you dynamics to your mechanics what's mechanics wood wood a line upon line here a little there a little precept upon precept oh honey teaching is now I was literally placing you but not what you need is that Spirit of God to come and confirm his word what he spoke all those years what he was always saying to you oh my we'll get it free Scotty man I've got some things here if I praise God we're gonna strike it you love him today amen amen oh I'm so happy a man I said you would all know take too much time so let's go that he's a big dynamics we just become members of the Machine of his body that's a beautiful line even forming ourselves into his image and then seeing him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us before the wedding supper and we're waiting we're watching for that are you watching for that today Amen they're big churches to be united it's not right okay said now dammit dynamics of this year to be refilling the Holy Spirit that we work in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head on the body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that my my my my my you know what that's like that's like you have a car all tuned up or a piece of machinery or something that's just maybe it's just missing a little part maybe just need one part to work on your hunting all over looking for that part hey man that's how God is looking for you this morning he needed that part for it to work I know if it was a screw where there was a plug maybe it was the smallest thing but he just needed that one thing maybe it's a fan belt I don't know just needed something to get this thing moving they kept this thing into March and once it was in position he could turn the key and the thing would ignite so this part is getting ready because she has to catch the headstone there's a void or cap up there that you will call out of this laude CH I don't have a permit here but he'll call out of that laude CH to fit into that void or gap towards Donahue stones stones out of different corners of the earth all over the place God is gonna call different ones that's why you come from different places and different backgrounds different Society holy oh but that does any German who you are but because God predestinated a bright God put a seed of predestination in your soul I see the perfection that you will not satisfy with who you are that you were called to so much more than this and you believe that with all your heart and God led you this way he let you that way he brought you this way you fell this way you have this trial you at this test you beat yourself up about it you felt all torn up but you are still coming on Hanah was still working his way out quad was still working on you God is still bringing you out he's not finished with you yet the work that he has taught me to you he is able to complete it this morning so that you could fit in to that point or cap in the pyramid to catch that headstone to complete the body work a man a man so he could come down into it oh please amen they cannot be a man you love him for a hallelujah so that's who we are call out as lively stones a man fiddly joined together into this party mystical body of Christ for this last day to do the great work to finish the work a - alright praise God a Christ left off for us to do here now watch he said know for myself this image okay alright a man the full power of the Holy Spirit so we need the full power to take us up holla we need to connect hallelujah to bring up the dead in Christ we need a full pound holy night in order to have the full power God her to restore the full word back in this last day all our scattered throughout the ages right that's why God call the profit in this last thing to tie up all the loose ends to finish all these hidden mysteries things that the people didn't know to reveal what Luther was doing the part that Wesley had to play the part of the Pentecost has had to play to reveal the open door age and to show that whole thing come down right down into this last day to show that this last day prior the shootout the dynamics comics holiday to go up into glory to connect with what they had back there hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the Prophet to reveal the full word so with the full word restored every single part now the fullness of the Holy Spirit could come down into the bodywork and seal the whole thing and make it live and it'll speak and they'll create itself hallelujah all these things that we're looking for a man is not right will be fulfilled at that time when it connects isn't that right priests gone so I wanted to strike my subject here and I know that now God wants to reproduce himself I just want to stress on this for this a few moments and I think about sometimes a mother maybe you know any mother would love to have children in Sumer and instead his hire of any mother any woman to come at a point where she where she wants to have children or to have a family of always narrowing and how she wants to you know bring four children and to experience that and I feel how God maybe felt that way too at one time that he wants to to reproduce himself he wanted to Tirta to bring forth something like himself he had a desire to do it yes I don't know how long time wasn't measured then but he stayed alone with his thoughts and he had these wonderful thoughts about being a father Savior healer and I know we talk about it a lot but I want us to focus on the pathway God's building and desire is because he wanted to have sons he wanted to have somebody to talk to he wanted to have somebody to fellowship with Oh hallelujah no wonder he told add on it's not good for man to be alone because he knew how that felt and that's why he laid Anam down on the ground in that deep sleep and out of his rib he brought for Eve and now the man who stole accord was happy Boris please isn't that right that man was no longer alone it pleased God to see his creation come forth to see Adam comfort any time God look at Adam he would smile he would rejoice because finally after all of this time there was somebody on the earth that looked like him I walk like him talk like him I could be like him he could talk to God wants somebody to talk to this man and when we pray when we go into a closet what are we doing we are reconnecting with our Father we are reconnecting with our Heavenly Father who has a desire to talk to his children to talk to his loved ones to talk to his sons to talk to his daughters God wants to have a relationship with his Alleluia with his thoughts so there were no more talks God spoke it's not right we know all the logos comfort creation and man and everything else finally he was so pleased tele to caress because a man on the earth had the authority to sign a check he looked like him walk like him talk like him mainly animals to what you want to do God come to such a point of rest like all he had to do any evening was come down and ask out of our report how was the day well I changed this tree I didn't like this color so I found it look nice what do you think about it wow that looks good couldn't have done it better myself my holiday of a relationship they were having conversations Adam was given a report every evening holily about how well he was doing and the father was happy hallelujah and corn was desire for a son was meant through Adam - even so on what desires I have children then it became to hoever gaan quoted his family it's not right but now the devil stepped into the picture and now caught all Adam you gave him a commission what did he tell him he told to multiply and to replenish and subdue the earth and do have dominion over it isn't that right you take control you take charge and the devil saw an opportunity to slip into God's program and to break is now right what God is coming on to so before God he could come into that multiplying time that season that was supposed to come around where God would reveal how that would take place but ever comments to put a stop to it isn't that right and that's how sin came into the picture and that's how the devil the serpent was able to corrupt this this being this man that caught it creating and slipped us little discrepancy in there isn't that right and all creation fell hallelujah so the devil was successful you can see temporarily in hindering God's work but that's ok because it's in the weakness it's in the fallenness it's where he shows himself to be strong and sometimes we make a mistake and we feel like we can't come back or we feel like it's too far for us but right there it's where God shows himself to be God Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how could he be the god of forgiveness if there's nothing to forgive but we were lost in sin we were souped hallelujah we were down in the dumps we didn't know who we were real almost cut off his night but for the blood of Jesus that reached out his hand and pulled you up out of the darkest deepest depths that's the card we serve this morning that is Jesus that is what he can do oh but he can do it Oh hallelujah hallelu if he didn't know guilt you wouldn't know that the liberty of the freedom of the sons of God when he reveals himself to you when he unlocks and opens the prison doors when he sets you free when his prayer comes upon you when you feel the anointing of God because you know it's not like the world it's not like anything the worker gives you know the world you've tasted a world but this is the French this is unique this is God coming down upon your soul Oh hallelujah how can you be satisfied with anything less than the Spirit of God in your life Oh hallelujah hallelujah once you taste it you want more of it hallelujah Amen young people only after to its taste God wants and you want more of it I know it for myself that's why I could speak it I don't serve God just because to be a church boy or church girl or something no no no but because we had an experience because we felt God we felt the warm rays of his Holy Cross we know he's real we know he's alive we know he is powerful we know he is glorious all you have to do touch God one time and see if God don't do something for you it'll give you the boldness to go into the school to go into the job or wherever you are I let them know you're a Christian how are you a Christian because their Bible your Bible person you like to be nice no no no no it's not about being a goody two-shoes it's about meeting getting into contact with the pillar of fire getting into contact with the core of the Bible you heard about him you read about him but now you need to meet that called yourself by a glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire it'll come into your soul it'll change you it'll rearrange you what this is do it today right here 2019 I believe protocol of people out how will he call them not by works but by fire by fire not by man not by intellects but by the fire the Living God Oh God to his holy spirits will rebuild the church again and the power of the Spirit Oh hallelujah alleluia alleluia alleluia alleluia alleluia Oh fire God coming to your soul PI of God coming to your hearts we need the fire we want the fire the same fire and they had on Pentecost that's what we're praying for that's already crying for that's what we burn and for that's what we long for we want to see Jesus in this message in this church in these people once more to get direct from God [Applause] [Music] fill me Lord Jesus I wanna be filled with the Holy Ghost I wanna be sealed with the Holy Ghost that angel is on the earth now he's sealing souls into the kingdom oh he could do it this morning don't you be afraid don't you be dismayed Oh hallelujah all the dynamics the dynamics the discharge is a repellent of the Holy Spirit of the Holy Ghost Oh God wants to reproduce himself in your flesh in your heart in your party he wants to walk with you he wants to talk with you he wants to come inside more than you want to receive him he has a desire a burning desire to reproduce himself in your heart a burning desire to reproduce himself in your soul in your heart in your hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh God oh poor out the dynamic slow oh we need it we want Oh glory we see the world coming into such a condition oh it ought to make us desperate the world has gone insane they've gone crazy they're trying to they're trying to change the laws to accommodate homosexuality and God is still the same gotta still judge that thing hallelujah but God has a bride on it who in the midst of all of this filth she hallelujah is gonna live Jesus Christ what a paradox how are you gonna do it it won't be by your human spirit no no no no no it'll take a power that we've never known before greater than what you've ever felt to come into your soul eternity has got to blast into you the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Oh hallelujah God wants to take possession of your heart and soul and make you a partaker of his divine nature it takes a fire to do that it takes fire to make you a real Christian it takes fire Oh hallelujah to make you live to make you love the unlovable if you want to real love it starts with the fire the living call in your soul [Applause] he puts his love in you dynamics to our mechanics we need the power we need a power yes we've had the word in this message and it's produced very little it's not right but if you ever could put the word together with the spirit if the word of God you mix it with feet that creates expectation and then watch expectation for what for the Holy Ghost for the dynamics of God what happened you see you can't get warm by a painted fire you need a real fire in order to get warm and you don't need a fire tomorrow we don't need a fire yesterday we want a fire right now the young people need a fire right now the kaleb's need a fire right now right now in the service the backslidden ones need fire hallelujah oh I need a fire you need a fire all of sand apologists now and baptize everyone hallelujah we need we need it Lord we needed Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory all glory my I don't know how much I get true but

Pizza had his struggles didn't I Roberto Papa Eve struggle he could see cried he denied Christ he was angry he was a mess but Jesus told him after you converted strengthen the Brethren God lay our promise for that same pizza crust but pizza fisherman pizza call him whatever you want but when the Holy Ghost come into Peter's heart brother you know sometimes they go to our restaurant and you see somebody get a steaming hot pilot plate of food and they say whoa and you tell the waiter whatever that man had I won't wanna rap too well when you look at Peter's life after he receive the Holy Ghost

pillar fires coming Holy Ghost is coming oh ha ha John stood up on that day said I was not like light but I bear witness of that light I actually baptize with water but there's one standing among you

hallelujah hallelujah Oh blowing my oh he's here to give you a real experience hallelujah on that day many will come to him singing lord I did not cast out Devils in your name didn't I do this didn't I do that Jesus said depart from me you workers of iniquity I didn't even know you so it got to come down to unknowing you've got to know God for yourself and the only way to know God it's just not by revelation only but by an experience of the Holy Spirit where he could make himself known to you where you know that he's alive because he's inside your heart how can I deny what I feel in my soul I know he is real oh oh and when you walk through the gates of glory those kids will open for you why because there's something in your soul connect with em gates open up the gates Oh hallelujah oh you come from God you go back to God Oh born of his spirit washed in his blood oh honey oh no desire oh my lovin Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my wonderful I think I could skip some of this here oh oh how do you lovin today oh what a presence we won't be long again that's for sure we feel the presence I've gone here now Oh hallelujah we turn over to the superior soon you just ride the anointing he said now of course we know that God couldn't fulfill the promise to Adam to multiply the devil stepped in all right so God's plan was to always reproduce himself so when the prophets come Joseph an agent and and all the sages of all isn't all right Abraham Isaac isn't right they were already showing likenesses of Christ I was to come but when Christ come on the scene he was a magnificent one he was another Adam that God could look down upon finally got to continue his work that he had started on it's no wonder jesus told his disciples he called Philip ecole Andrew they didn't know where they were being called but it felt something on their souls they felt something in their hearts they knew that this was a messiah they couldn't quite explain it isn't that much but he was calling them why because he was getting ready to multiply and replenish he was getting ready to reproduce himself he said a little while long my the world will see me no more but you are gonna see me and because I live you shall live also unless you got caught had sent me even so send I you no wonder he said on that day you shall know I am in my father here in me and I knew no one hallelujah before God could pour out his Spirit upon them he had to speak at first he had to put the word out there first so he told them certain things and the treaty is the son of man will be lifted up and they into the hands of sinful man it's not writing a treatise he be raised up again honey pull them what what happened he told them what would take place a man is now right hallelujah he came unto his own the Bible said and it's all receive him not but as many as received him that them gave he power God knows who would receive him oh my do you know who you are this morning you are not just anybody but you are them who would receive him you are his hands you are the Sheep of his pasture or how can the devil block you from his hands we know the truth hallelujah and the truth is what sets us free no wonder he told him unless a corner wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but when it die it bringeth forth much fruit you keep dropping off the word speaking unto them it might seem like they couldn't handle it because it couldn't understand it but he still had to speak it because he knew he was gonna come around in that resurrection ministry and begin to open their understanding to the scripture hallelujah how to shoot him what he was telling them hallelujah that's why I told ya I went Christ I'm in some transaction took place so for three days he lay in the ground but on the third day by the word just as he spoke it he rose up holidays night the mighty Conqueror harlot and in the evening service when they were shot in afraid of the Romans there was hair wheaten they were their parents didn't want to go sign it was a too afraid to pray it was a solemn assembly but all of a sudden Here Come Jesus the Bible said he came in to them while the doors were shut let me tell you something there's no tour this morning that can shock brought out if God wants a common side he's gonna find a way to get in there because he wants to bless you o people try to shut go out and they get despondent and they get you know content 3 maybe or maybe get discouraged sometimes and it happens in a Christian journey and sometimes I feel like we just shut everything out and we don't hear from nobody but there's no tour this morning that you could close hard enough if you are predestinated God's gonna find you brother what's gonna find you sister God will make himself known to you oh you shut he'll find a way he came in and he spoke to his disciples and we can't encourage them and he breathed upon receiving a Holy Ghost hallelujah because a transaction already took place now he could put in hallelujah he could issue out the warrants but it devil's arrest now because he's holding the keys he's got the authority over everything in heaven and energy and he kept them the Holy Ghost he said sorry in Jerusalem and wait for the power I'm gonna give it to you I'm going up so that he could come top hallelujah praise call him a man oh and they waited and they tarried and they prayed and they praised God continually oh it didn't happen on the first day right man but Isaac said and I did not put on a second leading up on the third day but it didn't discourage them they knew they'd heard from God they knew they heard from Jesus they finally knew who this man was hallelujah hallelujah oh my imagine these brothers come at the church for three and a half years and didn't know who he was imagine you going to a church and you don't know who that man is but you just know this is real you just know this alive you know you never felt anything like this ever before for some strange reason something keeps holding you something keeps holding arranged you don't understand all of it but you know God spoke to you you know God's doing something in your life you're not what you ought to be but you're not what you used to be you're coming on to something and for all of a sudden after all those years their mind was a lot I saw who they were and to what they had to receive brother you can imagine what kind of service they had that's the kind of service we have in right now we understand by revelation who we are and what we have to receive hallelujah that you have to receive the same penny the same Holy Ghost that Peter received and Mary receives not genre Philip all of them Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you know that that prophet came to turn us back to the feet of the father's tennis back to the feet of a solid fathers that once more this bully had direct from God what we have to connect back to what they had hallelujah we have to connect back hallelujah hallelujah is now right to the Spirit of God the word stay on books and tapes for a long time hallelujah is night but he our common now is when the true worshipers are gonna worship the father in spirit and in truth how because they will have dynamics and mechanics working together spirit and truth in the church or power of God working in the church dynamics upon the mechanics in the church calling sin out Oh hallelujah calling out the unbelief calling out the uncircumcised healing the sick raising the dead casting out Devils hallelujah so he's spoken to them why okay wanted to reproduce himself and in order to do that he had to give them the word the word as prophesy as to what he was about to do among them and in them and all he didn't quite understand it he had to say it he had to speak it before his resurrection ministry so here was another Adam that please Gordon so much that the Spirit of God drop down and say here is my here is my son my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell he a him Christ isn't that right hallelujah was all at God once God poured himself into this man God had another one like him on the earth and this man had a mission he couldn't stay like that because he said unless the corner wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth all so Carl had to find a way to reproduce that same Jesus he had an urge and the only way he could do it is to release the spirit that was upon that man because that's the only spirit that could come back upon the worshiper isn't that right because the blood of bulls and goats was only a temporal pardon for sin but the spirit of that animal could not come back upon the worshiper isn't that right because it was just an animal it was just a type it was just a sacrifice God temporarily received for sin at that time but God was coming on to the fullness of his sacrifice isn't that right I fully stopped his atonement for sin and the only way he could do it was true Christ so here come he spoke another one into existence and he come through Mary a sinless one and he lived and he acted and he did and he pleased God and he learned obedience by the things that he suffered and he grown with a headache he was tired yet at the grave of Lazarus he said Lazarus comfort he was a man yet he was more than a man because what was failing him was the power to release you from your guilt to release you from your shame hallelujah praise God praise God that's why he told them that the Son of man had to be offered up holidays night at the hands of sinful men why his spirit had to be released because it was yet to go in the presence of God you remember with Iran the priests and everything they tied a rope around him and they let him go in blue and sing it ringing holy holy unto the Lord a man they couldn't go in themselves if anything happened to Iran in there they had to pull him out nobody could go in it's not right but now the veil was torn not that he had made a way this morning the same spirit I was in Christ because he came up the coast that Holy Ghost had not coming to you he released his spirit the same spirit that you could not catch that you could not access that made you strangers and foreigners but now through the blood of Jesus Christ we have been made kings and priests and fellow citizens of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] which means this morning you have every right to clean the Holy Ghost you have every right to pray to cry out the ask God for the rain that is caught for your promise to clean every promise of God hallelujah hallelujah the secret things belong unto the Lord God keeps it a secret the coming of the Lord a secret here he has that all to himself no man knows the day or the hour God has a man what he has a secret set aside no man could know it but the thing that he has revealed that belongs to you in other words if Corey village if God spoke it then that belongs to you this morning and if called to a prophet reveal a message of the seven thunders carrying a bright together and that message is for you this morning that's your promise no table to take that from you if God reveal that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit the gift of the Holy Ghost then that is your promise it could reveal up to you then that belongs to you this morning oh you don't hear me you don't hear me if God reveals to his word that your thought is gonna be healed then that belongs to you this morning if Paul revealed that your family will be delivered that your husband will be delivered that's all wife Amy deliver that belongs to you this morning and if it belongs to you then shame [Applause] ha that's a few more I'll close my soul says yes this morning I want every promise I want every word I want every blessing that God has for me Oh hallelujah hallelujah so this latitude and the attitude is what brings the results holiday so when we come into the house of the Lord it's an attitude Lord I mean business with children Jacob had an attitude he ran for a long time he was running running from this one running from that one but it come a time when he had to stop running called forth the issue and God this morning it's gonna force the issue if love don't get you desperate conditions will call with force the issue in your house in your home in your life and drive you to your knees until you get to prayer until you get to cry not at the altar until you realize that there's no way around the Holy Ghost that there's no way up or down left right no no no no no you've got to come through that same baptism if Mary receded you have to receive it this morning if Peter receive it you have to receive it this morning hallelujah you've got to receive it brother pan and receive it you've got to receive it this morning hallelujah oh my you've got to receive it seem annoying thing the same penny a man is not right hallelujah oh my okay huh well Gordon took over I don't know what to read here he's calling man mine halleluyah halleluyah let me readers here real quick he said well you got to see you say well the powers in the gasoline brother branham and said I don't care how much power is in that gasoline unless there's a spark it's not there to manifest that power unless there's a power there to confirm that that's gasoline it just might as well be water that don't matter how much t ol oceans clean how much people preach away how much how scientific they get isn't alright he said how well your you got your church set up how much education you got how much like the Bible he said until that wave sheaf until the Holy Spirit comes upon that person to quicken that way he said that gasoline represents the word what is the gasoline it's the word is that it's the truth he said but without the spirit it won't move let it kill it but the spirit giveth life it is the life giver to the word the Prophet said I've spoken with the original seed the watering spirit is what come upon the seed to make the seed live the Holy Spirit is the watering spirit that comes up on the seat in your soul and makes it live it's something else then when you praise God it's something else when you speak it's something else when you live it's something else it's something got ahold of you oh I went to a meeting one night and my heart was rich and my life was rich and I was praying and I was doing my 1/3 and all of a sudden something got ahold of me Oh [Applause] that's what I want today that's what I need today oh and we won't rest until we get it hallelujah do you feel that way many men oh my oh my he said we have put too much stress on the mechanics here at my but nothing on the dynamics he said it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is gasoline the word isn't there oh my he said it might be in a gasoline can it could still be water see it looks the same he said but the only way to prove it is to put this life on it it's not right and it'll prove whether it's gasoline or not amen he said I want you to try to put a holy spirit on a denomination he said you're as much your your you you can get a spotter he said but you ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon isn't all right he said but oh I'm so glad that there is a ten thousand teen power the Word of God what is it a ten thousand octane power and a Holy Ghost to light it up that's what we need this morning if you get light up there be no more dead services but you on fire what did that policeman say the Welsh revival you looking for it I've got it inside of me he was whistling he was swinging his bat oh I've got the Holy Ghost oh Jesus on the mainland tell him what you want he was on the job but he had an anointing in his soul he's got something hallelujah looking for a world revival it's in me isn't it right oh my oh my to light it up and to the resurrection power of God into a man's life or woman's life or to into a church he said and that shoves the Cadillac down the road yonder under the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit which come back and was waved over the people at the day a penny car making him the same yesterday today and forever amen paragraph 1 oh we said there's been churches churches prides prides churches prides prides hallelujah coming down all total ages he said but there has to come one the prophet said hallelujah there has to come a real pride I believe all this God didn't come all this way for us to come ninety nine and nine-tenths but courts gonna call a real pride right here in Trinidad right here around the world right where you are new internet God's gonna call a real pride hallelujah out of the nomination hallelujah prayer she won't be a denomination but she'll be the Word made flesh Oh hallelujah hallelujah she live the life she'll walk the walk she'll talk the talk she'll do the works jesus said he that believeth on me the same works that I do shall he do also hallelujah praise calling man oh if we cleaned out the Holy Ghost then where are the works where are the miracles we've got to have the same works and he had when he was here for that same Jesus it's coming down on the earth now fixing things around for his coming and in you he's gonna do the works jesus said greater works than these shall you do because I put on my father [Music] [Applause] hallelujah oh my my let me get ready to finish hallelujah isn't that right it's got to come one a real bride and they must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it makes that church live and move in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place he said until we find that place he said what good does it do to polish the hubs you just marked in time isn't that right but you're not going anyway you're polish in the hubs doing the same thing over and over praise God know different that's what they had to do this morning do something difference what we see should get every stolen action together sopran to get us a crier get us into action weekend to exercise your faith we can to realize what you have inside of you when you leave this place begin to have faith pretty impossible ask God for anything doesn't matter I don't care what it is begin to ask God stop living under your privileges you are meant for greater things this morning we're gonna claim your promises you don't have to except heat sickness you don't have to accept disease you don't have to take it do not sign for it it does not belong to you this morning healing belongs to you deliverance belongs to you the Holy Ghost belongs to you it is unto you and to your children and as many as our power hallelujah praise God holiness it is your portion to them that believe oh oh my what does it do the Polish ahab's what good does it do to give our facelift for a simonized job or something see when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics proved to be right it's got to be a dynamics to make it work to make it work it was working so until in Peters shadow people are being healed people's being delivered people's being restored Oh hallelujah sick colony are being recovered why because God was being made known all the time they were shouting and hollering in the upper room the devil is lying though the devil turn over in his bed he pulled a couple they just make a noise no sense for alarm yet no need to worry they just make a noise but when Pete on them when they decide to go to that gate for beautiful the he LaLanne who was there a long time baba said he was about 40 years old or so some like that in there a long time he was lame from his mother's womb he didn't alter walk he didn't know to praise God he didn't notice if God properly he was all crippled up he was that asking for money Oh hallelujah hallelujah it not the praise he didn't know about this Jesus thing hallelujah oh what a thing Jesus had passed true and yet he didn't heal that man maybe he maybe he saw Jesus in his time he was a long a long time as lame from his mother's womb Jesus had just died not too long ago there was pizza and them coming to the gate called beautiful hallelujah but Jesus had greater works than these shall you do Halle Jesus no honey they're gonna come around heal this man pray that man was not forgotten no no in the great apostolic ministry Jesus is gonna come back around don't worry I haven't forgotten you you might be 40 years in your condition Oh hallelujah pray that God's gonna come around for your children for your loved one for your neighbor don't you worry he has not forgotten you come Peter silver and gold I don't have but such as I have I give thee rise up and walk he didn't wait for the man to respond no no no he pulled him up and instantly the Bible said his feet bone receive strength his ankle bone received strength what did that man do you sitting in your condition a long time and you get here what did you expect the man to do he didn't just clap with two fingers well praise God I'm healed no the Bible said he ran into the temple [Applause] the man went straight to church run into the temple and begin to dance and shout and scream oh oh he was walking he was leaping he was praising God and the people asked what meet at this and Peter told em rose up and he told him it's not by me that this man was he'll this is not all works that any man should boast but this is that same Jesus who you crucified and hung on a tree that's chain Jesus it's what heal this man Oh Oh repent and be baptized in the name of the same Jesus we see the same spirit you'll have the same walk you'll have the same life you'll have the same dynamics brother the Prophet said this pride when the power comes to her they're laser crippled she'll walk into that hospital room speak the word just like that and they'll rise up out of their cuts rise up on to their pets you can imagine that hallelujah when the practice to know who she is when you get to know who you are brother there's no Philistine that could ever stand in your way there's no Philistine the prophets had to stop cancer just stop diseases she stopped the powers of the enemy Oh hallelujah glory at all musicians get ready [Applause] I feel religious I feel religious I feel like shouting praise brother/sister young people young man you might read about comic books you might read about Superman you might read about Flash but have you ever heard about Jesus he's the greatest Superman that there ever was imagine cancer is coming a mile a minute and God raised up a power to stop it right in his tracks to reverse the power of aging to reverse the power of death yet where is your sting grave where is your victory the greatest one the sinless one the mighty Conqueror is here this morning to give me the holiness and to make you a messiah a little of Messiah Anointed One something please go hallelujah I'm getting ready to close out just a few coats and I'm finished the prophets hair at the end you could continue praising him hallelujah I'm getting ready to leave a man freeze gone Holy Spirit is here a man this is your day this is your time back to the Bible that will try to cut us off years from getting to this point but he's finished this morning he's finished right now he's finishing his church he's finishing your life you're gonna go back home with the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God and defeat every Amalekite every Philistine in your life yes that's who you are that's what you're called to praise God prophet said in the first seal at the end of the Pentecostal age he said we re supposed to receive according to the world as God helped me tonight to show you here that we had to receive a messenger that will take those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the rapturing of the church I love her but Isaac said last week he said the purpose of the endtime message was to lose the Holy Spirit it was to lose the Holy Ghost listen yeah he said Ananias comment 47 mysterious thunders that's not even written at all he said that's right he said and I believe truly seven thunders rapira field in the last days it's in order to get a bride together for rapture and Paige because what we have right now we won't be able to do it we need the dynamic power this morning in order to be able to do it to do the greater works his 9 he said but there's something he said this comment for something that's something is here and now I believe it for a mine he said there's something we've got to step a little further and that's what they're doing today and that's what we'll be doing this week will be step a little further a little further than pray a little further push a merry man is not right he said we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly he said but we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment I've swept all the desert and we'll find that after a while the Lord willing we are gonna find where it is written and on birth pains he said I go God has set some in the church through the labor pains he said already got tremendous sometimes he said but when a church is growing on the persecution of the outside world believing on the Lord Jesus not the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was to Pentecost how they grown and how they crack on the labor pains but when they are born and positionally pour into the kingdom of God the Prophet said then the Holy Ghost has set in a church some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists then he given to their speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom gives up healing all kinds of miracles when does that happen after the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall receive the dynamics to this church is now right are filling up the Holy Spirit that's what we're seeing today one more quote to be understand jesus said see through this mountain you could play some softly he said and you would they what about it thing taking place that the ministry that were entering into now he said we're way up the road now he said soon the coming of the Lord Jesus we've got to have a rapture in fate in a church that could be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go he said but don't worry it will be there it'll be there this morning it'll be there today when the power of this church rises it'll bring its brethren the power of touch it rises it'll bring its brethren and then the part that church will rise and bring the other brethren and then there'll be a general resurrection we are looking forward to it meet Allah bless you I'm finished give the Lord a shout of praise the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy

anointing here how we love to ship you hello how to ship you have a testimony to read the morning seen some thanking the Lord for His blessings towards me before praying I usually read a scripture so last week Wednesday the 13th of February I did my usual routine and when I'd opened my Bible Hosea chapter 6 was the first scripture that I saw so I started reading I knew God was speaking directly to me and when I reach his second visit started after two days he will revive us and then just thought came to me that two days from now I would I had an intention of fasting because I usually fast on a Friday then the scripture continued which said in the third day he will raise us up then I remember the third day from now is gonna be the youth service which we had the last Saturday so I knew I had to be there then the end of the scripture said and we shall live in his sight so I knew I had to have a closer walk with God I did my prayer and fast that Friday with faith that God will revive me then I went to the youth-oriented service believing and I'll be raised spiritually from the anointing and will be there Sunday morning you can keep playing when I had reached to church I was blessing and thanking God for the three blessing that he gave me from that scripture and after by the Isaac was finished preaching I was worshiping in the wood after came to my mind when it came the third time I felt the anointing which was causing my body to shake so I made my way to the altar and they I received fire baptism the upper part of my body had a feeling of tingling I felt so weak that I could not support myself my eyes could not open and I was not fully conscious I am trying the Lord for His grace towards me in this experience sister Juliet we appreciate his testimony today amen and God is just getting started friends just getting started we'd like to welcome some visitors and our gates believe is June Bob blue Bob and Lucy mall where they are god bless you welcome to headstone Tabernacle we are delighted to have you in fellowship and free that today's service would have been a blessing and encouragement and an inspiration to you on this journey of life as you find your way to your purpose in God because only God knows your purpose amen your natural father doesn't know where your natural mother does know where the principle as no matter your boss doesn't know it and everybody was to define who you are supposed to become and what he's supposed to do but only when you come to the manufacturer of the thing you get the real intent of the thing you could take anything and use it for anything but the manufacturer of the finger one who made the thing knows why he made it you can use a pen to do you could use a pen to still water you know if you don't know what a pen is and you see ie somebody's turn you pick up a penny who study juice and you want to sweeten and that works but the original manufacturer of the pen put something in it to express itself so when you put it on paper something comes out and you could write and many of us have misused and abused because we have found ourselves in the wrong place in the wrong purpose and our own calling but when you come into contact with a manufacturer then your purpose can be identified and you can abide in your calling and if God could really do something with you so god bless you welcome thank you for coming and may gorkon you to work with you service continues this Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. make every effort to be here on the great expectation there will be no service this coming Friday mail me no service on Friday and this Sunday coming there'll be just one service tell me no Lord supper on Sunday Sunday evening we are making preparations to head to a marrow youth retreat just to be clear the only midweek service this week will be on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. there'll be no service on Friday and this Sunday will only be one service maintenance team group six please meet with brother Adrian Joseph after the service and I know some of you would have already been aware but if you don't know but the four passed away this week was it with a fourth of the church Green Street una Puna pastor Eric Ford so the funeral going home service will be this coming Tuesday at 10 a.m. at the Tabernacle they on Green Street into anapana there'll also be a short meeting immediately after the service for all those who would be going to marrow next week Sunday so for those of who haven't Peters yet we want to encourage you to get that sorted out today if possible and quite honestly the cost is is no any aware the actual cost is to spend the entire time of the including food and everything is $150 and for those who are not staying it's a hundred dollars for about six meals or so so I'm not quite sure how they're pulling that off but I know it's a very collaborative effort and it is also done in an effort to encourage as much participation as possible in addition to that our annual convention is rapidly ahead of us it's just about five months away it's amazing how quickly the time is going and we are trying to redeem time you know so July 5th 6th and 7th we want you to already begin to be conscious of those days and for those who need to apply for those days we encourage you to do so for those who intend to break Beach I can't speak to your employer situation but July 5th 6th and 7th we look and have a great time in the Lord again knowing that we don't have much time left friends we don't know if we'll be the last convention and this for us is our fifth convention 2015-2016 17 18 19 so this is our fifth by the grace of God and five the prophet or is the number of Greece you know so it's the grace of God that we could even reach this spot but more than that it'll be the grace of God for what he does for us for this meeting you know and brother Branham said if God would ever pour his spirit wouldn't even be our effort but it'll be the grace of God and the headstone with Comet shoutings crying grease grease on Satan we don't know the day or the hour when our time will come and when the rapture will call and the rule is call up yonder but while we do have the strength and the ability to do all we can do for the kingdom we want to do all that we can do for the kingdom as well so as is our custom we work very hard to prepare for the convention from a hospitality perspective from the physical building from the technical team perspective from the meal preparation and the hotel coordination and air flights and different things like that so once again we solicit your support and your financial support and your support in other ways in the future to pick up at the airport and all these different things they all have a part to play they all have a critical role over the years we have gotten a deeper understanding of all these things work so on the one hand it is it is getting easier but at the same time there are still a lot of responsibilities that are still concentrated on a few individuals and you want to share those responsibilities as much as possible to share the burden in every way that we can and to really have our heart for serving the body of Christ beyond the vision of the local church and it's to see what God wants to do because it's one body and it's by one spirit we are baptized into the body so the sisters will be downstairs with forms if you are in a position to make a pledge this church has never been one to impress upon the people to put a certain amount we encourage you to do as the Lord would lead you to do one thing that's very evident here is that there's always evidence of what's taking place and the progress that's taking place and of the yesterday we had four brothers doing training on a technical system off-site as well so we are continually looking to put things in place to continue to do all that we can do until he comes and then we comes all that sin is natural is done you know you know I asked the question last week what does yours what is mines because the Bible said the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof everything is his and we want to give our time we wanna give our heart we want to give our our substance and whatever we can do to achieve his purpose he has no hands with our hands he has no feet but our feet he has no voices but our voices to encourage somebody to serve the Lord occur in some way to get back on step get back on track that's that's that's our responsibilities because God has spoken to us the 120 no upper room where the first-fruit of the 3,000 that would come but God had to use somebody to reach somebody else and many of the young people they don't know much about testifying and reaching out to people but but that is being as a part of your Christian journey and all these things we have to see manifested before we can leave here because God has not changes by the Anthony said we have instant coffee we have cell phones we have technology but God remains the same and its principles remain the same its laws remain the same and his blessings remain the same so we encourage everyone and whatever way you can to come begin we have about five months February March if I'm a June 5 months to allow us to contribute towards the success of the Convention and what will go what God will do you know so a man you love the Lord what what Sorkin says Amen with the Michael you can switch over
