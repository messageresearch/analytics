it's so good to have you here tonight uh in this special bible study and at this time we like to just boil heads forward a prayer heavenly father we thank you for your divine love and for your grace that you've extended towards us in this of trying and testing and uncertainty father but your word is sure your word is certain and i pray and i invite you tonight to come into your word and read life your scriptures for the scriptures have been a sealed book for all these years and we know you told daniel the book will be unsealed in this last day father and seeing the vision and prophecy to us and if we conceal a word for us whatever word you have for us may you unseal it unveil it tonight that it will have such an effect upon our lives that will be changed granted lord in jesus might ask it amen god bless you and before i read the scriptures tonight i want to share a testimony that we got today and this is from south africa may god bless you pastor ovid we are messaging you all the way from south africa our hearts are blazing with fire and gratitude for the virtual convention you will never know how much each and every meeting meant to us uh it was and it still has given us power to keep pushing on the conventions timing was heaven sent my wife and i were diagnosed with covet 19 the tuesday before the convention we went through the darkest storm of our life the conventional meetings gave us so much needed faith to believe for our healing and during each service satan was fighting our bodies but we kept on pushing through the pain and sang and rejoice in the lord we are now recovering the convention was our lifeline i still believe that god spoke to us through every single service we pray that god blesses you and your support system richly and continue to lead you the foods of the kingdom of heaven god bless you richly and brother luke and sister sarah van greed uh they come from africa and they send a little testimony so we thank god for that that nothing that we do for the kingdom is in vain it has an effect on the bright body whatever that is so tonight i want to i want you to turn the bible so romans chapter four we want to take a scripture from the roman chapter four and we want to go into um a study of romans chapter four and i have a sort of on the line team launch out anything would have in his wood fighting for put your feet into action you know um it is one thing to believe and go to church and you know you have a testimony and so on like that with another thing really when you begin to put your feet in action and put your feet on the line and to me this is what god wants from so let's read from chapter one of verse one of chapter four romans chapter four what shall we say then that abraham or father as participants of the flesh had found or if abraham would justify by works he had way off to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness out of him that worketh is a reward not reckon of grace but of death but to him that get not but believe it on him that justified then godly his fate is counted for righteousness even as david also described it the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin commit this blessedness then unto the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness or was it then reckon when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received a sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of defeat which he had yet been uncircumcised but that he might be the father of all them that believe do they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also let's bow our heads one more time i'm going to stop you for now we're going to continue after father i thank you for your word lord and as we read it you it our hearts and jesus might ask it email me holy bible in that spot there because we're gonna continue okay so um let's talk a little bit about justification because when somebody receive christ and accept the lord and walk in by faith and they are justified that gives a different title and give us a different position altogether in terms of accessing god remember when man fell he fell from number six his sixth sense of faith and he was just in these five senses fighting up there wasn't no real lying connection to god so the first thing that had to be restored was faith feet that sixth tenth is the first thing because the truth is that is the only tool or the only way we could connect to god is true faith it's not true or flesh it's not true or five senses it's not you know feelings and or emotions what relates to god or communicates to god is this thing called faith feat it's a sixth sense it's a powerful thing it's almost okay describing like an instinct something that you can't explain you just know you know like you know you want to succeed your exam you know you're going to pass this test you know you're going to get through here you can't explain it all the pieces not there together but there was something deep within you know and without knowing now you push yourself in areas you didn't think you was going to push yourself before because it's a sense of faith that is pushing there so god called abraham and god bless abraham and abraham believed god and his fate was counted for righteousness now i know and we all know what the lord uh what was taught to us concerning what james wrote okay so james uh james said it's a little different he said now even so fate if it had not works is dead being alone this is james 2 16. and he was talking here about if a brother is destitute or naked or destitute dairy and if one of you say the path in peace and be warm and be filled notwithstanding you give them those things which are needful for the body what are they profit become like using an excuse instead of doing what is practical or doing what could be applied you only talk and they talk and say be warm be fair go your way and so on like that so he said even so fate if it had not works is dead being alone ye a man may say thou has faith and i have works show me thy faith without my thy works and i will i will show thee my faith by my works don't believe us that there is one god don't do us well the devils also believe and tremble but will thou know ovine man that fate without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works are we fine the scripture we read in romans 4 he said he was justified by faith and james is saying here in verse 21 was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar seeing dull how fate wrought with works and how by works was faith made perfect and brother branham he taught us and he shared with us that it wasn't a conflict of scriptures it was not disagreement it was works expresses the faith that we came to have so in other words you can't really have faith and there's no evidence there is no life witnessing evidence of the faith that you're claimed to have if you have fear where is defeat if you have fear you will talk your fears he will speak your fears if you have doubt she will talk your dog she will speak your doubts because faith have an operation that goes with it and this is what god wants from us abraham believed god he himself became the father of fate so let's read this part again verse 22 of james two seeing dull how fate wrote with his works and by works was faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which said abraham believed god and was imputed unto him for righteousness or he was called the friend of god you see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rehabbed the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without their spirit is dead so fate without works is dead also so let's come back here now and verse 11 of the scripture that we read and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of defeat which he had yet being uncircumcised so this faith that abraham had he didn't he was not circumcised yet but he believed god so this fate he had was before he got the confirmation of the fate which is circumcision this faith that he had was a fate that but inside of him a faith from god a fate of god a faith that abraham had written in so he said and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of defeat which he had yet been uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe so that scripture here that this part here the father of all them that believe that is jew and gentile that's for us as all of us all them that believe though they be not circumcised that that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that fate of our father abraham which he had yet being uncircumcised let's continue for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abram or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the lord be ears faith is made void and the promise made of non-effect so god is saying all these promises that have been pushed out is for those with that faith is not those of the law but it's those of the faith but the promise that he should be here of the world was not the abraham or to receive to the law but to the righteousness of faith but if they that of the law this is verse 14 faith is made void he is faith is made void and the promise made of non-effect because the law will get right for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace oh this is good this is good verse 16 therefore it is a fate that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not only to that which of the law but to that also which is of the fate of abraham who is the father of us or so friends tonight that fate is being conquered as righteousness just think about it and then you can understand why god sees us through the blood why god sees us as sons why we have access and while the enemy dies his job is to bring you those questions about your access to god your access to the blessings your access to inheritance let's continue as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believe even god who quickeneth the dead and call it those things which be not as though they were who against hope believe in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall i see be and be not weak and fate he considered his own body now death when he was about 100 years old nearly at the business of serious womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god you could pause here on that verse 20 wherever again he staggered not at the promise of god true unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he promised he was able to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it is not written it was not written for his sake alone that it was imprisoned him but for us also to whom it shall be impuged if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for offenses and was raised up again for our justification all right so this is the chapter romans chapter four we read the whole thing last verse who was delivered for our offenses and was raised up again for our justification and justification means as if you never sinned in the first place that's what justification means the blood speaking on your behalf all pray is gone so this is really great and god put election in abraham and god calls a man by election and that is why iban could be justified and and and his faith conquered as righteousness because of god's election hallelujah just think about that now because you are elected god could come and justify you not because of your feeling you did this you did that that has not do with it is because you are elected his blood come and atone for you and his resurrection the the tools to bring a justification for you as if you never said so that's supposed to give you that liberty that freedom to praise to worship the acknowledged god the love him and the civil with all your heart that is what that does that gives you a liberty and and that is just a beginning because we bible talk about the glorious liberty of the sons of god so he said i am so happy to know this one thing friend that christianity has no negative nothing to it oh this is there's nothing they can shout tonight christianity has nothing negative for it it is everything absolutely positive a man that becomes a child of god has a positive hold on calvary and calvary has a positive hold on him with the assurance by almighty god and ought to himself that he will raise him up in the last day and take him to glory oh this is wonderful tonight that that is positive it is very very positive especially in the times like this it is very very positive that jesus died to redeem us jesus died to justify us and our justification from by the faith hallelujah the faith is conquered for righteousness is that something tonight isn't that beautiful tonight that your faith in the promised world is counted as righteousness just think about that tonight not your feelings not your failures because you see abraham the bible said he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief so abraham that what i want to talk about that being his commentary is commentary when god wants to make a commentary about abraham he'd never talk about his weakness he never talked about his lying he's never talked about his backsliding it never talked about that it talked about abraham this is signed by god this is written him this is this is not this is not this is not abraham writing his own story this is god wanting the story to be known like it he said abraham this is the commentary about ibrahim he said i want mine to be like that not your failures not your shortcomings not your sins not your mystery not your past no but abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief what was strong in faith giving glory to god we we we believe these promises these these precious promises that the poor will suck the church there'll be a bright revival you'll be filled with the holy ghost you'll be delivered you'll be on fire for god you what on there the devil will be under your feet all these things you will possess the gates of the enemy all these are promises you are heir of heaven your healthy earth you are heir of peace you are air of joy you are all these things you're not an air frustration depression upset knowledgeable kind of things all these incomes are captured and throw your own balance you're not air of those things abraham was seeking a city whose machine builders god what a kind of man in other words that man is so liberated he's so free i am down because he's like a drifter he's seeking a city nothing can hold him down you pick up isaac you pick up a tent you pick up a desk but he's moving on he know there's got to be a place somewhere are you like that when you see this corona virus and this is serious people dying of virgin being attacked and virgin coming down where the people are dying it's just that we are grateful to god and it's humbling our hearts but that we don't have it to run into our country and we are grateful to vote for that uh we bless god for that because you see you think about it a lot of mighty men so-called mighty men and men who think they have all this great power and and men who make people up make people to believe that they have a lot of power a lot of stuff when these situations come they realize it's just like dust they're like just ordinary men they have no power to do nothing that is why we could call for power that is why it will take the fate a call for this power are we talking about not imagination not your emotion it will take a faith and that is why it goes in a profit in its last day to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers you cannot go in a rapture without faith you can't go rapture because you have a nice clue that much rapture on it you can't paint rapture on you and go in the rapture it's not working like that you have to have rapturing faith faith will be changed in a moment a twinkling of an eye this is it it's real it come like if you have to go away like sometimes i have to go away you have to get the yellow fifa inoculation you have to get this i get the alpha tablets alleviate tablets yellow fever inoculation you you have it when you get to the border they ask you for these things if you don't have it it's a problem you have to have these things but okay to go to the rapture you have to have these things it's not a matter that you're going to this church this are things you have to have if if you're driving the car and the licensing officer stop you or they probably stop you they say driver's permit please okay you'll forget it you're not supposed to forget it they will charge you you see you have to have these things you get greasy raptor express and they the ticket conductor say where is the feet you see well um um there's no arm the board that raptor expressed you have to have defeat and that is what bhararan came to bring us to we can't fall short of it we must have it we will have it it would have released for us to have it that is why we shared a sunday that the word out of his mouth cannot return for it he already prophesied a bride he already saw a bright seal he saw a bride with the power with the anointing he saw the unity of the fate there's a prophecy that is going to be a unity of defeat not a unity of churches not a unity of groups a unity of the faith so it all comes down to this fear that we're talking about now remember when israel came out all of them heard the prophet moses all of them heard the books and the tapes but it's very few had the faith the others didn't mix what they were hearing with that thief so what abraham had is still original what abraham had is still important because the promised seed wasn't seeds as badazar preached it was seed which is christ so abraham's royal seed was his fate seed wasn't nicer the real royal seed of abraham was defeat and that's why jesus come back and all those guys came part of the generation of jesus christ because he was the end game of this fate that ibrahimovic he was what was prophesied to deal with his supern's head bruce that's the prophecy he was was that promising that god promised isn't that right oh praise the name of the lord so abraham the longer it went 20 years 25 years and so on and years the more stronger abram got that is a paradox there's a paradox some of us started off when we were very young and our hair was jet black no we have too much brothers because time just runs so fast that the black one grey and the gray almost want to go white so so so so you think about it we have to be stronger now than where we first started to make it to the finish line you can't afford to pull back now you can't afford to give up and the photo let go now you have to continue pressing on but the longer it went the more of a miracle it was going to be oh my elongated work just think about it lock down and the church coming back out stronger they're coming out strong you have to come back just like we said sunday peter was going to lock them in the upper room but they come under that struggle you know what happened to them power struck me and power want to strike that bride he said this way is this the mystery of the thunders that would bring back a power to the church the mystery of it is the mystery fate is the mystery to pull along the power something will not break in we have to see it because he says when the bright get to know who she is that she can do the greater works and she could discern the two spirits and withstand the false spirit then she gonna be an invincible army so it comes down to what you have to be conscious of what you can do what defeat in your soul revealed to you that you can do oh praise the lord so but i made a tremendous statement about launching out and that is why i have that as an underlying team of laundry now there are people that i know have never i don't think they've ever launched launch out uh it reflects in all areas in business in work in what if you want to get a scholarship if you want to make progress in your life in all areas to get from where you are to where you want to be there are steps that has to be changed nobody gets success by chance it doesn't just happen success is not an accident achievement is never accidents somebody who at the top of the game is not an accident in sports a runner a bicycle person a boxer whoever it is they don't be at the top of the game by chance it's by work it's by labor it's by striving it's by believing it's by exercising themselves it's by taking a race after race after race or in criminal boxing uh match after match after match and conquering this one and that one and they they have harder trials it's like whether his body building is is more weights have to go up and so on like that so so nobody at the top of the craft or game or top of this uh business or whatever it is they achieve it by yes people work out like how uh the president in america says um devour man but just go you know i mean he's hoping he's burying his head in the sand just hoping it will just disappear and he don't want to listen to the instructions and the guidance as to how we could mitigate and how we could try to get it down and the curve and so on that is not his burden and concern so so we don't want to be like that you're hoping you're making the rapture you hope you're a christian you hope you're a believer you know you're open you come true no not the bible doesn't say abraham hoped abraham believed god and he he staggered not that he wasn't hoping you know he really had faith and this is where we are challenged tonight amidst your circumstance and i want you to put it real around you right now whether your husband cuckoo your wife cuckoo your children cuckoo whether the job cuckoo whether everything else nuts around you you have to see your situation what kind of faith you have to have in your situation every one of us is in a situation repeat that it's not that the pastor doesn't have a situation or the elder didn't know that everyone has to have a situation that faith could be effected let me repeat that again everybody has a situation right now it could be a goliath it could be a soul it could be a a whole body like abraham like whatever it is it could be cancer tumor sickness disease knee problem back problem foot problem white problem husband problem cheering problem job problem money problem emotional problem temper problem anger problem hostility problem whatever problem with the body reflection in mind in whatever loss problem whatever problem but amidst whatever challenges and situations you are called to have faith now when jesus was looking through this drama that was unfolding before he was crucified and he saw in the realm of the spirit the plotting of demonic activity and demons to destroy pete he gave peter a warning he said peter the devil won the safety like wheat but i prayed for you in the realm of the spirit the evil forces they will do every single thing that they have to do to destroy you to destroy you therefore every one of you here in this room is a target i want you to understand tonight i want to change your pictures tonight don't think you like a bystander you might get a little wound like a little attack the object is to destroy i want you to think this the devil don't know who's the bride we ourselves don't know who's the brand we claim to be bright by faith but what what we can't say with concrete this is bright this is brightest bride no no we can't really see that we believe by faith i mean i have to believe it by faith now the bride they are the one that will be missing because like isaac said but as a preaching are you talking about every time you never make a move the chord is coming crush it so when he thought he had everything locked down enoch slipped out and the devil cannot find enoch the realm and he mentioned that enoch vibrate out and go into he can't go there enoch was not found and god put enoch in the age of the pyramid as a sign for the bride in the last days that there's a pyramid bride that will not be found so the devil knows something about to make a move now when when the bride goes up satan becomes incarnate satan becomes flesh satan take up his throne in the purple that they have in rome that is when the devil becomes active the spirit of god that covers the earth now will be withdrawn before the bride leaves the bride will have this let me see if i could use the words this way harvest the spirit the spirit will be only in the bride and the bride will have the authority to give mercy and life the blood will be represented by the bride and the earth when the bride is taken out is as if the blood is taken out there is no more salvation it's judgment that is the reality god doing the final mopping up work we are not the bride in total the majority of the bride members are under the it right now we are the capstone bride that is why we have to have the abrahamic fate to prolong this cap somebody going to do it somebody going to connect to the headstone but abraham that by the banner the holy spirit told him right told him that as the bride nears the headstone she'll be in his very image and likeness yeah we should get jetta as you're nearing it because the spirit had come along from the headstone connecting to the spirit of the bride and as you're near the capstone power flowing glory flowing she kind of flowing the witness of the spirit flowing it has to be here because the people for the brighter preach of eternal loss there has to be a manifestation to declare who is the bride as a witness to preach to eternal loss it can't be all this talk we talking talking talking it cannot be that because the ark the accident for seven days rainfall noah sealed in rain is falling and the people cannot get in because god shut the door so the ark stood as a witness it's a horrible thing to think that people will be flying into the church someday seeing power seeing miracles seeing all kinds of things taking place and they cannot access it now is the time to access his grace and mercy by the revelation of jesus christ no but obama was saying this here and i want to get this here to you here he said i'd like to speak for a little while about launch out and that is what the trouble with the people's feet tonight you're afraid to turn it loose there is many of you got feet but you are free to let it loose now don't worry take it lightly you know what i'm seeing here tonight i think this is very very important very very important because if we could get this right this church has some time like will be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed if we could get this fit right let me see it again if we could get this right this church will be more than the most powerful churches existed because you are not limited by an elder by a pastor by the church itself you are you are you you have no limitations because you are dealing with what god has promised you don't have a pastor that kept in you you don't have the ministry or the teaching that limits you to anything we are saying abraham believe god and whatever god leads your soul to believe you can have it you can have your healing tonight you can have your deliverance complete tonight you can have a revival tonight you can have restoration tonight all the chains around your life could break off tonight not tomorrow tonight yes right no features the beauty about faith you don't have to push both feet no faith is so here we hear this if there's many of you god's fate but your friends didn't lose your faith with all works is dead just as your body without the spirit is dead and if you got faith show me your faith by your works you see paul was justifying abraham by faith jeans justified him by works and paul said abraham was justified romans 4 by fate and so james comes over and say that he was justified by works now both of them one confirmed the other now paul was speaking what god saw his fate james was speaking what man saw his works and if you say i got fit in god and afraid to put your faith to work then it won't do you no good you have got to launch out a wreck where you are see launch out say it again launch out one more time launch out say i have got to launch out make the whole statement i have got to launch out wherever you are whatever you're doing there is always something further ahead you have to launch out i have the launcher i have the launcher let's continue that's what the matter the people stay there in this world many of them has faith but they are free to launch out with it you're just afraid to venture a little bit just to see where i can i can do all things well i can i can do all things with christ who strengthens me look at him launch out into the deep and let down for the draw o praise the name of the lord hallelujah we'll give the lord some praises right now father we praise you father we bless you we thank you for your word we thank you for your presence lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen so abram received the promise number one before he was circumcised god watch your ordinary man drop a promising look at us go call us all different walk on life and drop all kind of bright promises from us and before he could get and we were fortunate because we got locked in ulya croc to the channel of the bridal promises so therefore he wasn't into the topical preaching topical interests what i call filler material and sometime i talk about that brahm says when you see the message your rest is filler material you know like when you get a box a gift somebody don't hand you something and they look like a gift they put in a box to wrap it they put things around it people and whatnot when they get the gift you tickle the string here you unfold 40 bucks and you get a gift right you see when you see the message that you think inside the rest is what they call filler material like like like uh soup and seed whatever i will do with that nice information on what took place back there so we have knowledge of things that we don't know why this was done but if i come and tell a freak don't concede on the supernatural scene and it's up and i see doesn't receive that you're not going to get certainly raptured that's your knowledge and information and revelation saying what happened back here there's a lot of stuff like that pope israel los angeles other things i'm not doing it right has nothing to do with the bride being changed and transformed and what we want to get to is for the main thing to be the main thing that you do waste the time somebody tell me i don't waste your time i don't want to waste my time let's get down to the main thing and we talk the main thing we get done to the main thing that's because the main thing you have no they call long mobi you have some sugar you catch it long because you want to make it long we don't have to do all of that it comes at the point that will focus you get it tight and you hit bullseye that is what you want to get he said if i could get a man woman at their soul right the the most powerful get this thing because every person in that church becomes a powerhouse by divine revelation there's nobody trying to pump you nobody popping praise god wishing god no nobody's telling you no you calm your hands at me here you know atmosphere inside your house you fall down you break your foot whatever it is hallelujah glory glory glory because it's the brown thing you're talking about you're feeling pain of course you're feeling pain you're feeling pressure i'm not allowed abraham i i encourage your body to move and sometimes i tell already i said i didn't even really see me though you know i mean okay yeah holding your hand you're holding your foot trying to get your body on and moving but this is life but there's a faith that is real a fit to believe god so let's continue now abraham received the promise before he was circumcised he received the promise before he was circumcised and then he was given the circumcision as a seal of his obedience of faith and brown was saying you are not converted until you are changed when you think about that change change in spirit change in mind changing desires changing objective you know you come to the lord get baptized in jesus name there's no change really yet you what changed your status in god change because you know a redeemed person you know like a justified person you you like he you pick you up like a dirty glass you pick you up your status has changed you know when the hands of god you're dirty still in god's hands now you're once partying smoking drinking he picks you up that's a change that's a change immediate change he pick you up you say lord forgive my sins have mercy upon me this mercy come down to you mercy dripping at the cross your change your status change where you are and then you come and hear the word the word come a clean process like a washing machine look like he closed washington and you know you know just truly close the washing machine and pull it back out it's a wash it has to has to go through some time to choke on it and that that rocking motion lies the word the washing of the water by the wood and you're inside a deer like a tub spinning around inside of you okay and every day you go out you you get dirty you get different torch you get different things and now they come back and service they get they get all washed and different every services are washing urging cleaning not cleansing and then the object of that washing to prepare to fill you because god's objective is not for you to be a church member justified and sanctified and separated and you're not adaptation as a mathematician as a catholic that's not god objective what you're not what what objective is what you are to be so it's not a matter i am not i am not like that man i am not i don't do like them i i don't cut my hair i wear long dress you know it's not what you're not is what you're supposed to be so so that's why he said redemption is in two parts coming out of and going into it's not what you come out of you can what about this but have we gone in so it's more than coming up it's glowing halloween hello food hero i escape fail that's exciting but then escaping pharaoh is not the goal the goal is to hit the promised land because that is yours wilderness is not yours escaping pharaoh you're still journeying to the promised land so therefore the experiences and the liberty and the joy of escaping hallelujah you can sing specials for 40 40 days 40 nights you're singing specials everybody can sing a spectrum and write this a new song too but that is not the promised land that is just inspiration in the wilderness you see but then when come to jordan now because you see when you come to jordan you are hearing a revelation of kitten kepler's ammo right and all the heights so now you know now this is not pharaoh again now this is not fair you're behind your back now this is what are you going to do because every place you put your foot is yours tonight there is nobody hindering you tonight you are your own hindrance i can tell you tonight as your pastor there's no church hillary in us there's no church affecting me there's nobody having rent free space in my head i had to take on this pastor or this church nobody bothers me me bothers me because i know if i could get rid of this guy called to you if i could push him out of the way man forget it i will launch the moon make a spin around when i come back let's just tell you just break out with but unlimited you know when you see people do it in natural you see people doing a business they watch an idea they built an idea they see it grow they see the expand they see it explode and you said wow i remember when the guys had created skype and you hear how you could talk over the internet and they started that and then they send skype for two billion dollars and i think microsoft had bought it and then afterwards that's the effect all them telecommunication thing that they run all the wire against them pull and then they call overseas and then they get what's up and they're talking every part of the world and you watch how technology make a lot of and a lot of stuff transform immediately like you ever studied the person who made a calculator or even it was right what going on if that was zona yeah you you know anybody has backed up right now the phone doing the calculator the the phone have of lightness you know things have changed even with this kona virus the operation of churches have changed have you changed are you changing are you adjusting i'm not talking about being here in this meeting now there's just part because see you being here just like if you're in church but change means your spirit your mind your thinking that has to change they came out to egypt but egypt didn't come with them could somebody say amen could somebody come up say amen they came out but what was in them didn't come out so when they came up to the promised land which was the line to say glory hallelujah let's take it i don't need joshua and caleb cross because the other different spirit the the word that they heard was mixed with faith don't let this word not be mixed with feet tonight wow so convert means to change and jesus told peter and after you are converted strengthen the battery so he was specifically telling peter you have a change to go through and when you receive this change you could become effective to help your fellow brethren but that change is coming this is peter who passed all devils this is peter who was working along with jesus jesus peter was anointed and preaching and everything else jesus said they want to sit here as we i know you're going to come true um so jesus by vision but i've seen peter deny him that's why jesus could tell him you'll not be treated peter don't maybe at that time believe that but jesus saw it but after you are converted straight to the breach i know what you're gonna do i know where you're gonna fall i know where you're gonna fail but i could also say you will come true could we give the lord a shout on that one because i believe that you will come true so your struggles and your challenges doesn't disturb god because what he knows is what's inside of you and the faster you come to the realization of who you are it makes things a bit easier because moses got messed up when he fled egypt he taught nice that his ministry is over he had to chill and relax himself and whatnot he thought but but what was in him he couldn't change god put that inside of him god equipped him for the job so even though he was out of sync with his purpose because god equipped him for the job that's the only man got to pick up with so when the time come what reached out and said time up now i want to pick up moses activate him by the spirit the dynamics activated by pillar of fire set among the egypt as an activated sun before he was a son but not an activated son he was a son but not a spirit endued powered son he was a son but he wasn't inspired the way god wanted it before his intellect was inspired but not the heart when moses was activated he was a direct channel of god and with a direct channel dear is my spirit flowing freely the devil and iranian because you cannot defeat a man in his position in his jurisdiction because the earth is over jurisdiction that is why adam had the dominion like exactly and the devil couldn't bother with that because he was in adam domain the only reason the earth is under satan control the prince of the power of the air is because adam lost it he lost the inheritance so the devil assumed squatter power because adam had none after that and his quarter power gave him the right to reign and rule on the ut until fire come and fire were burned as an exception together to clean up all the heavens to clean up all the demons activity hallelujah and fire come to us to clean us up too look what we baptise my fire to change this mortal and put it into immortality so i hope you're enjoying and what we're sharing tonight but this conversion after a converted strength the brethren says he was sanctified and but he said you think he put that spirit in a vessel that wasn't fit he went out cast all devils come back shouting they returned shouting and praising god i said the devil subjected us he said do rejoice they rejected the name in heaven and he said but when i come to pentecost judas was there shouting too and rejoicing he said when it comes to pentecost to receive the baptism of the holy ghost today people don't want to talk about pentecost they don't want to talk what baptise they don't want to talk about these things power and different things uh somebody called me a power preacher you know anytime you get you or a child when it comes to pentecost to receive the batman when he goes they refused it and betrayed jesus that was the antichrist and that spirit will come right down and teach justification by faith and everything else and move right on down to the baptism holy ghost and then it will show its color so you see you don't want to claim something you don't really have you don't want to think you have the oil you don't even have the oil and you're including you have the extra oil when you look now anybody will come it looks recognized the tank you have is really empty you know people have sometimes people have two tons of gas in the house and when one gas run out they have every chance in the world to replace that they replace them and when these second gas tank run out they recognize they have two tanks to replace them so now when you go to get it replaced also we expect to have the all finished advice of looking for gas in a desperate way all you got to do is when one tank finish and replace it you always have backups you keep the peace in your head and peace in your mind but you see is that discipline to do that anyhow there's a next show by itself but listen let's continue every promise is true to the belief that god will take out his word take god's word and call those things like abraham the bible said abraham called those things which are not as though they were he's tagged not at the promise of god true and belief he never considered his own body his own body now dead but he was persuaded what about you tonight who call yourself abraham's season are ears of the same promise if you have faith that abraham had if you are abraham's seed then you've got the same fate or you couldn't be abraham's seed okay if you have your bibles just turn to galatians 3. let's look at this scripture reading from 16 gallatian 3 16. and we want to read galatians 3 16 and then go down to verse 23 and it reads now to abram and his seed were the promise made he said not and deceits as of many but as of one so paul in galatians was making it crystal clear of what this seed was about so let's read it again verse 16. go to abraham and his seed were the promises made he see it not unto seeds as of many but as of one and the thy seed which is christ let's go to verse 23 but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the fate which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our school master to bring us into christ that we might be justified by faith and after that faith is come we are no longer under a school master for year all the children of god by faith in christ jesus here we go for as many of you has been baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek there is neither born or free there is neither male nor female for you're all one in christ jesus and if you are christ then you are abraham's seed and this is the part here our ears according to the promise give the lord a shout on that oh give the lord hallelujah on that you are abraham's seed and is apparently promised and let's turn over to romans nine we want to read from seven to thirteen i'll be along with you again romans nine uh seven to thirteen find it praise the lord romans nine seven three thirteen and reads verse seven romans nine neither because they are the seed of abraham are the old children but in isaac shall i see it be called that is the which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promised accounted for the seed oh hallelujah oh glory to god the church of what the children of the promised accounted for the seed but this is the word of promise at this time will i come and say i shall have a son not only this rebecca had conceived by one even by father isaac for the children not being yet born neither haven't done good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand none of works but of him that call it it's said unto her the elder shall save the younger as it is written jacob have i love but esau have i hidden so god gave a word and that word cannot return void the elder shall save the younger because god knew that seed was in jacob the same way god know that caesar's an eu and the flesh and the scardogary and the tricks around jacob didn't stop deceive in jacob from becoming manifest and jacob burdened what was his burden to get the boot right which was the holy ghost oh give the lord some praises on that hallelujah jacob burden was considering the spirit jacob burden was concerned the bit right which is the baptism of the holy ghost he says now galatians 3 29 if he be in christ then i.e abraham's seed and is according to promise upon romans 4 16 we find that god has given us a short promise to all abraham seed and paul puts himself an all believers under that designation because he says abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on not only to narrow his definition but rather to finalize it in galatian street which we just read he as the churn of promise and promise as having to do with election or the truth of god so think about it now you are a child of promise and because your child a promise god call you out and push elijah message unto you you were ordained to receive it you couldn't miss it for nothing now this message it has to become flesh in you and i that you become the living word hope you see is him this is not a message just to be discussed and shared and talked what the reality is this bride will become the manifested reality of godly this bride will become god's hand of vengeance in the earth this bride will become voice god's voice or eyes on the earth let me just finish off here now then he goes on to say not only narrowed on this definition but rather to finalize it in galatians 3 he identified his seed single with jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promised as having to do with election or the chosen of god that is exactly what we have been saying these who are the royal seed are the elect of god are the predestinated for known of god we're in the mind of god and in his in very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decree season as each member came forth and become expressed and took his place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bright and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predecimated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god in a many-membered body whereas once god is manifested in one member in our lord jesus christ so now then here we come to our conclusion as the eternal logos to god was manifested in the sun and in jesus blood all the god fullness of the goded bodily and the eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and therefore again the title of son loved that even so we eternal on his torch and our turn became the many members spoken seed manifest in the flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called there we go we did not become seed by the reboot we were seed therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn in this this is not a shout out understand this abraham had faith before he was circumcised the circumcision was a confirmation of the faith that he had so the elect the elect was in god's stinking they rebirth don't make them seed because they are seed they can't be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to quit let me wrap up here we're going to close when god make a promise he is duty-bound to take care of that promise so god can't say the bride hasn't had a revival yet it will take them seven thunders he will suddenly promise him he can't take care of it you have to take care of it when god say when the poor of this church rises it will bring the budget he is beautiful to take care of if then god said if you stay with the gospel stay right one of these days god will pull you aside and give you something to shake the world with and show that glory he could take care he is god abraham never received the promise when he was circumcised to show that circumcision was just a type he received the promise before he was circumcised so therefore you have to see receive the word seed because before you become a manifested seed you have to receive father they receive your word thy word before they went in the upper room to be manifested seed sons they had once you receive your word from christ and you open your understanding you open your wood to them god came down to open these seals okay to bring the seed because any time you get son of man you have to look for your soul son of man is his soul and that may have son of man solomon will be revealed he brings seed so you're not looking for a son of god yet you're looking for son of man son of mine bringing seed after son of man you're seeing son of god so son of man was christ and then his son of god came back in the upper room so after son of man ministry is son of god ministry so god sent back a son again in the person of a son he sends solomon ministry which is seed ministry so that's why they have four marine lottery but it have to have the rain for the seas you can't tell me you have all these precious seeds and there's no rain for it you need the rain for the seeds you need the harvest rain to produce the crop so therefore all these years we hold in this seed you see you held that seed long enough sarah you're waiting for lottery the manifestation oh praise the lord hallelujah grieve not the holy spirit whereby you are stealing to their redemption he said no that is what the holy ghost is it's the seal of god he formed you found grace in his sight he loves you he believes you he put his seals upon you and what i see designates a finished work what is the holy ghost a sign notice that the holy ghost is a sign the holy ghost is a seal he says now and to reject it is to be cut off under people who receive it is to have finished with the world all the things of the world he said no we say i went on a railroad here and they would roll up a car when a car is loaded they go to the car the inspector if you find anything loose it will fall and break anything will be destroyed so you'll not see the car until the car is so completely packed until it's so packed and so in order that the shaking of the ride won't bother the product that's on the inside what if it is all these years god just back in that world on us and when the shaking time comes to our destination that everything is fine with us that if it's not packed right then go shake off and fall off so god making sure word on top of wood on top of wood everything is packed he said that's what the matter we don't get sealed so much we are too loose about things when the inspector comes through they inspect your life if you are not little loose about things little loose about your prayer life wow that's a big one a little loose about your prayer life little loose about that temper little loose about that tongue to talk about others he will never seal the car some duty habits some vile things some vulgarity of mine can't seal the car but when he found everything in his place the inspector when he seals it dare anybody to open that seal until that car reaches destination that is what the holy spirit is it's your assurance it's your protections it's your witness it's your seal it's your sign i'm heaven bond don't care what the devil says i'm heaven born you seal me i am glory oh the spirit of god the holy ghost what is all egos it's the spirit of christ in you oh my i'm finished so may it be that when god writes your commentary that he could say you wouldn't talk about your feelings you showed comments your mistakes your sins but he could say like he made a comment with abram staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong and faith giving glory to god i trust tonight that this would have helped you and this would strengthen you that you would launch your feet out and you could see by how we operate and the convention that just passed is evidence of that that you know when a seed break inside your soul on your heart and you could conceive something you could step out and get it done get it accomplished and uh this is our life this is our testimony a life of faith tonight this this this time of study is is is faith being applied so we are thank you grateful to god for that tonight let's let's pour our heads as we want to pray heavenly father we thank you for your presence we thank you for your mercy we thank you for these words and i pray that believers would connect with this romans four scriptures have everything in it lords and it is powerful scripture father and i pray it would help them that they would stand like abraham and recognize that you have called them you have elected them you have chosen them and you have given them precious promises peter said by these promises we can be a partaker of your divine nature have an escape the corruption that is in the world through lust and he said given all diligence and that is applied word lord that is not just uh that's unlocking on looker father that is to apply even all religions never say subtract never said divide he said add and there's something to be added add it to us lord something more something to reach out after the father and paul talk about pressing towards the mark of the high calling father me the believers realize if they don't press they'll be stagnant if they don't press they'll be like stagnant waters they'll be failing and floundering lord they have to press in order to go to higher grounds lord this world is present every day somebody is thinking up something new something how to do something or to pull something together something to offer every day some job is being made redundant every day some businesses is closing down because something better has arrived this is what is all about lord father we come into a great climax oh lord where it will take rapture and feet and and the extra oil to break through finally the people recognize that this will separate the boys from the from the men the men from the boys lord those who are called from those who are chosen that the sword to be wise virgins father those that with the extra oil and i pray tonight that all those in this room tonight will be like wise virgins they come in around this bible study may be a strengthened for them and encouragement for them like abraham a man like passion a man with feelings and shortcomings just like us he could believe god and his fate and his faith could be counted as righteousness but expressed by that fate we saw his works we saw his life he saw his his villain uh a booty and creating booty and billing crib and open up isaac all that was expressing the faith he had because he believed that even if isaac died you could raise him from the dead and that was the level of fear that abraham had and father me each one here tonight those who are sick those who are you know touch from you may they get a consciousness that you can heal them you could bless them you could deliver them you could touch them tonight by the anointed released you could heal them and break every you father commit their lies into your hands they committed a service to more into your hands in the name of jesus i ask it amen god bless you but thanks again for being here uh we have service tomorrow and that's all but is that your arrangement you want to see um i just uh god bless you all i just saw we had a prayer request for sister pierre um okay so i just want to just remember her in prayer and i don't there's any other requests as well so let's just bow our heads one more time or gracious 70 fatherhood we thank you tonight lord for your word such an encouragement and lord coming out of the convention and this time of life to see lord how we could still glean inspiration from abraham's testimony and how he lived and what he endured and through his own lord experience of staggering not uh at the promise he held on to a promise and the promise sustained him the promise kept him in his down days in his dark days it would not have been a bed of roses he would have endured what any man would endure but he staggered not at the promise so we thank you for the precious promises that your word has brought to us and law that tonight we could separate ourselves from the hustle and bustle of life and come to an accord come to an agreement come to a unity of purpose and a mission to lord to see you through your word through your scriptures and lord we are so grateful for this and lord we want to remember our sister peter tonight uh lord not feeling well and how the enemy as brother said has has his his room to play but we also have a responsibility lord as you walked in the earth and you said in your name we will cast our demons lord and when you walk the earth you heal the sick you dealt with all manner of situations and you said there's power in the church of the living god to do the same so we thank you tonight for the power lord that lord exists in the church of the living god and for lord of spirit that follows the word so we pray for sister pear that you would heal her completely from the crown of her head to the sole of her feet father may this request become lord a note of praise and if there's anyone else lord on this call tonight lord who may be feeling lord any any way that is not lord away they are supposed to feel may you heal your people may you run through the camp tonight lord and father do it in the only way you can where you can minister to people at the same time lord lord may you heal lord every brother every sister lord and not just lord physical healing not just sickness or pain or discomfort lord but may your angel visit homes and may you heal families may you heal situations may you touch marriages may you give wisdom to those that are looking for wisdom and encouragement may you lift up those that may be struggling in whatever way lord that father lord we stand tonight knowing that you are interested in the very the very simple things the little things your prophet taught us you have an interest in what goes on in our day-to-day life so we thank you lord for having that interest and we pray dear god that as we continue to press and live and endure and deal with these struggles of life lord as as a bird trapped in an egg that's breaking out of the egg lord well we are breaking out of this natural into a supernatural realm we are breaking out of lord this ordinary living into an extraordinary living lord we're breaking out of time into eternity so may we maintain that focus and as we lord gather tonight and lord the service tomorrow night and the premeeting on friday and service this sunday we'll be so careful to make sure that you are the center of our attention and our focus so we pray tonight also a special blessing on our pastor lord for lord standing and lord having this burden father and and and being able to deliver lord this encouragement to us tonight and lord for his his labor for his body of believers lord and it's so beautiful to hear him say that there's no space that someone can rent in his head for anything else but the mission the mission the task at hand so lord let us have that kind of resolve to focus on the mission the mission to look into the mirror of the world and to only see how we line up with the world lord only see law and other situations around us and under the the distresses and all the other things but to see father are we ready are we getting closer to where we should be in you are we are we doing all that we could do help us father to catch a burden for the things of god and for the kingdom of god and for the word of god may you bless your people lord may you touch your people may you minister up to your people and bless us until we meet again in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen amen god bless you saints praise the lord god bless you and thanks again for coming out we are finished mere dismiss god bless
