Bibles to say mateship 2:13 those couple of scriptures say Matthew 13 first Corinthians 13 revelation 8 revision chain Sumati the ten will read from the first bus you know the scripture already so just goes through it the same day when Jesus went Jesus out of the house and sat by the seaside and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into the ship and such and a multitude stood on the shore and his book managing sponsor them in parables saying behold a sower went forth to sow and when his sword some since fair by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up so there upon stony places where they had not much hurt of what weights they sprung up because they had not dip lest they have no deepness of earth and when the Sun was up they were scorched and because they have no root they withered away as some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up I shoved them but others fell into good ground glory and brought forth fruit some a hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirty who have ears to hear let him hear and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest down unto them in parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you - not a mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given Elisha have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he heard the app was big I to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfil the prophecies of Isaiah which said by hearing ye hear you shall hear I shall not understand I've seen you shall see I shall not see for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes their and the eyes they have that they have closed lists at any time they should see with your eyes and hear with their ears as you understand with the heart eyes should be converted and I should hear them but here we are but blessed are your eyes for a see are your ears for a here for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which hear and have not heard them hear ye therefore the parable of the service or when anyone here in the world of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the way side but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon joy with joy receiveth it yet had he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he is offended he also that received seed among the thorns is he died here at the ward and the cares of this life of this world and it is for deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful but he died received seed into the internet good ground is the same die here in the world and understanding it which also bring up fruits and bringeth forth a bringeth forth some hundredfold some sixty some thirty Amen fiscal adjust a team from us eight charity never faileth but with an abbot prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is a part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man that's my short I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth Faith Hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity Revelation chapter 8 the Salah Scripture and when he has opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour official 10 away from us 8 and the voice which I heard from heaven speak unto me again I said go attend a little book which is open at the hand of the angel president upon the sea and upon the earth and I believe he was not talking to some some just new seats I was talking to my short seats amen and I went on to the angel I said unto him give me them to book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and as I met the belly bitter but it shall be in a match sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I have eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and measures of toast our king's father we thank you once again for the reading of your word and we unlock that your spirits with brick life into the world and make it on life to us this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen god bless you you may be seated everybody feeling fine there's a

going to do but the elect a bride is in a middle part in a present tense not in the past but the future but in the present tense malfete is not fred is going to be but now that is in the present tense hallelujah he has not only done it and it's not only going to do it but he is doing it now he is doing it now hallelujah we are in the present tense of it so I'm looking for something to happen I'm looking for charity to begin to rip these scenes I'm looking for a fire to review the goddess seed has been sown and if the city had a song that revived I will surely take place so I'm looking for something it is mittens hallelujah and I come here to look for new seats because I know that a seed has gone into the ground the seed has been planted Malachi 4 planted a seed and a faithful ministry came behind a prophet watering the seed what in the seed but appreciate of the world and now is bright time this is what season is a Holy Ghost time is the bright time is that cultural time it's manifesting time hallelujah the noise is coming from the ward and correct to the believers glory be to God and God is not gonna leave you behind whatever God is doing today he's doing it with you whatever God is with it what I do today is gonna do it to the bride hallelujah this is bride time this is joy time this is Jubilee time that should not invited anybody we are should we should be happy we should present God but see what we are saying but here what we are hearing it's not a question of you have a predestination it's not a craziness yamaja accident you're here because God for Damian and please look at you before there was any devil if there was any trial the father was every temptation here we are in a back part of Alice inspired but this is such a manifesting time hallelujah Oh bless appeared and never the Lord [Applause] glory so when the sins of worship is it time to worship the Lord that seed has been planted glory but one say here is a secret the world is in the blind we're talking about adoption glory we're talking about the rapture his Saints don't take us out of here glory but a seed is already in the blind and let me tell you there's nothing that never can do about it the delicate honest crush but he cannot know this because the supernatural is already in the bride we have a reason above what it devil is saying we are opposed interpretations we are both brave battles they never did this they never did that I am NOT interested in that chair the one God is torn tell me what a because is going tell me what seat as the primary he'll that's coming to maturity Oh hallelujah [Applause] glory be to God hallelujah God is doing an antenna walk you may be seated a man has been walking are you you have the agent in you the holy spirits that change agent is in you the Holy Spirit glory the Holy Spirit Thank You Gloria I mean the change agent is in you the Prophet said that the power that will take you out from here it's not somewhere else it's already in you all you need for the perfection is already in you come on come on no wonder the Holy Spirit bless us innovation 5 growing innovation 5 does nothing about it devil in the vision file deletion files is the redeemed is the angel is drawn and the angel and the book of redemption hallelujah reverse of 5 is worship every day decision everything on earth every TV dad had eyes on praising we shall see why the book is open the service fear is broke and said to the secret to Satan he can know it he kind of a public toilet he has no idea of what is we need the service here hallelujah but there's a secret that is bigger revival in the bride glory hallelujah I believe the Holy Spirit is yet to change the bride to change it from glory to glory amen to change it to the glory of the harvest time amen the glory of grabs our fates glory to God hallelujah and he is doing it now we're in the present tense of its we're in the revival hallelujah where is a revival holding that if ever I should be where the seventh of the Reviver is in me where is Mary time for seed planted it's in me Ayana preached the body West siders they are gone long ago they have taken their books and terms they have left long ago that's if that will be able to shock and razor in this conviction will an oppression there a story crowns no they can't take this word they can only do for a little season but when we get to get real hearts where they should I Sun began to shine upon the seed I will begin to get real hot they can stand a fire they can stand the heat because parallel fiber they have got to dry up hallelujah we will return a cloud because they cannot stop persecution hallelujah they cannot go to the word test no they cast habits but this bride this similar good grounds this scene in a good cloud it's pretty isolated never to fail this break and never will just can't it's impossible for the brightest well forget about it the delica say that but if there is a liar this break can never never be like if there will be a pride with the sports with that Richard I have waited a resurrection my glory glory glory give the place you may be seated I feel good and I know you're feeling good too hallelujah this is what I tried to measure on what a devil is same measure on what your mind is saying measure I want a pledge insane this is a title measure of what God is doing Oh hallelujah praise be to God yes sir just few words amen but I'm said if we saw the notional seeds we read a denominational harvest that's exactly that's what we have done if you'd notice the word there in the Hebrew for man a little rain from a rain from a rain means so you ran and then when the spirit falls that you fall and if just and unjust good ground solid ground stony ground Westside all kinds of grounds and then you don't know who is who because everybody is a seat it received its in the other grounds glory but it depends on a kind of ground where the seed fell into because a seed on the west side is a good seed the seed or the stony ground is a good seed the seed on the stony ground is a good seed and a seed on the good ground is also a good seed but if it lays on the ground that the seed fell into this message cannot crocoduck there was not Church they can never do what about the does not want us know this message must fall into the good cloud predestined method crown and that's what we have at this witness for we are pruned annoyed him for the west side well print them item for the atone account and we'll pull it out of the Tony cloud I will present the whole team in a good crowd but this will brief for the price revival hallelujah I tell you that nervous in trouble Satan is in real trouble because the bride is color frauds by a manifestation glory now we notice here glory is that if we stood motionless seeds we just we will read the national harvest the matchless seed gives the nomination of forgiveness that's exactly right God said let the world beat up the is kind and so it is that's right oh brother the scripture is true you believe it you believe it and apply say Amen you know that's our language Anna well that which is amen praise the Lord glory to God hallelujah see we noticed that the fossil of a seed of the scream passive was branded a devil and we know it was in Genesis one they will find out and offer here in a book of Mathew data ten chapter Jesus were brand any discrepancy to his ward as being the devil anything that shows discrepancy contrary to the written word of God or put any private interpretation to it is a seed of discrepancy God will not honor it God will honor his Lord God will honor that to receive in a good ground everything was been right not some patent rights and so far wrong not 99.99 if it is god is good all the way and everything must be right the ground was the right that was there a good seed that what his spirit must be the right kind of water the right atmosphere that's why in a message you can put it with forgiveness you can put a rebuttal kindness because it said that when the charge look that determination the church has a bride vice is brotherly love when the church finds is holding assessing and when it just finds is blessed Christ then then and only then and only then she will invited all the members of the body perishes which was will found a coin we've found that coin we found that original faith come on rejoice with us [Applause] this will have the public a bride in the cyst of the harvest you may be seated I love that glory Roberta that God will not honor it God will not honor any interpretation godly not on the animals idea in the master Nagi adding a subtraction or trying to make it better you don't need to make it better living the way God said it hallelujah don't touch the siege God letter with a seed but trouble with a seed nearly the way that God said it and at the manifest is a time the manifestation will be the interpretation [Applause] going hey man hallelujah glory I love what what what shall I say last night he said the bride will be a supercharged super race but you can play around her she knows what she's talking about she was registered in change that because about dad and hospital floor with every wind of befriend ever Lenin and never ever they were able to cover the knowledge of the truth never ever thought about shorty no that's not a bride the bride will come to my show they promised said this precious Wilma sure and her reckless will be an identification which have Lord but abyss for the world but that's the work right time the freshen what bright time you can message look at mess it up hallelujah give me the Waco said it's you know be seated Oh glory hallelujah wanting God hates it so is discord among brethren God hid it discrepancies God hid it this church against this church this one against this one God let its interpretations you the walls dividing a cotton called inhibits hallelujah God hid it and the break and not identify were search because revelation candelabra toes reversal cantata by Rose its lack of Revelation that's what brings position [Applause] but when the bride comes back to the worid will come back the wolf ate one hope one Lord one baptism one Holy Spirit hallelujah and we can never be divided because when the greater labs or divided when the greater adoption divided we have a fight I call those spirits that cause division that bring the bishop multiplied hallelujah the bride is one and the bride will remain one hallelujah and related my persecute elects that's how we stand that's what the priests as a kind of seed that Malachi first shot at us it's got a set of decision or a signal determination is already the seed that we unite a body of Christ together a summary same [Applause] I thought it such back home I said we can't just let distance control this way we can't let it never do this to us that you can be free with your brother is a lie is a lie it's a lie my brother is my brother I don't care but I said patience with him maybe he didn't see today but someday he'll shed and knowledge to know what he believes and know that it is in his heart but shall attain shall cover a multitude of shame we call it our daughters we can let it ballast of seed we're gonna spend less else in was more Lord was more Lord was my lord [Applause] that's why I want to stay and identify with enemies that have lives this message and preach the true inspiration of the seven thunders I am not ashamed nobody's measure and identify with God losses this prison that reward that measure is Christ and they will appoint that people to himself but he will pointed to Christ oh come on give God praise my biggest separate us nope allocate the flavors not para comprar knows this is a bright time super time Holy Ghost I'm able free the time I got your time crowded time [Applause] regarding about adoption where we cannot simply forgive cause par with a character in satanic so if Google is his pal here there must be a bride that has some character she has identification she has some character she knows where she is standing she knows what she's talking about she's not moved by what is happening and what will happen tomorrow or what happened yesterday this will keep happening this we're going to happen but as only wanted I cannot change that's the Word of God only what they can affair that's charity everything will fail man will fail such we fell in the races we failed but shallot emails salads impossible never faileth [Applause] I don't care what happened yesterday and I'm not afraid of what will happen tomorrow but I can go for where I am standing upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it because of Hell of yesterday could not prevail and in case of hell of tomorrow will not prevail oh give it a shot man I feel good laughs I feel weak and wrong with a run over the devil we commercial together we

praise God let him say so Rory Oh hallelujah you may be seated laughs you know this is harvest time what you sow you will reap that's a law of reproduction every seat after its kind I'm gonna bomb say that's why I'm so careful of the kind of siege I saw was another water will surely fall upon it people do things I don't know what they're doing they thought that doing that brother and they thought they are doing that sister or that minister or that church but that doesn't know they are sowing seed and they will surely reap what they saw but as seeds we appreciate in this condition is a seed in a cloud that's where that market is that's where the instrument is flowing that's where the part of God is changing people's lives changing people's lives make a drunkard I've watched him I've taught him descent and I don't care what you wanted for your cup that is written but I want to speak to you by the time you live this transition you will never be the same the point is here the place from
