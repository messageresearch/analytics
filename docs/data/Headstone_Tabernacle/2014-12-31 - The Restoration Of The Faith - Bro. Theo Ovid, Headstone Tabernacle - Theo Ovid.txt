hallelujah it's good to be here tonight oh praise God I feel revived I feel charged I'm under great expectation you don't know how I feel tonight I feel we on the verge of the greatest Vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever seen what you dream about what you taught about your family being delivered your loved ones being restored all what you have in heart your heart's desire God is about to fulfill it your cup going to run over your cup going to run over you're going to have joy you're going to have peace you're going to have a fire Revival in your soul do you believe that tonight oh hallelujah oh praise the name of the Lord I'm burning tonight may be see I'm burning Hallelujah I'm burning tonight my soul is on fire my hands is on fire my feet is on fire there's fire in God I at the drink last night fire fire could burn the drinking desire out of you tonight I give we do drugs yesterday fire fire cleansing fire Holy Fire purifying fire our God is a consuming fire oh he transform he changes oh hallelujah oh glory to God oh glory to God hallelujah I don't believe in fixing anyone in concrete I don't believe in that sense of permanence that people have to stay as they are I always believe once there is hope once there is possibility and I'll tell you why there was a man named Abraham you may be see was a old man he couldn't have any children his wife was Barren and the Bible said against hope he believ in hope when there was no hope when the doctor would have turned his back on that man the Bible said he believed God that's the difference when you come to the spot when everything seems to be failing around you and you choose to believe God for your deliverance to believe God for your healing to believe God for your breakthrough to believe God for your Revival my God I see old people could get revived I see old Eagles come back young again I don't care if you up I don't care if in a wheelchair tonight God is able to raise you up I'm here to declare tonight that he's the same yesterday today and forever oh you may be what you what you're seeing is the effect of inspiration rain you heard what I said it have teaching rain and it have inspiration reain inspiration rain is when the unction come to give the man of God the words to speak to the people of God you know who you are you are God's people you have to hear words from him tonight you didn't come to hear from man you come to see a dead man you come to see a man get out of the way and to see the Holy Ghost take a hold of a man make him walk where he didn't think he was going to walk make him say what he didn't think he will say that's when you could see God speaking to your life [Applause] what you're about to witness the message will have not seen Hallelujah I want to say it again what you about to witness the message world has not seen we are now about to break into our season now listen carefully you may be seated before we before we read the scripture Jesus from age 12 to 1 under silence under the teaching of the word no manifestation under the ministry of the word learning the scriptures he came to the spot where he was led by the spirit into the temple that day and Jesus said season change because the spirit is now upon me and when the spirit comes upon you that is to fulfill your scripture I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you after 40 plus years of the ministry of the word of all the teachings of all the scripture I am prophesying the spirit has to come upon you I want to hear a bigger shout than that do you believe that tonight don't even say you're not worthy don't even say you did this or you did that I am not talking about what you have done I am talking about what the spirit is about to do and the spirit is about to come wo upon you [Music] you may be seated like some of you may be not getting it when the spirit Came Upon Samson he he took a little a Jawbone and beat down a thousand men with helmet when the spirit come you ever hear when the spirit of the Lord come upon my heart I will dance like David dance you understand when the spirit come what the spirit does the Spirit doesn't come to try to explain this explain that when the season has come it's time for manifestation it's time for Vindication time for confirmation time for your prayer to be answered we're going to read the scripture in a few minutes you may be seated 400 years living under prophecy deliverer coming deliver coming they could open scripture and show the people God said so God said so but when the spirit came down and God came down and he said I come down to deliver it wasn't no prophecy now it was he here present tense to do what is promised to do what he said Oh Glory to God if you know what God said to you this should be the most exciting time of your life if that devil tell you A big boo before you came inside of here you going to leave here and tell him a biger boo when you get out of here because God is about to confirm the word in your life let's all stand you want to turn to Malachi chapter 4 and Joel chapter 2 Malachi 4 vers 5 and 6 says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord amen and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers least I come and smite the Earth with a curse and from Joel chapter 2 we want to read Hallelujah Glory read verse 21 fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things be not afraid he beast of the field for the passive of the Wilderness do spring for the tree bear it of fruit the Fig Tree and the Vine to yield their strength be glad then e tan of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given to you the for marine moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the flow shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I'll restore to you the years the Lucas had eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the Palmer worm myig great Army which I sent among you and he shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that are death wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and he shall know that I am in the midst of Israel that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughter shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon my handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and the Earth blood and Fire pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness the moon into blood before the great and terity of the Lord let us pray father we thank you that you have promises for the bride elect before the great and terrible day of the Lord father when you come down tonight and begin to manifest your promises pour out your spirit upon your people we are needy and we are wait upon you in Jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated praise God what have a title the restoration of the faith and I have a inspiration the promis Holy Ghost baptism to the bride oh blessed be the name of the lordu the promised Holy Ghost baptism to the bride now but Branham brought one message one inspiration and we are all in it it is an inspiration of Seven Seas and seven tunders to prepare the people to leave this earth to prepare people to get the extra oil to get ready to be as the wise virgins amen do you believe that yes sir now there can be no real faith without manifestation because works is Faith expressed so when we speak about restoration of the faith it cannot be without manifestation because works is evidence of faith if you have faith you will have a manifestation to express the Fai that you say that you have isn't that right and the prophet said there have been no manifestation of God to stir the bride so what he is saying is that Faith have to come forward to produce a manifestation of God and that manifestation is what will awake stir excite Insight the bride in other words it can't be Revelation only teaching only it's got to be power and demonstration of the spirit so when we talk about the restoration of the faith we are speaking about the restoration of Power with signs wonders and miracles that is what we are talking about could we give the Lord a shout of Praise And there have been an absence in this message of that power but Joel said I am going to restore I'm not hearing you tonight all the years that it was absent all the years you didn't see it and taste it and experience it I am going to restore and my people shall be satisfied my people they're going to praise me my people shall not be ashamed oh Hallelujah are you with me tonight what is he saying you'll be redeemed from your sin from your past from your failures from your mistakes you'll be justified all way you're feeling condemn God promis to apply blood upon your life God promis to look at you as if you never did it never did it God promis to justify you not just forgive you come on now help me somebody help me somebody I'm excited now I'm not talking about forgiveness I am talking about justification as if you never did it you can't sit there and believe that you got to shout you got to Rejoice my people my people he separated from other people he said my people my very own people the called by my name my people Mrs Jesus come on Oh Glory Give the Lord a shout my people you know who you are when you hear my people you better say Amen you better shout like how John shout hallelujah I like how God to talk I call you by name before your mother conceive you before your mother had you I ordain you to be a profit into the nation before she even know she pregnant orain the seed to come forth nothing will stop the mystery of who you are from unfolding so therefore brother B said there have be no manifestation of God Amen to stir the bride it will take those seven tunders to produce it to produce what to produce a manifestation not Revelation only but a manifestation of God to stir the bride because you are not really bride yet until you come into an experience with your mate your husband with Charity with the Holy Ghost is only then you get connected with your husband his wife have made herself ready so God want to contact you God want to touch you God want to connect with you oh Hallelujah Glory do you believe that so you must have an experience with the person of the Holy Ghost isn't that right the person of Christ so the calling out time which we have had for 50 plus years of teaching and Revelation is about to change the season is going to change right before your eyes the time of the ministry of the spirit the supernat natural and omnipotent speaking even sin being called out it will be changed right in front of your eye Power is coming to block out the spirit of man that's right you see when Peter James and John saw Jesus with that Glory around him they said let us make three Tabernacles and the power shut them up the power said shut up here ye him don't come with your human IC thought don't try to build no Tabernacle to make no man no glory at the end of it Christ only Christ only Jesus only not even fivefold not pastor and evangelist and Prophet no Jesus only when they look there was only Jesus No Moses no Elight and not Jesus only have to come back to Jesus only it got to come back to Jesus Jus only Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever so power I believe that the time has come for the power of God to follow the word the power is going to change you there's got to come a resurrection power among the bride isn't that right and the first thing that power going to lead to is to the Cross where you are crucified with Christ oh give the Lord some praises oh hallelujah hallelujah not not power to show off not power to say I am right you are wrong no power to die Oh Glory to God because that is where Jesus conquered Jesus didn't conquered casting no Devils he didn't conquer raising and Healing The Sick that was the easy PA the path where he conquered is when it looked like nothing happening when he on the cross when he says finish oh Hallelujah it didn't look all the dramatic it was painful but it was there he conquered in suffering that's right in crucifixion in price being paid friends this gospel has to become real if Christ suffered so must we if he went through we got to go through also you you just have to bless God to escape the terrible day of the Lord but before that terrible day come a day of Darkness gloess a day of Blackness a day that you wouldn't even want to think about before that day come he promises to send Elijah the prophet and he had a job to do he's going to turn not the head of the people back to the faith of the fathers no not not the head he going to turn the heart somebody say heart yes I want heart God want heart your heart that's the real you your heart from the abundance of the heart the mouth speak when your heart turn back you speak where your heart is at oh you have some powerful things to say tonight Hallelujah I'll say a little hint to you the Holy Ghost cannot behave in one man and misbehave in another because God behavior is his person Hallelujah so when God say turn your heart back to the faith that's just what he means that's right your heart not not not you had to go to some church your heart you see the devil is fighting watch the rock of Revelation to the individual so what the devil introduced the people to to church and group so the people end up with group [Applause] think but once you catch that the Father in Heaven he alone is the reveal then that frees you from group church group think group Revelation group interpretation men's ideas then you would realize God will have young Sons older Sons and different kind of sons no it's it's sons in other words a son of God serving God for the last 30 years is same as a son just came in 5 minutes ago somebody drunk just give the heart of the Lord 3 minutes ago they are just as much sun as somebody 40 years coming to church you see the problem is your human IC realm where you seeing who spiritual who more holy who more righteous but when God bring his binoculars he said all have sinned and if you have sinned you're born in it in other words you're born in it you do it so stop playing righteous we will expose you tonight because there is none righteous no not one shake somebody hand and tell them there is UN [Applause] righteous oh you could give the Lord a shout now watch I was a Catholic but my name was in the I was even my acolyte that a serving Catholic but God called me the whole family stayed but God called me and I made a choice to give up my sins and repent and get baptized in Jesus [Applause] name next year going to be 40 years since I made that choice and a feeling a feeling just as strong as when I first started out don't let the gray hair bother you because it's not bothering me I just as strong my soul on fire I'm under expectation I ain't looking to die now I'm looking to start to live because Jesus said I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly I want the Abundant Life I want God's joy am M trying [Applause] circumstances so all of you who want to express your dose of tiredness because you're waiting long cut it out because he come down according to first Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself already come down I have news for you shocking news oh shocking news yes you see but the BAM says the seven angels come from eternity to gather up the scattered word to tie back into the word to bring down the Holy Ghost so they brought down the Holy Ghost but we wasn't ready yet for the Holy Ghost in that measure so the Holy Ghost came down as the word because Jesus said the words that I speak they are spirit and they are life so God take his spirit and hide it as the word which is the revelation of the son of man the sore of the seed so we had us to live under the anointing of the ministry of the word to be seated down because the Holy Ghost have to fall in such a way upon planted W that it will restore that will be the restoration of the faith watch this how could the faith be restored and we can't do what Peter did [Music] Peter didn't have Seven Seals seven Church ages all the Mysteries but he had the faith you see the faith is Christ the Holy Ghost in you the person not just the baptism but the added life so that is why Peter could say Silver and Gold Have I None I have something and I could release it I have it I could give it he actually had the germ of [Applause] God resident in him and because the gym was in him he could speak for other Sons and bring them into manifestation what Adam was supposed to do Adam was to bring Representatives like him that's right but when man fell it went into the sex way instead of spoken word which was word and spirit so when Jesus came his first message was you must be born again of word and spirit amen so it had to bring back word in order for you to get back to Spirit but the word was lost so God s a prophet to restore the word that was lost so we could come back the word and spirit so before the appointed time comes he had was to have the calling out time which you in right now so even though people want to cut people off and to people off God's still calling that's right whosoever will come come quickly spirit in the bright sck come come come take the word come hold the ticket come the ticket is the token the ticket is the word when you buy a bus ticket the D the conductor don't want to see your money he want to see the ticket if you don't have a ticket he say go and byy go and get some oil and then come back the bus is ready to go everybody's in line have a ticket you have your money you could have a million dollars he is authorized only to take the ticket you said conductor hold $100 bill he said no ticket where do you get it you have to go to the count and buy it and while they went to buy the bus take off don't be caught like that you want your ticket your ticket is evidence you pay a [Music] price I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you so when you see a man with the power of God you know that man paid a [Applause] price amen are you with me yes amen remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts The Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it that's prophecy what preacher you got to be giving me the church yes that Satan visiting he not visiting the panyard and theal T no he visiting the church to defile it why because he understand that if we get things in order the power of God going to be here to destroy his works his imps and his demons so he want to affect and inflict and mess up the church to affect the power from flowing freely in other words nobody supposed to walk in here sick and stay sick I want to declare that tonight I want to say a certain way tonight nobody should walk in this building sick and walk back out shck tonight we rejecting that we are saying these signs shall follow them that [Applause] believe brother over you really expecting Miracles tonight yes you expecting a supernatural tonight yes you expecting the Holy Ghost Fire to fall tonight yes why why because Joel said it shall come to pass afterwards that I without asking the bishop permission I without consulting the ministers Association I will pour out my spirit come on now come on now come on now come on now you might be seated Hall let me challenge your face a little bit when Saul was messing up Saul was King Saul start off nice he's anointed he's inspired prophesying he's speaking as king and so he start to screw up on M up God say I had enough of that go and anoint one of Jesse Sons King over Israel that son called David he didn't ask for anointing he wasn't praying Lord anoint me King Lord I feel in kingish Lord could you make me a King David was only seen about sheep when God say anoint him that's God's business that's God's choice that if was smoking Tampe that have to do with [Music] it do you understand what we talking about God said anoint that man [Applause] king whether he is ready or not that I'm to do with it whether he's small that I'm not to do with it whether he is short that I'm do with it whether he is Young that I'm not do with it it's the desire of God so when God is about to release your family you didn't hear me tonight when God is about to release you from the bondage of your sickness that is not your desire that's God's desire Rejoice Rejoice because God's desire is about to be revealed look you may be seated look look look Hanah Baron Hana Baron woman mocking her making mockery of her because she can't produce a child and she's in the temple grumbling groaning travailing she had a choice to be be hateful she had a choice to be angry she had a choice to give them back good and make a good argument but she choose to bring a problem to God she chose to weep before God and God saw the groaning God saw the travailing and God say I'm not going to just bless you I'm going to bless you with a prophet I'm going to bless you with a man of God I've heard the groanings and the cries of my people you see God have to move on your heart Hallelujah to break you out this humanistic realm the devil make sure everybody have a toy to play with Hallelujah a dolly a car something to fly Games sports he know that man have different desires so he makees sure he have options gal to make sure you pick and choose and imagine you could look around and say none of the above I choose God Moses Moses look away from all the glory of Egypt he had opportunity to be Pharaoh he had opportunity to relief them by his might of position but God get a glory for that phara say you know Moses could come and say you know you know who who release you I say unto you go and I have to go west but God will get no glory amen and God love and he deserves the glory that is why a sinner doesn't impress God and the self-righteous he does embarrass them and humiliate them that one time Jesus stand up there and watching people acting and behaving and so on and man come up and say Lord you know I just do this and I do that and do the other God I don't even miss service I don't miss church and Jesus is showing the disciples a sample of what is going in the human heart and next by name come close he say Lord have mer upon me a Sinner J say who more righteous who you think God more impressed with the man who said I'm a sinner God love honesty God live a heart that can say Lord that's why God asked Jacob what's your name I am Jacob I'm a trickster I'm a big skull I'm a smart man go say I like you yeah now you tell somebody you a smart man I don't want nothing do with you God say you you so smart you going want the birth right you you you you will do anything to get what is right and and

fire have an ignition point a point is when they going to break out so when say smoke fire yet it's only smoke you can smoke all the time you Smokey you're Smokey we don't want Smokey we need a wind to bring a breeze to blow to Get You On Fire we need you to be in oil one part in oil and the other part on fire [Applause] hallah get dead people out your business Hallelujah you going one two one two one two and somebody going one two one two one two it can't be like that H God want men on fire that's why he can't handle lukewarm it's either hot or you're cold why God say that because if you're cold you're dead if you're luk if you're on fire you're on fire but lukewarm you need a cold not dead that that kind of sickening thing make your some upset lukewarm God don't want to lukewarm praise it's better you don't praise God at all then we know you're dead then we can pray to raise the dead because when the dead raise up the dead don't stay dead the dead have to move the dead have to move the dead have to move you you can't be dead if you're not moving we know you're dead that's fine it have raising of the dead too but when the dead raise they can't just stay like that no that raising of the Dead get off your grave clothes you might be tied up at grave clothes get off your grave clothes all the old ways of the past when Lazarus comfortable loose him loose him loose him loose him and let him go loose him loose him I want the devil look at you and say pack up shop all them demons just leave that woman alone loose him loose her loose you loose loose woman do loose loose loose free free free free to praise God free to worship free to claim your healing free to be Inspire loose [Applause] them hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you see the thing about it is this as humans we feel sorry as humans we want to extend ourselves and Care in a certain way but God doesn't operate as a human does his eyes see it different and we have to go with the eyes of God that's why Jesus always looking for the seeds looking for the sun look at the sons of zebede with the fish and neck and the business and he watch them all follow me how you will interpret that business know at a boom you need your boys and this man with beard come and say follow me and the Bible said they drop their Nets Amen to follow a NAD a man who had no place no Hotel no business no salary check to write out for them he said follow me and I will make you fishes of men and that's what the gospel is about fishing for men to understand that they are going to be Sons so ignorant man fisherman can't write his name can't read called by God to follow Jesus Jesus know only man can't read can write but Jesus dropping promises upon Him same works I do shall you do also if he shall say to this mountain be move and don't doubt you could have what you say Jesus dropping Promises by Spoken Word into their Spirits into their soul and one time he released an anointing upon them he said behold I give you power and my God is start to cast out Devils they come back rejoicing saying Lord devils are rejoicing Rejoice devils are subjected ourselves to us he said don't Rejoice for that Rejoice because your names is written because he knew they don't have character yet he knew it's a taste of power to show them what is possible I want you to say a big Amen on that because many preachers have a taste of power that God only show what is possible but he must have character and character is not a gift character is a victory you have to go through stuff you have to go through [Applause] something so stop looking down and out because you fail and you fall and whatever forget that it's a good thing you fall you know how you fall and you don't have to fall again because God could Empower you tonight the power of his word and upon that the power of His Spirit don't tell me it can't happen because Samson didn't have the Holy Ghost but the spirit Came Upon him I'm not hearing you and he did something when the spirit Came Upon him Peter didn't have the Holy Ghost but he walked on water I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you even without the the Holy Ghost he was in the Supernatural Jesus he said Jesus if that is you beat me to come and Jesus said come one word come am what would make a normal man walk out a boat to walk like Jesus I'm not hearing you Jesus was walking on water and Jesus said if you be me to come just say come I ain't coming if you don't say come if you say come I'm coming amen because I know you are the [Applause] boss that is when they could really trust God that's when they can really have faith in God and Peter start to walk as he was watching Jesus of course the devil get a fight because the devil seeing potential and anytime the devil he potentially want to kill it so he whip up some waves and Peter took his eyes off of Jesus and looked on the waves and he begin to sinking but you know what I love about him you say try to make back stroke and front stro and he's a s man and he don't want how you look among my brethren he said Lord I'm seing and I kind of like that no P could swim he's a fisherman all fishermen could swim but Peter wasn't taking no risk why take risk and Jesus is there yeah yeah you could swim but Jesus he could pull you up pull you out oh glory to godall so we talking about restoring the faith right one time J was in the boat he labored he preached and bar say real a preaching Service is like two days hard labor J was so tired he was in deep Sleep storm rocking devil see opportunity sink him now you think the devil wouldn't sink you if you get a chance I'll give shout about you know what Angels fighting for you some of you some of you are training to say Amen on that you know we're going to need Spirit realm the angel and Camp around those that you know much acents the Lord protect you from you know situations God breaks you from you have nothing to do with that Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah understand this it's forces from above and forces from below and you are in between and that God has to fight for [Applause] you when you think it's bad it could have been worse Jesus in the boat he's tired devil Ki a storm the boat is rocking after a while the disciples recognize they cannot handle it on their own let's wake Jesus wake him he's sleeping he's not dead he's only sleeping he's only in the silence he's not dead he's only sleeping they wake Jesus Jesus got up rebuked the storm and say oh ye of little faith what is he saying brother the Gerome if you had Faith you was going to speak to that storm so you got to know something you got to know who God is you got to know who you are and you got to know who the is who God is is God is in me right here and the faith is inside of you you got to know who you are that you are a son just like me I am the firstborn among many Brethren so I want you to know that you have the potential to do what I did so he could tell them oh ye of little faith and then you got to know who kicking up that storm because the Bible said the winds were contrary and when sometimes the winds in your life is blow contrary you didn't ask for the wind you didn't do something and that's why the wind come you didn't do sin and the wind come sometime the winds just blow contrary but he's the god of the contrary wind he could handle that contrary wind Don't Be Afraid when the wind blow contrary in your life or around your life from tonight you're going to begin to speak to the storm you're going to speak for your children stop ning them stop brutalizing them oh speak prophesy over them tell them you going be delivered tell them you will come out of it tell them you're going to be free speak Faith Speak Life speak the [Applause] word I want to challenge you tonight Speak Life I look if they wearing hot pants Min skpt speak the word speak their Deliverance speak their Victory speak

is going to break I feel it tonight I feel it in my spirit I feel it in my soul demons upon your son but those demons cannot stay there all the time we sering them notice we serving them notice Oh Glory to God I am learning more and more of the power of prayer before coming I pray that God protect everyone coming to this service both coming and when they going also on the road I recognize certain things you have to speak are certain things you must pray don't just leave it to chance don't leave it just to work out anyhow let your prayer be an arrow let your prayer be something sent come on now come on now don't just leave your children shoot the AR of God at their life oh Hallelujah but I'm talk about a slingshot of prayer to release release it for your family release it for your children sometime you don't even understand what they're going through and the demons that they're battling but if you groan and moan oh Hallelujah something have to break Daniel was groaning and moaning oh Hallelujah he was groaning a long time and Gabriel was coming through Gabriel was fighting demons because Daniel was praying if Daniel stop praying the angel stop coming you got to understand the angel is on his way when you begin to pray the angel is on his way when you pray keep on praying your deliverance is on its way your pray is on its where we are not just speaking words we are speaking life [Applause] brother bham said you may be seated when the church know what she is what she stands for and then she that she can do the Greater Works are we moving to that time now where we have the confidence as sons and our heart don't condemn us that's right and we believe that the hour has come that God could trust us with something more you see it's not a matter of the church it's a matter God trusting you to give you something more because when God see the kind of man you are he could call you aside and give you something that the world will know God is with you that's what the prophet said this is the age where God calling man aside understand this we are out of the church ages right that's right the church ages set up systems of church like what we have here this is leftovers notice after the Pentecost Peter going here is not the church coming together and saying you know I mean what we doing today what we moving no Peter doing normal stuff heal the

nothing like him and your beauty is only temporary check yourself out 45 years from now let's continue oh give the Lord some praise His people give the Lord some praise His People oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God so all you have is the time to do what God want you to do that's all we have because there's going to come A Midnight Cry go you out to meet him the faith has to be restored in manifestation and demonstration who is going to preach it I'm going to preach it until it materializes I'm going to stay here until there is signs until there is wonders until his miracles until the start to walk and the blind start to see that's my job that's your job in the Church of the Living God tonight lays the power all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he pours into the church I am convinced the word is in me the word is in you but we want [Applause] water we want the rain you may be seated but we have a prophecies for you tonight God told Joel it shall come to pass I will pour out the rain the former rain and the Latin rain in the first month oh my God and your FS shall be overflow with oil and wine Oh Glory to God the it going to overflow we talking about a overflow a overflow of spirit a overflow of power overflow of the anointing it's going to overflow my Jesus my my my God my God David said my cup run it over overflow press down running over when God pour you want to press it down and it going to pour down upon you and they going to run over David got the oil running down Aon got to be running down you got to get the oil running down your enemy going to see it because he going to be a table for you and the presence of your enemies your enemy have to see it God will bring them out just in time to see it they have to see it because you are the Son of God you are the daughter of God they have to see it give them a chance to laugh you may be SE give them a chance to laugh at your condition at your sick condition blind batim you know the story am he was begging every day and that day nobody on the street he want to know what what happening I'm getting no nobody to support me and then somebody said Jesus is on the next rate Lord have mercy upon me he began to cry out not sick out not depressed out not sad out because Jesus is not there near him he begin to cry out cry out watch that crying out was a symbolism of the faith inside of him because Jesus couldn't hear his cry literally but that faith in his soul hit heaven and Heaven touched Jesus and Jesus couldn't help it he has to walk wherever fate is wherever faith is Power is coming and seven tunders give faith and Faith with leaders to power and power will take us to the promise to manifest the promise and the Bible is the road map of God's power and Faith must lead how many could sh in that one say it again brother brother R said that the road map you may be seated is the Bible and Faith leads you to power and power leads you to the promise you see we're born in sin shape iniquity so we born defeated so we have nothing to boast about our boasting is in the blood our boast is in the C cross because Jesus Come To Die to redeem us and the word to redeem is to bring us back so he didn't come to do a halfway job I come to redeem them but I I can't make now because things hot boy things really pressure no he released the Redemption by releasing the book it was the book of redemption now if the book is sealed you don't know for sure you're there because your name is sealed up but once that book is unsealed you have the opportunity to connect listen to who you really are you thought you was a sinner you thought it was a Baptist and Methodist jewi Witness Catholic you thought that but when the book open then you recognize that you are son and daughter of God not of your mother and father your mother only father only give you physical characteristics but you are the physical manifestation of the attribute that you are in God so God put a germ in you in the Dust In Your Dust the devil can't see that germ because he don't have discernment of germ of God and addition the Bible said the word alone is a discerner of the thoughts am and intense of the heart so the heart is uh no trespasses please for the devil and no trespass sign over your heart so the devil can come and trespass what God have as a hidden Mystery inside of you which is the germ now because it's inside of you Jesus could plainly say all that the father hath given me will come [Applause] Jesus is not in pain tonight oh God you sure he go come no no he's not in that all the father not now giving me hat given me past tense you're not now [Applause] saved you're getting a revelation of the blood that bought you but God put your gym in the book and when we preach the word we are preaching your name that is why you could Shout at the word that is why you can get excited because when you hear the word yes you have your struggle in your flesh yes you have battles in your mind you're supposed to have the battle if you have no back for something [Applause] wrong so God allow the loosen spirit Spirit the god up the Loose Ends the spirit people that loosen their life you see because the foolish versions are really free thinkers you know some people don't like discipline right don't like correction they want to do their own thing if you talk to them and correct them they get veex they don't like you say you like how you say it they don't like what you say they don't like this free thinkers but God have a pattern a sress work with a pattern a sress can just watch you and say okay you're looking like size 18 give me the cloth give my my scissors let me go you know don't go back there that is trouble somebody say okay just give me the cloth and give me the scissors I get you no measurement no pattern no nothing that's dangerous she could give you a sack and you had a tire Rob WR it so so so so so you just don't do that well God have a pattern there it is so when God scissors come out God can say oh you don't like it so how you how you like it God himself can't do that because I will make him not God he said I am God and I change not my pattern change not it's Faith first virtue second knowledge third gain Temperance D patience then you now coming to Godliness then you have to have forgiveness because faith is based [Applause] on wory wory now watch the devil know faith is based upon forgiveness because that's what being preached so his job is to make sure it have some solid ODS and some concrete Grudge long standing for years Family Feud for years and the devil tell them go to church but do not forgive at all say Amen say Amen say hallelujah say Glory Glory Glory raise your hand raise hand and wave wave wave wave but when you go home don't forgive because if you only forgive God will come down I can't afford that so have church Wars this pastor against that Pastor this believer against that believer husband fighting with wife why fighting with children dog fighting with cat everybody fighting no forgiveness because once forgiveness start to be effective you put yourself in a position to be like God because he smiles on the just and on the unjust and the rain just falls on the tomatic tree and the marijuana [Applause] tree don't play self-righteous today I am fallen on no marijana at you no ganja crop only corn tomatoes and melonen and watermelon what the farmers like I go move that way the rain don't talk that way Ru just fall and every seed bring forth after its and if there is a son of God's seed sewn in your heart and that rainfall it's got to bring forth after it kind a god kind a Godly kind a kind of holy kind a righteous kind every seed bring forth so let the devil do his du we got to do our DU oh Hallelujah and I'm telling you may be seated let me drop this on you it will come to a spot you can't help it you can't help manifest God you you can't help heal the sick you you can't help speak the word you can't help walk by the spirit you can't walk you can't help being led by the spirit that is just how you are that is just what you do that is just how you live you live by the spirit you talk by the spirit you walk by faith you talk by faith You Preach by faith you testify by faith you live by that [Applause] F but BR walk into conventions already in 5 minutes the Holy Spirit start to move and people start to walk out the wheelchair amen he didn't have to preach he just walked and the angel walking with him are we going to return to that yes sir we call it the return to the days of the Apostles oh God they're going to be Apostles come forth power come forth man of God come forth like you have never seen before the Pentecost going to be astonished oh Hallelujah this world going to be astonished when the power of God become activated in the sons of God right now God preparing the cell phone oh Hallelujah the SIM

system Oh Glory to God we are just waiting to be activated that we can make a phone call to heaven and said send down the charity the power just [Applause] now let me let me shake you a little bit God can't move right except we have you to move through that's a big one that's a big one yes that's a big one in other words he he looking for your hands because he want to move he looking for your mouth looking for your eyes he's got to put on your shoes god need a body to work in and the devil need a body to work through come on now come on now and if the devil could anoint these people to do what they do and live what they live how much more the Holy Ghost could come upon Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory to God how much more Oh Glory to God I'm going to close Oh Glory to God it's almost midnight but listen to this God sent a prophet before the Dreadful day of the Lord what we are preaching is what is before the Dreadful day of the Lord am Elias has already come and he dropped the message and turned his back and went home knowing it will fall in the hands of the predestinated you could miss it if you try I challenge you from today look away from your problems as problems and see your problem as opportunity for God to come down and display his glory god made the baron to bear fruitfully God made the desert to bloom and Blossom in the wilderness God is God Almighty he loves when there's a golad to bring forth David the issue is not golad the issue is where is David Hallelujah Jordan is not the problem is if we have faith to put our feet in Jordan and
