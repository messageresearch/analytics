[18:23] we thank you for
[18:25] go. We thank you for evening
[18:28] light. Lord, may you reveal yourself
[18:31] this
[18:31] day. May you anoint your people in a
[18:34] special way. May the fire of God fall
[18:38] upon them. Father, may you walk out the
[18:41] pages of this Bible and may you be
[18:43] glorified in our midst. We wait on you
[18:46] in Jesus name. Amen. Before you have
[18:49] your seat, just greet somebody in Jesus
[18:50] name.
[18:53] [Music]
[19:05] [Music]
[19:20] Oh my. You have your

[19:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes,
[19:44] Lord. Glory. Hallelujah. You're here to
[19:48] worship. Whether he gave it to you or he
[19:50] don't give it to you. What you ask him
[19:52] for, that doesn't matter. You're here to
[19:55] worship. Whether he answer your prayer
[19:57] or he doesn't answer your prayer,
[19:59] doesn't matter. You're here to
[20:02] worship. Amen.
[20:05] bow down.
[20:08] Hallelujah. Glory to
[20:10] God. Glory to
[20:13] God. Thank you, Jesus. This
[20:18] [Music]
[20:19] season, my my
[20:22] my to come into an atmosphere, to come
[20:26] into his presence is the greatest thing
[20:28] that could happen to you.
[20:33] We think so much about our problems, our
[20:35] challenges, our situation and less on
[20:39] his power, presence,
[20:42] omnipotence. Amen. Look at Moses.
[20:47] The Red Sea in front of him.
[20:50] Two mountains on both sides. That's
[20:52] right. Pharaoh is coming from a
[20:55] distance.
[20:57] Pharaoh. Pharaoh didn't instantly appear
[20:59] behind them. Amen. They seeing dust.
[21:02] They hearing a noise. They thinking it's
[21:05] some desert storm. Or when they look,
[21:07] they see chariots.
[21:09] With horsemen, with spears, what are you
[21:12] going to do when the odds are against
[21:15] you? What are you going to do when your
[21:18] back is against the wall? What are you
[21:22] going to do where it seems like no way
[21:25] out? But there is a God
[21:29] that could make a way where there is no
[21:34] way.
[21:38] [Applause]
[21:41] So when you know that what you're
[21:43] supposed to do when you come into his
[21:46] presence, what you're supposed to do
[21:49] when you get into his presence, not
[21:52] praise him, not praise him, not give him
[21:56] glory, things bad, but it could have
[21:59] been worse. Okay, praise you people.
[22:08] Hallelujah. I almost lost my
[22:12] mind, but I'm still
[22:14] here. I almost gave up, but I'm still
[22:19] here. I almost let go, but I'm still
[22:24] here. Oh, give him
[22:26] glory. Give him
[22:29] praise. Oh,
[22:31] hallelujah. You're my God. You're my
[22:34] God. You're my God. Hallelujah.
[22:38] Hallelujah.
[22:39] Hallelujah. Yes,
[22:41] Lord. Yes,
[22:43] Lord. Yes, Lord. Oh, we give God a shout
[22:48] in the house. Shout
[22:52] hallelujah. We never shout
[22:54] before. Shout
[22:57] hallelujah. Glory be to God. Oh, let the
[23:01] worshippers
[23:03] arise. Let the sons and the
[23:06] daughters sing
[23:08] hallelujah. Give the Lord some
[23:16] glory. Oh,
[23:18] glory. You may be
[23:20] seated. Well, greetings in the precious
[23:23] name of
[23:24] Jesus. And it's so good to be in God's
[23:27] presence.
[23:29] I don't know what I will do without his
[23:31] presence.
[23:34] Oh my.
[23:37] It's a good day to be alive.
[23:39] It's a good day to be in the house of
[23:41] God.
[23:42] Amen. May God bless you and uh this
[23:46] coming week I'll be leaving brother
[23:48] Terren and brother Kangi will be
[23:51] believing for Kentucky. Have some
[23:54] meetings across there. We do solicit
[23:56] your sincere prayer that God blessing
[23:59] and God leadership and
[24:01] anointing will be upon our
[24:04] lives today. I'm not the speaker that
[24:07] Isaac is. You appreciate him.
[24:12] Trust God bless him and use him. And
[24:15] that's what we're looking for. For God
[24:17] to come down and inspire his word to do
[24:21] things that we didn't expect. Amen.
[24:24] Amen. Amen. That's how you see God. When
[24:28] you're human run out, when what you can
[24:31] do and when you could hit that failure
[24:33] bump and you fall flat in your face or
[24:36] flat in your back, either way is a fall.
[24:40] Face or back. But when you come through,
[24:43] you know God,
[24:45] he's real.
[24:47] He's alive. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[24:50] Amen. So I want to encourage you this
[24:54] morning. I'll share a few things just
[24:56] before Isaac comes
[24:57] on that the emphasis you have to begin
[25:00] to see is meeting God. Amen. Your
[25:03] encounter with God. Amen. The reality of
[25:07] his presence and power, what he could do
[25:09] for you. Because the more you focus on
[25:11] the problem and the situation to me is
[25:14] the more depress depressing it is. The
[25:17] Bible say gross darkness cover the
[25:19] earth.
[25:20] cross darkness cover the people. That's
[25:23] not very exciting. That's not very
[25:26] inspirational. But yet he said arise
[25:31] and shine
[25:34] for thy light is come and the glory
[25:37] shall be seen upon you, risen upon you.
[25:42] And in prayer meeting on Thursday night,
[25:44] I felt as I begin to pray and before we
[25:46] exalt in that prayer meeting, I felt
[25:48] almost as in the spirit realm that we in
[25:50] a cave like there's gross darkness
[25:53] outside. I felt like if there was a
[25:55] lamp, like if we under lamp light, like
[25:58] if we hiding from the enemy, like if we
[26:00] secure, like if we covered and I say,
[26:03] but that is how it really is. You
[26:06] understand that we are minority. Amen.
[26:09] On the earth. Yes. You recognize there's
[26:11] darkness everywhere. You recognize
[26:14] everybody going to worship the beast
[26:16] system because they want the power of
[26:18] group. They want the power of
[26:19] organization. They want the church
[26:21] power, not the individual power with
[26:25] God.
[26:27] Do you understand that devil is fighting
[26:29] the individual power with God? But I
[26:31] kindly share something with me something
[26:33] the Pope Francis, Mr. Francis said in
[26:35] 2014. He says a dangerous thing to try
[26:37] to have a personal relationship with
[26:39] Jesus Christ.
[26:42] He said it should have no freelancing.
[26:44] You have to come through the church.
[26:50] So not even the the pope wanted to
[26:52] really get in contact with Jesus. He he
[26:54] wanted to come through him the church
[26:56] system. But we find out last week that
[26:59] when the veil was rent, God tore it from
[27:02] the top to the bottom to make sure you
[27:05] are aware that you have access and you
[27:08] don't have to pass through some man and
[27:10] have no man impose himself on you. You
[27:13] have to get a personal contact with the
[27:16] pillar of fire because God have no
[27:19] grandchildren in our time zone. This
[27:22] human time is have children and
[27:24] grandchildren and great grandchildren.
[27:26] But God don't have that. A baby is a son
[27:30] or a baby is a daughter. They just get
[27:33] big yet. But God only have sons and
[27:36] daughters in every age. He don't have no
[27:39] grandchildren to shake and pamper. It's
[27:41] only sons and daughters being loosed on
[27:44] the earth. And God going to release the
[27:46] final lot, the final set. But this set
[27:51] going to produce the manifestation of
[27:53] the sons of God. Come on now. Glory to
[27:57] God. Hallelujah.
[27:59] [Applause]
[28:01] God have no grandchildren. So that why
[28:03] God have no you had to talk to your
[28:05] mother or your grandmother before you
[28:06] talk to him.
[28:09] Soon as you're ready, he ready to talk.
[28:11] Look at little Samuel. Samuel was a
[28:12] small boy. Yes, sir. And God begin to
[28:14] deal with him because Eli was playing
[28:17] the fool. Eli was out of order. Eli was
[28:20] blind and old. And his son was doing
[28:22] wickedness in the temple of God. And God
[28:25] had to anoint a little child and put
[28:27] words in his mouth and anoint him as a
[28:30] prophet because that child came under
[28:33] travail from a barren mother. Hannah was
[28:36] barren and she was travailing asking God
[28:40] to take away her reproach. Are you
[28:42] barren in spirit? You need virtue and
[28:46] knowledge. You need temperance and
[28:48] patience. You need godliness. You need
[28:51] live voices. You need the thunder to
[28:53] shake the devil. Then it's time to
[28:55] groan. It's time to travail. It's time
[28:59] to ask God to take away the
[29:02] [Applause]
[29:07] reproach. You may be seated because when
[29:10] the people come to see Jesus, we can't
[29:13] show them the building.
[29:16] When the people come to see Jesus, you
[29:17] got to show them the pastor. They have
[29:19] to see Jesus.
[29:24] Jesus walking,
[29:26] Jesus talking. Jesus living.
[29:32] But Satan met Jesus before.
[29:35] And if you meet him again, you must know
[29:36] Jesus.
[29:38] That's why them demons say, "Paul, I
[29:40] know. Peter, I know, but who are you?"
[29:42] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. I know what these
[29:44] guys had.
[29:46] Amen. Bible talk about the ministry of
[29:48] Jesus Christ, not ministries of Jesus
[29:51] Christ. It only have
[29:57] one ministry.
[29:59] So it can't be a man in have a ministry,
[30:01] next man ministry, and next man in
[30:02] ministry and ministry ministry. No, no.
[30:04] That dear ministries, but the ministry
[30:06] of Jesus Christ, it only have one of
[30:10] that.
[30:12] Amen. Amen. And that is what the fight
[30:14] for ministry will have. That one
[30:17] ministry of Jesus Christ purpose for the
[30:21] perfecting of the saints for the work of
[30:23] the ministry for the edifying of the
[30:25] baby. Not to be the pope of the saints,
[30:27] the pontiff of the saints, the bishop of
[30:29] the saints. That's not what it said.
[30:31] It's to pour the virtues into the people
[30:35] which cannot be done by revelation. You
[30:38] have to have it to give it. You have to
[30:40] have it to release it. That is what we
[30:43] talking about.
[30:47] So the first sign is a dying man.
[30:51] What you want is a dead man. Amen. Amen.
[30:55] And money and wealth and all them glory
[30:58] and hallelujah. And he love the past and
[31:00] that doesn't kill him. That's right.
[31:05] Let's quiet inside of here.
[31:08] It's okay. I could take my time. Right.
[31:12] Blessing don't ever kill people.
[31:14] Blessing doesn't even get character.
[31:17] Blessing comes upon people. But what
[31:20] changes people is pressure,
[31:24] trials,
[31:25] testings, things that preachers don't
[31:28] like to preach about and people don't
[31:30] like to hear about. But these are the
[31:32] things that has transformed. The Bible
[31:35] call it the trial of your faith. work at
[31:37] patience and let patience have its
[31:39] perfect work that you be entire lacking
[31:43] nothing.
[31:48] People don't like to preach those
[31:49] things. Come to Jesus, everything going
[31:51] to be all right. Canify chicken by the
[31:53] buckets.
[31:54] Is that right? Lord,
[31:59] so I want to turn to a scripture. You
[32:02] don't have to stand. You sit. You could
[32:04] sit uh the preacher going to make you
[32:06] stand and read scripture. But I I don't
[32:08] want you to feel like I'm taking up I'm
[32:10] not sharing this. Just have a thought. I
[32:11] want to sort of finalize this focus to
[32:15] Calvary thing. You can stay right there.
[32:17] Still sit right off of Stephen
[32:20] scripture. But it's from
[32:23] uh Mark 14 verse
[32:28] 3-9. Anybody have it? You know what?
[32:30] Let's stand. Let's take a stand.
[32:35] do something different. Let's read from
[32:38] verse three verse 14. Chapter 14. And
[32:40] being in a Bethany in the house of Simon
[32:42] the leper. Mark
[32:44] 14:3. And he came sat at meat talking
[32:47] about Jesus. And there came a woman
[32:49] having an alabaster box of ointment of
[32:52] spinad very precious. She break the box
[32:58] poured it on his head. And there were
[33:00] some that had indignation within
[33:03] themselves, said, "Why was this waste of
[33:06] ointment made
[33:08] for it might have been sold for more
[33:10] than 300 p, which I understand was more
[33:13] than a year's pay in that day,
[33:16] and have been given to the poor," and
[33:19] they murmured against her. And Jesus
[33:22] said, "Let her alone. Why trouble ye
[33:26] her? She had wrought a good work on me.
[33:30] For ye have the poor with you always.
[33:34] And whensoever ye you may do them good,
[33:37] but me ye have not always. She had done
[33:41] what she could, she is come beforehand
[33:45] to
[33:46] anoint my body to be burying. Verily I
[33:51] say unto you, wheresoever this gospel
[33:53] shall be preached throughout the whole
[33:55] world, this also that she had done shall
[33:58] be spoken for memorial of her. May God
[34:00] bless this word. You may be seated.
[34:03] Amen.
[34:06] The scripture that brother had given us,
[34:09] it came to pass this Luke 9:51.
[34:12] When the time was come that he should be
[34:14] receive up, he steadfastly set his face
[34:17] towards
[34:19] Jerusalem. And that word steadfast mean
[34:21] to be firm in
[34:23] purpose. That word steadfast mean
[34:25] unwavering. Amen.
[34:27] Firmly fixed,
[34:30] constant,
[34:32] unmoving,
[34:33] the quality of state of being steadfast,
[34:36] firmness, constancy.
[34:39] That's what that means. Resolute.
[34:42] that nobody will move you from the
[34:45] direction and the target that you're
[34:46] aiming at.
[34:48] That's it. But
[34:51] today, one more scripture I want to
[34:53] read. You do have to find this one. This
[34:55] is from St. John 12. This is a
[34:57] particular verse out of the same story.
[35:00] Verse three. Then took Mary a pong of
[35:03] ointment of spineard, very costly,
[35:06] anointed the feet of Jesus, wiped his
[35:08] feet with a hair, and this is the part I
[35:10] want to get to. And the house was filled
[35:15] with the order of the ointment.
[35:19] And if I could put a little I won't say
[35:21] title, but I'll call it the order of the
[35:27] ointment. The order of the ointment.
[35:31] And understand the alabaster box is a
[35:33] box used to really preserve things in
[35:35] it, seal things in it. It had the
[35:38] perfume inside of it. And this woman
[35:40] didn't ask the Pharisee permission to do
[35:42] what she did. She was inspired.
[35:45] Something move on her because Jesus had
[35:47] was to be anointed to die. That's the
[35:51] next part. Anointed to die. So Jesus,
[35:56] this woman came and break the box. Now,
[36:00] once that box is broken, because I think
[36:03] they have a kind of wax seal in it
[36:04] sometimes. It's an expensive perfume.
[36:07] It's an expensive ointment. She could
[36:10] have sold it. Maybe she saved a long
[36:12] time to get it. You don't know how she
[36:13] labor to keep it and and and has maybe
[36:16] it was an investment for her. I don't
[36:17] know. But she chose to take that and
[36:22] break it. And the the whole place was
[36:25] filled with the order of the anoint
[36:29] ointment.
[36:31] And I believe when that anointing to die
[36:34] comes upon your life,
[36:37] the family, the house, the home, your
[36:39] work, the job all around you going to be
[36:42] filled with the order of the ointment
[36:45] that you are anointed to surrender,
[36:48] anointed to give up, anointed to go to
[36:50] Calvary. You're going to be anointed to
[36:52] die. You can't just say you're going
[36:54] just as you have to be sent to Jordan.
[36:56] That's what Elijah said. You have to be
[36:58] sent to Calvary. You have to be
[37:00] anointed. And I feel that God have a way
[37:02] of breaking that anointing. But
[37:04] everybody going to see it. Here is why.
[37:07] When that woman that's looking for that
[37:09] coin, remember that lost coin? The Bible
[37:11] said her neighbors, come on now, could
[37:14] see the dust flying because she was
[37:18] searching for something. What is your
[37:20] thirst this morning? What is your deep
[37:23] this morning? What are you looking at?
[37:26] What are you looking for? There got to
[37:28] be a deep in your spirit. There got to
[37:31] be a deep in your heart. I'm fixing to
[37:34] wrap up here, but Brandon said the
[37:36] dynamics of the promised word is that
[37:39] drives the people to Calvary because
[37:41] they're not going normal. So, something
[37:43] have to push them. Something have to
[37:46] drive them. He said, "If love don't get
[37:49] you uh desperate, conditions will."
[37:52] Well, conditions are coming. Just in
[37:54] case you don't know, it's coming.
[37:56] Hallelujah.
[37:58] Hallelujah. Your husband is not your
[38:00] enemy.
[38:03] Your wife is not the enemy. Amen. Your
[38:06] children is not the enemy. The enemy is
[38:08] the devil. Yes sir.
[38:15] And to overcome, you have to recognize
[38:18] the devil at every one of his tricks.
[38:20] Your brother is not the enemy. Your
[38:23] sister is not the enemy. Nobody could
[38:26] take what God ordained for you. That's a
[38:29] lie.
[38:32] What is yours?
[38:35] It's yours. Hallelujah.
[38:38] Come and give the Lord a shout.
[38:44] What is yours
[38:47] is yours. Amen. I'll close with this.
[38:50] Abraham was called out by God. God
[38:53] called him to a land he never saw. He
[38:55] believed. He walked by faith. Because
[38:59] whenever God called you, sometimes the
[39:01] eyes will fool you. You can't use your
[39:04] eyes. Amen. You can't use your senses
[39:06] then. You can't use your emotions. Then
[39:09] you have to put that aside.
[39:11] If if Abraham keep looking at Sarah, he
[39:14] said no way. That's right. Every day he
[39:16] get more depressed because every day
[39:19] Sarah not getting younger. So every day
[39:21] is a frustration. Not only that, Sarah
[39:24] out of the atmosphere altogether. She
[39:26] own
[39:28] and he had to live with that. But
[39:31] because Abraham believed God.
[39:34] Not Sarah, but God.
[39:39] He staggered not
[39:44] at the promise of God,
[39:48] but was strong
[39:50] and evidence given praise.
[39:52] [Music]
[39:56] When you get weak, you complain.
[39:59] So anytime you find somebody
[40:01] complaining, complaining, this is wrong,
[40:02] that wrong, the weak.
[40:06] When you start to praise God amidst
[40:11] [Applause]
[40:13] I come and say all of that this morning,
[40:15] when you could praise God amidst your
[40:19] trying
[40:20] circumstance, you are actually telling
[40:23] them, "You liar. You I believe you at
[40:25] all.
[40:32] [Applause]
[40:35] That's what that's what you see. You see
[40:37] once you you you obey the devil when I
[40:40] say obey the devil sometime
[40:41] unconsciously.
[40:43] So you know you get depressed and you
[40:44] get more depressed and get more
[40:46] depressed and you hear a word say praise
[40:47] God instead of you say hallelujah. Thank
[40:49] you Jesus. No you're still feeling bad
[40:51] but you're hallelujah. You're looking
[40:52] up. You're starting something. You're
[40:54] starting a movement there. I start in a
[40:56] revolution. Devil say you're hypocrite.
[40:58] You know you're feeling bad. Yeah, but
[41:00] you're not considering how you're
[41:01] feeling. Your mouth saying praise God.
[41:03] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. You feel
[41:06] nothing yet. But but but you're moving
[41:08] towards thy direction. He don't want
[41:10] you. Praise God. He don't want you.
[41:12] Bless God. He want you to look at your
[41:13] hands, your pain, your back, what the
[41:15] doctors say, the bills, the rent, who
[41:18] you owe. He want you to see everything
[41:19] else but God.
[41:22] [Applause]
[41:24] You may be seated. You see, you see when
[41:26] brother Brandham lost his child, lost
[41:28] his his wife and was the child was dying
[41:30] and the devil come and say, "Look at
[41:32] you. You serving God, you're preaching
[41:33] and whatnot. Look, you're going to lose
[41:34] your child." He wouldn't even answer
[41:36] your prayer. Were you serving him for
[41:39] and then he started to reason out and
[41:40] reason the devil and what was saying is
[41:41] true. You know what I mean? Things
[41:43] coming out all of a sudden something not
[41:45] here from here. From here, something
[41:48] just come to his spirit. Say the Lord
[41:50] give the Lord take it away. Blessed be
[41:53] the name of the This is death now. This
[41:56] is Think about that lovely child you
[41:59] have now. When you're losing that child
[42:01] and and you could say the Lord give the
[42:03] Lord just lose your wife. There's a
[42:04] child going now. The Lord give the Lord
[42:06] take it.
[42:08] You know people don't want to say amen.
[42:14] You better say amen. You know because
[42:15] the Lord still give and the Lord will
[42:17] still take away. Whether you say amen or
[42:21] not, that is going to change what God
[42:24] will do.
[42:28] [Applause]
[42:31] Hallelujah. You think Jesus had it easy?
[42:35] But my God, why thou forsaken me?
[42:39] Amen. Yes, I'm going through. I'm going
[42:42] strong.
[42:44] I'm
[42:45] Jesus. That might look good for for a
[42:47] play.
[42:51] That might look for a play, not the
[42:53] reality.
[42:54] My God. My Lord. My Lord.
[43:00] Amen. Hallelujah. And get so many and
[43:03] get so many. Jesus wasn't play acting.
[43:04] If it's possible, let us go past. I only
[43:06] saying that for them to hear.
[43:10] Is death coming? Yeah. Glory. I want you
[43:14] to say amen now. Because we have no
[43:16] other place to go, you know.
[43:19] Oh,
[43:21] you thought it had another street. No,
[43:24] it's straight street we going.
[43:29] It's Jordan.
[43:34] It means speaking right to your wife. It
[43:36] means respecting your husband. It means
[43:39] obeying the word. It means wanting the
[43:42] word to become flesh.
[43:47] I'm excited.
[43:49] I have to be. Because for all these
[43:52] years looking for this word to come
[43:55] alive and for the Christ to walk out the
[43:58] pages of this Bible.
[44:07] Glory. Glory. Glory.
[44:11] You talk about the time coming.
[44:17] So the Bham said they're going to close
[44:18] on the churches. Yes, sir. That's right.
[44:21] I know churches in America under
[44:22] pressure. They will be when the church
[44:24] is closed down. What then? It's not the
[44:27] building, is the church. Come on now.
[44:30] You supposed to be a Christian anywhere.
[44:32] Put you on the moon, you're still a
[44:33] Christian. Put you on Mars, you're a
[44:35] Christian. Put you in the fiery furnace,
[44:37] you're a Christian. put in a lion den,
[44:39] you're still a Christian in the lion's
[44:42] den, in the fiery furnace, in the ark,
[44:45] in the flood, wherever God put you,
[44:47] you're still
[44:55] longer trying to close.
[44:57] We are going back to the Bible.
[45:00] Hallelujah. Look at those natural
[45:02] people. How she could do that?
[45:06] It's recession.
[45:08] We got to do with our money. Why she
[45:11] didn't sell that? We get the poor and we
[45:14] get good credit for feeding the poor.
[45:17] She said no problem. It's plenty poor.
[45:21] I always are poor. But I wouldn't be
[45:24] here always. And besides that, that
[45:27] woman anointed
[45:31] to do what she did because Jesus knew by
[45:36] that anointing.
[45:39] It's not many days hence.
[45:43] God help me Jesus.
[45:47] Oh, give the Lord some praises, people.
[45:50] God have to send the right people around
[45:52] your life. God have to send the right
[45:54] anointing upon your life.
[46:02] I love how this woman was inspired. She
[46:05] break it,
[46:07] perfume up the whole place with it. Got
[46:09] these fence and not right here and pour
[46:12] it on his head.
[46:15] Hallelujah. Glory today. You had to pass
[46:17] through the deacon, the elder, the
[46:18] trustee. You had to pass through a whole
[46:19] line of people to get to Jesus's head.
[46:22] I used to tell it's not Jesus
[46:26] because when the real Jesus was walking,
[46:28] anybody could touch him.
[46:31] Anybody could could talk to him. Anybody
[46:35] could meet him.
[46:38] Oh my. And he's the same yesterday.
[46:46] Oh, give the Lord some praise. This
[46:47] people
[46:49] says we would see Jesus.
[47:01] Next woman, she wasn't invited to the
[47:04] party. He's a man. Invite Jesus looking
[47:06] to embarrass him because every house in
[47:09] in in Jerusalem and all those big places
[47:11] have somebody to wash your feet and so
[47:12] on because Jerusalem roads stink and
[47:14] with filth and all kind of the road. So
[47:17] they have somebody to wash your feet.
[47:18] Yeah. Nice coat to come in inner court.
[47:20] They let Jesus come in dirty
[47:22] feet. Tables low. Wasn't high tables.
[47:25] You sit on your feet sticking up in the
[47:26] air. Everybody foot smelling nice.
[47:29] Everybody foot clean. Jesus foot
[47:32] smelling. We want to say say oh it's not
[47:35] it's terrible. This woman saw Jesus feet
[47:38] and say whoa that not right. No she was
[47:41] a ill- failed woman. Now she wasn't even
[47:43] study how illfamed she was. She wasn't
[47:46] staying. She wasn't even studying. You
[47:48] see this is what faith anointing and
[47:51] purpose and inspiration make. It is make
[47:54] you go past you because if she study her
[47:57] reputation and everybody thinking about
[47:59] she and how they know she and what she
[48:01] do, she just sit down and just shake her
[48:03] head and go, "Whoa." But because she saw
[48:06] a purpose, she saw a need. She saw she
[48:10] wanted to do something for the Messiah.
[48:13] She break past the fence. She She go
[48:15] around the bouncer who trying to keep
[48:17] people out the door. And she got through
[48:19] to Jesus and begin to weep, cry. and and
[48:24] and take her hair and dry his feet, her
[48:27] tears, washes of his feet. And Jesus is
[48:31] not saying anything. He is
[48:34] silent leaving the woman to do her do
[48:38] and watching what the rest thinking and
[48:41] and and meditating and say if he was a
[48:43] real man of God, they never let that
[48:46] kind of woman do what she is doing. If
[48:49] he was a real minister, if he was really
[48:52] in the five-fold, never going to let
[48:55] that happen. Those bunch of hypocrites.
[48:59] Oh, hallelujah.
[49:01] Hallelujah. And when Jesus had enough of
[49:04] their torch because your torch is louder
[49:06] in heaven than your words on earth. So
[49:09] why they think in it? He hearing it
[49:11] booming in his amplified
[49:16] song in Jesus amplified show equipment.
[49:20] He hearing all your thoughts. You may be
[49:22] seated. All of a sudden Jesus said,
[49:25] "Simon, I have a word for you. I'm not
[49:28] ready to talk." Hallelujah. I want to
[49:30] break this silence. I want to reveal the
[49:34] mystery of what taking place all here.
[49:38] This woman whose sins are many. Yes, I
[49:41] know her. Her name is in the book. But
[49:46] Jesus drop her
[49:48] charges.
[49:49] Jesus dismiss her case. This woman whose
[49:54] sins are many are forgiven. Oh, that
[49:58] woman went out dancing. That woman went
[50:00] out shouting. It didn't matter what they
[50:03] thought about her. She was free. And who
[50:07] the son of man set free is free indeed.
[50:10] Let's just worship the Lord. Oh
[50:13] hallelujah. And let's play through the
[50:15] blood. Through the blood. As they come
[50:17] and minister to us this
[50:19] morning.
[50:21] Through the
[50:24] blood.
[50:27] Through. Through the blood. We
[50:32] come into his presence.
[50:36] Oh,
[50:39] you love turn around one more time and
[50:41] greet somebody. Oh Jesus.
[51:04] Oh,
[51:07] through the
[51:09] blood. Oh,
[51:12] through
[51:15] the
[51:18] we into his presence.
[51:27] Oh
[51:30] Jesus
[51:33] has
[51:35] made a
[51:37] way that we can
[51:40] come into his presence. Oh
[51:46] through the blood. Let's sing for the
[51:48] last time. Oh,
[51:51] through the
[51:54] blood. Oh,
[51:57] through the
[52:00] blood we can
[52:02] come into his presence.
[52:12] Oh,
[52:17] Jesus
[52:19] made our way that we can
[52:24] come into his
[52:28] presence
[52:30] through the blood. Can we give the Lord
[52:34] a hand of praise this
[52:37] morning? Oh, are you happy to be in the
[52:40] house of the Lord
[52:41] today? It is such a blessing to be in
[52:44] the house of the Lord. Oh, blessed be
[52:48] the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[52:52] Hallelujah. Don't stop praising him.
[52:54] Don't stop praising him. Don't stop
[52:57] thanking him. He's worthy to be praised.
[53:00] He's worthy of the glory. He's worthy of
[53:03] the honor. Oh, let everything take that
[53:06] half breath. Praise the Lord. Oh,
[53:09] blessed be the name of the Lord. You
[53:11] appreciate brother O this morning. You
[53:14] appreciate the special. You appreciate
[53:16] the song service this
[53:18] morning.
[53:19] Amen. So, we're going to speak a bit
[53:22] more about it after service. But today
[53:24] is brother O's birthday. So, God bless
[53:26] you. How many appreciate our pastor this
[53:29] morning?
[53:31] Amen. Happy birthday, brother O. God
[53:34] bless you and we'll take care of that
[53:37] after service. Amen. We do have a note
[53:40] of praise uh from mother Shane. About a
[53:43] month ago, prayer was offered for my
[53:45] aunt and all who was experiencing
[53:47] extreme pains in her bones and was told
[53:50] by the doctor that it could be cancer of
[53:52] the bone which was inconclusive. And she
[53:54] told me before going back for the
[53:55] results from the test, the pains left
[53:57] but still went back to the doctor to
[53:59] confirm if anything was there. and the
[54:01] results from the doctor came back
[54:03] negative. So we we thank God for that.
[54:05] He is still in the healing business this
[54:10] morning. We do have a number of prayer
[54:13] requests from brother Maron for his
[54:15] coworker um Amita Ratu Pinto who's
[54:19] having complications in her pregnancy.
[54:21] We want to remember her in prayer and
[54:22] from brother Joe and brother Jason for
[54:24] Lily Williams experiencing uh pain uh
[54:28] from a sickle cell condition. We want to
[54:30] remember her in prayer. We also want to
[54:33] remember my wife in prayer at home uh
[54:35] suffering with paralysis of her face. So
[54:37] we want to remember her in prayer also.
[54:40] Can we bow our heads in a word of
[54:42] prayer? Heavenly Father, Lord, we are
[54:44] such a needy people this morning. Lord,
[54:48] we see the enemy has increased his
[54:51] attacks all over, Father. And it's could
[54:53] only be one thing. Time is short and the
[54:57] devil realizes that we are about to slip
[54:59] out from under the grasp of this world.
[55:02] Father, Lord, your word said the bride
[55:04] will be a hunted, persecuted group, but
[55:07] with a blast of power. We're going to
[55:08] leave here. The devil will be so mad.
[55:11] He's going to go after the remnant,
[55:12] Father. But he the enemy realizes that
[55:15] there's a change in the atmosphere. It
[55:17] is a change in season and sons and
[55:19] daughters are breaking free from sin and
[55:22] free from condemnation and free from the
[55:25] effects of the world. Father God and
[55:27] father we know you are the same
[55:29] yesterday, today and forever. We didn't
[55:31] come this morning just to have church
[55:33] service but we came to serve notice to
[55:35] the devil that we are intensifying our
[55:38] efforts to get out of here. We don't
[55:40] belong here. We know who we are. We know
[55:42] our position in the kingdom of God as
[55:45] sons and daughters of the living God.
[55:47] And with that position and authority
[55:50] comes power. And father God, we declare
[55:52] this morning, house of hell, take your
[55:55] hands off of God's people. We speak a
[55:57] word of healing right now for every
[56:00] prayer request. May you touch Sister
[56:02] Lily right now from the crown of her
[56:04] head to the soles of her feet. Lord, not
[56:07] only may the pain leave, but may this
[56:10] sickle cell condition be completely
[56:12] reversed today in the name of Jesus
[56:15] Christ, we plead the blood and apply it
[56:18] upon her and her house today, Lord, upon
[56:21] my wife, that facial condition. May you
[56:24] reach down even now and heal her
[56:26] completely.
[56:28] If there's anyone else sick in the
[56:30] building, sick on the internet, Father
[56:33] God, may the Holy Ghost today move
[56:35] through the connection, move through the
[56:37] camp. We take control this morning for
[56:41] the glory of God. Uh we take control of
[56:43] the atmosphere. We take control of the
[56:46] elements. Uh we take control of this
[56:48] place. Uh we say, Father, you are
[56:51] welcome in this house this morning. We
[56:53] welcome the Holy Spirit. We welcome the
[56:56] pillar of fire. We welcome the angel of
[56:59] the Lord. Uh may this day the sick be
[57:01] healed. May the backsliders be restored.
[57:05] Lord, may the prison bars break open.
[57:08] May the house of hell give way to the
[57:11] name of Jesus.
[57:13] every situation, every sickness, every
[57:16] condition, every mind battle, every
[57:19] depression, every doubt, every
[57:22] situation, we put it under the blood
[57:25] this morning in the name of Jesus
[57:27] Christ. We give you the glory. We give
[57:30] you the honor. We give you the praise.
[57:33] We give you the thanks. It's already
[57:35] done. It's a finished work. It was
[57:38] finished at Calvary. That's our history.
[57:41] We are connected to Calvary way before
[57:44] the foundation of the world. Father, may
[57:46] you bless the reading of the word. May
[57:48] you bless the service today. May you
[57:51] bless your people today. May the Holy
[57:53] Ghost pour out. May you bless your
[57:55] people. May you take me out of the way
[57:58] in the name of Jesus Christ. And the
[58:00] church says, And the church says,
[58:03] "Amen." Amen. And amen. Turn around.
[58:06] Greet your brother. Greet your
[58:08] sister. Amen.
[58:13] Amen.
[58:14] [Music]
[58:20] [Music]
[58:22] Through it
[58:25] all. Through it
[58:29] all. I've learned to trust in
[58:33] Jesus. And I learned to trust in God.
[58:37] Oh, through it
[58:40] all. Oh,
[58:44] through. Oh, I learn to depend upon his
[58:51] word. Oh, through it all. Is that your
[58:56] testimony this morning? Through it
[58:59] all. Oh, I learned to trust in Jesus.
[59:05] Oh, and I learned to trust in God. Oh,
[59:10] through it all.
[59:13] Oh, through it
[59:16] all, I learn to depend upon his word.
[59:22] Give the Lord a hand of
[59:25] praise.
[59:27] Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[59:30] Lord. Thank you, musicians. So this
[59:33] morning, if you have your Bibles, would
[59:35] you turn with me to one portion of
[59:37] scripture, reading from the book of
[59:38] Revelation, reading chapter 3. It is
[59:41] certainly a great privilege to be in the
[59:44] house of the Lord this morning.
[59:46] Revelation chapter 3 and reading verse
[59:54] 11. Revelation 3 and verse 11. Behold, I
[59:59] come
[1:00:00] quickly. Behold that fast which thou
[1:00:02] hast that no man take thy crown. Him
[1:00:06] that overcomemeth will I make a pillar
[1:00:09] in the temple of my God. And he shall go
[1:00:12] no more out. And I will write upon him
[1:00:15] the name of my God and the name of the
[1:00:17] city of my God which is New Jerusalem
[1:00:20] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[1:00:24] God. And I will write upon him my new
[1:00:26] name. He that hath an ear, let him hear
[1:00:29] what the spirit saith unto the churches.
[1:00:32] Unto the angel of the church of the
[1:00:34] leadyans, write these things, sayeth the
[1:00:36] amen, the faithful and true witness, the
[1:00:39] beginning of the creation of God. I know
[1:00:41] thy works, that thou art neither cold
[1:00:43] nor hot. I would thou cold or hot. So
[1:00:47] then, because thou art lukewarm, and
[1:00:49] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[1:00:51] out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I
[1:00:54] am rich and increase with goods, and of
[1:00:56] need of nothing, and knowest not that
[1:00:58] thou art wretched, and miserable, and
[1:01:00] poor, and blind, and naked. I counsel
[1:01:03] thee to buy of me gold tried in the
[1:01:06] fire, that thou mayest be rich, and
[1:01:09] white reignment, that thou mayest be
[1:01:11] clothed, and that the shame of thy
[1:01:13] nakedness do not appear, and anointed
[1:01:15] eyes with eyes, that thou mayest see. As
[1:01:18] many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be
[1:01:21] zealous therefore and
[1:01:24] repent. Behold, I stand at the door and
[1:01:27] knock. If any man shall hear my voice
[1:01:29] and open the door, I will come into him
[1:01:32] and will s with him and he with me. To
[1:01:36] him that overcomemeth will I grant to
[1:01:38] sit with me in my throne. Even as I also
[1:01:41] overcame, and am set down with my father
[1:01:44] in his throne. He that hath an ear, let
[1:01:47] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:01:49] churches. May the Lord add a blessing to
[1:01:52] the reading of his word. You may be
[1:01:55] seated. So for a title this
[1:01:58] morning, to
[1:02:00] him that overcometh. Hallelujah. My
[1:02:03] subject, how can I overcome? And an
[1:02:07] inspiration, the placing of the
[1:02:10] overcomers in their
[1:02:12] position of
[1:02:14] power. This message this morning is not
[1:02:17] for the church member. hits to the
[1:02:20] individual and brother in speaking this
[1:02:22] morning and over the last two weeks
[1:02:24] speaking about Jordan and speaking about
[1:02:26] the individual being called aside being
[1:02:29] sent to Jordan it really comes down to
[1:02:31] that individual affair and in the
[1:02:34] message Christ is revealed in his own
[1:02:36] word but the Brandham said knowing that
[1:02:38] what we must say we mustn't just say he
[1:02:40] talking about what we say in church we
[1:02:42] mustn't just say because we are gathered
[1:02:44] together to just haphazardly speak on
[1:02:47] anything but it's something that will
[1:02:49] help stabilize the people. So that's
[1:02:52] what we are here to do this morning to
[1:02:53] stabilize the people because here's why
[1:02:56] we are going to pass through dangerous
[1:02:59] treacherous waters. Brother Brandham
[1:03:01] said we are already sailing through them
[1:03:03] and sometimes it gets with you like it
[1:03:06] is with me. And brother Brandham goes
[1:03:08] on. I was talking to a young minister
[1:03:10] and his wife in the room just a few
[1:03:12] moments ago and both of them are nervous
[1:03:14] just like the rest of the world, the
[1:03:16] rest of the human beings. And I said,
[1:03:18] remember, and this is the prophet
[1:03:19] speaking, Satan's got a punch coming at
[1:03:22] you. Don't care who you are, he's got a
[1:03:25] right to that one punch. See, he's got
[1:03:28] somewhere he can punch you. He's got a
[1:03:30] right to that open place. Now, that's
[1:03:33] the spot you got to keep covered all the
[1:03:35] time.
[1:03:37] So, what O has been speaking, he's
[1:03:39] saying talking about death and talking
[1:03:41] about overcoming and talking about all
[1:03:43] of this. When many people come to church
[1:03:44] in the message and they have the
[1:03:46] approach, it's going to be all right.
[1:03:48] Yes, it's going to be all right. But
[1:03:49] there's a punch that's going to come
[1:03:50] your way. And you're going to have to
[1:03:52] stand. You're going to have to overcome.
[1:03:54] And it's a reality to hear the truth so
[1:03:57] that you're not surprised when the punch
[1:03:59] comes your way because the character, as
[1:04:01] he said, is only formed through the
[1:04:03] pressure. The character is only formed
[1:04:05] when you get the punch. The character is
[1:04:08] only formed when something happens.
[1:04:09] Somebody say, "Amen." So I just drop
[1:04:12] that in there to encourage you. It's
[1:04:14] only in church you get encouragement
[1:04:15] knowing the attack is coming
[1:04:19] because that's what the army is about.
[1:04:21] There's no sense going to the army for
[1:04:22] you to never go to war. There's no
[1:04:24] reason to join the army unless there is
[1:04:26] a war. But if you are in the army and
[1:04:28] there is a war, then you ought to know
[1:04:30] get ready because the enemy is coming.
[1:04:32] And if the enemy is coming, you got to
[1:04:33] draw your sword. You got to get ready
[1:04:35] because how can you be an overcomer
[1:04:37] unless you have something to overcome?
[1:04:40] And I believe this morning we are in the
[1:04:42] age of the overcomers. That God has some
[1:04:45] overcomers. Uh in 2016 there are some
[1:04:49] young people that will overcome. There
[1:04:50] are some fathers will overcome. There
[1:04:53] are some individuals will overcome. What
[1:04:55] will they overcome? Church spirit. Uh
[1:04:58] they will overcome sin. They will
[1:04:59] overcome their sickness. They will
[1:05:01] overcome their feelings. They will
[1:05:03] overcome lust. Uh they will overcome
[1:05:05] unbelief. They will overcome yesterday.
[1:05:08] They will overcome their past. Uh they
[1:05:10] will overcome their failures. Uh they
[1:05:12] will overcome what people said about
[1:05:14] them. You will overcome your bad
[1:05:16] feelings. Uh you will overcome every
[1:05:18] devil. You will overcome sickness. Uh
[1:05:20] you will come overcome all hell being
[1:05:22] against you and you will stand as an
[1:05:25] overcomer. So this morning I'm speaking
[1:05:28] to overcomers. Uh so if the devil is
[1:05:31] coming against you this morning, rejoice
[1:05:34] because you are an overcomer.
[1:05:37] The Bible says God will never give you
[1:05:40] more than you can bear. The problem is
[1:05:42] you don't realize how strong you are.
[1:05:45] You don't realize how much power you
[1:05:47] have. Brother Brandham said there's more
[1:05:49] power in your little finger than what
[1:05:51] the devil got. But you don't know it
[1:05:53] yet. You don't realize it yet. But the
[1:05:56] moment you get a revelation of who you
[1:05:58] are, who God is, and who the devil is,
[1:06:02] the devil is finished. And I declare
[1:06:04] this morning the devil is finished
[1:06:07] because we are overcomers. Can the
[1:06:09] church say amen? Oh, you may be seated.
[1:06:13] You are a mystery this morning. Brother
[1:06:15] Kangali, you are a mystery. Young
[1:06:17] people, you are a mystery. The devil
[1:06:19] can't figure you out. That's why brother
[1:06:21] Brandham said when you get over there,
[1:06:24] you will see some people and you will
[1:06:26] wonder how they made it because the odds
[1:06:29] are against you for you even making it.
[1:06:31] But greater is he that's in you than he
[1:06:34] that's in the world. Uh nobody thinks
[1:06:36] you're going to make it. That's their
[1:06:38] problem. But the God uh who put me here,
[1:06:41] he put an attribute, a gene inside of
[1:06:45] you that just won't die, that just won't
[1:06:48] give up. Uh that just won't backslide.
[1:06:50] Uh you could fall this way, you could
[1:06:53] fall that way. But whenever you don't
[1:06:55] have strength for yourself, that gene uh
[1:06:58] begins to speak uh begins to speak uh
[1:07:01] because that gene comes from
[1:07:04] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Everybody
[1:07:08] should be smiling because in you is the
[1:07:12] DNA of God. And you know the story when
[1:07:14] they buried Jesus, that DNA had the
[1:07:17] ability to resurrect itself. So you
[1:07:20] might be dead this morning, but if that
[1:07:23] same spirit, if that same gene, if that
[1:07:26] same genetic structure, if that same
[1:07:29] coding is inside of you, I don't care if
[1:07:32] you you don't hear me this morning. You
[1:07:35] can't kill me again. That's why I want
[1:07:37] to go to Jordan. Because when I die out
[1:07:39] at Jordan, you can't kill me again. You
[1:07:42] cannot kill me again. I want to die out
[1:07:45] this morning. I want to overcome this
[1:07:47] morning. Can the church say amen?
[1:07:49] [Applause]
[1:07:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:07:56] That's why the Bible can say you may be
[1:07:57] seated. Count it all joy. When you get
[1:08:00] all kind of trials and the and the fire
[1:08:03] gets hot seven times hotter. Count it
[1:08:06] joy. Listen, we should have more notes
[1:08:08] of praises. You haven't been writing the
[1:08:11] correct notes of praises in the church.
[1:08:13] I'm about to set that part in order with
[1:08:15] your permission, pastor. We need to
[1:08:17] write praises for the hot trials. We
[1:08:19] need to write praises for the devil
[1:08:22] increasing the attack. That should be
[1:08:24] your note of praise because count it all
[1:08:26] joy. When the trials come hot and heavy
[1:08:29] because that's the only way you could
[1:08:31] prove that you are an overcomer. You are
[1:08:34] born to overcome. You are born to stand.
[1:08:38] You are born to fight. Greater is he
[1:08:41] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:08:43] world.
[1:08:46] Hallelujah. More notes of praises. More
[1:08:49] notes of praises. Thank you for the
[1:08:51] trial. Thank you for the test. Thank you
[1:08:54] for the pressure. Thank you for the
[1:08:56] pressure. Thank you for the trial. Thank
[1:08:58] you for the test. Send some
[1:09:01] more. Send some more. Send some more. We
[1:09:06] can handle it. We are overcomers. Send
[1:09:09] some more trials. How could there be
[1:09:11] miracles? Uh if there's nobody sick, how
[1:09:14] could there be deliverance? Uh if
[1:09:16] there's nobody passed, bring the
[1:09:18] backsiders. Uh bring the sick. Uh bring
[1:09:21] the lame. Uh bring We are overcomers. Uh
[1:09:25] we are the bride of Jesus Christ. There
[1:09:28] is power here this morning to break
[1:09:31] every chain, to cast out every
[1:09:34] [Applause]
[1:09:38] devil. Hallelujah.
[1:09:41] Hallelujah.
[1:09:43] Overcome. No praise demons. Overcome.
[1:09:47] Overcome what you know. Overcome your
[1:09:49] background. I'm a shy person. I don't
[1:09:52] want to shout in church. Yeah. You got
[1:09:54] to overcome that, too.
[1:09:57] [Applause]
[1:09:58] Hallelujah. I see a shy person in a fat
[1:10:01] yet.
[1:10:05] I see a shy person in a party yet.
[1:10:08] Hallelujah. But you see what it is is a
[1:10:10] spirit that's come upon them in the
[1:10:13] parties and in the feds and that spirit
[1:10:17] has made them act unnormally.
[1:10:21] There's a description using English out
[1:10:23] of character.
[1:10:25] It makes them act different from how
[1:10:27] they would normally act. So what do you
[1:10:29] think will happen to you when the Holy
[1:10:36] Ghost when the Holy Ghost come upon your
[1:10:39] heart and come upon your fingers and
[1:10:42] come upon your feet? People who can't
[1:10:45] play basketball begin to jump. People
[1:10:48] who not athletic begin to move because
[1:10:51] there's Holy Ghost power. God can make
[1:10:53] you fit overnight. Forget the high blood
[1:10:56] pressure. Forget the diabetes. Forget
[1:10:59] the arthritic pain. When the Holy Ghost
[1:11:02] comes upon you, you begin to overcome
[1:11:04] all of that. It's the same Holy Ghost.
[1:11:07] It's the same power. It's the same
[1:11:11] anointing. Come on. You
[1:11:13] overcomers, you lift your voice. You
[1:11:16] give God worship. Today is freedom day.
[1:11:20] Freedom day. Free at last. Free at last.
[1:11:24] Thank God almighty. I'm free at
[1:11:27] last.
[1:11:29] Hallelujah.
[1:11:30] Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. You may be
[1:11:34] seated. Hallelujah. You see, we need to
[1:11:37] begin to speak more like Caleb. Caleb
[1:11:40] didn't say, "If the Lord will drive out
[1:11:43] those giants from the mountain, then
[1:11:45] everything will be all right." We need
[1:11:47] to restructure how we speak. He said,
[1:11:49] "If the Lord is with me, I
[1:11:52] singular personal pronoun. If the Lord
[1:11:55] is with me, I am more than able to drive
[1:11:59] them out of my house. If God is with me,
[1:12:02] I singular personal pronoun more than
[1:12:06] able to clean up my house. If the Lord
[1:12:09] is with me, I singular personal pronoun,
[1:12:13] I'm able to get back my daughter. If the
[1:12:15] Lord is with me, I am able to be
[1:12:18] recovered. By his stripes, I am healed.
[1:12:22] By his power, I'm going to make it. I'm
[1:12:25] going to speak for me. I'm going to
[1:12:27] speak for my house. If the Lord is with
[1:12:30] me, I'm more than able. You are more
[1:12:32] than able this morning. You are more
[1:12:34] than able this morning. You are more
[1:12:36] than able this morning. You are born
[1:12:38] unable this morning. I'm going to say it
[1:12:41] until you believe it. You are more than
[1:12:43] able this morning. You are born for such
[1:12:46] a time as this. This is a faith service.
[1:12:49] You are not from this world. You come
[1:12:51] from God. You are going back to God.
[1:12:53] Don't let the devil lie to you. Don't
[1:12:55] let the devil speak lies to you. You are
[1:12:58] more than able.
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:02] Hallelujah.
[1:13:04] Yes, you could overcome the styles. Yes,
[1:13:07] you could overcome the fashions. Yes,
[1:13:10] you could overcome the music. Yes, you
[1:13:12] could overcome fornication. Yes, you
[1:13:14] could overcome adultery. Yes, you could
[1:13:16] overcome pornography. Yes, you could
[1:13:19] overcome lust. Yes, you could overcome
[1:13:21] lying. Yes, you could overcome mind
[1:13:23] battles. Yes, you could overcome doubt.
[1:13:26] Yes, you could overcome fear. Yes, you
[1:13:29] could overcome unbelief.
[1:13:31] [Applause]
[1:13:42] Hallelujah.
[1:13:43] God does not make mistakes.
[1:13:47] He hasn't made one mistake. He is not a
[1:13:50] mistaken God. When he chose you, he knew
[1:13:53] why he chose you. And when he looked at
[1:13:55] you, he looked at you not in your
[1:13:58] condition, but he looked at the finished
[1:14:00] product. It takes a real master
[1:14:02] craftsman to look at the raw material
[1:14:05] and see the finished product. It takes a
[1:14:08] genius to look at raw material and know
[1:14:12] how to put it
[1:14:14] together to bring it to the finished
[1:14:17] product. That's why the Bible said he's
[1:14:19] the author. He wrote the plan and he's
[1:14:21] the finisher. I thank God that he is the
[1:14:24] author and he is the finisher. He
[1:14:27] started it and he's the one finishing
[1:14:29] it. Listen, it didn't even put you in
[1:14:32] the equation. He started it and he's the
[1:14:35] finisher of your faith. You didn't write
[1:14:38] your name in the book. Did you write
[1:14:40] your name? Did you write your name? Who
[1:14:42] wrote the name? He wrote the name in the
[1:14:44] book and no devil could take it up.
[1:14:47] Shake yourself this morning. Your
[1:14:49] healing is on the way. Your deliverance
[1:14:52] is on the way. Your Holy Ghost baptism
[1:14:55] is on the
[1:14:57] way. You didn't choose yourself. Brother
[1:15:01] O didn't choose you. God chose you. He's
[1:15:05] the one to perfect you. He is the one to
[1:15:07] adopt you. He is the one to heal
[1:15:13] you. Shake yourself this morning. You
[1:15:17] belong to God. You don't belong to this
[1:15:19] church. You belong to God. And he is
[1:15:22] more than able to keep you. He's more
[1:15:24] than able to preserve you. He's more
[1:15:27] than
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:32] able.
[1:15:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I don't know
[1:15:37] what's going to happen this morning, but
[1:15:39] I have faith this morning to see the
[1:15:41] sick walk out of here healed this
[1:15:43] morning. I have faith this morning for
[1:15:45] the backsliders in here to walk out
[1:15:48] delivered with a brand preacher message.
[1:15:50] How can I overcome? And many of us are
[1:15:52] struggling with all kinds of different
[1:15:54] things. This morning is the day of your
[1:15:56] deliverance. The struggle is about to be
[1:15:59] over because the biggest trick that the
[1:16:02] devil pull on you is to try to get you
[1:16:04] to think you are somebody
[1:16:08] else. You may be seated. Let me say that
[1:16:11] again. The biggest trick that the devil
[1:16:14] played on you is for you to think that
[1:16:16] you are somebody else. And when the word
[1:16:19] is preached, you say amen, but you think
[1:16:21] it's for the person next to you. God
[1:16:24] could heal. Yeah, he could heal him. God
[1:16:27] could seal. Yeah, he can heal. Huh? But
[1:16:29] you take yourself out the equation. But
[1:16:31] this morning, I'm speaking to you. Not
[1:16:33] the person next to you. Not the person
[1:16:36] behind you. Not the person in front of
[1:16:38] you. We come in front and center to
[1:16:40] confront the issues in your life. That
[1:16:43] God is the surgeon. He is the doctor.
[1:16:46] And he is here this morning to perform
[1:16:49] surgery in your heart. He said, "A new
[1:16:51] heart I'm going to give you. A new
[1:16:53] spirit I'm going to give you. I'm going
[1:16:55] to put my spirit inside of you. That's
[1:16:58] what we came here for."
[1:17:05] Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[1:17:08] [Applause]
[1:17:10] I'm tired of church. We don't need more
[1:17:12] church. We need the reality of the
[1:17:15] living God. We have had word, word,
[1:17:18] word. The young people, they don't need
[1:17:20] to hear word. They need to see power.
[1:17:23] They need to see Holy Ghost fire. Paul,
[1:17:26] who was Saul before he became Paul, he
[1:17:29] knew the scriptures. He knew the word.
[1:17:31] But when the Holy Ghost met him on the
[1:17:33] road to Damascus, when fire interrupted
[1:17:37] his day, he wasn't even looking for it.
[1:17:40] But God interrupted his day. And this
[1:17:42] morning, God has interrupted your day.
[1:17:45] He has interrupted your service. He has
[1:17:48] turned your life upside down to get your
[1:17:51] attention to let you know greater is he
[1:17:54] that's in you than that devil trying to
[1:17:57] deceive you. That spirit trying to
[1:18:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be
[1:18:10] seated. That female condition you have
[1:18:13] had, time up. I'm saying it this
[1:18:16] morning. Time up. That high blood
[1:18:18] pressure, time up. Diabetes, time up.
[1:18:22] That feeling of weakness, time up that
[1:18:24] insomnia, time up. Depression, time up.
[1:18:28] Feeling weak, time up. feeling down time
[1:18:31] [Applause]
[1:18:33] up. That's what the word came for.
[1:18:36] That's what the Holy Ghost is here for.
[1:18:38] That's what the power is here for.
[1:18:41] Because the gospel is preached not in
[1:18:43] word only, but it's in power and
[1:18:49] demonstration of the sick being healed,
[1:18:52] of the blind eyes popping open. Don't
[1:18:54] let the devil tell you it's not you. You
[1:18:56] worship God. You don't even know what's
[1:18:59] going on right now. Your eyes cannot see
[1:19:01] it, but I see demons trembling right
[1:19:04] now. The Holy Ghost is here. He's
[1:19:06] delivering the young people. He's
[1:19:08] delivering the mothers. He's delivering
[1:19:10] the fathers. The Holy Ghost is here to
[1:19:13] give you a breakthrough, to give you a
[1:19:15] release, to take away that condemnation.
[1:19:18] It's the same Holy
[1:19:19] [Applause]
[1:19:24] Ghost. Hallelujah. You don't stop
[1:19:27] worshiping. Don't stop worshiping. Don't
[1:19:30] stop worshiping. Today is a different
[1:19:32] day. To him that overcome it. You are
[1:19:35] going to overcome. Today you are going
[1:19:37] to get your breakthrough. Today you are
[1:19:39] going to clean your life up. Today
[1:19:41] you're going to make a decision. Today
[1:19:43] you're going to take a stand. Today you
[1:19:46] are going to worship. Today you are
[1:19:48] going to see God. Today you're going to
[1:19:50] cry out. Today you're going to call upon
[1:19:52] Jesus. Today you're going to say,
[1:19:54] "Jesus, I need you today."
[1:20:00] [Applause]
[1:20:04] Hallelujah.
[1:20:06] Hallelujah.
[1:20:08] Hallelujah.
[1:20:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If love doesn't
[1:20:14] get you desperate, the conditions will.
[1:20:18] Is your need great enough this morning?
[1:20:21] Is your need great enough for you to do
[1:20:25] something different? That woman with the
[1:20:28] issue of blood, she ran out of money.
[1:20:31] She ran out of options. The doctors gave
[1:20:34] up on her. She had nowhere else to go.
[1:20:36] She had no other ideas. She had no other
[1:20:39] support. She had no more counsel. But
[1:20:42] she heard a word that Jesus was around.
[1:20:45] And she took herself. She didn't ask
[1:20:48] somebody. She told herself, "If I could
[1:20:51] just touch the hem of his garment, I am
[1:20:54] going to be made whole." She didn't read
[1:20:56] it in a book. She didn't get
[1:20:58] encouragement to do it. But her need
[1:21:01] compelled a certain action. Is your need
[1:21:04] great enough this morning for you to do
[1:21:07] something different? Is your life upside
[1:21:09] down this morning that you have a need
[1:21:12] to say, "Lord, I'm not going home today
[1:21:15] until I get what I came for.
[1:21:26] You may be seated.
[1:21:28] Hallelujah.
[1:21:31] Hallelujah.
[1:21:34] Hallelujah.
[1:21:36] Hallelujah.
[1:21:38] Hallelujah. If you haven't had a prayer
[1:21:40] life, you don't have to leave that way
[1:21:42] this morning. If you've been living any
[1:21:45] way, you don't have to leave that same
[1:21:47] way this morning. If you have been not
[1:21:50] sure where you stand, you don't have to
[1:21:52] be that way this morning. Today is your
[1:21:55] day for your breakthrough. God promised
[1:21:58] certain things for the overcomers.
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:05] It is supposed to be a fight. Amen.
[1:22:08] It's not supposed to be a walk in the
[1:22:10] park to do this.
[1:22:13] It's the harder way. It's the harder
[1:22:16] choice.
[1:22:18] All hell is against you.
[1:22:21] The people you call your friends on the
[1:22:22] work, they are not your friends.
[1:22:26] The people on your street with what they
[1:22:27] live and what they do, they are not your
[1:22:29] friends.
[1:22:32] You are going against the grain.
[1:22:36] Because there's a different gene in you,
[1:22:38] a gene to overcome the lust of the eyes.
[1:22:42] to overcome the lust of the flesh, to
[1:22:44] overcome the pride of life. You can't
[1:22:47] help yourself.
[1:22:48] [Applause]
[1:22:51] Amen.
[1:22:53] And the worst thing to do is live
[1:22:55] between the two worlds.
[1:22:59] One foot in church and the other foot in
[1:23:01] the world because you don't just want to
[1:23:04] let go. You just don't want to give up
[1:23:08] certain things. So you find yourself
[1:23:10] never happy, never satisfied because you
[1:23:14] come to church and you get a child, but
[1:23:15] then you go to work and you go to school
[1:23:17] and you go about your life and you're so
[1:23:19] busy and the devil throws so many
[1:23:21] options at you.
[1:23:24] That you end up with the amnesia of not
[1:23:27] realizing that you are an overcomer.
[1:23:31] Hallelujah.
[1:23:33] Hallelujah.
[1:23:40] Adam didn't grow
[1:23:42] up. Adam didn't experience what you
[1:23:44] experienced as a child, as a
[1:23:48] teenager, as an adult. Adam didn't have
[1:23:51] to deal with temptations and stress and
[1:23:54] mind battles and ups and downs because
[1:23:56] he was placed here.
[1:23:58] So there are certain promises in
[1:24:00] scripture he could never access because
[1:24:02] the Bible says to him that overcome it
[1:24:04] and Adam had nothing to overcome. So for
[1:24:08] that scripture to be enforced, God had
[1:24:10] to have sons and daughters who would
[1:24:12] have to overcome. And the scripture we
[1:24:14] read speak of Jesus said just as I
[1:24:17] overcame. So even Jesus himself had to
[1:24:20] overcome. Amen.
[1:24:24] And if he had to overcome, must it be
[1:24:26] different for us? Or is it that we
[1:24:30] expect God to just give us whatever we
[1:24:32] want when we ask him? Or is it we want
[1:24:34] to get more like Christ? Because the
[1:24:36] more Christlike you become, the more of
[1:24:39] his will you want to meet. Then your
[1:24:42] prayer begins to change form. Because
[1:24:45] Jesus taught us how to pray. But there
[1:24:47] in the garden of Gethsemane, his prayer
[1:24:49] took on a different undertone.
[1:24:53] He said, "Lord, if it is possible,
[1:24:59] now understand this was the end of
[1:25:00] Jesus's ministry."
[1:25:04] The Bible said Jesus learned obedience
[1:25:07] by the things he suffered.
[1:25:11] So by this time, Jesus would have
[1:25:13] already suffered many things. Amen.
[1:25:16] This is the end of his ministry. So
[1:25:18] Jesus would have been obedient.
[1:25:20] Jesus would have had developed character
[1:25:23] over all his time. This is the ending of
[1:25:24] his ministry. And yet he still came to a
[1:25:27] crossroad to pray a certain kind of
[1:25:30] prayer. Lord, if it is possible, let
[1:25:33] this cup pass.
[1:25:37] This is his his final test as it were.
[1:25:40] This is the final step to overcome. And
[1:25:42] this is this was his Jordan.
[1:25:45] Lord, if it is possible, let this cup
[1:25:48] pass.
[1:25:51] But nonetheless, never is not my will,
[1:25:55] but thy will be done.
[1:25:58] Oh, for a life of complete surrender
[1:26:02] to what God's will is
[1:26:05] for your life. We spend so much time
[1:26:08] pursuing this, pursuing that, this
[1:26:11] dream, this plan, this goal, this
[1:26:13] vision, this whatever it is. And God is
[1:26:16] watching you saying, "You haven't even
[1:26:18] talked to me just yet.
[1:26:23] Bring us to the spot that we could
[1:26:25] overcome ourselves,
[1:26:28] overcome our plans, and surrender to
[1:26:31] God."
[1:26:33] friends. 100% of zero is zero. That's
[1:26:36] right. That's right. That's right. Your
[1:26:40] achievement, you do it 100% and it's
[1:26:43] nothing vanity. It's zero and it will
[1:26:46] not last.
[1:26:48] We have a rapture to go to. We have an
[1:26:50] inheritance to get and we have a
[1:26:52] manifestation to display power on this
[1:26:55] earth before we leave this place.
[1:26:59] How prayerful ought we to be?
[1:27:07] You know, and the more you look at life
[1:27:09] and you look at brother Brandham's life
[1:27:11] and it's easy to talk about things in an
[1:27:14] abstract way. It's easy to talk about
[1:27:16] things from a detached perspective
[1:27:17] because when you don't have the emotion
[1:27:20] or what you go through with a certain
[1:27:22] situation, it's very difficult for you
[1:27:24] to enter into somebody's suffering. Yes.
[1:27:26] Yes. It's easy
[1:27:29] to some people can have compassion but
[1:27:31] you can look at brother Brandham and say
[1:27:32] he lost his wife he lost his child and
[1:27:34] that would be hard but unless you go
[1:27:36] through losing your wife and your child
[1:27:38] it is very difficult for you to connect
[1:27:43] with that and yet in his pain but the
[1:27:46] Brandham could look back and say he was
[1:27:48] just
[1:27:50] testing me
[1:27:53] because brother Brandham was coming into
[1:27:55] a power and God didn't want to trust his
[1:27:58] power to anybody that doesn't have
[1:28:01] character.
[1:28:03] [Applause]
[1:28:04] That's right, friends. This world is not
[1:28:06] how it was 100 years ago, 200 years ago.
[1:28:10] People are happy coming to church, going
[1:28:12] home, and doing their routine and not
[1:28:14] realize that everything that you hold
[1:28:17] dear is about to fade away.
[1:28:21] Luther couldn't preach this way. Wesley
[1:28:23] couldn't preach this way. But this is
[1:28:24] the last age. So how we speak now is
[1:28:27] very different from every age gone past
[1:28:29] because this is the last age
[1:28:34] at the same time it is the best and
[1:28:36] worst age
[1:28:39] because spiritually speaking it is the
[1:28:41] age Abraham, Elijah, John, Peter, they
[1:28:45] all wanted to be here.
[1:28:48] Brother Brandham himself wanted to be
[1:28:50] here
[1:28:52] but God didn't allow it. that they
[1:28:55] without us hallelujah cannot be made
[1:28:58] perfect.
[1:29:00] So whilst it is the best
[1:29:02] age for the believer, it is the worst
[1:29:05] age for the unbeliever.
[1:29:11] Crime will not be solved.
[1:29:15] Violence will not ease up. The schools
[1:29:18] will not get better. The sin will just
[1:29:22] get worse and worse because the devil is
[1:29:24] trying to reclaim all that is his and
[1:29:28] God is trying to claim all that is his
[1:29:31] that elect lady
[1:29:34] and just as in the days of Sodom
[1:29:37] Abraham pleaded he said Lord if you find
[1:29:40] 50 would you spare it
[1:29:43] for 50 yes if you find 40 for 40 yes for
[1:29:46] 30 for 30
[1:29:48] yes but he couldn't even find
[1:29:52] 10. So God had to do an extraction. He
[1:29:56] had to do a rapture. He had to take them
[1:29:57] out of there because it was too filthy
[1:30:00] and he had to judge it. Church, wake up
[1:30:03] this morning.
[1:30:07] To realize that what you are fighting
[1:30:09] for in the natural has no value at all.
[1:30:14] Amen.
[1:30:16] I'm not saying don't live and try to
[1:30:19] work and no, but make sure you keep your
[1:30:22] focus on your spiritual purpose because
[1:30:26] the Bible said it like this. What does
[1:30:27] it profit a man to gain the whole world
[1:30:31] and lose his soul? And I'm looking at
[1:30:34] people in the house of God and people
[1:30:36] are losing their souls.
[1:30:40] running down money, running down house,
[1:30:42] running down ambition, running down
[1:30:44] their plans, running down their purpose,
[1:30:45] running down their children, running
[1:30:47] down all kinds of stuff.
[1:30:50] And losing their souls,
[1:30:59] don't lose your soul, church.
[1:31:02] Keep the focus. Keep the main thing the
[1:31:06] main thing. Amen. I didn't expect to say
[1:31:09] all of this. This is not in my notes
[1:31:10] this morning.
[1:31:13] But I feel a press coming. I feel the
[1:31:16] situation changing. And I want to see
[1:31:18] the church get to a level of
[1:31:20] desperation.
[1:31:23] Amen. A level of desperation.
[1:31:26] Lord, we need you. Lord, you promised it
[1:31:31] once more, Lord. Amen.
[1:31:35] And forget the simple things. We are
[1:31:37] supposed to be way up the road now. You
[1:31:39] know what the Bible said? Present your
[1:31:41] bodies a living sacrifice.
[1:31:45] Holy and acceptable to God. And you know
[1:31:47] what the Bible call it? It's a
[1:31:49] reasonable service.
[1:31:52] Amen. Imagine God is saying presenting
[1:31:56] your body a living sacrifice is a
[1:32:00] reasonable service.
[1:32:03] It is not a difficult thing to do.
[1:32:13] He said it's reasonable.
[1:32:17] You don't need to be a Christian to
[1:32:19] present your body a living sacrifice.
[1:32:21] People in all kinds of beliefs for all
[1:32:25] kinds of reasons make all kinds of
[1:32:28] decisions to live a certain way. What is
[1:32:31] your excuse when you have the message of
[1:32:34] Malachi 4 and the message of the hour?
[1:32:36] Amen.
[1:32:39] People decide to give up all kinds of
[1:32:40] thing and live in the mon the monks and
[1:32:43] the monasteries and all kinds of
[1:32:46] different religions
[1:32:48] and they make a decision to live a
[1:32:50] certain way because they believe a
[1:32:52] certain something.
[1:32:54] So it begs the question, what do you
[1:32:56] believe?
[1:32:58] Because if you believe that this is
[1:33:00] real, it will make you act a certain
[1:33:03] way. It will make you live a certain
[1:33:05] way. It'll make you speak a certain way.
[1:33:12] No wonder God could tell the prophet if
[1:33:14] you only get the people to believe. Not
[1:33:17] even cancer would stand before you.
[1:33:21] Because when you really believe God and
[1:33:23] you could challenge God and put him to
[1:33:25] the test and said, "Lord, you said it.
[1:33:28] You spoke it. I believe it. And I'm
[1:33:32] walking by faith on it. Not by sight,
[1:33:36] but because I believe. Because it's
[1:33:38] real.
[1:33:42] [Applause]
[1:33:48] So I find myself this morning digging
[1:33:50] deeper into you, examining yourself to
[1:33:53] what do you really believe?
[1:33:57] Because if the Bible says he is the God
[1:33:59] that heal thee, do you believe that?
[1:34:03] If the Bible says he is able to supply
[1:34:05] your needs, do you believe that?
[1:34:09] When the Bible says no weapon formed
[1:34:11] against you shall prosper, do you
[1:34:13] believe that?
[1:34:16] When the Bible says, I will not leave
[1:34:18] thee nor forsake thee. Do you believe
[1:34:19] that?
[1:34:28] [Applause]
[1:34:34] Brother Brandham said it this way. You
[1:34:35] may be seated. God could only prove his
[1:34:38] word by believers.
[1:34:42] So I have a question this morning. Are
[1:34:44] there any believers
[1:34:46] in the house?
[1:34:51] Is there anybody who believes that Jesus
[1:34:54] Christ is the same
[1:34:56] yesterday, today, and forever? Is there
[1:35:00] anybody in the house who believe that
[1:35:03] this message of Malachi 4 is just as
[1:35:06] real and the promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:10] is just as real as when it fell on the
[1:35:13] day of Pentecost? Is there anybody who
[1:35:16] believes that God could still restore
[1:35:18] the backsliders? God could fix your
[1:35:21] marriage, God could restore your missing
[1:35:24] limbs. Is there anybody believes that he
[1:35:27] could still save? He could still heal.
[1:35:30] He could still seal. He is still a
[1:35:32] redeemer. He is a savior. He is Jehovah
[1:35:35] Gyra. He is Jehovah Rafa. He's Jehovah
[1:35:38] Nishi. He's Jehovah Siku. Is there any
[1:35:41] believers in the house?
[1:35:48] You may be seated.
[1:35:53] Bible said if I lose this body, there's
[1:35:54] another body for me.
[1:35:58] Do you believe that? So what are you
[1:36:01] worried about? You know that this flesh
[1:36:03] is just a temporary house for who you
[1:36:05] really are. Temporary. All it like like
[1:36:09] if it's permanent. This walking around
[1:36:11] cannot make it permanent.
[1:36:14] Amen.
[1:36:16] Exercise can't make it permanent.
[1:36:18] Vitamin A, B, C, D, folic acid, or
[1:36:21] folate cannot make it permanent. This is
[1:36:25] temporary. But I have another body
[1:36:28] that's a permanent
[1:36:31] body. You may be seated. And that body
[1:36:34] don't need vitamin A, B, C because
[1:36:37] vitamins is is is already locked up.
[1:36:40] Eternal life.
[1:36:43] So what are you worried about? What are
[1:36:45] you worried about? You are an overcomer.
[1:36:48] You are overcomer.
[1:36:50] You may be seated. The vitamins you must
[1:36:53] have is the vitamins for your soul.
[1:37:00] You may be seated. But Isaac, this
[1:37:02] message is so simple this morning. Yes.
[1:37:04] Because I've seen people with the deep
[1:37:06] mysteries have no life. Amen.
[1:37:10] [Music]
[1:37:11] Let me say that again. People with all
[1:37:13] the quotes and the tapes have no life.
[1:37:15] Still cannot forgive. Still cannot love.
[1:37:18] Still cannot repent. Still cannot shake
[1:37:20] your hand. Still cannot say God bless
[1:37:22] you. Still can't do it. So it hasn't
[1:37:24] worked. No wonder Paul could say, "Do I
[1:37:27] have all mysteries? Do I speak with
[1:37:29] tongues? Do
[1:37:31] I and I have no charity? I'm like a
[1:37:34] sounding brass. are just talking talking
[1:37:37] just talking talking I tire of talk I
[1:37:40] want the living reality of the living
[1:37:42] God I want charity to be in my life
[1:37:52] [Applause]
[1:37:55] I can't judge anybody say judge not I
[1:37:59] can't judge you God is the judge
[1:38:02] so I'm not here to judge you but I'm
[1:38:04] here point a way and a higher way.
[1:38:10] The Bible said there's a way that seemth
[1:38:11] right man. It seems right. It looks
[1:38:14] right. The mats add up, but it it
[1:38:17] appears right, but it's the wrong way.
[1:38:21] The end is death and destruction.
[1:38:24] What road are you on this morning?
[1:38:28] I made to shake your reality this
[1:38:30] morning because it's down to the
[1:38:32] individuals.
[1:38:35] situations come and when the situation
[1:38:37] come I ask the question in the dark ages
[1:38:40] in the days of Peter and they when Peter
[1:38:42] say oh God so happy to be crucified like
[1:38:45] my Lord
[1:38:48] Peter was happy in fact he said don't
[1:38:51] even do it like Jesus turn me upside
[1:38:52] down because I'm not even worthy to die
[1:38:54] like he died
[1:38:59] for the sake of this gospel it's
[1:39:02] dripping with blood. The blood of
[1:39:05] disciples who died for the truth.
[1:39:09] When the they they put them in the
[1:39:10] lion's den and they fed them in the
[1:39:12] circus, they walked saying nearer my God
[1:39:15] to thee. Do we have any believers in the
[1:39:18] house?
[1:39:21] [Applause]
[1:39:28] Who really believe this gospel to be the
[1:39:30] truth. Yes. Amen. No wonder the Bible
[1:39:34] says when the son of man cometh, shall
[1:39:35] he find faith?
[1:39:38] Because it takes faith to connect who
[1:39:40] you are to what you're supposed to
[1:39:42] receive.
[1:39:43] Without faith, it is impossible to
[1:39:45] please God. So when you walk around,
[1:39:48] you're worrying and you're confused and
[1:39:50] you don't know how it's going to happen
[1:39:52] and you're not sure and the neighbor
[1:39:54] this and this happened and you not
[1:39:56] walking in faith. God didn't even say I
[1:39:57] can't even hear you yet
[1:40:00] because you have to at least come with a
[1:40:01] currency. Just come with faith and then
[1:40:03] I can talk to you because without faith
[1:40:04] is impossible. You're coming and I'm not
[1:40:06] pleased. You can't ask me anything cuz
[1:40:07] I'm not pleased. But when you come and
[1:40:09] say Lord, you are the God that heals,
[1:40:11] seal, deliver. Then God can say yes now
[1:40:13] what you want. What whatever you need, I
[1:40:17] am what you need. I am that I am. It's
[1:40:20] your approach that makes the difference.
[1:40:28] You may be seated.
[1:40:32] I don't even know if I'm preaching
[1:40:33] anymore. I'm just talking to you this
[1:40:34] morning. The disciples had to pay their
[1:40:37] taxes. Jesus said, "Go and catch a
[1:40:39] fish." Hallelujah. But I tell you, I
[1:40:42] need to pay taxes. Why? I have to go and
[1:40:43] fish. I just need a
[1:40:48] check. Cash, credit card, anything. They
[1:40:52] go and get the fish. It's a cotty fish,
[1:40:55] fry fish one side, baked fish next side,
[1:40:57] stew fish next side, and inside is a
[1:40:59] coin. He say pay that tax.
[1:41:04] And you worried about where your next
[1:41:06] David said, I was young. I'm now old.
[1:41:10] I've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:41:14] or his seed beg bread. Are you a seed, a
[1:41:17] child of the king?
[1:41:23] You may be seated. Why? Why would you
[1:41:26] compare your life to somebody else on
[1:41:29] planet
[1:41:39] Earth? Amen. With your name on it. Your
[1:41:43] name on the mailbox.
[1:41:46] Built. You don't even have to build it.
[1:41:48] Built for you. Hallelujah. All you need
[1:41:50] is the keys.
[1:41:52] And you will compare your life to flesh
[1:41:55] and blood when you are not even just
[1:41:57] flesh and blood. But you come from God
[1:42:00] and you are going back to God. What are
[1:42:03] you doing this morning, brother Isaac?
[1:42:04] I'm just reminding you that you are an
[1:42:06] overcomer.
[1:42:14] So shake yourselves this morning.
[1:42:17] Encourage yourself in the Lord as David
[1:42:19] did. Amen. Yes, I could overcome. Yes, I
[1:42:22] could stand. Yes, I could have a
[1:42:24] testimony. Yes, God will provide. Yes,
[1:42:27] God can keep me. And you do not have to
[1:42:30] compromise with the world.
[1:42:35] You may be seen. I want to challenge
[1:42:37] you. Mother, father, child, deacon,
[1:42:39] elder, I don't
[1:42:41] care. Yesterday is gone. It's impossible
[1:42:45] to go back in time and deal with
[1:42:48] yesterday.
[1:42:49] But you have a choice from today.
[1:42:52] Amen. Brother Olu preached it so
[1:42:54] beautifully in ivory because he said
[1:42:55] that's what Easter is. It's it's a
[1:42:57] rebirth.
[1:42:58] It's resurrection. It's a new day. It's
[1:43:01] a new chance. It's a new opportunity.
[1:43:04] Lord, if you just give me the grace to
[1:43:06] try one more time. Is there anybody
[1:43:09] wants to try one more time?
[1:43:15] One more chance, Lord. If it if you
[1:43:18] would just give me one more chance to
[1:43:21] pick up the pieces and serve you with
[1:43:24] everything.
[1:43:26] There's nothing you could do about
[1:43:28] yesterday, but from today, you could
[1:43:30] speak like Joshua. As for me and my
[1:43:33] house, we will serve the Lord.
[1:43:41] [Applause]
[1:43:44] Yesterday is gone.
[1:43:46] But right now, you have a choice to
[1:43:49] worship. You have a choice for whatever
[1:43:53] plans you had after this service to
[1:43:56] change it to put the right kind of plans
[1:43:58] after this service. Because if God is
[1:44:01] not in the plan, you're not you're
[1:44:03] wasting time planning.
[1:44:06] Make sure and keep Jesus in the plan.
[1:44:08] Make sure and keep him in the boat. Make
[1:44:11] sure you how could you in this day leave
[1:44:14] your house in the morning without
[1:44:15] praying? Who do you think you
[1:44:18] are? Amen. Are you crazy
[1:44:22] to leave your house on a morning
[1:44:25] without praying because you want to
[1:44:28] please a boss who God allowed to be
[1:44:30] there because he even there by his own
[1:44:33] choosing?
[1:44:35] Jesus took Herod and fellas listen is my
[1:44:37] father run this thing.
[1:44:41] Herod playing his boss and pilot playing
[1:44:43] his boss and
[1:44:47] how dare you leave your house in the
[1:44:48] morning without praying.
[1:44:51] There are certain basic requirements for
[1:44:53] a Christian. Read your Bible and pray
[1:44:55] every day.
[1:44:58] There are no exceptions. There are no
[1:45:00] day offs. There are people in here
[1:45:02] trembling because they're afraid to ask
[1:45:04] the boss for a day off and only taking
[1:45:05] day off from God business every day.
[1:45:10] Because I can guarantee you this. If you
[1:45:13] read your Bible and pray and read a
[1:45:16] spoken word book or part thereof every
[1:45:18] day, half the problems you end up in,
[1:45:21] it's impossible to end up in.
[1:45:23] [Applause]
[1:45:30] There are two kinds of trials. There are
[1:45:32] two kinds of problems. And 95 to 98% of
[1:45:37] what we deal with is our own choosing.
[1:45:40] But it says out and we are still to be
[1:45:42] led
[1:45:44] by the spirit into the wilderness. All
[1:45:48] the wilderness we in is our choices have
[1:45:51] resulted in us being in a wilderness,
[1:45:54] not even deep wilderness.
[1:45:58] Amen. Amen. Had Jesus been in your
[1:46:02] decisions, you would not have been in a
[1:46:04] wilderness. You win and you'd be waiting
[1:46:06] for the spirit to lead you into the
[1:46:08] wilderness so you could be tested and
[1:46:09] tried and proven as a son to be adopted.
[1:46:15] So, we are back to basics. Last time as
[1:46:18] as I was meditating on this message, you
[1:46:21] almost got a title of back to basics,
[1:46:23] but I said that'll just
[1:46:25] be too radical.
[1:46:28] Back to
[1:46:29] basics ABC always believe Christ because
[1:46:32] many times people reach to form five
[1:46:34] youth university and they forget the
[1:46:35] basics in they forget the reason they
[1:46:38] even in church there like families who
[1:46:41] feuding they feuding for so long the
[1:46:43] child asks the grandmother why we
[1:46:44] fighting again you say it's so long I
[1:46:46] remember why we fighting but keep
[1:46:50] fighting we we have a family feud what
[1:46:53] started it there was 68 years ago I
[1:46:55] can't remember it was your husband with
[1:46:57] a
[1:46:58] But the fight is still on.
[1:47:02] But Abraham said, "If you lost Jesus
[1:47:05] along the way, you have to go back and
[1:47:09] find him where you left him because he
[1:47:11] never walks away from you. We are the
[1:47:14] ones who walk away from him.
[1:47:20] Hallelujah.
[1:47:21] So if there's stuff in your life going
[1:47:24] upside down, topsyturvy, inside out,
[1:47:27] it's not Jesus left you, track back uh
[1:47:31] your steps. I don't think that's proper
[1:47:33] English. Backtrack, walk back, retrace
[1:47:37] your steps, and find Jesus. You know
[1:47:41] what I love about Jesus? He's a God of
[1:47:43] second
[1:47:45] chances. Amen.
[1:47:49] Because if he was not a God of second
[1:47:51] chances, we would have no Peter. We
[1:47:53] would have no Moses. We would have no
[1:47:55] David. We'd have no Isaac. We'd have no
[1:47:58] Abraham.
[1:47:59] And you wouldn't even be here because
[1:48:01] you know your history better than me.
[1:48:04] But he's a God of second chances. And
[1:48:07] his blood now makes a way and speaks
[1:48:10] better things for us. So we have no
[1:48:12] reason to be sad, no reason to be
[1:48:14] depressed, no reason to be upset.
[1:48:19] And we should have such a zeal and
[1:48:21] enthusiasm to be like Jesus.
[1:48:25] You may be seated. I'm just sharing from
[1:48:28] my heart this morning. Sometimes you
[1:48:31] just have to share from your heart.
[1:48:33] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:48:38] The first time I testified in church was
[1:48:40] 19
[1:48:42] 93 I believe 93 after Lake Champion 93.
[1:48:47] And I had an
[1:48:48] experience with the Holy Ghost. I'll
[1:48:50] never
[1:48:52] forget. But with that experience in the
[1:48:55] spiritual, I had no experience in the
[1:48:58] natural.
[1:49:00] Really, how many trials could somebody
[1:49:02] have at age
[1:49:06] 12? How much testing could you have when
[1:49:09] you now become a
[1:49:11] Christian? And the Lord blessed me to be
[1:49:13] able to testify and share. By age 16, I
[1:49:16] was preaching, but no trials, no test,
[1:49:18] no
[1:49:20] situation. It's easy to say, "Love God
[1:49:22] and stand strong and overcome when you
[1:49:25] never had a test.
[1:49:29] You'd have plenty military generals in
[1:49:31] history say attack, attack and they stay
[1:49:33] in the back. Attack,
[1:49:35] attack, kill them, kill them. They're
[1:49:37] afraid to go on the front line cuz they
[1:49:39] have no experience in the front line.
[1:49:42] Those generals who operate from the back
[1:49:45] are very different from the ones who
[1:49:46] lead the charge. Because the ones who
[1:49:48] lead the charge, the men behind them are
[1:49:51] very different because they recognize if
[1:49:52] there's a leader, I can't even be behind
[1:49:54] him cuz that man just it's a difference.
[1:49:57] That's right. And God takes us through
[1:50:00] different experiences that at the end of
[1:50:03] the day, it cannot be us. And it's just
[1:50:07] him.
[1:50:09] [Applause]
[1:50:12] Amen, brother. And recently, just a week
[1:50:14] ago, last week, I was in service and
[1:50:16] when I left church, well, my wife was
[1:50:19] sick over the day before and I left and
[1:50:21] I left her one way and I went home and
[1:50:23] met her another
[1:50:25] way. And it's one thing to hear about
[1:50:28] sickness or condition and you pray for
[1:50:30] different condition and see but it's a
[1:50:32] different thing when you have to live
[1:50:33] with
[1:50:34] it what it does to you emotionally
[1:50:37] mentally the strain and I can now
[1:50:40] understand when brother Brandham was
[1:50:41] going through a situation with his
[1:50:43] daughter and going through and and what
[1:50:45] you would go
[1:50:46] through I barely was able to come to
[1:50:49] preach today because of what I consider
[1:50:51] the emotional toll and it's difficult
[1:50:53] for you to understand I understand
[1:50:54] because you didn't go through what I
[1:50:56] went
[1:50:57] And many time you meet people and you
[1:50:59] talk with them and how is it going
[1:51:00] brother? How is it going sister? And
[1:51:02] it's really difficult because we all
[1:51:04] have different trials. We all have
[1:51:07] different situations.
[1:51:09] Hallelujah.
[1:51:11] But through it all, what keeps you is
[1:51:13] the word.
[1:51:15] Because when the word says God could
[1:51:17] never give you more than you can bear.
[1:51:20] Hallelujah. And then you begin to change
[1:51:22] how you pray and say, "Lord, show me
[1:51:24] through this experience what you want me
[1:51:25] to see."
[1:51:27] It's a whole different thing.
[1:51:30] So I want to challenge and encourage
[1:51:32] every one of you. Whatever it is you are
[1:51:35] facing, you have what it takes to
[1:51:38] overcome.
[1:51:39] [Applause]
[1:51:40] And it's not you trying to prove a
[1:51:42] point, but it's God trying to prove a
[1:51:45] point.
[1:51:47] Let me say that again. It's not you
[1:51:49] trying to prove a point, but it's God
[1:51:51] has a point to prove because that's what
[1:51:53] Job's situation was. Job wasn't looking
[1:51:55] for trouble. It's God who start the
[1:51:58] whole thing. He say Satan, where you at?
[1:52:02] He say walking around causing confusion
[1:52:04] back and I went to this house. I went to
[1:52:05] that house. I went to that house. All
[1:52:08] over to and fro. He say back and forth
[1:52:10] just causing mayhem, confusion. He say,
[1:52:12] "Have you considered my servant Job?
[1:52:15] Have you considered my servant George
[1:52:17] Kangali? Have you considered my terance
[1:52:19] over? Have you considered brother Shane?
[1:52:20] Have you considered my mic? Have you
[1:52:22] considered these men? He say but I touch
[1:52:24] them fellas yet know have a hedge around
[1:52:26] them
[1:52:29] fellas
[1:52:30] protected. God say all right try your
[1:52:32] best shot. Amen. But don't touch his
[1:52:35] life. Hallelujah.
[1:52:37] Because God knew what was in Job. And
[1:52:40] God knows what's in you because no trial
[1:52:43] could come your way that God does not
[1:52:45] allow. Amen.
[1:52:47] [Applause]
[1:52:50] And when you have that approach to your
[1:52:52] Christian walk, your walk becomes
[1:52:55] different. Then you could praise God in
[1:52:58] your trial. Praise God in your
[1:53:00] situation. Though he slain me, yet still
[1:53:02] I trust him. The Lord give the Lord take
[1:53:05] away whatever your will is. Not my will
[1:53:08] but thine be done.
[1:53:11] That's a different thing all together.
[1:53:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:53:16] [Music]
[1:53:17] And then you understand what it means to
[1:53:19] wait on God and to tar.
[1:53:25] Amen. Because I asked myself the
[1:53:27] question and I'm seeing so many
[1:53:29] parallels now in the natural and the
[1:53:31] spiritual. Sometime I want to speak on
[1:53:33] the connection between the natural and
[1:53:34] the spiritual. But I was sharing with a
[1:53:36] couple people recently the business
[1:53:39] world is saying now that for successful
[1:53:42] people one of the most important
[1:53:44] attributes they must have is humility.
[1:53:46] And I said but what did brother Brandham
[1:53:48] say? He said God looking for somebody
[1:53:51] the more he blesses the more humble they
[1:53:54] become. I said look how the natural now
[1:53:56] catching up to the spiritual. Amen.
[1:54:02] They said in another article two weeks
[1:54:03] ago, successful people have this belief
[1:54:07] that they could figure it out. Whatever
[1:54:10] it is, they can figure it out. The Bible
[1:54:12] says, "Work out your salvation."
[1:54:16] In other words, it's not on God to
[1:54:17] figure it out. You work it out. You work
[1:54:20] out your salvation with fear. And so,
[1:54:22] you figure it out.
[1:54:24] You figure out how long you must pray,
[1:54:26] how much books you must read, what you
[1:54:28] must give up. It's not my job to figure
[1:54:30] out your salvation.
[1:54:32] That's your job.
[1:54:38] So just as a businessman has to believe
[1:54:41] he could figure it out, you have to
[1:54:43] believe that you could work out your
[1:54:45] salvation.
[1:54:47] Know who you have to separate from, who
[1:54:50] you have to speak to. No wonder. But
[1:54:52] Abraham said, "You want the Holy Ghost?
[1:54:53] Hang around people who have the Holy
[1:54:55] Ghost. Figure it out.
[1:54:58] [Applause]
[1:55:03] Some of us, we just want it too easy.
[1:55:07] Just too easy. And nothing in this world
[1:55:11] or the world to come that's worth having
[1:55:13] comes easy.
[1:55:15] Everything comes with a price.
[1:55:17] Everything has a Jordan to go through to
[1:55:20] get something on the other side.
[1:55:29] Hallelujah.
[1:55:31] What are you willing to
[1:55:34] sacrifice to get a degree? You have to
[1:55:36] sacrifice
[1:55:38] to get a promotion. You have to
[1:55:39] sacrifice something. It could be time.
[1:55:41] It could be family time. It could be
[1:55:43] hours going to university, night going
[1:55:46] to school, Saturdays going to class. To
[1:55:48] get a house, you have to save. To save
[1:55:50] it means you have to give up something.
[1:55:52] You buy lunch 5 days a week or you buy
[1:55:54] lunch 2 days a week and it makes you
[1:55:55] want to cook because you want to save to
[1:55:56] buy a house. It's sacrifice. Whatever it
[1:55:59] is in life, you want to lose weight, you
[1:56:01] have to exercise, sacrifice, you have to
[1:56:03] do something to get results. What is
[1:56:06] your sacrifice in the spiritual realm to
[1:56:09] get results?
[1:56:19] Albert Einstein
[1:56:21] revered and respected as one of the most
[1:56:24] intelligent men on this planet. But
[1:56:27] Brandham spoke about him. So for those
[1:56:28] in the message who want to know where
[1:56:30] this is going I think about 16 times in
[1:56:32] the message he referred to Albert
[1:56:34] Einstein.
[1:56:35] He defined insanity as doing the same
[1:56:39] thing over and over and expecting a
[1:56:44] different result. Amen.
[1:56:50] So if it is in your Christian walk you
[1:56:53] have been getting the same result and
[1:56:55] when you look at it you've been doing
[1:56:57] the same thing then by what is called
[1:56:59] deductive reasoning this is purely
[1:57:01] intellect. You can realize by doing
[1:57:04] something different you will have a
[1:57:06] different outcome. So if you normally
[1:57:08] pray for 2 minutes, just a one minute
[1:57:11] increase already increases the odds of a
[1:57:13] difference in your life.
[1:57:17] Praying for 2 minutes more because
[1:57:19] listen, you see when a plane is flying
[1:57:22] one half degree off over time could take
[1:57:27] you from here to over here. It doesn't
[1:57:29] happen at once. But because time takes
[1:57:32] its effect on distance, the net result
[1:57:35] is over time you just drift. You just
[1:57:38] drift. So what may seem an impossible
[1:57:41] task, it's not no rocket science. You
[1:57:44] cannot eat an elephant in a day. So
[1:57:46] that's why God said here's what meditate
[1:57:49] on the word day and night. Every day.
[1:57:52] Every day. Do something every day. And
[1:57:54] when you start do more and do more and
[1:57:57] do more until after a while it's going
[1:58:00] to become so natural to you that when
[1:58:02] you wake up in the morning the first
[1:58:04] words out your mouth is thank you
[1:58:06] Jesus. It's another day. You didn't have
[1:58:10] to wake me up but thank
[1:58:17] you back to basics. You may be seated.
[1:58:22] I saw a poster sometime recently people
[1:58:25] say how if I ask you how you wake up
[1:58:27] this morning you say my alarm wake up
[1:58:29] they say take your alarm clock and put
[1:58:31] it in the morg and see how much people
[1:58:33] will wake up and alarm clock has never
[1:58:36] woken anybody up
[1:58:37] yet it's only God could wake you up and
[1:58:40] if God woke you up this morning you have
[1:58:43] a reason to give God a shout of praise
[1:58:54] You may be seated.
[1:58:56] That's why the devil will have a problem
[1:58:59] with you, you know, and have a problem
[1:59:01] with me, you know, because Peter and
[1:59:03] those guys, they were not educated
[1:59:05] learned men, but they brought God to a
[1:59:07] reality to the people that people could
[1:59:10] understand these men, they are not
[1:59:12] theologians. And and that's that's what
[1:59:14] I love about God. He is so sovereign. He
[1:59:17] could choose whoever he wants from
[1:59:19] whatever background he wants to get his
[1:59:22] purpose accomplished. Can the church say
[1:59:24] amen?
[1:59:27] Hallelujah. I didn't even realize time.
[1:59:30] Time just moving.
[1:59:33] Just encouraging the people. Hallelujah.
[1:59:36] Young people. Can the young people say
[1:59:39] amen? That's only 10%. Can the young
[1:59:42] people say amen? That's a little better.
[1:59:44] Can the young people say amen? Amen. I
[1:59:47] hope the young people of this church
[1:59:49] understand that you have to take up the
[1:59:53] charge for the revival. Amen.
[1:59:55] Hallelujah. You have to take up the
[1:59:59] responsibility. All of the technology,
[2:00:02] all of what's happening in this world is
[2:00:04] now being driven by young people. 16,
[2:00:07] 17, 20, 25, 30 years old. That's the age
[2:00:10] group of the what they call the
[2:00:12] disruptors in the world today. And God
[2:00:15] is looking for some spiritual
[2:00:17] disruptors.
[2:00:19] Right now in New York, there's a
[2:00:21] 16-year-old who left school because he
[2:00:24] developed a mobile app. What age he
[2:00:28] started at? Maybe 12 or something or
[2:00:30] some young age started that. But he now
[2:00:31] has such a successful app that he didn't
[2:00:33] make sense even go through education.
[2:00:35] He's now a multi-millionaire. And his
[2:00:37] mother is talking about the challenges
[2:00:39] of having to raise a multi-millionaire
[2:00:40] who became self-made. He didn't grow up
[2:00:42] with money. But now all of a sudden
[2:00:44] Google talking to him, Facebook talking
[2:00:46] to him, but he's young and he's a
[2:00:48] disruptor. He say, "I want an apartment
[2:00:50] like this 5,000 US a month for this and
[2:00:52] doing the he's a disruptor. 16 years
[2:00:54] old." Where these spiritual disruptors
[2:00:57] who wake up in the morning and pray till
[2:00:59] heaven respond. When you walk into a
[2:01:02] classroom, people recognize there's
[2:01:04] something different about you. You have
[2:01:06] to dress like them, talk like them, act
[2:01:08] like them, live like them. Why are you
[2:01:10] an overcomer? You are a disruptor. When
[2:01:14] the devil sees you, he say, "Nah, not
[2:01:15] that one. Find the next one. That one is
[2:01:17] too hot to handle. 16, 14, 20, it
[2:01:21] doesn't matter. You are just different."
[2:01:23] Why? You have a revelation that you are
[2:01:25] an overcomer.
[2:01:31] You may be seated. Hallelujah. The
[2:01:34] musicians will get ready. Not quite sure
[2:01:35] how we're going to close this one out
[2:01:36] yet, but the musician can get ready.
[2:01:40] Friends, the Bible says, "Seek ye first
[2:01:43] the kingdom of God." Amen.
[2:01:47] His righteousness, and everything else
[2:01:48] will be added. Amen. That's what many of
[2:01:51] us miss. Amen. Because we have stuff in
[2:01:54] our hearts. Everybody has good desires,
[2:01:55] good ideas. I sit to young people
[2:01:57] sometime, I go, I have good ideas, real
[2:01:59] good ideas. But what is God ideas is a
[2:02:01] different story. We all have good ideas,
[2:02:03] good plans.
[2:02:05] But if we seek the kingdom that's right
[2:02:08] of God first and put his business first,
[2:02:13] then God is obligated to take care of
[2:02:16] the rest.
[2:02:19] You because listen, brother Brandon says
[2:02:22] God wants you to be happy. You know, God
[2:02:24] wants you to be smiling. God wants you
[2:02:27] to be always happy and smiling. That's
[2:02:29] what he wants for you. That's his plans.
[2:02:30] In Jeremiah say, I have good plans for
[2:02:32] you, plans for you to prosper. That's
[2:02:34] that that's that's the Bible. But most
[2:02:36] of us, we're not putting God first. It's
[2:02:39] a last resort situation. When things
[2:02:42] really bad, then we go into hyperdrive.
[2:02:45] I asked somebody yesterday, you you're
[2:02:47] you're taking your vitamins, you say
[2:02:49] you're supposed to only take vitamins
[2:02:50] when you're sick. I say, really? You
[2:02:52] see, that's the problem right there.
[2:02:53] It's only when the situation bad, you
[2:02:55] want to now take you want to overdose
[2:02:57] real C. They say if you take you could
[2:02:59] take up to 20 milligrams of C and and
[2:03:02] they have all the explanation. and you
[2:03:03] just take 20 tablets. But if you was
[2:03:06] living your life a certain way all the
[2:03:07] time, you wouldn't even end up with your
[2:03:08] immunity down. That's right.
[2:03:11] So if God is in your life every day, you
[2:03:13] have a situation where
[2:03:16] it's a relationship. When you're talking
[2:03:18] to him in the morning, the evening is
[2:03:19] not like who who phone number is this?
[2:03:21] This is what God is saying about
[2:03:22] something call ID cuz he has call ID.
[2:03:25] Who's check this check the file? Last
[2:03:28] call was, you know, phone say last call
[2:03:30] was 22 months
[2:03:33] ago when he had a flat tire. He ball. Oh
[2:03:36] god.
[2:03:39] [Applause]
[2:03:45] But when you have a relationship with
[2:03:47] God, the moment you see them, say, "Hey,
[2:03:50] that's George.
[2:03:52] What do you need? I got you.
[2:03:58] relationship.
[2:04:03] You may be seated. You see, many of us
[2:04:04] don't realize that God has a
[2:04:06] personality. You know, he gets angry, he
[2:04:08] gets upset, he gets jealous, he has
[2:04:10] emotions. Some of us has talk about some
[2:04:11] of our family and friends and say, you
[2:04:12] know what, that man has only call me
[2:04:15] when he wants
[2:04:19] something. What do you think God saying
[2:04:21] about you when every time you call him
[2:04:22] is, "Lord, I want a raise. I want this."
[2:04:24] and you never call him to say hi, how
[2:04:26] you going? There are people I know
[2:04:27] naturally I say when the numbers what do
[2:04:30] you want
[2:04:31] boy? How you think God feels when he
[2:04:34] wants a relationship and personal
[2:04:37] relationship with you? Not your son,
[2:04:39] your daughter, your mother, your wife,
[2:04:40] your neighbor, but you. He wants a
[2:04:41] personal relationship with you.
[2:04:46] Jesus on the main line. Tell him what
[2:04:48] you want. Before you use your natural
[2:04:50] cell phone, call him first.
[2:04:54] We call in the doctor first. We call in
[2:04:56] the friend first and hear him tell God
[2:04:57] your problem. And he wants to hear your
[2:04:59] problem first. He's supposed to be the
[2:05:00] first one to hear the problem and the
[2:05:02] results. Lord already healed. Hey,
[2:05:06] results negative or no? He's supposed to
[2:05:08] hear it first because it's a
[2:05:10] relationship with God.
[2:05:13] Everybody feeling fine?
[2:05:15] Are you happy to be a Christian?
[2:05:18] many times. But the Brandham said, "I am
[2:05:20] so happy to be a
[2:05:23] Christian." Is there anybody just happy
[2:05:27] to be a Christian?
[2:05:38] You may be seated. It wasn't something
[2:05:41] tied to the natural because we all the
[2:05:43] Listen, let me give you the great part
[2:05:45] of this whole service. Hallelujah. The
[2:05:47] trials not going to ease up.
[2:05:50] All right. That is the best part of this
[2:05:52] whole thing. The trial is not going to
[2:05:53] ease up. It's going to get a lot hotter.
[2:05:55] It's going to get a lot hotter. But
[2:05:56] that's why brother Brandham said when
[2:05:58] the press comes, when the pressure
[2:06:00] comes, watch the third pull. Then watch
[2:06:02] the because I told somebody recently,
[2:06:04] you can't take a hammer to kill a fly.
[2:06:06] You go break the table. people recently
[2:06:09] in London a couple months ago, somebody
[2:06:11] called the police because they heard a
[2:06:13] whole ruction in a house and they heard
[2:06:15] somebody shouting and they said they
[2:06:17] heard a woman's voice screaming and
[2:06:19] things were being broken and police
[2:06:21] responded and when they came and knocked
[2:06:23] on the man's door, they say we're
[2:06:25] looking for the
[2:06:26] victim of whatever took place. They
[2:06:30] search the premises. They say, "What
[2:06:32] happened?" He said, "Well, here's what
[2:06:33] happened. A spider came into the house.
[2:06:37] and I shouted, "I'm going to kill you."
[2:06:39] But then he jumped and I screamed. So
[2:06:42] that was the two voices. It was him
[2:06:43] threatening and
[2:06:46] responding. The table got broken. The
[2:06:50] vase got
[2:06:55] broken. The point I want to make is
[2:06:57] this. God isn't going to give you a
[2:06:59] hammer to kill a fly. But when you need
[2:07:02] power, that's when the power is going to
[2:07:04] come.
[2:07:06] Spider is not a trial. Locust and that
[2:07:09] is not a trial. But when the trials
[2:07:11] come, you say when the press come, then
[2:07:12] watch the third pull. Then watch the
[2:07:14] power of God come then. When you need to
[2:07:16] speak, you're going to have spoken word.
[2:07:18] You need bread, speak for bread. You
[2:07:20] need healing, speak for healing. You
[2:07:22] need deliverance, speak for deliverance
[2:07:24] because you are son and daughter of God.
[2:07:26] And spoken word is part of your
[2:07:28] inheritance.
[2:07:30] Somebody say amen.
[2:07:32] So, as I close it, let me ask it one
[2:07:34] more time and if you say with a shout
[2:07:36] this morning, is there anybody that's
[2:07:38] happy to be a Christian?
[2:07:43] May the Lord richly bless you
[2:07:46] [Applause]
[2:07:50] musicians. Oh, hallelujah. Give the Lord
[2:07:53] a hand of praise this this morning. Oh,
[2:07:55] blessed to be a wonderful name. Y'all
[2:07:57] preach about Isaac. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:08:01] Hallelujah. To him that overcometh, you
[2:08:03] overcome us this morning. You are more
[2:08:05] than conquerors this morning. Oh,
[2:08:07] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:08:10] Blessed be a wonderful name. Let's sing
[2:08:12] that song. I need you now. I need you
[2:08:13] now. Right now. I need you, Lord, right
[2:08:16] now.
[2:08:19] Blessed be a wonderful name. Just lift
[2:08:21] your hands and worship him. How many
[2:08:23] need Lord right
[2:08:24] now? Lord, I need you, Lord. Every day,
[2:08:27] every second, every minute, every hour.
[2:08:29] Lord, I need you. I can't go another day
[2:08:32] without you, Lord.
[2:08:33] Father. Oh,
[2:08:36] hallelujah. Just lift your hands and
[2:08:38] worship
[2:08:39] him. Forget about yourself. Forget about
[2:08:42] your
[2:08:43] trials. You have already
[2:08:47] overcome. I need you,
[2:08:49] Lord. I need you,
[2:08:51] Lord, right
[2:08:53] now. I need you,
[2:08:56] Lord. I need you, Lord.
[2:08:59] I need you,
[2:09:01] Lord, right
[2:09:03] [Music]
[2:09:04] now.
[2:09:05] Oh, I need you,
