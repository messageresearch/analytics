[37:28] hey many many many man
[37:31] so i'd like to get straight to the wood
[37:34] in the interest of time this morning i'd
[37:36] like to go to three portions of
[37:38] scripture
[37:42] just to lay your
[37:44] foundation for us this morning
[37:48] reading from scene matthew thank you by
[37:50] anthony thank you musicians said matthew
[37:53] 7
[37:54] romans
[37:55] 14
[37:56] and 2nd corinthians 5.
[38:08] amen
[38:09] so reading from matthew 7
[38:12] and reading verse 21
[38:15] not everyone that see it unto me lord
[38:17] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[38:20] heaven
[38:21] but he that doeth the will of my father
[38:24] which is in heaven
[38:26] many will say
[38:28] to me in that the lord lord have we not
[38:31] prophesied in thy name
[38:33] and in thy name have cast out devils
[38:36] and in thy name done many wonderful
[38:38] things
[38:39] and then will i profess unto them i
[38:42] never knew you
[38:44] depart from me ye work ye that work
[38:46] iniquity
[38:48] therefore whosoever heareth these
[38:49] sayings of mine and doeth them
[38:52] i will liken him unto a wise man which
[38:54] built his house upon a rock
[38:57] and the rain descended and the floods
[38:59] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[39:01] that house and it fell not for it was
[39:03] founded upon a rock
[39:05] and everyone that heareth these sayings
[39:07] of mine and doeth them not shall be
[39:08] likened unto a foolish man which built
[39:11] his house upon the sand and the rain
[39:13] descended and the floods came and the
[39:15] winds blew and beat upon that house and
[39:16] it fell and great was the fall of it
[39:19] and it came to pass when jesus had ended
[39:21] these sayings the people were astonished
[39:23] at his doctrine
[39:25] for he thought them as one having
[39:27] authority and not as describes reading
[39:30] romans 14 and verse 10
[39:38] but why dost thou judge thy brother
[39:41] or why dost thou set at not thy brother
[39:45] for we shall all stand before the
[39:47] judgment seat of christ
[39:51] for it is written
[39:53] as i live say the lord every knee shall
[39:55] bow to me and every tongue shall confess
[39:57] to god
[39:58] so then every one of us listen here
[40:01] shall give account
[40:03] of himself
[40:04] to god
[40:06] our last reading from second corinthians
[40:08] 5 and verse nine
[40:11] wherefore we labor
[40:13] that whether present or absent listen
[40:16] why we labor we may be accepted of him
[40:21] for we must all appear before the
[40:23] judgment seat of christ
[40:26] that everyone may receive the things
[40:28] done in his body
[40:30] according to that he had done whether it
[40:32] be good or bad may the lord had a
[40:35] blessing to the reading of his word you
[40:37] may be seated in the presence of the
[40:39] lord this morning
[40:41] i certainly want to appreciate the
[40:43] special service last friday what a
[40:45] blessing were you blessed
[40:47] amen and the service last wednesday and
[40:50] a special note about over last sunday as
[40:52] well we are we are really going through
[40:54] a real important time in our journey
[40:56] friends
[40:57] and i believe that this morning is no
[40:59] different god has something special in
[41:01] store
[41:02] for us so i have a title this morning
[41:05] but before i get into that i want to
[41:06] read uh just a testimony
[41:10] uh this is from sister ronda williams
[41:12] thanking god for his grace and mercy
[41:15] upon my life
[41:17] i've been in a backslidden condition for
[41:19] the past 21 years
[41:21] throughout this time god has kept me and
[41:23] blessed me even in this condition
[41:25] i have made a decision to come back to
[41:27] my lord and savior and serve him with my
[41:29] whole heart i am happy to be back in
[41:31] fellowship and looking forward to
[41:33] receiving the baptism of the holy spirit
[41:36] and total healing for my daughter
[41:38] shanika may the lord bless you surrender
[41:41] and may he grant that noble desire of
[41:44] your heart because that is a promise
[41:46] that's unto you and to your children
[41:48] including your daughter both for the
[41:50] holy ghost as well as for a complete
[41:52] healing
[41:53] can we identify with that this morning
[41:56] you appreciate the lord
[41:58] one soul that comes into contact with
[42:00] the kingdom is worth it all that is
[42:03] there's a reward for that it's a
[42:05] blessing for that that's why we are here
[42:07] hallelujah is for you and for your house
[42:10] and for those that are even on pharaoh
[42:12] so we thank god for that
[42:14] so in being conscious of time i do have
[42:17] a title this morning
[42:20] different kind of title but the title is
[42:21] what will you say to him
[42:24] and what will he say to you
[42:27] what will you say to him
[42:30] and what will he say to you
[42:33] and my subject the judgment seat of
[42:35] christ and my inspiration responsibility
[42:39] versus accountability
[42:42] the title is a striking title
[42:45] because it speaks of a conversation that
[42:47] takes place
[42:49] a conversation that starts with a
[42:51] question that is not defined in the
[42:54] title
[42:55] but whatever question is asked requires
[42:57] you to respond
[42:59] and the response is what you will say to
[43:01] him
[43:03] because he was going to ask you what
[43:05] have you done
[43:09] and you will have to respond and the
[43:11] question this morning is what will you
[43:12] say to him
[43:15] and then what will he say to you
[43:18] what will his be response to you so
[43:21] that's my thought for this morning
[43:24] when he asked a question
[43:26] what will your answer be
[43:28] how will you respond
[43:31] what will you say
[43:33] are you ready to answer him
[43:35] what will you say to him the scripture
[43:38] we read in matthew says to everyone that
[43:40] say it unto me lord lord shall i enter
[43:42] the kingdom of heaven
[43:46] and jesus goes on saying many will say
[43:49] to me in that day
[43:51] in other words they will be answering
[43:52] lord lord have i have have we not
[43:54] prophesied in thy name
[43:57] in thy name have cast out devils in
[43:59] other words there was manifestation and
[44:01] power and display of authority
[44:04] and what is said there is not enough
[44:09] to bring a favor of a response because
[44:11] the response in this situation is depart
[44:14] from me
[44:17] anybody with me this morning
[44:19] so we're going to build into that a
[44:20] little bit but i want to kind of take a
[44:22] little background
[44:23] and i want to go are we going to spend
[44:25] some time in luke 19 today as we build
[44:28] into this to look at it from another
[44:30] perspective
[44:32] so if you have your bibles
[44:36] just hold luke 19
[44:38] in there we're gonna build through this
[44:40] scripture and teach this thought through
[44:43] this and connect it to the opening
[44:45] scriptures that we read
[44:49] luke 19 and verse 1 and jesus entered
[44:52] and passed through jericho and he
[44:54] amplified he says he entered jericho
[44:57] and was passing through and this is very
[44:58] notable to us
[45:00] because in the greek
[45:02] the word for joshua the way it's written
[45:05] and the word for jesus the way it's
[45:06] written is the written in the same way
[45:08] in the greek
[45:10] and by the random word type out the
[45:12] parallel as it were between the ministry
[45:14] of joshua and the ministry of the lord
[45:16] jesus christ
[45:17] it is interesting to note that the first
[45:19] great conquest that joshua had to deal
[45:21] with was jericho
[45:24] it is also important that at this point
[45:26] in jesus ministry we are just about one
[45:28] week away
[45:30] from the ending of jesus's ministry here
[45:32] in luke 19
[45:33] and the last great city that jesus
[45:36] passes through before going into
[45:38] jerusalem is jericho
[45:42] anybody with me this morning
[45:44] so jesus this is this is at a point now
[45:47] just a while before this scripture
[45:50] we see jesus dealing with lazarus
[45:53] for a long time jesus had kept his
[45:55] ministry in secret in confidence he keep
[45:58] telling disciples tell no man
[46:00] don't tell anybody about it don't expose
[46:03] the magnitude of this thing but
[46:04] something changed when lazarus was
[46:07] raised from the dead
[46:08] they could no longer see it quiet not
[46:11] only that the bible says that when the
[46:13] people saw lazarus raised from the dead
[46:16] some believed and others went to the
[46:19] sanhedrin council
[46:20] to say we have to do something about
[46:22] this
[46:23] and the bible says i'm not going to get
[46:24] to it now but the bible says jesus he
[46:27] removed himself from publicly being with
[46:30] the people and went to ephraim where he
[46:33] spent some time there because he knew
[46:35] that they were looking for him
[46:37] so even though he was god on earth the
[46:39] fact that they were looking for him he
[46:41] didn't walk over there saying look me
[46:42] here because his time was not yet
[46:45] he still had certain things to do before
[46:47] his ministry could be completed and
[46:49] between the time that he was there in
[46:51] bethany with lazarus and baby and
[46:53] ephraim for spend some time and deal
[46:55] with certain things he finds himself now
[46:57] on a journey to jerusalem to complete
[47:00] the great purpose that he was on the
[47:01] earth
[47:03] i want you to picture it jesus is
[47:06] passing through
[47:07] and he as he approaches jericho in the
[47:09] scripture before he heals a blind man
[47:12] but that's not the mission
[47:14] because healing is a part of it but
[47:15] really god's purpose jesus coming was
[47:18] not just to heal
[47:20] that was a part of the purpose part of
[47:22] the mission it was just all on the
[47:23] journey but here it was jesus
[47:26] finds himself passing through jericho
[47:29] why are you saying this i'm building a
[47:30] context and a background for where we're
[47:32] going this morning
[47:34] and jesus entered and passed through
[47:35] jericho and behold there was a man named
[47:38] zacchaeus
[47:40] which was the chief among the publicans
[47:43] the publicans are the tax collectors
[47:46] so zacchaeus is the head of tax
[47:48] as it were in jericho jericho is a
[47:51] strategic location at that time all
[47:53] jericho as we know it in the days of
[47:55] joshua and what we call new jericho is
[47:58] now built as one area and king herod as
[48:00] it were built his winter palace there
[48:02] jericho was a major point and zacchaeus
[48:06] who was one of the jews as it were but
[48:09] he was attacked elector which put him in
[48:11] a compromised position the believers
[48:13] could not identify with him they had a
[48:16] problem with this man called zacchaeus
[48:18] because they would consider him in
[48:19] collusion with the roman government to
[48:21] collect taxes anybody with me
[48:24] but jesus finds himself moving
[48:27] through jericho
[48:29] and behold there was a man named
[48:30] zacchaeus which was the chief among the
[48:32] publicans and he was rich
[48:38] and this is a scripture and he sought to
[48:40] see jesus who he was
[48:44] but the brahman preaching this said this
[48:46] man had never seen jesus before
[48:49] now that is powerful it is interesting
[48:51] because this was a wealthy man a man in
[48:53] power a leader in his city and this is
[48:56] about one week before jesus is about to
[48:58] be crucified as it were and he had never
[49:00] seen jesus
[49:02] for almost three and a half years jesus
[49:04] had been performing miracles doing great
[49:07] signs and wonders
[49:10] i wonder why such a wealthy man a man of
[49:12] power a man who was a jew although
[49:14] backslidden
[49:16] had not made it his business before to
[49:18] see jesus
[49:20] billy branham in preaching this would
[49:22] type out that that his wife maybe it was
[49:25] his wife who was telling him about jesus
[49:27] jesus
[49:28] and if you could just read a little bit
[49:29] but it made him in psyche as the
[49:31] businessman said you know his wife
[49:33] rebecca better branham gives her a name
[49:34] there she was a believer
[49:37] and she was interested in her husband
[49:38] who had a business in jericho and he
[49:41] belonged to many societies of that day
[49:43] no doubt and rebecca had got acquainted
[49:46] with a prophet named jesus of nazareth
[49:48] who they claimed to be the son of god
[49:50] and she was interested in her husband
[49:52] meeting this man
[49:56] [Applause]
[49:58] i don't know what kind of testimony that
[50:00] rebecca had but she told her husband as
[50:03] it were enough to make him want to see
[50:05] jesus
[50:08] is there anybody here this morning wants
[50:10] to see jesus
[50:14] but ibraham i don't have time in the
[50:15] usual time but the man would type out
[50:18] that he didn't sleep good that night
[50:21] but ibrahim said he was struggling to
[50:22] sleep because this thing with jesus was
[50:24] bothering him
[50:26] he said we all go through night
[50:28] sometimes when we can't sleep too good
[50:29] because something's bothering you but
[50:31] ibrahim said it was because his wife was
[50:33] praying for him he wasn't sleeping god
[50:35] because god was disturbing his sleep
[50:38] so when the brother was preaching and he
[50:39] was comforting the people he said
[50:41] sometimes when your sleep is being
[50:42] bothered don't worry about it somebody's
[50:44] praying for you
[50:48] anybody with me this morning
[50:51] but it brought him a typo that maybe he
[50:53] was a late sleeper i can't read all the
[50:56] quotes but everyone said he was a late
[50:57] sleeper because he had a good business
[50:59] and he had people running his business
[51:00] so he didn't have to wake up early but
[51:01] this morning he got up early
[51:04] because he heard that jesus was gonna
[51:06] pass this way
[51:08] [Applause]
[51:10] his wife would ask why you're up so
[51:12] early honey i don't know i just feel
[51:13] like he had some fresh air i'm
[51:14] paraphrasing what the prophet said
[51:16] i want to get some fresh air but she
[51:18] knew in her heart something was working
[51:20] upon
[51:21] upon this man called zacchaeus
[51:24] something was upon him he couldn't help
[51:26] himself he there was something in him
[51:28] that was looking for something
[51:30] he was seeking we read the scripture
[51:32] that he sought to see jesus who he was
[51:35] he had heard many things but he want to
[51:37] see who is who is this man called jesus
[51:41] who is this i don't want to hear about
[51:43] him i don't i want to see him for myself
[51:47] i heard my wife's testimony i heard the
[51:50] brother's testimony i heard the sisters
[51:52] testimony they told me they saw him but
[51:55] i've never seen him and i want to see
[51:58] him
[51:59] for
[52:00] my
[52:01] self
[52:02] anybody with me this morning
[52:04] [Applause]
[52:08] but man i'm dramatized
[52:10] and we'll see it verse 3 and he sought
[52:12] to see jesus who he was and could not
[52:15] for the press the press means a crowd
[52:18] there were so many people around jesus
[52:20] that that he couldn't see him and
[52:22] because he was of little stature he was
[52:24] a short man
[52:27] there was a crowd around jesus but
[52:29] branham said in his mind
[52:32] he would have anticipated if jesus is
[52:34] coming with this crowd i need to do
[52:36] something different because i really
[52:37] want to see jesus
[52:40] verse 4 says and he ran before
[52:45] so he knows jesus is coming but he keeps
[52:47] so he runs ahead of time
[52:49] he goes in advance
[52:51] whatever he had heard about had been
[52:53] enough to convince him to take some very
[52:56] proactive measures
[52:58] he wasn't waiting to jesus to pass by
[53:00] him he wanted to make sure that he saw
[53:02] all that he needed to see so he ran
[53:04] ahead
[53:05] he didn't wait for his wife he didn't
[53:08] ask for permission he didn't say if this
[53:10] is okay to do he didn't wonder what
[53:12] anybody else was doing he wanted to be
[53:15] positioned
[53:16] to get the maximum opportunity to
[53:18] understand if this thing is real i've
[53:21] heard by the hearing of the air but i
[53:23] want to know is this gospel real will it
[53:26] changed my soul will it change my walk
[53:30] will it transform my life will it make
[53:33] me talk different walk different live
[53:35] different
[53:38] anybody with me this morning
[53:40] i'm billing into my thought now
[53:42] but i needed to understand
[53:45] the con what's leading up to this
[53:49] help me lord
[53:50] so he ran before
[53:52] and climbed up into a sycamore tree
[53:56] to see him
[53:58] for he was to pass that way
[54:00] i want to say that one more time for he
[54:02] was
[54:03] to pass
[54:04] that way
[54:06] do you know this morning that
[54:08] he was to pass
[54:11] your will
[54:12] do you realize this morning that he was
[54:16] to pass
[54:18] your way
[54:20] are you in position
[54:22] are you in position because he is about
[54:25] to pass your way
[54:27] are you in position this morning to see
[54:30] the living christ the same yesterday
[54:32] today and forever because he was
[54:36] to
[54:36] pass your way
[54:38] [Applause]
[54:40] billy branham when dramatizing this said
[54:42] that when zacchaeus tried to reach to
[54:44] climb the sycamore tree he couldn't
[54:46] reach it
[54:48] it's in the message go read the books
[54:50] zach yes the businessman but ibrahim
[54:52] said when he tried to reach it he
[54:54] couldn't
[54:55] he said many times he tried to reach
[54:56] things and he can't you got to do
[54:57] something else
[54:58] he said maybe izakiya's got a garbage
[55:01] can
[55:02] because the garbage truck didn't pass
[55:03] that morning
[55:04] and he said zacchaeus was in his best
[55:06] dressed business clothes but that didn't
[55:08] bother him he pulled a garbage can and
[55:10] went on top the garbage can and held on
[55:12] to the to the that low limb because he
[55:14] was a short man to pull himself up
[55:18] but ibrahim would dramatize the
[55:19] neighbors watching isn't that wealthy
[55:21] psychos climbing up on top the garbage
[55:24] pan holding on to the tree what happened
[55:26] to zacchaeus but he didn't business
[55:29] he wanted to see
[55:30] [Music]
[55:31] jesus
[55:34] i didn't come here this morning to hear
[55:36] a good sermon i came to see
[55:40] i didn't come just to meet people that's
[55:41] wonderful but i really came to see
[55:45] anybody with me this morning
[55:49] you may be seated
[55:50] [Applause]
[55:53] i love this part we're building quickly
[55:54] now because this is all the background
[55:56] in my notice is all called background
[56:02] and when jesus came to the place
[56:05] now this reminds me of when the prophet
[56:07] gave the example of when the plane was
[56:09] held back you know where the black man
[56:11] was he was referring it to it as well he
[56:12] said this lady was praying this color
[56:14] lady was praying lord where is your
[56:16] elijah
[56:18] so she is there there's a burden in her
[56:19] soul it's a crying a spirit there's a
[56:21] desire for something and in the meantime
[56:23] god is stopping the whole airport down
[56:25] stopping a plane now to send his elijah
[56:28] the way of this woman because waited a
[56:31] deep call into a deep there gotta be a
[56:32] deep to respond
[56:33] [Applause]
[56:35] and when that that woman saw where they
[56:37] brought him say good morning person
[56:39] he said how you know i'm a person he
[56:41] said because i asked god oh god to send
[56:43] me your elijah and
[56:47] so here it was zacchaeus doesn't even
[56:49] know how this will unfold he just wants
[56:52] to see for himself and the bible says in
[56:54] verse
[56:56] 5 and when jesus came to the place
[57:00] listen carefully he looked up
[57:04] now
[57:05] just to put things in context
[57:07] he looked up and saw him
[57:10] and said unto him now
[57:13] this may seem simple but on a whole
[57:16] level to zacchaeus this is a million
[57:18] levels incredible because for zacchaeus
[57:21] whole life
[57:22] as a short man
[57:24] he
[57:25] is normally used to looking up at people
[57:30] he has very little experience with
[57:33] adults looking up at him
[57:35] maybe children but here it was the man
[57:37] that he was looking for is looking up
[57:41] at him
[57:42] because somehow zacchaeus has positioned
[57:44] himself to look down
[57:46] at jesus
[57:49] and listen to jesus words and he's in
[57:51] them zacchaeus make his and come down
[57:55] in other words i know what you're
[57:56] looking for
[57:58] don't delay
[58:00] you know but the brandon says stand up
[58:01] right now and receive your healing don't
[58:03] even think about it make case and come
[58:04] down whatever you came to get to it
[58:07] quickly
[58:08] don't delay this morning you want to be
[58:10] healed stand up receive a healing right
[58:12] now you want to be set free don't even
[58:14] hesitate reach out raise your hand stand
[58:17] up on your feet and acknowledge that
[58:19] he's the same yesterday quickly don't
[58:21] even think about it don't worry about it
[58:24] make hiss
[58:26] i don't got time to waste
[58:28] oh my
[58:30] hallelujah
[58:32] he's the same yesterday today and
[58:33] forever his mercies never fail he's
[58:36] still a miracle-working god
[58:40] you may be seated
[58:48] zacchaeus and look how god operates it's
[58:50] almost out of i want to say out of
[58:52] character but it's so different in this
[58:54] case
[58:55] because if we read scriptures brother
[58:56] punch where jesus would say i stand at
[58:58] the door and knock
[58:59] and if you're open i'll come
[59:01] but this zacchaeus is different he said
[59:03] zacchaeus make his come down for today i
[59:06] must abide at thy house in other words

[59:10] into your house
[59:11] can you handle it
[59:13] are you ready for it i'm prepared for it
[59:16] i asked a question this morning if jesus
[59:19] was to invite himself into your house
[59:21] and say come quickly you don't have time
[59:23] to run inside and move stuff off your
[59:26] table you don't have time to oh you
[59:28] don't hear me this morning you ain't got
[59:30] time to go and fix the house
[59:35] that's why i asked the question are you
[59:37] ready to see jesus
[59:39] zacchaeus was ready to see jesus and his
[59:43] cry to jesus pull jesus with a pop well
[59:46] from that crowd straight to his address
[59:49] not his home address but the address he
[59:51] was hiding in because he was hiding in a
[59:53] tree to see jesus god didn't go to his
[59:56] physical address he walked up to him and
[59:58] said i know you're up there zacchaeus i
[1:00:00] know why you're here zacchaeus i know
[1:00:02] what you're looking for zacchaeus now if
[1:00:04] you're really serious about this thing

[1:00:09] issues of your life i'm inviting myself

[1:00:18] children i'm inviting myself to
[1:00:21] intervene in your business affairs
[1:00:23] [Applause]
[1:00:26] anybody here this morning
[1:00:28] are we in church this morning are we in
[1:00:31] the presence of the lord this morning
[1:00:32] you may be seated
[1:00:38] and i love it
[1:00:39] and he made
[1:00:41] with six he didn't delay
[1:00:43] and he made haste and come down came
[1:00:46] down and received him joyfully
[1:00:50] and listen to the
[1:00:52] listen to what is happening in the
[1:00:53] meantime
[1:00:55] anybody with me this morning
[1:00:57] and when they saw it
[1:01:00] they
[1:01:01] the people around jesus
[1:01:03] the people who've been following jesus
[1:01:05] the people who love jesus
[1:01:06] when they saw it
[1:01:08] they're all murmured
[1:01:14] they didn't say no to praise
[1:01:16] they didn't say hallelujah another one
[1:01:19] saved
[1:01:20] they didn't say hal remember we talk
[1:01:21] about motive
[1:01:23] what's in your heart it's only when
[1:01:25] something come up to see what's in your
[1:01:26] heart you'll see what's really there
[1:01:28] these whole group of people was like the
[1:01:30] older brother any prodigal son
[1:01:33] why are you getting blessed
[1:01:35] why are you being delivered
[1:01:37] why why jesus talking to him and listen
[1:01:39] it goes on goes on when they saw it they
[1:01:42] all murdered seeing that he was gone to
[1:01:44] be a guest
[1:01:46] with a man
[1:01:47] that is a
[1:01:50] sinner and zacchaeus stood and said unto
[1:01:53] the lord behold lord half of my goods
[1:01:56] i give to the poor
[1:01:58] and if i have taken anything from any
[1:02:00] man by false accusation i restore him
[1:02:02] fourfold
[1:02:04] and jesus said unto him this day is
[1:02:06] salvation come to this house
[1:02:09] [Applause]
[1:02:12] zacchaeus woke up that morning not
[1:02:14] knowing that that day
[1:02:17] salvation
[1:02:18] was coming to his house
[1:02:21] how do you not know that today
[1:02:24] salvation
[1:02:25] has not come
[1:02:27] to your house
[1:02:31] listen for as much
[1:02:33] so jesus is saying now for as much as he
[1:02:35] also so in case he didn't know he also
[1:02:38] is a son of abraham
[1:02:40] and being a son of abraham gives him
[1:02:43] access
[1:02:45] to what i'm giving him so he has just as
[1:02:47] right the fact that he was backslidden
[1:02:50] doesn't change the fact that he is a son
[1:02:52] of abraham the fact that he is messed up
[1:02:55] doesn't change the fact that he is a son
[1:02:57] of abraham the fact that he fell down
[1:03:00] doesn't change the fact that he's a son
[1:03:02] of abraham don't get it twisted don't
[1:03:05] mix up his failures
[1:03:07] with who he is
[1:03:08] don't mix up what he's been through with
[1:03:11] his identity don't mix up his struggles
[1:03:14] with who he is in god
[1:03:19] i hope this helped somebody go free this
[1:03:21] morning i'm not looking at your mistakes
[1:03:24] god is not looking at your mistakes god
[1:03:26] isn't looking at your failures
[1:03:28] he's looking at who you are by
[1:03:30] predestination this morning is this
[1:03:32] helping anybody this morning
[1:03:34] [Applause]
[1:03:37] for as much as he also he also i know
[1:03:41] all of you believers are sons of abraham
[1:03:43] but just in case he didn't know
[1:03:45] zacchaeus although he'd been taxing you
[1:03:48] although even leading all of that stuff
[1:03:50] he is still a son of abraham
[1:03:53] for the son of man
[1:03:55] has come to seek
[1:03:57] and to save
[1:03:59] that which was lost
[1:04:03] and the reason i read this background
[1:04:05] because this is the ghetto where i
[1:04:06] really want to get this morning
[1:04:08] that's just the preamble
[1:04:10] we need to connect it because of the way
[1:04:13] it is expressed in scripture for the
[1:04:15] bible says in verse 11
[1:04:17] as they heard these things
[1:04:20] so jesus is actually about to teach
[1:04:24] so not only is it salvation to
[1:04:27] zacchaeus's house but he is using what
[1:04:30] they witnessed as a teaching moment
[1:04:34] don't miss this now
[1:04:35] because the bible said in verse 11 as
[1:04:37] they heard these things he added
[1:04:41] so he is building on the foundation of
[1:04:43] what just happened with zacchaeus and he
[1:04:45] added and speak a parable
[1:04:49] and it's the parable is what we really
[1:04:51] want to focus on to bring this message
[1:04:54] home
[1:04:55] this morning
[1:04:56] now a parable is a story
[1:05:01] and jesus used many parables
[1:05:04] this parable we are about to read is the
[1:05:06] last parable
[1:05:09] that jesus would teach
[1:05:11] i remember preaching a message some
[1:05:13] years ago the last words of
[1:05:16] joshua
[1:05:17] and i was referencing last words that
[1:05:19] when people are about to leave they're
[1:05:22] very careful with what they say
[1:05:24] jesus taught many parables so i went out
[1:05:27] to sow
[1:05:28] the the foolish version the wise
[1:05:30] version all these were parables the
[1:05:32] parable of the good samaritan
[1:05:35] even a parable of the good samaritan
[1:05:37] jesus was using the journey of jericho
[1:05:40] to jerusalem that was the street he was
[1:05:41] describing with the good samaritan jesus
[1:05:44] was about to take that very road of the
[1:05:45] good samaritan because he was in jericho
[1:05:47] heading to jerusalem
[1:05:50] but out of all the parables that jesus
[1:05:52] taught here it is right after zacchaeus
[1:05:54] situation god jesus is about to give his
[1:05:58] last parable before he gets ready to
[1:06:00] leave
[1:06:01] out of all the parables that jesus would
[1:06:04] bring i wonder which one would be his
[1:06:06] last
[1:06:09] and if there's anything unique about
[1:06:10] that parable that could help us
[1:06:13] understand the mind of god
[1:06:16] because parables jesus was interested
[1:06:18] because they are parables he used and he
[1:06:20] was talking about himself and he didn't
[1:06:21] tell him it was himself
[1:06:23] so i went now to sow who was he talking
[1:06:25] about
[1:06:31] you speaking about himself
[1:06:33] he didn't tell them that outright he
[1:06:35] used it he'd give a story because
[1:06:37] stories help people connect with things
[1:06:40] anybody with me so let's build
[1:06:42] and as they heard these things
[1:06:44] in context of what just happened with
[1:06:46] zacchaeus
[1:06:47] he added and speak a parable listen
[1:06:51] because because means he is doing it for
[1:06:54] a reason
[1:06:55] and he gives the reason why he is given
[1:06:57] the parallel because two things he was
[1:06:59] nigh to jerusalem
[1:07:01] that's one because so he's saying this
[1:07:03] is the parable that i've given because
[1:07:05] i'm really close to jerusalem now so i
[1:07:06] have to give it before i could go
[1:07:08] further and two because they thought
[1:07:11] that the kingdom of god should
[1:07:12] immediately appear
[1:07:14] so the believers who are around jesus
[1:07:17] were in a mindset with a punch that when
[1:07:20] we get to jerusalem this thing is all
[1:07:21] over
[1:07:23] the kingdom would be here
[1:07:25] and because he was so near jerusalem he
[1:07:27] didn't want to enter jerusalem with them
[1:07:29] having the wrong idea of what this was
[1:07:31] about and what was about to unfold bear
[1:07:33] in mind his entry into jerusalem after
[1:07:35] this is hosanna hosanna that's how you
[1:07:37] would enter jerusalem after this context
[1:07:39] that we're in
[1:07:42] so he goes into it he said there for a
[1:07:43] certain nobleman this is the parable
[1:07:46] a certain nobleman went into a far
[1:07:49] country
[1:07:50] so nobleman nobleman to be a woman is
[1:07:52] royal but noble boat
[1:07:55] all right so we know who he's talking
[1:07:56] about right a certain nobleman
[1:07:58] royal but went into a far country
[1:08:00] to receive himself a kingdom
[1:08:02] so without saying that it's a king
[1:08:04] because only a king could receive a
[1:08:06] kingdom
[1:08:07] so a nobleman he's trying to give them a
[1:08:09] story went into a far country to receive
[1:08:12] for himself a kingdom
[1:08:14] and to return
[1:08:16] does this sound familiar
[1:08:19] and he called his ten servants
[1:08:21] and delivered them 10 pounds
[1:08:25] and in another translation that pounds
[1:08:27] is referred to as a meanest
[1:08:30] and said unto them occupy
[1:08:33] is not what the prophet said occupy
[1:08:35] till i come
[1:08:38] so amina is equivalent to about a
[1:08:40] hundred days salary
[1:08:43] a hundred days wages
[1:08:46] and he gives each of these men brother
[1:08:48] clarence the same thing
[1:08:51] i want to draw reference friends this is
[1:08:53] not the parable of the talents
[1:08:56] in the parable of the talents brother
[1:08:59] marlon he gave one man five talents
[1:09:02] isn't that right he gave another man
[1:09:04] what two
[1:09:05] and he gave one one so he was given
[1:09:08] measures based on their abilities
[1:09:11] but this parable is different
[1:09:15] so this is not a parable of talents
[1:09:18] in this parable he gives them all the
[1:09:21] same thing
[1:09:24] he gives them all the same
[1:09:26] responsibility
[1:09:28] he gives them all the same bible
[1:09:31] he gives them all the same message he
[1:09:33] gave them all the same promises he gave
[1:09:36] them all the same word and says do
[1:09:39] something with this thing he gives them
[1:09:41] all life
[1:09:43] he gives them all the same thing and in
[1:09:46] the amplified it says do business with
[1:09:49] this until i return
[1:09:51] in other words put it to use
[1:09:53] make profit with it don't sit down in
[1:09:56] life and say you have nothing to do i'm
[1:09:58] giving you life for a reason i'm giving
[1:10:00] you the word for a reason i'm giving you
[1:10:02] these things for a reason
[1:10:04] and do something with it
[1:10:07] until i return
[1:10:10] that's your responsibility because when
[1:10:12] i return
[1:10:13] i will want you to give an
[1:10:14] account of what you did with it
[1:10:17] anybody with me
[1:10:19] let's move on
[1:10:23] but his servants hated him
[1:10:25] are we reading
[1:10:27] this 14 this servants that is being
[1:10:29] referred to here is not the ten he gave
[1:10:33] the pounds to or demeanors to
[1:10:35] these are the citizens of the kingdom
[1:10:38] that he went to get
[1:10:41] so jesus in this type here this nobleman
[1:10:44] is going to get a kingdom to receive but
[1:10:46] the people he goes to get refuse and
[1:10:47] reject him
[1:10:50] so is it a rejected king
[1:10:52] a rejected nobleman
[1:10:54] anybody with me all right so the
[1:10:56] citizens as it were
[1:10:58] hated him and sent a message after him
[1:11:00] saying we will not have this man to
[1:11:02] reign over us in other words we don't
[1:11:04] want this king
[1:11:06] it's a rebellious spirit
[1:11:07] we don't want the king tell us how to
[1:11:09] live we don't want the king to tell us
[1:11:12] how we should pray and what we should do
[1:11:14] and how we should operate
[1:11:17] they don't want headship they don't want
[1:11:18] leadership they want to do things their
[1:11:20] own way
[1:11:21] look look this is the last parable the
[1:11:23] last one jesus is doing before he heads
[1:11:25] to calvary
[1:11:27] and look at the magnitude of what he's
[1:11:29] teaching
[1:11:33] we will not have this man to reign over
[1:11:35] us
[1:11:36] and it came to pass that when he was
[1:11:38] returned having received the kingdom
[1:11:41] he still received the kingdom then he
[1:11:43] commanded these servants to be called on
[1:11:45] to him to whom he had given the money
[1:11:49] he was away for a season he comes back
[1:11:52] now and he had left him with work to do
[1:11:54] and he comes back now he left him with
[1:11:56] the responsibility and come back now
[1:11:59] left him with children perhaps come back
[1:12:02] now left him to pray and come back no
[1:12:05] left him to read the word and come
[1:12:07] anybody getting it
[1:12:10] left then we spoke with books
[1:12:13] come back now
[1:12:14] left them with a great message come back
[1:12:16] now
[1:12:19] that he might know how much every man
[1:12:23] had gained from trading
[1:12:26] what was your profit
[1:12:28] what have you earned
[1:12:30] what have you done with this gospel
[1:12:32] the children i put into your hands how
[1:12:34] have you helped mold them and mentor
[1:12:36] them and shape them the marriage that
[1:12:38] started years ago as a seed how was it
[1:12:40] grown oh help me this morning
[1:12:43] anybody with me
[1:12:48] and this is natural and spiritual i
[1:12:50] could preach the whole natural side of
[1:12:51] this as well you could see god jesus in
[1:12:53] teaching saying listen if you have a
[1:12:55] business and you have a starting point i
[1:12:56] expect to see more when i come back you
[1:12:58] know
[1:12:59] because the bible says
[1:13:01] how much you gain from your trading
[1:13:03] so god expects profits he expects
[1:13:05] results he expects returns he don't
[1:13:07] expect to see the same thing
[1:13:12] then came the first saying and remember
[1:13:13] i'm saying this is not the talent so
[1:13:15] it's not five bring it back five two
[1:13:17] bring about two and the one ring mark
[1:13:18] the one this is now they all have the
[1:13:20] same thing they start at the same point
[1:13:23] they all have life they all have access
[1:13:25] to the word they all have access to
[1:13:27] church this morning we all in this room
[1:13:29] are in the same place
[1:13:31] that's this message here this morning i
[1:13:32] wanted to get this same starting point
[1:13:35] all start off in sin
[1:13:38] born and sin shaped in iniquity i'm no
[1:13:41] better than you you are no better than
[1:13:43] me we are the same starting point but
[1:13:45] god is coming back to see know that i've
[1:13:47] exposed you to what i've done for you
[1:13:49] where is the fruit
[1:13:51] where is the prophet
[1:13:53] where's my where's my my evidence that
[1:13:55] you are a good steward that you're a
[1:13:57] good servant anybody with me this
[1:13:58] morning can we can we take some more
[1:14:04] and the first thing lord dipowned by one
[1:14:07] pound or that one minus had gained 10
[1:14:11] he 10x the investment
[1:14:13] he said give me one look is ten so this
[1:14:16] is this is different talents now it's
[1:14:17] not five to ten this is one to ten
[1:14:20] only reading it
[1:14:22] this one you gave me is ten
[1:14:26] and he said unto him so listen listen to
[1:14:29] my title now listen to my title
[1:14:33] you remember i asked the question
[1:14:35] what will you say to him
[1:14:38] what will you say to him and what will
[1:14:39] he say to you so this first servant in
[1:14:42] response to the question what have you
[1:14:44] done
[1:14:45] he came saying lord
[1:14:47] thy pawn had gave 10 pounds
[1:14:49] that was his response
[1:14:51] and god's response him well
[1:14:53] thou good servant because thou has been
[1:14:57] faithful
[1:14:58] in a very little
[1:15:01] without even being asked by the antwine
[1:15:04] or without the servant knowing what to
[1:15:06] expect
[1:15:07] from his faithfulness
[1:15:09] look at god's response to his
[1:15:11] faithfulness he says have thou authority
[1:15:15] over ten cities
[1:15:18] so he moved from managing now
[1:15:21] money
[1:15:22] one pound to 10 pounds to now managing
[1:15:25] 10 cities
[1:15:26] so the real so there's a reward and the
[1:15:28] reward is actually more work
[1:15:33] because it's one thing to manage money
[1:15:36] it's a whole other level of
[1:15:37] administration to manage a city
[1:15:40] i want you to see how jesus is thinking
[1:15:43] so when i am pushing for a spirit of
[1:15:45] excellence and you need to do more and i
[1:15:47] just think like managers because you are
[1:15:49] sons and daughters royalty in the
[1:15:50] economy of god you understand what i'm
[1:15:52] pushing for so god said because you've
[1:15:54] been faithful and taken one pound i'm
[1:15:56] making it ten pounds i'm going to reward
[1:15:58] you with more work
[1:16:03] i'm going to bless you with a reward but
[1:16:05] within the reward with the marlon
[1:16:07] there's more responsibility
[1:16:08] i'm gonna give you 10 cities
[1:16:11] in a city have people in a city have
[1:16:13] resources in a city have issues inner
[1:16:15] cities have things to manage
[1:16:17] anybody with me
[1:16:18] can we go on
[1:16:21] i'm using this because this this is
[1:16:22] there's so many levels to build off of
[1:16:24] this
[1:16:27] and the second came saying lord thy pawn
[1:16:29] had gained five pounds
[1:16:31] and he said likewise to him be thou also
[1:16:34] over five cities
[1:16:37] so he get rewarded he did something with
[1:16:39] it
[1:16:40] and another came
[1:16:41] saying lord behold here is thy pound
[1:16:49] which i have kept
[1:16:51] laid up in a napkin
[1:16:53] i kept it in an envelope
[1:16:55] i kept it in a box
[1:17:00] look at jesus response
[1:17:03] well in fact in every jail because he
[1:17:05] justifies for i fear thee
[1:17:08] because thou art an austere man
[1:17:11] don't take us up that down later it's
[1:17:13] not down
[1:17:14] and reapers that thou didn't sow
[1:17:18] and the nobleman says
[1:17:20] and he said unto him out of thine own
[1:17:22] mouth will i judge thee the wicked
[1:17:24] servant
[1:17:27] don't knew is that i was austere man
[1:17:30] taking them that i leave not done and
[1:17:31] reaping what i did not so
[1:17:33] wherefore then in other words if you
[1:17:35] think i was a problem and i was this
[1:17:37] fearful and this bad you should have
[1:17:39] been more more afraid
[1:17:41] because you're telling me you was scared
[1:17:43] and he didn't do anything about it but
[1:17:45] he was really scared this is what is
[1:17:47] being said here you're telling me he was
[1:17:48] afraid if he was really afraid then you
[1:17:50] shouldn't be desperate to do something
[1:17:51] with it
[1:17:53] listen and listen to jesus this is jesus
[1:17:56] teaching now this is not the prophet
[1:17:58] this is not brother branham this is
[1:17:59] jesus's teaching here
[1:18:02] wherefore then in other words the least
[1:18:04] i expected from you
[1:18:05] wherefore then gave us not though my
[1:18:08] money into the bank
[1:18:13] that at my coming i might have required
[1:18:16] my own usury so jesus same the minimum
[1:18:20] the minimum
[1:18:22] that i would have considered was at
[1:18:24] least interest but don't give me the
[1:18:26] same thing
[1:18:28] even because listen there's a difference
[1:18:29] in accounting between interest and
[1:18:30] profits huh
[1:18:33] you can take money and put it in the
[1:18:34] bank and make interest to make profit
[1:18:36] need to take money and do something with
[1:18:37] it like buy product and sell it for
[1:18:38] something else to make a profit she said
[1:18:40] if you couldn't make a profit with it
[1:18:42] the least i expected what i gave you
[1:18:44] is interest
[1:18:46] put it in the bank
[1:18:50] bare minimum
[1:18:54] this is that my teaching this number the
[1:18:56] branham teacher and this is jesus
[1:18:57] teaching
[1:18:59] this is back to the bible
[1:19:05] verse 24 and he said unto them that
[1:19:07] stood by so you see jesus have no
[1:19:09] problem using the bank right
[1:19:11] now
[1:19:13] just putting it out there
[1:19:15] are quoting jesus he'd have an issue
[1:19:16] with the banking system you'd obviously
[1:19:18] bank
[1:19:22] i want to put certain things to rest
[1:19:25] because people don't know the bible
[1:19:27] spin the prophet's message into all kind
[1:19:28] of different directions to tire people's
[1:19:30] mind this is jesus teaching
[1:19:37] and he said unto them that stood by
[1:19:39] listen to the response
[1:19:41] of the man who couldn't even put it in
[1:19:42] the bank
[1:19:43] take from him the pound take everything
[1:19:45] from him
[1:19:46] and give it to him that had 10 pounds
[1:19:53] and listen even in the parable jesus is
[1:19:56] showing the issue people had he said and
[1:19:58] they said unto him lord but he already
[1:20:00] had 10 pounds
[1:20:05] verse 26 4 i say unto you that unto
[1:20:07] everyone which hath
[1:20:10] shall be given in other words for those
[1:20:11] of you who have and you're pressing and
[1:20:13] you're working and you're tarrying and
[1:20:15] you're praying and you're pressing you
[1:20:17] have more coming yeah don't worry about
[1:20:19] it you have more coming he knows your
[1:20:21] prayer he sees your sacrifice you're
[1:20:22] pressing you're praying you're fighting
[1:20:25] you're contending you have more to get
[1:20:26] he gonna give you more
[1:20:30] and from him that hath not you're not
[1:20:32] doing nothing
[1:20:33] because i gave you before you know but
[1:20:35] now you have nothing
[1:20:36] even that that he had shall be taken
[1:20:39] away from him
[1:20:42] and then the parable ends with jesus
[1:20:44] addressing rejecting people he said but
[1:20:47] those mine enemies
[1:20:48] which would not that i should reign over
[1:20:51] them
[1:20:52] bring
[1:20:54] their and slay them before me complete
[1:20:56] judgment
[1:20:58] may the lord have a blessing to the
[1:21:00] reading of his word
[1:21:02] can we bring this home can we bring the
[1:21:03] sir close
[1:21:13] what will you say to him
[1:21:15] what will he say to you
[1:21:17] friends
[1:21:19] we all have to give an account
[1:21:23] because we have been given
[1:21:25] something
[1:21:28] on a very basic level we have been given
[1:21:29] life
[1:21:31] and we have to give an account for that
[1:21:32] life because we didn't give ourselves
[1:21:33] life
[1:21:34] so there's already no excuse
[1:21:37] because you didn't give yourself life
[1:21:39] you have to give an account to who gave
[1:21:40] you the life
[1:21:43] but beyond that for us in here this
[1:21:44] morning and those connected he has given
[1:21:46] us a message
[1:21:48] a word
[1:21:49] a way of escape
[1:21:51] a way out he has given promises
[1:21:54] and we have to give an account
[1:21:56] we have to give an answer for what we
[1:21:58] have done with this thing
[1:22:01] and more than that as my inspiration did
[1:22:03] i give i give my title
[1:22:05] my subject the judgment seat of christ
[1:22:07] we all have to deal with the judgment
[1:22:10] seat
[1:22:11] of christ
[1:22:13] now the judgment seat of christ is not
[1:22:14] the white throne judgment
[1:22:18] so i want to make a distinction as we
[1:22:20] raise this so close in the interest of
[1:22:22] time
[1:22:23] we are judged as sinners when we were
[1:22:25] judged with christ on calvary
[1:22:28] so i'm not dealing with being saved or
[1:22:30] not saved now i'm kind of building last
[1:22:33] two sundays ago when i preach about do
[1:22:35] not cross the line i was dealing with
[1:22:36] with sin and not sin and on this line
[1:22:38] and this line this is now a different
[1:22:40] story now i'm coming home to believers
[1:22:43] so the issue i'm not dealing with now is
[1:22:45] salvation or making it or even making
[1:22:46] the rapture now
[1:22:49] because you are judged as a sinner
[1:22:50] that's what calvary deals with your
[1:22:52] judgment as a son is what the tutor
[1:22:54] manages
[1:22:56] because when you're born again and
[1:22:57] you're walking in your sunshine true
[1:22:58] place of trying that is the judgment of
[1:23:01] the tutor to how your behavior and
[1:23:02] conduct is
[1:23:04] and it's based on that judgment you are
[1:23:06] now a candidate for adoption anybody
[1:23:08] with me
[1:23:09] so your judgment as a sinner is calvary
[1:23:11] your judgment as a son is through the
[1:23:14] process of place of trying so because
[1:23:16] you are born and being positionally born
[1:23:20] but i'm not even speaking about that
[1:23:22] this morning
[1:23:24] i'm going beyond that because you could
[1:23:26] be judged as a sinner you can be judged
[1:23:27] as a son but you are also judged as a
[1:23:29] servant
[1:23:32] and your judgment as a servant is the
[1:23:35] judgment of the seat of christ
[1:23:38] the judgment seat of christ is not about
[1:23:41] salvation or adoption it's about rewards
[1:23:46] what rewards will you get
[1:23:49] because our responsibility is as a
[1:23:51] christian as a son but there's a way
[1:23:53] that we can do things that get certain
[1:23:55] rewards
[1:23:58] anybody with me this morning
[1:24:00] you're running we all running the racino
[1:24:03] and listen when you cross you race
[1:24:06] you win
[1:24:07] you make it but how did you run your
[1:24:09] race
[1:24:10] what reward
[1:24:12] are you going to get
[1:24:14] after you run
[1:24:15] your race
[1:24:16] anybody with me this morning i want to
[1:24:18] build a little bit
[1:24:21] it's our responsibility
[1:24:24] to run the race
[1:24:26] how we run the race is about
[1:24:28] accountability can we take a little more
[1:24:31] listen to paul in hebrews 12 verse one
[1:24:34] wherefore seeing that we also are
[1:24:36] compass about with so great a cloud of
[1:24:39] witnesses
[1:24:40] listen let us lay aside now he's
[1:24:43] speaking to this is hebrews there guys
[1:24:46] hebrews this is believers
[1:24:48] let us listen lay aside
[1:24:51] every weight
[1:24:52] and the sin
[1:24:54] which that so easily beset us
[1:24:57] and let us run with patience the rate
[1:24:59] that is set before us
[1:25:01] so he's saying we're running a race but
[1:25:03] there are two things
[1:25:05] that we can lay aside
[1:25:06] we delay aside every week
[1:25:08] and the sin
[1:25:10] so there are people in here who need to
[1:25:11] lay a sight sin
[1:25:14] you have work to do do it quickly get
[1:25:15] rid of it because you're holding us back
[1:25:21] anybody with me
[1:25:22] because we can't go through the rapture
[1:25:23] without you so fix it
[1:25:25] it's exactly us with his make his clean
[1:25:27] your life up you need to repent
[1:25:30] get get get that in order
[1:25:32] because we want to go beyond repentance
[1:25:35] and go into the reward part of the thing
[1:25:38] the blessing part of the thing the crown
[1:25:40] party thing the jewels in a crown party
[1:25:43] thing anybody with me this morning
[1:25:45] we don't want to just run the race and
[1:25:46] say well i run and i'll barely make it
[1:25:48] no i want when i run this oh gosh give
[1:25:51] him a prize
[1:25:52] he run the race so well give him
[1:25:55] something extra
[1:25:56] he make it to no but give him something
[1:25:58] extra give him an extra reward with a
[1:26:00] punch
[1:26:02] so how did paul say do that he said lay
[1:26:04] aside two things so there are those here
[1:26:06] who
[1:26:07] they don't lay a sight singing all day
[1:26:08] did that don't bother them but you see
[1:26:10] the weight
[1:26:11] oh gosh
[1:26:13] is it just distraction it's what kind of
[1:26:15] thing holy no you know you're running
[1:26:17] the eraser but oh gosh you're dragging
[1:26:18] this foot you're dragging this foot
[1:26:20] because the cell phone is he neighbor is
[1:26:22] he politics is this brother it's his
[1:26:24] sister and all his weight
[1:26:28] so paul is saying let me run if you lay
[1:26:30] off sin then lay off all the weight
[1:26:32] every distraction
[1:26:33] anything that will slow you down in
[1:26:35] other words i want you to run faster
[1:26:37] because how you run the race i want you
[1:26:39] to know there are some rewards to the
[1:26:41] overcomers there are some rewards based
[1:26:44] on how you run the race can the church
[1:26:47] say amen
[1:26:54] so i'm not wondering if you're going to
[1:26:55] make it if you're going to get saved and
[1:26:56] i'll deal with if you get to the rapture
[1:26:58] i'm dealing with when you get there
[1:27:00] you still have to deal with the judgment
[1:27:01] seat of
[1:27:02] christ to give an account for the things
[1:27:05] we have done in this life
[1:27:07] because based on that account
[1:27:11] what you say
[1:27:12] god will respond
[1:27:14] anybody with me this morning
[1:27:16] listen to the prophet i'm going to get
[1:27:18] ready to close out soon
[1:27:20] musicians you could start to slowly get
[1:27:21] ready
[1:27:25] in the message who i believe or report
[1:27:27] listen to the brother branham and the
[1:27:29] sincerity and dear christian friends
[1:27:31] i may be having my last american
[1:27:33] meetings for all i know
[1:27:34] i'm going overseas now and i feel the
[1:27:36] call to finish up my journey overseas in
[1:27:38] africa and the different parts of the
[1:27:40] world i don't know when i can be back
[1:27:42] again it will only be through the will
[1:27:44] of god and whatever he chose me to do
[1:27:47] and i love you and i know someday
[1:27:50] so for those who are wondering about
[1:27:51] judgment someday i must stand at the
[1:27:54] judgment seat of christ to give an
[1:27:57] account for the things we have done
[1:27:59] in this life
[1:28:01] friends
[1:28:02] you could make the rapture and did a
[1:28:04] horrible job as a parent
[1:28:09] because the issue may not be your soul
[1:28:11] you know but the account of giving an
[1:28:13] account
[1:28:14] of what god put in your responsibility
[1:28:17] you could have done better
[1:28:19] it may not have been you did a bad job
[1:28:20] you know
[1:28:22] but you could have done more
[1:28:25] oh i'm pushing higher now
[1:28:27] it is not that you are a horrible parent
[1:28:28] and you did wrong things you know the
[1:28:30] real question is was that your best
[1:28:34] because in giving an account it's about
[1:28:36] you
[1:28:37] reporting back on how well he did a job
[1:28:39] because if you did a b b-plus and he
[1:28:41] could do an a
[1:28:44] god knows it
[1:28:46] anybody with me
[1:28:51] listen to the prophet again
[1:28:53] in the faith i was once delivered to the
[1:28:55] scenes
[1:28:56] now there be there may be many things
[1:28:58] that i do not know but i do know jesus
[1:29:00] christ this is the prophet
[1:29:02] i do with the bottom of my heart
[1:29:05] and someday i've got to meet everyone at
[1:29:07] you at the judgment seat of christ i've
[1:29:09] got to stand it that's right i've got to
[1:29:11] give an account for what i say and do
[1:29:14] so if i'm in error it's sincere i don't
[1:29:17] mean it so listen to the prophet now
[1:29:18] being conscious that he has to give an
[1:29:21] account
[1:29:22] as a pastor but over has to give an
[1:29:24] account as an assistant pastor i have to
[1:29:26] give an account the deacons ministers
[1:29:28] parents have to give an account
[1:29:30] in your job you have to give an account
[1:29:32] you can have a responsibility and do a
[1:29:34] horrible job and you all know it you
[1:29:35] have co-workers who are horrible
[1:29:38] the responsibility is your job
[1:29:40] description the accountability is how
[1:29:41] well you do your job
[1:29:43] [Music]
[1:29:45] you have a child you automatically have
[1:29:48] the responsibility as a parent but we
[1:29:50] all know horrible parents
[1:29:54] the issue is that knowing about the
[1:29:56] responsibility the issue is can you give
[1:29:58] an account for what kind of parent you
[1:30:00] are
[1:30:02] that's why brother branham said god
[1:30:04] don't make halfway preachers but a
[1:30:06] preacher could be halfway the
[1:30:08] responsibility is to preach but when
[1:30:10] they have to give an account they give
[1:30:11] an account of being a halfway preacher
[1:30:13] god don't make halfway christians but a
[1:30:15] christian could be halfway
[1:30:18] the responsibility is a christian but
[1:30:20] when you come to give an account what
[1:30:22] are you going to say
[1:30:25] i heard somebody say it'll be
[1:30:26] embarrassing for some of us
[1:30:28] when we hear other people at the
[1:30:30] judgment seat of christ saying lord
[1:30:33] have testified i've helped people and
[1:30:34] you have
[1:30:35] nothing to say
[1:30:37] you may have overcome but you never
[1:30:39] testify to nobody
[1:30:41] you never help nobody
[1:30:43] your whole world is about you
[1:30:45] and here it was we read jesus would have
[1:30:47] left
[1:30:48] and take a journey through jericho
[1:30:51] because he had to pick up zacchaeus
[1:30:54] all along his journey he was about
[1:30:56] deliverance and salvation even to people
[1:30:58] who the the the normal believers thought
[1:31:00] wasn't supposed to be saved
[1:31:02] because if you would ask those believers
[1:31:04] or listening that you talk to zacchaeus
[1:31:05] they say no not a sinner because when
[1:31:07] jesus say i go in to show you how their
[1:31:10] confidence in jesus was questionable it
[1:31:12] was
[1:31:13] because jesus went and looked in moment
[1:31:16] they were not with the program you know
[1:31:17] i want you to picture this
[1:31:19] they reach this is one week before the
[1:31:21] crucifixion and they're not really fully
[1:31:23] with the program you know
[1:31:25] because when jesus looked to go into
[1:31:27] zakiyah so they say look he go in the
[1:31:28] house of a sinner i agree with that you
[1:31:30] know i'm not sure the past don't know
[1:31:31] what he's doing this morning
[1:31:33] that's that that's what that's what
[1:31:34] that's what it was
[1:31:37] i with jesus and nobody see that program
[1:31:39] that brother zacchaeus he's with this
[1:31:40] morning i am not with that
[1:31:43] i am in jesus's church but there are
[1:31:44] certain things in the church i don't
[1:31:46] agree with one thing i could tell you to
[1:31:47] agree with is him meeting with brother
[1:31:49] zacchaeus
[1:31:50] you know how much taxes he take from me
[1:31:52] he overtaxed me last year the year
[1:31:53] before that the year before that i put
[1:31:55] in an appeal zacchaeus get over here and
[1:31:57] here it is jesus with brother zacchaeus
[1:32:02] anybody with me this morning
[1:32:04] thank god jesus doesn't think the way we
[1:32:06] think thank god he doesn't look through
[1:32:09] the eyes of man and when he saw
[1:32:11] zacchaeus he saw a son and when
[1:32:12] zacchaeus saw jesus he saw lord
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:16] anybody with me this morning
[1:32:20] because jesus himself had to give an
[1:32:22] account
[1:32:23] he said all that the father had given me
[1:32:24] muscle i have a responsibility for all
[1:32:26] that the father has given me
[1:32:29] can we can we finish up
[1:32:31] listen to the prophet in dealing with
[1:32:33] his
[1:32:34] understanding of his own accountability
[1:32:36] before i close out
[1:32:38] in 1961 the six-fold purpose of
[1:32:40] gabriel's visit to daniel
[1:32:43] listen to the prophet there was for
[1:32:44] about i guess the first three or four
[1:32:46] years of my ministry right here at the
[1:32:49] tabernacle i wouldn't even preach on the
[1:32:52] subject of hell because i couldn't make
[1:32:55] out whether it was a burning place
[1:32:57] whether it was a grave and every time
[1:32:59] the word spoke grave i'd get the
[1:33:01] translation said hades hades is the
[1:33:03] grave
[1:33:04] every time it spoke of hell hate is good
[1:33:06] when i just left it alone till i really
[1:33:08] found out what i was speaking about then
[1:33:11] i preached on hell
[1:33:13] so when i really found out the whole
[1:33:15] picture and seeing where it was at
[1:33:18] because i feel that a minister is
[1:33:20] responsible to god what he tells that
[1:33:22] congregation
[1:33:24] because they're going to hold right onto
[1:33:26] that and so then what if i've got them
[1:33:28] holding on the wrong place and then the
[1:33:31] time comes when that won't hold when
[1:33:33] that whole one's done and in the vision
[1:33:36] that the lord gave me some time ago with
[1:33:37] those millions when that one speaking to
[1:33:40] me said you'll be judged first by the
[1:33:42] gospel you preach
[1:33:44] i said i preach the same thing paul did
[1:33:46] and the rest of them and all those
[1:33:49] millions of voices screamed out we are
[1:33:51] resting on that
[1:33:52] anybody with me this morning so i want
[1:33:54] you to understand it's the sincerity
[1:33:57] of you given an account as a christian
[1:33:59] of you being able to give an answer as a
[1:34:01] son as a daughter
[1:34:06] lord help us

[1:34:25] take the place of a boss i'm no boss
[1:34:28] but i feel to you like paul said back
[1:34:30] there about his congregation once you
[1:34:32] are the stars
[1:34:33] in my crown
[1:34:34] meaning the reward

[1:34:54] quickly and my reward is with me
[1:34:59] to give every man according as his work
[1:35:03] shall be what is your work
[1:35:05] what what account will you give of your
[1:35:07] life on this earth
[1:35:11] will your testimony be well i serve the
[1:35:13] law but but my my when but in my job
[1:35:15] nobody knows a christian is that the
[1:35:16] account you're going to give
[1:35:23] did i live my life and i and i never
[1:35:24] really tried to win my son when my
[1:35:26] daughter
[1:35:27] when my neighbor
[1:35:29] i never really i could have done more
[1:35:30] you know
[1:35:31] but i just never did is that your
[1:35:33] account
[1:35:35] is that your answer
[1:35:38] i know for me i want to be able to say
[1:35:39] lord i did everything
[1:35:41] i poured out all i could
[1:35:43] when i was tired whether i was sick
[1:35:45] without i guess whatever i could do i
[1:35:47] could do for the kingdom because only
[1:35:48] what has done for the king i would last
[1:35:49] dinner
[1:35:54] you know but a man i'm thought of giving
[1:35:55] up the ministry
[1:35:59] america was making excuses you know he
[1:36:01] was actually using scripture to justify
[1:36:03] quitting
[1:36:05] you know that
[1:36:07] let me see if i can just read it at it
[1:36:09] here and remember he had a dream
[1:36:12] and in a dream he didn't realize until
[1:36:14] what it was but in the dream he had this
[1:36:15] she saw this man and this man became a a
[1:36:17] viet grant a bomb and these two
[1:36:19] different things and he realized it was
[1:36:20] him
[1:36:21] in that was he was dreaming about right
[1:36:24] and god said to him carry out your plans
[1:36:26] because he says i feel i want to just go
[1:36:28] and hunt
[1:36:30] and he say well and elijah of old was a
[1:36:32] hunter
[1:36:35] and he used that punch to kind of as an
[1:36:38] exit now maybe i just don't spend my
[1:36:39] time in the trees like elijah because he
[1:36:40] was going to get away from the people
[1:36:42] and god said listen carry out your plans
[1:36:44] you're on the one hunt and go any forest
[1:36:46] and ignore your ministry work in other
[1:36:48] words you have a responsibility you know
[1:36:49] but but
[1:36:50] how are you going to give an account for
[1:36:52] your responsibility in your office
[1:36:54] anybody with me this morning
[1:36:57] listen to
[1:36:58] it here go to prophet he said carry out
[1:37:01] your plans and you'll be like that
[1:37:03] i said lord i don't want to be like that
[1:37:05] he said your wife will go too so god
[1:37:08] told the prophet if you quit the
[1:37:09] ministry your wife will leave you
[1:37:13] you'll end up vagrant
[1:37:15] because i gave you a responsibility not
[1:37:18] only are you accountable there are
[1:37:19] consequences for you not fulfilling the
[1:37:21] responsibility that i give you
[1:37:27] you have a responsibility as a father as
[1:37:29] a mother as a believer as a deacon as a
[1:37:31] son whatever it is don't you think there
[1:37:33] are consequences
[1:37:37] to when god has an expectation of what
[1:37:39] you do for him
[1:37:43] listen to brother branham here
[1:37:46] this is in
[1:37:47] june this is june 23 1963.
[1:37:51] so
[1:37:52] he said your wife will go to she won't
[1:37:54] live up there in them hills like that
[1:37:57] do you want to live in the forest and
[1:37:59] hunt like elijah old
[1:38:02] your wife not handling that
[1:38:05] if you could handle that that's one
[1:38:06] thing by telling you go tell your wife
[1:38:09] and live in jungle with
[1:38:11] with you
[1:38:12] and you'll become a bomb just as the
[1:38:14] dream showed you would
[1:38:20] you see the thing of is not all of us
[1:38:22] have the opportunity for god to show us
[1:38:23] what will happen when we do what we're
[1:38:25] not supposed to do or we ignore what
[1:38:26] we're supposed to do we are not all
[1:38:28] given that opportunity to get you
[1:38:30] warning
[1:38:32] but but a brand i'm got the warning
[1:38:35] so i want you to take the warning for
[1:38:36] your life right now about you have a
[1:38:38] responsibility to pray a responsibility
[1:38:40] to word our responsibility and
[1:38:42] sanctification our responsibility to god
[1:38:44] our responsibility to the church
[1:38:47] and when you walk away you see some of
[1:38:49] us we know the work thing you know
[1:38:50] originally to walk you get right up you
[1:38:52] miss a deer you have to bring in sick
[1:38:53] leave hunting
[1:38:55] your understanding naturally about where
[1:38:57] god is well his church is a is it
[1:39:00] don't you know this is more important
[1:39:01] than your job
[1:39:06] people afraid that boss that's why he
[1:39:08] probably read he said if he really fear
[1:39:09] man
[1:39:10] then he would not bring back the same
[1:39:11] thing i'll give you
[1:39:12] at least you had to do something with it
[1:39:14] you tell me you're afraid remember
[1:39:15] you're showing me area refreed me your
[1:39:17] fear is a lip service
[1:39:19] because the fear of the lord is the
[1:39:21] beginning of wisdom and wisdom when i'll
[1:39:22] show you at least a bit in the bank
[1:39:25] better yet to bring back a profit to me
[1:39:27] because i'll give you the word not fair
[1:39:29] to sit on books and tapes but for it to
[1:39:31] become a life
[1:39:33] anybody with me this morning
[1:39:35] i'm trying to close out i'm trying to
[1:39:37] close out i'm trying to close out
[1:39:41] listen to the prophetess
[1:39:42] i don't want to deliver i want to do
[1:39:44] something different
[1:39:45] listen to the prophet's rationale i want
[1:39:47] you something different
[1:39:48] that you are calling me to be a prophet
[1:39:50] and i want to live in the wilderness
[1:39:52] like a prophet
[1:39:55] but really the motive behind that was to
[1:39:57] get away from the worker
[1:39:59] you remember we talked about
[1:40:01] the whole thing about motive
[1:40:04] he using words to say but i want to live
[1:40:05] like a prague but his motive is he want
[1:40:07] out of the responsibility
[1:40:10] but and he said it he says but i was
[1:40:13] using my own excuse
[1:40:15] so i could hunt
[1:40:16] my own good
[1:40:18] so the prophet now comment on maturity
[1:40:21] saying you know saying i want to be like
[1:40:23] elijah i'm going hunt anything but it's
[1:40:25] really i like to hunt
[1:40:27] and if you leave me i just hunt and i
[1:40:29] don't come and preach and don't come and
[1:40:31] minister and god said do go ahead go
[1:40:33] ahead do it
[1:40:34] go ahead you want to hunt hunt
[1:40:36] you become a bum
[1:40:38] and your wife will leave you
[1:40:41] because i call it to be no hunter
[1:40:44] he said i was using my own excuse so i
[1:40:46] could hunt my own good and he said but
[1:40:48] dad listen listen but the balance said
[1:40:50] and he said so god talked to the prophet
[1:40:52] and he said but that was the prophets of
[1:40:53] the old testament
[1:40:57] he said you've been called to be there
[1:40:59] in a much higher office than that
[1:41:02] your job description your responsibility
[1:41:04] is that hunting
[1:41:07] in the forest
[1:41:09] anybody with me this morning
[1:41:12] he said you have more gifts beside that
[1:41:16] you know how much gifts you have locked
[1:41:18] up in you that you want to you're
[1:41:19] walking here you're going to parties
[1:41:21] here having connor you do all kind of
[1:41:22] thing you're not supposed to do don't
[1:41:24] you know you have a higher office don't
[1:41:26] you know you're called for the
[1:41:26] manifestation of the sons of god don't
[1:41:28] you know you are the message jesus
[1:41:30] christ
[1:41:31] we have to be able to give an answer so
[1:41:34] god could respond
[1:41:36] god down blessed and faithful servant
[1:41:39] you have more gifts besides that he was
[1:41:41] called to pray for the sick and to
[1:41:43] preach the gospel in the apostolic form
[1:41:46] of great of things many great griefs
[1:41:52] and god goes on he said why do you wait
[1:41:54] for me to move you every time you move
[1:41:56] so god was telling prophet why you have
[1:41:58] to wait for me to push you every time i
[1:41:59] had to move to push you that's god
[1:42:00] talking to the prophet you know
[1:42:03] only seeing this
[1:42:05] that it wasn't by the bran there's
[1:42:06] always was feelings and coming to the
[1:42:08] pulpit that he had his own doubts he had
[1:42:10] his own fears he had his own desires and
[1:42:12] god didn't say
[1:42:18] listen to god why do you wait for me to
[1:42:21] move you every time you move
[1:42:24] so because i'm getting tired of pushing
[1:42:25] the prophet pushing the prophet to do
[1:42:27] we're supposed to do and but um i said
[1:42:29] he ended with where is your reward so by
[1:42:31] the brand of god i said brother yeah
[1:42:32] there's a reward for you you know
[1:42:35] where's your reward

[1:43:11] everything i could do
[1:43:12] i prayed i cried i i sought your face i
[1:43:15] testified i i punned i put down
[1:43:18] everything that doesn't glorify your
[1:43:19] name
[1:43:20] you know how many things you could do
[1:43:21] that that you could do but it's
[1:43:23] worthless when they go could you present
[1:43:24] to god your degree in school well lord i
[1:43:27] really studied hard you know
[1:43:29] i have five certifications
[1:43:33] i studied so much
[1:43:36] what is that worth on that side
[1:43:40] lord i watched the car there was not a
[1:43:43] speck of dirt
[1:43:44] i'm not saying to wash the car but how
[1:43:46] you use your time is what you have to
[1:43:48] give an account for
[1:43:50] how many things you do that has no value
[1:43:54] i'm not saying they're not going to be
[1:43:55] saved i'm not saying you're not going to
[1:43:56] be in the rapture
[1:44:00] there was a memorial for cornelius in
[1:44:02] heaven

[1:44:05] a memorial for you
[1:44:07] for your prayers
[1:44:09] for your son for your daughter for
[1:44:10] yourself

[1:44:12] there's a memorial for you they took
[1:44:15] note in heaven the cornelius prayers
[1:44:21] [Music]
[1:44:23] you have to separate what is worthless
[1:44:26] from what is valuable as currency in the
[1:44:28] eternal realm of god
[1:44:30] your bank account has no value there
[1:44:33] your certifications have no value there
[1:44:36] your friendships have no value there
[1:44:40] what reward do you want son daughter of
[1:44:43] the living god what will be your reward
[1:44:45] that's what god asks the prophet
[1:44:49] you have a responsibility but how well
[1:44:51] you do it
[1:44:52] very lies your reward
[1:44:54] last caught in the sixth seal
[1:44:58] but a man i'm here he said i want to
[1:44:59] tell you a little
[1:45:01] thing happened
[1:45:03] this was a dream i was asleep
[1:45:05] i've never told this publicly before
[1:45:08] i told it to a couple of people but
[1:45:11] never publicly before as i know of
[1:45:14] i dreamed about the month after that
[1:45:15] that i was standing one day
[1:45:17] and i was watching the great time not
[1:45:19] the judgment now
[1:45:21] careful not the white drone judgment
[1:45:24] because i don't believe the church ever
[1:45:26] comes to i mean the bride goes to a
[1:45:28] judgment so we're not talking white
[1:45:29] trump judgment
[1:45:30] but i was there when the crown was being
[1:45:32] given out
[1:45:35] this is my way in your work your labor
[1:45:37] your effort your what you've done for
[1:45:39] the lord
[1:45:41] you're a believer but what have you done
[1:45:43] for the lord
[1:45:44] he said i was there when the crown was
[1:45:46] being given out
[1:45:47] and the great big throne set up there
[1:45:49] and jesus and the recording angel do you
[1:45:52] know there's a recording angel
[1:45:55] recording every word you speak recording
[1:45:58] every place you go recording everything
[1:46:00] you do recording every thought you have
[1:46:02] there's a record being made
[1:46:05] nothing is left out of that record that
[1:46:08] record has every detail of every time
[1:46:11] you lied every time you cried every time
[1:46:13] you you whatever it is but thank god for
[1:46:16] the blood because that that blood covers
[1:46:18] the sins
[1:46:20] hallelujah as far as jesus from the west
[1:46:23] he removed my transgressions from me in
[1:46:26] the sea of forgetfulness not to be found
[1:46:29] so your record no sin could show up
[1:46:31] there because you are son and daughter
[1:46:33] of the living god
[1:46:35] but in that book there are still records
[1:46:37] of your labors for the lord of your
[1:46:40] sacrifices for the lord of the time you
[1:46:43] sighed and cried for the abomination in
[1:46:45] the city and you held on for the young
[1:46:47] people that's not the sin but that's the
[1:46:50] records of the burden in your soul
[1:46:53] to make a church to make a revival
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:00] some people have two items on that
[1:47:02] record some have ten some have a
[1:47:04] thousand
[1:47:05] [Music]
[1:47:07] one time a sister in branham tabernacle
[1:47:09] asked the prophet but abraham could you
[1:47:11] not travel that much could he just stay
[1:47:13] with us for a while and he said sister
[1:47:15] he said if if i stay i can maybe save
[1:47:18] help saved for 30 people he said but if
[1:47:21] i go to the fields i could bring
[1:47:23] thousands for the lord and that's where
[1:47:25] the reward is at the reward is bringing
[1:47:27] in the souls for the lord help him bring
[1:47:30] that reconciliation back to christ
[1:47:33] what's on your record what does the
[1:47:35] recording angel have on you i'm not
[1:47:38] speaking the sinners right now i'm
[1:47:39] speaking to believers who have become
[1:47:41] lazy
[1:47:47] let me try to finish out here not the
[1:47:49] judgment but i was there when the crowd
[1:47:51] was being given out the great big throne
[1:47:54] set up there and jesus and the recording
[1:47:56] angel
[1:47:58] and all was standing there and there
[1:48:00] were still steps like coming down this
[1:48:03] way off white ivory run down a circle
[1:48:07] made a little panoramic like this and
[1:48:09] went out and saw that all this great
[1:48:11] host
[1:48:13] cloud of witnesses this great host
[1:48:15] standing out there could see what was
[1:48:17] happening what is it it's a graduation
[1:48:19] ceremony it's a crowning ceremony it's a
[1:48:22] reward giving ceremony
[1:48:26] but are you there's a reward for you
[1:48:31] hallelujah there are many believers i
[1:48:34] know there's a reward for you
[1:48:36] no matter how you feel you're doing
[1:48:38] something for the lord without asking
[1:48:39] for a blessing or favor nothing
[1:48:41] and some of you do nothing what will
[1:48:43] your reward be on that day when we stand
[1:48:46] out of us
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:53] and i would stand back over listen to
[1:48:55] the prophet way back to one side
[1:48:57] and i was just standing there listening
[1:49:00] to the prophet never an idea
[1:49:02] i had to walk them steps
[1:49:04] i was standing there i'd see the
[1:49:06] recording angel would call a certain
[1:49:09] name
[1:49:10] and i would no recognize that name i
[1:49:13] looked and way back out there here comes
[1:49:16] the brother
[1:49:17] walking with the sister walked up to you
[1:49:19] like that the recording angel standing
[1:49:22] there by the side of christ he said just
[1:49:24] a dream now and was watching and the
[1:49:26] name was on the there it was found in
[1:49:28] the book of life he will look out over
[1:49:31] them and say it is well done my good and
[1:49:34] faithful servant now enter in
[1:49:39] i look back where they was going there

[1:49:44] enter into the joys of the lord that's
[1:49:46] been for your sins the foundation of the
[1:49:48] world and oh i thought they'd go through
[1:49:51] there and meeting one another and just
[1:49:53] rejoicing and going over mountains and a
[1:49:56] great big place but i thought oh isn't
[1:49:58] that wonderful glory hallelujah just
[1:50:01] jumping up and down
