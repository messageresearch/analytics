[10:37] the attributes that was in you
[10:40] lord that father desired to have that
[10:43] family a family of god lord a family
[10:46] that you could

[10:48] was and how
[10:50] lord adam made decisions and and for him
[10:53] to express
[10:54] the nature of his work and what he did
[10:56] and what he was doing and
[10:58] father how that communion was broken
[11:00] with the fall of man and
[11:02] since that time until now you lord lord
[11:05] have been
[11:06] fighting lord to see that communion
[11:08] re-establish and to see our position
[11:11] lord establish the way lord you thought
[11:13] it to be so we come this evening lord so
[11:16] lord get a deeper insight into your
[11:19] thinking into your thoughts father
[11:20] because
[11:21] through your word you have found this
[11:24] secret way
[11:25] to let us know who you are your nature
[11:27] your being your attributes through your
[11:29] word
[11:30] lord you have disguised your nature
[11:32] through your word you have
[11:33] hidden your mind in the word lord and
[11:36] lord hid it so well that you hid it from
[11:38] the
[11:39] eyes of the wise and the prudent and
[11:41] choose to reveal it to babes that would
[11:43] learn
[11:44] who come with a willing attitude who
[11:46] come forgetting their past their
[11:48] mistakes forgetting the hustle and the
[11:49] bustle of the day
[11:51] forgetting the distractions that could
[11:52] so easily be set us and we come tonight
[11:55] though to be drawn higher higher in your
[11:58] love deeper in your word
[12:00] lord to understand lord that you're a
[12:02] god of mercy but you're also a god of
[12:04] judgment
[12:05] lord you're also god of plans your god
[12:07] of purpose your god who
[12:09] thinks so far ahead of us that before we
[12:11] even
[12:12] lord became known lord as we are
[12:15] currently known you already thought
[12:17] about us father so
[12:19] lord may you speak to us tonight through
[12:21] your word as we
[12:23] approach this bible study tonight lord
[12:25] may you take me out of the way
[12:27] may you speak to your children may you
[12:29] open our understanding to the scriptures
[12:32] tonight we commit each brother and
[12:33] sister into your hands
[12:35] lord if there's anyone not feeling well
[12:36] anyone lord
[12:38] battling any type of situation me as the
[12:41] word goes forth
[12:42] made of peace that surpass it all
[12:44] understanding lord enter their rooms
[12:46] enter their cars their houses wherever
[12:48] they may be right now
[12:50] lord make yourself real to us and speak
[12:52] to us
[12:53] lord walk out the pages of the bibles
[12:55] straight into our hearts father we
[12:57] commit
[12:58] lord this evening into your hands in the
[12:59] precious name of jesus christ amen
[13:02] and amen and amen it is certainly a
[13:04] great privilege to be here tonight
[13:06] once again for our weekly bible study
[13:10] and uh it is it is quite a journey in
[13:13] scripture
[13:14] uh that the lord has been taking us
[13:15] through and
[13:17] such a humbling experience to be able to
[13:20] speak
[13:21] and find uh try to capture the mind of
[13:24] god
[13:25] for us and just in some way encourage us
[13:29] i always
[13:30] like to introduce by saying this is not
[13:32] a preaching service
[13:34] it is it is a bible study and uh it
[13:37] helps us fulfill for those
[13:39] who have not found that balance in life
[13:41] and have made a decision to be
[13:43] consistent
[13:44] uh in their daily meditation you know
[13:47] the bible says
[13:48] god told joshua meditate on the word day
[13:50] and night
[13:51] and you will have good success and
[13:53] that's a principle
[13:55] that's guaranteed to work because if you
[13:57] do what god says
[13:59] he is obligated to make his word come to
[14:02] pass
[14:02] so we are here to fulfill that are we
[14:06] also
[14:06] here to you know not read a bible like a
[14:09] novel or a book but to really capture
[14:11] the mind of god and
[14:13] through god's wisdom and the age that we
[14:15] are in
[14:16] that he chose to send a prophet not just
[14:19] a prophet not just a major prophet but a
[14:21] star in the right hand of god
[14:23] a prophet like no other prophet who
[14:26] would open the word
[14:27] open the book so that when we read the
[14:28] scriptures we are reading
[14:30] from that open book tonight and uh
[14:35] i found myself the last few sessions in
[14:38] second kings and we are still
[14:41] in second kings uh tonight and
[14:44] second kings is when you think
[14:47] that you know a lot was happening in
[14:50] that period
[14:51] then you begin to read more and realize
[14:53] whoa this is this is a lot
[14:55] it's a lot but uh i said last week
[14:59] we were we were reading uh about the
[15:01] shunamite
[15:02] and we were uh uh you know
[15:06] talking about that and we said in order
[15:07] to to go to eight we had to go back
[15:10] to four um you know and kind of pick up
[15:14] uh where it started before we could um
[15:18] properly go to eat and tonight i
[15:21] want to try to go to nine
[15:24] but to go to nine we actually need to go
[15:27] back to first kings
[15:28] before we could even approach nine you
[15:30] know so
[15:31] um we have quite a little bit of of of
[15:33] reading to do tonight
[15:35] so uh bear with me but we will
[15:38] our primary text will be in in in second
[15:42] kings but
[15:43] to really get to where we're going we
[15:44] need to rewind the tape a little bit
[15:46] and go back a little earlier to place a
[15:49] context and to actually
[15:51] show you know how long range
[15:54] of a vision god has concerning certain
[15:57] things
[15:58] and this should show us a few things it
[16:00] should show us that
[16:02] god is not now deciding he is not now
[16:05] understanding what's unfolding he is not
[16:08] now
[16:09] putting things in place and he's a god
[16:12] of his word
[16:13] in our teaching tonight we're going to
[16:14] see that god is a god of instruction
[16:16] and you know sometimes we
[16:19] we get things coming to us and things to
[16:22] do or we get inspiration to do things
[16:23] and we
[16:24] realize that sometimes the inspiration
[16:26] we get may be the right inspiration even
[16:28] if
[16:28] it lines up with certain things it makes
[16:30] you you know kind of really
[16:32] you know just just teaching it's still
[16:34] kind of blowing my mind a bit as i was
[16:36] as going through it um preparing for
[16:38] tonight so bear with me tonight
[16:40] and i want to start off uh by
[16:43] uh you know i want to give it a little
[16:46] title
[16:47] um and it's a very simple title but i
[16:50] want to call it title
[16:51] from a soldier to a king a study of jehu
[16:56] all right that's my title from a soldier
[16:58] to a king
[17:00] a study of jehu um
[17:03] so our focus tonight will be on
[17:06] jehu and to kind of lay a bit of a
[17:10] background
[17:11] now we we know that
[17:14] you know when samuel was prophet
[17:18] the children of israel at that time
[17:21] would have been looking outwards when
[17:24] they should have been looking inward
[17:26] they were looking outward and they made
[17:27] this declaration that we want a king
[17:30] also
[17:30] because we see other nations other
[17:32] people other kingdoms
[17:34] kingdoms have kings but we have no king
[17:37] and
[17:38] god said to samuel they have not
[17:40] rejected you they have really rejected
[17:42] me because
[17:43] you know i am the king and through
[17:46] that god allowed are using the word
[17:49] allowed
[17:51] samuel to anoint saul
[17:54] and saul as it were was
[17:57] chosen loved by the people he was a
[18:00] people's man
[18:01] and while he was yet in office uh
[18:04] god said to samuel well i found a better
[18:06] man
[18:07] and we know this to be king david so i'm
[18:10] kind of laying a bit of a foundation and
[18:12] we have
[18:12] quite a bit of reading tonight so i
[18:14] trust you i have your bibles i trust you
[18:15] have your notes and i want you to ride
[18:17] with me
[18:18] because i know that there will be a lot
[18:20] tonight that you may not have looked at
[18:22] like this
[18:23] so i want to challenge you uh we gonna
[18:26] reach back to second kings but we need
[18:27] to go back to kind of lay this
[18:29] foundation so
[18:30] after saul i want us to understand that
[18:33] the children of israel were all together
[18:35] you know the tribes were one people they
[18:38] worked together
[18:40] each had their ministry their portfolio
[18:41] their jurisdiction
[18:43] their inheritance they had their
[18:44] specializations who were farmers
[18:47] who raised animals the levites had the
[18:49] responsibility the spiritual things you
[18:51] know the warrior tribe so judah was the
[18:53] was the the the warlords you had all of
[18:56] these things going on
[18:57] and under king david it it worked well
[19:01] david's son king solomon became king
[19:04] and the territory of of israel as it
[19:07] were
[19:07] or what biblical scholars would call the
[19:09] united israel was even larger
[19:12] but when solomon died
[19:15] and solomon's son took over
[19:18] the kingdom was divided
[19:21] on the southern side would have been
[19:24] basically tribes of judah and benjamin
[19:26] and
[19:27] thus became the kingdom of judah with
[19:30] jerusalem
[19:31] basically within that territory all
[19:33] right so in the south
[19:34] would be the kingdom of judah therein
[19:37] would be jerusalem
[19:38] and the northern kingdom which would
[19:41] have consisted that the remaining tribes
[19:44] was called israel so people
[19:47] read the bible and and and sometimes
[19:49] they miss the subtlety
[19:51] with the reference with this was the
[19:52] king and then they heard there's another
[19:54] king and the reality is the king of
[19:55] israel and the king of judah
[19:57] it was this wonderful family as it were
[20:00] had been divided because of
[20:02] a disagreement over a number of things
[20:04] we've been getting here tonight
[20:06] uh but led to that separation of the
[20:09] kingdom
[20:10] or or the kingdom of judah as it will
[20:12] and the kingdom of israel with
[20:14] jerusalem being basically the capital in
[20:16] judah
[20:17] and samaria be in the capital uh
[20:21] in in israel all right and
[20:24] we find and i'm going back now to to
[20:27] kind of start
[20:28] this we have to go back to fullest kings
[20:32] so you can ride with me a bit because we
[20:34] will need to move a little quickly but
[20:36] we're going to go to first kings
[20:38] uh 16 and
[20:42] we'll find out that after the the
[20:43] establishment of two
[20:45] short-lived capitals in shechem and tusa
[20:49] king omri which should have been the
[20:51] king you know
[20:52] as they were moving on would have
[20:54] established his capital at samaria
[20:56] for the northern kingdom of israel where
[20:59] for the remainder of the northern
[21:01] kingdom existence so mario would have
[21:04] been the capital as it were
[21:05] or the principal city now in first kings
[21:08] 16
[21:10] um we find in verse
[21:13] 29 first kings
[21:16] 16 and verse 29
[21:20] and in the 30th and eighth year of asa
[21:24] king of judah all right so we already
[21:27] seen
[21:27] this distinction between the kingdoms in
[21:29] the 38th year of asa king of judah
[21:33] began ahab the son of omri we just
[21:37] mentioned his name there
[21:38] to reign over israel so asa
[21:41] is king in judah and ahab the son of
[21:44] omri
[21:46] to reign over israel he had the son of
[21:49] of iran over israel in samaria
[21:53] 22 years
[21:56] and listen carefully this is verse 30
[21:58] and ahab the son of armory
[22:01] did evil in the sight of the lord above
[22:04] all that were before him we don't have
[22:06] time to go into all of it tonight
[22:09] but by this time things were getting
[22:11] from bad to worse
[22:12] but here we have a situation where where
[22:15] the bible says that ahab the son of omri
[22:18] did evil
[22:19] in the sight of the lord above all that
[22:21] were before him
[22:23] so this was now the worst king was now
[22:26] sitting in power
[22:28] and verse 31 and it came to pass listen
[22:31] carefully
[22:31] as if it had been a light thing for him
[22:34] to walk in the sins of
[22:36] jeroboam the son of nabat so in
[22:40] other words as if it was easy
[22:44] to walk in the sins of jeroboam meaning
[22:47] meaning it was not easy to be as bad as
[22:51] jeroboam but ahab was actually worse
[22:54] so the bible is saying in other words
[22:56] you have to work hard
[22:58] to be as evil as king jeroboam
[23:01] king jeroboam was so horrible that in
[23:04] writing this they were saying despite
[23:07] how hard it was
[23:08] to be as bad as jeroboam ahab actually
[23:11] was worse and listen
[23:12] that he took to wife jezebel
[23:16] so this is where he started to go from
[23:19] bad to worse he took
[23:20] to wife jezebel the daughter
[23:23] of ethebal king of the zenonians
[23:27] and went so is as a result of this
[23:30] marriage
[23:31] to this young lady who was not of israel
[23:35] not
[23:36] of their belief not of their persuasion
[23:37] in fact zidonia
[23:39] is the equivalent of modern day lebanon
[23:42] so
[23:42] she would have been what would have been
[23:44] called a phoenician
[23:45] and the phoenicians had their culture
[23:47] had their beliefs they
[23:49] were idol worshippers they would simply
[23:51] god bald they
[23:53] had women very active in in in the
[23:56] religious duties of the day as it were
[23:58] and so abe so so ahab married this woman
[24:01] named jezebel
[24:02] and went and served bayer lobel and
[24:06] worshiped him
[24:07] so it is the first time we are seeing
[24:09] the introduction
[24:11] of this increased level of idolatry
[24:15] so when you read it through brother
[24:16] branham's teaching he would talk about
[24:18] and ahab
[24:19] married jezebel and introduced idolatry
[24:22] amongst the people all right so it is
[24:25] not as simple as this though
[24:27] because listen to verse 32 so this
[24:30] is this is a son this is a king
[24:34] this is somebody of the of the tribe of
[24:36] a descendant of israel
[24:38] this is somebody who is now king over
[24:41] israel
[24:42] someone who would have known the stories
[24:45] of
[24:46] egypt and moses and know the history of
[24:49] abraham
[24:50] understand all of this before and here
[24:53] it is
[24:54] as a result of his marriage to jezebel
[24:56] verse 32 and you read up an all tougher
[24:59] bill
[25:01] and it is not just he has an altar for
[25:02] bill but the bible says in the house of
[25:04] will
[25:05] so it's it's two things not just you
[25:08] have an
[25:08] altar but you build a house so you
[25:10] actually created a temple
[25:12] and in the temple you'll create an altar
[25:15] in azerbai
[25:16] which he had built in samaria and ahab
[25:19] made a grove
[25:20] and ahab did more to provoke
[25:23] the lord god of israel to anger
[25:26] than all the kings of israel that were
[25:29] before him
[25:30] you see how serious that is so i want to
[25:33] make a point here now
[25:35] so here we have a king and
[25:39] he has made a decision because we talk
[25:41] about the only time life is about
[25:42] choices
[25:43] life is about decisions he has had a
[25:46] choice
[25:46] he's going to marry somebody from his
[25:48] tribe he can embrace somebody from his
[25:49] people
[25:50] whatever the motivation was whatever the
[25:52] reason was because
[25:53] every single person when they make a
[25:55] decision if
[25:57] there's any level of reasoning in your
[25:58] mind most people could justify why they
[26:00] could tell you why
[26:02] if you don't know why you're doing
[26:03] something well that's a whole different
[26:04] conversation
[26:06] but there may have been some motivation
[26:07] some reason for him for choosing this
[26:09] woman
[26:10] but as a result of this he said ahab did
[26:13] more
[26:16] to provoke the lord god of israel to
[26:18] anger than
[26:19] all the kings of israel that were before
[26:22] him
[26:23] so he break the records when it comes to
[26:25] sin and breaking down so
[26:27] we already know this but we we need to
[26:29] touch this because it's important for
[26:31] where we're going
[26:33] first king 17 we are now introduced to
[26:36] the mighty prophet
[26:38] and elijah the tishbite who was of the
[26:40] inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab
[26:43] as the lord god of israel liveth before
[26:45] whom i stand there shall not be due nor
[26:47] rain
[26:48] these years but according to my word
[26:51] and thus we have the first interaction
[26:53] with elijah
[26:55] and we would have mentioned last week
[26:56] that there are five manifestations
[26:58] or five displays or five references to
[27:01] elijah through scripture
[27:02] we have elijah we have elisha we have
[27:06] john the baptist
[27:07] we have william branham and if you read
[27:10] the book of revelation
[27:11] to the jews there's moses and elijah
[27:12] there all right
[27:14] quick reference mount transfiguration
[27:16] there was moses elijah there as well so
[27:18] elijah is very unique in the great mind
[27:20] of god
[27:21] but here is it it is as if to deal
[27:25] with the level of sin that ahab went to
[27:29] god raised up the right kind of man to
[27:31] deal with this particular type of
[27:32] situation everybody with me
[27:35] so elijah we know it he prophesies
[27:37] drought and we know all of this i'm not
[27:39] trying to focus on that tonight we'll
[27:40] have another teaching on that
[27:42] um he challenges ahab in in in chapter
[27:45] 18
[27:46] we know we have the whole mount carmel
[27:48] showdown we should be familiar with that
[27:50] because by this time jezebel had already
[27:53] begun to
[27:54] influence ahab influence him first from
[27:57] a subtle perspective
[27:58] and and then more and more and more
[28:01] until
[28:02] a king who knew his history who
[28:05] understood what god had done for them
[28:07] for them to be even there allowed
[28:10] jezebel as it were to order the murder
[28:12] of prophets
[28:14] so the holy men the prophets were being
[28:17] killed out on the instruction from this
[28:20] simple woman called jezebel everybody
[28:22] with me on this
[28:23] all right so we have a situation where
[28:25] prophets
[28:26] are under attack so for example 1804 and
[28:29] it was sword i went jezebel
[28:30] cut of the prophet of the lord that
[28:32] obadiah took 100 prophets and hid them
[28:34] so we have all these things beginning to
[28:36] go on here and we know it and then
[28:38] there is this great showdown on mount
[28:40] carmel where
[28:42] elijah fitz is like the last man
[28:44] standing and he said let's call the
[28:46] prophet sabal
[28:47] let's let's see who answered by fire let
[28:49] that god be god
[28:50] so so we understand the situation right
[28:53] and then we have the sound of abundance
[28:55] of rain we're just going through quickly
[28:57] there that's all part of 18.
[28:58] i see a cloud like a man's hand all
[29:00] these references we're aware of it right
[29:03] now i want to now touch 19. so first
[29:07] kings 19. so we kind of berlin
[29:09] into somewhere trying to get to a place
[29:11] so that we can understand it right
[29:13] now i want to briefly or quickly read it
[29:17] so that we could be on the same page
[29:19] with this right and ahab
[29:20] told jezebel all that elijah had done
[29:24] this is first kings 19 and verse one and
[29:27] ahem
[29:28] told jezebel all that elijah had done
[29:31] and with how
[29:32] how he had slain all the prophets with
[29:34] his sword because basically after the
[29:36] whole period with mount carmel and stuff
[29:37] elijah said kill all them false gods all
[29:39] them false prophets put them to the
[29:41] sword
[29:41] all right so then jezebel
[29:45] to see how jezebel is operating then
[29:47] jezebel
[29:48] sent a messenger unto elijah
[29:52] saying so let the gods do to me and more
[29:55] also
[29:56] if i make not thy life as the life of
[29:59] one of them by tomorrow about this time
[30:01] so she's another threat to elijah saying
[30:04] the gods kill me also
[30:05] by tomorrow you were there also just
[30:08] like
[30:09] just like my prophets of belle who you
[30:10] are killed
[30:12] and when he had saw that he arose and
[30:15] went for his life so elijah
[30:18] understanding this ill this jezebel
[30:20] spirit see you here here it is
[30:22] you say i out i out i oh i i
[30:25] i out and came to bear shiva which
[30:28] belonged to judah
[30:30] and left his servant here so elijah say
[30:33] where are you going i named karamazov
[30:39] but he himself went a day's journey into
[30:42] the wilderness and came and sat
[30:43] under juniper tree and he requested for
[30:46] himself that he might die
[30:49] now there's a real position to be you
[30:50] know you just had a mighty mount carmel
[30:53] victory you road the enemy
[30:57] you'll get a threat and we see elijah a
[31:00] mighty man of god
[31:01] prophet of god reached to such a level
[31:03] of depression
[31:06] reach to such a level of exasperation
[31:08] reach to such a level that he feels so
[31:10] low
[31:11] that he requested that he might die
[31:15] now i don't know what you but sometimes
[31:17] you just have some low moments
[31:19] but it is not about having your low
[31:21] moments is the issue is to understand
[31:23] that god comes in the lowest of moments
[31:26] to lift you up when you're feeling low
[31:28] so when somebody tell me
[31:29] they're feeling low i understand i
[31:32] sympathize and
[31:33] anybody who act like they'd have a low
[31:35] moment ready line
[31:36] because you're you're we all have our
[31:39] juniper tree experience to go through
[31:41] and here it was this mighty prophet
[31:44] after a mighty victory
[31:45] to this day we still reference the monk
[31:48] showdown had come to a crossroads in his
[31:50] ministry
[31:51] where he has what what people will call
[31:53] an existential crisis
[31:54] he's wondering why he even exists if he
[31:57] should exist
[31:58] and now which says you know what my
[31:59] whole life falling apart is the best i
[32:01] just did
[32:03] and he's in the midst of that depression
[32:05] that frustration
[32:06] that feeling sorry for himself that
[32:09] wishing
[32:10] you know that that he comes his end
[32:14] and he said it is enough lord oh lord
[32:15] take away my life for i am not better
[32:17] than my father's
[32:18] now his father isn't a real condition
[32:20] you know so he's had to devalue himself
[32:22] to say i
[32:22] just have the bible and fathers who give
[32:24] all them trouble
[32:26] and as he lay there and slept under a
[32:27] juniper tree behold
[32:29] then an angel touched him oh my
[32:32] lord elfquest oh if i inject i'll just
[32:36] touch your shoulder tonight
[32:38] in the midst of your juniper experience
[32:40] in the midst of you
[32:41] wondering what your next move is going
[32:43] to be in the midst of you trying to
[32:44] decide
[32:45] you know how to move how to go how to
[32:47] live an angel come and touch him
[32:50] you see how much god cares for his
[32:51] children he's so much god cares about
[32:53] what you're going through
[32:55] that he would send an angel to touch you
[32:57] so i want you to stay encouraged friends
[32:59] no matter how bad it is
[33:00] there's an angel tonight this is the
[33:02] angel in operation
[33:04] hallelujah to touch you to encourage you
[33:06] to give you a word to say lift your head
[33:08] up
[33:08] and listen listen and he later uh uh
[33:11] uh uh a zlatan stepped under to behold
[33:14] then an angel touch him and said unto
[33:15] him arise and eat
[33:17] in other words pick himself eat
[33:19] something do do something don't do it
[33:20] don't just sit in a pity party
[33:23] and he looked so he's not just arriving
[33:25] and looked and behold there was a cake
[33:27] bacon on the coals
[33:28] and a cruise of water at his head
[33:31] hallelujah
[33:32] injured cake boy and he did eat and
[33:35] drink and lay them down again
[33:36] and the angel of the lord came again the
[33:39] second time and touched him and said
[33:41] arise and eat
[33:42] in other words take seconds when the
[33:44] angel tell it take seconds
[33:48] all right and he did eat and drink and
[33:51] lay down
[33:52] again
[33:56] it says arise and eat because a journey
[33:57] is too great for thee
[33:59] and he arose and did eat and drink and
[34:01] went in the strength of that meat 40
[34:03] days
[34:04] and 40 nights on the horror the mount of
[34:06] god
[34:08] and i'm reading this because i know we
[34:10] touch later part of this but most people
[34:12] don't take the time and go to this right
[34:16] and he came through onto a cave and
[34:17] lodged there and behold the word of the
[34:19] lord came to him and he said unto him
[34:21] what does thou hear elijah
[34:23] and he said i have been very jealous for
[34:25] the lord god of hosts for the children
[34:26] of israel
[34:27] have forsaken thy covenant thrown down
[34:30] nine altars
[34:31] and slain thy prophets with the sword
[34:33] and i
[34:34] even i only am left and they seek my
[34:37] life to take it away
[34:39] and he said go forth and stand upon the
[34:41] mount before the lord and be all the
[34:42] lord pass by
[34:44] and a great and strong wind ran the
[34:46] mountains and break in pieces of rocks
[34:49] before the lord but the lord was not in
[34:51] the wind
[34:52] and after the wind and earthquake but
[34:54] the lord was not in the earthquake
[34:56] and after the earthquake of fire but the
[34:59] lord was not in the fire
[35:01] and after the fire a still small voice
[35:04] and it was so when elijah heard it and
[35:07] he wrapped his face in his mantle
[35:09] and went out and stood in the entering
[35:11] in of the cave and behold
[35:13] there came a voice unto him and said
[35:15] what does thou hear elijah
[35:17] and he said i've been very jealous for
[35:19] the lord god of hosts because the
[35:20] children of israel had forsaken thy
[35:22] covenant
[35:23] thrown down thine altars and slain thy
[35:25] prophets with the sword and i
[35:27] even i only am left and they seek my
[35:29] life to take it away
[35:31] and this is what i want to get to so in
[35:33] the midst of this despair now
[35:35] god is beginning to deal with the
[35:36] servant and the lord said unto him
[35:39] go return my way to the wilderness of
[35:42] damascus
[35:44] and when thou comest anointed
[35:47] haziel to be king over syria
[35:51] very interesting command and if you
[35:54] search scriptures
[35:59] you will see no situation in scripture
[36:01] where this was actually done
[36:03] by elijah
[36:07] then verse 16 and jehu
[36:10] the son of nimshi shall thou anoint to
[36:14] be king
[36:15] over israel
[36:18] this too elijah did not do and we are
[36:21] going to get gonna get it
[36:23] but to to reach jehu we need to start
[36:25] here because it's the first time
[36:27] his name is mentioned and jehu the son
[36:30] of nimshi
[36:32] shall now anoint to be king over israel
[36:35] and elisha the son of safat
[36:39] abel shaldawa knowing to be prophet
[36:42] in thy room and it shall come to pass
[36:46] that him that escapeth the sword of
[36:48] israel shall jehu slay
[36:51] and him that escaping from the sword of
[36:54] jehu shall elijah slee
[37:00] hallelujah and verse let's just skip
[37:02] down to verse 19.
[37:04] so he departed fence and found elisha
[37:07] the son of shafat
[37:08] who was plowing with 12 yoke of oxen
[37:10] before him
[37:12] and he with the 12th and elisha pass by
[37:15] him and cast his mantle and we know that
[37:17] upon him
[37:17] so i want to paint a picture here before
[37:19] we even advance a little further but
[37:21] there's one more
[37:22] story we need to touch before we get to
[37:24] our text tonight
[37:26] so we have a situation where elijah has
[37:27] his mighty victory
[37:29] god is dealing with elijah he is
[37:31] comforting elijah he also drops some
[37:33] instructions in elijah to elijah
[37:36] we know from our studies of second kings
[37:38] over the last few weeks
[37:40] he talked about neymar we talked about
[37:41] the four lepers we talked about his
[37:43] tsunami
[37:44] woman all these three was the ministry
[37:46] of elisha
[37:48] s-h-a who came after elijah
[37:51] so we find the time where god is telling
[37:53] elijah
[37:54] about elisha but at the same time he is
[37:58] telling elijah
[37:59] about jehu jehu
[38:03] would be a long ways down the road from
[38:06] elijah
[38:07] but god is already thinking about jew
[38:09] coming and what jehu is about to do
[38:11] i want us to catch this for a minute all
[38:13] right everybody with meets tonight
[38:15] all right so and jehu the son of them
[38:18] she shallow anointed to be king over
[38:20] israel
[38:20] so if you just read this as a
[38:22] chronological book then you would say
[38:24] well okay so elijah has this ministry to
[38:26] anoint jehu
[38:27] he has a ministry to go get elisha
[38:31] all right uh uh to be annoying to be
[38:33] prophet
[38:34] and he's here to be king over syria all
[38:36] right so
[38:37] moving on from here now just let me get
[38:39] my notes i have some notes here trying
[38:40] to
[38:41] there's a lot of moving pieces trying to
[38:42] keep track of we now need to jump now to
[38:46] first kings 21.
[38:49] and because
[38:53] what we are doing is stacking up we are
[38:54] going almost because we
[38:56] we will end up rewinding this when we
[38:59] reach further on right
[39:00] so first kings 21 we're going to deal
[39:03] with neboth
[39:05] and it came to pass after these things
[39:07] so a few things would have happened
[39:09] that neighbor the jezreelite had a
[39:12] vineyard
[39:13] which was in jezreel had by the palace
[39:17] of ahab king of samaria so in other
[39:18] words
[39:19] basically right close by ahab property
[39:22] as king of samaria
[39:24] is this man named nebot who is a
[39:26] jezreelite and he has a vineyard
[39:30] now here in is is is how do i say this
[39:33] this is coveting at a whole next level
[39:35] all right and
[39:36] ahab spake unto nearby saying
[39:39] give me thy vineyard that i may have it
[39:42] for a garden of herbs
[39:45] now it does sound like a bad request
[39:47] right
[39:48] because it is near unto my house
[39:52] and i will give thee for it a better
[39:54] vineyard than it
[39:56] or if you know a better vineyard
[39:59] if it seemed good to me i will give you
[40:01] the reward of it and money
[40:03] so in other words ahab catch it one day
[40:06] looking at his property
[40:09] there looking at neighborhood a nice
[40:10] vineyard he said you know what you know
[40:11] i can grow herbs here i can expand my
[40:13] garden
[40:14] it right next to my property if i expand
[40:16] it it's right there it's not like i have
[40:17] to go far
[40:18] never breads here going on let me get
[40:21] your vineyard
[40:22] i want the plant i want to do a crop and
[40:24] where you see it
[40:26] and um i will give you a better vineyard
[40:28] because i'm king so if you want to
[40:29] you want a bigger vineyard you want a
[40:31] banana mountain whatever i can give you
[40:33] that
[40:34] if you don't want the next vineyard i
[40:35] can give any money all right
[40:38] a neighbor said to ahab the lord forbid
[40:40] it to me
[40:42] that i should give the inheritance of my
[40:45] father's unto thee
[40:47] so neighbor respond like listen
[40:52] i wouldn't mind it but hear what is my
[40:53] family property we have it for our whole
[40:55] life i already don't feel comfortable to
[40:57] give you this
[40:58] the lord forbid it that i might give the
[40:59] inheritance to my father's
[41:01] i didn't really work for this i
[41:02] inherited this is my family
[41:05] now when i read this
[41:08] this part just blew my mind and ahab
[41:11] came into his house heavy
[41:13] and displeased because of the word that
[41:15] neighbor the jesuit had spoken to him
[41:18] for he had said i will not give thee the
[41:20] inheritance of my father's
[41:22] and he laid him down upon his bed and
[41:25] turned away his face and would eat no
[41:27] bread
[41:29] you asking somebody for someone that is
[41:31] not yours
[41:32] you ain't work for it it's their family
[41:35] is their family inheritance
[41:37] you give them an offer you offer them a
[41:39] better land you offer them money
[41:41] the man say no and you get so depressed
[41:44] you go on home
[41:45] turn your face in the wall and don't
[41:47] want to eat
[41:48] you seeing how ridiculous this on it
[41:53] but jezebel his wife this jezebel
[41:57] came to him and said unto him why is thy
[42:00] spirit so sad
[42:01] that though he takes no bread and he
[42:04] said unto her
[42:05] this song that's such a flimsy excuse
[42:07] for this situation because i speak on
[42:09] the neighbor the jesuit
[42:10] and said unto him give me that vineyard
[42:13] for money or else
[42:14] if it please ye i will give you another
[42:16] vineyard for it and he answered i will
[42:18] not give thee my vineyard
[42:20] and jezebel his wife said unto him does
[42:23] thou now govern the kingdom of israel
[42:26] arise and eat bread and let thine heart
[42:28] be
[42:29] merry i will give thee the vineyard of
[42:31] neighborhood the jesuit
[42:33] so jesse bell say go on eat relax
[42:35] yourself
[42:37] know your king or what you got in like
[42:38] yourself i will take care of it
[42:42] so she wrote letters in ahab's name
[42:46] and sealed them with his seal and send
[42:49] the letters
[42:49] unto the elders and to the nobles that
[42:52] were in his city
[42:53] dwelling with nebot and she wrote in the
[42:56] letter saying proclaim a fast
[42:58] and set neighbor on high among the
[43:00] people and set two
[43:02] men sons of belial which in the
[43:05] amplified is unprincipled men
[43:07] men of no character men of no reputation
[43:11] who will say anything right and set two
[43:13] men
[43:14] sons of bilia before him to bear witness
[43:16] against him say endow this
[43:18] blaspheme god and the king and then
[43:20] carry him out and stone him that he may
[43:22] die
[43:24] and the man of his city even the elders
[43:27] and the nobles who were the inhabitants
[43:28] in the city did
[43:30] as jezebel had sent unto them and as it
[43:33] was written in the letters
[43:34] which she had sent unto them they
[43:36] proclaimed the fast
[43:38] and set neighbor on high in other words
[43:39] present him before the people
[43:41] and they came in two men children of
[43:44] belial
[43:44] and sat before him and the men of belial
[43:47] witnessed against him
[43:48] even against neighborhood in the
[43:50] presence of the people saying neighbor
[43:51] did blaspheme god
[43:52] and the king then they carried him
[43:54] fought out of the city
[43:55] stoned him with stones that then he died
[43:58] that he died
[44:00] then they sent to jezebel saying nearby
[44:02] the stone
[44:03] and he's dead and it came to pass when
[44:06] jezebel heard
[44:07] that neighborhood was stone and was dead
[44:09] that jezebel said to ahab
[44:11] arise take possession of the vineyard of
[44:14] nebuchad
[44:15] the jezreelite which he refused to give
[44:18] thee for money
[44:19] for neighborhood is not alive but dead
[44:22] and it came to pass when ahab heard that
[44:25] neighborhood was dead
[44:26] that ahab rose up to go down to the
[44:28] vineyard of nearby
[44:29] the jesuit to take possession of it
[44:33] we're still building him then the word
[44:36] of the lord came to elijah the tishbite
[44:39] in other words this got god so upset
[44:42] this action disturbed god so much that
[44:44] he took his prophet
[44:46] and the word of the lord came to elijah
[44:48] the teach by saying arise
[44:50] go down to meet ahab king of israel
[44:53] which is in samaria behold he is in the
[44:56] vineyard of neighbors
[44:58] whether he is gone down to possess it so
[45:00] god tell
[45:01] elijah the exact gps coordinates
[45:04] he tell him who he tell him where he
[45:06] tell him your house
[45:07] right and thou shalt speak unto him
[45:11] saying
[45:11] thus here the lord has doubt killed
[45:14] and also taken possession and thou shalt
[45:17] speak unto him saying
[45:18] thus say the lord in the place
[45:22] where dogs licked the blood of
[45:24] neighborhood shall dogs lick thy blood
[45:26] even thine
[45:28] so now we starting to deal with judgment
[45:30] now
[45:31] and ahab said to elijah has doubt found
[45:34] me oh my
[45:34] enemy you know ahab and elijah never
[45:38] never did well you say has thou found me
[45:40] all my enemy
[45:41] and he answered i have found thee
[45:43] because thou has sold thyself to work
[45:45] evil
[45:46] in the sight of the lord
[45:49] behold i will bring evil upon me and
[45:52] will take away thy posterity
[45:54] and will cut off from ahab him that
[45:57] pisseth against the wall
[45:58] and him that is shut up and left in
[46:00] israel
[46:02] and i will make and will make thine
[46:04] house like the house of jeroboam that
[46:06] was the
[46:07] first king who started the whole
[46:09] idolatry business
[46:11] and i will make that house like the
[46:13] house of jeroboam the son of nebat
[46:15] and like the house of bashar the son of
[46:17] a hajjay
[46:18] and for the provocation where it thou
[46:20] has provoked me to anger and made israel
[46:22] to sin
[46:24] and of jezebel this is the prophecy and
[46:26] of jezebel
[46:27] also speak the lord saying the dog shall
[46:30] eat jezebel
[46:31] by the wall of jezreel him that diet of
[46:35] ahab in the city the dog shall eat
[46:38] and him that diet in the field shall the
[46:40] falls of the air eat
[46:43] but there was none like under ahab which
[46:46] did sell himself to work wickedness in
[46:48] the sight of the lord
[46:49] so that is the lord saying they say god
[46:51] is so disturbed by this
[46:53] and listen how he says whom jezebel his
[46:55] wife stood up
[46:57] so god is saying he have the wickedness
[47:00] but it's jezebel who stirred his
[47:02] wickedness up in his heart
[47:05] you see why brother branham was so hard
[47:06] against the jezebel spirit
[47:09] you see why but i don't care so much too
[47:11] much against it
[47:13] and he did abominably in following idols
[47:15] according to all things
[47:17] as did the amorites whom the lord cast
[47:20] out before the children of israel
[47:21] and it came to pass listen carefully so
[47:24] ab is now hearing this
[47:26] and a ab gets convicted and it came to
[47:29] pass when ab heard those words
[47:31] that he rent his clothes and put
[47:33] sackcloth upon his flesh
[47:35] and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went
[47:38] softly
[47:40] and the word the lord came to elijah the
[47:42] teach by saying
[47:44] cs thou how ahab humbled himself before
[47:46] me
[47:48] because he humbled himself before me i
[47:52] will not
[47:52] bring the evil in his days but in his
[47:55] son's days will i bring the evil upon
[47:58] his house
[48:00] now you see that this kind of scripture
[48:01] here is real serious
[48:04] it's rare serious and it's something i
[48:07] was sharing a while back that you know
[48:09] you whenever you step out of god's will
[48:13] there are consequences there are
[48:16] always consequences because actions have
[48:19] consequences
[48:21] and even if you repent repentance
[48:23] reconciles your relationship with god
[48:25] but your consequence is a whole defense
[48:26] conversation enough
[48:28] so god is the god of his words he said
[48:30] judgment has to come upon
[48:31] ahab and upon jezebel for what they have
[48:34] done
[48:35] i have not forgotten what they have done
[48:37] to my prophets i have not forgotten how
[48:39] they have introduced these false gods
[48:41] i have not forgotten how to build a
[48:43] house for bill and an
[48:44] author for bear i will not forget what
[48:47] they did to nebot
[48:48] a simple man had his property and
[48:50] because ahab
[48:51] lusted after him he and his wife by
[48:54] extension conspired
[48:56] to kill a man to get his property i'm
[48:58] not washing my hands a bit
[49:01] nobody has done as bad as ahab because
[49:03] of this wife of his
[49:04] judgment will come upon him judgment
[49:06] will come up on his house
[49:07] and ab is here in this but yet still in
[49:10] the midst of his judgment he gets
[49:11] convicted begins to fast and pray and
[49:13] god says
[49:14] well all right the jabba will come but
[49:21] i will not bring it in your day it's
[49:23] going to follow you
[49:24] every everybody with me we're building a
[49:27] background here now right okay cool
[49:30] so now let me kind of push to my text
[49:34] time is is kind of running a little bit
[49:36] here
[49:37] so we have been in second kings we're
[49:40] going to go back in second kings now
[49:43] so in second kings by second kings
[49:46] second kings opens up with a lot of
[49:48] things happening
[49:50] we have the intro of second as we have
[49:52] said with
[49:53] elijah being taken up and elisha taking
[49:56] over so now elijah's obviously
[49:58] seen but we see no encounter with elijah
[50:01] and jehu
[50:02] so it would seem as if elijah has gone
[50:05] but this part with
[50:06] elijah anointing jehu has not been
[50:09] fulfilled
[50:11] all right we see also
[50:14] uh uh we see also in in second kings
[50:17] well
[50:18] in in the end of first kings as we
[50:19] transition the second thing we see the
[50:21] death of ahab
[50:22] and we quickly go through all of the
[50:23] miracles we have elisha
[50:25] we have the whole situation with neyman
[50:28] and we went through that we went through
[50:29] the
[50:30] the all of that with the syrian army
[50:32] more force and against us
[50:34] we went through the lepers at the gate
[50:35] we went through the synonymized woman
[50:37] and we would have reached uh
[50:40] chapter eight in our teaching last week
[50:43] with elisha
[50:45] uh come in and give word to the
[50:47] tsunamite
[50:48] and then that woman coming and being
[50:51] restored and getting back the help from
[50:53] the king and seven
[50:55] now we reach chapter nine and this is
[50:57] where we're going to rest our case and
[50:59] our time here
[51:01] to see a very if you ever see action in
[51:04] scripture this is the
[51:06] one of the most action-packed uh
[51:09] it's almost too much action in one so
[51:12] let's
[51:13] let's let's let's start reading so
[51:16] second kings nine and verse one
[51:18] and elisha the prophet called one of the
[51:21] children of the prophets
[51:22] and said unto him so this is like a a
[51:24] junior prophet a servant a
[51:26] assistant this is elijah the prophet
[51:30] called one of the children of the
[51:31] prophet and said unto him good at thy
[51:33] loins
[51:34] and take this box of oil and die in hand
[51:37] and go to ramat gilead
[51:40] so he's commissioning one of these cells
[51:42] in the prophet on a mission
[51:44] he said and when thou come and stood up
[51:46] look out there
[51:48] jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of
[51:51] nimshi
[51:52] so we see in this instruction of
[51:54] anointing jehu
[51:56] is caught up in the ministry of the
[51:58] spirit of elijah
[52:00] because although elijah has not done it
[52:02] the commission has not ended
[52:04] and the commission cannot end because
[52:06] there is another elijah because the
[52:08] spirit of elijah got rest upon elijah
[52:10] we know this so elijah's not there but
[52:13] the spirit of elijah is there resting
[52:15] upon elijah
[52:16] and elijah picks up the mantle of elijah
[52:19] to continue the ministry the unfinished
[52:22] things
[52:23] that elijah did not finish so elisa
[52:26] picks it up now
[52:27] and what is even almost more mysterious
[52:31] is that elijah is not even doing it
[52:33] himself
[52:36] elijah elijah had the commission on the
[52:40] instruction
[52:42] elisha catches it but
[52:45] he delegates it
[52:48] that's a whole longer conversation all
[52:51] right
[52:52] so he commissions one of his servants
[52:55] and listen how this drama builds out
[52:57] and and and it is interesting the mind
[53:00] of god on this
[53:01] but as you read into this you could
[53:03] almost wonder
[53:04] what god showed elijah what god showed
[53:07] elisha about what was about to happen
[53:11] now bear in mind i want us to understand
[53:12] god is a just god
[53:15] he is a god that gives choices he's a
[53:17] god i say in blessing i will bless thee
[53:19] if you do what i want the blessing i
[53:21] will give you listen
[53:22] your enemy can look at it your couple
[53:24] run over when you're reading scripture
[53:26] that's how god talk
[53:27] talk i will make your enemies my enemies
[53:31] that's how god talks but if you do what
[53:34] you want to do
[53:35] if you follow your own way then judgment
[53:38] will come
[53:39] that's that's how god that all god is
[53:41] and but branham said
[53:42] before there could be judgment there's
[53:43] always warning
[53:45] so every prophet when you read it every
[53:47] prophet was speaking about
[53:49] don't do this change your ways repent
[53:51] repent repent repent
[53:53] but i want us to understand that there
[53:54] comes a time when the ministry switches
[53:57] from mercy to judgment
[53:59] and at this point look what's about to
[54:01] unfold here
[54:02] we're going to speed it up a little bit
[54:03] because this is this is this is the
[54:05] action pattern right
[54:07] and when they'll come and stood up look
[54:09] out there jay who in other words find
[54:11] jay who
[54:11] is son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi
[54:15] and go in and make him arise up
[54:18] from among his brethren and carry him to
[54:21] an inner chamber in other words pull him
[54:23] outside in that secret room
[54:24] and take the box of oil and pour it on
[54:27] his head
[54:28] and say so you're giving him your words
[54:30] pure instructions say whatever say
[54:32] thus say the lord i have anointed the
[54:36] king over israel now this is a man
[54:39] nowhere on the
[54:40] radar all right
[54:43] king over israel then listen carefully
[54:45] then open the door and flee
[54:46] and carry not lord help me
[54:50] this is one of the fastest anointing er
[54:52] you'll ever see
[54:54] so you tell him go find this man go
[54:56] unknowing this man
[54:58] when you finish annoying him don't run a
[55:00] no flee
[55:01] because when the anointing touch him you
[55:04] don't want to be around this anointing
[55:07] listen this we read in the bible tonight
[55:09] ryan
[55:10] he said when is anointed in other words
[55:12] i said i don't know what will happen
[55:15] when this anointing come upon him
[55:17] because what he anointed
[55:18] for is different so when is the
[55:20] anointing come upon him
[55:22] run for your life flee don't tarry
[55:25] that's
[55:25] amazing right
[55:29] so the young man even
[55:32] the young man the prophet went to rama
[55:35] gilead
[55:36] and when he came behold the captains of
[55:38] the horse was sitting
[55:40] and he said i have an errand to thee or
[55:43] captain
[55:44] and jehu said unto which of all us and
[55:48] he said to d.o captain so it's a room
[55:50] of commanders these are all captains so
[55:53] it is not as if jehu
[55:54] is of is of of the palace i know the
[55:57] royal family and these kind of things
[55:59] is a military war command meeting that
[56:02] is going on everybody with me tonight
[56:05] all right
[56:10] and he arose and went into the house
[56:14] and he poured the oil onto his head and
[56:17] said unto him does say the lord god of
[56:19] israel
[56:20] i have anointed thee king over the
[56:22] people of the lord
[56:23] even unto israel
[56:27] and thou shalt smite the house of ahab
[56:30] thy master
[56:31] that i may avenge the blood of my
[56:33] servants the prophets
[56:35] and the blood of all the servants of the
[56:37] lord at the hand of jezebel
[56:40] for the whole house of ahab shall perish
[56:43] and i will cut off from ahab
[56:45] him that pisseth against the wall and
[56:48] him that is shot up and left in israel
[56:50] we are finding exact language here for
[56:52] might be ready with your own right
[56:54] and i will make the house of ahab like
[56:57] the house of jeroboam
[56:58] the son of nibert and like the house of
[57:00] basha
[57:01] the son of ahijah and the dog shall eat
[57:04] jezebel in the portion of jezreel
[57:06] and there shall be none to bury her and
[57:08] he opened the door and fled
[57:11] so the prophet anoints give the word and
[57:13] he runs for his life
[57:15] then jehu came forth to the servants of
[57:18] the lord
[57:19] and watson once said unto him is all
[57:21] well
[57:22] i mean is everything okay i see somebody
[57:25] play our side
[57:26] is all well wherefore came this mad
[57:30] fellow to thee
[57:32] so these military men seeing these
[57:34] prophets these spiritual men as mad men
[57:38] and he said unto them so jehu's response
[57:40] and he said to them
[57:41] you know the man and his communication
[57:43] in other words
[57:44] you know that man men and them or their
[57:46] stock
[57:47] that is that how we say but it is
[57:49] obvious something going on because
[57:51] if you pour a whole box of oil on my
[57:53] head
[57:54] it is very obvious that i ain't coming
[57:57] back
[57:58] looking the same way i went out so then
[58:00] fellas watching jehu
[58:02] jai who's saying you know all right my
[58:03] mother's talking they say where is mama
[58:04] come and check you
[58:05] and here it is jehu have oil running all
[58:07] over him
[58:09] and they said it is false in other words
[58:12] don't tell us there's no
[58:13] word man man if it's false we know it's
[58:16] false we see an oil
[58:17] on your shoulder oil on your shoe oil in
[58:19] your head your cabin talks oil
[58:21] running over your face
[58:22] it is false tell us now and he said does
[58:25] and does speak he to me saying
[58:27] thus said the lord i have anointed thee
[58:30] king over israel
[58:31] then they hasted quickly and took every
[58:34] man his garment
[58:35] and put it under him on the top of the
[58:37] stairs and
[58:38] blew with trumpet saying je who is king
[58:42] so then men air waste time in
[58:45] assuming their position and accepting
[58:47] jay who was king now bear in mind
[58:49] jehu is king there is a sitting king
[58:53] the king who is sitting in israel is
[58:55] still jehoram or called joram the same
[58:57] name the same one
[58:58] you see him jehoram who was walking and
[59:01] who the lady had said
[59:03] must this lady and i we did we didn't
[59:06] want we didn't agree to eat one son
[59:07] and then she and then we eat my son and
[59:09] she wanted to hide her son this is
[59:11] him jehoram who is still king right
[59:14] so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son
[59:18] of nimshi
[59:19] conspired against juram
[59:24] now joram had kept rama gilead he and
[59:28] all israel because
[59:29] of israel king of syria so in other
[59:32] words
[59:33] we didn't read it but there was a war
[59:34] there was a battle that took place
[59:37] but king joram was returned to be healed
[59:40] so joram
[59:41] who this is ahab's son you remember we
[59:43] had introduced this
[59:44] that jehoram or juran was ahab's son
[59:47] so aya was his father jezebel is his
[59:50] mother all right
[59:51] the first boy of the first son i think
[59:53] was ahaziyah was
[59:55] ahab son he died of accident and then
[59:57] jehoram became king by default so he was
[1:00:00] the king really for a while
[1:00:01] he gets injured so he decides to go to
[1:00:04] recuperate
[1:00:06] from his injuries in jezreel jezreel is
[1:00:09] the same place
[1:00:10] that ahab had his house before and the
[1:00:13] same place
[1:00:14] where neighbor had his vineyard that
[1:00:16] ahab take over
[1:00:17] so he is there relaxing trying to
[1:00:20] recuperate from his battlefields
[1:00:23] but king joham was returned to be healed
[1:00:24] in jezreel of the wounds
[1:00:26] which is syrians had given him when he
[1:00:28] fought with
[1:00:29] hazel king of syria remember we talked
[1:00:32] about the anointing of the israel
[1:00:33] we didn't touch it but elisha would have
[1:00:35] had an interaction with his year before
[1:00:37] right and jail said if it be your minds
[1:00:41] then let none go forth no escape out of
[1:00:44] the city to go tell it in jezreel
[1:00:46] so jehu upon the anointing and your men
[1:00:49] acknowledging as king tell them don't
[1:00:50] let nobody leave this city where we are
[1:00:52] i don't want word to leave that i have
[1:00:55] been annoying
[1:00:56] anointed as king so jehu
[1:00:59] rode in a chariot and this is the part
[1:01:02] most people remember
[1:01:03] this this small part of jehu right
[1:01:06] and jehu wrote in a chariot and went to
[1:01:08] jezreel
[1:01:09] for joram levy the king of israel and
[1:01:13] ahaziah king of judah who would have
[1:01:15] also been
[1:01:16] joram's nephew so although the two
[1:01:18] kingdoms north and south had two kings
[1:01:21] it was they were actually related by
[1:01:24] family
[1:01:25] so a haziah king of judah had come down
[1:01:28] to see
[1:01:29] jerome to check upon his fellow king and
[1:01:32] they stood a watchman
[1:01:33] on the tower of jezreel and he spy
[1:01:36] the company of jehu as he came and he
[1:01:39] said i see a company
[1:01:41] in other words i see a group of people
[1:01:43] and joram the king said
[1:01:44] take a horse and send to meet them and
[1:01:48] let him say is it
[1:01:49] peace in other words is everything okay
[1:01:51] see how they're coming
[1:01:52] is everything okay so they went one on
[1:01:56] horseback to meet them one at horse and
[1:01:58] said
[1:01:58] just say the king is in peace and jail
[1:02:01] said what has thou to do with peace
[1:02:03] turn thee behind me in other words join
[1:02:05] me
[1:02:06] and the watchman told saying the
[1:02:08] messenger came to them but he committed
[1:02:10] not again in other words we set up a man
[1:02:12] but here coming back he riding with them
[1:02:14] too then he sent out a second
[1:02:17] one on horseback which came to them and
[1:02:20] said does say the king
[1:02:21] is it peace and jehu answered what has
[1:02:24] doubt to do with peace
[1:02:25] turn thee behind me in other words come
[1:02:27] right with me also
[1:02:29] and the watchman told saying he come he
[1:02:32] came even unto them and cometh not again
[1:02:35] and the driving
[1:02:36] wait listen to this is like the driving
[1:02:38] of jehu the son of nimshi
[1:02:40] for he drive it furiously so jai who had
[1:02:43] a
[1:02:43] reputation of how we drive in chariot
[1:02:46] what kind of man this is
[1:02:48] that from a distance the way he moving
[1:02:50] on the road he said i know that driving
[1:02:52] you know
[1:02:52] that looking like jehu all right so this
[1:02:55] is a man who
[1:02:56] has a has a reputation he has a way
[1:02:58] about him he's
[1:02:59] i don't even know what is what what
[1:03:00] driving furiously mean right
[1:03:03] and joram said make ready and his
[1:03:06] chariot was made ready
[1:03:07] now bear in mind at this point juram
[1:03:11] this is one of jerome's generals jehu
[1:03:14] would have been a commander
[1:03:15] in joram's army so jorah i'm not
[1:03:18] thinking
[1:03:19] that that that jehu coming with no bad
[1:03:21] agenda
[1:03:22] he said with this speedy comments
[1:03:24] there's some kind of music coming to
[1:03:25] bring so he said make ready
[1:03:27] and his chariot was made ready and joram
[1:03:30] king of israel
[1:03:32] and a hazard king of judah it's one of
[1:03:34] the few times you see the kings rolling
[1:03:36] together in this way
[1:03:37] went out each in his chariot and they
[1:03:40] went out against jehu
[1:03:42] and met him in the portion of
[1:03:43] neighborhood and jesuit
[1:03:45] and it came to pass when joram saw
[1:03:49] jehu that he said is it peace jehu
[1:03:53] and he answered what peace this is
[1:03:55] jehu's response
[1:03:56] what peace so long as the whoredoms of
[1:04:00] thy mother jezebel
[1:04:01] and her witchcrafts are so many
[1:04:04] and joram turned his hands and fled and
[1:04:07] set a hazard as treachery or
[1:04:10] azaha in other words this thing is not
[1:04:13] it's not what i thought it was
[1:04:14] run for your life and jehu drew a bow
[1:04:18] with his full strength and smote jerome
[1:04:21] you see how this switchy name there's
[1:04:23] the same name but now calling my other
[1:04:25] name and small jerome
[1:04:27] between his arms and the arrow went out
[1:04:30] at his heart
[1:04:31] and he sung dung in his chariot then
[1:04:34] said jehu
[1:04:35] to bidka his captain take up and cast
[1:04:38] him
[1:04:39] in the portion of the field of
[1:04:40] neighborhood the jezreelite
[1:04:42] for remember how that when i and daw
[1:04:45] rode together after ahab his father
[1:04:48] the lord laid this burden upon him
[1:04:50] surely i have seen
[1:04:52] yesterday the blood of neighborhood and
[1:04:54] the blood of his son said the lord
[1:04:56] and i will require thee in this plot
[1:04:58] said the lord
[1:04:59] now therefore take and cast him into the
[1:05:01] plot of ground
[1:05:02] according to the word of the lord so
[1:05:04] jehu is anointed
[1:05:06] and he's quoting back all these
[1:05:08] scriptures all the prophecies
[1:05:10] as he's beginning to close back his
[1:05:12] thread as it were
[1:05:13] to almost start to undo and bring
[1:05:16] justice
[1:05:17] for all that ahab would have wrought but
[1:05:20] when ahaziah is the king of judah
[1:05:22] saw this he fled by the way of the
[1:05:25] garden house
[1:05:26] and jehu followed after him and said
[1:05:29] smite him also in the chariot
[1:05:31] and they did so and they're growing up a
[1:05:33] girl which is by ibrahim
[1:05:35] and he fled to megiddo and he died there
[1:05:38] so in one day both the king of israel
[1:05:42] and the king of samaria is brutally
[1:05:45] killed
[1:05:46] and his servants carried him in a
[1:05:48] chariot to jerusalem and buried him in
[1:05:50] his cifalika
[1:05:51] with his fathers in the city of david
[1:05:53] jerusalem and in the 11th year of jorah
[1:05:56] and the son of ahab
[1:05:57] began as a hazard to reign over judah
[1:06:00] and when jehu was come to jezreel so
[1:06:03] jehu is writing he's in a mission
[1:06:06] all right and we're gonna we're gonna
[1:06:08] talk about jehu because jehu
[1:06:10] when you read it deeper you can see jehu
[1:06:12] end up
[1:06:13] getting so caught up in judgment he
[1:06:15] started to do a little too much
[1:06:19] so it's a it's a big teaching because
[1:06:22] god give him a specific mandate
[1:06:24] yes it's a measure of judgment but jehu
[1:06:27] get a little
[1:06:27] too much into it so when jay who has
[1:06:29] come to jezreel listen now
[1:06:31] jezebel by no jezebel is no longer a
[1:06:33] young girl
[1:06:35] jezebel is now a full-grown much older
[1:06:38] woman
[1:06:38] jessie bell has heard of it and she's
[1:06:41] away but i ran away and she painted her
[1:06:44] face
[1:06:46] and tied her head and looked out
[1:06:49] at a window
[1:06:53] there's a lot i could say there i have
[1:06:55] quotes in it i don't even get hit
[1:06:56] tonight
[1:06:58] and as jehu entered in at the gate she
[1:07:01] said had zimri peace who sue his master
[1:07:04] in other words she is quoting a name
[1:07:07] zimri
[1:07:08] who was a king who served for only seven
[1:07:10] days
[1:07:12] and zimri had done the same thing
[1:07:14] because zimi was also a commander
[1:07:16] who had killed the king
[1:07:19] and killed the family so she had
[1:07:22] perception and understanding of the
[1:07:23] missionary who was on
[1:07:26] and he lifted up his face to the window
[1:07:28] and said who is on my side who
[1:07:31] and there looked out to him two or three
[1:07:33] eunuchs
[1:07:34] and he said throw her down and they
[1:07:36] threw her down and some of her blood was
[1:07:38] sprinkled on the wall
[1:07:40] and on the horses and he trued her under
[1:07:42] foot
[1:07:46] so this started to get to get a little
[1:07:49] dicey here now because
[1:07:51] when you read this to see this is a lot
[1:07:53] to process i
[1:07:54] have to say this if you've never read
[1:07:56] this before
[1:07:58] a lot to process and when he had come in
[1:08:00] he did eat and drink
[1:08:04] so this is a special kind of anointing
[1:08:07] there's a special kind of man
[1:08:08] who could ride up to the palace kill one
[1:08:10] king killing the king
[1:08:12] tell them throw jezebel off the wall see
[1:08:15] then he run his horses over her and then
[1:08:18] he come in and say and i'll
[1:08:19] have anything to to eat but i have any
[1:08:22] food
[1:08:26] and when he come in he did eat and drink
[1:08:28] and said go see now this cursed woman
[1:08:30] and bury her for she's a king's daughter
[1:08:34] and they went to bury her but they found
[1:08:36] no more of her than the skull and the
[1:08:38] feet and the palms of her hands
[1:08:41] and wherefore they came again and told
[1:08:43] him and he said this is the word of the
[1:08:44] lord
[1:08:46] which he spake by his servant elijah the
[1:08:48] tishbite saying
[1:08:50] in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat
[1:08:52] the flesh of jezebel
[1:08:54] and the carcass of jezebel shall be as
[1:08:56] dung upon the face of the field
[1:08:58] in the portion of jezreel so that they
[1:09:00] shall not say
[1:09:01] this is jezebel you know in other words
[1:09:04] god
[1:09:05] was so disturbed by what jezebel and he
[1:09:08] have done
[1:09:09] that this word about jesus was so
[1:09:11] profound that jehovah's anointing
[1:09:14] gave him a special i don't even know
[1:09:16] what the world uses
[1:09:17] that this was this wasn't facing him he
[1:09:19] wasn't warring up
[1:09:20] he he knew what his mission was this was
[1:09:23] just pure judgment
[1:09:29] but it doesn't stop there and ahab had
[1:09:32] 70 sons in samaria
[1:09:34] this would have extended to a family so
[1:09:36] it's not like direct direct food sons
[1:09:38] his family
[1:09:38] and jehu wrote letters and sent to
[1:09:41] samaria
[1:09:42] unto the rulers of jesus to the elders
[1:09:45] and to them that brought up ahab's
[1:09:47] children
[1:09:48] seeing so like the guardians now as soon
[1:09:50] as this letter coming to you
[1:09:53] seeing your masters sons are with you
[1:09:55] and there they are with you chariots and
[1:09:57] horses
[1:09:58] offense city auto and armor look even
[1:10:01] out
[1:10:02] the best and the fittest the meatiest is
[1:10:04] the fittest of your master's sons
[1:10:06] and set him on his father's throne and
[1:10:08] fight for your master's house in other
[1:10:10] words
[1:10:11] jay who is saying are coming pick your
[1:10:13] best fighters
[1:10:14] pick whichever son is the best one make
[1:10:16] him king because they're coming to the
[1:10:18] strikings
[1:10:21] but they were exceedingly afraid and
[1:10:23] said behold two kings shall not be
[1:10:25] before him oh then shall we stand
[1:10:27] so they're saying if jehoram
[1:10:30] didn't even withstand you and they were
[1:10:32] sitting kings
[1:10:34] how we go pick one of these sons to be
[1:10:35] king and withstand you
[1:10:38] and he said that was over the house and
[1:10:41] and he that was over the house and he
[1:10:42] that was over the city and the elders
[1:10:44] also
[1:10:45] and the bringers up of the children sent
[1:10:47] to jehu saying we
[1:10:48] are thy servants and will do all that
[1:10:51] thou shalt bid us
[1:10:52] we will not make any king do that which
[1:10:55] is good in thine eyes
[1:10:59] then you wrote a letter the second time
[1:11:01] today i'm saying if you be mine
[1:11:03] and if you will hearken unto my voice
[1:11:06] take ye the heads of the men your master
[1:11:08] sons
[1:11:09] and come to meet the jezreel by tomorrow
[1:11:11] this time
[1:11:13] now the king's sons being 70 persons
[1:11:16] were with the great men of the city
[1:11:17] which brought them up
[1:11:18] and it came to pass when the letter came
[1:11:21] to them
[1:11:22] that they took the king's sons and slew
[1:11:24] 70 persons
[1:11:27] and put their heads in baskets and sent
[1:11:30] him them to jezreel
[1:11:33] and there came a messenger and told him
[1:11:35] saying they have brought
[1:11:37] the heads of the king's sons and he said
[1:11:39] lay ye them in two heaps
[1:11:41] at the entering of the gate until the
[1:11:43] morning so in other words
[1:11:45] 35 heads on one side 35 heads on one
[1:11:47] side all right
[1:11:48] now this sounds rough this song's
[1:11:50] gruesome
[1:11:51] but the reality is i want us to
[1:11:53] understand because
[1:11:55] we read the message we read the
[1:11:57] scripture
[1:12:00] and at times we don't process judgment
[1:12:02] we don't process
[1:12:06] how god could say slay the amalekites
[1:12:09] say the amorites
[1:12:10] i know god can say i give you mercy i
[1:12:12] bless you take my way but if you don't
[1:12:14] take my way
[1:12:15] then god is a judgment we know this
[1:12:18] world is heading for judgment we know
[1:12:20] judgment is hanging and we say germans
[1:12:21] hanging
[1:12:22] over the world this here in in all of
[1:12:24] what we have read to in
[1:12:25] kings to lead up to this point we're
[1:12:27] actually seeing what the hand of
[1:12:29] judgment looks like
[1:12:31] i wanted to see this now is nothing
[1:12:32] light this is not there is
[1:12:36] nothing get you scared either but it's
[1:12:37] you to understand
[1:12:39] how god operates we need to understand
[1:12:42] that god is the god of his word
[1:12:44] and if god is the god of his word
[1:12:47] and he said the day you eat up this
[1:12:48] street that day you die
[1:12:50] that is his word he has to honor that
[1:12:52] word
[1:12:54] i want us to understand that when god
[1:12:55] say don't be unequally yoked
[1:13:00] when but branham would silly
[1:13:02] prophetically under no circumstances
[1:13:04] should a believer marry an unbeliever
[1:13:06] those are big statements those are
[1:13:08] powerful statements
[1:13:11] they have had a choice his choice
[1:13:14] led to him bringing a woman into his
[1:13:16] house and by virtue of bringing her into
[1:13:19] the house
[1:13:19] brought her into the kingdom in bringing
[1:13:22] her into the kingdom
[1:13:23] he end up building a house for bill a
[1:13:25] altar for bill
[1:13:26] initiate priests for bill end up he
[1:13:29] didn't start that way
[1:13:30] he was bad already but she brought it
[1:13:33] worse
[1:13:33] and it's not the issue of how bringing
[1:13:35] it worse the point is it brought
[1:13:36] idolatry
[1:13:37] and god's imma jealous god in him
[1:13:41] so god here was not this is not about
[1:13:43] people now this is about spirits we're
[1:13:45] talking about
[1:13:46] here so i don't want to see it as as as
[1:13:48] people i want to understand
[1:13:50] it was a spirit and the spirit of
[1:13:52] realism and
[1:13:53] idolatry that had entered into the
[1:13:55] people that god was nowhere in the
[1:13:57] picture
[1:13:58] hear the cry of elijah we read before
[1:14:01] where he said
[1:14:01] look how thy people have thrown down
[1:14:04] everything they knew
[1:14:05] and i even i only i'm the one who's left
[1:14:07] and it was so discouraging to elijah but
[1:14:10] he said you know what take my life to
[1:14:11] now
[1:14:12] because i feel like i can't even fight
[1:14:14] what is going on
[1:14:16] it is so bad and god is saying i will
[1:14:19] not let that
[1:14:19] exist like that i will have to bring
[1:14:22] judgment
[1:14:23] because they have also killed my
[1:14:26] prophets
[1:14:28] so i want us as we go through this to
[1:14:29] understand
[1:14:31] that as we read this god you think god
[1:14:34] will allow all the prophets who have
[1:14:36] gone before this message dripping in
[1:14:38] blood
[1:14:39] so let it reach a point that he will not
[1:14:41] take action
[1:14:44] that god will allow his kingdom
[1:14:47] allow his name allow people to do what
[1:14:50] they want and he will sit back forever
[1:14:52] and do nothing
[1:14:53] i want us to see the connection friends
[1:14:55] with how long he took to even act
[1:14:59] between the time of the word of
[1:15:01] anointing jehu
[1:15:03] because god knew how bad it would get
[1:15:05] and he knew just as elijah had to raise
[1:15:07] up to deal with ahab
[1:15:09] he knew he would have to raise up a jehu
[1:15:11] at some point in time to deal with it
[1:15:15] whether you called jehu gruesome brutal
[1:15:18] fought anointed it didn't matter what
[1:15:19] you call him he was still in the plan of
[1:15:20] god
[1:15:22] because god raised them up and told
[1:15:24] elijah anoint him
[1:15:26] elisha picked it up he has to be
[1:15:27] anointed he sent a servant to anoint him
[1:15:31] maybe they didn't want their hands to
[1:15:32] touch what he had to do
[1:15:34] because they understood the ministry
[1:15:36] that he and the role he had to play but
[1:15:37] his path was important
[1:15:39] because god said i will bring judgment
[1:15:42] for what you have done to my word what
[1:15:43] you have done to my people
[1:15:46] so it's a challenge on leadership
[1:15:48] because ahab
[1:15:49] by being a leader was in a position to
[1:15:52] influence the people who were following
[1:15:56] so he had to take the responsibility
[1:15:59] and the price of leadership because his
[1:16:02] decision to
[1:16:03] marry jezebel and to allow her to
[1:16:06] slowly take more and more and more and
[1:16:09] more
[1:16:09] until he has king she tell him go and
[1:16:12] eat i'll handle it
[1:16:13] and she orchestrates the murder of a
[1:16:15] farmer
[1:16:17] you think god is interested in the very
[1:16:18] simple things in life about
[1:16:20] what happens to his children god said
[1:16:21] what happened with the neighborhood
[1:16:22] there's consequences of that
[1:16:24] the same field the same way neighbor
[1:16:26] died that will repeat again
[1:16:30] and here it is you say a whole line will
[1:16:33] be destroyed
[1:16:34] and here we see a man anointed almost as
[1:16:37] it were with
[1:16:38] without remorse without emotion without
[1:16:40] feeling
[1:16:43] jezebel did he gonna eat food normal
[1:16:44] normal and when he finished it he
[1:16:46] explained to them
[1:16:47] i am fulfilling scripture look you would
[1:16:49] let's go on
[1:16:55] chapter 10 verse 8 and there came a
[1:16:56] messenger and told him saying they have
[1:16:58] brought the heads of the king's sons
[1:17:00] he said lay them in two heaps at the
[1:17:03] entering in of the gate until the
[1:17:05] morning
[1:17:05] so 35 heads on one side 35 heads on the
[1:17:08] next side and leave it there overnight
[1:17:09] so the people seeing this
[1:17:14] and i have a big point to make it in in
[1:17:16] in a while and it came to pass in the
[1:17:18] morning that he went out and stood
[1:17:19] and said to all the people ye be
[1:17:22] righteous behold
[1:17:23] i conspired against my master and slew
[1:17:25] him but who slew all these
[1:17:28] so jay would say listen i killed the two
[1:17:30] kings but who killed these
[1:17:31] because he sent a letter but it was
[1:17:34] their guardians
[1:17:35] and it was their people who killed the
[1:17:36] sons right know now
[1:17:38] that they shall fall upon the earth
[1:17:40] nothing of the word of the lord
[1:17:43] which the lord spake concerning the
[1:17:44] house of ahab for the lord had done that
[1:17:47] which he speak
[1:17:48] by his servant elijah now i want to
[1:17:50] bring this point friends
[1:17:52] we have made it clear the spirit of
[1:17:54] elijah came upon elisha
[1:17:57] the same ministry of elijah was upon
[1:18:00] john the baptist he said ministry of
[1:18:02] elijah was upon william brown on the
[1:18:04] prophet
[1:18:05] i want us to understand when people
[1:18:08] go and make statements against this
[1:18:10] prophet it is a serious
[1:18:12] serious serious dangerous game
[1:18:16] because not one word will come to the
[1:18:19] ground
[1:18:20] even if you don't understand it because
[1:18:22] i wanted to understand how god operates
[1:18:24] somebody could look at elijah and say
[1:18:26] but god tell them to anoint jehu that
[1:18:28] didn't happen
[1:18:36] look how long it take to happen when god
[1:18:39] speaks a word
[1:18:40] it goes beyond time it goes beyond our
[1:18:43] understanding
[1:18:44] once god lets the word out it is
[1:18:47] alternate
[1:18:49] and he can't even take it back so even
[1:18:52] when he pronounced judgment and they
[1:18:53] have all he have fasting and stuff
[1:18:55] didn't change the job done on his house
[1:18:57] he didn't say you might not see it do it
[1:18:59] the way you call the city or the player
[1:19:01] god can let them live and see
[1:19:02] all of it all right so no now
[1:19:05] and i want us to catch his friends
[1:19:07] knowing now that they shall fall upon
[1:19:09] the earth
[1:19:10] nothing of the word of the lord which
[1:19:12] the lord spake concerning
[1:19:14] the house of ahab for the lord had done
[1:19:17] that which he spoke by his silver and
[1:19:18] elijah so and it goes on
[1:19:20] so jehu slew all that remained
[1:19:24] of the house of ahab in jezreel and all
[1:19:27] his great men
[1:19:28] and his skins folks and his priests and
[1:19:31] he left none remaining
[1:19:37] what about total total and he arose
[1:19:41] and he definitely and he parted and came
[1:19:44] to samaria
[1:19:46] so you go into the capital
[1:19:49] and as he was at the sharing house in
[1:19:51] the way
[1:19:53] jehu met with the brethren so he on his
[1:19:56] way he met with the brethren
[1:19:58] of ahaziah king of judah
[1:20:01] now bear in mind judah is a different
[1:20:03] kingdom
[1:20:05] from israel so he met with the bridges
[1:20:10] of ahaza
[1:20:11] king of judah and he said who are you
[1:20:14] and they answered we are the brethren of
[1:20:16] ahazayah and we are
[1:20:18] we go down to saludi chiron of the king
[1:20:20] and he turned up the queen
[1:20:24] and he said take them alive and they
[1:20:25] took them alive and sued them at the pit
[1:20:28] of the sharing house even 2 and 40 men
[1:20:30] 42 neither lefty any of them
[1:20:34] and when he was departed dance he
[1:20:36] lighted on
[1:20:37] jehonadab the son of richard
[1:20:41] and you will actually find johanna the
[1:20:43] son of richard mentioned
[1:20:44] in jeremiah there's a passage of
[1:20:47] scripture
[1:20:48] which speaks of a group a family a group
[1:20:51] of people who said
[1:20:52] we have maintained the law we will not
[1:20:54] drink wine we will not do anything
[1:20:55] because since our father jehorada the
[1:20:58] son of rachel
[1:20:59] so this man he met is a spiritual man
[1:21:03] he is one of the true one of the
[1:21:05] remaining faithful coming to meet him
[1:21:07] and he saluted him and said to him is
[1:21:09] thine heart right
[1:21:10] as my heart is with thy heart and
[1:21:12] yohunadam answered it is
[1:21:14] if it be give me thy hand and he took
[1:21:16] him and he gave him his hand and he took
[1:21:18] him up into the chariot and he said come
[1:21:21] with me
[1:21:22] and see my zeal for the lord
[1:21:27] so jehu is calling this also the zeal of
[1:21:30] the lord
[1:21:31] so they made him to ride in his chariot
[1:21:34] and he came to sumeria
[1:21:36] he slew all that remained unto ahab in
[1:21:39] samaria
[1:21:39] till he had destroyed him according to
[1:21:41] the saying of the lord which he speak to
[1:21:43] elijah
[1:21:45] and elijah and jehu gathered all the
[1:21:47] people together
[1:21:48] and said unto them ahab served baal a
[1:21:52] little
[1:21:53] but jehu will serve him much so
[1:21:56] understand this
[1:21:58] he attacked jezreel first so those in
[1:22:01] samaria
[1:22:02] they don't know what's going on word
[1:22:06] he is moving so quickly those who knew
[1:22:09] he was anointed king they haven't left
[1:22:11] where they at
[1:22:12] he is riding furiously so he's breaking
[1:22:15] his speed limit
[1:22:16] he raised down to jezreel wipe out the
[1:22:19] king
[1:22:20] wipe out jezebel wipe out everybody
[1:22:23] there he writes other areas
[1:22:25] destroy the family now he's heading down
[1:22:27] into into samaria
[1:22:29] and he makes as if
[1:22:32] he is a baal worshiper also i want you
[1:22:35] to catch this
[1:22:37] so jehu guided all the people together
[1:22:39] and said unto them ahab serve bail
[1:22:41] a little in other words if ahab was a
[1:22:44] bear worshipper it was a little bit he
[1:22:46] already wasn't a true
[1:22:47] bl worshipper i am a real male
[1:22:49] worshipper
[1:22:51] and what do they care just say so he
[1:22:54] said ahab served bail a little but jail
[1:22:56] shall serve him much he said no
[1:22:58] therefore
[1:22:58] call unto me all the prophets of bill
[1:23:01] all his servants and all his priests
[1:23:04] let none be wanting in other words don't
[1:23:06] leave anybody out we're going to make
[1:23:08] the biggest sacrifice the bear we ever
[1:23:10] make before
[1:23:12] for i have a great sacrifice to do to
[1:23:14] bear whosoever shall be wanting he shall
[1:23:16] not live in other words we're going to
[1:23:18] do this
[1:23:18] sacrifice massive if you miss it and
[1:23:21] you're a bear worshiper i will kill you
[1:23:24] so jay was saying if we're going to do
[1:23:26] this worship let's do it for real
[1:23:30] but jehu did it in certainty
[1:23:33] to the intent that he might destroy the
[1:23:35] worshippers avail
[1:23:38] and jay who said proclaim a solemn
[1:23:40] assembly for baal and they proclaimed it
[1:23:43] and jehu sent through all israel so this
[1:23:46] is
[1:23:47] it's clean in time this is this is not
[1:23:49] in the amorites or the philistines this
[1:23:51] is in israel
[1:23:54] central all israel all the worshippers
[1:23:57] of baal kim
[1:23:58] so that there was not a man left that
[1:24:00] came not
[1:24:02] so jehu i understand this by calling for
[1:24:05] bail worship
[1:24:07] all them backslidden israelites will
[1:24:09] bail worship i'll say well i
[1:24:10] should be able to you know i worship
[1:24:12] until the bible say everybody who
[1:24:13] worship me will come out right
[1:24:17] so that there was not a man left that
[1:24:19] came and they came into the house of
[1:24:21] vale and the house of bill was full from
[1:24:23] one end to another
[1:24:26] you imagine he cited this this is in
[1:24:28] israel now
[1:24:31] and he said unto him that was over the
[1:24:33] vestry over the area
[1:24:34] bring forth vestments all the clothes
[1:24:36] for all the worshipers of real
[1:24:38] and he brought them for investments and
[1:24:41] jehu
[1:24:42] went to and jehonadab the son of richard
[1:24:45] into the house of bill and said unto the
[1:24:48] worshippers of baal
[1:24:49] search and look that there be here with
[1:24:52] you
[1:24:53] none of the servants of the lord but the
[1:24:55] worshipers of baal only
[1:24:57] so now they're looking at one another
[1:24:58] yeah i know him he does party with me
[1:25:00] yeah
[1:25:01] he does party with me too yeah yeah we
[1:25:03] just this is all i'm not
[1:25:05] this is making sure that the only true
[1:25:07] bell worshippers
[1:25:10] are there and when they went
[1:25:13] in to offer sacrifice and burnt
[1:25:15] offerings jehu appointed
[1:25:17] four scorers 80 men outside and said if
[1:25:20] any
[1:25:21] of the men who i have brought into your
[1:25:23] hands escape
[1:25:24] he had let him go his life shall be for
[1:25:26] the life of him
[1:25:27] so jai who have all the worshippers in
[1:25:29] one house
[1:25:30] put solace around the building and tell
[1:25:32] him if one of them people escape i kill
[1:25:34] him you feel like
[1:25:35] escape jehu ministry is different this
[1:25:37] is not a ministry you can't aspire for
[1:25:39] this ministry
[1:25:40] and it came to pass as soon as he had
[1:25:43] made an end of offering the burnt
[1:25:44] offering
[1:25:45] that jay who said to the god and the
[1:25:47] captain go in and slay them
[1:25:49] left non-comfort and they smote them
[1:25:51] with the edge of the sword
[1:25:53] and the guard and the captains cast them
[1:25:55] out and went to the city of the house of
[1:25:57] bill
[1:25:58] and they brought forth the images out of
[1:26:00] the house of bill
[1:26:01] and burn them and they break down the
[1:26:04] image of bill
[1:26:05] and broke down the house of bill and
[1:26:07] made it a
[1:26:08] draft house onto this day a draft house
[1:26:11] like a cesspit
[1:26:13] that's what that that that's what the
[1:26:14] old text is does jehu
[1:26:17] destroyed bell out of israel
[1:26:26] i'm gonna try to kind of tie some of
[1:26:28] this together
[1:26:29] but i want you to notice this now
[1:26:35] so god is sovereign in how he operates
[1:26:42] and we see here that
[1:26:45] this is accomplished and it's a great
[1:26:47] teaching because
[1:26:48] on the one hand we see god will keep his
[1:26:50] word his word was
[1:26:52] for doing this to my prophets for doing
[1:26:55] this to my people
[1:26:56] judgment will come your worship are
[1:26:58] false gods it was a commandment doubt
[1:26:59] shall have no other god before me
[1:27:01] so this should come as a no surprise to
[1:27:03] us how this plays out
[1:27:05] in a certain sense but i want to now go
[1:27:08] now
[1:27:09] at the character of jehu a little bit
[1:27:13] so we just read thus jehu destroyed baal
[1:27:17] out of israel howbeit
[1:27:21] from the sins of jeroboam the son of
[1:27:23] nabat
[1:27:24] who made israel to sin jail who departed
[1:27:27] not
[1:27:29] from after them to with the golden
[1:27:32] calves that
[1:27:33] were in better and that were in dan
[1:27:38] listen carefully so
[1:27:42] jehu is anointed
[1:27:45] jehu is inspired he goes and destroys
[1:27:49] all the idols of veil
[1:27:52] but he still has some idols in his heart
[1:27:55] that's what the bible is saying here the
[1:27:58] golan calves from bethel
[1:28:00] and from then and the lord said unto
[1:28:02] jehu because that has done well in
[1:28:04] executing
[1:28:05] that which is right in my eyes and has
[1:28:08] done unto the house of ahab according to
[1:28:11] all that was in my heart
[1:28:12] thy children of the fourth generation
[1:28:15] shall sit on the children of israel
[1:28:19] so after jehu's great-grandchildren
[1:28:22] would have been kings because of
[1:28:25] clearing out
[1:28:27] bail from israel but jehovah verse 31
[1:28:31] took no heed to walk in the law of the
[1:28:33] lord god of israel with all
[1:28:36] his heart for he departed not from the
[1:28:40] sins of jeroboam
[1:28:41] which made israel to sin so baal had
[1:28:44] been removed
[1:28:45] but there were still sins that were
[1:28:47] hidden in
[1:28:48] in jehu from jeroboam that he had not
[1:28:51] removed
[1:28:52] and the bible said in verse 32 in those
[1:28:54] days the lord began to
[1:28:56] cut israel short and hazel smote them in
[1:28:59] all the coasts of israel
[1:29:02] so i want us to understand this so that
[1:29:04] even though jihu obeyed the word of the
[1:29:06] lord
[1:29:07] by successfully coming against the type
[1:29:10] of idol worship that was built
[1:29:12] he did not give up the idols that he
[1:29:15] treasured
[1:29:17] so the law rewarded him for his good
[1:29:19] action second kings tentative
[1:29:22] but he had to pay his own price second
[1:29:25] kings 10 32 shows it
[1:29:27] of the cutting of israel short by israel
[1:29:30] because he was also unwilling
[1:29:34] to give up his personal idols
[1:29:38] and if you read hosea in the book of
[1:29:41] hosea
[1:29:42] the lord and speaking to hosea when jose
[1:29:44] had a son he said the lord
[1:29:45] will call his name jezreel for yet a
[1:29:46] little while and i will avenge the blood
[1:29:49] of jezreel upon the house of jehu
[1:29:51] and will cause to cease the kingdom of
[1:29:53] the house of israel
[1:29:55] so god used jehu for a purpose
[1:29:59] jehu was anointed but
[1:30:02] understand his friends the anointing is
[1:30:06] still separate from you
[1:30:07] listening to god's word his instruction
[1:30:09] and living our life
[1:30:10] so that that's why there are many people
[1:30:12] who are anointed
[1:30:14] and they have an anointing with them for
[1:30:16] whatever it is
[1:30:17] but they still have to check what is in
[1:30:19] their hearts
[1:30:20] so i don't want you to ever operate with
[1:30:23] well i i i cut this out and i cut this
[1:30:25] out you know
[1:30:26] ultimately what god is looking for here
[1:30:29] is
[1:30:29] is the scripture of walking in the law
[1:30:32] of the lord
[1:30:33] with all of your heart
[1:30:37] it was there are so many lessons in this
[1:30:39] we don't have time to go through all of
[1:30:40] them tonight
[1:30:42] but this is just another piece of the
[1:30:44] puzzle so to speak because
[1:30:45] god has it here for a reason for some
[1:30:48] who are being introduced this for the
[1:30:50] first time
[1:30:51] well there will be a lot to come out of
[1:30:52] this for those who are familiar with
[1:30:55] this
[1:30:55] i hope this begins to close some pieces
[1:30:58] for you so you begin to understand
[1:31:00] a few things one is god started this
[1:31:03] prophecy about jehu
[1:31:04] way back before elisha was even
[1:31:07] commissioned
[1:31:08] because the commission of elisha and the
[1:31:10] commission of jehu
[1:31:12] was coming at the same time so god knew
[1:31:15] he would need a jehu to deal with what
[1:31:17] ahab and they did
[1:31:19] god was pleased with part of what jehu
[1:31:22] did and because of it
[1:31:23] down to his grand his
[1:31:24] great-grandchildren were kings only
[1:31:26] throne
[1:31:29] but within jehu's heart issues that he
[1:31:31] himself
[1:31:32] didn't overcome and his zeal of the lord
[1:31:36] was in part it was right but it was
[1:31:39] it was also convenient because he didn't
[1:31:42] go after everything else
[1:31:44] he didn't extend his zeal to go after
[1:31:46] his own idols
[1:31:48] so i want to kind of close it with this
[1:31:50] there are many people
[1:31:51] who take one aspect of the word
[1:31:55] or one aspect because here it is jehu
[1:31:58] i'm balancing it now
[1:31:59] jehu was quote in quotes elijah said
[1:32:02] this is why i did that
[1:32:04] elijah said this is why i did that
[1:32:05] elijah said this is why i did that
[1:32:07] and he's absolutely right in taking the
[1:32:10] quotes and placing it there
[1:32:12] and god using him to fulfill that
[1:32:16] well that was his portion but somehow
[1:32:19] jehu missed all of the scriptures
[1:32:23] all of the quotes all of the words that
[1:32:25] dealt with him
[1:32:26] having his own idols i want to encourage
[1:32:30] us tonight
[1:32:31] to not be convenient with how we
[1:32:33] approach you would
[1:32:35] i want to challenge us tonight that we
[1:32:38] can't take the part of the world that we
[1:32:40] want to
[1:32:40] go to town with and press people with
[1:32:43] we have to take all of the word
[1:32:47] we have to take everything and walk with
[1:32:50] this
[1:32:50] in all of our hearts at all times way to
[1:32:53] straighten up the key lesson here
[1:32:56] is about removing idols because god ends
[1:33:00] this by saying
[1:33:01] he did not stop the golden calves
[1:33:05] so the real lesson here was not about
[1:33:08] bail it was about the idol bill it was
[1:33:10] about the golden cup it was about idols
[1:33:12] or anything else
[1:33:13] that taken the place of where god is
[1:33:16] supposed to be
[1:33:18] because at the end of the day his
[1:33:20] decisions
[1:33:21] to not deal with the sins of jeroboam
[1:33:24] and have the golden calves
[1:33:26] from dan and better that were in that
[1:33:28] and better dealt with
[1:33:30] men there were still idols and later on
[1:33:33] it would lead them into captivity
[1:33:36] so jehu went with his zeal but he didn't
[1:33:39] go all the way
[1:33:40] he went overboard it would seem in one
[1:33:42] direction
[1:33:44] because there were certain elements of
[1:33:45] the instruction that he kind of really
[1:33:48] went with a bit he did what he was
[1:33:50] supposed to do and then and god said he
[1:33:52] carried
[1:33:52] right in my eyes and has done into the
[1:33:54] house of ap according to all that was in
[1:33:56] my heart
[1:33:57] and he gave him a blessing because of
[1:33:59] that
[1:34:02] but what god wants is a total cleaning
[1:34:05] of our lives
[1:34:07] a total cleaning of our hearts
[1:34:12] it was easy for jehu to see what other
[1:34:14] people was doing
[1:34:15] but at the same time we have to admit
[1:34:17] because god draws it to
[1:34:19] our attention he would have been king
[1:34:21] for 28 years
[1:34:24] after he wiped out the bill
[1:34:27] he sat as king for 28 years
[1:34:31] the lord blessed him for his role and
[1:34:34] for what he did
[1:34:35] in because baal was just horrible
[1:34:37] killing the prophet was horrible so god
[1:34:39] dealt with that but god still wasn't
[1:34:40] pleased
[1:34:42] so i want to nail down that you cannot
[1:34:44] settle
[1:34:45] for just the blessing of doing part of
[1:34:47] it
[1:34:48] i wanted to see above this story to see
[1:34:51] that god
[1:34:52] really wants 100 of our hearts
[1:34:56] he picks man with a certain character a
[1:34:58] certain nature
[1:34:59] so when he wanted the new testament he
[1:35:01] found paul paul was an academic paul was
[1:35:03] a as a writer paul was a man who was
[1:35:05] studied under gamaliel so he found a man
[1:35:07] to write
[1:35:08] and he found a man to bring things up
[1:35:10] when he wanted to do this particular
[1:35:11] thing
[1:35:12] he found a man named jehu a man a
[1:35:14] commander a war man
[1:35:17] who would have no issues doing this and
[1:35:19] the anointing that was upon him
[1:35:21] clearly the prophets understood it you
[1:35:23] tell him listen run for your life when
[1:35:24] you put it
[1:35:25] wrong for your life because i don't know
[1:35:26] who you're gonna kill
[1:35:28] because that's his ministry that's what
[1:35:30] he's called to do but friends
[1:35:32] no matter the ministry or the calling or
[1:35:35] the anointing
[1:35:36] in this season we have to do because
[1:35:39] god is not in jehu took
[1:35:42] no heed that no heed meaning that he was
[1:35:46] given the cues you know
[1:35:47] i wanted to catch that he was given i'm
[1:35:50] trying to close you know
[1:35:51] he was given the cues the heed he was
[1:35:54] given the the the
[1:35:56] the nudge to go all the way
[1:35:59] but he went as far as he wanted to go
[1:36:04] anybody with me tonight he went as far
[1:36:07] as he wanted to go i just want to read
[1:36:10] one
[1:36:10] one thing here
[1:36:23] is is he amplified took no care
[1:36:27] took no heed
[1:36:31] so he wasn't careful about it he didn't
[1:36:33] try to
[1:36:34] to go deeper than his his his anti-bail
[1:36:37] thing
[1:36:38] so friends i trust tonight was
[1:36:41] a bit more of a teaching or more of a of
[1:36:44] exploring
[1:36:45] another aspect of this journey in second
[1:36:47] kings
[1:36:48] and i pray that it will encourage you
[1:36:50] but a browner would have referenced many
[1:36:52] aspects of this in particular he would
[1:36:53] have
[1:36:54] struck this jezebel spirit because
[1:36:58] all of this ramp up in bail worship came
[1:37:00] from jezebel
[1:37:02] so let us bow our heads a word of prayer
[1:37:04] tonight
[1:37:05] as we approach the throne of grace
[1:37:12] and before we pray i want to challenge
[1:37:13] you tonight
[1:37:19] don't have an idol
[1:37:22] but i branham said you can make anything
[1:37:23] are good you can make anything idol
[1:37:26] you can make sports your idol you can
[1:37:29] make
[1:37:30] your car idol you can make a man a woman
[1:37:33] your idol you can make your job your
[1:37:35] idol
[1:37:36] you could make alcohol your idol you can
[1:37:39] make anything of god because god is an
[1:37:40] object of worship
[1:37:44] this teaching tonight is to check your
[1:37:46] heart
[1:37:47] because your idols will lead to
[1:37:49] destruction
[1:37:51] i want to challenge you church in this
[1:37:52] season some people make
[1:37:54] watching news more important than
[1:37:55] anything else in the world they worship
[1:37:57] the news
[1:37:58] they worship the report they worship
[1:38:00] politics they worship all kinds of
[1:38:01] things
[1:38:04] anything that takes you away from god's
[1:38:06] business is an idol
[1:38:10] i want us to cast down idols tonight
[1:38:14] and i want us to find back the balance
[1:38:17] to not just last out at the things that
[1:38:21] easy to point at bill what should be
[1:38:23] what's your bill worship deal worship
[1:38:27] it is easy many people say he doing
[1:38:29] wrong he did it wrong he did it wrong
[1:38:30] and behind these scenes they have their
[1:38:32] own issues that i don't want anybody to
[1:38:33] know about
[1:38:35] and god is saying every idol has got to
[1:38:37] go shall we pray
[1:38:38] heavenly father lord we come tonight
[1:38:42] lord to look at this jehu who went from
[1:38:44] a soldier to a king
[1:38:46] that was prophesied lord even before
[1:38:49] elisha who was the prophet of the time
[1:38:51] was
[1:38:51] was in place you spoke to elijah about
[1:38:54] him
[1:38:55] elisha picked it up lord because you saw
[1:38:58] how it will all unfold
[1:39:00] and how idol worship would start subtly
[1:39:03] with this marriage between ahab and
[1:39:05] jezebel
[1:39:06] and it will grow and grow and grow lord
[1:39:09] until prophets would be killed
[1:39:11] lord the bible goes on to say that lord
[1:39:14] the sacred places
[1:39:15] law where people worship you were
[1:39:16] destroyed and under and the priests
[1:39:19] under and
[1:39:20] and and and the prophets lord were
[1:39:22] hunted and destroyed
[1:39:23] lord with with infiltrates in israel as
[1:39:26] it will
[1:39:27] lord and so too we see lord the attack
[1:39:30] against your people
[1:39:31] and the subtle idols lord idols on on
[1:39:34] social media
[1:39:35] we see idols on the television we see
[1:39:38] idols in movies
[1:39:39] we see idols in the workplace we see the
[1:39:41] idol of money
[1:39:42] we see different kinds of idols lord our
[1:39:45] people worship
[1:39:46] not even realizing that they have
[1:39:48] displaced your place
[1:39:50] in their hearts lord and to see how you
[1:39:52] would raise up
[1:39:53] lord and anoint jehu to move through to
[1:39:56] bring and begin to push back restoration
[1:39:59] and to begin to deal
[1:40:00] law with judgment for what was done we
[1:40:03] know judgment is hanging over your
[1:40:04] people
[1:40:05] it was elijah in that day elisha in that
[1:40:08] day
[1:40:08] and we too have had elijah in our day
[1:40:11] and we know judgment is over your people
[1:40:13] lord but we want to lord cover your
[1:40:15] people tonight
[1:40:16] lord with a a spirit of repentance lord
[1:40:19] to clean out our lives before judgment
[1:40:21] because judgment is coming
[1:40:23] judgment is set it's already set it's
[1:40:25] already in motion it's already
[1:40:26] spoken further but we want to take time
[1:40:29] where there's still a space of grace
[1:40:31] a space of grace to correct the things
[1:40:33] that need to be corrected
[1:40:35] a space of grace to look into the word
[1:40:37] and to make sure we do all that we could
[1:40:39] do
[1:40:40] lord to change our walk to change our
[1:40:42] talk to
