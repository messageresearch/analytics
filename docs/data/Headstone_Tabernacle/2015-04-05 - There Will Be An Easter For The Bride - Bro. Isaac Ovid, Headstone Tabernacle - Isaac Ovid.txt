last year 5 years ago 10 years ago what lies the devil s to you I'm not talking about that this morning all we're talking about is he's not dead He's Alive he is not dead he is alive this message is not dead it's alive and it's all over me and it's keeping me alive it's all over you and it's keeping you alive that's what we came here this morning amen so pray for me as well for this entire week I've been struggling with my throat with the virus but the virus was finished on Friday night when Jesus died on Calvary he died for all sickness all disease all suffering the devil is just playing games this morning but we still the devil notice that the tomb is empty that the grave is empty Hallelujah you don't hear me this morning Buddha is dead confucious is dead muhamed is dead kristna is dead but Jesus he's alive this morning Hallelujah if you know he's alive Give the Lord a shout of Praise this morning amen special greetings to all those connected on the internet this morning and those who would hear this tape this this morning amen I want to salute brother Anthony for his message on Friday night you appreciate brother Anthony amen amen amen so this morning I like to get straight to the word straight to business this morning we have an enemy to fight and we have a God to lift up higher so can we stand our feet and turn to three portions of scripture we want to go to the book of St Mark The Book of Romans and the Book of Revelation amen going uh to the book of St Mark chapter 16 Romans 8 and Revelation 1 reading in Mark 16 and reading from verse 1 and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and salomi have brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the suula at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the Stone from the door of the seula and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering into the saula they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted and he saith unto them be not AF frighted he seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee there shall you see him as he said unto you reading Romans 8 and verse 11 Romans 8 and: 11 but if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you I'm reading Revelation chapter 1 reading from verse 12 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and C above the PS with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white as wool as white were like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burn in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp Ted sword and his countenance was as the sun shine it in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of Death Shall We bow our heads for word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you this morning for your love for your mercy to us Lord and any man can read a scripture but it takes a whole Holy Spirit to breathe life upon it father we thank you this morning for Lord having the opportunity to celebrate another Easter Sunday in your house father Lord we thank you for the Blessed opportunity to be alive to worship you and to praise you now Lord now for the next few minutes may you bless the reading of the word may you bless the hearing of the word the speaking of the word may you take me completely out of the way and speak directly to your people may you use me as your instrument father Lord God may you deliver your people this morning morning may the shout of the king be in the camp may you Lord God Save The Sinner that's here this morning revive the backslider the downtrod him may you fill with the Holy Ghost this morning Father may we have a Easter Revival in the church this morning Father May the cries and shouts of worship go up Lord and join the Heavenly chorus father as we Unite with Believers around the world and this morning who have a true Revelation that you are not dead you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord God we pray a special blessing on our pastor this morning Lord that you would touch him from the crown of his head to the SES of his feet and father may you be with your children this morning Lord may you lift us up and tell us what you want us to hear today in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and the church says amen you may be seated this morning amen so for a title this morning there will be an Easter for the the bride that's my title this morning there will be an Easter for the bride and my subject who will roll away the stone who will roll away the stone and my inspiration if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you can the church say Amen so the devil is a liar this morning everybody knows that right the devil is a liar this morning he's been saying that you're not going to make it he's been saying that you're wasting your time he's been saying you're not going to get the Holy Ghost he's been saying that you're not going to understand he's saying that you're a nobody but I have a question this morning if you are a nobody then why is the devil even messing with you if you are a nobody why are you even still having mind battles I say this morning you are a threat to the devil's Kingdom when you woke up this morning Satan said I hope this morning is not like that morning Satan said I hope this morning is not like that morning because that morning the devil still hasn't recovered from that morning brother Benjamin the devil still has not recovered from that first Easter morning and this morning I believe that the bride is in a position to have her Easter if the groom had his Easter brother brandom said the bride has to have her Easter and the groom's Easter suck the world for 2,000 years now the bride is about to have her Easter and it's not going to shake for another 2,000 years it's going to be a short quick message to shake the whole nation and all the rest of hell and every spirit is going to be subject to this bride because Christ will beeve in this Bride Can the church say Amen so I'm prophesying this morning there will be an Easter for the bride and I believe this morning that Easter morning there's Dawn there's light coming but the BR preaches rising of the Sun what I say this morning the sun is rising it's rising over you this morning the sun is rising over you this morning can the church say amen hallelujah don't worry the devil is already trembling it doesn't matter how you feel your emotions have nothing to do with it what your eyes see have nothing to do with it what you're feeling on the inside have nothing to do with it having the virus has nothing to do with it being sick has nothing to do do with it being backslid has nothing to do with it being dead doesn't even have nothing to do with it because an Easter morning the dead came back to life so I don't care if you've been dead all week all month all year dead since you come into the message dead since you're in church uh this morning there is power to raise you up uh you are not going to leave here on a wheelchair you're not going to leave here on a stretcher this morning the Holy Ghost is here to bring a resurrection in your life uh to bring a resurrection in your walk uh to bring a resurrection in your talk uh to make a in your house in your [Music] family oh you may be seated you got to help me preach this morning my throat is already weak but God is strong this morning he tell let the weak say I'm strong the preacher could never bring the Revival so I hope you brought your Revival this morning you may be seated so I'm just warming up a little bit so the devil send sickness to cut your life short he but we come against sickness this morning you are going to be reminded this morning you shall not die but live uh Satan could not stop Jesus uh death could not stop Jesus the grave could not stop Jesus listen Satan thought that Jesus was going to stay dead but Easter was coming oh somebody say [Applause] amen the mistake The Devil Makes is that he thinks whatever condition you're in you're going to stay in that condition it is confusing to me because the devil was always listening to Jesus's Services the devil was always trying to know where Jesus was going he should have known better because Jesus told his disciples I'm going to lay this body down and in 3 days I'm going to raise it up again he said destroy this Temple and in 3 days I'm going to raise it up again the devil should not should have known better he believes but he doesn't believe everything but this morning the devil doesn't even realize that what we see with our eyes is irrelevant the grave could be seen with a stone this morning but that stone is moving this morning that stone is being rolled away this [Applause] morning there will be an Easter for the bride there will be a bride's Revival and it's starting right now it's already started it's already on it's already happening if you could just get in the spirit if you could just get in the spirit and feel the rustle in the mberry [Applause] tree Hallelujah you belong to God you don't belong to the devil you don't belong to the world Satan trying to hold you but Satan I got news for you when Christ died we were in him when he died uh when he rose again we rose with him uh don't look at me right now don't look at me right now you better be afraid because my Easter is coming my Easter is coming my Easter is coming my Easter is coming somebody say amen hallelujah you may be seated you belong to God and I'll tell you something if you take something that belongs to me I'm coming to get it I'm speaking about myself now not anybody else if you take something that belongs to me you have a problem with me because I'm coming to get it back and the same way God is uh you touch God's anointed you have a problem with God he's coming to get it back and I don't care how far you have gone how low you have gone his hand is not too short to pull you out of the bar to pull you out of depression to pull you out of your mind battle to pull you out of your situation you may be seated he's not going to leave you he's not going to leave your family he's not going to leave your friends in the hands of the enemy he's going to take it back you don't belong to Satan you might be backsliding this morning but backsliding doesn't change your ownership you still belong to God you might be sick this morning but you still belong to God you might be defeated this morning but you still belong to God you might be dead like Lazarus but you still belong to God Lazarus come forth this [Applause] morning you made me seated Hallelujah Lazarus was dead for 4 days his body was already messed up and Jesus said roll away the stone I can't get to him if that stone is in front of him roll away the stone take away the obstacle take away the barrier take away the hindrance take away everything from in front of you that is hindering God reaching to you this morning roll away the stone don't roll the stone halfway don't roll the stone 3/4 away but roll away the stone roll away the stone you don't hear me this morning roll away the stone I don't know what kind of stone they had in Lazarus but my Bible tells me there was a stone that they placed in front of the Tomb when Jesus was buried inside the tomb the Bible says it was a great Stone you may be seated the Pharisees the statues and the Romans said let's put a stone in front of Jesus tomb because we heard a rumor that there there's a talk in the town that Jesus is going to raise from the dead we don't know if it's true or not but just to be sure we don't want to take chances so let's put a stone a great Stone historians said it took about 20 men to put the stone in place to lock the stone not only that tomb was down in a valley so it was not a tomb in front of a straight wall it was down in a valley so the stone was resting on a hole that was at an incline so you can just roll it along the axis no no no no no it was almost embedded on the tomb and not to take chances to put Gods to God the tomb the devil don't want to take chances for you to have your freedom the devil don't want to take chances for you to have your Victory so he said bring a big Stone a stone of condemnation a stone of sin weighed down by your past and he said put Gods put demons to block the [Applause] stone somebody help me this morning you may be seated but we read the scripture that morning that morning this very morning this is our spiritual birthday this morning this is our birthday this morning you may be seen it that morning Mary and salomi and the sisters gathered together and they had fate to just get to Jesus they knew he was dead they had fate to just get to Jesus they didn't work the whole plan out they didn't work the whole thing out they just packed their ointments they just packed their oils and they walk into Jesus and along their way to service they ask themselves a question who will roll away the stone they didn't even know how the stone was going to move they themselves weren't even convinced understand this they themselves who were under Jesus's Ministry for three and a half years they want to even convince that he was going to raised from the dead you don't get me this morning the very disciples that Jesus spoke to Peter James John they were in hiding Jesus told them in 3 days I'm going to raise again again those Brothers went into hiding it took a few sisters like we have some sisters this morning who don't care about what the devil says it took some sisters the brothers were Mia missing in action you may be seated the brothers were m a missing in action Peter wasn't there James wasn't there John wasn't there and these sisters taking their time coming to service every Sunday come to service every Thursday come to service they say we got to do Jesus one last service you may be seated you may be seated they came for their last service with Jesus you may be [Applause] seated I feel a rumble in the camp I feel like I can start to preach now brother kangali I feel like they have the devil on the ropes and I like when we have the devil on the ropes because whenever you get him on the ropes all you got to do is keep punching keep just don't stop don't stop we got him on the ropes this morning you may be seated so those sisters they had enough Hai this was going to be their last service with Jesus because they didn't know what was going to happen next according to Jewish tradition sisters are not supposed to anoint the bodies it was supposed to be brothers supposed to be the males in the family traditionally to anoint the bodies but the brothers were nowhere around God help us find the brothers who could take their place in the church and begin to call for fire but that's another service so these sisters they brought the ointment they brought the oil but they had a big problem because as far as they understood there was a great Stone the Bible says in front of the Tomb and the only question they had is who will move this stone for ush they knew their strength couldn't move it they know they didn't have enough people to move it but they said who will move this stone for us [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah but I love this gospel I love this gospel and the enemy has put a lot of stones in our lives a lot of obstacles a lot of barriers all of the barers of your past of your mind battles of different situations heal barriers family barriers people on the job different situations to just prevent you from getting to Jesus but as these women draw closer they made a discovery like we are going to make this morning that the stone was already rolled away what they have been trying to move for all this time was already rolled away what they were trying to move had already been rolled away so you have a question this morning Who Will Roll Away Your Stone I say this morning that same Jesus he is still in the Stone Rolling business he is still in the Stone Rolling business you may be seated I asked myself the question who was the first witness on Easter morning and the first witness of the resurrected Christ was that stone [Music] woo because when Jesus rose from the dead that stone began to tremble because the stone at the builders rejected had become The Headstone of the corner you can't lock up the Chief Cornerstone you can't lock up this Jesus that stone knew its place I wasn't there when the stone rolled away but the one thing I know when Jesus began to move towards the stone the stone recognize its maker the stone recognized God the stone recognized listen many people have been crucified before but this was a different kind of testimony this was the first one who got back up after he was knocked down because God knew that there were going to be hundreds of people thousands of people who would come later on who would get knocked down but they will share the same testimony they're going to get back up [Applause] Hallelujah and I left my notes [Music] already so this morning I don't care what condition you in whether you consider yourself as bad as lazaros or worse like the valley of dry bones that just had no life I see this morning these bones are going to live again amen the calebs that are on the edge saying I've been in this thing for so long I lost my joy I lost my Zeal will God ever answer my prayer can these bones live and I say this morning these bones are going to get some some some muscle and some flesh and some skin and the breath of life is going to come into your house into your Christian walk until it becomes so tangible it becomes so real that backsliding is no longer an option that the world is no longer an option that what the world has to offer is no longer an option can the church say Amen hatred had a beginning and will have an ending sickness had a beginning and will have an ending doubt had a beginning and will have an ending fear had a beginning and will have an ending nervousness had a beginning and will have an ending sin had a beginning and will have an ended Satan had a beginning and will have an ending but you you never had a beginning because you were always in God you were always part of God before there was a moon before there was a star before there was a molecule before the foundation of the world you were in God's thoughts and you can't fail because God can't fail you are going to have a testimony you may be seated we spend so much time brother Steven preaching about Samson and pre about Daniel and preaching about all of them and they are looking down saying I can't wait to hear your testimony how you made it in 2015 when all hell was against you when the internet was against you when the school system is against you with all the drugs and the pornography and the music and the movies and the Styles and the passion and this and that and you made it [Applause] [Music] so we are not afraid this morning from a message of restoration of the Bride tree but the ROM said Easter is the resurrection restoring to restore back it's God's restoring time you look out over the Earth God is restoring restoring what nature that's right he's restoring the flowers he's restoring the leaves he's restoring the fruits of the field what is it God is restoring it's Easter it means to bring it back and we have power here this morning to enforce give it back Satan what is it enforcing give it back restore it bring it back to its right owner and if Satan listen has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or daughter of God we have a right this morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God to bring them back do you believe it this morning there's a law of life you God put a law of life in the birds they can't help but [Applause] fly God put a law of life in the fish they can't help but swim and in the Christian in the bride he put a law of life of the spirit and when the season comes and when the time comes when the moment comes it's time to say give it back and down will come charity down will come the Holy Ghost oh I feel religious this morning I feel excited this morning to know all that and I lost I'm going to get it back somebody say Amen hallu so Easter is all about Jesus it's all about Jesus it's not about us it's all about it's all about Jesus and the Bible tells the story of when Day Jesus was so tired he was so wary from preaching from teaching that all the virtue had left him and I shared this with the young people all his strength had left him and it's very almost difficult to understand how almighty God could be so physically weak but he was subject to the same things that we are sometimes subjected to amen he went through the same emotional roller coaster so to speak that that we go through and Jesus was so weak the Bible said that They Carried Jesus into the boat and that word carry was to physically carry so I want you to picture the same Jesus that walked on water here he is being physically lifted into the boat as some of us sometimes we need something somebody to just Lift us up a little bit amen and it's important to have the right people around you who could give you the right words of encouragement sometimes there are lot of other people who like to delve in the negativity and why don't you go and drink and why don't you go and party and why don't don't you go and do this but but these brothers they looked Jesus and took him into the boat because just before I guess he was just too tired as py say I I have to go to the other side and he didn't understand what he was talking about but these brothers were so obedient that they just responded to his need that he had to go to the other side and Jesus is so tired he falls asleep on the boat and brother bam said that the devil took the opportunity to try to wipe him out raise up a big storm and here it is Jesus in the boat and he is so tired he's so weary that the winds don't wake him up and the and the waves don't wake him up and the screams of the brothers don't wake him up and these were experienced fishermen they were not used to going over on that other side because that side were where the heathens were but just being obedient they did the best they could to salvage the situation until somebody said let's let's wake up Jesus let's let's get Jesus involved in the situation and they woke Jesus and Jesus turned to his disciples and say oh ye of little fate and he rebuked the storm and say peace be still and Jesus went back to sleep and they asked themselves a question what manner of man is this that even the wind and the Seas obey him and Jesus went back to sleep because he was still tired but the power was still in Jesus and Jesus what he did was just he had to do that but he was on a destination yes sir because on the other side there was somebody on the other side yes sir there was somebody living on the other side he didn't have the opportunity to hear Jesus or see Jesus or speak to Jesus so almighty God saw it fit to send Jesus to him and the Bible says that this man was living in tombs he wasn't living in a house he wasn't living in a tent he wasn't living in a cottage he was living in tombs and he was tormented by demons he was tormented by Spirits the Bible call the spirits that were upon Him Legion but when Jesus stepped out of the boat and this man saw Jesus the Bible says he bow down to worship and that's a powerful mystery right there friends because all of the demons in him could not stop the seed that was in his soul it was not the spirits that were upon him that was worshiping but there was a seed in his soul that recognized the master and all the filed was in his life for that moment when he saw Jesus he fell down to worship because as much as the devil attacks your mind and attacks your body your soul has has a sign on it that says access denied access denied I heard about a country preaching in that he said no matter what mind battle the devil bring to your mind what sickness he brings to your body on your soul is written access denied he can touch he can touch your soul you are predestinated to receive the Holy Ghost you may be seated and because there's a Eed in your soul how your hair is right now doesn't really matter the clothes you have on this man didn't even have on clothes the Bible says but the seed and his soul connected to the great Creator and without Jesus speaking a word Jesus life was so powerful that the demons upon that man said why have you come to torment us why have you come to bother us and those demons made a request to send them into the pigs and Jesus cast these demons out into the pigs and those pigs ran into the sea and that man listen you know what the Bible says he went and put on clothes so when you see people ling a wet clothes because soon the spirits left him he ran and got some cloes CL and the people Marvel is this the same man it used to take a whole bunch of people to hold this man but is this the same man and this man began to testify in fact he wanted to go with Jesus but Jesus said no you testify to your family testify to your neighbors testify to your friends and listen listen the people in that area were so upset with Jesus because they used to raise pigs and when Jesus put the spirit in the pigs and the pigs ran into the sea they said Jesus killed their whole business and they ran Jesus out the tongue but Jesus wasn't concerned about that he was concerned about the predestinated seed that one soul that had a seed inside of that soul and God is going to hunt you down he will find you wherever you are wherever there's a predestinated seed because the devil cannot touch your soul [Applause] somebody say Amen am that's why the devil's only Power is your family and your mind and who said this and you get Disturbed and you get thrown out the spirit and you Fe to come to church and you're just frustrated and is your husband and is your wife that have nothing to do with your soul you have to become Vigilant about your purpose until nothing moves you you have to begin to separate what's natural from what is spiritual but for you to do that you have to roll away the stone of all the stuff that you have in your life that does not belong there and you have to be vigilant about it brutal about it from this day on nothing will hinder my walk with [Applause] God from this day forward not friend not family not job not relationship husband wife no husband no wife bad husband Good [Applause] Wife nothing will separate you from the love of God can the church say [Applause] Amen talking about Jesus hallelujah what manner of man is this he was a man when he was Weeping at the grave of life Lazarus but when he said Lazarus come forth he was Hallelujah he was more than a man he was a man when he was looking for something to eat and he saw the Fig Tree had no fruit but he was more than man when he took Five Loaves and two fishes and Hallelujah F 5,000 but the B said what kind of God is that who could take cooked fish break it and make cooked fish bypass the oven take cooked bread break it and make Coke bread just like the first Coke bread he was a man when he was hungry but when he was breaking I I wish I was in that day you imagine all the businessmen all the bakery owners today wish they could see that when he could just make bread on demand like that but that was more than [Applause] [Music] man hallu God that was more than a man that was God but the B said he was a man when he was tacked at the cross that's right as a sacrifice to take away sin Hallelujah he was a man when they drove the nails into his hand he was a man with thorns over his head he was a man that mockery Soldier spit on him he was a man was bruised and stripped and wounded he was a man when he cried my God why hast Thou forsaken me he was a man crying for help but Easter morning when the seals of death broke loose at the tomb that was more than man he proved that he was God can the church say [Applause] Amen why had to be Shepherd but the bom said no wonder the mountains jumped and shouted on that day no wonder the sun hid its face and screamed for Joy no wonder all NAA broke loose the wind shook the trees until they shook and Shook and joyed and and jump they seen the prophet Shepherd on the mountain redeem every name on The Book of Life they seen their own nature was redeemed they scream and jump and the world went into an earthquake and the mountains rent and the Rocks fell out and the sun went down and everything PL took place can the church say Amen the moon turned to blood everything amen hallelujah thank you Jesus and that Mighty con went down into Satan's headquarters to get something from the devil because Abraham and Ezekiel and Daniel and they were all locked up in Paradise Beau all waiting for somebody to come and get them out so Jesus went down and interrupted the devil's celebration because the devil thought that Jesus was dead and finally the greatest problem ever had was finished when Jesus said it is finished the devil say yes finished and then there's a knock on the door and Jesus comes down and not only he comes to get all those who are locked in Paradise because he took the keys of death and hell not just death alone you know he took the keys to hell which mean the devil is running around in hell and he don't even have his own keys right [Music] [Applause] so you know people tell me ask how how how are you doing whether I living in Hell or no well don't worry Jesus got the keys that's it he could unlock you this morning I don't care what kind of hell you're going through this morning Jesus took the keys of death and hell so death has no power over you and hell has no power over you because Jesus took the keys he can let out who he wants to let out and this morning the house of hell has got to give way to the name of Jesus you have got to go free because all the doors are unlocked this morning all of the doors are open this morning and you could go free if you want to go free you could shout if you want to shout you could worship if you want to worship you can say hallelujah if you want to say hallelujah you can have Revival if you want to have a Revival you can have joy if you want to have joy because there's nothing stopping you there is nothing against you there is nothing against that Joseph Perfection seed I don't care what your flesh did I don't care what your mindset that seed inside of you is perfect this morning and there's no hell could hold you no demon could hold you no sickness could hold you no depression could hold you no problem could hold you [Applause] Hallelujah can the church say amen and the mighty conqueror he rose with the keys of death and hell and roll away the stone and stepped out and he left an angel there to testify so that when people come looking for him the angel could say why are you looking for the living among the Dead God is not dead he is not here look at where you laid him God left an angel to point to look at the evidence yeah he was here but he's not here no more and you're going to have the same testimony you were backslid but you're not backing no more look at the drugs you left look at the clothes you left look at the friends you left look at the problems you left yeah he was here but he's not here no more he's ra from the death he has a new life he has a new walk he has a new talk he has a new inspiration he has a new anointed and you can't kill him again because he already rose from the [Applause] dead can the church say amen hallelujah amen amen amen so Christ the word has been placed into your heart that's right and Satan has tried to block the life in you from being lived out just like he tried to block Jesus try to bind the word with denominational Stones try to bind the word with all kinds of stones and the question was asked by this woman who would roll away the stone and Jesus himself he break that seal to uncover what was there to show you that there's life beyond the river to show you that there's hope to show you that after this there's something else and we ought to check up ourselves to ensure our destination the world wants you to think that this is your home and this is your destination and to have a plan for your future but this natural world doesn't hold your future your future belongs to God your future is belonging to the Heavenly places can the church say amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord so this morning there will be an Easter for the bride amen prom but the B said in a message the restoration of the Bride tree now all the bugs that hell could turn loose in her will never stop her talking about this bride no communism Catholicism no nothing else will stop it I will restore sayth the Lord all the man-made Roman trees will never hang it there all the graves will never keep it there all the big denominational Stones laying at the door will will never keep it there I will restore say the Lord there will be an Easter I'll bring forth the same church in its same power it I'll bring that bride out just like she was back there with the same signs the same fruits the same things that they did I'll bring her back again I will restore say the Lord can the church say amen amen amen and this is where I got my inspiration this morning from the same message but B said I'll send forth the evening light and it'll bring back the word making it manifest I will restore all that I've promised all that I've promised the same holy spirit will bring and bear the same signs I'll have an Easter a resurrection for the bride the same as I had for the bridegroom can the church say amen and brother brand said the resurrection was proof that scripture was fulfilled about Jesus yes sir amen amen because when you really study the story of Jesus up until that time not even the disciples really truly believed him but when Jesus rose from the dead their faith became anointed Peter had Faith he said bid me to come and he walked on the water that took Faith but when Jesus rose from the dead his resurrection Ministry anointed their fith yes sir to a fate that was not like the original feet this was seven Thunder anointed Resurrection feet and that is the faith that drove them to the upper room waiting for the promise to be manifest so I pray this Easter your faith becomes anointed by this message of Malachi 4 that has brought back evidence that he is not dead but he is the same yesterday he is the same today he is the same forever and he has the same power that he had back there can the church see amen I'm not going to be too much longer with you amen praise God from the message it is the rising of the sun I just want to nail this down here but the B said no matter how much theologians claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much like the Bible until that wave sheath until listen the Holy Spirit comes upon that person to Quicken that word the gasoline represents the word is the truth but without the spirit it won't move the Bram said we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamic that's right he said it takes the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest it and bring to pass that this is gasoline so brother BR is saying all the word that you hear every service is gasoline but the only way to prove that it's gasoline is to light a match right now brother the band said every Church saying they have gasoline every Church saying they have word as gasoline which is mechanics but it takes a spark Hallelujah it takes the spirit to put the match on it light it a fire and when that catches a fire then you know that you know that you know that is really gasoline we're getting to something now so listen butam typed it like this he said Jesus was a fulfillment of scripture that's right but the Jews were used to prophets used to Miracles used to all of this but the proof that he was Messiah was when he rose from the dead that was when the matches hit the gasoline and the fire exploded then that was proof there was no doubt there was no question there was no debate and there's coming a moment when God himself will strike the match in this [Applause] church and all the word you've been hearing all these years [Applause] will will catch a fire and then you're going to see a a prize Revival then you're going to see a seven tunder Revival because what will it be mechanics and Dynamics together can the church say [Applause] Amen so right now everybody in the message is debating on gasoline is a gasoline debate un Leed super how much impurities what's in the gasoline the makeup of the gasoline that's the debate that's what brother Bram said he said that's it but there's coming a proving time so you have to make sure you have the right gasoline in the gas store you get super and un leted but here we talking about is pure gasoline the whole the whole concept of un Le is to take the lead out take the impurities out right but when we come to this kind of Holy Ghost gasoline there's no impurity because it has to be the word self so that when the matches strikes because if you have impurities in there when the match strike it could burn out but when it's a real thing it keeps on burning all the way to your Redemption can the church say Amen is that why we spend so much time trying to nail down the word listen in the Pentecostal church you can sit down and just say jump jump shout shout raise your hand and then go back home you know and there's no word there when Dynamics strike it only bring up what's there which is not much that's amen amen so we it took a prophet to come and restore tie up all the Loose Ends every mystery amen so that we can have the fullness of the word and the fullness of the word restored is the mechanics we are contending for to connect with Dynamics because he is the Dynamics can the church say amen and the Christ which is the spirit and Dynamics he wants to unite with you and create an explosion can the church say Amen is that striking home this morning and that will be the Easter for the bride yes sir that will be the bride's Revival so what are we doing all these Services cleaning out the church tying up the Loose Ends rolling away the stone so that there's no hindrance there's no obstacle in your life in your heart no ought butam said if there's one ought one some of us holding Millions all against your school teacher all against your brother all against the man who a bad drive all against this that all over and brother if you have one ought in your heart against listen a saint or a sinner that's a serious reuk know because you have those who who love just like the Pharisees they love their own God bless you brother and they have no fellowship with the neighbor forget he yes he just going to hell is that Christian Behavior your neighbor because you don't see them on Sunday morning you don't worry about them you just leave them one ought in your heart against a sinner or a saint and you are in danger of Hell Fire amen bring back the Old Time Gospel bring back the old time way listen that's what this Rapture is going to come for you know those who want to live this word live every word every word that's gasoline every word people miss church for no reason no reason no reason when the Bible commands us assemble yourselves together especially as the day approaching assemble more so not take chances with your [Music] soul honor your father and your mother so your days would be long the only commandment in the Bible with a blessing honor your father and mother it doesn't say whether they in church whether you're out of church whether they know the Bible whether they don't know the Bible honor them regardless of what so that your days will be long they could be in the bar right now honor them give them respect because that is the word [Applause] whether he is at home out of home give him respect because the Bible says honor your father and your mother so that your days would be long bring back the Bible but there will be an Easter for the bride and every word that's why every loose end will be tied up because God is coming for a bride not for a church church is for church members there are many churches this morning but Bride is a different thing Al together bride is people who could take the word and apply to them to their Liv without hesitation without fear without favor without thought of what the consequence is because they want to live the word they love to hear the word they want to read the word they want to be in the word they don't want to come to church they want to be word prde they want to live word word word word word because that's gasoline gasoline because one day God is [Music] coming spark spark spark fire fire [Applause] fire can the church say amen amen real bride not fake bride real bride can the church say amen amen the brandom said there's been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one Hallelujah there's to come a real prde there must come one that that's not only God the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes the church live move in what the power of his resurrection amen amen amen until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there has got to be Dynamics to make it work brother bam said that is what he proved that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave Shake into life and rise again and roll away the stone amen amen I am he that was dead so dead Till The Sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the Stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he was not only the mechanics God's word he was the Dynamics to prove it amen am just a few more cours and I'm done and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's a part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others have spoke of the Bride In other words if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one the woman taken from his side she has taken on the feminist Spirit from him Hallelujah brother BR went on he said if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the pride because whatever he did the pride must do the power he had the pride must have the same Works he did the pride must do the same signs wonders miracles The Pride must do so get ready get ready get ready because Greater Works than these shall you do that's what you are called to do there will be an Easter for the [Applause] pride Hallelujah last quote on this but random said it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is no matter how good the preaching is no matter how good the teaching is no matter how good you know the word until the Dynamics comes when the dyn dams come that fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and when that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection somebody's say Amen so when you see somebody jumping and shouting in the spirit they having a little Revival because there's a little spark that's coming to the gasoline in them but one day there's the great Dynamics will come to the entire bride and we'll have a super church we'll have a Revival you won't be able to sit down in church and put your hands like this no you'll be jumping you'll be shouting you'll be you can help yourself why because it'll be power it'll be fire it'll be the Holy Ghost in action in The Bride Can the church say [Applause] Amen so this morning the bride there will be an Easter for the bride just as Jesus proved scripture the bride will also prove scripture because she will be a continuation of the word and every single scripture that is left to be fulfilled is the bride's Ministry because with this bride all will be completed everything is to be fulfilled in this bride all will be fulfilled in you so if you don't want to believe it that's you but you have to receive that all is going to be done by you your feelings don't matter all is going to be done by you you have a promise any day now Jesus Christ the person the resurrected Christ will step into you can the church say Amen that is your promise Christ in you the hope of glory Christ Living in you Christ walking in you Christ talking in you Christ moving in you can the church say amen and you'll turn to your family you may be seated you'll turn to your loved ones and your family wouldn't see you they'll see Jesus it'll be the same Jesus walking living talking seven lived voices seven manifestation of one Holy Spirit as Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brly kindness Charity Walk in the streets in ARA in sang Grandy in Deo Martin in maraval in Belmont in chonas in Maro all over the country it'll be that same Jesus that's the Thunder that shakes the devil that's the power that shakes the devil we have had enough of church but now it's time for the Thunder now it's time for seven thundering voices to utter on this island can the church say Amen the musicians can get [Applause] ready hallelujah hallelujah wonderful Hallelujah that's the Thunder that'll shake the devil in a time when they say the young people can't make it in a time when they say the young people are all messed up it'll be the person of Jesus Christ the angel the Unseen captain of the host the same angel that was in the prophet will be veiled in a people amen veiled behind 16 elements huj it'll be that same Jesus veiled behind human skin it'll be that same Jesus veil in a fivefold Ministry amen it'll be that same Jesus that will heal the hard cases it'll be that same Jesus that'll give out the seed germ it'll be that same Jesus to redeem your children to redeem your family to reach those who don't even want to come to church right now to reach those who don't want to hear the word right now to reach those who have given up right now it'll be that same Jesus to walk up to them and say will thou be made whole God is looking to have some hands some eyes some feet somebody to use some vessel that would be surrendered that will be an Easter for the bride because it'll be the resurrected Christ in operation in our days somebody say [Applause] amen hallelujah hallelujah he might look like man dressed like man but it'll be God filed in that man it'll be the person of Jesus Christ the resurrected Christ and these signs shall follow them that believe right now we have the mechanics but by prophecy the Dynamics is here to produce seven Living Voices not just voices laying dormant but living moving vibrating so there's no more excuses this morning the word is being made flesh in you word and spirit together then you become a living example a living living Monument an example seed son whether your mother didn't get it whether your father didn't get it whe whether your brother or your sister don't get it but you got it because you are an individual predestinated from before the foundation of the world to be a manifested son to be an Epistle of God read of all men because this is seed time this is briide time this is your time [Applause] [Music] now Hallelujah amen glory I believe God is now ready this Easter to call a church to Perfection by his word Jesus Christ just as justification made a way for sanctification and sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost has made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come down in Perfection back to the word because God will have a perfect church that will be the Easter for the bride a perfect Church in action listen what's a perfect Church there'll be no mistakes in the church that's powerful brother bam spoke of a where sin cannot stay in that church sir sin can't exist in that church amen everything will be in order the musicians will be in order the song leader will be in order the minister will be in order everything will be in order a perfect Church Amen brother BR said I long to walk into a church that was in order and God will have that kind of church some of you may not make it into that kind of church that's the truth but God will have those who would live in that kind of [Applause] church a church where sin cannot stay in it can the church say Amen every word from the pulpit will come from God every word will be directed by God because it'll be God speaking God veiled once more behind human skin right now all the ministers are all mechanics waiting for Dynamics but when the spirit for to the denam is come then you will see who is Pastor and who is Apostle and who is teacher and who is evangelist amen you wait till the denam is come to operate what's in the church and then you will see sin called out in the church people want to come to church and do what they want and sit in the church when that time comes sin will be called out it'll be another book of Acts that will be an Easter for the bride back to ananas and you have lied to the Holy Ghost amen drop dead in the church amen because it'll be Jesus Christ operating his church can the church say amen amen amen so we are in Harvest time we are in another Easter the spirit must bring forth the potential in the seed you may not have the Holy Ghost yet but you are going to get the Holy Ghost you are not healed yet but you are going to see your healing because you were already healed waiting just for the manifestation of it and in this harest time the the Holy Ghost must be manifested in you any day now what are we looking for a short quick message to shake the whole nation can the church say Amen but this is a secret friends the rain cannot fall before it's time [Music] right it has to fall in its season we don't have the seasons like in the temperate countries where there is summer and fall and winter but you cannot have Easter in summertime you can't have Easter in Fall Easter could only happen after winter so after summer then there's fall and all of the leaves fall of the tree then you go to the winter period the cold period a dry period Hallelujah you can't move as you want to in the winter because it's cold it's dry all the life leaves the leaves and all the fruit dries up and everything life comes down into the root amen you could call for sunlight and call for life but if you're in the winter you got to wait till winter is over it can happen before it season but when the season changes and the leaves begin to get back their life and the rising of the sun takes place and the snow begins to melt and the season comes around and there's another Easter then listen everything that looked Dead all the trees that lost their leaves all the trees that lost their fruit all of the trees that just looked as if there was no life then all of a sudden the life come back and there's a resurrection because there's an Easter and this whole world has gone through all of these seasons and we are listen we are at the end of winter breaking into our Easter can the church say Amen all these years that Alpha Church died and went into the ground and all these years has been going through something going through something but this morning I see the rising of the sun I see the bride coming into Power I see the young people coming to know who they are can the church say Amen am musan begin to play something I'm closing out GL Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah final quote brother B in the message who is this says something had to take place because a living Christ was amongst a living people something had to take place the coming of the Holy Ghost in This last days has caused somewhat a like manner stir amongst the people of the coming of the Holy Ghost in these last days has sent forth a Revival a people that's called out separated a people that's free in their religion that shout and screams the Praises of God that believes in signs and wonders Hallelujah and the religious world looks on and say what's the matter with them people who is this what's causing this or might I say what is this what is this that causes this if they would only read the scriptures they would find out that it's the spirit of Christ promised by God that in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and there'll be a latter rain a rain of the spirit of God falling upon the people in the last day and he said there'll be a latter rain and a former rain in the same time so this morning I say I hear the sound of the abundance of rain and I see that cloud like a man's hand and it's over you right now Church there will be an Easter for the bride be encouraged be excited stay on fire stay present your breakthrough is at hand your deliverance is at hand your Victory is at hand may the Lord bless you hallelujah hallelujah [Music] oh give him praise this morning give him praise this morning hallelujah
