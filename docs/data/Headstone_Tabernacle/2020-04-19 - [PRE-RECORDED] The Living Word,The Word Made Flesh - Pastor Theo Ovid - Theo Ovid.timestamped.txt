[49:59] you invited to be a partaker of his
[50:02] divine nature that was nothing but the
[50:04] word but Isaac that was the absolute
[50:07] Word of God when I first come to this
[50:16] message I always believed that anybody
[50:17] could crack the pyramid that's gonna be
[50:20] it the secret was how to get inside
[50:21] there it was always a secret because the
[50:24] pyramid is what Bible there are three
[50:26] Bibles you know that right one under
[50:29] stars
[50:30] do react and the second was what
[50:33] pyramid and the third was this
[50:35] violet we have but a pyramid as a
[50:38] mystery insider dear
[50:39] isn't that right anyhow we want to get
[50:41] into the word and I trust the Lord

[51:17] more love more power
[51:19] isn't that right we have to get dear it
[51:22] will take love to enter inside ideal
[51:24] let's go this week President Putin made
[51:29] another major announcement to his
[51:32] Parliament or whatever it is and he
[51:34] claims that Russia now has an invincible
[51:37] nuclear weapon that can strike any part
[51:41] of the world that cannot be intercepted
[51:43] and he give an animation in it on the
[51:46] screen of a video showing Russian
[51:49] warheads speeding towards Florida and
[51:51] missiles out maneuvering obstacles in
[51:54] the southern Atlantic Russia has a new
[51:59] class of weapons President Putin said on
[52:01] Thursday that could make America
[52:03] defences obsolete
[52:06] listen to what this prophet said in the
[52:08] uncertain song we live in a day of
[52:10] uncertainty we live in the day when
[52:13] there's everything almost that we can
[52:15] put our hands on natural is unseated
[52:17] there's so much uncertainty till the
[52:20] nations are quaking there is uncertainty
[52:22] in our national security there is no
[52:25] nation safe anymore we could either be
[52:28] the victims to Russia by midnight
[52:30] tonight or either be in bits it depends
[52:34] upon what Russia wants to do about it
[52:36] we are talking about our scientists they
[52:39] are men that they can put 200 miles in
[52:41] the air in a little machine that come
[52:43] right over and setting right on top of
[52:44] this nation I send a message down and
[52:46] said either surrender
[52:48] we pull the lever that's all of it they
[52:50] don't have to wait till tomorrow to do
[52:52] it they can do it right now so put it
[52:57] this way the things are set I think they
[53:01] call this bomb that they have Seaton - I
[53:03] don't know if you know the first one
[53:05] that they had that can reach America and
[53:06] so on Colette season 1 so that is season
[53:09] 2 they have right now and it's it's
[53:11] fixed the prophecies are dear and that's
[53:15] why the Prophet said we are striving to
[53:17] enter into the kingdom of God before the
[53:20] plague strike a lot of foolishness would
[53:23] disappear as the pressure comes on as
[53:25] the Bible speaks of a time of trouble
[53:27] such as never was since there was a
[53:29] beginning of times but they're gonna be
[53:31] here
[53:32] isn't that right so we want to make sure
[53:35] that we put our best into the service of
[53:38] the Lord to receive what he has from us
[53:41] because only one place that can strike
[53:44] and that's the word only one place that
[53:48] cannot strike and that's the Word of God
[53:51] there is no hidin place
[53:53] hallelujah can't say gone to this nation
[53:56] or this country there is no item please
[53:57] but yeah yes Christ is that vehicle to
[54:00] take you out of here
[54:01] amen so are you ready for the word this
[54:03] morning amen but a man a man Jubilee a
[54:07] say for this world as we see this
[54:08] morning has to be fulfilled
[54:10] it is God's thoughts made manifest by
[54:15] his word and brought to a reality now in
[54:19] the beginning was the word and the word
[54:22] was with god and the word was god the
[54:25] word was the beginning but before it was
[54:28] a word the word is a thought made
[54:31] manifest before you speak your thing is
[54:35] not right
[54:35] so God had to think it before he could
[54:38] make it a word and when he spoke it the
[54:41] word it materialized so you come from
[54:43] thought to word to material Isaiah 51 55
[54:49] 11 so my world that God father of my
[54:51] mouth it shall not return to me void but
[54:53] it shall accomplish that which I please
[54:56] it shall prosper in the things that I
[54:59] sent it
[55:00] so God would can't feel we know that
[55:03] once God said it it has to come to pass
[55:06] because it comes from his thinking his
[55:08] thoughts and if God spoke about your
[55:11] deliverance your brick true whatever it
[55:13] is that can feel he himself can't even
[55:16] cancel it or glory to God because it's
[55:19] mulch pocket it can't come back empty
[55:21] your deliverance cannot come back empty
[55:23] your healing can come back and your
[55:25] freedom your victory can come back
[55:29] because it come out the mouth of God not
[55:32] the motive man Mulder man will fail but
[55:34] once the motive God speaks head or glory
[55:37] to God hallelujah not man's word he said
[55:40] my world shall return to me void Oh
[55:43] hallelujah so core of the sentence word
[55:46] in this hour to call out the people his
[55:49] name Jacob Ryan isn't done right so in
[55:52] the beginning was the word the Word was
[55:54] with God or because in the beginning was
[55:56] Elohim and the waters middle him isn't
[55:58] that right and it's the same thing just
[56:00] unfolding like the attribute is your
[56:02] thought and Gordon the big and eternal
[56:05] he wasn't even God he was eternal he
[56:07] wasn't even God because he was eternal
[56:09] he was Elohim the self existent one
[56:12] isn't that right and then he was
[56:14] worshipped and then he became God after
[56:16] creates any Angels he wasn't even that
[56:19] he was LM eternal but in him was
[56:21] thoughts here we go that he wanted to
[56:23] become material he wanted to become sail
[56:28] out material for glory Liguria sons
[56:32] locked up in him he had ports locked up
[56:36] in him and he wanted to become material
[56:39] and the Bible says and the word became
[56:42] flesh and dwelt among us
[56:44] so the thought comes from thought the
[56:46] word then the word becomes flesh and
[56:49] when the word become flesh is material
[56:51] so Jesus wasn't just flesh he was the
[56:55] word made flesh
[56:57] that's what you want to be Oh glory to
[57:00] God you are gonna be the living world
[57:02] the word itself made flesh Oh glory the
[57:08] poor until all this was a message riding
[57:13] me for a while and it will tie right
[57:15] into what but Isaac spoke last service
[57:17] in particles of this vine nature so
[57:20] let's go he was even that he was Elohim
[57:23] the eternal but her name was thoughts he
[57:25] wanted to become material and what did
[57:28] he do he spoke a word and the word was
[57:30] materialized
[57:31] dönitz here we go that's the whole
[57:34] picture from Genesis to Revelation it's
[57:38] nothing wrong it is Elohim materializing
[57:42] so he can be touched so he can be felt
[57:46] so full court was above us in the
[57:48] Fatherhood God was with us in the son
[57:51] Jesus Christ and God promised to come
[57:53] into you he always wanted a dwelling man
[57:56] he always wanted you to be his house to
[57:59] be an actor and he's one of our people
[58:02] that he go to live in Oh glory to God
[58:05] are you are you ready this morning oh
[58:08] this is a good menu this morning oh this
[58:12] is a full seven-course menu this is not
[58:15] soup it's a little more than that this
[58:17] morning hallelujah praise God praise God
[58:20] are you ready and then then he said in
[58:24] the Millennium there'll be LOM sitting
[58:25] on the throne that's right with all his
[58:27] subjects i wronged him that he
[58:28] predestinated before the function of the
[58:30] world from things that are out to be
[58:32] your bullet here was pre-planned shot on
[58:36] that one
[58:39] don't tell me or what the ones that
[58:41] bought you and you're coming if I didn't
[58:42] want you and your mother didn't want you

[58:53] one egg and you as among all of them

[58:58] some jump over so but court pre-plan
[59:01] your birth on this earth he won't
[59:04] mistake you are not here by chance do
[59:07] not even a little service by chance get

[59:34] knows and to be infinite you know every
[59:37] free will be on the earth you know much
[59:39] time in the batter's eye that's infinite

[59:45] of God we know where we are living we
[59:47] know the are we live in it
[59:48] we know what lays ahead we see what we
[59:51] have past the book of God is the
[59:53] revelation of Jesus Christ
[59:54] his work to the ages that was up to the
[59:57] book of Revelation
[59:58] then his promises that is to come so all
[1:00:00] of his promises are true give the Lord a
[1:00:04] shelter not all of his promises are true
[1:00:08] and God cannot speak anywhere without
[1:00:12] that being confirmed every word that he
[1:00:16] says has to come to pass
[1:00:19] under Paris at all that Bella near shall
[1:00:23] worship the Beast except those whose
[1:00:26] names written before the foundation of

[1:05:33] you may be seated
[1:05:35] who you think was veiling that prophet
[1:05:37] what was stated they think I'm a desert
[1:05:40] if you don't idle words what Spirit
[1:05:43] spoken words that's what we can't just
[1:05:45] bring our own thoughts and ideas it has
[1:05:47] to be spirits words because I
[1:05:49] know that's why I know if I stay with
[1:05:51] this world

[1:06:27] excited about
[1:06:32] we go God hi Jesus
[1:06:38] [Applause]
[1:06:41] let's continue from spirit of truth I
[1:06:44] might not call her the names that box is
[1:06:46] too much that's like one tip I give it
[1:06:48] respect is the play tip and we to be
[1:06:50] players players up tips like if like if
[1:06:52] Gordon has to be T players not me I'm
[1:06:57] safer preacher you're causing to puppet
[1:06:59] the priests who want to play by the
[1:07:01] bottom the energy that's fine we played
[1:07:02] too but that's not it : no this is what
[1:07:05] we have to do I would like to tell you
[1:07:07] how much books I have to cover to get
[1:07:09] what I'm prettier today right now I
[1:07:12] bought about how about six already
[1:07:13] alright let's continue one of the great
[1:07:17] problems for God don't chew the years as
[1:07:21] the history of the church goes is to
[1:07:25] find somebody that he can completely get
[1:07:28] in his control everybody wanna be
[1:07:36] somebody but not somebody for God
[1:07:38] because God somebody is mash up men
[1:07:42] broken men God Mendes mistreat and what
[1:07:46] is break them you know you have to break
[1:07:48] them to make them because gonna leave
[1:07:50] them they were act just like Manda's
[1:07:52] with the greed and the selfishness and
[1:07:55] the politics that is man as he neared
[1:07:57] young man you remove one crop the next
[1:08:01] one is that occasional end up crooked
[1:08:04] because that doesn't mean the heart of
[1:08:06] man is desperately wicked spider who can
[1:08:10] know it but God
[1:08:12] so that's why go sit good man I'll give
[1:08:15] you a new heart you need a new one let's
[1:08:19] let's take a transfer
[1:08:20] give me your old one give you a new
[1:08:21] heart I'll give you our new spirit and
[1:08:23] I'll put my spirit into your spirit
[1:08:25] cause you connect with my word okay the
[1:08:28] Lord a shout in the house so the issue
[1:08:35] has always been a man surrendered to God
[1:08:38] JC people want supernatural and signs
[1:08:40] and wonders and purifying lights and so
[1:08:42] on they won't go to come down and so on
[1:08:44] to say I am right and all others is
[1:08:46] wrong and God is not on that God not I'm
[1:08:50] trying to vindicate a church or a man
[1:08:52] he's here about vindicating his word
[1:09:02] if I die in the morning the word is
[1:09:04] still true if I die in the morning the
[1:09:07] promise is correct this word will be
[1:09:10] confirmed
[1:09:11] oh give the Lord a Shh all right he know
[1:09:17] what he needs one man he always used one
[1:09:19] man at a time we started a few nights
[1:09:21] another group you just want one that's
[1:09:23] all he needs cause two men have two
[1:09:24] different ideas he just takes one man
[1:09:26] and watch he just makes one man he
[1:09:28] represent himself true that one person
[1:09:30] never did he do it otherwise and he's
[1:09:32] got one person today and that person is
[1:09:34] the one we just read after the Holy
[1:09:37] Spirit that one send me the man he had
[1:09:47] one person that is the Holy Spirit he is
[1:09:50] the person that God has sent forth the
[1:09:54] spirit of Jesus Christ into the earth
[1:09:57] the Spirit of God the manifest and
[1:10:00] declare Christ to his church just to
[1:10:02] continue his life to the church he
[1:10:06] Christ was the Living Word of God yes
[1:10:09] why because he was expressing God to
[1:10:13] himself he was soul completely
[1:10:17] surrendered to the word till he and the
[1:10:20] world was the same and that's exactly
[1:10:24] what the church ought to be today
[1:10:27] that the Word of God is the same what is
[1:10:30] he saying we have to become the very
[1:10:32] Living Word of God itself isn't that
[1:10:35] right so therefore you have a choice
[1:10:38] today to receive the word inwardly and
[1:10:41] willingly as opposed to be outwardly
[1:10:44] informally you have a choice to receive
[1:10:48] the word as from God or if it was a man
[1:10:52] trying a little thing was a man trying
[1:10:55] something well he trying something but
[1:10:57] if it's a Word of God you have to
[1:10:58] receive it in early and willingly
[1:10:59] because they receive the word you become
[1:11:02] the word itself
[1:11:04] so butter Branham was brain father we
[1:11:07] thank thee that I would I would his
[1:11:08] truths we tangley for the Holy Spirit
[1:11:10] who is the Living Word here tonight to
[1:11:13] manifest any divine blessings that God
[1:11:15] Almighty has promised and now Lord Jesus
[1:11:16] to see that you were conceived here and
[1:11:19] is lit by the Holy Spirit and he wrapped
[1:11:21] himself in a blood cell broke the cell
[1:11:23] open Calvary no man takes his life
[1:11:25] alarum his life freely and the blood
[1:11:27] cell was broken here we go because the
[1:11:30] spirit could be made free from the blood
[1:11:32] coming into the body again coming
[1:11:34] through the blood it was given and his
[1:11:36] body came water blood and spirit just
[1:11:38] like a natural bird water blood and
[1:11:41] spirit and I pray tonight if there's
[1:11:43] someone here who has never come into the
[1:11:45] body of Christ watch now
[1:11:47] to become a full believer sealed
[1:11:50] unrecognized by the Father God that this
[1:11:53] would be the right night that they will
[1:11:54] receive it granted Lord to thy mercy we
[1:11:57] ask oh praise God so the true call of
[1:12:01] God is the broken blood cell of Christ
[1:12:03] that released the Spirit of God to pull
[1:12:06] you into the body and by one Spirit we
[1:12:08] are baptized into that body not into a
[1:12:11] church in a church a fellowship but that
[1:12:13] spirit pulls you into the body of Christ
[1:12:16] where you are placed into the body of
[1:12:17] Christ so he Christ was deity himself
[1:12:21] made flesh on earth the manifest his
[1:12:23] love to the people under take away sin
[1:12:25] of the earth he came here in order that
[1:12:27] he could anchor depth in his own body
[1:12:29] because that was the curse the day you
[1:12:31] eat thereof the day you die so death was
[1:12:33] the curse upon the earth so he came to
[1:12:36] anchor death like a stinger he came to
[1:12:37] pull debt and unlatch it in his body I
[1:12:40] posit that where is your sting grave
[1:12:43] where's the victory because Jesus come
[1:12:45] on Brit because of debt that we'd have
[1:12:47] to fear death no more but we could free
[1:12:50] that's why I come that you might have
[1:12:51] life and have it more abundantly
[1:12:54] Oh give the Lord some praise as people
[1:12:56] listen listen he came here in order to
[1:13:00] anchor death in his own body
[1:13:02] you can anchor sickness in his own body
[1:13:03] or glory to God the kiss that ought to
[1:13:06] have been on you he took it upon himself
[1:13:08] and had to die like a man

[1:37:45] becomes life and then you become a
[1:37:48] living example then you are epistle of
[1:37:51] God read by all men Oh glory to God
[1:37:54] looting them disciples in the early days
[1:37:57] our Bibles the bad was even written yet
[1:37:59] the New Testament was written yet and
[1:38:01] then Old Testament was big long screws
[1:38:03] so they can't walk along with a coat I'm
[1:38:05] big screws wrong a rule in the prophecy
[1:38:08] no they were the living will itself
[1:38:10] when the speak was the word it was the
[1:38:12] Word made flesh Oh hallelujah Oh glory
[1:38:16] to God you believe that Thank You Laura
[1:38:19] so the mind in Christ you take the word
[1:38:21] just like he did because he was the word
[1:38:23] and the man of Christ in you you are the
[1:38:25] word you are the gods live in word
[1:38:27] representatives of him here on the earth
[1:38:29] continue the work the church should be
[1:38:31] that way so the Bible is manifested
[1:38:34] again like in the early days of the
[1:38:37] disciples they had no scripture what
[1:38:39] they were preaching what scripture
[1:38:40] because they were the Living Word and
[1:38:43] we'll come back to that you know after
[1:38:44] court knowledge yes they'll come on all
[1:38:46] we do have the caution or we will be
[1:38:48] decodes be caught made flesh or chlorine
[1:38:51] a continuation of the Living Word or
[1:38:53] glory Christ veiled in Tabernacles
[1:38:56] walking on two feet in Trinidad you may
[1:38:59] see that yet but it won't happen
[1:39:01] Oh glory to God however recognize Christ
[1:39:04] you're gonna walk like him you're gonna
[1:39:05] talk like him
[1:39:06] you're gonna live like him you're gonna
[1:39:07] love like him you're gonna forgive like
[1:39:09] him ain't gonna he like him you're gonna
[1:39:11] act like him that's how you know Christ
[1:39:13] Oh God no I'm not Amida butsu mañana got
[1:39:21] plenty - I'm a talking murder mystery
[1:39:23] see my hello so he was Hitler and find
[1:39:26] like a blasted ministries no it's not a
[1:39:27] blossom mist regional is the emphasis
[1:39:30] and mysteries without a life that is
[1:39:32] that is a challenge to me because if it
[1:39:35] is mysteries then the most mysterious
[1:39:36] pressure he had to have it
[1:39:38] it's just that Paul already handled that
[1:39:41] by said oh you know all mysteries and
[1:39:42] have all knowledge and don't have
[1:39:44] charity you're still back to square one
[1:39:47] you just like a man we're talking no
[1:39:48] mysteries
[1:39:52] say talking Greek a cocking lactating
[1:39:55] you're talking what kind of thing and
[1:39:56] people had just resumed all they know
[1:39:59] the nutrition and there's a you know as
[1:40:01] a mighty man because he could talk
[1:40:03] mighty and you had doing something was
[1:40:06] what we're getting service
[1:40:08] I was I was blessed you click you see
[1:40:18] what we shot last week you put a pig in
[1:40:21] a cage you put your pig on a legalism
[1:40:23] you lock him up you Pig musty be be be
[1:40:25] quiet he lock up in the cage and here on
[1:40:29] a truck going to the slaughter
[1:40:32] they pick just didn't make any noise
[1:40:34] night but loosen it first mud poorly
[1:40:38] season it he said this is mines this is
[1:40:41] what I'm claiming because he's a pig he
[1:40:43] do have a lamb nature the pig goes back
[1:40:46] to limited because he's bound by
[1:40:48] legalism and that is why some people
[1:40:50] love legalistic preachers because keep
[1:40:53] them in a kid's left turn and they love
[1:40:56] that could Amanda's the control yourself
[1:40:58] to the man that's why people like
[1:40:59] communism they control yourself so they
[1:41:01] want a man to control them you see the
[1:41:07] God's law is internal man's law is
[1:41:12] external
[1:41:12] that's right now jail and prison for
[1:41:15] people can be hit yourself
[1:41:16] lock up arrest throw in jail judge
[1:41:18] thanks for the people that cabbie you
[1:41:19] deserve but really and truly God want
[1:41:22] the law to be internal but you know how
[1:41:24] to behave yourself that's what the cost
[1:41:27] will come to bring about behavior
[1:41:28] because you behavior is what set you to
[1:41:31] adoption it's not just son is the right
[1:41:33] kind of a son so we never much son
[1:41:36] always the right kind it have all kind
[1:41:38] of son Rascals son ropes son Rennie good
[1:41:41] son but God one day right pain that what
[1:41:44] kind of ministers
[1:41:45] men that not call halfway call when I'm
[1:41:49] talking to some of them cut it off but
[1:41:53] they're doing this stuff on a
[1:41:55] hot the fact did
[1:41:58] you reckon Hyundai destroyin Paul in
[1:42:01] Paul is ported calling them enemies of
[1:42:04] the cross but one thing I rejoiced is a
[1:42:07] crisis breached this is the enemy's
[1:42:10] country people the enemies of the cross
[1:42:14] he said but his consolation that Christ
[1:42:16] is preached at least at least something
[1:42:18] about Christ but them as well practice
[1:42:21] dogs and already call them real
[1:42:23] characters but this is the gospel and we
[1:42:25] have the same thing No
[1:42:27] so watch here we go I already so Christ
[1:42:31] the Bible's manifested again like an
[1:42:33] Elise of Christ cause are you ready
[1:42:36] you are a predestinated seed just like
[1:42:39] Christ was you know heard what we said
[1:42:42] before your heart is prepared you're
[1:42:45] built has been pre-planned and now
[1:42:47] you're here that you are a predestinated
[1:42:51] seed just like Christ was and when the
[1:42:55] rain falls under seeded the life
[1:42:58] produces itself when the Holy Spirit
[1:43:01] falls so forget about her in the rain
[1:43:04] coming there is another issue is if you
[1:43:07] have the seed because their life will
[1:43:10] produce itself when the rain falls or
[1:43:13] give the Lord a shout so the most
[1:43:16] important thing is for you to receive
[1:43:18] seed on top of world on top of world
[1:43:22] what seed promises by these promises you
[1:43:27] become a partaker of course divine
[1:43:28] nature by what by promises so for the
[1:43:31] random came that introduced us to
[1:43:32] precious promises I promise you this I
[1:43:35] promise you that I promise you the Holy
[1:43:36] Ghost I promise I promise I promise I
[1:43:38] promise that's what you're receiving you
[1:43:40] under promise your child of the kingdom
[1:43:42] your child a promise just think those
[1:43:45] guys in Egypt okay God made a promise to
[1:43:48] bring them out into our landfill

[1:48:19] that's your promise so when I fell on
[1:48:28] those seeds that he chose when before
[1:48:32] the foundation of the world
[1:48:33] they were predestined I see Peter who
[1:48:36] denied him three times
[1:48:37] we told us he was predestinated I wanted
[1:48:43] to bring it real to you Peter who denied
[1:48:45] I don't know him I don't I don't even
[1:48:47] know simple yeah you ain't Church no no
[1:48:50] no not not me wrong man when he said a
[1:48:54] curse that is not him maybe not here
[1:48:55] because Kristen Lucas then Peter wept I
[1:48:58] am saying to you he was a predestinated
[1:49:02] see this is the part I want to get to
[1:49:05] this emotional seed for going here
[1:49:07] disciples 120 this Harlem says up in the
[1:49:11] upper room these seeds the word and the
[1:49:17] word was laying on dear without life in
[1:49:20] it when there were any upper room they
[1:49:24] were the word without life waiting for
[1:49:30] the Holy Ghost waiting for dynamics
[1:49:34] waiting for the power but they were the
[1:49:37] word because Luke 24 Jesus opening
[1:49:40] understanding to the scripture and open
[1:49:43] the word to them they knew who they were
[1:49:46] or they were predestinated seeds there
[1:49:49] was sons of God original seeds tribute
[1:49:53] thoughts of God let's continue let's
[1:49:57] continue and the world was laying there
[1:49:59] without life in it and all of a sudden
[1:50:02] they came from a song from heaven as the
[1:50:05] waters began to gush down and it
[1:50:08] actually fell all the house where they
[1:50:11] were sitting and the seeds begin to grow
[1:50:13] to begin to manifest itself the Word of
[1:50:17] God be made manifest in other words joy
[1:50:19] to was an effect what did Joe say shall
[1:50:22] come to pass that I poured my spirit
[1:50:25] upon all flesh young men shall see
[1:50:28] visions all men shall dream dreams that
[1:50:31] was a prophecy from joy or glory to God
[1:50:34] Isaiah 28 with stammering lips and other
[1:50:37] tongues that speak to these people
[1:50:39] so Jesus seasoned on with these promises
[1:50:42] so when the Spirit fall it was fallen in
[1:50:45] connection to the prophecy of joy I
[1:50:48] forgive that's right Peter came and said
[1:50:51] this is that that the Prophet Joel
[1:50:54] because before become materialized it
[1:50:57] has to be spoken
[1:50:58] all glory of God and before it is spoken
[1:51:01] it's got to be the pots of God or give
[1:51:05] the Lord a show certain thoughts of God
[1:51:08] drop-down prophesy angel Rafi Sinai sire
[1:51:11] and there goes the Upper Room
[1:51:12] [Applause]
[1:51:16] what about you and I this morning
[1:51:19] halleluyah halleluyah my my my it began
[1:51:24] to manifest itself the would have got
[1:51:26] being manifested you see there's no
[1:51:29] profit you see now why I have been so
[1:51:32] Seles of the kind of seed that I planted
[1:51:36] for the body what what if we saw back on
[1:51:38] now what if we saw confusion what we if
[1:51:42] we show again some other children some
[1:51:43] acid that is in other words we can gain
[1:51:45] stolen dropping on this one that doesn't
[1:51:46] give us adoption Lord revealed to me
[1:51:49] years ago a crashing somebody doesn't
[1:51:52] put you up
[1:51:52] so I beat up this one and beat that one
[1:51:54] that doesn't put you up bless people
[1:51:57] other people oh yes
[1:52:00] inspire people save them it love them
[1:52:03] isn't that right watch you see why I've
[1:52:07] been so zealous of the kind of seed I
[1:52:09] planned for the body the rain is going
[1:52:13] to fall pretty soon no I mean the real
[1:52:16] rain and it's got to have C to fall on
[1:52:20] he's I hope I live to see it well God
[1:52:25] didn't allow him to live to see it but
[1:52:26] we gonna see it when the real rain fall
[1:52:31] on DC's here fallen faith and virtue and
[1:52:34] knowledge on temperance all these laying
[1:52:37] inside of you right now right now a
[1:52:39] pyramid has been built inside of you
[1:52:40] it's the word inside of your pyramid is
[1:52:43] already inside of you or glory to God
[1:52:46] and seed form or glory reen have to fall
[1:52:48] on that green have to fall on that green
[1:52:52] have to fall on that Jesus was God's
[1:52:54] seed and he had to wait for the rain and
[1:52:57] he was going down to John to be baptized
[1:53:00] and when he birthed baptize the dove the
[1:53:04] ring the power the dynamics in the
[1:53:06] fullness come upon Jesus and he become
[1:53:09] the anointed son this is my beloved son
[1:53:12] this is Jesus no carpenter's son as it
[1:53:17] was doing carpentry this is Jesus if he
[1:53:20] is a silence from age 12 to 30 this is
[1:53:22] the same Jesus everybody seen making
[1:53:24] door and making cupboard and make
[1:53:27] whatever it is the Cap'n's oh isn't that
[1:53:29] right with this carpenter walking down
[1:53:32] to the Jordan River
[1:53:33] John baptizing and got jumped was told
[1:53:36] the one who you see the death come down
[1:53:38] and remain so if somebody dove hit and
[1:53:41] fly off you know like anyone because
[1:53:43] maybe somehow they don't get them and
[1:53:45] fire off but this one the dog have to
[1:53:47] remain that's the one so when Jesus came
[1:53:50] even who he was but when he saw that
[1:53:52] does he know that's the Messiah he said
[1:53:55] you should baptize me she said that
[1:53:57] might be so but we have to fulfill all
[1:53:59] righteousness wash this land brother or
[1:54:02] chlorine or club-record Islam is about
[1:54:04] to be crucified
[1:54:05] Oh glory to God and John baptized him
[1:54:08] and Jesus let by the spirit let by the
[1:54:13] spirit into the wilderness to overcome
[1:54:17] the lust of the eyes to overcome the
[1:54:19] lust of the flesh to overcome the pride
[1:54:21] of life to overcome the attacks of the
[1:54:23] devil and all he did was to say this
[1:54:25] written what was he saying that for for
[1:54:27] you for me it is written because it has
[1:54:31] to be spoken for it to be written and
[1:54:33] once it is written that word cannot be
[1:54:36] defeated the world will defeat the devil
[1:54:39] anywhere anytime anyplace under any
[1:54:43] condition that's the word or give the
[1:54:46] Lord a shout Jesus defeated the devil
[1:54:49] not by powerful by the way

[2:03:55] has been answered
[2:03:56] [Applause]
[2:04:00] my god Jesus prophesied praise God when
[2:04:04] Jerusalem is encompassed with armies
[2:04:06] free to the mountain he prophesied that
[2:04:09] to them and what happened praise God
[2:04:12] the Emperor came and surround the
[2:04:13] mountains they couldn't go nowhere but
[2:04:16] the disciples know what Jesus prophesied
[2:04:18] and all of a sudden they seize a day or
[2:04:20] something like that and the Emperor had
[2:04:22] to pull back and when he pull back the
[2:04:24] elected run out because he said when you
[2:04:27] see Jerusalem and compassed with armies
[2:04:28] flee to the mountains or everybody else
[2:04:32] who state and in general come back and
[2:04:34] then blood was shed cheerin was kill
[2:04:36] everything else the prophecies can fail
[2:04:38] God can't lie the world is true put God
[2:04:44] first let's continue so Christ was the
[2:04:52] expression of the word that was rude
[2:04:56] so we talking now beyond the letter now
[2:04:58] we're talking about beyond I'm in a
[2:05:00] message I have books I have tapes we
[2:05:02] talking about beyond I play tapes beyond
[2:05:05] that now you talk about you becoming the
[2:05:07] would manifested you so surrender that
[2:05:10] God could use you we not all my the
[2:05:11] preacher now he's a different thing all
[2:05:13] he had to take this to but you everyone
[2:05:17] become the very word manifested
[2:05:20] oh my hallelujah praise the Lord tonight
[2:05:25] he said we are getting into there's
[2:05:27] reason up amongst the groups counter
[2:05:28] comparison somebody trying to act like
[2:05:30] it
[2:05:30] and live a different life can't drink
[2:05:32] and can smoke a woman can live anybody
[2:05:34] want to still watch television and the
[2:05:36] things of the world and still columns
[2:05:37] and Pentecostals they are trying to
[2:05:39] impersonate gen a genuine it's never
[2:05:42] been revealed to them yet when it's
[2:05:44] revealed is glorious and something takes
[2:05:46] a whole out of you when you walk all the
[2:05:48] way you can't imprison it impersonation
[2:05:50] was dead
[2:05:51] Moses vo he was the Living Word to the
[2:05:54] people and today the people that are
[2:05:57] feel at the same thing they are written
[2:05:58] epistles
[2:05:59] read of all men not a new epistle but
[2:06:04] the Epistle that's been written made
[2:06:08] manifest
[2:06:09] it's doles who believe the word and the
[2:06:12] promise of this day that gourd is point
[2:06:14] of his spirit upon all flesh and that is
[2:06:16] written epistles I when a person tries
[2:06:18] to kindly impersonate that it backfires
[2:06:20] because their life shows what you are so
[2:06:25] what is the word of what is a
[2:06:26] manifestation of a thought it's an
[2:06:27] expression of a thought right before you
[2:06:30] see anything subconsciously you tink it
[2:06:32] before you speak it he taught and he
[2:06:34] spoke a word and the word has made
[2:06:36] manifest and every word in the Bible is
[2:06:38] God towards lead in seed form and that's
[2:06:41] just the law he put it
[2:06:42] that's why Gordon come down as a man
[2:06:44] he's a virgin shall conceive which is
[2:06:46] the seed of the woman isn't that right
[2:06:47] though he's not right he come as a see
[2:06:50] Jesus isn't a right so every word in the
[2:06:52] Bible is God taught Slayton seed form
[2:06:54] and if receive into human being spoke by
[2:06:58] the same taught that materialized the
[2:07:00] Bible it brings it into pass how
[2:07:02] powerful could the church be the Bible
[2:07:04] says let his mind I was in Christ being
[2:07:06] you as a man thinketh in his heart so is
[2:07:08] he
[2:07:08] now you're taught if they become
[2:07:10] expression okay oh he's got nothing to
[2:07:13] you know me like God shall let there be
[2:07:15] a world before it could be a word it had
[2:07:17] to be a thought so God in the creation
[2:07:20] created the world by his thought and
[2:07:23] then spoke it then he expressed it then
[2:07:26] it become material
[2:07:27] oh my and if that same spirit I said let
[2:07:30] there be light and there was light said
[2:07:33] let there be trees and there was trees
[2:07:34] and if that seemed mine that was in
[2:07:37] Christ being you and you say let there
[2:07:40] be no cancer then it would be gone let
[2:07:44] the blind eyes be open then it would be
[2:07:47] so it's you're taught or glory to God so
[2:07:52] what we're looking for now is the main
[2:07:54] of God to drop down that the toughts of
[2:07:57] God could come down however you speak is
[2:07:59] not our word it's God's thought
[2:08:01] expressed which is this word that can
[2:08:03] fail or give the Lord a shout do you see
[2:08:06] it now
[2:08:09] we're not talking about a suggestion
[2:08:11] we're talking about God stinking comment
[2:08:15] dong into your heart when you speak
[2:08:17] you're speaking the thoughts of God
[2:08:18] which is the Word of God
[2:08:20] half feet and God isn't that right now
[2:08:22] you can express it by mental conception
[2:08:24] but if it becomes a real revelation of
[2:08:26] God you see it before it happens and you
[2:08:28] express it in Word form and that word

[2:12:14] redemptive rites
[2:12:16] come on now come on now
[2:12:20] [Applause]
[2:12:21] yeah you know some fathers that half
[2:12:23] fight with his sons and some mothers
[2:12:25] have fight with the daughters and they
[2:12:26] all kind of all kind of petty - all
[2:12:28] right God doesn't have that when when
[2:12:31] God's sons begin to manifest sin he is
[2:12:33] feel proud he's feel good about it
[2:12:35] god I cannot fight you activator just
[2:12:37] like him you talk about Adam was
[2:12:39] supposed to be a God of the earth come
[2:12:41] on G isn't that right he had dominion
[2:12:43] over the earth he could control the
[2:12:46] earth because that is what we were
[2:12:47] pleased here for and Jesus demonstrated
[2:12:49] that power and control when he said
[2:12:51] peace be still when he could take water
[2:12:54] isn't that right until it into wine and
[2:12:55] bypass all the processes he piped all
[2:12:58] the grapes all he personally Orlick
[2:13:00] fermentation if I pass all that act and
[2:13:02] he could convert it into wine because He
[2:13:04] is God he can handle the processes and
[2:13:06] bring it true and he can handle your
[2:13:08] processes and bring your true
[2:13:10] so the prostitute all the filthy woman
[2:13:13] whatever it is he could handle them and
[2:13:14] bring them true and convert them and
[2:13:16] change them into the ladies Oh glory to
[2:13:19] God that's why they could be genuine
[2:13:21] Christians you could think the drunkards
[2:13:23] on the drug addicts and bring them
[2:13:25] straight true there's nothing is too
[2:13:27] hard for the Lord he demonstrated
[2:13:29] because they are all woman like Sarah
[2:13:30] and transformed as a brief word Isaac
[2:13:32] nothing is right for the Lord or glory
[2:13:35] of God
[2:13:35] a little shepherd boy like David he can
[2:13:37] anoint him to be king and they were all

[2:17:07] room they were praising and blessing God
[2:17:09] continually because the Holy Ghost
[2:17:11] Carmel and dry the Holy Ghost come down
[2:17:14] on deadness it has to have an atmosphere
[2:17:15] and the atmosphere of worship and praise
[2:17:18] that is what the Holy Ghost come down
[2:17:20] into isn't that right but abandom you
[2:17:23] believe this to be the Bible God's Word
[2:17:27] okay I'll back up
[2:17:28] this is on as I wasn't Moses I'll be
[2:17:30] with thee just no bill first this is a
[2:17:34] take a look at the 11th of September
[2:17:36] 1960 remember here we go I want you to
[2:17:39] get this you can only be saved by your
[2:17:42] personal feet you can only be healed by
[2:17:48] your personal feet you believe this to
[2:17:51] be the Bible God's Word you believe your
[2:17:54] pastor to be a man of God whatever
[2:17:57] church you go to
[2:17:58] if you don't usually leave it
[2:18:02] that's what the Prophet said don't
[2:18:04] believe the man is a man of God should
[2:18:06] leave it watch get to a man that is a
[2:18:11] man of God then if you believe him
[2:18:14] believe he's telling you the truth then
[2:18:17] accepted your own personal faith and
[2:18:21] Christ saves you no matter how good your
[2:18:23] pastor is how godly saintly your mother
[2:18:26] is how real the Word of God is how much
[2:18:29] you cry how much you pray it's your feet
[2:18:32] that saves you your personal feet and
[2:18:36] that is why I have the commnity you what
[2:18:40] you say what you believe what you act on
[2:18:43] him and your worship now the same thing
[2:18:47] applies no matter God's Word that we
[2:18:50] said in the last days to straight
[2:18:52] summers no I brought natural Israel and
[2:18:54] spiritual Israel together we are looking
[2:18:56] for the Joshua of this name here we go
[2:18:58] which is the Holy Spirit do you get it
[2:19:04] so just run as I mind somewhere I will
[2:19:07] give the judge for the clean name Joshua
[2:19:08] Joshua is the Holy Spirit to lead us to
[2:19:11] the land he has to speak to somebody
[2:19:13] because he's a spirit I've told you what
[2:19:16] he told me no you believe and be healed
[2:19:18] this is beautiful because called what
[2:19:20] God was veiled in brother Branham
[2:19:22] speaking this is I told you he said now
[2:19:25] you believe and be healed did you notice
[2:19:28] that the Moses the great miracle
[2:19:30] performer brought Israel down to the
[2:19:33] land brought him up to the promised land
[2:19:35] but did not place the inheritance to
[2:19:36] them he did not give them inheritance he
[2:19:38] led him up to the land but Joshua
[2:19:40] devises Atlanta the people is that right
[2:19:42] and Christ here we go brought the church
[2:19:45] up to a place where the position was
[2:19:47] made possession was made to them was
[2:19:49] given to them just rolling the cross but
[2:19:51] the Holy Spirit is the one who sets the
[2:19:54] church in order the Joshua of the day
[2:19:57] puts the church in order given to each
[2:19:59] one gifts places position and he's the
[2:20:03] voice of God speaking in the inner man
[2:20:05] that Christ has saved the Holy Spirit
[2:20:08] and then he talked about Joshua and
[2:20:10] Caleb they heard a murmur and the people
[2:20:12] or it can be done
[2:20:13] can be done and Caleb run out in the
[2:20:15] midst of the people and quiet them yes
[2:20:17] it can be just what stood by him
[2:20:19] certainly it can be God given to us amen
[2:20:23] what was it he had the secret behind
[2:20:24] Caleb and Joshua they were positionally
[2:20:28] born in Christ they had a knowledge of
[2:20:32] the word and the word became manifested
[2:20:36] remember every one of those Israelites
[2:20:38] had the would preach to them but it only
[2:20:40] took effect upon Caleb and Joshua to
[2:20:42] realize what it was all about so that is
[2:20:46] the revelation Joshua and Caleb even
[2:20:48] though they were part of the whole bunch
[2:20:49] they were clearly had a position in
[2:20:52] Christ and they had revolution was all
[2:20:54] about and when your aversion was about
[2:20:56] nobody could show you off nobody could
[2:20:58] set you back Oh glory to God because cut
[2:21:01] to you what your inheritance is isn't
[2:21:04] that right so if the emphasis here sets
[2:21:07] us like just four positionally if from
[2:21:10] here manases there and God here
[2:21:13] Benjamin dear so no Minister could place
[2:21:15] the church or place me or place somebody
[2:21:17] I can place you God has to please you as
[2:21:20] his sons and daughters do you believe
[2:21:21] that how God set some in the church
[2:21:24] through their labor pains they kept
[2:21:28] tremendous sometimes when a church here
[2:21:30] we go church are you ready oh don't tell
[2:21:33] me no we are a home stretch I know we
[2:21:36] just call extra time but I'm not notice
[2:21:38] I'm not getting tired right could this
[2:21:40] have our function to bring this thing
[2:21:41] today praise God amen watch when a
[2:21:46] church is groaning under the persecution
[2:21:50] of the outside world and that's gonna
[2:21:51] come push the Christian gonna come and
[2:21:54] you see a whole different thing in this
[2:21:55] message yes believe in our Lord Jesus
[2:21:58] that the promise of the Holy Ghost is
[2:22:01] just as real to us as it was the Penta
[2:22:05] curse how they groan and cry under labor
[2:22:08] pains but when they are born one and
[2:22:12] positionally born to into the kingdom of
[2:22:15] God then the Holy Ghost has set in the
[2:22:18] church some apostles some prophets some
[2:22:22] teachers
[2:22:24] some passes some evangelists there's a
[2:22:27] faithful ministry not before I want to
[2:22:31] say it again this is a wood from the
[2:22:32] Prophet this is dusty at the Lord God
[2:22:35] has two porn and positionally born ten

[2:22:46] somebody says the pastor no no no

[2:22:59] his deacon that man called shawl was
[2:23:02] always to be a prophet of the Gentiles
[2:23:04] no as a natural born man he was a
[2:23:07] Pharisee of the Pharisees killing and
[2:23:09] hunting Christians but in God's thinkin
[2:23:11] he's an apostle to the Gentiles
[2:23:14] now wanted to connect with his behavior

[2:35:58] tabernacle of God made flesh dwell on
[2:36:00] the earth Jesus was the word Saint John
[2:36:03] 1 and the words was invisible now listen
[2:36:06] close the word was invisible until it
[2:36:10] was made flesh and then the will become
[2:36:13] visible and to his sacrificial data
[2:36:15] Calvary on his resurrection positionally
[2:36:18] places Church in that realm that the

[2:37:10] Living Word of God then the bride is
[2:37:12] always part of the bridegroom so the
[2:37:14] bride will not be a denomination it will
[2:37:17] have to be the word manifested to be the
[2:37:19] bride of Christ so all the people trying
[2:37:22] to say this choice have it destroyed
[2:37:23] Duchess all of it nice foolishness it
[2:37:25] will not be a church it has to be the
[2:37:26] word

[2:37:33] unlearn but they were written epistles
[2:37:35] read that they have been with Jesus

[2:38:21] people a sermon let your sermon be lived
[2:38:24] and it's the voice of God not to bring a
[2:38:26] reproach then we reject it they will say

[2:39:07] against the enemy the devil donkey
[2:39:09] outlawed Ujala
[2:39:09] the devil talking much it jump up and
[2:39:11] down what hurts the devil is to see
[2:39:15] sanctified holy life consecrated to God
[2:39:18] see anything to him call him anything
[2:39:20] just as sweet as can be
[2:39:21] we're right on that chose him away
[2:39:23] that's the Tunder that shakes the devil
[2:39:25] some say well if he could preach like
[2:39:27] Billy Graham or about somebody a great
[2:39:29] integral speaker who sometimes the devil
[2:39:32] just laughs at that he don't pay no more
[2:39:34] than she's met and met him you got holy
[2:39:36] theology you want all the seminary
[2:39:39] trained and ever just sit back and
[2:39:40] laughs I mean holy they really laughing
[2:39:43] laughing at geology but when he sees
[2:39:45] that life he can laugh at that because
[2:39:47] you know what I'd like did back there in
[2:39:49] the right look at all these houses back
[2:39:51] there that mean that channel but the
[2:39:53] Epilepsy saying come out of him there
[2:39:55] will come an endeavor and a deficit in
[2:39:56] this and no aren't you making a podium
[2:39:58] of yourself they were talking to them
[2:40:00] now you see what you're doing
[2:40:02] Jesus told you he commissioned you to
[2:40:03] cast me on another one you can do it but
[2:40:06] brother when they seemed come one come
[2:40:08] walking quietly he didn't have to see
[2:40:10] nothing the devil was already scared
[2:40:12] right there
[2:40:13] he knowed he had to leave cause he had
[2:40:17] come a life not a sermon but a life not
[2:40:21] mysteries a life not more revelations a
[2:40:25] life he said come out of him that done
[2:40:27] it quietly he know what he was talking
[2:40:29] about oh praise the name of the Lord
[2:40:32] please God God is not my simplicity and
[2:40:37] a revelation of Jesus Christ in the most
[2:40:40] illiterate person oh please isn't that
[2:40:44] right know what I rock accepted your
[2:40:47] life is gone and he has the preeminence
[2:40:49] and you show the preeminence to the
[2:40:51] people and they see the very life and
[2:40:53] works inside so in other words you see
[2:40:55] it has to come to a manifestation we put
[2:40:57] too much emphasis on the mechanics it
[2:40:59] has to come the dynamics by lack of this
[2:41:01] revelation is why are so many different
[2:41:03] divisions and so much mockery so much
[2:41:05] divisions because the people lack the
[2:41:07] revelation the teachers lack the
[2:41:09] revelation so who can really boost and
[2:41:11] say I have it who can claim money that's
[2:41:14] why I ask years ago which Minister need
[2:41:16] which church which man have the minister
[2:41:18] of Jesus Christ none so all the big
[2:41:22] claims on this fighting and big sword
[2:41:24] fighting and agree and championship
[2:41:25] together
[2:41:26] they're only laughing you know because
[2:41:28] devil s in nothing to make him move yet
[2:41:30] but I'm say when they start me a
[2:41:32] permanent devil didn't tell you know
[2:41:33] them excited is when Peter said silver
[2:41:35] gold have I none
[2:41:36] nothin Peter go attracts you know not
[2:41:39] gonna be a plate tip you know nobody was
[2:41:41] talking when he said silver and gold

[2:41:44] unto you that is money there is no no
[2:41:46] this is Christ who Snowden guys
[2:41:49] this is the wood made flesh all over
[2:41:50] again we have to stop that Oh hallelujah
[2:41:54] praise God how would we know the voice
[2:41:56] of God in the last days he said then it
[2:41:58] was enough vinegar the Prophet today how
[2:42:00] we know is the voice of God because it
[2:42:02] would be a manifestation of the prophets
[2:42:04] word not more quotes but a manifestation
[2:42:07] of the prophets word
[2:42:09] oh my I'm gonna close off right here Oh
[2:42:12] hallelujah
[2:42:14] oh praise be to Jesus blessed be the
[2:42:17] name of the Lord
[2:42:18] thank you lord please let's worship Him
[2:42:20] a little bit okay so when the Holy
[2:42:28] Spirit coming up a room he said what was
[2:42:30] it the pillar of fire which was God
[2:42:32] Himself divided himself music
[2:42:34] accompanies him some among the people
[2:42:36] and Jesus was the whole thing he had the
[2:42:39] spirit without measure we get it my
[2:42:42] measure you see what I mean cause we
[2:42:44] unadopted children
[2:42:45] oh praise the name of the Lord blessed
[2:42:49] be the name of the Lord hallelujah and
[2:42:52] when the headstone comes I've been to
[2:42:54] the pyramid and so perfectly you
[2:42:56] couldn't fit run a razor to it when
[2:42:58] Christ come to receive his church the
[2:43:00] church will have the ministry just
[2:43:02] exactly like that there is the whole
[2:43:05] thing up what's the prophecy the
[2:43:07] prophecy is the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:43:09] must come among the people to take us
[2:43:12] home
[2:43:12] oh praise be to Jesus you love him
[2:43:17] hallelujah father we realize that the
[2:43:21] church has come to the stage of
[2:43:22] justification to the sin of sonification
[2:43:24] come to she'll receive the Holy Spirit
[2:43:26] and now the stones are being honed down
[2:43:29] for the fitting of the Ministry of Jesus
[2:43:31] Christ to blend in to take the church so
[2:43:34] it has to come down now not
[2:43:36] justification only or some indication
[2:43:37] like that only goes but honed to fit so
[2:43:41] he is saying the church has to be cut to
[2:43:43] fit into the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:43:45] that Holy Spirit's thought and we
[2:43:47] believe find a quote for a season we
[2:43:50] believe there's to be a church in these
[2:43:53] last days are you ready

[2:44:09] scattered throughout the world in this
[2:44:12] loud Eastern Church it will be a church
