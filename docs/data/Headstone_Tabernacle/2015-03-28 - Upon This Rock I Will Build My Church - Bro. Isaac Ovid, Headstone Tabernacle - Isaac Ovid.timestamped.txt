[15:22] exceedingly
[15:23] abundantly above all that we could ask
[15:26] or think according to the power
[15:28] that worketh in us amen
[15:32] amen we do have a prayer request
[15:36] for brother jerome from mother pop well
[15:41] amen uh he's down with the virus and i
[15:44] know a few people are suffering um
[15:46] i know the enemy was mad with sunday
[15:48] service
[15:49] and he was mad with wednesday's service
[15:51] in diego martin and he was mad with
[15:53] fizzy service right here this week i
[15:55] myself was battling a
[15:57] bit of a sore throat and i'm kind of
[15:59] suffering a bit with my throat but the
[16:01] devil is a liar
[16:03] i said the devil is picking the wrong
[16:05] fight fighting the wrong people
[16:08] at the wrong time because the church is
[16:11] coming into power
[16:12] you don't mess with the church when the
[16:14] church is coming into power
[16:16] we pray for the sick and the sick is
[16:18] recovering the sick is being healed and
[16:20] the devil doesn't like that he don't
[16:21] want us to pray for the sick
[16:23] he don't want us to cast out devils but
[16:25] that's what the church is supposed to do
[16:27] so i stand my ground tonight and if the
[16:30] devil wants to punch we're going to
[16:32] punch right back
[16:33] but the random taught us when the devil
[16:35] said boo we're gonna say boo right back
[16:38] so i'm depending on god tonight to use
[16:41] my vocal chords
[16:42] to use this body tonight because i have
[16:44] no strength of my own
[16:46] and for everyone that may be sick or
[16:48] down here on the internet
[16:51] god is still a healer he is still the
[16:54] same
[16:54] yesterday today and forever there is no
[16:57] doubt in my mind
[16:58] take that devil we are going victorious
[17:01] we are gonna be victorious so shall we
[17:05] bow our heads

[17:08] heavenly father lord healing is a

[18:56] verse
[18:57] 13.
[19:00] amen matthew
[19:04] 16 and verse 13.
[19:09] when jesus came into the coast of
[19:11] caesarea philadelphia he asked his
[19:13] disciples saying
[19:14] whom do men say that i the son of man am
[19:18] and they said some say that thou art
[19:20] john the baptist
[19:22] some elias and others jeremiah's or one
[19:24] of the prophets
[19:26] you see it unto them but whom say ye
[19:29] that i am and simon peter answered and
[19:32] said thou art the christ
[19:34] the son of the living god and jesus
[19:36] answered and said unto him blessed are
[19:37] thou simon by jonah for flesh
[19:40] and blood had not revealed it unto thee
[19:42] but my father
[19:43] which is in heaven and i say also unto
[19:47] thee that
[19:47] peter and upon this rock i will build my
[19:50] church
[19:51] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[19:53] against it
[19:54] and i will give unto thee the keys of
[19:56] the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[19:58] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[20:00] in heaven and whatsoever
[20:02] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[20:04] loosed in heaven
[20:06] then charge his disciples that they
[20:08] should tell no man
[20:10] that he was jesus the christ and from
[20:13] that time fort began jesus show
[20:15] unto his disciples how that he must go
[20:18] into jerusalem and suffer many things
[20:20] of the elders and chiefs priests and
[20:23] scribes and be killed and be raised
[20:25] again the third day
[20:27] then peter took him and began to rebuke
[20:29] him
[20:30] saying be it far from thee lord this
[20:33] shalt not be
[20:34] unto thee but he turned and said unto
[20:36] peter get thee behind me satan
[20:38] thou art an offense unto me for those
[20:41] savories not the things that be of god
[20:44] but those that be of men then jesus and
[20:48] uh then jesus unto his then said jesus
[20:50] unto
[20:51] his disciples if any man shall come
[20:53] after me let him deny himself
[20:56] and take up his cross and follow me for
[20:59] whosoever shall save his life shall lose
[21:01] it
[21:02] and whosoever shall lose his life for my
[21:05] sake
[21:05] shall find it for what is a man
[21:08] profited if he shall gain the whole
[21:11] world
[21:12] and lose his own soul or what shall a
[21:15] man give in
[21:15] exchange for his soul may the lord have
[21:17] a blessing to the reading of his word
[21:20] shall we pray gracious heavenly father
[21:23] we thank you for your love for your
[21:24] grace for your mercy
[21:26] lord that you extended to us today to be
[21:28] gathered lord once more in your presence
[21:31] lord any man can read the scripture but
[21:32] it takes the holy spirit to breathe
[21:34] life upon it father may you speak to
[21:37] your children here today father may you
[21:39] take me out of the way and bring great
[21:40] deliverance to the captives
[21:42] father god may you bring restoration to
[21:44] your people lord a time of
[21:47] lord god or refreshing for the church oh
[21:49] god as we approach this season of easter
[21:52] follow me you be with us me you anoint
[21:53] my vocal cords may you annoy my body may
[21:56] you
[21:56] take away all the discomfort father and
[21:59] lord may you speak
[22:00] lip the air to your children today in
[22:01] the precious name of jesus christ and
[22:03] the church says
[22:05] amen you may be seated
[22:13] amen so we are gathered in the presence
[22:16] of the lord this evening
[22:17] under great expectation for what god
[22:20] will do this evening
[22:22] and in the message expectations brother
[22:24] branham said what we need is back to the
[22:26] bible back to
[22:28] real holiness back to god back to where
[22:31] people can have faith
[22:33] amen and in the message jesus christ the
[22:35] same yesterday today and forever
[22:37] he said we're living in the end time and
[22:39] i believe it's time for the restoration
[22:41] of the church that was promised that god
[22:43] would send in the last days
[22:47] and i believe this is the day that when
[22:49] the world has been preached so much and
[22:50] the day is getting so dark and so evil
[22:53] till according to god's word he was to
[22:55] restore all that the caterpillar had
[22:57] eaten
[22:58] the palmer worm had eaten will be
[23:00] restored back again
[23:02] but the branham said in the restoration
[23:04] of the brine tree now that's the tree
[23:06] that joel spoke about it cannot die the
[23:08] worms eat it down but it
[23:10] couldn't die because in its root it had
[23:12] the predestinated truth which is
[23:14] god's word can the church say amen
[23:18] joel saw every one of them eat down to
[23:20] the bottom but he said i will
[23:22] restore saith the lord for the
[23:24] predestination of god lays in the roots
[23:26] of the tree
[23:27] it's got to come forth because it's
[23:29] holding the predestinated
[23:31] word of god can the church say amen so
[23:34] what are we seeing this evening there's
[23:35] a predestinated seed inside of your soul
[23:38] you can't even avoid it if you wanted to
[23:41] you couldn't even miss this service if
[23:43] you wanted to
[23:44] because god promised to restore god
[23:46] promised to build
[23:48] god promised to restore his church can
[23:50] the church say amen
[23:52] so i have a title this evening and my
[23:54] title is taken from matthew 16
[23:57] upon this rock i will build my church
[24:01] and my subject who do you say that i am
[24:04] and an inspiration despite the
[24:06] revelation
[24:07] a supernatural element still remains can
[24:10] the church say amen
[24:12] let me say that one more time for my
[24:14] title upon this rock
[24:16] i will build my church and for a subject
[24:19] who do you
[24:20] who do you say that i am and for an
[24:23] inspiration
[24:24] despite the revelation a supernatural
[24:27] element
[24:28] still remains so today we find ourselves
[24:31] focused
[24:32] on matthew 16. and every scripture has
[24:35] its place every scripture is important
[24:37] it's
[24:38] very difficult to place great importance
[24:40] and one scripture and great importance
[24:42] in another scripture because every
[24:43] scripture
[24:44] has its place but as we approached palm
[24:47] sunday and
[24:48] good friday and isa sunday i felt
[24:50] compelled to
[24:51] kind of focus on matthew 16 tonight
[24:54] but before we could really appreciate
[24:56] matthew 16 i want to
[24:58] briefly consider what happened before
[25:00] matthew 16
[25:02] because what happened before matthew 16
[25:04] and what happened after matthew 16 is
[25:07] what
[25:07] makes matthew 16 so important
[25:11] in the book of matthew it's the first
[25:13] book in the new testament it's the first
[25:15] of the four gospels and in matthew
[25:17] chapter one and two it focuses
[25:19] on the birth of the christ in matthew 3
[25:22] we are introduced to john the baptist
[25:24] and we see jesus
[25:26] baptized in matthew 4 jesus is
[25:29] led into the wilderness to be tempted
[25:30] and tested and he overcomes by the word
[25:33] it is written
[25:34] it is written it is written and after
[25:36] jesus overcomes
[25:37] he goes into the temple to identify his
[25:40] ministry
[25:41] the spirit of the lord is upon me for he
[25:43] had anointed me to
[25:44] preach and and bring the good news and
[25:46] to break down the panzer to lose the
[25:49] change he was
[25:49] letting everybody know what his ministry
[25:51] was but they still did not even realize
[25:53] who he was
[25:54] and they asked the question is this not
[25:57] joseph's son he didn't
[25:58] realize who he was isn't that right
[26:01] from matthew 5 6 and 7 jesus is just
[26:04] preaching he's just teaching he's he's a
[26:07] good teacher he's
[26:08] he's bringing things to the people that
[26:10] they could hold on to he's
[26:11] bringing hope and possibility and a
[26:13] renewal they have
[26:14] never heard good news like this news
[26:16] before
[26:18] for years the children of israel had
[26:19] went from one conqueror to the next from
[26:21] the greeks of the persians
[26:23] to the persians to the syrians at this
[26:25] one and they were finally on the
[26:26] oppression of the romans
[26:28] and here was somebody who was bringing
[26:30] good news to them and they were happy
[26:32] because jesus was in town
[26:38] we are building to something in matthew
[26:41] 8
[26:42] jesus heals a leper and a centurion
[26:45] walks up to jesus and
[26:47] and says listen just speak the word and
[26:48] my servant will be healed
[26:51] in matthew 8 jesus calms the storm and
[26:54] he casts demons into swine and
[26:56] people start to get upset with jesus
[26:58] because it's all right to say good
[27:00] things but
[27:00] when you begin to change how we do
[27:02] things and how we are used to doing it
[27:04] then it
[27:05] becomes a a disruptive force
[27:10] in matthew chapter 9 we find jesus
[27:12] preaching
[27:14] normal service but four believers open
[27:16] up the roof
[27:17] while jesus is preaching jesus is
[27:20] getting along to a good point and four
[27:22] believers decide to
[27:23] climb up the side of the church
[27:27] open up the roof and drop their friend
[27:29] inside because there was no room to get
[27:31] into this
[27:34] and jesus confronted with this situation
[27:37] says
[27:37] thy sin be forgiven these and and the
[27:39] scribes and the pharisees and the
[27:41] critics and everybody else who is around
[27:42] they're like
[27:43] how could you forgive sin and he says
[27:45] which is easier to forgive sins or heal
[27:47] this
[27:48] man and he tells a man to pick up your
[27:49] bed and walk
[27:51] can the church say amen we're building
[27:55] to something
[27:57] in matthew 9 that same chapter there
[28:00] comes a woman to jesus
[28:02] with an issue of blood spent all that
[28:06] she had
[28:07] went to every doctor went to every
[28:09] specialist went to
[28:10] every advisor and could find no solution
[28:13] to the problem that she faced and
[28:15] something taller if i could just get to
[28:18] jesus
[28:19] if i could just get to jesus
[28:23] and maybe there's somebody here tonight
[28:24] with that same prayer on the inside
[28:26] because
[28:27] you didn't come to hear me preach
[28:28] tonight you came to just get to jesus
[28:32] the situation that you came in here with
[28:34] you have carried for a long time like
[28:36] that woman
[28:37] she was bleeding for so long that she
[28:39] felt weak she felt tired she had no more
[28:42] money she had no more strength but she
[28:44] said to herself
[28:45] if i could just get to jesus i don't
[28:48] know really who he is whatever just get
[28:50] to
[28:50] jesus i'm not sure what he is saying but
[28:53] if i could just get to
[28:54] jesus i don't have all the answers but
[28:58] if i could just get to
[28:59] jesus if i could just touch the hem of
[29:02] his garment
[29:03] i'll be made whole you may be seated
[29:09] and she had to press away she had to
[29:11] fight away she had to because there were
[29:13] people around jesus and
[29:14] and at this time up to this moment it is
[29:16] so important because jesus still
[29:18] has not told anybody who he was
[29:22] understand this israel had always been
[29:24] used to prophets
[29:28] it was not to use the word common but
[29:30] they were used to having prophets
[29:33] so it was easy for them to say this
[29:34] jesus is just like another prophet
[29:38] but this woman she began to press away
[29:41] and as she
[29:42] touched the hem of his garment jesus
[29:44] asked the question
[29:45] who touched
[29:48] the disciples around jesus at this point
[29:51] in time they had been with jesus for
[29:52] some time so
[29:53] they kind of know oh jesus they say but
[29:56] jesus how could you ask who touch you
[29:58] when everybody's around he said this is
[29:59] different this person made a withdrawal
[30:03] from the heavenly bank account i felt
[30:05] virtue left me i felt
[30:07] power left me i felt grace left me i
[30:10] felt
[30:10] healing rain left me she signed
[30:13] a check there are blank checks hanging
[30:16] over and
[30:17] somebody gonna put their request on the
[30:18] check
[30:20] and she put a request on the check
[30:24] can the church say amen
[30:31] that's matthew 9. in matthew 10 jesus
[30:34] begins to focus a bit more
[30:36] on his disciples and focuses on
[30:39] instruction and
[30:40] training for these 12 men because
[30:43] there's a responsibility ahead there's a
[30:45] work ahead it's a challenge ahead
[30:47] and unless there is training you cannot
[30:49] confront what lies ahead
[30:52] it is impossible to deal with the
[30:54] challenges of anything
[30:55] unless you are trained and prepared for
[30:57] it you cannot say i want to be a
[30:59] firefighter and when there's a fire you
[31:01] just run inside the fire
[31:02] there is there has to be training so you
[31:04] know the right approach
[31:05] where to put your foot what signs to
[31:07] look for
[31:08] so that you could do the job and so too
[31:10] jesus had to invest
[31:12] time and effort and energy to explain to
[31:15] his disciples
[31:16] what they were about we still haven't
[31:19] reached
[31:20] matthew 16 yet in matthew 11
[31:25] john the baptist is locked in prison and
[31:27] sends his disciples to
[31:29] ask jesus a question a very important
[31:32] question a question john has been
[31:34] wondering about for some time now when
[31:36] he says he said we say go ask
[31:38] that teacher that preacher that man over
[31:39] there who's doing all go
[31:41] ask him are you the one or should we
[31:44] look for another
[31:46] one and jesus still
[31:50] doesn't answer the question he said tell
[31:52] john
[31:54] tell john tell john the sick of being
[31:57] healed
[31:58] tell john the blind is seen tell john
[32:01] the lame is walking
[32:02] tell john the dead is coming alive tell
[32:05] john there's a revival among the people
[32:08] of god
[32:09] tell john there's a liberty in the house
[32:11] of god
[32:12] tell tonder young people are on fire
[32:15] tell
[32:15] john the sinner is coming back to court
[32:18] tell john
[32:19] those who haven't been in church for a
[32:21] long time
[32:22] finding new joy new peace new victory
[32:25] new satisfaction
[32:26] tell john you may be seated
[32:30] in other words jesus was saying john's
[32:32] supposed to know what that means
[32:34] i'm not ready to tell anybody who i am
[32:36] just yet
[32:37] but tell john because my works are
[32:40] supposed to speak of me
[32:41] the things that i do are supposed to
[32:43] speak of me
[32:44] and the same works that i do you are
[32:47] going to do also
[32:48] i don't hear you deceiving them i don't
[32:50] hear you this evening that's only 40
[32:52] percent
[32:53] but tell john
[32:57] can the church say amen you may be
[33:00] seated
[33:04] are you the one or should we look for
[33:06] another
[33:08] john had trained his people that we
[33:10] ought to be looking for somebody
[33:11] that there's somebody who's gonna come
[33:14] and the captives are gonna go
[33:15] free when this man comes the sick will
[33:18] not stay
[33:19] sick when this man come the sinner no
[33:22] matter what condition
[33:23] there was one woman who was so black on
[33:26] earth
[33:27] in her condition with how much men she
[33:28] was living with but when she met jesus
[33:31] jesus took and he raised up and erased
[33:34] her past
[33:35] erased what the world set up out of
[33:37] erase
[33:38] it didn't matter what the history book
[33:41] said about him
[33:42] when jesus takes the eraser of the blood
[33:45] up
[33:45] and he puts it on you what you did
[33:48] yesterday
[33:48] what you did five years ago i don't care
[33:51] how bad it was
[33:52] he is still the same of yesterday today
[33:56] and forever
[34:00] hallelujah you may be seated what are
[34:03] you preaching about preacher i'm
[34:04] preaching about jesus
[34:06] that's what this is about it's always
[34:08] about jesus
[34:10] if you can't preach about jesus we can't
[34:12] have church
[34:13] what kind of church is this this is the
[34:14] jesus church
[34:16] can the church help me because he's the
[34:19] same yesterday
[34:20] he's the same today he's the same
[34:22] forever
[34:24] hallelujah you may be seated the deep
[34:28] question today is do you know him
[34:30] do you know this jesus i know you heard
[34:33] about him
[34:34] i know you heard messages about him but
[34:37] do you know
[34:37] jesus have you shook his hand have you
[34:40] touched his clothes
[34:42] have you ate with him have you
[34:44] fellowship with him
[34:45] well today god wants a personal
[34:48] relationship with you
[34:49] can the church say man
[34:55] hallelujah
[35:00] hallelujah i'm starting to feel better
[35:03] i told my wife at home i said when the
[35:05] anointing touches me i'll be all right
[35:07] she said you want to take this
[35:08] medication i say nah i'll take this one
[35:10] i'll take that one
[35:11] i'll say but when the anointing gets
[35:13] ahold of me just let me get to church
[35:15] i'll be all right just
[35:16] let me get in the present i'll be all
[35:18] right i took all kinds of stuff this
[35:20] morning but
[35:20] just let me get into the presence of the
[35:23] shekinah glory
[35:24] then all the bad feeling got a cold all
[35:27] the sword showed that to go
[35:28] because he is still jesus christ the
[35:31] same yesterday
[35:32] the same today the same forever can the
[35:35] church say amen
[35:38] hallelujah glory to god you could be
[35:41] healed
[35:42] today you could be healed today you
[35:44] could be delivered
[35:45] today you could be set free i don't care
[35:48] this is the first time
[35:49] you were in church in 10 years today is
[35:51] your day
[35:52] to get a revival to get your personal
[35:54] experience
[35:55] all hell is against you all hell try to
[35:58] stop you
[35:59] the devil try to stop you from being
[36:01] here today but too late devil
[36:03] too late you made it to the upper room
[36:06] you made it to the presence of god
[36:08] you made it to the shekinah glory and he
[36:11] who started to work in you is more than
[36:14] able
[36:14] to finish it up he is a finisher he is
[36:17] the author
[36:18] he is the finisher he is our he is
[36:21] omega
[36:21] he is the beginning he is the ender he
[36:24] is the person he is the last son
[36:26] he is jehovah tyrell he is jehovah's
[36:28] psalm
[36:35] hallelujah hallelujah
[36:38] glory to god somebody give praise to god
[36:42] he inhabits the praises of his people
[36:44] maybe you don't understand
[36:45] why we make so much noise but when you
[36:48] come into contact with god
[36:49] you can't help but make noise you can't
[36:52] help but worship
[36:53] because he did it for me i didn't do it
[36:55] for myself
[36:57] i couldn't save myself he saved me
[37:00] he picked me out of the mary clay
[37:06] what do you think about jesus he's all
[37:09] right
[37:10] what you think about jesus
[37:14] oh don't tell me that my lord is dead he
[37:17] woke me up this morning
[37:19] don't tell me hallelujah
[37:22] hallelujah oh i feel good
[37:26] i feel religious i feel like this your
[37:29] old time kind of church
[37:34] hallelujah you may be seated
[37:37] i got so much toffee i don't know where
[37:39] to go but somebody's already pulling
[37:41] because it's it really came upon me how
[37:44] many people sit in the message
[37:46] they know the message but they don't
[37:47] know jesus
[37:50] that's the whole problem they know the
[37:52] message but they don't know jesus
[37:54] the message is about jesus that's why
[37:57] brother branham could say you don't need
[37:59] to know the mechanics but just know the
[38:01] dynamics
[38:02] brother said he is the dynamics he said
[38:04] point to jesus
[38:08] it's all about jesus it's not about me
[38:11] it's not about you it's about him it's
[38:14] about him
[38:15] it's about him it's about him it's about
[38:18] him
[38:19] it's not your sadness it's about him
[38:21] it's not your frustration it's about him
[38:23] it's not how you feel it's about him
[38:30] hallelujah you may be seeing it
[38:35] you don't pull me off my notes already
[38:39] hallelujah
[38:42] we're trying to get to matthew 16. we
[38:45] just reached matthew 12 now
[38:50] in matthew 12 the scribes and the
[38:52] pharisees
[38:54] decide to pick a fight with jesus
[39:00] so it should be no surprise
[39:03] when you start to stand firmly in the
[39:05] wood
[39:07] when people start to say well why are
[39:08] you doing so and why are you doing this
[39:09] and you know it's a paradox
[39:11] the scribes and the fairies weren't
[39:13] worldly people no they were the
[39:14] religious people
[39:15] the people who had the scriptures and
[39:18] they had the books
[39:19] and they have the tapes and they have
[39:21] the records but they decide to pick a
[39:23] fight with jesus
[39:26] matthew 12. in matthew 13 jesus begins
[39:29] to speak about the kingdom of heaven
[39:32] and he gives a number of parables he
[39:34] speaks of the parable of the sower
[39:37] goes forth to sow and he talks about
[39:39] that entire parable he speaks about a
[39:40] treasure buried in the field the pearl
[39:42] of
[39:43] great prices picks up the net thrown out
[39:45] into the sea that pulls all kinds of
[39:47] different people
[39:50] jesus is trying to bring such clarity to
[39:53] the minds of the people
[39:55] that they understand the message that he
[39:58] is bringing to them
[40:01] moves on to matthew 14 where john the
[40:03] baptist is killed and
[40:05] jesus continues to heal in that chapter
[40:08] jesus walks in the water
[40:10] peter also walks underwater
[40:14] this man called peter this morning i
[40:17] told my wife i said peter was really a
[40:19] character
[40:20] peter was we're going to talk a bit
[40:22] about peter but peter was special
[40:25] then in matthew 15 we find a woman says
[40:28] to jesus
[40:29] jesus my daughter is that with the devil
[40:33] she has problems with the devil and
[40:34] jesus says well it's not fit
[40:37] to take the children's bread and
[40:40] cast it to dogs
[40:44] and she quickly put that statement on
[40:50] facebook
[40:54] hashtag what jesus said
[41:00] but it takes a special understanding of
[41:03] jesus for you to see through his eyes
[41:05] and
[41:06] for that brief moment when she heard
[41:08] that statement she saw something
[41:10] few people would see and she said the
[41:12] right thing
[41:14] because she understood that jesus was
[41:17] testing
[41:19] so when jesus said it's not fit to take
[41:21] the children's bread and cast it to dogs
[41:23] she said but
[41:24] even the dogs get
[41:28] some kind of crumbs from off the masters
[41:31] table
[41:32] isn't there a crumb for me
[41:37] jesus didn't even say your daughter is
[41:39] healed he said quote woman coke
[41:42] woman call that away you're good you're
[41:45] good you're good
[41:46] because she said the right thing
[41:49] god give us some christians who could
[41:52] say
[41:53] the right thing
[42:01] you may be seated now we come to our
[42:05] text this evening
[42:06] do you have time this evening because
[42:08] i'm i'm healing them
[42:09] we can go for five hours today this is
[42:12] this is getting good it's like ice cream
[42:13] we totally peel on it
[42:15] coming in nice right now can the church
[42:18] say amen
[42:20] so we come to our text matthew 16 our
[42:24] area of focus we will spend the rest of
[42:26] the service
[42:27] stuck in this chapter this
[42:31] scripture represents a turning point
[42:34] in jesus's ministry
[42:38] for some reason jesus decides to take
[42:41] his disciples to file a pie which is not
[42:43] even part of
[42:44] the israel or judea or whatever name you
[42:46] want to call this is gentile territory
[42:48] in other words he takes them aside away
[42:50] from prying eyes away from everybody
[42:51] else
[42:52] he breaks the routine he breaks the
[42:54] tradition he does something different
[42:57] like have a saturday 5 pm see obviously
[42:59] there's something a little out of the
[43:00] ordinary
[43:01] a little a little out of the ordinary
[43:06] oh yeah in that very chapter it started
[43:08] with him having an argument with the
[43:10] pharisees because the pharisees are
[43:11] saying
[43:12] this jesus healing with power from the
[43:14] devil and
[43:16] and in that scene matthew 16 jesus
[43:18] reminds his disciples of how he
[43:20] fed the five thousand and then he comes
[43:23] down to the meat of the taxidermy
[43:25] he asks a very important question
[43:29] who do men say that i am
[43:33] amen and this is a question almost like
[43:36] an icebreaker if they could use it it's
[43:37] really a conversation started because
[43:39] this is not
[43:40] really the question he wants to get to
[43:42] he is starting a conversation to get a
[43:44] specific point so he said who do
[43:46] men say that i am and the bible says
[43:49] that some say you are
[43:50] john the baptist some elias some
[43:54] jeremiah so one of the prophets
[43:59] and it's easy for us to talk
[44:02] about what men say about him
[44:06] and many people in the church could only
[44:10] say
[44:11] what men said about him many young
[44:14] people could only say what the preacher
[44:17] said about him what their parents said
[44:19] about him because quite frankly they
[44:21] don't know
[44:22] him so jesus brought the question
[44:25] and it's so deep in and of itself
[44:27] because
[44:28] by this time jesus had already been
[44:30] rejected by the people
[44:32] people loved him but he didn't worship
[44:34] him they didn't know who he was he never
[44:35] made clear who he was and
[44:37] when he asked who do men say i am his
[44:40] disciples
[44:40] picked the very best answers they could
[44:42] come up with
[44:44] at least they knew he wasn't bad so they
[44:46] picked good names
[44:47] john the baptist he liars jerry myers
[44:50] you have to be
[44:51] uh one of the prophets
[44:56] and then he asked the question we really
[44:58] want to come to today
[45:00] who do you say that i am and if you read
[45:03] this original not in the english but in
[45:05] original greek this who do you say
[45:08] it's not just you as in you that you had
[45:10] a certain inflection on the word
[45:12] that went like who do you who are with
[45:16] me
[45:18] who do you who have been with me since
[45:20] matthew
[45:22] 4 5 6 7 8 who do you who have seen what
[45:25] i've done
[45:27] who do you who have heard me preach who
[45:29] do you
[45:30] who have seen all these signs wonders
[45:33] say that i am
[45:38] but this question was not just a
[45:39] question because
[45:41] jesus was at a crossroad in his ministry
[45:44] jesus could not go on until this
[45:48] issue was dealt with so jesus called a
[45:51] halt in matthew 16 to his ministry
[45:54] to confront his disciples he could not
[45:58] go on until he revealed certain things
[46:00] to his disciples but before he could
[46:03] reveal it
[46:04] to his disciples they had to really
[46:06] understand who he was
[46:10] and that's how so many of us find
[46:12] ourselves on our christian journey
[46:14] we don't even realize that before we can
[46:16] even go forward
[46:17] we have to come to our face off
[46:20] with who he really is who
[46:24] you really are who the enemy really is
[46:28] jesus knew that matthew 24 was coming
[46:31] jesus knew
[46:32] that breathing upon them as he received
[46:34] you the holy ghost was coming but you
[46:36] can't reach
[46:36] matthew 24 until you get through matthew
[46:39] 16.
[46:41] you can address the power coming into
[46:43] the church unless you deal
[46:45] with matthew 16. you cannot have a
[46:48] manifestation of the sons of god until
[46:51] you deal with matthew 16. can the church
[46:54] say amen
[46:56] amen and peter says thou are the christ
[47:02] the son of the living god amen and jesus
[47:05] answered and said unto him blessed are
[47:07] those
[47:07] simon barjona for flesh and blood hath
[47:10] not revealed it
[47:11] unto thee but my father which is in
[47:15] heaven
[47:16] peter was convinced that that was the
[47:19] messiah
[47:20] it didn't make a difference what anybody
[47:22] else says it didn't make a difference
[47:24] with the priesthood
[47:25] he had a revelation from god and if you
[47:29] ever get a revelation from god
[47:31] it separates you from everybody else
[47:33] because god has spoken to you
[47:35] and if you have a revelation it doesn't
[47:37] matter who does
[47:38] what you heard from god can the church
[47:42] say amen
[47:47] brother branham and speaking about
[47:48] revelation he says the church is built
[47:50] on spiritual revelation
[47:52] we know that right and he made a type
[47:55] with the first display of breaking out a
[47:57] revelation with cain and abel
[47:59] and in question and answers he said cain
[48:01] was a believer
[48:02] think about it keane was a believer he
[48:05] went to god he built an
[48:07] altar he done every religious thing that
[48:09] abel done
[48:10] but he didn't have the spiritual
[48:12] revelation of the will of god
[48:14] amen he didn't have the spiritual
[48:17] revelation and that's the matter with
[48:19] the church today
[48:20] and jesus said he will build his church
[48:23] on that spiritual
[48:25] revelation
[48:28] hallelujah the church say amen
[48:31] cain come he built an altar he worship
[48:33] he brought sacrifice he knelt down
[48:35] he praised god he worshipped god he done
[48:37] everything religious
[48:38] like abel and god refused him because he
[48:42] didn't have
[48:43] a spiritual revelation friend
[48:46] somebody could invite you to church you
[48:48] could be in church for 10 years and not
[48:50] have a revelation
[48:51] amen there are people in church for 20
[48:54] years and they don't have a revelation
[48:56] god has not
[48:57] spoken to them just like the disciples
[49:01] before matthew
[49:02] 16 they were just following without
[49:04] revelation
[49:06] because from matthew to 16 nobody had a
[49:09] revelation
[49:11] can the church say amen
[49:14] but abandonment said follow the same
[49:16] line of cane right down
[49:17] to the ark from the ark right up to
[49:20] israel
[49:20] from israel right on into jesus and from
[49:23] jesus right on till this day
[49:25] and see if that carnal fundamental
[49:28] church
[49:29] stiff and starch scholarly i mean men
[49:31] who have the scriptures
[49:33] who know all the doctrine and the
[49:35] theologies they could explain it like
[49:37] that by the random said but without
[49:39] spiritual revelation he said that's the
[49:42] doctrine of cain can the church say amen
[49:44] but in christ is the mystery of god with
[49:46] you but but the bible said god is known
[49:48] by
[49:48] simplicity and of revelation of jesus
[49:52] christ to the most illiterate person
[49:55] in other words you don't need to be a
[49:57] theologian to understand jesus to the
[49:59] most illiterate person
[50:01] god could reveal himself to you not your
[50:04] theology is the revelation
[50:06] of jesus christ and upon this rock i'll
[50:09] build my church
[50:10] can the church say amen no other rocks
[50:14] accepted no other things accepted no
[50:17] other roman rock
[50:18] no other protestant rock no other school
[50:20] no other nothing
[50:21] but on exactly the revelation of jesus
[50:24] christ
[50:25] through the new boot he born in there
[50:27] and he
[50:28] injects his own life is there anybody
[50:30] want that new pert and an injection
[50:32] of his own life and your life is gone
[50:35] it's no more no more your life but it's
[50:38] his life somebody say man
[50:41] and the life of christ is projecting
[50:44] itself
[50:44] through you with the preeminences to the
[50:47] people
[50:48] that they see the very life and the
[50:50] works and signs and wonders that he did
[50:52] and is doing the same thing through you
[50:55] outside of that the rest of it is not
[50:57] even
[50:57] called it and it's a lack of this
[51:00] revelation is why we have so
[51:02] many divisions
[51:06] can the church say amen so friends
[51:08] there's no school there's no theologian
[51:10] there's no teaching
[51:11] of the bible that can give you
[51:13] revelation
[51:14] revelation is between you and god it's a
[51:17] personal
[51:17] individual affair with the person of
[51:21] christ that's revealed to you and
[51:23] revelation is sovereign god only to ask
[51:25] permission
[51:26] to give you a revelation god can speak
[51:28] to you right now and give you a
[51:30] revelation
[51:31] that you are a child of the king and you
[51:33] are born for a purpose
[51:34] and your past is over can the church see
[51:37] amen and
[51:38] you are going to get the holy ghost and
[51:39] you are going to get adopted and you're
[51:41] going to be perfected
[51:42] and you're going to have a living faith
[51:44] a living virtue a living knowledge a
[51:46] living temperance
[51:47] god delivered a revelation today that
[51:48] your child no matter what he's doing
[51:51] can be delivered can be delivered your
[51:54] husband your wife whatever it is
[51:56] he is still god tonight
[52:06] and jesus said to peter that thou art
[52:09] peter and upon this rock i will build my
[52:11] church
[52:12] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[52:16] against it matthew 16 is so important
[52:19] because in the four gospels matthew mark
[52:21] luke and john
[52:22] jesus only uses the word church
[52:25] in two chapters he doesn't use the word
[52:28] church
[52:29] in mark he doesn't use the word church
[52:31] and luke he doesn't use the word church
[52:33] in john he only uses the word church in
[52:35] the book of matthew
[52:37] and in chapter 16 and then chapter 18.
[52:40] so this passage of text is the first
[52:43] time that jesus
[52:44] introduces the word church he said upon
[52:47] this rock i will build my church
[52:50] he's not talking about a physical church
[52:51] he's not talking about this church and
[52:53] that church and this group and that
[52:55] group he's from his church
[52:57] where he is the head of the church and
[52:59] by one spirit we are baptized into the
[53:01] party
[53:02] you see upon this revelation i will kill
[53:05] my church
[53:09] and the case of hell
[53:12] will not prevail against it
[53:15] can the church say amen god always
[53:18] wanted to build this church because the
[53:20] devil came and destroyed
[53:21] god's first church god had a church
[53:25] in the garden of eden adam and eve was a
[53:27] church
[53:31] and the devil came and break down that
[53:32] church
[53:34] and jesus came to build his church
[53:38] but to build anything you have to have a
[53:39] foundation
[53:41] and jesus said the foundation of this
[53:43] church is spiritual revelation
[53:46] the revelation of jesus christ
[53:48] revelation in the church
[53:49] that he's the same yesterday today and
[53:51] forever
[53:54] in the message ephesian church is
[53:56] whether branham said
[53:58] we want to be right oh my it's a serious
[54:01] thing brother
[54:02] we have got to get this thing right
[54:04] we'll never be able to have a church
[54:07] until god gets a foundation to lay it on
[54:10] he will never build his church upon a
[54:12] bunch of nonsense
[54:17] he has to come on his word or he won't
[54:20] come at all
[54:21] right on his word is that why we have to
[54:23] fight for a clean church
[54:25] a holy church a sanctified church a
[54:27] church in order
[54:28] on god's word not on our idea or
[54:31] interpretation of how it should be
[54:35] somebody's saying man sometime i asked a
[54:38] question the prophet would stand in the
[54:40] pulpit
[54:40] and some of us act the way we act what
[54:42] would he say
[54:44] because they hated the prophet when he
[54:46] was blasting all the
[54:48] bull heads and the styles and the
[54:49] fashions they hated it
[54:52] everybody loves the times and the
[54:53] wonders but they don't like to be
[54:55] straightened up
[54:56] but he has to come on his word and the
[54:59] word itself is a revelation
[55:01] can the church say amen
[55:04] hallelujah but the brandon said i know
[55:07] you think i'm crazy but if i am let me
[55:09] alone
[55:10] i'm happy this way i feel better this
[55:12] way than i did the other way when i had
[55:14] my right mind
[55:17] i don't think you heard me but he ran
[55:20] him in a wedding scepter
[55:21] in in the messenger wedding supper he
[55:23] said the holy ghost that was in christ
[55:24] comes into the believer
[55:26] that's got an invitation to the supper
[55:28] and he's counted her son because he
[55:30] becomes a part of the father
[55:32] he says i know you think i'm crazy but
[55:35] if i am let me alone
[55:36] i'm happy this way i feel better this
[55:39] way than i did the other way when i had
[55:41] my right mind
[55:42] oh it's wonderful it's joy unspeakable
[55:46] and full of glory i tell you if you are
[55:48] a christian
[55:49] and you don't have joy there's something
[55:51] wrong with your testimony
[55:57] if you tell me you're a christian and
[55:58] you can't smile there's something wrong
[56:00] with your testimony
[56:02] because no matter how bad things get you
[56:04] could just pull a scripture
[56:06] all things work together for good
[56:08] weeping may endure for night
[56:10] you have so many scriptures so many
[56:14] quotes so many you wanna why you gotta
[56:16] walk around depressed
[56:18] frustrate him i don't know what's going
[56:20] on the devil trying to get you the devil
[56:22] is supposed to try to get you
[56:24] that's why the bible says put on the
[56:26] full armor of god
[56:28] so you could withstand this is not a
[56:30] game this is warf here
[56:32] can the church see man
[56:36] there's a time for war there's a time
[56:38] for peace well it's war right now and if
[56:40] the devil wants war we will give him war
[56:42] i'm not going to back down i'm not going
[56:44] to give up
[56:45] i'm not going to backslide
[56:48] can the church say man you may be
[56:51] cheating
[56:52] if i have to drag myself into the house
[56:55] of god i'll drag myself
[56:59] but i'm going to praise him i'm going to
[57:01] love him
[57:02] i'm going to save him i said in the
[57:05] service on wednesday
[57:06] people aren't convinced that this is
[57:08] real you know
[57:12] people are not persuaded judgment is
[57:14] coming they've gotten so used to the way
[57:16] the world is that people don't really
[57:18] believe that this world is coming to an
[57:20] end
[57:22] the devil has brought so much stuff to
[57:25] keep you so occupied to keep you away
[57:27] from the word
[57:29] that's why it's so important that's
[57:31] where the bible says as the day
[57:32] approaches gather yourselves
[57:34] together more often because the devil
[57:37] will accelerate your distractions
[57:41] god said for the true bride they would
[57:43] not be just be suddenly worshippers
[57:45] alone they love to worship
[57:46] they love to hear the word so if you
[57:48] call a monday service they're going to
[57:49] be there you call a tuesday service they
[57:51] want to be there they wonder when
[57:53] in service but but i don't have time for
[57:55] my family i'd have time for this
[57:57] i want to go and do this yes you want to
[57:59] do that and then when you have to
[58:01] account for your life you'll say well i
[58:02] already took time to study
[58:08] and that'll be your reason for why
[58:10] you're busy rapture
[58:13] when you are standing on sinking sand
[58:16] and there's only one rock of safety
[58:19] only one rock of safety we have to put
[58:22] the priorities right
[58:24] because god wants to build a church and
[58:26] god's gonna have a church
[58:27] whether it's two or three or five or ten
[58:30] people he will have a church
[58:32] and this building i'm not talking about
[58:33] this building i'm not talking about this
[58:35] physical church
[58:36] god will have a church it'll be his
[58:38] church
[58:39] he will be head of that church can the
[58:42] church say amen
[58:43] i want to be in that church
[58:46] do you want to be in that church
[58:57] just after brother branham said oh it's
[58:58] wonderful joy unspeakable and full of
[59:00] glory
[59:01] but i said when that robe comes in there
[59:04] there's a little hidden power
[59:05] that comes down in your heart that all
[59:08] devils in hell
[59:09] can't make you doubt it could you
[59:11] imagine when there's a power inside your
[59:13] soul
[59:14] that the no devil could make you tout it
[59:16] that hidden power
[59:18] but if adam said not a great big
[59:20] something across your forehead
[59:22] and a doctor of divinity it's a hidden
[59:24] power
[59:25] it's on the inside he said it's been
[59:27] god's program
[59:29] since the first lamb was slain outside
[59:31] of eden
[59:32] he said samson had it he had a hidden
[59:34] power
[59:35] what was it a touch of the holy ghost he
[59:37] said people say
[59:38] samson was big he said listen that would
[59:41] be no
[59:42] mystery to me to see a man with
[59:44] shoulders like bandos to slay a lion
[59:47] or take up a gate and walk away with it
[59:49] but samson was just a little pity mama's
[59:52] boy
[59:53] a little curly headed shrimp about like
[59:55] that now that's what fooled the people
[59:58] can the church say man he was just an
[1:00:01] ordinary boy
[1:00:02] had seven little curls hanging down his
[1:00:04] back looked like a little sisi
[1:00:08] you can't make this stuff up this is the
[1:00:09] prophet that's right everybody will
[1:00:11] laugh at him
[1:00:12] a type of the holy ghost church and he
[1:00:15] was a weakling
[1:00:16] but when the hour come that god wanted
[1:00:18] to use him
[1:00:19] he was a giant brother
[1:00:22] but the branham said that's what fooled
[1:00:24] them
[1:00:25] and god's gonna use you to fool the
[1:00:27] devil to fool the critics
[1:00:29] he said
[1:00:40] you may be seated god wants a church
[1:00:43] that he can lay his hands on and okay
[1:00:45] how little it is
[1:00:46] two or three gathered in my name i'll be
[1:00:49] there in the midst
[1:00:50] god is gonna have somebody god's gonna
[1:00:53] have
[1:00:53] somebody who will stay focused on making
[1:00:56] this thing live can the church say man
[1:00:59] do i have a witness today is there
[1:01:01] somebody here today
[1:01:03] who want to see this live whether i
[1:01:05] maintain my family let me maintain
[1:01:07] christ
[1:01:08] whether all the world turns against me
[1:01:10] let me maintain christ
[1:01:11] whether i lose my job let me maintain
[1:01:14] christ
[1:01:14] because heaven and earth will pass away
[1:01:16] but this world will never
[1:01:18] never never pass away
[1:01:29] let me tell you something brother god
[1:01:32] wants a church
[1:01:33] that moves in the divine will of god
[1:01:36] based upon thus saith the lord
[1:01:39] god will build his church upon the
[1:01:40] foundation of jesus christ and that's
[1:01:42] the bible
[1:01:44] outside of that all other grounds is
[1:01:46] sinking his hands
[1:01:47] god doesn't change his nature does not
[1:01:50] change he's the same
[1:01:52] yesterday today and forever can the
[1:01:55] church say amen
[1:01:57] god has waited for a long time to build
[1:01:59] this church
[1:02:02] a long time he has waited to build this
[1:02:05] church and god will not let me
[1:02:07] or you or anybody else stop this church
[1:02:10] can the church say amen he will have a
[1:02:13] perfect church
[1:02:14] a church that sin cannot stay in that
[1:02:16] church a church without spot or wrinkle
[1:02:18] a church at the moment you come upstairs
[1:02:20] you are healed
[1:02:22] without hands even being laid on but the
[1:02:24] branham said right now we pray for the
[1:02:26] sick but in that time we'll command the
[1:02:27] devil to leave
[1:02:29] hallelujah you don't hear me in that
[1:02:31] time we will command the devil cancer
[1:02:33] leave tumor leave
[1:02:36] at rightist leave blindness leave
[1:02:40] oh glory to god hallelujah high blood
[1:02:43] pressure leave
[1:02:44] it's got to go wide an adopted son will
[1:02:47] be speaking
[1:02:48] a son with the sea german the body the
[1:02:51] same power
[1:02:52] that jesus had people were healing
[1:02:54] peter's shadow
[1:02:56] peter wasn't even praying as peter
[1:02:57] walked his shadow he didn't have to come
[1:02:59] and touch with his shadow and you were
[1:03:01] healed
[1:03:02] what kind of church is that that's the
[1:03:04] kind of church
[1:03:05] that jesus came to build
[1:03:13] upon this rock i will build my church up
[1:03:17] this church nothing will stop it the
[1:03:19] first church
[1:03:20] you may be seeing the first church was
[1:03:23] in the garden of eden
[1:03:24] then god built a church with the
[1:03:25] apostles and that church fell
[1:03:28] but this was a master plan because god
[1:03:30] purposed himself
[1:03:31] to give the devil the final knockout
[1:03:33] punch
[1:03:36] god wanted to hit the devil where it
[1:03:38] hurts the most
[1:03:39] to build his eden to build it the best
[1:03:41] way he wanted to build it
[1:03:43] because god when he finished eden it was
[1:03:45] beautiful it was perfect
[1:03:47] there was no mistake nothing was out of
[1:03:49] place and the devil went into
[1:03:51] god's eden and upset the plan of god
[1:03:54] so god told satan go ahead go ahead and
[1:03:57] satan has built the best his best edom
[1:04:00] all the technology all the fashions all
[1:04:03] the styles
[1:04:04] everybody in place of all the politics
[1:04:07] everything looking nice
[1:04:08] and god is saying yes now i'm gonna have
[1:04:11] my people
[1:04:12] come and that eden all sin will be
[1:04:15] around them
[1:04:16] all hell will be against them but
[1:04:18] they're not gonna fall
[1:04:20] they are not gonna fail they're gonna
[1:04:22] have power
[1:04:23] they're gonna speak the world and it'll
[1:04:25] flash like lightning
[1:04:28] wait till the seven thunders utter their
[1:04:30] voices to that group
[1:04:32] what they see is gonna happen
[1:04:37] hallelujah glory to god somebody give
[1:04:40] god a shout out pray
[1:04:42] you may be seated but the brown said
[1:04:45] missing limbs
[1:04:46] will be restored it takes revelation
[1:04:50] to even repeat that you mean i don't
[1:04:52] even have to have a hand
[1:04:54] and god could speak a hand into
[1:04:55] existence what did he tell moses
[1:04:58] moses i was the one who made mountain i
[1:05:00] was the one who made your tongue
[1:05:02] i was the man who made your head what
[1:05:03] are you telling me what are you gonna
[1:05:04] say
[1:05:05] i will give you power i'm a creator i
[1:05:08] will create
[1:05:09] if there's a spine bone missing i'll put
[1:05:12] it back
[1:05:12] because i am god i don't need permission
[1:05:15] to fix you
[1:05:16] i don't need permission to heal you i
[1:05:18] don't need permission
[1:05:19] to take the pieces of your life and pray
[1:05:23] put it back together
[1:05:28] hallelujah somebody's saying man
[1:05:32] you may be seated god didn't ask
[1:05:34] permission
[1:05:35] to put the sun in place he didn't ask
[1:05:37] permission to put the moon in place
[1:05:39] and all things god will move whatever he
[1:05:42] has to move
[1:05:43] to get you into your place of god
[1:05:46] waiting to place his church
[1:05:48] into position
[1:05:51] you may be seated brother branham taught
[1:05:55] us
[1:05:56] perfect fate is based on your position
[1:05:59] you see when you know what your position
[1:06:02] is
[1:06:02] and you know what your authority is and
[1:06:04] you know what your power is
[1:06:08] oh you know god almighty
[1:06:12] wait till the church gets to know who
[1:06:14] she is she'll be an
[1:06:15] invincible army what is invincible mean
[1:06:19] nothing will stop you nothing will stop
[1:06:21] you
[1:06:22] nothing will stop you the gates of hell
[1:06:24] will never prevail
[1:06:26] never prevail
[1:06:40] you may be seated
[1:06:43] i'm feeling good i'm feeling good
[1:06:46] that's why we came here to church you
[1:06:48] may be seated
[1:06:52] i want this to rest deep on the inside
[1:06:55] inside
[1:06:56] because listen it's not just about this
[1:06:57] feeling
[1:06:59] i was sharing with them in digger martin
[1:07:01] on wednesday i said a lot of people
[1:07:04] love to deal with the symptom and not
[1:07:07] deal with the problem
[1:07:12] so when you get sick you want the doctor
[1:07:14] to give you a painkiller
[1:07:16] to kill the pain but the fact that pain
[1:07:19] exists
[1:07:20] is because there's some kind of bacteria
[1:07:23] virus or infection
[1:07:24] so people want to get the pain removed
[1:07:27] but they don't want god to operate and
[1:07:29] perform the surgery
[1:07:30] to cut out the infection can the church
[1:07:33] say amen
[1:07:34] so this sin problem sin is not the
[1:07:37] symptom
[1:07:41] sin is the root cause of the problem
[1:07:44] so when you see somebody smoking
[1:07:46] drinking
[1:07:47] fornication adultery those are all
[1:07:49] symptoms of the problem
[1:07:53] and some people come to church they just
[1:07:56] want the symptom address
[1:07:57] they want to come to church and feel
[1:07:59] good
[1:08:02] and then by wednesday by thursday
[1:08:04] they're a different person
[1:08:05] but god is coming with a knife today the
[1:08:08] knife of the world
[1:08:10] to perform surgery to make sure all the
[1:08:13] bad parts get cut out
[1:08:15] all the jealousy envy
[1:08:18] lust movie spirit evil spirit
[1:08:23] lion spirit you know what you have what
[1:08:26] the knife is here
[1:08:27] the table is open tonight we can do
[1:08:30] multiple surgeries tonight
[1:08:32] it doesn't have to be one at a time god
[1:08:34] is able to do
[1:08:35] simultaneous surgeries
[1:08:38] he's the only doctor to operate on
[1:08:41] everybody
[1:08:42] in the room at the same time
[1:08:46] at the same time you don't have to wait
[1:08:49] your turn
[1:08:50] he is operating right now
[1:08:54] oh do you know this jesus
[1:08:57] that i'm speaking about
[1:09:11] hallelujah you may be seated i'm not
[1:09:14] going to be too much longer with you
[1:09:16] but upon this rock i will build my
[1:09:19] church
[1:09:20] it is not the responsibility of the
[1:09:23] pastors to build the church
[1:09:25] of the teachers to build the church
[1:09:27] jesus himself identified in matthew 16
[1:09:30] who accepted the responsibility to build
[1:09:33] a church
[1:09:34] he said upon this rock i will build my
[1:09:38] church
[1:09:38] jesus is in the construction business
[1:09:41] jesus is in the building business
[1:09:43] jesus is in every kind of business he's
[1:09:46] not going to trust
[1:09:47] man to build this church all god wants
[1:09:49] is to give you a revelation
[1:09:52] and that revelation is to send you to
[1:09:55] your destination
[1:09:58] you're going to get it to the minute
[1:09:59] don't worry you you you gonna get it
[1:10:02] your revelation is to guarantee your
[1:10:05] destination
[1:10:06] because if god reveals himself to you it
[1:10:09] don't matter if you backslide
[1:10:11] that revelation is locked to your
[1:10:14] destination
[1:10:16] i'm jumping ahead of myself but you
[1:10:17] maybe see them this same peter
[1:10:20] who said tower to christ and jesus said
[1:10:24] upon this rock i build my church flesh
[1:10:26] and blood and reveal this to you
[1:10:27] later in matthew 16 when jesus was
[1:10:30] revealing finally himself to them
[1:10:32] peter said no i don't where you die
[1:10:35] jesus said get behind me satan the same
[1:10:37] peter
[1:10:38] with the revelation when jesus was about
[1:10:40] to be crucified this same peter
[1:10:43] was like i know i was not in church i
[1:10:46] don't know the church
[1:10:47] i don't know jesus i don't know james
[1:10:49] john them fellas
[1:10:53] this same peter when jesus died
[1:10:56] he said i am going fishing jesus took
[1:11:00] him from fishing
[1:11:01] listen without backsliding and signing
[1:11:03] right back to where he starts to know he
[1:11:04] didn't just backslide and say well let
[1:11:06] me just go and fast and pray no he said
[1:11:08] i'm going to take back my net
[1:11:10] right back where she doesn't find me i'm
[1:11:11] going right back there
[1:11:17] you have degrees of backsliding you know
[1:11:20] this is slide back to point one
[1:11:24] you see i go fishing right where jesus
[1:11:28] finds me as if
[1:11:29] only three and a half years don't matter
[1:11:30] just wipe it off push
[1:11:32] and then brothers with no revelation say
[1:11:35] well we're going fishing matthew attacks
[1:11:37] collector he don't he never pull a line
[1:11:38] in his life
[1:11:47] complete backslidden condition
[1:11:50] deny christ did they take away the
[1:11:53] revelation no
[1:11:57] that revelation somehow pulled him to
[1:12:01] the upper room
[1:12:02] he was nervous in the upper room but the
[1:12:05] brandon said they haul themselves in
[1:12:06] that room and
[1:12:07] you know what hall mean like you drag
[1:12:08] yourself he didn't walk in the upper
[1:12:10] room
[1:12:10] god bless you this is upper room service
[1:12:12] no no no fellas
[1:12:14] take the time it was pressure but when
[1:12:16] they got to the upper room the bible
[1:12:18] said when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:12:19] come
[1:12:20] brother that's seeing peter that seeing
[1:12:23] peter
[1:12:24] when the holy ghost when he got his own
[1:12:26] lick of fire
[1:12:28] not james like a fire not john licker
[1:12:30] fire when he got his own lick of fire
[1:12:33] he said these men are not drunk as you
[1:12:34] suppose we might be acting drunk we
[1:12:37] might be
[1:12:37] looking drunk you might not understand
[1:12:39] all of my words but
[1:12:40] this is that that the prophet joel spoke
[1:12:44] about
[1:12:45] you could watch me but you can't touch
[1:12:48] me
[1:12:50] and gold i don't have but such as i have
[1:12:52] i can give to you because the holy ghost
[1:13:00] i pray this helps somebody today
[1:13:03] to look differently at your trials look
[1:13:06] differently at your situations
[1:13:08] look differently at your problems and
[1:13:10] look to your destination
[1:13:11] which is the upper room your personal
[1:13:14] experience
[1:13:15] with the pillar of fire it's between you
[1:13:18] and god by yourself
[1:13:25] you maybe see this
[1:13:28] my my mind upon this rock rock a
[1:13:31] revelation
[1:13:32] so let me drop this in every age had
[1:13:35] a revelation so i thank god for a
[1:13:39] prophet
[1:13:40] who took the revelation from each church
[1:13:43] age
[1:13:44] seven revelations seven voices
[1:13:47] seven confessions seven thunders and
[1:13:50] upon this rock
[1:13:52] of the entire revelation we can now
[1:13:55] rebuild the church by the power of the
[1:13:58] spirit
[1:13:59] to build a super church a super race as
[1:14:02] we
[1:14:03] near the headstone a church that will be
[1:14:05] the final voice
[1:14:07] to the final age where you will have
[1:14:09] power to speak for your children
[1:14:11] to speak for your wife to speak for your
[1:14:14] husband
[1:14:14] to speak for your situation you won't
[1:14:16] even need a pastor to speak you will
[1:14:19] have power to speak yourself
[1:14:21] can the church say man
[1:14:26] let me skip some of it you already
[1:14:28] preached me out already
[1:14:33] just going to read two more quotes and
[1:14:35] then get ready to close out
[1:14:41] with iran i'm in the message revelation
[1:14:42] of jesus christ said let me show you
[1:14:44] another reason
[1:14:45] why satan hates this book of revelation
[1:14:47] of jesus christ in the church
[1:14:49] but i'm taught that satan hates two
[1:14:51] books in particular genesis
[1:14:53] and revelation because if the church
[1:14:56] gets a revelation she's unstoppable
[1:15:00] this is brother branham he said he knows
[1:15:01] this is satan knows
[1:15:03] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:15:06] today and forever and he changes not
[1:15:08] he knows that a whole lot more than do
[1:15:12] 90 of the theologians he knows that
[1:15:15] since god
[1:15:16] is immutable in his nature and that word
[1:15:19] immutable means unchanging in his nature
[1:15:22] then he is just as immutable or
[1:15:24] unchanging in his ways
[1:15:27] thus satan knows assortedly that the
[1:15:29] original church
[1:15:31] at pentecost with the power of god saint
[1:15:34] mark
[1:15:34] 16 in action is the true church that
[1:15:38] jesus christ claims as his own and all
[1:15:40] else
[1:15:41] is false now remember this christ
[1:15:44] in the true church is a continuation of
[1:15:47] the book of acts
[1:15:51] but the book of revelation shows that
[1:15:53] the antichrist
[1:15:54] spirit would come into the church and
[1:15:58] defile it
[1:16:00] make it lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:16:04] the book of revelation exposes satan
[1:16:06] revealing his works
[1:16:08] right down to the time he is cast into
[1:16:10] the lake of fire
[1:16:12] and he fights that he cannot stand it
[1:16:15] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:16:18] revelation of the true church and what
[1:16:21] she
[1:16:22] is what she stands for and that she
[1:16:24] could do the greater work she will be an
[1:16:26] invincible army
[1:16:28] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:16:32] spirits within the framework of the
[1:16:36] christian church
[1:16:37] and by god's spirit discern and
[1:16:39] withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:16:42] satan will be powerless before her can
[1:16:44] the church say amen
[1:16:46] is that the kind of church we're looking
[1:16:47] for where we can discern the spirit in
[1:16:50] the church and withstand the antichrist
[1:16:52] spirit
[1:16:53] and withstand the worldly fashion and
[1:16:55] the styles
[1:16:56] can the church see him
[1:17:10] so after jesus said i will all say also
[1:17:12] unto thee in verse 18 that what peter
[1:17:14] and upon this rock i will build my
[1:17:16] church and the gates of hell
[1:17:18] shall not prevail against it
[1:17:22] and then jesus goes on and speaks of the
[1:17:24] authority that he is placing in the
[1:17:25] church
[1:17:26] and he said i will give unto thee the
[1:17:29] keys of the kingdom of heaven
[1:17:31] that whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[1:17:34] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:17:37] thou shalt loosen
[1:17:38] it shall be loosed in heaven and this
[1:17:41] authority still rest
[1:17:43] in the church today can the church say
[1:17:45] amen
[1:17:46] this authority is still here today and
[1:17:48] today
[1:17:49] we are losing souls that have been in
[1:17:52] bondage
[1:17:53] for a long time but you are set free
[1:17:56] today
[1:17:56] to possess your individual inheritance
[1:18:04] the musicians can get ready
[1:18:08] now notice this friends after the
[1:18:12] revelation
[1:18:12] comes out in verse 21 the bible says
[1:18:16] and this is what jesus was really trying
[1:18:19] to get to
[1:18:20] all along because he wanted to share
[1:18:23] certain things with his disciples but he
[1:18:24] could not tell them
[1:18:26] until he was sure they knew who he was
[1:18:29] then the bible says from that time forth
[1:18:32] began
[1:18:33] jesus to show unto his disciples
[1:18:36] how that he must go into jerusalem and
[1:18:38] suffer
[1:18:39] many things of the elders and chief
[1:18:41] priests and scribes and be killed and be
[1:18:43] raised again the third day
[1:18:46] then peter took him and began to rebuke
[1:18:48] him peter is really something else
[1:18:50] peter began to rebuke jesus see be far
[1:18:53] from the
[1:18:54] lord this shall not be unto thee but he
[1:18:57] turned and said unto peter get thee
[1:18:59] behind me satan thou art on offense unto
[1:19:02] me
[1:19:02] for those savoriest not the things that
[1:19:05] be of god but those
[1:19:07] that be of men
[1:19:11] what do you savor today is it the things
[1:19:14] of god or
[1:19:16] or is it the things of men
[1:19:20] and then jesus goes on and as a musician
[1:19:22] begin to play something softly
[1:19:24] and then jesus shares something really
[1:19:26] powerful then jesus said unto his
[1:19:28] disciples
[1:19:30] if any man will come after me let him
[1:19:33] deny himself
[1:19:35] and take up his cross and follow me
[1:19:40] amen deny yourself means denying the
[1:19:43] things that you want to do
[1:19:46] the things that you like to do deny
[1:19:49] yourself of your dreams and visions and
[1:19:52] passions
[1:19:54] and take up his cross and follow me
[1:19:57] follow
[1:19:58] follow after jesus jesus is saying if
[1:20:01] if if any man will come after me let him
[1:20:04] deny
[1:20:04] himself that is one of the
[1:20:08] hardest things to do to deny yourself
[1:20:14] because it's so easy for you to have
[1:20:15] your plans your dreams your ambitions
[1:20:17] your desires what
[1:20:18] you want to achieve what you like to see
[1:20:20] for yourself and how you want to see
[1:20:22] your house and your
[1:20:23] your family and whatever it is god is
[1:20:25] saying
[1:20:26] deny yourself
[1:20:29] and follow me amen for whosoever this is
[1:20:32] scripture
[1:20:33] whosoever shall save his life shall lose
[1:20:36] it
[1:20:38] so any attempt that you make to save
[1:20:41] your life
[1:20:43] you're going to lose it but whoever
[1:20:46] shall lose his life
[1:20:50] for my sake shall find it
[1:20:55] and the challenge today is how many of
[1:20:57] us are really ready
[1:20:59] to give it all away
[1:21:02] for jesus to give it all away that he
[1:21:06] could
[1:21:07] really be the driver of this car
[1:21:10] just this life and verse 26 says for
[1:21:14] what
[1:21:15] is a man profited it's so paradoxical
[1:21:19] how in this one
[1:21:20] chapter of matthew 16 is such a journey
[1:21:23] to this one chapter
[1:21:25] from jesus battle with the pharisees to
[1:21:27] him reminding his disciples of
[1:21:28] how he broke bread and fed for five
[1:21:30] thousand then he asked them who do men
[1:21:32] say i am then
[1:21:33] and who do you say i am and he tells
[1:21:34] them the authority
[1:21:36] that upon revelation i'll build my
[1:21:39] church and i'm gonna give you the keys
[1:21:40] and then he ends with her with
[1:21:41] a sermon a powerful sin and a message in
[1:21:45] and of itself
[1:21:46] what is a man profited
[1:21:50] if he shall gain the whole world and
[1:21:53] lose his
[1:21:53] own soul or what shall a man give
[1:21:57] in exchange for his soul so many times
[1:22:01] we find ourselves
[1:22:02] fighting doing this running doing this
[1:22:04] trying to do this trying to achieve this
[1:22:06] trying to gain the whole world
[1:22:11] and our soul is at risk
[1:22:15] some time ago i said at a house meeting
[1:22:17] i'm not too bothered by your feelings
[1:22:19] your emotions your
[1:22:21] self-esteem their their times we spend
[1:22:23] time talking about these things but
[1:22:25] your esteem goes up and down your
[1:22:27] feelings go up and down their days your
[1:22:29] sadder days that you're happy
[1:22:31] what i'm concerned about is the
[1:22:32] destination of your soul
[1:22:36] because you could have high self-esteem
[1:22:37] and lose your soul
[1:22:39] you could have money in the bank and you
[1:22:41] could lose your soul your marriage could
[1:22:42] be perfect
[1:22:44] and you could lose your soul you could
[1:22:46] have the best children in the world and
[1:22:48] and lose your soul
[1:22:50] you could be respected in your community
[1:22:52] and you could lose
[1:22:53] your soul you could be jumping and
[1:22:55] shouting in church and lose your soul
[1:22:57] you could be a minister and lose your
[1:22:59] soul you could be a pastor and lose your
[1:23:01] soul
[1:23:02] elder deacon trusty and lose your soul
[1:23:06] don't you take that risk with your soul
[1:23:13] if other people want to give their soul
[1:23:16] up to the world that's that's them deny
[1:23:20] yourself deny yourself
[1:23:23] some of the friends that you want to
[1:23:24] keep around you deny yourself some of
[1:23:27] the places that
[1:23:28] you want to go to deny yourself some of
[1:23:30] the books that you want to read deny
[1:23:32] yourself
[1:23:32] some of the things that you want to see
[1:23:35] deny yourself for the sake of christ
[1:23:42] is there anyone here today who doesn't
[1:23:43] know jesus
[1:23:48] it's a real deep question because many
[1:23:51] people don't know jesus
[1:23:53] they know church you know the message
[1:23:55] they know books they know tapes but they
[1:23:56] have never
[1:23:57] had a personal encounter with jesus
[1:24:02] to hear that still small voice saying
[1:24:05] go and sin no more that still
[1:24:08] small voice saying have you decided to
[1:24:11] follow me that still small voice that
[1:24:14] says whatever you shall lose for my sake
[1:24:17] you're gonna gain
[1:24:18] so much more maybe there's one person
[1:24:21] here today
[1:24:24] that's why we call this a restoration
[1:24:26] service
[1:24:28] to restore your contact with god
[1:24:32] to restore your relationship with god
[1:24:35] to restore your communication with god
[1:24:37] to restore your prayer life with god
[1:24:40] and to reach the point in your life that
[1:24:42] you are truly ready not just to sing the
[1:24:44] song i give myself away but
[1:24:46] to really give yourself away lord i give
[1:24:51] i give my friends away i give i give
[1:24:54] everything away because
[1:24:55] i give it all away i give it i give
[1:24:57] myself away my own thoughts my own
[1:25:00] feelings my own ambitions i give it all
[1:25:02] away i give it
[1:25:03] i give it all away because this
[1:25:06] revelation is so real to me i want to be
[1:25:08] part of that church
[1:25:10] lord i'm ready today to give it all away
[1:25:14] if i lose my job i give it away today if
[1:25:17] i
[1:25:17] lose my prestige i give it all away
[1:25:20] people can laugh at me but i give it all
[1:25:24] away
[1:25:26] branham said god cannot build this
[1:25:27] church and a bunch of
[1:25:29] nonsense you can't dress how you want
[1:25:33] live how you want you have to
[1:25:34] give away how you want to dress give
[1:25:36] away how you want to live
[1:25:38] give away how you want to act because
[1:25:40] you want to follow christ
[1:25:42] not follow the church not follow the
[1:25:43] past or follow christ
[1:25:45] that's what we are preaching today
[1:25:47] brother branham came to point to christ
[1:25:49] i'm pointing to christ that same jesus
[1:25:54] and as we approach easter palm sunday
[1:25:57] good friday easter sunday
[1:26:00] jesus in matthew 16 was sharing
[1:26:03] something intimate with his disciples as
[1:26:05] he said

[1:26:09] i'm about to suffer many things he
[1:26:12] wasn't suffering for himself
[1:26:14] he was suffering for us i'm about to be
[1:26:17] beaten i'm about to be
[1:26:18] bruised i'm about to be laughed at mark
[1:26:21] spit on
[1:26:22] and i'm gonna die a painful death
