Um he's inure right now medical condition. So we just want to bowheads and pray also for brother Steven and sister Dr. King. Let's pray.

Father God in a special way and I pray for my friend Lord brother Solomon Aina that you will touch him in a special way in God that you would raise him up in good health and strength that he have a speedy recovery granted God as we approach your word tonight. May your presence be with us speak to us and may draw our hearts closer to you longing for you. Granted, God in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And amen. So, God bless you and uh we would like to go to the word tonight. Um I'm going to take two portion of scripture. Philippians chapter 3 verse 14 and Luke chapter 16 verse 16. Philippians chapter 3 verse 14. And Luke 16. We read Philippians 3. This is Paul speaks. I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. And Luke 16:16, the law and the prophet were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man pressth into it. Now we have used the scripture several times. We have preached on pressing into it and so like that. But tonight I want to take a different approach to it. I have a title I press slash you have to force yourself. That's the emphasis there. You have to force yourself. Press means to steady to push to trust. It means to continue to move forward and to go through in a forceful way, persevering with all you've got. Pressing means going past your comfort zone. People like to stay safe in their safe zone, in their comfort zone. You hear us speak about building muscles in the gym, lifting weights. Sometimes if you live the same weight all the time, you wouldn't really get far. You need to keep increasing the weight to put strain and stress and that is where the muscles is built. Now, brother Brandon said this here about the cry for revival. It's it's it's wonderful to hear that. And he said, remember in amidst all all this cry, God can't send a revival until he got man in shape to take it. We cannot have a revival until we get God called men. God trained men that is not trained in a school of theology. Rugged men of fate that God has brought up in the school of his rugged training. Men who are not afraid to face the fire. man who has come into the presence of God and knows his power and knows his omnipotence and knows his healing power. Some men are trained to know the living God. It's all right to train them by the word but the letter killth. The spirit giveth life. But listen to the point I want to get here. And many people praying for revival. I wonder if sometimes if those are those who are praying if their own prayers don't stop up the wells of blessing. Listen to these words. People are praying and he's asking if their own prayers don't stop up the wells of blessing when they are cowardly and afraid to trust God. Afraid to take him at his word. Afraid to believe that he still lives today when the Bible plainly says he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Now he said desperation and remember he gave the story about the woman who had a dead baby in Mexico and she was she hold on to a baby and she wasn't letting anybody take that baby. She was trying to get to him. She's speaking Spanish. I'm not sure if she knew who brother really was. But all she wanted to get is to the platform and they tried to stop her. She passed through legs. They had a whole havoc going on there with that woman. But she was desperate. She wanted that baby raised from the dead and her desperation caused heaven to respond and Baram saw a vision of the baby smiling. Then he said, "Bring that lady to me." And of course the story is raised from the dead. So he's saying here desperation when thou seekest me with all thine heart then I'll hear you. The kingdom words from desperation. The law and the prophets were until John. Since then, the kingdom of heaven has been preached and man pressed into it. Then he said these words, "You don't just stand around and say, "Pick me up by the color, Lord. Push me in." You press into it. You get desperate between life and death. So to press is to act upon through a steady pushing a trusting force. That is what press said the law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man pressth into it. Now that word press is a word, a Greek verb called bazo meaning to use force, to press, to seize violently, to constrain. And that same word is a word used in Matthew 11:12. The kingdom of heaven suffer violence and the violent take it by force. So this is not a casual passive approach to the gospel or a casual passive approach to a Christian war. Jesus is saying you want the kingdom you press. You want the kingdom you push. You want the kingdom you force. And forcing means you are coming against resistance. Now I know a lot of people don't like the word confrontation and they fight to avoid confrontation and whatnot. Confrontation is part of life, part of how we have to deal with. And you cannot really defeat what you are not prepared to confront. And the first person you need to confront is yourself. That is the first person you need to confront confront you. And the woman with the blood issue. That woman, you know, seeing it from this perspective, you have to force yourself. She told herself if I could just touch his mouth. Let me just read it here in Mark 5. Certain woman which had a certain blood 12 years had suffered many things, many position. I'll skip down quickly. She heard of Jesus. Watch these words. She had heard of Jesus came in the press behind and touch his garment. And she said, "If I may touch, but his clothes I shall behold." And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up. And she felt her body that she was healed of that plague. Jesus immediately knowing himself that virtue had gone on from him, turned him about in the press, and said, "Who touched my clothes?" And this disciples disciples said unto him, "Thou seeest the multitude throng in thee, and see as thou who touch me?" And he look around to see her that had done this thing. And the woman fearing, trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. And he said unto her, "Daughter, thy feet have made thee whole. Go in peace, and behold of thy plague." So she pressed through the crowd. She pressed through despite her weakness. She pressed through besides her shame and there was a law concerning when you are in your periods or your monthlies or you're going through this blood issue. You're not supposed to go that way. But she purposed that her condition was so grave that she had was to force herself. And forcing herself means going against the grain. What people will think, what people would feel, that is what we're talking about. Are you prepared tonight to force yourself to pray, to force yourself to do something different? You know, like the doctor will say, "Okay, you're getting elderly. You still need to exercise. You still need to walk, but you don't feel like walking." But if you push yourself and force yourself, your body will get some activity in it that will get get a little ease, a little smooth. But there's a little hump to go over. There's a little resistance to go over. Look at this one here. There's one that be familiar with is one I love. Mark 10 speaking about blind Batimus. Mark 10:46. And they came to Jericho and the disciples a great number of people blind Batimus sat by the highway begging. So he is in his comfort zone. He's blind. Your accustom waiting there with his bucket or whatever it is. He's begging normal, no fancy stuff. Then verse 47, he heard it was Jesus of Nazareth. And they begin to cry out, "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy upon me." Now Jesus was some distance away, another street, whatever. And Jesus couldn't hear him physically. And many, there's a part now you believers, listen to this. Many charged him. He's not one person saying, "Hash him out. Hold your peace. Keep quiet." Many charged him that he should hold his peace. But he cried to Moore a great deal. Thou son of David, have mercy on me. He forced himself. He forced himself despite criticism. He forced himself despite the many saying the same thing that he should get quiet. He want to believe he gave wild. He want to carry on like that. Um you know keep it take it easy and so on like that. Um how do you say supreme power and control? He was blind. You can't gain that scripture. Keep it easy. Keep it quiet. He begin to cry out. And I want to challenge you tonight to force yourself. And Jesus stood still and commanded him to be caught. So his forcing himself in fate, forcing himself in crying out affected him, give heaven give a response through Jesus. And Jesus sent for him. And they called the blind man, saying unto him, "Be of good comfort. Rise." He called for thee. and he casting away his garment which will be his beggar's garment because you don't beg in jacket and tie you don't beg in in fancy clothes you beg in beggar's garments that people will give he rose and came to Jesus and Jesus answered said unto him what will thou that I should do unto thee I think some other prayer service we touched this the blind man said Lord that I might receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him, "Go thy way. Thy faith had made thee whole." And immediately you receive his sight and follow Jesus in the way. Now when you look at this, the question arises, how much faith do we have? Are we fooling around with unbelief? What I will call unconscious unbelief. In other words, the unbelief that you're not aware of unconscious unbelief. Because faith has a behavior. Faith has a response. Faith is not talk. Faith is not saying I believe. Faith has action to go with it. So this blind Batimus forced himself beyond his critics or his people trying to hinder him, beyond the ridicule. Uh keep quiet, not so loud. and he cried louder and Jesus responded. Let's do another one in Mark 2. He entered Capernaum. This one after some days there was noise that he was in the house and straightway many were gathered together in so much that there was no room to receive them, not so much as about the door. And he preached the word unto them. And they came unto him bringing one sick of the paly which was born of four. So four men carrying a man's friend sick. And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was. And when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palace lay. And when Jesus saw their feet, this is what we talking about. They force themselves not to say okay it is crowded we'll come back another day we'll come back another night when the Bible says no faith is I am telling you tonight could be your night right in your home right in quietness right in there's nobody else around something could strike something could change something could flip that changes your perspective that you could push and you could force yourself so Jesus saw their faith it. So this forcing, this pressing, this pushing beyond your comfort zone or pushing beyond how you feel. Well, let's pray quiet and let's pray this way and you're accustomed with this. And this is where you have to try to go past your comfort zone. If you don't reach out to people, begin to reach out. If you don't greet people, greet people. If you don't say hello and communicate, try words will come to your mouth. do what needs to be done because this thing about not forcing yourself is what have so many people in what you call it um when you keep uh putting off things I forget the names uh where you keep you know you keep putting off putting off putting off putting off there's a word just that comes to my mind right now but when you keep putting off stuff that you're supposed to do this forcing yourself it challenges you to do what needs to be done regardless of your feelings, your emotions, your condition. It has to be done. And this is where procrastinate. Somebody said it. Oh, thank you. Thank you, sister. That is the word. This is a curse that affects people and procrastinate. And when you procrastinate, the things pile up. Now in in dealing with I think um not purchasing a house but fixing a house they say try to do the most expensive thing first and then you go down from there. So you do the expensive thing and you go down small and low. If we take that and apply it to what we need to do, you do what is pressing and what is looking so hard. You have to get it done because when you keep putting on doing petty things, minor things, all kind of things. You're busy busy busy, but you're not getting to the thing you need to get done. And this is where I am challenge you tonight about seeking first the kingdom. Put things in order. put things right. And we we know the story about this guy, right? I'm going to skip this. The last story I have here is one we familiar with is Jacob. Genesis 32. I want to read from 24. Jacob was left alone. Many times I spoke about that people like the crowd. They like the friends like the environment, young people and whatnot. And they don't have time to examine themselves. You go with the flow. You go with the talk. You go with the atmosphere. you go with what is you know what you think is meaningful. But when Jacob was le left alone, and they wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh. And the hollow of Jacob's thie was out of joint, and he wrestled with him. And he said, "Let me go, for the day break it." And he said, "I will not let you go except you bless me." This is a man that is desperate. He's afraid of Esau, his brother. Esau want to kill him. He sent his wives all different ways and so like that. He is scared. He is wealthy and frightened. He is powerful and frightened. He's not safe. And here it is. He have an angelic encounter. And he's not satisfied just to be in the presence of an angel. He is looking for transformation. And he uttered these words. I will not let you go until you bless me. And to think that a human being, a man wrestled with an angel because of the depth of his desperation in so much that he refused to let go. It speaks volumes. Jacob forced himself to win that fight. And he said, "Thy name shall be no more Jacob, but Israel. For as a prince thou has power with God and with men and has prevailed. So Jacob fought all night pressing through the fear of Esau, pressing through the ex the exhaustion until he got a name change. To press, listen, is to force oneself. I don't want to see press as a exhorting word or a scriptural terminology. press. I press towards the mark as a as a phrase. I want you to see it different tonight. To press is to force oneself. Hear me church. To exert effort, to push beyond resistance, to push beyond ridicule, to push beyond the laughter of your critics. Now I say I have one more here. Esther Esther had to force herself. Almost done. The very simple lesson tonight. Esther had to force herself because she is queen. And when Mori was fasting and it was a s is a was that a signal something is wrong and he had to tell her do you think you in your comfort zone you in that position you in that place that you'll be safe from what is happening listen you got to adjust you got to force yourself I know the rules The rules is you cannot go into the presence of the king unless you are called. But the need was great. A people was about to be destroyed. And Esther had a choice like you tonight. Esther had to make a decision herself. Modi couldn't do it for her. Nobody else could do it for her. She had was to decide whether this thing was worth it life or death to force herself. and she did it. The Bible said, he said, "Go gather to get all the Jews that are present at Shushan and fast for me." So Esther was looking to appeal to heaven. Esther was fasting to get amplified prayer. Esther wasn't just looking for flesh and blood. She was looking for the supernatural element that would have made the difference. She said, "Neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will I go in unto the king which is not according to the law. And this is the verse here. If I perish, I perish. Now Esther was convinced that this challenge before her was worth forcing herself. What do you see tonight? What do you see as what challenge tonight? How could I inspire you or get you or motivate you? How could this word inspire you to force yourself to do better? Forces yourself to be a better husband, better wife, better mother, better father. Force yourself to learn, to grow, to press, to overcome, to stand, to witness, to testify. Force yourself. 1 Corinthians 9:27. This is the last scripture Paul speaks. But I keep under my body and bring it into subjection least by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a cast away. So Paul is saying he take responsibility for his own body and bring it in subjection. So Paul cannot be standing by side of the road looking at sexy dress woman but can can't be can't be reading sexy magazines and so like that and talking about he going to fight and then fight and fight. He knew what to stay away from. He knew what to avoid. He knew how to put it together because this is what discipline is all about. He forced himself and brought his body in subjection. There is a responsibility before us. We give you two scriptures. One is the kingdom of God is preached and every man is pressing to it. Even though the pastor set it up in a way where as long as they belong to a church, well, you make it. That is just becoming like a tribulation saint. We we can't tell you that. That is not the truth. The truth is the wise virgin press hard enough to get the extra oil. Call it extra prayer, extra fasting, extra seeking, whatever it took, but they got the extra. And when the foolish asked for oil, they said not so. We have enough of ourselves. We can't share it with you. So the English word press is from a word, a Latin word called prasar. No is prasar. It's p r e s s a r e. It means to apply force, to push, to squeeze, to urge with persistence, to move forward despite resistance. Tonight I have these words here. You can force yourself to pray even though you don't feel like doing it. You can force yourself to pray. Let's bow our hands. Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight. This was just riding me all day about forcing yourself, forcing oneself. And I'm seeing it in the scriptures. I'm seeing is not just I'm waiting on the Lord and just every anything is anything goes s whatever will be will be. No, it's not that people were determined. Paul said not that I have attained but I press towards the mark. Here was a son. There was a servant. Here was a converted person filled with the Holy Ghost. There was a prophet talking about I press, I force, I push. Oh God, wake up the church tonight. Wake us up tonight to push, to force, to press. But Abraham said that the early church had so much of God and they they did they do like if they didn't have much. They always wanted a refilling. They wanted more of the Holy Ghost. He said this church doesn't have and they don't even act like if they want more of it. God, may it not be so tonight. May you light a bonfire, Father, in every heart here tonight. Every person under the song of my voice, may you light a bonfire, a Holy Ghost fire in their hearts and life as they cry out unto you in prayer. In Jesus name I ask it. So I trust tonight that these few words that I share with you would help you and would strengthen you. Praise God in pressing forward in God. Amen. Force yourself tonight. So God bless you as we get on in prayer. Praise the Lord. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat.

Heavenly father we pray for Ruth Lord that your holy spirit will visit her father even now Lord from the crown of her head your soul of her feet. you know our condition father but you are the God oh God who made this body who made this mind who made all part of us father and I pray that your healing virtue would flow Lord you promise in the last days that the sons of God will be manifested you promise in the last days that you'll confirm your word among your people Jesus come among us tonight and pass by her neighborhood right where she is in the hospital right right where she is we pass by and touch and heal her and deliver her in the name of Jesus and any person here tonight not feeling well, struggling, Father God, in their body, in their mind, in their spirit. I pray a special touch for them that your healing virtue will flow. Father, remember the elderly among us. Remember the Caleb among us. Remember those who are aging, Father God, that you would give them the strength, the revelation, the inspiration, that their lives are not in vain, that their lives have purpose, and you want to be glorified in them and through them and by them. Oh God, we got a word tonight to force ourselves to press our way. Lord, that is how you set it up, Lord. Not only to stand and look at the land, but every place you put your foot is an effort to place feet and footsteps is possession. It's an effort to take action. It's an effort, Lord, to act and to do what is right and to do what is pleasing in your sight. Oh God, the prophet spoke about the passion to know the word, the cry to get in the spirit and and the most important part I believe is the fervent desire to please you, to please God, to please you in all that we do. Father, whatever in word or deed to do all in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, look over the sons and daughters tonight. Look over the mothers and the fathers tonight. Look over the husbands and wives tonight. Look at the young people tonight. Look at the children tonight and visit them with your presence and grace. Preserve them in your love. Preserve them in your grace. Preserve them in your kindness. Oh God, as the days are evil. And oh God, we ask for your supernatural intervention. Father, even as Esther says, pray and fast because she looking for supernatural intervention. Our strength is in you. Our hope is in you. And Lord, as the prophet said, we could be hindering our own selves by not acting, by just praying, praying, praying with no action behind it. But we are challenged tonight to force ourselves to do, to live, to testify, to witness, have your way. Father, I commit this service into your hands this coming Sunday, this one service Sunday morning. I commit the people into your hands even now in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you and thanks for being here tonight. I trust the Lord uh really inspire you to push push push past your limitations. Push past your fears, push past what you feel you cannot get past, you can push past it. You have to you must. Shamgar when he when he got tired of of of those people coming and raiding him and reading his crops, he said enough is enough. And he took what he had in his hand and begin to beat. I mean that's a lot of faith in you know because it wasn't like a weapon per se but he decide I had enough and not taken anymore. He pushed himself. He pushed himself. Samson same thing. Thousand men jawbone he started beat and he defeated those men. He pushed himself. You can the devil trying to tell us you can't. The devil trying to say he's not the same yesterday and forever. He is and he'll make a way for you. God bless you. Have a blessed night. Thanks again for being here. be praise.
