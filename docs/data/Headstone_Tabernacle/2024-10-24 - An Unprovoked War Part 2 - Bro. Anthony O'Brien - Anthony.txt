get a bandid for that wound can you nurse on the on his breast El sh he is the breasted one you can nurse on his promises and find strength because you have to go in the battle Again The Pavilion is not forever it's just for a rest period so that you could go back Hallelujah and fight again isn't that right you live to fight another day oh God give you that rest Oh Come unto me Christ is that rest tonight he is that Pavilion tonight he is that rock David said is higher than I and when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to that rock that is be above me and before me and whom in all Tempest and all storms he endures as a safe haven as a secret place as a place of rest from all the Winds of life that blow contrary oh Hallelujah this is the moment where the story changes now the changing of the tide isn't that right they chose the wrong day they chose a wrong man to mess with David put on his prayer garments David clothes himself in God's humility clothe himself in God's righteousness oh H his faith was counted as righteousness and he come into the presence of God with the right comment on on the right time on the right day in the right season and he said Lord shall I pursue oh brother if you ever discover that there's power in prayer there's power in that EA tonight oh whenever you are in trouble go and get your EA tonight if the devil is attacking your children if the devil is attacking your home if you end up in an unprovoked War tonight go get your ephod oh Hallelujah and get down into prayer and see what God will do tonight oh there is power in prayer when you recognize your divine right as a Son of God then you put on your ephod and you call upon God and he will answer tonight what we need is no neology we don't need no more theology but what we need tonight is neology some sons and some daughters tonight who know how to get down on their knees and pray pray until God answer pray until God hears us cry until God hears our cry and say I've heard the cries of my people and I have come down to deliver themall oh Hallelujah theology has failed for a thousand years what we need is neology tonight to bring back the Holy Ghost into the church oh Hallelujah isn't that rightall expectation what God calls great or what man calls great God calls foolish and what man called foolish God called great that's what we have to do is get back into the program of God the prophet said and find out after all what God wants us to do Hallelujah and the only way I know to do it the prophet said is prayer prayer is the key oh can we say Amen tonight I'm almost finished not a little while longer amen oh and that's the answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings he said there's no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God did you know that he said he said it will do it it did it one time amen and then he went down into Hezekiah isn't that right talking about that Prophet praise God he said thus day the Lord he's not coming off the bed he's going to die right there and he he said I can imagine all the celebrities saying oh the he good King is going to die the king is going to die thus say the Lord he's going to die but the prophet said Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and wept bitterly and the Lord said I said I Lord I beseech the he said you to consider me he said I walk before you with a perfect heart he said I need 15 years longer to get my kingdom in a condition and he said you know it looks like God would have wanted to say something he said but he he he'd have told him while he was talking to him but he said God has a way of doing things he said you have to come God's way and God's means of doing things and as long as we try to get it in ourselves it won't work we just can't pattern after another he said but we've got to live IND individually before God he said and the greatest man of the land isn't that right praise God was a king and there was the greatest man on Earth talking to the greatest man in heaven and yet the great powers of Heaven couldn't talk back to the king because he wasn't meant to be that he was just a king so he then he talked to Isaiah and that was his Prophet amen that was his mouthpiece and he said go tell him I've heard his prayers and tell him I'm going to spare him 15 more years and if prayer could do that tonight then prayer could change your situation tonight prayer could change your circumstance tonight oh seek the Lord while he may be found and call upon him while he is near isn't that right oh Lord the prophet said let's just ask God tonight just don't spare nothing he said but pour out to the powers of Heaven if he has to shake us and tear us to pieces and go down to The Potter's House and be remolded again if that's what it takes the prophet said that's what I want and I think that's what every honest hearted believer wants no matter what it takes isn't that right we pray until we get an answer tonight oh amen almost ready to close David inquired of the Lord sh shall I pursue this troop shall I overtake him and God said don't worry you're going to get everything back what an encouragement from the Lord tonight oh that you are going to recover all that you have lost oh hallelujah hallelujah the Bible says even young men shall faint and utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength shall be restored unto you all the years that the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Locust and the Palmer worm had taken away from you there is a promise tonight of restoration when you wait upon Him musician could come Hallelujah there is a promise of restoration there is a promise of redemption when you wait upon him when you seek his face when you turn from your Wicked Ways then you're going to hear from Heaven he's going to forgive your sins he will heal your land he will heal your son he will heal your daughter he will fix your circumstance he will do what he promised to do cuz only he can do it and we just surrender to his will and say Lord God I've done all I know I can do here is thy faithful servant Lord all things are ready send the fire lord send the anointing father send a cold from off the altar Here I Am Lord Jesus I'm in your hands oh Hallelujah and David went and got 600 men isn't that right went to the brook and David pursued he and 400 men and 200 men with him and so forth like that isn't that right I'll paraphrase I'm skipping along they met an Egyptian in the field and they fed him and so forth and they say uhhh where did you come from and he said I'm a young man of Egypt I'm an I'm a servant of the amalekite my master left me because he was Tre I was three days gone and sick isn't that right and and David said show me where these people are isn't that right and David when he was brought them down behold they will spread abroad all the Earth all the amalekites was eating they was drinking they was having a party because they thought they had got all the spoil they don't need no more spoil no more time for party time for drink up time for festivities oh Hallelujah and right in the middle of their party right in the middle of Satan's Eden God's going to raise up a crop tonight who knows that under them messenger they're going to be the final voice to the final age God already give them a word to pursue after their Revival tonight to pursue after all that the enemy has taken all the enemy has robbed the church he robbed Luther he robbed the weslan robbed the Pentecostals oh hallel the Holy Ghost baptism oh Hallelujah but this bride will not be deceived this prde will not be like Eve oh there are more for us than against us tonight and if God be with us then we shall be able to drive out the enemy to pursue our enemy as the Lord had said oh give the Lord a shout of Praise hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory you could play something softly oh Hallelujah they began to eat and drink and David Came Upon them just as they came upon Him unprovoked David Came Upon them unprovoked oh the devil is not looking for this bride he thinks you're defeated but we're going to come at him brother one of these days he's going to wake up to realize that there's a God in you the same God that was in Peter that healed a lame man at the gate called beautiful that same God will be in up Pride one of these days and she will say Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I unto thee and hell is going to shake brother because there'll be a bride on the earth doing the same things that Jesus did when he was here on Earth oh Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils she'll be there doing it oh a mighty bride in the last day we're looking for it to happen tonight isn't that right oh one more point before we close it took work it took work to get back what they had lost David smoked them from Twilight of the evening of that day to the evening of the very next day they fought for a full 24 hours period they had to fight it took work to get it back it wasn't easy but what David had was a word from the Lord and that is what he held on to in the midst of the clanging Shields and the swords in the midst of the burning fires he had a promise from God he had already conquered on his knees when God told him pursue and just like the Lamb of God conquered on his knees and said not my will but thy will be done in the midst of the battle there was a word from the Lord that word will endure it will endure your trial it
