I want to welcome also again brother Green, brother Josh, brother Shem. Praise the Lord. Welcome the backyard with us today. And I want to give a testimony here from Nigeria. Sister uh Nikki Yukiri while watching brother Paul and Jacob preach she was instantly healed of joint pains as she was praying during the service. Sing with me how great is our God. All we've seen, how great, how great. Bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And truly, we can testify how great is our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just be have you before you have your seats, I'd like to take a verse from the Gospel according to St. John 1 and verse 14. And it reads like this. And the word was made flesh &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. and we beheld his glory and the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; It is my privilege and honor to just say a few words before the speaker come. At first I was wondering who would come and uh but now I know brother Isaac. Amen. Um, it's the third time I've been asked to just greet you. And so now I'm fully identified with the Headstone Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; You see, there was a time we didn't know each other, &gt;&gt; but you know, it can go way way beyond that. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Job was asked the question, "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?" &gt;&gt; Job couldn't answer that. But you know all of us could answer that question tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we are identified with a prophet &gt;&gt; who give us the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe uh one of the brothers said you know uh brother Norris said you see he said Moses said in the beginning God created and he said John said in the beginning was the word and the word he said but our prophet took us before the beginning &gt;&gt; when we were in the very mind of God &gt;&gt; so our identification is not a present tense identification I was introduced as brother Andrew for long but said one day I realized He was not the son of Charles and Elraham. &gt;&gt; Who was he? He was the son of God. Amen. He was in the mind of God. So you and I we are identified with God. &gt;&gt; In fact when John writes here in and the word was made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is really God who was the word was made flesh. &gt;&gt; God identified in himself with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. God identified. &gt;&gt; The definition of identified is to associate someone. Associate someone or something closely with &gt;&gt; amen. So it's just not an association but is a close link. Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, it goes on to say regarding as having strong links with &gt;&gt; not just links at strong links. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our links with God is strong links. &gt;&gt; Is that genetic link? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God was willing to be identified with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now we ought to be willing to be identified with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not just here to listening. Lord, you're not a spectator. &gt;&gt; You just didn't come to visit. &gt;&gt; You come to be identified with. And we ought not to be ashamed to be identified with this message. &gt;&gt; You ought not to be ashamed to be identified with brother Brad. &gt;&gt; You know Noah when he came he came with a very unscientific message &gt;&gt; and as Bam said it was a scientific age &gt;&gt; but he came with an unscientific message. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he so believed, he was so identified with his message &gt;&gt; that he preached it for 120 years. &gt;&gt; He didn't get he didn't question himself. He didn't find it was boring. He didn't find it again next message. He hold on to the same message for 120 years. &gt;&gt; Saying the same thing every service. I am sure if we preach the same service twice and you know you coming at your time half of coming because we too scientific. &gt;&gt; I don't hear that already. &gt;&gt; But the word is the same. You know there's going to be a rapture. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a bride. &gt;&gt; There's going to be an another identified masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Amen. I another masterpiece is going to come on the making. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was God among us. Amen. &gt;&gt; There going to come a time when you would be so identified with God that people will mistake you for God. &gt;&gt; You see all your afraid to be identified with that. You ought to be willing to accept the I could give you all the quotes I go but I'm not I don't want to take brother Isaac time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear what the prophet said in identified masterpiece. Perhaps you could believe it to accepted identify with it then. Right. &gt;&gt; And there's nothing to read wrong to read quotes or know &gt;&gt; you ashamed to be identified with quotes. That's your food. &gt;&gt; That's spiritual food. Int. The more you eat it, the more you become like it. You begin to talk like it. You begin to walk like it. You begin to you become the word because you're feeding on it all. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The prophet said, just think that a person can be so yielded until God identified himself in there &gt;&gt; in that body. He became him and God became one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to believe that the bride, the sculptor is doing such a good job on you &gt;&gt; that one day you will look back at the masterpiece &gt;&gt; and say, "Speak. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what the prophet our prophet said. my prophet. If that is not your prophet, he's my prophet. Right? &gt;&gt; Listen, people follow Messi and Mbappe and whoever Yamaro, Tamaro, whoever it is come and they mad over them. Why can't I be mad for this message? They call them fans as fanatics and they fanatical for if I ask some of you who is plea half all you know who is ple not so but one time he was fanatical about ple them will come and gone &gt;&gt; but there are people the brother is immortal [Applause] &gt;&gt; oh my goodness This is a bad atmosphere and make you feel preacher now. Hear what the prophet say. Nearly for 2,000 years, God has been trying to cut him a masterpiece bride &gt;&gt; called a church. &gt;&gt; So God is cutting out, God is making this masterpiece bride. &gt;&gt; And if God start on a project, his project will never fail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It will never fail. It could never be defeated. &gt;&gt; It's going to be established. &gt;&gt; As certain as when he said, "Let there be light." You see, God is not like man. When God said something, God is identified with that. &gt;&gt; So it has to happen, he will go every step of the way &gt;&gt; to make sure. If he said it, it has to happen. &gt;&gt; And that is why God choose special men called prophets, you know, &gt;&gt; because they had something in them that connect them to God. &gt;&gt; Look, God tell a man, a virgin shall conceive. That is the most unscientific, nonbiological, physiologically, and all kind of logic that can happen. &gt;&gt; But God said, &gt;&gt; "I will give you a sign, and a virgin shall conceive. That's why when the brother preached on revelation that let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready. That has to happen. &gt;&gt; And and may I inform you if you are part of that it means that inside of you there is an identification in you that connects you to that scripture &gt;&gt; and you can run but you can't hide. You can go where you want, but he's going to bring you because you have to complete that scripture. [Music] &gt;&gt; Do you know our prophet tried to take his life twice? &gt;&gt; But he had to fulfill Revelation 10:7. So it didn't matter what kind of gun he had, what kind of poison or what kind of rope he tried or whatever he tried, what kind of high voltage he touched, nothing could take him because he had to fulfill Revelation 10:7. And you are identified with words that you alone can can fulfill. &gt;&gt; There's a close link. There's a bond, an association with you. I am associated with brother Hashem. So when brother talk about perfect love that is the embodiment of me and you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are you afraid to say you are perfect love? &gt;&gt; You may not reach there but you will get there. &gt;&gt; One day you will see a raging bull and you all that love would overwhelm you. &gt;&gt; It might start in your home. It might be your husband. You had to tame him. Why you want to tame regent bull? You yourself is a regent bull. I will tame you. Listen, perfect love has to become operational, &gt;&gt; functional and I am identified with that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when I get on the other side, I will not be surprised because I've been living that. &gt;&gt; You are living forgiveness. You are living humility. You are living joy. Listen, it's more than just a word. You know these things going to be a part of your life, &gt;&gt; the essence of your life. &gt;&gt; It's just genetic makeup. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's be identified with this message. Uh we were downstairs fellowshipping and our brother asked our brother Thompson asked for the the little pin with the cloud. You know why? He wants to be identified with the cloud. &gt;&gt; Some people disassociate with the cloud. &gt;&gt; Listen that is our our headship is here. &gt;&gt; It's not just a picture scientific. Listen, Noah had an unscientific message, but we have a message that may be unscientific, but is scientifically proven. &gt;&gt; Moses didn't have no picture of no burning bush fire, you know. But you have a picture. What Moses didn't have, you have it. &gt;&gt; Am I talking to believers tonight? We have a picture of what the Lord Jeso look like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Be be not ashamed. Brother says, as an American, I am a I am identified with their glory and their shame. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's not bring shame to the message, but let us bring glory and honor to the message by the life that we live, the way we conduct ourselves and our behavior that tells us we come from God and I'm going back to God because that is our identification. May God bless our glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Give the Lord praise. Give the Lord praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just praise him. Just praise him. Thank you, Jesus.

You appreciate the worship. You appreciate the singing. You appreciate the greeting from the furong. You appreciate the service this afternoon. You appreciate the service this morning, the service last night, the service yesterday afternoon. Can we give the Lord a shout of praise? Amen. While you're standing, I'd like us to go straight to the word. It's the third service of the evening or the day as it were. But God is not finished yet. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh brother Furong started to preach my thought tonight. &gt;&gt; So we are in the same spirit &gt;&gt; connected to the same source &gt;&gt; fighting the same devil. &gt;&gt; And I believe tonight the devil is in trouble. &gt;&gt; I believe we're going to give the devil a punch tonight. &gt;&gt; And tonight is dedicated to the young people. &gt;&gt; So we are we know that we're in a new generation. We know we're in a new season. and the devil is afraid of you. And we're going to get into that tonight by the grace of God. So, uh, let's read from Romans 8, familiar scripture, and Judges 16 tonight. Romans 8 and reading from verse 28. And we know that all things work together for good &gt;&gt; to them that love God, &gt;&gt; to them who are be called according to his purpose. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called them, he also justified. And whom he justified them, he also glorified. Shall we go to Judges chapter 16 and we're going to read from verse 21. But the Philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with fetterss of brass and he did grind in the prison house. I remember the Brandon was preaching on this. He said, "This is one of the most pitiful sights &gt;&gt; in the whole of this Bible." Verse 22, "How be it, the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven." &gt;&gt; Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Deeon their God. Could you imagine that the enemy is gathered together to offer a great sacrifice? Let's read. And to rejoice. So in the camp of the enemy there's rejoicing &gt;&gt; for they said our God lowercase G had delivered Samson our enemy into our hand &gt;&gt; and when the people saw him these are the Philistines they praised their God. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine? &gt;&gt; They actually having their own service &gt;&gt; and they having a celebration. &gt;&gt; They praised their God for they said our God had delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us. And it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they said, "Call for Samson that he may make us sport." &gt;&gt; And they called for Samson out of the prison house. And he made them sport. So before Samson went to the pillars, Samson had to make sport. Sometime we don't spend time understanding what they put Samson through. It's one thing to take out his eyes. It's another thing to have the anointed of God do an entertainment round for you. And that's what the enemy wants to do with our young people. &gt;&gt; Embarrass them, &gt;&gt; humiliate them, torment them, make you run around in circles, put you in the club, put you in drugs, put you out there to make sport. &gt;&gt; That he may make sport. And they called for Samson out of the of the prison house, and he made them sport, and they set him between the pillars. And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standed that I may lean upon them. Even in that moment, he didn't even indicate what's about to happen. He said, "Just put me there. I just want to lean on them." &gt;&gt; Now, the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And we know these are demonic forces. &gt;&gt; But nothing is out of chance. Nothing is out of ket. They were all there. And there were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women that beheld while Samson made sport. And Samson called unto the Lord, and said, "Oh Lord God, remember me. &gt;&gt; I pray thee &gt;&gt; and strengthen me. I pray thee only this once, oh God, that I may at once be at once avenge of the Philistines for my two eyes." Can we bow our heads for a short prayer? Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word. We thank you for the convention. We thank you for the singing and for the worship and for the preaching and Lord for this service tonight that we want to dedicate to the young people, Father, that something would be said that will touch the heart of someone. Lord, I believe that there are some Samson in the building tonight, Lord, because Samson got himself into some trouble. He got himself into some problems. He was born with a purpose and somewhere along the journey, he lost sight of the purpose. But Lord, you didn't abandon Samson. And you're not going to abandon not one of our young people. You're not going to abandon not one of us, Father. So Lord, may you speak through to through your word tonight. May you touch each one, Lord. If there's someone backsliding in our midst, Father, may they be delivered tonight. Lord, is the third service. So many of us in our bodies are weary, but you are our strength tonight. You are our peace tonight. You are our reward tonight. And Lord, you saw this whole meeting before we even gathered here. So may you give us strength Lord for this short message tonight to encourage your people. Take me out of the way and speak to our hearts in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Certainly a great privilege to be here. I want to greet one and all in the precious name of Jesus Christ and uh certainly happy to be identified with each one that's here and those that are connected online. I certainly want to salute all the ministers that are present. Uh we appreciate all the ministers that have come from near and from far local and international. Certainly want to salute all the ministers who have greeted and those who have spoken as well as those that are yet to come. We love you. We appreciate you. I did not choose to be here tonight. I always say I'm a spare tire. Uh but the host pastor put me to speak. So I'm reporting for duty and I know there are many here that are far more qualified than I am to speak. But by the grace of God, we will endeavor to do what God wants us to do tonight. &gt;&gt; I have a short title tonight. The purpose of God can never be defeated. &gt;&gt; And brother Andrew actually started to preach on this. Hallelujah. The purpose of God can never be defeated. And you got to understand that there's a purpose for your life and there's nothing that's going to stop it. And once that purpose comes from God, the devil doesn't have enough devils. There aren't enough demons. There's not enough sickness. There's not enough depression. There's not enough drugs. There's not enough false doctrine. There's nothing could stop the purpose of God. Once God put something on your life, the devil is in trouble and he knows it. He going to try to distract you. He's going to try to keep you down. But God is faithful. Can the church say amen in the message, the evening messenger, I'm just laying a foundation. I'm not going to be long with you tonight, but just to lay a foundation. He said, "Notice, when the message is rejected and the messenger seems to be defeated, that's when God steps on the scene because God is the one who put the plan in place. He is the one who chose you. You didn't choose him. He is the one who called you. You didn't call him. You are not here because you accepted an invitation. You are here because God called you. You didn't have a choice to respond." Brother Brandham said, "The message will find itself in the hands of the predestinated." You couldn't even find the message. The message found you. You didn't choose the message. The message chose you. You didn't choose your house. God put you in your house for a reason. Whether it was a good house, a bad house, it doesn't matter because God is a God of purpose. That purpose had to be accomplished. If you were born in Nigeria, it's for a purpose. Born in Trinidad, it's for a purpose. Born in Germany, it's for a purpose. Born in South Africa, born for a purpose. And God by design, his purpose could never be defeated. God has never lost one. Not yet. His track record is unbeatable. He is the undefeated champion. And he said, "Because I live, you are going to live also." He said, "The same works I do, you are going to do also." Is there anybody in the house tonight who is ready to take their two hands? We're going to preach about Samson a little bit. Anybody sleeping? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Because Samson is an interesting character. &gt;&gt; We spend time on the once more Lord part. But Samson, even when Samson was in trouble, he was beating the devil left, right, and center. Oh, you don't hear me this evening. I don't care where the devil put you. I don't care what you lost. I don't care what's gone wrong. Samson was tied up. Do you know &gt;&gt; that the brothers in Judah, 3,000 of them &gt;&gt; when they looked at the Philistines, they came to find Samson. I'm ahead of my message already. They said, "Samson, the Philistines want you." He said, "Promise to not kill me." He said, "We're not going to kill you." And they tied up Samson. &gt;&gt; Samson was already given trouble, &gt;&gt; but there was a seed of predestination. There was a purpose upon his life. He didn't call himself Oh, you don't hear me this evening. He didn't choose himself. He didn't put his name on the book. He didn't write his name there. He was not the angel that went to his parents' house. But because an angel went to his parents' house, there was no devil that could stop him. Oh, you don't hear me this evening. And the Bible said that the spirit of the Lord came upon Samson. If the spirit of the Lord ever come upon you, all your tiredness will leave. All of your depression will leave. Your sickness is trembling because the spirit of the Lord is able to break cancer, break leukemia, break Oh, you don't hear me tonight. Hallelujah. You have to forgive me. But Andrew started it. He said, "We are fanatics about this thing. Don't mess with me and my message. This message is too powerful. There's power in this message. There's an anointing in this message. It's a vindicated message. There's nothing you could tell me. Samson was backsliden, but the spirit of the Lord came upon him because it was a purpose upon his life. And listen, it was not just for Samson's sake. You know, it was the purpose God was fighting for. You don't hear me tonight. God was looking beyond Samson's mistake because the purpose was bigger than his mistake. The purpose was bigger than his sin. The purpose was bigger than Delilah. The purpose was bigger than the harlot. The purpose was bigger. Your purpose is your protection. Your purpose is what will keep you. Your purpose brought you here tonight. Your purpose woke you up this morning. Somebody give God a shout of praise. [Applause] There is nothing more powerful than a man with a purpose. There is nothing more dangerous than a woman with a purpose. You are born with a purpose. You are not picking up a purpose. You may be seated for a minute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, Samson was the last judge. God in his plan always wanted a king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The era of the judges was a temporary transitional government. From Joshua entering the land &gt;&gt; to King David being anointed &gt;&gt; read the Bible &gt;&gt; in there. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that every judge &gt;&gt; was a response to a cry of the people. &gt;&gt; So the people would cry &gt;&gt; because they fell in sin &gt;&gt; and God would send them into oppression &gt;&gt; to discipline them. And after a while they would cry and God would respond. &gt;&gt; It was a response to a situation. &gt;&gt; And but the and the Bible said every judge after every judge it got worse. &gt;&gt; So by the time Samson was on the earth, it was the worst time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was so bad. The Bible says you have to read what's there and what's not there. There is no evidence that the people cried. They cried before Jeffa. They cried before Gideon. They cried before Anne. They cried before all the other judges. &gt;&gt; And as a result of the cry of the people, just like when Moses, God said, "I've heard the cries of my people and have come down." &gt;&gt; The age was so wicked, the people stopped even crying. And they accepted for 40 years the Philistines as the oppressors until God said my purpose. I'm not even going to wait for them to cry. I'm going to go down myself. And the Bible said an angel of the Lord found a barren woman and said they're going to have a child and that child will begin the deliverance from the Philistines. I'm not even waiting for them to pray. I'm not waiting for them to cry. I am doing it myself because my purpose can never be defeated. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, mama. Your son is going to be delivered. Don't worry, papa. Your son is going to be delivered. Don't worry, grandma. Your son is coming back. Give the Lord a shout of praise. This is an encouragement to the parents &gt;&gt; because sometimes we see young people backslide and we look at the parents &gt;&gt; as if the parents messed up. &gt;&gt; What was Samson's excuse? Do you understand how Samson even came &gt;&gt; in Judges 13? &gt;&gt; And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines 40 years. &gt;&gt; This is the longest period of bondage in the era of the judges. &gt;&gt; 40 years. And nobody cried. &gt;&gt; And there was a certain man of Zora &gt;&gt; of the family of the Danites. &gt;&gt; It was so bad. God went to the tribe of Dan. If you go to Revelation 7, you cannot even find the tribe there because that tribe did not possess their inheritance and they tried to possess what was not theirs. &gt;&gt; They do what they want to do. Come to church when they want to come to church. Behave how they want to behave. But God went in that house and found a family and said, "I'm going to visit through this family a deliverer to begin the deliverance of the Philistines. Don't tell me my God can't do anything. He is the God of the impossible. I don't care where your son is tonight. I don't care what your daughter is wearing tonight. I don't care what you're doing tonight. We serve the God of the impossible. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. [Music] You may be seated. &gt;&gt; And my Bible tells me Judges 13 and verse three, and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman, &gt;&gt; and said unto her, Behold, now thou art barren, and beest not, but thou shalt conceive &gt;&gt; and bear a son. &gt;&gt; Now therefore, beware, &gt;&gt; I pray thee. Drink not wine, nor strong drink, &gt;&gt; and eat not any unclean thing. &gt;&gt; For lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son, &gt;&gt; and no razor shall come on his head. &gt;&gt; For the child shall be a Nazerite. Now when number six defines Nazarite, &gt;&gt; it was optional. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You could choose to be a Nazarite. You could choose to take the Nazarite vow for a season. But here something is born or even before he is born he has been defined as a Nazerite from birth. Meaning his birth was already planned. His Nazarite vow was selected before you don't even hear me this evening. Your calling was before you got here. Your predestination is before you got here. God already see you delivered. He already see you with the Holy Ghost. He already see you break every chain, every shackle that's been holding you back. It's already broken. &gt;&gt; His mother is told &gt;&gt; he shall begin, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; to deliver Israel &gt;&gt; out of the hand of the Philistines. Samson's ministry was never to destroy them. &gt;&gt; It was to begin. &gt;&gt; God knew David was coming. &gt;&gt; God knew who was coming after. &gt;&gt; But Samson ministry was to begin the deliverance. And I believe that tonight will be a beginning &gt;&gt; of deliverance for somebody in the house tonight. I believe tonight is an anchor point for some wayward daughter, some wayward son who's been holding on for dear life. May this be your beginning of your deliverance. Can the church give the Lord a shout of praise? &gt;&gt; I want to skip a few verses cuz I want to help the parents &gt;&gt; before we get to the young people. The angel spoke to the woman. We don't have her name. &gt;&gt; Husband wasn't there at the time. &gt;&gt; He comes home &gt;&gt; and she tells him the testimony &gt;&gt; and he was like, "What is this?" &gt;&gt; A man of God came unto me &gt;&gt; and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of the God. Very terrible. &gt;&gt; But I asked him not whence he was, neither told me his name. But he said unto me, "Behold, thou shalt conceive." She gives what the decree was, the positioning, what the requirement was. &gt;&gt; Then Monoah and you could see these are spiritual people. &gt;&gt; Monoah intreated the Lord and said, "Oh my Lord, &gt;&gt; let the man of God, which doubt did I send come again unto us. &gt;&gt; I want a witness. I want to experience it for myself. I was out at work and you visit my wife, but oh God, I don't want to be out of the picture. I want to know what I'm supposed to do. I want to know what I'm supposed to be expecting. I don't want to miss this blessing because we have been under the pressure of the Philistine for 40 years. And if what she is telling me is because it's been a long time we've been under bondage. But if you're telling me we about to be free, tell me we about to be free. You don't hear me tonight. Hallelujah. And the Bible says, "And God hearkened &gt;&gt; to the voice of Monoah." &gt;&gt; So I want you to appreciate God heard this. And God said, "If that's your request, this is so important to me. &gt;&gt; Even though I told your wife, I'll come down again because this son called Samson. &gt;&gt; This thing has got to work. &gt;&gt; I'm not getting a replacement." Oh, you don't hear me tonight. &gt;&gt; This thing has got to work. I've chosen him for this purpose. And as many times as I need to come, I will come to reinforce the message that I chose you for a purpose. If I need to tell you this Sunday, I'll say it. Tell you on Wednesday, I say it. Tell you on Friday, I say it. Tell you next Sunday, I say it. But you are going to be in the rapture. I say it today. I say it on Wednesday. Oh, come on now. Give the Lord a shout of praise. I'm not going to be too long. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But over the same to keep riding it. &gt;&gt; It's the third service. Brother, &gt;&gt; I heard brother Raymond said this morning, he don't want to get too anointed &gt;&gt; because if you get too anointed, we'll have you'll be here all night long. &gt;&gt; You know, one day there'll be a service we don't want to leave. &gt;&gt; You'll forget about your bills, forget about the traffic, forget about the state of emergency, forget about the government, forget about your problems because you're blending from time into eternity. The enemy wants to keep you out of your purpose. But I want to complete, you may be seated just for a few minutes. I want to paint a picture &gt;&gt; because it grieves all of us when our young people get into trouble. &gt;&gt; But here are parents who not only heard from God. &gt;&gt; Later in that chapter, Monoah, the angel came and Monoah said, "Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child? So Monoah understood the purpose so much. He said how to raise him. &gt;&gt; What should I tell him in the morning? &gt;&gt; How should should we send him to this school or that school? &gt;&gt; How do we tell him how to choose his friends? &gt;&gt; What do we tell him about his environment, &gt;&gt; about the economy, about Tik Tok, about Facebook, about Instagram, about social media? What how should we order this child? Because we want to get it right. And I say to you young people here, your parents, they want to get it right. &gt;&gt; Monoah was doing everything he could do by having access to an angel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Young people say, "Well, my parents don't understand and they don't know what I'm going through." &gt;&gt; As if they were born yesterday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The important thing here that I see is the intent, the objective. Monoah wanted to get it right. &gt;&gt; You may not understand everything your father does or your mother does, but thank God if you're in a home that grew up in this message, your parents are trying to get it right. Amen. This helped me understand the pain that parents feel &gt;&gt; because you know in school there are some students the teachers write most likely to succeed &gt;&gt; and there are those Lord help them &gt;&gt; because Lord if you don't help them they will never amount to anything. Samson was most likely to succeed. &gt;&gt; Do you know in the Bible there are only five times that an angel came to announce a birth. Wow. &gt;&gt; Angels came to deal with the birth of Ishmael. An angel came an angel angel came to say, "Abraham, you're going to have a son, Isaac." &gt;&gt; Angel came to Mary to announce the birth. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; And for John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; And the only other person that an angel came to announce a birth was Samson. &gt;&gt; And when you look at Samson's life, by the end of chapter 13, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Okay, &gt;&gt; I'll skip a few cuz we do have the full time here. But I just want to say the parents, they offered a sacrifice. They worshiped as a family to thank God for the revelation, &gt;&gt; the mystery of what was about to happen in this child called Samson. If you had asked the parents, "What you think how he's going to grow up and and will he get in trouble and will he be in church all the time?" They would have said, "Yes, an angel told me. They told me how to raise the child. We offered a sacrifice." &gt;&gt; They were even concerned. They said, "We saw God. &gt;&gt; We'll die." And the wife was spiritual. God help us. If you have a spiritual wife, you should be worshiping. The wife said, "If God was going to kill us, he to do it already." &gt;&gt; He accepted the sacrifice. He accepted the worship. We are all right. This thing is too important for God. &gt;&gt; Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? The end of chapter 13 says, "And a woman bear a son and call his name Samson, and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him, &gt;&gt; and the spirit of the Lord began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zora and Estrol." &gt;&gt; So the end of chapter 13 is what I would call Samson at his high point. &gt;&gt; This is young people who grew up in the message. They haven't gone to university. Maybe they haven't gone out and done this that that that and and they're like, "My God, it's so good." &gt;&gt; Judges 14 and verse one. I want you to remember that this family was located in Zora. The physical location matters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whenever there's a word, a name, a description, a place in scripture, it's important. Brother Yadel said God is in numerology. He's very specific. They were in Zoro. And the Bible said, "And Samson in verse one of chapter 14 went down to Timnat." &gt;&gt; You see Timnat. &gt;&gt; That is the beginning of trouble. &gt;&gt; Because it was in Timnut. He saw a woman in Timnat. If he had stayed by the George Enzora. Yes, &gt;&gt; he would have not seen the woman &gt;&gt; of Timnut. &gt;&gt; And Samson went down to Timnut and saw a woman. Where? What are you doing in Timnut, brother? [Applause] &gt;&gt; The tribe of Dan have no business being in Timnat. &gt;&gt; What are you doing out of church on a Sunday? Come on, somebody help me preach back to me this morning. What are you doing in the club? What are you doing in shady places? Because you will only get in trouble in shady places. &gt;&gt; What are you doing on that website called Timnat? Oh, you don't hear me, don't? &gt;&gt; It's a h youth service tonight. &gt;&gt; How many friends do you have who live in Timnat? [Applause] saw a woman in Timnat of the daughters of the Philistines. And this becomes important because to this point, this is where it begins to show that Samson was now testing the edges of grace. &gt;&gt; And I want to share something because all of Samson's encounters with the spirit was actually him in trouble and God still blessing him. And Samson took for granted &gt;&gt; the grace of God. &gt;&gt; So we talk about the spirit of the Lord coming upon Samson. But God wasn't pleased with Samson. It is because of the purpose on his life. God sent the spirit upon him. &gt;&gt; Because the move from Zora to Timnath was one step away from purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We talk a lot about Delilah. Delilah was the third encounter. The woman in Timoth was the first. &gt;&gt; The harlot was the second. Delilah was the third. And each was in a different physical location that was deeper in Philistine territory. Read the Bible. &gt;&gt; The woman in Timnath and what I'm preaching on is when you go to the edge &gt;&gt; because what this was was just attraction. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he loved Elila. &gt;&gt; This woman, it was just a visual thing, you know. Can I preach? &gt;&gt; Coming for the brothers here tonight. Coming for the sisters here tonight. Coming for the young people here tonight because God is going to deliver you. There's a purpose on your life that will not be defeated. We will expose the devil any place any time under any condition. &gt;&gt; And Samson, he came up and told his father and his mother. Who would have heard from the angel? &gt;&gt; Amen. and said, "I have seen a woman in Timnat of the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore, get her for me to wife." &gt;&gt; Then his father and mother said unto him what the prophet said, "Under no circumstance [Applause] &gt;&gt; should a believer marry an unbeliever." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Can we still preach that? &gt;&gt; Can we still say that? Is that not the word? You see this buffet style message? &gt;&gt; I'm on a vegan diet. Listen, you can't be vegan or gluten-free in the message. &gt;&gt; We taking everything. &gt;&gt; You have to eat everything. &gt;&gt; We have to take because it's to protect us. This is what started the problem in Samson's life. He desired to marry a woman from Timnat. Had that desire not been there, he would have never reached as far as Delila. Timnat is the text message you should not send. Oh God, help me tonight. &gt;&gt; The phone call you should not make. The response, oh, you don't hear me. Oh God, help me to preach tonight. &gt;&gt; The casual conversation that pushes the edge. &gt;&gt; There's nothing physical, is it? But you're saying things you shouldn't say. &gt;&gt; The desires are there that should not be there. But tonight, we are exposing Timnot and everything that lives in Timna. Because if it's a Philistine, you were raised up to be the beginning of the destruction of every Philistine. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; I'm trying to not be too long with you, but I hope this is helping somebody. But we are here to expose. We are not ignorant of Satan's devices. We will expose him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And his father and his mother said unto him, "Is there never a woman among the daughters of the of thy brethren or among all light people? Is there nobody in your church or any of the message churches? &gt;&gt; What's your excuse? &gt;&gt; Do I need to identify the physical location of every message church? What's your reason for going to the world? &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't hear me tonight. Can we preach a message? [Applause] &gt;&gt; And that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines. &gt;&gt; And Samson said unto his father, "Get her for me, for she pleased me well." And &gt;&gt; so the problem escalates though when his identity becomes compromised. And I want to skip because I'm all off of my notes. I don't even know where my notes are anymore. But somebody's pulling and I hope it's helping somebody tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We know Samson and the riddle. We're going to skip it. But he said that if you get the riddle, &gt;&gt; then I'm going to give you certain things. &gt;&gt; And the woman, this first woman who became his wife terrorized his life. &gt;&gt; You don't love me. Do you really love me? Because if you &gt;&gt; I know you're a Christian, but but there's something about me that you do love, right? Is it at least like because like and love is different. You could like me. &gt;&gt; She wore him down until he gave the answer to the riddle. &gt;&gt; And when they presented the answer, he was so angry. &gt;&gt; He killed 30 Philistines. Not out of purpose, &gt;&gt; but out of anger. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; To pay the debt for gambling &gt;&gt; because in Timna there's also gambling. Oh, you don't hear me tonight. &gt;&gt; Can we preach? &gt;&gt; This is in the same Bible we read, right? &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; look at the pressure that they put on the wife. And it came to pass on the seventh day, this is when they supposed to answer the riddle, that they said unto Samson's wife, entice thy husband that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire. &gt;&gt; So under duress and threat, &gt;&gt; the other demonic Philistines put pressure on this Philistine wife to terrorize a servant of God with a purpose in his life to say, "We if you don't get the answer, we kill you." [Music] And verse 16, and Samson's wife wept before him &gt;&gt; and said, "Thou dost but hate me." &gt;&gt; Why you Why you doing this? Find any brother who have to break up with a worldly relationship. &gt;&gt; If you think break up in isolation is difficult, imagine breaking up with a Philistine. &gt;&gt; We dealing with some serious stuff here now. Because everybody looks like church on a Sunday and a Wednesday and on Monday and on a Tuesday and on a Thursday and a Friday is war &gt;&gt; because the devil is out to get you. &gt;&gt; The attack here was sponsored by the threat of killing, you know. So this woman was going after Samson because she knew if she didn't achieve the purpose she was going to get killed. &gt;&gt; You have to understand that the attacks on your life are being sponsored, financed by the enemy. Look at Delilah. The Bible said the five lords of the Philistines put up money to pay her to get Samson to give him a secret. &gt;&gt; It is sponsored terrorism. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The devil wants to destroy you. &gt;&gt; In the case of the wife, it was the threat of we kill you. In the case of the we have money for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we go on? &gt;&gt; I promise you not be too long, but this thing starting to eat good &gt;&gt; because too many of us don't read our Bibles. &gt;&gt; Because the answer to everything we need is in the Bible and in the message of the hour &gt;&gt; to deal with any threat, to any obstacle, to any situation that you're facing is in the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By verse seven, and she wept before him the seven days. You imagine your wife crying for seven days. &gt;&gt; It's not one day. It's not like a tears. And he gave seven days. She came crying. With breakfast came tears. With lunch there were tears. With dinner more tears. &gt;&gt; Samson, you don't love me. &gt;&gt; Maybe the first day he could have handled it. By day two, the tears were longer. By day three, she run out of tears &gt;&gt; to show her the devil is not going to give up. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass on the seventh day that he told her because she lay saw on him, it wore him down. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to use the word nag here, but it wore him down. and she told a riddle to her children of her people and the story goes they came and tell him and then he killed 30 Philistines. &gt;&gt; So there's a parallel here part purpose but driven by the anger of this debt he now needs to pay &gt;&gt; because he lost this gamble because his wife exposed him. And the anger builds until we know Samson do a few things. I mean Samson was really like it's when I was studying this I told my wife it's almost difficult to preach about Samson because the spirit is anointing him but Samson is trouble Samson get foxes. You know what is to get a fox? Not one, two, tie them together, put a fire, set [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; 300 foxes, &gt;&gt; but George, not one fox, no. 300 foxes &gt;&gt; and took fire and turned tail to tail and put a fire brand. Now this is the verse I want to get here that verse six of chapter 15. And the Philistines said, "Who had done this to show you how Samson had lost his identity?" And they answered, "Samson, not of the tribe of Dan, not of Israel, &gt;&gt; not a judge, not a son of God, not an enemy." They say, "The son-in-law &gt;&gt; of the Tim Knight." In other words, his identity was already compromised. They didn't even know he went to church. &gt;&gt; You hear what I said? His identification was so compromised that when they asked who did this, brother George, they didn't say is this Israelite who married this girl? Is this son of Dan who married? This says the son-in-law of a Timite. &gt;&gt; Samson had lost himself. Now the prayer remember me &gt;&gt; starts to connect the dots &gt;&gt; because Samson knew he was so far gone. His identity was compromised and he hadn't even met Delilah yet. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Too many of us in the message are living too close &gt;&gt; to the edge. &gt;&gt; Backsliding is not a today for tomorrow thing. &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to find a place to land. So in response to what Samson did with the foxes and when they identified was the son of the son-in-law of the Timite is when they actually killed his wife. That's what the Bible says. And Samson response was he smoed them hip and tie. &gt;&gt; So what we see here is a pattern of enrage, upset, anger, and frustration because Samson was lost. He was in trouble. &gt;&gt; And at this point, the men of Judah, the Bible said, they know what to do with Samson. The Philistines approached them, and 3,000 men of Judah went to Samson. No doubt that the Philistines are rulers over us. Now, I want us to appreciate every judge before Samson had an army. Samson had no army. &gt;&gt; In fact, the 3,000 men who came to lock him up, they actually came to lock him up. Samson's a champion and they want no identification with Samson. And this is what led to that great fight where they tied up Samson and say, "We'll hand you to the Philistines." And even though Samson was messed up, and this is here is part an encouragement, but it's also a warning to us because brother Brandham said, "Bride skies are not a sign of God's approval. &gt;&gt; God will deliver you and bless you, and he's waiting you to come out of the filth that you're in. &gt;&gt; He couldn't let this son suffer. &gt;&gt; A thousand men came to kill him, but an angel already came down. God already spoke upon his life. God already planned what his purpose was." So the Bible said the spirit of the Lord came upon Samson and Samson looked around. He had no sword. He had no shield. He had no army. This was a one-man army. The spirit of the Lord connected with the purpose in his soul. Overlooked the failures of his life. And he looked and found a jawbone. And the Bible said he started to swing. And brother Brandham said if that jawbone had connected with the helmet, it should have broken. But the spirit of the Lord was upon Samson. And Samson went to swinging brother. He swung once and one went down. And he felt better about himself. He swung again and by the time he was done a thousand Philistines were dead. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? Because the spirit of the Lord came upon him. And you know what I love about Samson? The Bible said Samson threw away the jawbone. &gt;&gt; Because he knew there was no power in the jawbone. &gt;&gt; If it was you, you polish the jawbone. Put the jawbone in a mant. &gt;&gt; I mean be honest. &gt;&gt; Because we love to hold on to things. &gt;&gt; Samson knew there was nothing in the jawbone. You know when the spirit of the Lord come upon him, he could use a jawbone. He could use a toothpick, he could use a spoon. It didn't matter what it was. Samson walk out throw away the jawbone. Oh, you don't hear me this evening because God was with Samson. The purpose on in him. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be too much longer with you. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All this was timid. But then Samson went worse. And this is the trouble with us. Unless the grace of God arrests us and we choose to repent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Samson was well brought up. &gt;&gt; He knew the word. &gt;&gt; His parents would have done all they could do. And he instead of going back home and to do his purpose, he goes into Gaza &gt;&gt; and that's where he found the hallot. He hasn't met Delilah yet. &gt;&gt; And the Philistines plot to kill him. And this is when they try to Samson got out in the night. They were waiting in the morning and they locked the gate. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine? &gt;&gt; Samson in trouble. Samson is trouble. &gt;&gt; Comes out of a worse situation than the previous one. &gt;&gt; Sees the gate &gt;&gt; and God says because of the purpose on your life, the spirit come upon Samson again. and something lift up the gate and the pose and the pillar. He said you can't lock me up. I'm in trouble but you cannot lock me up because the purpose in me is bigger than oh you don't hear me tonight. And that's why I say to you Johnny Crow, you can fly south because the purpose in you will set you free. You can go free anytime you want to go free. [Music] &gt;&gt; We know the story. It's not a complicated message tonight. It's to help somebody. &gt;&gt; Come on. [Music] So it went from he liked the woman in Timnat &gt;&gt; to just a physical encounter in Gaza that got them in trouble and then Delilah the Bible said he loved it shifted now &gt;&gt; to fall in love &gt;&gt; but I love him. I love her. We're in love. We're in love. You don't know. Nobody in church loves me like &gt;&gt; I've never felt that kind of love in church. &gt;&gt; This is what the church should have. And you hear all these arguments from the young people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The sisters in our church never look at me. The brothers in church never look at me. &gt;&gt; But she loves me and I love her. &gt;&gt; And the devil is in there. &gt;&gt; Because you're under a Nazerite vow. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we know the story. This is this is familiar story to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Elila is paid by the five lords of the Philistines. &gt;&gt; And Samson is creative if it's one thing. He said, "If you tie me here up here and if you tie me with new ropes and until the Bible said, and I want to find a verse, &gt;&gt; we have the new ropes." She accuse him of lying. Imagine the Philistines bringing up a lying accusation. A demon telling you like, "You're lying. Tell me this." Could you imagine when you really spend time in the scriptures? So this is a this should encourage it's a paradox. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Delilah said in this is this is chapter 16:15. And she said unto him, how can thou say I love thee &gt;&gt; when thine heart is not with me? &gt;&gt; When I tell you lyrics, &gt;&gt; wordsmith craft. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sam learned this a long time ago. Thou has mocked me these three times and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lith. &gt;&gt; Do you know there's a great strength that greater is he that's in you that he that's in the word. There's a strength in you that the devil wants to unlock the secret of why you are still standing. Why you in this service? You know your life is not right. But something is still in you that's holding the reigns that led you to this service tonight. Because it's a time of deliverance. Once you get between the pillars of what's holding you down, you will stand like Samson &gt;&gt; and say, "Remember me. I pray thee just this once." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And verse 16 of chapter 16. And it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words. I want you to understand on your job, in your school, in your neighborhood, there's somebody pressing you daily. That's why you got to pray every day. Meditate on the word day and night. Stay in the spirit because there's no day the enemy is not trying to get you. &gt;&gt; Delilah did not let up. It was daily she pressed him &gt;&gt; daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death. I don't know what strategy she used, but every I don't even know what vex under death is. Maybe one of the elders could help preach on that. &gt;&gt; But whatever it was, it broke Samson. &gt;&gt; Because until this time, he was playing with grace. &gt;&gt; But this was about to be almost, and I use the word almost. &gt;&gt; Because he was on the edge of the line. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a line that he was not supposed to cross &gt;&gt; because throughout all of this, there was something in him that he knew that if once he's here, which was a sign of the vow. &gt;&gt; Sign of the vow was in place, the devil couldn't get to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just drop this note here. It was not a spiritual happening. It was words &gt;&gt; that was used to break him down. &gt;&gt; Be careful who you talk to. Be careful who you have conversations with. &gt;&gt; There are people who are of illreute. People who hate the message. What do you have? They don't want it. That's them. &gt;&gt; Leave me. People want to believe what they want to believe. &gt;&gt; People believe all kinds of stuff. Don't get upset with me when I believe that I want to go to the rapture and I want to live holy and I want to &gt;&gt; the musicians. Get ready. I'm trying to wrap up. His soul was vexed unto death that he told her, listen to this scripture, brothers, if you could put it up, that he told her all &gt;&gt; his heart. &gt;&gt; King David, I believe, would say, "Thy word have I." &gt;&gt; He opened up &gt;&gt; his heart. and said unto her, there had not been a razor upon my head, &gt;&gt; for I have been a Nazerite unto God. &gt;&gt; Sisters, Brother Brandham said, you know, you are you under Nazarite bow. &gt;&gt; He said, when you cut your hair, &gt;&gt; you break the Nazarite bow. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the hairdresser says. &gt;&gt; She give me advice. &gt;&gt; Advice. You put your Nazarite vow, which is your protection on the wrist because of &gt;&gt; Philistine advice. &gt;&gt; Let's call it what it is. &gt;&gt; Because if it's not in support of your Nazarite vow, it's a Philistine recommendation. &gt;&gt; And you want to know why you can't see your way and you can't make progress. And the enemy, the enemy is always fighting you. But you have stepped out from under the Nazarite vow. &gt;&gt; Every single time the enemy attacks Samson, the spirit of the Lord come upon him. And the Bible, this is to me the most scary scripture in the entire Bible. [Music] &gt;&gt; Verse 20 when he gave the secret &gt;&gt; because the wife brought someone to shave his hair and he woke out of his sleep. And he said, I will go out as at other times before and shake myself &gt;&gt; and he wished not &gt;&gt; that the Lord was departed from him. It's a scary thing &gt;&gt; to not even know that God is not with you anymore. &gt;&gt; No wonder David said, "Lord, take not your Holy Spirit from me. &gt;&gt; Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit. Cast me not away from thy presence, oh God." &gt;&gt; Samson got up thinking that God was with him, but he didn't even realize &gt;&gt; that the spirit had left him. There are people have been in a message for a long time and they don't even realize &gt;&gt; that the spirit &gt;&gt; is not with you. &gt;&gt; Samson was called. He was anointed. He was under a covenant. But at that moment, the spirit &gt;&gt; had already departed. &gt;&gt; The fact that the angel came had nothing to do with the fact that the spirit had departed. Oh, you don't hear me? All of the teaching his parents gave him had nothing. God was no longer pleased. God was tired. He had reached the end of his road. [Music] &gt;&gt; At that point, Samson was backsliden. But the Brandham said it. He says Samson knew he had sinned. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when they came to get him, &gt;&gt; he thought he had the strength. &gt;&gt; And this is when people now walk out of church because all the strength you had now is gone and the enemy wipes you out. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we read the scripture that we started with. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Verse 21. But the Philistines took him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the first thing they did. They took him. Never before. There was never a battle that Samson lost &gt;&gt; until he stepped out from under his Nazarite vow. &gt;&gt; You play with that boy, you play with that girl, you play with pornography and fornication and adultery and all these things. You are stepping out from under your Nazerite vow. You give the pastor a horrible time because he doesn't even know sometimes what's going on. He could discern there's something wrong. But you are outside. You are out of order. He say, "Well, pray for me. Pray for me." But you're still in the thing. You still have clothes. Like brother Stephan said, like Achan where God told him, "Do that mess with the stuff from Jericho. &gt;&gt; Leave their clothes. Leave their money. Leave their music. Leave their styles. Leave their fashions. Leave their Leave it all. It's not yours. You are under a covenant. &gt;&gt; You want God to bless you? Stay under your Nazarite vow. Young sisters, protect your virginity. Stay under the vow. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Samson had a choice and he knew better. &gt;&gt; You cannot tell me he didn't know. &gt;&gt; The angelic visitation would have had an atmosphere in that home. &gt;&gt; It was a spiritual home. He grew up in the message. But he made a choice. Timnat, &gt;&gt; Sorak, &gt;&gt; Gaza, &gt;&gt; spending time further and further &gt;&gt; if not but for the grace of God that God could find a way to tie purpose to his grace. &gt;&gt; And could say all things could work together for good, but he has to see a certain level of repentance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandon would say, and you know it, we've read his quotes. Samson knew he was wrong. He say, "Lord, remember me. Oh God. &gt;&gt; They shaved his hair. The Bible said his hair grew back. It meant Samson was not in prison for one day. &gt;&gt; He had never cut his hair for his life. So for his hair to grow back, it was not one day he was grinding at the mill. &gt;&gt; Do you know that God Deegon is tied to mill and grain? Do you know in the whole of the four chapters 13, 14, 15, 16 of judges, there is never a situation of Samson having an altar, &gt;&gt; a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Go back to Deborah and go back to all the other judges. When there was a victory, there was worship, there was an altar. &gt;&gt; When Samson wins, he walks away. The Lord just blessed me. There's no thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; All right. The only prayer before that remember me prayer was after Samson killed a thousand men and he say well Lord yes see I win I thirsty give me some water read it no sincerity. He took his gift for granted. He took the message for granted. He took the books and the tapes for granted. He thought God was going to be with him all the time. But here it was. God stepped away so he could find himself. so he could come back to him in a new experience, a fresh experience. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; You can begin to play something softly. &gt;&gt; The Philistines took him. That's the first thing. The reality &gt;&gt; in the past when they tied him, he could just break. But here it was. He's being taken. &gt;&gt; The thoughts running through his mind, &gt;&gt; they have taken me. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I can't fight anymore. &gt;&gt; I have no army coming for me. &gt;&gt; I know what it feels like to be strong. I know what it was when I first came into the message. I know what it was when I felt the spirit of God. I knew that when the enemy came, there was no weapon formed against me could prosper. And here the enemy has taken me. &gt;&gt; But that's not the bad part. &gt;&gt; I want you to imagine &gt;&gt; Samson being taken. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And maybe there's a conversation. What are we going to do with him? &gt;&gt; And somebody decide, why don't we take out his eyes? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Have you stopped to think &gt;&gt; about what it is like for your eyes to be taken out? There was no anesthesia. &gt;&gt; They wanted to inflict pain. &gt;&gt; I wonder why they didn't kill him &gt;&gt; after all that he had done. But they wanted Samson to suffer. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? The devil wants you to suffer. The world you think is so beautiful and so wonderful and you can't live without it. &gt;&gt; The devil that's behind that wants you to suffer. &gt;&gt; Not just go to hell. He wants you to suffer. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say tears could run out of socketless eyes. &gt;&gt; Before he reached the mill, his eyes were gone. &gt;&gt; They took him first. &gt;&gt; They took out his eyes. &gt;&gt; Brought him down to Gaza. So took him down into the middle, the deepest part of the Philistine Empire. All right. &gt;&gt; At no time before this, brother George would the Lords of the Philistines even dream &gt;&gt; of coming near to Samson. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's somebody in prison tonight. &gt;&gt; They brought him down to Gaza, &gt;&gt; bound him with fetas of brass, &gt;&gt; and he did grind in the prison house. Some historians would say grinding the grain in the house of Deeon was a sign of worship &gt;&gt; and we read this scripture. They were having a service to their god Deeon. They didn't even say Delilah did it. They didn't say it was the money from the five lords of the Philistines who paid and financed it. They said our God Deeon had brought our enemy to his feet who have hurt many of us. Cancer is a Philistine. High blood pressure is a Philistine. Pornography is a Philistine. And they are in fellowship worshiping because they believe that they had something. Oh, you don't hear me tonight. Somebody's going to go free tonight. [Applause] The Bible said it was five lords of the Philistines had paid Delilah. But in this scripture, the Bible said all all the lords. I don't know how many lords there were. I don't know how many spirits there were. I don't know what attack it was in your home against your family. But I do know that the devil made the biggest mistake he could ever make by congregating an attack against God's son. The purpose of God by election was standing up for Samson. Something in him reconnected to his purpose. He said, "I know who I am. They call me the son-in-law of a Tim Knight, but God remember me. I am not that. That's not my name. That's not who I am. Oh God, help me tonight. [Music] [Applause] I don't know how long Samson was grinding at the mill, &gt;&gt; grinding at the mill. Thinking back to the church services, thinking back to the conventions, thinking back to the prayer meetings he missed, living with regret, living with the pain. When the pastor called for him and he didn't answer. When the deacon reached out and he switched off his phone and he ignored a phone call. When the kind sister said, "I'm not seeing you in church, Samson. Samson, what's wrong with you? Come back to church, Samson. Don't go down to Sorak. Don't go down to Gaza. We love you, Samson." Brother Brandham said he was remembering all of his victories. &gt;&gt; But something came into him. It is the first time Samson really prayed. Maybe as a child he went to prayer meetings, but this is the first time that he really prayed. Oh God, help me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And Samson called her to the Lord. It is the first time we hear in the Bible that he really called. People talk words in a prayer meeting, but Samson called upon the Lord and said, "Oh Lord God, remember me. Remember me. Don't forget me, Lord. Don't pass me by. Lord, I'm messed up, but remember me. Remember me, Lord. I pray thee &gt;&gt; and strengthen me. &gt;&gt; I pray thee &gt;&gt; only this once, oh God, &gt;&gt; that I may be at once avenge of the Philistines for my two eyes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the devil had no right. &gt;&gt; Mama, papa, &gt;&gt; your son could be in trouble, but the devil had no right. &gt;&gt; Oh God, he didn't put those eyes in there. The devil had no right. He didn't raise that boy. The devil has no right. We take away the permission from the devil tonight to afflict your home. We deny him the privilege of walking into your house. The devil has no right because the purpose of God can never be defeated. You are free in the name of Jesus Christ. And who the son of man set free is free indeed. Free and teeth. Free and teeth. You can go free. House of hell, give way to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Applause] And brother Brandham said Samson was willing to pay the price. He was willing to throw away his phone. He was willing to break friendships. He was willing to walk away from a girlfriend, walk away from a boyfriend, walk away from drinking, walk away from sin, walk away from filth. He was willing. He said, "Lord, let me die with these Philistines. I'm willing to die out tonight to lust, to pride, to gambling, to whatever it is." All listen. Oh, God help me. I challenge you, young brother, young sister, &gt;&gt; mama, papa, &gt;&gt; you could go free if you want to go free. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what the sin is. &gt;&gt; The Bible actually doesn't give a specific number of Philistines. [Music] The Bible said, "And they were upon the roof &gt;&gt; about 3,000." &gt;&gt; They didn't bother to specify the number. It meant all them demons and spirits that were supposed to be there that God wanted to destroy, they were in that gathering. &gt;&gt; High blood pressure was there. Diabetes was there. Cancer was there. Female condition. Arthritis was there. Doubt was there. Unbelief was there. Fear was there. Can't sleep at night. Your husband giving trouble. Whatever that spirit is, all of them were there. Samson said, "Leave me to the pillars." But the Stephanus touch it last night. And the mystery in him was bigger than the strength of the pillars, the power in him, the purpose in him. And because of who he was and the purpose that was upon him, God was obligated to honor. God in his mind had already seen not only Samson deliverance, he had all the laws where he wanted them. He had all the Philistines where he wanted them. He had Samson where he wanted them. God looked down and he looked at the beginning of the destruction of the Philistines. For the first time, Samson was in his purpose and Samson held the walls. He began to shake and the anointing came upon him. May his building shake tonight under the power of the anointing. May everything holding you back shake tonight. Every Philistine, you are free. You are free. [Applause] Young brother, young sister, tonight is your night. I challenge you. Hold on to your pillars. Put your hands on your pillars tonight. Hallelujah. You are a conqueror. You are more than a conqueror. I'm finished. I'm finished tonight. But it's even you can bring it to sing. Don't leave this service in bondage. Don't leave this service broken.
