[38:44] Corinthians chapter 4 we want to read
[38:46] verse 20 we want to read John 1
[38:50] 11-13 and John 12 20- 24 oh praise the
[38:55] Lord thank thank you
[39:04] Jesus reading 1 Corinthians 4:20 for the
[39:07] kingdom of God is not in word but in
[39:10] power John 1
[39:13] 1113 he came unto his own and his own
[39:15] receive him not but as many receive him
[39:18] to them give he power to become the sons
[39:20] of God even to them that believe on his
[39:23] name which were born not of blood nor
[39:26] the will of the flesh not the will of
[39:28] man but of God in John 12 reading from
[39:31] verse 20 to
[39:34] 24 and there were certain Greeks among
[39:36] them that came up to worship at the
[39:38] feast the same came therefore to Philip
[39:40] which which which was of the Cesar of
[39:42] Galilee and desired him saying sir we
[39:45] would see Jesus Philip cometh and tell
[39:47] it Andrew and again Andrew and Philip
[39:49] tell Jesus and Jesus answered them
[39:52] saying the hour is come that the son of
[39:54] man should be glorified verily very I
[39:57] say unto you except a corner wheat fall
[39:59] into the ground and die it abide alone
[40:01] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[40:04] fruit let's pray father we thank you for
[40:06] the scriptures and I pray the word come
[40:08] alive to us tonight May the word become
[40:10] flesh may give Revelation inspiration
[40:12] and confirm your word to the hearts of
[40:14] your children in Jesus name I ask it
[40:16] amen you may be
[40:18] seated praise God God bless you it's
[40:20] great to be here again among you all and
[40:24] to have this opportunity to share with
[40:26] you the word of God I have a thought I
[40:29] like to share with you tonight I think
[40:31] it's a a a keynote getting to the person
[40:36] Jesus Christ getting to the person Jesus
[40:40] Christ you know brother brandham one
[40:42] time he said he was wondering if the
[40:43] ministers if the people are not getting
[40:45] to Christ they going to church they they
[40:48] listen to ministers preach but are they
[40:50] getting to Christ and this a titled
[40:53] getting to the person Jesus Christ
[40:57] and um and I believe that the true
[41:01] Servants of God in this last day will
[41:03] take the people to the person Jesus
[41:06] Christ I believe that that is what the
[41:07] calling is about it's not as much
[41:09] established churches and systems but to
[41:12] really get the kingdom of God
[41:14] established in the hearts of God's
[41:16] people and the church then becomes a
[41:18] vehicle by which God's seed word could
[41:21] go into your hearts and then that word
[41:24] could turn by Spirit into power and
[41:27] transform your life so it's not so much
[41:29] you stopping this and stop doing this
[41:30] and doing this and not doing this but
[41:32] it's is a matter of what happens but in
[41:34] you that transform you and your desire
[41:38] for transformation now the scripture we
[41:40] read he came unto his own and his own
[41:42] receive him not but as many as receive
[41:45] him to them give he power to become and
[41:50] that in itself could be a sermon all by
[41:51] itself power to become it doesn't mean
[41:54] that you are instant it doesn't mean the
[41:57] work is finished instant it's power to
[42:00] become it's as if a father give a son
[42:03] $10,000 and said do what you want with
[42:05] it to start a business and he has the
[42:07] ability now or $100,000 or a million
[42:09] dollars or whatever it is he has the
[42:11] ability now to take that money and
[42:13] transform it into a multi-million dollar
[42:15] business power to become you don't have
[42:18] to become you could lose it you could
[42:20] blow it and that's why the prophet talk
[42:23] about Sons losing their adoption or
[42:24] losing their placing another brother
[42:26] taking their place and so like that
[42:28] because of their behavior and attitude
[42:30] so we just talking a little bit tonight
[42:31] share something tonight so we want to
[42:34] understand power to become what you are
[42:37] to become we were born in sin and shape
[42:40] of iniquity and God give us something to
[42:43] become something to start us with and
[42:45] you know the prophet said if we only get
[42:47] started God will do the rest so if
[42:49] there's something God given us and has
[42:51] given us to get started now we didn't
[42:54] call ourselves no man can come except
[42:56] the father call him and draw him so we
[42:58] didn't have the start to begin with we
[43:01] didn't start this thing God start this
[43:03] thing we fooling around sinner whatever
[43:06] whatever but God start a work and based
[43:09] upon that work we come what a whatever
[43:13] condition we is filthy half-hearted
[43:15] miserable amen trickster doesn't matter
[43:18] what you are you come because a call
[43:21] come in your life everyone get that call
[43:24] and Jesus he came to his very own but
[43:26] his own rejected him you did not reject
[43:29] him Hallelujah you responded to the call
[43:32] but the call is not to say as you are
[43:33] how you are they call is to receive
[43:35] something to become you still have to
[43:37] become Hallelujah you have to become
[43:39] like Jesus you have to become into the
[43:41] person of Christ the Pentecostals
[43:43] couldn't come into that because all they
[43:45] had was the gifts and they were in the
[43:47] womb Oh Glory to God so didn't other
[43:50] words the person of Christ could not
[43:52] have been introduced to them because the
[43:55] person come by the word
[43:56] and the word comes to the prophet and
[43:58] they rejected the prophet so they
[44:00] couldn't come into the person of Jesus
[44:01] Christ but there's a bright age that
[44:03] have a bright Ministry that could bring
[44:05] the people to the very person of Jesus
[44:07] Christ Oh Glory to God they say sir we
[44:10] would see Jesus they don't want to hear
[44:12] about him you know they have heard about
[44:14] him they come to see him now oh glory to
[44:16] God they heard the books they heard the
[44:18] tapes but they want to see him they
[44:20] heard he was with a prophet but he heard
[44:22] he's supposed to be among a bride oh
[44:24] give the Lord some Praises this is not g
[44:26] now they not trying to thing and saying
[44:28] things this is not that now this is say
[44:31] we would see Jesus not hear him see him
[44:34] oh glory to God give the Lord some
[44:36] Praises tonight Hallelujah glory to God
[44:39] notice brother bam a daughter is a
[44:42] product of mother and father by a
[44:44] union now here is something

[1:00:26] believe We stand for the word but then
[1:00:28] it switches when this time come glory to
[1:00:31] God they are Vindicated and placed then
[1:00:33] he prophesy when that time takes place

[1:01:22] drill concrete noise but you hallelujah
[1:01:26] we're drilling down into something here
[1:01:28] but Bram says here now in the Old
[1:01:31] Testament when that son was adopted or
[1:01:33] placed into the family his name was just
[1:01:35] as good as the check of his daddy was so
[1:01:37] when Jesus had been obedient and how did
[1:01:40] he become obedient he
[1:01:44] linted if you don't say amen and still
[1:01:46] the
[1:01:47] scriptures he learned obedience by the
[1:01:50] things that he suffered we are just
[1:01:53] normally obedient humbled because we
[1:01:54] church I'm glory amen hallelujah
[1:01:57] learned
[1:01:59] obedience now when Jesus had been
[1:02:01] obedient Jesus to God God placed him
[1:02:04] positionally this is him now here we go
[1:02:08] when the member is
[1:02:10] born by the Holy Ghost into the family
[1:02:15] he did not say join church he didn't say
[1:02:17] when I remember got spoken book and
[1:02:19] believe brother Bram and message and a
[1:02:21] PL a book and a PL of tape he didn't say
[1:02:23] that
[1:02:25] all right when I in the best Church in
[1:02:27] the country and the best pastor and the
[1:02:28] best sister the most literate and the
[1:02:31] most revelated man orever they want to
[1:02:33] call him
[1:02:34] now when a member is born how by the
[1:02:39] Holy Ghost into the family of God and
[1:02:43] has
[1:02:44] proven to have these virtues in
[1:02:47] him that God can see so this have
[1:02:51] nothing to do with man this have to do
[1:02:53] with church this have to do with you and
[1:02:55] God as I told in in Miami that that that
[1:02:58] adoption is between Father and Son
[1:03:00] church have nothing to do with it it's
[1:03:01] strictly Father and Son Father's son and
[1:03:04] father's
[1:03:08] business watch and proven to have these
[1:03:12] virtues in him that God can see
[1:03:14] knowledge and Temperance patience
[1:03:16] brotherly kindness godness in him then
[1:03:20] God no church not inside at all then God
[1:03:23] seals him
[1:03:25] or places him and that is when you see
[1:03:28] the Sons and Daughters of
[1:03:30] God and I will put it a SP and tell you
[1:03:33] not
[1:03:35] before let me say good not before this
[1:03:38] is what he's saying here that is when
[1:03:40] you see Sons and Daughters of God and to
[1:03:45] make sure is no mistake he continues do
[1:03:47] you remember Matthew the 17th chapter
[1:03:49] month Transfiguration you heard he him
[1:03:53] he said Ephesians 1 5 God has
[1:03:55] predestinated us onto adoption of sons
[1:03:58] you see a family when a son is born into
[1:04:01] it is a son then but that son had Tres
[1:04:03] to raise it and if that son never come
[1:04:05] to be the right kind of a son he never
[1:04:08] become air still a son but not a air if
[1:04:13] he was the right son the son that will
[1:04:15] obey his father then that son was
[1:04:17] adopted or placed positionally he become
[1:04:20] air to what the father had all right go
[1:04:24] me along with you Ephesians 1:35 says
[1:04:27] blessed be to God and father of our Lord
[1:04:29] Jesus Christ what blessed us with all
[1:04:31] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[1:04:33] in Christ according as he had chosen Us

[1:11:16] forward the ministry have to be set then
[1:11:20] the church is set Oh Glory to God God
[1:11:23] set the ministry first question this
[1:11:27] question and answers 30th of August
[1:11:32] 1964 somebody ask this
[1:11:34] question when you use the expression
[1:11:37] that if we do not believe the word we
[1:11:39] will be eternally separated from Christ
[1:11:41] do you mean the foolish virgin will live
[1:11:43] eternally but they will be separated
[1:11:45] from the New Jerusalem where Christ will
[1:11:47] dwell with the bright here are those who
[1:11:49] do not have the Holy Spirit born again
[1:11:51] as the scripture speaks of being born
[1:11:53] again
[1:11:54] if the natural birth requires water
[1:11:58] blood and spirit does not the spiritual
[1:12:01] birth require all three stages of grace
[1:12:05] before the person is truly born again
[1:12:08] answer absolutely I just explained that
[1:12:11] this morning you have got to have all
[1:12:15] stages you are begotten of the spirit
[1:12:19] just like a baby is begotten in the womb
[1:12:22] of a mother but not born until they
[1:12:26] receive the Holy Ghost you are born then
[1:12:29] you not converted you are in the process
[1:12:32] of being converted until that time then
[1:12:35] he went on further that's the reason
[1:12:37] that all these great Mysteries could not
[1:12:40] be given to Luther could not be given to
[1:12:42] Wesley could not be given to the age
[1:12:44] that just passed by the Pentecostal age
[1:12:46] why it wasn't time they were
[1:12:50] begotten so that means they were in the
[1:12:52] womb yes sir
[1:12:54] now here we go the person of Christ that
[1:12:57] we talking about tonight himself the son
[1:12:59] of man you understand revealing himself
[1:13:02] in human flesh it could not come until
[1:13:06] now because who is Son of Man Christ the
[1:13:10] S of the seed so he is saying I Elijah a
[1:13:14] son of man revealing the person of
[1:13:16] Christ the son of man to get the bride
[1:13:19] oh give the Lord some Praises that you
[1:13:22] could get the correct birth to be born
[1:13:24] of the word and spirit mechanics and
[1:13:27] Dynamics oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:13:30] do you see it now all right let's go but
[1:13:34] BR now he talk about the shock has to
[1:13:37] pull away to give the beat a chance to
[1:13:40] lay in the Sun so in the message come to
[1:13:42] all seed shock everything everybody in
[1:13:44] the message shaking hand Glory
[1:13:46] Hallelujah but some point in time they
[1:13:47] have to have something
[1:13:49] to let's call it the hot jly son
[1:13:52] Hallelujah
[1:13:54] when a he takes no shock pull back turn
[1:13:58] from green to Golden Brown because when
[1:14:01] everybody inside now everybody looking
[1:14:02] green you know what I mean new fresh
[1:14:05] green but then the heat of time the Heat
[1:14:09] of Trials the sunshine of tribulation
[1:14:12] and experiences start to make people
[1:14:14] turn golden green and dry up and start
[1:14:17] to pull back
[1:14:20] shock to give the be a chance to live
[1:14:23] before the son to ripen hallelujah oh
[1:14:25] glory to God so Faith have to be
[1:14:27] restored bam did that Faith have to be
[1:14:30] revealed isn't that right faith has to
[1:14:32] ripen faith has to mature and be
[1:14:35] manifested all is the same Faith the
[1:14:37] same processes restored revealed ripen
[1:14:41] manifested oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:14:43] not faith is not just talk Oh Glory to
[1:14:46] God he said the D he said I believe
[1:14:48] intellectually you're hearing the
[1:14:50] message your faith isn't right enough so
[1:14:53] they has to have a ripen Faith to come
[1:14:55] into our manifestation Oh Glory to God
[1:14:58] hallelujah listen to this or the shock
[1:15:00] has a pull away to give the weat a
[1:15:02] chance to lay before the son to ripen so
[1:15:07] he's talking about coming into
[1:15:09] presence
[1:15:11] s we would see
[1:15:14] Jesus watch the message coming right
[1:15:18] back into the church again forming the
[1:15:21] body of Jesus Christ just like the
[1:15:23] original one doesn't Jesus in the last
[1:15:26] days says the two will be so close will
[1:15:29] see very lit almost to the real thing is
[1:15:32] getting Harvest Time this is not
[1:15:34] Luther's age now this is not Pentecostal
[1:15:36] this is the bright age and as Moses
[1:15:38] still continuing and as Moses call a
[1:15:41] nation out of a Nation Christ today is
[1:15:44] calling a church out of a
[1:15:46] church that's the message in the message
[1:15:48] he's calling a people in the message out
[1:15:51] of the message from church the bride
[1:15:54] because church is the shock or church is
[1:15:56] the shell or church is activities
[1:16:00] religious
[1:16:01] activities Hallelujah but people in love
[1:16:04] with

[1:16:22] and te life your personal life this a
[1:16:25] age of personal life that was say man
[1:16:27] preaching a lot of mysteries but the the
[1:16:28] life is very mysterious and that is more
[1:16:31] important oh Hallelujah brother bandam
[1:16:35] now to refuse the person that's doing
[1:16:37] the call in Christ no matter if you're
[1:16:39] Pentecostal Methodist Luther whatever

[1:24:48] Ministry Rising on the on the scene to
[1:24:51] to deal with Goliath
[1:24:53] on the fields intellectual Giants
[1:24:55] shaking Nations and shaking kingdoms oh
[1:24:58] God a little plow boy like Lisha a
[1:25:01] little David with some sling oh let's
[1:25:03] continue now they get among church
[1:25:05] members they get among good people they
[1:25:08] not bad folks you know bad folks
[1:25:09] terrible all by theel these good people
[1:25:11] now and they cause them to come into an
[1:25:15] illusion and they say things and do
[1:25:19] things and teache things and practice
[1:25:22] things that is contrary to the word of
[1:25:27] God all of
[1:25:30] that so I have a right to be on guard
[1:25:33] and with my guns too and my sword to the
[1:25:37] ministers allow congregations to allow
[1:25:39] the people to play cars in the churches
[1:25:41] and so on and they try to do subsidary
[1:25:43] anything they try to adop a new plan
[1:25:45] they try to adop education to take the
[1:25:47] place of the Holy Ghost you're never
[1:25:49] able to do it no matter how well your
[1:25:50] man is educated I think is a good thing
[1:25:52] for him to be educated but if he hasn't
[1:25:54] got the Holy Spirit education will do
[1:25:55] him no good education will never take
[1:25:59] the place of the leadership of the Holy
[1:26:01] Spirit that's why I know them kingdoms
[1:26:03] them intellectual kingdoms will
[1:26:05] eventually fall that's I do how to show
[1:26:06] them down I do how to fight them and
[1:26:08] call them out and say that no no no I'm
[1:26:09] nothing that Bible said the Lord of that
[1:26:11] servant I leing them up to God they can
[1:26:12] to be servants the Lord of that servant
[1:26:14] will deal with him I am not the Lord so
[1:26:17] I am not called to deal with that so
[1:26:19] that don't deal with them things I don't

[1:29:11] mechanics we are looking for the
[1:29:13] Dynamics of it after 50 plus years we
[1:29:15] can't be looking for no mechanics we
[1:29:17] have to be looking for Dynamics I reject
[1:29:19] trying to look for any mechanics Right

[1:30:13] Hallelujah glory to God glory to God
[1:30:17] thank you Jesus all right let's we but
[1:30:20] say we have got the mechanics of
[1:30:21] religions of
[1:30:22] so bized it looks like a big 16 35 coach
[1:30:25] train sitting on a track but if you
[1:30:27] haven't got any steam in it it take
[1:30:28] Dynamic to perform the mechanics we need
[1:30:31] now to see that see he said we need now
[1:30:35] to see that this what we have been
[1:30:36] taught over the years is it the truth or
[1:30:38] not it's been explained over and over
[1:30:40] and over through different Seminary and
[1:30:41] churches so forth until we are looking
[1:30:44] to see who this person
[1:30:46] is you say brother brandham how would
[1:30:48] you do it well did you notice they come
[1:30:52] to a servant of Christ who had been
[1:30:55] trained to know what to do not to just
[1:30:58] sit down stay here wait now I explain it
[1:31:01] he brought them straight to him
[1:31:02] Hallelujah that's what they wanted to
[1:31:04] see we would see Jesus not we like you
[1:31:07] to explain it to us and tell us what
[1:31:10] it's all about that wasn't the question
[1:31:13] the one is see Jesus not not we need an
[1:31:15] x- man to explain what brother
[1:31:18] say so the ministers need a leader there
[1:31:22] the ministers don't need the Holy Ghost
[1:31:23] they need a guide some man to come and
[1:31:26] some Super Genius who have more head
[1:31:28] than heart makes no sense here what he
[1:31:31] saying they want to see Jesus God had
[1:31:33] someone standing there Phillip that
[1:31:35] could take them and show them to the
[1:31:38] person Jesus Christ and that's I get
[1:31:41] taught from tonight get into the person
[1:31:43] of Jesus Christ now what do we want to
[1:31:46] see we want to see the person well
[1:31:48] brother brandham we will see him when he
[1:31:50] comes yes but he promised that he in the
[1:31:53] person of the Holy Spirit would come in
[1:31:55] the last days and would be with us even
[1:31:58] in us to the end of the world we find we
[1:32:01] couldn't find him in fine lectures
[1:32:02] because we find people who can stand up
[1:32:04] and can explain the word in such a way
[1:32:06] it is
[1:32:08] breathtaking I this Prophet it's bread
[1:32:10] taken but when we find it it's still
[1:32:13] just a lecture it's
[1:32:16] mechanics just talk and you train like
[1:32:19] to talk all right we find the
[1:32:21] Entertainer go through the action and so
[1:32:22] forth still isn't it that isn't what we
[1:32:24] looking for we are looking for the
[1:32:27] person Jesus Christ see the person Jesus
[1:32:31] Christ now if the Bible said he's the
[1:32:32] same yesterday then forever then he must
[1:32:34] be that or the Bible is wrong then here
[1:32:37] we go now when the church says we got it
[1:32:42] we got it we got it and so forth and if
[1:32:44] you got it you would show
[1:32:47] it see the person Christ Jesus so any
[1:32:50] church that say the god got it they got
[1:32:52] it show it that's right don't just talk
[1:32:55] about you get it come down here by we we

[1:35:03] eight of 13 Pages Oh Glory to God ah my
[1:35:07] God
[1:35:08] hallelujah my Lord Brother B talk about
[1:35:11] now the great a has approached our Lord
[1:35:13] one of the most trying times of all his
[1:35:15] Earthly Journeys are just was just at
[1:35:17] hand testing time Jesus had to go
[1:35:20] through testings just a as we go through
[1:35:22] testings the Bible said every son that
[1:35:23] cometh to God must first be tested
[1:35:25] trained corrected now many people it is
[1:35:28] a showdown when a testing time come it's
[1:35:30] a time of proven place and the Bible
[1:35:32] says if we cannot stand testing we
[1:35:34] become illegitimate illegitimate
[1:35:36] children we are professing God to be our
[1:35:38] father but then he's not our father if
[1:35:41] we have correctly and with all our heart
[1:35:43] received the Lord Jesus as our personal
[1:35:44] savior there is nothing is this Earth
[1:35:46] and that eternity can separate us from
[1:35:48] the love of God in Christ Jesus I am a
[1:35:51] St founded in this day and always have
[1:35:54] been when people profess to be
[1:35:56] Christians and the first little trial
[1:35:58] comes on they fall by the way side it
[1:36:00] goes to show that here we go and this
[1:36:03] the Anchor Point tonight on the opposite
[1:36:05] side it goes to show it was an
[1:36:07] intellectual conception of
[1:36:10] Christ they in church long time all of a
[1:36:13] sudden something knock them out they
[1:36:15] never had a
[1:36:16] foundation tell them in Miami all them
[1:36:18] brothers who leave the message now and
[1:36:19] and don't believe brother Bram never a
[1:36:21] revelation they were always Hypocrites
[1:36:23] and
[1:36:24] impersonators they were always that and
[1:36:27] some of them were there for 20 years 30
[1:36:29] years for much years and they leave it
[1:36:30] now they never had a revelation because
[1:36:32] she a punished rock my church how that
[1:36:34] could move how you can move when you
[1:36:36] have a revelation they never had it it's
[1:36:38] just they get exposed and they had to
[1:36:40] walk like Judas or like the or or like
[1:36:43] those don't make believers they had to
[1:36:44] walk away and they're fighting the
[1:36:46] message oh my brother bam watch this
[1:36:51] that's the reason so many doesn't hold
[1:36:53] out today is because it's an
[1:36:55] intellectual conception intellectually
[1:36:58] you could believe it but it goes further
[1:37:00] than that to accept Christ is to accept
[1:37:03] the person of Christ here we go almost
[1:37:06] done many of us accept religion of
[1:37:08] Christianity upon learning of Creeds
[1:37:10] that's teaching now others accept
[1:37:13] Christianity upon doctrines of baptism
[1:37:15] others believe that they're Christians
[1:37:16] because of some emotion that they
[1:37:18] exercise shouting dancing in the spirit
[1:37:20] speaking in tongues have some marvelous
[1:37:22] gift to present all those things are
[1:37:24] good in their place but it's to accept
[1:37:26] Christ is to accept the person of Christ
[1:37:29] and then all these other things will
[1:37:30] automatically fall in line so what I
[1:37:32] want to show you is this somebody could
[1:37:34] have all these other doctrinal things
[1:37:35] and they believe this and they believe
[1:37:37] that and this legalism thing and they
[1:37:38] don't wear this and they don't wear that
[1:37:40] and they wear this and wear that and
[1:37:41] whatnot and that have nothing to do with
[1:37:43] the person of Jesus
[1:37:45] Christ in other words they executive
[1:37:47] Catholic Mage executive Baptist they
[1:37:50] just just substitute different
[1:37:54] things brother
[1:37:56] Brown if God did not spare his own son
[1:37:59] from Cruel testing then he will not
[1:38:01] spare you or I from Cruel testing Jesus
[1:38:06] was here confronting the greatest test
[1:38:08] that he ever had Gethsemane late before
[1:38:11] him that once all sufficient test must
[1:38:13] come and the burdens of the entire world
[1:38:15] laid upon his blessed shoulder there was
[1:38:17] no one in all heaven or Earth could ever
[1:38:20] stood up but him and to know that all of
[1:38:22] his sins past present present sins
[1:38:24] future sins rested upon this decision it
[1:38:26] was one of the most greatest victories
[1:38:28] that Christ ever won or prove his great
[1:38:30] messiahship as when he said to God not
[1:38:32] my will but thy will be done that was
[1:38:34] the greatest Victory ever won all the
[1:38:35] Demons of Tor was around tempt him and
[1:38:37] the try him here we go here the bum and
[1:38:41] when we get right with God when our
[1:38:43] hearts become pure and the Holy Spirit
[1:38:46] has taken its place in our heart it is
[1:38:49] the most glorious thing to have
[1:38:53] testing he show you how it come glorious
[1:38:55] you know when your heart is right when
[1:38:58] your heart become pure and the Holy
[1:39:01] Spirit has taken his place in our hearts
[1:39:03] is the most glorious thing to have his
[1:39:05] testing the Bible tells us that our
[1:39:07] testings and trials are more precious to
[1:39:09] us than gold and
[1:39:11] silver of this world so we should be
[1:39:14] thankful
[1:39:15] Hallelujah you say well wait a minute if
[1:39:18] some Bishop would tell me that Bishops
[1:39:20] can't reach Supernatural many times the
[1:39:22] Bishops in the message God take the
[1:39:24] foolish things of the world to confound
[1:39:26] the wise it wasn't Kus that passed
[1:39:28] through the gate called beautiful that
[1:39:29] he of a man it was Peter ignorant and Le
[1:39:32] but they know he had been with Jesus
[1:39:35] certainly when you were with Jesus and
[1:39:36] belong to him the works that Jesus does
[1:39:37] you'll do also watch this part he said
[1:39:40] no you're going to hear it for your last
[1:39:41] time
[1:39:42] sometime so what Daniel preached in
[1:39:44] Babylon before it was finally happened
[1:39:47] it looks so close don't take no chance
[1:39:49] but when the last Gentile
[1:39:51] is brought into the body of Christ
[1:39:53] there'll be room for no more look at the
[1:39:55] phrasing not the last Gentile get a book
[1:39:58] CTI that's not the same thing not when
[1:40:01] last Gentile believe but AB in whatever
[1:40:03] language they have these are not books
[1:40:06] is not that when the last Gentile is
[1:40:09] brought into the body how do we get into
[1:40:12] the body by one by one teaching by one
[1:40:16] Mystery by seven
[1:40:18] Mysteries by one spirit
[1:40:21] you can't change that by one Spirit you
[1:40:24] are baptized into the body then you get
[1:40:27] into the body called the body of Christ
[1:40:29] which is the kingdom of God hallelujah
[1:40:32] and the kingdom is not in word but in
[1:40:35] power all right let's go but Bram said
[1:40:39] this
[1:40:40] now don't take no chance when the last
[1:40:43] Gentile is brought into the body of
[1:40:45] Christ there'll be no more room no more
[1:40:48] won't you make a stand for him why don't
[1:40:50] you call yourself a a soldier why don't
[1:40:51] you confess your sins you say brother
[1:40:53] brandham I belong to the Methodist I
[1:40:55] don't care what church you belong to I
[1:40:57] am asking you to accept Christ the
[1:41:01] person of Christ which is the Holy Ghost
[1:41:03] in you that changes your whole attitude
[1:41:06] changes your being and if you haven't
[1:41:09] got that you will miss the
[1:41:11] Rapture and you are going to be there
[1:41:13] for the
[1:41:14] tribulation so friends getting to the
[1:41:17] personal Christ is the most important
[1:41:20] vision
[1:41:21] you could get to prepare your heart for
[1:41:24] the coming of the Lord Brother
[1:41:28] brandham Dr Morris Redfield redhead the
[1:41:32] president of the great Sudan missions
[1:41:34] the greatest in the world came to me
[1:41:36] recently and in the room he said but
[1:41:38] brandham I have enough degrees with
[1:41:40] honorary degrees to plaster your wall he
[1:41:43] said but where is Christ in any of it
[1:41:45] has the teachers been wrong I said I I
[1:41:49] would not wish to say that sir I a
[1:41:51] person with grammar school education I
[1:41:53] could not say that those great fine
[1:41:54] teachers have been wrong but they told
[1:41:56] you truth but Christ doesn't go by
[1:41:59] degrees you get their treat theology
[1:42:02] Christ is by faith he is not a myth he's
[1:42:05] a person and then he said this year the
[1:42:08] holy spirit is not a
[1:42:10] thought it is a person when he the Holy
[1:42:15] Ghost is come he personal pronoun is a
[1:42:19] person of Christ and the form of the
[1:42:21] Holy Spirit living in you I am the vine
[1:42:24] you the branches Oh Glory to God oh give
[1:42:27] the Lord some Praises hallelujah
[1:42:30] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory
[1:42:33] to God now if you don't believe in
[1:42:35] there's a real devil you don't believe
[1:42:37] there's a God you've got to believe the
[1:42:39] contrary the pro and the cons there's a
[1:42:40] real devil and he's a person not a
[1:42:42] thought he's a person now there's
[1:42:44] teaching goes on that says the devil is
[1:42:45] just an evil thought you get no it isn't
[1:42:47] the Devil is a person the same people
[1:42:49] believe that the Holy Ghost is just a
[1:42:50] good thought you get don't believe that
[1:42:52] the Holy Ghost is a person it's the
[1:42:54] person of Christ in spirit form Oh Glory
[1:42:58] to God we're going well good if I stay

[1:43:22] people out of it the Bible says so come
[1:43:24] out of her be not partakers with her
[1:43:27] what Abraham said now watch that's the
[1:43:29] reason I spoke against the church the
[1:43:30] lodge I call it when God said come be
