There is none like him. There is no God like Jehovah. He's the same yesterday and today and forever. He is still a way maker. He is still Jehovah Gyra. He is still a healer. He is still a restorer. He is a baptizer. He could change your circumstance. He is changing your circumstance. It's a finished work. It's already done. He called you for a purpose. And that's enough to worship him. That's enough to praise him. It's enough to shake out of our condition. Shake out of our feelings. Come out of our emotions. Enter into the realm of the heavenly. I was glad when they said unto me, "Let us go into the house of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Shall we pray? Oh gracious heavenly father, it's such a humbling experience to be in your house. It's not something we could ever take for granted. There are people who did not make it to this morning. They died in their sleep. There are people who did not make it this morning. They couldn't even move. Sometimes we take for granted the simple things. Sometime we take for granted the fact that we are not in a hospital bed. There's somebody in a hospital bed all over the world today. But we are here in your presence this morning with the direct access to your throne that you made possible. Not that we chose you, but you chose us. And we are responding to the call, the seed in us that you placed there before we even understood who we are and whose we are. Father, the seed, Lord, has been quickened by the spirit. The seed has been encouraged by the word and the right atmosphere has resulted in us being here this morning. Father, may you speak to the seed in us. Father, may you Lord create the atmosphere for us. Father, Lord, as we send the praises up, you promise to inhabit the praises of your people. You said when the praises would go up, the glory of God would come down, Father. Lord, it's two sides of this equation. And so we want to create an atmosphere by sending up the praise and sending up the worship, sending up the glory, those that are upstairs, those that might be still downstairs, those might be at their homes, wherever they may be. We want to create an atmosphere that shifts the situation around us, to confuse the devil, to even confuse our infirmities, to confuse our bodies. If you want to create a list of everything to complain about, there'll be a list. If you want to create a list of things we are thankful for, we'll have a bigger list this morning. So, Father, we are thankful Lord for how you brought us through. We are thankful for Lord, you give us purpose. We are thankful for the trials and the testings, the things we understand and the things we don't understand, the things THAT WE COULD RECONCILE and the things we cannot reconcile. We thank you this morning for bringing us here into your house. May you bless the Lord. what will be said and done today. We commit the service into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Before you take your seats, I just want to read one verse from the book of Proverbs, chapter 18, verse 21. Proverbs 18 and verse 21. Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. I want to read it one more time. Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that love it shall eat the f fruit thereof. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated in the presence of the Lord. It's certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the Lord this morning and to be able to gather under the cover of the blood. And through his blood, we could come into his presence. Once we are under that blood, if we're not under the blood, then we are exposed and we are vulnerable. But once there's blood, then when we have an issue, the blood speaks for us. the box. The blood speaks better things than we could even express. When you try to explain yourself, that's one type of explanation. But when the blood speaks for you, &gt;&gt; then the things that you say now fade because the blood is a better voice. It's a better expression. It could cover a multitude of sins. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; So I greet you on behalf of the pastor. And uh uh today, in a few hours, in fact, he would be beginning the journey back home. How many appreciate your pastor this morning? Over the last few weeks, he would have preached in France at brother Jano's church, then twice in Germany at brother Stephanos Skolen Brenner's church, then he went across to Nigeria. Uh last weekend he spoke in Naiwi at brother Isaac JP's convention and earlier today he spoke at brother Olu's church LCA Lagos. So it's been uh quite a journey for him. I was saying it's a it's the first time he's he's out for this long in this kind of a way, but the Lord has kept him. The Lord has preserved him and he's strong by the grace of God. So, we are looking for him to be back uh by the grace of God during the course of this week. And we are so grateful for the strength of the church, for the officers, for the helps, for the governments, for the ministers who stand as a trained the church that even when the pastor is not here, we're not all wishy-washy and all over the place. But we stand as soldiers with an understanding of our responsibilities, that the war still continues, that we have been trained for such a time as this, that even if you are left alone on an island, you could defend the island because you know who you are. You are son of the king. You understand the authority. You understand what you're called to do. And everyone stays in step because we have a vision and what we see should put our souls into action to make a church that would make a revival. So I want to salute all of the ministers that would have spoken during this period of time. All the support the song leaders, brother Anthony, brother Gideon, brother Steven, all the different supports as we stand by the grace of God, brother Jason as well. We are so grateful for all of the helps, governments, and the gifts that God has placed in the church in the body of believers in this portion of the vineyard where the harvest is plentiful and the laborers are few and there are many and and the Bible said that the love of many will wax cold. &gt;&gt; So it comes as no surprise to us when people lose the passion and the zeal because that's prophesied in scripture. So it comes as no surprise to us. The question is what are we going to do about it and how are we going to solve it and what are you doing about it and what are you doing to make your calling and election sure because once you are past that age of accountability you have to now give an account for yourself &gt;&gt; you know and many of us you know we have this blame game of who is responsible and who's responsible but there's a lot that you can do to advance yourself both in the natural and in the spiritual and many times we make excuses because it's tied to our own desires and our own hearts so we want to Understand as Christians every day of the week, not just on Sundays or Wednesdays or Fridays, but every day of the week, we have a testimony that we are contending for the faith that we are doing something to grow as much as in the natural as in the spiritual. God is interested in every single aspect of it. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; So this morning we will play a tape from brother oid uh from uh the Navy convention and of some have compassion. It's not a long message. Uh but I know it's going to be a tremendous blessing to you. Um but before we put that tape on, I wanted to share something to encourage us a bit about uh the power of our words. You know, I've been seeing more and more people are looking for a breakthrough. They're looking for healing, for deliverance, for transformation. And many times we are doing some self- sabotage. So, we addressed in the prayer meeting on Friday about destroying the evidence that Satan has against us because if you're looking to stand before the Lord and the devil, who is supposed to be the accuser of the brethren, the Bible makes that very, very clear. Standing accusing you day and night, when you sleep in, he's bringing accusations. And if there's evidence to contest and to show, but look, look, look, look, look. Then you have to be able to understand how to destroy that. And as much as you have a lawyer, this is why there's there's lawyer client privilege. Tell me what really happened so I could build a case to defend you. But if we could destroy the evidence completely, then the case has to be dismissed. Then the judge has no issue saying case dismissed. Because in the court, a lawyer can't dismiss a case if there's a host of the evidence against you. You can't just the legal framework doesn't allow for that. People could question the validity of the case. But if we blow up the evidence against you, and the evidence could be shown to that was not you. The man who you want to look for is really Jacob, but this man here is Israel. &gt;&gt; He used to be Jacob. The man you're talking to is Israel. It's not Jacob anymore. You can't call him that. He had a name change. Something happened to him. The old version no LONGER EXISTS. HE DIED OUT TO HIMSELF A LONG TIME AGO. AND YOU CAN'T ARREST a different man for the crime done by another man. You don't hear me this morning. So when there's A TRANSFORMATION OF GOD UPON YOUR LIFE AND THEY SAY, "BUT HIS NAME IS JACOB." NO, MY NAME IS NOT JACOB. MY NAME IS ISRAEL. WHEN DID IT HAPPEN? I MET THE ANGEL AND I wrestled with the ANGEL AND HE TOUCHED MY HE TOUCHED THE HOLLOW OF MY JOINT. SO THE WAY I WALKED INTO CHURCH THIS MORNING I WALKING OUT DIFFERENT BECAUSE WHEN HE MET THE ANGEL HIS WALK CHANGED HIS TALK CHANGED HIS LIFE CHANGED. HOW YOU COULD OH YOU DON'T HEAR ME this morning. &gt;&gt; That's how God could confuse the devil. That's why there's a part of his whole name change. Abraham to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Saul to Paul. &gt;&gt; GO LOOK FOR SAUL. HE NO LONGER EXISTS. HIS NAME IS PAUL. NOW, WHY? BECAUSE HE MET THE LORD HIMSELF. HE SAID, "WHY YOU PERSECUTE ME? GO YOUR WAY NOW." HE'S A DIFFERENT MAN NOW. THE NAME change represents a change of identity. IT REPRESENTS WHO YOU REALLY ARE IN GOD. AND IF THE LORD DOES A TRANSFORMATION ON YOU, THE DEVIL CAN'T EVEN ACCESS YOU ANYMORE. [Applause] Can the church say amen so we can stand boldly and with confidence? &gt;&gt; And have a testimony of a real understanding of your identity in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I encourage you if you were not in that prayer meeting, go back to it. &gt;&gt; Listen to it. Understand it because you have rights. You have privileges. There are things you access. Sam Brandham said many times we are living under our privileges. &gt;&gt; God is not happy watching you walking around sick and depressed and frustrated. God gets no pleasure in that. He wants to see you overcoming. He wants to see you in victory. He want to see you worshiping. He want to see you blessed going in, bless coming out. He promised that goodness and mercy supposed to follow you. Not hardship AND FRUSTRATION AND CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT BUT GOODNESS and mercy where you walk. People just see look GOODNESS AND MERCY FOLLOW HIM. He said, "NOT SUNDAYS ALONE, BUT ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE. WHEN YOU WALK INTO YOUR JOB, GOODNESS AND MERCY FOLLOWING YOU. YOU HAVE AN ENTOURAGE WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR HOME. GOODNESS AND MERCY. MERCY FOR WHEN YOU MESS UP. GOODNESS FOR WHEN YOU NEED A TOUCH FROM THE LORD AND SUSTENANCE. GOODNESS AND MERCY FOLLOWING you with the angel OF THE LORD ENCAMPED AROUND THEM THAT FEAR YOU. SO YOU HAVE SECURITY AND GOODNESS AND MERCY. LET THE DEVIL TRY TO GET INTO THAT NOW &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE ARE ANGELS AROUND YOU TO PROTECT YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GREATER IS HE THAT'S IN YOU THAN HE THAT'S IN THE WORLD. I DON'T CARE WHAT MISTAKE YOU MADE, WHAT PROBLEM YOU MADE. THAT'S WHY HE SAID GOODNESS AND MERCY WILL FOLLOW YOU ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE. AS I WAS WITH MOSES, SO I SHALL BE WITH THEE. I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU. I WILL NOT FORSAKE THEE. BUT MEDITATE ON THIS LAW DAY AND NIGHT, AND YOU WILL HAVE GOOD SUCCESS. YOU'LL HAVE SUCCESS ON A MONDAY, SUCCESS ON A TUESDAY, SUCCESS ON A FRIDAY, SUCCESS ON A SUNDAY, SUCCESS IN YOUR JOB, SUCCESS IN YOUR MARRIAGE, SUCCESS IN YOUR PRAYER LIFE, SUCCESS IN DIGGING INTO THE WORD. HAVE GOOD SUCCESS. GOD LOVES TO add these DESCRIPTIONS TO HIS THING. NOT JUST HAVE SUCCESS, GOOD SUCCESS. &gt;&gt; CUP RUNNING OVER. WHEN GOD DOES SOMETHING, THERE'S ALWAYS EXTRA INVOLVED, you know. He don't leave it and say, "Well, I bless you and your cup." No, your cup run over. &gt;&gt; FEED 5,000. IT HAVE ALL EVERYBODY FEED AND IT HAVE REMAINDERS JUST TO SHOW THAT God was in the picture. WHEN HE BLESSED ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM SO BLESSED LOT GET BLESSED. ALSO, WHEN GOD IS INVOLVED IN THE EQUATION, THERE'S ALWAYS EXTRA TO PROVE that it's God. IT'S BIGGER THAN YOU. IT'S GOD'S LOVE TO YOU. IT'S GOD'S MERCY TO YOU. IT'S GOD'S GRACE TO YOU. IT'S GOD'S FAVOR TO YOU. IT'S GOD'S MERCY TO YOU. IT'S GOD'S GOODNESS TO YOU. CAN THE CHURCH say amen? &gt;&gt; But I want to touch on something &gt;&gt; before I close out. &gt;&gt; We spoke about the evidence Satan has. So when you have unconfessed sin, brother shared it could hold up the church, hold up your family, hold up your life because God wants to move, but you create these obstacles &gt;&gt; and you give the devil evidence to use against you. He say confess it, put it under the blood. &gt;&gt; He say drop yours. &gt;&gt; He say husbands operate a certain way with your wife. We went through all this on Friday. I want to go beyond this to now our words because many of us are in trouble because of our words. &gt;&gt; I was sharing with my wife in driving up there are people who are suffering in silence because they don't want to say certain things and because they don't want to say certain things they suffer in silence. And while that is happening on the flip side of the coin, they are comfortable to comment about things and matters and issues that doesn't edify. &gt;&gt; So they lock down the issues they need help for, but they're comfortable to express opinions, thoughts, ideas around other people, subjects, thoughts. &gt;&gt; And you ask the deeper question because questions are important. &gt;&gt; GOD USES QUESTIONS. WHERE WAS thou &gt;&gt; when I laid the foundation of the earth? And the questions GET US TO RECALIBRATE OUR THINKING. So I want to challenge our approach as we come to the end of this year and prepare for a new year. What's the motive and objective? Because if YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM WITH GOSSIP, &gt;&gt; you will never change your thinking about it. &gt;&gt; We we address gossip as a spirit. You remember the sister when preach say you touch everything where you touch me. &gt;&gt; Amen. say he's a gossiper. &gt;&gt; Gossip is a spirit. But gossip is deeper than just saying is a spirit. &gt;&gt; The whole issue of spending time talking about issues with no desire for edification. &gt;&gt; In other words, what does telling you this about this brother do to edify you? &gt;&gt; And what does telling YOU ABOUT IT HAVE TO do to help you? &gt;&gt; And does ME TELLING YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BROTHER OR SISTER HELP THEM? BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T EDIFY, WHAT'S THE PURPOSE? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUR LIFE NOT CHANGING, THE PERSON YOU TALKING TO NOT CHANGING, AND THE PERSON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAN'T GET HELP. &gt;&gt; ALL THAT TIME IS WASTED TIME. &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand this gossiping demon &gt;&gt; because it's a spirit, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S A ISSUE OF LIFE. BECAUSE IT'S VERY EASY FOR PEOPLE TO SAY, "WELL, you see, let me tell you about what the latest." Young people know the tea. Spill the tea. &gt;&gt; You hear the latest. You see the latest. You You want to hear what really happened. &gt;&gt; After you hear OR SAY WHAT HAPPENED, YOUR LIFE KNOW BETTER &gt;&gt; AND THE PERSON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT BETTER. AND MOST MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THE PERSON WHO'S RECEIVING THIS &gt;&gt; NOT GETTING HELP. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what I call ABOUT THE MYSTERIES. PEOPLE WANT TO PREACH mysteries and mysteries in the MESSAGE AND THEIR LIFE IS A MYSTERY BECAUSE BEHIND INDOLOGY THE MYSTERY IS A GOSSIPING DEMON. YOU SEE THIS? You hear this? Let me tell you the real story behind this. Let me tell you WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. AND I HEAR IT and a maxi and I was on a fig tree &gt;&gt; and she tell her and he tell him and well it's really the first cousin second cousin twice remove who really living in the house and she really see and I know the coworker and by TIME YOU DONE YOUR LIFE IS NO better [Applause] &gt;&gt; talk about Jesus &gt;&gt; that's what the prophet said thank you brother Punch brother but the brand said when you talk about him he draws near &gt;&gt; so I want to help you As we COME TO THE END OF THIS year and prepare for the new year, STOP TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE AND STUFF and these things and talk things. But man, say it's better if you have nothing good to say. Don't say nothing. &gt;&gt; The Bible said even a fool when he is silent is considered wise. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope this helps somebody today. You know, because many of us are keeping back our lives by the things we comment on. And sometime we comment on things not even knowing God in the picture. We preached last week about God was judging that ship that Jonah was on and the men tried to save the ship, save Jonah. But you can't interrupt God's judgment. You can't interrupt God's plan. The more THEY TRIED TO FIGHT IT and try to save Jonah, the more the storm INCREASED BECAUSE GOD'S DESIRE WAS TO THROW a man overboard. Only when the man got overboard, the moment he was overboard, THE SHIP STOPPED MOVING ONE TIME BECAUSE GOD WAS IN THE PICTURE. So I want to read one scripture and we'll close out. This is in James 3. A word induced eating. Thank you for a punch. At least a punch is with me this morning. Once I have one person with me, I know we're good. James 3, my brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. So, but the the Bible here is saying, don't try to be a teacher. You know where the Bible say try to get ministry. This is what he's talking about here. Be not many masters. Don't try to be a teacher. In the amplified it says not many of you should become teachers serving in an official teaching capacity. Why? That we knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. So in other words, me standing here this morning is not about you. It is about you in part, BUT IT'S BECAUSE I HAVE TO GIVE AN account &gt;&gt; for coming behind the sacred desk this morning. &gt;&gt; I am being measured and my papers being marked by God. &gt;&gt; At the end of the day, brother Punch, is God have to mark the papers? NO. &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU SHOUT, WHETHER you receive it, YOU DON'T RECEIVE IT, YOU ACCEPT IT, YOU DON'T ACCEPT IT. I REPORT TO one person, which is the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm under THE HEADSHIP OF A PASTOR, BUT I REPORT TO THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. And if you say DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE OF PEOPLE SAYING things they shouldn't say I have to report for duty. If it fall in your lot it's not you are talking to it's the spirit. [Applause] &gt;&gt; GOD LOVES THE SINNER BUT HERE'S THE HE SIN. &gt;&gt; So if you feel offended about it is realize it's not even you feel offended. It's his spirit upon you &gt;&gt; getting exposed. But when we expose the spirit upon you and he RECOGNIZED THIS IS NO LONGER THE HOUSE FOR HIM. THE SPIRIT WILL HAVE TO GO. IS WHEN THINGS ARE KEPT HIDDEN, THEY begin to grow and dwell. THAT IS WHY COCKROACH AND ALL THESE THINGS HIDE IN DARKNESS. BUT THE MOMENT WE SHINE LIGHT, YOU SEE THEM START TO SCURRY. SO WE WANT TO EXPOSE THIS MORNING EVERYTHING THAT WILL HINDER YOUR PROGRESS IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM. SO WHEN YOU APPROACH GOD, YOU COULD APPROACH GOD WITH BOLDNESS, KNOWING YOU ARE SPEAKING LIFE INTO YOUR HOME, LIFE INTO YOUR FAMILY, LIFE INTO YOUR SITUATION, AND NOT USING this tongue to speak death into your situation. That's why the Bible say, "Let the weak say, I'm strong." &gt;&gt; Declare it to be so. &gt;&gt; Verse two, for we all stumble and sin, for in many things we offend all, verse two, if any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man and also to bridle the whole body. Behold, listen to the scripture. We put bits. You know, you see a horse race. That thing you put in the mouth, it's called a bit. The Bible says here, we put bits in the horse's mouth that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body. In other words, once the bit is in the mouth and you pull that cord on the horse, the horse will go wherever you pull. Are we together? Behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm whethersoever the governor or the ship captain listed or once in other words the biggest ship in the world IF THE CAPTAIN HOLD this thing this rudder and turn the WHOLE SHIP AS LARGE AS IT IS WILL TURN ARE WE together &gt;&gt; even so verse five the tongue is a little member. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T LIFT WAIST WITH YOUR TONGUE, YOU KNOW. &gt;&gt; You could build arm muscles, leg muscles, all kind of things. BUT THE TONGUE AS A LITTLE MEMBER, even so the tongue is a little member and boasted great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindle it. &gt;&gt; So James is saying this little small tongue &gt;&gt; starting big fires. YES. &gt;&gt; FIRES IN MARRIAGES, FIRES ON THE JOB, FIRES IN YOUR HOME. &gt;&gt; That's why say a soft answer turns away rat. &gt;&gt; But no, you were to give him &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible now. THE LITTLE MEMBER &gt;&gt; MAN HAVE BIG BODY BUT THE LITTLE ME LITTLE TONGUE HIS WHOLE LIFE IS BEING LET'S READ IT IN THE scripture &gt;&gt; verse six and THE TONGUE IS A fire &gt;&gt; a WORLD OF iniquity &gt;&gt; so is the tongue among our members that IT DEFILETH THE WHOLE body &gt;&gt; and SET IT ON FIRE THE COURSE OF NATURE &gt;&gt; AND IT IS SET ON FIRE OF HELL. &gt;&gt; VERSE SEVEN, FOR EVERY KIND OF BEASTS and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed by mankind. Go in the zoo &gt;&gt; man tame what kind of elephant tame lion. You go into you see see all kind of poisonous snakes. Man figure HOW TO TAME ALL THESE ANIMALS. But verse eight, but the tongue can no man tame. &gt;&gt; It is an unruly evil &gt;&gt; full OF DEADLY POISON. &gt;&gt; There bless we God. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE THERE BLESSING GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You're using your words and the SAME TONGUE. ON A SUNDAY. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty. I'm not a singer. &gt;&gt; You appreciate the special. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. I was so blessed. Thank you so much to the Genevieve the Sunday school. Wonderful. THE SAME TONGUE THAT blessing &gt;&gt; verse go on. even the father AND THEREWITH CURSE we men &gt;&gt; and curse don't just mean obscene language you know &gt;&gt; curse mean you go fail &gt;&gt; you will crash &gt;&gt; you go you go fail it GO FALL APART ALL THAT IS CURSING THE SAME TONGUE &gt;&gt; AND MANY OF US WE COME TO CHURCH AND LISTEN, IF YOU see us in church, and this is why I say thank God we can't see everybody doing the weekend over punch. THE PROPHET OF GOD HAD THE ABILITY to see through the facade &gt;&gt; is the Oscars is the one with acting. &gt;&gt; Trinidad in particular, for those online, I'm speaking to Trinidad. I'm speaking to the local church. &gt;&gt; We have the consecutive Oscars every year. They don't even have to vote in because we good at the God bless you. How you doing? I love you. Oh, God. appreciate you and behind that behind that appreciate if you translate that and you see behind the veil what going on in the mind and the HEART IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT thing &gt;&gt; with the SAME WAY THE PERSON GONE SOON I SH BUT I DON'T deal I don't deal with YOU KNOW &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY 5 MINUTES I just shake him because you know we supposed to shake hands &gt;&gt; we have TO BE SO CAREFUL FUL BECAUSE AND and I've realized it more and more there are things I do not comment on &gt;&gt; even if I disagree WITH IT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE TEACHING THAT Gama give was if it is of God it will be of God &gt;&gt; if it IS NOT OF GOD IT WILL FALL APART FOR ITSELF WE HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ON the matter God is the JUDGE HE'S THE ONE MARKING EVERYBODY PAPERS I AM NOT AUTHORIZED TO MARK NOBODY PAPERS GOD IS THE JUDGE HE IS JUDGE HE IS LAWYER he is king of kings he's the high PRIEST OF OUR CONFESSION. WE COULD NEVER STEP INTO GOD'S PLACE TO COMMENT ON ISSUES THAT ARE NOT OURS TO COMMENT ON. HE IS THE ONE THAT JUSTIFY. HE IS THE ONE THAT FAILS. HE IS THE ONE THAT SAVES. &gt;&gt; AND THE PRECEDENT IS ALL THROUGH SCRIPTURE BECAUSE WHEN SAUL became Paul the Apostle, people in the church had issues with him &gt;&gt; because brother STEVEN WAS A PRECIOUS BROTHER. HE WAS A DEACON IN THE CHURCH AND PAUL WHEN HE WAS SAUL SUPERVISED THE KILLING OF HIM. And when he walk in the church and say watch him and put HIM IN THE BACK IN THE CORNER they put two deacons watch him BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT what this man do &gt;&gt; don't give me the right hand of fellowship give me the left hand of fellowship &gt;&gt; and people have things to say &gt;&gt; and many time and this is why we always say as a parent I'm trying to get out of here &gt;&gt; as a parent George do I'm under author authority. As a parent, we have to be so careful what we say about other people's children &gt;&gt; because you don't know WHAT COMING TO YOUR HOUSE. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT COMING TO YOUR HOUSE &gt;&gt; AND WE FEEL THE LIBERTY TO SAY IF she they do this and if he they do this is GOING TO BE HOW YOU KNOW IT GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; THE ONLY THING WE could rest on is what the word says. Amen. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RESTING ON THAT. THE PROPHET, I'M RESTING ON THAT. &gt;&gt; WE CAN ONLY REST ON THE WORD, BUT PEOPLE HAVE THE THE AUDACITY TO COMMENT. &gt;&gt; And especially in Trinidad, this is one of the most disrespectful countries. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you from authority traveling the world, brother George, you see people in different customs, traditions. You have people who by their very nature, they're very respectful. They're very courteous. In some ways we curte. You go to SOME COUNTRIES NOBODY SAY GOOD MORNING. NOBODY SAY HELLO. EVERYBODY PASSING YOU AS IF YOU DON'T EXIST. HERE THE AVERAGE PERSON. HEY GOOD DAY. WE EVEN DOUBLE IT. MORNING. MORNING. &gt;&gt; HOW YOU GOING? OKAY. WE HAVE ALL KIND OF THING WE DO. SO IN THE ONE HAND WE HAVE A LEVEL OF COURTESY BUT DISRESPECT. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAY GIVE RESPECT TO THOSE THAT RULE OVER YOU. &gt;&gt; But no we shoot it on the government. It don't matter which government you belong. By the time we done with you in Trinidad, &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S NOT A BIBLICAL PRINCIPLE. WE DEALING WITH BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES. THIS IS WHY OUR CONDUCT, OUR BEHAVIOR SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN THE MAN ON THE STREET. &gt;&gt; THE NEIGHBOR TALKING ABOUT THE PRIME MINISTER, I NOT GETTING INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATION. THE ONLY PRIME MINISTER I TALKING ABOUT IS THIS ONE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS ONE DON'T TELL A LIE. THIS ONE &gt;&gt; WHEN HE SAY I DOING SOMETHING AND HE PUT IT ON THE WHAT HE THINK THE MANIFESTO WHEN HE PUT IT ON THE MANIFESTO I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT THE MANIFESTO TO SEE WHAT WAS THERE WHATEVER HE PUT IN THE MANIFESTO COMING TO PASS &gt;&gt; HE SAID YOUR CHILDREN COMING IT COMING TO PASS HE SAID I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU IT COMING TO PASS YOU DON'T HAVE TO WONDER EVEN THOUGH THE MANIFESTO IT'S COMING TO pass &gt;&gt; are we together THIS MORNING &gt;&gt; SO I WANT TO CHALLENGE US THIS IS NOT A REBUKE IT IS AN ENCOURAGEMENT MENT TO us to say the right thing &gt;&gt; AND MORE IMPORTANTLY BE VERY SENSITIVE ESPECIALLY YOU WHO ARE older and certainly include myself now correct I'm not as young as I used to be &gt;&gt; is it edifying &gt;&gt; is it helping &gt;&gt; how is it helping is it encouraging when somebody finish talk with you do they leave feeling inspired or they feel heavier &gt;&gt; because you just offload you you know brother over there say you pull up the garbage truck and I just offload LORD, HE SAID NOT HERE. NOT BY THIS HOUSE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But say when he call him and have to offload, he say hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up before you continue, &gt;&gt; there's some things you have to take to the Lord. &gt;&gt; But it should be if somebody have a conversation with you, you are closer to God, not further away from God. &gt;&gt; Closer to one another. &gt;&gt; This why brother Brandon said many times, don't just receive something against your brother. HOW YOU SUPPOSED TO LOOK at your brother if all you hearing is 29 reasons why that is not a good brother? &gt;&gt; Because you will look at a person funny. &gt;&gt; Are we together this morning? &gt;&gt; So I want you to make a commitment and a pledge as we go forward as the brothers get ready to put on the tape that we should speak better. &gt;&gt; You don't understand something, pray about it. &gt;&gt; Ask the right person the question. You don't go to the chief gossiper in the church. &gt;&gt; Now I don't know who that is. That is not an official position. That's an unofficial position but a punch every church have and I'm not launching no commission of inquiry to find out who it is but every church have a chief gossiper every company have a chief gossiper there's somebody you could go to in every place and find the person who they love to just live on the information who marriage in trouble who this who had no money who do THAT AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU GO TO THEM YOU HAVE EVERYTHING AND EVERY WAY THEY COULD PULL AND ASK AND PROB AND COME TO CONCLUSION IS A SPIRIT BUT IF WE destroy it, because when the Bible says Satan will be bound a thousand years, but the man said that's bound by chains OF CIRCUMSTANCE IN THAT HE HAS NOBODY TO USE. &gt;&gt; So if he cares BROTHER GEORGE AND HE CAR SISTER ROSEMARY AND THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES IN THE HOUSE, HE HAS TO FIND THE NEXT HOUSE. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME this morning? AND IF YOU COME TO THIS CHURCH AND THE CAR USE THE DEACONS AND THE CAR USE THE MINISTERS AND THE CAR USE EVERY BROTHER AND SISTER. HE WAS SAYING NOT THIS CHURCH. I NEED TO FIND ANOTHER CHURCH BECAUSE I HAVE NO ROOM. I HAVE NOBODY TO USE. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? CAN WE GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT OF PRAISE? LET'S ALL STAND TO OUR feet as we switch to hearing our pastor this morning. God richly bless you. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You're welcome back to the evening service. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to say a big welcome to all the brothers, the pastors and ministers and brethren that just arrived this afternoon. &gt;&gt; We're happy to be together. One more time. Amen. You're welcome. And tonight uh our speaker is Pastor J. [Applause] [Music] I don't need to ask you if you appreciate Bio. [Applause] You can't believe the seven without appreciating brother [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] So I can hear the sound of abundance of rain. Hallelujah. Amen. I told you this coming I think it's long overdue. Uh but it happened in the right time. &gt;&gt; But um I thank God for the ministry that God gave to our dear brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; And um I I thank brother Olu for hosting the convention in 1993. [Music] That convention in 1993 to me was very outstanding &gt;&gt; and um whatever you see going on is from that meeting &gt;&gt; in 1993 and um you know you can go to conventions and be blessed &gt;&gt; and you know God does so many things. You take whatever you know you have need of and you just take your blessings and go. &gt;&gt; You see but something happened. We have finished the convention 1993 and brother Olu took us to Sheraton for um you know the minister's banquet and we're all there. We ate, we enjoyed ourselves and then the overseas ministers came to um you know encourage us the Nigerian ministers and um all the all the ministers came one after the other. They spoke you know encouraging us to unity and um how we can we should you know try to accommodate one another and so forth and forget our differences you know it spoke so many things. So and then brother Oid stood up where he had a microphone he was given a microphone he stood up and then he said he said you know it's easy he said Nigerians ministers he said it's easy to love somebody who is far it's very easy to love somebody you don't see every day you see him oh my precious brother you know you so much love him he said but how do you know you have love he said when you love somebody you see every day. &gt;&gt; He said you got to learn how you love how to love somebody. You wake up every day and you see that person. So when he spoke that word and then he said Nigerian ministers write one another, call each other on phone, visit one another, preach for one another. To me that was a seed I took from that convention. [Applause] And when we come back to after the meeting, we return to we return to our local churches. We come back here. Then I decided to make use of what I got from that meeting. &gt;&gt; I made up my mind. It's not going to go like that. I'm going to make use of that. &gt;&gt; And friends, something started and we begin to break down the walls around us. All the partitions of this and this and that. We begin to break all the walls down. We threw our church door open AND WE INVITED MINISTER AFTER MINISTER. Every weekend we are having weekend meetings, weekend revivals in our church with different different ministers. THEN I SAW THAT IT'S SO EASY. IT'S SO EASY TO ACHIEVE UNITY. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S SO EASY TO ACHIEVE LOVE TO MAINTAIN LOVE AMONG THE BREAD. JUST GET STARTED. DO SOMETHING RIGHT. FORGET ABOUT THIS AND THAT AND how you feel and what he said AND WHAT SOMEBODY SAID ABOUT SOMEBODY. YOU SIMPLY FORGET ABOUT THAT AND GO OVER THE VERSE. BREAK DOWN THE WORDS AND YOU SAID YOU WILL SEE THAT IT'S EASIER AND BETTER AND SWEETER THAT WE CAN OPERATE AND WE CAN LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND WE CAN HOLD EACH OTHERS SO DEARLY IN OUR hearts and we can live above feelings. WE CAN LIVE ABOVE HEARSAYES. WE CAN LIVE ABOVE STORIES. [Applause] That was what happened in 1994, 1995, 1996. Then 1997 we had the first youth convention. In May 1997 and then 1998 we started having this conventions. This is the 28th year. So I thank God brother O is here. Brother O thank you for coming to Nigeria in 1993. and brother Olu, thank you for hosting that convention. It's not in vain. What you do for Jesus is not in vain. So tonight is my privilege to bring to the pulpit God's servant but at your o all the way from Trinidad and I know you're going to be blessed tonight. Don't just rejoice and go back home. Take something for THE MEETING. TAKE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GO HOME AND PUT IT INTO ACTION. GO HOME AND ACT ON IT. THE WORD you hear it is good in the ear, sweet in the mouth. But when you digest it, brother, it becomes bitter. But that's when it forms character. Character is formed in us. So God bless you. Turn around and shake somebody's hand as we welcome God's servant. I appreciate him so much. His ministry has been a tremendous blessing. But Isaac was some such a blessing to us last year and we have wonderful times and I know that this night and in this meeting we are in for better greater blessings in God's presence. So let's sing we shall see the king when he comes. We shall see the king. We shall see it again when he comes. Oh, his coming in power will have a blessed hour. We shall see it again when he comes. Glory. Oh, we shall see it again. You believe that? [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, we shall see the king. One more time. Oh, we shall see the king. Oh, we shall see the king. We shall see. My Lord, he is coming in power. We hear the blessed hour. We shall see the king when he come. God bless you. You may be seated. [Music] Uh I am not a great introduction speaker but uh just to say I'm so glad to be here &gt;&gt; and I bring you greetings from the Headstone Tabernacle Trinidad and it's a blessing and a privilege to be here in this meeting but uh the pastor invited me many many times but I just felt led to come this year &gt;&gt; and my son Isaac was had his tickets everything to come but things didn't work out and he's back home. And I said I didn't even realize that he wouldn't be here also. So I'm happy to put my shoulder to the wheel. I'm blessed to hear the testimony of of brother Isaac uh on his testimony of 1993 and I still feel the same way now that I felt since 199. [Music] &gt;&gt; Walls have to come down &gt;&gt; just as giants have to fall. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I believe in all my heart that Jesus God will will break down the walls in this message &gt;&gt; because we have one enemy. &gt;&gt; We have one devil to fight. &gt;&gt; The battle is still yet ahead. &gt;&gt; And we have to be ready to fight. &gt;&gt; The people in the message have become entitled. They feel that God owed them something and they never writing the rapture or bribe. But that is not what Bram taught. The only right we have is to fight. You have to fight for what you know is your own. &gt;&gt; So when the word comes to you is to give you a revelation of what is yours. &gt;&gt; God the lamb took the book to reveal what is yours. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is here to enforce what is yours. &gt;&gt; And God can't lie. &gt;&gt; If God promise you the Holy Ghost, you're going to get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If God promise you deliverance, you're going to get your deliverance. &gt;&gt; If God promise you healing, you're going to get your healing. One thing we are confident of, God can't lie. &gt;&gt; So tonight, if you want to stand before we read the word, let's pray. Father, we thank you tonight for your presence and for your word and for your people gathered here. We pray you bless those host pastor here, his family, wife and family and church, all the ministers and pastors here represented the people and those who connected live. May your spirit be with them in a special way and bless your word as you read it. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's stand. I have two portion of scripture I like to read. St. John chapter 8 1-11 Jude chapter Jude chapter verse 17 to 25. Reading from St. John chapter 8 verse one. Jesus went into the mount of olives and early in the morning he came again to the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them. And the scribe and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, they said unto her, "Master, this woman was taken in adultery in the very act." Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned. But what sayest thou? This they said, tempting him that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not. So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said unto them, he that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again he stooped down, wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, &gt;&gt; went out one by one, &gt;&gt; beginning at the eldest, even unto the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? She said, "No man, Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. And let's look to to the book of Jude, which is that small book just before the book of Revelation. And I want to read from verse 17 of the book of Jude. But beloved, remember ye the words which Oh, okay. I I'll leave you there. But beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken by before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus. How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lust. These be they who separate themselves, sensual, not having the spirit. But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy fate, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. and of some have compassion making the difference and others save with fear pulling out pulling them out of the fire having even their garments spotted by the flesh. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and forever and ever. Amen. May God bless his word. You may be seated. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise be to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have a title tonight. And of some have compassion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have inspiration. The display of brotherly kindness as a sign of maturity. &gt;&gt; That's what I have. The display of brotherly kindness as a sign of maturity. title and of some have compassion. Praise God. Now compassion is of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Psalm says Psalm 78 says, "Nevertheless, they flatter him with their mouth. They lied onto him with their tongues, for their heart was not right with him. Neither were they steadfast in his covenant. But he talk about God now full of compassion forgive their iniquity and destroy them not. Yay many a time turn he his anger away and did not stir up his wrath. Micah Micah says in verse 7, chapter 7:8, he said, "Who is of God like unto thee that pardone iniquity and passeth by transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He retain not his anger forever, for he delightth in mercy. He will turn again. He will have compassion upon us. He will subdue our iniquities, and thou will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea." So our God is a God of mercy. &gt;&gt; He's a God of compassion. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Okay, let's go. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Oh, let's go tonight. &gt;&gt; What the Bible says, every divine promise in the Bible tonight is yours. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't ever say, "I'm afraid it won't happen." You cannot think that. If God make a promise, he's big enough to keep it. He is big enough to confirm it. He is big enough to fulfill it. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. We are Christians. &gt;&gt; Born again in the same family. A bunch of pil pilgrims. Here we go. We will never see eye to eye until we see him face to face &gt;&gt; and be changed and made in his own glorious image. &gt;&gt; You want to be seated? Do you get that? The prophet said we will never see eye to eye until we see him face to face. &gt;&gt; So the objective is not to see eye to eye. THE OBJECTIVE TO SEE if we could work together in the unity of the spirit until the unity of the faith come forth. &gt;&gt; Oh praise the name of the Lord. Give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Somebody said this here. Watch. I pray that you would help me and send the Holy Spirit and interpret the word that it might bring a settled basis of the eternal God and upon the basis of receiving him that we might get ourselves positionally ready for a great meeting and we expect him to break here and it will not end till Jesus come. Bless every organization in the valley. Bless the people, the ministers and pastors of different organizations. Maybe here we go. We might disagree upon some theological teachings of the scripture. But father in all one principle, we believe in God the eternal one. So help us Lord to have the unity of the spirit until the unity of the faith is brought forth. &gt;&gt; And friends, I say it here, there is going to be a unity of the faith. &gt;&gt; THERE ISN'T ENOUGH DEVILS IN AFRICA TO STOP IT. &gt;&gt; There isn't ENOUGH DEVILS IN HELL TO STOP IT. THERE IS GOING TO BE A unity of the faith. &gt;&gt; Before we get a unity OF THE FAITH, THERE'S got to be a unity of the spirit. And brother Uloo is who preached so much on that. You may be seated. Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; The unity of the spirit have nothing to do with doctrine. &gt;&gt; This is not a doctrinal list. You believe that tick. You believe that tick. You believe that X. &gt;&gt; This is not a list. This is not an examination. This is the spirit of the living God. &gt;&gt; And he said we can't you but one like Coke, one like Sprite, one like orange juice, one like pineapple juice, one like grapefruit juice. All of us don't have the same liking. One like blue, one like red, one like yellow. Whatever colors you choose, WHATEVER COLORS YOU LIKE, THAT'S HOW what made us.

You have something upon our hearts. You have to listen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God gave brother Banham a special experience. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want you to listen to it &gt;&gt; because I feel we should read it. We should share it. You should learn from it. &gt;&gt; This is brother Brown. Friends, there are so many things we could say tonight about perfection. We are always trying to gouge the eyes out of somebody else to make ourselves a little holier than they are. &gt;&gt; But if you look at the picture, it's only God's grace. that we are what we are. &gt;&gt; You hear that? &gt;&gt; I don't care how big the person is or how small they are. Both is God's grace. &gt;&gt; I am here by God's grace. &gt;&gt; You are here by God's grace. &gt;&gt; It's God's grace. We are what we are. &gt;&gt; No study, no whatever make us where we are. It's God's grace we are where we are. &gt;&gt; Listen to brother Mara. here a long time in Ohio. I learned a lesson the hard way. I was having a meeting down in Ohio and I was staying in the country. Uh we we was eating in a Duncan restaurant. Such a lovely waitress and so on like that. And I went over a common American restaurant and I walk in the door. I hear the machine going and standing there was a man of my age, not a married man, with his arms around a woman playing sluck. I turn around in the back of the building. There was a bunch of teenage boys, rock and roll playing, young lady about 18 years, very neatly, a woman, and she was standing there with a dress hanging low in front, one of the boys, his hands on the girl where it ought not to belong. They were smoking and drinking. I look over to my right, I heard someone make a big groan, a set of aged woman, probably 60 years old, and she had vulgar clothes on, halfway up her limbs, poor little old wrinkled flesh, flabby as it could be. She had lipstick, makeup, great purple things, sign of a piece, and across the table said two men drunk. One of them big old army overcoat on. I stood there and I said, "God, why don't you destroy this whole thing? Why don't you just sink it beneath the earth?" I said, "How can you, God, in your great holiness ever stand to look at such a thing like that and not send an earthquake to sink it?" And as I was standing there condemning the woman as I was, I stepped behind the door. I felt the spirit of God come to me and I stepped behind the door. &gt;&gt; I seen something whirling. And when it was, it was a vision. It was the world turning around and around and I noticed that the world was a scarlet streak around the world. And as I got to the world, I seen myself as a little boy doing things that I ought not to do. &gt;&gt; But it was sin. And every time I did anything, I seen a big black shadow go towards heaven, which God could have killed me at that minute. &gt;&gt; And then I seen standing between me and God a perfect sacrifice. I seen him standing there with the thorns on his head, the spit hanging on his face. And every time my sins would start towards God, he would reach up and catch it like a bumper on a car. He would protect me from death. And every time I'll do anything wrong, God could have killed me. His holiness required it. His law required it. And every time I do anything or do anything, the blood of Jesus Christ acts like a bumper. And I seen that scarlet streak and the blood still holds dirt. As I stood looking, I got a little closer to him and I noticed I could hear him say, "Father, &gt;&gt; forgive him. &gt;&gt; He doesn't know what he's doing." &gt;&gt; I looked down and there laid a book. There was a recording angel standing by his side. And every time I sinned, it was put down on the book and my name was on it. And I realized that that blood streak would be lifted. And after standing in the presence of God with my sinful life, but I seen his mercy, &gt;&gt; he was holding off to judgment, my judgment. I went to him humbly. I knelt on my knees. I said, "Oh Jesus, thou son of God, I am unworthy to come in your presence, but will you please forgive me for what I have done?" He touched his side with his hand, took the old book and wrote pardoned on it and throwed it behind him and my sins were gone. &gt;&gt; Then then he looked stern in the face. He said, "Now I have forgiven you, &gt;&gt; but you want to give them her." &gt;&gt; Then I seen what it meant. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. As I come out the vision, I walk over to her. I said, "How do you do?" She was drinking. She looked up at me. "Oh, hello." I said, "Could I sit down?" She said, "I have company." I said, "I don't mean it that way, lady. I just want to speak to you a minute." She said, "Be seated." I said, "Lady, just a few minutes ago, standing behind that door, I begin to tell her, I begin to look and the tears begin to run down her cheeks. She told me, she said, "Lady, you don't mean to do these things. Jesus died and the judgments of God is held off by his blood. You don't mean to do this." She said, "No, sir." She says, "My father was a deacon in the church. I was raised in a Christian home. My husband was a charter member, live a Christian life." She began to tell me after his death, she had two girls and she went astray. How the girls had left her and she throwed her life away and she thought that there was no more hope for her. I said, "God be merciful. Those who he for you, he has called." She said, "Are you Reverend Brandon from down there?" He said, "I am." She said, "I'm ashamed of myself to be sitting here like this." She said, "Do you think there would be a chance for me?" I said, "Jesus has his arms stretched out, waiting for you to come, lady." And the other people begin to take up. I said, "Would you walk here in this floor with me?" She said, "I will, sir." I took her by the hand. I said, "You about the age of my mother. Would you kneel here with me in the floor?" And there in the floor, we broke up that place that afternoon to an old-fashioned meeting. And God saved that woman by his grace. She has dressed herself. She is coming to meeting and she's living a Christian life tonight. Give the Lord a shout. Do you get that story? Hallelujah. You may be seated. What is it? God requires perfection. &gt;&gt; He requires your repentance. &gt;&gt; He requires your loyalty to him. &gt;&gt; He is looking tonight. No matter how much you have sinned, how little or how much you are still a sinner and cannot get in no other way but by Jesus Christ, God all sufficient sacrifice. YOU BUT IN HIM YOU are perfected forever. &gt;&gt; Think of it. It is nothing you do. It is not new pages you turn. It's not a new life you start. IT'S A CONFESSION of your wrong and God grace to you that brings you to perfection. And then you are perfected in Christ Jesus. Oh, glory to God. You may be seated. Give the Lord a praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So if we only look at the picture, it's only the grace of God. We are what we are. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; This is Jesus in Luke chapter 10. &gt;&gt; He says, "Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him." You see, they only want to tempt him. They want to see how they could twist things to get Jesus say the wrong thing or say something out of scripture or out of timing. So he says, "Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" And he said unto him, "What is written in the law? How readest thou? So Jesus is no fool. That is wisdom speaking there. &gt;&gt; And he answered and said uh thou shalt love thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy strength, with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself. He said unto him, thou was answered right. This do, and thou shalt live. So this man know the quotes. &gt;&gt; He press play. He know where it's written. &gt;&gt; He press play. He know what is spoken. He know what the prophet said. the prophet Moses, the prophet Brham. But Jesus said unto him uh uh thou has answered right this do and thou shalt live. And he here we go willing to justify HIMSELF SAID UNTO JESUS, WHO IS my neighbor? &gt;&gt; Love thy neighbor. Who is my neighbor? And Jesus answers it, a certain man went down from Jericho, Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves which stripped him of his reignment and wounded him departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance, here we go. There came a certain priest that way when he saw him, he passed in the other side. Now he he spoke with books, you know, this priest, he made me wear his Bible. When he see the man there, he walk on the other side. Jesus is bringing a parable to them. &gt;&gt; And by chance likewise a Levite priest now and he was at the place came look on him pass on the other side but a certain Samaritan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As he journey came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Compassion is a powerful thing. &gt;&gt; Compassion could change the lives of others. COMPASSION COULD REACH where criticism cannot. WE'LL GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. HALLELUJAH. DO YOU GET THAT TONIGHT? Compassion could reach where criticism cannot reach. &gt;&gt; WHERE BEING JUDGMENTAL cannot reach. &gt;&gt; So this Samaritan journey. He saw him had compassion on him and he went to him and bunged up his wounds pouring in oil and wine. set him on his own beast, brought him to an inn, took care of him, and on the tomorrow when they departed, he took two pence, gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him. Whatsoever thou spend this more, when I come again, I will repay thee. Now, of these three, Jesus speaking, thinkkest thou was neighbor unto him that fell among thieves, and he said, he that showed mercy on him, Jesus said unto him, go and do thou likewise. &gt;&gt; Well, give the Lord some praises. ALL THIS TALK YOU'RE TALKING, GO AND LIVE THAT. &gt;&gt; GO AND DO THAT. &gt;&gt; GO AND SHOW MERCY. GO AND SHOW GRACE. BE LIKE GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; May be seated. &gt;&gt; So among believers, there are two sections in the church. those who are strong in the Lord and the weaker ones and the ones that still getting strength. The Bible said, "And of some have compassion." Of some have compassion and having discernment to make a difference between those who are proud and arrogant and unwilling to obey the truth and those who are weak and ignorant and waver and doubt and keep doing the same things over and over again. So Jude is teaching us and showing us when to comfort and when to confront, when to have the gentle compassion and when to have urgent intervention to snatch them OUT THE FIRE. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THE SAME BLOOD OF JESUS for the strong ones in the church is the same blood of Jesus for the weak ones in the church. Even the ones who we think are our enemies, Jesus died for them. Give the Lord some praises. Give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Even the ones THAT WE MAY THINK IS OUR ENEMY, Jesus died for them. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Do you believe the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can be seated. Praise God. Why are you saying that, brother Oid? Because we have to enter into this bride ministry of Revelation 22:17. The spirit and the bride say come. There is no way we could enter into that ministry without a revelation of forgiveness and the grace of God because that scripture said the spirit and the bride say come. Whosoever will come. &gt;&gt; Oh give the LORD A SHOUT. &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT WHOSOEVER WILL IS? WHOSOEVER WILL. Those that are weak and willing. THOSE THAT ARE STRUGGLING AND WILLING. THOSE THAT ARE BATTLING AND WILLING. WHOSOEVER WILL LET HIM COME. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. THERE WILL BE A POWERFUL BRIDE MINISTRY WITH A REVELATION OF THE MERCY OF God &gt;&gt; and the grace of God. Isn't that right? Revelation says the spirit of bright say come. Let him that hear it say come. Let him that is at thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely. The challenge then is to handle whosoever will. &gt;&gt; Those who are willing &gt;&gt; instead of condemning them. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This message here where this pastor cutting of this one and this minister cutting of this church and this minister cutting of this one. Praise God. But the eyes are here is now open. Praise God. Praise God. That is such a wonderful thing. He stepped out and step in faith to believe he's not the only man. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Men believe they are the only one. They have the only one. They have mighty revelation. They feel they could teach ministers and teach us. What about the Holy Ghost? that leads and directs. There is going to be a unity of the faith. There's going to be a mighty onpour of dynamics. The church will find this brotherly love because I'm PROPHESY WHEN THE CHURCH FINDS HIS BROTHERLY LOVE that mean it will be lost. It'll be something you have to find, search for, BATTLE FOR, FIGHT FOR. I LOVE YOU, BROTHER. I HAVE NOTHING against you. PRAISE GOD. THAT LYING DEMON that telling you I hate you, THAT'S A LIE. PRAISE GOD. THERE'S NO hate inside of here. Oh, give the LORD SOME PRAISES. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. PRAISE GOD. PRAISE GOD. Glory to God. So compassion is not just something emotional, but an action inspired by love. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. COMPASSION IS AN ACTION inspired by love. You may be seated. Matthew 9:36. But when he saw the multitude, this is Jesus, he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd. Jesus himself was moved with compassion. Compassion is doing the will of God but with a heart like God. To have compassion is to feel deeply for others in their weakness and move to help them. Not not your weak. What your soul [Applause] &gt;&gt; that good for you. &gt;&gt; HE SAID LISTEN TO ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That man with compassion. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Even while helping others, we are warned to take heed ourselves. &gt;&gt; Galatians 6:1. Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, least thou also be tempted. So in OTHER WORDS, THERE IS A WAY TO RESTORE. YOU CANNOT JUST DO IT BECAUSE YOU'RE IN POWER. YOU CANNOT DO IT BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE a deacon or a minister or a bishop OR SOMETHING LIKE I SAY TO YOU AND THIS AND THAT. NO. Because men who sometime do that they themselves come and fall. So you have to TAKE HEED IN RESTORING OTHERS. YOU ARE PROTECTING YOURSELF. YOU ARE COVERED YOURSELF RECOGNIZING THAT YOU ARE STANDING BUT BY THE GRACE OF GOD. I remember years ago a brother came to me. He said, "Bro, I will never fall." &gt;&gt; May be seated. &gt;&gt; Fall. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Long-standing brother message. &gt;&gt; I said nothing. He said, "But you can say that." I said, "Not at all." No, no, I can't say that. I say I'm in his hands. &gt;&gt; If he only pull, I fall. I can't say I will never fall. &gt;&gt; I am in his hands. &gt;&gt; He is holding me up. &gt;&gt; He is keeping me up. &gt;&gt; His grace is keeping me. His love is keeping me. His mercy is keeping me. His blood is keeping me. If he move his hands, I'm falling. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think I just have one more with Jesus. This is Jesus. Luke 7. He was passing in a city called Naine. Many of the disciples went with him and much people. And he came night to the gate of the city. Behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Much pe of the city was with her. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, weep not. And he came and touched the fire. &gt;&gt; And they that bear him stood still. He said, Young man, I say unto thee, arise. And he that was dead sat up and be to speak and he delivered him to his mother. This is the ministry of Jesus Christ. Full of grace, full of love, full of compassion. Are we going to see that again? WHEN JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, and forever, &gt;&gt; compassion moves one into action. Compassion doesn't criticize AND CONDEMN. COMPASSION MOVES YOU INTO ACTION TO HELP, to assist. Somebody fall in a hole, pick them up. Somebody need encouragement, encourage them. Let the strong encourage the weak. Let us help one another. Pull up one another. Back one another. Fight for ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE I NEED YOU AND you need me. Give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Oh, turn around and shake somebody NEXT TO YOU. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Glory to God. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY. GLORY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Oh, glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. My God. I'm feeling something moving. Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. You may be seated. You know the story of the prodigal son. Listen, you see sit sit on a minute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have to beg them to sit down. I like this church. I like those people. I like the people here. I have to beg them sit down. They're on fire. &gt;&gt; You know the story, political son. This man have his children. This young son, he been hearing some kind of heavy dub music or some pop music and so on and he want to get away from church. So he said, "Daddy, I want my money now. I don't want to WAIT TILL YOU'RE DEAD. AMEN. NOW, FATHER, FATHER, give him." He went out. First thing you do, he buy a fast fancy car, red. EVERYBODY KNOW HE GONE FAR COUNTRY. You can't text him. You can't WhatsApp him. You can't talk to him. He don't want nobody know where he's at. But man, he having a great time spending his money. He spending his money and spending his money. He have money friends. When you have money friends, they only come around when he have money. And after a while, money run out. When the money run out, the friends run out, too. &gt;&gt; Now, all the time when the money run out, he's still going out and shaking people hand and everything else. And when he land by the big house if people think he living in a big house, no, he was in the band behind the house. So he passing by the big house because money ran out. So he is renting in a band behind the house eating thick food &gt;&gt; and one day Bible said he came to himself. And some of us something have to hit you for it to come to yourself. TO CUT OUT THE CRAP THAT YOU'RE DOING, YOU HAVE TO COME TO YOURSELF. He came to himself and say, "I will arise. I'll go to my father. I say I I've sinned. I'm no longer worthy to be called a son." &gt;&gt; Then he went home. He coming home now. He's coming home. He's coming home. His head down. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be a servant. &gt;&gt; Now, once a son, &gt;&gt; always a son. &gt;&gt; Once a son, &gt;&gt; always a son. Now, he's a son, but he's coming his head down like this. The father looking out EVERY EVENING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE FATHER KNEW ONE DAY HE GOING to come back. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE FATHER KNEW HIS WALK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO WHEN he look in THE DISTANCE SAW SOMEBODY WALKING BUT THAT LOOKING LIKE him that looking like him. Now this is the verse I want to get to. Luke 15:20. And he arose and came to his father be his part. But when he was yet great way off, his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck AND KISSED HIM. OH, WHAT A FATHER. OH, GLORY TO GOD. THIS RASCAL SON. THIS RENEGADE SON. THIS BAD MONEY SPENDING SON. THIS SON THAT SHAMED THE FAMILY. THIS SON THAT MADE NEWSPAPER. THIS SON THAT MADE THE NEWS. WHEN THE FATHER SAW HIM, THE FATHER HAD COMPASSION ON HIM. THE FATHER RAN TO HIM. THE FATHER THAT HUGGED HIM, THE FATHER THAT KISSED HIM. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. HEAVEN REJOICES. HEAVEN REJOICES WHEN ONE COME BACK. WHEN ONE SINNER COME BACK. [Applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I know some of compassion. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So when the son coming back, the father given instructions, kill the fatted calf, make merry, make some good stew &gt;&gt; and some fufu &gt;&gt; AND SOME RICE. MAKE SOME GOOD BEANS. MAKE IT GOOD. &gt;&gt; Watch this. His older brother &gt;&gt; never sin. Never fail. Never spend a bad naira. faithful, never miss church, never miss A SILVER, NEVER HAD A BAD RECORD. WHEN HE HEAR THE NOISE, he said, "What going on there?" &gt;&gt; S's happy, happy, happy. They say, "Your brother come back." He said, "With that rascal come back." &gt;&gt; Your father kill the fatted calf. No, fatted calf. &gt;&gt; Fatted calf. THE ONE I FEEDING every day, &gt;&gt; the man upset for some beef. The brother have problems BECAUSE HIS NEXT BROTHER WILL COME BACK GETTING some beef. &gt;&gt; He stay there and not coming inside. He's next. Now you see these spirits is only exposed when righteousness have TO UNFOLD. WHEN MERCIES ARE TO UNFOLD, WHEN THAT BUBBLY RIVER OF LIFE, WHEN THAT WATER START TO FLOW, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ALL KIND OF ATTITUDES, ALL KIND OF BEHAVIORS BECAUSE HE HE'S A RIGHTEOUS ONE IN CHURCH. He's a good boy in church. But here his brother come back and he get a robe. He get a ring. He get some food. his father to go and tell him, "Brother, all this is yours." &gt;&gt; Like that big brother have no revelation. All what I have is yours. Your brother don't spend his own already. He get enough food. He get a plate. &gt;&gt; For a robe, a ring, a plate of food. YOU KIND WITH YOUR FOOLISHNESS. And all that I have is yours. &gt;&gt; That's an example here. &gt;&gt; And of compassion. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Could we continue? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the random said, "Faith," You may be seated. Faith is based on forgiveness. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; NOW WE GETTING SOMEWHERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW WE getting somewhere. Faith is based &gt;&gt; on forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Where did God put brotherly kindness? &gt;&gt; Seventh age. What did the prophet call brotherly love? The blood for the age. Each age have to display the blood for the age. So almighty God in his wisdom put brotherly kindness in the right place. &gt;&gt; He put the brotherly kindness just under Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So to access Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; you have to come true brotherly kindness. You cannot jump and bypass brotherly kindness. YOU CANNOT JUMP FROM GODLINESS. Even if YOU LIKE GOD, THE WORD HAS TO BECOME FLESH. EVEN IF YOU'RE LIKE GOD, IT HAS TO EXPRESS TO YOUR BROTHER. BECAUSE JESUS SAID, "BY THIS SHALL ALL MEN KNOW THAT YOU AND MY DISCIPLES WHEN YOU HAVE LOVE ONE FOR ANOTHER." AND WHEN YOU HAVE LOVE, YOU COULD SEE IT. WHEN YOU HAVE LOVE, YOU COULD FEEL IT. WHEN YOU HAVE LOVE, YOU COULD TOUCH IT. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. LOVE IS NOT A RANDOM THING. LOVE IS A POWERFUL THING. LOVE IS THE GREATEST FORCE ON EARTH. Maybe sees it. &gt;&gt; Faith, &gt;&gt; not mysteries. Faith is based upon forgiveness. Faith is based upon forgiveness. No forgiveness, no faith. &gt;&gt; Information, yes. Revelations, yes. Mysteries, yes. But no faith. Not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he said that come to pass, he shall have what he said. &gt;&gt; That's the third pull. &gt;&gt; Then he speak about the second pull. I'll say it this way. Therefore, I say unto you, whatever things you desire when you pray, believe you have received them, and you shall have them. &gt;&gt; So, you believe in the have it before you get it. &gt;&gt; Second pull. &gt;&gt; Then he dropped the first pull. &gt;&gt; But when you stand praying, forgive if you have ought against any, &gt;&gt; that your father which in heaven may forgive you or your trespasses. But if you do not forgive, neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. You may be seated. So people fooling themselves in this message with their hate, with their unforgiveness, thinking the win is some rapture. They're going straight to the tribulation with that foolishness. Because we cannot approach God with an unforgiving heart. He said, "If you know you have something against your brother, leave your gift at the altar. Go and make it right with your brother and then come back to the altar and God will send fire upon you." Oh, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. I will say it again. IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE RIGHT to your brother or your sister, LEAVE YOUR GIFT. GO AND MAKE IT RIGHT. COME BACK TO THE ALTAR AND FIRE FROM heaven will come down upon you. THE FIRE OF THE HOLY GHOST, HALLELUJAH, WILL COME DOWN UPON YOU BECAUSE THE ORDER OF THE SPIRIT, FAITH IS BASED UPON FORGIVENESS. OH, GLORY. I DON'T CARE WHAT MIGHTY MAN IN THE MESSAGE SAY. I DON'T CARE WHAT MESSAGE POPE SAY. FAITH IS BASED UPON FORGIVENESS. OH, glory to God. And people have wronged you. PEOPLE HAVE WRONGED ME. THEY HAVE WRONGED US. BUT GOD NOT TESTING THEM. GOD TESTED YOU. GOD IS TESTING ME. GOD IS TESTING US. WHAT WE GOING TO DO? OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. BROTHER, brother words. Now, faith is based on forgiveness. And when we said this morning trying to get the church into a place to where we could really see apostolic times among us, that's what we hunger. It's laid right there before before at the door. We see it but we want to see more of it. We wanted such a flow. It will be help to us now to flow out to others. Now this forgiveness thing is not new. It was an issue among the disciples because in Matthew 18:21-22 then came Peter to HIM AND SAID LORD HOW OF SHALL I MY BROTHER SIN AGAINST ME and I forgive him &gt;&gt; till seven times. There's a big number in that time. &gt;&gt; Peter had a big question. How often MUST I FORGIVE MY BROTHER IN CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; How much? Seven times. &gt;&gt; Jesus say unto him, I say not under the until seven times, but until 70* 7 &gt;&gt; a day, &gt;&gt; not 70* 7 on stone like that 20 year that 20 year vision, &gt;&gt; I'll forgive you accordingly. No. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So forgiveness was an issue with the disciples. And now we come to the scripture which is the host pastor have as the key to the convention in Luke 15:8-9. Which woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one doesn't light a candle? Sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it. And when she found it, she called her neighbors and friends. You may be seated. You know, if you don't want your neighbor to know your house is dirty, you have to sweep carefully. &gt;&gt; You can't just sweep &gt;&gt; and all kind of things come out the house. said, "Oo, it's a long time she have this swept up house. The house is very dirty." So, so if you if you're careful now, you got to sweeping in the corner, sweeping in the corner because you don't want the neighbors to think your house is dirty. Your house dirty, but you're sweeping carefully. But this woman, she's smarter than that. She lost her coin. She don't want a husband come and see her without that coin. She want to find it. So, she was throwing up carpet. She was throwing out mats. She didn't care what the neighbors thought about her. THEY SAY, "OH GOD, she house dirty. She's throwing out everything. The kitchen sink. She's throwing a pot pan. SHE'S LOOKING FOR HER COIN." WHEN SHE FOUND THE COIN, SHE SAID, "HOW I FOUND IT. I FOUND IT. COME AND REJOICE WITH ME BECAUSE I FOUND WHAT I LOST." OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. AND THE PROPHET SAID, "WHEN THE CHURCH FINDS HIS BROTHER LOVE, WHEN THE CHURCH FINDS it holy decency, when the church finds it place in Christ, it will call to the other members of the body." He said, "I don't care if you're Baptist, Methodist, whatever you are. I don't care what interpretation, six seals, half seal, NO SEAL, QUARTER SEAL, SEVEN SEALS. It doesn't know what you believe. IT DOESN'T MATTER. REJOICE WITH me because I found the coin that was lost." Oh, glory to God. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT A BREAKTHROUGH. &gt;&gt; TO BE COVERED with love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When the church finds &gt;&gt; it's brotherly love. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You are be seated. I want to get this. I know brother Isaac spoke about it the honey sticks but I want to bring the context and brother Brandham preaches message blas names and he's talking about the sister had a dream and this dream is connected to the message. He said what if God requires us to receive the holy ghost and I don't have it. So he was talking about Peter say faith first then virtue knowledge and so on like that. He said now God is bringing seven church ages. God is building seven churches for the a bride of Christ. Here is our sister's dream. Now she was worried whether she had the Holy Ghost or not. And when she lay down her husband was reading a paper and she was got upright. She was walking in the floor and she dreamed she was up on a mountain and watch and he be to see it. She saw a large man standing there with work clothes on sleeves rolled up bailing the most pure water she ever seen pouring into this box. This rock box sitting on the top of the mountain and the rock box could not hold the water and boil it out. roll down the mountain, roll over her feet. She was standing right in that stuff. Only it didn't stick to her. And then she asked why the box didn't hold it. The man said that is not water. That is the Holy Ghost and nothing will hold it. And she said now uh she took a big bucket that was full of honey and poured the honey into there. She said no, it will hold this. She thought the box was a rock box. She thought it was going to burst and spill the honey, but it didn't. It finally stuck together and held it. She saw she went down the mountain going to the mountain. She saw five streams and so like that. And then he said, "No more. I picked up the letter. I read it. I saw her dream." And the and then he be interpreted interpret the dream. Now here is the interpretation of the dream. She was dreaming. She was bothered about the Holy Spirit in so much. She seen the box on top of the mountain was the rock confession like Jesus said in the scripture watch and so on like that right he said each church age has a rock confession on up to this rock confession of the loudia here we go you cannot make a holy church there's no such thing as a holy church &gt;&gt; how many people believe this &gt;&gt; so how come this brother church more holy than this one there's no such thing as a holy church he said there's no such thing as a holy church or holy holy organ ization. The Holy Spirit can be preached in it, but in there you would find good, bad, renegades, indifferent, and everything else. &gt;&gt; So an organization will not hold. &gt;&gt; You can't say we got it. None of the rest of them has it. No sir, the Holy Spirit is poured out on individuals. &gt;&gt; Could we give the Lord a shout? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. SO THIS TABERNACLE IS NOT A HOLY Ghost tabernacle. There is no such a thing. Individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost tabernacles. &gt;&gt; They are the tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; but not the church as a body. &gt;&gt; So the body cannot hold the Holy Ghost, but you can. &gt;&gt; You as an individual can hold the Holy Ghost. Now watch this man who was pouring the water was the messenger to the church. Pouring the message into the church. What was the water doing? It was boiling out the trash that was in it. That is what the Holy Spirit does. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO ACCORDING TO THIS DREAM, the water of the word, the water of the message WAS BEING POURED INTO THE CHURCH and it was boiling the trash, rolling it down. &gt;&gt; Why was it DOING THAT? BECAUSE HONEY IS NEXT. IN OTHER WORDS, IT HAS TO BE A CLEANING OUT &gt;&gt; FOR GOD TO POUR IN THE HONEY. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. IT BEHOLD THIS. &gt;&gt; He said, watch the honey represent brotherly love, brotherly kindness, which is this age. I just telling you brotherly kindness, the age we live in. Now, you might say, I shout like brother Neville. I shouted like brother Jones and something like that. But let's let something happen to him. Your heart is broke. It just kills you. We can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another. &gt;&gt; You can't stay home by yourself and get brotherly kindness. You can't shake yourself and boy I love you and look in the mirror like take a selfie or some kind of things. So it can't work. You have to be in church. Somebody have to step on your toes. Somebody have to upset you and whatnot. And you have to say I forgive you. That have to come out your mouth. I forgive you. What do you forgive me? Forgive me please. These are the words have to come out your mouth. &gt;&gt; What sayest thou? Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He didn't say when the church finds uh uh mighty men of God or when the church find teachers or preachers. He said when the church finds this brotherly love. &gt;&gt; He said we need to work with love first. Let me tease a little bit. Ram talk about new heart, new spirit &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit. God give you a new heart because your heart is hard towards God. You have to take a heart switch and give your heart towards God. And you see, I'll give you a new spirit which is a sanctified spirit &gt;&gt; because the spirit you have cannot work with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So the new spirit is to prepare you to receive his spirit. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Question. Is it that brotherly love has to come that we could get to be able to work with charity? Because we have to have something to work with, you know? In other words, brotherly kindness is like that foreast of getting into the love of God itself. And that brotherly kindness has to come on display. And that has to come on display to each other &gt;&gt; with each other. God will set up the conditions just right to see one if you will forgive two if you will ask for forgiveness &gt;&gt; not I see if you make it right first it have that I waiting to see if you come to me &gt;&gt; you know somebody has something against you you go to them &gt;&gt; and say free yourself &gt;&gt; you don't need to hold that against me &gt;&gt; you don't wait I'm waiting to see they come because they wrong me and and you're waiting It come like a h wife pray for her husband and when the husband come back she still want to make demands in him. &gt;&gt; She still want to squeeze him. &gt;&gt; He did wrong things or she did wrong things and he still happened of it over and over and over and over and we have a scripture for you and of some have compassion. &gt;&gt; How do we go past the past? How do we get a clarity of forgiveness without bringing up the person's faults and failures and embarrassing them and shame them? &gt;&gt; So the honey is more than just brotherly KINDNESS TO ME. THE honey represent rightess. &gt;&gt; It represent maturity. &gt;&gt; It represents US COMING INTO ORDER BECAUSE AFTER GODLINESS IS TO BE like God. You would think it would finish there. But on top of godliness, God chown how do we express this godliness but accept through brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; Not the word becomes word. &gt;&gt; The word becomes flesh &gt;&gt; and could take you and pick you up and buy you a dinner. &gt;&gt; The word becomes flesh. Could have compassion AND SEE THE MULTITUDE AND break the bread and multiply and feed the multitude. The word becomes flesh. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOUR WORD BECOME FLESH, you can handle it. &gt;&gt; You could touch it. You can taste IT BECAUSE THE WORD IS NOT IN THE BOOKS AND IN THE TAPES. THE WORD IS ALIVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S GOD'S OBJECTIVE. FROM SPIRIT TO WORD TO FLESH. &gt;&gt; NOW HE WANTS TO BE IN YOUR FLESH. WEAR YOUR JACKET AND PUT ON YOUR TIE. PUT ON YOUR SHOES AND YOUR DRESS. THE WORD MADE FLESH. OH, give the Lord a shout in the house. [Applause] Now this is not something like a gift. You have to walk in it. You have to cultivate it to demonstrate that Jesus did something very unique. You may be seated. He take the basin of water and he come to the feet. Now everybody know that the lowest job in the in that time to wash somebody's feet. &gt;&gt; PETER SAID NO DON'T TOUCH ME. DON'T TOUCH ME. Jesus said if if I don't do this he p say he want a bath now. He want the whole water. He want everything. &gt;&gt; Jesus washed their feet. &gt;&gt; Yes. And then he said this, "You see what I did to you? I am the boss. I am your master. And if I could do that, I WANT THAT DONE TO ONE ANOTHER." [Applause] &gt;&gt; OH, give the Lord some praises. [Applause] I know it have those who would like me to preach about Russia and Ukraine and the vials and the trumpets and the this and the that and that. I'm not here to preach on that. I'm here to preach on what God put up on my heart. I just tell people what I'm not preaching right now. I'm not preaching Ukraine, Russia, Pope and all that. I'm not the Catholic Church and what not. I'm not here to preach about President Tariff and all all of this. &gt;&gt; Putin not here for that. This concerns us. &gt;&gt; We need forgiveness. &gt;&gt; We need compassion. We need to see the MERCY OF GOD. MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, WRECKED, CRUSHED BY CHURCH HOAX. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE BODY NEED A HEALING. &gt;&gt; IS THERE NO BOMB IN GILLY? &gt;&gt; IS THERE NO PHYSICIAN PHYSICIAN THERE? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is it look like a honey won't stick? It will stick. It will stick. We have to want IT TO STICK. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO MAKE IT STICK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I remember a pastor have issues with me and we were in a prayer line &gt;&gt; and he's ducking me, shaking everybody hand and I'm following him. Yes. Talking him cuz he greeting this one. He greet this one. But I am checking myself to see if I have something against him. When he turn around, you see me. Oh, God bless you, brother. I recognize I have nothing against him. He have his issues and because he have his issues that don't mean I have to take on his issues and my issues. I am not buying nobody's fight and I'm not taking on anybody monkey. You know sometimes somebody put a monkey in your back and you to take on nobody monkey. You have your own backpack to deal with. You have your own issues to deal with. Fight to make sure your heart is right. Fight and protect your spirit. Guard your heart. OH GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. HALLELUJAH. As we come down TO THIS HOME STRETCH, YOU HAVE TO GUARD YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; WHY? WHY YOU SAY THAT? BECAUSE THE BULL IS COMING. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; What bull you talking about? The bullet test coming. You know, &gt;&gt; you may be sees it. &gt;&gt; But Abraham one time was passing through a field and he forget there was a bull. It was a killer bull. The bull have a name. The bull have a reputation. It's not bull killable. He just killed people. And but Abraham said he forgot his gun. He said if he only had the gun he shoot human shoot the bull and pay for the bull. But God arranged it that forget the bull and the bull he's in his own thing. He's coming down to kill the prophet and the prophet stood there. &gt;&gt; He felt he's finished. Something came over him. &gt;&gt; Wasn't some mystery, &gt;&gt; not some violence or angel. No, no. Something came over him. He said he felt a love. No fear whatsoever. He said bull. So what's happened here now? He's in the back garden of Eden like Adam. He said, "Bull, I'm a servant of Jesus Christ. I'm coming to pray for somebody. Go back and lie down." And the bull here, here that get it here. I call that bull language. It is a language. You see, you have the evil language and the house language and the roba language. Praise God. We have a bull language that the bull understand. YOU CAN'T BEAT THE BULL WITH MYSTERIES. YOU CAN'T TELL HIM WHAT THE VIABLE BULL IN JESUS NAME. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS BOOK IS? THIS BOOK AND YOU GO in a prophet in Jesus know that the bull not LISTEN TO THAT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE LOVE. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. THE BULL have a language. A language. THE BULL UNDERSTAND. THE LION UNDERSTAND IT. THE ANIMALS HAVE INSIDE IT. EVERY DEMON UNDERSTAND IT. IT'S THE POWER OF LOVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That bull is coming. The bull is on his way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So this church, this Bryant church has to live its virtue. &gt;&gt; It has to come to rightness. Because brother Ram said faith could grow and faith could ripen. He talk about Abraham having what he called he said um the the fullness of believing. I like that terminology. Abraham came to the fullness of believing. So it have faith that could start. It have mental faith. It have spiritual faith. It have faith that could grow, faith that could ripen, faith that could mature and have light on faith. While brotherly kindness is the rightness of that pyramid because brotherly kindness is setting you up that charity could come down. Paul called charity the bund of perfectness to seal the whole building and to seal the whole thing. Praise God to the church in this message. How much of them have come to brotherly love? How much of them must talk about the coin? They don't even talk about the coin. Talking about six seals, seven seals, seven thunders, seven mysteries, new name. You could pack it and pack it and pack it and pack it. But we have to see some life some point in time. We have to see something that ATTRACTS GOD. OH, GIVE the Lord some praises. God told John the one on upon whom you see the dove coming and remaining that's the important part the important part is remain because the dove does land sometime and then take OFF WHEN THE DOVE HIT AND SEE WHAT THAT WHEN THE DOVE HIT AND SEE THE CHARACTER DOVE TAKE OFF SO JOHN WAS LOOKING FOR WHO REMAINING WHAT SPIRIT FALLING AND REMAINING WHEN HE SAW JESUS COME HE SAW THE DOVE coming down upon him and the dove improve him because he was the lamb he had the living faith living virtue, living knowledge, THE FULL VIRTUES ALL INSIDE OF HIM THUNDERING. HALLELUJAH. Lightning voices. He said that's the one. Behold the lamb of God. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. AND ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN ALL THESE VIRTUES ARE READY, GOD WILL PICK YOU OUT AND CALL YOU ASIDE AND SAY, "THIS IS MY SON IN WHOM I AM PLEASED TO DWELL IN." LOOK ONE HERE. LOOK ONE THERE. IDENTIFY WITH YOU. Praise God. Who is your neighbor? &gt;&gt; We answered that already. &gt;&gt; Your attitude towards your neighbor. &gt;&gt; Love God. Like the commandments have love God. Keep the Sabbath day and whatn not. Part of it is towards God and the pastor is to your neighbor. Don't cover your neighbor's wife. Don't take your neighbor's goods. Is your neighbor who's next to you? Who's your neighbor? Oh, praise God. God want the church to love him. So love, brotherly love is the forgiveness the honey displayed and then the cap is ready to come down upon the church. So forgiveness become a key &gt;&gt; to unlock the door of blessings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to get that. Forgiveness begin become the key this highlight in other words to get to the Holy Spirit slot to get to THE HOLY SPIRIT. HALLELUJAH. HAVE TO bust through this thing called prenil. Oh praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the bride will come to maturity. Praise God. If you don't forgive, you get cut off. People don't even know their ought, their grudges cut them off. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But Galatians 5:26, let's see how much time. Are we going good? Almost. Galatians 5:26. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. In the amplified it says, "Let us not be vlorious and self-conceited, competitive and challenging and provoking and irritating one another, envying and being jealous of one another." Oh, praise God. So whenever we take brother godly love truly seek brotherly love, get in the attitude of forgiveness and letting things go and letting things drop, we become a strong church. We become a strong people because listen, mercy is not weakness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus at the cross. The thief. &gt;&gt; The thief. The old thief. Never carry a Bible. Never get baptized in Jesus name. Never read a SPOKEN WORD BOOK. NEVER COME TO CHURCH. A OLD THIEF. &gt;&gt; A real thief. &gt;&gt; No bo. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "LORD, REMEMBER ME." AND JESUS TURNED TO him &gt;&gt; and said, "Today, &gt;&gt; look at THE OTHER ONE. MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE two things. Make a difference BETWEEN THESE JESUS." ONE SAY, "WHY YOU SAVE YOURSELF AND SAVE ME TOO? YOUR OLD TEETH. YOU'RE NOT EVEN REPENTING. You're looking for salvation." &gt;&gt; Make a difference. &gt;&gt; Two thieves on the cross. One say, "Lord, remember me." He said, "Today &gt;&gt; you will be with me." &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow, no. Today &gt;&gt; you will be with me. He said the right thing. The right words come out of his mouth. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Oh, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO, brotherly kindness is a real revelation. You may be seated. Brotherly kindness is a real spirit. It's a spirit of forgiveness. I'm not talking brotherly kindness as a text as a message to preach as brotherly kindness and forgiveness and you're not forgiven and you're not what are we not talking about that ministers could do that I'm not talking about that you may be seated &gt;&gt; all right so we can wrap up now seated &gt;&gt; oh glory hallelujah &gt;&gt; so we want to go to the text that we read this woman that was caught in the very act of adultery you may be seated &gt;&gt; they come to see if they could trap Jesus They come to see if they could get Jesus to questions Moses teaching. &gt;&gt; So they caught the woman in the act. They have it on videape. They put it on Facebook, WhatsApp. Everybody know about her. And I want to show you something. How something can go from public to private. This is public public knowledge. She's caught in a very act. She's ashamed. Her face is down. Her face is low. They only have one thing for Jesus. It is written. We have it in the books and tapes. She shall be stoned. And Jesus do like in your hair. He said, "All right." And the pepper in him, master, &gt;&gt; she shall be stoned. And Jesus come out from the writing and say, "Well, okay. Um, AMEN." &gt;&gt; THAT'S MOSES WORD. HALLELUJAH. GLORY. &gt;&gt; MOSES. MO MOSES GIVE YOU THE WORD BUT BEFORE YOUR STONE BE BEFORE YOU LOOSE YOUR STONES BEFORE YOU CONDEMN the woman I just want you to check yourself and SEE WHICH ONE OF YOU HALLELUJAH WITHOUT sin &gt;&gt; feel LIKE DANCING NOW WHICH ONE OF YOU WITHOUT SIN CAST THE FIRST stone now this is the part I want to get to you Jesus could have watched them in your face see straight through them by resentment and know those hypocrites that was condemning that woman. &gt;&gt; But you know what he did? He turned his back to them. He didn't shame them. This is important now. &gt;&gt; He didn't embarrass them. &gt;&gt; He didn't belittle them. &gt;&gt; He leave them to themselves. &gt;&gt; He turned his back. AND HE BEGIN TO WRITE ON THE GROUND. AND WHEN THEY WERE ALL GONE, AND HE KNEW they were all gone, THE WOMAN HERSELF DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY WERE ALL GONE. She was in tears. She was there with her head down. All of a sudden, Jesus turned. He said, "Woman, I'm going to call this case now." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. CASE CALL. WHERE ARE THINE ACCUSERS? &gt;&gt; Because if you don't have an accuser, you don't have a case. [Applause] Court is in session. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. COURT IS IN SESSION. I COME TO DEAL WITH THIS CASE. WHERE ARE YOUR ACCUSERS? SHE LOOK AROUND. SHE SAID, "There is none." &gt;&gt; None, my Lord. He said, "Neither. Do I condemn thee? Go and sin no more. &gt;&gt; He was sinless and he did not condemn her." He addressed something higher than that. He free her from her guilt. He free her from her past. He free her from her fears. Nobody was there when HE FORGIVE HER. NOBODY WAS THERE when mercy was extended to her. She had was to GO HOME WITH REVELATION. NOBODY HEARD IT. NOBODY FELT IT. NOBODY SAW IT. NOBODY EXPERIENCED IT AND OF SOME &gt;&gt; of compassion. Jesus had it &gt;&gt; and he demonstrated it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO WHY ARE YOU STILL BRINGING UP WHAT YOUR HUSBAND DID? &gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU BRINGING UP WHAT YOUR WIFE DID, WHAT THIS BROTHER DID, OR WHAT THIS sister did? Why you still bringing it up? &gt;&gt; When you going to let it go? &gt;&gt; When you will give it up. &gt;&gt; Your sin, your sin, your sin, your sin. I could tell you one more. The woman at the well, Jesus had to deal with that issue himself. He send his disciples by McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, I don't know, whoever around here. He's sending them to get vitual. He said, "Go, go. I I don't want to leave around with this happening." He's waiting for this woman to come. Hallelujah. The woman don't know who she is. She don't know her name is on the book. She don't know Jesus is the book. So, he know what is in the book. The woman come. Hallelujah. And he begin to give me water. You know the conversation and so on. And Jesus said, "Go call your husband." She said, "I have none." He said, "You spoke well. You had five and the one you're living with is not yours. He didn't open HIS EYES BIG WOO SO MUCH. A man. No, he didn't. HE SAID, "I DID NOT COME TO ADDRESS THAT." He did not come to address that. He said, "Woman, begin to talk to her." She said, "I heard that Jerusalem is a place for people to worship." He said, "Woman, the hour come now is when the true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and in the truth." And Jesus give the big bomb. I that speak to you. I'm he. But I want you to share something. When Jesus revealed himself to that woman, she ran into the city. When you get revelation, you can't walk. REVELATION IS WINE. WORD IS WATER. YOU DON'T GET HIGH ON WATER, YOU GET HIGH ON WINE. WINE JUST MAKE YOU BEHAVE DIFFERENT. SHE RAN INTO THE CITY. COME SEE A MAN. THEY SAID ANOTHER ONE. SHE SAID, "NO, NO, NO. NOT THAT KIND OF ONE. THERE'S A DIFFERENT ONE. THERE'S A PERFECT ONE. THERE'S A MAN CALLED JESUS. COME SEE A MAN. Isn't this the Christ?" Revelation. What did Jesus do there? He never address her condition. He never addressed all how she had lived. Her life was bad. Her life was messed up. What he addressed was her name on the book. And to release her to higher order, a higher life, and she was delivered. Oh, praise God. Oh my, I'm almost finished. We just come up, please. 1 Corinthians 2:6, Paul speaks, "How we yet we speak wisdom among them and are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world." And this wisdom is in amplified spiritually mature Christians. So this word perfect means mature. &gt;&gt; Now watch. Maturity. The ability to accept responsibility for your words, actions, and attitudes without blaming others. The ability to respond to situations with wisdom, patience, self-control rather than impulse. Praise God. That is maturity. No excuses. There are too many people say, "He made me do it. She made me do it. And that is why I did it." No. Responsibility is you did it. I am responsible. I will say to my father, I will get it right tonight. Praise God. Almost done. Ephesians 4:13. Till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we henceforth be no more children. The object is for the children to come into maturity. That we carried away but every man of doctrine but speaking the truth in love that we don't be tossed to and fro. That's the purpose of the maturity that you wouldn't be instable unstable but you will be stabilized by love and faith. I cut and rooted in love. LET EVERY DOCTRINE COME. YOU move with it. You move with it. You're unstable. You're going back and forth, back and forth. So maturity means coming into that rightness. Isn't that right? So maturity, I'm closing it, is reflected in discernment, not just knowledge of the word, but the wisdom to apply that knowledge. And you get in Hebrews 5, last scripture, if you're going to play something softly. For everyone that drinks every milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness, for he's a babe. But strong meat belong to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. The evidence of maturity is fruit and of some have compassion. God is calling us to high maturity. May the Lord bless you. Thank you again. God bless you. This is what I have for you to share. God be with you. Praise the Lord. [Music] Give God praise. Give God glory. OH, COME ON BELIEVERS. COME ON BELIEVERS. OH, THERE IS A LOVE SPIRIT HOVERING OVER YOU.

You appreciate the service today. You appreciate the message. You appreciate your pastor. Oh, glory. and on some have compassion. What a word in due season. We have a note of praise from uh brother Hugh Williams. He said, "I've not been sleeping well as I was getting up four to five times during the night. And after the prayer service on Friday night, I slept through the night until 5:00 a.m. Saturday morning. [Applause] That was a prayer service with a difference. All praises to God. Thank you, brother Isaac, for yielding to the leading of the Holy Spirit from Brother Hugh. Amen. And I know on Friday, Brother Anthony would have messaged me to remember him in prayer with his heart palputations. And by the time the prayer service was over, he messaged me and said during the service, it went as well. So we thank God that he's a prayer answering God and he's a present help in time of trouble you know and if we keep yielding to him and we keep bringing our situation to him and we keep agreeing in prayer one for another then everything will start to leave you all your pain your sickness your problems your issues that's the season we are living in we're in a season of a prayer answering God moving in and out into your home into your family into your life can we give the Lord a hand of praise Amen. But I don't see any written prayer requests uh before the desk this evening. So let's let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. And if you have a request that you have not written as we approach a throne of grace to bring our petitions before him, let's do so by the grace of God. Heavenly Father, we thank you to be in your presence in your house today one more time. And Lord, for Lord, the food that you prepared for us in the form of the word that we could eat and we could feast and we could be nourished and we could be sustained. We could be encouraged. We could be edified. We could be raised up and lifted up to we could keep pressing the battle. Father, we bring every brother, every sister before you, Lord. We thank you that you are a prayer answering God. And Lord, as we come to the end of this service and we prepare to leave, but not from your presence, Father, may you touch each one, may you grant the desires of your hearts, of your people, Lord, every hand that was raised for every situation, Lord, that they may be dealing with or they may have needs of, Lord, we want to remember them in a special way, Father. Lord, may you speak to the heirs of salvation and minister to the airs of salvation. We want to remember our pastor in a special way even now as he prepares to head to the airport. momentarily Lord to begin the journey back home. May you strengthen his body. We have already received testimonies of the service in Lagos today and how it was such a blessing. So we thank you for the gift for the love gift that you are placed Lord in this portion of the body. Father we pray you strengthen your servant. Grant him safe traveling journeys and Lord strength back into his body as he comes back to us. Lord may you bless his wife. with me. May you bless Lord the ministers, the song leaders, the elders, the deacons, the ushers, the trustees, the musicians, the technicians, the Sunday school, the choir, Lord, the helps and the governments. Father, every aspect of the church, may you be with your people. May you grant traveling mercies and bring us back at the appointed time in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; amen and amen. You may be seated for a few announcements. So I have a few announcements and then we have a brief very brief meeting after church to just have a conversation about a few things. So firstly, service continues this coming Wednesday here at the uh tabernacle. Come under great expectation for what God is doing at 8:00 p.m. live here uh at the tabernacle this coming Friday. We have our Zoom uh prayer meeting once again. And I want to encourage you because we're in a different season and um God has a way of doing things that breaks the routine and interrupting our schedules and changing things up. So you don't want to miss any service. Don't take it for granted and your blessing might be locked up in a service. So make every effort to be in every service. So once again, this coming Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. uh here at the tabernacle and this coming Friday, we have scheduled a Zoom meeting at 8:00 p.m. And this coming Sunday, we are back in the house of the Lord at 10:00 a.m. Uh maintenance team group 4, please meet with brother Benjamin Kangali after the service.

Yeah, 5:00 p.m. Uh, on December the 20th, the cost is $150. I believe the menu is on the notice board and for the younger ones it's $80 and we encourage you to register. We'd very much like everyone to be present and it is important for us to know so we could be able to cater uh effectively and make the necessary preparations uh for this. We want to also remind the church of our special upcoming meetings with our guest speaker, Brother Andrew Glover, who will be ministering on December 13th and the 14th of December. We have three services, 3:00 p.m. on Saturday. And on Sunday, we have two services uh at 10:00 a.m. and 4 p.m. Come under great expectation. Don't uh take this lightly or take it for granted.

So, we want to encourage the entire church to be present and we'll give you a bit more details on that. So, may the Lord richly bless you. I'll ask the technical team to switch us over.
