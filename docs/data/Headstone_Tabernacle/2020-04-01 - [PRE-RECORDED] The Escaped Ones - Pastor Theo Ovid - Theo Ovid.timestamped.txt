[22:01] man shall it not been the day when I
[22:04] take from them their strength the joy of
[22:07] their glory the desire of the eyes and
[22:10] that whereupon they set their minds

[22:40] 2nd Peter 1 we have a voice 1 Simon
[22:44] Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus
[22:45] Christ to them that are obtained like
[22:48] precious feet with us through the
[22:50] righteousness of God and our Savior
[22:52] Jesus Christ grace and peace be
[22:54] multiplied unto you to the knowledge of
[22:56] God and our Jesus our Lord according as
[22:59] his divine power had given to us all
[23:02] things that pertain unto life and
[23:04] godliness through the knowledge of him
[23:06] that call us to glory and virtue whereby
[23:09] I give unto us exceeding great and
[23:11] precious promises that by deeds he might
[23:14] be partakers of the divine nature having
[23:17] escaped the corruption that is in the
[23:19] world through lust and besides this
[23:21] given all diligence up to your faith
[23:23] virtue to virtue knowledge to knowledge
[23:25] temperance and to temperance patience
[23:27] and to patience godliness and to
[23:29] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[23:31] brotherly kindness charity and if these
[23:33] things be in you and abound they shall
[23:35] make you that ye shall neither be barren
[23:36] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[23:38] Jesus Christ but he had luck at these
[23:40] things is blind currency a fowls had
[23:43] forgotten that he was pushing his old
[23:45] sins wherefore the rather brethren give
[23:47] diligence to make a call and election
[23:49] sure so if we do these things he shall
[23:51] never fall may God bless his word you
[23:54] may be seated
[23:54] our title tonight the escape once lets
[23:59] that have that the escape once the
[24:01] escape once and you know America started
[24:07] off as a lamb and the Bible speaks that
[24:09] he would speak like a dragon and what we
[24:12] have seen unfold in the inform if we are
[24:15] not writing for the eyes is the
[24:18] dismantling of democracy that's what you
[24:22] see in the dismantling of democracy it
[24:25] has to happen because the lamb have to
[24:27] speak like a dragon and things have to
[24:29] happen to turn a lamb in the dragon and
[24:32] the Prophet said they were raised up of
[24:35] pharaoh that knew not Joseph and Joseph
[24:39] represent freedom of religion see so
[24:44] therefore it will be a force system and
[24:47] take away the freedom from the people
[24:50] freedom of religion and I want to just
[24:52] go back to Revelation chapter 13 and
[24:55] read something from the earth to history
[24:57] said I saw one of his heads talking
[24:59] about the beasts it was wounded to death
[25:01] and his deadly wound was healed and all
[25:04] the world wondered after the Beast and
[25:06] they will ship the Dragon which gave
[25:09] power unto the beasts so the beasts have
[25:12] to be empowered let's continue that's
[25:15] coming and they worshipped the Beast
[25:16] saying who is like unto the Beast who is
[25:19] able to walk with Him and there was
[25:24] given unto him a mouth speaking great
[25:27] things and blasphemies and power was
[25:30] given unto him to continue forty and two
[25:33] months
[25:34] and he open his mouth in blasphemy
[25:36] against God the blasphemous name his
[25:39] tabernacle and them that will have
[25:41] and was given unto him to make war with
[25:44] the Saints and to overcome them and
[25:47] power was given unto him over all
[25:50] Kindred's and tongues and nations this
[25:53] is not skim milk this is the word we're
[25:56] eating you know and all that dwell upon
[25:59] the earth shall worship Him whose names
[26:02] are not written in the book of life of
[26:05] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[26:07] the world not some all therefore all
[26:11] those who will escape that's you know
[26:16] the bride gonna be the ones that gonna
[26:18] be not gonna escape on everybody else
[26:23] going to worship the beasts and the B
[26:25] system watch if any man an a let him
[26:28] here he doesn't leave it leave it leave
[26:30] it on to captivity shall go into
[26:32] captivity he that killeth with the sword
[26:34] must be killed with the sword here is
[26:36] the patience and the faith of the saints
[26:38] and I beheld another beast coming out of
[26:40] the earth he had two horns like a lamb
[26:42] and he speaks as a dragon and he
[26:45] exerciseth all the power of the first
[26:49] beast before him and constantly earth
[26:52] and them that dwell therein to worship
[26:53] the first beast whose deadly wound was
[26:56] healed we should know as pig on Rome to
[26:59] enter Papa room let's continue and he do
[27:01] a great wonders so he maketh Fire come
[27:03] down from heaven on the earth in the
[27:05] sight of men and he deceiveth them that
[27:07] dwell on the earth by the means of those
[27:08] miracles which he had power to do in the
[27:10] sight of the Beast seen unto them the
[27:12] pollinator that they should make an
[27:14] image to the Beast which had the wound
[27:17] by a sword and did live hallelujah made
[27:21] what image unto the Beast and he had
[27:25] power to give life unto the image of the
[27:27] Beast so the image to our power in
[27:29] itself the image has to be given power
[27:32] hallelujah hallelujah and he had power
[27:36] to give life under the image of the
[27:38] Beast that the image of the Beast should
[27:40] both speak and cause that as many as
[27:44] would not worship the image of the Beast
[27:45] should be killed and he causeth all both
[27:48] small and great rich and poor free
[27:52] and bond to receive a mark in their
[27:55] right hand or in their foreheads that no
[27:58] man might buy or sell save he that had
[28:01] the mark or the name of the beast or the
[28:03] number of his name
[28:05] here his wisdom let him that had
[28:07] understanding Kong the number of the
[28:09] beast for it is a number of a man is not
[28:11] been six hundred threescore and six 666
[28:14] it's not something tonight all glory to
[28:17] God to the Bible identify the image on
[28:19] to the beasts or praise God you know and
[28:22] the thing of it is in the beginning in
[28:23] Genesis God said let us make man in our
[28:26] image and likeness hallelujah and God
[28:28] put an image with first created image
[28:31] isn't that right wasn't flesh man yet
[28:33] and God put this flesh man in the body
[28:35] isn't that right that man couldn't feel
[28:37] that man could not fall that was the
[28:40] original man
[28:41] isn't that right and got completed
[28:43] creation with a man that was in power a
[28:45] man that was in dominion because the man
[28:48] himself as a son had a reflect God and
[28:50] to reflect God you have to reference his
[28:52] attributes so he say let us make man let
[28:55] her have dominion over over over over
[28:57] everything that creepeth upon the earth
[28:59] so man wasn't was supposed to be a
[29:01] conqueror overcomer a Dominator is that
[29:05] right hallelujah
[29:06] man was supposed to be in control of in
[29:09] charge of ruling over that was man and
[29:13] God's original intent but through a
[29:15] by-product because Eve was a by-product
[29:18] of the man hallelujah she was that in
[29:21] the original she pulled out of e of man
[29:23] and that became the woman is that right
[29:25] Satan didn't approach the man he
[29:27] approached a woman we know the story and
[29:28] man fell but God promised to restore
[29:31] brains got your gets caught in that
[29:34] God promised to restore because court
[29:36] had a plan the ring right man right back
[29:39] [Applause]
[29:43] and I've got news for you tonight you
[29:47] live in in the verge of the
[29:49] manifestation of the fulfillment of the
[29:52] plan that God had since man fell God
[29:55] always was going to bring back man back
[29:58] to his original condition back to his
[30:00] first created image so just as a piece
[30:02] of an image we have an image that images
[30:05] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[30:09] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[30:11] charity is men right and the mystery of
[30:15] God come down from God as the word of
[30:17] God and the world is being preached and
[30:19] the world come as a seed and that image
[30:22] coming to you in seed form by the word
[30:25] of promises and Peter said by these
[30:27] promises not by these explanation by
[30:30] these promises you have become a
[30:32] partaker of his divine nature but power
[30:36] show total power power after commentator
[30:39] image and we are promised dynamics we
[30:42] are promised charity we are promised the
[30:45] price absolute isn't that right power
[30:47] down Oh hallelujah hallelujah two images
[30:55] going to be empowered you may be seated
[30:58] praise God the ears of the beasts this
[31:02] is the image of God is not something
[31:05] let's continue know anyone who can
[31:08] explain anything you don't have to
[31:11] accept it any more by feet if these
[31:14] things that we cannot explain that we
[31:17] have to accept my feet we cannot explain
[31:20] God no man can explain God he is
[31:24] sovereign he is great and mighty we just
[31:26] accept it because we know he is there
[31:29] and then I our faith and accepting it he
[31:33] brings the response back to us the
[31:35] baptism of the Holy Spirit so the
[31:39] baptism the Holy Spirit comes in
[31:40] response to your acceptance by hate

[1:01:42] because the children are the perfection
[1:01:44] by manifestation till the Lord I shall
[1:01:47] all this fivefold ministry for the
[1:01:50] perfect innocence men flesh man ordinary
[1:01:52] man human be instinct that they doing
[1:01:54] that
[1:01:54] monka perfect man sinful man too perfect
[1:01:58] man they don't understand is five for
[1:01:59] ministry as prophesied by the Prophet of
[1:02:02] William Branham and he's to be fine for
[1:02:04] ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:02:06] it's not this man ministry and that you
[1:02:08] have a great ministry while you talk
[1:02:09] about that that name is Jesus Christ the
[1:02:11] Messiah so maybe phone all together you
[1:02:13] have to be given that you have to
[1:02:14] comment to that but after we put you put
[1:02:16] that upon you there is that a man trying
[1:02:19] a king and my church I'm I choose better
[1:02:21] than anybody else chaired by foolishness
[1:02:23] like humans business that nothing mister
[1:02:25] Jesus Christ
[1:02:26] there was one cap there was one head
[1:02:29] there was one heavier must recognize the
[1:02:31] headship of Jesus Christ
[1:02:33] Oh glory to God I'm not a head of the
[1:02:35] church he is the head of the body called
[1:02:38] a church in that body of fivefold
[1:02:41] ministry in that body of believers with
[1:02:45] gifts with places in that body but on
[1:02:49] top that body Christ alone is the head
[1:02:52] trick of the Lord a shout or do you see
[1:02:55] well I'm saying in all glory to God so
[1:02:58] the early part of our ministry he said I
[1:03:00] said I represent the faith by way of a
[1:03:06] divine gift
[1:03:09] it's a powerful statement
[1:03:12] I represent the faith by way of a divine
[1:03:16] gift TV didn't come into him yet he had
[1:03:21] a gift of healing and that was so
[1:03:26] powerful they taken for Jesus Christ but
[1:03:29] he at was the growth of first full
[1:03:32] second poll purple into the ministry
[1:03:35] Jesus friends where God Himself was
[1:03:37] filled in him that's why you can say
[1:03:41] come to the unveiling of the mighty God
[1:03:43] Oh glory to God and when God was veiling
[1:03:46] him God spoke himself out on books and
[1:03:50] tapes in the form of promises hallelujah
[1:03:53] and we catch the promises or the
[1:03:55] preacher sketch explanation
[1:03:57] interpretation or kind of crazy
[1:03:59] revelation but what we see as promises
[1:04:01] so when you come to church all you want
[1:04:03] to hear is what your promise you want to
[1:04:05] hear what your heritance is you want to
[1:04:07] hear what your call on truth you want
[1:04:09] hear what they're here for what you must
[1:04:11] enjoy what you must clean what you must
[1:04:13] pull down you know you have a bacchanal
[1:04:14] and confusion and talking other people
[1:04:16] business you know here for that I am NOT
[1:04:18] here for that we have to speak as the
[1:04:20] Oracles of God Oh glory to God when we
[1:04:23] speak you have to speak for God to the
[1:04:28] escaped ones or give the Lord a shout
[1:04:31] that's the promise you know hallelujah
[1:04:36] yes prophetic utterance we'll go out to
[1:04:40] the escaped ones hallelujah you wouldn't
[1:04:42] want to miss a service because I don't
[1:04:44] know what God want to say you don't know
[1:04:46] what call wonders speak because cork
[1:04:48] honestly by direct inspiration it's not
[1:04:50] just the course we're quoting here is
[1:04:52] the Spirit of God coming and speaking to
[1:04:54] you because once more the world will get
[1:04:57] direct from God or glory God direct from
[1:05:00] God God speaking directly to you when
[1:05:02] you leave here you're no God talk to you
[1:05:04] or glory they're gonna get that directly
[1:05:06] from the Lord
[1:05:07] oh my my my my my
[1:05:11] hallelujah so but he said I call you a
[1:05:14] long time ago before the fog in the
[1:05:15] world and God sent Jesus to make that
[1:05:19] inheritance real to me because there was
[1:05:21] nothing I could do but inherited there's
[1:05:24] nothing I can do but in the fullness of
[1:05:26] time God sent his own good time Jesus
[1:05:28] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[1:05:30] the world his blood was shed that I'm a
[1:05:33] Gautam inheritance to be walked whatever
[1:05:35] it has the sonship to be a son of God
[1:05:39] not remember that's Courtney a little
[1:05:48] bit right
[1:05:49] Moses people children in Israel God's
[1:05:52] people pillar of fire they come out on
[1:05:54] its own right so go get them prophets
[1:05:56] they have the word they have the law
[1:05:57] from Malachi to Matthew hundreds of
[1:06:01] years no prophet here comes John the
[1:06:04] Baptist repent by that time one hundred
[1:06:08] years fast then fellows are tall hats
[1:06:10] long gowns nice little and beards nice
[1:06:14] Tabernacles on temples and so on nice
[1:06:17] traditions and so on people respect them
[1:06:19] or whatnot
[1:06:19] here come a man that Zechariah his name
[1:06:23] is Johnny yeah how a man with camel skin
[1:06:25] blastin bring forth fruit meat to
[1:06:28] repentance and blessing them if our sees
[1:06:31] new something happening because that
[1:06:32] behavior is auto-sync
[1:06:34] but what their custom with they say I

[1:06:39] look for another see me I not me there's
[1:06:41] one standing among you the whole Harlan

[1:06:53] see the stuff coming and resting on
[1:06:55] remaining that's a Messiah Jesus he is
[1:06:58] watching what's happening he had to wait
[1:07:00] for his time he came out of all a mess
[1:07:02] I'm Jesus until everybody I'm Jesus
[1:07:05] he can't introduce himself John have to
[1:07:07] introduce him and we have to be made for
[1:07:09] the Messiah
[1:07:10] so geez had a whiff of John to start to
[1:07:12] preach and John the time and have to be
[1:07:14] just right and then all of a sudden Holy
[1:07:17] Spirit tells Jesus
[1:07:17] move now he stand in line to be
[1:07:20] baptizing anybody else I'm John baptized
[1:07:22] on
[1:07:23] when you see Jesus he said I said you
[1:07:25] should baptize me he said that might be
[1:07:26] so but it behooves us to fulfill all
[1:07:28] righteousness I'm John baptized he said
[1:07:30] behold the lamb of God then the elect
[1:07:33] among John disciples stopped following
[1:07:35] John and instead the follow Jesus
[1:07:37] because the neutron was introduced Jesus
[1:07:40] John Scylla disciples but this guy is
[1:07:43] following Jesus no because they know the
[1:07:45] Messiah or glory that God but Jesus fine
[1:07:48] a lot of priests so qualified fooling
[1:07:49] them days you who so-called custodians
[1:07:52] of the wood in those days they have the
[1:07:53] books that the tips of the scrolls your

[1:08:14] I was going I wouldn't on a platform and
[1:08:16] people welcomed me I thought I get
[1:08:19] enough love to shake my hands but is
[1:08:22] that real yeah that really you the Holy
[1:08:26] Spirit led him into the wilderness to
[1:08:27] overcome Lucifer
[1:08:29] one-on-one private trial to overcome the
[1:08:34] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride
[1:08:36] of life to overcome himself a lot of
[1:08:40] people that they don't have the internal
[1:08:42] power

[1:08:48] self today's by the moat fly loosely get
[1:08:51] temper they carry on because they don't
