to 14 and then 55 to 60 and we also want to go Numbers Chapter 13 one verse there ver 30 So reading Genesis chapter 24 read in verse 12 this is elazar praying because he was sent by Isaac to get a bride for uh get for his to get a for Isaac and he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham Abraham sentiment I pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham behold I stand Here by The Well of water and and the daughters of the men of the city come to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou was appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou has shown kindness unto my master and we go down to Genesis 24:55 this is after Rebecca did uh what Abraham what Eliza prayed about and ler is now is a home of Rebecca's family it says verse 55 and her brother and her mother said let the damel abide with us for a few days at least 10 after that she shall go and he said unto them this is elzar hinder me not seing the Lord that prospered my way send me away that that I may go to my master and they said we will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth and they call Rebecca and said unto her will thou go with this man and she said I will go and they sent her away and they sent away Rebecca their sister and her nurse and Abraham servant and his men and they blessed Rebecca and said unto her th our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed put possess the Gate of those which hate them our last scripture from numbers chap 13 1 verse verse 30 and Caleb Still the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it father may you bless your word tonight in Jesus name I ask it amen praise the Lord amen well I trust you had a great week tonight this ending Friday is a a Friday of Thanksgiving

doing have your way tonight we pray in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen praise the lord we have to begin to thank God and worship him and appreciate him and love him without even asking him for anything because he is good and he is God Amen okay so tonight just for a few moments I have something to share with you cross over don't be borderline it's your decision cross over don't the borderline it's your decision now we find out that the journey that Israel took the journey we have that God put in our lives the journey was out of Egypt and to this Promised Land the land of Canaan that was natural and type okay we come out of the world and we are seeking a c who making buers God we are pressing know towards this thir Exodus out of this world the prophet speaks he says here you know what's the matter with the church today don't get in the spirit enough we are too much in ourselves if you get out of yourself long enough we get in a regular routine who cares about your routine I wish you get out of the routine long enough to get save anyhow get Sav get out of the routine we don't care about the routine get in this Spirit then you can see things done and this is the trouble today people just natural ordinary going to church go back home have no burden have no concern just in the message routine now let's go don't you do not want to be mistaken Satan has a power and that power is De he has a power of De Satan is the one who takes your life listen when God will let him do it but God can hold your life and Satan cannot take it until God lets him do it he can only use that power of God will let him use it isn't that wonderful and I find this is so so powerful so people do this and do that and then somebody dead no doesn't work so God have to allow Satan to take someone's life he had power talk about Satan and the power of death but he has no power beyond that just death ends his power after death here we go Faith sees the resurrection a god of Resurrection That's The Power of Faith to believe so he is standing listen tonight behind every trial every son that cometh to God must first be tried scor chastised and if you get a little heartache after you get born again a little trial that upsets you somewhere and you run back into the world it shows you wasn't a child to begin with you become a legitimate child not a child of God if a man once anchors his heart against the heart of Calvary all devils in hell will never Shake him no more he claims God so a man who cannot stand chastisement is a illegitimate child he claims God to be his father when he is not just tossed by every B of Doctrine not stable so when somebody not stable everything tossing them and whatnot they don't know where they standing they don't know what they're talking about but when a man is Born Again of the spirit of God he knows exactly where he's at now listen to this part they came to kenish Bania and this Kish Bania is where they sent out these 12 Spies and we know the story just in summary 10 of them brought a negative report K and Joshua came back afterwards and of course the whole Camp that's what a spirit does a spirit that comes into the church a spirit comes into a family Spirit come to our business a SP come to any environment negative Spirit it it it actually multiplies and affect others and there are people that recipients of negatives so Caleb and Joshua came back to meet the whole Camp of Israel in a negative mode a depression mode zoomed out zoomed in the own world and that's what K say let us go up at once and possessed that land it was as something in K's heart he brought word that was in his heart so this is the prophet saying you know when they come they were the border of the promised land and God wanted to confirm to them that this third P third phase this Dynamics and the mechanics all this power is correct it is what is Promised bring back evidence to the people so Caleb and Joshua brought back big grapes and evidence but the people who saw the grapes taste of the grapes and came back they say we can't take it because we saw giants and here they were on the border of the promised land you say hallelujah on the border and here's where they made a bus big mistake they stopped at the border let me say you say to you tonight I love you but there's too many borderline preachers today staying on the border God Don't Want You On the Border cross over and I have you get all in the promise is just beyond we find out that we have a lot of borderline preachers here we go that will preach just part of the truth and won't accept the rest of it all believers Brethren God doesn't want us on the borderline he doesn't want a borderline Pastor he doesn't want borderline Believers and borderline Believers is people who are on the edge they're not all in they're not all in to God they're not all in in serving God loving God they're not all in in putting their fear share and do in the church they're not all in but God want you all in he want to cross Jordan that's Deb that's the what you that debt is debt to what you think what you feel what you experience what your history is the background of your family and how you know you're shy or you're strong or you're bold it doesn't matter what we need to do is have a decision in our hearts to Cross Jordan and I'll show you why all right we find out if you are living on the board tonight come on over cross over Jordan there are great GPS over dear he said we got Joshua and calebs that went over the border and brought back evidence that the land is a good land the Full Gospel the Bible Divine Healing rejoicing happiness peace everything that the Bible promis every fruit is in this land it is yours at the asking but the first thing you have to do is to Cross Jordan so this is not a land to look by binoculars not a land to say a piece of paper and land no no no and we by Fai no no no there's a Jordan to cross you can't stay over there in the wilderness and expect to get it because the grapes don't grow like that over there so watch this now he said to send spies out each one of them of the 12 sent them across and 10 of them said we can't do it so this 10 is in the multitude so I want you to understand the multitude shoes are negative 10 out of 12 we can't do it so if you a person with Shifty eyes looking to the left looking to the right see how this one moving and that one moving everybody moving so you have no Revelation if you follow everybody moving so you have to get a revelation of what God promised and what God have said CB said we can do it that's true like for Jericho they have wall of the people so big but you see 10 of them with teans they were looking at what they could see intellectually but Caleb and Joshua was looking at God's promise and God told the prophet to write let us stand like Joshua and Caleb stop looking at your feelings at your conditions at your situations and and things around you with your eye taste smell SM touch whatever around you and look to what God promised I already given it to you you go and take it and that's what the matter with people tonight in Divine Healing it's yours God promis you to walk Breen you believe it you have to take it God promis you life brother do you believe it take it God promis you Joy brother do you believe it take it I will give it to you it's yours now here we go it wouldn't be right for God to go and Dish all the things out he give them the land they have got to do some house cleaning it is yours but he ain't going to come and poke it down your neck you have got to take the land yourself he give it to you and it is you your rise and possess it and this rise and possess it is also a choice and this I is a choice and he said hallelujah it's your choice and that is what if you want to murmur like the others then did you'll wander in the wilderness a long time longer till tomorrow night still sick but if you're ready you take it tonight it's yours what kind of choice you're going to make I will take Jesus on his promise and tell the Devil he's a liar now you notice the Bible said the spirit speaks expressly in the latter days some shall depart from the faith in this message given he to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils and they be lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God so even though God said the promise is ours and go take it there's a process to go and take this thing and Joshua knew that God promised the land before them so he told them sanctify and get ready for we are going to cross over and how I thank God that we get a little a little once a month pray and fast and you feel free to do more than once a month but it's is to hold things steady because Jesus said not if you fast but when you fast he says sanctify yourselves and get ready we're going to cross over so it's not cross over and anything goes cross it's not like that if there ever was a call to the church to sanctify yourselves and get away from the things of the world we are ready to cross over there's the point if you figure you have still your glue up in the world and you still want stuff out there then you don't want to commit to make a decision to drop everything and cross drop everything sanctify yourself that's a choice you have to make the pastor can make it for you the church can make it for you your husband or wife can't make it for you you say are you ready tonight to throw away sanctify yourself from all unbelief this is your choice are you ready to sanctify yourself to you people tonight if you can't have faith enough let's move on towards Jordan tonight maybe you have never passed this way before let's pass this way tonight you say I never did it before I'm going to try tonight this all go in know words stop thinking about you and what you want and your family and what the church is and church not with you and this and that and you have this issue and all kind of that's foolishness that is only your human Spirit you will not fac no Lions then you go to cast you no Lake um the fiery furnace what test have you been through it's just you and yourself you and your pride you and your selfishness you and your own desires all right but said this here no was them no one never knows what those Visions does to me they are awful harder than me and he's speaking about his own visions and stuff then he said these words so the church is not in its right state yet we have to remember that it is not matured so we just have to linger and do the best we can and there is no one can bring it to maturity only the Holy Spirit as we listen to it and I don't believe it will ever come by man it will have to come by God and you know this is such a powerful thing I have met older folks that are immature men that are immature women that are immature wives that are immature husband are immature fathers mothers immature and the thing about maturity you can't teach it I want think about that you hear people talk tough and it's like good Lord when are they going to get mature to cut the crap out to cut the pettiness out to cut the foolishness out to get a little deeper I'm not talking about spiritual now just talking about natural and and from a natural standpoint it takes mature it takes time and experience for some people to get mature to accelerate that you could understand while uh Paul said when I was a child I speak as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away with childish because it's a different operation you know a child yeah yeah they promise a child and the child wonder he child when the child will get something is a stampede is a is a mash up the place is a car on we all have children and they go to this tantrum and we see Believers put on some Tantrums because they get what they want and how it's supposed to work out they would even Rock back on we know all things work together for good to them that love God they not go in there they are angry they're upset they mad and and everything else all in their human Spirit have nothing do with God has do with in the spirit of the Lord has nothing to do with that it's just Flesh and Blood name to be mature Paul talk about I become all things to all men that by all means I might save some sometime ago I was talking about Paul talk about I know what it is to be hungry I know what is to be full all these things are part of the package it doesn't have to be how your spirit of entitlement feel it's supposed to be so it's supposed to work for you but you have no concern about your brother and sister it's supposed to work for your family but you have no burden for another family and most of the times we have seen it over and over when you help others God come and help you when you bless others God come and bless you when you serve others God come and serve you it's it's it's it's God is just he loves Justice he loves to see the right thing you love to see and give the right reward this is the god I re to amen all right so let's you could wrap this up here so the church is not in the right state yet we said that oh go all right so let it's close now you want to know why I read the script about Rebecca all right so elezar go and get a bride for Isaac and you know what he did he prayed and it just goes to show how he must pray over all things and I'm about to read something that is powerful so hang in there bear with me he said now you know we have been forced to make decisions there's times when we have to come to the place where we have to say yes or no that's just human life there are time where we cannot stand neutral and if God shall permit I don't believe we'll ever be leave this church tonight in the same condition that we did if the Holy Spirit shall come and do his work among us we are forced to say yes or no we cannot remain the same this is the BM I'm going to read here now you see God don't make all of our decisions this is the B so you waiting on God you won't God show you this God show you that show you the other and God waiting on you to see what decisions you would make God Don't Make all our decisions and there are many times that God doesn't tell His prophets just what to do because here we go they they have to make the decision if there is no decision that we have to make just wait every move on God then there is no overcoming on our part and sometimes talk about the prophets they make the wrong decision so the time has been allotted here we go to every man to make his decision whether he's a preacher decision coming to him or a prophet decision coming to him or a church member or whatever more he's got to make a decision now elasa was confronted with a great problem like ministers do there was a lots of woman he could choose from his choice was urgent so he had us to move quickly and he said don't gamble tomorrow tomorrow may never come for you it's the most Rel you talk about investment right people who really concerned about their money and the investment would invest in some fly by nighting just the other day some Fly by Night people Los money a fly by nonsense but no they will invest their savings and their money and something that is reputable something that have stability something have years wrong so he's talking about investing your soul and if people know to invest money in and they want to know that it's a proper bank or whatever whatever whatever to invest your soul and your future in eternity he say invest in an oldfashioned Pentecostal experience it has been time tested and proved to be the truth 2,000 years haven't changed it and the same dividends that was paid off at Pentecost is still being paid off by this film The Gift of the Holy Spirit the power of healing to see visions and Angels appear to you we are on Borderland tonight the Bible said I would all things you prosper and being good health is yours God promis it and the promise to you as good as it was to Israel I have given it to you I have sent an angel before you to guide you into this place and I'm Clos him the same God made the promise of Israel made it to you and he's the same yesterday today and forever send the same signs one of the Miracles he a going to come and push it down on you you're going to have to take it and as soon as you claim it there stand an old Amor standing there kick him out of the way if it's unbelief against us God's word kick it out of the way the promise is yours so tonight friends I want to challenge you to consider making decisions instead of you waiting and you're sluggish and you're slow take action make decisions Cross Jordan and when you hear Cross Jordan tell yourself cross J tonight I going I'm going all in it doesn't make no sense we hang around the bord because only when Joshua cross over God could tell Joshua this day I will magnify you before Israel he couldn't do that before Jonah our inheritance is not in argument and debate with any message believer in this message with no foolishness that not our inheritance lies our inheritance is in the Holy Ghost no man controls that no man has that the prophet said the maturity only the Holy Ghost could produce that so all this manufacturing we are the bride and and I'm the the bride all them kind of a kind of drama that people have been patched up with fooled and deceived thinking they sitting down in some church in the message thinking that they bride because they are there they have been deceived and lied to we have to understand how many of Israel was dear following them 10 ministers saying we cannot take it and Joshua and KB KB stood up there and said let us go up at once not later not next week not next year at once and they were giants there and both sides knew it the 10 who brought the negative new Giants joshu knew they Giants but them saying away with the Giants this is what God promised and I see that same thing tonight God promised a genuine Holy Ghost Revival a genuine breakthrough that will come to individuals Revelation come to individuals you are a majority in God you in your house tonight you are powerful in your little room tonight your knees are powerful your prayer is powerful God is waiting for you to make a decision to say you know what I am now surrendering my entire life to God I'm not looking for boyfriend first and then pray God afterward looking for girlfriend first looking for husband looking for wife looking for money looking for increase and job and everything no I'm putting God first and he will sort things out do you know somehow Rebecca got something that she could respond she didn't even know that she was being inspired to offer that man water and his camels just as he prayed and and that man wasn't an extra man he was a servant he was a so you can't pray about your children specific I know general I'm not a general prayer I'm not talking about bless me Lord bless my family not that I'm talking about specific down to the detail look I'm closing look when he got to the house Rebecca see nothing yet his mother and brother talking all right I recn God bless you and Rebecca is the person but she tell 10 days they have a number at all specific she could St 10 more days he said listen God bless me you know I have no time to waste you know you say send for the dam let us speak she never saw Isaac she never know what kind of house she living in she don't have a clue will you go to this man she say I will go well we have offer you tonight we have an offer for you tonight of Dynamics charity love of God a holy ghost Revival would you go with this man let's bow our head to prayer Heavenly Father we thank you tonight God may you inspire this bunch of people under the song of my voice tonight that their spirit will stood up like how you stirred up those men to rebuild the walls like how you s up the men to build the temple God stir them up the love of many waxing cold gross Darkness covering the Earth and there's a entitlement and a largy and and a sluggishness that is in the message we want to reject that we want a church on fire we want a bunch of people on fire they're going through hell they're going through all kind of Trials and issues one after the other it look like there's nothing stopping but you promise to send your angel before us oh God I pray for them tonight I pray for every husband every wife I pray for the families I pray for the mothers the fathers the young people the elders the deacons the the helps the support those that are here for the first time I don't know but Lord I pray for them I pray that the Holy Ghost will bring conviction where we fail you cannot fail where man fail you cannot fail you're not a man of but lie your word is true your promise is true you promise a you promise to be with a bride not an entitled bride not a fluous bride but a bride that will be Sanctified and separated from the world and the things of the world waiting on a husband you promis Dynamics to the mechanics you promis latter rain the real rain to fall oh God that will produce a church with Jesus Christ walking in it with signs wonders and miracles we don't want nothing less than that we don't want no sitting down Church talking for 4 hours message message message mystery mystery mystery no life no fire no praise no worship no atmosphere we reject that Lord what we want is the same fire that started Pentecost the same fire that the prophet came that introduced because you sent a message and sent a messenger to turn our hearts back to that fire back to the faith of the fathers many have walk away from the Fai Lord they go on in their own thing the doctrines of devils and enticing spirits but father God tonight we want to stay with your word we want to stay with your truth we want to stay with the message of the Y that brings life brings power and goes beyond debt and the power of the Resurrection father God May healing go out tonight may sealings go out tonight May the Holy Ghost pour out tonight right in the homes of your people may they have faith and confidence to know that you are still a revealer and just as Peter among all the disciples could step forward and says th the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus respond and said Flesh and Blood have revealed it unto you father May the same spirit that reveal Revelation to Peter reveal yourself to each one go beyond their fault and see their needs go beyond their failures go beyond their fear years go beyond their sins and bring forgiveness and restoration bring healing and deliverance bring your power Lord and bring such a supernatural unction in their hearts tonight as they pray that the fire of God will be in their homes and will hear testimonies of what you are doing amongst them granted God I commit them Li into their hands in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless your Saints just remember God cannot make the decisions for you you have a choice and God called The Prophet you know the tongues and interpretation came because that was chosen you have walked in your own choos you have picked the precise decision it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion heaven will awaits to and he said this in itself is what will bring to pass this tremendous victory in the love divine Rebecca made a decision Eliza made a decision Joshua make a decision Rahab made a decision what is your decision tonight to be a church member or to be a LC person L home or to get out of your flesh and human spirit and get on fast for go may God bless you as we get on in prayer tonight may God be with you and we look to him tonight let's go straight into the worship of the Lord praise the Lord [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

the decision for you and I'll give give you an example that if you have a tire and you know the tire going down you have a little on it sometime people want to run the tire down to as close as possible what you call pun face you don't want to buy the tire yet now if you make a decision to purchase the tire on time and change that tire then the driving goes smooth if you don't make that decision and mov by feet with a tire that barely have grues on it then you could end up in a real hassle shut down with a flat tire somewhere in the middle of nowhere because you didn't make a decision that you could have taken so to me it doesn't make no sense letting life and life whims and fancies and situations and people around and Circumstance make that for you you make that decision yourself you know I was thinking about what was here tonight and how Joshua had to Cross Jordan with the people not just the people Crossing Jordan but Joshua himself had to cross Jordan and I was thinking about in the upper room not only Mary was there and Mary Magdalene and Peter and John all the disciples all the pastor Prophet evangelist the whole 5old Ministry and congregation was in the upper room all was the Cross Jordan we still need the C it's a cost it's a price you have no idea what what it is to be a pastor what it is to be in Ministry what it is to be called to serve and the sacrifice that is required whether it's family whatever it is it cannot be a selfish thing it canot be a my own thing it's a sacrifice it's a calling it's a responsibility and to yield and surrender to that call it has cost it's a price and nobody will really know you the congregation people wouldn't really know what it cost cost for someone who have committed and surrendered to serve the Lord and to serve his people it's a price and it's harder on the minister because he has some serious decisions to make not everybody would agree not everybody would support but he still have to make decision can I please everybody that fleshly people carnal people selfish people um natural people all kind of people and they come to church and you still have to minister the word of minister to his people with the love of Christ and the concern of God with compassion and with mercy and and extent to them and everything else we choose not to Broad beat and be uh be be terrible and manipulative and controlling we choose to to to to extend ourselves and to present ourselves we choose to shun arrogance and pride and go lying with jealousy and and and and and and have a party with hatred and Malice and strife and these guys we choose that and it's a choice we have to make a choice to forgive a choice to let things go a choice to raise above the fears of the people a choice to look at their struggles and everything else and believe that they going to have breakthrough believe that the parents will make decisions we see parents failing we can't make decisions for the parents the child is in your house decisions you make is your decision because it's your house you can't tell me the child doing this and child doing that no you allowing that you choosing to allow that is decisions that we all have to make and sometimes children don't understand when they get to be adults and they get older and they get their own families then they might get a different picture of what it was to manage a home and a family so may God bless you thanks again for listening but I want you to know not making a decision is a decision you decide not to make a decision and there's a cost that goes with doing that the cost is the consequences of not choosing and making the right decision sometime it costs generation let us bhead heavenly father I thank you for this word tonight and I pray that it will be engrave in your people's heart to see how Saints of old made great decisions Abraham choose to come out lot choose not to look back each one had decisions to make even Jacob he had to make a decision he want that Bo right he had to choose to get that Bo right B necessary and he got it and you say you love that man I love Jacob he wrestled he made a choice to hold on all night long and his he was changed he got a new name go Jesus each one the disciples they have to follow they have to choose to follow Peter even though he ran away even though he denied even though he felt shame and embarrassed and cried and wet he knew the word spoke after converted strength the Brethren he knew he was going to be converted he knew inside was going to be changed oh Jesus let us not rest Lord until inside is changed their are marriages here husband and wives mothers fathers homes longstanding but the change is necessary the Chang is needed not the changes in just going to church but the inner change the inner man to be changed and transformed by the father almighty God may this be a sobering time for each person Lord as we come together this coming Sunday May your presence be preeminent May the anointing Break Forth May the Fire Fall the SAS come with the closing of the altar to burn and to cleanse and sacrifice oh God sanctify the church sanctify lives sanctify the people sanctify the ground may they come to church and knowing they're coming on holy grounds and may the far fall may be such that the minister can't Minister because of the glory of God may be such like when Solomon Lord when he finished the glory fill the Tabernacle fill every house Lord we come with the light into your hands in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you thanks
