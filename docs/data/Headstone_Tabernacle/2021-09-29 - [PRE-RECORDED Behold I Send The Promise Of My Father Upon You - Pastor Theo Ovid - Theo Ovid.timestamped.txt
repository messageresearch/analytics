[15:39] in the spirit by vision the prophet saw

[23:01] father upon you
[23:03] but tarry in the city of jerusalem until
[23:05] you be endured power from on high he led
[23:08] them out as fast as bethany and they
[23:10] lifted up his hands and blessed them
[23:12] and it came to pass while he blessed
[23:14] them he was parted from them
[23:16] and carried up into heaven
[23:19] and they worshipped him
[23:21] and return to jerusalem with great joy
[23:24] and we're continually in the temple
[23:26] praising
[23:27] and blessing god
[23:30] amen
[23:31] we want to turn to acts 1 reading from
[23:34] verse 4.
[23:38] and being assembled together
[23:40] with them
[23:41] commanded them
[23:43] that they should not depart from
[23:44] jerusalem
[23:45] but wait
[23:47] for the promise
[23:48] of the father which said he you have
[23:50] heard of me
[23:52] for john truly baptized with water
[23:54] but ye shall be baptized with the holy
[23:56] ghost
[23:57] not many days hence
[24:00] when they therefore will come together
[24:02] they ask of him saying lord will god
[24:04] this time restore again the kingdom to
[24:07] israel
[24:08] and he said unto them it is not for you
[24:10] to know the times or the seasons which
[24:12] the father put in his own power
[24:14] but he shall receive power after the
[24:17] holy ghost come upon you and he shall be
[24:19] witnesses unto me both in jerusalem in
[24:22] all judea in samaria under the uttermost
[24:25] part of the earth let's pray father we
[24:26] thank you for your word
[24:28] and lord we pray that you will come into
[24:30] it and speak
[24:31] through your word
[24:32] confirm your word with signs oneness and
[24:34] miracles and i'll pour your spirit upon
[24:37] the lies of your people in jesus might
[24:39] ask it amen you may be seated
[24:49] [Applause]
[24:52] i send the promise of my father
[24:55] upon you
[24:57] and have an inspiration
[25:01] holy ghost power from on high amen amen
[25:07] hallelujah but a branham question on the
[25:09] holy ghost
[25:10] i have got to know what i'm doing
[25:13] before i can have faith
[25:14] in what i'm doing
[25:16] why you marry your wife you had faith in
[25:18] her you tried her you watch her you've
[25:20] seen she come from who she was that's
[25:22] the way the scripture is with god
[25:25] that's what makes these visions this
[25:26] spill of fire all these things because
[25:28] god promised it
[25:30] god said so i have tested him by his
[25:32] word i know that is the truth and you
[25:35] follow his word and if there's a little
[25:36] confusion somewhere there's something
[25:38] wrong somewhere because god
[25:41] never did work
[25:43] contrary to his own lord
[25:46] he will never work
[25:48] contrary to his own laws the winter
[25:51] won't come in summer
[25:52] the summer won't come in winter the
[25:54] leaves won't fall in springtime and come
[25:56] against on the floor you just can't make
[25:58] it
[25:59] come on now let's go
[26:00] yes
[26:01] so i've said it last night about the
[26:03] artesian well what in your crop if
[26:04] you're standing out in the middle of the
[26:06] field it's black knight you say oh great
[26:08] unless city i know you in the field
[26:10] i'm lost i know where i'm going give
[26:12] light i can see all the walk there's not
[26:14] unless you slide to the field that's
[26:16] true but the light of the room but you
[26:18] got to know the government
[26:20] you might scream till you could scream
[26:22] no more it will never light up you have
[26:24] to work according to the laws of
[26:26] electricity in order to get light
[26:30] are you with me now
[26:31] oh that's the same way it is with god
[26:34] god is the creator of heaven and earth
[26:36] but he will only work as you follow his
[26:38] laws and instructions
[26:42] so it's not a viking electricity will
[26:44] not float through wood
[26:45] it have a certain material it will flow
[26:48] through and the spirit of god will flow
[26:50] through a certain material also and
[26:52] that's why he have you have you as a
[26:53] tabernacle as a vessel that he wanted to
[26:56] tabernacle himself in
[26:58] do you believe that
[26:59] now watch no it's watch

[45:22] oh my god
[45:23] [Applause]
[45:28] you'll be seated
[45:29] if in the spirit realm god open your
[45:31] eyes among the demons camping outside
[45:33] your home and along the streets you
[45:35] wouldn't leave your home without praying
[45:37] if in the spirit realm you'll recognize
[45:39] all the forces loosed against you you
[45:41] wouldn't take things for granted you
[45:43] would recognize the battle is not yours
[45:45] it was the lord's is only because the
[45:47] angel of the lord and camp around those
[45:49] that fear him that you are protected
[45:51] come on now
[45:52] upon him you hear what i said it's only
[45:54] because the angel of the lord and camper
[45:56] wrong toes that fear him
[45:59] a lot of things going on in the spirit
[46:00] realm you know nothing about
[46:03] him
[46:03] [Applause]
[46:06] you'll be seated
[46:08] what about him said when daniel sought
[46:09] to seek the lord
[46:11] and daniel was praying asking god
[46:13] gabriel was fighting to come to daniel
[46:15] but david was battling backland and
[46:17] brown said daniel stopped praying the
[46:19] angels stopped coming
[46:21] this daniel prayer was bringing the
[46:22] angel
[46:23] so you know what praying going to do
[46:25] when you begin to pray if my people
[46:27] that's called by my name shall humble
[46:29] themselves and pray
[46:31] when you begin to pray the angels have
[46:32] to come deliverance coming breakthrough
[46:35] coming because you calling upon the name
[46:36] of the lord
[46:37] not by your might not by your power but
[46:40] bang my
[46:42] [Applause]
[46:51] so with the holy spirit before the holy
[46:53] spirit receiving the holy spirit you are
[46:54] believing unto eternal life but when the
[46:56] holy spirit comes it is eternal life
[46:59] you are begotten of the spirit of
[47:01] sanctification but never born of the
[47:03] spirit until the holy ghost comes in
[47:06] he's talking about in the mother in the
[47:07] mother's womb there's a bunch of muscles
[47:10] be beaten and so on in the mother's womb
[47:12] but when the baby comes out as life
[47:14] comes into the baby
[47:18] isn't that right but the same thing he
[47:19] said you are begotten at signification
[47:22] all the cells are being built up at time
[47:23] vacation but the holy ghost come and
[47:25] that is life
[47:26] isn't that right you say my dear measure
[47:28] is brother up in holiness nazarene the
[47:31] baptism of the holy ghost
[47:34] is different from sanctification
[47:35] simplification is cleansing which is
[47:38] preparation of life but when the holy
[47:40] ghost comes it is life preparation is
[47:42] cleaning the vessel the holy ghost is
[47:44] filling the vessel sanification is
[47:46] cleaned and set aside for service the
[47:49] holy spirit puts it in service the
[47:51] vessel that got cleaned up
[47:53] so that's all god trying to do clean you
[47:55] up turn your upside down shake you out
[47:57] do your got a good clean and then fill
[47:59] you and then use you for his honor his
[48:01] glory one more ride one more shake up oh
[48:04] glory to god you have one little space
[48:06] in his life to live
[48:08] don't waste it
[48:10] some people to wait too long to
[48:11] recognize wait a minute what his life is
[48:12] about
[48:13] trying to get a house car husband wife
[48:15] or everything otherwise wife there's
[48:16] life behind you
[48:18] and after said what have i done for the
[48:20] kingdom of god
[48:22] okay
[48:24] so we find out the holy ghost is god
[48:25] himself and you god was above and pillar
[48:27] fired moses god was with you in jesus
[48:30] christ now god is in you in the holy
[48:32] ghost no three gods one god working in
[48:35] three offices so god came down and
[48:38] dwelled in a sanctified body virgin born
[48:40] of a woman that was god himself you know
[48:42] what he placed his tent among us god
[48:45] dwelt in a tent called jesus christ
[48:48] [Applause]
[48:51] so jesus christ was god tent yes
[48:53] that god dwelled in
[48:55] i've been in cairo in egypt the cap
[48:57] never did come because it was the
[48:58] cornerstone
[48:59] the church in the church there was a
[49:01] cornerstone in the full church it was
[49:03] the headstone it never come it was
[49:05] rejected he said and that's where the
[49:08] bill is today that's why the bad the
[49:11] bride building here we go of christ
[49:14] is not ready for the bridegroom
[49:20] listen carefully
[49:21] so that's what we have to say with the
[49:22] deep sea you know
[49:24] oh we could preach a lot of stuff but
[49:25] see this is accurate
[49:27] this is god speaking
[49:29] that's why the bride building
[49:31] of christ
[49:33] is not ready for the bridegroom because
[49:35] the builders has rejected the chief
[49:38] cornerstone that was laid on the day of
[49:41] pentecost which is the baptism of the
[49:43] holy spirit
[49:48] so they could mystery mystery mystery mr
[49:49] mr machine what are your life mysterious
[49:52] you don't know what mystery connected
[49:54] with the life
[49:55] so you see mystery is one thing but life
[49:56] this is the holy ghost
[49:58] it has to come back to the holy ghost
[50:00] has to come back to pentecost same life
[50:03] same sensation same works same signs
[50:06] same wonders
[50:07] isn't that right
[50:08] watch see the people act funny but they
[50:11] don't come
[50:12] in order of our psychology our
[50:14] educational our lunar creeds they don't
[50:16] fit in there they ticked off you see
[50:18] people say you have the word the word
[50:19] the word of the word yes but the word
[50:21] need the spirit to come alive
[50:23] that's why jesus said tarry in the city
[50:26] of jerusalem until you endure it
[50:29] powerful and high what kind of power
[50:31] power to pray power to live power to
[50:32] overcome power to say i'm sorry power to
[50:35] say forgive me power to be humble praise
[50:38] god usually when people get blessed to
[50:39] get puffed up and we know when people
[50:41] are going up about a fall they get
[50:42] arrogant they get puffed up they get all
[50:44] up there how are you doing and
[50:46] afterwards god bring them down because
[50:48] the way up is down so anytime somebody
[50:50] about to fall just put the self right up
[50:52] then they just fall right back down but
[50:54] god wants us to stay in the dust he
[50:56] wants us to stay humble go to looking
[50:58] for somebody the more god bless you the
[51:00] more humble you can become that's a
[51:02] challenge that's a difficulty because
[51:04] usually when people get blessed they get
[51:05] puffed up but god warned somebody the
[51:07] more you bless god i want to open up the
[51:09] blessing and channel it through you come
[51:11] on you could do better than that come on
[51:13] say him and somebody go on to bless you
[51:16] glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[51:19] but i'm talking about the rat egypt the
[51:21] little monks in egypt saying it eaten
[51:22] spiritually
[51:24] the whole band full of grain

[51:58] payment your deliverance you have to get
[51:59] a promise it's by these promises you get
[52:02] faith and virtue and knowledge you can't
[52:04] sit here without a promise and you
[52:06] promise what you're looking for he gave

[52:57] people look i guess they fight for money
[52:59] about that
[53:00] jesus told his disciples don't even

[56:23] uh africa is drama i don't know yet and
[56:26] um
[56:30] so they asked for the yellow fever card
[56:32] and so on give them that i know how ten
[56:33] years and whatnot so the man called the
[56:35] brother who lived on the side outside i
[56:37] know some kind of thing like some kind
[56:38] of money or whatnot
[56:40] when did cars come out now because we
[56:41] get inoculated for something we don't
[56:43] even know
[56:44] without a needle
[56:47] they just put it in the book because you
[56:49] didn't need that but that yeah you know
[56:50] you have
[56:51] another p for that
[56:53] i said tell us that that's how the
[56:54] people they mark them you are the holy
[56:56] ghost you
[57:00] effectively inoculated you had to get a
[57:01] needle you had to get an injection but
[57:03] in africa they just put something inside
[57:05] your book and give that stuff and say
[57:06] well go
[57:08] don't take that not for christianity you
[57:09] know that you are good because somebody
[57:11] writes in the book you this you that
[57:13] know you have to experience it
[57:16] you got to taste it for yourself
[57:21] hallelujah so that was a joke for us we
[57:23] have inoculation we don't even know what
[57:25] kind it is
[57:26] but we never felt it we never tasted it
[57:28] it's just right on paper that's a paper
[57:30] experience
[57:31] and you know what you could pass all
[57:33] these stations with that you know
[57:35] because that would have seen the change
[57:36] they look at but you see god here coming
[57:38] to paper no coming up paper testimony
[57:41] paper this and paper that you have to
[57:43] have the real thing

[57:53] hold that read that peter didn't have
[57:55] that he said something what i don't have
[57:58] but such as i have i give it unto you
[58:00] rise up and walk that is what we're
[58:02] talking about that's when talk is over
[58:05] come on same as somebody action time now
[58:08] we're coming for your family we're
[58:10] coming for your loved ones when you see
[58:12] your son my god in your spirit realm you

[58:46] oh hallelujah praise god so they were
[58:49] not fit to preach they only knew his
[58:51] resurrection by his person i've seen him
[58:53] outside he commanded them not to preach
[58:55] anymore not to do nothing until first
[58:56] then you would pour from on high i don't
[58:58] believe that any preacher sent of god
[59:00] can be correctly ordained because god is
[59:03] infinite and once god does once he does
[59:06] all the time if god will not let them
[59:08] preach until they went to pentecost and
[59:10] receive here we go the pentecostal
[59:12] experience
[59:14] not a message experience your belief
[59:16] message or believe the words or believe
[59:18] the bible know a literal experience that
[59:21] you and you are alone knows
[59:24] nobody can explain it away from you
[59:26] because you have to have your own
[59:27] experience so you have to have a hunger
[59:29] in your heart for your own personal
[59:30] experience to meet god
[59:32] i remember as a 17 year old walking down
[59:34] san fernando asking god i don't know who
[59:37] you are but i want to meet you i want to
[59:39] know you there was a deep in my soul as
[59:42] a young 17 year old crying out 1975
[59:44] hungering and testing for god oh and he
[59:47] met me oh glory to god fire praise god i
[59:50] encounter that fire and he will meet you
[59:53] too but there got to be a hungering and
[59:55] thirsting and jesus said blessed are the
[59:57] day that hunger tears after
[59:59] righteousness they
[1:00:02] shall
[1:00:04] be filled
[1:00:05] come on give the lord i shout
[1:00:08] glory to god so this word come together
[1:00:12] happy titanium come to give a desire
[1:00:14] inside of you come to bring an
[1:00:16] expectation inside of you to lift you
[1:00:18] above the movies above the styles above

[1:00:31] this power doesn't come from below this
[1:00:33] power comes from above it's powerful on
[1:00:36] high it's not poured from the pasta is
[1:00:38] that power from the minister it's
[1:00:40] powerful and high they heard a sound
[1:00:42] from heaven as a russian mighty wind and
[1:00:45] they were filled with the holy ghost
[1:00:47] something happened to them oh come on
[1:00:49] now don't just look at me intellectually
[1:00:51] say amen
[1:01:00] [Applause]

[1:01:10] slaughtering angel was calling forward
[1:01:12] amen he began the slaughter
[1:01:14] and the inca and writer was among them
[1:01:16] and god said listen before they start to

[1:03:52] god put us here right now the prophecy
[1:03:54] until the time come they have to wait

[1:04:06] trying to say anything about it it will
[1:04:08] speak for itself
[1:04:10] peter peter peter just lived it out
[1:04:12] he manifested christ
[1:04:15] oh hallelujah so when your spirit come
[1:04:17] what will you manifest
[1:04:19] has to be jesus christ
[1:04:21] oh my
[1:04:22] god so therefore ephesians church eight
[1:04:24] cast that bear them with the evil that
[1:04:26] was tried and would see the apostles and
[1:04:28] found them to be liars these ephesians
[1:04:31] believed
[1:04:32] that god people ought to be holy they
[1:04:34] will not put up with sin in the church
[1:04:37] holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a
[1:04:40] figure of speech
[1:04:41] it was a way of life
[1:04:44] hallelujah brotherly kindness is a
[1:04:46] figure of speech right now a phrase
[1:04:47] brotherly kindness spirit of forgiveness
[1:04:49] honey
[1:04:52] you've got to leave nothing you don't
[1:04:53] forgive nobody just ball honey
[1:04:58] those try them let's see the apostles
[1:05:00] are not found them as liar's my that's a
[1:05:03] blunt statement that was try them who
[1:05:05] call themselves apostles is not
[1:05:08] presumptuous
[1:05:09] what righteous are people to try those
[1:05:11] who call themselves apostles how do they
[1:05:13] try them oh i love this it's in
[1:05:15] galatians 1 8 though we or an angel from
[1:05:18] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[1:05:23] than that which we have already preached
[1:05:24] unto you
[1:05:25] let him be accursed are you ready
[1:05:28] it was the apostles who brought the
[1:05:30] original word to the people
[1:05:33] the original word could not change not
[1:05:36] even a dot or a dash of it
[1:05:39] paul knew it was god who had spoken to
[1:05:41] him
[1:05:42] so he said even if i come and try to
[1:05:45] give a second revelation
[1:05:47] try to make one little change in what i
[1:05:50] give originally let me be accursed
[1:05:54] so paul was saying i paul cannot come
[1:05:56] back and change the first revelation
[1:06:00] because god can't change his mind about
[1:06:03] his word
[1:06:04] oh god we give the lord some praise his
[1:06:06] people
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:08] you see paul knew the first revelation
[1:06:11] was correct
[1:06:13] god can't give
[1:06:15] a fullest revelation than a second
[1:06:17] revelation
[1:06:19] if he did he would be changing his mind
[1:06:21] he can give a revelation and add to it
[1:06:24] as he did in the garden of eden when he
[1:06:26] promised a seed to the woman then later
[1:06:28] designated that sea to come to abraham
[1:06:30] then later it will come through the
[1:06:31] bloodline to david
[1:06:33] but it was the same revelation
[1:06:35] it only gave the people more information
[1:06:38] to help than to receive and understand
[1:06:40] it but it was the same revelation but
[1:06:43] god could add more to give more
[1:06:45] information of how it's going to be
[1:06:47] unfolded
[1:06:48] god's word can't change the seed came
[1:06:51] exactly as revealed and see what those
[1:06:53] false apostles were doing they came with
[1:06:55] their own word
[1:06:58] oh hallelujah are you with me
[1:07:00] they came with their own word those
[1:07:02] ephesians knew
[1:07:04] that paul word was was
[1:07:07] those ephesians knew that word as paul
[1:07:09] had taught it they were full of the holy
[1:07:11] ghost by the land of hands of paul
[1:07:14] they looked those fours are possible in
[1:07:16] the eye and said you are not seeing what
[1:07:17] paul said therefore you are false so we
[1:07:20] have a prophet in this hour his name is
[1:07:22] william marion branham a prophet in the
[1:07:24] end time according to malachi 4 behold i
[1:07:27] sent you elijah the prophet before that
[1:07:29] great and terrible day of the lord so
[1:07:31] god sent a prophet with the original
[1:07:33] word and if we stay with an original
[1:07:35] word we're going to see fire fall
[1:07:37] you're going to see god confirm it we
[1:07:39] can't bring our own word we have to
[1:07:41] bring word on top of word on top of word
[1:07:43] it's not your feelings
[1:07:45] are you like you it's not a liking
[1:07:47] contest you don't have to like me it's
[1:07:49] got to be the word i'm not here for you
[1:07:51] to like i'm here to deliver a love
[1:07:53] letter to you
[1:07:55] glory to god your husband give me a
[1:07:57] message for you
[1:07:58] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:08:01] you are his wife
[1:08:03] you are his bride
[1:08:05] he given preachers to send his word to
[1:08:07] you
[1:08:08] [Applause]
[1:08:12] okay
[1:08:13] so you are not saying what paul said
[1:08:14] therefore you're false that sets my
[1:08:16] heart on fire
[1:08:18] get back to the word
[1:08:19] it's not you that really tries the
[1:08:21] apostle and the prophet and teacher it's
[1:08:23] the word that tries them we have to try
[1:08:25] people
[1:08:26] hallelujah bible said try every spirit
[1:08:29] every spirit not some spirit every
[1:08:31] spirit i don't get where they're from
[1:08:32] what country you're from
[1:08:34] oh hallelujah you see i have no problem
[1:08:37] with people getting fight and if i
[1:08:38] offend men
[1:08:40] i'll get a fight if i offend god
[1:08:43] i have no people problem people
[1:08:44] displeased with me
[1:08:45] i as long as god is not displeased with
[1:08:47] me
[1:08:48] i have no problem people walking away
[1:08:50] from me that's okay but i don't want god
[1:08:52] walk away
[1:08:54] from me

[1:40:48] all of this well in this together
[1:40:50] building a perfect church for the
[1:40:52] capstone to cap what's it been done
[1:40:54] again is manifested through seven church
[1:40:56] ages seven messengers here you are seven
[1:40:59] church ages seven steps god building
[1:41:01] this church is like one person into an
[1:41:03] individual into himself the power of god
[1:41:06] coming down through this wellness
[1:41:07] together therefore the pentecostal
[1:41:09] people that let out of the lutheran let
[1:41:12] all the wesleyan and things you see they
[1:41:14] live in this part of the temple that's
[1:41:16] the way but god say i'm going to restore
[1:41:19] and the way god is expecting us as
[1:41:21] individuals to grow the way he brought
[1:41:22] the church to grow
[1:41:24] just as the church ages grow we have got
[1:41:26] to grow the prophet revealed that when
[1:41:28] you ask to get closer to god what you're
[1:41:31] actually asking is that i want to grow
[1:41:33] in god because when you grow you'll say
[1:41:35] i want to be close to lord god give your
[1:41:36] faith amen i want to be closer to you
[1:41:38] god give your virtue
[1:41:39] god what happened to you there you're
[1:41:40] getting closer to knowledge and
[1:41:42] temperance and patience ungodliness i'm
[1:41:44] proud kindness and by the time you hit
[1:41:46] that spirit you're one with him at that
[1:41:48] time you shall know i am in the father
[1:41:50] he is me and i and you if i get closer
[1:41:52] than that i and my father are one when
[1:41:55] you see me you see my father
[1:41:57] because not me that do the worse is the
[1:41:58] father in me that doing the works so
[1:42:01] it's god a new field
[1:42:03] pillar of fire
[1:42:04] hallelujah all you're waiting for is to
[1:42:06] get back to eden
[1:42:07] oh the earth can't hold you back no more
[1:42:09] oh glory to god hallelujah they can hold
[1:42:12] back jesus
[1:42:13] jesus was a powerhouse
[1:42:15] oh glory to god he cast out devils he
[1:42:17] raised the sick he healed the dead he
[1:42:18] raised the dead healed the sick isn't
[1:42:20] that right he was a powerhouse and he
[1:42:22] gave the disciples the same promise the
[1:42:23] same works i do you were going to be
[1:42:25] doing also you want to be in a
[1:42:27] powerhouse also
[1:42:28] do you believe that
[1:42:30] oh praise god so when a man possesses
[1:42:33] these virtues these kind of things
[1:42:35] then the holy ghost comes upon him
[1:42:38] no matter if you speak in tongues you
[1:42:39] might imprison it any gift that god get
[1:42:42] mr please amen
[1:42:44] oh hallelujah all right
[1:42:47] come down to this
[1:42:49] notice here we go
[1:42:51] if god acted one time on a certain
[1:42:54] circumstance
[1:42:55] and if that same circumstance arise
[1:42:57] again he has got to act the second time
[1:42:59] like he did the first time or he's
[1:43:00] unjust
[1:43:02] now no matter how bad you are in sin
[1:43:05] or how stupid you may become
[1:43:07] he's got to act to you like you did that
[1:43:09] for one woman or you acted wrong then
[1:43:11] amen here we go
[1:43:13] god's behavior is his person
[1:43:17] what he is
[1:43:18] in his behavior
[1:43:20] declares
[1:43:22] his personal
[1:43:24] and that's the way you are in your
[1:43:25] behavior
[1:43:27] apparently get ready
[1:43:29] as we want through the lesson
[1:43:31] when you spoke in tongues you heard a
[1:43:32] story your life speaks so loud i can't
[1:43:35] hear your words
[1:43:36] so whatever you are you are
[1:43:38] the life that you live shows
[1:43:40] what kind of spirit
[1:43:42] is inside of you let's borrow heads
