[13:54] holiday of praying fast first friday of
[13:56] the month
[13:57] and uh we're gonna cruise off with the
[13:59] zoom permission uh this comment friday
[14:02] so god bless you and uh we want to go
[14:05] straight into the bible study tonight
[14:07] and um
[14:11] it's very or that i still
[14:14] um connecting with
[14:17] the message where the isaac's
[14:19] speech speak i spoke about this great
[14:22] deception in the world
[14:23] and in the church and in the message
[14:26] this this this deception
[14:28] and tonight i want to
[14:30] go a little further
[14:32] i just felt like to do this it'll be a
[14:35] different tonight
[14:36] and i'm going to give her what i have
[14:38] titled
[14:39] a warning
[14:41] take heed
[14:42] first corinthians 10 bible study
[14:46] this is a warning
[14:48] to take heed
[14:50] and this is the context the main
[14:52] scripture we're going to have is first
[14:53] scoring since then we're not going to
[14:54] read that just yet but we're going to we
[14:56] want to get there so we see what the
[14:59] lord will do
[15:00] so the first scripture i want to read
[15:01] tonight and if you have about us with
[15:02] you is hebrews chapter four
[15:05] in verse one two hebrews chapter four
[15:08] verse one and two
[15:09] and
[15:10] we're going to already have a a ride a
[15:12] rocket ride in the scriptures today and
[15:15] i want you to see something that god how
[15:17] god sees things
[15:19] um
[15:20] i want to transport you not
[15:23] from this zoom room
[15:25] i want to transport you into
[15:27] the realm of
[15:29] of dossier the lord oh god speak to his
[15:31] prophets
[15:32] oh god give his word
[15:34] forget me tonight i am just
[15:36] let's say
[15:37] uh
[15:38] repeats repeating instructions repeating
[15:40] his guidance and so on like that right
[15:42] so forget church you just want to hear
[15:46] from the lord hebrews 4 1 and 2.
[15:49] and this is the scriptures here let us
[15:51] therefore fear
[15:53] least a promise being left us
[15:56] of entering into his rest
[15:59] any of you should seem to come short of
[16:01] it
[16:02] so this is not you are in church and
[16:04] you're fine
[16:06] this is being confronted
[16:09] with the scriptures itself
[16:11] verse 2
[16:12] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[16:15] well as unto them
[16:17] but the word preached
[16:19] did not profit them not being mixed
[16:24] with faith in them that heard it
[16:26] now remember for a while now a few
[16:28] services i'll keep talking i'm not but
[16:30] i'm beginning to see more and more
[16:32] that even though people may all hear the
[16:35] same things
[16:37] they don't process it the same way
[16:41] they come like you could be sitting here
[16:42] tonight and want to know what is my
[16:43] objective what is my motive what i'm
[16:45] trying to say if i'm trying to say this
[16:47] i'm trying to and i'm not trying to say
[16:49] anything
[16:50] i'm trying to share
[16:52] what god put up on my heart which is his
[16:54] word i do have a dream to bring for you
[16:56] from last night i do have a fancy total
[16:59] as such i'm just trying to obey god and
[17:01] present to you the word let's turn to
[17:05] now to hebrews chapter 2
[17:10] verse 1.
[17:11] [Music]
[17:13] we want to read from verse 1 to 3.
[17:17] therefore
[17:18] we ought to give
[17:20] the more earnest
[17:22] heed
[17:24] to the things
[17:25] which we have heard
[17:28] so therefore you could actually come to
[17:30] a place where you're just hearing things
[17:31] yeah karen you know
[17:32] yes it was your
[17:35] you know go in out you hear what you
[17:37] hear
[17:38] you know but you're not listening
[17:40] closely
[17:42] you're not
[17:43] taking it deeper
[17:45] you're not as bad as i could always said
[17:48] meditate on the word you can't meditate
[17:50] on something you have not studied
[17:53] you meditate you chew it over
[17:55] like i listen to a fish corinthians 10
[17:57] over and over i'm listening to it i'm
[17:59] trying to soak it in
[18:01] because i want to get right into it this
[18:03] is where i feel like to go tonight
[18:06] and when you study the word
[18:09] you could get the opportunity to
[18:11] meditate on the word
[18:12] so watch therefore we ought to give them
[18:15] energy to the things which we have heard
[18:16] least at any time
[18:18] we should let them slip
[18:21] for if the words spoken by angels were
[18:22] steadfast
[18:24] and every transgression and disobedience
[18:27] receive a just recompense of reward
[18:30] how shall we escape
[18:32] if we neglect
[18:34] so great salvation
[18:36] which is that the first begin to be
[18:38] spoken by the lord
[18:39] and was confirmed unto us by them not
[18:42] indian
[18:44] so
[18:45] what paul is presenting here
[18:48] is that we should not take things for
[18:49] granted
[18:51] we should not
[18:53] second timothy 3 familiar scripture if
[18:56] you want to go to ii
[18:58] verse 1 says this know also
[19:01] that in the last days perilous times
[19:03] shall come
[19:05] for men shall be
[19:08] lovers of their own self
[19:11] covetous
[19:12] posters
[19:14] proud
[19:16] blasphemers
[19:18] disobedient to parents
[19:20] unthankful
[19:21] unholy
[19:23] without natural affection
[19:25] truth breakers false accusers in
[19:28] continuing fears
[19:29] the spices of those that are good
[19:30] traitors
[19:32] heady high-minded
[19:34] lovers of pleasures more than lovers
[19:38] as i said see that dear lovers of
[19:40] pleasures more than lovers of god the
[19:43] bible says because iniquity shall bond
[19:46] the love of many will work school
[19:50] that's church folks love the president
[19:52] of the lord for his fight having a form
[19:54] of godliness but
[19:57] in the message now but denying the power
[20:00] thereof from such to no way for of this
[20:03] sword are they which creep into houses
[20:05] and the captive city woman leading with
[20:07] sins literally redivers lust ever
[20:09] learning never
[20:11] able to come
[20:12] to the knowledge of the truth but the
[20:14] air is close to the ground they're
[20:16] learning the hearing they're receiving
[20:18] in that way but not coming to the truth
[20:20] let's continue verse eight now as janice
[20:23] and jumpers with submissions
[20:25] so
[20:26] do these also
[20:28] resist the truth now imagine that
[20:31] resistance to men of corrupt minds
[20:33] reprobate considering what concerning
[20:35] defeat
[20:37] but
[20:38] they shall proceed no further for their
[20:40] folly shall be manifest unto all men as
[20:42] theirs also was
[20:44] and now paul
[20:46] is going into the life cycle now but don
[20:49] was fully known
[20:51] by doctrine
[20:53] manner of life
[20:55] purpose
[20:57] faith
[20:58] long suffering
[21:00] charity
[21:02] patience
[21:04] persecutions afflictions
[21:06] which came under me at antioch
[21:09] at iconium at lystra
[21:12] what persecutions i endured but out of
[21:14] them all the lord delivered
[21:16] ye
[21:18] and all that will live godly in christ
[21:21] jesus
[21:22] shall shall suffer persecution
[21:25] but evil men
[21:27] and seducers child wax worth
[21:31] and with
[21:33] deceiving
[21:34] and being deceived
[21:37] but continues out
[21:39] in the things which dog has learned
[21:42] and has been assured of
[21:44] knowing whom though has learned them
[21:49] so paul was actually pointing and this
[21:51] is the reality of the scripture
[21:53] that they're going to write evil men
[21:55] church folks ministries ministers
[21:58] that are going to be deceiving and
[22:00] themselves deceived
[22:02] but continue
[22:04] down in the things that always learn now
[22:06] paul
[22:07] he
[22:08] is the one that says this angel come
[22:10] from heaven and preach any other gospel
[22:13] let him be a curse if i come back and
[22:16] change the original presentation let me
[22:19] be a christ in other words
[22:21] god can come and have a new version of
[22:23] it i improve version of it it can't be
[22:26] done
[22:27] now remember friends
[22:29] that the jews
[22:30] who rejected the gospel that jesus
[22:33] brought
[22:34] that rejection gives us an opportunity
[22:38] as gentiles to come in
[22:41] and paul identified it in romans 11. if
[22:43] you want to find the bible take a note
[22:45] of it 15-22
[22:47] paul said if the casting away
[22:49] of them talking about the jews be the
[22:52] reconciling of the world what shall the
[22:55] receiving of them be but life from the
[22:57] dead
[22:58] for if
[22:59] the first fruit be holy
[23:01] the lump is also holy but if the root be
[23:04] holy so are the branches and if some of
[23:07] the branches be broken off and dao
[23:10] being a wild olive trees of gentiles are
[23:13] grafted in among them
[23:15] and with them partakers of the root
[23:17] and the fatness of the olive tree
[23:20] both
[23:21] not against the branches
[23:24] but if double boost
[23:26] though there is not the root
[23:28] but the root zee
[23:30] there will see then the branches are
[23:31] broken off that i might be grafted in so
[23:34] paul
[23:35] is bringing the balance of the approach
[23:38] with the revelation to understand the
[23:40] context in which we gentiles were
[23:43] grafted in he said you will see then
[23:46] the branches were broken off that i
[23:48] might be grafted in well
[23:50] because of unbelief they were broken off
[23:54] and those standards by faith be not
[23:57] high-minded
[23:59] but fear
[24:01] and if you're reading it in your bible i
[24:03] always see it with me that last part
[24:06] be not
[24:07] high-minded
[24:08] but fear
[24:10] say it one more time
[24:11] be not
[24:13] high-minded
[24:14] but fear
[24:16] for who's 21 if god spared not the
[24:20] natural branches
[24:22] take heed
[24:23] release
[24:24] he also skinner d
[24:27] behold
[24:28] therefore
[24:30] the goodness
[24:31] and the severity of god
[24:33] on them that fell severity but towards
[24:36] the
[24:37] goodness and looking for the condition
[24:39] here
[24:40] if
[24:42] thou continue in his goodness
[24:45] otherwise
[24:46] thou shalt be cut off
[24:49] now
[24:50] there are many people
[24:52] take god for granted
[24:54] take the calling for granted
[24:56] take the election predestination and
[24:59] they believe the message and god open
[25:00] their eyes and they god i serve and call
[25:03] kuala mutal they take all of that for
[25:05] granted
[25:06] but when you put layer after layer of
[25:08] scriptural truth
[25:10] it shouldn't be taken for granted
[25:12] he says the goodness
[25:15] and severity of god
[25:18] on them that fell severity
[25:20] but towards thee
[25:22] goodness if
[25:24] if
[25:25] many people start
[25:27] is not
[25:28] who start
[25:30] is who finishes
[25:32] and not only who finishes
[25:34] but who finishes without taking
[25:36] shortcuts or uh and get disqualified at
[25:40] the end of the race
[25:41] if thou continue
[25:43] in his goodness if you don't continue in
[25:45] his goodness what happened you'll be cut
[25:46] off
[25:48] colossians
[25:50] 1
[25:51] we want to read for 17
[25:54] to 23.
[25:56] colossians 1 17
[25:58] and he is before all things speaking
[26:00] with christ
[26:01] by him all things consist
[26:04] and he's the head of the body to church
[26:06] who is the beginning
[26:08] the firstborn from the dead
[26:10] that in all things he might have the
[26:12] preeminences
[26:14] for it pleased the father
[26:16] that in him
[26:17] should all fullness dwell
[26:19] on having made peace through the blood
[26:21] of his cross by him
[26:22] to reconcile all things unto himself by
[26:25] him i say whether there be things in it
[26:27] or things in heaven
[26:29] and you speak on us
[26:31] that was sometime alienated an enemies
[26:35] in your mind
[26:37] by wicked works yet
[26:39] now
[26:40] had he reconciled
[26:43] in the body of his flesh to death
[26:45] here we go to present you
[26:48] holy
[26:49] and unblameable
[26:51] unreprovable in his sight
[26:54] the fine print or the condition comes
[26:56] next
[26:56] if
[26:58] you continue
[27:00] in the face
[27:02] rooted
[27:03] grounded and settled
[27:05] and be not moved away from the hope of
[27:07] the gospel which you have heard
[27:10] and which was preached to every creature
[27:12] which is under him where i paul i made a
[27:15] minister
[27:16] the part i want you to underline the
[27:17] part i want you to get is if you
[27:20] continue
[27:21] in the fate
[27:23] okay so let's
[27:25] let's run right now
[27:27] familiar scriptures this is short versus
[27:28] matthew 24 4 and jesus said unto them
[27:32] take heed
[27:33] that no man deceive you
[27:35] warning of that deception that's going
[27:38] to be the world that's going to be in
[27:39] the church
[27:41] there could be a message
[27:43] that in the amplified says jesus
[27:45] answered them be careful
[27:47] that no one misleads you
[27:50] deceiving you
[27:52] and leading you into error
[27:54] i just love how that is presented
[27:56] deceiving you and leading you into error
[27:59] matthew 24
[28:01] jesus speaking and many false prophets
[28:05] arise and shall deceive many
[28:08] okay
[28:09] all right so we want to go now to the
[28:11] old testament deuteronomy chapter four
[28:14] and i want you to see
[28:16] what god shares
[28:18] to teach our sons
[28:21] and our son's sons
[28:24] how god is presenting his thoughts
[28:27] and his word to these people
[28:29] okay deuteronomy deuteronomy chapter
[28:32] four wanna read from verse one
[28:35] now therefore hearken o israel
[28:38] unto the statutes
[28:40] and unto the judgments which i teach you
[28:43] for to do them that you may live
[28:46] and go in
[28:47] and possess the land which your lord god
[28:50] of your father has given you
[28:52] now note
[28:54] the land is promised
[28:56] but
[28:57] as we say to everything there is a
[28:59] process you want to buy a house
[29:02] you have to have the application you
[29:03] have to have a job you have to get uh
[29:06] being able to within the range of the
[29:07] mortgage requirement you want to get a
[29:10] car you have to have your license you
[29:12] can't just ups and want to buy a car you
[29:14] can't even drive and to get the license
[29:16] you don't want to pick up analyzing a
[29:19] dispensing machine you have to test an
[29:20] exam you have to go and do driving tests
[29:23] then you have to pass these exams and
[29:24] you get your driver's license and this
[29:26] is the life the process you want to have
[29:30] a garden of oranges you just say lord
[29:33] let there be a kind of oranges it
[29:34] doesn't work that way you have to tell
[29:36] the soil cut down the land get the
[29:38] orange trees to plant your plant you
[29:40] wait nine months ten months two years
[29:42] how much years it takes to grow and then
[29:44] you get your garden so everything in
[29:46] life is processed the baby is not born
[29:48] an adult that's why the baby the baby
[29:50] grow and grow to process becomes an
[29:52] adult and just like that we don't born
[29:54] big in god or born perfect in god or
[29:56] born as uh
[29:58] adult and god we grew and this is what
[30:00] this life is a process so so in other
[30:03] words i want to read that verse again
[30:05] this is from tutoring chapter four heart
[30:07] know israel under the statutes and
[30:09] judgments which i teach you for to do
[30:11] them that you may live one two and go in
[30:14] and possess the land which the lord god
[30:16] you have given your father has given you
[30:18] two you shall not add unto the word
[30:21] which i command you
[30:23] neither shall you diminish it ought from
[30:25] it don't take away look at it that you
[30:28] may keep the commandments of the lord
[30:29] your courage i command you your eyes
[30:32] have seen what the lord did because of
[30:34] the alpha for all the men that followed
[30:36] blpo the lord thy god had destroyed them
[30:40] from among you so these people saw
[30:42] judgments of god and you know of time i
[30:45] keep seeing a lot of crap a lot of
[30:47] nonsense and foolishness continues and
[30:49] go on his message because this message
[30:51] has not yet seen the judgment of god
[30:55] they have not they don't know what that
[30:57] is
[30:58] they they have
[30:59] books and people arrogant and you can't
[31:02] tell them nothing people don't want to
[31:03] be spoken to and you know all kind of
[31:05] attitudes and stuff here's why they feel
[31:08] blessed they feel this and the other one
[31:09] mine and with the modern here they have
[31:11] a car they have a house they feeling
[31:13] proud they feel like there's all kind of
[31:14] stuff going through their mind but
[31:16] this what i'm saying here is god
[31:19] and this is coming
[31:20] okay so what
[31:22] for god destroyed him among you and ani
[31:25] but ye that did cleave unto the lord
[31:27] your god are alive every one of you this
[31:30] day so this is acknowledging you know
[31:32] what you are the bunch that cleave unto
[31:34] the lord behold i have taught you
[31:37] statutes and judgments even as the lord
[31:41] my god commanded me so moses was under
[31:44] command to present and teach statutes
[31:47] instructions and judgments that you
[31:49] should do so in the land
[31:51] whether you go to possess it
[31:53] for six
[31:55] keep therefore and do them for this is
[31:58] your wisdom
[31:59] and your understanding in the sight of
[32:01] the nations we shall hear all these
[32:04] statutes and say surely this great
[32:06] nation is a wise and understanding
[32:08] people for what nation is just so great
[32:10] who had god so night unto them as a lot
[32:12] of our god is all things
[32:14] that we all call upon him for
[32:17] and what nation is there so great that
[32:19] had statutes and judgment so righteous
[32:21] has all this law which i said before
[32:23] this day
[32:24] this night here we go
[32:26] only take heed to
[32:29] thyself
[32:31] and keep
[32:32] thy soul diligently
[32:35] least
[32:36] go forget the things which you think
[32:38] eyes have seen
[32:40] unleash depart from thy heart all the
[32:43] days of their life
[32:44] but teach them thy sons
[32:47] and thy sons and thy sons sons
[32:50] so we could take something out of that
[32:53] that you have to keep your soul
[32:55] you have to take heat to yourself
[32:57] that you don't forget the things that
[32:59] you have seen and heard
[33:00] at least they depart
[33:02] from your heart now you know
[33:05] you know you see people in church and
[33:07] you see them backslid
[33:09] slide
[33:10] and sometimes you sit down and wonder
[33:12] how did they get there
[33:15] how did they go back so far
[33:19] that means they were dying on the inside
[33:23] they were backstriding on the inside a
[33:25] long time ago people doesn't just follow
[33:28] you
[33:30] they're backstage on god
[33:32] the physical body comes to church sing a
[33:34] man raise your hand and smile about god
[33:37] bless you but the heart
[33:39] is going away from god
[33:42] see
[33:44] and then
[33:45] if
[33:47] your heart not where it's supposed to be
[33:49] how will you teach your sons
[33:52] if
[33:53] you're not in the place that you're
[33:55] supposed to be how you will teach your
[33:56] son's sons
[33:58] you know in observing over the years
[34:01] if you find
[34:02] the parents disrespectful or the mother
[34:04] disrespectful or the father
[34:06] disrespectful look at the children
[34:08] they're going to be
[34:10] just as disrespectful
[34:12] if you see the mother of bad attitude or
[34:14] the father
[34:15] look at the children
[34:17] you will see the attitudes
[34:19] go down the challenge is when it flip
[34:22] over to the next generation and you
[34:24] could see how god is so concerned
[34:27] because he wants it to go from
[34:30] generation to generation the statutes of
[34:33] this world
[34:36] so let's continue
[34:37] deuteronomy chapter 4 powerful scripture
[34:42] this is moses
[34:44] this is moses telling the people why he
[34:47] is not going over
[34:50] verse 20
[34:51] this is very instructive
[34:54] this is the prophet moses
[34:56] man that
[34:57] have
[34:58] god's ear
[35:02] but the lord verse twenty fifth and
[35:03] eighth generation fourth was trending

[35:07] you forth out of the iron fullness event
[35:09] of egypt
[35:11] to be unto him
[35:12] a people of inheritance as he are this
[35:15] day
[35:17] furthermore
[35:19] the lord was angry with me
[35:21] for your seeks
[35:23] now this is the prophet
[35:26] and he is telling them
[35:28] that god was angry with him
[35:31] let's continue and swear
[35:34] that i should not go over jordan
[35:38] that i should not go into that good land
[35:41] which the lord thy god give a thee for
[35:43] inheritance

[35:55] see
[35:56] this is the same moses that the
[35:58] challenge pharaoh
[36:00] this is the same moses that saw these
[36:02] two million people come up
[36:05] and this is that same moses saying
[36:07] the lord was angry with me
[36:10] and the lord said i should not go over
[36:12] to jordan
[36:14] i should not go into that good land but

[37:47] and children's children
[37:50] that he shall have remained long in the
[37:52] land and shall corrupt yourselves and
[37:54] make great images or likeness or

[38:24] nations you shall be left few in number
[38:26] among the heathen where the lord shall
[38:27] lead you
[38:28] and there you shall serve god

[39:13] let's go to deuteronomy
[39:15] chapter 11
[39:17] we want to read from verse 13
[39:20] deuteronomy chapter 11
[39:22] verse 13
[39:25] and it shall come to pass
[39:27] shall hearken diligently unto my
[39:29] commandments which i command you this
[39:31] day to love the lord your god and to
[39:33] serve him with all your heart with all
[39:35] your soul that i will give you
[39:37] the reign of your land in his due season
[39:40] the free stream and the lettering that
[39:43] thomas gathered in thy corn and i wine
[39:46] and i oil i will send grass and i feel
[39:49] for that i cuddle the dog means eat and
[39:51] be full
[39:53] take
[39:54] heed
[39:55] to yourselves
[39:57] that your heart
[39:59] be not deceived
[40:02] this is this is something
[40:04] you mean your heart can be received yes
[40:07] be received and you turn aside and serve
[40:09] other gods
[40:11] and worship him
[40:12] you could make your house a god
[40:14] you can make a wife a god you could make
[40:17] your car a god you could make your own
[40:19] pride of god you could make your own
[40:21] achievements of god
[40:23] yes you can make a chair in a god to
[40:25] live your life to your children you can
[40:27] make a job of god you worship that job
[40:29] so much and you don't even see
[40:31] retirement retrenchment coming
[40:34] all right
[40:35] take heed to yourselves
[40:38] that your heart be not deceived
[40:40] and you turn aside
[40:41] silver the gods and worship them and
[40:43] then the lord's wrath the kingdom
[40:44] against you and he shut up the heaven
[40:47] and there be no rain and the land yield
[40:49] not a fruit at least he perished quickly
[40:52] from off the good land which the lord
[40:53] gave at you therefore shall you lay up
[40:56] these my words in your heart and in your
[40:58] soul and bind them for a sign upon your
[41:01] hand that they may be frontless between
[41:03] your eyes and you shall teach them your
[41:06] children
[41:07] this is so powerful
[41:09] so when you absorb it
[41:11] when you receive it
[41:13] when it is active in your life
[41:16] then you could see the great need all
[41:17] god will say teach them your children
[41:21] speaking of them when those cities in
[41:23] thy house
[41:24] when the walkers by the way when no lies
[41:27] down when they're rises up those shall
[41:29] write them upon the to oppose something
[41:31] house upon thy gates that your days
[41:35] may be multiplied and the days of your
[41:38] children in the land which the lord sway
[41:41] unto your fathers to give them all the
[41:43] days of heaven upon years
[41:46] and if you shall diligently keep all the
[41:47] commandments which i command you to do
[41:49] them to love the lord your god to walk
[41:51] in all these ways to cleave unto him
[41:53] then will the lord drive out these
[41:55] nations from before you you shall
[41:57] possess greater nations and lighter than
[42:00] yourselves every place where upon the
[42:02] souls of your future tread shall be
[42:05] yours from the wilderness and lebanon
[42:07] from the river deliver your fruit is
[42:09] even until the uttermost shall be of
[42:11] course be there shall no man be able to
[42:13] stand before you for the lord your god
[42:16] shall lay the fear of you and the dread
[42:19] of you upon all the land that you shall
[42:22] tread upon as he said unto you behold i
[42:25] set before you this day
[42:27] a blessing
[42:28] and a cliff a blessing
[42:31] if you be the commandments of the lord
[42:33] your god which i command you this day
[42:35] and of course if you will not obey the
[42:39] commandments of the lord your god but
[42:41] turn aside out of the way which i
[42:42] command you this day to go after other
[42:44] gods which you have not known
[42:48] you want to turn to jeremiah chapter 14.
[42:50] i told you i'm going to give you a
[42:51] scripture rightly
[42:53] but we're going to get the flow of it
[42:54] jeremiah 14. i want to read from verse
[42:57] verse 10 of jeremiah
[42:59] chapter 14
[43:01] all blessed be the name
[43:03] of the lord
[43:08] jeremiah 14
[43:11] thus saith the lord unto these people
[43:15] does
[43:16] have they love to wander
[43:19] they have not
[43:20] refrained their feet
[43:22] therefore the lord does not accept them
[43:25] he will not remember their he will not
[43:27] remember their iniquity
[43:28] and visit their sins
[43:31] then the lord said unto me
[43:33] jeremiah pray not for these people for
[43:34] their good
[43:35] when they fast i will not hear their cry
[43:38] when they overburned offering an
[43:40] oblation i will not accept them i will
[43:42] consume them by the soul
[43:44] and by famine
[43:46] and by the pestilence
[43:48] then said i our lord god
[43:51] behold
[43:52] the prophets say unto them ye shall not
[43:55] see the sword
[43:56] neither shall he have funny
[43:59] but i will give you a short peace
[44:01] in this place
[44:03] this is jeremiah telling god that
[44:06] verse 14
[44:07] listen to this
[44:08] then the lord said unto me
[44:12] the prophets
[44:14] prophesy lies in my name
[44:17] i sent them not
[44:19] neither have i commanded them neither
[44:22] speak unto them
[44:24] they prophesy unto you a false vision
[44:28] and designation a thing of naught
[44:31] and
[44:32] the deceit of their heart
[44:34] therefore
[44:35] thus fear the lord concerning the
[44:38] prophets
[44:40] that prophesy in my name
[44:42] and i sent them not yet they say sword
[44:44] and family shall not be this run by
[44:46] sword and famine shall those prophets be
[44:48] consumed
[44:49] and the people to whom they prophesy
[44:52] shall be cast out in the streets of
[44:54] jerusalem because of the famine and the
[44:56] sword they shall have none to bury them
[44:58] their wives nor their sons not their
[45:00] daughters for i will pour out
[45:03] their wickedness
[45:05] upon them
[45:06] lessons that we could take from this
[45:08] they are prophets pastors ministers that
[45:11] god has not sent that god have not
[45:13] spoken to
[45:14] that prophesy stuff from the deceit of
[45:16] their own heart god
[45:19] doesn't speak to them
[45:20] they prophesy false visions
[45:23] false revelations
[45:25] and and and god will judge that we are
[45:27] not the judge of that god will judge
[45:28] that
[45:29] but
[45:30] in the new testament and this is where
[45:32] we go to ephesians
[45:34] and ephesians 4
[45:36] from the scripture but you can turn it
[45:37] and he gives some apostles some prophets
[45:39] some evangelists some pastors and
[45:41] teachers what for
[45:43] for the perfecting of the saints as i
[45:44] always say not for the glorification of
[45:46] no man any pulpit not for glorification
[45:49] of the minister what for the perfection
[45:51] of the saints one two work of the
[45:53] ministry and that's the ministry of
[45:54] jesus christ
[45:55] and then for the edifying of the body of
[45:57] christ as a body of jesus christ not
[45:59] just by not just you your local church
[46:01] okay
[46:02] but stating till we all come into the
[46:05] unity of the faith that's the object of
[46:07] all this ministry to get into the unity
[46:09] not of churches and groups
[46:11] but of the faith and of the knowledge of
[46:13] the son of god onto a perfect man and
[46:16] then you get unto the measure of the
[46:18] statue of the fullness of christ why why
[46:20] do we need this why would you just
[46:22] measure the statue of the fullness of
[46:23] christ which is that maturity okay
[46:27] what is the purpose of that that answers
[46:29] in verse 14 that we henceforth been on
[46:32] our children
[46:33] tossed to and fro and carried a boat
[46:36] with every wind of doctrine by the
[46:38] sleigh of men and common craftiness
[46:42] whereby they lie in wait to deceive now
[46:46] this is pulpit guys okay
[46:48] with the doctrines with the slave with
[46:51] the craftiness the line with receive but
[46:55] speaking not lovely the truth but
[46:57] speaking the truth in love
[46:59] may grow up into him in all things which
[47:01] is ahead in christ
[47:03] not only amplified
[47:04] it says this year so then we no longer
[47:07] be children talks like ships to unfold
[47:09] between chance gusts of teaching and
[47:12] wavering with every change in wind of
[47:14] doctrine they pray of the cunning and
[47:16] the cleverness of unscrupulous men
[47:19] gamblers engaged in every shifting form
[47:22] of trickery in inventing errors
[47:26] to mislead
[47:27] oh my
[47:29] hallelujah so we hitting something they
[47:32] will test newton's met now first
[47:34] corinthians chapter 3
[47:36] we want to read from verse 18
[47:39] very interesting scripture
[47:40] first corinthians chapter 3 reading from
[47:43] verse 18
[47:44] let no man deceive himself
[47:48] let's stop right there
[47:50] so all jesus said let no man deceive you
[47:52] right
[47:53] so all this is prophet's son and other
[47:55] side outside
[47:57] no this is inside them
[47:59] let no man deceive himself
[48:01] you mean a man could deceive himself i
[48:03] think this is the worst deception
[48:05] let the man see himself if any man among
[48:07] you see not to be wise in this world
[48:10] let him become a fool
[48:12] that he may be wise
[48:14] 4
[48:15] verse 19
[48:16] the wisdom of this world
[48:18] is foolishness with god
[48:21] for it is written
[48:24] he taketh the wise in their own
[48:26] craftiness and again
[48:28] the lord knoweth the thoughts of the
[48:30] wise that they have been
[48:32] therefore let
[48:34] no man
[48:36] glory in men i wonder how much people
[48:38] see the scripture or no the script at
[48:40] all
[48:41] therefore
[48:42] let no man glory in men people find that
[48:45] beaten this number six heart but look
[48:47] the scripture says here let no man
[48:50] glory and men for all things are yours
[48:53] whether paul or apostles or apollos or
[48:56] cephas or the world or life or death or
[48:59] things present or things to come all are
[49:00] yours and your christ
[49:03] and christ
[49:04] is god
[49:07] now it's from galatians chapter six
[49:13] reading from verse one
[49:17] so this is a sort of continuation of
[49:19] intelligence
[49:20] and paul presented this way brethren
[49:23] if a man be overtaken
[49:26] with a fault
[49:28] you with a spiritual
[49:30] restore such a one in the spirit of
[49:33] meekness
[49:35] so paul is saying
[49:37] a brother backslid a brother in the
[49:39] condition
[49:40] he is he's he's fleshing out
[49:43] the approach
[49:44] in restoring someone
[49:46] okay
[49:47] so the approach in historians restoring
[49:50] someone is not that you so righteous and
[49:52] you're so up here
[49:54] and they don't dear and there's like a
[49:56] pity in them and you know i mean it was
[49:58] you he was gonna do so no no that's not
[50:00] the way
[50:01] brethren if a man be overtaken in a fall
[50:05] ye which are spiritual
[50:06] restore such a one how
[50:10] which but what we in the spirit of
[50:13] meekness
[50:14] considering thyself least thou also be
[50:18] tempted
[50:19] be one another burdens
[50:22] and so fulfill the law of christ now
[50:24] these are those i want to come to for if
[50:26] a man thinks himself to be something
[50:29] when he is nothing
[50:31] he deceive it himself
[50:33] let's read it again
[50:35] for if
[50:36] a man
[50:38] think
[50:39] himself
[50:40] to be something
[50:42] when he is nothing
[50:44] he deceiveth himself in other words
[50:46] this person have a high opinion of
[50:49] themselves they give themselves a high
[50:52] return
[50:54] they tick themselves off
[50:57] his forces
[50:58] but let every man
[51:01] prove
[51:02] his own work
[51:03] and then shall he have rejoiced in
[51:05] himself alone and not in another for
[51:08] every man shall be his own burden
[51:11] let him that is taught that is you the
[51:14] believers
[51:15] in the word
[51:16] communicate unto him that teach it that
[51:18] is the ministry in all good things
[51:21] so we're supposed to be able to get
[51:23] effective feedback
[51:25] from you who are hearing what is being
[51:28] taught
[51:29] okay there's a word for you that's the
[51:31] instructions let him that is taught that
[51:34] is you are hearing us tonight in the
[51:36] word
[51:37] communicate unto him that teach it in
[51:40] all good things
[51:42] verse 7 be not deceived
[51:44] god is not mocked
[51:46] for whatsoever a man saw it
[51:49] that shall he also read
[51:51] let's look at that galatian scripture in
[51:53] the amplified
[51:55] brethren
[51:56] if any man be overtaken in misconduct or
[51:58] sin of any sort
[52:00] you who are spiritual
[52:02] who are responsive to
[52:05] and controlled by the spirit
[52:07] should set him right
[52:09] and restore
[52:11] and reinstate him
[52:13] without
[52:14] any sense of superiority
[52:17] with all gentleness
[52:19] keeping an attentive eye on yourself
[52:23] at least you should be tempted also
[52:26] beer endure carriwana's burden
[52:30] and troubles moral force
[52:33] and in this way
[52:34] fulfill perfectly
[52:37] the law of christ the messiah
[52:39] and complete what is lacking in your
[52:40] obedience today
[52:42] for if any person
[52:45] thinks himself to be somebody
[52:48] too important a condition to shoulder
[52:51] another's load
[52:54] when he is nobody
[52:56] of superiority except in his own
[52:58] estimation he deceives
[53:01] and deludes
[53:03] and cheats himself
[53:05] but let every person carefully
[53:07] scrutinize
[53:09] examine
[53:10] and test his own conduct
[53:13] and his own work and he can then have
[53:16] the personal satisfaction and joy
[53:18] of doing something commendable in itself
[53:21] alone without resorting to boasting
[53:23] comparison with his neighbor this is a
[53:25] great scripture this is a tremendous
[53:27] scripture
[53:29] my goodness
[53:30] so therefore you know some people
[53:32] 10 years ago we know it your candle
[53:34] light don't sign brighter by blowing
[53:36] minds out
[53:38] so if you want to
[53:39] do two words and blow and blue and huff
[53:41] and puff
[53:42] and you know tearing somebody down
[53:44] doesn't build you up
[53:45] actually tearing somebody down is just
[53:47] evidence you are dumb you want to pull
[53:48] them down to where you are that is why
[53:50] you would be at them at them and so like
[53:52] that so what is saying there you don't
[53:55] have to feel security superior superior
[53:59] because you're comparing it with
[54:00] somebody else you're boasting because
[54:02] your car is better or your household
[54:04] line or whatever money or status or rank
[54:07] or whatever it is
[54:08] but you have to know in yourself what
[54:11] works are you coming through to do for
[54:13] every man should have the beer
[54:15] be equal to understanding and calmly
[54:17] receive his own little load of
[54:20] oppressive thought
[54:21] let him who receive instruction in the
[54:24] word of god share all good things with
[54:26] his teacher contributing to his support
[54:29] be not deceived
[54:31] undeluded
[54:32] unmisled
[54:34] god will not allow himself to be smeared
[54:37] at scorned
[54:39] disdained or mocked by mere pretensions
[54:42] or professions or by his precepts being
[54:44] set aside
[54:46] he inevitably deludes himself who
[54:49] attempts to delude god for whatever mind
[54:52] souls that i want to do he shall reap
[54:54] all blessed be the name of the lord
[54:56] so of all the deceptions
[54:59] i believe one of the worst ones is
[55:02] self-reception
[55:05] because when somebody's received by
[55:06] another person
[55:08] it's not like they they're going to be
[55:10] deceived
[55:12] that is like a kind of temporary session
[55:14] because you don't know you you're
[55:15] hearing things they believe in things
[55:16] and nothing like that
[55:18] you see
[55:19] but when somebody is self-deceived
[55:23] that is something different
[55:25] he is deceiving himself
[55:28] he wants to believe the lie
[55:33] he doesn't resist
[55:35] defeat
[55:36] he really collaborated with it
[55:38] against his own self
[55:41] he
[55:43] gives up the fight
[55:44] he enjoy being deceived that is somebody
[55:47] just self-received in other words
[55:49] to be self-received is to lie to
[55:51] yourself
[55:53] self-deception
[55:56] has to do with an over
[55:59] estimations of self-worth
[56:02] and i got this from the internet about
[56:04] self-deception defined
[56:07] and it have this year
[56:09] self-deception is the process
[56:12] and i'll skip that one subreception is
[56:14] defined as the act of lying to yourself
[56:19] of making yourself believe something
[56:21] that isn't really true
[56:26] an example of reception is someone who
[56:28] convinced herself or her boyfriend loves
[56:30] her even though he has told us several
[56:32] times you want to break up
[56:34] let's just get us off
[56:36] self-deception is seeing the world
[56:39] the way we wish it to be
[56:41] rather than the way it is
[56:44] and when people have self-description
[56:47] they use their hopes
[56:49] needs
[56:50] desires
[56:52] theory
[56:53] ideology
[56:54] prejudices
[56:56] expectation memories and other
[56:58] psychological elements that construct
[57:00] the way they see the world
[57:03] that is what's the reception all about
[57:06] not accepting the reality
[57:08] and it has here
[57:10] and you have a couple of signs but i
[57:12] just want to take away one or two signs
[57:15] you are lying to yourself
[57:17] you don't even know it
[57:19] one of them is your emotions don't match
[57:21] your words
[57:22] have you ever tried to convince yourself
[57:24] that you will not you and you were not
[57:26] hurt or angry
[57:27] but your emotions told a different story
[57:30] you have tears running on your face or
[57:32] steam coming out your ears even to do
[57:33] you see everything is fine
[57:35] your emotions may even cut you off guard
[57:37] you wonder where these tears come from
[57:39] and why you are so mad when your
[57:41] emotions do not match how you see or
[57:43] think you feel
[57:45] there's a good chance you are lying to
[57:47] yourself
[57:48] but one of the big ones that struck me
[57:50] was this one
[57:53] when you are
[57:55] not open to input from others
[57:58] often often
[58:00] there are times you don't even want to
[58:03] know
[58:04] or accept that you are lying to yourself
[58:07] you believe
[58:09] that what you believe is the only thing
[58:11] that matters
[58:12] therefore
[58:14] you shut out any commentary from
[58:16] outsiders you don't want the input
[58:19] different perspective or opinion this
[58:22] will only shine light on the fact that
[58:24] you are lying to yourself
[58:26] and forced you to own up to it
[58:29] learn to accept feedback from people and
[58:32] you know i think what sunday is talking
[58:33] about people
[58:34] sometimes they want things to confirm
[58:36] what they really have in their heart
[58:38] whatever they have in their heart
[58:40] they tend to connect with something out
[58:43] there but it's already in the system
[58:45] but this is the big one here
[58:47] you are never wrong
[58:49] no matter what happen it wasn't your
[58:51] fault
[58:52] even if it was your fault you convinced
[58:55] yourself that it was not
[58:59] the problem with people who
[59:02] they blame others they're not accepting
[59:04] anything and i know that the others in
[59:05] church we have it all around people you
[59:07] cannot accuse them of anything it's not
[59:10] me it's not me it's not me it's not me
[59:13] they blame everybody else by themselves
[59:15] but here the problem with that
[59:17] the problem with this is that you will
[59:20] never write your wrongs
[59:22] or learn from your mistakes
[59:25] you tend to repeat the same scenario
[59:28] over and over again
[59:31] with different people
[59:33] or places
[59:34] you lie to yourself
[59:37] because you cannot accept
[59:39] that maybe it is you
[59:41] but let me assure you
[59:44] it is you
[59:45] and that's okay you can learn
[59:47] from it
[59:48] you can grow
[59:51] so that is something that i got
[59:53] i thought would help
[59:55] um i've seen over the years people not
[59:57] changing
[59:58] and it's almost like if i went to the
[1:00:00] don't care
[1:00:01] but
[1:00:02] you know it's just just getting old
[1:00:04] because you're not learning and to learn
[1:00:06] is to grow
[1:00:08] and learning is when we could say you
[1:00:10] know i already make up i made a mistake
[1:00:12] i i i shouldn't have done that i
[1:00:14] shouldn't have said that moses and all
[1:00:17] come out big prophet moses said you know
[1:00:19] what
[1:00:20] god told me that i'm not going over
[1:00:21] crossing the land he was angry at me
[1:00:24] for your sakes i
[1:00:26] i play myself he told me speak to the
[1:00:28] rock and i smoked the rock and god was
[1:00:31] displeased with that
[1:00:32] okay
[1:00:33] so let's go down now to our text that we
[1:00:35] wanted to get to which is first
[1:00:37] corinthians chapter 10.
[1:00:39] praise the lord i want to get to that
[1:00:42] text
[1:00:43] first corinthians chapter 10.
[1:00:51] define it
[1:00:53] praise the lord that shall be the name
[1:00:54] of the lord fourth christian chapter 10
[1:00:58] moreover brethren i would not let you be
[1:01:01] ignorant of how all our fathers were
[1:01:03] under the cloud and all paths to the sea
[1:01:06] and were all baptized into moses in the
[1:01:08] cloud and the sea
[1:01:10] and they'd all eat
[1:01:12] the same
[1:01:14] spiritual meat now notice here
[1:01:16] all baptized
[1:01:19] all eat same spiritual meat verse four
[1:01:21] and then all drink
[1:01:24] the same spiritual drink
[1:01:26] for the drunk of that spiritual rock
[1:01:29] that followed them
[1:01:30] and that rock
[1:01:32] was christ
[1:01:33] but with many of them
[1:01:35] god
[1:01:36] was not pleased
[1:01:39] for they were overthrown in the
[1:01:41] wilderness
[1:01:42] now these things
[1:01:45] were
[1:01:45] our examples
[1:01:47] to the ex in the intent
[1:01:50] that we should not lust after evil
[1:01:52] things as they also lost
[1:01:54] neither be idolaters as was some of them
[1:01:57] as is written
[1:01:59] the people sat down to eat
[1:02:01] and to drink
[1:02:03] and rose up to play
[1:02:05] neither let us commit fornication some
[1:02:07] of them committed
[1:02:09] and fell in one day
[1:02:11] three
[1:02:11] and twenty thousand
[1:02:13] knew let us tell christ some of them
[1:02:15] also attempted
[1:02:16] our destroy of serpents
[1:02:19] nina mumma yi are some of them also
[1:02:21] women
[1:02:22] are destroyed of the destroyer
[1:02:24] now all these things happen
[1:02:27] unto them
[1:02:28] for examples
[1:02:30] and they are written for our
[1:02:32] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[1:02:35] world are come
[1:02:37] wherefore
[1:02:38] let him that think at his time to take
[1:02:40] heed
[1:02:41] at least he fall
[1:02:43] they have no temptation taking you
[1:02:46] let's back up a little bit in verse 12
[1:02:49] wherefore
[1:02:50] let him that thinketh his standard
[1:02:52] ticket list before that applies from
[1:02:54] pulpit to backpack
[1:02:56] was the team
[1:02:57] they had no temptation taking you
[1:03:00] but such as is common to man
[1:03:02] but god is faithful
[1:03:05] who will not
[1:03:06] suffer you
[1:03:07] to be tempted
[1:03:09] above that you are evil
[1:03:11] but with the temptation also make a way
[1:03:14] of escape
[1:03:15] that he may be able to bear it
[1:03:17] wherefore my
[1:03:18] dear beloved
[1:03:20] free from idolatry
[1:03:22] so let's take some notes out of the
[1:03:24] scripture here
[1:03:26] that and and it was listed in a certain
[1:03:28] way
[1:03:29] to show all drunk
[1:03:31] or eat
[1:03:33] all baptized
[1:03:34] but god was not pleased
[1:03:36] with all
[1:03:38] i wonder
[1:03:40] if this same god this god of this
[1:03:42] scripture
[1:03:44] is to come around now
[1:03:46] how would this god see us
[1:03:50] i'm not talking about how you see
[1:03:51] yourself
[1:03:52] i'm talking about in the light of this
[1:03:55] scripture we all baptize
[1:03:57] we all in the message we all believe
[1:03:59] god's in our messenger prophet malachi 4
[1:04:01] with a marian brown
[1:04:02] you know we all go to church and so on i
[1:04:05] wonder
[1:04:06] this god we're talking about
[1:04:08] that i'm saying you cannot take his word
[1:04:10] or his truth or his servants or the
[1:04:13] facts for granted
[1:04:14] and you know um there's so much voices
[1:04:17] today and verbal which i mentioned about
[1:04:18] the voice of god in the last days
[1:04:20] and it draws out the voice of god it
[1:04:22] does it does
[1:04:24] the voice and everybody is now like a
[1:04:26] professional everybody because they have
[1:04:28] youtube and facebook and their live
[1:04:31] stream live face and whatever it is and
[1:04:33] everybody could talk hey we have a mouth
[1:04:35] and we have a camera is there a phone it
[1:04:37] was a reporter everybody's a news
[1:04:40] broadcast
[1:04:41] and they have tick-tock now everybody
[1:04:42] making some click on some story and they
[1:04:44] wanted to go viral and everything else
[1:04:46] so it gives people in their homes and
[1:04:48] houses people like
[1:04:50] you don't know if this living under
[1:04:51] umbrella but they give them a voice as
[1:04:53] long as they have a sim card on the
[1:04:54] phone they could talk to the world and
[1:04:56] they could change from the entire world
[1:04:58] and depend upon where they present
[1:04:59] somebody take it up and share it and
[1:05:01] whatnot so all these activities get
[1:05:03] people so busy and caught up in social
[1:05:05] media and everything else and yet
[1:05:08] the bible said i am god
[1:05:10] and i change it not
[1:05:12] he does not change he is the same
[1:05:15] what we want what we need what we must
[1:05:18] connect with is the god of the bible
[1:05:20] and we have to see ourselves going back
[1:05:22] to the bible back to the scriptures to
[1:05:24] get in contact with this living god i
[1:05:26] think i think on sunday or sometime i
[1:05:28] was talking about could you imagine a
[1:05:29] minister with complexes he would have
[1:05:31] the complexes he would be really complex
[1:05:33] a minister with issues it would be dear
[1:05:36] it will be affecting
[1:05:38] the the clarity of the word and whatnot
[1:05:41] if you have certain fears he'll put
[1:05:43] those fears on the people which he ought
[1:05:45] not to because we are supposed to be
[1:05:47] like like mute we supposed to be like
[1:05:50] like a microphone we have no
[1:05:52] song of our own we supposed to be a
[1:05:55] channel by which god could speak to his
[1:05:57] people his word his truth not a channel
[1:06:00] that interprets it for the people to
[1:06:02] tell them nice things and three things
[1:06:04] and things that the people want to hear
[1:06:06] that is politics that is politician they
[1:06:10] they tell people things that people want
[1:06:11] to hear and they give promises that they
[1:06:13] can't keep and this scripture about to
[1:06:15] read right now is one that's astonished
[1:06:18] me it's from isaiah
[1:06:20] chapter 30 we want to read from verse
[1:06:22] one to three and then we will go down to
[1:06:24] eight to fourteen isaiah chapter three
[1:06:26] this scripture just blew me away
[1:06:29] description
[1:06:30] this is god speaking
[1:06:32] about his children
[1:06:35] woe should rebellious children see the
[1:06:37] lord
[1:06:38] that take console but not of me
[1:06:41] and cover with the covering
[1:06:43] but not of my spirit
[1:06:44] that they may add sin to sin
[1:06:48] that walk to go down into egypt and have
[1:06:50] that ask at my mouth to strengthen
[1:06:52] themselves in the strength of pharaoh
[1:06:54] and to trust in the shadow of egypt
[1:06:56] therefore
[1:06:58] shall the strength of fear will be your
[1:06:59] shame
[1:07:00] and the trust in the shadow of egypt
[1:07:02] your confusion
[1:07:04] so you want to go in the world
[1:07:05] you want to benefit you don't want to
[1:07:07] put god god take you from where you are
[1:07:09] and you don't heap
[1:07:10] god bring you from nothing
[1:07:12] god bless you and whatnot i know you
[1:07:14] your your strength is the strength of
[1:07:16] egypt no longer the strength of god
[1:07:18] let's recognize that same thing one
[1:07:20] going to eat with it
[1:07:23] god speak it
[1:07:25] now go
[1:07:26] write it before them in a table
[1:07:29] note in the book
[1:07:31] that it may be for the time to come
[1:07:33] forever and ever
[1:07:35] that this is a rebellious people
[1:07:38] lying children
[1:07:39] children that will not hear
[1:07:42] the law of the lord
[1:07:44] this is the one that blew me out
[1:07:46] which say to the seers see not
[1:07:49] unto the prophets prophesy not unto us
[1:07:52] right things
[1:07:54] speak unto us smooth things
[1:07:58] prophesy
[1:07:59] deceits
[1:08:02] wow
[1:08:03] i read that one again
[1:08:05] which season the seer see not
[1:08:08] unto the prophets prophesy not unto us
[1:08:10] writings
[1:08:12] speak unto us smoothings
[1:08:14] prophesy
[1:08:16] deceit
[1:08:17] this is a people
[1:08:18] that don't
[1:08:20] want
[1:08:21] truth
[1:08:23] they don't want truth firstly them get
[1:08:25] out of the way turn aside out of the
[1:08:27] part
[1:08:28] cause the holy one of israel to cease
[1:08:29] from before us
[1:08:30] wherefore thus saith the holy one of
[1:08:32] israel
[1:08:33] because
[1:08:35] he despised this word and trust in
[1:08:39] oppression and perverseness and stay
[1:08:41] there on therefore this iniquity
[1:08:44] shall be to you as a breach
[1:08:46] ready to fall swollen out in a high wall
[1:08:50] who's breaking comments suddenly as an
[1:08:52] instant
[1:08:53] and he shall break it
[1:08:55] as the breaking of a potter's vessel
[1:08:57] that is broken in pieces
[1:08:58] he shall not spear
[1:09:01] so there shall be not be found in the
[1:09:03] boosting of it assured to take fire from
[1:09:06] the earth
[1:09:07] not to take water out of the pit
[1:09:10] and i want to read just with
[1:09:12] nine and ten
[1:09:14] in the amplified
[1:09:16] for this is a rebellious people
[1:09:18] faithless and lying sons children who
[1:09:21] will not hear the law
[1:09:22] and the instruction of the lord
[1:09:24] who virtually say to the seers by their
[1:09:27] conduct
[1:09:29] see not
[1:09:30] unto the prophets
[1:09:31] prophest prophesy not to us what is
[1:09:34] right
[1:09:35] speak to us smooth things
[1:09:38] prophesy
[1:09:40] deceitful illusions
[1:09:42] oh blessed be the name of the lord i'm
[1:09:43] going to church
[1:09:45] jeremiah chapter 29 i'm going to go back
[1:09:47] to jeremiah
[1:09:50] thus said the lord of hosts the god of
[1:09:52] israel jeremiah chapter 29 verse 4
[1:09:56] unto all that carried away captives
[1:09:59] whom i have caused to be carried away
[1:10:00] from jerusalem to babylon
[1:10:02] building houses
[1:10:04] dwell in them
[1:10:05] plant gardens eat the fruit of them
[1:10:08] oh my hallelujah
[1:10:10] praise the name of the lord
[1:10:13] blessed be the new i think i'll leave a
[1:10:14] part the scripture but we'll continue
[1:10:16] okay but isaac read the scripture when
[1:10:19] he was preaching about 2 thessalonians 2
[1:10:22] let the man deceive you that they shall
[1:10:23] not come except they have fallen away
[1:10:25] first the manners will be revealed
[1:10:27] now when it goes down further it says
[1:10:30] even him who's coming is after the
[1:10:32] working of satan with all power and
[1:10:35] signs and lying wonders
[1:10:37] and with all deceivableness
[1:10:39] of unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:10:41] because you know why they receive not
[1:10:45] the love of the truth
[1:10:47] that they might deceive
[1:10:48] and for this cause
[1:10:51] god shall send them a strong illusion
[1:10:53] that they should believe a lie
[1:10:55] that they might be damned who believe
[1:10:57] not the truth
[1:10:59] but had pleasure
[1:11:00] in unrighteousness
[1:11:02] but we are bound to give tongues always
[1:11:04] to god for you brethren beloved of the
[1:11:07] lord because god hacked from the
[1:11:09] beginning choosing you to salvation
[1:11:11] through the sanctification of the spirit
[1:11:13] and belief
[1:11:15] of the truth you have to see the truth
[1:11:18] as a living reality that god wants you
[1:11:20] to be part enough
[1:11:22] so i want to still let's see oh one
[1:11:24] second say things
[1:11:26] so they get it
[1:11:38] i still want to read a portion from this
[1:11:40] deuteronomy 29
[1:11:43] verse 4 to 12.
[1:11:46] all right
[1:11:52] all right i'll i'll confident okay
[1:11:55] praise the lord
[1:11:57] so so for this scripture here though
[1:11:59] because they receive not the truth the
[1:12:02] love of the truth
[1:12:03] that they might be saying for this cause
[1:12:05] then go to send them a strong delusion
[1:12:08] to believe a lie and it amplified it
[1:12:10] says and by unlimited deduction to evil
[1:12:14] with all
[1:12:15] wicked deception for those who are
[1:12:17] perishing because they did not welcome
[1:12:19] the truth but refused to love it that
[1:12:22] they might be saved therefore god sends
[1:12:24] upon them a misleading influence
[1:12:28] a working of error
[1:12:30] and a strong delusion
[1:12:32] to make them believe
[1:12:34] what is false
[1:12:36] in order that all may be judged and
[1:12:38] condemned who did not believe in who
[1:12:41] refused to adhere to and trusting and
[1:12:43] rely on the truth but instead
[1:12:46] took pleasure in unrighteousness
[1:12:49] oh my hallelujah
[1:12:51] oh praise god i know what happened
[1:12:54] i think i peace and i cut the scripture
[1:12:57] in between another one so that's why i
[1:12:59] couldn't seem to find it but in in the
[1:13:02] to jeremiah 29 scripture
[1:13:04] it says here verse 8 for dust see that
[1:13:07] the lord of hosts the god of israel
[1:13:09] let not your prophets and your diviners
[1:13:12] that be in the midst of you deceive you
[1:13:14] neither happened to your dreams which
[1:13:16] you have caused to be dreamed for they
[1:13:18] prophesy falsely unto you in my name i
[1:13:21] have not sent them said the lord
[1:13:24] and i want to wrap up this last
[1:13:25] scripture as we close we are coming
[1:13:27] close
[1:13:28] i'll share some things
[1:13:30] hebrews 12 1 and 2.
[1:13:32] wherefore seeing
[1:13:34] we are compassed about
[1:13:36] with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:13:39] let us lay aside every wheat
[1:13:41] and the sin
[1:13:42] which that so easily beset us
[1:13:45] and let us run with patience to race
[1:13:47] that is set before us
[1:13:48] looking unto jesus
[1:13:50] the order and finisher of our faith
[1:13:52] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:13:56] endure the cross
[1:13:57] despising the shame
[1:13:59] and is set down at the right hand
[1:14:01] of the throne of god friends
[1:14:04] i want to bring this to you
[1:14:06] to as a warning i i believe that this is
[1:14:09] what i felt to do and
[1:14:10] lord wanted me to share this with you
[1:14:12] not i warning you
[1:14:14] this is a warning for all of us
[1:14:16] a warning
[1:14:18] that all come to this word and this
[1:14:21] message and so on
[1:14:23] but that does not mean all is going to
[1:14:24] go in
[1:14:26] and you have to make your calling an
[1:14:28] election show
[1:14:30] you have to work out your salvation
[1:14:32] with fear and trembling
[1:14:34] you have to know
[1:14:36] what level of respect you have for god
[1:14:38] for his word
[1:14:40] and his servants
[1:14:41] and just remember this
[1:14:43] a man could claim to be a servant when
[1:14:45] god had to make a man his servant
[1:14:48] his servant
[1:14:49] many men makes claims but as if god has
[1:14:51] vindicated those claims that they have
[1:14:54] made
[1:14:55] we say and preach it over and over
[1:14:58] about the virtues
[1:14:59] about the bond of perfectness charity
[1:15:01] commenters feel the whole thing
[1:15:03] and the prophecy when that time comes
[1:15:05] prophecy then they become vindicated
[1:15:07] sons
[1:15:08] and vindicated daughters we know the
[1:15:10] scriptures power as many receive him to
[1:15:12] them give me power to become the sons of
[1:15:14] god
[1:15:15] power to grow
[1:15:16] power to add we know the scriptures
[1:15:18] jesus grew in grace and knowledge
[1:15:20] and he knew that the judgment of god was
[1:15:22] going to be poured upon him because he
[1:15:24] had to pay the price of of our sins and
[1:15:27] that's what caravea is all about
[1:15:29] we know there's going to be a press come
[1:15:31] down we know that the bride will be a
[1:15:32] hundred persecuted group a lot of stuff
[1:15:35] is yet to unfold and we
[1:15:39] have to search ourselves out to see how
[1:15:41] ready we are how prepared we are
[1:15:44] when
[1:15:46] the slaughtering angels was about to be
[1:15:48] loosed
[1:15:49] and the voice said stop there's an
[1:15:51] incoherent writer
[1:15:53] and the voice said go and put a mark
[1:15:55] upon those that signed cry
[1:15:58] upon about the abomination
[1:16:00] that gonna be people that have the right
[1:16:02] kind of good
[1:16:03] those that sign
[1:16:05] and crying
[1:16:06] that's a hard thing that's not a head
[1:16:08] knowledge thing you know
[1:16:10] immaculate beast and this and that and
[1:16:11] logical sequence and so that is not that
[1:16:14] that is being marked to be sealed marked
[1:16:18] by the word marked because of your
[1:16:20] attitude
[1:16:21] what did the bible talk about cornelius
[1:16:23] nation the bible said there was a
[1:16:25] memorial in heaven for him with his arms
[1:16:27] given on his constant prayer
[1:16:29] he himself was a certain spirit and
[1:16:31] attitude he got the holy ghost before he
[1:16:34] was even baptized in water
[1:16:36] that is how right his heart was in terms
[1:16:39] of condition peter himself didn't know
[1:16:42] why god bring this invitation to him to
[1:16:44] go there peter didn't even know he had
[1:16:46] to unlock the keys to the gentiles that
[1:16:48] the holy ghost could be loose among the
[1:16:50] gentiles but he had us to do it and god
[1:16:52] didn't tell him the whole story peter
[1:16:54] got a corner from when you speak the
[1:16:55] word or fall no god didn't do that
[1:16:57] god let it unfold that peter could say
[1:16:59] of a truth this holy is not for us jews
[1:17:01] only
[1:17:02] all those that fear his name could
[1:17:04] receive the same holy ghost
[1:17:06] so friends let me encourage you tonight
[1:17:10] let us run this race with patience
[1:17:13] let us put aside stuff i hope and i
[1:17:16] trust tonight
[1:17:17] could be the first day of the rest of
[1:17:19] your life that is different that you
[1:17:21] catch a seed
[1:17:22] of how god sees things
[1:17:25] that you're not you do not ever fight
[1:17:26] you but over a fight and we see
[1:17:28] it
[1:17:30] and this understand that we talk about
[1:17:32] tree rooms on sunday
[1:17:33] humanistic
[1:17:35] divine revelation
[1:17:36] and vision
[1:17:38] we could leave out the last one for now
[1:17:40] which is
[1:17:41] vision
[1:17:42] but you see that one in the middle
[1:17:44] divine revelation
[1:17:46] you need it
[1:17:48] not divine understanding not not
[1:17:50] understanding revelation
[1:17:52] because revelation
[1:17:54] gets the clarity and the understanding
[1:17:56] the way god sees it
[1:17:58] i can't remember it was in the bible
[1:18:00] somebody was in some kind of condition
[1:18:02] and um you know the judgment of god
[1:18:05] pouring out and and and they take a
[1:18:07] javelin and kill the person that was in
[1:18:09] that
[1:18:10] filthy condition and stay the hand of
[1:18:12] god and god was pleased with it
[1:18:15] because they want righteousness
[1:18:17] and they have to understand it's not
[1:18:18] that god wants to pull judgment
[1:18:20] his law is it is almost like an
[1:18:22] automatic thing
[1:18:23] that sin will attract judgment of beat
[1:18:26] off key bad behavior bad attitudes have
[1:18:30] a fruit
[1:18:31] seen and unseen
[1:18:33] consequences but as i will say this with
[1:18:36] secondary consequences of your actions
[1:18:39] and your attitudes
[1:18:41] and sometimes people think they're so
[1:18:42] very right
[1:18:43] and they wouldn't pause and say but if
[1:18:45] i'm not right suppose i'm wrong wrong in
[1:18:48] my thinking because you can't change if
[1:18:50] your mind doesn't change
[1:18:52] that's why you have to know things that
[1:18:53] are in people's hearts that's why we
[1:18:55] don't try to bomb and beg and harass
[1:18:57] people and drag them in
[1:18:59] because a man convinced against israel
[1:19:03] is of the same opinion still
[1:19:06] so friends you have to have in your
[1:19:09] heart tonight
[1:19:10] a desire to serve god in the true spirit
[1:19:14] of how you supposed to serve it
[1:19:16] there are many too many people
[1:19:18] just going to church
[1:19:20] and going back home it doesn't have the
[1:19:22] effect upon their lives
[1:19:25] but many god was not pleased
[1:19:27] the word is not mixed with faith
[1:19:30] if you know you are doing things that
[1:19:31] are wrong stop it
[1:19:33] if you know you're going places that you
[1:19:35] not supposed to go don't go there
[1:19:37] if you know you have the wrong kind of
[1:19:38] friends you are more friends in the
[1:19:40] world than in church you know you have a
[1:19:41] problem
[1:19:42] you have more unbelieving friends than
[1:19:44] people who are christians you have a
[1:19:46] problem
[1:19:47] you actually have a problem
[1:19:49] because you feel more comfortable with
[1:19:51] these unbelieving friends than with
[1:19:53] christian friends
[1:19:55] and sometimes people adopt that because
[1:19:56] they don't want to be exposed
[1:19:58] they don't want to have a testimony
[1:20:00] generally because you see your
[1:20:01] unbelieving friends you in them and he
[1:20:03] sends them as you may know more and more
[1:20:05] scriptures and so on so you like a you
[1:20:07] like a star
[1:20:09] but among your peers
[1:20:11] you might really find out how much you
[1:20:12] already starring
[1:20:14] but that is how god have us sword
[1:20:16] clinging against sword shocking one
[1:20:18] another
[1:20:19] where we could encourage one another or
[1:20:21] we could build each other
[1:20:23] oh my hallelujah and i was thinking
[1:20:26] so much covert deaths
[1:20:27] among the churches among believers among
[1:20:30] trinidad among the world
[1:20:32] and i'm thinking to myself how is such a
[1:20:34] lonely
[1:20:36] road
[1:20:37] a lonely debt this discovery people
[1:20:39] dying of covert
[1:20:41] you know
[1:20:42] on a normal basis when somebody dying
[1:20:45] you could have
[1:20:46] the family along the bedside
[1:20:49] you know little pronouncements and so on
[1:20:52] aunt quinn grandmother mother father
[1:20:54] whoever
[1:20:55] but with this school victim when
[1:20:57] somebody have covet
[1:20:59] there's no visit
[1:21:01] it's a lonely thing it's not like you're
[1:21:03] getting a visit from a loved one and
[1:21:05] somebody's saying farewell god bless you
[1:21:07] nothing like that
[1:21:09] everybody have to keep the distance
[1:21:11] because it's just
[1:21:13] sin contagious
[1:21:13] contagious you know
[1:21:15] unbelief is contagious
[1:21:17] yeah
[1:21:18] when those 10 spies came back
[1:21:21] and they said to the people we we speak
[1:21:23] we none of the good man and and
[1:21:26] we cannot take it
[1:21:27] that anointing that disease that that
[1:21:30] virus those twelve ministers bro those
[1:21:33] ten ministers broke when it dropped
[1:21:35] on on the people they they
[1:21:38] it take them
[1:21:41] when caleb come with some kind of
[1:21:43] inoculation to tell them you know what
[1:21:45] we are well able let's cooperate once
[1:21:47] it was too late
[1:21:49] it was too late

[1:22:26] but egypt's still in them
[1:22:28] he knows that
[1:22:29] and god give them time
[1:22:32] to see if he could get not often
[1:22:34] and forgive forget the things that are

[1:22:40] one i'm seeing a new land i mean
[1:22:43] food milk and honey i'm going to what's
[1:22:44] that

[1:22:46] they had their challenges along the way
[1:22:49] they couldn't plant nothing in in the
[1:22:50] wilderness that's not the land
[1:22:52] here they come at king spania
[1:22:55] here they come at the junction
[1:22:57] here they come let's see 2022 here they
[1:23:00] come
[1:23:01] they come to a place with a junction
[1:23:04] a junction in which the next move has to
[1:23:06] be a move of god
[1:23:08] the next move have to be
[1:23:10] uh if we can only get started god will
[1:23:11] do the rest and here it is god so you
[1:23:14] know what fellas
[1:23:15] all the very tribes send me their
[1:23:16] ministers their man of god five four
[1:23:19] ministers they claim to be let them go
[1:23:21] help spout their land bring back
[1:23:23] evidence to my people not my people it's
[1:23:26] not them they are not staring they have
[1:23:29] to bring evidence
[1:23:30] to vindicate that god is god to prove
[1:23:33] he's alive to prove he's not going to
[1:23:35] keep his promise and here it is they're
[1:23:37] going out and they come back and they
[1:23:39] come back yes the grapes is good and is
[1:23:41] good we see giants did the giants see
[1:23:43] you no we we didn't see us but we were
[1:23:46] like graspers through those guys
[1:23:48] when joshua and caleb came back they
[1:23:50] were astonished the place in mourning
[1:23:53] the place all dark dismal they had no
[1:23:56] anointing there's no worship there's no
[1:23:57] thanksgiving there's no praise there's
[1:23:59] no atmosphere
[1:24:01] that's almost insulting god
[1:24:05] came to stood up and said we are well
[1:24:06] able to take it
[1:24:08] and when they finish their drama
[1:24:10] god say you know what all of them 40
[1:24:13] years
[1:24:14] judgment
[1:24:16] the same people that came out
[1:24:18] judged
[1:24:19] the same people that came out they had
[1:24:21] books they had tapes they had services
[1:24:24] they had the prophet moses they had
[1:24:25] specials they had singing they had some
[1:24:28] such inspiration and all of that and
[1:24:30] they perished
[1:24:32] because they failed to go on and faith
[1:24:34] to believe what god had said and god
[1:24:37] told them that generation not going to
[1:24:38] make it
[1:24:39] that is what the wilderness was about
[1:24:42] that is what the was about that a new
[1:24:44] generation could be raised up a new
[1:24:47] people in the land
[1:24:48] dear children
[1:24:50] so god is not only interested in what is
[1:24:52] in front of him
[1:24:54] he's interested in the next generation
[1:24:56] what we share with our children what we
[1:24:58] share with our family what we share to
[1:25:01] each other
[1:25:02] positive or negative
[1:25:04] they are positive people they are
[1:25:05] negative people negative type people you
[1:25:07] don't want to be around i don't want to
[1:25:08] be around them
[1:25:10] no
[1:25:11] i want people of a spirit and an
[1:25:13] attitude like how they said caleb yeah
[1:25:15] that's another spirit with him
[1:25:17] you want people that would encourage you
[1:25:19] that would be supportive of you getting
[1:25:21] closer to god and fellowship with god
[1:25:23] and if you're truly in fellowship with
[1:25:25] god
[1:25:26] you will find yourself in fellowship
[1:25:28] with each other let's follow him
[1:25:31] almighty god i thank you lord
[1:25:33] for this time
[1:25:35] and i know it's a lot of scripture it
[1:25:37] might just sound like if we just read
[1:25:39] and read and read and read and
[1:25:41] but it's your truth it's your word many
[1:25:43] times we may not even go in the old
[1:25:44] testament
[1:25:45] and study a while
[1:25:47] lord we have seen
[1:25:49] from the scriptures
[1:25:50] prophets and men who claim that you that
[1:25:53] you sent them and you did not
[1:25:56] you yourself said you didn't you speak
[1:25:57] to them
[1:25:58] they got things from their own spirit
[1:26:01] their own mind they prophesy lies you
[1:26:04] didn't even send them but yet they are
[1:26:06] dear
[1:26:07] speaking to your people
[1:26:09] but god you promise
[1:26:11] that your elect in the last days
[1:26:13] will not be deceived
[1:26:15] father i didn't go down deep in it
[1:26:18] but lord it have self-deception
[1:26:21] and you talk about a man who thinking
[1:26:22] himself higher
[1:26:24] than he's supposed to think of himself
[1:26:25] and you spoke this in another scripture
[1:26:27] believe his philippians
[1:26:28] let no one think of himself higher than
[1:26:30] he's supposed to be
[1:26:32] and people think themselves
[1:26:34] above this above that they don't want to
[1:26:36] humble themselves they don't want to
[1:26:38] follow instructions they want to take
[1:26:40] guidance
[1:26:41] they want to govern and rule their own
[1:26:43] lives
[1:26:44] and you allow them to do that
[1:26:46] and if they continue along that road
[1:26:49] god is even a greater deception ahead
[1:26:52] help us lord to connect with the spirit
[1:26:54] of truth
[1:26:55] because jesus himself said you shall
[1:26:57] know the truth and the truth shall set
[1:26:58] you free
[1:27:00] free lives here today lord
[1:27:02] may they not stay in the backseating
[1:27:04] condition
[1:27:04] business stay in that lukewarm condition
[1:27:07] and most of all
[1:27:09] may they not stay in iniquity
[1:27:11] iniquity is knowing to do right
[1:27:14] and not doing anything about it father
[1:27:16] help them tonight may your blood speak
[1:27:18] on their behalf
[1:27:20] and deliver them

[1:27:26] and they got old and
[1:27:28] they try their best with their children
[1:27:30] without the tools without the means
[1:27:32] without the know-how and because of
[1:27:34] their spiritual attitude they have not
[1:27:35] received and learn and grow
[1:27:38] to direct
[1:27:39] and to give and to lead and to bring the
[1:27:42] kind of needed instructions in their
[1:27:44] home and families
[1:27:45] and no son one way daughter one way

[1:28:02] could give support lord the bible talk
[1:28:05] about let the older woman teach a
[1:28:06] younger woman how to love their husbands
[1:28:08] and because the older woman some of them
[1:28:11] never got debris to their own self they
[1:28:13] can't even teach
[1:28:15] because they don't even know what to
[1:28:16] teach
[1:28:18] and how to teach
[1:28:19] but lord raise up
[1:28:21] women raise up
[1:28:23] people that could
[1:28:24] participate

[1:28:28] others
[1:28:29] if ever there was a time of people
[1:28:31] needing help and support is this time
