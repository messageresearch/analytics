[50:00] we got it together and his presence is
[50:02] not here we just just is like a club you
[50:07] know it has no real family values we
[50:11] have is his presence we will die we're
[50:14] all dead
[50:15] we can't live without it when man fell
[50:18] and back stood in the Garden of Eden God
[50:22] send angels to guard that presence the
[50:25] presence of by the altar the presence of
[50:27] life and he had a drive man out because
[50:30] you have to keep his word but we tangoed
[50:33] in this hour the angels are trying to
[50:35] get us back in the presence and as
[50:38] unworthy as we are
[50:40] he still desire us to be in his presence
[50:42] because whereas before it was debt to go
[50:46] in Noah's debt to be without his
[50:48] presence so in the presence of God of
[50:50] opportunities of life of redemption of
[50:53] deliverance of healing of God
[50:56] ministering to you just where you have
[50:59] need of that's why you gotta here this
[51:02] morning forgot to speak to you you can
[51:05] pick this up in a grocery you can't buy
[51:06] you can't go and get a trolley and
[51:08] pickup the presence of God in a pharmacy
[51:10] or in a grocery you come to service
[51:12] because you have presence and life
[51:14] remember you're not just flesh and blood
[51:16] now you have a school a school that is
[51:19] precious to God so that God is concerned
[51:22] about a school that the devil trying to
[51:24] pull down to hell and the Angels trying
[51:26] to put you up to him and a soul inside
[51:29] of you is something inside idea that is
[51:31] precious to God more precious it's so
[51:33] precious he went and died on a cross to
[51:35] deliver you this is not the only world
[51:38] time is running out on your own life we
[51:41] only have one destiny inocent is to go
[51:43] along in the greens but beyond that
[51:44] there's a heaven we have loved ones
[51:47] already going on before we have seen so
[51:49] already died and gone before they are
[51:51] not dead in the ground then another
[51:53] dimension the width for the voice of the
[51:55] Archangel the rhythm of the voice of the
[51:57] resurrection they are not dead the only
[51:59] sleepin or praise my wounds either dead
[52:02] in Christ shall rise the dead in Christ
[52:04] shall rise there is going to be a
[52:06] resurrection that's right this all hope
[52:08] this even or glory to God it don't
[52:11] amount to much money you have how much
[52:12] buildings you have how much cars how
[52:14] much wealth you have it doesn't matter
[52:16] it all comes to naught or glory to God
[52:19] hallelujah but things are eternal
[52:21] comment not this worldly enriches that
[52:24] soon rapidly decay

[58:24] increased air of out of the field in the
[58:27] year of this Jubilee he shall return
[58:29] every man unto his possession let's go
[58:32] the first Corinthians is for chapter 14
[58:38] verse 8 for if the trumpet give an
[58:40] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[58:43] himself to the battle on our last

[58:56] come and whosoever will let him take of
[59:00] the water of life freely
[59:02] let us pray father we thank you for your
[59:03] word and here your people Lord different
[59:06] Minds here different spirits and
[59:08] different history and experiences
[59:10] sitting here this morning but you know
[59:12] every heart you know every life you in
[59:15] every condition you know the needs of
[59:17] your people but Lord you give this
[59:19] message to me and put up on my heart to
[59:21] speak it and I pray that the Lord that
[59:23] the whole effect of it will be it'll be
[59:25] effective to their lives Lord speak to
[59:27] them Lord and may they leave your change
[59:29] and transformed in Jesus name I ask it
[59:31] amen you may be seated
[59:39] so last week we had another year of
[59:42] jubilee and then judgment that that's
[59:45] coming this morning our title the
[59:49] trumpet of the Jubilee that's a title
[59:51] the trumpet of the Jubilee and I'm an
[59:53] inspiration come back to your original
[59:57] inheritance to a real Holy Ghost again
[1:00:01] come back to your original inheritance
[1:00:04] to the real Holy Ghost again so you love
[1:00:08] him this morning so I want to take you
[1:00:11] on a trip on a journey I want you to
[1:00:12] forget about you forget about your past
[1:00:15] forget about a history and trying to see
[1:00:19] if you could listen to what God is
[1:00:21] speaking because God has to speak and
[1:00:24] he's the boss what he says is truth
[1:00:29] whatever the word speaks to you that is
[1:00:32] the truth and that's what happened with
[1:00:34] the sign efficient woman with the
[1:00:35] daughter of x2 the devil Jesus said is
[1:00:37] not fit to take the church bread and
[1:00:39] cast as a dog and she's a truth Lord
[1:00:41] because real faith acknowledges the word
[1:00:44] to be truth because God knows what is in
[1:00:46] your heart you you have ideas and I want
[1:00:50] you to think your needs are but God
[1:00:51] really knows what you have need of so I
[1:00:54] want you when you hear a word and you
[1:00:56] receive the word set fruit Lord
[1:00:58] say Amen Lord so I believe it I receive
[1:01:01] it that's what God say you're accepting
[1:01:04] it say if God say you are free you are
[1:01:06] free if God say you I deliver you I
[1:01:09] deliver in court say your paths are go
[1:01:11] on your chains that fall it's fallen if
[1:01:14] God said you are forgiven you are
[1:01:15] forgiven doesn't matter what happened
[1:01:17] last night last year last 20 years it
[1:01:20] does not matter you have to listen to
[1:01:22] what God is telling you I don't care
[1:01:24] what the boss say what the neighbors say
[1:01:26] what believers say what people say has
[1:01:28] none do with them
[1:01:29] has to do with what God's saying to you
[1:01:31] when Jesus told a woman woman go and sin
[1:01:34] no more
[1:01:34] you are free woman he said you are free
[1:01:37] nobody could change that and who the son
[1:01:40] of man said free is free indeed you
[1:01:42] could call me a chain up and tire but
[1:01:43] God could break that off for you it
[1:01:45] doesn't matter who looked at you and
[1:01:47] hold and looked at you doesn't matter
[1:01:48] although he came to set the captives
[1:01:50] free he came to open up the prison doors
[1:01:53] he came to set as liberty them that are
[1:01:55] bruised
[1:01:56] God don't want to bomb Gordon won't you
[1:01:59] tide
[1:02:00] Gordon want you in Chains God wanted at
[1:02:03] the libertine because we are coming to
[1:02:05] the glorious liberty of the
[1:02:07] manifestation of the sons of God okay
[1:02:10] the Lord a shout you were born to be
[1:02:13] free
[1:02:14] glory not born to be comforted by demons
[1:02:17] and demonic oppression you are born to
[1:02:19] be liberated the woods are full of
[1:02:21] demons and Satan think that you belong
[1:02:24] to him all glory to God but he came to
[1:02:27] set the captives free
[1:02:28] we were once captives but Jesus came to
[1:02:32] free us from our captivity let me see
[1:02:35] the praise God
[1:02:37] Oh glory to God what is the Jubilee a
[1:02:41] Jubilee is a year of emancipation and
[1:02:45] restoration kept every 50 years so if
[1:02:49] somebody run poor we could read it and
[1:02:51] they fall in trouble and they couldn't
[1:02:53] pay their bills they stole into slavery
[1:02:55] you could only serve that slave master
[1:02:57] until they of Jubilee if you get money
[1:03:00] or some rich uncle come and redeem you
[1:03:02] they could deliver you and pay your
[1:03:03] bills and take you out but if you can't
[1:03:06] be if you have no money you have to wait
[1:03:09] until the
[1:03:10] and when they LG will become the
[1:03:13] instruction by God what's the song a
[1:03:15] trumpet throughout all the land nothing
[1:03:18] one corner throughout all the land
[1:03:21] nothing one little corner you have a
[1:03:24] play that you leave a private trumpet
[1:03:26] but says song is out 12 all the land
[1:03:30] that you could go free God's law said

[1:03:50] could we get our house Oh hallelujah
[1:03:57] so this Jubilee is a year of

[1:04:04] freeing someone from slavery but it's
[1:04:08] not just emancipation it's not just
[1:04:10] freedom is restoration also because God
[1:04:14] said you shall return to your family you
[1:04:19] shall return to your possession you
[1:04:22] shall return to what you lost doing a
[1:04:26] shout in the house blowing oh god you

[1:04:39] Oh glory to God hallelujah you are going
[1:04:43] to return to it may be seated for a
[1:04:52] Branham from Revelation chapter 5 he
[1:04:55] said now Ephesians 1:13 14 Poehler's we
[1:05:00] have an illness of our salvation the
[1:05:03] illness of our Redemption for it is the
[1:05:05] Holy Spirit that is the earnest of our
[1:05:08] Redemption the next few weeks of
[1:05:11] teaching will all be based upon
[1:05:14] redemption upon Redemption not
[1:05:17] justification
[1:05:19] it is based upon Redemption not upon the
[1:05:23] millet Oriole office of intercession but
[1:05:25] upon redeemed and inheritance that was
[1:05:29] lost or forfeited has been redeemed back
[1:05:33] to us again and how it all come about
[1:05:36] how God handed before the era was a
[1:05:39] world and home security Church is
[1:05:41] anchored so what we preach in is based
[1:05:43] upon redemption not salvation we're not
[1:05:47] talking about yourself you're not even
[1:05:49] talking about if you're worthy or not
[1:05:51] because this question comes to your mind
[1:05:53] you are unworthy because this happened
[1:05:55] that happened and you feel here and you
[1:05:57] feel here and you sin here and you did
[1:05:59] this year we're not talking about that
[1:06:01] we're talking about what God has
[1:06:03] redeemed you back to not what you feel
[1:06:07] but what God has said
[1:06:10] because Peter and James and John and all
[1:06:12] these brothers didn't know that their
[1:06:14] name is on the book they didn't know
[1:06:16] they were chosen
[1:06:17] they thought they were fishermen they
[1:06:19] thought it was just fathers and uncles
[1:06:21] and grandma tell it is but Jesus called
[1:06:24] them to show them a higher order to show
[1:06:27] them the higher purpose to show them
[1:06:29] that God ordained them into this
[1:06:32] glorious work in the last day
[1:06:34] Oh hallelujah the same God that's called
[1:06:37] Peter the same mother called Andrew at
[1:06:40] the same God I call you not a new God
[1:06:43] not a different God the same God okay
[1:06:46] the Lord I show not a different God the
[1:06:49] same God for glory of God and every
[1:06:53] issue
[1:06:53] he had his people and every house he
[1:06:56] left so he had to find them in every age

[1:07:02] every age
[1:07:03] Mircea to come here eh are we gonna
[1:07:06] bring a big word to you Chris to come to

[1:07:41] Jubilee Oh hallelujah
[1:07:44] praise God so the Prophet said you have
[1:07:47] got our feet and that's my purpose of
[1:07:49] doing this for the church here is to
[1:07:51] give the believers faith and confidence
[1:07:52] in where what they are standing for
[1:07:55] because it is the word of the Lord there
[1:07:58] as long as true the scripture is a
[1:08:00] sovereignity place I'm Genesis to

[1:42:26] when Moses ran away from easy Buddhist
[1:42:29] thought that wasn't enough he was

[1:42:48] look at the sea you think mom wouldn't
[1:42:49] run up get a look at my Sierra cause it

[1:42:56] just thinking he couldn't do at all and
[1:42:59] take some pictures and put it on
[1:43:01] Instagram Oh what's up or whatever it is
[1:43:03] when Moses gone on the unrecognized not
[1:43:05] normal fire and one-sided talk more in
[1:43:08] the bounnam bush
[1:43:08] more the response was I am this I am
[1:43:11] that I can talk all know and I'm not
[1:43:17] next weekend all you're going to know
[1:43:20] when his wife taught she come in to talk
[1:43:23] about a new furniture coming in detent
[1:43:26] he is telling her we pack and shop I'm
[1:43:29] removing out he said we're a go he's at
[1:43:32] the Egypt what for husband to take over
[1:43:35] now that kind of conversation looked
[1:43:38] like crazy talk but that wasn't crazy
[1:43:40] talk when God with an anointing upon
[1:43:43] your life for a purpose when God put a
[1:43:46] commission by the Thompson for a purpose
[1:43:49] nothing will stop it
[1:43:51] not your pass not your failures not just
[1:43:55] since nothing present nothing to come
[1:43:59] nothing gonna stop
[1:44:00] God's purpose moving fulfilling your
[1:44:03] life he will net all things to work
[1:44:07] together for your good your failures he
[1:44:11] gonna make it work you know she ain't he
[1:44:13] gonna make it work you're backsliding
[1:44:15] gonna make it work everything you'll
[1:44:17] make it work for your good that's why he
[1:44:21] brought the Jubilee year because you
[1:44:24] have to ensure
[1:44:25] and then come back into a balance order
[1:44:27] so the enemy can only hold it was so
[1:44:30] much I'm no longer God for the rain I
[1:44:33] became a trumpet of the Jubilee taught
[1:44:37] remain by having a Jubilee air that who
[1:44:40] only go free to go free or give the Lord
[1:44:44] some praises
[1:44:45] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God the
[1:44:50] earnest of our salvation is the baptism
[1:44:53] of the Holy Ghost without any
[1:44:56] organization so he's saying this Holy
[1:44:59] Ghost baptism is not in organization
[1:45:01] there's not a horizontal baptism and
[1:45:03] then a super sign he said in the church
[1:45:05] when it strikes that power of God I mean
[1:45:08] this is not preaching this they think
[1:45:10] they have it already when they strike
[1:45:12] the power of God the baptism of the Holy
[1:45:14] Ghost and he specified it out of the
[1:45:17] National churches out of the Catholic
[1:45:19] Church whatever it is it Hamid us when
[1:45:23] that baptism the Holy Ghost is made real
[1:45:26] to the people then that has
[1:45:28] predestinated like you people here to
[1:45:30] return alive sees it and walk in it it's
[1:45:34] a super sign when you have to realize
[1:45:37] nobody wanting only what you want it
[1:45:38] they don't want if you're gonna give it
[1:45:42] to you just well no one said Oh God is
[1:45:48] not interested in it and then he
[1:45:53] prophesied that there will come another
[1:45:55] year of Jubilee and when you begin the
[1:45:58] CD of Jubilee
[1:45:59] where we got the stream oh my
[1:46:02] that is the evidence that he has you

[1:46:12] that devil trying that he waitin for the
[1:46:14] wood to get on one time with God no Ice

[1:46:21] God as the prophet said a person that is
[1:46:23] insane or demon possessed have so much
[1:46:25] strength so much power take so much I'm
[1:46:27] meant to hold on somebody because demon
[1:46:29] activity a person life watch the other
[1:46:31] side is just as true when the Holy Ghost
[1:46:34] come upon your life and give you a super
[1:46:36] strength

[1:46:38] holy was coming upon somebody in a
[1:46:39] wheelchair that person could be crippled
[1:46:41] for 25 years but the super strength of
[1:46:44] the Holy Ghost coming up on their bones

[2:24:41] [Music]
[2:24:43] I'm gonna finish wrap up here finest
[2:24:47] c-span I reached boy Wow persecution
[2:25:10] always give strength to the church we
[2:25:13] have had it too easy usually even
[2:25:18] disappear we get shot full we get to a
[2:25:25] place where we don't want to move on
[2:25:27] because here why everything is handed to
[2:25:30] us it takes sorrow and tears and sweat
[2:25:35] and prayer and faith and promise to move
[2:25:40] forward in the power of the Holy Spirit
[2:25:47] see this is a path this filter people
[2:25:50] who own church and people who really
[2:25:52] want a reality
[2:25:54] Caracas not a gift that's white which
[2:25:58] sharpeners doesn't make sense something
[2:26:01] because if you get any worry of the day
[2:26:05] it just coming to kill you
[2:26:07] the trials coming to set you up because
[2:26:10] one want to use you and he can't use you
[2:26:12] as you are you have to be repackaged and
[2:26:15] to be repackage you have to sell it to a
[2:26:16] process so the part I want to share to
[2:26:24] you and you don't want to be shaped you
[2:26:25] don't want to put us wheel you say you
[2:26:28] like yourself as you are this take me
[2:26:30] and I am no God want to use you and he
[2:26:34] has to mold and shape you to fit you
[2:26:37] right because he is a program you have
[2:26:40] your own you know but he has his own too
[2:26:45] Paul before he was Paul was soll he had
[2:26:49] his program his program was to persecute
[2:26:51] Christians he had seal he had knowledge
[2:26:54] he re enthusiastic he had the fire and
[2:26:57] he got permission to persecute them and
[2:26:59] he goeth left us to catch them give me
[2:27:02] the names I want the names onion pizza
[2:27:04] one find them nobody asked every
[2:27:07] volunteer so he only voluntary admission
[2:27:10] to conquer Christians right near
[2:27:12] high-horse fire hit him because God had
[2:27:16] plans with power hit them because
[2:27:19] quarter inches and that man called Saul
[2:27:21] because God knew he will profit
[2:27:23] God knew his name will change to Paul
[2:27:25] god call him and go out to arrest him I
[2:27:29] assured him that man different and when
[2:27:36] God finished with you you'll be a
[2:27:37] different man you are going to be
[2:27:40] changed so I am prophesied over your
[2:27:43] life you'll be a different man than you
[2:27:46] over the past 40 years or 30 years or
[2:27:47] whatever you'd be a different man God
[2:27:49] will change your walk and change the
[2:27:50] talk of change your life we do a much
[2:27:56] sign you know all of a sudden might
[2:27:58] running for president in America right
[2:27:59] now he might a man and he on the tablet
[2:28:04] and he wound up in pools it's back to
[2:28:08] Sodom again and they bawl with it and if
[2:28:12] they bawl with it we have to be born
[2:28:13] with our testimony because the prophecy
[2:28:18] spirits don't die it have a time for
[2:28:20] spirits today
[2:28:21] just as when the Sun nor the spirits
[2:28:23] coming back so as generation comes free
[2:28:26] stuff upon them
[2:28:26] Michael Jackson borne by the demon that
[2:28:28] was upon him following somebody else or
[2:28:33] glory to God so God want to release that
[2:28:37] spirit there was a pond or turns upon
[2:28:40] Enoch there's a pond Sampson
[2:28:42] there's a pond Chester elefantes it does
[2:28:45] upon Joshua you want to lose that sprit
[2:28:47] upon you because every age had
[2:28:51] suspicions the Spirit of God upon him
[2:28:54] Oh glory to God we believe that and God
[2:29:00] called you to be a warrior of the faith
[2:29:02] in this hour I believe that around my
[2:29:04] heart you call for something higher
[2:29:05] let's see we could wrap up here oh my
[2:29:08] it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and
[2:29:12] pray and feet and promise to move
[2:29:14] forward in a pot holy spirit that's
[2:29:16] zealand power that they had in those
[2:29:18] days as a long time vanished out of the
[2:29:20] assemblies I'm afraid of the windows
[2:29:22] were shuttled tonight people run
[2:29:23] everywhere never come back again you
[2:29:26] know when we got everything so easy we
[2:29:29] just slip along and the first thing you
[2:29:31] know we go on out losing or inheritance
[2:29:34] did you notice as you read Leviticus 25
[2:29:38] gone if you have read it that if a man
[2:29:41] brought a property property inside of a
[2:29:44] walled city he had wanted to redeem that
[2:29:48] back if he sold it if he did not redeem
[2:29:52] that back that property it was inside of
[2:29:54] the wall at the stadia it could not go
[2:29:55] free individually it was bunk to stay
[2:29:58] there they will go over a wall because
[2:30:01] song the trumpet it couldn't go free and
[2:30:04] I'm afraid why this is all the
[2:30:07] old-timers preach against organizing
[2:30:08] ourselves together we turn around and
[2:30:10] done the very same thing in a walled
[2:30:12] city I'm afraid too many of us
[2:30:13] Pentecostal people have got walled into
[2:30:15] some denomination if is the open field
[2:30:20] they could hear the trumpet I'll go free
[2:30:21] but then wall up churches and whatnot
[2:30:23] trouble oh my the one that was walled in
[2:30:27] never got to go free they were born
[2:30:30] slaves the rest of yet Walden see three
[2:30:36] Oh hallelujah praise God amen glory
[2:30:42] watch this part now if a man become a
[2:30:47] servant and he bought a brother no a
[2:30:50] brother could be redeemed by a kinsman a
[2:30:53] kinsman could come and get him in the
[2:30:55] year of the Jubilee could redeem him
[2:30:56] what a beautiful Christ picture how how
[2:30:59] a pilgrim sold out the organization but
[2:31:04] a kinsman brother that's you I'm talking
[2:31:06] who knows he's out there some night put
[2:31:09] his Bible on this ham and go after him a
[2:31:12] kinsman because he got the same spirit
[2:31:15] he's born of the faith family go call
[2:31:17] him out of that group so there are
[2:31:19] people that will be call out of groups
[2:31:21] my kinsmen say you're not quite a wolf
[2:31:25] another organization you're not going to
[2:31:27] labor for that group we comment to call
[2:31:29] you to work for the kingdom of God
[2:31:31] people serve in church is not the
[2:31:33] kingdom Oh hallelujah
[2:31:35] now a man and his family could go back
[2:31:38] to the original heritance if they could
[2:31:41] hear the jubilee trumpet song and know
[2:31:43] what it meant to them now if they heard
[2:31:46] the priests song the trumpet the
[2:31:48] minister the trumpet is the gospel when
[2:31:50] they hear it in the north means and in
[2:31:53] no other inheritance no matter what they
[2:31:55] lost how far they went back whatever
[2:31:58] they had to do they had the privilege to
[2:32:01] come and receive inheritance the whole
[2:32:03] family could come whole family the whole
[2:32:06] family say whole family again one more
[2:32:09] time whole family whole family come
[2:32:12] whoever could come so this is not you
[2:32:19] know waiting for the chief citizen or
[2:32:21] they'll be fine my dear family did not
[2:32:22] the foolishness become utter foolishness
[2:32:24] you judge in the orientation enough for
[2:32:27] you to do your duty is a short because
[2:32:32] the Lord gives you the city your
[2:32:34] treatise the praise and worship God
[2:32:36] glory to God and this is where I got
[2:32:40] inspiration from but Aram said so it is
[2:32:42] tonight men of Louisiana to know the
[2:32:45] things that we do know and have heard
[2:32:47] from our brother and different ones of
[2:32:49] our Pentecostal experience years ago we
[2:32:51] haven't wore all ourselves away from it
[2:32:53] so far as we got to hear that somebody
[2:32:55] says instead of God say the Lord he said
[2:32:57] this is the of Jubilee come back to your
[2:33:01] original inheritance to the real Holy
[2:33:04] Ghost again remember he could go free he
[2:33:08] didn't have to pay nothing didn't after
[2:33:10] do nothing just get up and go
[2:33:15] so you walk in here like a sinner
[2:33:17] are you live here like I seemed did you
[2:33:23] yell at your walking in at the sinner
[2:33:26] and you leave a like a sin because
[2:33:29] you're free Oh glory to God nobody can
[2:33:33] tell you cash out nobody can tell you
[2:33:35] the cat praise God they have to be crazy
[2:33:38] or give the Lord a shout in their house
[2:33:41] [Applause]
[2:33:49] all they had to do is to go back if he
[2:33:52] knew the son of a strumpet but he had to
[2:33:54] know this song of the trumpet Oh
[2:33:57] hallelujah do you know that trumpet song

[2:34:02] sons of God in the name of Jesus Christ
