father come and confirm your word change and transform hearts and lives bless those connected even live right now be a minister to each one may presence of god fill every heart for every home fill their lives with your love and presence and power we need you lord we are dependent upon you and we are awaiting you tonight in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you if my bibles and i get attention to one scripture luke chapter 24. you want to read from verse 49 to 53 thank you so much for coming out tonight and uh creating such an atmosphere amen luke chapter 24. we want to read from verse 49 to 53 and this is jesus words in verse 49 it's read luke 24 49 and behold i send the promise of my father upon you retiring the siege of jerusalem until you be endured power from on high and you led them out as fast as bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and we're continually in the temple praising and blessing god amen may god bless his word you may be seated oh praise the name of the lord thank you lord jesus tonight our title is the attitude that brings the results is the attitude that brings results and i have an inspiration the atmosphere of judah perfection i want to encourage you tonight to stay in the woods in the atmosphere of the world if you're in the wrong atmosphere you cannot get the results that you're looking for so we want to share some things with you tonight that we feel upon our hearts that would help you and strengthen you and edify you and the prophet was spoken about a message a personal experience with god 1954 and he was chained about moses how moses has been a bit had been a bitter failure for yet knowing that god is going to deliver the children of israel by him yet trying to do it within himself 40 years before that become a failure had lost all the vision of victory and of the freedom of the people enslaved see when you lost the vision you you just does not be burdened anymore to do what needs to be done because if god called you qualified job he called you to enlist you into his program his plan of redemption isn't that right and the prophet i wonder sometimes if we the church knowing that god is promised to deliver the church from its sin from its sickness and to make us a people our salty people that the earth will hunger and taste after i wonder in our human efforts in our theologies and so forth our great fine buildings and so forth as we try to present the people many years ago we found it has failed because we took it in ourselves to do so we took it upon ourselves to have new schools educate ministers we left off the real principle the real thing that god told us to receive was to let the holy spirit lead the church we have left that off we have lost our divine joy and the vision is dull now so when that joy is there you can't wait to come to church you can't wait to be in service you can't wait to be in the presence of god because this is your source this is your inspiration this is where you're getting your drawing from isn't that right people are not looking for the coming of the lord yet atomic bombs hanging everywhere people have lost their vision of the lord because they have set times that the lord will come a certain time and have done all these things how can we do those things without the holy spirit moses have been a bit of failure but oh dear we see the tension attracted to a burning bush isn't that right fire attracts the people now watch fear tick a hole right quick when moses stood aside to consider this burning tree god spoke to him a fresh vision by an angel so when the vision get dull sometimes god had to give you a fresh word a fresh anointing a fresh inspiration a fresh fire amen that still you up again to the vision of god that god has put inside your soul that's what the church need tonight watch watch watch now watch faith take a hold right quick the old things passed away moses no has a new vision he has a revelation he has an experience vision revelation and experience he had met god he had talked to god before that he had not met god he only read and knowed what his mother had told him by hearing what his mother told him by what the pastor said but now moses had a personal experience so you read the spoken word books you're not glossing a prophet be all i send you elijah like what you read that's what you receive that's what you understand but now you have to get your personal experience with god not reading a book not listening to a tape but with the same pillar of fire oh glory to god because that filler fire come to activate the sons of god oh glory to god couldn't somebody say amen that pillar of fire come to activate the sons of god so you should want to be god activated oh not intellectually activated god every scripture is god bleed the breath of god is upon this word oh hallelujah that's what the church needs tonight is stop studying so much theology and get down to the altar and pray until a personal experience burned down in the human heart and burns out all the dullness and gives a new vision oh glory to god we need a fresh altar call every man at the altar every man repented every man crying out whatever said enjoy let the priest hold on to the horns of the altar let him cry for the wine and cry for the oil and then god said enjoy you and i will restore to you the years that the locals had eaten the palmer woman eaten when after they cry out oh glory to god he said what releases the prayer meeting they say lord send on the adoption oh glory to god we are teaching for 40 plus years it's time for fire it's time for power oh glory to god we have to create the atmosphere because the atmosphere is what you're gonna get the results [Applause] hallelujah glory to god amen may be seated praise god praise god amen faith in god it's a staggering to many people and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves to confess we don't have faith in god first there's cowards who die ten thousand nets while they're hearing it a hero never dies his memory lingers on for his heroic deeds and usually here we go people who have faith are people who have experience experience brings faith oh glory to god you hear what you hear that experience brings fate so when moses met that pillar of fire nobody could stop moses to tell him and talk him out to going back to egypt and if you ask well this is where you're going he's here to take over oh glory to god what he couldn't do in 40 years he was doing instantly because he met the pillar of fire and barabba stood and prophesied he said god will do in one year what all theologians fail to do in two thousand years you wait till that little remnant that god's gonna give that elijah wait till they go to the corner of god before you wait it's coming it's coming it's coming oh glory to god these are not plain words every word is a seed he said wait till them seven times after their voices that that people who can take the word and hand the deer oh glory will slice and cut they can't shut the heavens they have to do whatever they want to do [Applause] we don't have to ask permission for god to deliver your family we letting your family go we say pharaoh let them go you are free tonight lose them and let them go [Music] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah not the preacher experience is your experience you have to get your own experience i need experience being fit when then gossiping our prophets is one of us back to the faith of the fathers that when we have go back to an experience that the father fathers had because they had an experience hallelujah and jesus sent them in the upper room they gave them the promise of the father and the bible said they were in the upper room they were praising and blessing god continually what were they doing they were creating an atmosphere and they were staying in the atmosphere it all depends upon your attitude that's going to bring the results but we have to create an atmosphere the atmosphere is what makes a difference oh the song leader was singing tonight and he didn't know what to do the anointing and building is the atmosphere it take away the blues it removes your frustration it affects the bad day you had corrects all of that what this does it is the atmosphere the atmosphere of the holy spirit that will say our power the opposite of god we need that atmosphere you want that atmosphere you want it in your house you want it in the kitchen you want it when you leave out when you leave the home you want that [Music] [Applause] [Music] atmosphere you want to bring your home under the atmosphere let's continue the wood is a seed message called fellowship 1955 and the seed won't grow unless it's placed in the right kind of ground so the sea is not the is problem atmosphere or the ground right ground if the policy sit on top of here it's not growing at all because that is not for seeds that that is something else see that to go in the right gun ground isn't that right so no matter how much seed you got if you are afraid to sow it the seed will do you no good but listen to this every word of god is a seed you said so and every promise of god will come to pass if you will receive it and don't doubt it and can place it in your heart and believe it come from god and water it with faith it will spring forth of its kind don't never forget this statement and make this from my heart the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass [Music] don't forget that don't forget that all glory the right attitude that woman jesus called a dog it's not fit to take the children's bread and casted the dogs she stood right there she didn't move she didn't walk out of the building she gets expedient or the pasta or the elder she backs because of what jesus tell her she stood a gun right there she said even the dogs get crumbs off the masters table she was locked in she was focused she had the right attitude she was in an atmosphere of fate that nothing wasn't moving her nothing could tore off nothing could affect because she had a need that terror was upon her daughter and she want that devil off or give the lord a shout do you have a need here tonight [Applause] do you have a need i need a breakthrough i need a deliverance i need a healing i need a restoration indeed of the joy of god and neither the holy ghost i need a revival i need a fresh vision whatever your need is tonight we can supply your needs tonight oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah the only thing you have to do is to water the seed and you water the seed by worship you wanted to see by praises that's why a lot of churches don't know the churches sit there dead not see their watering they're only hearing word word word word word but they take our atmosphere praise god of watering of worship that's why we every time we come said give the lord a shout of praise [Music] because some point in time we have to have this continually you can't help it it's like automatic once you come inside of here you just have to worship god you don't care who are the side of you who in front of you if you just lost the play or they fired you that have nothing with it the devil is a liar praise god you're not you're not serving god because you're getting paid you're saving god because you're calling to serve him oh glory to god you lost your insurance you lost your car that does not matter you hear the praise god you had to wonder what's happening tomorrow he gonna take care tomorrow you don't even know if there's gonna be tomorrow but give the lord a shout tonight no faith [Music] [Applause] not tomorrow right now no [Applause] fantasy you put me on record tonight in these recorders i have no apology for this remark i'm fixing to make i believe and can prove that the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass the right mental attitude but you've got to have the right attitude the attitude is what brings the results [Music] [Applause] [Music] the attitude is what brings the results [Applause] elijah elijah walk up there with a woman who gonna take some stick and eat one bit more big for she and his son to die and he said bake me a kick first she had a choice she gotta say listen this this little bread are gonna make here it's for me and my boy this is our final supper that's it she could have said that she s but she went and turned in obedience to make that man of god a big face and when she turned she had just said the lord what the little you have to multiply whatever you got i will multiply it and that was in a time of famine [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah the attitude is what brings the results mata mary lord if it had been here my brother had not died [Music] she pushing she pushing she pushing first gear secondly but even now and when she pushed that get even now and she's throwing that gear jesus couldn't help it where have you laid him my god you anointed me with resurrection power you anointed me with the dynamics to the mechanics [Applause] [Music] [Applause] glory attitude i attitude that push god that forces god that pushed his issue may be seated praise god praise god the attitude is what bring the results [Applause] jesus in the wedding wine run out and they come to jesus what he has to do with that he's a guest like everybody else but his mother said whatever he say just do it don't question it don't argue with it don't fight it just do it he said get some water but enjoy it and when it's at the pool water you see water you've seen wine he could turn water into wine he could take your word and turn it into revelation i'm giving the stimulation of the revelation of the wine of god oh come on say man somebody you could be a giant as a biscuit but if the lord come among us he could turn that water into wine [Applause] water into wine praise god but the brandon says that the attitude from when it is only supernatural the attitude of the people is what brings the results the attitudes about somebody can make a bad spirit you see because the religious man the canal man have a religious atmosphere around him they're not saying only come at the church the spirit in them they don't want to stay home they come in the church but the communists get troubled religious atmosphere they like to worship they like you singing anything like that but when you see a boss of water correct them they fly out they can't take instruction they can't take rebuke the tactic correction but every scripture is god breathed and is profitable for doctrine for rebuke for correction because jesus had as many as i love i rebuke and jason we're not here to pamper your spirit your spirit have to get busted and broken up because you have to get a replacement of your spirit [Applause] listen listen listen justification is the atmosphere to know that you are saved and god save you god bring you into that atmosphere that's what luther did sanctification bringing a higher atmosphere now you are saved you are sanctified then the holy spirit coming to baptize you to bring it to a higher atmosphere and then the prophet brought the word to drop through the perfection the capstone word into the holy ghost atmosphere to cap your life we have to pressure on brethren from jacob grace and to truly perfection we have to press on because we have to get them to the resurrection it will take perfection to get there okay the lord i shout in the house it will take our atmosphere no wonder he said the bride have to bring the atmosphere because no minutes there could be a revival the people have to bring the revival [Music] [Applause] let the people assault right now [Applause] you you my brother you my sister you have to bring your atmosphere and you have to bring it from your house you have to bring it from your home you can't bring it here you have to bring it from home you have to bring it from home go get your lord our praise offering [Applause] [Music] that's a big order tonight what we're saying you may be seated i'm saying this atmosphere have to be in your home i personally have to be in your home you have to have the right attitude what we're saying because this is what you must want you must want the atmosphere in your home and you just add fire on it you out to earth you're meditating on the lord blessed is the man oh glory to god hallelujah who walked up on the council of then godly no stand in the way of sinners nor sit in the same discord but his delight is in the law of the lord and in that law that he meditated day and night what's happened to that man he's in an atmosphere oh glory is blessed the word is around him he's in the word atmosphere oh glory to god brother branham was in the atmosphere when that maniac man was coming to beat him up ministers run off the platform but stayed in the atmosphere he didn't run because that devil is backing up no son of god no devil and backing up no sun that called this hour come on we are here to back them devils up but around i'm staying in the atmosphere oh glory to god he said because you challenge the spirit of god you shall follow my feet undermined the atmosphere [Music] why you think the devil has initiate corals and fossils and family callers in the home to show you all the atmosphere when you already must say you don't want to come to church you're vex you're angry you can't sing nothing he don't throw you off already because you'll miss his objective so instead of cooling down this one and cooling this one you adding fuel with the fire and required getting hotter like that that was what you need to do the first getting harder higher the flame going more your job is a cool lonely flame and the wife out the tune gets her in tune if the husband out at you be sweet sweeten him with his foolishness get creative atmosphere and get him out of that he had a high day grumpy he ain't gonna come home sweet you create the atmosphere when he come he say i'm happy to be here are you more vexed than he because you studying you because you had a tough day home i i didn't come here for that you know i come here to talk about the atmosphere i didn't come here to go into that i come here to talk about the atmosphere and i find myself going down inside the deer oh hallelujah praise god create the atmosphere drop it drop it you don't have to answer back you don't have to pick on every little thing and you're hanging here and you're thinking here you're thinking here because you have a moat shut up keep a stilton oh mark the perfect man he could bridle his tongue oh give the lord a shout don't know what i'm saying tonight but i'm inside of there already oh glory to god a perfect man could handle that tongue oh glory to god that tongue to speak death or life speak lies speak deliverance speak pray through speak love speak fire speak pray through [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the reason here but around the reason are pentecost they had to go in an upper room and pray until the holy ghost came because they got in one place and one accord it's the atmosphere that brings the results aha all right attitude bring the results and the atmosphere bring the results so god send them there to wait until they have the right atmosphere because holy ghost comes and dry holy ghost got coming on a dead church they take an atmosphere to make that atmosphere [Music] listen listen when jesus died those guys were under depression and frustration and all kind of thing like that because the master gone who crying who's sad and all kinds of things like that even the woman and the sisters had more revelation inspiration than some of them brothers because the angel tell them sisters go and tell them i'm not dead telling me raise from the dead them them running with message and brothers saying if except a touch and i feel i will not believe you know what i'm talking about i believe you know who following jesus you know except i touch and feel says they feel nothing they say we've seen him he's risen we see him they still i believe daryl when jesus appeared to them he said come come you want to touch come and touch come and touch don't run now come and touch they say die be afraid so when you meet them talking the negative talk and jesus he said rebuke them he's all fools and slow of heart to believe all what i said this is what's showing you all the time that i have to suffer these things i even tell you if i don't go recover that will not come know that i'm here i'm showing you now because they're coming now they're happy because they comfort they're going about to come so let me tell them behold i send the promise of my father they knew exactly what they was going to receive power power power you shall receive the holy ghost you shall receive power after the holy ghost the comforter the token the dynamics rebecca's veil come upon you [Applause] [Music] and they returned to jerusalem half depressed and frustrated no with great joy i like that not joy great joy happy you should be happy praise god aren't you happy i show you happier than the president of your united states of america donald trump don't have joy like you have joy right now he don't even know what he has right now he has problems and double problems with double problems but you have joy because you're coming into power you communicate your promise you coming to anoint him oh glory to god there'll be a super race there'll be a super church that's a prophecy hallelujah oh glory to god the bride has no revival yet it will take them seven thunders to wake up that bride that's a promise laying over you what we see at to make a church that should make a revival that we will find them everywhere that's in the seven thunders of revelation 10 is being made manifest [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory you know what's happening we closing the talking part of the message and we're moving into the manifestation part we're closing the talk and talking talking but the manifestation will be the interpretation of what the prophet said this is that oh glory to god that is what we need to hear this is that but the prophet william branham smoker [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let every man and woman in this building this morning boy a girl get everything from their minds but the lord jesus and believe that he is standing present right now and you will see something happening that will cause headlines in newspaper in the morning he said that's right it's the atmosphere if we get it right headlines gonna be made because the pillar fire will hang right over this building [Applause] you really believe that yes sir i really believe that same pillar of fire that hang by night cloud by day can hang right over there [Applause] let the world know he's with you [Applause] let the whole are trained i know he is with you that's the god we serve he's a living god he's a moving god he's a supernatural god he sells heals he still seals he still delivers he still breaks the bands of wickedness he still break the bands of evil he still delivers sisters from the head spirits he is god and god alone [Applause] he said you could take an egg from a ham and put it on that puppy it will hatch he said it's the warmth of the puppy's body it is the atmosphere oh glory you heard what he said put an egg under a puppy it's gonna hatch and produce a chicken because it is the oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god and it is the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and wonders and the powers of god among the people it is the atmosphere of the people and when people get to a place that they're reasoning and wandering and skewing and thinking and they all talk and don't know where they stand half of them are even scripturally taught how can you expect the atmosphere to be right so for this world to be fulfilled it has to bring an attitude in god's people that would create the atmosphere that he could step into it do you understand what happened in the upper room my god there when the day of pentecost was fully calm they were in one mind they were in one accord mary wasn't playing more spiritual than brother james and she's the mother of jesus no god gave mary some days to get that thing off of her shoulder all this stuck up thing that she is jesus she had to die out to that every man jakarta today peter had to die everybody was under promise in that room at apostle and pastor and prophet and teacher every man jack waited for fire every officer was written for power every gift was written to be placed oh glory to god hallelujah give the lord a shout oh nobody hide in this one and bigger than this one if peter was in his human spirit he'd never step out after receiving the holy ghost but peter knew he had the keys peter no he was placed so he stepped out and said these people are not junk as you suppose but this is that that the prophet joel speak of oh my god one day we're gonna identify the manifestation of these quotes it wouldn't just be caught in the prophet it'll be saying this day this scripture is being fulfilled in your ears your people being set free when when john the baptist was getting old and and his eyes getting dim and john disciples then jesus are you the one or should we look for another you know what jesus said go tell john the blind received their sight crippled walking dom speaking he said i am he just tell him the manifestations that has taken place tell him about the supernatural working power of the holy ghost tell him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i trust tonight go create a twist in you full reality a manifested reality of the glory of god money you've got to meet him but i'm talking about the woman with the blood issue she had a blood issue and she told herself if i could touch the hem of this garment money ran out to that small church a lot of noisy people ranting and raving and carrying on things like that don't go but she had enough at his blood losing things she know she time is gonna be short she told herself she created a promise with herself she never see there's no scripture she told herself something instead of saying i go there to go there tell yourself something now tell yourself something nice pick yourself something right take a second delivered tell yourself you're gonna get a breakthrough tell yourself you'll get the whole ego don't say it i gotta sit there no no no don't talk like that come on now come on now have the right i don't speak like that my situation all messed up no tell us if god gonna sort out your situation you can't sort it out but he can [Applause] [Music] [Applause] listen to this here's a woman touch his garment she was healed with a bloody shoe a soldier spit in his face and put the crown of thorns on his head and felt no virtue they roughing up jesus no virtue coming unto them and i won't want to bless you just touch the hem of his government and vote you flow right out and heal that woman then he said it's your approach the attitude is what it takes and that is what it says tonight dear friend it takes the attitude are you ready we are and believe we are in the presence of jesus christ but is the attitude that brings the results are you ready the mechanics is here and so is the dynamics if you can just get started god will do the rest so this service tonight is to get you is to get you is to get you give the lord a shout because if you get started [Applause] my god i feel like jumping i feel like shouting because i believe he got him started tonight [Applause] if you only get started call you the rest [Music] you may be seated [Music] that's what david did when goliath coming down they would run to make a lad and they would put this thing in the stone there was no no david not the first time they were it's not the first time using stone you know they were slinging bird digging slinging and beading leaving a custom doing a sling he's slinging sling is his thing david a custom busting stone targeting bottle targeting whatever it is you watch a you see a mango on a tree and he just mango come off your custom hitting bullseye you have experience with beer with lion you have experience in boston land has the lion's shake so and he take him up take out beer so glad is the next contestant to be taken out you have to get the experience [Applause] so you view the trials differently you view the situations differently you shoot your your view situation in your life differently your things are overcome things are stand things to back up nothing's to break you but to make you oh give the lord a shout your experience and trials is to to make you to shape you to form you into the bullet image the mechanics is here and so is the dynamics if you can get started go will do the rest oh my my my hallelujah praise god what's the matter today my virgin is this we are letting down we are letting down to mental theology we listen down to intellectual fate when we ought to pray until god moves in the audience and does and goes to do something for us had one service brother ranam came to our meeting he never even pray or preach he said as soon as he's walking to the surface people start to come out of the wheelchair he said the angel was present the atmosphere was there sometimes i see it but i'm talking about this milky white anything can happen all things are possible pillow fire moving fate reaching up everywhere demons calling out the other demons for help because they don't want to go and a prophet with authority here to cast out devils and those demons know this man is signed and assigned to cast them out and they asking for back up praise god do you think on demon's easy right in church they're asking each other for help oh because they don't want to leave you think that devil having your life an influence in your life all these years he wanted to just give up on you just like that we have to break the power of the enemy we have to pray and the world does that the word does that the world does that the atmosphere does that break them devils offer you then you raise up the praise god people don't want to praise god as demons have them done demons have them bond but when god break that offer you up goes those hands because you were born to worship you were born you were created [Applause] the greatest pleasure i know is to pray until i realize that i'm in the presence of god and recognize it i think that ought
