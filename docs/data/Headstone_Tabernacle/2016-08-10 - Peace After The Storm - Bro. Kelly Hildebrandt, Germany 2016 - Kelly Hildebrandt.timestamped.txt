[36:19] brother Conner burner for the invitation
[36:21] to come to the convention here and and
[36:24] also for meeting our every need that we
[36:26] would have and God bless you and your
[36:29] wife and your
[36:31] family I come from a little Country
[36:33] Church uh in
[36:35] Saskatchewan up in
[36:37] Canada
[36:40] and I guess I was about 5 years old when
[36:43] my dad and my mom started going there
[36:46] and that's where I cut my teeth was on a
[36:49] message Pew so to
[36:51] speak and uh I thank the Lord for what
[36:55] he's done in my life
[36:58] I look back and many of my peers
[37:00] unfortunately they're no longer serving
[37:02] the lord but we're trusting the Lord
[37:05] would get a hold of their
[37:09] lives as a teenager growing up I
[37:12] remember
[37:14] um brother bcll coming to minister in
[37:17] our church
[37:18] there and how that he always stirred our
[37:22] hearts
[37:23] and and when he would speak it would
[37:26] just give us an unction to do something
[37:28] for the
[37:30] Lord and when I heard him yesterday when
[37:33] he was ministering uh I can see that
[37:36] it's only intensified within his life
[37:38] the passion that he has for the Gospel
[37:40] of Jesus
[37:41] Christ brother Tim pro it yesterday when
[37:44] he was ministering I I was just
[37:47] overwhelmed by the words that he had to
[37:49] speak giving an
[37:51] account and I just purposed in my heart
[37:55] that I'm going to give it 100
[37:58] 10% every day that I have left in order
[38:01] to be sure that when I stand on that day
[38:04] that the Lord would be well pleased in
[38:07] in what I've done as a pastor of a
[38:09] church and to lead the flock of the
[38:12] Living God according to his Divine will
[38:14] and to according to his Divine Purpose I
[38:17] appreciated the message of Brother John
[38:19] and brother Isaac and for the passion
[38:22] that they have and for the labor of love
[38:24] that they have if you have your Bibles
[38:26] at this time we could stand together I'd
[38:28] like to turn to Philippians chapter 4
[38:31] and I'd like to read from verse 8 to9
[38:35] and then also St John chapter 6 verse
[38:38] 16-
[38:42] 21 Philippians chapter
[38:46] 4:
[38:48] 8-9 Paul is speaking here and I I love
[38:51] the words that he speaks here he says
[38:53] finally Brethren and I believe that each
[38:56] one of us could say that that this
[38:57] morning hour whatsoever things are true
[39:01] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[39:04] things are just whatsoever things are
[39:07] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[39:09] whatsoever things are of a good report
[39:12] if there be any virtue or any strength
[39:14] and if there be any praise think on
[39:17] these
[39:18] things those things which you have both
[39:21] learned and received and heard and seen
[39:23] in me do and the God of Peace shall be
[39:26] with you amen St John 6: 16- 21 very
[39:31] familiar scriptures this morning and
[39:34] when even was now come his disciples
[39:36] went down into the
[39:38] sea and entered into a ship and went
[39:41] over the sea towards capernium and it
[39:43] was now dark and Jesus was not come to
[39:46] them and the Sea arose by reason of a
[39:49] great wind that blew so when they had
[39:51] rode about 5 and 20 or 30 furlongs they
[39:55] see Jesus walking on the scen it must
[39:58] have been a great event and drawn nigh
[40:01] unto the ship and they were afraid but
[40:04] he saith unto them it is I Be not Afraid
[40:10] then they willingly received him into
[40:12] the ship and immediately the ship was at
[40:14] the land whether they went God bless you
[40:17] you may have your seats this
[40:19] morning this morning for just a moment
[40:21] of time I'd like to just share with the
[40:23] lord has laid upon my heart and I trust
[40:27] that will be a blessing to you there's
[40:30] peace After the
[40:32] Storm there's peace After the
[40:35] Storm the disciples they were moving
[40:38] right in the middle of Duty and and
[40:41] Jesus had talked to them and they'd seen
[40:43] great Miracles and Jesus had asked the
[40:45] disciples to get into the boat and and
[40:48] go to the other
[40:50] Shore and I think it's wonderful to be
[40:53] led by the spirit of the Lord amen and
[40:56] all of our lives that's what we would
[40:58] desire in the message and thy seat shall
[41:01] possess the gates of the enemies brother
[41:03] brandham says one writer said one time
[41:05] that when they got in in that place and
[41:07] wondered what Moses would do and he had
[41:09] one command and that was go forward amen
[41:13] if you're in the line of duty no matter
[41:15] what stays in the way the greatest
[41:17] experience I've ever had is to come up
[41:20] against something I can't get over it or
[41:22] under it and just stand there and watch
[41:25] God make a way through it that's the way
[41:28] to do it just move keep moving press
[41:32] your nose against it just keep moving
[41:34] just keep going on God Will Make A Way
[41:39] amen I believe those must have been the
[41:40] sweetest words that those disciples must
[41:42] have heard at that time in the midst of
[41:45] their turmoil it is I be not afraid I
[41:49] think many times of a turmoils of life
[41:51] that each one of us possibly have come
[41:53] through and that we're going through
[41:55] right now and to hear the words of the
[41:57] Lord to say it is I Be not Afraid amen
[42:02] we're we're told in the scripture that
[42:04] he said he would never leave us nor
[42:06] forsake us but he be with us even in us
[42:09] until the end of the world Amen
[42:12] sometimes you may not feel that he's
[42:14] with you but the scripture says and
[42:16] declares that he is with you amen
[42:19] therefore if he is with you no matter
[42:20] what you're going through in life you
[42:22] can be assured of one thing that Jesus
[42:25] Christ is with you amen it's as if I can
[42:29] hear those words as they went from the
[42:31] lips of Jesus and and I'm I was thinking
[42:34] about it and I was thinking how
[42:35] instantly the winds ceased in that
[42:38] moment of time and how that they were
[42:41] instantly transported to the other Shore
[42:43] it was such a supernatural event and and
[42:46] here they were in the midst of a trial
[42:49] in the midst of a storm but in the midst
[42:51] of that trial in the midst of the storm
[42:54] Jesus Christ came on the scene amen and
[42:56] they were something something
[42:58] Supernatural transpired amen every time
[43:02] I've ever come to something in my life
[43:04] God has always come on the scene amen
[43:07] and when I've come to the end of that
[43:08] trial within my life I've always become
[43:11] more rooted and more grounded in Jesus
[43:14] Christ Our Lord amen because he has
[43:16] promised in his word to be with us Amen
[43:20] to the end of the world Amen now we can
[43:23] look at this and we can see that it's
[43:25] our big brother it was Jesus the son of
[43:27] of God and and he spoke and there was
[43:29] another atmosphere that was created and
[43:31] the winds and the waves they obeyed his
[43:34] voice it was creative power that went
[43:36] forth at that time amen he spoke the
[43:40] words and everything came to a halt amen
[43:43] if we could be so resolved in our lives
[43:45] in this hour that we realize in the
[43:48] midst of our storm that Jesus Christ is
[43:50] on the scene amen and he's given us what
[43:53] we have need of in this hour we have a
[43:55] message in this hour and that message
[43:58] was not just for brother Bram in his day
[44:00] but that message is for each and every
[44:02] one of us in this hour that we're living
[44:04] in today that message that he gave us
[44:08] was not something that we're to debate
[44:10] over and and have all of our arguments
[44:12] over but it's something that we're to
[44:14] believe within our heart amen something
[44:17] to be lived a life to be lived in this
[44:19] hour the life of Jesus Christ emanating
[44:22] from each and every one of us amen he
[44:25] came on God came on has seen this hour
[44:28] to turn our hearts back to the faith of
[44:30] the fathers amen so that we can have the
[44:33] same faith that they had back then that
[44:35] we can have it today amen I remember the
[44:39] time when brother Brandon was on the
[44:40] Colorado mountain and he was hunting up
[44:43] in that time amen and he was way up
[44:45] there and he told the people in the camp
[44:47] he said if all of a sudden a storm comes
[44:49] in and there was a storm supposed to be
[44:51] coming he said if a storm comes in at
[44:54] that time he said just make sure you get
[44:57] off the mountain real quick amen but as
[45:00] he the storm was coming in and and
[45:03] brother Bram was starting to come off
[45:05] the mountain all sudden something
[45:06] started to speak to him and told him to
[45:09] go back into that storm amen and they
[45:12] gained something that would be against
[45:13] human nature he turned around and
[45:16] started to go back into that storm amen
[45:19] the Lord spoke to him we know the story
[45:21] The Lord spoke to him and said speak to
[45:23] the storm and whatever you say to the
[45:26] storm that's what's going to transpire
[45:29] amen what would happen if the Church of
[45:31] the Living God would start speaking to
[45:33] their storms that they have within their
[45:35] lives amen there would be an atmosphere
[45:37] created in the home there'd be an
[45:39] atmosphere created in the church amen
[45:41] because Jesus Christ would come on the
[45:44] scene amen do you believe that tonight
[45:46] this morning hour
[45:50] amen God's word has a way for believers
[45:53] to let off the let off the pressure
[45:56] we're living in a time period where
[45:58] where things are moving incredibly fast
[46:01] we live in a time period when situations
[46:03] around us are changing at an incredible
[46:06] speed there are times within our lives
[46:09] when our World Turns Upside Down
[46:13] amen it's as if our world seemingly
[46:15] comes to a complete
[46:17] halt no doubt you've had these
[46:19] experiences in your life I've had these
[46:22] experiences within my life and in those
[46:25] times is when we look to the Lord to
[46:27] help us to move through those times amen
[46:30] there's three things that happened in
[46:31] our scripture reading today number one
[46:33] Jesus was walking on the water and we
[46:36] know he's an everpresent help in the
[46:37] times of trouble we also realize it was
[46:40] the calming of the storm that transpired
[46:44] and also we realize it was a
[46:45] supernatural transporting of the
[46:47] disciples to their
[46:49] destination
[46:50] amen the children of Israel when they
[46:53] were in the line of duty just give me
[46:54] just a moment here just relax myself
[46:56] self
[46:58] and when they were in the line of
[47:00] duty and God had brought them out of
[47:03] Egypt and they saw many signs and
[47:05] wonders and the Bible tells us that he
[47:07] didn't take them by one way because
[47:09] unless they would see battle and War and
[47:11] they want to go back to Egypt what he
[47:14] did at that time is he brought him into
[47:16] a place where they couldn't go to the
[47:18] left or to the right or they couldn't go
[47:20] forward or backwards and it's in those
[47:22] times that God wants to show his
[47:24] Supernatural power amen it was that time
[47:28] when they stood at the at the banks of
[47:30] the Red Sea and Pharaoh's Army had
[47:32] coming in behind them
[47:35] amen and at that time the Lord spoke to
[47:39] Moses why are you crying why don't you
[47:41] speak to the situation that's before you
[47:44] amen and we know that Moses spoke to the
[47:46] situation and we know that the the wind
[47:49] came down and it started to divide the
[47:51] Red Sea I've often thought about it how
[47:55] wide a path the Lord must made for the
[47:57] children of Israel to come through there
[48:00] was 2 million of them or more and and
[48:02] they're coming through the Red Sea now
[48:04] and they're transporting their way
[48:07] through no doubt if I would have been
[48:09] walking along there I I think sometimes
[48:11] I wonder what it would have been like
[48:13] just to stick my hand through the side
[48:15] of the water just to see this big pile
[48:19] of water that's pushed up on the side of
[48:21] me saying Lord how did you do that but
[48:24] it was in those times that they came
[48:26] through and in the heart of Caleb and
[48:27] the Heart of Joshua there's something
[48:29] that was settled within their heart
[48:32] every that they had seen they had only
[48:34] seen the power of God they seen the
[48:36] miracle working power of almighty God
[48:40] we've heard many testimonies through the
[48:41] last few days and those testimonies are
[48:44] not just something that I hear but
[48:45] there's something that I settle within
[48:48] my heart amen because God is still alive
[48:51] today amen God is still in the in the
[48:54] business of helping you today amen he's
[48:57] still in the healing business he's still
[48:58] in the saving business amen he's here in
[49:01] order to help you through life's journey
[49:04] if we can only trust in his word
[49:09] amen God loves to show us
[49:12] power he likes to show us how he can
[49:14] take somebody that's deep in sin and and
[49:17] turn their life to be a Godly Saint
[49:20] that's right it was a few years ago and
[49:22] and brother Tom Ray was was at our
[49:24] convention in in sept setember and there
[49:27] was this young woman that came to our
[49:30] convention her name was
[49:32] armanda and she came there just a girl
[49:35] off of the
[49:37] street and she was full of piercings and
[49:39] she had tattoos and she was dressed very
[49:43] immorally but she came on a Saturday
[49:45] night and God started to speak to her
[49:48] heart and service after service she
[49:51] continued to come to church and service
[49:53] after service the Lord was dealing with
[49:55] her there's never one time I spoke on
[49:58] conduct or how you should dress or
[50:01] anything of that nature and her
[50:03] testimony was that every Sunday morning
[50:06] when the word went forth something
[50:08] convicted in her heart and she would go
[50:10] to the restroom and take a piercing out
[50:12] of her
[50:13] body it was about three or four months
[50:16] after she started she was coming to
[50:19] church she would you looked at her and
[50:21] you would think that she was there all
[50:23] her life her dress changed her hair
[50:26] changed everything about her changed her
[50:30] life was in a turmoil but God came on
[50:32] the scene and completely changed her
[50:37] life we were at a young people's meeting
[50:39] and and she spoke to me and she said
[50:41] brother Kelly if if you would have only
[50:43] known my life a few weeks ago and she
[50:47] wanted to tell me about her life I said
[50:49] sister Amanda I don't want to know about
[50:51] your life she told me with tears in her
[50:54] eyes she said brother Kelly I Can't not
[50:56] believe there's a God that can forgive
[50:59] me for what I've done I said the
[51:01] beautiful thing about it is my sister is
[51:03] that you've just only grown to know the
[51:06] saving power of Jesus Christ amen while
[51:09] you were a sinner he saved you amen
[51:13] today she's married to a Christian man
[51:16] and and she serves the Lord with all of
[51:19] her heart amen why because of the power
[51:22] of Jesus Christ her life was in a
[51:25] turmoil but God God came on the scene
[51:28] and gave put something within her
[51:30] heart
[51:32] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[51:36] amen he knows how to take a young man or
[51:38] a young woman who has taken a wrong road
[51:40] and and bring them back to a place and
[51:43] and make Sons and Daughters of the
[51:45] living Gods about them of them amen amen
[51:49] I'm so grateful to the Lord that our
[51:51] names your name was written on the
[51:53] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[51:55] foundation of the world
[51:57] amen he knows who you are he knows your
[52:00] address he knows all about you amen your
[52:03] name was placed on the Lamb's Book of
[52:05] Life amen and my Bible says he's not
[52:07] going to leave one of them here amen
[52:10] he's coming for every son and every
[52:12] daughter of the Living God Amen I
[52:15] believe as the brothers ministered
[52:17] already it's our duty as the Church of
[52:19] the Living God Amen to have such a
[52:21] passion within our heart for the lost
[52:24] souls that are there and for our loved
[52:26] ones amen that God would use someone use
[52:30] you or someone to minister to the needs
[52:33] of some person amen I believe it's going
[52:37] home time amen I'm ready to take a
[52:40] Rapture amen my whole desire is for
[52:44] Rapture amen my whole desire is that God
[52:47] would come on the scene and that we be
[52:49] moved from this place that we're living
[52:51] in amen I minister at home many times
[52:55] and I I mentioned this to the people I
[52:57] said wouldn't it be something if the
[53:00] presence of the Living God would come in
[53:02] such a strong way amongst us that a
[53:05] backslider or somebody that doesn't know
[53:08] the Lord would get their heart right
[53:10] even before the service started amen but
[53:13] it seems like people have grown
[53:14] accustomed that they wait for the song
[53:17] leader or they wait for somebody to get
[53:19] him in the spirit when we should already
[53:21] be in the spirit there should be a holy
[53:23] hush upon the congregation of the living
[53:26] God Amen that God would move amongst us
[53:30] in a mighty way meeting every need of
[53:33] every
[53:34] person do you believe that t this
[53:37] morning amen there's no situation that
[53:40] catches God by
[53:42] surprise there's nothing at all that
[53:44] catches him off guard amen he's not he's
[53:47] not surprised at what we go through he
[53:49] knew it before the foundation of the
[53:51] world Amen brother brandham told us that
[53:55] he did something very specific pafic he
[53:57] took your
[53:58] picture and he put it into the file of
[54:01] predestination amen and that picture was
[54:04] put there before the foundation of the
[54:06] world Amen not at your best 18 or 19
[54:10] years old but what he saw you before the
[54:12] world began amen and we come up in a
[54:15] certain time frame and in this time
[54:18] frame that we come up in it is as it's
[54:21] God that has ordained it and God that
[54:23] has specifically placed you in this time
[54:25] frame amen so that we can live as Sons
[54:28] and Daughters of the Living God Amen
[54:32] we're coming through the dark room as it
[54:34] were where our lives are being
[54:36] developed and there's many things
[54:39] sometimes that the Lord wants to kind of
[54:41] just pull out of our Lives amen I read a
[54:44] article one time it was about a mosquito
[54:48] we have those in Canada
[54:50] unfortunately and lots of them and they
[54:53] say that a mosquito can lay an egg and
[54:56] that a can lay dormant for up to 8 to 10
[55:01] years I don't believe there have been
[55:03] any mosquitoes in the
[55:05] Millennium in 8 to 10 years you say
[55:08] brother Kelly what's relevant of that if
[55:09] there's any besetting sins in your life
[55:12] amen be sure to allow the Lord to take
[55:15] him out of your life amen because
[55:18] something can lay dormant for a long
[55:19] time and all of a sudden there's
[55:21] something that triggers it and something
[55:23] starts to push it Forward also I read
[55:26] about an article I don't remember the
[55:27] name of the bug but it was a little bug
[55:29] that can actually lay its egg and that
[55:31] egg can be laying there for up to 18 to
[55:34] 19
[55:36] years you can drown it you can crush it
[55:41] you can do whatever you want to do it
[55:43] but there's only one thing that can kill
[55:45] it and that is fire amen I believe we
[55:48] need the Holy Ghost and Fire amen that's
[55:50] moving amongst us amen I I believe in
[55:54] jumping I believe in shouting I believe
[55:56] in all that but I'll tell you what we
[55:58] need is something that goes way down on
[56:00] the inside that brings a resolve to our
[56:02] heart that we know who we are in this
[56:05] hour that we are the children of the
[56:07] Living God Amen GL
[56:11] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[56:14] Lord amen what do we have to fear
[56:17] church if God is for us who can be
[56:20] against
[56:21] us
[56:23] amen I believe that they were Witnesses
[56:26] the
[56:27] Supernatural and I believe that
[56:29] Supernatural impacts each of our lives
[56:31] in a specific way and individual
[56:33] way at that time when Jesus was here
[56:36] some people
[56:37] believed well others they just ridiculed
[56:40] it and they mentioned that he cast out
[56:42] Devils by the spirit of
[56:44] Beba when I started in the ministry
[56:47] there was a a man that I knew that I've
[56:49] known for many many years and he's an
[56:52] elderly man now in his 90s and and he he
[56:56] was in brother branham's meetings in
[56:59] Calgary and he told me and my brother he
[57:02] said you know that was just something
[57:04] that he was reading their
[57:06] minds I told him I said no he wasn't
[57:09] reading their minds it was a super
[57:12] natural God that was on the scene and we
[57:15] cautioned him not to say anything about
[57:17] it and and he spoke to me and he said he
[57:19] said Kelly he said if I would be you I
[57:21] would go to a Baptist Seminary and I
[57:24] would get some Theology and things like
[57:27] that and I I said I I thanked him for
[57:29] that I said but you know I said I really
[57:31] don't need any theology I said what I
[57:34] need is to get down on my knees and ask
[57:36] the Living God what should be ministered
[57:38] to the people amen I believe that's the
[57:41] way that we need to do it in this hour
[57:44] amen is to have God come on the scene
[57:47] amen some people they laugh at it and
[57:49] some people they think it's it's of the
[57:51] devil but we believe it's the power of
[57:53] God Amen disciples had witnessed the
[57:57] supernatural happenings within their
[57:59] life and I can only imagine how it must
[58:02] have shaped their thoughts towards Jesus
[58:04] in certain ways do you hear the words of
[58:07] Jesus in in St John chap 1: 42-49 when
[58:11] he said to Simeon he said Thou Art the
[58:13] son of Jonas and thou shalt be called
[58:17] cfas and Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to
[58:20] him and he saith to him he said behold
[58:23] an Israelite indeed in whom is no G
[58:27] Nathaniel said unto him whence knowest
[58:29] thou me and Jesus answered and said
[58:31] before Philip called thee when thou was
[58:33] under the Fig Tree I saw thee no doubt
[58:37] these disciples they testified amongst
[58:40] themselves and and they were talk about
[58:42] what the words were that Jesus had
[58:45] spoken
[58:49] amen he would say he must be the Messiah
[58:53] he must be the king of Israel
[58:58] they witnessed the ill- fame woman at
[59:00] the well are we here this
[59:03] morning they witnessed a Noble's man's
[59:06] son in Galilee and how he was made well
[59:08] and the impotent man at the pool of
[59:12] bethesa they just witnessed the 5,000
[59:15] being fed with Five Loaves and a couple
[59:18] little
[59:19] fishes amen
[59:21] amen and the disciples had witnessed all
[59:24] these say and they were talking about it
[59:26] and it brought such a peace about them
[59:29] and a resolve and a calmness about
[59:34] them their testimonies of what they have
[59:37] heard brought a
[59:39] reassurance it brought something in
[59:41] their hearts that that brought a settl
[59:44] we would say it would bring a
[59:48] peace I can just imagine what it would
[59:51] have been like to sit there in the
[59:53] middle of the SCA
[59:57] many times we have witnessed the
[1:00:02] Supernatural and people have experienced
[1:00:04] it and brings a calmness in their lives
[1:00:06] and a subtleness within their
[1:00:09] hearts what God has done in the many
[1:00:12] great things as they gave testimony to
[1:00:14] the
[1:00:15] supernatural power of
[1:00:17] God and then out of nowhere as they were
[1:00:20] in the middle of the sea the the wind
[1:00:22] started to come down on them now
[1:00:25] remember they were in the line of duty
[1:00:27] and they were sitting there and Jesus
[1:00:29] had told them to go before them and it
[1:00:32] caught them off guard and it caught them
[1:00:34] under
[1:00:35] unaware and it completely turned their
[1:00:38] world upside down
[1:00:41] amen they had rode halfway across and by
[1:00:45] God's grace i' been on that sea right in
[1:00:47] the middle of it and it would be about
[1:00:50] three or four miles and there they sat
[1:00:52] in the right the middle of turmoil they
[1:00:54] couldn't go to the right and they
[1:00:55] couldn't go to the left amen they had no
[1:00:59] desire to go back because it was the
[1:01:01] same distance as going forward they had
[1:01:04] a real pressing desire within their
[1:01:06] hearts to continue to move on but it it
[1:01:08] looked like all hope was
[1:01:12] gone the mountains around that sea maybe
[1:01:15] would go up to about 3,000 ft or
[1:01:17] something of that nature and and Jesus
[1:01:20] was up on top of the mountain and he was
[1:01:22] watching over them that
[1:01:24] day and he saw exactly what was
[1:01:27] transpiring all the time sometimes we
[1:01:30] think we're alone but His Eye Is on the
[1:01:32] Sparrow today church amen he knows what
[1:01:35] you're going through in this life Amen
[1:01:39] brother bradam in testimony raising a
[1:01:41] dead M dead boy he said oh I tell you
[1:01:43] this is the most marvelous thing that
[1:01:45] I've ever seen in my life is the
[1:01:47] greatest hour of my life is when I get
[1:01:49] up against a wall that I can't get over
[1:01:51] it or under it or around it he said
[1:01:53] that's right then I trust God and he
[1:01:55] opened the way and I go through the
[1:01:58] thing God takes you through it amen God
[1:02:02] will always take you through it amen no
[1:02:04] matter what the trial is God will pull
[1:02:06] you through your
[1:02:08] trial amen blessed be the name of the
[1:02:12] Lord sometimes we look at the height of
[1:02:14] our problems and we see the waves that
[1:02:16] are crashing down upon us but he
[1:02:18] promised that he would take us through
[1:02:20] that trial amen they looked at the
[1:02:22] height of the the heights of the Waves
[1:02:25] they looked at everything that was
[1:02:26] around about them they saw everything
[1:02:28] and it looked exactly like the time that
[1:02:31] that nothing would help them in their
[1:02:33] condition not realizing that the promise
[1:02:36] was already on the way Jesus was already
[1:02:39] coming to them at that time amen we know
[1:02:43] the scripture how that Jesus started
[1:02:45] walking out on the sea what a great
[1:02:48] thing that must have been to see it but
[1:02:51] Jesus always does something very
[1:02:52] interesting he always made it look like
[1:02:54] he was going to go past cast him amen
[1:02:58] they had to compel him to come into
[1:03:00] their ship amen they had to say
[1:03:02] something to tell them to come into
[1:03:04] their ship amen are we together this
[1:03:07] morning church amen and they s they were
[1:03:11] in this turmoil they didn't know which
[1:03:13] way to go they were up against a wall in
[1:03:16] their life and God was on the scene
[1:03:19] their testimonies were soon
[1:03:21] forgotten maybe I'm just speaking to
[1:03:23] myself this morning or I don't know but
[1:03:25] their testimonies were soon forgotten at
[1:03:27] that time and the peace of God which
[1:03:29] seemed so real to them seemed to fade
[1:03:32] away to the fear of the unknown that's
[1:03:35] the time we need to be assurance that
[1:03:37] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:03:39] ordered by God Amen we need to know that
[1:03:42] he knows my name amen we need to realize
[1:03:45] that we're engraved in the palm of his
[1:03:47] hand we need to realize in our lives
[1:03:50] that he has never saved us to lose us
[1:03:53] but he promised in his word that he's
[1:03:54] going to take us through through right
[1:03:56] to the End Amen he's the one that begun
[1:03:59] the good work in you he's the one that
[1:04:02] begun the good work in me and he's the
[1:04:04] one that's going to complete that good
[1:04:06] work in each and every one of us amen
[1:04:08] it's the power of almighty God that
[1:04:11] comes on the scene in order to help us
[1:04:13] through our situations and our
[1:04:15] trials amen His Eye Is on the Sparrow I
[1:04:20] know that he's looking after me I know
[1:04:23] he's watching over you amen amen blessed
[1:04:27] be the name of the Lord to the physical
[1:04:29] eye they couldn't see him but the Mighty
[1:04:32] God the great creator of the heavens and
[1:04:34] the Earth the sustainer of the universe
[1:04:37] the one who created the Sea of Galilee
[1:04:40] amen had his eye on them at that very
[1:04:42] moment of time blessed be the name of
[1:04:45] the Lord they didn't know it but the
[1:04:47] answer was on the way to them amen he's
[1:04:51] always on time he's never late amen
[1:04:55] sometimes as we think of Lazarus but he
[1:04:57] was right on time amen he was never one
[1:05:01] day late amen he knows when to come on
[1:05:06] time amen he's looking to see if we have
[1:05:10] confidence in his word he's looking to
[1:05:12] see whether or not we'll stand upon his
[1:05:15] word with all that's within our heart
[1:05:17] amen it don't matter who falls to the
[1:05:20] left or who falls to the right amen your
[1:05:22] resolve must be in Jesus Christ amen
[1:05:25] because he's the one that made the
[1:05:27] promise he's the one that said he'll
[1:05:29] take you through amen we've got to
[1:05:32] believe his word in this hour his word
[1:05:35] is
[1:05:37] true I was listening yesterday to a
[1:05:40] message and brother Bram said that he
[1:05:42] said he said on this message he said if
[1:05:44] we would get the right Faith within our
[1:05:46] heart he said in the next five minutes
[1:05:48] there would not be one feeble person
[1:05:50] amongst us I say oh God if there's any
[1:05:53] unbelief in our hearts in this hour
[1:05:56] take that unbelief out of our Lives if
[1:05:58] there's anything hindering the moving of
[1:06:00] God then come on the scene and move it
[1:06:03] from our lives tear it out of our hearts
[1:06:06] that we can stand as Sons and Daughters
[1:06:09] of the Living
[1:06:11] God blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[1:06:14] he wants to move through our lives amen
[1:06:17] he wants to use our lives as a testimony
[1:06:20] of his power amen that we can have a
[1:06:22] witness to some person along life's way
[1:06:25] we can give them courage in their trial
[1:06:28] brother don't give up sister don't give
[1:06:30] up amen he's with you amen he's going to
[1:06:33] take you through your trial he's
[1:06:35] watching over you in this hour but we
[1:06:38] have to have confidence in his word
[1:06:41] trust in his word it's easy when we're
[1:06:44] sitting here amongst the Saints of the
[1:06:46] Living God Amen to say that we believe
[1:06:49] his word but when we leave this
[1:06:51] convention and we go home on Monday and
[1:06:53] we go home on Tuesday brother Bram said
[1:06:56] that the Satan will come at that time
[1:06:58] and test you to see if what's in your
[1:07:00] heart is settled within your heart amen
[1:07:03] I trust it settled in your heart amen I
[1:07:06] trust you've got a passion for this
[1:07:07] gospel amen that you're going to live it
[1:07:10] with all that's within your heart amen
[1:07:12] there's too much intellectual con
[1:07:15] intellectual faith in this hour what we
[1:07:17] need to have it do is drop down on the
[1:07:20] inside of the inside amen until we can
[1:07:23] stand upon the Rock of Ages knowing that
[1:07:28] God is going to bring healing to our
[1:07:30] bodies Deliverance to our
[1:07:33] families amen he promised in his
[1:07:36] word it's up to us to believe it amen
[1:07:40] it's easy to listen to testimony say may
[1:07:43] that stirred my
[1:07:45] heart but when your turmoil starts when
[1:07:48] your situation happens where you going
[1:07:51] to stand at that
[1:07:53] moment amen God loves to test his
[1:07:57] children amen we we read about job in
[1:08:01] the
[1:08:02] scripture and we find that job in the
[1:08:04] scripture the Bible says that there was
[1:08:07] a man in the Land of Oz and his name was
[1:08:11] job and the man was
[1:08:14] perfect I looked up that word perfect in
[1:08:17] the Hebrew and that word perfect in the
[1:08:19] Hebrew means that he was an ordinary man
[1:08:23] it also goes to the Book of Solomon
[1:08:25] where he said he was
[1:08:27] undefiled why would it say he's ordinary
[1:08:29] he's just like me and you what he did is
[1:08:32] he applied the token he applied the
[1:08:34] sacrifice that was necessary for his day
[1:08:37] and for his hour little did he know at
[1:08:40] that time that there was going to be a
[1:08:42] conference between Satan and almighty
[1:08:45] God Amen and he stood in the presence of
[1:08:47] God he said have you considered my
[1:08:49] servant job and Satan said to him yeah
[1:08:52] I've considered him but you've got him
[1:08:53] hedged in it doesn't matter what he does
[1:08:56] you bless him in all all that he
[1:09:00] does Satan says to him I can get him to
[1:09:03] curse you curse you God had so much
[1:09:06] confidence in job yes that he said okay
[1:09:09] you can go but don't you take his life
[1:09:12] amen and we read the scripture and the
[1:09:14] Bible is very detailed and all the
[1:09:16] different events that transpired at that
[1:09:18] time it talks about his children it
[1:09:21] talks about his wealth it talks about
[1:09:23] everything about him
[1:09:25] and then Satan comes on the scene and
[1:09:28] completely destroys everything in one
[1:09:30] day and have you ever noticed one thing
[1:09:32] in the scripture that there was always
[1:09:34] one person that was left in order to
[1:09:37] bring the report amen Satan likes to
[1:09:40] tell you that you can't stand in this
[1:09:42] hour but I'm here to declare unto you
[1:09:44] this morning hour that you're more than
[1:09:47] able to stand in this hour and live an
[1:09:49] overcoming life because Christ is
[1:09:53] here and if Christ is here and he
[1:09:56] settled within your heart it doesn't
[1:09:58] matter what the enemy brings on the
[1:10:00] scene you can stand in this hour and
[1:10:03] stand upon the word of God Amen the
[1:10:06] young people may think brother Kelly
[1:10:08] what I've got through all these trials
[1:10:10] I've got all these pressures in life

[1:10:13] life I can tell you this morning hour
[1:10:16] that I also sat in the same position I
[1:10:19] sat on a church pew I had a lot of young
[1:10:21] people around me but I made a decision
[1:10:24] within my heart amen if they went that
[1:10:26] way I was standing on the word of God I
[1:10:29] was not going to go out to the world and
[1:10:32] do the things of the
[1:10:34] world I made a decision to serve
[1:10:38] God you have to make a decision you say
[1:10:41] brother Kelly I want the Holy Ghost he
[1:10:43] wants to give you the Holy Ghost Amen
[1:10:45] brother brandham said that if you could
[1:10:47] take all the oceans of the world and put
[1:10:49] him into a big vat and and put it onto a
[1:10:52] 2-in pipe and the pressure on the bottom
[1:10:55] of is how bad he wants to give you the
[1:10:57] Holy Ghost amen you say brother Kelly
[1:11:00] well I don't have the holy ghost in my
[1:11:02] life I was reading a quote here just the
[1:11:04] other day and brother Brandon was
[1:11:06] talking to a man and this man was saying
[1:11:09] I've been looking for the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:11] and somebody told me to come talk to you
[1:11:14] I went to this church and they told me
[1:11:15] how to do this but there was still
[1:11:17] something in my heart and I went over
[1:11:19] here and they told me I how to do that
[1:11:21] but there was still something in my
[1:11:22] heart amen and brother Brandon says what
[1:11:25] do you think was leading you all along
[1:11:27] the way here amen it was the Holy Ghost

[1:11:36] life blessed be the name of the Lord

[1:11:59] eyes were open and they knew he said in
[1:12:01] the these discouraging times comes to
[1:12:03] every believer to test you and to try
[1:12:07] you and to see if you really do believe

[1:12:22] fishes and they break it with each
[1:12:25] as he broke it and there was another
[1:12:27] piece they didn't know it at the time
[1:12:29] but Jesus was on the way to meet their
[1:12:34] need he climbed off that mountain and he
[1:12:37] came to the place where they were at
[1:12:41] and it's as the Lord does with each one
[1:12:44] of

[1:17:44] love to him amen it deepens our love to
[1:17:47] Jesus Christ amen I have a few
[1:17:51] testimonies that I wanted to share
[1:17:52] brother coner burner asked if I would
[1:17:53] share a few testimonies and I just want
[1:17:56] to share a few if I may at this moment
[1:17:58] of
[1:18:00] time our grandson
[1:18:03] Isaac he was about 3 months
[1:18:05] old his potassium was down to about 9 or
[1:18:10] up to
[1:18:12] 9.7 his sodium level was down to
[1:18:16] 149 and his creatin was at
[1:18:20] 140 he was only three or four months old
[1:18:25] Sister Laura had called me and she said
[1:18:28] dad I don't know what's wrong with Isaac
[1:18:30] he's not responding he's getting limp
[1:18:32] and he's just losing all strength I say
[1:18:34] this for the glory of
[1:18:37] God sometimes there's your life goes
[1:18:39] into a
[1:18:43] turmoil and so I prayed with her on the
[1:18:46] phone and she took Isaac into the
[1:18:49] hospital when they took him into the
[1:18:53] hospital the doctor looked at him and
[1:18:55] immediately put him into a into a uh
[1:18:59] Intensive Care
[1:19:03] Unit and they said that they didn't
[1:19:05] hardly couldn't even believe that he was
[1:19:06] still living at that
[1:19:09] moment so Jonas called me and I went
[1:19:11] into the hospital there and it was
[1:19:14] actually a do freezen that was the the
[1:19:16] caraker at that time in that room of the
[1:19:21] hospital and I remember when
[1:19:25] we just put set a little prayer never
[1:19:28] forget that
[1:19:29] moment we said a little prayer and we
[1:19:31] said Lord you gave this little one to
[1:19:34] Jonas and Laura and the enem is here to
[1:19:37] try to rob it of the life of This Little
[1:19:44] Child the doctor was going to give him
[1:19:47] some more medication to make some
[1:19:49] corrections in his potassium and
[1:19:51] especially his sodium because they were
[1:19:53] at such extreme levels they were exactly
[1:19:55] opposite to what they should
[1:19:58] be and he said he said you know let's
[1:20:00] take one more blood sample and let's see
[1:20:03] where his levels are right
[1:20:05] now they took another blood sample and
[1:20:08] they waited and the blood sample came up
[1:20:11] and the doctor read it and the first
[1:20:13] words out of his mouth were there must
[1:20:16] be a lot of people praying for this
[1:20:18] little
[1:20:21] child then he stopped cuz he realized
[1:20:23] what he had said
[1:20:24] [Applause]
[1:20:26] he said well maybe we had something to
[1:20:28] do with it as well but I'm here to tell
[1:20:31] you this morning hour that God came on
[1:20:33] the scene and touched that little
[1:20:36] person's
[1:20:38] life he was only he's born with one
[1:20:40] kidney right in the middle of his of his
[1:20:42] abdomen
[1:20:44] here and the umbilical court on the
[1:20:46] inside was actually coming across it and
[1:20:48] was cutting his kidney off and the
[1:20:50] doctor said that his kidney was actually
[1:20:52] was dying
[1:20:54] and so they did an operation on them at
[1:20:56] a four four months old and they
[1:20:59] corrected that
[1:21:00] problem and from that day forward church
[1:21:04] I'm here to testify for the glory of God
[1:21:06] he's got stronger and stronger and
[1:21:09] stronger while I was here in the meeting
[1:21:12] sister marra just sent me a text they
[1:21:13] just took Isaac to the doctor he's six
[1:21:16] years old now and the doctor looked at
[1:21:18] his blood work and looked at his kidney
[1:21:20] and everything and he said he's in such
[1:21:22] good health you don't have to come see
[1:21:24] him for three more
[1:21:25] years
[1:21:27] amen their life was in a
[1:21:30] turmoil at the time that Isaac was in

[1:21:52] and and he said to me he said said
[1:21:54] brother Kelly you look like you're
[1:21:55] really heavy on your heart and I said I

[1:23:40] came screaming to the front and gave her
[1:23:42] heart to the Lord she said for all these

[1:23:48] in all these years I've been looking at

[1:29:17] my mom I said you know Mom I said you
[1:29:18] have to forget those things which are
[1:29:20] behind and press forward to the m Mark
[1:29:22] of the High Calling of God her life was
[1:29:24] in a
[1:29:26] turmoil but she didn't know it yet but
[1:29:28] Jesus Christ was coming on the
[1:29:33] scene all of a sudden the Lord would be
[1:29:35] dealing with her with her slacks and she
[1:29:38] would just say I'm never giving up my
[1:29:39] pants couple months later she was
[1:29:41] wearing
[1:29:43] skirts
[1:29:46] amen then she told me she was never
[1:29:48] giving up makeup all of a sudden she
[1:29:51] wasn't wearing makeup anymore
[1:29:56] she told me she said I'm never going to
[1:29:58] stop cutting my
[1:30:01] hair next thing you know her hair was
[1:30:03] growing
[1:30:06] out last year at our convention brother
[1:30:08] Ron was speaking and she came up for
[1:30:12] prayer and she brought a token to
[1:30:15] me I'm wearing it here this this morning
[1:30:20] hour it's actually an earring that's
[1:30:23] converted it into a tie
[1:30:25] pin she brought it to me and she says I
[1:30:28] won't be needing this anymore Jesus
[1:30:30] Christ has just delivered me from
[1:30:35] this if you had seen my mom
[1:30:37] today you would never know that she was
[1:30:40] in the depths of sin I did my part to
[1:30:43] love her to God and to pray for her and
[1:30:46] no matter how rough the going was going
[1:30:48] God came on the scene and did something
[1:30:50] in her life and changed her life
[1:30:54] the results of that is is my brother now
[1:30:56] in Australia he gave his heart to the
[1:30:58] Lord a few years ago now my
[1:31:01] sister-in-law who's a Greek
[1:31:03] Orthodox I just talked to her not long
[1:31:06] ago with tears in her eyes she said if I
[1:31:08] would only known what the Bible said I
[1:31:10] would never have raised my children the
[1:31:12] way I raised my children we take this
[1:31:15] message for granted sometimes church but
[1:31:18] there's sometimes there's people's lives
[1:31:20] that are in complete turmoil they need
[1:31:22] Jesus Christ in their life lives
[1:31:25] sometimes it could be a loved one that's
[1:31:26] in your life that needs Christ in your
[1:31:29] life or needs Christ in their life
[1:31:31] excuse
[1:31:35] me my sister-in-law is supposed to be
[1:31:39] coming and for her to be baptized in the
[1:31:42] name of the Lord Jesus Christ is a very
[1:31:44] difficult step for her and I'm asking
[1:31:46] you to pray for
[1:31:49] her because for her to do that is to
[1:31:51] completely walk away from the Greek
[1:31:53] Orthodox and her family is very strong
[1:31:55] being Greeks
[1:31:57] themselves and that would actually make
[1:31:59] them disown her as a as a
[1:32:01] daughter but God is dealing on her life
[1:32:05] she's reading the message now she's
[1:32:07] reading the scripture the Bible every
[1:32:10] day she's got such a hunger and thirst
[1:32:13] for the things of God I've seen God do
[1:32:16] Supernatural things not just in healing
[1:32:18] but also in the healing of people's
[1:32:20] hearts and souls and when God comes on
[1:32:23] the scene and he within the inside of
[1:32:25] the heart there's something that happens
[1:32:27] at that time amen I look at when we're
[1:32:29] sick and we need healing in our bodies
[1:32:32] he's a great healer and he comes on this
[1:32:34] scene and he heals us I suffered with
[1:32:37] asthma for 17
[1:32:39] years I was about 23 years old I was in
[1:32:43] and out of the hospital every week they
[1:32:45] knew me by my first name in the
[1:32:48] hospital 17 years later Christ came and
[1:32:51] he took it from my life amen I can stand
[1:32:54] here this morning hour be able to
[1:32:56] breathe and be able to thank God for his
[1:32:59] grace that he's given me in my life amen
[1:33:02] we serve a living God church I say this
[1:33:04] only for the glory of God sometimes our
[1:33:07] lives turn upside down
[1:33:10] amen it was just a couple of years ago I
[1:33:13] hope this is all right couple of years
[1:33:16] ago our sonin-law just woke up and he
[1:33:20] fell over and died with a heart attack
[1:33:22] at 36 years old
[1:33:25] our daughter's life turned into a
[1:33:27] turmoil our life became a turmoil I'm
[1:33:30] going to tell you brother bam says they
[1:33:33] asked him one time they
[1:33:34] said did you keep Christ in your life at
[1:33:37] those time he said no he said but my
[1:33:39] religion kept me he kept me in those
[1:33:42] dark hours he kept me in those trying
[1:33:44] times that I was in amen sometimes our
[1:33:48] lives go completely out of control we
[1:33:51] don't know which way to turn what to do
[1:33:55] we don't know where to go but it's in
[1:33:57] those times that Christ comes on the
[1:33:59] scene and does Supernatural things amen
[1:34:02] and our our our whole life becomes more
[1:34:05] resolved to serve him in order to be
[1:34:08] able to take a Rapture someday Amen in

[1:37:38] morning hour though I've been at times
[1:37:39] in my life where I didn't know where to

[1:38:01] to a certain
[1:38:02] degree but I trust this morning hour as
[1:38:05] I just shared just a few little uh
[1:38:07] things that have transpired that your

[1:55:23] Saturday then the lord gave us a very
[1:55:25] good weather today which is very nice
[1:55:28] especially for the children program we
[1:55:31] have scheduled a little train for the
[1:55:35] children and families and also should
[1:55:38] some young people and adults still fit
[1:55:40] in you're welcome to join but definitely
[1:55:43] priority is given to the children and to
[1:55:46] the families that train will be
[1:55:48] departing at 300 p.m. and we would like
[1:55:50] to ask uh those families and parents
[1:55:54] that would like to send their children
[1:55:55] on the train to meet in the in the lobby
[1:55:57] in the reception area at
[1:56:00] 230 meeting point is 2:30 and the
[1:56:04] children will get a little ice cream and
[1:56:06] then they will just take a short walk to
[1:56:09] the bus station and the bus um will then
[1:56:13] be so they will be leaving here at 2:45
[1:56:16] 2:45 is the is the departure for the
[1:56:19] children and 2:30 will be the meeting
[1:56:22] point at the reception that is the train
[1:56:25] number one and the train number two is
[1:56:27] leaving 1 hour after so meeting point
[1:56:30] will be
[1:56:32] 3:45 um for the departure and if you can
[1:56:36] be there at uh 3:30 so just bear in mind
[1:56:38] 2:30 meeting point at the reception and
[1:56:41] 3:30 at the meeting point uh for the
[1:56:44] Train the little train is taking the
[1:56:46] children 20 minutes um from here to a
[1:56:49] place called plow toop in blow boin so
[1:56:53] whenever you hear Blau that means
[1:56:55] actually the English translation is blue
[1:56:57] and it comes from a from a cave that is
[1:57:00] in Blau boin it's a it's a very large U
[1:57:03] cave and it it's it basically ends with
[1:57:06] a a stream where the rivers flow Out and
[1:57:08] because it's so deep it's all blue and
[1:57:11] they can walk around and I think it's a
[1:57:13] beautiful country or beautiful site that
[1:57:16] the children can see they can spend 20
[1:57:18] minutes there and they will be brought
[1:57:20] back again so the whole tour is about
[1:57:22] roughly one hour again meeting point
[1:57:25] 2:30 and 3:30 for the for the children
[1:57:29] and for their for the for the
