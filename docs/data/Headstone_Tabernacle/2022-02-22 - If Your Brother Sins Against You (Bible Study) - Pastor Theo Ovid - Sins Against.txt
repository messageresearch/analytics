time to be able to gather on your blessed word because this is the basis of faith this is the basis that we have our strength this is our hope this is what we stand on this is the rock that we are depending on so come and bless your word tonight take me out of the way and may you be magnified and glorified amongst us in jesus name i ask it email an email god bless you things and it's so good to be here and have all of you out here tonight i want to really appreciate and thank you for coming out to the bible studies on tuesdays and if you haven't and you come out we appreciate that so much last tuesday i believe we shared something concerned in the book of jude and that book just before the book of revelation and this book of jude is i believe a very important book there are some keys there and i want to look again at one of those keys and the title i have tonight as if your brother sins against you i want to look at forgiveness forgiveness if your brother sins against you and i want to anchor that from the point in the book of jude which has contending for defeat and and of some of compassion making a difference making a difference between the arrogant the proud the broad beast and those who are slipping and sliding feeling struggling they want to get close to god they want to break through but they are really struggling make a difference put yourself in your brother's place on the matter and to that end i want to share something to you tonight now we identify that this forgiveness in this book of jude and a son of compassion is just before revelation which is the unveiling the unveiling the capstone book of the bible the book of revelation now the thing of it is forgiveness and healing goes hand in hand and there's a scripture matthew 9 if you want to find it you want to take it down was to said and behold talking about coming to jesus now they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed and jesus seeing their face said unto the sick of the palaces son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven day so jesus didn't address the sick question he addressed the same question thy sins be forgiven thee and behold certain of the scribes celebrating themselves not openly not verbally this man blasphemed and jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore tinky evil in your hearts for whether is it easier to say thy sense be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk but ye may know but that he may know that the son of man had power on earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the passing arise take up thy bed and go into thy house so this scripture clearly shows the connection between forgiveness and healing or should i say it this way forgiveness and your healing especially you who are looking to be healed or looking to be made whole there's another scripture in the book of acts acts 28 it says here was 25 and when they agreed not many themselves they departed after that paul had spoken one word well speak the holy ghost by his ass the prophet under our father singing verse 26 go on to this people and say hearing ye shall hear i shall not understand seeing he shall see and not perceive for the heart of this people is wax gross and their ears a dull of hearing and the eyes have the closed list they should see with their eyes one two here with their ears tree and understand with their heart and should be converted that i should heal them so you could see is a thread there of this heart experience with god forgiveness and healing so all of this what we are doing tonight and sharing is to help to bring our lives in order in the order of the scripture or the order of the spirit sees so because the church has to be set in order now there's a prophecy concerning when the church finds his broadly love there's a prophecy of the honey coming among the believers and the honey looks like it won't stick but it will stick but there's got to be some mechanics behind the full experience of this honey that is prophesied and maybe just maybe perhaps the lord will help us tonight to identify some of the mechanics and the mechanics is what you can do there are certain things that are above your prerogative you can't uh uh uh uh you know i see when charities to come you could prepare your heart god is the one that's in rain you could prepare the seed you could plant the seed but the rain and the sun god is in charge of that so what we are responsible for we want to take up that responsibility and be dear ready having all the mechanics ready amen so jesus gave a parable about the lost coin and you know obviously the woman searched diligently to find that coin and that coin represented for us for our purpose brotherly love we have to have that honey that brother love and i'm not saying that as a text i'm not saying that as a phrase i'm seeing that as a manifestation the honey have to stick there has to be a genuine manifestation of the spirit of forgiveness okay now remember but abraham had his wife was upset with him and kind of answered him in a kind of way where the spirit was not pleased and after that she got this tumor you see and afterwards now um the holy spirit come back now for him to speak and said speak for your wife and he says before the doctor's untouched my doctor statue is my wife the tumor will go down so there was an attitude and a behavior there was a reaction to that because things happen in the realm of the spirit and we our actions and attitude it have consequences seen and unseen known and unknown so there has to be a genuine forgiveness to come among god's people and this revolution of brotherly kindness really shows that we are nothing we are nobody we need god's forgiveness and because we ourselves need god's forgiveness we supposed to be able to share and and give that out to others okay so the revelation and we're going to get into the scriptures just how the main text of what we're going to read and we but i am seeing something really uh powerful in that the devil works first on the inside inside meaning inside the church inside people's heart lies you know and when you have the church and you have people coming to church all here in the world then once they are unconverted hearts once they are unforgiving lies and people with autism grudge the devil have a channel that he could use to gossip to spread rumors to talk and break scriptures because there's an approach that the bible identify how to deal with issues how to deal with if a brother sins against you if someone offends you and if you bring offense how to deal with it sometimes we do things intentionally sometimes we do things unintentionally and the bible talk about and we read at some point in time david asks god for help and pray from for secret faults false that he may not be aware of he asks god to keep him from presumptuous sins thy sins that are deliberate so there are areas in our hearts and our lives that we have to deal with in order to be effective in the body of christ so when the people was making love in the church and brother branham told them stop it please stop it don't do that behave yourself have respect everything else and then the holy spirit drop down and say whatever you see will happen if you stay blind you will be blind if you said death they will die whatever you see it was given into his mouth to see whatever he wants to say to them and he didn't take none of the options that was spoken to him he said i forgive you and god was pleased god was pleased because here is a son you know they have a statement if you want to see what in somebody give them power a lot of people have a loss for power love i love to be in charge i love i lost to being over love i love to rule and um they can't wait to take your place envy jealousy like a residence in their spirit to wish they could take where you what you have and be in your position and so on like that but when you give somebody power then you see what's really in their heart and that is why it is spoken that power without character is satanic and power with character is fit to rule so therefore god's objective over the years has been to try to get character into his people and the character is not a gift so here is sort of cast 22 between a rock and a half please you want character but it's not a gift you can't slip it to you know envelope he can't slip it to you at the side it's the formation of the word image is character formation or character development and the only way note what i'm saying the only way it could come is by the trial of your feet dustin's trials tribulations sufferings pain challenges upsets you name it this is what produces character not blessings not money not houseland car bigger bank account that doesn't produce character is when the tests come and only listen only when the tests come you could see where you stand only when the test count will vindicate or prove or show what you are convinced of that is where your character comes in not your reputation repetition is who people think you are the your correct is is who you are who are you that's your character it speaks your character speaks when nobody else is wrong your character speaks when the church people are wrong with no god bless you the character speaks when he's all alone what you think what you do what you see how you act that speaks of your character and that character is is with your values and and what you have resident within retaining okay now here it is if we could get or the church could come to us please where there's no oats and no grudges and so on then there is no place for the devil to operate within the church there is no room there is harmony there is praying one for another in the truest sense of train one for another because you could hardly pray for somebody and hold something against them so if you have an issue with somebody start by praying for them no if you're not praying for them and you're talking ill of them that's one thing but but i want you to make a switch tonight instead of talking ill about your brother or sister or your pastor or elder or deacon or whoever and you begin to pray and you enter into a compassion you could hardly continue to hold anything against them because i believe that when the devil realized that he cannot move amongst the elect because the prophecy is there'll be no love left except among the elect when the devil recognizes that he cannot move among the elect then he will have no other option to bring external force actually crush and press the bride being left by force so he using a triple power satanic power political power and religious power physical force just as the church and the early believers they perish on the end of rome and the physical force because you see once the devil works on the inside there's no need really to pressure any physical force the force is already dear he has taken over the church jesus finds himself outside the church and that is why he said behold i stand at the door and knock what door is he knocking at where are we pleased and if we are pleased in the position to have brotherly kindness and then on top of that as the holy spirit's thought then it means there's absolutely no way we could really enter into how to say rapturing feat or rapturing condition outside of passion through that door of broadly love which is the spirit of forgiveness okay so i believe that we we this prophecy is is going to be real it's going to be manifested in and through our hearts and lives so tonight if your bible says i get to enter two portions of scripture we're going to start with or we're going to take it one by one mark 11 from this scripture verse 22 to 26 we want to read our scripture phrase mark 11 open bibles read the barriers i'm so happy that we can have studies they could scroll your scriptures and read it and may every seed because it's spirit given words inspired by god and every seed strike your soul okay jesus speaker this is jesus after the curse of victory he wanted figs and there was none he kissed the next day they saw the tree dried up from the roots and jesus there was a means master the tree is dried up from the roots and i want you to understand when a cancer is cursed a tumor is cursed sickness is cursed in your body it is dried up from the very roots itself the cancer the tumor is a demon inside the deer extending itself in sickness when the spirit leaves then everything as it dries out let's go mark 11 22 jesus sentenced to them have faith in god for verily i sent to you that whosoever shall see unto this mountain video removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have what shall they see so i call this the purple jesus give what sun supposed to manifest peace be still he spoke to the storm so this is the third level then those 24 he drops to the second level so you can't go directly to three you have to come to two and you go to one so let's go to two now therefore i say unto you whatever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them so he is challenging them to believe in advance that they got it and they will get it okay let's go to number one verse 25 but when you stand praying so first you speak if you shall see then you pray but it's not just praying so he's bringing down the fine print of prayer when you stand praying you're not just saying prayers when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any in other words it's almost as if before you approach god you search your heart to see if you have an issue against anyone and if you find and it pops up yes against sister so and so brother so-and-so my uncle my hand my neighbor whatever whatever drop it he said then if you have ought against any let me see i said you say when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any and the reason for it is that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses jesus drilling down further in verse 26 but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses so is it that if you do not forgive you're wasting prayer you're wasting time you're wasting your time every single god time you're just killing time because your prayer is not going anywhere you're not right you're praying like good anyway and that's true because it has to start with god's condition now remember if you serve in the god of your imagination of the god of your own touch then you could say words and say prayers and taking it up unto god these are people who idols just eat this and that and all kind of stuff they just see words and say into whatever god they believe that is there but this god of the bible or god of the word we have to approach it based upon his thinking his thought on the matter let's switch now to matthew chapter 18 and this is where i get the whole thought from matthew chapter 18 we're going to read from verse 15 of matthew chapter 18. moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee this is someone do offend you sin against you go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone let's pause there a minute you didn't say go and tell your mother your father go and tell some of that brother your country don't tell you you're good partner no somebody do you something the first order of scripture is to go to that person alone so let me bring it down so if brother a offend by the beat or treat must be badly but be not supposed to hold a meeting with his comrades or whatever and discuss how this brother move like this because what that does it brings a bad spirit among the people that you're talking that too now you know who might be telling you things and based upon the scripture you know that who talking that way the off the genuinely off of the scriptures because the guidelines are clear if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone what people do they go and tell others they vex and i get dicks and this is what you do and and and then you don't know the condition of that person's heart that you are telling that to that person may buy or fight and when they buy that fight now is two against one and then that person will tell somebody else then a tree against one then when they come everybody's seen that person koki eye or badai everybody watching that person with an attitude i have seen that i have experienced that and that has to stop so let's look again at the scripture if thy brother shall trespass against thee the fullest thing to do tell him his fault between he and him alone if he hear thee though has gained thy brother end of story if you listen say i'm sorry i i i didn't mean to do that forgive me that's ended right here you don't need no more but if he will not hear thee this is the bible now telling you the approach if he will not hear he's arrogant he has an attitude okay then this is where he somebody has come take with the one or two more that in the mount of two or three witnesses every word may be established so then you get somebody else and you go to that brother and say brother i brought this brother x or what not with me and i want to let you know that this is what happened so on like that all right verse 17 and if you shall neglect to hear them which is two or three tell it unto the church and if you neglect to hear the church let him be as unheathen or public and jesus put scriptural authority in these words to the church he said very nice unto you whatsoever you shall be in it shall be born in heaven whatsoever you shall loosen it shall be loosed in heaven again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on it as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done of them of my father which is in them for where the two or three that gathered together in my name they am in the midst of that okay so jesus lose this and then verse 21 brother peter came to him so jesus is teaching unforgiveness he is teaching and put an order that people wouldn't have bad spirit and bad attitude one was another with issues and faults and things that will happen as we all know it what it does so peter in verse 21 then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive it just seven times that was a big number in peace i mean that's explosive i mean people no don't forgive and peter says seven times look at jesus response in verse 23 22 jesus answers him i say not unto thee until seven times but till until 70 times seven so jesus answered the question of forgiveness how much times peter taught a number and jesus multiplied that number but 70 times that number 70 times seven so in other words there's no excuse to have an unforgiving spirit there's no excuse which i keep holding on like i see people seem to be renewing the yearly grudge like they renewing the driver's permit or the passport or something so they were new in the grudge they were doing the oath they continue with their foolishness and i think i've done if i mentioned before when i was in school days there was they accused me of being with somebody girlfriend or something like that really young boys in secondary school and the guy who did that to me i i know him i know his name never forget his name everything else see but that's not true and we stop talking later on in life i met him as an adult and so like that and when i saw him the first thought struck me was you know what he did me in school and whatnot and then i that off and say man that is foolishness and i went and meet him and talk to him i said it's cool boys japanese and whatnot and you know we are done snow and you move on now if i i'm gonna be petty and i'm gonna go back and say you know he do me this and he'll lie and do something you go nowhere with that and especially coming to christ as a christian you want to know that you are practicing you are emulating you are making the effort to be like christ now right after this when jesus saves him jesus break a parable on them and this parable as we say parables are like mysteries jesus was one of the greatest storytellers out so he will tell a story without telling you about you and when you hear the parable you could see yourself in that part so jesus break this power but therefore the is the kingdom of heaven like not the second king which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents but for as much as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me i will pay thee all then the lord of that silver was moved with compassion and loosed him one and forgive him the dead but the same servant went out so this man who owned ten thousand talents got forgiven he was and he was released from his death but this same man went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him a hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the truth saying pay me that dark voice and his fellow servant fell along at his feet and be sought and saved have patience with me i will pay thee all and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt you see all human hearts desperately wicked this man god forgive him release from ten thousand his local next man through it for a hundred pence or whatever verse 31 so when this his fellow even saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told their lord all that was done then his lord after he had called him senator him oh duh wicked servant i forgive thee all that debt because thou desirest me she does not know also have compassion on thy fellow servant even as i have pity on thee and his lord was wrought and delivered him to the tormentors till he peed all that virtue unto him so likewise jesus capping it over so likewise shall your heavenly father do also unto you if and listen and you know but i always talk about driving slow wrong scriptures not just russian the truth listen to these words so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if you from your heart these words are not just placed there by chance he's not talking about your mouth running if ye from your hearts forgive not your everyone forgive not everyone his brother dear trespasses forgive from where the heart so that is where true forgiveness is out when somebody say i forgive i can't forget you know that this problem is there because if god wants to treat us like that god shall forgive all of you i forget you know i forget i know no i know you do this no no that's why the bible describe it he has this sea of forgetfulness and when you see god take things and put it in the sea of forgetfulness the devil fish and lion and fish on the road can't pull up because he put it in a sea god himself doesn't remember we don't have that kind of mind or that kind of a level of intelligence and so on to have that consciousness of forgetfulness from yes you remember somebody done but your heart you understand what god has done for you and as god release you you could release your brother and his sister and so on like amen so you get out tonight i will pick it up tonight let's look at galatians chapter six these are these scriptures now and i pray that god and grave these things into your heart you want to be a scriptural church you want to be a world church want a church that loves the word love god and reject traditions the traditions of the elders and how this one do it and we don't want to care about what this church is doing on that other that you are doing we want the scriptures that we're reading make manifest in and through our hearts in our lives galatians chapter 6 i want to read from verse one this one is a big one and i want to read this also in the amplified so let's read it galatians chapter six define it reading from this one brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault those are precious words somebody could be overtaken ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself least thou also be tempted number one if somebody is overtaken enough the gospel what they do they will call on the phone or text or talk or whatsapp or whatever to tell others about this person overthinking and they're getting excited for the day they they revive this you have to understand that the gospels feed on negative you ever hear any gospel gossiping positives no that is not what they are about that doesn't stimulate the spirit when you hear some canal some kind of confusion they get that like a revolution because they know get something you hear um you hear that you you're here you know what i hear and what you hear but this is what the scriptures tell us to do somebody could be overthinking you didn't expect them to be overthinking you didn't expect them to be in a ditch or to be in sin not to be enough fault but let's say they can overtake what are they supposed to do how are we supposed to treat them beat them up go beyond your pulpit and expose them let the whole church know look at this person in our fault listen to what the scripture says ye which are spiritual restore such a one and hear how this is drilling down it says driving slow not just restoring you know why are you swimming i'll bring it back i went and bring him back no this is not all these people here in spiderman all these superman and all these characters that will keep this is not restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself least thou also be tempted in the amplified it says brethren if any person is overtaken in misconduct or sin of any sort you who are spiritual who are responsible to uncontrolled by the spirit should set him right and restore and reinstate him without any sense of superiority love that and with all gentleness keeping an attentive eye on yourself at least you should be tempted also so you kind of say boy he sinned he fall if i was he i was going to do that and i know and no no you can't talk that way so this is the amplified here let me read it again if any person is overtaken in a misconduct or sin of any soul you who are spiritual who are responsive to and controlled by the spirit should set him right and restore and reinstate him without any sense of superiority and all with all gentleness keeping an attentive eye on yourself at least you should be tempted also that is just this one now this is where po boy this is self-righteous get challenged because the people who are self-righteous they are righteous in their own eyes in their own self not god's righteousness their own righteousness and they use that as a gauge to judge others they'll use that as a gauge to look down on others and to criticize others and to be little to pull others down that is how they try to gain influence they try to get influence by breaking people's confidence in people and gifts and talents that god have placed first two of that same script of galatians six verse two bae one of the burdens and so forth you see that there being a one another's burdens that there's a whole text by itself that could be a whole continue for if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing he deceive it himself but let every man prove his own work then shall you have rejoiced in himself alone and not with another for every man shall be his own burdens let him that is taught in the word communicate with him that teach it in all the things be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever man swear dutch i reap for he that swear to his flesh shall the flesh reap corruption he that swears to the spirit shall the spirit reap life everlasting let us not be wary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we fear not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are the household of feet the amplified beer endure carry one another's burdens and trouble some moral faults and in this way fulfill and observe perfectly the law of christ the messiah and complete what is lacking in your obedience to it for if a person thinks himself to be somebody too important to condescend to shoulder another load you see the context here so when you're talking about um if or how is it up here here if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing he deceive deceived himself and the amplified and bring it in the context of you feeling so high you feeling so mighty you feeling so self-righteous that you cannot humble yourself to reach down and pick somebody up it says here now watch if any person thinks himself to be somebody too important to condescend to shoulder another's load when he's nobody of superiority except in his own estimation he deceives and deludes and cheats himself but let every man carefully scrutinize and examine and test his own conduct and his own work he can then have the personal satisfaction and joy of doing something commendable in him itself alone without resorting to boastful comparison with his neighbor and jesus gave a story about that publican who didn't even go into temple and the priest in terms of saying lord i'm not like that man only i pay my tights i do this i threw that and that and that republican hung his head and said lord have mercy upon me a sinner and jesus said that republican that sinner man that man went away more righteous than the priest was saying i do this i do that i do the other only acknowledge lord i have mercy upon me a sinner my god every one of you every person have to be a be equal to understanding and calmly receive his own load of oppressive thoughts so when i hear a young man want to blame his parents young woman will blame my parents blaming this one and blaming that one for your condition you're sick something really really wrong with you if you have to blame this one on that one you don't want to take responsibility for yourself you want to be a permanent child a permanent student a permanent then you have the pacifier to put in your motor quiet you don't you want to bowl and rant and carry on because you don't want to accept responsibility for yourself growing up you have to accept responsibility independence is a responsibility and i think we preach another already we talk about it already israel just some of them it's easier to be a slave than to be on your own because with the slave you get the food from the master you get food from the master you get food clothing shelter and so on when they in the land have to build houses that turn the ground you have to work you have to earn your steel little by little take the land some people don't want they don't want to work they want to labor be not deceived or is not mocked let us not lose heart and weary and faint and acting nobly and doing right for in due time and at the appointed season we shall reap if we do not loosen and relax our courage and faint so then on occasion so then as occasion and opportunity opens up to us let us do good morally to all people not just the budget you know what people are like in the family to all people not only being useful and profitable to them but also doing what is also for their spiritual good and advantage be mindful to be a blessing especially to those of the household of faith those who belong to god's family with you the believers are you a blessing to believe in or you are no comment i don't understand why are you a blessing james five return to james 5. james 5 being verse 16 the major scripture confess your faults one to another fault one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed so confession and prayer is also tied to healing the effectual proven prayer of a righteous man are they not much and a righteous man is righteous because of the blood not because he is righteous in himself but that man hasn't a blood atonement that speaks in his being elias was a man subjected like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and his reign not on earth by the speech of three years and six months he prayed again and heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth a fruit brethren if any of you do from the truth and one convert him let him know that he which converted the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sense amplified confess to one another there for your faults your slips your false steps your offenses your sins and pray to one another that you may be healed and restored to a spiritual tone of mind and heart the earnest heartfelt continued prayer of a righteous mind makes tremendous power viewable dynamic in his working and verse 19 amplifies my brethren if anyone among you streams from the truth and falls into error and another person brings them back to god let the latter one be sure that whosoever turns a sinner from evil course will receive that one soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins procure the pardon of the many sins committed by the conflict okay matthew 5 you want to look at verse 22 24 45 open it one should be too fast if i say unto you this is jesus now he's talking to his disciples he's trying to get them a little higher he's trying to get them to see a little further they are on day with the master they with jesus so oh my they're having a great time he multiplied bread and fish you're hearing the sick everybody see these guys identifying with the messiah jesus talking to them now i say unto you who is that the believers the disciples his converts is his people under him i said to you that accept your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribe and pharisees he shall know you shall have no case entering the kingdom of heaven then he drilling down now you have heard he was said that by them in all time though shall not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be deemed of judgment but i say unto you this is not about over teaching this this is not brother ovid speaking this is jesus saying this but i said to you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of judgment now jesus is wean this anger with the old testament that says thou shalt not kill no you could kill somebody by your words by breaking their influence so let's say um somebody gossip into somebody else in the church and that person lose confidence in the ministry consistent with me and whatnot what i speak then the puppet have no effect at this because they see me they're seeing me with crosstalk they see me negative so regardless of how sincere regardless of what was i share it is not hitting the heart because there's a mind blocked here because of things that people have heard no did we not talking yes we are not talking here this is real i had this my own experience being against a minister because of what i heard about that man and i was a young believer and i didn't even know the man but the preacher presented certain things behind the property certainly about that man he was wrong to do that because my heart which was like a innocent child heart uh newbie a newborn a new convert i received it and it had a negative impact upon my life when i met that brother i recognized that i couldn't you know it was was not right eventually that brother became my pastor and i actually repented to him and said forgive me i have these thoughts about it and sometimes i wonder people who never say forgive me i can't understand that though i can't see you as a christian and you go to this christian journey without saying forgive me or i forgive you that's okay let it go i'm not against you you it has to be part of your experience because one wife bites your husband father to son mother daughter you know it has to have that kind of experience but i'm sorry so jesus says i see unto you whosoever's anger is his brother with all the cause shall be in danger of judgment and usually say to his brother shall be in danger of the church but whosoever shall say the fool shall be in danger of help therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar so no he is drilling don't know you want to bring an offering to the lord you want to bring your children you want to bring your family you want them to be healed you want them to be safe you want to be delivered you're bringing stuff to god you're bringing your prayer to god no now we've seen all of this because we want your prayer to be answered we are seeing all the over this because we want the church to be set in order we say all of this because we want your heart to be right jesus saying this if thou bring thy gift to the altar and dare rememberist that thy brother had an ought against your brother now leave therefore thy gift before the altar go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer that gift now if you ignore this if you ignore this scripture do like this does not exist and you bring in your gift you've been in your offering you bring in your prayer will god answer that how that's supposed to so friends we have to come to the spot where we want to obey the scriptures where the bible is back to the bible back to the word so then in the amplified this one is an important one how it is placed here jesus in verse 22 but i say unto you that everyone who here we go continues to be angry with his brother or harbors malice enmity of heart against him shall be liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the call now you know sometimes we read something about family feuds family feuds and this one tell this one and this generation tells this one a little grandchild come and say grandma why why we don't talk to that other one again she's she serious with that it's so long a carrying member and that's such a shame because things are passed on and people don't even know why now i have got myself in some hot waters with ministers with pastors and so on because um i don't buy people's fight i say very plain if you have an issue with somebody and you are my friend don't expect me to have an issue with that person if you no longer want to be my friend that's okay god bless you you could keep on walking but i am not going to buy your fight so you have a fight with this one and i fight with that one and we're supposed to be friends and i supposed to fight fight with them fight you with them no no no you straighten out your fight you clear up your stories so this is where it is you cannot buy people fight if i was you are you this one thunder and i give this one dish and i do this and like this and you're putting seeds in people's minds and hearts and spirits messing up families messing up i know sister who marriage never worked never started and every time she have to tell somebody about marriage leave your husband leave your wife leave leave leave leave it's almost as if because her own work she doesn't want anybody else it is so unfortunate when the bible teachers let the older women teach the younger women how to love their husbands how to manage their homes well isn't that something so let's leave a gift for the altar so let's go to matthew chapter six and um be coming down see what time it is okay we're doing that matthew chapter six when i read from verse one jesus speaking and you know this what we call islam unto the mount is christianity in action it's not lectures it's not just talk is is bringing to life our behavior or attitude because this new way this new way is supposed to be reflected in us this is how we bring witness that christ was raised from the dead this is how we bring witness that this is a new way it's not the same we so jesus said take heed that you do not your arms before men to be seen up there otherwise you have no reward of your father which isn't it therefore when thou doest dying arms do not summon trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men relation to you they have their reward but one when don't do his ass let not thy left hand know what i right hand to it that thy arms may be in secret and thy father would see it in secret himself shall reward thee openly when oppressed those shall not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues in the corner of the street that they may be seen of men their likes unto you they have their reward but down window prayers enter into thy closet and when do i shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which season secret shall reward thee openly and when you pray use not vain repetitions as the hidden do for they think that them shall be heard by their much speaking be not therefore like unto them for your father knowing what things you have need of before you ask it jesus is drilling down after this manner therefore pray and he begins he's teaching them how to pray our father which asked in him hallowed be thy need yeah didn't they find where their father is you showing your respects thy kingdom come thy will be done and answers in heaven there is no request there yet that is identifying his kingdom and identifying his will to be done then it says give us this day our daily prayer this is jesus prayer teaching them and forgive us our debts condition as we forgive our debtors he didn't say and forgive us our debts period the bible have it and forgive us our debt is a comma dear as we forgive our debtors you have to get the whole line and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for dying is the kingdom and the power and the glory for every email then he put in this clause he's got to call this way for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not mend the trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespass but we need god forgiveness why because faith for your healing is based on forgiveness for your breakthrough is based upon forgiveness faith all things of god is of faith we need faith that's why gauchos are missing in the last days to turn our hearts back to the fate of the fathers we need fear to leave here putin is making his move in ukraine he's anointed he's inspired he has the power he has the capacity to do whatever he wants to do at this point in time the world is just looking on the bride has to be anointed inspired prophet said when the church the bride get to know who she is and she can do the greater works if we have to get to the greater works we have to do the lesser works first lesser works let's call that brotherly kindness for now if you're going to forgive your brother so jesus in the abbey fight said take care not to do your good deeds publicly or before men in order to be seen by them otherwise you'll have no reward so this here brings us to applied christianity where you don't want to parade your beef it's called beef your flesh yourself you know you want credit you want people to upload you you want you want this you want that and if you don't get that if you're a whole and you feel like pressure and then people are grateful no he's seeing here you don't when you do your good deeds publicly or before men in order to be seen by them otherwise you have no reward reserved for waiting for you when you give to the poor do not blow a trumpet before you as hypocrites in the synagogues and streets like to do for they may be recognized and honored and praised by men so when people do this and recognize them praised by men that boosts their reputation but it doesn't identify the character jesus by saying don't look for men's recognition don't look for that reputation part get the character path that you could help support do bless encourage live up without anybody knowing you are doing it from your heart you're not doing this as an investment i'm doing this and i'm doing for them and i'm looking to see what they could do back for me this is not that this is not that i scratching your back because i'll expect you to scratch back mines no this is not i scratch your back you scratch it no this is not that either you scratch the back because you need scratches he says now when you do charity or gift to charity do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your deeds of charity may be in secret and your father who sees in secret shall reward you openly and never stop the idea when jesus prayed forgive us our debts as we forgive forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven left remitted and let go of the debts and have given up resentment against our debtors that is the amplified forgive us of our debts as we also have forgiven left remitted let go of the debts and have given up resentment against our debtors and leaders not in temptation there's some old evil and something like that but faith is based upon forgiveness we read the scripture in mark 11 we read the scripture do you say have faith in god for if you shall say to this mountain then he said when you pray this when you pray believe that you you receive what what desire when you pray believe you have received it you shall have them but when you stand praying forgive when you stand praying before your utter words and waste your prayer forgive you have to act now you have to begin to act upon what you're hearing you see you cannot say no you don't know because we brought it to you tonight this is the scriptures all right psalms this is david and this one here is is is a special one this is psalms 19 here david the heavens declare the glory of god the filament showed his handiwork day on today utterance speech night unto night shred knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their line is going up through all the earth and their words to the end of the world in them that he said a tabernacle for the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoices as a strong man running a race he goes fort is from the end of the heaven and is freaking to the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof david now the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the lord is sure making wise and simple the statutes of the lord are right rejoice in the heart the commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes the fear of the lord is clean and joined forever the judgments of the lord are true and righteous all together more to be desired are they than gold here than much fangirl sweeter also than honey and honey moreover by them is thy seven warned and in keeping of them there is great reward who can understand his errors cleansed though me from secret faults this is david asking god to cleanse him from secret forms and then he said that line keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright i shall be innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh lord my strength and my redeemer oh could you give the lord some praises tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord jesus praise god praise god blessed be the name of the lord thank you lord hallelujah thank you lord jesus i want to get something here i want to take a look at this example who can discern his lapses and errors clear me from hidden and unconscious thoughts is he amplified who can discern his lapses and errors clear me from hidden and unconscious faults keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then i shall be blameless and i shall say innocent and clear of great transgression as the amplifier my presumptuous what is presumptuous overstepping due bonds overconfident arrogant presumptuous so they are too tight to sin that david identify here hidden unintentional accidental secret unseen unknown but presumptuous is deliberate intentional and that's one of my david when david comes adultery bathsheba that was intentional presumptuous is a serious thing and david asking god to help him declare him from the one he is unconscious of and that's why every day we need to repent every day we need to ask god for forgiveness every day we supposed to ask for christmas see and let the blood cover us and something like that because this is what you know it will affect our lives and even we did it sometime again about the study the whole husband preaches wife and the bible speak about that your prayer may not be hindered so could you imagine your attitude towards your wife or towards your husband actually affecting your prayer your prayer to god so no wonder sometimes things not as it's supposed to be we are not effective are we supposed to be because there are too much you know issues at the home level and then it comes into the church and that is why the revival have to start in your home there are people that come and they come and they bring their weight and their burden and their negative their negative spirit negative rights nothing positive about them at all without even speaking to them their vibes are negative and if you are negative you have to come out of that because with that negative you can't really get your prayer answered you can't get your healing and that kind of a way the guy who had the policy i believe it was the friends who taught him on that crutch on that stretcher and they walk all those miles because those days they're not taxi and whatnot and they when they came they the crowd was all around the house they couldn't get into the entrance to the back don't know where they decided to climb up and pull him and break up the roof and let him down in front of jesus jesus said i sent me forgively and so therefore the man caught forgiveness first the man got released from his guilt what forgiveness really is release from your guilt release from your past that's what what what is all about and that's why the bible teaches us how and of some of compassion note the arrogant the peace the attitudes that you don't care and nobody can't tell you nothing and you you're standing everything else you're in rebellion mood and rebellion is at least in a witchcraft you in that rebellion move you better against god and you could talk conviction talk you could talk um you know you're seeing it and that's what we open up you could talk that whole whatever longer talk it doesn't change that rebellious spirit because not just what you say is it's how you say see so we don't want that presumptuous just going forward and together so how about the clothes believe it or not i want to close with a quote for a message by faith moses this message was the 20th of june july 1958 the branham we want a meeting with this tabernacle so that everything and every mistake all things that have been carrying on and maybe little feelings from one to another those i'm going to get every one of them and bring them right face to face if you don't want to face it you better leave the country because you are coming face to face with every bit of it like we used to do here at the tamina and all to be smoothed out because we are brothers and sisters who are broke communion the body of christ across the table of blessings and is nothing but the devil would make anything that would be wrong and would cause feelings or tear up or anything like that and i am taken i am taking our brother neville and we are going from place to place and bring people the people together till the old tabernacle is back established again on its feet to go along for the kingdom of god now this is the reason i have said this is because it's with our own little group here this morning so we said these things because we intend to do something about your feelings and issues people and family and and people have and to be honest a lot of stuff can't be resolved i know sometimes we need to air ourselves i need to speak what in our hearts and so on but the reality is at the end of the day each one of us have to come to the place to drop things drop your oats simply drop it let it go forgive your brother forgive your sister and press on in jesus name that's the only way if you go with a list it has sub list it has part one i have par 10 in that part one and under the part one to ten have more paths and the paths are gonna finish the talk is not gonna finish the bat is not going to finish until we could understand that if we catch a real revelation that we are nothing that's what isaiah saw i believe when he entered the presence of god in isaiah 6 he will go with me i'm undone i have a man on clean lips i draw among people around clean ups he's finished here he's on the floor he saw the tree hand lifted up the lord fill the temple the glory dear who is me all the time when was you was you with you when the glory hit him he balled with me because truly the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom do you fear god do we have the fear of god our hearts and our lives we hear prophecy that perfection will be so much in the church that a nasty sapphire will come back again with the lying self and they'll be judged take no death that's a real church that's the church jesus is going for a genuine another book of accessibility heavenly father i thank you for tonight and in going through jude last week and just before revelation just before the capstone comes down just before the unveiling you stick in that book called jude where the fate was already slipping and he said argue for it debate lord some people as they haven't begun to fight and they want to give up luther fought wesley fought through the dark ages they fought someone else in sheepskin and cold skin in caves and dense destitute afflicted sons of god some to the water some through the flood some good trials and altered the blood but ram lost his wife lost his daughter mostly anointed so much challenges but it didn't change him from being a prophet and being that elijah according to malachi 4 and here we are lord we are facing the challenges as we gather together around your word i thank you for your people here tonight bless them in a special way may they reflect on these scriptures may they reflect on what was shared and search their hearts to see if there's any odds if they have something against someone they'll want to be reconciled to their brother reconciled to their sister this thing about i'm not talking to this one i have no words with this one i cannot say anything to this one and so on that has to stop it has to cease it has to be a platform that the love of god can be spending and broadly kindness is a channel a channel that divine love can come down and work through god jesus you said this by this shall all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for another father bless the service tomorrow night the tape shall be played bless the upcoming friday meeting and the sun is ahead of us granted father in jesus might ask it amen and amen saints of god i thank you to be here tonight may god bless you i appear and trust that this was defined to you and helpful for you don't take it as another lecture or another talk take it as something real because you want your prayer to be answered i am seeing it that if this is fine any sick person come among us they have to have to be healed confession force one to another pray one for another if anybody is sick everybody committing any sin they're gonna be healed they're gonna be delivered we have to see that healing of the school are we gonna see that healing of the body i think another soul and spirit has to do with forgiveness have to do with no oughts no grudges a complete transformation of your very life so god bless you thanks again for being here and god bless you love you
