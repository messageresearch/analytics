gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight that we could gather one more time in this way in this season and lord how we are so thankful lord that we could be here tonight that we could be a part of this service a part of this fellowship a part of this opportunity lord to come together our lord on this tuesday evening and fellowship around your word lord your prophet reference that whenever we talk about you you draw near lord may you draw near tonight lord and speak to our hearts our lives our situations lord some of us would have had great days today some would have had okay days some may have had bad rough days but lord we are coming tonight lord on lord this this medium this meeting this this this blank slate so to speak tonight where we could forget everything else we could push aside the tears of life we could push aside for a moment what we have to deal with the next day and lord and we are coming lord to hear a word from you may you speak to us tonight from your scriptures we are so grateful for how you have preserved us how you have kept us how you have watched over us and lord you have been lord so good beyond our expectations so father may you bless the reading of the word may you bless the teaching tonight lord this humble little word to your people may you take me out of the way lord may you use me as your instrument and speak through me lord may my thoughts and ideas be under the subjection of the holy spirit lord and may lord lives be changed and transformed at the end of the day we don't want to be the same way we were last week or the week before the month before the year before so lord we commit the service into your hands and we thank you in advance for our finished work in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen amen certainly it's a great privilege to be here tonight and we are trusting god uh for what he has planned for us it's it's really a tremendous blessing to see everybody out i know that some people uh had some trouble getting the link um so feel free to send it uh to anybody who you know you may not be seeing in the room tonight um for adventure they did not get it uh looking for a wonderful time around the word of god the word of god is food so we actually come in tonight um you know they say social distancing you know gala to to eat in restaurants and these things but we could come tonight and eat around this this food this food tonight that the the the social distancing rules don't apply we could come together and eat and eat your fill you know eat and and see your life change eat them get a smile on your face eaten and get a change in perspective a paradigm shift uh another look another another look like like elijah told us again you know the first look wasn't the real look you know when he went and looked again and again and he looked seven times then he saw that small sign that represented the change of season you know so uh we thank god for his grace we thank god that as we come to the closing uh chapters of or pages rather of 2020 just in about three weeks or so we close this year that has been a year of years you know i heard somebody say it was this year was like 20 years packed together so much happened in sequence it's like you know it it is that kind of a season that we're living in you know but we thank god for the unfolding of his word we thank god for you know the the ministry that we have been blessed to be under we thank god for how he has kept us and he has has allowed us through this season to do what we have never done before you know um you know had it not been um for this time we would not have even had these bible studies in this kind of a way um but god allowed you know all of this you know to bring changes in not just our lives and changes in church changes in the world the way the world operates the way things happen the way business happens the way you know how you drive and what you buy and what's available you know the way you do business everything is is changing you know and it would be you know remiss of us to to to consider going back to how it used to be you know i see that being an impossibility you know it is as if a chicken has broken out of the egg you know you can't put the pieces of the shell back together and try to fit the chicken back in it you know the wool as we uh used to know it uh you know is no longer exists you know and and it's this type of a situation where you either adapt or you die you either change or you die you know funny enough and and you have to forgive me you know in these bible studies these conversations it gives us some liberty you know to share and to to talk a little bit so i'm just going to kind of chat a little bit before i get to the teaching tonight you know and i was going to say that you know rewind a year ago there are many people who didn't even know what zoom was remind rewind a year ago there are certain technologies and way of doing you know education schooling you know now you have young children muting and unmuting and and and and putting up their hands in zoom classes and and they like because they have been forced to adapt the the the learning curve you know so you know looking at even within you know trinidad and tobago and many countries where e-commerce was not was not you know as active as in the u.s or europe you know you have seen this spike in online transactions and and a lot of ways of doing things that a year ago would not have been the case but that that is the world that we're living in and it's a world of change you know and we realize that as we look at spiritual history look at church history change has been a constant and god has also been a constant you know he said i am the lord and i change not so he is the constant but yet still around that constant is another constant call change you know so we went through the car age we went through the horse and buggy and then the car age and then we we went through the airplane and now we're in the age of the astronauts and now there's so many other dimensions of what is unfolding to us and it and and it now requires more and i want this to resonate with us tonight the expectations are higher in every facet of your life what you have to be conscious of is higher than ever before i look back to when the pandemic started and you know when it first started it was almost like you have to remember your mask you need to be conscious of these things and and and it was a a process of of having to remember these steps to do certain things you know when when you first heard that you know they're going to check your temperature and they do these things at first in in the first hearing of it it sounded like this rigorous process but now after months and months and months it has become normal we have become accustomed to it and and rewind a year ago if you told us that you had to do all of these steps to enter a building we would have said all of that you have to do all of that just to go into the grocery you have to do all of that to go and do to go in the bank you have to do all of that to do this and and just all of a sudden the expectation or if i could say the requirement to do normal living is higher than it was last year and in the same way in the spiritual application of it the expectation that god has for us is also higher and we cannot go back to the standard we were before that the wrong god higher than so i want to encourage us tonight in this vein a little bit and to challenge us uh there's something that is in me about challenging myself challenging individuals um challenging us to do better you know i was i i i have this if i call it a uh i want to be careful and use any word habit or i would rather say a discipline to listen to audiobooks i love listening to audiobooks because i find that it is there's a lot of time that you could waste you know and sometimes you're driving and there's a lot that that you could accomplish while driving and what what i try to do while driving is listening to audiobooks you know and i was listening to to our audiobook and it was speaking about change and these things and about challenging and about and there was a word that the author used about transformation you know when i started whenever i hear something i look at the spiritual side of it as well because the bible say be transformed by the renewing or the rebooting of your mind you know and this thing about transformation really struck me because at the end of the day our encounter with the lord not church not doctrine not belief our encounter with the lord is to bring a change a change in behavior a change in attitude a change in language a change in how we do everything we do that proves that we have had this experience so the bible will say like they took note that they had been with jesus it wasn't the words that they used but it was their behavior you know and i've seen after a while having gone through this you know that's why brother brown is about getting seasoned out experiences come to take certain things away from us experiences come to help us deal with different situations experiences come to do all these things you know so that's my little kind of introduction tonight i don't intend to be too long with us tonight uh just a little inspiration that i had and i told about over i wanted to kind of do a little teach you know have a conversation around this um it is somewhat different in the sense that and during this whole bible study experience we find things that people may not normally focus on but i want to call this teaching tonight planning for 2021 planning for 2021 that's the teaching tonight and i want to start off with a quote from the prophet whereby the brahman said in the message hear he him now jesus when he was here on earth he didn't just go about all haphazardly haphazardly means you're just doing anything you're you're you're you're you're here you're there you you know why you're here you don't know why you're there he said jesus didn't do anything haphazardly so you know when we say we want to be like jesus many of us underestimate the magnitude of that statement after this service after this teaching tonight i want you to rethink that song to be like jesus because if you really because there are aspects of jesus that people easily want to be like you know so so there's the kind jesus they're aspects of the ministry of jesus that people can easily connect with but when you look at the there are other aspects of god and other access of jesus's ministry that are quite a tall order that requires the best of us it requires effort and many of us don't realize how much effort it takes that's why i say we underestimate so he didn't just go about all haphazardly which means that he was intentional it's a word that i use a lot now cause intentional meaning he had an intent or he was very deliberate he wasn't doing it by accident he he he didn't go down the road because he felt going on the road ish to use how about over and say he if you're drivish so he went by drive no if he went somewhere he was going for a specific purpose to meet a specific person to do a certain thing so he always had a plan i want to make the point he always had a plan all right i want to continue on the quote he had one thing to do that was the will of god who sent him now that's powerful because if brother branham is saying here that jesus had one thing to do it meant all of his cumulative actions the totality of all that he did was wrapped up in that one thing it meant every action was part of that one thing and i want us to as we look into 2021 because we're going somewhere tonight what is the thing that we are supposed to be doing and that thing can have different dimensions because there's a spiritual thing that we have to do there are also natural things that we have to do but it's wrapped up in the purpose the purpose singular purpose of god for all of us so he said he had one thing to do that was the will of god who sent him and everywhere he went i want us to wear this now and everybody if i ask a question tonight who wants to be like jesus i don't think there's anybody in this room because if they don't want to be like jesus this is the wrong room but if you want to be like jesus let me talk about attributes of the jesus that we want to be like and everywhere he went everywhere not somewheres everywhere he went everything he'd done had a meaning had a purpose i'm reading the prophet had a plan a for-ordained plan of god everything he did and if we be children of god our life is in the hands of god who orders our footsteps and the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the lord jesus never went places or listen carefully or did things unless it had a meaning and many times you talk to young people and you encourage people and and you realize that 99 of the problems people find themselves in in general but now i'm bringing it specific to believers is because they have gone to a place or they did a thing that really had no meaning in the context of your purpose anybody with me tonight i get them today no this is just a this is the phone this is the appetizer you know we're here to eat tonight is the appetizer i want a lady foundation from the prophet so you know where i'm coming from because i'm gonna run through some scriptures tonight to to let us look at planning i want to look at planning and the whole concept of planning and the fact that you cannot you cannot approach 2021 without a plan that is where i'm going with this you have to have a plan for your marriage you have to have a plan for your business you have to have a plan in your job you have to have a plan for your career you have to have a plan for your prayer life you have to have a plan for your approach to god you have a plan for saving but abraham said you don't know when he's coming so plan as if you come in next 20 years but live i see you coming tomorrow anybody with me tonight so you have to have a plan you want to get healthy for 2021 we are we are believers so planning is part of the dna attribute of god that we want to tap into tonight you want to get healthy you have to have a plan you can't tell me you want to get healthy and you're going to do the same thing you're doing all along then you don't have a plan all i can ask you that thing you want to achieve what is the plan to get it anybody with me what is the plan you want to reconcile your family do you have a plan to do so you want to save to buy a expand what is your plan how will you move from where you are now to where you want to be in god how are you going to move how much how are you going to not be volume on your prayer life anybody with me tonight what does he plan to turn up i get an excited no you have to forgive me the food start to eat good already how are you going to turn up the volume on your prayer life what is the plan what will you push aside come on now to be able to fit this thing in that is more important because it's part of the plan that's tied to your purpose you want to talk to your family more whether they're in church or not in church or you but but what is your plan because watching tv can be part of the plan any oh hello anybody any you know these these cameras kind of offended yeah i hope i hope only there you know everybody there you know all right so so because i challenge and i've shared this before you cannot this world the way the world is now it was easy in the 40s and 50s i'm thinking you see the amount of distractions that we have now if you don't have a plan to fit everything in a day because they want you to to look january they're going to open school virtually so some children in school some children home and zoomed some people doing this some people do in that some people do in the other all kind of different things right you have to know that that that that that you have a plan to be able to navigate how you're gonna get into work who doing this if you just sit down you cannot scream you cannot get a nervous breakdown because that is not your promise anybody with me tonight and you can handle the pressure anybody with me tonight all right all right all right all right so let's start to go into some scriptures i believe my last uh teaching we were we were kind of dealing with proverbs so i'm still going to be pulling some stuff in proverbs because the wisdom of this a lot of it comes from proverbs and and we're going to go through some of it so we're going to start um from in proverbs 21 verse 5. we're not reading necessarily a story or extensive passage might be just going to hit certain verses and if you're taking notes and i encourage you as a discipline yes it'll be on tape but i want to encourage you you see the act of writing there's actually huge studies done with very successful people have a certain thing in common they have a discipline of writing this is not writing on a phone or writing on a computer this is the discipline because the hand-eye coordination it takes to write something long-form-writing creates a strong connection with your mind with your heart with your eyes with memory all right so a little word of encouragement in there right but proverbs 21 5. so we're gonna let's get some scriptures i'm planning right the thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness but of everyone that is hasty only to want all right so i want to read that now when you amplify so we see it here so the plans this is the amplified of the same verse we just read proverbs 21 5 the plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance and advantage so if you want to get ahead if you want to have an advantage you have to have a plan but everyone who acts in haste comes surely to poverty so the wisdom of solomon is saying when you just make a decision and yeah consider it carefully his head is head into poverty but the man who sits down and plans has a diligent plan that is diligent about his plan will surely lead to abundance all right so we're going to move through quickly i'm not going to take up too much time because the real homework tonight is not so much a teacher you know it's after the teaching how you're starting to go to ride on certain things and and you begin to work on your plan that is your your homework tonight so it is one thing to understand that planning will give you an advantage you have to be able to answer you know many times people say going to do this and and ask the question how how are you going to do it because if you don't have a hole it's not going to happen success is not accidental spiritual success natural success success is not accidental especially no especially no you have to be systematic you have to be deliberate you have to be methodological you have to be that way so moving on to proverbs 16 and verse 3. proverbs 16 and verse 3. the bible says commit thy works unto the lord and thy thoughts shall be established commit thy works to the lord commit works unto the lord and thy thoughts shall be established that word thoughts there is really plans all right so in the amplified it says it like this commit your works to the lord and it says submit and trust them to him and your plans will succeed if you respond to his will and guidance so i'm not just saying you're having a plan and and you just planning in a vacuum so you're ignoring everything else and you're just doing what you want to do no now that you understand that that you have to plan and as a christian you're supposed to plan you can't just live your life haphazardly because that's not how jesus operated everything he did was planned everything he did was meditating everything he did was fitting into a context of his destiny all right so because of who you are because of where you're going there are certain places that could no longer be on your gps your certain places can't be in your directory it's certain four numbers you cannot have because that is not leading you closer to where you need to be so now you're planning to do the thing that will bring you to your spiritual destination to your destination that you need for your family for your destination that you need to whatever are the goals and plans that you have that are in alignment with god anybody with me tonight so we have established two points that planning gives you an advantage that's the first point we established that was the proverbs 21 5. we are now talking that you have to now submit your plan because we all now are going into more planning we're planning a slot and i've said it before if you don't have a plan of when you pray when the day comes you're not gonna find it it's not gonna just appear you have to create that space to read your word that is planning you have to create a space to pray that is planning and you want to submit your plan to the lord that's proverbs 16 3. and now let's begin to expand this a bit many people and i'm fortunate to to be one that people come to and say what you think about this i want to do something like this i want to achieve something like this the bible says 15 22 without counsel purposes are disappointed but in the multitude of counselors they are established i want to read that one more time without counsel purposes are disappointed but in the multitude of counselors they are established in other words when you don't get advice your plans will be disappointed and when you have multiple people who you can go and bounce ideas from people who are different types of experts who have different type of experiences who have had their own failures and their successes and now you can now because you're working with the lord is the ultimate personal proof in your planner but you're taking your time because you want to consider what you have not considered you want to see what you have not seen and one of the ways to do that is to go to people who have been down that road before so in the amplified it says without consultation and wise advice plans are frustrated but with many counselors they are established and succeed you know how many people have seen try to do things on their own and feel they went without talking to anybody they went get no advice and the sad thing is there were people around them who had gone on that road before so it's a biblical principle to seek counsel to seek advice and to get counselors around you people around you who are sound who have experience who have walked the road why would you try to do it alone if there are people in your family and i'm talking about even your church family it could be your natural family i'm not limiting that but you want to get counsel because you want to make sure i want to see what i haven't seen yet because you are not an island this world that we live in you can't say well i'm the only person and i'm the best and i don't need any help so god put it there in scripture that you need to talk to people you need to be able to be humble enough to say i'm not sure how to take this road is there somebody who has been here before that can guide me on how to buy this house or should i buy this car you think i gone buy a used car gesso if i meet him and say i used to say but now i've taken it and i open the bonnet and i look at it and i i do i don't even know how to start to figure out if this thing would buy another i would be a fool to go and just see a car and just say well i'm buying it you check the engine no you check the transmission no you check it no so however by it i have a degree your degree in whatever subject unless your degree in car you need to get somebody who is an expert now now look how some people get messed up so there are people who like to be lone rangers so your loan range is because you just have an anti-social spirit oh this is not social licensing this is anti-social spirit so you don't want to talk to people you don't want to tell you what to do you don't want to appear vulnerable the scriptures such as iron sharpen iron confess your first one to another those scriptures are not yours because you just don't want to talk to nobody and sometimes you go praying to the lord to show you what to do and god looking at you and looking at proverbs 15 22 and saying but all those people i put around you who have done these things i put them around you for a purpose so they could go in your car and drive and look at the car you have to buy i want to make it practical because i want us to understand that god put us in this room it's not by accident it's a plan we are we are walking and are planning on being in this room tonight is part of a plan i didn't make the plan we are walking in the plan and we have to learn to lean on each other because if you look at the church in the book of acts that church operated as a strong family anybody with me can we go on so we talk now and i'm kind of structuring the teaching so we talk about planning gives you an advantage proverbs 21 5. we talk about submitting your plan to the lord proverbs 16 3. we talk about seeking counsel when planning so you know you have an advantage you're bringing your plan to your lord you're making sure and get counsel you want to get somebody else to look this thing over to see if it making sense this coronavirus yeah 2020 has disrupted jobs businesses and quite honestly i will tell you from an economic perspective the real ripple effects economically have not hit yet which means by next year there will be ripple effects still so you have a lot of people saying i can open up business i want to do this i got to do this well if it is listen you know many people have the desire to do things if desire alone is what will take to make it then everybody finally know it's not just the desire there has to be a systematic approach and if you could get a better way if you could get a better approach wouldn't you one that way so we say get counsel when planning now we want to talk about including the lord in your plans and this is where i see a lot of young people they they they we say they ramajit itself i'm going to do this i'm going to do that i go and conquer the world and listen i know that i i i went to that myself as a i'm not as young as i used to be but i know how it is when you feel you have it all figured out all right so let's go to the book of james in the new testament to see how james was starting to deal with this situation and and it's really enlightening when you look at it in the amplified to kind of zoom in on the impact of it right james 4 verse 13 james 4 verse 13. i hope this has been a blessing to you it's not our normal teaching but but but we're getting ready for 2021 we kind of deny that this year has been a googly a curve ball unexpected so so what is your response in the spiritual in the natural to this year in preparing for 2021 and beyond by the grace of god all right so james 4 verse 13 go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain so so so james is addressing an economic situation this is not a spiritual situation all right and one of the challenges in the message is that people have not been able to confront the issues of economics and decision making the reality is we all have to work we will have to live we all have to eat so this is context in application here now verse 14 whereas you know not what shall be on the moral for what is your life it is even a vapor that appeared for a little time and then vanish it away for that you ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or do that so a lot of times you know many of us we grow up hearing say lord willing or tomorrow lord willing and we grew up using that freeze this is where it comes from this is the context of placement with james showing them that with all you're doing with all your planning with all your activity make sure you getting that continual approval from the lord by including the lord in even your statements not want to challenge you you know in in recent times you know and and i don't know how it is with you with with business communication and stuff like that but i've started a discipline now you know you're doing an email for work or something and somebody says well uh can you get this to me tomorrow you know or something you send me a proposal and i would and you know i i found myself wondering how should i phrase this because i'm saying i'm going to send you the proposal to you on thursday i said i say you know what i'm going to make it i'm not going to back down from putting it so thursday lord willing so i put it in the email it doesn't matter who i'm writing to it doesn't matter what your message is because this is james in action because you don't know what tomorrow is you don't know what tuesday is and james was teaching them all right so i want to read it in the amplified so we can this could resonate with us because anytime you tell somebody i will see you tomorrow you know this is what james is talking about here all right so listen to the amplified of this same james 4 13 to 15. we're not going to be too long but listen to this in the amplified come now and pay attention to this i'm reading amplified you who say today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city and spend a year there and carry on our business and make a profit this can apply to anything you're doing right yet you do not know the least thing about what may happen in your life tomorrow what is secure in your life you are merely a vapor like a puff of smoke or a wisp of steam from a cooking pot that is visible for a little while and then vanishes into thin air instead you ought to see if the lord wills we will live and we will do this or that so we are building and i'm and i'm building it systematically here by the grace of god planning gives you an advantage proverbs 21 5. you have to submit your plan to the lord proverbs 16 3. you have to seek consul when planning proverbs 15 22 you need to include the lord in your plans which is james 4 13 to 15 and if the lord wills whatever you have to do that's how we do it now let's move to jesus himself teaching on planning you know jesus thought on planning himself i hope after this you say wait a minute i need a plan and i need a plan for tomorrow the rest of this year we're talking about planning for 20 21 i need a plan for christmas in the plan for the rest of this year all right so listen to jesus teaching and planning in luke's in luke 14 verse 28. listen to jesus verse 28. for which of you intending to build a tower sit it not down first and counted the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it so jesus is making a point that here well they're supposed to be normal which of you intending to build a tower don't sit down first and come the cost to see if you have enough to finish it all you ever see unfinished buildings in trinidad host air finish government billing and finish corporate billing and finish three stories four series up and dressed up for years and he said you know if they just built one story they could actually finish it meant that somebody didn't sit down and properly count the course to see if they could finish right verse 29 less happily after he had laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him this is jesus saying this is the consequence of you not planning and not realizing what you need to put in place to achieve a certain something verse 30 saying this is what i'm mocking him this man began to build and was not able to finish anybody with me to tonight verse 31 or what king speaking to leadership now going this is jesus teaching her or what king going to make war against another king sit not down first and consulted whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that comment against him with twenty thousand or else while the other is yet a great way off he send it and ambassador and desired conditions of peace so jesus is saying after he assessed if he could win the war or not he will decide if he have enough men or he need to send somebody to negotiate but that doesn't happen unless there's an attempt to plan because you want victory or you want a positive outcome listen to how jesus uses this now in the life of the believer verse 33 so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he had he cannot be my disciple so jesus put forsaking as part of planning i don't know if anybody caught that he actually tied the act of forsaking because he said you have to know what you need to forsake and to plan you need to take inventory to planning to know what you have to planning to know what you want to achieve and you have to know what you need to let go to achieve it it's like budgeting you want to save you cannot have a plan to save and keep spending the same way you've been spending all the time you're not going to achieve it so you have to forsake something you have to cut back on one box at kfc you have to cut back on on whatever it is because you want to achieve a thing so what are you willing to forsake going into 2021 to be able to achieve it anybody with me tonight i want to read it from the amplified because i really want to nail it down for those who have never studied this out this is the preliminary conversation on planning luke 14 28 for which of you when he wants to build a watchtower for his guards as he amplified does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to finish it otherwise when he has laid a foundation and is unable to finish the building all who see it will begin to ridicule him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish or what king when he sets out to meet another king in battle will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to encounter the one who is coming against him with twenty thousand or else if he feels he is not powerful enough while the other king is still a far distance away he sends an envoy and asks for terms of peace so then listen to the context as a believer now where planning comes in none of you can be my disciples who does not carefully consider the cost and then for my sake give up all his own possessions isn't that powerful that's jesus teaching them so let's build now so i've taken a note in teaching style here so planning gives you an advantage you have to submit your plan unto the lord you have to seek counsel when planning you have to include the lords in your plan we now we introduce jesus foundational teaching on planning in luke 14. and now we're going to say now that planning alone is not enough because a lot of people have good plans and there's no action behind the plan you have plans sitting on there it's like your plans for a house you have any plans but if you start a bill that just will always mean a plan you have a nice house plan it's a beautiful house planner i would stick up on your wall you just get up in the evening and look at it that's great fantastic you have the plan but when anyone start to build all right so listen to proverbs 20 verse 5 counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man of understanding will draw it out i'll read it one more time counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man of understanding will draw it out let me read it in the amplified same scripture a plan that's how it starts so that that council is a plan motive or wise counsel in the heart of a man is like water in a deep well so it's like what in a deep well so the same architectural drawing or the plan for your house it's like what in a deep well you can't access it you can't enjoy it but a man of understanding draws it out that that's why draws it out so a man of understanding will take it from water in the well to water in the cup a man of understanding will move it from being a drawing into a house he could walk into and remember in our teaching on proverbs talk about wisdom knowledge understanding and it's why i said the way we operated in 2019 2018 2017 20 years ago cannot be what is required for 2021 we have to become people of wisdom people of knowledge people of understanding because the bible is saying you know a man of understanding he understands what is required to turn it from plan into manifestation to turn it from water in the well to water in the cup because if it's stainless well how good is it in the well i have a plan you no longer planning to save you no longer planning to save and you're not taking no action towards the planning to to be healthier are planning to stop drinking soft drink are planning to and you're always planning a planning to pray a planning to read the bible a planet and it always wanted you well so a plan in the heart of a man is like water in a deep well i want us to move beyond having it in your heart and it becoming a living reality i plan to worship more well stop planning now and worship now because it's been a good plan let's worship a plan to exercise more feet we spoke about in in our teaching about not complaining so move it from the plant and not complain and not complaining just stop it moving from water in the well to water in the cup i hope this resonates now huh anybody with me tonight is this is this helping anybody to reframe their thinking about being more intentional and and well life happened to me how how what do you mean life happened to you what time you woke up in the morning what was your plan to wake up in the morning well whatever time awake that could be that that does sound jesus though whatever time i wake up is well that doesn't sound like like what we're looking at here tonight what are you doing this week well whatever happened yes whatever happened you have a plan to what you do every monday so so so how you could how you could miss church if you would have a plan how you could so you you you didn't put on your schedule to be in bible study tonight hallelujah you don't have on your calendar wednesday night service me you got you ca you can't tell me your plan to be in wednesday night live stream and you miss it because even on your plan you can miss it anybody with me tonight it means your prayer meeting on friday night how do you party a plan anybody with me tonight you're going to your job why are you recently to work you didn't have you didn't plan you didn't think in advance what you required to be able to put what in place had to be put in place to make it to work on time for you to succeed in your job you don't know what is required for you to succeed in your job if you know what is required what have you put in place to be able to be to be the best at it we are being challenged as disciples we are being challenged to be best in class because jesus was best in class in the early stages of his ministry they referred to him as master and that master was not rulership that master was differentiating master to apprentice they were seeing the elements of mastery when you say beethoven is a master and shakespeare was a master of literature they saw attributes around jesus that spoke of mastery what are you a master of what is it that you do that when people look at you they say it has to be the hand of the lord upon you or are you just comfortable to be average anybody with me tonight i'm challenging us i'm challenging myself god planned he planned what was on the first day he planned was on his second day he didn't decide what they're gonna do today what they're gonna do today on the first day let there be second day let there be third day let there be first age i want paul second age irenaeus all is planned out there's no accident with god he knows he he on your head anybody with me oh i feeling good about his sister eaten i don't have anybody eating as much as me tonight you know let's let's let's jump a little bit i want to bring out something here i see a lot of young people uh talk about the the proverbs 31 woman a lot of lots of proverbs 31 do you have any proverbs 31 sisters in the house tonight i know they're hiding me any cameras anything but but it's a great thing to aspire to be a proverbs 31 woman a virtuous who can find a virtuous woman right so let us look at at one of the attributes of a virtuous woman the proverbs 31 woman because all through that you're seeing well i'll just pull us about about planning all right so proverbs 31 verse 14 she is like the merchant ship she bring it food from afar that is not running by the shop around the corner you don't just bring food from afar by accident to bring food from afar you have to put things in place to bring food from afar one theologian postulated that bringing food from afar were meant putting things in place because they knew the kind of quality food they wanted to have lord help me verse 15 she rise it also while it is yet night that is not whatever time i wake up she'll rise it also while it is yet night and give it meat to her household you don't do that without a plan an apportion to her maidens verse 16 she consider it a field this is ca what are we talking about and buy it it with the fruit of our hand she planted a vineyard you can't do all of that when he did come without a plan let me read it in the amplified she is like the merchant ships abounding with treasure this proverbs 31 woman she brings her household food from afar she rises also while it is still night and gives food to her household and assigns tasks to her needs you cannot assign tasks if you don't know what tasks are required anybody with me what do you want us to do today for you lady of the house well i ain't no no for her to assign tasks she needs to know what is required so she had to have a plan doesn't this restructure your whole life and say my witness buy ready all the time i driving me on cruise control i wasn't sure i was driving you ain't no oh yeah no every listen we need to move from accidental living to intentional living that that's that's that's where we accidental living to intentional living you say what god wants you to see you go where god wants you to go you seek god before you move last verse verse 16 she considers a field listen to the amplified level 16 she considers her field before she buys or accepts it expanding her business prudently that's the amplified version with her profits she plans fruitful vines in her vineyard this is the same woman who woke up early morning to provide food and give out tasks went and considered buy it and with profits plant a vineyard anybody with me now when i'm saying that i'm now talking about details friends you need to pay attention you need to pay attention and it is something we could all do you know because the things we are interested in we pay attention you have people here who are following the u.s election when i tell you they could tell me every state they could tell me who was singing who count to t because they they like that so the internet they know their their forecasting from right the engineer they forecasted if cnn called them they telling them the answer before because they like that but ask them other things they don't know because that's not interesting to them you have to know what is important for you what you need to do to achieve your purpose and i want to talk about details and listen to the scripture proverbs 27 23 and look look at this instruction and this applies and this is this is this is christian living there friends people are true they tell me loosely i'm a believer i'm a christian line up to this one verse 23 proverbs 27 verse 23 be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks and look well to thy hoods in other words useless evil to tell me how much flocks you have how much trees you have in your garden how much how much how much cows you have that apply to business you have cars on your road you have this you have that you have what is your inventory well i had some tools um at a lan one i did borrow one and not let me go and check does that sound like this scripture be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks and look well to thy hoods so this is this is not a question this is not a suggestion this is an instruction you know and this is applying to your job to your business to your life be diligent to know the state of thy flock in other words mind your business take care of your business know the state of your affairs understand what's going on take an inventory tonight what needs to clean out what needs to put in what you have what you need to put in place what you need to do this what we're doing tonight is is is the key to joshua's success was what meditation on your word day or night all this is weird in them you know mystery and you can reach the word you carry the church on time because you can't put a plan in place to reach a church on time but you have a mystery all these dots have to connect in your life you know it all has to make sense the word is not just disconnected because the word that would have appeared disconnected through the ages was wrapped up in this man called jesus oh help me tonight so what would have seemed to be fractured and a little he and a little there could have been wrapped up in jesus and truly prophetic ministry of brother branham is now tied up there's no loose ends so the book is open tonight we have to be diligent to know the state of what is happening with your family do you know well let's bring it home now what is happening in your house be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks look where to thy hood your family is your business jesus said i must be about my father's business so the business is not just for money business it's about god's business can you give an inventory of your prayer life are you diligent about the state of a prayer life anybody with me let's just finish that scripture so we see the context of it verse 24 for riches and not forever and dot the crown endure to every generation so solomon is saying if you don't watch out for your stuff you're going to fall apart verse 25 the here appear it and the tender grass through itself and he heard that the monkeys are gathered the lambs are for thy clothing and the goats are the price of the field do you say all these things matter everything matters and thou shall have goats milk enough for thy food and for the food of thy household and for the maintenance of their millions this outcome of verse 27 is a product of what happened in verse 23 being diligent to know the state of thy flocks you're trying to save but you're not tracking you're saving anybody with me tonight i'm not going to be too much longer almost almost wrapping up so we have gone through a little journey planning gives us an advantage we want to submit our plans here lord we want to seek counsel when planning we want to include the lord in our plans we went through jesus teaching on planning and now we talk about planning alone is not enough the council in the heart of a man is like deep water but amount of understanding will draw it out so you have to understand what is required to draw it out you want to start a business you have to understand the business you're going to study kind of start it it you know just start you have to understand it to draw it out to bring it into fruition we went to the proverbs 31 woman and look at the attributes of her that spoke to the planet because god is showing the same way he planned your life and predestinated certain things he laying this message of planning from genesis or revelation and showing it in there's so many scriptures i can't take it all tonight but to show how important this thing is we talk about planning pay attention to the details god took care of the details with the house you were born into the country you were born into the journey you had to take this school that you went to the person you had to meet to even come to this message because you didn't find the message the message found you and that has been pre-planned or predestinated or pre or for ordained to take place you know how much planning it takes or help us tonight to put all of us here tonight in the same room hallelujah you know what's planning it takes to make it happen that we can be here tonight hearing this gospel it's a lot of planning that we could be here tonight and you don't want to take a little effort to put a plan for your children a plan for your savings a plan for your marriage a plan for your prayer life a plan to really word a plan to be more diligent a plan to add a skill i challenge the church months ago in this pandemic to use your time wisely in the lockdown there are people who do in lockdown wasted their time and their people who apply themselves anybody with me tonight trying to get to the home stretch here now jeremiah 29 powerful scripture and i have the headline here god has plans for us and our plans must line up with his plans jeremiah 29 verse 11 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord and that word taught there's plans i know the plans that i think toward you say the lord thoughts of peace or plans of peace are not of evil to give you an expected end so in other words he is planning towards an end and that end is not finished that end is outcome or result so i'm planning for a result i'm planning for an outcome i want to see you in a certain place so i'm putting things in place for that verse 12 this is jeremiah 29 verse 12 then shall he call upon me and he shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and he shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart it has to be part of your plan your desire you put things in place glory let me read it in the amplified i just want to nail it down for i know the plans and thoughts that i have for you says the lord plans for peace and well-being and not for disaster to give you a future and a hope then you will call on me and you will come and pray to me and i will hear your voice and i will listen to you then with a deep longing my lord a deep longing you will seek me and require me as a vital necessity you will find me when you search for me with all of your heart can we get the lord a hand of praise tonight hallelujah so we're building tonight we're heading to the home stretch we're coming in fast last round here we we're in the last lap here of this race tonight god's counsel will stand proverbs 19 21 there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the council of the lord that shall stand in the amplified many plans are in a man's heart but there's a lord's purpose for him that will stand or be carried out oh that is so powerful tonight so powerful to know that that you are trying to put things in place you want to do right but above that there's god making sure all things work together for good to them who love god who are called according to his purpose because at the end of the day it is the lord's purpose that will stand hit in the hopes right now ephesians familiar scripture ephesians 1 5 having predestinated us that predestinated us is planning unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will have you ever read that any amplified ephesians 1 verse 5 in the amplified he predestined and lovingly planned for us to be adopted to himself as his own children through jesus christ in accordance with the kind intention and good pleasure of his will oh let me read that one more time he predestined and i love this and lovingly planned you mean this whole plan of adoption is a plan is really a plan he predestined and lovingly planned for us to be adopted to himself as his own children through jesus christ in accordance with the kind intention and good pleasure of his will i'm getting ready to close out i told her tonight i'm not was not going to be long and that i think i stick into the plan so i want to close over this quote tonight the oneness of unity but abraham said now god has a plan and the devil has a plan you see that there if you needed a motivation to get your into your planning that is it there because not only is god planning but he devil planning to you know he definitely not sitting now why are we having this meeting he's planning no no how do i go on trip this person up tomorrow boy how i go and get you so frustrated that by the time the service has to stream at 8 pm tomorrow night you'll be out of the spirit it will take you a whole hour to get in the spirit that what he planning right now i talk about over today i had such a rough day today a beer a barely making i call him twice twice i call him i said bro you ready [Laughter] and in in a simple way i told my wife look how easily just pass it back to me twice i tried to i tried to but i tried to i tried to brother o'brien i tried to bod the ball i'm brought over and you have to know because listen you will have these when when you don't feel like and and when i look back on a rewindy day and i say you know what because we live in the natural world you have bills to pay you have things to do you have things i said wait a minute wait a minute this whole day is really connected to this year for me you know the whole flow of my day i could look now and say the whole flow of my day to day was connected to this here because the devil didn't want this so he they're trying to to to to throw things off make sure you yeah yeah you think are they trying to put air in my tire this happened that happened they think they think and all can my team are philly of you they confabulated that's not a word but they could write it down they confobulated and you feel like who else had done attire finish that is when you know the purpose of god stands hallelujah because some of you you try your best to do what you could and you thank god for the purpose of god that could give you strength to keep fighting and then when they come in and get you recharged and your battery gets charged and and your feelings you often come nearby and get you quicker and you feel the anointing you say wait a minute but this devil is a real liar yes but brother stephen cinema what's up the other day he said this satan is a wicked man that's what i said is a wicked man so god has a plan reading it here and the devil has a plan and then the devil listen to the prophet is trying to get all people under his plan while god is trying to get people to be one under his plan so we talk about influence and there are only two influences but ibraheem now say there's influences and there's plans because the influence has to tempt our plan because the devil has a plan to try to pull you away from god with all kinds of different things and some of it could seem innocent it will all be negative things it's just to take your time to take your interest to take your energy so you don't have time and energy and interest for god and god is is pulling your attention tonight and saying listen plan to lock him out close the windows put a plan to close windows put a plan to close the doors put a plan to shut things down to make sure that god has access all the time god should need a password into your life come on now the password is not for him you have to give him permission put the password to lock the devil out anybody with me tonight so there's two great spirits in the world one of them is the devil the other is god the devil has messengers god has messengers and we are at liberty to make our choice to whom we will yield ourselves to and that's whose servants we are so i want to encourage you church in closing tonight we have to face the unknown on the one hand and we are also facing the known on the other hand because what we do know is that god has already put things in place for us to be adopted for us to be perfected for the holy ghost to paul that is in place we are walking in that land anybody with me that is what the beauty of predestination is what branham said he put the engagement ring of predestination so that part we know and we are fulfilling that we are living that out whether we feel like it we don't feel like it we have a good day we have a bad day we have a destination in god at the same time we have to be able to bridge in this world where we have choices what time to cook what time to go to the grocery what time to do this how to live what what what what to study in school and all these things and and the same way god is planning on a grand scale how this whole world will come to an end and all these pieces that will come to place you have to take responsibility you have to take ownership for your decisions for your actions for your words and how you will do what you need to do because there are things that god will do and the thing that you have to do come to it say amen so i want to challenge you begin to put things in place by the grace of god to plan for your 2021. can we just borrow heads or word of prayer or gracious heavenly father a little teaching tonight to encourage your people to challenge your people to push your people lord i'm speaking not just to them but to me also lord to be able to give an account to be able to relook at the approach to every day what you do how you say things what you achieve what you intend to do what you have to put in place and we read that powerful scripture lord where you yourself taught father that how could a man try to build a tower and that county cost how could a king try to go to war and not understand the size of his army versus the enemy he has to find and make the necessary decisions for a positive outcome and how we cannot even be your disciples unless we are able to sit down and calculate the cost of what we need to give up to make room for your glory to make room for holiness to make room for perfection to make room for adoption to make room for redemption because these natural things will take up space if we allow it to but we need to plan to push these things out of our minds out of our heart out of our lives so that the holy spirit can flow freely so that you can say just as it was lord there's my spirit flowing freely this is my beloved son there's no hindrance there's no obstacle lord it's it's not by accident there's an effort there's a sacrifice there's a cost help us to understand that cost help us to bear that cost help us to approach that cost help us further through these scriptures that we read to be able to relook how we move how we live how we act where we get advice from are we getting enough advice are we approaching things in a systematic way do we understand the inventory of our lives of our family of our careers of our businesses of our ministries lord help us as we begin to really look at how you planned everything in a certain way to happen a certain how to do a certain thing help us to be just like you with how we deal with our families our loved ones and our purpose here on this earth may you bless the service tomorrow night that will be streamed out lord and may you touch every life every family every home father that's here tonight in this room father may you bless lord prayer meeting on friday night lord may you bless everyone who is connected may you bless lord every every young brother every young sister every caleb may you bless those that are strong may you make them stronger lord those that are weak father give them strength may you bless the people tonight in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen i'm sorry just before we go friends uh you know sometimes with this technology uh we we could overlook something with sending on messages so i know a message would have gone out um so i just want us to remember the mahong family uh in prayer uh i know most would know that brother mahong would have passed away um but we didn't get to say it in any meeting uh like this or or say it in church it just went across digitally so we want to put it on record to remember his family um you know faithful soldier is a real tremendous blessing to us especially young people as well when he gave his testimony and um all the lord really had worked with him so you want to remember his family in prayer um this has been quite a year um but we trust in god and we thanking god as well for preserving and blessing and strengthening through every different situation and challenge um that we have to deal with so keep on fire stay positive um positivity is important you have to speak positive you have to to to approach things in a positive way so may the lord bless you tonight stay on fire encourage somebody encourage yourself like david in the lord you know so may the lord you bless you tonight god bless you
