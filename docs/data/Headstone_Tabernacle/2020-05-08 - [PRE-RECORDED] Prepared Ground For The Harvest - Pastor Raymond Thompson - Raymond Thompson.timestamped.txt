[46:27] this is harvest time I can't promise you
[46:30] tomorrow I don't know about next week

[46:34] opportunity that you can get right with

[46:59] scriptures in Proverbs 10 verse 5 he
[47:01] that gathereth in summer is the wise son
[47:06] but he that sleepeth in others is the
[47:10] Sun that causes shame Wow
[47:15] so I'm saying this before I'm starting
[47:18] to preach don't sleep in the time of the
[47:21] harvest
[47:21] if you must heed us all these six
[47:24] meetings well yes the last meeting
[47:26] number seven if you were sleeping well
[47:29] wake up tonight today I'm not gonna
[47:31] bring my father's shame I'm not gonna
[47:34] let his name be dragged through the
[47:36] pasture I'm not gonna be a wise son
[47:39] tonight huh and don't bring him shame
[47:41] say Lord I'm waking up and listen the
[47:45] seven thunders wakes us up anyhow so you
[47:47] ought to be awake you can't be sleeping
[47:50] in the time of hours so if you have you
[47:54] wanna make this opportunity tonight well
[47:56] make it tonight brother sister because
[47:59] if you sleep in in the time of the hours
[48:01] you bringing shame on the father
[48:04] sure oh my goodness
[48:10] [Applause]
[48:12] so you better be on fire tonight you
[48:15] better your life must be changed man we
[48:18] can't come in here after year convention
[48:20] the convention we go back the same you
[48:22] must say you know what I wrote somewhere
[48:25] there I don't know what the level of
[48:27] your expectation coming to this meetings
[48:29] my level is very high brother I came
[48:33] here and if you read the Bible it says
[48:35] there in Matthew 13 that the seed was
[48:38] sown probably oh there's something
[48:40] laying right there Isaac he said they in
[48:43] Matthew 13 that the seed that fell on
[48:46] good ground listen now Matthew 30 Jesus
[48:51] his son brought and refer some brought
[48:54] 60
[48:56] and some 30 but that's all in the good
[48:59] grant so how come there's a different
[49:01] levels from the good ground there was
[49:06] different levels so it depends on your
[49:09] expectancy what did you come for you
[49:11] tonight for 3464 I came for a
[49:16] hundredfold brother hallelujah
[49:19] I came for a hundred four I refuse the
[49:22] tea I refuse 60 100 is God brother the
[49:27] secret is out the court 60 is in the
[49:30] court but hundred is the only of Holies
[49:33] there's a kind of glory brother so we're
[49:36] not settling for less don't let the
[49:39] devil let you settle for Less this more
[49:41] God there's more power this morning
[49:44] cleaner this more glad to receive
[49:46] brother hallelujah I've River knowing on
[49:51] that one man I didn't know if I'm a
[49:53] saint but the Holy Spirit laid it on my
[49:56] heart brother Pinker so don't settle for
[49:59] 30 now I'm not even speaking about the
[50:04] deli of the stony thorny in the Rockies
[50:08] I'm speaking about the good ground and
[50:11] three different stages go read it and in
[50:15] Matthew Christ counts from the top down
[50:18] he says wonderful 60/40 Matthew takes
[50:25] you the different way but we preach most
[50:28] of the time from Matthew 30 so it
[50:31] depends what your level of expectancy
[50:34] because you get what you expect so if
[50:38] you came here just to criticize you get
[50:40] enough to criticize if you come here
[50:42] just to be in the convention that's only
[50:45] thirty percent if you come here just
[50:47] well to show your face and to let the
[50:49] pastors know I'm here
[50:50] that's sixty percent but if you came
[50:53] here and as I'm not leaving not until
[50:56] you give me the Holy Spirit I'm not
[50:58] leaving now No
[50:59] till you fill me with your power that's
[51:02] 100% brother
[51:03] you see God deals in the hundred phones
[51:09] hallelujah my I always wondered how
[51:14] could the same ground reduce threefold
[51:24] so that's why I say tonight don't sleep
[51:27] in the time of hours if you're sleeping
[51:30] by now you should be what the ministers
[51:32] priests men
[51:35] brother I tell you this was dynamically
[51:38] this was powerful it should make you go
[51:42] home so enthused that I'm gonna serve
[51:45] God better I'm gonna be on fire
[51:48] I'm gonna be a laborer I'm gonna be a
[51:50] worker God needs more lateness so I'm
[51:54] going there back home I'm not just gonna
[51:56] sit back there and watch things no
[51:58] pastor what can I do
[52:00] Isaac what can I do brother Peter where
[52:03] can I help
[52:04] I wanna be a laborer hallelujah and the
[52:08] labor doesn't mean preaching hallelujah
[52:10] it means plain it means lame before God
[52:14] it means calling upon the name of Jesus
[52:16] praying for the shepherds playing for
[52:19] them ah that's what it means brother a
[52:21] laborer doesn't mean preaching come on
[52:29] we settle in 400 for tonight we know 130
[52:34] we do 160 we want hundredfold hallelujah
[52:42] my my my my my my so I don't know what
[52:46] what's your level of expectancy in the
[52:49] speakings but brother for myself I came
[52:52] brother Theo to put my shoulder to the
[52:54] wheel and knowing the burden we have and
[52:56] we yet to pull that last sheep we have
[53:00] to say come on young person you can make
[53:01] it man
[53:02] this is our story you heard brother Paso
[53:05] truth this morning the story of our
[53:07] lives
[53:09] story of us and while he was preaching
[53:11] now I always remember the quote where
[53:14] brother says when you spell Jesus its
[53:16] Jes and us so us is in Jesus hallelujah
[53:23] us is in Jesus man you name us us our
[53:27] stories in Jesus so are you afraid man
[53:31] show that devil on whose side you are
[53:33] Jesus Jesus brother says Jesus eternal
[53:39] salvation for us hallelujah Oh provide
[53:45] enough I'm gonna preach tonight man
[53:47] come on hallelujah so I don't know what
[53:58] your level of expectation is so god
[54:01] bless you you may be seated
[54:03] so he says Ian works his faith express
[54:07] the Word of God is a seed and must
[54:10] listen the Word of God is the seed and
[54:12] must save the ground prepared before him
[54:15] if he is sowed seed just floated out
[54:17] there on the ground it would do no good
[54:19] the birds would pick it up you throw it
[54:22] among the Fussell's and phones to choke
[54:24] pretty soon Jesus parable said so the
[54:28] ground has to be made very first so God
[54:31] is sovereign grace prepares the heart
[54:34] first he prepared you listen before the
[54:38] foundation of the world you received him
[54:40] in this age what he prepared you before
[54:46] the foundation world to receive him in
[54:48] this age so there's no way you can
[54:51] escape you can be running you can be
[54:53] arrogant you can be indifferent but God
[54:55] is on your track brother if you're
[54:57] naming you and his thoughts well you're
[54:59] gonna come brother
[55:00] you gonna comment because God is in the
[55:03] Sovereign Grace she says here prepares
[55:05] our first he prepared you before the
[55:07] foundation world to receive him in this
[55:09] age he foreknew you by his foreknowledge
[55:11] and no danger to eternal life he knew
[55:14] you therefore he prepared you
[55:17] the reason you you staggered out of
[55:20] these things and staggered into what you
[55:23] have now it was God leading you to the
[55:26] place where he had ordained for you to
[55:28] be if this if this ground isn't prepared
[55:32] before him it can't grow so God didn't
[55:35] prepare you now the day you got saved
[55:37] the day you came into the mess you know
[55:39] you were prepared way before the
[55:41] foundation of the world you better
[55:43] listen to me tonight so that you can see
[55:45] where you stand and your position and
[55:48] what he's speaking to you and what is
[55:49] calling you why do I feel so conflicted
[55:52] why does the Holy Spirit condemn me
[55:55] because your name is on the book Oh
[55:58] [Applause]
[56:00] hallelujah
[56:02] you in God's mind brother his brother
[56:04] always said the ground was prepared and
[56:06] put before the foundation of the world
[56:07] for the seed he prepared you and
[56:10] ordained you to receive him in in this
[56:12] age you can't help it that is why you
[56:14] can't get away from him his sovereign
[56:17] grace prepare your heart to receive the
[56:20] promised word for this age that's the
[56:22] reason you staggered from this and from
[56:24] that and out of those things that could
[56:27] not satisfy your soul until you came
[56:29] into the message of the hour
[56:32] hallelujah until you came into this
[56:34] message something satisfied you brother
[56:37] Alleluia your soul until you came into
[56:40] the message you knew it was right
[56:41] prepared ground from the foundation of
[56:44] the world without you there is no
[56:46] harvest can I say that again without you
[56:52] there's no harvest brother Peter so your
[56:55] name is on the book come on man don't
[56:58] keep up the harvest come and give your
[57:00] life to Christ can we get right with God
[57:02] because without you there's no harvest
[57:06] [Applause]
[57:14] my so without you there's no harvest he
[57:18] says yeah question answers
[57:20] he says when in God's own mind he
[57:23] foresaw a sentry destinated us by his
[57:25] foreknowledge before the foundation of
[57:27] the world
[57:28] oh brother if that wouldn't make the
[57:30] church get up and run through the aisles
[57:33] listen brew Blenheim listen to the
[57:35] Prophet getting excited the first quote
[57:37] also he said I feel like screaming to
[57:39] give vent yeah he says man it should
[57:42] make us wanna get up and run through the
[57:44] aisles
[57:45] think of it you are born again before
[57:48] the foundation of the world God puts
[57:50] your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and
[57:52] Christ died send the Holy Ghost here to
[57:55] call you to eternal life you have
[57:57] received these he senior you are there
[58:00] to the day of redemption he says
[58:02] hallelujah it should make us run through
[58:05] the aisles brother it should make us
[58:07] shout it should make us pains it should
[58:10] make us excited I should make us give
[58:12] our lives to Christ we must be excited
[58:15] man we must have something to the choice
[58:18] over hallelujah if the Prophet felt that
[58:22] way why can't we do it come on every no
[58:28] place demon we find you tonight rain
[58:31] we're gonna worship God we want God to
[58:35] be worshiping God loves to be worship he
[58:40] dwells in the praises of his people when
[58:43] he's worship brother that's the time he

[1:01:05] foundation of the world
[1:01:06] hallelujah the Holy Spirit follows the
[1:01:09] blood all the way from the book of
[1:01:11] redemption he says he and see the seed
[1:01:15] of discrepancy
[1:01:16] he said the seed of God the Word of God
[1:01:18] Jesus said in a certain place that the
[1:01:20] word is a seat and the very seed will
[1:01:23] bring forth of its kind now I like what
[1:01:27] but all who said because I was going to
[1:01:29] say the seed is the power to transform
[1:01:31] itself so the Laurel Isaac lays in the
[1:01:36] sea so in you is the seed how you gonna
[1:01:40] get away from God it has a power to
[1:01:43] transform itself hallelujah
[1:01:46] I might not know how to praise him I
[1:01:48] might not know how to do but somehow
[1:01:50] something changes me I forget my status
[1:01:53] I forget all Who I am
[1:01:55] after what family I come now why the
[1:01:58] Holy Ghost the seed in the soul is
[1:02:02] quickened by the Holy Spirit
[1:02:04] [Applause]
[1:02:14] and just four into the second brother
[1:02:17] Isaac I checked up and I got into there
[1:02:19] it will take too much time to read all
[1:02:21] the quotes I when they go look where
[1:02:24] brother Brandon speaks of thirty and
[1:02:26] sixty I couldn't find it
[1:02:28] everytime he prays he says 104 I
[1:02:31] couldn't find it maybe if you study a
[1:02:34] bit more but the short time I had I
[1:02:36] couldn't find no way where he speaks of
[1:02:38] thirty or sixty every time the prophet
[1:02:41] in is like sixty quotes it's hundred
[1:02:45] under four so you see we don't live in
[1:02:49] the outer court only some people came
[1:02:51] there and they live there for twenty
[1:02:54] years they didn't move on some manage to
[1:02:57] get to the 60% the outer court and they
[1:03:00] came there for twenty years
[1:03:02] but listen man I want to tell you a
[1:03:03] secret did you know there's another
[1:03:05] Court the Holy of Holies that's where
[1:03:09] the presence of God dwells that's where
[1:03:12] the Shekinah glory they say there's no
[1:03:14] light there but there's only one light
[1:03:16] and that's a pearl of fire that hangs
[1:03:19] between the cherubims and they say
[1:03:21] listen up that place is so small it only
[1:03:24] has place for one so you can't take your
[1:03:28] neighbor in you can't take your friend
[1:03:30] or your buddy
[1:03:31] you go alone into the Holy of Holies God
[1:03:34] deals with individuals he don't deal
[1:03:37] with a group of people today in this
[1:03:40] convention he's speaking to individuals
[1:03:43] and they say the Holy of Holies was so
[1:03:47] small it was only enough for one man
[1:03:50] which talk
[1:03:52] only the pure fire Peter but you find
[1:03:58] people that's 20 years in the message to
[1:03:59] living in outer coat coming to church
[1:04:02] paying their ties being in service
[1:04:04] that's all they have and the 64 maybe go
[1:04:08] to the outer court you know they but
[1:04:11] more desperate but it's still not under
[1:04:14] 4 you need to get to the Shekinah glory
[1:04:18] because when you eat in the presence of
[1:04:20] God a dead Rock abroad you speak of
[1:04:27] harvest there was harvest right in the
[1:04:30] Shekinah glory a dead stick came to life
[1:04:34] overnight it parted in blossom and it
[1:04:38] bloomed overnight there was a harvest
[1:04:44] right you see why you're not coming to
[1:04:46] have us because she's selling out the
[1:04:48] court get into the inner court with the
[1:04:50] presence of Gladys and your life will
[1:04:53] blossom out brother
[1:04:54] bloom bring forth blossoms fruit almonds
[1:04:58] sheep eat that brother when he cut in
[1:05:00] the presence of God so please don't
[1:05:11] settle for less
[1:05:12] tell God now tell him now why don't you
[1:05:15] see today before you come in the pray
[1:05:17] line say Lord if you heal me brother
[1:05:19] brain would always ask the people if God
[1:05:21] heals you why do you want healing what
[1:05:23] you're gonna do after that do you go
[1:05:26] back to your old ways or do you say Lord
[1:05:28] if you hear me I'm gonna serve you I'm
[1:05:31] gonna change my life so you must tell
[1:05:34] God that now or didn't you're gonna see
[1:05:36] why it's needed to tell him so the word
[1:05:38] is the seed and every seed will bring
[1:05:40] forth of its kind now if the Christian
[1:05:42] the children of God
[1:05:43] the children of the kingdom has become
[1:05:45] the seed of God then they must be the
[1:05:47] Word of God the Word of God manifested
[1:05:50] in the age that they are living in for
[1:05:52] the promised seed of that age God gave
[1:05:56] his word at the beginning and each age
[1:05:58] had exceed its time and his promises so
[1:06:04] in this this last age harvest time seed

[1:06:13] oh brother oh you can escape a scene is
[1:06:17] given time tonight this time and there's
[1:06:21] promises for this age that's why we so

[1:06:30] promise I'm a prophesy over you what

[1:06:42] realization of the message of the end

[1:09:58] the what crop we are in so he speaking
[1:10:02] of two crops here
[1:10:03] look what crop you in this morning look
[1:10:06] what crop we why he said on this side
[1:10:09] these signs will be following them that
[1:10:11] believe they'll be mocked scoffed and
[1:10:15] like the days of Noah
[1:10:17] they will come this other group back
[1:10:20] here making fun of them heady highminded
[1:10:24] having a form of godliness denying the
[1:10:27] very thing that you are professing so
[1:10:30] you can see what crop you in see these
[1:10:33] through messengers of today Jesus
[1:10:35] foretold that would be Satan with his
[1:10:38] message so there's two groups in the
[1:10:41] time of ours so you must see which group
[1:10:44] you are Oprah I know where I am
[1:10:47] I don't know about you but where I am
[1:10:49] and way this manner that's what I'm
[1:10:52] identified with them I'm identified with
[1:10:54] them because they know where I was group
[1:10:56] they're in hallelujah it says here Satan
[1:11:02] with this mess and his messengers would
[1:11:04] have this going it says yeah and Christ
[1:11:07] now his messenger would have this going
[1:11:10] these signs shall follow them that
[1:11:12] believe see Satan's messengers will be
[1:11:14] having a form of godliness his
[1:11:16] messengers which we have this and then
[1:11:18] he comes back to Christ his messengers
[1:11:21] would have these signs taking up serpent
[1:11:23] drinking deadly things casting out
[1:11:26] Devils laying hands upon the second
[1:11:28] that's what we're gonna do tonight
[1:11:29] that's what this group is gonna do
[1:11:31] that's why you were raised that brother
[1:11:34] for this time for a time as this lay
[1:11:40] hands on the sick receiving the paps
[1:11:42] from the Holy Ghost signs and wonders
[1:11:44] now we in one of the crops and we at the
[1:11:46] end time so when it comes to in time
[1:11:49] like brother Ola was explaining and so
[1:11:52] did brother overt in the different
[1:11:53] ministers that anytime is harvest time
[1:11:56] so when he says here with the end time
[1:11:58] we in the harvest time
[1:12:04] so you in one of these crops criticizing
[1:12:08] and scoffing or believe in the promise
[1:12:10] with the signs and wonders falling Satan
[1:12:12] crop bring sickness and disease but
[1:12:15] God's crop is commissioned to cast out
[1:12:19] Devils they ain't on the sick been
[1:12:22] baptized with the Holy Ghost and that's
[1:12:24] what we come to do tonight is to cast
[1:12:27] out demons that's why I feel the way I
[1:12:30] feel brother is because we're gonna cast
[1:12:32] out demons and you know what brother
[1:12:34] says the preaching of the word cast out
[1:12:37] demon so by the time when you come you
[1:12:41] only receive your promise but you
[1:12:43] already free what made you free brother
[1:12:46] him the Word of God my my I wrote you a
[1:12:57] maniac listen you remember the man that
[1:13:00] came up some maniac but the Peter and he
[1:13:03] was gonna take brother branham apart and
[1:13:05] I met one of the ministers that was in
[1:13:08] that service brother Theo he told me
[1:13:10] first and news he says there was about
[1:13:11] three hundred ministers here and they
[1:13:13] were falling over one another champion
[1:13:15] of the platform and their prophets today
[1:13:17] and then the police came after the man
[1:13:21] they were arresting he said no this is
[1:13:23] not a natural better this is spiritual
[1:13:26] he challenged the Spirit of God oh man
[1:13:31] we had a prophet man we had an example
[1:13:34] seed man hey son of God seed will
[1:13:38] produce Son of God seed come on
[1:13:43] that's how story what Peter and we must
[1:13:46] have what Paul had we must have what
[1:13:49] brother brethren we must have
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:14:00] so the mania came up and the police
[1:14:03] wanted to less is a province is no
[1:14:04] leaving it's not the natural better he
[1:14:08] defied the Spirit of God and then the
[1:14:12] police backed off and he came up and
[1:14:14] brother man you know the story said all
[1:14:16] of a sudden you come that lost spirit
[1:14:18] and he looked at the man and he said
[1:14:20] this is some mother son some little girl
[1:14:23] steady but he says because she
[1:14:26] challenged the Spirit of God you see
[1:14:30] that was the difference there that's
[1:14:32] what David had against the the against
[1:14:36] Goliath

[1:27:54] quote spoken word its original see see
[1:27:59] now I have been so samus of the kind of
[1:28:03] see that I now yeah you don't say so
[1:28:07] plant it for the body there's a big
[1:28:12] difference between sowing and planting
[1:28:14] Provinces planted for the body the rain
[1:28:18] is gonna fall pretty soon I mean the
[1:28:20] real rain and it's gonna have seen too
[1:28:22] fond I hope you see do you understand
[1:28:25] how congregation says Amen it will be
[1:28:27] the Living Word that's what we're
[1:28:31] looking for brother overt that's what
[1:28:33] we're looking for brother Olu the living
[1:28:35] word brother Peter not just word word
[1:28:38] word word word we want to see the spirit
[1:28:41] with the word brother
[1:28:42] that's what brother Branham and that's
[1:28:45] what Peter them had on the day of
[1:28:47] Pentecost they had spirit and word
[1:28:50] together
[1:28:54] it says here it will be the living word
[1:28:56] as it was at the beginning the spoken
[1:28:58] word of God have his power for it's in
[1:29:01] him in his own body work in his own way
[1:29:04] look to the promises that God gave this
[1:29:06] body now we come into something we come
[1:29:09] into Mount Zion and Mount Zion is
[1:29:12] showdown showdown whose pride in was not
[1:29:17] bright whose seed in who was not seeded
[1:29:21] promises those two vines intertwine the
[1:29:24] branches even they grow together
[1:29:27] provinces they rejoice by the same rain
[1:29:29] you ain't seen nothing yet
[1:29:31] you think you've seen jealousy you watch
[1:29:33] when the dynamics is poured out brother
[1:29:35] they rejoice just as much as you rejoice
[1:29:38] because they're also waiting for the
[1:29:40] rain but there's a different life in you
[1:29:42] you got a different image in you and I
[1:29:52] check the with zealous it means fervent
[1:29:55] ardent fanatical passionate impression
[1:30:00] the default devoted committed dedicated
[1:30:03] hardcore enthusiastic eager key over key
[1:30:07] my god so mean I can be fanatical he
[1:30:14] says here Kevin vigorous energetic
[1:30:17] intense fears a zealous worker that's
[1:30:23] what it means
[1:30:24] propose the one sellers of the kind of
[1:30:26] seed that he planted for the body
[1:30:28] he knew the real rain is coming and it
[1:30:30] has to have seed to fall on and he said
[1:30:33] I hope I'd love to see it it was so
[1:30:36] close he said I can almost feel it he
[1:30:38] was hoping it happens in his day
[1:30:40] but God didn't allow him to happen in
[1:30:43] his day so I mean what he had was in the
[1:30:45] fullness the fullness comes now at
[1:30:48] harvest time he's off the scene oh but
[1:30:50] there's another people in the land Oh
[1:30:53] why who under their messenger becomes
[1:30:58] the final voice to the final age they
[1:31:03] will speak for God and they will be
[1:31:06] God's mouth
[1:31:09] the real kick coming and you see the SFC
[1:31:12] I hope I love to see it is it so close I
[1:31:15] almost can feel it look at the promises
[1:31:17] God gave this body now if you go to
[1:31:19] Matthew 13 the parable of the sower I
[1:31:21] already explained today and I'm not
[1:31:23] speaking of thorny and Rockies and and I
[1:31:26] speaking of the good ground that healed
[1:31:29] the three phases of fruit imagine if
[1:31:34] it's a good ground it should have been
[1:31:35] all under this am i right but how come
[1:31:38] he made a difference go really day and
[1:31:40] you I couldn't find a quote where
[1:31:42] Bluebell speaks about the thirty fold
[1:31:44] every time he prays he said Lord
[1:31:46] wonderful I went through all the quotes
[1:31:49] maybe someone will find it I don't know
[1:31:51] but every time he speaks of that Matthew
[1:31:54] 30 he says lord give us wonderful and
[1:31:57] tonight that's what I'm looking for
[1:32:00] hundredfold
[1:32:01] I'm not settling for Less brother Liu if
[1:32:04] he is that's your level of expectancy
[1:32:06] that's up to you but I came for a
[1:32:09] hundredfold
[1:32:15] now promises there is a difference
[1:32:17] between sowing and planting planted
[1:32:20] special seats for the pride body because
[1:32:23] he knew the real rain is coming it must
[1:32:25] have the seed to follow so we so when
[1:32:30] you are sowing as far as I know the oak
[1:32:33] the guy just walks and throws the seed
[1:32:36] that's so in but he says when you plant
[1:32:39] it says you dig a hole you take all
[1:32:43] their and you put you you plant it now
[1:32:52] I'm not doing away with Matthew 13 don't
[1:32:54] get me wrong but brother ben says here
[1:32:57] planting you dig a hole and you put the
[1:32:59] seed in the ground now listen so I'm
[1:33:02] gonna read the scripture someone that we
[1:33:04] always read blessed is the man that
[1:33:07] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:33:08] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:33:11] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[1:33:12] scornful but his delight is in the law
[1:33:15] of the Lord and in his law doth he
[1:33:17] meditate day and night and he she he
[1:33:19] shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:33:23] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[1:33:25] fruit in his season his leaf also shall
[1:33:27] not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:33:29] prosper the ungodly are not so but I
[1:33:32] like the chaff so that's where Burroughs
[1:33:37] was right on the threshing floor and
[1:33:39] that's where they throw the the wheat up
[1:33:41] and the wind blows the tough way come on
[1:33:48] you must be spiritual now so that's
[1:33:52] where Bo's was in the threshing for
[1:33:54] fresh in the wheat thrown it up and the
[1:33:57] wind will come let a moria Shh through
[1:34:00] the shack away the tears
[1:34:05] he says the ungodly are not so bad I
[1:34:08] like the chaff which the wind drives
[1:34:09] away therefore the ungodly shall not
[1:34:11] stand in the judgment nor sinners in the
[1:34:13] congregation of the righteous for the
[1:34:15] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[1:34:17] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[1:34:19] now listen to the court planting the
[1:34:22] vine and way to pondage blessed is the
[1:34:25] man that will not assemble himself with
[1:34:26] this
[1:34:27] office making fun calling the true
[1:34:28] church a bunch of phonetics he shall be
[1:34:31] like a tree that's planted by the rivers
[1:34:32] of water God has put him in a choice
[1:34:36] spot oh I hope you get the stone masters
[1:34:41] please man God has put you in a choice
[1:34:45] spot his fruit shall not wither he shall
[1:34:48] bring forth his leave and his fruits in
[1:34:50] his season was how payment wonder that
[1:34:52] this man is blessed he will be planted
[1:34:55] not just said hope you know I like
[1:34:58] seeing anything that's planted this is
[1:35:01] the Prophet now so don't argue with me
[1:35:04] if you want to argue check out who the
[1:35:07] Prophet then he says your wisdom versus
[1:35:16] faith he says it wasn't sent out he
[1:35:20] shall be like a tree that's sent out
[1:35:22] transposed from this to that he was
[1:35:24] planted
[1:35:25] what predestinated that thought of God
[1:35:29] before the foundation of the world
[1:35:30] placed him there not stuck out not by
[1:35:34] chance but was planted predestinated
[1:35:39] what to the rivers of water now look
[1:35:43] where you planted man he's who shall not
[1:35:46] wither or the process again Oh
[1:35:48] hallelujah though he dies I'll raise him
[1:35:51] up again at the last days that's right
[1:35:53] he's predestinated to be there not just
[1:35:56] by chance he was predestined to catch
[1:35:58] the word when it was sold and shall be
[1:36:01] right there when it sticks she is there
[1:36:04] he's planted not just stuck down he's
[1:36:06] actually planted that's right there's a
[1:36:09] lot of difference now this is a prophet
[1:36:15] speaking a stick in the ground then
[1:36:17] planting something it's different the
[1:36:20] seed was planted it found its own root
[1:36:23] holes when the waters begin to come in
[1:36:26] and break forth its life the spirit so
[1:36:30] that's what what is to give them sea
[1:36:32] life so that's why I am looking in I am
[1:36:36] a sound of abundance of rain
[1:36:37] he says because the rain that the rain
[1:36:40] is coming then he turns around sees I
[1:36:42] mean the real rain
[1:36:44] you mean he's making a difference
[1:36:46] between a shower in the real rain the
[1:36:49] real rain The Arbors rain the let the
[1:36:52] rain that's gonna come brother but he
[1:36:54] must have seen so what is the profit oh
[1:36:56] he's so the seed he put in season for
[1:36:59] the body that's why everyone can't take
[1:37:03] it come on man
[1:37:08] hallelujah I feel like running around
[1:37:11] this war man listen man if you realize
[1:37:13] God plant you in a choice spot your
[1:37:18] leaves cannot wither your fruits cannot
[1:37:20] wither right below low that's what you
[1:37:23] were saying you cannot the see the news
[1:37:25] not weak and strong the seed is strong
[1:37:28] it's gonna overcome but I think show the
[1:37:32] difference of his power this is just the
[1:37:34] end that's lame but you gonna pierce it
[1:37:36] brother sure says restoration the bright
[1:37:45] in David SOI and he spoken he said
[1:37:47] blessed is that man
[1:37:49] and notice he said he could not die his
[1:37:51] lease would would not wither no matter
[1:37:54] what they do they'll never kill that
[1:37:56] tree why it's way he's planted you see
[1:38:00] they tried to kill him but they can
[1:38:02] never kill it because it's where he's
[1:38:04] planted oh god I love this is so
[1:38:07] beautiful man and notice he said he
[1:38:10] could not die sleeves would not wither
[1:38:12] no no no matter what they do they'll
[1:38:14] never kill that tree why it sways
[1:38:16] planted that's what does it it sways
[1:38:19] planted he's planted by the rivers of
[1:38:21] water
[1:38:21] now notice Davis says his roots won't
[1:38:24] die hallelujah
[1:38:26] what if a man is planted in such a thing
[1:38:29] by the river with the springs he says 90
[1:38:32] different springs feeding into him my
[1:38:35] what establishment yes do you realize
[1:38:38] what what you have my what in the
[1:38:41] stephanie has an a man that's planted by
[1:38:43] the river the rivers of water he says

[1:38:49] healing same spirit keeps her
[1:38:50] rassee same spirit and the same spirit
[1:38:53] but many gifts and one Giver
[1:38:55] Oh hallelujah now I like this John 7:38
[1:39:00] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:39:02] has said out of his belly shall flow
[1:39:04] rivers of love it you must believe on
[1:39:07] him as the scripture says said not what
[1:39:12] some past they say but as the scripture
[1:39:16] says said now the prophets word is ain't
[1:39:19] over wrong and we know what Rome was
[1:39:22] supposed to do the prophets word is is
[1:39:24] hanging right in the stain over the
[1:39:26] Antichrist and what he's supposed to do
[1:39:28] he says the prophets word is hanging
[1:39:30] over the world council of churches and
[1:39:32] they were they supposed to prove the
[1:39:35] prophets word is hanging right over a
[1:39:37] bunch of sodomites and brother Peter was
[1:39:39] telling me they had a cape a parade just

[1:39:43] parade so that they think they're
[1:39:45] marching and coming out to the closet
[1:39:46] meet them that's the word that must be
[1:39:48] fulfilled the Prophet said the sodomites
[1:39:51] must be revealed in the state so over

[1:42:24] scriptural signs of the but if
[1:42:27] that tree ever puts forth another branch
[1:42:29] it will be another book of ex-brother
[1:42:31] that's the story of our lives we won the
[1:42:35] same play we've not settling for less
[1:42:37] I'm not settling brother I want to see

[1:42:45] was waves over the people right and they
[1:42:48] say according to the Levitical law why
[1:42:50] is he waived the first corn that comes
[1:42:52] to maturity why is it waived
[1:42:55] do you know why to say that the rest of
[1:42:58] the crop the rest of the crop is also
[1:43:03] coming to maturity so brother Branham
[1:43:06] our first wave sheaf he came brother Liu
