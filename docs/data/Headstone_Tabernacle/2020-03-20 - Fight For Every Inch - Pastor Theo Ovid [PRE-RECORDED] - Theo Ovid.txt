fightin he was fighting for every inch all grumpy zero but he was fightin because he knew she's in revelation he knew that god didn't talk to her he knew it was it was in his spirit and it is for our souls as witness in you you have a right to process what you know belongs to you that's why the biggest I'll cut your head off you think David blindness here that it was done Campbell Allah how accurate you know you have no swing I've cut your head off your muscles so you watch some movie you want some big gesture you can't feel good act like that yes I'm saying when David said I'll cut your head off in you you had the ability to create the environment to deliver that head you have to know it before you know it I show you have to win it before you win it you have to win the fight before you learn in the ring Lawson I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me you have to know I am with you every place every place you put your focus every place you put your foot it's yours I guess I'm still at McIntyre I know your Mac in time you only put them partially growing you know do you need marking time every place they put your foot you have to move you have to act you have to do but I want say we don't back up we take what God said and say that's the truth I will never leave you that's the truth I will never forsake you that's the truth God wanted to have good success and what they show that that one God wants you to have good success not just success good one [Music] because he is because he has spirit and it wasn't finished yet when you take the desk over oh good

glory that God Joshua had to fight every integral but God was with him and every inch of groom you will call my brother you will fight your way through but tip the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God the devil don't want you to believe the word is a sort of the spirit but the word is a sort of the spirit and when you could take the word and say see the Lord when you forget the word and say God sets oh you are using the sword of the Spirit that jesus heals me now I do believe that delivers me know I can take the sword of the Spirit you're free and honest people free but I might not my power but by my spirit promised in the book is yours but God will never give it to you he will fight for every ancient cat so when you see a man possess something you wanted man fight to hell and I
