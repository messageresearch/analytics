your presence we love you tonight we thank you for the anointing we thank you for the word that you sent for us in this last day through a 20th century Prophet father and it's thus sayth the Lord tonight father God may you bless the service bless the word that be read the scriptures that be read and may come and honor your word and confirm it with signs wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name amen amen God bless you thank you brother Gideon Steven praise God God bless you it's good to be back home praise the Lord amen and amen and amen and if have your Bibles I like you to turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 4 we want to read verse 20 we want to read John 1 11-13 and John 12 20- 24 oh praise the Lord thank thank you Jesus reading 1 Corinthians 4:20 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power John 1 1113 he came unto his own and his own receive him not but as many receive him to them give he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh not the will of man but of God in John 12 reading from verse 20 to 24 and there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Philip which which which was of the Cesar of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus Philip cometh and tell it Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily very I say unto you except a corner wheat fall into the ground and die it abide alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit let's pray father we thank you for the scriptures and I pray the word come alive to us tonight May the word become flesh may give Revelation inspiration and confirm your word to the hearts of your children in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated praise God God bless you it's great to be here again among you all and to have this opportunity to share with you the word of God I have a thought I like to share with you tonight I think it's a a a keynote getting to the person Jesus Christ getting to the person Jesus Christ you know brother brandham one time he said he was wondering if the ministers if the people are not getting to Christ they going to church they they listen to ministers preach but are they getting to Christ and this a titled getting to the person Jesus Christ and um and I believe that the true Servants of God in this last day will take the people to the person Jesus Christ I believe that that is what the calling is about it's not as much established churches and systems but to really get the kingdom of God established in the hearts of God's people and the church then becomes a vehicle by which God's seed word could go into your hearts and then that word could turn by Spirit into power and transform your life so it's not so much you stopping this and stop doing this and doing this and not doing this but it's is a matter of what happens but in you that transform you and your desire for transformation now the scripture we read he came unto his own and his own receive him not but as many as receive him to them give he power to become and that in itself could be a sermon all by itself power to become it doesn't mean that you are instant it doesn't mean the work is finished instant it's power to become it's as if a father give a son $10,000 and said do what you want with it to start a business and he has the ability now or $100,000 or a million dollars or whatever it is he has the ability now to take that money and transform it into a multi-million dollar business power to become you don't have to become you could lose it you could blow it and that's why the prophet talk about Sons losing their adoption or losing their placing another brother taking their place and so like that because of their behavior and attitude so we just talking a little bit tonight share something tonight so we want to understand power to become what you are to become we were born in sin and shape of iniquity and God give us something to become something to start us with and you know the prophet said if we only get started God will do the rest so if there's something God given us and has given us to get started now we didn't call ourselves no man can come except the father call him and draw him so we didn't have the start to begin with we didn't start this thing God start this thing we fooling around sinner whatever whatever but God start a work and based upon that work we come what a whatever condition we is filthy half-hearted miserable amen trickster doesn't matter what you are you come because a call come in your life everyone get that call and Jesus he came to his very own but his own rejected him you did not reject him Hallelujah you responded to the call but the call is not to say as you are how you are they call is to receive something to become you still have to become Hallelujah you have to become like Jesus you have to become into the person of Christ the Pentecostals couldn't come into that because all they had was the gifts and they were in the womb Oh Glory to God so didn't other words the person of Christ could not have been introduced to them because the person come by the word and the word comes to the prophet and they rejected the prophet so they couldn't come into the person of Jesus Christ but there's a bright age that have a bright Ministry that could bring the people to the very person of Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God they say sir we would see Jesus they don't want to hear about him you know they have heard about him they come to see him now oh glory to God they heard the books they heard the tapes but they want to see him they heard he was with a prophet but he heard he's supposed to be among a bride oh give the Lord some Praises this is not g now they not trying to thing and saying things this is not that now this is say we would see Jesus not hear him see him oh glory to God give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah glory to God notice brother bam a daughter is a product of mother and father by a union now here is something shocking death physical debt is the United of mother Eve and Satan together disbelieving God's word they United and brought the product of debt Deb is the product of uniting Satan and Eve together Eve had the word Satan is against the word and almost 99 and 900s of it Satan admitted was right so close the Bible said in the last days were deceive very elect if it was possible see how it comes in how it always been it's going out the same way and then he Dro this bomb you United of unbelief in all the full word of God you got it that is what brought thatt what did the prophet bring all the full word of God and people in this message connect that full word with unbelief death Hallelujah dead ministers dead churches debt spiritual debt by having unbelief in all the word of God never before it could have an unbelief in all the word because we didn't have all the word all the words scattered through Seven Ages it took a prophet to come and gather all the word and that's what the Angels did gather all the scattered word to tied back into the word to bring down the Holy Ghost so in this hour this could be fulfilled unbelief in all the word of God there must be no unbelief in that bride she have to believe every word of God because that word is God and you are part of that very word so when you confirm the word by a amen by a praising by a worship you are confirming the word to be God God to you oh glory to God your senses are lying your feelings are lying your back pain are what the lies all is lies God word is true oh give the Lord some Praises that's how Abraham felt every morning s body lying his old AG lying because God said I have a son and he needed transformation power Oh Glory to God to become to get that son oh give the Lord some Praises If Abraham look at his flesh he never believe in transformation but God give him a seed come on now God give him a faith come on now God give him a revelation of Isaac that kept him for 25 years pumping oh give the Lord some Praises it has to have something that keep you alive you have to have something that keep you pumping you have something that could give you a purpose and a drive Oh Glory to God Amen United of unbelief in all the full word of God he said can't be a little bitty and it must be 100% notice God's daughter the church the bride is also a product of God and his word the holy spirit uniting in a body of Flesh it produce the Son of God a product of the righteousness of God prophecy and in the last days we are told as when days of Sodom the bride will be United by the word of God made manifest In the Flesh how the Holy Spirit sealing them into God and sealing unbelief out on the outside Oh Glory to God no man preaching no Mysteries into the ceiling oh give the Lord a shout in the house care what they teach and they preach that'll come back to that I stay right at this rabbit hole right here oh give the Lord a praise let them run the Run let them preach to preach teach to teach at the end of the day it will take the word of God made manifest In the Flesh the Holy Spirit sealing them into God no man can seal you oh give the Lord some Praises no man can put you in the bride National Force but Israel in the Homeland National Force will put the churches and the workl the churches but the power of God will put the people the bride oh give the Lord some Praises tonight are we under promises we preaching promises you know we are promised preachers Oh Glory to God I come to explain all this and all that and long water d m thing I come to bring what God promised because God can't lie and God put Spirit spoken word through that Prophet I can't make it more Spirit spoken than he did oh give the Lord a shout that's why I preaching it the way I'm preaching it he said it it can't lie God can't lie it has to come to pass there's going to be Revival in Trinidad there's going to be Revival in this church there's going to be Revival inside of me there's going to be a new ministry behind this Pulpit oh give the Lord a shout in the house we are prophesying tonight oh glory to God are coming up a new ministry it's a prophecy Oh Glory to God is hanging over this church oh give the Lord a shout in the house there'll be a church with Jesus walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp Oh hallelujah hallelujah so do you get that now Eve and the Satan death the bride and the Holy Spirit life

condemning that woman that he could understand God's forgiveness to him and God told him I you condemn him and I forgive you in other words where you going with that where you going with that you had to fix that and he fixed it oh give the Lord a shout in the house he know the prophet can't go nowhere with that attitude you had to fix that I forgive you you condemn her you had to fix that and he

that mean that cap Stone coming without man cutting it man can he that out oh glory to God I saw a stone cut out without the hands of man and he said that stone is the ending of the Gentile dispensation that's the common of the Holy Ghost oh that's the coming of the Capstone Oh Glory to close the Gentile dispensation and go over to the Jews praise God I ain't watching Israel too long I just turn my eye and turn him back so and I say Israel have trouble and we have trouble I have time to watch Israel who want to watch Israel let Israel I have nothing to talk about Israel let Israel

Praises oh the Holy Spirit of the seed of the church and then the church will be raptured it will be a complete unit of God a bride from Christ a bride for Christ who will be the head of all things you're following me now oh my Hallelujah so brother Brandon promised that the bride will be sealed up in the last days a Holy Spirit the entire Holy Spirit Hallelujah which is the rainbow so you'll be sealed by the rainbow of God isn't that something there amen watch this now but talking I'm say blus name the holy spirit that give the pergamos to okay let say that watch it has been the holy spirit that made the Ephesus Church right with me now it was the Holy Spirit that birthed the sman church it's the holy spirit that gave the pergamos church the the entire church in that it's the holy spirit that built that bride not Holy Spirit the elect that pulled out of all organization and system Through the Ages like that there's an elected here we go a predestinated bride of Jesus Christ that the Holy Spirit has called out the elect and it's been the Holy Ghost in This age that age that age on top of that the Holy Spirit and now oh God as as in the individuals these virtues and things K knowledge and Temperance is added to our faith then when the Capstone come prophecy not if when the Holy Spirit cements it together there is the baptism holy spirit so the baptism of the holy spirit is all them virtues sealed in but the G coming on top from your faith to love seals you with Jesus Christ H let me go again brother you see you see I can't explain these things I'll go off if I stick and start to talk and see a thing and the Holy Spirit explain it and I go It Go funny now you wouldn't know going funny cuz some of the ministers just start so and they start to go so and after years it's so far from the truth they they go on you know and you know it's hard to come back and repent that's what happened a lot of people and know lot of people have left this church and all backsliders and all the hard thing is to recognize that you're wrong people tell me you know what I really make on my behavior and my attitude it was off no that find to justify their position and stay unbelief and sometime God has give people a delusion to believe a lie and be done by it oh Hal actually believe in lies hear this now coming from the holy spirit is come what he will give you Supernatural Faith a spiritual Faith here at the bottom and that spiritual Faith recognizes only the word hallah now people could say they have that but he this back now no matter what anybody else say it don't do no good they only know the word so somebody say the days of Miracles passed that only knows the word somebody say there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost that F only knows the word butam say you could have the B only G 24 hours a day and said be lost and that make a Doctrine you don't need the holy ghost that make a Doctrine the Holy Ghost is not the real thing that is a lie that come from the pit of Hell you know that come from the lower regions you know that make a Doctrine the seed in his soul you're good as long as you SE in his soul you're good so Peter SE in his soul and he shall pass the uper room he said uper room I see you see your soul I work with Jesus but Jesus tell them t until you be endued with power from where On where on high because Peter seed and the soul needed that power high and I how much bright se you think you are you say you are you need power from on high as many as receed him the word to them give he power to become the sons of God acts 18 you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost that's not Luther that's not Wesley that's not Pentecost that's only for this hour here now after the Holy Ghost come upon you and brother Brandon brought the Holy Ghost the person of Christ in all these Building Materials in all these virtues coming here that's the Holy Ghost itself oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God do you see it now we are not Pentecostals huah somebody say there's no such about holy ghost that Faith only knows a word real spiritual faith number one coming to you your mental Faith that's where we start from mental Faith coming down here comes the Holy Spirit down into your mental Faith making it a spiritual Faith then the spiritual Faith only recognize the word now not the mental Faith because the mental Faith sometime but he tell you something you you get you got confused you get mixed up because you have no Revelation so somebody kind of talk some kind of think so that that that that drift your so somebody come that that shake shake your soul because there's no read Revelation Revelation is a rock it's an anchor point it's a point that they could put an anchor on Upon This Rock I'll build my church that's when the word is revealed by divine revelation oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah let B explain it from your faith okay so number watch so watch number okay so from coming down to your mental Faith Comes the Holy Spirit down to your mental faith and making it a spiritual Faith then that spiritual Faith only recognizes the word now number two three then you'll have spiritual you'll have the Holy Spirit and it will seal all these things into you as the Holy Spirit covers this then he said these words from your faith after the Holy Spirit seals you in with Christ then you become one then he quote the scripture at that day you will know like John 14:20 that I am in the Father the father in me I in you you in me then that's a sealed unit of the Lord godu at that time you become a sealed unit they can't unseal you nobody can take that seal off of you you become a seal unit of the Lord God and then not finish yet they are Vindicated and placed not I identify the message you know the message that with me Oh Glory that's the indication we confess We believe We stand for the word but then it switches when this time come glory to God they are Vindicated and placed then he prophesy when that time takes place there's a time for that they become Vindicated sons and Vindicated Daughters of God all we are believers we are sons and so so but this is different this being a title on you Vindicated son Vindicated daughter Oh Glory to God when they go in the hospital they can say as a Vindicated son I say rise up and walk in the name of name of Jesus Christ oh give the Lord some Praises you become that oh glory to God God confirmed that God proved that Jesus Christ a man approved of God oh Hallelujah signs wonders and Miracle among you a man Vindicated by God we haven't seen that yet it coming hallelujah oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah could we drill some more tonight we have a big rocking drill concrete noise but you hallelujah we're drilling down into something here but Bram says here now in the Old Testament when that son was adopted or placed into the family his name was just as good as the check of his daddy was so when Jesus had been obedient and how did he become obedient he linted if you don't say amen and still the scriptures he learned obedience by the things that he suffered we are just normally obedient humbled because we church I'm glory amen hallelujah learned obedience now when Jesus had been obedient Jesus to God God placed him positionally this is him now here we go when the member is born by the Holy Ghost into the family he did not say join church he didn't say when I remember got spoken book and believe brother Bram and message and a PL a book and a PL of tape he didn't say that all right when I in the best Church in the country and the best pastor and the best sister the most literate and the most revelated man orever they want to call him now when a member is born how by the Holy Ghost into the family of God and has proven to have these virtues in him that God can see so this have nothing to do with man this have to do with church this have to do with you and God as I told in in Miami that that that adoption is between Father and Son church have nothing to do with it it's strictly Father and Son Father's son and father's business watch and proven to have these virtues in him that God can see knowledge and Temperance patience brotherly kindness godness in him then God no church not inside at all then God seals him or places him and that is when you see the Sons and Daughters of God and I will put it a SP and tell you not before let me say good not before this is what he's saying here that is when you see Sons and Daughters of God and to make sure is no mistake he continues do you remember Matthew the 17th chapter month Transfiguration you heard he him he said Ephesians 1 5 God has predestinated us onto adoption of sons you see a family when a son is born into it is a son then but that son had Tres to raise it and if that son never come to be the right kind of a son he never become air still a son but not a air if he was the right son the son that will obey his father then that son was adopted or placed positionally he become air to what the father had all right go me along with you Ephesians 1:35 says blessed be to God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ what blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love watch this when when he chose us in him when before the foundation of the world but look at the next verse having predestinated us so even though you are chosen even though you are forn even though you were elected as him before the fin the world now you understand while you're here on this Earth in this time element that you are predestinated or predetermined to be adoption of children by Jesus Christ through himself according to the good pledge of his will that's the general contract but when you look at theine writing it have a lot of stuff inside of there oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God do you get it tonight chosen him Hallelujah chos them before the all that songs nice Hallelujah Glory my name in the L Book of Life and so that's fine but when you're down here your name up there but down here you have a process to go through Oh Glory to God though he was a son yet learn he obedience by the things that he suffered oh give the Lord I shout in the house the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified he said except a corner of weat fall into the ground and die it abide alone and Jesus Christ knew he came to die he came to pay the price he couldn't escape it if it is possible let this got pass a battle going on in the Gethsemane he wrestled and overcome the land of tribe of Judah prevailed to overcome when are you going to wrestle and get ready to go into Gethsemane Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready oh give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah and all what I'm preaching here the ministers have to deal with this first they have to be partakers of this my god when I begin to see this it was shaken for me because I recognize the people go over the minister go the minister me go go go Jordan go Jordan go go go go Jordan now Joshua take them over Oh Glory to God take the people over hey say if the minister don't die the people can't get across the people don't amen have to start with this ministry what is adoption question brother brandham answer this he said it here this is adoption now what is adoption let me get this now I don't know I have a time to go through this he said your adoption is not your birth so we don't want have no potential brother talking about he potentially adopted and potential Sons what kind of nonsense is that what they reading that in this message it don't have that you have potential con all the country shorts so and then some Cricket Locust caterpillar come eat down the whole CRP and your potential going D adoption potential you potentially a corn field but you potentially prep for the local and the caterpillar God de with potential you potentially could cast The Devil out hey ready for that yet devil challenge the disciples you he said Jesus tell not one could do it Devil's talking back to them and Jesus come off the mountain B say he didn't have to talk that say speak for itself he didn't have to talk he devil was trembling right then all Jesus was walking not talking just walking he's just walking up the mountain coming down from the mountain and he step down so them Dev say wait they're waiting to hear instructions yeah I enjoying myself this the best time of my life you all these years I seen the fruit coming on you seen Victory I seen I seen the the the call the Finishing Line that's why I see the Finishing Line oh glory to God we moving right into the manifestation of the sons of God we go inside ins sidea Hallelujah your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing when you are born again St John 117 I believe when you are born of the spirit of God we are sons of God but we were predestinated he said now he said now you say pente say I got born again praise the Lord I got the Holy Ghost fine you're a child of God that's right but it ain't what I'm talking about you were predestined unto adoption adoption is the placing of a son so you have to be warn to be placed oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory oh Hallelujah so the Lord make it clear to me what to present and look at here something we say over and over we going to say it again tonight this is concerning Ministry now how that God has set some in the church to labor pains they get tremendous sometimes when a church prophecy is groan in under the persecution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they grown and cry under labor pains but when they are born one and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists so we have to take take this brother Steven and put that in Ephesians 4:11 not no man come and saying they are pastor and they are prophet and they teacher and evangelist oh who says who that their M saying that but the prophet revealed in other words that Ephesians 4:11 is revealed by the prophet of Malachi 4 as the coming under of the Holy Ghost groaning and travailing and be positionally placed Oh Glory what you saying the ministers have to be positionally placed first before the people can be positionally place oh give the Lord a shout you never hear that before you hear it tonight glory to God God at the place the man of God first because he have a Ministry a new ministry oh give the Lord a shout it will be the ministry of Jesus Christ he has to have that Ministry to be in the fful ministry Oh Glory to God that my Ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ has to step forward Oh Glory to God do I here Praise In The House Hallelujah so watch when they are born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God God then the Holy Ghost set in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists and he come to the church members now then he given to there top level F4 Ministry then he speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom gifts Helens all kind of Miracles that's for the church sir so this is the order in going forward the ministry have to be set then the church is set Oh Glory to God God set the ministry first question this question and answers 30th of August 1964 somebody ask this question when you use the expression that if we do not believe the word we will be eternally separated from Christ do you mean the foolish virgin will live eternally but they will be separated from the New Jerusalem where Christ will dwell with the bright here are those who do not have the Holy Spirit born again as the scripture speaks of being born again if the natural birth requires water blood and spirit does not the spiritual birth require all three stages of grace before the person is truly born again answer absolutely I just explained that this morning you have got to have all stages you are begotten of the spirit just like a baby is begotten in the womb of a mother but not born until they receive the Holy Ghost you are born then you not converted you are in the process of being converted until that time then he went on further that's the reason that all these great Mysteries could not be given to Luther could not be given to Wesley could not be given to the age that just passed by the Pentecostal age why it wasn't time they were begotten so that means they were in the womb yes sir now here we go the person of Christ that we talking about tonight himself the son of man you understand revealing himself in human flesh it could not come until now because who is Son of Man Christ the S of the seed so he is saying I Elijah a son of man revealing the person of Christ the son of man to get the bride oh give the Lord some Praises that you could get the correct birth to be born of the word and spirit mechanics and Dynamics oh give the Lord some Praises do you see it now all right let's go but BR now he talk about the shock has to pull away to give the beat a chance to lay in the Sun so in the message come to all seed shock everything everybody in the message shaking hand Glory Hallelujah but some point in time they have to have something to let's call it the hot jly son Hallelujah when a he takes no shock pull back turn from green to Golden Brown because when everybody inside now everybody looking green you know what I mean new fresh green but then the heat of time the Heat of Trials the sunshine of tribulation and experiences start to make people turn golden green and dry up and start to pull back shock to give the be a chance to live before the son to ripen hallelujah oh glory to God so Faith have to be restored bam did that Faith have to be revealed isn't that right faith has to ripen faith has to mature and be manifested all is the same Faith the same processes restored revealed ripen manifested oh give the Lord some Praises not faith is not just talk Oh Glory to God he said the D he said I believe intellectually you're hearing the message your faith isn't right enough so they has to have a ripen Faith to come into our manifestation Oh Glory to God hallelujah listen to this or the shock has a pull away to give the weat a chance to lay before the son to ripen so he's talking about coming into presence s we would see Jesus watch the message coming right back into the church again forming the body of Jesus Christ just like the original one doesn't Jesus in the last days says the two will be so close will see very lit almost to the real thing is getting Harvest Time this is not Luther's age now this is not Pentecostal this is the bright age and as Moses still continuing and as Moses call a nation out of a Nation Christ today is calling a church out of a church that's the message in the message he's calling a people in the message out of the message from church the bride because church is the shock or church is the shell or church is activities religious activities Hallelujah but people in love with churching they in love with singing specials they in love with Deacon and pastor and activity they in love with the activities that surrounds church but they're not in love with Christ Hallelujah the person Hallelujah cuz a private life is more important than any other activity and te life your personal life this a age of personal life that was say man preaching a lot of mysteries but the the life is very mysterious and that is more important oh Hallelujah brother bandam now to refuse the person that's doing the call in Christ no matter if you're Pentecostal Methodist Luther whatever you are nothing against them you have got to accept the person of Christ which is the word and I have written here not church activities not religious activities doing work and no real love for the Lord to obey the Lord you see because if you love you'll obey let me say it good if you love me you will keep my Commandments if you love me you will obey if you don't love me you will do Church work oh yeah you could do Church work without love you could preach without love you could teach with love you could be ELD without love you could be a deacon without love you could be Usher Without Love you can play music without love every activity you can about people could perform and have nothing to do with Christ that's gift and ability and talent what you want is a consecrated singer a consecrated guitarist a consecrated organist a consecrated piano player everybody line up with Christ hey give shout in the house you want a consecrated Deacon a consecrated Usher a consecrated person that that tell people with to pack pack and attendant everybody line up with the word Oh Glory to God every person walking with Jesus hallelujah oh give the Lord some Praises right with me [Music] tonight to beo but talk about my mother she had been a certain certain member of a certain church for many years and my father come up and said they look for Christ among the people my family Raised Me Up in such another church but we don't see Christ how much stories you hear about people children who don't see nothing about the gospel in the home the parents might be operational in the church but they're not seeing any life I don't mean to go I'm not trying to get provoke it tonight and I'm not trying to interfere with your spirit tonight but I how to tell you the truth Mary and Joseph made a mistake one time they were good people they went to Jerusalem to the feast and they missed Jesus among them and they sought him and was not found did you know where they found him right where they left him and brother Bram took that to interject this that is where we will find him that is where the church will find him we we won't find him in lectures we won't find him in entertainers we won't find him in the way we dress I remember in the early years when I first come to the message and then Brothers I get baptized and what them brother Taylor and that Taylor is where pants to all them vers and they make the tail they make with ple and then I see they went cutting pants and we train that hotson but cut no not cutting pants Wool Wool Wool and I'm making Wool with ple and I walking like a little small Prof myself until one day I see so much a hole in that wool and E put so much a hole in that wool I said what is this I don't like pleats I went and going to a next tayor and I and I I playing no no pleats when straight PS when I brother see me you back I was stunned you you see what happening there that become a message thing you wear BS and you looking you know mean fall on the B them I don't want to be like nobody else I am original authentic this me and I signed that off after that I fire every message thing they had fire that fire burn tradition of the elders break all them rules Hallelujah watch you won't find him the way we dress or the denomination we belong to we will go back to the day of Pentecost where he came into the church there is where we'll find him but bam never took his eyes off of that he never took his eyes off the Holy Ghost he never stopped pointing people to the original that is why he's in a prophet to turn our hearts W back to the Fai of the fathers Oh Glory to God you can't come forward until you go back you had to pick up what they had back there because that was the original that way God light up the church that where God started the church that way he say I am Alpha when come I am Omega go and pick up the fire from alpha Oh Glory to God Alpha and Omega is the same oh give the Lord some Praises Glory of God God sent a prophet for us to pick back up what they had and they had fire they had power not this dead intellectual Church bench Waring people praise God follow of the churches and talking about they believe a message hallelujah praise God they don't even know what the prophet prophesy they have no Revelation in this message praise God they talking about the message but where is the real prophetic vision of the message to say where we going where's the panoramic that you could see and run with it like I said write the vision make it plain that he that read me run so the people should be running now because we coming on to the close praise God Hama start the drama and whatnot Israel fighting back and whatnot that's just the beginning you know it's like a spark start you know that they going stop now it will just break into something and something and something that's how we going to be we are coming down to the close we have the time of the end and the end of time oh give the Lord some Praises we have long been in a time of the end but then going become an end of time for the Gentile dispensation oh give the Lord a praise offering Oh Glory to God God want to move back to the Jews 144,000 to pick them up but before you go to them there's a bride to be sealed we read that there's a church to be sealed we read that Hallelujah go back where we left him to where we can take his word and add nothing to it oh my let's continue so many people are listening to enticing Spirits instead of taking the word of God Spirits they are in the world they are demons and they go out into place and they got amongst they get amongst men ministers what Revelations that he man bring I know he not God is a loal region devil a special quality one a special message one never he before never said that before a message Spirit he talking message but it's some hell bringing cuckoo Revelation they get among men ministers that where they start from woo now see George you see where they start from not the church people yet know they start there first climat among ministers then he said they get among church members you see start from to so then if the Holy Ghost had to come back had first come among the ministers and then come back in the church Oh Glory to God because them demons hit in the ministers first hit them hard and they come talk about the Met angel and God tell them and got the line I said bring Angel and come tell me what Angel tell you but they have nobody to examine that and that that testimony frighten everybody in church and they say good Angel nobody see the angel and they hear what the angel say hear what the angel say Ang come to watch you for Instagram I have a picture with a light what a light supposed to be the Bible talk about the angel the devil will be like an angel of Light you know Satan taking a picture with you you can't talk that talk it has to have words behind that oh glory to God God just tell Moses do that and do that you have words behind that I am come down to deliver Oh Glory go and tell Pharaoh let my people go Oh Glory to God I come down but you go is have instructions and Moses talk back to God he said who shall I say send me he said tell them I am that I am Oh Glory to God what troubles have Moses tell them who I am tell them I am that I am sent you when Moses come he go with anointing he go with faith he go with power he go with Revelation and inspiration and he said I bring you a word Pharaoh let my people go Oh Glory to God and when God send you he going to give you anointing he going you power and authority to release your family to release me from sicknesses and diseases God will send you forth Oh Glory to God people just went but this one will to be sent oh give the Lord a praise Hallelujah some just went but God will appoint people to be sent sent on hallu Glory there's a prophecy but David Ministry I'm talking about David Ministry Rising on the on the scene to to deal with Goliath on the fields intellectual Giants shaking Nations and shaking kingdoms oh God a little plow boy like Lisha a little David with some sling oh let's continue now they get among church members they get among good people they not bad folks you know bad folks terrible all by theel these good people now and they cause them to come into an illusion and they say things and do things and teache things and practice things that is contrary to the word of God all of that so I have a right to be on guard and with my guns too and my sword to the ministers allow congregations to allow the people to play cars in the churches and so on and they try to do subsidary anything they try to adop a new plan they try to adop education to take the place of the Holy Ghost you're never able to do it no matter how well your man is educated I think is a good thing for him to be educated but if he hasn't got the Holy Spirit education will do him no good education will never take the place of the leadership of the Holy Spirit that's why I know them kingdoms them intellectual kingdoms will eventually fall that's I do how to show them down I do how to fight them and call them out and say that no no no I'm nothing that Bible said the Lord of that servant I leing them up to God they can to be servants the Lord of that servant will deal with him I am not the Lord so I am not called to deal with that so that don't deal with them things I don't with faults and all kind of things too much if I preach on false and what not when we going stop 365 days we still preaching about false it's too much I sticking with the real dollar I this false you see this here look at that look at that sa and you examin and you going in a false mode don't go there find out what is for you ask God for revelation of what is your possession you're not interested in false you interested in what God is true whatever is true whatsoever is lovely whatever is a good report think on these things oh give the Lord some praises Glory all right now these Greeks I'm going to wrap up here now these Greeks were not looking for a lecturer on Jesus Christ they wasn't looking for pulpit CLS they wanted to see him the person Jesus Christ they long to see him because they had heard of him and F come by hearing and hearing the word they wanted to see Jesus now I'm still reading they never said they wanted to hear him they had already heard they wanted to see that wasn't the question we would like to hear Jesus we would like to hear fresh Mysteries we would like to hear fresh Revelations like we never see it so before no that was the question they wanted they wanted to hear Jesus they wanted to see Jesus that was their purpose crying he this mom not to have him explained all all right I need to explain you a seen

the Lord some Praises now hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah brother Bram not to have them explain today with great intellectual messages we can explain it till you can see the picture that is isn't what we looking for tonight we are not looking for the mechanics we are looking for the Dynamics of it after 50 plus years we can't be looking for no mechanics we have to be looking for Dynamics I reject trying to look for any mechanics Right Now Praise I will tell them teachers sit down and shut up except the produc damic keep quiet stay in your corner stay in your line stay in your lane keep driving your car Oh Glory to God until they can produce something keep quiet keep it low Oh Glory to God God I told them in Miami they not going to close us down for PL books and tapes and have books

super Church Hallelujah a power in the church oh Hallelujah glory to God glory to God thank you Jesus all right let's we but say we have got the mechanics of religions of so bized it looks like a big 16 35 coach train sitting on a track but if you haven't got any steam in it it take Dynamic to perform the mechanics we need now to see that see he said we need now to see that this what we have been taught over the years is it the truth or not it's been explained over and over and over through different Seminary and churches so forth until we are looking to see who this person is you say brother brandham how would you do it well did you notice they come to a servant of Christ who had been trained to know what to do not to just sit down stay here wait now I explain it he brought them straight to him Hallelujah that's what they wanted to see we would see Jesus not we like you to explain it to us and tell us what it's all about that wasn't the question the one is see Jesus not not we need an x- man to explain what brother say so the ministers need a leader there the ministers don't need the Holy Ghost they need a guide some man to come and some Super Genius who have more head than heart makes no sense here what he saying they want to see Jesus God had someone standing there Phillip that could take them and show them to the person Jesus Christ and that's I get taught from tonight get into the person of Jesus Christ now what do we want to see we want to see the person well brother brandham we will see him when he comes yes but he promised that he in the person of the Holy Spirit would come in the last days and would be with us even in us to the end of the world we find we couldn't find him in fine lectures because we find people who can stand up and can explain the word in such a way it is breathtaking I this Prophet it's bread taken but when we find it it's still just a lecture it's mechanics just talk and you train like to talk all right we find the Entertainer go through the action and so forth still isn't it that isn't what we looking for we are looking for the person Jesus Christ see the person Jesus Christ now if the Bible said he's the same yesterday then forever then he must be that or the Bible is wrong then here we go now when the church says we got it we got it we got it and so forth and if you got it you would show it see the person Christ Jesus so any church that say the god got it they got it show it that's right don't just talk about you get it come down here by we we we have it have what it walk the talk sit and shut up so I will tell

right the only way to find out what he is is to find out what he was because he's unchangeable God can never change he has never changed he's the same yesterday than forever he must remain the same his word must remain the same his plans must remain the same we tried everything in the world to get by with th his plans men has tried to make a way to educate man to Fellowship it failed we tried to denominate them to Fellowship it failed God has one place he meets men that is under the blood oh God have mercy and blood is Faith and virtue and knowledge sprinkle blood seven times northward Eastward Oh Glory to God sprinkle that blood and God splashed that blood that's why we are covered tonight oh glory to God oh the blood of Jesus tonight oh my Lord hallelujah I'm almost done I'm on page eight of 13 Pages Oh Glory to God ah my God hallelujah my Lord Brother B talk about now the great a has approached our Lord one of the most trying times of all his Earthly Journeys are just was just at hand testing time Jesus had to go through testings just a as we go through testings the Bible said every son that cometh to God must first be tested trained corrected now many people it is a showdown when a testing time come it's a time of proven place and the Bible says if we cannot stand testing we become illegitimate illegitimate children we are professing God to be our father but then he's not our father if we have correctly and with all our heart received the Lord Jesus as our personal savior there is nothing is this Earth and that eternity can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus I am a St founded in this day and always have been when people profess to be Christians and the first little trial comes on they fall by the way side it goes to show that here we go and this the Anchor Point tonight on the opposite side it goes to show it was an intellectual conception of Christ they in church long time all of a sudden something knock them out they never had a foundation tell them in Miami all them brothers who leave the message now and and don't believe brother Bram never a revelation they were always Hypocrites and impersonators they were always that and some of them were there for 20 years 30 years for much years and they leave it now they never had a revelation because she a punished rock my church how that could move how you can move when you have a revelation they never had it it's just they get exposed and they had to walk like Judas or like the or or like those don't make believers they had to walk away and they're fighting the message oh my brother bam watch this that's the reason so many doesn't hold out today is because it's an intellectual conception intellectually you could believe it but it goes further than that to accept Christ is to accept the person of Christ here we go almost done many of us accept religion of Christianity upon learning of Creeds that's teaching now others accept Christianity upon doctrines of baptism others believe that they're Christians because of some emotion that they exercise shouting dancing in the spirit speaking in tongues have some marvelous gift to present all those things are good in their place but it's to accept Christ is to accept the person of Christ and then all these other things will automatically fall in line so what I want to show you is this somebody could have all these other doctrinal things and they believe this and they believe that and this legalism thing and they don't wear this and they don't wear that and they wear this and wear that and whatnot and that have nothing to do with the person of Jesus Christ in other words they executive Catholic Mage executive Baptist they just just substitute different things brother Brown if God did not spare his own son from Cruel testing then he will not spare you or I from Cruel testing Jesus was here confronting the greatest test that he ever had Gethsemane late before him that once all sufficient test must come and the burdens of the entire world laid upon his blessed shoulder there was no one in all heaven or Earth could ever stood up but him and to know that all of his sins past present present sins future sins rested upon this decision it was one of the most greatest victories that Christ ever won or prove his great messiahship as when he said to God not my will but thy will be done that was the greatest Victory ever won all the Demons of Tor was around tempt him and the try him here we go here the bum and when we get right with God when our hearts become pure and the Holy Spirit has taken its place in our heart it is the most glorious thing to have testing he show you how it come glorious you know when your heart is right when your heart become pure and the Holy Spirit has taken his place in our hearts is the most glorious thing to have his testing the Bible tells us that our testings and trials are more precious to us than gold and silver of this world so we should be thankful Hallelujah you say well wait a minute if some Bishop would tell me that Bishops can't reach Supernatural many times the Bishops in the message God take the foolish things of the world to confound the wise it wasn't Kus that passed through the gate called beautiful that he of a man it was Peter ignorant and Le but they know he had been with Jesus certainly when you were with Jesus and belong to him the works that Jesus does you'll do also watch this part he said no you're going to hear it for your last time sometime so what Daniel preached in Babylon before it was finally happened it looks so close don't take no chance but when the last Gentile is brought into the body of Christ there'll be room for no more look at the phrasing not the last Gentile get a book CTI that's not the same thing not when last Gentile believe but AB in whatever language they have these are not books is not that when the last Gentile is brought into the body how do we get into the body by one by one teaching by one Mystery by seven Mysteries by one spirit you can't change that by one Spirit you are baptized into the body then you get into the body called the body of Christ which is the kingdom of God hallelujah and the kingdom is not in word but in power all right let's go but Bram said this now don't take no chance when the last Gentile is brought into the body of Christ there'll be no more room no more won't you make a stand for him why don't you call yourself a a soldier why don't you confess your sins you say brother brandham I belong to the Methodist I don't care what church you belong to I am asking you to accept Christ the person of Christ which is the Holy Ghost in you that changes your whole attitude changes your being and if you haven't got that you will miss the Rapture and you are going to be there for the tribulation so friends getting to the personal Christ is the most important vision you could get to prepare your heart for the coming of the Lord Brother brandham Dr Morris Redfield redhead the president of the great Sudan missions the greatest in the world came to me recently and in the room he said but brandham I have enough degrees with honorary degrees to plaster your wall he said but where is Christ in any of it has the teachers been wrong I said I I would not wish to say that sir I a person with grammar school education I could not say that those great fine teachers have been wrong but they told you truth but Christ doesn't go by degrees you get their treat theology Christ is by faith he is not a myth he's a person and then he said this year the holy spirit is not a thought it is a person when he the Holy Ghost is come he personal pronoun is a person of Christ and the form of the Holy Spirit living in you I am the vine you the branches Oh Glory to God oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God now if you don't believe in there's a real devil you don't believe there's a God you've got to believe the contrary the pro and the cons there's a real devil and he's a person not a thought he's a person now there's teaching goes on that says the devil is just an evil thought you get no it isn't the Devil is a person the same people believe that the Holy Ghost is just a good thought you get don't believe that the Holy Ghost is a person it's the person of Christ in spirit form Oh Glory to God we're going well good if I stay in United States I'm an American as long I'm a citizen of the member of United States I'm a part of it if I go to Germany deny my membership here or my citizenship I take out citizenship in Germany I'm no more an American now when you join a system and you become a citizen of that system you are showing what you are and in this last day God is calling the people out of it the Bible says so come out of her be not partakers with her what Abraham said now watch that's the reason I spoke against the church the lodge I call it when God said come be born they say come join when the baptism of the spirit is falsely took over for waer in the Catholic Church handshake in the Protestant church and and emotion in the Pentecostal church and um all it says in this message now um they say the back goes without without sensation nothing moving the dead no sensation with no revelation of what the prophet talk about about the person of Christ all right hear this out watch when the baptism of the spirit is for wafer of loaf wafer in the Catholic Church handshake Protestant church and and emotion in the Pentecostal church instead of here we go brother the George instead of the person of Christ coming in with all that pyramid building we had the other day so he identified brother stepen this pyramid building is the person of Christ coming into the believer oh give the Lord some Praises then he say add to your faith virtue and so forth first second Peter I believe it is all these things godliness and Purity and Holiness you are sealed

somewhere in a little cabin or Hillside or in a washroom somewhere and there will anoint you for a certain service or a certain thing to do it won't be the laying on the hands of the presbyter elders
