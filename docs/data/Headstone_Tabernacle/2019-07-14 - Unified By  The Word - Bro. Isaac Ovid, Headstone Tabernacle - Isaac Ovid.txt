harvest time season oh god we love you this we thank you we give it a praise we give it a glory Lord we pray a special blessing and every believer that's here this morning those that are on the internet alone me you bless them also those that when he had a deep today repair special blessing on our pastor knock pastor's wife as in Lord of convention in West Palm Beach Florida Lamia continued to be with them under believers over there and may you bless us here today we committed service in their hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen and the church says amen amen so it happened to be the house of the Lord today happy Davina's presence Amen so this morning we actually gonna go back to the convention you appreciate the convention what a tremendous blessing a man would steal us and you know many times we are doing so many different things during the period of the convention that we might miss one or two things so we don't want to miss anything at all so this morning we're gonna go back your PC but pressured by the Peter Chandler day man it's been a blessing time and time again so but before we get too steep but it's gonna share a few things with you this morning so if you have your Bibles will you turn with me to Ephesians for a reading from verse 1 Ephesians 4 and reading from verse 1 I therefore just Paul speaking the prisoner of the Lord beseech II that he walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called I wanna see that again I therefore the prisoner of the Lord so he understands that he has constraints he understands that he has limitations and he's happy to be call a prisoner of the Lord because a prisoner cannot do what he wants to do a prisoner has to exist within the rules the regulations the structure of the prison that he is in and Paul is happy to be a prisoner of the Lord so he doesn't count the constraints that he is in as a problem but he cannot behave any way he wants because he's a prisoner of the Lord he said I beseech you that he walk worthy of the vocation so there's a vocation where he'll call and you have to work worthy of it and he gives the conditions of how that is to be done with all lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all may the Lord and a blessing to the reading of this word you may be seated for a few minutes just before we play by the Chandler's message this morning and if I were to have a very brief title for this few words before the tape it'll be unified by the word can the church say man unified by the word not unified by movement not unified by pastor not unified by church not unified by group not unified by affiliation not unified by identification but unified by the wood because when we are unified by the word God is pleased can the church say Amen - always had a desire to be United see that the false unity that existed when they try to build the Tower of Babel and we know that man got together and they were unified for one purpose but but abandom said i was a false unity but we need to be united on the one hand united under the word united under the holy ghost' united under the spirit because it's one body and it's one holy spirit and in every church have three kinds of believers so no one Church can see they have it no one should can see the ayats because within that church is three kinds of believers no make believers the unbelievers and the true believers can the chit's amen so we are seeing something happening around the world and we're seeing believers gathering together and it's and it's not something that is force is called doing something when God starts to do something it's not man's activity but God putting a pull on the heart to see let's get together let's do something with the kingdom of God because it's one buddy and it's one spirit it's not man doing and it's not because of who this person is or who that person is but it's because God is doing it can the church say Amen so I bring greetings as well this morning uh pretty much right after the convention on Wednesday morning but over flew out a convention in West Palm Beach Florida but the Rieman Thompson is also there brother Olu and they're there so they went from one convention right and another convention that started on Thursday night Friday night Saturday mornings had to the evening and their church this morning and to have some wonderful fellowship with some friends that are all and some friends that I knew but West's co-hosting the convention in West Palm Beach Florida and they're having a wonderful time of fellowship and worship so we are happy to see what God is doing amen and some of our old friend by the West cool by the Jackie Doug by the Underwood and and then we meet some new friend with a Jared huge spook and brother Bokassa from Paris and a brother from Zambia last night with a tremendous tremendous testimony a young boy from the church got knocked down with a car I believe in Paris and the ambulance scheme and fire people came and he said the boy is dead decided to write up the death certificate and the Lord spoke to the past and she called the Father and tell the father the boy is not dead so while the fire people trying to write him a death certificate the father say my pastor told me to tell you that God told him that my son is not dead hallelujah and they prayed and before you know it a young boy cut up cut up from that man why the devil trying to write your death certificate go on already pronounced healing victory life hallelujah mani he gave another you maybe CD to give another testimony of a young boy he was coming to chill she was deaf and dumb on every service after every service he made it his business to come and shake the past his hand he was coming to church not hearing you can't speak he can hear but every sill is come in a chicken the minister's and then one day after you doing it over and over and over when they come and see it boys do pasta hallelujah and from that day that boy is talking you wanna tell me God it's not a lie if you wanna tell me God it's not real be it unto you this morning according to your feet hallelujah oh we are gonna have a grand time up in heaven with all these testimonies of how we made it over and the struggles we went through but before we get over there we're gonna have testimonies here also because God's gonna unite his people not by movement but by the Holy Ghost itself the word in you will see the word in me the seed in you will connected a seed in me the Holy Ghost in you will connect to the Holy Ghost send me and brother branham said one of these days the water the rain is gonna fall so much with a Terence the waters gonna rise so high that the Ducks will love to fellowship will fellowship together under the headship of the Lord Jesus Christ unified by the word when you see me you see the word when you see it my brother you see the word adapter you shall know I'm and the father in me and I in you Oh hallelujah you may be seated so many of these things that unfolded we didn't plan it we didn't orchestrate it God saw everything happen the way it's supposed to happen God already saw all of these tapes that we are living out he already wants these teams already he already knows how to tape ends he already knows the end of your story he knows the end of my story he sees you receiving the Holy Ghost he sees you adopted these shoes you shaking a snake off into the fire he sees you breaking free from the demon of lust of breaking free from the key one up here breaking free from all sin or condemnation the demon of fornication the demon of adultery not knowing where you come from not knowing where you co him he sees you free he sees you shouting at the end of your tape it's because he saw your tape he put your name in the book it's because you oh this is harvest time this is manifestation time this is the end time this is revival time this is the time for the joy of the sons of God to be restored it's a restoration of all things is it coming to the end of all things hallelujah my unified by the unified by the word unified by the world we have to be unified by the word and then there's a unity of the Spirit they were in the upper room under a prophecy they were unified by the word hallelujah hurry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high the spirit hadn't come yet but the Bible says they were in one mind up they were in one Accord they had one expectation they had one hope he had one calling they were looking at one another honey they just had the word but they were unified by the word the word brought them together it wasn't brothers Rita invited you to the service that was not in time they all heard the word and they were connected to them and they came to service her on a Sunday morning they came on July 14 under the hot July Sun when there's a acceleration of ripening and a deceleration of growth up to come to maturity under the hot Sun for our glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire there are many types as a minister said all over the all over the convention there are so many things you'd appreciate but how this time but how this time is the ending of time it's the ending of all things and we know that everything that had a beginning has to have an ending diabetes had a beginning it must have an ending high blood pressure had a beginning it must have an ending what are you talking about it's got to cool because it says have this time we are counting down to sister Christine eyes being open because blindness eye condition had a beginning it's gonna have an ending your daughter being backslidden that has to come to an end because we're back slidden was not here before the beginning that's a new condition and everything that had a beginning must come to an ending hallelujah my I'm feeling good this morning I feel like anything could happen I feel like the Red Sea could open up this morning I feel like I can lift up the kids like Samson this morning because thy seed shall possess the kids are the enemy that seed of the world in you has to possess every kid every problem every situation that's why we worship and that's why the devil is trembling because you are here this morning you have made it to the upper room wherever you are if you're hearing this you are made it to your upper room experience hallelujah you may be seated in the upper room they were afraid in the upper room they were worried in the upper room they were put in fact in the upper room the Bible said they were hiding for fear of persecution but even though they had external situations and external problems didn't take away the worship that they had in the upper room because the promise was real to them and with the Branham said in his prophetic ministry that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real today as it was on the day of Pentecost it's it's not 98% real he said just as real if not 82% real is that it's real for some people and no it's just as real if you come under the same conditions if you come with the same expectation if you make the same preparations if you have the same faith be it unto you according to your feet I'm about to wrap up I'm not the preacher this morning the Holy Ghost is the preacher and he has many vessels he has many sons hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah call Ariza moment somebody I was speaking about over this morning I said he said when when gone ready to fire you in six months people can forget you him because God's program is real woody moment a minister gets two big faces shoes God already have a rapidly thicket somebody waits in there he's a provider hallelujah hallelujah that's why Paul said you have to walk worthy of your vocation because the moment you drop from the world units of your vocation gonna have somebody else right there hallelujah hallelujah chorus' a little replacement businesses in a restoration business we know that but you must walk worthy of your vocation you can walk how you want dress how you want live how you want act how you want we are happy to be prisoners of the Lord if Paul can be a prisoner I'm happy to be a prisoner of the Lord and worship and awake all heresy you may be seated a prisoner of the Lord whether she because I'm a prisoner of the Lord I'm compelled to pray in this prison prayer is a requirement and we don't we don't treat it like we're forced to do it we pray because now it has become we have become slaves of love you know prisoners of love you know when God say worship is not like a for stewardship we don't have we have because we have been incarcerated by love we want to worship because we have been incarcerated by love we don't want to go out party no more we don't want to gossip no more we don't want a black light no more we don't want to have jealousy no more this prison we are in in this prison jealousy can't stay in this prison you can't lock up jealous in this prison jealousy is locked out love is lucky oh god help me this morning in this prison Glossop is locked out and peace and joy and the knife's pressure keeps on the fruits of the spirit that's what luck in this prison I always say you maybe see that Christmas to do two things you know it's a chance to be here people who couldn't leave and instead keep certain people from people who would trouble by certain people but he end result is this if you go in there and you abide by the rules you'll be healed you're supposed to be different your walk supposed to be different your talk supposed to be different Paul wasn't always that way when he was all he wasn't that way when he was when he thought he was doing right he was going any letter of the law and saying I don't understand these these people who talk about this Christ this Jesus Christ thing and he said the persecuted brothers he was there feeling good about himself when when Stephen E Deacon was stoned isn't that right but when Cora's ready to arrest him somebody say arrest me this morning when go arrest Paul on the road to Damascus at work and then pours had a talk a different talk you know yeah my prisoner but I'm not upset to be a prisoner I'm happy to be a prisoner I enjoy being a prisoner I worship as a prisoner and you know what because something chained to the inside when God loosed him and his job lucemon is hope lucemon as we in neighborhood you know what he behaves the same way come to church shame him [Music] [Applause] I'm almost wrapping up here now in the message to conflict between God and Satan but the parent said the true bride must be your night unified by the word that's where I got the tiger from unified by the word there's been many kind of unity and unification and movements and and if you're not in you're out and if you're not here you do but it's by the wood now remember if she's a part of Christ she has to be the word of Christ in order to be the word of Christ you have to be baptized into place and when you're in Christ you believe Christ and Christ is the word can the church same the bride must be you fight unified together by his word my sheep hear my voice and this is his voice unprinted would all right unified by the word she makes herself ready not with the regular Creed so we wanna be ready by the Word of God like Esther when Esther was to be chosen to stand before the king she didn't adorn herself with all the things that it offered her she are doing herself with a sweetmeat spirit that's what the brides are dawning herself with with all the fruits of the spirit following it what she's got assembling together in the Fellowship of the world and I believe that's what our Convention was assembling together under the fellowship of the wood and quad will have much more like it as we prepare to leave this please can the church say Amen amen so before we get to the tip I have some notes of praises that I want to read and some testimonies from sister Christine I would like to thank God by His grace that I'm alive today I would also like to thank the elders and brothers who prayed for me on Sunday last the medical team and brother Andy during the first service of the convention last week I started experiencing problems to breathe I was then taken downstairs after the pressure test was done to Sedona he told me I would have to lead their own and take a rest which I did I was not aware of what took place with me until I spoke to her the following day apparently while I was asleep my oxygen level kept dropping and since the donor King was sitting there with me was praying for me at the end of the service member dovi was praying he prayed for anyone who had a request in their hearts and has a need and the Lord will bless them now I meet their needs as I was asleep just heard Annika stood in a cup for me and she told me as but over pray the oxygen level went back up to 95 and didn't drop lower hallelujah thank you lord I was able to go back upstairs for the second service and worship and praise the Lord I would like to see special transfer now handy

the reading of the word I've given it a little mem stick there if the brothers can go across to the first page and I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the inspiration pastor the harvest time it is so broad so wide you could take several there's many facets to to this Dimond of the harvest time it's not to lose this time it's not wizz least I'm not the Pentecostal time but this is harvest time may a few words that I will speak be a great inspiration to you is my prayer the scriptures I want to look at today in the what shall I do I'll just raise my hand I guess to go on to the next slide I want to go just in these four scriptures Psalm 27 verse 1 the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear hell man the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid Amen Psalms one two six six goes on to say he that goeth forth and weepeth Amen Bharath precious seed shall doubtless come your shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him man charity can't fail Isaiah 59 19 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall raise lift up a standard against him hallelujah men finally Galatians 6:8 for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting praise be to God let's go to the the picture slide brothers and then we'll pray now gracious God I'm very if you were on it not only to be behind the sacred desk today but also to be seeing my beloved brethren the ministry here Oh God if I were to express my the the depths of my appreciation to each one without exception dear God it would take nearly over time but dear God may they collectively receive my very deep appreciation Lord and love for them for the better we are fighting together for the their arms we are joining together to fight this common enemy Lord this terrible opposition that we are fighting all of us Lord may you bless each Minister present their got those out to minister during this weekend and may we be uplifted enriched blessed and most of all edified and that we may live here stronger saying it was good for us to be here we are asking and give you thanks in Jesus name Amen amen you can be seated bless you richly praise be to God and I wanted to bring a little thought today which ties in obviously with the harvest time inspiration and I'm calling it seed in the Sun man it sounds good it sounds happy but let's talk about it amen because it is the seed that's in the Sun and brothers you could just go to the next slide pretty much when I turn my papers you can let's start over here a harvest time and I wanted to talk about this great great subject as Noah and Moses and David reflected the coming of this perfect bridegroom so has Russa Pentecost and wisly and Pentecost reflected the coming of a perfect bride isn't that real clear a man as those reflectors reflected G he was a masterpiece so is the bride and identified masterpiece hallelujah and it came on like that and God is depending on you to be cut by the hammer by the chisel he's depending on you to stand there and say Lord cut me Lord shake me Lord take away everything that's not me hallelujah he's depending on you to stand there say Lord I'm already to be cut hallelujah somebody once said we love the surgeon but we don't like the knife we love the surgeon which is the Lord Jesus Christ but we don't like the knife the knife hurts but we give God glory he's chipping chipping chipping chipping everything away that we can become a masterpiece in this end time praise be to God that's why I put the picture of the masterpiece up there let's go let's go next to the next picture brothers and here's something I think is gonna be a blessing to you but now at the end time look at this shucks here notice in the wheat the complete mystery of the life is suit up inside that shock we see it in Luther coming up we see it in tassel coming up we see it in the stalk coming up coming over here now it's in the in the shuck form almost like at the Pentecostal age but the real mystery is hidden inside hallelujah that's where your fighter inside there you can't just rejoice with the shock the shock is just doing a job hallelujah but inside is the mystery that is sealed up I guess that still has to be broken amen for this this mystery to be revealed another Oh kind of platform quotations and the next one can play brothers he says oh brother sister are you catching it we could go cross brothers to the to the next slide Thanks and he says don't you see it's been failed all these ages according to what God said it will be opened in the last day those seven seals would be broke and the full thing would come into view of the people how'd you get for the pool thing yeah the seals have been broken we can see the fool thing we know who we are we know where we come from we know where we're going hallelujah we know our pedigree we know who our Father is we know our history hallelujah the full thing is revealed to the people and we we know the full thing will come into view of the people what took place all along you can be seated hallelujah let's go to something more more deep and even just always so great teaching here brother band said this is a great teaching just I didn't even touch the edge of it but if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the Bible it's seven months after count off those months count them off January February March April May June July he said enemy several months which represents seven church ages my full seven Church ages now some minister might pick that up I love this sub doesn't matter

better of it it's a little stronger hallelujah something a little stronger a man in your heart amen hey by faith and glory to glory instead ripen the grain for the harvest he says each day comes true a little stronger to ripen the grain for the harvest the Sun comes today gets a little stronger see it is a Rising Sun this Sun even though it's the same Sun but it is a Rising Sun hey it is the rising of the Sun something's getting stronger from glory to glory he says he says each day it will get stronger a little stronger - finally amen it's that's laying there it'll go - taking life

Lord zowie eternal life hallelujah that's what it is because the life is in the blood hallelujah it lives in the blood hallelujah each day since the life that's laying there it'll go to taking life any man and so it's not gonna just stay as it was is a man that can turn on the light the Prophet goes on to say here it says after a while the life will come up the things you used to do you do them no more the things that used to interest you they don't interest you anymore you have grown you're taking life you're bolder than you used to be you pray with more power now you are taking a life life is coming in something's changing huh it's not bad Mike it's not my power but by my spirit says the Lord hallelujah glory to God oh I feel so good brother hallelujah maybe the light is coming in not

are you ready the grain should be a little more mature to receive the sunlight it's gonna be more matured the grains gotta be more ripened when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child

hey man glory to God amen amen it says it's gonna be what's it more more matured to receive the sunlight a man when when the seed is green the cattle don't want it nobody you it's useless it's just like got a milk inside it's no use to anybody and even they they the combine will recognize it because the combine is designed for a mature grains the rapture is designed for a mature Christian hallelujah and for a perfect man it's designed for a ripened Christian hallelujah a Pentecostal baby won't go in the combine it will just jam inside there hallelujah be seated momentarily while we move on praise be to God hallelujah so we're moving on now oh I love this quote Luther's manner was the message of justification Grizzly's message was the restoration of the kids sorry Oh what was sanctification Pentecostal was the restoration of the kids but this Tommy shout this is this is the introducing the headstone the last day the bright tree which is contrary to all of it but it's the same light for the mature we've got a mature we can't be into petty politics and an envy and comparing and childishness we've got to ripen we've got to mature hallelujah we can't stay down there we've got to come up there amen hallelujah glory to God he said the same sunshine today amen we'll be rifling the grain for the harvest in July you see what I mean but the light today won't do could anybody back there in July amen Rose now is stronger the real July heat would kill the plant the plant needed time to mature to ripen you can't give it full strength hey man it would kill it July Sun could kill you it could kill you you have to be ripened to receive it you have to be maturing to receive the sunshine because it's very strong praise be to God is stronger see you've got to be ready to take it I said like the same Sun ripening the grain from a harvest he'll remain but the light today won't work it's stronger the wheat is more advanced how many fields more advancement we are more advanced hallelujah we got no more TV evangelism and all this stuff we now want the world we don't want milk we want meat now hallelujah we want the real thing advanced tada amen glory hallelujah amen praise be to God says friends listen we've got to lay in the presence of the the Sun it is presence that's where I belong it is presence that's where I'm strong hallelujah oh my god hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus amen friend we've got to lay in the presence of the Sun we've got to be ripened our faith isn't right my brother people can be in the message is that the church is beginning to hear the message in 1965 beginning to hear the message but the water isn't the faith isn't right intellectually we're hearing the message that God gave us but we've gotta get ripened we've got a mature we've got to do if you've got you right man it's not an option you have to be mature ray hallelujah for this day let's go to an excellent brothers and this is one of my favorites here he says lay out in the presence of the of God with our hearts not just our hands but with our hearts amen did you notice I changed from the Sun to the burning bush because that's the presence that's the real present real in front of him that's his presence that's what's gonna ripen us it ripened Moses and he took off his shoes amen hallelujah until he has he says no other hand so much but our hearts before God until he has seasoned us through and through like that with the Rays of his glory hallelujah thank God for those rays of his glory rays of Appeal the Rays of glory tonight hallelujah rays of his glory glory to God amen and ER and he has baked into us baked into us His goodness and ripened that which we have got into reality not just I'm in the message but he says that we can show others that Jesus lives we can show others hallelujah silver and gold I have none but such as I have I give unto thee you can show others hallelujah that Jesus lives praise be to the name of the Lord amen amen Moses knew it Moses knew everything but he needed the burning bush he needed the word to speak back to him then he saw the reality this is not just like a Sunday School it's a reality this missus is Jesus Christ hallelujah yeah my brother it is Jesus Christ hallelujah this cross over let's let's talk about something now he says now this is the situation here it says notice how more like it's gotta be like the real thing Mary was but like the shock it hugs the see see it's in the way it's hugging the sea it's hugging the seed energy in itself the shock it just wraps around the seed and it protects it Kamisha protects it protects it and it nurtures it until things happening and or if it's behind the shock who can see that can shot a man it will never get right back the shock has got to go it's try to get out the way hallelujah BC now I want this to really go home aim it just on the next one brothers he says little teeny but of grain coming on praise the Lord it's coming on it says there's the real thing it's a mystery inside but if that shock is there then it will never really get the Sun it will never get the strength of a Sun it will always be hiding behind the shock praise be to God he says it's a carrier that's what it is it's a it's a carrier what it has to it has to be there to protect the grain after a certain point it says it's working in harmony it's there to protect the grain so it's hugging it's hugging that grain it's looking after it but it's preventing the Sun that Chuck has to pull away it has to go that grain wants to be breathe to get the full strength of the Sun hallelujah heaven is protecting it what what from from Sun from air from pesticide you know the precision of the spray it's protecting it from what what else from insects from the cold it's protecting it from the outside but that grain it needs to be Oh much I want to say something take a seat take a seat church I was studying a bit of computing a years ago I think it was Microsoft Publisher and they said you can have a certain document that needs to be unprotected until it while it's protected the document you can't do much with it because it's protected how many understands that is I this is IT and but if you want to work with it if you want to take this further you want to work with some of this and some of that you have to unprotect you have to unprotect the document so that it can go further hallelujah and what i want to say today is that the grain needs to be unprotected unprotected it need not no matter if it we wants to stay there it needs to be unprotected it needs to get there with the strength of a sunny even is if there are insects even if they're summer rain even if there's some cold even if there's the elements that sea needs to be unprotected who can shut him into that hallelujah and protected hallelujah I wonder who would be brave enough to say Lord and protect me I want full strength when brother overt is rebuking demons Lord and protect me you can't protect demons you've got it you've got it you've got to be running for your life pastor thank you lord and protect me you can't run from this a man you can't run away from this let me ask you a question just now let me ask you a question just after this next slide you can be seated okay I'm going somewhere amen he said the seed can't even get right or ripe right or ripe until the shuck stalk leaves or dry it saps every bit of life out of them all it was is that plus character he says now it's seed time right time the shuck saute not touched the seed doesn't need somebody to say come on let's raise those hands and praise the Lord the seed wants to do it anyway it's a virgin word time hallelujah glory to God amen virgin world doesn't have to be manhandled he loves the Lord hey man he

take a seat Brahma tyranny it's a prince that you all said the presence of God then why did why did Jonah run from it that's a good one the presence of God is what why did Jonah run for his life

asleep however I'm gonna enjoy this one oh I'm gonna enjoy this one hallelujah Amen hallelujah amen why did Jonah run oh brother Peter the presence is wonderful why did you run because the presence

harder trials amen you can go have a brother I'll just stay here a man even Jesus amen the parents forgotten they forgot him they did I thought he was following but he went back to the temple and
