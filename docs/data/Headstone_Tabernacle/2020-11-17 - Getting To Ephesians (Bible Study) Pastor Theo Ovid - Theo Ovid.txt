insight wisdom understanding and knowledge how to behave ourselves and conduct ourselves in this present time you're living in knowing that adoption and pleasing is based upon behavior granted lord and jesus may ask it email him and god bless you and welcome to our bible study tonight we are so appreciative of all of you being here tonight and i want to share testimony with you this is from our brother kelly salt from the usa he said dear brother i would like to report that the lord has graciously healed me of a long time affliction since about 2009 i've had in my upper right jaw what felt like a sharp to take i've had to stay on pain relievers all day in order to work efficiently otherwise the pain would eventually bring tears to my eyes if i failed to take the pain relievers at night the pain would wake me up i had a root canal surgery two extractions second root canal in an effort to find relief from the pain all to no avail i do not recall exactly when the pain stopped but about two weeks ago or so i have forgotten to take my usual dose of pain relievers when i suddenly realized the pain was not there despite not having taken any medicine nor has it come back since i read this morning in the bible where the disciples had asked the lord jesus if a certain man was blind because of his or her his parents sin the lord answered that it was not because of his or his parents sin but at the works of god should we mean manifesting him i have to believe that my pain has existed these 10 years or so for the same reason that the works of god would be made manifest may god wish to bless you but i can't you certainly appreciate that testimony give god some praises god is a healer and uh it have what you call time of span miracles uh they have instant miracles but then you have the miracles that god works out in time and um it reminds me of the lepers uh when jesus said said go and show yourself to the priests and he didn't pray for them you just squander his life to the priest and along the way they will find themselves healed and this testimony here is very encouraging because it tells you never give up half feet in god trust the lord and god will work all things out for his honor and face glory you love him tonight or praise the lord so tonight that forced my lord to share something with you tonight and i i want to ephesians is still building on me uh ephesians to me is the target is the goal is where you want to get to so i want to title this get into ephesians get in to ephesians and we want to get to ephesians through corinthians hebrews galatians romans philippians colossians and then ephesians i choose these different churches if i could use that word reflecting different behaviors and attitudes different stages of your even your christian walk and you could see how god aim is perfection and the bible says when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part is done with it you know the people that was called by god the grouping that was called was the jews hebrews the jews and they were called by god and because the price wasn't paid yet or the sacrifice was made yet for sin the law was like a temporary uh place marko markow placeholder until the perfect sacrifice came and the price was paid at calvary so when israel came out of egypt and go tell them bring them to my mountain is because they had no clue what this god is about so god brought the law as a school master as a school teacher to keep them and the law exposed their sin and ways and misbehaving ways and everything else but christ was to come to pay the price and then their rejection of jesus brought an opening for us gentiles that is why we're here tonight because their rejection of christ open up a door that the gospel could go to the gentiles and here we are now we know there are seven churches i'm not trying to uh pluck this as seven churches as such i'm just trying to take a journey that the target and the goal is perfection now because we have come to christianity which is like luther and wesley and and pentecostals and different denominations it is sometimes so difficult to get people away from seeing church and see the prophetic vision that god has released by the open of the seven seals to see that vision of perfection and it is not a group it is not a building it is not a certain type of people then but is really coming back to the faith that was once delivered to these things because when god called abraham the the seed of abraham the real seed of abraham was his faith seed so this thing called faith is what started in genesis with that man called abraham because that same fate is what man fell from that sixth sense of faith and if you notice that is the the the current that flows through the scriptures is this fate of god now you might hear me of time uh preaching sermons and stuff and says that fate is god's currency if you go to mexico it's pesos if you go to america's u.s dollar you go to a french france french franc you cannot take your money and and spend it across in these countries you have to convert it and in the in the country of heaven or in the kingdom of god the currency's fate is not how long you're going to church it's not how old you are in the lord it's the currency of feet it's not uh somebody backslidden and how god blessed them like that his feet and if you notice jesus wasn't in the religious beat that so many people are in jesus never asks how long somebody in sin how long a backslide or this and that has really been made perfect will you be made whole uh do you want to be healed and so on and he just healing is sick anybody who are fit to believe the woman with the blood issue was not baptized believer was not a church-going person but the point about did she believe that she told herself if i could just touch him of his garment i'll be made whole so i want you to take and understand that regardless of what you're going through whether suffering pain uh better sickness challenges whatever you're going through faith still is the currency that that that get things from god this currency of faith and faith come by here in the world so as we share the word tonight i trust that your faith anger in your word because this is what the prophet came to reveal the very word of god so if you have your bibles i'd like to turn to first corinthians and chapter two i want to read from verse one first corinthians chapter two to get your bible we invite right tonight see how the lord will do what the lord will do uh with this get into ephesians and paul was saying he came not with excellency of speech because these were some tough churches it was a rough church this was a carnal church a natural church and you notice that in some of these epistles that paul wrote at the beginning he keep identifying his authority he's calling he's meeting the law pillar of fire and so on because these people not easy to deal with it wasn't just receiving you just like that and paul was explaining here how his approach was how he came to them not with accidental speech of wisdom he claimed the testimony of god by determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified was three and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling this is something you don't see much of you see people without fear you see people arrogant you see people i don't want ministers no pastors uh so on carrying on but paul was saying that he was with you in weakness in fear and trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power and the purpose of that was that your fate should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god so paul was saying this demonstration of the spirit this demonstration of power would activate people's faith in god that is the object of the gospel not faith in a man but faith in god now hope and i'll skip down you know now verse 11 he said for what man know the things of a man receive the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of god knew it no man but the spirit of god for we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god and we might that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teach it but which the holy ghost teach it comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receive it not the things of the spirit of god for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually deserved but he has a spiritual judge at all things yet he himself is judge of no man for who had known the mind of the lord that we may struck him but we have the man of christ so paul was shown here that it take the spirit of god to reveal and to share and to show the things of god because these things are spiritually deserved but remember you're not a one-fold being you're three four being you have a body you have a spiritual soul that spirit in you is feeding on something you come in this room tonight because there is something in you calling for vitamins for strength for gospels as we call it for the word and and as you get the word now you get strengthened in your inner man just as you need natural food you need your breakfast your lunch and dinner to strengthen your natural man you need spiritual food to strengthen your inner man so then this is not just uh philosophizing or philosophy or vain philosophy but this is the word of life the word of truth but the devil's job is to make people feel that this world doesn't have power that we're just talking and just it's just but this is the will of the lord this is actually the word of the lord so let's go to chapter three of the same thing and he said i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as something he was under bids in christ i have fed you with milk and not with meat hitter two you were not able to bear it neither yet no i evil so this bunch this group this church this corinthian church was a spiritual base so paul couldn't bring meat to them call paul couldn't bring mysteries to them he couldn't bring solid stuff to them and it tells you as where we start from we start as babes we start struggling we start you know but you can't stay babe you have to go when somebody have a baby the baby doesn't stay baby all the time baby drinking milk but the baby have to grow and what it tells you that you have to grow and i hope that tonight in reading and sharing that you will be able to look at your own life and ask yourself where are you at what church are you in are you in a corinthians church a roman church a galatians church a hebrew church what church are you in what church you want to belong to i'm not talking about a physical building i'm not talking about a physical group i'm talking about in spirit they said well you are colonel and foreigners there is among you yeah yeah yeah what is your kind of envying and strife and divisions are are not carnal and work as men for while one say it i am of paul another i'm of apollos so then you see what was happening here the believers the people was picking and choosing like it was a a handsome contest or a good-looking contest or a better preaching contest or whatever it is and they were saying i am our paul that's when i'm apollos everybody picking who they like he said who then is poor who is apollos but ministers by whom you believe even as the lord give to every man i have planted apollos water but god give it to increase give the increase so there is neither he that planted anything neither he that water it but is god that give it the increase now he had planted and he had watered a one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his labor so paul was presenting himself as a servant of christ in a particular position of a saw one that saw and won that water a polish water he was showing that his office didn't need any high rank or position to say i am of a paul and our apollos no he was showing the calling of god and how it works in harmony one soul one water what is god that give it the increase so he was not pointing people to himself he explained that before his preaching is to point them to the power of god that they can have more faith in god because you see when you begin to see god operating in your life or around your life your faith begins to grow because faith doesn't only come by hearing the word faith also come by experience so when you begin to experience the operation of god around you and in your life your faith in god begins to grow and it becomes stronger and you become a stronger christian because you get an anchor that he is alive he is not dead he is active in your life in your natural life he has protect you he has kept you he opened doors for you he make a way for you when you're not looking for this you open that to you and you're blessed and when you begin to see that you wake up next morning with a confidence that god has with you yesterday he's the god today and he's be god for you tomorrow so even though things crash today your expectation and faith is in him that will be there for you the next day so i want you to share with you verse chapter five you think of the time five verse one this is paul this is church now paul chapter five verse one you see it is reported commonly that is fornication among you such fornication as is not even named among the gentiles so israel's slackness that one should have his father's wife and ye are puffed up i have not rather moaned and he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you for i verily i'm absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as do i were present concerning him that has sowed on this deed in the name of our lord jesus christ when you are gathered together by my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ you deliver such a war unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit might be saved in the day of the lord jesus your glory is not good know ye not at a little level level of the whole lamp so the church the corinthian church had worked on a sexual sins organized things of the flesh and paul harris to deal with that so i start off with this church on our way to ephesians because this church represents the bottom of the barrel where church behavior and life is concerned first corinthians chapter 6 if you have a bible flip to chapter 6 and listen to verse 9 and we're going to read on 1911 of chapter 6 he says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceive neither fornicators nor either letters no adulterers no effeminate which is homosexuals no abusers of themselves with mankind no thieves no covetous no drunkards no revilers no extortions shall inherit the kingdom of god but such will some of you were some of you but he are washed and he are sanctified but he had justified in the name of the lord jesus by the spirit of our god and we go to chapter 10 now so he was telling them and identifying all this behavior that can't inherit no kingdom of god that not going into kingdom of god that is what how you was you don't want to be like that now you want to see a change or change life a change talk change world and this particular chapter is one that always moved me this chapter 10. moreover brethren i would not have you ignorant this one or that our fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea verse two all baptized into the moses in the clouds and see first three all eat of the same spirit in me who is four all drink of the same spiritual drink first five and with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lost after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolaters as some of them as is written the people sat down to eat and drink and lose up the plane they then let us commit fornication as somebody committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and would destroy of siblings neither mummy as some of them also remembered i were destroyed of a destroyer now all these things here we go happen unto them for examples and they are written for our admonisher they are written for what our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore that him the thinkity standard take heed less e4 so i'll share my wife you know and we always talk about it how people live in this world with a sense of permanence and deceived permanence like if they're here forever like they will always will be here and you know it is so troubling to especially christians to see christians in arrogance and in pride and like they want to cut this one off and treat this one this way and that way and they don't hold time in their hands you don't hold time he hold you in his hands you are kept by him holding you not you holding yourself he holding you if he pulls his hands off we fall so to me it it is something when you begin to weigh your own life then and you walk in a way where you know you're grateful and you are thankful every day lord i thank you i thank you for your love i thank you for your grace your mercy it's just the grace of god it's the mercies of god so you have to study all these things happen for example we have been admonished to take heed because man is still money from genesis monster lustin man is the lion man still doing evil that man is not unless god the holy spirit change a man's heart is he saying man the man walking in longer man walking on on camel and whatever he say man he's just driving a car now he's just flying planes now he's just wearing jacket and taino but it is his sea man okay let's go to hebrews chapter five so we just jump in we leave from corinthians we're going to hebrews and we want to read verse 8 of hebrews after fact speaking about jesus do he was a son so sonship doesn't mean you're immune from stuff you can't claim like um how a lot of people do when they figure out how to say it is their right uh like if you know they they they they're being owed something they say right he said though he were a son yet learning obedience by the things that he suffered this year it could be a whole message on this scripture this line here though he was son he learned he obedience by the thing we suffer that means we are not born obedient we're not obedient because of the name that we carry or the height color complexion or where we live we learn obedience obedience is something is how much of us are me included get burned by not following the instructions and the guidance that god gave and sometimes god put something in your spirit and you know god wants you to move a certain way but you are you are you too you have your own will and you you let down your god and you move by your own thinking and thoughts and it just not work out it ended up a big flop all because you didn't walk in that obedience to god's will but jesus learned obedience by thinking he suffered verse nine and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him call of god and high priests after the order of melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and how to be uttered seeing you at dull of hearing for when there's a part i want to get to this is paul addressing the hebrew church for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and i become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a babe so paul is continuing on like a line from the corinthians to the hebrews and he said for everyone that used that milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a versus 14 but strong meat belonging to them that of foliage even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil this ties into proverbs though to have discernment to have discretion that ties into the book of proverbs advertiser was speaking about strong meat out of them that of a full age so what he's talking to is coming into maturity milk is for babies strong meat is for those that are mature we are not born mature we grow into maturity amen we are not born mature we grow in god okay so therefore the church the church folks who want to remain dependent simple ignorant but have no growth he's like a stunted person it's like a spiritual then when you expect somebody to be five feet something and growing taller there's somewhere only three feet line that's how there was 20 years ago and now they are now that can't be your story you have to grow you have to grow one you have to press amen and chapter six we continue the same uh it says here therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on to perfection not lean again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards god of the doctrine of baptism and laying on the hands and resurrection of the dead of eternal judgment and this we will do if god commit so hebrews here always saying listen man you all supposed to be teachers you're supposed to be sharing instead of being babes taking milk looking for encouragement you're supposed to be encouraging others what is this telling you that god wants us to go like hold in john it says i write unto you children i write unto you young men i write unto you fathers that is the objective of god to get you into a position to be father to be mature to be ready to be right to be a son pleased to be adopted so let's go on now the galatians galatians i'm going to go to galatians chapter one wow and paul speaking here paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ he keep identifying his position there's four he said who gave himself our sins the home of jesus and that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and our father to whom be glory forever and ever amen so paul is glorifying god and then paul says this year i marvel yeah so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ onto another god i hope paul jammed the galatian church in chapter 1 verse 6. now the amplified of that says i am surprised and astonished that you are so quickly turning renegade and deserting him who invited and called you by the grace unmerited favor of christ the messiah and that you are transferring your allegiance to a different even opposition gospel no which is not another but there be some that trouble you that would pervert the gospel of christ it's a verse 7 and the amplified it says not that there is or could be any other genuine gospel but there are obviously some who are troubling and disturbing and bewildering you with a different kind of a teaching which they offer as a gospel i want to pervert and distort the gospel of christ the messiah into something which is absolutely not now remember the gospels passed out with the jews it's styled with jews these people was was following the torah was following moses following the law they were killed in lamb they had rituals they was eaten bred they was doing certain things this was their law so therefore when the gentiles began to come in some of these jews were trying to influence these gentiles to come and line up with these things of the law this is what this was all about so the church was in group mode here the church was in stages here step by step and we go to our own legal thing our own legal period or legal time and so on like that let's continue here but verse 8 but paul but do we which include himself or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse as we said before so said i know again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received let them be a curse verse 11 for i certify you brethren this is paul that the gospel which was preached of me is not of man after man for i received it of of a man i neither receive it of a man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ but paul was saying clearly this revelation i'm bringing to you is from heaven it's on god it's from jesus christ this is the word amen so chapter 2 let's go on then 14 years after i went up to jerusalem with barnabas took titus with me and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation at least by any means i should run or run in vain and he said but neither titus was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised he didn't force titus to be circumcised titus was greek was four and that because of false brethren brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage listen to that verse 4 in the amplified my precaution was because of false brethren who had been secretly smuggled into the christian brotherhood they had slipped in to spy on our liberty and the freedom which we have in christ jesus that they might again bring us into bondage under the law of moses and there are people who love the law i'm not talking about moses law and that is why they are attracted to legalistic pastors and ministers and prophets and preachers because they have no internal discipline they like people externally to discipline them so the more rough the man is the more they like him the more he blasts the more they love them because they want somebody to beat them into shape they don't want and you see this is what the lord does externally though don't shut that door a law a law just the law but what god wants is this thing written in your heart that you have an internal law an internal governance an internal operation of the spirit where you are not con you know i guys tell young people if if um you know if if um if you don't get discipline in your house life will cut your tail life will put blows on you your mother beats you your father meet you you get spared you escape a certainty of your own way but eventually it will pick up at you because life is about discipline and order god is about discipline and order we must come into discipline amen so he says so so so um so paul was saying in verse 5 to whom we give place by subjection no not for our that the truth of the gospel might continue in you so there were people who came in that wanted to bring them back into the law into bondage again verse 11 but when peter was come to antioch i would stood him to the face because he was to be blamed for before certain and he talked about peter and his behavior and so on and then he rebuked peter when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel verse 14 i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew live us after the man of the gentiles and not as do the jews why compel us though the gentiles delivered through the jews we who are jews by nature are not sinners of the gentiles and then paul went down deep in the word they say know in verse 16 that a man is not justified by the works of the law in other words being circumcised doing all them rituals you know all them drama and so on that doesn't justify him he said but by faith of christ jesus jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ are we i'd be justified by the faith of christ and not by the books of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified but if we're 17 while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves are from sinners is therefore christ a minister of sin god forbid so you can't claim to be justified even living in sin that makes no sense the justification means that you have been released from guilt released from your past release on your sins you're free to live your life but you are justified but if i build again the things which i destroy i make myself a transgression for i true the law i'm dead to the law that i may live unto god then paul said this marvelous word here and this is something that you should repeat and and and remember and store in your heart and mind i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ live it in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the fate of the son of god who love me and give himself for me i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead then chapter three let's continue verse one o foolish galatians now i want you to see the magnitude of this being a church being believers and see how it could be foolish believers foolish christians all foolish quick the galatians who would be with you that you should not will be the truth before whose eyes jesus christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would i learn of you receiving the spirit by the law of the works of the law or by hearing of it now these are people that actually had experience of the spirit of god and he's asking them the spirit you receive how you get it was it by the works of the law or by hearing your feet are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are you know made perfect by the flesh now this is real this is people who are going backwards they start in the spirit and instead of staying in the spirit and sitting on the grace and going in revelation they start to go backwards they start to go backwards towards the works of the flesh he said have you suffered so many things in vain if yet to be in vain he therefore that ministered to you the spirit and look at miracles among you do it he by the works of the law or by hearing of faith even as abraham believed god and was a conqueror to him for righteousness we are getting to ephesians let's go to romans book of romans let's continue so the book of romans we want to look at chapter 3 and we want to work look at verse 9 we'll start from verse 9 of the book of romans chapter 3 verse 9 what then are they better than thee are we better than thee he's talking about jews are we jews better than these gentiles are we better no in no wise for we have before proof both jews and gentiles that they are all under sin so it's not as if the jews could claim we are the righteous people we are god's people we are fine no they were not they were sinners and the law exposes him for behavior that's why the law was saying those are not adultery or shall not lost to make a wise labor's goods though shall not steal those shall not kill because they were sinners diverting law addressed their sin and we as gentiles of course we were unbelievers sinners right now he said verse 10 of of this roman street as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understand it there is none that secret after god they are all gone out of the way they are all together and become unprofitable there is none that do it good no not one their truth is the open sea falcon their tongues they have used the seat the poison of aspects under their lips whose mouth is full of crystal and bitterness their feet are swift as shed blood destruction and misery and their ways the way of peace have they not known there is no fear of god before their eyes now we know that what things so ever the law said it saith them who are under the law that every mouth be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god so this thing about god's chosen people and whatnot this gospel here brought everyone guilty before god verse 20 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin but no the righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of god which is up by fate of christ jesus upon all unto all are upon them that believe there's no difference who is 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god so he was showing clearly that this thing and see that is why god could take a man like saul and bring him to become poor that could that's why god could take you and i rank sinners and whatnot and change our lives and there's no way we could explain how that is even possible i remember my early christian work i said lord why you call me how you call me what on earth did you see in me because i wasn't serious than me whatever god was seeing i just wasn't seeing because i was a troublemaker before i'm saying that so so when you see that you could see how god could justify people and if god justifies someone who are we to condemn what you think about that's why regardless how boxing your family is you can't write them off you can't say they've gone too far you can't say they can't bounce back you are not in charge of that okay verse 24 being justified hallelujah freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god has set forth to be a propagation to faith in his blood to declare the righteousness all this righteousness is not your words this righteousness is right standing with god and only god could declare that on your life let me say it again this righteousness is not you one in a mountain wearing a white robe and you're seeing no sinner and you're in some cave praying and fasting somewhere die not righteousness that is some other thing the righteousness is of faith in christ jesus through his blood i was shared for you and you accept that blood as your redemption as your deliverance as your breakthrough as your cleansing from sin to watch verse 28 therefore we conclude that a man is justified by fate without the deeds of the law is he the god of the jews only is he not also the god of the gentiles ye of the gentiles also seems as one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith do we need void the law to faith god forbid we establish the law and then in chapter four we go on right there what shall we then say that abram or father pertinent to the flesh had found for if abraham would justify by works he yet were off to glory but not before god what saith the scripture abram believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now this tonight don't just think we read the scriptures alone take it to heart this is very important what we're about to read here right now what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness and to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of grace but of debt so if you could work for it then god owe you and you're looking for god to give you a reward well watch this but to him that worketh not but believe it on him that justified the ungodly yes we read right tonight believe it on him that justified the ungodly his fate is counted for righteousness so god count abraham faith currency as righteousness and declare abraham as righteous so when even even lie concerning his wife to be king god stop every woman in that house and say we store until that prophet his wife the king said oh god the man tell me my sister he said he tell you that but i tell you go and restore to that man his wife i'll let him pray for you too that's what we're talking about because god had justified iran by his fate let's continue even verse 6 as david also described the blessings of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness without works saying blessed a day whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin come at this precedence then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that the fate was reckoned to amen for righteousness or was it reckon when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision so he's showing you that this faith that abraham had was confirmed before he was circumcised hallelujah oh glory to god before he get the holy ghost hallelujah you have to have faith oh glory to god that faith is already new you know let me see it in high that faith is immune that is why you receive the word do you understand that tonight do you get that tonight god is not now trying to organize that faith in you you know he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive this word but this word that what you're possessed the seed already listen you take a mango seed the mangoside mangoes and nature you can't see it yet you only see that mango seed you bury that seed and turn your back and walk away come back five years later and you seen a big tree in front of you with mangoes on it but when you had it on the table the mango tree was in there the mangoes was inside of there it had not yet unfolded so the devil is confused because here see the sons of god unfolded he only sees cinnamon but when the lamb dropped the book the lamb took the book to bring us completely into a justified condition that we could be restored sons i want you to see we on our way to ephesians hallelujah oh glory to god this is what it's all about this is the journey we're talking about this is the journey from egypt to the promised land this is a journey from corinthians to ephesians this is a journey from carnal church natural church legalistic church baby church hebrews church to ephesians is a journey beyond you have to want to go you have to want to get to there if you want to stay where you are you can stay where you are well you know but you have to understand the destination is ephesians that's the church you want to get so okay so he received a sign of circumcision it is a seal glory of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet been uncircumcised oh glory to god so if the circumcision types the baptism of the holy ghost abram had a faith and the circumcision called as a seal of the righteousness of faith that he had before he was circumcised that is why but iran says because you are son you are sinned by the holy ghost the holy ghost doesn't make you a son you because you are son you can be reborn or give the lord a shout in the house let me say it again be because you are son you could be reborn because you are son you can be refilled because you are son you can be filled because your son you can be sealed because he's not now calling you he chose you at know that in ephesians it chose you before the foundation of the world according to his good pleasure that is where we heard him down dumpty ephesians all right now watch he received the sign of circumcision the sign design a seal of the righteousness of the faith verse 11 which he had yet been uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also verse 12 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the sacred civil only but who also walk in the steps of that fate or father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise here we go that he should be heir of the world was not to abram or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith but that is how we become ears because his seed was the royal season which was christ and through christ we become heirs of the ut we become heirs we we have an inheritance just think about it now we were lost we were gentiles we were finished and cut off all of a sudden because of the cross we find ourselves having an inheritance oh hallelujah glory hallelujah think about it now think about it you have an inheritance oh my for if they which are of the law of verse 14 be heirs faith is made void you don't need faith just follow the law and the promise made of non-effect because verse 15 the law will get right but where no law is there's no transgression therefore here we go it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed so what's something they won't want to be well all right jesus saying means pastor samaria is sending away these cyprus to get bread you have to meet this woman this woman too less this woman have no idea what her life is about to change that very day she doesn't know because she's not a virgin she come at different time from when he virgin just go so she come in normal time jesus said nothing well he have no bucket he's waiting on her her name is on the book he has the book he is the book he knows her name she doesn't have a clue she's canal she's natural she's in the flesh she's totally clueless she comes to the world you say woman give me someone a drink she said we're supposed to have a conversation he said woman if you know talking to you you laugh before water to drink we we know what happened all of a sudden when he said i need to speak unto you and he and you know what he did he said go call your husband she said i have none she said the one you're living with you have five and the one you're living with is not yours she said perceive that with a profit so she now gets in that channel and we know any messiah coming through these things and she's not religious talk with him he said how many hours come and know it with the true worshipers the freaking damn pharisees and the muslims where the true worshipers worship the father and spirit of the truth they know not what they worship they know worship they vain do they worship me so he said she's a woman this this time coming where there are mechanics and dynamics where all the world will come back together but the sons of god could be able to worship correctly in spirit and truth and mechanical dynamics when jesus finished with that woman she started wrong she run straight whole glory to god she was freed she was so free that she could testify about come see a man that told me all this that woman name on the book life outside looking dark and bleak because of a life of what man should live with this that and that all that negative all of a sudden grace justification calling predestination all that throw into gear one time it's like every buttons are the best predestination grace blood deliverance a destination upper room for all he goes everything the package sealed and you know what she was in your peru where was judas he didn't make the upper room he hung himself he makes it clean but that was a seed of god who are you tonight a seed of god what's your past to hell they passed you all kind of stuff but guess what you're gonna make it because why your name is on the book do you believe that you have to believe that if you don't believe that you're in real trouble because all that dwell in the uh worship the peace except this whole name so you have to believe your name is written and these seven seals the open book come to reveal your name your name for this hour is placed in a certain position and that position is in ephesians where every gift of the fight is placed your position in the corinthians because gordon coined for corinthians church that church another perfect church he comes a church a school of affection that perfection treats the divisions that is why we have to go back another episode that way that is why we have to go back to the faith of the fathers i don't like a preacher tonight we want to preach let me skip that verse 20 of the same chapter he staggered not that the promise of god true on belief but was strong in faith giving glory to god this year is a whole big message right here because people don't want to talk about it coming they find it too futuristic but here we talking future future future future you see it here no no no is that here no at all if i had it he was gonna know it i am saying this is the promise of god and i'm not staggering nobody can miss taga nobody make it i have it already i have it i have it potentially i don't know potential i want your relative i don't know seeds i want to pick mango from mango tree i don't want to say god everything inside you see no i want to see the seed bury die out grow out until i could pick mango eat mango eat mango and so on make mango juice have i given to you this is what we want this is the scripture and listen voice to anyone i'm being fully persuaded that's all we are tonight that what he promised he was able to perform and i believe in all my heart if brother branham was the wave chief and god waved him and put him as a sign you have other sons coming the devil is a liar he cannot cancel any other son other sons committed maturity other sons coming the journey from corinthians straight to ephesians oh hallelujah praise god to go bypass all the mother churches and come straight to ephesians but that is the destination being fully persuaded that what he promised he was able to form and therefore it was imputed him for righteousness oh my chapter five one was done here of this chapter here therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god to our lord jesus christ before you get in peace in justified by faith you have peace let me say it again or your peace being justified by faith that means you are credited to be righteous by your faith in christ jesus oh hallelujah oh not by the law but by the righteousness wishes of faith my god by whom also we have access by faith into this grace where we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god oh hallelujah you see this truth this same faith you have access to grace that's why you should never stop praying for your loved ones you should never stop praying for your family you should always believe god will deliver them so that completes uh romans let's go to philippians right now chapter two oh my so philippians i love the book of philippians two books i love a lot in the book of philippians and book of russians they like sisters or cousins to the book of ephesians and that's why i placed them there our philippians and then we go to colossians and then we're going to strike ephesians oh praise the lord so trust tonight that this help you in some way and identify somebody but chapter two uh paul was talking about behavior and attitude in chapter two if there be any translation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any borrowers of mercy fulfilling my joy that you'll be like-minded having the same love being of one accord and one mind so this is not baccanal now this is not canaratino this is getting into the greater the matter of christian behavior life and behavior and so like that let nothing be done to strife of vainglory but in loneliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves can you do that can you esteem somebody hard on you or you must be the center of everything you gotta look at that you have to look at it there are some people who are so self-centered that they have to be immune they have to be in front they have to be ahead they have to be uh do it first you just have to be the center of attraction the life of the party however they want to see it but here is paul singing don't do anything for strife of vainglory you're looking for a fight some people like fight just looking for a quarry looking for argument i'll call this brother because we don't get along so good hey and you're looking for a fight no that cannot be the beat because you're heading for ephesians that had to be filtered out so let nothing be done to strife or be in glory but in loneliness of mine that each esteem be automated by themselves watch look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others and and reading the scripture i remember paul i think in one of the epistles he was talking about if i die you know you know i am i'm fine but i stay here for your glory to help you so so is christianity he knew if he died he go on to be with the lord but it's better he'd be wrong to help the church grow every church mature his life had a greater sense of purpose here on earth than being taken into glory so don't try to escape and you want to go oh hallelujah i'm not with the glory you want to go glory we're doing on earth oh jesus come for me coming what you do say boy ain't doing nothing you better stay on it and get something done because you see a car do anything up there for down here here is where you have to make the record here's where you have to testify here's where you have the wind souls here is where you have to witness here's where i encourage people this is the place to do it this is design now all right let's continue now verse 4 look not every man on his own things but every man also thinks of others now this is a tall order here but this is christianity and it's work christianity is lyrics for others you're looking after your brother you're looking out for his sister because in the depth of the word to love god really is to love his people because how you could love god you can't see and the people in front of your face you have fight with them problems and they're making the images like this of god so god say you love me love my people jesus went and washed your feet how many fingers say you see what i do here do it to one another the first piece i didn't want but he said this is what i want to show you the gentiles they have this power crazy stuff and authority over others and so on he said i don't want you like that let him that is greatest among you let him serve that word sir as a problematic word that's why you hear me see that the gospel is not for ministers to be on some some throne somewhere the idea to serve they are there to serve for the for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the bodies the spirit it's an attitude it's something that god put there um for the building up of the body of christ and if you look closely you would see that the burden of god has always been about his people that's why he sent prophets that's why he said apostles is all about god's people if they reject this one he's in another one he's in another one he said no no it's not the money and you know the channel is to get the word for the people so let's see okay so this was one of the great uh uh uh chapters here in this book of philippians who paul really expressed uh uh god in this form of becoming man in such a beautiful way he said look not and every man was four on on his own things but every man also names of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus and here we go who who being the form of god taught it not robbery to be equal with god one made himself no reputation two took upon him the former servant tree was made in the likeness of man and being found in the fashion of man he humbled himself so this is god almighty this is greatness truly expressed in humility let me say that again this scripture here being found in fashion as a man this is god has guided himself now he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross so jesus didn't take the approach i am god and i will do this and i grew that don't touch me no no i wasn't approached he was like a dumb he went down he said nothing they led him to the cross he died he was finished and as far as jesus concerned drama knows that because when he died at calvary he released the anointing that we could have this meeting tonight that is what that was about you released the anointing that in your sinful week on just that he wanted to well you have no clue your name on the book you have no clue your god predestinated you to be a christian and to receive the lord and here it is your heart has been turned think about it for you to be here tonight your heart had to be turned turn to god oh hallelujah turn in your heart because my heart wicked them desperately with them goddaddy and you are i had to watch him a new spirit and god had to release a spirit upon you and before he could give you the holy spirit he just sent anointing upon you to anoint you to get you to feel what the holy spirit is like and he said he with you but he's going to be in you amen being fonder is that the fashion is a man he humble himself you can be into debt get to the cross wherefore god has highly exalted him and give him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee shall bow heaven and eat and so every time can confess amen he said wherefore my beloved verse 12 as he have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with your trip let me read the scripture again way for my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only you know some people only be their self and somebody else are wrong some else are wrong something around they pass around they behave nice and so on when that apple's not there they just go their own way paul is saying he know they obey not only his presence but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and troubling for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do his good pleasure do all things without murmurings and disputes let me read that again do all things without murmurings and disputants why was 15 that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom we shine as lights in the world verse 16 holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labor in vain ye if i be offered upon the sacrifice or service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all let's go to chapter 3 verse 12 of the same philippians this is paul there's one the favorites the one we know not as though i had already attained either were already perfect suppose not that i'm perfect but i follow after if i might apprehend for which also i'm apprehended of christ jesus brethren was the thing i can't not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do for getting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press towards the mark of the price of the high calling of god in christ in christ jesus remember you heard me say before that the chord is at the bottom there's room for you at the top if you are prepared to press the noisemakers at the bottom troublemakers and the person crucify him is at the bottom liars fornicators backsliders and people carrying on without all kind of they have the it's crowded down there and but it's actually something to me is very interesting he said you know sometimes mediocre mediocre is so normal it doesn't even take much to get above the noise of the crowd because mediocrity is is so normal that when somebody excel is oh look at that but i'm saying we are not called to be mediocre we are not called to be ordinary we are called to recognize that we are have a high calling this calling my friends is in ephesians this calling is right then ephesians a high calling and there's a mark to present what is troubling sometimes is that people uh don't have a mark you know like it is said if you don't have a date with a goal that goal is like you're not serious about your goals if you have a goal you'll have a date i want to achieve this by this time the date gives a timeline with by which to accomplish that and you have to be able to plot how you're going to get from where you are to where you want to be in that timeline we also have a timeline it's an invisible timeline the time that god gives us like about time they're born a time to die there's a timeline and in that timeline we have things to accomplish we have things to do some of us do it some of us don't but we also have that invisible timeline we don't know when that time is going to be when that time is finished see but i'm saying there's room at the top paul said i press they don't know group president there's nothing we press towards the map it doesn't have that i press is the individual out of all of this we still hone in on the individual that would make a decision to press when paul talked about the fruits of these spiritual joy love peace that is and put away the old man that is deliberating it's not automatically or automatically the fruits automatically no no no there is something that you have to do to say you know what i don't want that i want this it is intentional it is you determining to walk a certain way one time he said put you on the lord jesus christ and put away the old man put it away and like the bible said when i was a child i speak as a child i understood like a child and so on but when i became a man i put away childish things no angel coming with a big hoes who's not really challenging what you shh two angel coming to do it for you you have to put that away same as the land was given to them but they had to fight and cut down that land my lord my lord okay let's go to chapter four of that same oh i'll slam down here and paul give this exaltation here rejoice in the lord always and i say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer through sex and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be known under god and here we go the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and mind to christ jesus he didn't say frustration depression fed up i can't take it no more this is my last time no and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds to christ jesus then the blessing come finally brethren whatsoever things are true not lies whatever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things he didn't say baccanal he didn't say lies he didn't say bad report he didn't say negative look this was disclosing and verse nine those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the court of peace shall be in you now we go to colossians we're almost there we're heading down to ephesians book of colossians chapter 1 and paul are praying in verse nine of chapter one he said for this course colossians we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding so now you see that colossians is solid stuff that paul is presenting to this christian policy he said verse 10 that you might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god eleven strengthen with all might according to his glorious power under all patience and long suffering and joyfulness giving thanks unto the father which had made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the sins and light who had delivered us hallelujah from the power of darkness and has translated us you see the level he's talking here in this church this is a higher level again has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god he's just glorifying jesus glorifying god who is the image of the invisible god the first born of every creature for by him were all things created that in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether there be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him with 17 and he is before all things and by him all things consists and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him he reconciled all things unto himself by him i see whether there be things in it things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet know how to reconcile in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreportable in sight so solid people getting if verse 23 you continue in the fate grounded and settled and peanut move away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven wherever i paul i made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body's sake and way of i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which had been hit from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we mean that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus wherefore i also leave as private according to his working which worked in me mightily and let's go on to chapter two and he said you know for i would that he knew that great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for many i have not seen my flesh facing facing the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love into all riches of his full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god so he's going deeper in whom the street are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge now let's compare that to the corinthians church where he said like bates hebrews like babes they can't they can't take meat give them milk is talking about treasures knowledge wisdom and this was for at least any man should be guide you with enticing words for do i be absent in the flesh yet i am with you in the spirit joy in behold in your order so this is a quality church colossians as you have received christ jesus the lord to walk in him rooted and built up in him established in defeat as you have been taught abounding their own returns given beware caution beware at least any man spoil you through philosophy and vein deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world not after christ for him dwelleth the fullness of the godhead bodily and you are completing him which is a head of all principality and power in whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands so this is paul fleshing it out now concerning the realm of the spirit circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ buried with him in baptism wherein you are risen with him through the fate of the operation of god what raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and this uncircumcision of your flesh had he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blurting out the unwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing to the cross and having spoiled principalities and powers he made sure of them openly transferring over them verse 16 let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or inspect in holiday or new moon or sabbaties which are shadow of things to come but the body is of christ let no man so paul wasn't just exhorting them on the word and exalting them in mysteries or revelations and so on he was giving them warnings that no man the value of reward and voluntary humility worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he had not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind and not holding the head verse 19 from which all the body by joints and bands of nourishment ministered and knit together increase it with the increase of god she's comparing christ's body as a physical body that have to be lit together therefore wherefore if you be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in this world are you subject to ordinances touch not taste not handle it which we all perish with using after the commandments of doctrines of men which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship and humility and neglecting of the body not an honor into the size fan of the flesh but chapter three this we're going to wrap up here if you be risen with christ seek those things which are above so you sing a different action word not you're in christ and you're a christian and they go to church you don't have to seek nothing you believe the message you believe a prophet no if you be risen with christ seek those things which above where christ sitted on the writing of god verse 2 set your affections on things above not on things that the earth the car will perish the roof will rotten your wish will get rusty this will happen this will break down you gotta fix your bathroom you gotta fix this you have to fix that things will always go that way set your affections and things above do what you have to do but you want to set your affections on things above okay for you are dead and your life is hidden in christ which is in god then he said you know watch verse 8. now putty also put off all these things anger put it off don't say a christian put off anger blasphemy filthy communications out of your mouth lie not one to another senior put off the old man with his deeds and put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him verse 11 and there is neither jew greek nor jew circumcision or uncircumcision barbarian skinny and bundle free but christ is all and all put on there for verse 12 as the elect of god put it on so this is not just uh you know it would just work out he said put it on as elect of god holy and beloved what to put on boards of mercies kindness homelessness of mind meekness long suffering this is living christianity there's not somebody screaming and shouting and in church i'm playing in spain on sunday and by monday there's like a devil inside the house this is not that watch put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved verse 12 bows of mercies kindness harmonies of mind meekness long suffering for bearing one another forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any he must christ forgive you so also do he above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness oh my i let the peace of god rule in your hearts to which also your call in one body and be thankful i like how it all put together let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord and whatsoever you do verse 17 in deed or in word or indeed do all in the name of the lord jesus christ giving thanks or to god and the father by him wives submit yourselves of doing husbands as is fit to the lord now watch there's not ephesians yet but this is an ephesians husband love your wives be not bitter against them children will be your parents in all things but this is where please unto the lord fathers provoke not your children the anger at least they'll be discouraged and this is where we get to ephesians and we're going to close off the night you love him tonight praise the lord i trust him as this will be a blessing to you it was a real uh highway to the scriptures i guess some of you may not have read the bible so much i'll catch you tonight a long time you read your video sam you read the one voice and stuff but tonight to 1990 pastor is in the house and the pastor gives you a run eh i run in the scriptures and this is the final scripture reading tonight from ephesians chapter one i'm not going to do the whole book just a few quizzes in ephesians 4 we wanted to get here call an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god so this is classic this is the pinnacle of to its life of church uh the church the ideal church the truth that becomes the template or the standard there at church this is it here paul an apostle of jesus christ you could talk this with people by the will of god through the saints which are episodes and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ he bring in he became grace and peace from the lord jesus christ and the church involving amen blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings that doesn't give you forgive me tonight who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in love having predestinated us onto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good players he couldn't share this with the corinthians church he could even start and approach this with the hebrew church relationships forget it then still fight number the law you understand what i'm saying but here it is but this church you could tell that you are predestinated to the abduction of children by jesus
