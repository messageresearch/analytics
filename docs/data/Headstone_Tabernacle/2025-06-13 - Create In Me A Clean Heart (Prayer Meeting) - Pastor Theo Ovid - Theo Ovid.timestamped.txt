[13:54] I am no longer a slave
[13:59] to fear.
[14:02] I am a child
[14:06] of God.
[14:13] Thank you, brother Gideon. God bless you
[14:16] and thank you all for being here
[14:18] tonight. Let us bow heads for word of
[14:20] prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[14:23] for your presence and we thank you for
[14:24] this great opportunity that we could
[14:27] talk to you, we could commune with you.
[14:30] Father, I pray that you would come down
[14:31] in a special way tonight by your word
[14:33] and by your spirit and anoint your
[14:35] people in their homes, Lord. Those need
[14:37] a comfort, those needing a touch, those
[14:39] needing healing, those needing
[14:41] deliverance, breakthrough, whatever
[14:43] might be forgiveness, cleansing. Father
[14:45] God, may you come in a special way and
[14:46] minister to your saints, minister to
[14:48] your people tonight in Jesus name I ask
[14:50] it. Amen and amen. God bless you and
[14:53] welcome. Thanks again for being here.
[14:56] And I would like to share some of you
[14:58] tonight.
[15:00] And I want to take a scripture from
[15:01] Psalms 51. You want to read from verse 1
[15:05] to2. And the title of what I want to
[15:07] share with you tonight is create in me a
[15:10] clean heart. And that is from the same
[15:11] psalm. This is the psalm that after
[15:14] David fell in sin born with Bashiba.
[15:16] This is David's prayer unto God. And
[15:19] David was saying these words.
[15:22] Psalms 51. Have mercy upon me, oh God,
[15:27] according to thy loving kindness,
[15:30] according unto the multitude of thy
[15:32] tender mercies, blot out my
[15:34] transgression.
[15:36] Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and
[15:40] cleanse me from my sin. For I
[15:43] acknowledge my transgression,
[15:46] and my sin is ever before me. So David
[15:49] wasn't making any excuses. He was coming
[15:52] clean. I acknowledge my transgression,
[15:55] and my sin is ever before me. Against
[15:58] thee, thee only have I sinned, and done
[16:02] this evil in thy sight, that thou
[16:04] mightest be justified when thou speakest
[16:08] and be clear when thou judgeest. Behold,
[16:11] I was shaped in iniquity, and in sin did
[16:14] my mother conceive me. Behold, thou
[16:18] desireest truth from the inward parts or
[16:22] from the inner man, and in the hidden
[16:25] part thou shall make me to know wisdom.
[16:28] Urge me with hiss up, and I shall be
[16:31] clean. Wash me, and I shall be whiter
[16:35] than snow. Make me to hear joy and
[16:38] gladness, that the bones where thou has
[16:40] broken may rejoice. Hide thy face from
[16:43] my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
[16:48] Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and
[16:51] renew a right spirit within me. Cast me
[16:55] not away from thy presence, and take not
[16:58] thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me
[17:02] the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me
[17:06] with thy free spirit.
[17:09] So what it is to have a clean heart,
[17:12] David said, "Create in me a clean heart,
[17:15] a heart free from gu, a heart free from
[17:18] rebellion, a heart free from excuses, a
[17:22] heart free from lies, a submitted heart.
[17:26] We want God to answer our prayer.
[17:29] We want God to answer your prayer, our
[17:33] prayer. We want to hear from heaven."
[17:36] Now Psalm 66:18
[17:38] to20 says if I regard iniquity in my
[17:41] heart the Lord will not hear me. So
[17:45] people pray they say words to God but
[17:47] it's better whether or not God will have
[17:49] respect to those words. What if David
[17:52] had gone into excuse mode explanation
[17:54] mode why it happened and why this
[17:56] happened and how this happened? No.
[17:57] David killed all of that and David
[18:00] confessed his sins and said unto thee
[18:02] have I sinned created me a clean heart.
[18:05] I want to get out of this. I want to be
[18:08] cleansed. P me with hissup. So Psalm
[18:11] 66:18 said, "If I regard iniquity in my
[18:14] heart, the Lord will not hear me." But
[18:17] verily, God had heard me, he had
[18:20] attended to the voice of my prayer.
[18:23] Blessed be God which had not turned away
[18:25] my prayer, nor his mercy on me. Brother,
[18:31] he said, you know, as a servant of God,
[18:33] you ought to watch what you're doing
[18:35] because you are written epistles of all
[18:37] men. You Christians always be willing to
[18:40] lend a hand or to do somebody or to help
[18:43] somebody to make life more pleasant for
[18:45] them. You say, "Well, I don't have any
[18:49] gift of healing."
[18:51] You don't have to have. At least offer
[18:54] something. Offer prayer. Do something.
[18:57] Make them feel. Do the best you can by
[19:00] them anyhow.
[19:02] Never turn a shoulder, a cold shoulder
[19:05] to anyone, no matter what it is. Even if
[19:08] they mistreated you, do it anyhow. If
[19:12] you can't do it from your heart, then
[19:14] you ought to come to the altar and stay
[19:18] till that spirit comes into you from
[19:21] your heart. You can love those who
[19:25] doesn't love you. I want to repeat that.
[19:28] He said you can love those who doesn't
[19:31] love you. That is when God will answer
[19:36] your prayer. So you could tie this
[19:40] straight into St. Mark 11. When you
[19:42] stand praying, forgive if you have ought
[19:44] against any. So what he's saying here
[19:46] now he continues for as long as there's
[19:49] anything in your heart if and he quote
[19:52] the scripture if I conceive iniquity in
[19:56] my heart God will not hear me that is
[19:59] what David said and that is true he
[20:02] won't hear you so tonight you're hearing
[20:05] me on the song of my voice and you know
[20:08] what is going on in your heart and
[20:10] therefore you will have to know if you
[20:12] need to pray that prayer like what David
[20:14] did or said what David said. But you
[20:17] cannot just have iniquity in your heart
[20:20] and say you're going to pray because we
[20:22] have a word for you. He won't hear you.
[20:26] What is iniquity? Iniquity is something
[20:29] that you have done wrong that you know
[20:31] better and you ought have done it. If I
[20:36] conceive
[20:37] iniquity in my heart, God will not hear
[20:40] me.
[20:41] Let's continue. But Abraham again Jesus
[20:44] said, "Many will come to me that day and
[20:46] say, Lord, Lord, after that I cast out
[20:47] devils and work great mighty works and
[20:49] wonders in your name." He said, "Depart
[20:51] from me, ye workers of iniquity."
[20:55] What is iniquity? David said, "If I
[20:57] conceive iniquity in my heart, God will
[20:59] not hear me." Iniquity is something that
[21:03] you know you ought to do and you won't
[21:06] do. You ought to do and you won't do it.
[21:09] You know better, but you won't do it.
[21:12] It's iniquity. See, you know, they
[21:16] should stay with the word of God, but
[21:18] for the church sake or somebody else
[21:20] sake or something else, you will stray
[21:23] from the word of God and do what the
[21:25] organization say. Well, I don't know. My
[21:27] church say we should do it this way and
[21:29] I believe it this way. See, it's right
[21:31] before you and you shouldn't do it. That
[21:35] is iniquity. Depart from me, ye that
[21:39] work iniquity.
[21:40] All right. Psalms 139. And this is a
[21:44] song I used to love. Um there's a song
[21:47] with these words, "Search me, oh God,
[21:49] and know my heart. Try me and know my
[21:53] thoughts and see if there be any wicked
[21:58] way in me and lead me in the way
[22:00] everlasting." And these words
[22:05] means that you are
[22:07] asking God to search you. This is when
[22:10] you become conscious of you and your
[22:13] standing with God. Search me. The song
[22:16] used to go, "Search me, oh God,
[22:21] and know my heart today.
[22:24] Try me, oh Savior.
[22:28] Know my thoughts, I pray.
[22:33] See if there be
[22:37] some wicked way in me.
[22:41] Cleanse me from every sin and set me
[22:46] free.
[22:48] And that was such a song that was a
[22:50] special song to me.
[22:53] Let's continue. Some time ago, a
[22:56] minister was preaching and there was a
[22:58] man who attended his church quite a
[23:00] lengthy time. And he came that morning
[23:02] up to the altar and he said, "Pastor, I
[23:05] now wish to give my testimony and my
[23:07] surrender to the Lord Jesus, which I had
[23:09] done last night." The pastor said,
[23:11] "Well, I'm sure glad to hear about that,
[23:13] John, to know that you have decided to
[23:15] finally come and give yourself to the
[23:16] Lord because we don't want to hurt your
[23:18] feelings, but we know that you have been
[23:20] very wicked and we know that you have
[23:22] mistreated your family. You're gambling
[23:24] with your money. You drank it up. Live a
[23:26] horrible life and your family went
[23:27] without and gives and it gives my heart
[23:29] joy this morning to know that you have
[23:32] some come forward now and going to
[23:34] surrender yourself to the Lord to come a
[23:36] different person to serve him. He said,
[23:38] "Thank you, pastor." He said, "I just
[23:41] want to ask you something. What sermon
[23:42] did I preach or what text did I use or
[23:45] what song was sung in the church in the
[23:47] in the hymns that made you decide to do
[23:49] this?"
[23:51] And as the man looked at him in his face
[23:53] with tears running off his cheeks, he
[23:54] said, "Pastor, it was none of your
[23:56] sermons do as good as they were. It was
[23:58] none of the choir singing or specials do
[24:00] as good as they were." He said, "Then
[24:02] would you tell this congregation why you
[24:06] have made this decision?" He said, "I
[24:08] work with a man who's a Christian and I
[24:11] have said everything to him. I've called
[24:13] him holy ruler. I call him a religious
[24:16] fanatic and everything didn't bother him
[24:19] a bit. But he lived such a life till
[24:23] finally in my heart all along he has won
[24:26] a place that I want to be like that man.
[24:28] And that's the reason I ask him to lead
[24:31] me to Christ. I want the Christ that he
[24:36] serves. You see God does work through
[24:40] the pastor to get his church ready. He
[24:42] works through songs to get his church
[24:44] ready. He works through you to get his
[24:46] church ready. If your pastor would fail
[24:48] and continues to fail, you would hunt
[24:51] you another pastor quickly. You would do
[24:53] that. If your choir didn't sing right or
[24:55] your solos wasn't right, you would say
[24:57] to the director, "The one who has the
[24:58] music, don't let them sing anymore. They
[25:00] just make me nervous to sing." But what
[25:03] about you as an individual? How do you
[25:06] feel in your daily living? How do you
[25:09] tally up with God? What God sees for you
[25:12] to be a shining light that is set on a
[25:15] hill. No one can pass that away when
[25:18] around your way without knowing about
[25:19] Jesus. What type of life do you live?
[25:22] One of those types that is mean and
[25:24] insulting and aggravating and
[25:27] indifferent. Can you speak of the peace
[25:30] and the love that you have found in
[25:32] Christ? She has made herself ready. And
[25:36] to that I want to give an example of
[25:39] this man called Abraham. And this is
[25:42] found in Genesis 22 where God telling
[25:44] this man take now thy son.
[25:48] Next line emphasis thine only son Isaac
[25:51] whom thou lovest and get thee to the
[25:53] land of Mariah and offer him there for a
[25:57] burnt offering upon one of the mountains
[25:59] which I tell thee of. This is Genesis
[26:01] 22:2. And in verse 7, Abraham head up
[26:05] the mountain. And verse seven, Isaac
[26:07] spake unto Abraham and said, "Father,"
[26:09] he said, "my father." He said, "Here am
[26:11] I, my son." He said, "Behold the fire
[26:13] and the wood, but where is the lamb for
[26:16] burnt offering?" And Abraham said, "My
[26:18] son, God will provide himself a lamb for
[26:21] a burnt offering." So they went both
[26:23] together. Now, I want you to look at
[26:24] this because I want to show you somebody
[26:27] that is walking in obedience, somebody
[26:29] is walking in submission, being
[26:31] submissive, somebody's walking in
[26:33] humility. see the results of it. They
[26:37] came to the place where God had told
[26:38] him. Abraham built an altar there, laid
[26:40] the wood in order, bound Isaac his son,
[26:42] laid him upon the altar upon the wood.
[26:43] Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[26:46] took the knife to slay his son. And the
[26:49] angel of the Lord called unto him out of
[26:50] heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham, he
[26:52] said, here am I. Lay not thine hand upon
[26:54] the lad, neither do anything unto him.
[26:57] But now I know that thou fearst God,
[27:00] seeing that thou wil not withheld thy
[27:03] son, emphasis again, thy only son from
[27:06] me. So God is looking to see how willing
[27:10] we are, how submissive we are, how
[27:14] subjective we are to his will, which is
[27:16] his word as revealed to us. Because
[27:19] there are things in prayer that God will
[27:21] speak to you and show you that you need
[27:24] to do, show you how you need to act or
[27:26] whatever. And is your subjection and
[27:28] submission to what God is revealing by
[27:30] his word is how your life will unfold.
[27:33] And Abraham called the name of the place
[27:35] watch I'll skip. And Abraham lift up his
[27:38] eyes and looked and a ram caught in the
[27:40] thicket. Verse 14 says and Abraham
[27:42] called the name Jehovah Gyra. It said to
[27:44] this day in the mount of the Lord shall
[27:46] be seen. The angel of the Lord called to
[27:48] Abraham out of heaven second time. This
[27:50] is God speaking again and this is God
[27:53] pronouncing the blessing be based upon
[27:55] obedience based upon submission by
[27:58] myself have I sworn sayeth the Lord for
[28:01] because here we go because thou has done
[28:05] this thing not talk this thing this
[28:08] talking thing have to stop him in a
[28:11] certain way we talk too much we talking
[28:13] talking when are we going to act and do
[28:15] because thou has done this thing in
[28:18] other words I give you instruction
[28:20] instructions and you follow through.
[28:21] Give instructions and you obeyed because
[28:23] thou has done this thing and has not
[28:25] withheld thy son only son that in
[28:28] blessing I will bless thee in multiply
[28:30] and I will multiply thy seed as the
[28:32] stars of the heaven as a sandwich upon
[28:34] the seashore thy seed shall possess the
[28:37] gate of his enemy. Just one more I want
[28:41] to show on concern then this surrender.
[28:43] This is David again. Same psalm but from
[28:46] 15 and 17. He say oh Lord open my lips.
[28:50] This is verse Psalm 51 verse 15 and 17.
[28:53] Open thou my lips and my mouth shall
[28:57] show forth thy praise. For thou
[28:59] desireest not sacrifice else I would
[29:02] give it. Thou delightest not in burnt
[29:05] offering. And then David said these
[29:07] words, "The sacrifices of God are a
[29:11] broken spirit. Your tough spirit has to
[29:14] be broken. Your intact spirit has to be
[29:17] broken. The sacrifices of God, a broken
[29:19] spirit, a broken and contrite heart. Oh
[29:23] God, thou will not despise." Okay, let's
[29:26] continue.
[29:28] What is the opposite to this humility,
[29:32] submission, and obedience?
[29:34] What is the opposite to this? We're
[29:38] talking about church folks now. We're
[29:39] not talking about unbelievers. We're
[29:40] talking about you and I. We who say we
[29:43] believe. The opposite of humility,
[29:46] submission, and obedience is
[29:48] stubbornness,
[29:50] disobedience,
[29:52] and rebellion.
[29:53] And the person who reflected this the
[29:56] most is Saul.
[29:59] And this is where you see partial
[30:03] obedience. And this is something I never
[30:05] struck before, but it's something I
[30:07] think is very important. It's lessons
[30:08] that we can learn, draw from here. I
[30:11] don't know if I will go to this further
[30:12] sometime to come in the future. But in s
[30:15] 1st Samuel 15, after Samuel give
[30:19] instructions, God give instructions.
[30:21] Samuel coming out to Saul. Now, Samuel
[30:23] came to Saul and Saul said unto him,
[30:25] hear his words. Blessed be the Lord, I
[30:27] will perform the commandments of the
[30:28] Lord.
[30:30] Samuel said, "What meanth this bleeting
[30:34] of sheep in my ear, and the luring of
[30:37] the oxen which I hear?" And Saul said,
[30:39] "And they have brought them from the
[30:41] Amalachites. For the people spare the
[30:43] best of the sheep, and the oxen to
[30:45] sacrifice unto the Lord by God, and the
[30:47] rest we have utterly destroyed."
[30:49] Remember what David said, "The
[30:50] sacrifices of God is a broken spirit,
[30:52] broken contrite heart. Thou will not
[30:54] despise." This guy Saul in partial
[30:59] obedience
[31:00] did only part. He was to slay everything
[31:03] utterly. And he is saying that he kept
[31:06] this to make a sacrifice unto the Lord.
[31:10] This what he kept was in disobedience to
[31:13] instructions given to him. Then Samuel
[31:16] said unto Saul, "Stay, I will tell you
[31:17] what the Lord had said to me this
[31:19] night." And he said unto him, "Say on."
[31:23] Samuel said unto him,
[31:27] "When thou was little in thy own sight."
[31:30] Ahu.
[31:31] So sometimes people start off little in
[31:33] their own sight and then in their own
[31:35] sight they get big and large. Big and
[31:38] large. When there was little in thy own
[31:40] sight, was thou not made the head of the
[31:43] tribe of Israel? And the Lord anointed
[31:46] thee king over Israel. And the Lord sent
[31:49] thee in a journey and said, "Go and
[31:51] utterly destroy the sinners, the
[31:52] Amalachites, and fight against them till
[31:55] they be consumed. Wherefore then does
[31:58] thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but
[32:01] this thou fly upon the spoil and did
[32:03] evil in the sight of the Lord?"
[32:07] And Saul said unto Samuel,
[32:09] "Yay, I obey the voice of the Lord,
[32:13] and have gone the way which the Lord
[32:15] sent me, and have brought Aog, the king
[32:18] of Amalcch, and have utterly destroyed
[32:21] the Amalachites."
[32:23] But the people, now he's putting blame
[32:26] now. He's pointing fingers. But the
[32:28] people took the spoil, sheep and oxen,
[32:31] the chief of the things which should
[32:33] have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice
[32:35] unto the Lord thy God in Gilgar.
[32:38] Samuel said, "Have the Lord as great
[32:41] delight in burnt offerings and
[32:43] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[32:46] the Lord? Behold, these were the words
[32:49] come to obey.
[32:51] To obey is better than sacrifice,
[32:55] and to hearken than the fat of wrath.
[32:59] For rebellion
[33:01] is as the sin of witchcraft,
[33:04] and stubbornness is as iniquity
[33:08] and idolatry. Because thou has rejected
[33:11] the word of the Lord, he had also
[33:13] rejected thee from being king.
[33:17] Now I know we used these scriptures
[33:19] before for rebellion is as a sin of
[33:21] witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[33:23] iniquity and idolatry.
[33:26] But let's look at that word
[33:27] stubbornness.
[33:29] Stubbornness
[33:30] dictionary it's a dogged determination
[33:34] not to change one's attitude
[33:37] or position on something.
[33:41] They have a a a sentence. The error was
[33:45] sheer stubbornness in refusing to admit
[33:49] a mistake.
[33:50] Stubbornness is the quality of being
[33:53] determined to do what you want
[33:57] and refusing to do anything else or
[34:00] being difficult to move to change or to
[34:05] deal with.
[34:07] Stubbornness
[34:09] refers to the unyielding resistance to
[34:11] God's will.
[34:13] A hardness of heart
[34:16] that refuses
[34:18] correction,
[34:20] instruction,
[34:22] or submission.
[34:24] Stubbornness,
[34:26] resistance
[34:28] that refuses correction, instruction or
[34:32] submission.
[34:34] And you know he says many as I love I
[34:36] rebuke and chasen.
[34:38] It is also linked with rebellion and
[34:40] disobedience. A will that insist on its
[34:45] own way rather than God's. 1st Samuel
[34:48] 15:23. For rebellion is as the sin of
[34:52] witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[34:54] iniquity and idolatry. Here stubbornness
[34:57] is equated with a serious sense of
[35:00] iniquity and idolatry. Why? because it
[35:03] places one's will above God's will. An
[35:07] interesting note here in the amplified
[35:10] 1st Samuel 15:23 says for rebellion is a
[35:14] sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is an
[35:16] idolatry and terapim which is household
[35:20] good luck images the so so in other
[35:23] words they are individuals there are
[35:26] people that put their will their desire
[35:29] above God as if that is a god to them so
[35:34] it says it like a good luck image
[35:37] about to close.
[35:39] Zechariah 7:1 11-13,
[35:44] but they refuse to hearken and pull away
[35:47] the shoulder and stopped their ears that
[35:50] they should not hear. Ye they have made
[35:53] their hearts as on a diamond stone,
[35:56] least they should hear the Lord, and the
[35:58] words from the Lord of hosts at sent in
[36:01] his spirit by the former prophets.
[36:03] Therefore came a great wrath from the
[36:05] Lord of hosts. Therefore it come to pass
[36:08] that as he cried and they would not
[36:10] hear. So they cried and I would not
[36:14] hear, say the Lord of hosts. Do you see
[36:16] what God said here? When the prophet
[36:19] cried, the people would not hear. So
[36:21] when time come for day to cry, God said,
[36:23] I will not hear.
[36:26] Jeremiah 7:23-28.
[36:29] And this thing commanded I them, saying,
[36:32] Obey my voice, and I will be your God.
[36:35] He shall be my people, and walk ye in
[36:38] all the ways that I have commanded you,
[36:40] that it may be well unto you. But they
[36:43] hark not, nor inclined they ear, but
[36:46] walk, here we go, in the councils, and
[36:49] in the imagination of their evil heart,
[36:51] and went backward, and not forward.
[36:55] Since the day that your fathers came
[36:57] forth out of the land of Egypt, unto
[36:59] this day, I have even sent unto you all
[37:02] my servants the prophets, daily rising
[37:04] up early and sending them. Yet they have
[37:06] not unto me or incline their ear, but
[37:09] harden their neck. They and they did
[37:12] worse than their fathers.
[37:15] Therefore shall thou speak all these
[37:19] words unto them, but they will not
[37:21] happen to thee. Thou shalt also call
[37:24] unto them, but they will not answer
[37:26] thee. But thou shalt say unto them, This
[37:29] is a nation that obeyeth not the voice
[37:32] of the Lord their God, nor receiveth
[37:36] correction. Truth is perished and is cut
[37:40] up cut off from their mouth. Are you the
[37:42] person that cannot be spoken to? Are you
[37:44] the type of person that nobody could
[37:45] correct? There are people that get
[37:46] upset. They don't want to get no rebuke,
[37:47] no instruction, no correction. They get
[37:49] upset. They feel people attacking them.
[37:51] They must say what they want to say, do
[37:53] what they must do, and that's leave me
[37:55] alone. I close with these words as they
[37:58] close tonight.
[38:00] Rebellion,
[38:02] stubbornness,
[38:04] disobedience
[38:06] bring judgment and ruin.
[38:08] Why not surrender tonight? Ask God to
[38:12] take away that stubbornness from you
[38:14] tonight. Let us pray.
[38:16] Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight and
[38:19] I believe this is a word from you to
[38:21] your people.
[38:23] David could say, "Create in me a clean
[38:25] heart." You told your prophet, "Be more
[38:29] sincere."
[38:31] To be more sincere, it means there must
[38:33] be a level of sincerity that is already
[38:35] dear.
[38:36] How much more of a heart that is not
[38:39] even towards you and even submitted or
[38:41] surrendered to you in constant sin,
[38:44] repeated sin, repeated attitudes,
[38:46] repeated behavior, repeated you know
[38:49] display of anger and temper, whatever.
[38:52] And God after a while we forget about
[38:56] the warnings, forget all the red lights,
[38:59] breaking the red lights, breaking the
[39:00] rules, and still believe that things
[39:03] going to work out fine. It can't and it
[39:07] won't. May this be a pause in every
[39:10] heart here tonight that they could say,
[39:12] "Search me, oh God, and know my heart."
[39:15] Because who really know the heart of
[39:18] man? Man, his heart is wicked and
[39:21] desperately wicked. That that's man,
[39:23] Lord. Who who really know what's in the
[39:25] heart of people? But tonight, you know,
[39:28] and we want to lay it all upon your
[39:30] altar. is a song, beautiful song that
[39:33] said, "Is your all on the altars of
[39:35] sacrifice lay in your heart? Does the
[39:38] spirit control you can only be blessed
[39:41] and have peace and sweet rest as you
[39:43] yield him your body and soul?" Father,
[39:45] we are called to live a surrendered
[39:48] life. I think about Cornelius, the life
[39:52] that he lived, a man known, giving arms,
[39:55] free person, sharing, giving, helping.
[39:58] And you so bless him. You only only
[40:01] bless him as an individual. You bless
[40:03] his whole house.
[40:05] This is what we want to see. Blessings
[40:07] upon houses, blessings upon homes, not
[40:11] curses, but blessings. Just as there are
[40:14] blessings that could be this also. But
[40:17] Lord, we pray tonight. We want to be
[40:18] like Psalms 1, a man planted. Blessed is
[40:22] he that walketh after the counsel of the
[40:24] ungodly.
[40:25] Oh my Christians not partaking in the
[40:30] counsel of me ungodly nor being a
[40:32] stumbling block in the way of sinners.
[40:33] Father God bless your people tonight as
[40:35] they get on in prayer. May your spirit
[40:38] come down and speak.
[40:40] Speak. May your spirit come down not for
[40:43] jump for joy or whatever but for a
[40:45] heartthirst experience where men and
[40:46] women get right with God. We want a
[40:48] church that is cleansed. A church that
[40:51] is hungering after righteousness. church
[40:53] that is walking in holiness and purity,
[40:55] undefiled lives, walking around the
[40:57] world today without a blemish. Oh God,
[41:00] tonight create in me a clean heart and
[41:03] renew a right spirit within me. This
[41:07] may this be the prayer of each one here
[41:10] that you refresh us with your presence,
[41:12] we refresh us with your love. We
[41:14] wouldn't presume anything or take things
[41:16] for granted, but we would seek to wait
[41:19] upon you with all our hearts. Bless the
[41:21] ministry, Father. Bless the church.
[41:23] Bless the service come up this Sunday.
[41:25] Bless brother Isaac as he's in Ghana
[41:27] that your Holy Spirit will be with him
[41:29] to use him for your honor and your
[41:31] glory. And Father, may our lives be for
[41:34] your honor and your glory. Not for our
[41:36] honor, our own glory, but for your honor
[41:38] and your glory. As brother Gideon
[41:40] preached the other night. God, may it be
[41:42] so. As we commit this whole session into
[41:44] your hands, each person here, may they
[41:47] get a witness of your spirit tonight.
[41:49] May they get a special touch from you
[41:51] tonight. May they see this not in vain.
[41:54] May they not see this as a negative
[41:56] exhortation or negative stuff. But this
[41:58] is just your word. This is just your
[42:00] truth. Lord, David said it. A broken and
[42:03] contrite heart. You will not despise.
[42:06] You wouldn't despise brokenness tonight.
[42:09] You wouldn't despise people at the altar
[42:11] in their homes. People lay that altar in
[42:13] their hearts and leaning before you
[42:15] asking for your intervention, asking for
[42:18] your mercy, asking for your grace. Pass
[42:20] me not away from thy presence, oh God.
[42:24] Take not thy holy spirit from me.
[42:26] Restore unto me the joy of my salvation.
[42:30] Renew a right spirit within me. Father,
[42:32] bless the people tonight. I commit their
[42:33] lives into their hands in Jesus name I
[42:35] ask it. Amen. God bless you. Thank you
[42:38] again for being here. And I pray trust
[42:41] that this will do something for you that
[42:43] you would search yourself. You wouldn't
[42:45] just want to be a church member, but you
[42:48] really want to be what God want you to
[42:50] be. God bless you as we get on in prayer
[42:52] tonight. Praise the Lord.

[1:30:38] he saw that bride coming forth. He said,
[1:30:40] I believe that bride is called. receive
[1:30:41] into the kingdom of God. He saw the
[1:30:43] dynamics coming to the mechanics. He saw

[1:30:49] divine. Oh God, may your people be

[1:30:56] you going to make us strong and you'll
[1:30:58] make us to stand. Oh God, you're having
[1:31:00] us to stand regardless of what that we
[1:31:02] must stand. Stand by your word. Stand by
[1:31:05] what is right. To speak what is right.
[1:31:07] To do what is right. To think what is
[1:31:09] right. To act what is right. Oh God,
[1:31:10] bless your people tonight. Strengthen
[1:31:12] your sons and daughters once again.
[1:31:14] Bless the upcoming service this coming
[1:31:15] Sunday. Bless the sick people in our
[1:31:17] midst that you would touch them and heal
[1:31:19] them. Bless the parents burden for their
[1:31:20] children. Bless the wives burden for
[1:31:22] their husbands. Husbands burden for
[1:31:24] their wives. Oh God, bless the families,
[1:31:27] Father, that have issues and challenges.
[1:31:29] May you bring a great breakthrough and
[1:31:30] deliverance. Granted, God in Jesus name
[1:31:32] I ask it. Amen and amen. Thank you,
[1:31:34] Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I
[1:31:37] trust the Lord that you are blessed
[1:31:38] tonight. I was blessed tonight by the
[1:31:40] word and um we we we don't try to bring
[1:31:43] what we feel and what we think. We try
[1:31:45] to bring what we believe that the Lord
[1:31:47] want you to hear that that God want us
[1:31:49] to get fine-tuned. And when God asked
[1:31:51] the prophet about sincerity, be more
[1:31:53] sincere. It was finetuning that coming
[1:31:57] that to perfection, that razor edge. And
[1:31:59] we can't be blunt around the edges. We
[1:32:01] have to come to that surrender. And I
[1:32:03] believe if we have to be guided through
[1:32:07] this treacherous time we living in, we
[1:32:09] have to be led by the spirit. And that
[1:32:11] the dove can't lead a wolf. The dove
[1:32:16] can't lead stubbornness. The dove can't
[1:32:18] lead rebellion. The dove have to lead a
[1:32:21] lamb. So somewhere along the line, our
[1:32:24] spirit have to break a broken heart, a
[1:32:28] broken contrite spirit. We are too
[1:32:30] strong in ourselves, too strong with our
[1:32:32] own wills and our own desires and what
[1:32:34] we think and what we feel. And we so uh
[1:32:36] quick to say what we feel and what we
[1:32:38] think and everything else. But I realize
[1:32:41] as we get into that mastery, as we get
[1:32:44] into that perfection, there'll be more
[1:32:46] temperance, there'll be more control,
[1:32:48] there'll be evidence that it is soaking
[1:32:51] in and it's getting part of you now that
[1:32:53] you cannot do your own thing, say what
[1:32:55] you want, uh go where you want, act
[1:32:57] however you want. It cannot be like
[1:33:00] that. So, God bless you. Thanks again
[1:33:02] for being here tonight and and have a
[1:33:04] good evening. God bless.
