Lord we want to look at two portions of Scripture Genesis chapter 3 and Isaiah chapter 6 thank you musicians god bless you praise the Lord yet to see everyone this morning so we read Genesis 3 from this this is 8:11 and then down to verse 23 and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden and the Lord called unto Adam and said unto Him where art thou and he said I have heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told me that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shalt not eat this 23 therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life amen praise the Lord and over now to Isaiah chapter 6 Isaiah 6 this is one to five mm in the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it to the seraphim's each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one cried and another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said i worries me for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts amen amen Jehovah mighty warrior amen mighty in baffle amen praise

glory to God look a lotta Honda praises one amen amen so from adoption in Genesis 1 when God called his name Lord God it's in the word of ill Allah Elohim which means a self existed on and there was nothing else existed but him there was no air no light no stars no world there was nothing else it was called and God alone thank you for Antony man what a song amen Gordon going alone priest but inside of this great Elohim was an attribute let me say this rare nature inside of him was a nature to be a father but he's a self existent there isn't anything for him to be a father to and down inside inside of him there was something else he wanted to be a god a god is an object of worship yet he was self existent a man how could he be God if there was no one to worship Him amen again inside of him he was a savior but there was nothing lost to be saved a man inside of that nature he was a healer but there was nothing sick to be healed can we say man glory to God if he used to be God then he must have some worship as a man hallelujah praise God so L owe him praise God created the first the first thing he created was some angels and they came around and he will stop him and they became and then he became God can we say man hallelujah hallelujah praise God amen and those hinges never cease to worship God and to give him adoration praise God day and night they worship Him praise God amen I wanted this morning we have somebody who's gonna worship and praise God who's gonna sing holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty praise God who was and

do no more than worship angels couldn't be lost angels don't get sick they're immortal beings British God so although he was happy to be worshiped as God yet a great part of his nature was still locked up inside of him and he wanted to express it where is God amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God you can displace healing pause then then praise God but he could this morning hallelujah glory to

hallelujah amen glory so after the Angels he said we'll make something tangible and there in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth but the earth was just void having no form no structure no life just darkness and the Spirit of God began to move upon the waters hallelujah maybe the Spirit of God will begin to move this morning a man in your situation of Darkness praise God in your

reconciliation of the blood the greatest fellowship that any mortal can know is when he is in a blessed presence of Almighty God hallelujah no other fellowship can take its place do you agree with Allison or Rayna in a question what is God's purpose for creative man flourish Mabel nobody in the spirit in the answers for man to have a perfect fellowship with God perfect fellowship that's the reason you were created more the reason for perfect fellowship can we say ma'am no one they said deep crave and I'm longing in your heart for something a hunger in to be in contact with God hallelujah

that perfect fellowship with you can we say man glory Branham says I've ministered in many heathen nations where some people didn't even know their right hand from their left hand but I've never seen a human being in my life regardless of how primitive he may be but he has always worshipped something hallelujah he said he will worship the Sun you worship the wind the Stars he may even make an image and worship it but it's just in him it's an instinct in him to worship and have fellowship amen amen amen amen amen amen and if we were put here for a purpose then there's nothing can destroy us

man praise God in man amen amen glory hey bad so in the beginning when God made man in his own image he puts him in the Garden of Eden he had a perfect fellowship amen the cool of the evening late afternoon when the twilights were falling but abandom says I can see the great Jehovah come across the top of the palm trees and I can hear the roaring of the Thunder when Adam and Eve gathered all

hallelujah hallelujah glory now can I tell you one thing about God and the presence of God are you listening is everyone that means when God created the Angels even before he created the universe the Angels started to worship Him day and night as a matter of fact there was no day at night they just wanted him for eternity forever and ever and ever amen and all they could have said was holy holy holy is the Lord holy holy holy are you God amen and I say I've got a vision of it one time he saw those servants above the Troon of God crying holy holy Lord you are holy and brother and sister this

Lord at a beauty of holiness hallelujah halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah Isaiah 35 says a highway shall there be an away and it shall be called the way of holiness where is God the unclean shall not pass over it praise the name of the Lord somebody shout holiness somebody shout holiness Lauren even in Exodus 39 when they made the holy crown of pure gold to be worn under on the the top of the high priests pretty scar they wouldn't be engraved holiness unto the Lord amen praise God hallelujah glory sure brother wherever God is or his presence there must be holiness God dwells in holiness amen amen let me say it this way since he is holy in order to access his presence there must be holiness amen for perfect fellowship in the presence of God one necessary requirement that must be met his holiness somebody shout holiness hallelujah where is God to be holy is to be without sin perfect sinless and sacred praise God a man [Applause] [Music] glory glory so when Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden of Eden they no longer met the requirement to access the presence of God they were no longer holy they were no longer perfect they became human and now they were hiding from the presence of the Lord or that's what humans do hide from the presence of the Lord my God my God where is God sin makes you want to hide from God's presence you do something wrong you feel condemned you don't want to come to church you're hiding from the believers that's the effect of sin a man a man a man a man but no no come on now you have a father who loves you Peter said Lord to whom shall we go you our Father hallelujah Lord I've sinned I repent go make it right but come boldly before the throne of God amen apologize go to the place and if you have to but don't stay in that state don't say that straight praise God that's the devil strategy to cut you off from the presence of God hallelujah hallelujah he did it in the Garden of Eden and he does it all the time trying to take away your access right to God's presence somebody say man no but we expose him this morning Oh glory to God in a hallelujah Jehovah he is your father you tell the devil Satan this is a father and son of here get out of my family business British God where is God holiday a father and son praise God hallelujah amen praise God Satan you're an impostor I know who my father is I know where I came from I know who I am and I very well know who you are get out of here Satan praise God hallelujah 30w trying to mess with my mind trying to tie you up with a cord to tie to your pass you did this you did that yes I know I did that and I'm wrong but my father has already forgiven me praise God glory to God glory to God in Satan you're a loser hallelujah oh please what yesterday I asked my daughter Gabi who is Satan he said he's a loser man I said hey man hallelujah praise God amen Satan is a loser hallelujah and you've got to talk back to the old serpent talk back to him a man Laurie get the Lord had a praise hallelujah and when Adam and Eve sinned two things happen they lost the requirement to access God's prison so all fellowship was cut off on their side the second thing God himself no matter how much he wants to he cannot fellowship outside of holiness that's just who he is it's his nature he is constrained by his own law a man a man brother outside of Calvary this is probably one of the saddest scenes in the Bible Jehovah excitedly coming down looking desperately for his children come on Adam I don't where about I've come to have Church I've come for fellowship Adam you usually have I know where usually man but Adam is hiding brother branham said as soon as Adam realized he had sinned he should have been running through the garden screaming father father where doubt but instead it was God screaming Adam Adam where the Oh God my mercy Lord he said man at no point in time or in any age ever sought after God it was always God seeking after man are you grateful this morning that he sought up you his spirit draws you this morning hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus somebody give him praise somebody praise him for calling you somebody praise him for seeking after you Alleluia I never sought God it was God God who came looking for me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord Adam is afraid first time ever fear strikes phase of the devil amen Adam tries is one thing to save himself he uses fig leaves to cover sin a moral religion to cover his sinful nature but when he came face-to-face with God do you recognize that he was lost his efforts were no good his religion could not bring him into the perfect fellowship with God and God rejected his religion because the sin itself was still there and God cannot smell outside of holiness can he say man amen so God has nothing to do with religion whatsoever religion has nothing to do with God Amen hallelujah and God's Lee is a sheep and wraps the skin around them as a temporary covering but he had already given them his world and he is constrained by his own word because the word is God amen and the wages of sin is death the day you eat thou shalt surely die amen and Adam died after 930 years which was less than a thousand years or one day he died the same day the day that you eat you shall surely die but it was also a spiritual separation which meant separated from God or cut off from the presence of God hallelujah they lost their claim to eternal life and the inheritance and life itself praise God hallelujah hallelujah right there God had to keep his judgment because he had spoken it and he is God he can't back up on his word in order to be God he has to keep his word my my my a man a man a man I'm with a heavy heart Gorton's Adam and Eve and said you have to leave this God you must depart out of my presence you can't live here anymore he said a bit of heavy heart look Jesus my my man then he placed cherubims with a flaming sword to guard the Tree of Life that no man can just walk back and access the Tree of Life it is not free no more this is private property hallelujah my my my my my my my Adam and Eve turn and walked out of the garden crying hugging each other leaving walking through the gates looking at their home for the last time mmm I my mind but all God can bear to see his children leave his presence [Music] and when we leave his presence his spirit is grieve hallelujah he's grieve British God don't you leave his presence ain't how it grieved the heart of God to see them go no he meant as they were about to leave his heart was rent into pieces the love of God LOV II was protecting through amidst the judgment hallelujah hallelujah for god is love amen amen as he will leave in he watched them and he looked over their heads he was watching into the future his love was protecting praise God hallelujah he was driving them out that was his judgment and God is a consuming fire come on amen but his eyes of love his eyes of grace they were looking into the distance hallelujah hallelujah then he said Satan you got them this time but I shall restore them I shall retain them I shall bring them back to Ethan again hallelujah did the Lord a shout of praise better believe it Satan praise God hallelujah hallelujah amen and when he said that he was looking way down into the future he was looking over into 2019 and he saw a bride and part of that bride wasn't true that part of that bride is here this morning he saw a bride coming to perfection he saw a sinless bride hallelujah he saw a super church he

Eden driven out of the presence of God His perfect man now fallen man he had to make preparation for fallen man in order to bring him back in his presence again Satan tried to take God's Word and twist it or defile it she deceived Eve and once he got him to sin then he knew God cannot break his word so they had to be put to death then God can no longer be worship see Satan's whole intent and purpose is to stop you from giving God God worship by luring you out of God's presence through sin man so by God's own law in nature Adam and Eve must die amen but poor devil but a beer Paul says whatever there's a higher law than the letter of the law Oh God Himself pulled out a higher law it's called a law of grace glory to God amen glory to God in her hallelu and grace grace provided an

of God is our trouble something he says it's a dreadful thing that experience that Isaiah had when he saw the Lord that wasn't a shot an experienced writer it was sovereign but abiram said Isaiah remember it all his life those angels in holy holy holy is the Lord he fell the glory of God he saw the Lord of Hosts mighty in battle and his train filled the temple that's a sign of victory the longer that Kings trainers the more battles year 1 but his train the temple he is a mighty chorus falling where he's God and Isaiah was martyred by King Manasseh who soared him asunder and punished him for having said I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips according to history men and Parabellum said when the saws were cutting through Isaiah's buddy you could still remember the angels
