would we be without you lord are we thanking for your blood we thank you for calvary we thank you for the old rugged cross team with blood so divine father we thank you for that blood covering this morning for they come down over that blood lord your presence come and fill every hungry heart here this morning have your way in jesus we ask it amen and amen you won't be seated [Music] it's good to be home it's good to be home amen well greetings from uganda the bride of christ and the people uh the believers there host pastor john chaconi church was dedicated had about 50 ministers over there pastors i believe and we had a great time in the lord and it's so good to see god's people hungering and twisting for righteousness oh blessed be the name of the lord we'll be hearing more about those meetings but god has been good to us and god has been good to me they gave me the strength and they gave me the grace to be able to amen make these trips and these journeys but i thank god for his love and to think that you know we just have a short space of time to do what we have to do before you know it the years just pass by hallelujah whatever you do what kungs is what you do for the kingdom of god not the house that you build not the car that you drive know what you do for the kingdom of god we went out not to represent trinidad represent this church but to represent the kingdom every christian represents the kingdom of god you represent a higher power a higher authority your anointing and your unction and your authority comes from above it doesn't come from the local church it doesn't come from an elder or a pastor or bishop it comes from above hallelujah praise god you are sons and daughters of the living god it doesn't have a great one among us and a greater one among us it doesn't have that it only have sons and daughters of god a pastor pastor and five people is just as good as a pastor pastor in ten thousand people it's just sons and daughters of god that god put gifts and places and and talents and so forth for his glory and for his honor he know what you could handle he know what you could manage he know what stress you can take and he wouldn't give you more than you can bear that's the god that we serve with every temptation he makes a way of escape he wouldn't leave you just to give up and let go and pack up shop he will always make a way because he has proven himself to be a waymaker where there seems to be no way where you're seeing press pop and you can't have a way to turn you have a way of opening doors that you didn't even know was there sometime in the room or locked up but god slam on the open and when god opened that door for you whatever god opened no man could shut that door glory to god hallelujah maybe this morning god might open a door to good health maybe this morning god could open the door to you for revival maybe this morning god could open the door that you could receive the baptism of holy ghost and your deliverance maybe this morning god could open your prison and you could walk a free man a free woman this morning oh what a mighty god we serve oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but for the blood of jesus where would we be without that blood that's why today there is still power in the blood you may not understand all what we preach but there is power in the blood a blood price was paid for your deliverance that's why the devil have no right this morning to hold you back hold you down and cage you did you ever have no right this morning because jesus paid a price that you could soar but you never went before jesus paid a price that you could go free [Applause] you may be seated but the brandon said one of the worst things is to see an eagle caged up you got caves up a bird that was born to soar no limits or how high you could go where you could fly what meat you're going to eat no limits oh hallelujah and some spirit of man come to entrap an eagle how that eagle long sword it's built into flies built into sword built in the press and when you tell a son of god you have to stay in that estate you cannot tell a true son of god that you were built to rise from the ashes you were built to punch back up you were built to raise up from the jaws of defeat to be given victory over the kings of the enemy you will raise up for godzilla and squad glorious good to be here this morning it's good to be in the presence of god it's good to be under the anointing of victory of triumph oh blessed be the name of the lord glory to god amen god bless you may be seated i want to thank brother anthony and brother isaac for holding on and amen preaching the word of god that's what the anointed to do to preach the gospel without compromise hallelujah we are not responsible for what god said we're responsible for giving the message of what he said if you fight with it that's your problem that's not our problem because once god said it got to come to pass god don't raise words god don't waste time god don't play games god don't play politics god said my word is different from every other world my word have a peak a way about it it just cannot return void but it always accomplished the purpose that i said and fought to accomplish and if god sent me in this morning with a word for you that word can't return for it oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god you know what somebody made a statement if you keep speaking the truth every time you wouldn't have to fight up to try to remember what you said last oh hallelujah hallelujah if you keep speaking the truth every time you wouldn't have to fight up with what you try to remember what you told that person the time before because it is not so straight because your life become consistent your life comes you directly with the words from your mouth you see it is powerful to be authentic it is a stress to act to perform to do to impress people you have to make a great effort to do that but when you are you you and you are you when when you know who you are and where you come from you are just who you are you don't take effort to be who you are you you just you just are who you are when you see me you see the father because the father dwelleth in me that's what jesus said hallelujah praise god give lord some praises oh hallelujah glory and the only thing that could return you to that uniqueness is divine revelation and jesus said upon this rock i will build my church the prophet said he don't need man to help him build his church he is the architect he draw the design for it he know where he wants what so stop trying to help god and just move in the spirit the way god wants you to move be free to serve him breathe free to worship you'll have to sit stiff like you belong in some priesthood back there no you don't have to walk like you have some angels wings and some fall off and you're looking to recover here this morning no no he be lit he make himself lower than the angels he became one of us to become like us to feel the way we feel you feel tired you feel weary but he kept pressing on because you know if you only get the calvary we will come true oh oh precious is the flow that mainly white is slow the fountain oh nothing but the blood of jesus [Applause] we need the power of the blood there's a song that say look beyond my faults and so my names what a wretched people we are but god rich rich in mercy but now i heard those words rich in mercy deserve to be condemned deserve to die but god rich in mercy hallelujah for glory hallelujah rich and mercy mercy there was great and grace was free pride and death was multiplied to me there might be soul from liberty at calvary oh hallelujah mercy there was great and grace was free pad and death was multiplied to me [Applause] [Applause] this morning [Music] foreign hallelujah oh glory how many an expectation this morning [Applause] that god can do more than you could ask or think raise your sight a little higher than where you are raise your faith a little higher than where you are raise your focus a lot and where you are going to bless this morning god want to deliver this morning god want to change this morning i found a powerful statement and i believe it's from franklin d roosevelt that said not everything that is feast can be changed but nothing can be changed until it is faced i cannot like that i want to say it again not everything that is faced can be changed but nothing can be changed until it is faced if you want to change you have to listen confront yourself you know some people like to confront other people that confront this one they're free no confrontation they come from confrontation they love confrontation some people run from confrontation but when are you going to begin to confront yourself where you are the way you operate what you think what you feel where you go why are you saying all this this morning but over i don't know i just have to say what he gave me to say and i just hope it sticks somewhere between the left rib somewhere down here inside your heart but you got to confront yourself some point in time as a husband as a wife as a man as a woman as a sister as a daughter as parents father mother as a believer as a worshiper as a child of god you have got to confront yourself because you're going to find out today god's behavior is his person so that god's behavior is especial not what you say but what you are so on authenticity comes to the point of what you are not what you say you are but what you are and that's what jesus came to do to bring us into a revelation and a recognition of who we are because we lost it amen amen we lost it we lost our dominion we lost our inheritance we lost our position with god we've lost when we look in the mirror we didn't recognize who that was because we lost the vision we lost the purpose and intent of god for what we were born for what we created for but jesus in sins 14 20 said that day you shall know that i am and the father he and me and i knew and paul said we know in part be prophesying part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is part is done already and we shall know as we are known so we're going to know that we don't know just yet but we're going to know something that's so powerful that it will change and revolutionize your life you are dumb because you don't know who you are you are depressed because you don't know who you are you act weak because you don't know where you are but if the weak begin to say i am strong and get the strength of god on the inner man then you begin to see something a little different you stop complaining you stop praising you stop complaining you start worshiping [Applause] we're going to read the scriptures just now but we want to float a little bit i want to feel something like that hallelujah let the probe of the spirit go down to prove our hearts football minds and souls amen it takes effort to act it take effort to be like somebody else but it's natural to be unique and people don't appreciate their uniqueness in god that's why we can't have one cover in one banner one method is one baptist he kind of one church to be under there has to be one holy ghost has to be one kingdom because man are different countries are different cultures different and we are shaped by an environment our culture our country and everything else make us act and behave a certain way but the life gonna be christ in the different countries in the different environment you're gonna be christ one christ there's only one lord you've got ten laws only one lord there's only one baptism and distinct today the sting today is there's only two forces or two influences you don't have three you don't have ten just two i want you to think about that because this is where i'm going today and the title this morning is being influenced hallelujah praise the name by the prophetic vision to get into action hallelujah praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord getting into action by the prophetic vision being influenced to get into action by the prophetic vision and that is what has happened to your life you have to be influenced ain't meant to get into action there are only two influences you either influence towards god or away from god some light up something coming to influence your marriage to break it or to heal it you come into church to get closer to god a further from god influence is everywhere it's ever all around us all the advertisements are wrong is to influence us to buy this product or that product they have it on the airwaves they had it on billboards what is that for to influence us to make a choice between coke and pepsi or whatever it is they want to influence us and the devil have his influence and god have his influence god influences his word and that's what he want to bring to you this morning an influence of the word hallelujah and if you have the influence of the word then you have the influence for life oh glory to god so as we want to stand and give god some praises hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah [Music] the blood of jesus [Music] around and greet somebody and look at them that the blood is washing them oh glory [Music] blood [Music] [Applause] of jesus [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus [Music] for the blood of jesus [Music] jesus [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] we want to turn our bibles ezekiel chapter 12 10 from 22 to 28 also from harbourcot chapter 2 1-3 proverbs 28 29-18 influence into action by the prophetic vision ezekiel chapter 12 reading from verse 22. son of man what is that proverb that you have in the land of israel saying the deeds are prolonged and every vision feel it tell them therefore thus saith the lord god i will make this provoked disease and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel but say unto them the days at hand and the effect of every vision for there shall be no more any vain vision no flattering divination within the house of israel for i am the lord i will speak and the word that i shall speak shall come to pass it shall be no more prolonged for in your days oh rebellious house will i say the word and will perform it say the lord god again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man behold day of the house of israel say the vision that he see it is for many days to come and he prophesied of the times that are afar off therefore say unto them thus saith the lord god they shall none of my words be prolonged anymore but the word which i have spoken shall be done saith the lord reading from habakkuk chapter 2 reading from verse 1. i will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what i shall answer when i am reproved and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run readed it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie do it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry and from proverbs chapter 29 reading verse 18 where there is no vision the people perish let us pray father we thank you for your word and i pray give us spiritual insight bless the word lord take me out of the way and be glorified in jesus in my asket amen amen you may be seated but abraham our eternal destination is not all together determined by what we see or what we hear it is determined on what diseasement we have of what we see on what we hear amen what a christian looks to is never the scene all our power and strength is unseen that's why we walk not by sight but by faith isn't that right and the prophet said in influence phoenix what we have seen his promises in the last days ought to put each one of us into action you have to see something that will inspire you into action many people sit and hear sit and you know understand but that's more on an intellectual level but what you hear must put you into action so somehow the holy spirit have to translate what you hear into an understanding that is so simple that when you read it you could run because he was told to write the vision and then make it plain it ought not to be complicated it ought not to be that you don't understand the vision because the vision must be made clear must be made clear plain for you to understand it that you could move into action if you don't understand it you would freeze if you understand it you're going to begin to understand the part that you have to play because a minister cannot bring a revival if the people have to bring a revival therefore the understanding has to come to the people so it's not about the minister it's not about the preacher it's about you getting divine revelation to enter into your inheritance oh blessed be the name of the lord do you believe that this morning now watch what we have seen do you know what he said cover yourselves humble yourselves then get into action watch what we have seen happen should put every soul in action it should make a church that would make a revival here in phoenix that people will be flying in from europe to see what's taking place there's a place in arizona called maricopa valley a city called phoenix there was something broke out until the seven thunders of revelation 10 that's not even wrote is being manifested in other words somebody some group somewhere some part of the world will be able to say this day this scripture is fulfilled oh hallelujah the seven thunders is being made manifest you mean that's a promise that's a promise you mean that's a vision that's a vision it's a vision of perfection because you cannot move unless you get revived [Applause] you see if the pipe is dripping you could let it drip yes you don't have to fix it right away if you choose not to it could drip all day and just make noise pip but if the kitchen catch a fire you can't just watch the city's on fire that's a different thing altogether you get into action you see the dripping pipe you're not going to move because that's just drip drip drip but the fire forget it if you don't move your house is gone and that's what we need we need to see fire somebody say fire oh hallelujah but either the fire gonna move all them turtles hiding in their shell they're gonna make the title come out the shell beating them with the stick won't do it it take fire oh glory to god to get them turtles out of the shell all you touches inside of here you're going to come out your shell did that come fresh i didn't even know we have to live totally transparency at least and then that confession didn't know that hiding under this hardship you can't get to them at all don't be poking out and going back in pokemon and going back in coming the church and going back in they ain't doing nothing i met a turtle on the beach and he hit it it wouldn't come out shook it didn't come out pressing the gun but he said lights on fire again that head come on down the move that's what's going to make the church move but not fire of the holy ghost begin to come all them dead morse church members gonna rise up hallelujah so don't tell me you can't get to run but the mom said if you're not running the devil out behind your devil got you you better be running oh how you better be running if you're not running the devil get you hallelujah you better be running i'm running for my life this morning oh hallelujah you love him praise god amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise god so friends this is the time to be influenced by the word that's right to be put into action with reverence and humility isn't that right blessed be the name of the lord and that's why people feel safe hiding in groups they feel they want to take the burden off of their being an individual and put it on the group so therefore you are safe in the group and i belong to this group i'm a methodist i'm a baptist i'm a this you want to belong to a group but god has have a way of singing gonna get your group name you have one name the name you're born into say silver rose i hope you have that name they're born into silver rose family and and the person gave their name julie and her name is julie silva rose isn't that right you couldn't know the name you're born into that's the name that we're born into but that's what i'm talking about you have been given a name given a part given a role and that part is unique now when you come into that authentic who you are there is no room for jealousy because you don't want what any other person have you know what come on now you don't want that gift you don't want that position you want to be in the place that god wants you to be because in your place you have power in your place you have authority in your place you have faith [Applause] hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen raise the name of the lord when you come to know who you are then your inner is in harmony with your altar no i have no internal self conflict you don't have no points to prove you're not trying to get people to respect you respect me respect me it will live a life and people will respect you because people respect you not for what you're given to but what you stand for come on and see him and glory glory you see when you come to be who you are in god you not you don't cater for the group for the crowd for what the exciting council is saying you don't cater for that you said you have heard in all times hate your enemy and kill and do that but i say unto you love your enemies do good to them that do evil to you in other words do the opposite bust them in kindness bust them in sweetness boss them in humility we're going to have the life of christ on display oh hallelujah do you believe that hallelujah glory to god amen so then when you have to please people you have to find out what they say somebody asks a question you can't answer yet because you want to know what the other saying what are you saying were you seeing we used all right i say the same thing too you have no revelation you have no inspiration it depends upon what the groups say what the feel of saying and jesus had that he said who do men say i am let's hear what the group of men oh they say some say you're this some say that everybody have an interpretation of who i am no church tell me who i am and they look to the left look at the right nobody can help because they didn't know he's a good man he's a powerful man he's a man of god that's what he just wanted to hear everybody knew that but peter said about the christ the son of the living god now the revelation is not what he said but heaven revealed to him and that's why balarama says it will take divine revelation so what people have for these years is a lot of intellectual conceptions but lacking divine revelation because divine revelation take you out a group think divine revelation raise you up into a reconciliation with god as a son [Applause] that means you can stand anywhere any place anytime under any condition you will stand because you are built upon a rock [Applause] i i'm not hearing you in other words if god put you in the fiery furnace you're going to stand if god put you in the lies then you're going to stand if god put your way ever 25 years waiting for isaac you're going to stand all his children have to stand as individuals you can't rely on your mother and your father you can't rely on your brother or your sister you got to rely on the revelation of god come into your soul because what your soul believe what's your fault of faith that's yours your faith in your soul that's yours you can be healed right now as the word is being spoken that is yours [Applause] oh glory did you get that did you get that jesus man came to jesus he said i reckon i sound about you you're a man under authority amen you have authority you have to be under certainty you have to be authorized to have power other than that you're taking power on your own like in yourself a kind of dictator business he said i know you're a man under authority and you say to one go on he go now speak the word i'm a servant that's not a brother there's not a family there's a servant and he is sick just speak the word you don't have to come and lay hands don't even come on the mind just speak the word i have power to believe your word i know your word is not going to return void i know your word of omnipotence speaking when your nipple can speak the miraculous that's it when you speak your word can't return for it when you speak that's god speaking when you speak that's not a man speaking as god speaking oh hallelujah my word shall not be prolonged i will bring my own word to pass oh of a prize revival of a seven ton revival in trinidad i will bring my word to pass oh hallelujah now watch when that man reach his house he wasn't asking how you're feeling he started to ask what time what time do you know what time he was healed what time was he healed what time i want to confirm they say the same time the word was spoken the same time the word was spoken do you believe you could go free today when the same time the world is spoken [Applause] you don't have to remain sick you don't have to remain depressed you don't have to be man trapped you don't have to be covered with all that heaviness over you he came to lift your heavy burden he come to raise you up in spirit [Applause] in case you forgot i want to remind you for all i've come short of the glory of god for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god so if you think you're up there somewhere we all have sin we are come to mind all have sinned not some not some war and some all have sinned and come short of the glory so when god began to dump his god we all have sinned and come short of the glory of god that's why we could have victory this morning that's our feeling so good this morning oh hallelujah because of the love of jesus which is so wonderful there is no condition that is too bad too hard too low too deep that he can reach down and pull up anoint inspire amen change the wrong turn around there's no situation that you could express to god that he can handle change transform rearrange oh glory to god he could do all of that this morning oh glory to god he could rearrange everything around your life yes this morning could be the beginning the first day of the rest of your life all what is the past is the past oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god that woman had a well she had custom going to that well just custom drawing and water at the time she saw the water she met jesus jesus went there deliberately he told the disciples go and get something to eat i need special samaria he knew exactly who he was going to meet he had a vision he knew he had to wait there and when he came here and he asked the water he said give me water to drink lady said you're not supposed to talk to me jesus if you know talking to you you'll ask me for water two different waters are talking about there hallelujah one talking about natural water with spiritual water if you know who's talking to you i have water that if you drink this water you will never taste again woman oh hallelujah what you come for this morning oh glory to god what's the what do you come for this morning hallelujah but i want to fill your soul with something that you can't taste you buy a new car they can't get old you're buying your home's going to get old you buy decent man you dress you're going to get old and your shoes when you get old you keep switching and the devil keeps shifting the target when you get this you'll be happy when you get touched you can be happy and you get this you're still not happy because happiness is not in this and that and that happiness is in christ happiness isn't god that's where you get the joy come on shame as somebody oh we glory glory glory so don't ever say when you get this will be happy when you try this vegan i'll be know you better be happy right now you're happy to be alive you're happy to be in the under the presence of god you're happy to be under the blood you're happy to be the opportunity to be in church it wouldn't always be this way come on now oh glory hallelujah amen be seated oh glory i speak what you are coming to authentic you peter peter had to get converted and jesus knew it so he told after they converted strength to bedroom you will deny me because you're human yeah you'll reject me because you're human you'll run away from me because you're human that's the human you but when you get converted that's a power that's not natural that's an inner power that brings out the review so peter as a human run away and deny christ peter as a human wept peter's the human but when he was filled with the holy ghost that changed peter totally completely to the self that god wanted to have at that day you're going to know who is inside of you because god said new heart i'll give you but that's not the end of it it's a new spirit i will give you because i want you to be able to agree with your neighbor at least there are some people so sour they saw with everybody by sight they are sour they walk sour they look sour they talk sour they're just negative you don't want to be around them because they just plain sour if you're joyful they will suffer your joy if they get a chance to they are sours they are grapefruits they are lemons that's the spirit upon them so god shall give you a new heart i have to watch god i'll give you a new spirit so it wouldn't be sours save your source inside of here you need a new spirit because god had put in the holy ghost into sowers hallelujah you have to come out of showers god put in holy ghost and wolf [Applause] hallelujah holy ghost coming on lambs [Applause] and the only way to check out isaiah is to do something to you to see if the lamb coming out or the wolves coming out if the wolf's coming out you have to keep pressing on cause somebody say amen if the lamb come out then you're looking to be anointed come on say amen somebody give the lord a shout that is why it has no bull head in god's kingdom as a woman because woman bullhead is big bullhead in god's sight man i already have his head black already much just to add a woman to that too i just a little too much okay let's continue oh hallelujah what hey what you what you are speak so loudly i cannot hear what you were saying that there's so many ministers want to be somebody honestly they anointed themselves uh but didn't cry on themselves fightful in themselves um posting themselves anointing one another and so on just to be somebody they want testimonies to come from who they are because they're not even sure who they are so when somebody give a test somebody who you are you are this oh you are that and how you pray here

still your spirit up jerusalem jerusalem was very quiet jerusalem was quiet oh yeah trade coming in trade going out preachers coming in preachers going out hallelujah everybody coming in and going out there's a normal normal normal until three wild men come inside of there three wise men someone so excited singing they're having a jubilee two years did you be having a jubilee they say we have seen a star in the east we come to worship and where is he it wasn't high not cut anybody see him anybody see him quietly talking about anybody it wasn't like that they was making rock changer where is he and everybody looking bland blank hey billiken like if no concern no burn just looking then church they inscription court but no these guys had a vision this vision was guarded by a star and we have got a vision also god sent seven stars and this seven angel is the seventh star to the seventh age and he released a seventh seventh and division and this vision is from a point of time and those people had to follow that star because that star it was going to lead them to the mantle that star is going to lead them to the messiah that star we're going to have to revival that star is going to lead them to the quickening power we have to follow that star oh glory glory so when they read jerusalem they thought everybody shouted everybody's singing everybody in the vision the prophetic vision they taught everybody in action king love worship i'm not hearing you they thought everybody understood that messiah is on it now not coming now get taught everybody is in the atmosphere [Applause] all of a sudden all right what scripture is that what quote is that just tell me again my name is supposed to be born because long time we hear that quotas because they're preaching something else preaching about rome preaching by the pope preaching my way dress long look at your hair but the division the vision depiction everything else but division and decision right division make it plain the people was supposed to see the vision the vision was messiah coming in your life living faith living virtue living knowledge living temperance living patience living cognizance it was a vision of perfection jacob grace truly perfection was a vision that would attract god hallelujah make it plain right division number one make it plain number two number three you have to read it and then going to run oh glory hallelujah give the lord a shout out when the vision is made plain you can help protect an action [Music] nobody had to pump you up nobody have to tell you worship god no you know what you worship you know who you worship you know why you worship i'm not hearing you this morning i'm not hearing your shouts this morning [Applause] god amen is the objective of worship and if you're worshiping then he's your god then you worship him not because they get a cow or get land or get house i get something you know people fight for so much things and afterwards they have to leave it all back with five pieces of land and they're going down on it the family they're fighting the land and fighting on and when they get the land they're all fighting night for 30 years and after all they said this this is my land can i even walk 100 steps on it what a waste of life what we fighting for what's what you want to achieve oh my isaiah was leaner than king uzziah until the king got rot he got proud he felt he could be a minister he felt he could do whatever he wanted to do that's what happened when people get arrogant when they feel they're so powerful they don't care they live they act they do whatever they feel to do and the king went in there to offer sacrifices and the priest tell them don't do it don't do it he still was angry they saw leprosy struck him he died leopard that they took him out and when isaiah saw his prop collapse isaiah went to the temple and a vision broke upon him he saw the lord high and lifted up trail filled the temple seraph's flying back and forth holy holy lord god almighty the worshiping so strong that the post was moved by the glory and by the worship and the atmosphere and god was put upon the god was teaching isaiah something that six wings these creatures two wings that cover their face two wings they cover their feet and two wings they did fly all the wings wasn't the fly or every ring had a purpose a pair to cover the feet to talk about humility isn't that right appear to cover the face rather talk about humility isn't that right and pray to cover their face reference fit humility and appear to be in action so you could be reverent you could be humble but you're dead you're not in action you can be crying to god crying when you're telling do something you're not doing it because you're stubborn so the gospel effect you can pray plenty you like to pray oh let me say it this way you like to say words to god but i'm not even praying praying is getting in tune they're all different kind of prayer enough supplication you could pray for somebody else you could be in thanksgiving and worship to god amen that's what you start off with thanking god and worshiping him let him know who he is and you know who he is and how he deserves all the glory and honor praise god you don't use god like if he's a bank lord give me a five and if you have some make sure put some hundreds on that there just looking to just get from him go give me i need that give me go tell me look look look give me come in give me not even worshipping on praise and god just give me you just want give me look look look brother give me coming look sister give me come on hallelujah where's the worship where's the praise where's the thanksgiving where's the glory and honor why do you think you have to be satisfied and your flesh must be satisfied and god has to answer what you want what about his will what about his plan what about his purpose what about his program do you have a desire i must be about my father's business come on say him and somebody god is not about getting from him it's about finding his purpose and doing his will jesus said it this way i always do that which pleases my father oh give the lord and praise his people [Applause] oh hallelujah praise god but says what the pentecostal church from conferences needs the night is to lay us out every week and the sin that thought so easily beset us that we might run with patience the reasons that set before us we need a conference a universal parameter for the church of the living god to be called together don't think i'm angry or beside myself i know what i speak of the need of the church tonight is a conference a prayer meeting a get-together a call together notice he didn't see a need for convention he's a prayer meeting i'm permission you're not looking to man you're looking for the minister and preached are permitting a good one you don't go to a permit with books and notes to take notes in the mango and see our permission is to talk to god amen hallelujah you talking to god not you hearing what everybody prayed and said i'll go pray that too that is you talking to god because god wants to speak to you how many believers how many people want to speak to you watch this he said ministers break down a middle wall of petition church members that will forget the differences between the nomination of churches church members ministers hold to the halls of the altar with one accord and pray until fire of god begins to fall again pray until the fire of god begin to fall again somebody gonna catch a vision somebody will get an inspiration to understand the path that they have to play to see a revival break out and fire began to move again because fire has already started to move that's why we could preach what we preach because the fire making us preach what we are preaching right now because you have got to catch a vision that will put you in action oh hallelujah could somebody say amen so i don't care you can have the mightiest preachers the very best elected teachers line them up one by one to minister to you if you don't get a vision then preachers and them just doing just that what they're doing for the last 40 years yes just so in seed and whatnot but when you are ready when you say lord i want a revival what a revival does a revival boils the trash out of the church and the trash out of your life all what you can't do all what you're tolerating all what you're compromising right now all that gets flushed out it's the same sea but guess what it throws the trash on the shore because the sea is having a revival so when the storm come and it whip up the ocean like whip up this is a revival taking place it brings a still in your heart it brings a stay in your spirit it rip out the deadness the coldness it takes out the excess flesh it could be compared with when the wick get moldy and get black you got to cut the wick that means trimming your lamps afterwards the lamp gets so the revival takes a suit out your lamp it cut the wick that you get fresh light that they could see where you're going you need a revival we need a revival not want need like a car need gas to drive the church needs a revival like the car need gas to drive the church has got to have a revival what if we don't preach it what if we don't ask for it what if you don't claim it i want you to leave here claiming it in your home claiming it on the street claiming it going to school claiming it on your job lord i need a revival want a revival he said make me a revival have revival in me let me be the revival then everybody walk into the church here let me be a revival and you come here under great expectation your spirit revives your heart revive you on the prayer you're under consecration you're under worship you're on the praise you're under sanctification you're under the blood then something got to take place those demons affecting your life with the backup shop those unclean spirits have to sign off why because you are now beginning to get into action once god people begin to get into action watch the devil pack up and leave [Music] hallelujah fall without god you understanding it will raise up watch the stubbornness the indifference of men is broke up godly fear and brother love takes its praise in the human heart then it becomes salty then the message will have the preeminences in the heart it will have influence in the city we could scream shout do whatever we want it will never influence man until they see the life of christ being projected in you someone who's tend and merciful forgiven ready to run the other side of the cheek or give a second quote or go a second mind christianity in action not just taught from the pulpit but acted among the members among the pastors that's when you see christ living in the church oh hallelujah yes christ in action not just in teachings people love the teachings it is intellectually stimulating and it stimulates the great matter in front or behind the head but the action life that's different that's applied to christianity oh hallelujah glory to god they come like you go to school you learn knowledge but you have to apply the knowledge down apply the christianity where you have to love your wives where you have to listen carefully to your husband and talk try to talk the same language at least that he will understand what you've seen and you will understand what he's saying and you want to understand what he's saying because you were there to be a help meet not the other way wrong amen gone that's okay hallelujah it's still the truth right you see christ living in the church decisions are made of brother he said before going to calvary the father brought his own son into a conference in gethsemane while angels taking their positions to see what the decisions would be so jesus was having a conference in the garden of gethsemane angels at the approach of duty watching to see what the son of god will do and see if it is possible that this could pass nevertheless not my will but die will be done he was confronted by decisions and that's all our lives will be confronted by decisions and choices and based upon the choices you will see whole life unfold for you and jesus took the decision to go to calvary it was a hard choice but that's what the father presented to him a cup of death a bitter cup a cup of cruelty whipped beaten embarrassed humiliated stripped of his clothing but he was going to pay a price because he saw people coming forth by the power of the blood being released because when the blood was shed the spirit came out and that spirit was to hunt every predestinated seed that is why you're here this morning because the spirit found you go give the lord some praise people do you understand what i'm saying there are so many people right off this one and right off that one because they write up in their minds and got their write-off notes on god didn't write off that one if god was writing off right of all of us for all i've sinned have come short of the glory of god but the bible teaches god so loved the world we have to stretch amen amen oh hallelujah are you ready for some more watch if god acted any one time on a certain circumstance and if that same circumstance arise again he's got to act a second time like he did the first time or he's unjust no matter how bad you are in sin how stupid you may become he has got to act to you like he did that fallen woman or he acted wrong then that is and here we go god's behavior is his person what he is in his behavior declares his person and that's the way you are in your behavior of life tells what you are as we went on less than two years two days ago the methodist people wanted to declare when you shout you got it the pedicles don't say when you spoke in terms of got it the sheikah say when you're shaking got it watch your life declares it your person declares what you are so it's not when you shout people want them simpleton identification when you have this when you're on this when you believe this and so forth they want that but what about when you have the life when you can manifest his works when you can manifest his presence when you can live something that is more important but but people it come like if all i do is to believe but it has to be more than that because even the devil believe and tremble but you have to believe and go on and to possess what you know is your own so a revelation has to come to you as an individual because you're kind of possesses of the church because your name is you your inheritance is yours you cannot take somebody's heart it's yours glory look look look look at joseph hated by his brothers and i said he was set up to be hated his father loved him openly give him a coat openly loved them openly his brothers got a fight with that his brothers wasn't feeling that love from the father the way joseph was feeling it plus joseph had dreams that's even more complicated so they had enough on him to get rid of him they say no let me solve a problem get rid of him and that's what god wanted no you may not think that way and you may not like the experience of being stripped of being given by your family and and separated and so on in pain and spending for joseph he's young he's in pain left to the egyptians to take him over isn't that right his father in spain because the son he loves is not gone and they bring a coat with blood on his team like somebody kill him and eat him or whatever the animal and so on so it's a lot of pain but god's smiling amen god was not in pain god was at last at last my son is gently being guided into his position [Applause] [Music] to be at the right hand of pharaoh he doesn't know that yet he doesn't understand that yet that vision is for a point of time the vision i give him is for an appointed time it got to come to pass because the word that i spoke it will not be prolonged it will come to pass so joseph had the egypt by force but was it force or was it a gentle hand of jehovah using the egyptian past masters to bring a son to be positionally placed to be ruler how they need because joseph is coming hallelujah you see when you understand that no trial nothing going to stop you from confessing romans 8 28. for we know that all things work together for good to them that love god the devil won't be called according to his purpose joseph is bawling joseph is screaming joseph is suffering but god is smiling because joseph is going to come into power he has a process to go through he has destined to go through he have a prison to go into but george is going to come true because the world can't return fine you are going to be adopted you are going to be perfected you are going to be sealed [Applause] that is according to division oh give the lord some praise his people [Applause] look how much he has passed at that time the father pay must be healed all right joseph pay might be healed all right do they have family joseph in power and the brothers famine who making that farmer who created the famine god is arranging everything hallelujah because joseph got vision of the pharaoh god vision and they say send for joseph he going to reveal and make known to the king the vision hallelujah when joseph made the vision clear seven years of plenty seven years of famine the king said you are the man to set things in order to put things in place for this plague that coming upon the land so george i was given full authority to set the band and set this and said that joseph is now in power his brothers his brothers who knew the dream about boeing before jesus bowing before that chief as it was his brother's no coming trips into egypt for green oh hallelujah oh hallelujah joseph had every reason without the life of christ to put some licks on them joseph had every reason with the love of christ to give them wood deal with them heavy but joseph with the life of christ sorry he's got to tell them god god send me a head the trials over now destined over now the maturity is there the understanding is there god sent me ahead to preserve life god has sent me ahead that i could be lord over you no without me being here what happened we all perish so let's bless the lord all together [Applause] and that is when you begin to understand whatever plan and purpose for your life division didn't mean potiphar wouldn't make a move upon joseph division didn't mean to even go to prison the vision drinking just have to wait for the appointed time because joseph told the butler when they get promoted remember me as soon as butler get his thing to serve he forget joseph because the time was not yet the vision is always for an appointed time wait for it don't backslide don't give up do you have a vision of your healing we play it do you have a vision of a revival wait for it what about your loved ones being delivered wait for it don't give up it's from a point of time wait for it it's gonna come your family gonna be set free wait for it the devil could keep them so long and no more wait for it they will have to pack up and give up wait for it hallelujah hallelujah the three wise men when they hit jerusalem sargon where is he where is he hallelujah that old king said when you find him give me word bring word so i will come and worship too now that is king talking lying tongue talking there you're looking to kill baby god warned them fellas do even bother with that guy just slip out quickly and get over there when they slip out to that so-called church weird beast people they saw this there then they started to rejoice back over again revival break there was no evidence judge was unknown you're going to be pressing please you know did you jerusalem suck the revival did jerusalem try up the revival there was no start yet for them to follow there's a bunch of people asking for quotes and more quotes and more quotes and i'm looking for dynamics to the mechanics they're looking for spirit they're looking for confirmation they'll give a vindication and then follow what quotes where did messiah go when it was written we said unborn already and when they saw that star rejoice with exceeding great joy did not smiley face enough no no there's joy nice dancing nice shouting that not smiley face when you start to rejoice when you start to understand that your loved ones will be delivered my the devil can't take that joy from your soul when you when you begin to understand that you are going free and nothing going to stop it nothing past nothing present nothing to come going to stop the vision that god has purposed for your life listen that woman at the well her life was going to be changed from that day forward she was going as usual but it was an unusual day messiah was at the well he never revealed himself to nobody like that before when that woman finished she said i that's speaking to you am he she said come see a man who told me all about me who revealed quanch who i truly i am isn't this the christ that was the christ because christ will reveal who you really are you are not jacob you're israel you're not jacob christ you're truly perfection you can reveal who you are come on give the lord a shout or pray [Applause] you will be crawling now as a butt as a worm but you are really a butterfly yeah you're gonna be changed you're gonna be transforming believe that when you are hearing these promises just amen amen amen i'm gonna be changed say it but i'm gonna be transformed oh hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the lord oh hallelujah praise god you heard old story your life speaks so loud i can't hear your words so whatever you are the life that you live shows what kind of spirit is in you oh praise god when christ the son of god was put to test it showed what he was when you are put to the test it will prove what you are your life always reflects what's inside of you so then you understand what the test is for the test is to bring out the relu so when you see your collapse under the test don't get vexed say you know what there's more that had to come out that's where you're not gonna break through don't get frustrated oh god no you're pressed towards the mark pauline said i sit down because i'm so fed up and frustrated i'm no longer coming to church paul didn't talk that way he said forget me in the past because devil keeping mark your past you did this you did that you did that yes devil i did all of that but i've come to tell you today i'm forgetting the things that are pop i know i know that's past i know see that devil i was talking about behind you you're going this way i press to what's the mark up of the high calling in christ jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah we need some more people to press you need to press press your way [Applause] how many how many going to press i was scripted for that you know the kingdom of god is preached and every man pressed their way at it sorry we can push you in only pass your hand along wouldn't help you charge me about three you know people just won't hang on shake and hand long that's not gonna press you you got the pressure with him you you've got to want to get him the kingdom of god is preaching every man press their way where's the press what do you mean like the one with the blood issue that what she had to do she's the example of person she had tall guys big guy she crawled through the leg big men standing up there watching you with a hard face yeah i'm not doing that they have no faith they're watching for signs they're watching for light they're working for cloud looking for rainbow she ain't looking for no lights she just want to be healed and she told herself you see you see you got to tell yourself something some of you not talking to yourself you need to tell yourself something [Applause] when i come into church i see myself getting a breakthrough i see myself in the picture i see myself in spa i see myself relaxed hallelujah i know i'm the pastor of this church so i come here looking to god looking for divine inspiration to minister to your need there's a pastoral message this morning i'm looking for your needs to be met there are needs inside of here i don't know all what's going inside of there but the spirit who searched the reigns of the heart the spirit knows what you have leader [Applause] glory to god i want to salute all those who connected us on the internet god know what you have need of also god bless you hallelujah i trust that the spirit speaks expressly to you too to give you victory to empower your life oh hallelujah i want to be a real christian a real son a real man of god oh you wanna be seated or glory so the tests when you're put to the test it proves what you are your life always reflects what's on the inside of you bound by your sins make sure your sin don't find you wrong that's what we're trying to say jesus of course they tried to belittle him but ram he said no they want to hurt your influence before the people that's the way you want to watch careful what you do walk like real man of god talk like man of god act like man of god live like man of god because the devil your adversary is going about like a roaring lion seeking what he may devour why did he do this why did they act like that to jesus they were jealous of him that's the main reason they tried to belittle him they were jealous of his ministry and that's the reason they tried to belittle him he had a ministry of god and they knew that but it was contrary to the creeds so they tried were trying to belittle him make everything every little flaw they could find that way they want him to quit he listen they wanted him to quit they wanted the people to denounce him they wanted to say no this guy's nothing look here how he is oh he's this this you know that's not right we've been taught all our life we should believe the elders and here he is stood right then bald here though what choice they would have made if jesus come back again and jesus disagree with the bunch of elders in this message amen hallelujah we have been taught by each rabbi all the years true and this man comes along and disagree with them that man ain't fit to be a preacher they were trying to belittle him but all of that the ones that believe him loved him they seen the scriptural miracle signs that would not be hindered by them no sir them who believe and believe him those who love them stood by him and they would not see what others pointed to them oh hallelujah god always calls are you ready they're not trying to hit the spiritual not the other way or wrong [Music] that events are in the light boy amen are you spiritual you'll be you'll be hated i told them i told africa join the bunch hallelujah all those who are going under perfection will be hated because joseph was the word that's why he was hated jesus was the word that's why he was hated the bride will be the word that's why she'll be hated join the bunch so don't think everybody will put a bouquet over your flower or over your head and put a robe a ring of flowers around your neck no no no no they wouldn't see with you because you are going to perfection oh praise god so watch something they're not trying to hate the spiritual of course the kings hit evil it caused quran to hit moses it caused judas to hate jesus and on and on it goes isn't that right they tried to destroy the influence try to destroy everything because nothing but jealousy started in cain and proved it was jealousy and and then when the natural the carnal and the spiritual meet together it proves seat and no other way because jealousy comes from satan and then causing an impersonation of truth oh hallelujah so if people don't want god's perfect will god give you a permissive will isn't that right god made a perfect will and his perfect will isn't what we want today amen is not right so god wants his people to be one and the devil have a plan to try to put people under his one under his plan god has a plan and the devil has a plan and when the devil is trying to get all people under his plan while god is trying to get people to be under his plan there are two great spirits in the world one of them is the devil the other one is god so all in your life there's just two influences that's right everything is connected with those two not three not four just two is either the devil is inspiring something or god is inspiring something influence come towards or against hallelujah somebody could influence somebody against this church or to watch this church somebody could influence you away from what is right or towards something that is wrong is to and fro that's how you are influenced and jesus came to bring an influence of god upon the face of the earth they wanted the influence of a man to take power back from rome jesus said my kingdom is not of this world so the influence you want i ain't come to bring you that because you i'll have meant to fight for me my kingdom is of a different world all together because that rome and all i'm think is just temporary isn't that right all what having you captive is just temporary isn't that right so the devil of his messengers and god with messengers and we had liberty to make our choice to whom we would yield ourselves to so who have influence over your life have power over you are you hearing me whatever have influence over your life have the power over you that's why the adopted son must have dominion over himself before he have dominion over others and other things that's why jesus was led into the wilderness that he gave power over himself over the lust of the eyes the pride of life lust of the flesh when he overcome that he was ready to return in the power of the spirit to deal with the humans because when you could deal with the devil humans are secondary because you already deal with the devil it is written it is written it is written and he dealt with it by the word to prove we gonna deal the devil by the word and overcome it is written it is written it is written then the spirit come upon jesus to really handle the devil and deal with the devil and our brother bring our tremendous taught in uganda there he said the devils ask jesus to go into the pigs and jesus give them their request and if jesus could give devils their requests because they asked they're going to pick to do more mischief what about the sons and daughters the devils asked jesus let us go into the prayers and jesus said i i allow you to i give you permission i answer your requests what about you sons and daughters of god that shall wake you up inside of here to make a request known unto god there's no good thing he will hold from you there is no good thing he will withhold from you let me say it good now there is no good thing he will withhold from you he want to pour it on you and let your cup run over hallelujah david said my cup run it over my cup runs over sully goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life oh that's a man that i love that man loved god he anointed the promises of god i look under the hill so might come with my help my help comes from the lord isn't that right oh praise god amen so what the only two forms are gonna skip down oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god praise god hallelujah hallelujah you talk about united nations everybody trying to get the unity everybody on the same thing now watch it's choosing time you must choose you this day whom you're going to serve the devil has presented many things glamorous that you can choose if you wish to is that right he said no you say when an unclean spirit here we go it's gone out of a man he walks in dry places and he's going around trying to find rest here we go a spirit is not very bad until he can find somebody he can talk to or live through so the spirit is harmless until it gets somebody he could talk to and work through just recently i could feel a spirit in a meeting all sending a letter of apology the first night i forgive you god does too or when the meeting was going on an evil spirit in the meeting and that spirit here we go is almost harmless until it can cut somebody it can work through that's right watch then it can work through it certainly do damage because it's an evil spirit and the holy spirit is here trying to find somebody to work through and when it finds somebody to work through it can do good so it's two spirits their motives the objectives watch how it is watch their works watch their fruits and then you see what spirit is on you you are motivated by spirit are you hearing me this morning you are motivated by spirit if you have no spirit you are dead and if you have spirit it motivates your life and your life because the fruit of a christian is a christian spirit if you've been afraid of a christian is not right you see it in deep qualitatively people come up on the platform and bahrain says you're not sick you're you're christian what does he the man didn't speak there's a spirit of vibrating of the man that braham know he's a christian he said you're a minister the gospel you're not here you're here for revival he could discern the spirit of a christian it sends out a vibration you don't have to even speak it speaks for itself so when jesus was walking them devil was crying out because the devil seen big bright light walking and other people watching them balling belzebo and those devil seen son of god hallelujah those never seen big bright light walking the face of the earth that is about what they want to see what thousands of live voices the thunder of god turning up and sweetness and humility undefiled walking around the earth without the blemish [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah are you with me so what this spirit now goes out walks in dry places hunting the fine rest the baby said he could not find it so he said i'll return to where i come out of so he goes back to this person that he once was in and he find all the house swept cleaned up sanctified condemnation gone a real happy believer but it is empty he said come here seven other spirits worse that he was will you please try to get this the bible said that's the truth jesus said it's the truth he comes back to this house a man who confessed christ to be a savior got rid of his wickedness quit his drinking quit is smoking his lion is stealing he has become sanctified cleaned out his house is all swept if he's free he comes back you can find that house then he goes and gets seven other spirits worse than he was comes into this person and the bible said the last state of that person is seven times worse than it was in the beginning was that i tell you our empty house is a target for the devil so we have to get the empty house filled with the holy ghost so you rarely have no time to waste you have time to be hungry and tasting looking to be filled with the holy ghost because the devil gives an empty clean house and you know he get kicked out so he's not coming by himself you gotta get kicked out again he needs some help so he gets seven more and then has to be better than he was those seven worse than him to help bust down the door to come and occupy your house but today the bible said when the enemy coming like a flood the spirit of god raised a standard so we are believing this morning that standard will be raised in your life oh blessed be name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah so watch if you are filled with the world lords god send the holy spirit to the earth to motivate the church you might be filled with thoughts you might be filled with theology you might be filled with education you might be filled with religion and still be a target of the devil watch when god made you that you could empty i love that when you are born you was made with a place to be filled by nature you're a child of the devil the evangelists come along you repent get cleaned up you see what the devil comes he brings back to you and sets you in some little nomination i say our church is the biggest one and then you get heady high-minded why don't condemn me just stay home watch television it doesn't condemn me to smoke a little friendly cigarette your fruits tell you what you are now watch and then somebody come and talk about miracles you sit down somebody said don't believe that we don't believe it and then you get behind it is the same motive that was in the tower of babel god don't want that he don't want us united all under methodists under baptist or any church dominion he wants united under his spiritual kingdom the holy spirit and when the holy spirit comes the world becomes dead and you are filled with the baptism of the holy ghost and the devil is a person that has to stay away from you you are under god's domain so with the holy ghost inside of you the devil have to get permission he will stay away from you because he got shocked when jesus touched when he had to touch and interfere with jesus in the wilderness isn't that right so god made you a place that you could be emptied out oh praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord and jesus will not permit disciples to preach the gospel until they receive the holy ghost they have been honored to walk with him for three and a half years they were holy men accepted in the sight but he would not let them preach until they waited up there and got all the differences out of them and then the holy spirit came what the world needs today is that same feeling when the dumping comes out its need of filling it brings love where you have doubts it brings fate where you have indifference it brings love where you have hatred it brings fellowship and when and when the church of the living god someday will be united under one head the head of god o praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord o hallelujah hallelujah glory to god so watch watch your life being different from what they say your testimony of your life is louder than the testimony that someone could say something about you so keep in that in your mind we are bringing influences every day and the life you live proves what's inside of you you cannot change that it reflects what's on the outside and if we take the testimony of being christians i think that is one of the most solemn things that a man or woman and boy could do when you take on the name of christ here we go he is going to be a representative of christ so you are not representing headstone tabernacle you are representing jesus christ you are representing the kingdom of god when you leave here is not the believers watching you is god watching you amen others watching you too isn't that right so satan was castled from heaven isn't that right and he actually oh praise god okay he said now watch when you get man that will break up and organize and break a brotherhood that's the devil to me i've never seen a person too low i have never seen a person too far in sin yet i have never seen a woman too stooped or man to stoop but what i would go to him and put my arms around him and bring him out of that if i can i have never seen a bunch of holy rollers or whatever you want to call them shouting and rooting whatever they might do but what i'll get right there and root and jump and holler with them to glorify god whether he is black yellow brown whatever he is the holy ghost comes on one level and that's when you meet god's requirement if you ever get it it will come on god's level o praise the name of the lord do you believe that oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god blessed be the name of the lord if you get it you're going to be on god's level hallelujah praise the name of the lord so let's go over it again write division make it plain that he that readeth miran the word has to be made plain to you that as a child of god the book was sealed is unsealed to bring back what sons and daughters of god that's god's purpose and plan that sons and daughters god be restored he sent a message to restore our hearts back to the faith of the fathers faith then have to take us to power paul must take us to the promise to manifest the promise so god sent the word that we could have faith fear to raise up from where you are to possess what god promised you so faith leads to power power to the promise that manifests the promise isn't that right so the vision is this god sent a revelation of perfection jacob grace through the perfection what for to bring a resurrection no perfection no resurrection there's going to be a resurrection all the saints that have died and going on they're going to be raised from the dead there's going to be a perfect bride she will be the capstone bride she's going to be the magnet to pull the others out of the grave hallelujah that's what we were ways up for to become god magnetically our christ is forming a headstone bride and he gonna come into it and raise the rest of them from the grave l-o-v-e is coming down the love of god is coming down they're going to transform the church the love of god going to transform the church we got to break into that divine love all muslin come up please i'm fixing to close oh give the lord some praises oh hallelujah hallelujah friends it's time to get into action not just communication with my home but getting action to play your part to play your role god want everybody to be on board to be in action to get a revival to get a breakthrough your life is being influenced from above or from below hallelujah everything connected to you is either from above or from below hallelujah sometimes we don't think about it that way but i want you to think about it that way but i'm saying the worst sin is the religious one that's the worst one is a religious one the worst sinner because they in church and they believe that they're right what people mean to understand they're wrong we're all wrong god is right we want the word come alive we want the word to be made manifest we want the word to be real oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will never prevail against it let's pray something softly what is your deep desire this morning is it to serve the lord god put that desire deep in my soul as a young person hungry and tasting for him as a catholic i didn't even know where it would lead me but there was a deep calling inside of here for what was right

allies to be influenced by righteousness we're looking for allies to be guided by his spirit to be led by god pray and seek the lord ask him for his touch upon your life people live their lives
