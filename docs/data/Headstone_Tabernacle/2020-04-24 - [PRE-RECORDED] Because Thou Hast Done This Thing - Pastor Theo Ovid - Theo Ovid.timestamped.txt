[8:23] [Applause]
[8:25] - gee easily wonderful this evening
[8:32] amen wanna turn our Bibles to Genesis
[8:35] chapter 22 wanna read verse 1 to 18 of
[8:38] Genesis up to 22 it's so good to be back
[8:40] here and see all of you out
[8:44] amen
[8:46] Genesis chapter 22 verse 1 says and it
[8:48] came to pass after these things that God
[8:51] did tempt Abraham and said unto Him
[8:52] Abraham he said of them behold here he
[8:55] said take now thy son thine only son
[8:57] Isaac whom thou lovest I like that get
[9:02] the internet and I'm not the one hit
[9:04] love and get into the land of Moriah off
[9:08] him up there for a burnt offering upon
[9:11] one of the mountains which I will tell
[9:13] the Earth's imam moussa did in the
[9:16] morning service and took two of his
[9:17] young men with him and Isaac his son
[9:20] cleaved the wood for the burnt offering
[9:21] Rosa went up into the place of which God
[9:24] had told him then on the third day
[9:26] Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
[9:27] place afar off and Abram said unto his
[9:29] young men a baggie here grass and I and
[9:33] the lad would go up yonder and worship
[9:34] and come down to you the Abraham took
[9:37] the wood the bull Doran lead upon Isaac
[9:39] his son he took the fire in his hand the
[9:41] knife went together both of them
[9:43] together and as I speak unto Abram his
[9:45] father and said My father he said yeah
[9:48] my my son he said Behold the fire in the
[9:50] wood but where is the lamb for a burnt
[9:52] offering and Abram said my son God will
[9:55] provide himself a lamb for burn offering
[9:58] so they went both of them together they
[10:01] came to pass the place where God had
[10:03] told him and even built an altar dearly
[10:05] the wood in order bound Isaac his son
[10:07] Liam upon the altar upon the wood and
[10:09] Abram stretched forth his hand took the
[10:12] knife to slay his son and the angel of
[10:14] the Lord called unto him out of heaven
[10:16] and said Abraham Abraham he said here am
[10:18] I
[10:18] he said lay not thine hand upon the lad
[10:20] neither do all anything of the em for
[10:22] now I know the doll fearest God seeing
[10:25] dogs not withheld thy son thine only son
[10:28] from me and Here I am lifted up his eyes
[10:31] and looked and behold behind him a ram
[10:34] caught in a thicket by
[10:35] horns if I'm went and took the RAM
[10:37] offering up a bullet offer instead of
[10:40] his son and Abram called the name of the
[10:41] place do-over Tyra as it is said to this
[10:44] day in the month of the Lord it shall be
[10:46] seen and the angel of the Lord called
[10:48] the Abraham out of heaven the second
[10:50] time and said by myself have I sworn
[10:52] saith the Lord for because that was done
[10:56] this thing and has not been held I son
[10:58] and only son died in blessing I will
[11:01] bless thee in multiplying I will
[11:03] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[11:04] heaven as the Sun which is upon the sea
[11:07] shore and thy seed shall possess the
[11:09] gate of his enemies and in thy seed
[11:10] shall all nations be blessed because I
[11:13] was obeyed my voice may God bless His
[11:15] Word you may be seated
[11:16] who praise God this exhortation we push
[11:19] communion table and the title of that is
[11:22] because that was done this thing those
[11:25] words were spoken before because thou
[11:28] has done this thing the Garden of Eden
[11:31] man felt God say because that was done
[11:33] this thing you disobey my voice get
[11:37] kicked out that's what we agree here
[11:39] were people dying because I was done
[11:42] this thing but this is a different thing
[11:43] that was done here this was a man that
[11:46] was inspired by God you had inspiration
[11:49] to hear what the voice of God is man
[11:50] called Abraham and I choose to bring
[11:54] this as an emphasis because there's
[11:55] something that you have to do not
[11:58] because you have said this thing because
[12:00] you have done this thing because once it
[12:03] just reveals has to be tested once it
[12:06] reveal it has to be tested like 10
[12:09] percent say Amen the others meditation
[12:12] of the food at 8:00 I don't know but
[12:14] once it has been revealed it has to be
[12:16] tested that's what God does he tests
[12:20] because he wanted best and the test
[12:23] brings out the best in you and I only
[12:26] the tester do that I want to say that
[12:28] again the tests bring out the best what
[12:30] if this students is who got no tests
[12:32] promoted from form 1 the form to the
[12:34] treat of water 5 what don't have money
[12:36] in their phone 5 what would happen in
[12:39] job market the tests filters the best
[12:43] from the rest the test the snack and the
[12:47] tests provide the cue to send the person
[12:51] to the higher level so as you pass this
[12:54] test of faith you could revert you
[12:56] mental knowledge then to temperance and
[12:58] patience and countenance there's every
[13:00] level of a test because one want the
[13:03] best at the top of it see it I'm not
[13:05] getting less Satan a delusion less than
[13:07] his best he has illusions best forces in
[13:09] this last day the challenge the bride
[13:11] two hundred thousand Thousand Devils
[13:13] coming loose against this bride don't
[13:15] have to lose his best also or glory to
[13:18] God so God bring the nobodies the people
[13:21] that they look like they are bright the
[13:23] people that have this condition that
[13:24] condition he chose you that you chose
[13:27] Gideon like it was just I don't pass and
[13:29] Samson like he told all them gurus of
[13:32] faith it wasn't looking like the people
[13:34] that were supposed to be but God made
[13:35] them it's not what you look at is what
[13:38] you have to become it's what you have to
[13:40] be designed into I love her and people

[21:35] organizations we've seen all of this all
[21:37] you're seen a man you see a man pick up
[21:39] a sitting scripture and brother that man
[21:42] can take that scripture and make it live
[21:43] on you make it live just exactly what it
[21:46] promised in the Bible and the next one
[21:48] we'll see him do it and you come around
[21:49] and try to do it and feel he would say
[21:52] why the scripture is not inspired to him
[21:55] he is only trying to imprison it
[21:58] he's trying to act like something
[22:00] hearing it recognizing as and acting
[22:03] upon it
[22:03] many will hear it but who recognize it
[22:05] so just you know the scene wait because
[22:08] they're not hearing it and recognized in
[22:10] it hallelujah if God takes I'm a young
[22:12] person five years old I'm speak to them
[22:14] I'm all dust and a lot anybody could
[22:16] know is good because you know the words
[22:18] come but I find the whole mode but
[22:20] that's what that's a gift that God could
[22:23] use and speak to a child's picture a
[22:24] woman or switches somebody and people
[22:26] who could I caught words but this is God
[22:28] speaking the only time and people do
[22:34] like is that what talk and this is what
[22:35] we speak to what this is God talking
[22:36] about talk about that donkey behind once
[22:39] the word coming up you know I don't
[22:41] speak so it doesn't matter who is behind
[22:44] here as long as the word
[22:50] you have to take it that's caught
[22:51] talking to me look what I'd end up
[22:53] tonight I'm a destiny so if the devil
[22:56] come and offer you something temporary
[22:57] no take that hold that hold that here
[22:59] that's what he did to Jesus all these
[23:02] kingdoms are mine

[23:06] pay my price you'd love to be no
[23:08] sacrifice for me I gotta be behind the

[23:22] be yours and I will be just be behind
[23:25] she said no I have a brain I come in to
[23:30] pee for this thing because the laws of
[23:33] God demanded a price to be paid
[23:37] he couldn't get you for free that's the
[23:44] one solution because this is not to miss
[23:46] a run dog run all wrong come back up run

[24:41] lawyer I'll hear this song
[24:44] you see friend you must realize what
[24:48] condition you're in and that's the
[24:51] reason to stay I said to the church only
[24:53] if you have been called from lights from
[24:56] darkness and the light from death unto
[24:58] life from formal intellectual conception
[25:01] of Christ to be of born-again experience
[25:03] and watch in your life that it leaves
[25:07] the things of the world aside and you
[25:09] stand for Christ regardless until
[25:12] something happened there is something a
[25:14] new hungering and move them like it was
[25:18] with Jacob you wrestle with the Lord you
