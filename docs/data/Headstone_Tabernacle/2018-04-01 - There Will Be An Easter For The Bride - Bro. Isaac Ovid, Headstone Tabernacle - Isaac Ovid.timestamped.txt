[1:11:42] Easter Sunday morning so I greet you on
[1:11:44] behalf of the pastor on behalf of the
[1:11:47] ministry as well and today we do have a
[1:11:51] note a phrase I would like to give God a
[1:11:54] high note of praise for keeping me all
[1:11:56] these 67 years today is my birthday and
[1:11:59] I would like to thank him for the
[1:12:00] mountains and the valleys for the good
[1:12:02] and bad and all the trials he and his
[1:12:05] wisdom has sent my way I would like to
[1:12:08] thank you for my personal revival as I
[1:12:10] await my healing god bless you but a
[1:12:12] Tarrance of it god bless you brother
[1:12:14] Terry happy birthday and in this seas of
[1:12:18] this Easter season this revival season
[1:12:21] may you receive your healing this
[1:12:24] morning so what can we say about the
[1:12:26] weekend thus far good Friday
[1:12:28] goroh produces himself with anthony
[1:12:32] minister such a tremendous blessing and
[1:12:34] the praise and worship service last
[1:12:37] night and here we are this morning under
[1:12:39] expectation for God to do exceedingly
[1:12:43] abundantly above all we can ask or thing
[1:12:45] this morning and I encourage you today
[1:12:48] you get what you expect you get what you
[1:12:52] expect and you will get out of it what
[1:12:54] you put into it and this church is not a
[1:12:58] movie this church is not entertainment
[1:13:00] it's a participatory experience so
[1:13:03] you're not here to sit back to just
[1:13:05] enjoy it but you're here to create
[1:13:07] something because when around them
[1:13:09] torches that the minister could never
[1:13:10] bring the revival but when the people
[1:13:12] come under expectation and come with
[1:13:14] their knees and come to put something
[1:13:17] into the service then something happens
[1:13:19] can the church say Amen
[1:13:21] so I'd like to get straight to the word
[1:13:23] this morning reading from st. mark 16
[1:13:27] reading from verse 1 reading from Romans
[1:13:29] 8 and reading from revelation 1 this
[1:13:32] morning
[1:13:42] like to welcome all the visitors and our
[1:13:44] gates this morning so readings in mark
[1:13:48] 16 and reading from verse 1 and when the
[1:13:52] Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and
[1:13:55] Mary the mother of James and Salome II
[1:13:58] had brought had bought sweet spices that
[1:14:01] they might come and anoint him and very
[1:14:04] early in the morning the first day of
[1:14:06] the week they came unto the sifaka at
[1:14:09] the rising of the Sun and the said among
[1:14:14] themselves who shall roll us away the
[1:14:16] stone from the door of the sepulchre and
[1:14:20] when they looked they saw that the stone
[1:14:23] was rolled away for it was very great
[1:14:26] and entering the sea folker they saw a
[1:14:29] young man sitting on the right side
[1:14:30] close in a long white garment and they
[1:14:32] were affrighted and he said unto them be
[1:14:35] not afraid he seek Jesus of Nazareth
[1:14:38] which was crucified he is risen he is
[1:14:40] not here behold the place where they
[1:14:42] laid him but go away tell his disciples
[1:14:45] and Peter that he goeth before you into
[1:14:47] Galilee where shall you see him as he
[1:14:50] said unto you reading Romans 8 and
[1:14:52] reading from verse 11 Romans 8 and verse
[1:14:57] 11 but if the spirit of him that raised
[1:14:59] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he
[1:15:02] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:15:04] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:15:07] his Spirit that dwelleth in you and
[1:15:11] reading revelation 1 and reading from
[1:15:15] verse 12
[1:15:18] revelation 1 and reading from verse 12
[1:15:24] and I turned to see the voice that speak
[1:15:27] with me and being turned I saw seven
[1:15:29] golden candlesticks and in the midst of
[1:15:33] the seven candlesticks one like unto the
[1:15:37] Son of Man clothed with a garment down
[1:15:39] to the foot and good about the paps with
[1:15:41] a golden girdle his head and his hairs
[1:15:43] were white like wool as white as snow
[1:15:46] and his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[1:15:49] his feet like unto fine brass as if they
[1:15:52] burned
[1:15:53] furnace and his voice as a sound of many
[1:15:55] waters and he had in his right hand
[1:15:58] seven stars and out of his mouth went a
[1:16:00] sharp two-edged sword and his
[1:16:02] countenance was as the sunshine it in
[1:16:05] his strength and when I saw him I fell
[1:16:06] at his feet as dead and he laid his
[1:16:09] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[1:16:12] not I am the first and the last I am he
[1:16:15] that liveth and was dead and behold I am
[1:16:17] Alive for evermore amen and have the
[1:16:20] keys of hell and death
[1:16:22] be the lord at a blessing to the reading
[1:16:24] of his word you may be seated
[1:16:28] so I have a title this morning there
[1:16:36] will be an Easter for the bride a
[1:16:40] subject who will roll away the stone and
[1:16:44] an inspiration if that same spirit that
[1:16:47] raised Christ from the dead dwells in
[1:16:50] you but before I go any further I want
[1:16:53] to read one more scripture for context
[1:16:56] this morning and it's the same script
[1:16:59] everywhere the last night in Hebrews 2
[1:17:03] and verse 14 for as much then as the
[1:17:07] children are partakers of flesh and
[1:17:09] blood he also himself likewise took part
[1:17:12] of the same that through death he might
[1:17:15] destroy him that had the power of death
[1:17:18] that is the devil
[1:17:20] and deliver them who through fear of
[1:17:23] death were all their lifetime subject to
[1:17:26] bondage for verily he took not on him
[1:17:28] the nature of angels but he took on him
[1:17:31] the seed of Abraham wherefore in all
[1:17:34] things it behooves him to be made like
[1:17:37] unto his brethren that he might be a
[1:17:39] merciful and faithful high priest in
[1:17:42] things pertaining to God to make
[1:17:44] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:17:47] people for in that he himself had
[1:17:49] suffered being tempted he is able to
[1:17:52] succour them that are tempted can the
[1:17:56] church say Amen
[1:17:57] so just to place this in context
[1:18:00] yesterday we spoke on the secret mission
[1:18:03] of Jesus and how when we go
[1:18:07] so back to the beginning and God created
[1:18:10] the heavens and the earth and he created
[1:18:13] the animal he created animal life he
[1:18:15] created plant life he created the fishes
[1:18:18] he created all of nature and any placed
[1:18:21] man in the Garden of Eden and in the
[1:18:24] Garden of Eden God would come down in
[1:18:26] the cool of the evening to fellowship
[1:18:28] with Adam he would come down in the cool
[1:18:31] of the evening to converse with Adam
[1:18:33] that's what the Bible teaches us and
[1:18:35] it's interesting to note that even
[1:18:38] though God would come down in the cool
[1:18:39] of the evening to fellowship with Adam
[1:18:42] and his wife that when the devil came
[1:18:44] and spoke to Eve the interaction that no
[1:18:48] doubt she would have had when God come
[1:18:50] down in the cool of the evening did not
[1:18:52] seem to be enough to have kept her from
[1:18:57] falling for what the devil had to offer
[1:19:00] God had spoken to Adam and given Adam an
[1:19:03] instruction and given him dominion over
[1:19:05] the earth and dominion over everything
[1:19:08] Adam had the power to create he had the
[1:19:10] power to move things around he was like
[1:19:12] God on the earth he was made in the
[1:19:15] image of God he had attributes like God
[1:19:18] and his responsibility was to let Eve
[1:19:21] know what God had said to him and God in
[1:19:24] His grace and mercy would come down in
[1:19:26] the cool of the evening here in the
[1:19:29] Garden of Eden to minister to them out
[1:19:31] of how was your day Eve how was your day
[1:19:34] and and I could imagine I want to know
[1:19:36] what your experience would be like if
[1:19:38] every evening you had the opportunity
[1:19:40] for court to walk into your house and
[1:19:42] and talk to you and find out how your
[1:19:44] deal was and it's very hard for court to
[1:19:48] have spoken to you yesterday evening and
[1:19:50] for the devil to come today and you make
[1:19:54] a mistake you fall and the devil is evil
[1:19:57] after you would have met God yesterday
[1:19:59] evening and the devil would come and see
[1:20:01] something to you to throw you off at
[1:20:06] that time it was a relationship that man
[1:20:10] had an obligation to not touch that tree
[1:20:14] and when man did not touch that tree he
[1:20:18] was keeping his part of the Covenant
[1:20:20] with God but when man hell God said you
[1:20:25] know what I am never making that kind of
[1:20:27] covenant with man again because man in
[1:20:30] his best condition could never keep the
[1:20:34] word that I have so I'm gonna make a
[1:20:37] covenant with myself I'm not gonna make
[1:20:40] a covenant with man anymore
[1:20:43] because man even in his condition fail
[1:20:46] man in his authority he fell from his
[1:20:49] authority man with his jurisdiction he
[1:20:52] fell from his jurisdiction so God made a
[1:20:56] covenant to bring back things a
[1:20:58] different condition that physical please
[1:21:01] call Edom was not enough to have kept
[1:21:05] them so God envisioned a different place
[1:21:08] that man could live in where he would
[1:21:10] fall no more he couldn't make mistakes
[1:21:13] no more you don't hear me this morning
[1:21:15] so from all the way back there God hang
[1:21:19] out everything that would take place
[1:21:21] he planned every trial he planned every
[1:21:25] situation he plans for every prophet to
[1:21:28] come when they came he plan for the
[1:21:31] cheering of Israel to end up in Egypt he
[1:21:33] he wanted it that way because he had
[1:21:36] something to prove he was on a mission
[1:21:39] he had an objective he had a purpose the
[1:21:42] Bible tells us there is no accident with
[1:21:45] God there is no mistake with God there's
[1:21:47] no I didn't know how it happened with
[1:21:49] God with God it's all about purpose it's
[1:21:53] all about objective so when Moses was
[1:21:55] born there was a purpose for Moses being
[1:21:58] born when David was born there was a
[1:22:00] purpose for David be and Paul when
[1:22:03] Joshua was born there was a purpose but
[1:22:06] just what to be born when Pharaoh was
[1:22:08] born there was a purpose for Pharaoh
[1:22:10] when Nebuchadnezzar was born there was a
[1:22:13] purpose for Nebuchadnezzar when Judas
[1:22:15] was born he
[1:22:16] a purpose to everything yes a season is
[1:22:20] a time there's a purpose and you don't
[1:22:25] think God has a purpose for you you
[1:22:27] don't think God has a purpose for you
[1:22:29] being here this morning you don't think
[1:22:32] God has a purpose and a plan for your
[1:22:34] life that the devil cannot take away
[1:22:36] your body pains cannot take away
[1:22:39] sickness cannot take away your mistakes
[1:22:42] cannot take away your failures cannot
[1:22:45] take away your problems cannot take away
[1:22:47] your past cannot take away oh I'm gonna
[1:22:54] say a few things this morning but I just
[1:22:57] want to connect to yesterday before I
[1:22:59] talk about today so God had a secret
[1:23:02] mission and for this secret mission
[1:23:04] called understood oh that there are
[1:23:07] three realms as a heavenly realm there's
[1:23:10] the earthly realm and there's that realm
[1:23:12] of Hell and Hades and and and now all of
[1:23:14] that way the devil operates and the
[1:23:16] Bible tells us there was war in heaven
[1:23:18] so all the trials and the struggles we
[1:23:21] feasted he did not originate on earth it
[1:23:24] originates in according to scripture in
[1:23:26] heaven so the devil raised a rebellion
[1:23:29] in heaven but that rebellion was
[1:23:31] destroyed because Michael and his angels
[1:23:33] fought and the devil was kicked out of
[1:23:36] heaven he could no longer dwell in
[1:23:39] heavenly places he could no longer walk
[1:23:42] in heavenly places and he was kicked out
[1:23:44] of heaven and thrown onto the earth but
[1:23:47] the earth was not his jurisdiction
[1:23:49] the earth was not his realm so he ended
[1:23:52] up under it because when God please man
[1:23:54] in the earth he said let man have to
[1:23:56] minion over it that man have to minion
[1:24:00] in this realm let man have authority in
[1:24:04] this realm let man of authority over the
[1:24:06] animals that man have authority over the
[1:24:09] elements that man have authority over
[1:24:11] every creeping thing every walking thing
[1:24:14] every situation every obstacle
[1:24:18] had authority he had Dominion he had
[1:24:21] power Hugh ceylon in order for God to
[1:24:32] give man dominion it meant God had to
[1:24:34] have it to give it you cannot give what
[1:24:37] you do not have so when God gave man
[1:24:39] Dominion it was his power that he was
[1:24:42] sharing with man he did not give man
[1:24:45] power in heaven he gave man power on the
[1:24:47] earth and he cosines every check like he
[1:24:50] said to Peter whatever you bind on earth
[1:24:53] mine in heaven because if two shall
[1:24:57] agree touching anything it's a law of
[1:24:59] the contract of god but god realizes in
[1:25:04] your fallen condition you cannot do it
[1:25:06] all by yourself
[1:25:08] he put a feel safe that was not based on
[1:25:13] your condition to feel safe was not
[1:25:15] based on your mistakes
[1:25:17] it just said if you shall see that is
[1:25:19] motion and don't talk in your heart just
[1:25:22] say it I'll take care of the rest of it
[1:25:24] because it's a contract unconditional
[1:25:28] covenant
[1:25:30] [Applause]
[1:25:33] he may be seated so God in his realm in
[1:25:38] the realm of the heavenlies with angels
[1:25:40] in the realm of the heavenlies with the
[1:25:41] seraphim's in the realm of the
[1:25:43] heavenlies with the cherubims in the
[1:25:44] realm of the heavenlies his God is our
[1:25:47] angel says in Rose and he's looking over
[1:25:50] everything but there Branum said nothing
[1:25:52] happens in it that is not something
[1:25:55] simultaneously happening in heaven so we
[1:25:58] are meeting this morning here on earth
[1:26:00] and simultaneously there's a meeting
[1:26:02] going on in heaven it's a hidden meeting
[1:26:05] he can't see it what it's happening you
[1:26:10] don't have to feel it but it's happening
[1:26:12] one air whenever there's a meeting of
[1:26:15] sons of God on the earth there's a
[1:26:17] meeting going on in heaven because the
[1:26:19] angels of the Lord are dispatched they
[1:26:22] are watching what's going on there's a
[1:26:24] secret mission going on because whenever
[1:26:27] you speak because of who you are angels
[1:26:29] are dispatch to make it happen
[1:26:35] hallelujah I'm just laying a background
[1:26:38] I'm laying a foundation put on your
[1:26:40] spiritual hats this morning we didn't
[1:26:43] come to church just to have a meeting we
[1:26:45] didn't come to church because we want to
[1:26:47] be here for Easter Sunday it's got to be
[1:26:49] more than that we have to understand the
[1:26:51] true meaning of Easter we have to
[1:26:53] understand what happened when Jesus
[1:26:55] broke the barriers of death you may be
[1:27:01] seated
[1:27:04] I'm gonna band I'm type 57 of three
[1:27:07] Hebrew boys were in the fiery furnace
[1:27:11] daddy
[1:27:12] angels they were obligated the fact
[1:27:14] compelled to help the situation and
[1:27:17] that's what happens whenever you gets in
[1:27:18] trouble
[1:27:23] the moment the three Hebrew boys caught
[1:27:26] in the fire but the velum said the angel
[1:27:28] Gabriel around to the throne room and
[1:27:30] pull his sword out
[1:27:31] he said somebody's in trouble I don't
[1:27:34] know if you got the memo but somebody's
[1:27:36] in trouble I'm caught turn together
[1:27:38] let's see I've got this handle don't
[1:27:40] worry about it
[1:27:42] whenever you get in trouble angels start
[1:27:45] to draw their swords because you are
[1:27:47] royalty they are obligated to respond
[1:27:50] whenever there's a distress signal
[1:27:58] you may be seated for a minute a few
[1:28:03] days ago I called a government office
[1:28:05] it was around 8 18 in the morning
[1:28:08] between 818 to 8 21 in the morning and I
[1:28:12] got a voice message the office opens at
[1:28:14] 8:30 and my wife said to me don't expect
[1:28:18] that phone to get answered one minute
[1:28:20] before it and I thought about that for a
[1:28:26] while and I realize you know that's
[1:28:28] right when you want to get certain
[1:28:30] things done you have to wait on earth
[1:28:32] for the time that you're supposed to get
[1:28:34] it done you want to go and do business
[1:28:37] with the bank you have to wait until the
[1:28:38] bank opens
[1:28:39] you could be desperate you could bang
[1:28:42] down the bank doors you could do
[1:28:44] whatever you want that door not opening
[1:28:46] until the time comes but you know what's
[1:28:49] the difference with the kingdom of God
[1:28:50] it never closes it has no time off
[1:28:54] there's no opening hours they are not
[1:28:56] closing hours there's no moment the
[1:28:59] phone is not answered once there's a
[1:29:01] need you can call heaven any time and
[1:29:04] angels in the realm of the heavenlies a
[1:29:07] dispatch to the size and purpose of God
[1:29:10] that have a need
[1:29:16] can we preach a little bit this morning
[1:29:18] I don't know what's gonna do but I
[1:29:20] noticed one of you is tough for the
[1:29:22] pride you who are dead in here this
[1:29:24] morning
[1:29:25] this resurrection power to raise you
[1:29:28] raise you from your sin raise you from
[1:29:30] your depression you may be seated
[1:29:33] I don't know how the system works
[1:29:38] because my jurisdiction and realm is
[1:29:40] here in it but in heaven the Hebrew boy
[1:29:44] is in trouble and Gabriel he gets the
[1:29:46] alert I don't know it's a picture I
[1:29:48] don't know some people I don't know if
[1:29:50] it's a text message I don't know what
[1:29:52] technological system in the realm they
[1:29:54] use but he knew something was up
[1:29:57] and God said Gabriel and know you can
[1:30:00] handle it but the Branham said Gabriel I
[1:30:02] know you've done everything I asked you
[1:30:03] to do but I'm asking you this time don't
[1:30:05] worry about this one stand down but the
[1:30:11] random said when Kira was finished
[1:30:12] eating his kiss because angel wanted to
[1:30:16] come to help the angel wormwood who was
[1:30:19] the one who was responsible for the
[1:30:21] flood but the Branham said he was the
[1:30:23] one who was in charge of the water he
[1:30:25] said can I go and draw water under fiery
[1:30:28] furnace and God said no no no no no I
[1:30:32] don't want to out this fire one more you
[1:30:35] did a fantastic job with it in the days
[1:30:39] of Noah but I don't need an angel to do
[1:30:42] this I want to go myself to swap out
[1:30:46] this situation
[1:30:49] you may be seated and brother branham
[1:30:51] said I know he said this yesterday but
[1:30:54] some people missed it so we want to make
[1:30:56] sure we're all in the same and the same
[1:30:59] train because we are going somewhere
[1:31:01] there are certain prerequisites before
[1:31:04] you could go to the next level in the
[1:31:06] church hey man
[1:31:08] so by the Branum said that God stood
[1:31:10] here and he summoned the east wind he
[1:31:12] summoned the north wind he's summoned
[1:31:14] assault when he's summoned the west wind
[1:31:16] and he jumped upon her from the head and
[1:31:18] he had straight down into the fiery
[1:31:21] furnace and he was the fourth man in the
[1:31:24] fire
[1:31:25] it wasn't an angel it was the fourth man
[1:31:28] in the fire but the bottom said it
[1:31:31] needed a man to come now to redeem them
[1:31:34] it needed a man to come down to save
[1:31:37] them an Almighty God in all of glory he
[1:31:41] could not come in his glory to redeem
[1:31:44] man but he had to take on sixteen
[1:31:46] elements he had to take on flesh you may
[1:31:50] be seated
[1:31:52] hallelujah he had to feel what you feel
[1:31:56] he had to go through what you go through
[1:31:57] he went through every temptation there's
[1:32:01] no temptation that you ever have to face
[1:32:03] that he didn't face
[1:32:05] there's no tiredness that you face that
[1:32:08] he didn't face oh come on now somebody
[1:32:11] preach back to me I want to read it one
[1:32:20] more time
[1:32:21] Hebrews 2 verse 17 wherefore in all
[1:32:24] things he didn't see some things where
[1:32:26] the kangy in all things it behooves him
[1:32:30] to be made like unto his brethren so
[1:32:33] Jesus wanted to be made like unto you
[1:32:35] and I that he might be a merciful and
[1:32:38] faithful high priest in things
[1:32:42] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[1:32:46] for the sins of the people in other
[1:32:49] words he wanted to understand what we go
[1:32:51] through so when he makes reconciliation
[1:32:54] he is speaking from a position of truly
[1:32:57] experiencing what we experience so it's
[1:33:01] not God above who doesn't know what
[1:33:03] you're going through but as Jesus he
[1:33:05] went through the trials he went through
[1:33:08] the tests he went through the heartache
[1:33:10] he went through frustration he went
[1:33:13] through depression he went through
[1:33:14] hunger the Bible said he was tempted in
[1:33:17] every way that we attempted but he
[1:33:19] sinned not but upon his shoulders was
[1:33:22] placed all of our sins upon his
[1:33:25] shoulders was placed all of our mistakes
[1:33:27] upon his shoulders was placed every
[1:33:31] mistake you ever did everything you're
[1:33:34] doing wrong now every mistake you were
[1:33:36] ever do he took it up on his shoulders
[1:33:39] only his shoulders are kind of carried
[1:33:42] our sins only his shoulders could have
[1:33:45] carried our mistakes up because we
[1:33:48] weren't strong enough to handle it so it
[1:33:50] took our kinsman-redeemer it took
[1:33:53] somebody like us it took a brother
[1:34:01] hallelujah don't you know Jesus is your
[1:34:04] brother but he's also your father he's
[1:34:07] also your God he's also your King he's
[1:34:10] also your Savior he's also your Redeemer
[1:34:13] he's also your restorer he's also your
[1:34:15] way make up
[1:34:20] hallelujah hallelujah oh you may be
[1:34:25] seated
[1:34:25] so Jesus had a secret mission so he had
[1:34:29] to leave glory he couldn't come as
[1:34:32] spirit yet into the earthly realm
[1:34:35] because he had to deal with the
[1:34:37] situation as a man so God so loved the
[1:34:41] world that he and move he himself
[1:34:45] transformed himself he had to come as
[1:34:51] flesh and blood not a spirit not yet
[1:34:54] that time will come but not yet blood
[1:34:59] had to come because he had to win a
[1:35:01] battle on the earth so Almighty God left
[1:35:07] heaven and drop down on the earth of 16
[1:35:09] elements born in a manger born of a
[1:35:13] virgin what did God do
[1:35:16] God slipped a secret weapon onto the
[1:35:19] earth that the devil didn't even
[1:35:21] recognize what was happening
[1:35:24] [Applause]
[1:35:30] the greatest nuclear weapon the world
[1:35:32] ever saw was lying in a manger in
[1:35:35] Bethlehem
[1:35:38] [Applause]
[1:35:41] hallelujah the devil had come into Eden
[1:35:47] and upset God's kingdom but God did not
[1:35:53] want the devil to know how he was gonna
[1:35:55] fix the problem so whenever God starts
[1:35:59] something he always that small in for
[1:36:04] him to have the element of surprise he
[1:36:06] has to start small so he started as a
[1:36:09] baby and in your life for him to have
[1:36:11] the element of surprise he's got to
[1:36:14] start small some small changes some
[1:36:18] small movements some small deliverances
[1:36:21] some small signs some small wonders some
[1:36:25] small miracles or you don't hear me this
[1:36:27] morning you may be seated for a minute
[1:36:30] one time with a Branum pray for somebody
[1:36:33] the hand was crippled up
[1:36:36] [Applause]
[1:36:39] and they will it alone feet I'm gonna
[1:36:42] Brennan said here's what the person said
[1:36:45] my little fingers start to move he said
[1:36:47] if your little fingers had to move
[1:36:49] that's all you need because that small
[1:36:51] movement is a sign that little movement
[1:36:54] is common give me another example that
[1:36:58] little boy that Elijah said go and see
[1:37:01] if the rain is coming he went the first
[1:37:05] time he went the second time he went the
[1:37:07] third time he said oh gosh I see nothing
[1:37:10] but after the seven time he come back
[1:37:13] tired I don't know if he was working out
[1:37:15] or not but he came back tired he said
[1:37:17] Elijah I don't know what this means but
[1:37:20] I see a cloud it's a tiny cloud it's
[1:37:24] like a man's hand Eli just hit run one
[1:37:28] would run you know what the Bible says
[1:37:32] Elijah was not a young man but a
[1:37:34] Terrence but the Bible said when Elijah
[1:37:37] heard that he ran faster than horses
[1:37:40] don't tell me that is Holy Ghost thing
[1:37:44] doesn't make you do superhuman things
[1:37:50] radio Bible the Bible says that Elijah
[1:37:56] got to where he had to go before the
[1:37:58] horses got there it's you know one of
[1:38:01] two things and horses was doing this or
[1:38:04] Elijah was running so fast that the
[1:38:06] horses couldn't catch him and I'm seeing
[1:38:08] if the horses of hella after you if you
[1:38:11] see the sign this morning it could be a
[1:38:13] small time but the devil cannot catch
[1:38:15] you cannot move you cannot change your
[1:38:19] mind you may be seated
[1:38:23] [Applause]
[1:38:25] I don't know how long we're gonna speak

[1:38:52] hello baby baby crying baby wants milk
[1:38:58] and that baby no miracles yet no
[1:39:03] preaching yet but in that baby is the
[1:39:06] potential to turn over it in that baby
[1:39:14] is the potential to restore all that man
[1:39:17] lost and that baby is the potential what
[1:39:21] Abraham couldn't finish and Moses
[1:39:23] couldn't finish David couldn't finish
[1:39:25] Joshua couldn't finish
[1:39:27] Elijah couldn't finish in that baby that
[1:39:33] baby possessed all that he was wasn't
[1:39:36] that baby because all that God was he
[1:39:38] ported to Christ in that baby

[1:39:45] you may be seated growing up in the
[1:39:52] temple growing up in the church he's on

[1:40:26] Bible says we shall reign on the earth

[1:42:25] investigation he already decided you are
[1:42:28] the one he wants to be with oh god help

[1:42:35] of my flesh blown up oh you know here
[1:42:37] minute anybody knows what I'm talking
[1:42:40] about this
[1:42:42] [Applause]
[1:42:46] she may be seated
[1:42:48] ever see when somebody get engage decide
[1:42:54] to take pictures of the ring and they
[1:42:58] post it on Instagram because they want
[1:43:07] people to know I'm engaged I'm spoken
[1:43:12] for I'm with somebody I don't know what
[1:43:17] you were I'm with somebody and by the
[1:43:20] Branum said that before the foundation
[1:43:23] of the world he put an engagement ring
[1:43:26] based on predestination miss unsworn
[1:43:30] knowledge he elected you and said one
[1:43:33] day I'm gonna marry you
[1:43:35] [Music]
[1:43:38] you may be seated with the random taught
[1:43:45] us through every age they were elected
[1:43:49] that were predestinated so Court had to
[1:43:55] wait a long time for this particular
[1:43:57] portion of that lady imposed a that was
[1:44:05] ride and Martin's day there was bribe in
[1:44:08] our did his bride also to complete this
[1:44:12] whole image of God can the church say
[1:44:15] man everybody feeling fine so Jesus had
[1:44:23] a secret mission a secret ministry so
[1:44:33] everything he did was deliberate because
[1:44:38] you wanted to establish not himself but
[1:44:42] he wanted to establish man back in his
[1:44:44] position he was never the one out of
[1:44:47] position he made a choice to come down
[1:44:51] to earth to restore things or you don't
[1:44:53] hear me this morning it was man who lost
[1:44:56] his position Adam Adam weirdo
[1:45:03] it was not that God couldn't see where
[1:45:07] Adam ones but Adam had lost his position
[1:45:12] he had fell from his authority he had
[1:45:16] fell from his place and God purpose to
[1:45:20] restore it so Jesus is growing up in the
[1:45:25] temple growing up in the church and I
[1:45:29] preached it before and he's growing up
[1:45:30] just like a young person in the church
[1:45:32] nobody know he is that's Joseph's boy
[1:45:35] that's a carpenter's boy a fine young
[1:45:37] man is a nice lad you see that little
[1:45:39] table he made and they don't even know
[1:45:45] they're playing with nuclear weapon
[1:45:51] [Applause]
[1:45:55] you know whenever you're transporting a
[1:45:57] nuclear weapon they they put some sang
[1:45:59] on it warning signs God took the warning
[1:46:02] sign off for this one because he didn't
[1:46:04] want the devil to understand that it was
[1:46:06] a nuclear weapon yet slipped in until
[1:46:13] the time came for what God had a note to
[1:46:17] begin to be unfolded the Bible says he's
[1:46:20] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:46:22] so it means that this Bible what is
[1:46:25] written in here was actually planned out
[1:46:28] before it was even put into words form
[1:46:30] because it existed in God's mind so the
[1:46:34] Bible said the lamb was slain before the
[1:46:35] foundation of the world so if God is
[1:46:37] writing a diary before it happens in
[1:46:40] that diary he was right at the right
[1:46:42] time I'm gonna change form and come as a
[1:46:45] baby and I'm gonna be dropping her home
[1:46:48] and I'm gonna pick a young lady named
[1:46:49] Mary and she gonna be in kids a Joseph
[1:46:52] they want to think something wrong with
[1:46:53] him so I'm gonna comfort him and send
[1:46:55] the angel to tell him it's gonna be all
[1:46:56] right he's taken care of everything
[1:47:02] and in the plan is okay plan is seen one
[1:47:05] let Jesus begin to display who he is
[1:47:08] so on that day this is happening in the
[1:47:10] heavenlies but on earth normal service
[1:47:12] and the elders allowed a young man to
[1:47:16] come read the scripture you see young
[1:47:18] Jesus won't you come and Jesus quietly
[1:47:21] nobody knows who he is where the candy
[1:47:23] comes up he finds where it is written in
[1:47:25] the scripture accessory the Spirit of
[1:47:28] the Lord is upon me for he has anointed
[1:47:30] me to preach the gospel and I was
[1:47:36] reading and this is not something
[1:47:37] strange the young men they have this
[1:47:39] nice opportunity to to Blastoise but
[1:47:44] when Jesus finished any clothes to poke
[1:47:46] he said this they this scripture is
[1:47:48] fulfilled
[1:47:51] and I could imagine in the church he
[1:47:53] elders was like what in fact the Bible
[1:48:02] said they said to raise the question is
[1:48:04] not this Joseph's son quizzes this is
[1:48:10] not this is not Elijah's son this is not
[1:48:12] it's not it's not just Joseph's son but
[1:48:18] unbeknownst to the enemy I could imagine
[1:48:20] what the devil is saying about you
[1:48:23] is this not George honest it's not Jenny
[1:48:26] son is this not how come you talking
[1:48:29] about this D descriptives well how come
[1:48:32] you're talking about you gonna get the
[1:48:33] whole ego son you gonna be deliver you
[1:48:36] wanna be chaste
[1:48:42] The Devil's biggest mistake is the thing
[1:48:45] that your past and your family
[1:48:46] determines your future because the devil
[1:48:53] didn't understand the genetic code that
[1:48:55] Jesus had that he wasn't even from this
[1:48:56] the similar devil looks at you didn't
[1:48:58] realize you not from it we are strangers
[1:49:02] we are just passing through one of these
[1:49:05] days I'm gonna be missing one of the
[1:49:07] disease I'm gonna be caught if you want
[1:49:09] to stay here that's you but goodbye
[1:49:11] world
[1:49:12] good morning glory and the church shame
[1:49:16] [Applause]
[1:49:20] so in a drive this home this morning so
[1:49:25] Jesus had a secret mission everything in
[1:49:28] his public ministry is for the public so
[1:49:31] when he goes his first miracle that
[1:49:33] wedding in Cana where they ran out of
[1:49:35] wine Mary comes to Jesus that Jesus
[1:49:39] hears what he runs a wine she's like
[1:49:41] what I have to do with me but Mary had a
[1:49:49] revenue see she tell me brothers
[1:49:50] whatever this man see they do do it I'm
[1:49:53] just against some water and bring some
[1:49:56] water
[1:49:57] and when infested of poor water the
[1:50:00] water turned to wine with Antony not
[1:50:03] just wine you know but they say this
[1:50:04] wine so good because the customers you
[1:50:11] serve your best thing first so that
[1:50:13] means they were us of the best thing
[1:50:14] first of them they were the finish the
[1:50:16] best thing then the next best thing then
[1:50:18] he laughs he drags whatever say what's
[1:50:20] there everything finished really drink
[1:50:21] to check everything out go Angie lady
[1:50:24] water but the Branham said eventually
[1:50:26] that water would have met grapes
[1:50:28] eventually those grapes would have
[1:50:30] fermented eventually there would have
[1:50:32] been age over time but Jesus bypassed
[1:50:34] the whole process and put time on it so
[1:50:37] when they tasted it is he Whitner who
[1:50:40] seems the best wine for last
[1:50:44] but listen Jesus mission was not to turn
[1:50:48] water into wine they brought the blind
[1:50:53] they brought the whole they brought the
[1:50:55] lame that was public ministry he could
[1:50:59] have done it so he did and he would
[1:51:01] still qualify what he did by saying I do
[1:51:04] nothing except the Father show me first
[1:51:07] he goes to the Pool of Bethesda and they
[1:51:11] are hundreds of people sick and he finds
[1:51:13] one man and we said yesterday when he
[1:51:15] healed up man all of he'll get upset but
[1:51:19] that's what Jesus wanted because he
[1:51:21] wanted the devil to come after him
[1:51:24] because you wanted to overcome on the
[1:51:27] earth in this earthly realm he wanted to
[1:51:30] conquer in this earthly realm
[1:51:34] but Jesus also understood that the devil
[1:51:39] had the keys to death and hell and in
[1:51:42] order for Jesus to get the keys the
[1:51:44] death and hell he couldn't get it while
[1:51:46] he was in the earthly realm so when he
[1:51:49] said to his glory and came in flesh
[1:51:52] he also ought to shed flesh and leave
[1:51:55] his flesh on the cross and leave his
[1:51:57] flesh moving around but while he was in
[1:52:00] flesh on the cross and moving around he
[1:52:03] already left that body
[1:52:04] he had to be in a different condition to
[1:52:08] step into hell to walk straight up to
[1:52:12] the devil and say give me that keys give
[1:52:16] me the keys to death give me the keys to
[1:52:18] hell or you don't hear me this morning
[1:52:23] and the Branum said Jesus left hell with
[1:52:27] the keys on his waist the keys to death
[1:52:31] and hell so Easter Sunday morning
[1:52:34] nobody knew that this was going on when
[1:52:38] the disciples met Jesus they didn't know
[1:52:41] that he had went down and taking the
[1:52:42] keys he knew he said he was gonna be
[1:52:45] raised up and even he didn't even
[1:52:47] believe it Thomas who see Jesus walk on
[1:52:51] water
[1:52:52] Thomas who saw all the miracles say I'm
[1:52:54] not gonna believe until I touched a mere
[1:52:57] prisoners hand
[1:53:01] because when Jesus had nobody ever done
[1:53:04] before
[1:53:04] he said I have power to lay my life down
[1:53:08] and pick it back up again
[1:53:12] [Applause]
[1:53:14] so he already had power over death but
[1:53:22] he wanted to release his people who are
[1:53:26] in fear of debt
[1:53:27] he wanted a release Abraham and Ezekiel
[1:53:31] and Daniel and everyone who are tied who
[1:53:34] the devil had locked him up somebody
[1:53:39] brings back to me and he wanted to let
[1:53:41] you know that death is nothing to fear
[1:53:43] because I live you live also but more
[1:53:47] than that I took the keys I took the
[1:53:50] keys of death and took the keys of hell
[1:53:52] I took the keys of the grave Oh
[1:53:56] hallelujah you may be seated Halloween
[1:54:05] so said yesterday it's like having a
[1:54:08] house your house is your realm and your
[1:54:11] keys is your jurisdiction because you
[1:54:15] have keys to your house you can open
[1:54:16] your house and you can walk in anytime
[1:54:19] you want because you have keys for your
[1:54:21] house and when you go to your house you
[1:54:23] can lock the door and when you lock the
[1:54:25] door you keep elements outside and you
[1:54:28] keep yourself safe on the inside so the
[1:54:31] devil is in RL as we seen to that
[1:54:33] RL monkey pants because he has a house
[1:54:36] but he has no keys he can lock anybody
[1:54:39] in and he can stop anybody from getting
[1:54:42] out he has to watch people go in and out
[1:54:45] a door because he have no keys to
[1:54:47] control nothing because Jesus took the
[1:54:50] keys
[1:54:50] [Applause]
[1:54:56] so whatever situation you are in this
[1:54:58] morning there's no devil can hold you
[1:55:00] back because it never can lock you up
[1:55:03] Jesus already unlocked it and he has the
[1:55:06] keys
[1:55:07] [Applause]
[1:55:12] you're healing already paid for your
[1:55:15] deliverance already paid for the Holy
[1:55:17] Ghost already paid for your baptism
[1:55:20] already paid for your adoption already
[1:55:23] in motion and no demon or devil those
[1:55:26] Spirit has stopped you somebody say man
[1:55:32] [Applause]
[1:55:35] Oh glory glory glory glory glory
[1:55:45] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so the
[1:55:53] same way God had a secret mission that
[1:55:56] the world didn't see didn't understand
[1:55:58] couldn't relate to he has a secret
[1:56:00] mission going on in your life right now
[1:56:02] that the devil doesn't understand he
[1:56:05] can't figure it out because you are
[1:56:07] supposed to be dead you are supposed to
[1:56:09] be defeated you are supposed to be a
[1:56:11] statistic but here you are this morning
[1:56:14] giving God praise giving God thanks and
[1:56:16] the word is coming to you in a real way
[1:56:19] to remind you that you come from God and
[1:56:21] you go back to God those are not just
[1:56:23] words but you come from God and you're
[1:56:26] going back to God hallelujah
[1:56:29] somebody say man this morning we
[1:56:32] celebrate the resurrection of the Living
[1:56:34] King Confucius is dead Muhammad is dead
[1:56:38] Buddha is dead every other God is dead
[1:56:41] but Jesus Christ is alive an Easter
[1:56:44] it means our freedom it means our
[1:56:47] restoration
[1:56:48] it means our attention Easter means
[1:56:50] Pentecost Easter means a super church if
[1:56:54] some means another
[1:56:55] Ephesians
[1:56:58] these two also means that God once again
[1:57:01] changed form
[1:57:04] he was spirit he became flesh
[1:57:07] he changed fall again went down into
[1:57:10] hell change form again in a glorified
[1:57:12] body transform himself as Holy Spirit he
[1:57:20] may be seen it man was in the Garden of
[1:57:26] Eden and he was pushed out I eaten then
[1:57:29] the whole of the Old Testament was
[1:57:30] speaking about a natural land so it was
[1:57:33] always being in a in a location in a
[1:57:35] position so in Eden in the land but when
[1:57:39] Jesus came he changed a whole
[1:57:42] geographical thing for you and he give
[1:57:45] you a new land of promise call the land
[1:57:47] the Holy Ghost he also called a lampion
[1:57:50] in Christ so he said if any man be in
[1:57:54] Christ he's a new creature
[1:57:56] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[1:57:59] them that are in Christ Jesus you don't
[1:58:02] hear me this morning but listen when he
[1:58:05] was father you couldn't be in him in
[1:58:07] that kind of a way when he walked on the
[1:58:09] earth you couldn't be in him because he
[1:58:11] was flesh but now that he is spirit and
[1:58:13] he represents the land of promise though
[1:58:16] you could step into that land no wonder
[1:58:18] he can say the same works I - you shall
[1:58:21] do also an exacta you wanna know I'm and
[1:58:24] the father he and me are you you Oh
[1:58:28] somebody help me the strong
[1:58:36] hallelujah
[1:58:37] [Applause]
[1:58:39] so Easter meant all that Adam lost could
[1:58:43] now be restored Eastern now meant that
[1:58:47] there was a higher law that is to prove
[1:58:50] that there was a higher law because the
[1:58:52] law said it because you fell in sin that
[1:58:54] you are finished
[1:58:55] the law says because you made a mistake
[1:58:57] you can stand the law found a woman
[1:59:01] caught in the act of adultery and when
[1:59:09] Jesus walked past you see a Lord this
[1:59:11] woman was caught in the very act and
[1:59:13] everybody happiest tones and 1/4 the law
[1:59:16] if she is caught she should be stood
[1:59:18] Jesus didn't refute the law he doesn't
[1:59:21] listen whoever don't have sinned by one
[1:59:27] means cast the first stone
[1:59:29] after that Jesus don't embarrass anybody
[1:59:31] he turned his back and when you look
[1:59:34] back around he's a woman where are your
[1:59:36] accusers everybody suddenly realized
[1:59:39] that something more important to do than
[1:59:41] stone this is turning anointed left them
[1:59:46] stoning inspiration yes yes value no I
[1:59:49] don't feel inspired as soon anymore
[1:59:51] because he addressed the sin issue he
[1:59:54] see when man fell he fell into sin into
[1:59:58] sickness into death and he lost his
[2:00:01] inheritance so when Jesus came he had to
[2:00:04] come to restore everything so he came to
[2:00:07] turn sin over because for all of the
[2:00:11] time since man fell they offered bulls
[2:00:13] and goats as a sacrifice because God is
[2:00:17] merciful so he said if you sin let the
[2:00:20] lamb take your place but that was only
[2:00:24] temporary because that lamb blood was
[2:00:28] only covering the sin but Jesus came to
[2:00:32] dissolve sin all together
[2:00:38] not to cover the sin anymore
[2:00:40] but by his blood he brought Redemption
[2:00:43] by his blood he brought cleansing by his
[2:00:46] bloody poor transformation by his blood
[2:00:50] so what the devil didn't realize is that
[2:00:53] when Jesus came it wasn't just a healer
[2:00:55] because the cheerin official they had
[2:00:57] testimonies they knew what Moses did
[2:00:59] didn't you about Elijah in knew about
[2:01:02] miracles it wasn't like miracles was
[2:01:03] foreign to them but when Jesus came it
[2:01:07] is what he did in combination that upset
[2:01:11] the kingdom of Hell forever because he
[2:01:14] paid the price for sin permanently no
[2:01:16] more you need gorton cheapen plus he
[2:01:20] broke the veil from top to bottom
[2:01:23] brought the power of the priesthood say
[2:01:26] no you were priests you of direct access
[2:01:28] to God so he dealt with the sin
[2:01:30] situation he tells me the access
[2:01:33] situation he does with the sickness
[2:01:35] situation because the blood also came to
[2:01:37] take care of your sicknesses and then he
[2:01:42] changed our spirit to deal with your
[2:01:44] nature and then he took the keys of
[2:01:47] death and hell to let you know that
[2:01:50] you're not gonna die that death can't
[2:01:54] hold you
[2:01:55] the grave can't keep you so by the time
[2:01:57] Paul gets there he said death where is
[2:01:59] your sting grave where is your victory
[2:02:02] you've already been broken oh come on
[2:02:06] now so this morning we live by a higher
[2:02:09] law
[2:02:12] we don't live by the law of nature we
[2:02:14] don't live by the law of the world we
[2:02:17] live by the law of God we live by the
[2:02:19] law of the FT we live by the law of
[2:02:22] resurrection power we live by the Lord
[2:02:24] at 35 gravity we live by the Lord to
[2:02:27] divide depth and divide sickness and if
[2:02:30] I somebody give God a shout of praise
[2:02:34] you belong to call this morning
[2:02:37] Oh hallelujah and because you belong to
[2:02:40] him he will do whatever it takes to get
[2:02:43] you back he's not gonna leave you he's
[2:02:46] not gonna leave your family he's not
[2:02:48] gonna leave you in the house of the
[2:02:49] enemy you belong to God you bet you

[2:06:59] and anyway knows what what is this
[2:07:02] retail therapy they say when you shop

[2:07:09] so I'm inviting you to go shop the
[2:07:12] grocery of the Lord this morning and

[2:07:25] only place I can find peace this is the
[2:07:29] only place you can find happiness in
[2:07:33] normal grocery to sell alcohol they sell
[2:07:36] cigarette that's right think of your
[2:07:37] temporary high but in this grocery where
[2:07:41] it's enjoying in a permanent high joy
[2:07:46] unspeakable full of glory when you take
[2:07:50] this joy pill and this gospel and this
[2:07:52] happiness pill you can lose your job and
[2:08:00] still have joy the devil confuse you may
[2:08:06] be seated
[2:08:07] I don't care how bad things get listen
[2:08:10] friends no matter how tough things got
[2:08:13] in your life you still eat something
[2:08:15] isn't that right because the Bible said
[2:08:17] I've never seen my seatback bread God
[2:08:20] will work things out for you to eat
[2:08:23] every day he promised to supply all your
[2:08:26] need and what you need in this hood is
[2:08:29] temporary because we are leaving this
[2:08:32] earth to go to a place way at all have
[2:08:35] to eat no more you don't have to cry no
[2:08:37] more don't have to feel me no more
[2:08:40] that's what Jesus died for and when he
[2:08:43] rose again he proved that that couldn't
[2:08:46] hold him
[2:08:49] [Applause]
[2:08:54] hallelujah Oh glory glory glory so when
[2:09:03] Jesus rose again he opened the door into
[2:09:07] the land of the Holy Ghost by pouring
[2:09:10] out his spirit up to when Jesus died
[2:09:12] Peter and they still struggled the
[2:09:15] disciples still had hard times when
[2:09:17] Jesus died he went back fishing because
[2:09:21] they need to have not yet been changed
[2:09:22] you go all the church services in the
[2:09:25] world and I wouldn't change your nature
[2:09:28] it could change your behavior
[2:09:30] temporarily but once you're out of that
[2:09:33] atmosphere you go back to how you used
[2:09:35] to be but God wants the place of
[2:09:40] permanent solution not a temporary
[2:09:43] solution the blood of bulls and goats
[2:09:46] was a temporary solution but when Jesus
[2:09:49] died he brought a permanent solution
[2:09:51] committed Church is a temporary solution
[2:09:53] but one of these days he says you're
[2:09:56] going to be in Christ not in church but
[2:09:58] in Christ and in Christ you are a new
[2:10:01] creature not temporary not one day I'm
[2:10:05] up not one day I'm tone not I fighting
[2:10:08] my way back there's no fighting no we're
[2:10:10] back when you are in Christ you are in
[2:10:13] Christ
[2:10:14] when you are in Christ demons know
[2:10:16] you're in Christ when you're in Christ
[2:10:18] the devil is afraid of you you maybe see
[2:10:27] that I'm not gonna be too much longer
[2:10:29] listen the devil still hasn't recovered
[2:10:31] you know the deficit I recover you know
[2:10:37] but the random taught us that when Jesus
[2:10:39] was in the wilderness being tested and
[2:10:41] he said it is written it is also written
[2:10:42] his written it is written is also
[2:10:44] written it was like electric volts in
[2:10:46] the devil he said the devil went on a
[2:10:50] vacation I don't know who he left in
[2:10:53] charge but either way three first season
[2:10:57] and that wasn't even power it was just a
[2:11:01] word you don't hear me this morning so
[2:11:05] the devil may have just been
[2:11:06] recuperating from his vacation where he
[2:11:10] went to get therapy for what Jesus did
[2:11:12] in the wilderness when he concocted a
[2:11:15] plan to crucify Jesus and the devil
[2:11:18] taught that this was his sweet revenge
[2:11:21] but he finally was able to get Jesus to
[2:11:23] die because you have got me around today
[2:11:26] and your God intended to die and every
[2:11:29] time the Danijela celebration
[2:11:33] the devil's not the plan in celebration
[2:11:36] when the toil because he had to get
[2:11:38] Jesus if he could just kill Jesus it was
[2:11:41] all his trouble vanish and he would
[2:11:44] prepare for his next target he was used
[2:11:46] to it
[2:11:47] in centuries you doing this he knew
[2:11:49] David he knew Arahama he know Joshua you
[2:11:52] know Elijah every man will come he will
[2:11:54] battle with him and if a time is your
[2:11:57] gosh who shoosh and then the next one
[2:12:00] will come and he was used to it he was
[2:12:03] accustomed to it
[2:12:11] and when Jesus died the devil took there
[2:12:13] was just like Iran I'm just like David
[2:12:19] so could you imagine where it is the
[2:12:23] Sunday morning
[2:12:27] [Applause]
[2:12:31] when it ever realized this one is
[2:12:33] different
[2:12:35] this one was dead but yes Dan debt
[2:12:41] listen you may be seated the problem
[2:12:44] worse than any dine doesn't what he
[2:12:47] never told was supposed to happen the
[2:12:50] problems to get back up you imagine the
[2:12:55] confusion and when you kill him you
[2:13:02] Calculon McGann and then Jesus as mother
[2:13:06] Antony push on Friday night start to
[2:13:09] open up the better pottery plan he
[2:13:12] wanted to reproduce himself
[2:13:16] [Applause]
[2:13:19] you may be seated you have to understand
[2:13:23] it's not good starter this is it that
[2:13:26] was added it but we will finish it I
[2:13:32] have a say little I are looking for
[2:13:34] trouble but if trouble come we'll deal
[2:13:35] with it and when the devil came in cause
[2:13:40] Eden God see fine take it
[2:13:42] good I would owe it because I'm eternity
[2:13:49] the devil was created so he belongs to
[2:13:52] time so time doesn't move God he's from
[2:13:55] eternity he steps in and out of time to
[2:13:58] eternity for his purpose so when Jesus
[2:14:02] came and rose again no TVs two of the
[2:14:05] plans had to unfold here comes Peter
[2:14:07] here comes James here comes John they
[2:14:11] afraid for their lives but they
[2:14:13] rejoicing in their heart because they
[2:14:15] could read recall how Easter made them
[2:14:17] feel
[2:14:18] but Jesus left them didn't really
[2:14:22] understand why he left their
[2:14:23] understanding was open but he knew
[2:14:25] something was gonna happen didn't even
[2:14:26] know what it meant and the devil when
[2:14:29] Jesus left his evil whoosh he died he
[2:14:31] rose again he'll at least he left could
[2:14:36] imagine the devil went through a really
[2:14:38] an emotional time in
[2:14:40] I've been a Billie policy a porn ever
[2:14:44] did everyone emotion he had to deal with
[2:14:46] all these miracles he healings and
[2:14:49] deliverances and Jesus died he got
[2:14:52] temporary relief and Jesus rose again he
[2:14:54] gets a cardiac arrest and then and then
[2:14:58] Jesus left if you level that's about
[2:14:59] himself I'm gonna Brandon said like this
[2:15:02] he said when they were in the upper room
[2:15:03] the devil wasn't bothered he used to
[2:15:06] people making noise something he was
[2:15:08] there when they were shocked in Hosanna
[2:15:09] that didn't bother him but he said when
[2:15:11] pizza walked out of the Upper Room and
[2:15:17] went by he had called beautiful and saw
[2:15:20] the man who he knew because he was lame
[2:15:22] for a long time I'm Peter who made
[2:15:26] mistakes Peter who denied Christ Peter
[2:15:30] who chopped off the man is only a short
[2:15:33] while ago it wasn't like Peter was a
[2:15:35] long-standing believe lock just a short
[2:15:38] while ago Jesus just died and rose again
[2:15:41] Peter just got delivered but all of a
[2:15:44] sudden he the deceased silver and gold I
[2:15:47] don't have but such as I have
[2:15:50] he wasn't praying for it he said such as
[2:15:53] I have I give it all to you
[2:15:58] brother branham said Red Alert stop the
[2:16:02] happenin Hill wha-wha-wha Malone
[2:16:06] I told Jesus bed they said it looked
[2:16:08] like he multiplied himself he talked
[2:16:10] looking like Jesus James looking like
[2:16:12] Jesus John looking like Jesus
[2:16:17] [Applause]
[2:16:23] Oh somebody help me this morning and
[2:16:29] listen listen
[2:16:31] this never even happen with Jesus but
[2:16:34] Peter is walking and the Bible says
[2:16:36] people were being healed in Peters
[2:16:38] shadow the greatest weapon the world had
[2:16:46] ever seen was slipped as a baby right
[2:16:49] under the devil eyes and then the devil
[2:16:51] thought he had pizza listen you ever see
[2:16:58] this when Peter went back fishing when
[2:17:00] Jesus died you'd ever see look at him
[2:17:02] they couldn't even look Chee and a half
[2:17:04] years look at him go beyond the veil
[2:17:08] beyond the eyes there was a
[2:17:10] transformation there was a sea that was
[2:17:11] planted in Peters soul that the devil
[2:17:13] couldn't pull out and all of Peters
[2:17:16] mistakes and failures couldn't take that
[2:17:19] seed out of his soul he took a backslide
[2:17:22] even in Matthew 16 Jesus turned to Peter
[2:17:26] and say get behind me Satan
[2:17:28] and that didn't even touch the seed that
[2:17:31] was in Peters soul the seed and Peter
[2:17:34] saw was destined for the upper room and
[2:17:36] the ceiling your soul is destined for
[2:17:40] your Upper Room experience
[2:17:45] [Applause]
[2:17:48] come on was finished Oh hallelujah how
[2:17:55] is this possible Peter was always a part
[2:18:00] of God just like Jesus he was pleased
[2:18:07] there for a purpose
[2:18:11] just like Jesus he was there for a
[2:18:13] purpose a part of the mystery that God
[2:18:17] was unfolding Peter didn't know it
[2:18:20] Peter growing up as a fisherman had no
[2:18:23] idea that there was a higher purpose for
[2:18:25] his life the same way every one of us in
[2:18:28] here have a revelation it is a higher
[2:18:30] purpose for our lives and no devil no
[2:18:34] depression no demon could stop that
[2:18:36] purpose from being accomplished and we
[2:18:38] are in fishing balls this morning
[2:18:40] swimming around life thinking we are in
[2:18:43] control and gold I just waitin waitin
[2:18:45] waitin until like Sol he could drop you
[2:18:49] from offer your horse and give you a
[2:18:51] burning bush experience give you an
[2:18:55] experience with transform your soul that
[2:18:58] you who are free to testify will
[2:19:00] suddenly be able to testify that it is
[2:19:03] all over me and it's keeping me alive
[2:19:06] you need to testify on your job testify
[2:19:09] in your home testify in your school how
[2:19:12] you made it
[2:19:13] testify that you have your own
[2:19:15] resurrection experience that you have
[2:19:17] your own restoration experience you had
[2:19:19] your own deliverance experience that you
[2:19:22] are just a man but behind us can feel is
[2:19:25] a seed of God that has a destination at
[2:19:28] his glory we shall not all sleep but
[2:19:32] it's gonna be a rapture there's gonna be
[2:19:34] a deliverance there's gonna be a wedding
[2:19:36] supper glory to God can the church say
[2:19:40] man
[2:19:41] Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:19:47] my my my I'm almost finished the
[2:19:50] musician to get ready so let's just
[2:19:53] touch this here when the Sabbath was
[2:19:57] passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the
[2:19:59] mother of James and Salome had brought
[2:20:01] sweet spices that am i come to anoint
[2:20:04] him and very early in the morning the
[2:20:08] first day of the week they came unto the
[2:20:10] sepulchre at the rising of the Sun and
[2:20:12] they said among themselves who shall
[2:20:14] roll us away the stone from the door of
[2:20:16] the sepulchre and friends didn't come
[2:20:20] expecting to see Jesus not there they
[2:20:23] came to unknowing the body they came out
[2:20:26] of reverence and respect and brother
[2:20:29] branham tempted he said the devil I
[2:20:30] tried to bind the wood Jesus the word
[2:20:34] they put a stone you know where to put
[2:20:35] the stone there they put the stone
[2:20:38] because they were afraid because they
[2:20:41] heard the rumor going around that
[2:20:42] children are raised from the dead so
[2:20:44] they put a store in a very big stone not
[2:20:47] only they put a stone but they put God's
[2:20:53] because therefore afraid by the irony
[2:20:56] that the disciples will come and take
[2:20:57] the body and say you see he rose from
[2:21:00] the dead so they put a stone and they
[2:21:04] put guards to make sure that a true man
[2:21:08] doesn't come to pass but how you could
[2:21:12] put a stone if God pulled Lazarus
[2:21:16] od grave if he walked on do you know
[2:21:20] sometimes one Davie the other thinking
[2:21:21] you know if somebody has power to say
[2:21:25] peace be still
[2:21:26] if he has power to take five loaves and
[2:21:29] two fishes and feed 5000 if he has power
[2:21:33] to raise Jairus daughter if he has PAHO
[2:21:39] a stone and a few men clearly didn't
[2:21:50] think it through but it was a good
[2:21:52] effort and the devil has made a good
[2:21:55] effort to try to put a stone in front of
[2:21:58] your life and try to put guards to stop
[2:22:02] your resurrection
[2:22:08] but the my Bible tells me I don't know
[2:22:11] about yours but my Bible tell me if that
[2:22:13] seems spirit that raised Christ from the
[2:22:18] dead dwells in you and dwells in me it
[2:22:23] should represent type of reaction like
[2:22:31] when Jesus was here so if you put Jesus
[2:22:37] and put us strong and put men and if you
[2:22:40] put put a Jerome behind stone and Men
[2:22:43] and the same spirit that was in Christ
[2:22:45] Jesus is in him what stone what man what
[2:22:50] nature what situation what sickness
[2:23:09] he may be seated
[2:23:13] [Music]
[2:23:16] that stone brother Jerome was the very
[2:23:20] fullest witness of the resurrection
[2:23:27] so whatever stone if it's a stone of
[2:23:30] sickness this morning that sickness will
[2:23:33] be the first witness of your
[2:23:35] resurrection if it's a problem in your
[2:23:38] marriage that stone will be the first
[2:23:41] witness of your resurrection if it's
[2:23:45] what's going on any with your children
[2:23:47] with your family that stone will be the
[2:23:50] first witness that you are not dead
[2:23:55] [Music]
[2:24:01] [Music]
[2:24:13] but the random said it ladies if Christ
[2:24:16] the wood has been placed in your heart
[2:24:17] and the devil tries to block that life
[2:24:21] in you from being lived out so he would
[2:24:24] please stones to try to block that life
[2:24:28] from coming out but this morning we
[2:24:31] asked a question like this who will roll
[2:24:34] away the stone because those sisters
[2:24:37] came to unknowing Jesus and they
[2:24:39] themselves couldn't move the stone but
[2:24:42] the angel of the Lord he came to move
[2:24:45] the stone from their lives and the angel
[2:24:48] of the Lord is here this morning to move
[2:24:50] the stone from our lives so that you can
[2:24:53] walk out victorious walk out as an
[2:24:57] overcomer walk out as a conqueror
[2:25:00] because he is the Conqueror we are also
[2:25:03] now more than conquerors so it's time
[2:25:09] that we begin to act like more than
[2:25:12] conquerors and the very action of moving
[2:25:16] like conquerors starts to get the devil
[2:25:19] so afraid that he has to let you go
[2:25:22] because he doesn't know how much like
[2:25:24] him you really are I'm to protect
[2:25:27] himself he has to stand far away lest he
[2:25:31] get the same kind of response that Jesus
[2:25:33] gave him because the devil didn't even
[2:25:40] know who Jesus was and if he couldn't
[2:25:43] even figure out who Jesus was how will
[2:25:46] you know who you even
[2:25:48] to the devlins being cautious this
[2:25:50] morning he is trying to see if he could
[2:25:54] pin you down but like the Bible says if
[2:25:56] you resist him he has to flee because
[2:25:59] this is your jurisdiction this is your
[2:26:02] realm this belongs to you and it's just
[2:26:08] a matter of time before the resurrection
[2:26:11] power which is the dynamics strikes the
[2:26:15] mechanics words seen in your soul that
[2:26:17] has been preached for all these years
[2:26:20] by a vindicated prophet that a message
[2:26:23] of deliverance to speak and Easter for
[2:26:26] the bride because the bride hasn't had a
[2:26:28] revival yet she hasn't had a
[2:26:31] resurrection yet but it's coming that
[2:26:33] scene has been in the ground for a long
[2:26:35] time and the devil think you are over
[2:26:38] the devil think you are finished but you
[2:26:41] are gonna make it on any day now it
[2:26:44] could be today you can break out of that
