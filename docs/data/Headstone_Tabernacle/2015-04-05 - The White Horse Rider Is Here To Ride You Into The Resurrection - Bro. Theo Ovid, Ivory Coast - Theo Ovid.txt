We had some tabernac uh I want to really thank brother Paul his wife the church for this privilege to be here to rejoice with you because we are going somewhere we are not from Ivory Coast I'm not from Trinidad it's just the flesh man it's just the flesh man from there But we come from somewhere and we are on our way to somewhere. We are going away to glory. Hallelujah. Good morning. Glory. Goodbye world. We we be leaving here one day. Isn't that something? Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. I really want to thank all the ministers for coming out, you the believers. my friend here, brother Etien. Thank him for the translation and these mighty men of valor on the platform. Brother Olu and brother Conte, I call them mighty men of valor. Warriors of the faith. Brother Bannon prayed that prayer. Raise up mighty men. Raise up mighty warriors of the faith. and pray that prayer. Not weak men. Not men without backbone, not spineless men, but strong men, warriors of the faith, men who are not afraid. Men who could stand. Men who could speak fearlessly the word of truth. man that is empowered to set the people free. That kind of man, God call man. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Praise God. So, we want to go into the word. Could we stand? We want to read Isaiah 61 verse one and two. Isaiah 63 1 verse verse 4. And Revelation 19 verse 11- 16 says we read Isaiah 61 verse 1 and two. The spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek. He had sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, the opening of the prison to them that abound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn. Isaiah chapter 63:4, "For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come." Revelation chapter 19. reading from verse 11. And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he did judge and make war. His eyes was a flame of fire. On his head were many crowns. He had a name written that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood. And his name is called the word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, when with it he should smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron. And he treadth the wine press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God. And he had on his vesture on his thigh a name written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Let's bow our heads a prayer. Almighty God, we love you tonight and we thank you for your word. Your word have life and strength and power in it. We pray you interpret your word among us. Confirm your word with signs, wonders, miracles, heal the sick in our midst tonight. May virtue, powerful service be released among the people tonight in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Oh, praise God. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Have a title. The white horse rider is here to ride you into the resurrection and have an inspiration. The third pull. Praise God. We thank God for the message this morning. A call to the resurrection and a call to the resurrection is a call to perfection. Because if there's no perfection, there is no resurrection. We are going to be perfect. It takes perfection to bring on the resurrection. Isn't it right? A call to the resurrection is also a call to become the white horse word. Did you hear that? We have to become the white horse word that the white horse rider could mount us to come upon us and ride us into the resurrection. There's going to be a word prayer. There's going to be a scriptural prayer. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are going to become the word and the spirit will come upon you because the spirit comes upon the word. The spirit is not coming for interpretation. The spirit is not coming from enda. The spirit is coming upon the word. And that's what Jesus said. The spirit is upon me. Who is he? He is the word. His name shall be called the word of God. We going to crown him. We're going to crown him. King of kings. Lord of lords. Oh, glory to God. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, blessed. You may be seated. It's amazing how the Bible could say, "The year of my redeemer has come. and vengeance is in my heart. You know what that means? The year of the redeemed. It means he going to redeem your soul. He going to redeem your spirit. He going to redeem your body. That's what it means. It means there's going to be a rapture. It means that we are leaving here. Oh, glory to God. Amen. You may be seated. This is brother Brandham. from the breach. He said, "This book is a mysterious book. It's a book of redemption." And when the seven angels begin to sound, he winds up the loose ends and the mysteries of God come down from God as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God. Now, you may be seated. Now, listen to this. The prophet who wrote the word that the song of the seven church age the loose ends that they probe that will be wound up together. Here we go. And when the seals are broke and the mystery is revealed, down come the angel, the messenger, Christ setting his foot upon the land and sea, the seventh angel is on the earth at the time of his coming. What does that mean? The Lord has descended. Africa. Africa. Are you hearing me? [Applause] William Brham. William. He came to introduce Messiah. Messiah is on the air. [Applause] Oh my. You may be seated from uniting time and sign. What the madam said, God sent the seven seals and give us a sign by air and send seven angels out of heaven to come to bring back that scattered word in them denominations and tie it back into the world to bring down the Holy Spirit to the seven angels that came from eternity. They came to gather up all the loose, all the scattered way. It has to come back to the world, the full way. Hallelujah. Do you understand? seven angels. In other words, the Holy Spirit couldn't come back until the entire world was restored. The voice of God was in seven ages. God and was the gather all the seven parts to bring back one voice, the voice of the archangel. and William Brana that Elijah was sent to introduce Messiah. Messia is on the earth. The pillar of fire is on earth. The pillar of fire is here tonight. The pillar of fire is upon you. [Applause] Glory. Hallelujah. Praise God. Blessed. You may be seated. Hallelujah. Brother, is this the time sir? He said Revelation 3 and 4. Revelation 10 3 and 4. Seven thunders. Notice they brought forth those voices with one foot upon the land, one foot upon the sea. But if the ministry of the mysteries is finished, then what of those seven mysteries coming forth? in a homaly church like ours that almighty God has come and regarded the lowest of his people. You say, "I don't think so. It might not be." But what if it is then time has run out? It may be later than you think. Brother, say it again. Your message will wind up the loose ends. Listen and introduce the Messiah before his coming. Messiah before the coming. That's not some man's. That's not some man. That's the mighty angel. The one with the swept back wings. The one with the seven seal. That's the Messiah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory. You may be seated. From feast of the trumpets. Brother Brandon and brother spoke a little bit on it. Go into the prophet's chamber. Watch them seven steps. Where did the God meet the challenge to bring the come the presence of the king at the top of the step on the seventh step and that shows the same spirit that was upon John had introduced a Messiah? We have got to come to a place something that's going to introduce Messiah. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Now here it is. How will you know the Messiah unless you are consciously in the word? You have got to know you have to be in the word because the Messiah comes according to the scripture for the time and season. Every scripture have a time and season. everything under the earth according to Ecclesiastical 3. There's a time and season for everything under the sun. There's a time for you to be healed. There's a time for you to be healed. There's a time for you to be delivered. There's a time for you to be filled. And I am believing today is that time. Now is that time. There's a time for God to come amongst his people. There's a time for God to bring a shaking shaken on the earth. Maybe it will start here right in ivory coast. A shaking a power coming amongst the people where man will speak the word. Man will speak the word and it will flash like that. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. What is it? It's the third P. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham and proven his word. He said he is the word is not right. Revelation the 19th chapter coming bride and groom. His vesture dipped in blood. His name is called the word of God. He is the quickening power. He is the Holy Spirit. That's the dynamics to come to your mechanics. He Christ is the quick power. He is the Holy Spirit. You shall receive power. When when the Holy Spirit come upon you, then you're going to be a witness. The Holy Ghost, not shake some minister hand. The Holy Ghost, not believe some teachings. The Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost and fire. Holy Ghost and power. Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost. Same old time singing. Same old time shouting. Same old time preaching. Glory. Wow. from harvest time. Brother Brandham said the word it's a chain and you are hanging over hell by one word. You hang over hell. When you're walking on the word, you're walking on a bridge. If you break that word, you will fall into hell. We stand on the way. man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes out the mouth of God and the mouth of God is not some fivefold the mouth of God is the prophet and the fivefold could only echo what the prophet have said we are not following men we are following the word as spoken by a prophet like the party prophets. You may be seated. The five-fold and the people will become the voice of God will become the voice of God in the last days. But men, imposttors, impersonators, want people to follow them. We are not called to follow a group, no group, no group. We called to follow the world. Oh, glory to God. God call Israel as a nation. But the Gentiles, God scatter us across the world to call us as individuals. That is why you have to hear your name. It's not a group name. It is your name. And when you see your name, you're going to get your anointing. See, because your anointed coming to you, Jesus said, The spirit is upon me. This is my anointing. The spirit upon the word for the hour. Brother Brandham said it this way. Man shall hang over hell by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God. Second Timothy 4. It says, "I charge you before God. Preach the word. Be instant in season. Rebuke, reprove, exalt with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come." Here we go. The time will come that they will not endure sound doctrines but after their own lust. There's a lust in them to hear new things to hear mysterious things to hear things the prophet didn't speak. Hallelujah. The time will come that they will their door sound doctrine, but after their own lust shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears, and they shall turn away from their ears from the truth, and shall be turned into fables. Paul warned them. Be careful of those teachers that bringing all kind of crazy stuff to stimulate your intellect, to stimulate your mind. And afterwards, you start to believe in fables. Oh glory, Acts 20 verse 27. Listen what it says. Paul said, "I have not shunned to declare unto you all the council of God. Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost had made you overseer to feed the church. For I know this, after my departed, grievous wolves will enter in among you. not sparing the flock. [Music] Listen to Paul also of your own selves in your own inspiration, of your own selves. Men shall rise up speaking perverse things to draw disciples after themselves. Therefore, watcher and remember for three years. I cease not to warn you night and day. So poor. I was to warn the people of wolves, of snakes, of evil workers, of false prophets, of false pastors, of men that God didn't even call. Oh, hallelujah. You have to warn them. And if Paul warned them, we going to warn you of men with lying spirits. They should be out of the pullpit. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be seated on the fourth seal. Brother Brandham. Now the antichrist is on a pale horse mixed colors. A horse represents a power. It is national powers, religious powers, demon powers, all kind of powers. That's a mixed horse. But Christ is on a solid white horse. Christ is on a solid white unadulterated word from the beginning. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. So, brother Brandham was preaching about Christ being that pure word, unchanging word, original word, not mixed with interpretation, not mixed with men's idea. That's the white horse. and listen to his prayer. Lord, how thankful we are. I'm so glad, so happy for you and your people. You purchase our salvation on Calvary. Lord, try us by your spirit. And if there any be evil among us, any unbelief of the word, any person in here that would not punctuate every promise of God with an amen, may the Holy Spirit come down now, the white horse rider. The prophet identify the Holy Spirit as the white horse rider. [Applause] So you are going to be the word. You are going to be the word that the Holy Spirit going to ride down to the resurrection. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. So that means a bride has to become the white horse word. Isn't that right? The third pull, opening of the word. Praise God. Oh my. You may be seated from the seventh seal. Brother Brandham, he said, "If you want to do something, don't tell anybody about it because Satan will hear it." Now, watch. I I I have people do a certain thing and watch the devil try to cut it off. Here we go. This is good. Satan will try to impersonate. He will try to impersonate everything that the church will do. We notice through the antichrist. But this is one thing. He cannot imperson it. There will be no mimics to it because he don't know it. There is no way for him to know it. It is the third P. So church we have come to a spot what we are breaking into. There is no impersonation nowhere. They cannot impersonate it. Oh hallelujah. He said he listen he knows nothing about it. See, he doesn't understand it. [Applause] You may be seated. So, brother Brandham in vision he said, "I see the light in his 10 vision. I see the light. Leave me and go into the building." And a voice said, "I will meet you in there." And that will be the third pole. Why? It will not be a public show. And all the things he said connecting to the third pole have a scripture to identify. So he identify five things at the third pole. Number one, the 10 vision, the scripture. I will meet you in there. The prophet got Matthew 66. When thou prayest in thy closet, shut thy door, pray to thy father which is in secret, and thy father which seek shall reward thee openly. Superas Matthew 6 and tie that in to the 10th vision. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Number two, he identify the spoken word as the temple. Before the doctors and touches my wife, the tumor will go down. That's the spoken word. In the scripture in Mark 11:23, if you shall say to this mountain, be moved and don't doubt in your heart, you can have what you say. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Number three, he identified the king sword as the third power. The king saw not a king but he king. The king saw and he identified. S John 15:7 if he abide in me and my words abide in you. Ask what you will. He identify. Hebrews 4:12. The word is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. You may be seated. Number four, he identified the third P as the opening of the word scripture. Luke 24 verse 27 at beginning at Moses and all the prophets speaking about Jesus. He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. Luke 24:45 then open their understanding that they might understand the scriptures. That's the scripture for the word being open. And the last one, number five, souls in prison. And the scripture, first Peter 3, verse 18, for Christ suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust that he might bring to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the spirit. Here we go. by which also he went and preached into the spirits in prison which sometimes were disobedient. Oh hallelujah. Could we give the Lord a hand of praise? Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham, sir, this is a time I know James said greater, but you couldn't do nothing greater. You could only do more. He was one person. Now he's in a whole church now. More than this shall you do. For I go to my father. is is if this is the temple then there's a great ministry liner here. Oh glory to God. So first was little birds. Isn't that right? Then was doves then the third was angels. And from indictment he said may they come for a revival of the just. Here we go. and great power come among the church. So we can expect that tonight because that's a promise. That's a promise. We can expect the sick to be healed tonight because this is the word here. This can't fail. Listen to this. May there come a revival of the just and great power come among the church just before it's going. Listen, it's not hard to pray that because you promised it and we are looking Lord for that third pull that we know will do great things in our midst. Oh hallelujah hallelujah brother Brandham I'm looking for the third pull for something to happen to start that third pull and if we want to see that third pull really do among us it's a coordination with every one of us to humble ourselves before God confess our wrong and pray for these things oh hallelujah oh hallelujah oh glory glory oh glory Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham, he had a first pull healing. He had a second pull prophesying and rebuking spirits and he had a third pull to open the word. Isn't that right? He had that ministry. And the bride will have that ministry. So you cannot just say first P. He's sweet. He's not talking doctrine. Son of righteousness. A rise of heal on his wing. He is going everywhere. Everybody love brother Brown. Everybody love the prophet. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He even using the word trinity among them. But after a while, I hold back no more. Trinity is of the devil. He said there is no part in the Bible like God said trinity. He start to bust them. He start to rebuke them because he was coming into the message. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. In other words to catch the bride. You know what caught you? takes the third pull to pull the bride. Only the bride. [Applause] You may be seated. One time Jesus had 82 disciples. Once Jesus had 82 disciples. And when Jesus give a word, eat my flesh and drink my blood, 70 walk away, 12 remain and one was a devil. Isn't that right? But watch when he died and rose from the dead in his resurrection ministry. He only came to his elect. I I'm not hearing you. When Jesus rose from the dead, he didn't appear to no make believer. He didn't appear to no unbeliever. He appeared to his disciple that was going to get power. Jesus, the voice of the archangel, the third Bible, the open of the word. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Understand this. When Jesus died at Calvary. That was Friday. Saturday. It looks like nothing happened. Nothing happened. Jesus went down to the souls in prison and he had to preach. I am the man Noah was talking about. I am the [Applause] man. So all all the proud and arrogant in this message have to hear the gospel preached. Oh my. The bride is not waiting for signs and wonders to confirm who they are because the revelation places you who you are reveals to you who you are. When Godam said when the door is shut, God will anoint the church. In other words, when the redeemed is coming forth, vengeance is coming forth. When the redeem is coming forth, the wrath of God is coming forth. And Jesus when he read that scripture in Isaiah 61, he left he leave out a part to declare the day of vengeance of our God. No man could declare that. No man could accomplish that. When Christ feeling a bride, eyes of fire out of the mouth, a two-edged sword, the word of God, the world going to be shaken, rocking under the impact of the word being spoken word by word by word. So brother is speaking. A woman lives in worldly pleasure is dead while she is living. And if she rejects mercy, she can cross the separating line and there's no place for her no more. And what when she cross that line, there is no way to come back. But There's got to be a ministry preached to her. The ones that cross the land still have to be preached to the ones that don't believe they have to hear it. That's why Jesus said, war, rumors and war, not yet. Amen. Amen. Earthquakes, not yet. But this gospel must be preached and then shall ye come. And the gospel is not in word only, mysteries only, deep teachings only. The gospel is in power and demonstration. The gospel is the demonstrate the power of God. I suspect you. So said there's got to be a ministry preached to her. But remember at that time, it's over. It's done. It's just a haunting. The lamb took the book. His redemption is over. Jesus first preached and was rejected and went and haunted those that were there that could not repent. No time for salvation. That same ministry will have to repeat again. What if that could be the third pull to the eternal loss? Oh glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. His temple, Jesus staple was when he preached to the lost who could not be saved no more. That's why you should be shouting and praising God for the blood of redemption. [Applause] You do you realize that the bride will be God's representative on the earth? [Applause] After a while, you get nothing except through the bride. But Brandham said, "By and through the bride, by and through the bride will be accomplished." All that was spoken. The bride, Mrs. Jesus, the elected have to pick up scripture that Jesus did not finish. The pride have to pick up the day of vengeance of our God. The pride have to pick up a hidden mystery. In Revelation 22:17, Revelation 2:17 is a hidden mystery. In the time of judgment, the voice of God into your family, go into your loved ones. The spirit and the bride, they come. Whosoever will [Applause] come, not speaking in tongue. Not by dancing in the spirit, not by joining church. It's by the word living. If they only looked, he was Messiah. He was the living word made manifest. Manifest. Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to God. The third pearl was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that been sealed in the word and the mysteries of God come down from God as the word of God and reveal the whole revelation of God. The mysteries of God don't come down and say as mysteries once it come down it becomes word and when we preach the word we are preaching the mysteries to you the mysteries going past the intellect mysteries the voice of God speaking to your soul the mysteries not addressing your spirit your flesh but the mysteries coming to fit inside your soul But Jesus told the disciples. Jesus told the disciples the mystery is this. The word is a seed. It's how you know the mysteries. This the beginning of the mysteries. You got to know the word. It's a seed. And if the word which is a seed, it's the good soil is going to bring forth. [Applause] So, brother Brandham, I'm about to close. He said, "I've got my mind set on this message." That's that third pole. And it's the one I must be loyal and reverent to. So, this third pole when he preached to the Lord, they couldn't be saved no more. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory tree is perfection. The ministry comes to its perfection when it reproduce Christ again in the natural amongst human being. Men claiming to be God. Men claiming to be the Holy Ghost. Men claiming all kind of stuff. But brotherham said tree is perfection. The ministry comes to its perfection when it reproduced Christ. We saw Christ in William R. You could take any book and see how we live, how we acted, how we treated people, how he forgive, how we restored, how we pray. You can read that. That is Christ. You have to see that reproduce itself. I think I think people forget what Christian is. I think people for Christian is what you could talk. I think people people no longer receive a live voice is the thunder that shakes the devil. It look like the more we talk we think the devil is shaking with that. The devil just laughs at that. He he laugh at them in the upper room. He said they just having a good time. They just stagger him. They looking like drunk men. Satan said, "Don't bother with them." But then Peter walked out. You can't stay in the upper room. You got to walk out. You got to walk out. You got to walk out. That's when things begin to start. When we walk out and we are walking out the [Applause] next when Peter walked out the upper room on his way, he saw the man. Everybody knows that man. Everybody accustomed giving coins to God. Everybody knows that man. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And Peter doing what you're accustomed to do. He put his hand in his pocket and that apostle was broke. He had no money. He eas said go. I don't have what I have God gave me. And what God gave me, I can give you. Rise up and walk. Listen. When that was done, those demons said, "You see that? You see that? That's Jesus again. We thought Satan sought but we killed the man but it looked like his spirit his spirit is now upon other men Jesus multiply himself. Oh, the devil is in trouble. The devil is in trouble. The devil is in trouble. Listen to this. Listen to this. The devil can't get stronger, but you can. You can get stronger. Let's go. Watch the Pentecostal can impersonate anything that can be done. But when that time comes, when the squeeze come down, what you have seen temporarily will be manifested in its fullness of its power. He is prophesying. What I am doing that's temporary but when the bright time come when the year of the redeem come when the time of power come when the anointing strike when the dynamic strike has come when the spirit comes upon the breath. Understand this soul. The soul sealed. The soul sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The seed inside the soul. Your spirit sealed. Seven spirit replacing your human spirit. There's only one thing left. the redemption of the body. So what going to happen? There's going to be fire on the inside and God represent charity. Charity fire on the outside and your body in a moment in a twinkle of an eye shall be saved. Oh glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm going to close with this final quote.
