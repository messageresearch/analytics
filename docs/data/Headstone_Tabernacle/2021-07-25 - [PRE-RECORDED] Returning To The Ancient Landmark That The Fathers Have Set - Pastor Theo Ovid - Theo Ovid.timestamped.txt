[42:28] i can have notes here i have 30
[42:30] something pages here but i don't know
[42:31] where i'm
[42:32] going to today i have something upon my
[42:34] heart though praise god
[42:36] return to the ancient landmark that the
[42:39] fathers have set
[42:41] there was something about history and
[42:42] about grandfather and great grandfather
[42:44] and the fathers is there something about
[42:46] that hallelujah the old time ways
[42:50] the old pathways as brother solomon
[42:52] natina preached
[42:53] earliest night in ghana the old pathways
[42:56] there's something about that
[42:57] that is original no wonder why he goes
[43:00] in a prophet he said he shall turn the
[43:01] hearts of the children back
[43:03] to the faith of the fathers you can't go
[43:05] forward until you go back
[43:07] you have to pick up what the father's
[43:08] had become with the fathers as
[43:10] original how about young people want to
[43:13] do their own thing and they're not
[43:14] taking advice or counsel from the
[43:15] fathers
[43:16] they feel the father is old school well
[43:18] old school almost
[43:19] more wisdom than new school yeah
[43:22] mathematics and
[43:23] and engineering all kind of stuff but
[43:25] the fathers have the experience
[43:27] oh glory to god so god they're bringing
[43:29] something new he bringing back what the
[43:31] fathers had
[43:32] because fathers had the original word
[43:35] the original life
[43:36] the original power the original glory
[43:39] that's what the fathers have
[43:41] and we backfired from that but god said
[43:44] i will restore
[43:46] and the devil have to hear that and get
[43:48] nervous
[43:49] because god going to restore not only
[43:52] will god restore what is
[43:54] promised but he will restore you
[43:57] i'll hear you i am here yeah
[44:00] i am here there's a promise over your
[44:03] life
[44:04] a full restoration
[44:11] full full restoration
[44:14] [Applause]
[44:17] god's so good he said all that the
[44:19] kangaroo had left
[44:21] oh i will restore to you all where they
[44:23] eat though
[44:24] i'm going to bring it back i'm going to
[44:26] bring it back i'm going to bring it back
[44:28] you're going to get a bumper cup you're
[44:30] going to get doubled for your trouble
[44:31] oh glory to god don't get me started
[44:35] this morning
[44:36] hallelujah hallelujah get to miss
[44:38] tattered this morning
[44:44] glory
[44:45] [Applause]
[44:49] this is no time to say nobody knows the
[44:51] trouble i've seen they're not amazing
[44:53] that you know
[44:54] this he said no i'm not no i have not
[44:56] seen no heirs have heard
[44:57] the glory and this is time to quote the
[44:59] scripture my god
[45:01] the present suffering is not worthy to
[45:03] be compared with the glory that shall be
[45:05] revealed
[45:09] this is time to quote that
[45:11] [Applause]
[45:14] and if you're not in trouble now you're
[45:15] in trouble
[45:18] let me say it again if you're not in
[45:20] trouble you're in trouble
[45:22] you may be the devil leaving you alone
[45:24] something wrong maybe on the devil's
[45:26] side
[45:28] because when you see you're on god's
[45:30] side it's troubles his accidents his
[45:32] disaster
[45:34] his war is all kind of upset these
[45:36] things they can't even explain
[45:38] because the devil is mad because he have
[45:40] no chance of becoming a manifested son
[45:42] he missed himself up there oh gloria he
[45:45] was sunday morning
[45:47] all kind of music and everything else
[45:48] and he had a thought in his heart to be
[45:50] like the most high

[45:56] revolutionaries and boxes and spirits

[49:41] i love god i love the word
[49:44] i love his people i love the cause that
[49:47] is why i will fight the way i fight him

[49:55] that's why when you don't even look and
[49:57] you're looking miserable and you look at
[49:58] the press and whatever it is i didn't
[49:59] look at you
[50:01] i believe in god for you sometimes if i
[50:03] keep looking at you i will walk off the
[50:04] property and don't preach
[50:06] but because i know that there is
[50:08] something inside of you
[50:10] i know that's not how you always will be
[50:13] i know the potential that lays within
[50:15] you and i am here
[50:17] to activate to motivate to inspire to
[50:20] annoy

[50:27] all glory to
[50:28] god no no no no you are not going to
[50:31] remain as you
[50:32] are you're going to become what god

[50:36] oh hallelujah
[50:44] you'll be seated
[50:54] the labor for his name he said anything
[50:56] you can't do in jesus name leave it
[50:57] alone
[50:58] you can't take a drink in jesus name you
[51:00] can't play cards in jesus name
[51:01] you can't say smarty joke in jesus name
[51:05] you can't cuss in jesus name
[51:09] [Applause]
[51:10] subconsciously
[51:13] you don't want to say amen you know who
[51:15] you are
[51:19] whatever you do in the word or deed do
[51:21] all
[51:23] in the name of jesus christ hallelujah
[51:27] so jesus said i have something against
[51:28] you these are nice believers you know
[51:30] because they're making them apostles who
[51:31] say they are not sweat
[51:35] now this wasn't the pastors doing that
[51:37] channel ordinary believers
[51:39] you know what i stand up you're not
[51:40] saying what paul say
[51:42] paul said this
[51:46] that ordinary believers because then
[51:48] believers know the word challenging
[51:50] apostles
[51:51] mighty man of god oh yeah let me hear
[51:54] what that angel is saying
[51:57] because if that angel is saying what
[51:58] what what the prophets say
[52:00] that angel has to run you know
[52:06] hallelujah god will present a prophet to
[52:09] the generation for naught
[52:11] the prophet is not another preacher
[52:13] another exalter
[52:15] a kind of evangelist on a higher level
[52:17] that is not a prophet you know
[52:18] a prophet this prophet we're talking
[52:20] about here is one of the stars
[52:23] in the right hand of almighty god
[52:25] eduardo star
[52:26] and little steiner they don't have seven
[52:28] and a half you know
[52:30] if you only have one star in every age
[52:34] and all them seven stars in the right
[52:36] hand of god
[52:38] or give the lord a shout so when their
[52:41] men speak they're not speaking their
[52:42] thoughts
[52:43] they're speaking thus says the lord and
[52:45] we are resting on that
[52:47] we are resting on god says the lord
[52:49] we're not resting on our dream
[52:51] we're not wrestling our opinion we're
[52:53] not resting on your feeling
[52:54] we're not even resting on your prophecy
[52:56] because prophecies will fail
[52:58] but thus here the lord can fail
[53:14] he said you held my name i appreciate
[53:16] that i commend you for that
[53:18] i've seen your trident who see the
[53:20] apostles and so forth
[53:21] from their lives they don't cope with
[53:23] the word i appreciate all of that
[53:25] but there's something i got against you
[53:27] that is
[53:28] you left your first love
[53:31] but the bible says charity covers are
[53:32] much of their sins
[53:35] so when somebody running around exposing
[53:37] someone exposes one there's no charity
[53:40] that is you trying to say you better
[53:42] than that one
[53:43] because the pharisees say i am not like
[53:45] that man outside there he don't do this
[53:47] he do i ain't doing this and i doing
[53:48] this you know
[53:49] you know what i did lord you know
[53:50] between you and i how we just go down
[53:55] that man outside saying lord another
[53:57] word they're coming
[53:59] remember me do you say that man also
[54:00] more righteous than that one
[54:02] that man is it's close i am dumb
[54:06] you see my responsibility is so sharp
[54:10] but the man on the outside is more
[54:12] righteous
[54:14] so he sees a hot thing amen
[54:22] that's why god can say about man from my
[54:24] own heart jake god knows even when come
[54:26] the birthright jacob not compromising
[54:28] with us at all
[54:29] he's a trickster for everything else we
[54:30] see that he don't make joke with that
[54:32] that that that that is the baptism of
[54:34] the holy ghost
[54:34] that is me rolling on the floor that is
[54:37] me carrying on that's me staggering like
[54:39] a drunk man
[54:40] don't play with that i don't want to be
[54:41] too holy and to be churchy
[54:43] i want to be amen i want to be in the
[54:45] spirit like john was in the spirit
[54:47] i wanted people to move if the pressure
[54:52] could move on you can't move something
[54:53] wrong with you
[54:54] if the pressure could dance and you get
[54:56] down something wrong with you if the
[54:57] people could shout and you cash out
[54:59] something wrong with you
[55:00] because i'm leaving your shelter not
[55:02] even here dancing i live in your
[55:03] praising my god
[55:07] [Music]
[55:08] [Applause]
[55:13] the saints have to come back to the
[55:15] first love for the old-fashioned type
[55:17] meetings
[55:18] for the holy ghost type meetings not the
[55:21] no take and meet his holy ghost meeting
[55:23] you can always play back the tape and
[55:24] take all your notes home but
[55:26] when you come here you better come to
[55:28] worship i have been in convention when
[55:30] ministers don't want to worship
[55:31] and when people were saying god they're
[55:32] right and they're writing nothing don't
[55:34] need scribbling screaming because they
[55:35] don't want to stand up
[55:36] they don't want to pray that that is not
[55:37] our nail but they're beating the people
[55:39] to worship
[55:40] or give the lord a shout but we don't
[55:42] want to hear spirits in the water here
[55:43] boy spiritual water boy
[55:45] fire fire fire and a man saying put a
[55:47] little water here put the water away
[55:49] there's no real fire man
[55:50] the real fire man is go in the front you
[55:52] go in front with the fire hose
[55:54] facing the fire oh give the lord a shout
[55:58] oh glory to god i can't tell you to

[56:10] can't praise god
[56:12] i have to be able to praise and worship
[56:13] my god abraham built the altar

[56:30] mouth
[56:31] and give god

[57:00] [Music]
[57:06] maybe he sees that that's one of the
[57:08] better speeches in ghana
[57:11] when abraham when abram was about to
[57:13] offer
[57:14] isaac and the lamb was there he called
[57:16] the priest yo vagiera
[57:19] it's not god's name if he call it and
[57:21] god approve it
[57:25] god approved his name as to go by tyra

[58:58] let's go this girl a person when i
[59:01] prayed god a long time
[59:07] all right now here we go he said no uh
[59:10] something against you
[59:11] you left your first love you left that
[59:13] love that you once had
[59:14] for them good old-fashioned holy ghost
[59:17] meetings
[59:18] this is what i want to have they were
[59:20] going standing over see on top that
[59:22] power our prayer gonna drop a faster
[59:33] somebody said if he had fast he wouldn't
[59:35] last
[59:40] oh yeah you know why we're going there
[59:43] we're going back to the landmarks
[59:46] that the fathers have said
[59:50] paul talk about fasting often all that
[59:53] is part of the landmarks
[59:55] i know the modern generation get away
[59:57] from that they don't know whether some
[59:58] of them know
[59:59] we're fasting again
[1:00:03] all right so you begin to kind of
[1:00:06] backside
[1:00:07] into that formal thing
[1:00:10] you know and people sit back and relax
[1:00:12] and they believe pastor bringing the
[1:00:13] bread
[1:00:14] and the manna and here i keep operating
[1:00:16] a big creepy any puppet
[1:00:18] and he's just pulling out bread doing
[1:00:20] giving out bread and i don't know bread
[1:00:22] listen i do have a message you know i
[1:00:24] preaching another man's message
[1:00:27] let me say it again i don't have a
[1:00:28] message enough god
[1:00:30] said behold i send you
[1:00:34] the entire world elijah
[1:00:39] the prophet and he will do something
[1:00:42] i like what he said that you see you
[1:00:44] have to translate that
[1:00:45] when he say he he gone but he is his
[1:00:48] message
[1:00:51] [Applause]
[1:00:53] that's the conversion the people just
[1:00:54] missed like we read something
[1:00:57] thinks wednesday night about ezekiel
[1:00:58] bone god brought ezekiel to the vagia
[1:01:01] dry bone and said can these bones live
[1:01:02] question that's a scary thing you bring
[1:01:05] our man a bunch of bones your bones are
[1:01:06] even connected together only bones
[1:01:08] like bonesville bones country and said
[1:01:11] can these bones live
[1:01:13] well is he smart
[1:01:16] he didn't fresh and just run his mouth
[1:01:18] and say ah
[1:01:20] he said don't know it
[1:01:24] i i i don't know but but you know
[1:01:29] then then because he can relax himself
[1:01:31] and say you know god tell them prophesy
[1:01:34] say unto these bones that you shall live
[1:01:38] i will cause bread to come into you
[1:01:41] watch bread community bones is the final
[1:01:43] product
[1:01:44] but it have a process to get the bread
[1:01:49] so when god said he shall turn the house
[1:01:51] of the children back to the faith of the
[1:01:52] fathers there's the process
[1:01:54] and how he will do that
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:02:00] so when god pronounced something over
[1:02:02] your life is the process to get to what
[1:02:04] is pronounced
[1:02:07] [Applause]
[1:02:12] it doesn't change what he has pronounced
[1:02:15] let me give an example god told samuel
[1:02:18] go to the house of jesse and anoint me a
[1:02:21] king he didn't say a boy
[1:02:26] he's a king god seen david mature
[1:02:30] on the throne god saw david kingship
[1:02:34] david is still a boy here qualified to
[1:02:36] settle not thrown yet
[1:02:37] but god he anointed him
[1:02:44] no he's anointed you have to go through
[1:02:46] the process
[1:02:48] to reach where the anointing has pleased
[1:02:50] him
[1:02:52] [Applause]
[1:02:56] so god can pronounce things over you but
[1:02:59] then there's a process to get there
[1:03:01] in between where you are and where you
[1:03:03] are to be here come satan
[1:03:05] lying to you everybody clear
[1:03:09] come on read back to me help me help me
[1:03:11] somebody
[1:03:13] where you are and where you want to be
[1:03:15] here come the devil
[1:03:16] talking to you because you're not there
[1:03:18] yet yet
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:21] you reach there yet but you're on your
[1:03:28] way
[1:03:32] maybe he said that's that's what i do
[1:03:36] with what man saying because man didn't
[1:03:38] give the prophecy
[1:03:40] and i wouldn't let a man speak into my
[1:03:42] life who not authorize to speak in my
[1:03:44] life
[1:03:45] don't let nobody speak into your life or
[1:03:47] don't authorize to speak in their life
[1:03:48] they may speak the wrong thing into your
[1:03:50] life
[1:03:50] and you may happen to believe that
[1:03:51] person and that person could be a liar
[1:03:54] or god and a liar speaking their life
[1:03:56] and mess up your life you don't want
[1:03:57] that
[1:03:58] you want the right person to speak into
[1:04:00] your life and that right word must be
[1:04:02] it must be the word
[1:04:06] that woman in the world what everybody's
[1:04:07] telling see she's there she died they're
[1:04:08] talking about her she
[1:04:10] newspaper she's the talking whatsapp on
[1:04:12] facebook all kind of stuff like that but
[1:04:14] jesus was the one to speak into her life
[1:04:16] you say woman if you know who speak to
[1:04:18] you you will ask me for water to drink
[1:04:20] and the water i give you will spring up
[1:04:22] at the everlasting life
[1:04:24] she said give me of that water or give
[1:04:26] me get the lord i shout
[1:04:28] then jesus said he that believe it on me
[1:04:30] as the scripture had said
[1:04:32] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[1:04:34] living water
[1:04:34] [Applause]
[1:04:38] so god always wanted it to be personal
[1:04:41] and
[1:04:42] internal oh glory to god let me say it
[1:04:44] again
[1:04:45] god always wanted to be personal and
[1:04:48] internal
[1:04:49] he never want no god to be an a man he
[1:04:52] wanted
[1:04:53] in his people oh give the lord i shout
[1:04:56] that man god was jesus word made flesh
[1:05:00] to multiply and bring other sons or give
[1:05:03] the lord a shout
[1:05:05] you are not normal people you are sons
[1:05:07] and daughters of the living god
[1:05:12] [Music]
[1:05:16] called to a higher order a higher life
[1:05:21] [Applause]
[1:05:24] if god had that against this church he
[1:05:26] got it against that one too
[1:05:28] because you left your first love i've
[1:05:29] got it against you i have something
[1:05:31] against you that's my complaint
[1:05:32] you once had a great time you let the
[1:05:34] world begin to creep in

[1:05:38] you're still holding my name
[1:05:40] you're still doing things that is right
[1:05:42] you got a lot of patience and so forth
[1:05:44] you labor like a mule just labor and
[1:05:46] work you left grace and faith and power
[1:05:49] and swap it for labor and works
[1:05:52] i tell you about the brandon i help
[1:05:54] every greater woman i can that's a good
[1:05:56] thing
[1:05:56] i commend you for that but where is the

[1:06:42] they're gonna pay fifty percent
[1:06:45] that is not already talking at all joy

[1:07:00] in your spirit

[1:07:11] time they wanted a wife long time let
[1:07:12] them get to hustle they get white

[1:12:47] and got cobwebs in it
[1:12:48] you read love stories and news and
[1:12:50] things the people who are more in tune
[1:12:52] with the news
[1:12:54] number the bible and the promises of god
[1:12:56] see and things that ought to even be
[1:12:58] allowed to be published
[1:13:00] put out for the trash can and we
[1:13:01] penetrate people pick them up and just
[1:13:03] left over them like a bunch of flies in
[1:13:04] a garbage can
[1:13:06] he said what we need is back to our
[1:13:07] first love
[1:13:09] back to pentecost and after ephesus
[1:13:12] where you see they lost their first love
[1:13:13] the next age is smoother
[1:13:15] and the words will not come from
[1:13:18] bitterness root of bitterness coming
[1:13:22] into them this church the main church
[1:13:24] the big part the majority of them was
[1:13:25] hammering against the holy ghost ruling
[1:13:27] in the church
[1:13:29] and they wanted to rule themselves they
[1:13:30] wanted to set up a priesthood
[1:13:32] they wanted to act like the old
[1:13:34] testament they wanted priests
[1:13:36] and how we classify ourselves we got our
[1:13:38] organization denominations standing in
[1:13:40] class
[1:13:40] and we got grandchildren it's that been
[1:13:44] took in by adoption so forth we don't
[1:13:46] have isn't this bad
[1:13:48] we don't have the whole line
[1:13:51] of pentecostals that used to
[1:13:54] die out and really come true with god
[1:13:57] that genuine faith
[1:14:03] so in those old days it wasn't come to
[1:14:05] church and baptize another saint
[1:14:07] ain't the saint yet
[1:14:10] until that same prayer true and
[1:14:12] breakthrough
[1:14:16] and we're not talking about doing casual
[1:14:17] prayer where you're listening to your
[1:14:18] own prayer and you're listening to how
[1:14:19] you're praying to god not that
[1:14:21] the prayer coming from your heart sign
[1:14:24] talking about them polish praying oh and
[1:14:25] you know
[1:14:26] you're quoting all these things god
[1:14:27] wanted here and that do you want god to
[1:14:28] hear you you know
[1:14:30] but i had talking and i'm outgoing
[1:14:36] today god can come along and escape that
[1:14:39] you know you say
[1:14:40] you you had too much teaching looking
[1:14:43] for new light
[1:14:46] that's the problem in yesterday people
[1:14:48] are too much are teaching
[1:14:50] and they're looking for what teachers
[1:14:51] they know the bible said they would be
[1:14:53] having itching ears
[1:14:55] because he prays hard die not his heart
[1:14:59] yes getting in the spirit that's hard
[1:15:01] listening to teachers and teaching
[1:15:03] that's easy
[1:15:09] as long as you have a man of the hour
[1:15:11] bringing some teaching or whatever easy
[1:15:12] listen to him
[1:15:17] if he falls god help you
[1:15:22] but when you understand this word
[1:15:25] is to become activated in your life
[1:15:29] hold it hold it and the man or the
[1:15:31] teacher can activate it to you
[1:15:34] then your faith comes a little different
[1:15:37] because you ain't coming just to hear a
[1:15:39] man
[1:15:39] you're coming for the spirit to activate
[1:15:42] the way that the man is preaching
[1:15:44] you want that to come alive in your
[1:15:46] spirit in your heart
[1:15:48] and your soul
[1:15:52] so you ain't comfort letter you come for
[1:15:55] a reality
[1:15:56] [Applause]
[1:16:03] so i'm gonna skip and skip a lot of
[1:16:05] stuff
[1:16:10] so it had left his first love leaving
[1:16:12] his first love of the word of god was
[1:16:14] revealed to us
[1:16:15] as having fallen from his origin which
[1:16:16] was pentecost
[1:16:18] in plain english that means this church
[1:16:21] was in danger of being taken away from
[1:16:22] the leading of the holy spirit
[1:16:24] the control of the spirit this was
[1:16:26] exactly what took place after moses that
[1:16:28] israel of egypt
[1:16:29] the way of god is to lead them by the
[1:16:31] cloud of fire
[1:16:33] prophetic utterance miracles and signs
[1:16:36] god-given wonders
[1:16:37] this was to be accomplished by god
[1:16:39] selected god ordained
[1:16:40] god equipped god sent men with the whole
[1:16:43] camp
[1:16:43] being dominated by a holy ghost move
[1:16:49] they rebelled they wanted a set of rules
[1:16:52] and preached to go by
[1:16:54] it become like these people who don't
[1:16:56] have self-discipline
[1:16:57] don't have inner discipline they like
[1:16:59] the pastors who could pick
[1:17:00] you whip on them because they need licks
[1:17:04] to come into line so they'll lead the
[1:17:07] kind of man that could put
[1:17:08] licks on them and then they shake them
[1:17:15] and then they had to come back from all
[1:17:16] its
[1:17:19] it's almost like they're looking for
[1:17:20] abuse
[1:17:22] there's some people somehow they have a
[1:17:24] kind of sadistic
[1:17:26] thing about being abused
[1:17:31] but when you're motivated by love
[1:17:36] you can't wait to come to church you
[1:17:38] can't wait to pray
[1:17:39] in other words because of the love for
[1:17:40] god you're serving god now because your
[1:17:43] father dragged you inside of here
[1:17:44] you're serving god because you love god
[1:17:47] if you're father backslide you are not
[1:17:48] going to backslide
[1:17:49] if your white backside you're not gonna
[1:17:51] backslide if your husband backs that
[1:17:53] you're not gonna backslide
[1:17:54] because of your love for god
[1:18:00] is that a man called you is god call you
[1:18:02] is that man your servant is god you're
[1:18:04] serving

[1:18:11] what he has done for
[1:18:12] [Applause]
[1:18:24] you
[1:18:26] now i believe in leadership but it's not
[1:18:28] what what what
[1:18:29] but isn't but it's not the relationship
[1:18:31] of men i believe in
[1:18:33] i believe in the leadership of the holy
[1:18:34] ghost coming through the word
[1:18:37] i believe also that god has set men in
[1:18:39] the church who men who are gifted by the
[1:18:41] spirit
[1:18:42] and they will keep the church in order i
[1:18:44] believe
[1:18:45] also that the church is ruled over by
[1:18:47] men that god sends to take charge
[1:18:49] but that rule is by the word so that is
[1:18:52] not men
[1:18:52] really ruling but is the spirit of god
[1:18:55] for the word and spirit is one
[1:18:58] that is why i bring the quote quote unto
[1:19:00] the quote
[1:19:01] this is hard you know i could press play
[1:19:04] and play a tip for you
[1:19:20] on one message what am i starting to do
[1:19:22] i must stick up
[1:19:23] how many different messages i have to
[1:19:25] where i get this culture
[1:19:27] because it's not one message not one
[1:19:28] book so i have to hunt for these things
[1:19:32] i can't tell nobody hunt for me i ain't
[1:19:34] looking like them cruel certainly post
[1:19:36] waiting for accidents that happen to
[1:19:37] each other
[1:19:38] you know you have them just waiting on
[1:19:41] the post looking to see an accident
[1:19:42] gonna happen with some church
[1:19:43] they're gonna pick up some dead bird i
[1:19:44] nothing that you know we fly in a long
[1:19:46] time
[1:19:47] flying to get we won't meet oh glory to
[1:19:50] god
[1:19:52] brother isaac was the preacher this
[1:19:53] morning he felt ill he
[1:19:55] had the flu and so on that's how i end
[1:19:56] up preaching but he was the preacher
[1:19:57] this morning
[1:19:59] so ika what was you press play
[1:20:04] how to find meat fresh killed crackers
[1:20:07] blood dripping
[1:20:09] blood has to be dripping when you put
[1:20:12] your beacon you have to rip that meat
[1:20:14] there
[1:20:15] and how to feed your spirit how to feed
[1:20:17] your soul has to do something for your
[1:20:20] life
[1:20:21] like freshly killed tacos oh glory to
[1:20:24] god you love him
[1:20:26] remember them which i've ruled over you
[1:20:28] who have spoken unto you the word of god
[1:20:30] whose fate follow considering the end of
[1:20:33] their conversation and that is life
[1:20:35] but see what is happening back here that
[1:20:37] false vine was getting a hold
[1:20:39] i was teaching that rulership by man was
[1:20:41] right so they could quote that scripture
[1:20:43] right
[1:20:44] it taught the pete the church had to be
[1:20:46] governed
[1:20:47] it taught a control over the people but
[1:20:49] instead of doing it
[1:20:50] god's way they simply took authority
[1:20:52] invested all the spiritual power in
[1:20:54] their own hands
[1:20:55] and came out with a holy priesthood
[1:20:57] standing between
[1:20:58] god and the people and they went right
[1:21:01] back to the old ironic system
[1:21:05] and i god said you have one thing that i
[1:21:07] hate
[1:21:08] the deeds of the niculator because
[1:21:11] anytime you put a man like mary or put a
[1:21:13] man between you and go that trouble
[1:21:16] it has to be you seeing that you have
[1:21:18] direct access
[1:21:20] it has to be you seeing that when you
[1:21:22] come to service every service are
[1:21:23] getting a password and a username
[1:21:25] username is you the password is the word
[1:21:29] and it's giving you the authority which
[1:21:30] is faith to approach god
[1:21:32] and pull down any blessing
[1:21:36] [Applause]
[1:21:39] so you kind of get unauthorized injury
[1:21:43] you are authorized by the blood of jesus
[1:21:47] by a new unliving way to enter into the
[1:21:49] holiest of holies
[1:21:51] no angels until you stop you can't go
[1:21:53] you're your son
[1:21:54] he died once all glory to god and
[1:21:57] perfected forever then that are
[1:21:58] sanctified
[1:22:00] so his blood made a way hallelujah glory
[1:22:03] to god
[1:22:04] it's not about you it's about him it's
[1:22:06] not your sacrifice it's his sacrifice
[1:22:09] oh give the lord some praise do you see
[1:22:11] it do you see how that gives you access
[1:22:16] to every redemptive blessing oh glory to
[1:22:19] god
[1:22:20] let's continue jesus wants fellowship
[1:22:22] that's what god's heart longs for
[1:22:24] tonight

[1:22:26] place in the world a breaking down of

[1:31:41] the seed of god is actually placed
[1:31:44] in us from the foundation of the world
[1:31:46] so
[1:31:47] you are not now being recognized by god
[1:31:50] god puts something in you
[1:31:51] and what in you is what responds to the
[1:31:53] gospel

[1:32:01] something regardless if you're halfway a

[1:32:21] never
[1:32:21] touched her and though when that life
[1:32:24] was struck her she recognized it and
[1:32:26] there was something there to respond
[1:32:28] and moses was a born a prophet he was
[1:32:30] raised in an intellectual school

[1:35:22] overcome yet
[1:35:30] what has to happen let's continue let's
[1:35:32] let's let's do the word
[1:35:34] watch so noses uh the sea leaned here
[1:35:38] and when you when i'm preaching this you
[1:35:40] have to see yourself
[1:35:42] all right uh with an intellectual
[1:35:44] conception with all
[1:35:45] faith all with all the faith
[1:35:48] he was born to deliver his people and
[1:35:51] yet
[1:35:51] here we go it never come to life until
[1:35:56] that light from the burning bush flushed
[1:35:58] across it
[1:36:01] until he's seen not something he read
[1:36:03] about
[1:36:05] aha so they're not reading a book now
[1:36:07] there's not reading spoken books no
[1:36:09] this is beyond reading now this is
[1:36:11] coming into a reality
[1:36:14] that you know is god no man can give you
[1:36:17] that
[1:36:18] no man can preach do that you've got to
[1:36:21] encounter that
[1:36:23] oh give the lord a shout out
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:26] hallelujah what
[1:36:29] not something he read about but
[1:36:31] something he's seen with his eyes
[1:36:33] something that spoke to him and he spoke
[1:36:35] back to it
[1:36:36] and that bring the thing to life and i
[1:36:39] think a woman boy or girl
[1:36:41] i think in an intellectual conception of
[1:36:43] what they think the word is and so forth
[1:36:45] can never have a full foundation stand
[1:36:50] until they have met that light that
[1:36:53] brings that word
[1:36:55] to a reality i want that to be a burden
[1:36:58] upon your heart
[1:37:00] that you want that word to become a
[1:37:03] reality
[1:37:04] you know it is right you know it is true
[1:37:07] you know it is god
[1:37:08] speak it you know the prophet spoke it
[1:37:11] but you want beyond that
[1:37:13] you want the reality of it hallelujah
[1:37:16] shout out reality amen
[1:37:20] praise god so moses knows intellectually
[1:37:23] the seed that was born in him was laying
[1:37:25] in his heart
[1:37:27] watch and he tried she was intellectual
[1:37:30] experience with the word like that
[1:37:33] his intellectual so there's a next
[1:37:36] there's an intellectual experience you
[1:37:38] could have
[1:37:39] with the word this is big
[1:37:43] to bring them out to deliver them
[1:37:44] knowing he was born for that purpose he
[1:37:46] know that time
[1:37:47] the scriptures said it and so on and
[1:37:49] hear the prophet breaking you know
[1:37:51] we are coming to the rapture we have
[1:37:53] lived the time out
[1:37:54] at the time of the rapture is at hand we
[1:37:56] are looking for rapture and faith
[1:37:58] that can pull the church together and
[1:38:00] give it some supernatural strength
[1:38:03] that can change these bodies that we
[1:38:04] live in and we see a god
[1:38:07] that can raise the dead off the floor or
[1:38:09] out of the yard
[1:38:10] and bring him back to life again and
[1:38:12] present him before us
[1:38:14] when we see a god that can take a cancer
[1:38:16] that eat a manta
[1:38:18] shadow and raise him up on strong
[1:38:19] healthy man that ought to give rapture
[1:38:21] and fate
[1:38:22] to the people
[1:38:26] now let me drop a bomb on you he said
[1:38:28] rapture and faith is leaning a message
[1:38:33] but when you're translating that it has
[1:38:34] to have a manifestation
[1:38:36] of the dead being raised up of a cancer
[1:38:39] case being corrected
[1:38:41] and that will give rapture and faith to
[1:38:42] the people because the rapture
[1:38:44] is a glorified divine healing the
[1:38:47] rapture is your body being changed in a
[1:38:49] moment of trick of an eye
[1:38:50] and you having the faith that your body
[1:38:52] could be changed and when you see god to
[1:38:54] take a man from cancer
[1:38:56] death and pull him back to life you
[1:38:58] could know god to change your body
[1:39:00] when you could see god to change humor
[1:39:02] and kidney trouble
[1:39:03] and diabetes and reverse back height
[1:39:05] blood pressure whatever it is
[1:39:06] you could know god could change you
[1:39:08] transform you
[1:39:15] [Applause]
[1:39:18] so watch rapture in faith leading the
[1:39:20] message but that's not just an
[1:39:22] intellectual quote to preach
[1:39:23] that not letter word let's continue oh
[1:39:26] my hallelujah
[1:39:28] so it's not just wrapped in faith
[1:39:29] missing so wrapped in faith lay in the
[1:39:31] message that's the word part of it
[1:39:34] the word part that's the latter part the
[1:39:36] man being raised from the floor
[1:39:37] dead man that's the manifestation path
[1:39:40] you need boot
[1:39:42] word and spirit come on give the lord a
[1:39:44] shout out
[1:39:47] some people have the knowledge of the
[1:39:49] word but they have no manifestation
[1:39:51] that brings the word to life you have to
[1:39:54] want it
[1:39:55] you have to thirst for it you're not
[1:39:57] changing from my word it's your simple
[1:39:59] life
[1:40:01] [Applause]
[1:40:03] let's continue could we take some more
[1:40:06] now watch
[1:40:06] here moses based on his great call upon
[1:40:09] the word
[1:40:10] it was great this is big
[1:40:14] moses base is called upon the word
[1:40:17] until one day he met this light and the
[1:40:20] very word itself spoke back to him
[1:40:23] then he got his anointing
[1:40:27] that anointed what he had in him
[1:40:31] that was on the inside i'm still reading
[1:40:34] so all this faith was on the inside
[1:40:36] what's the secret
[1:40:39] the word is in the bright is that's the
[1:40:41] secret it's not outside that right it's
[1:40:43] in the bride
[1:40:44] well that word in you has to be anointed
[1:40:55] how could it be anointed when dynamics
[1:40:58] is the anointing
[1:40:59] for the word and the bride he said no
[1:41:01] other life could work in her
[1:41:04] so something because an anointing can
[1:41:06] anoint you it will take dynamics itself
[1:41:09] that is what we're preaching for you
[1:41:11] shall receive power
[1:41:12] when after the holy ghost

[1:49:30] to god hallelujah praise god
[1:49:32] thank you lord jesus so we cannot expect
[1:49:35] god to come down to our level of
[1:49:37] thinking
[1:49:38] whoa we cannot bring god bring don't go
[1:49:40] to our level of thinking we gotta rise
[1:49:42] ourselves to his level of thinking and
[1:49:44] meet him on the grounds that he provided
[1:49:46] for us
[1:49:47] oh glory to god so the scribes and
[1:49:50] pharisees the hats
[1:49:51] they had their creeds they had their
[1:49:52] dogmas they had their robes the long
[1:49:54] beard the long gong and the tall hats
[1:49:57] and they were the representative of
[1:49:59] christianity
[1:50:00] or the law of that day because of the
[1:50:03] looks and the appearance and the
[1:50:05] dressing and song people respected them
[1:50:07] jesus had no long hacked
[1:50:09] had not looking nothing like them he was
[1:50:11] outside the system altogether
[1:50:13] and he busted them no listeners
[1:50:16] what about he said they had their creeds
[1:50:19] pharisees said you see herodians what
[1:50:20] more
[1:50:21] all different forms and sexy religion
[1:50:22] each one had did his
[1:50:25] that he didn't believe in resurrection
[1:50:26] no angel or spirit the other one believe
[1:50:28] in both resurrection
[1:50:29] angel and spirit one believe a certain
[1:50:31] way you wash your hands the other way
[1:50:32] do it in the day christ could could come
[1:50:35] in
[1:50:36] sort of a thing like that but when he
[1:50:37] comes in his power
[1:50:39] of his transaction christ that is to
[1:50:41] make
[1:50:42] this a part to make people live
[1:50:46] and act and behave themselves
[1:50:50] and to change their attitudes and to
[1:50:52] change their ways
[1:50:54] and to change their living they don't
[1:50:56] want nothing to do with that
[1:50:58] [Music]
[1:51:00] they want teachings they want doctrines
[1:51:03] they don't want something to influence
[1:51:04] their behavior and their life
[1:51:09] i hear enough even on that and this is
[1:51:12] still the word
[1:51:13] whether you say amen or not this is
[1:51:14] still the truth that's why people are
[1:51:17] comfortable to confess what they believe
[1:51:22] they feel proud
[1:51:27] so what they want to live just like they
[1:51:30] want to live
[1:51:31] they want to continue right on living
[1:51:33] the way they lived and yet be very
[1:51:35] religious and go to church and be a
[1:51:37] member thereof
[1:51:38] they can go on a sunday morning whatever
[1:51:40] time it is a 15-minute sermon
[1:51:42] walk with the pastor and walk away from
[1:51:44] there kind of have settles and go back
[1:51:46] to
[1:51:46] live the way yesterday thy church
[1:51:51] okay that's true it's natural in this
[1:51:53] church you have this natural and truth
[1:51:54] spiritual
[1:51:55] so you can't believe everybody is a body
[1:51:58] is that church natural is that
[1:51:59] spiritual you want to be true it's
[1:52:01] spiritual jacob was still spiritual

[1:52:06] was true spiritual
[1:52:07] esau was a better man but he was just
[1:52:10] natural
[1:52:11] oh glory to god so it's not better man
[1:52:14] is what you're hungering for jacob
[1:52:17] wanted the birthright
[1:52:19] hallelujah and god said jacob i love

[1:52:38] god became man that he might become
[1:52:41] fellowship with man and in man to do
[1:52:43] what to achieve
[1:52:45] one purpose to bring to man what god is
[1:52:49] not what a church is
[1:52:51] [Applause]
[1:52:55] so when somebody talking about moreover
[1:52:57] the church than about the word about god
[1:52:58] you know the oath
[1:53:00] because jesus had come to bring what
[1:53:01] church is he can't represent what god
[1:53:04] is not what church is but what god is
[1:53:07] jesus came that he might present god to
[1:53:10] man
[1:53:10] and man didn't want it and the holy
[1:53:13] spirit today
[1:53:14] likes the manner to present god to man
[1:53:17] but the man
[1:53:18] wants to go to church it draws his
[1:53:21] thinking
[1:53:22] he cannot fathom it we must learn that
[1:53:25] god is not known by intellectual
[1:53:27] conception
[1:53:28] this is not the jehovah witness kingdom
[1:53:30] hall we're talking about the kingdom of
[1:53:32] god
[1:53:33] when john was preaching the kingdom of
[1:53:35] god is at hand
[1:53:36] is that hand
[1:53:41] update yesterday here's a a crazy
[1:53:44] statement a man saying i am the kingdom
[1:53:45] of god
[1:53:46] and i'm watching are watching that
[1:53:47] character they stand about i am the
[1:53:48] kingdom of god
[1:53:50] that is same foolishness but i am the
[1:53:52] holy ghost
[1:53:53] how are you going to be the kingdom of
[1:53:54] god
[1:54:00] god are you ready is known by
[1:54:03] the new birth by the holy ghost

[1:54:15] the holy ghost

[1:54:19] sanctified give power to cast out
[1:54:20] unclean spirits to preach

[1:59:12] reach where i want to reach oh glory to
[1:59:14] god
[1:59:15] let's continue now the holy spirit
[1:59:19] will not misbehave itself in one person
[1:59:23] and behave itself in another
[1:59:28] so if one person misbehaved another
[1:59:30] person behaving
[1:59:32] that one person whom is behaving i don't
[1:59:34] care what they're teaching or they're
[1:59:35] preaching or what they're saying
[1:59:37] it's not the holy ghost and vote
[1:59:40] listen to how the prophet brought here
[1:59:42] it will make each person
[1:59:44] come into its character
[1:59:47] because it's a spirit that leads you
[1:59:50] it brings or makes you subject to its
[1:59:53] nature
[1:59:55] you don't bring it subject to its nature
[2:00:00] like a brother say bye tell your sister
[2:00:03] wait to the government
[2:00:04] i will deal with you
[2:00:09] see he work in the spirit
[2:00:13] so now when you go by the people no like
[2:00:15] god i rebuke
[2:00:18] my sister must take that
[2:00:21] that is not what you're talking about
[2:00:22] here amen just because brother branham
[2:00:26] had was to be tested with power
[2:00:30] now look at it but the punch god can't
[2:00:31] give me power because the behavior is so
[2:00:33] terrible
[2:00:34] they will cause a lot of trouble and
[2:00:36] confusion they will make
[2:00:37] a bunch of mess that's why he have to
[2:00:39] wait for character
[2:00:41] here it is brother branham had power and
[2:00:43] god had to test him
[2:00:44] with the power
[2:00:48] i don't want to get away no because god
[2:00:50] wanted to give him further so the people
[2:00:52] come making love in church
[2:00:53] and he said god drop dog and save you
[2:00:55] say blind if i said death whatever
[2:00:56] whatever you say
[2:00:57] you'll be done and he said i forgive you
[2:01:00] with power to do debt with power to say
[2:01:03] what a blind
[2:01:04] he said i forgive you because he knew
[2:01:07] himself
[2:01:09] he saw himself he was authentic he was
[2:01:12] real he wasn't mechanical he was an
[2:01:14] intellectual he was for real
[2:01:17] and we have to become authentic real not
[2:01:19] mechanical
[2:01:20] original this is me
[2:01:24] i forgive you and the holy spirit poured
[2:01:27] out because the holy spirit was pleased
[2:01:29] he said the right thing oh hallelujah
[2:01:33] later on god told him by voice
[2:01:37] tongues and interpretation because thou
[2:01:39] has chosen
[2:01:41] this narrow path you have walked in your
[2:01:44] own chosen
[2:01:46] you have picked the precise and correct
[2:01:48] decision it is
[2:01:49] my way it's the harder way
[2:01:53] but he picked it he said you walked in
[2:01:56] your own chosen
[2:01:58] i didn't force you you choose to walk
[2:02:01] this christian path where you choose the
[2:02:03] bloody footprints on the sons of time
[2:02:05] you choose that
[2:02:06] hallelujah so much it will bring you
[2:02:10] into its nature you don't bring it
[2:02:12] subject to your nature it makes you
[2:02:13] subject its nature
[2:02:14] the holy spirit makes you live and love
[2:02:16] to do it how you
[2:02:18] love to give up the things of the world
[2:02:20] when the holy spirit comes in
[2:02:21] how it cleanses you and washes you and
[2:02:24] put a desire in you to follow him
[2:02:27] a thirst and a hunger for more of it
[2:02:30] just baiting yourself he brings
[2:02:32] realities
[2:02:34] who does that the holy spirit brings
[2:02:36] realities
[2:02:37] brother branham said though in the early
[2:02:39] church they
[2:02:40] they they had so much of the holy ghost
[2:02:42] and every opportunity they're asking us
[2:02:44] for more more
[2:02:46] more when they beat them they come and
[2:02:48] say oh god strictness and
[2:02:49] give us more and they get that double
[2:02:51] portion they refill by the holy ghost
[2:02:52] you see this age hardly have it and
[2:02:54] they're not even asking for it
[2:02:56] but that early church their fathers and
[2:02:57] them oh they're only asking for more
[2:02:59] more holy ghosts more holy ghosts more
[2:03:01] power more love
[2:03:03] more witness and power oh glory to god
[2:03:06] hallelujah praise god we believe it
[2:03:09] hallelujah
[2:03:11] when god placed men here in the days of
[2:03:13] the lord jesus
[2:03:15] he gave men a true road map to power
[2:03:18] to his power a road map is something
[2:03:22] that
[2:03:22] tells you where you are headed
[2:03:25] if you want to go and that's the way god
[2:03:28] wants us to know he's
[2:03:29] talking about he from california i've
[2:03:31] missed the time he could know where to
[2:03:32] go california
[2:03:33] and only driving time back and forth he
[2:03:34] said that's the way god wanted us to
[2:03:36] know his word
[2:03:37] we know it we have traveled it
[2:03:41] we have tested it we have tried it
[2:03:44] you know where it leads to now his road
[2:03:46] map is his bible
[2:03:48] the map is what there's not google map
[2:03:51] or apple map this is the bible's
[2:03:53] map this is a map to lead you to power
[2:03:56] oh glory to god the bible is the road
[2:03:59] map that leads to the power of god
[2:04:02] faith leads you to the power
[2:04:08] so seven tennessee faith to do what to
[2:04:11] lead you to the power
[2:04:12] and power produces the promise
[2:04:16] he said we need power so watch the world
[2:04:19] gives faith right
[2:04:20] and faith lock the bottom there and
[2:04:23] write on top of it is what
[2:04:25] virtue and virtue is power that is what
[2:04:28] left jesus right
[2:04:29] so the first thing god gives you the
[2:04:30] revelation to give you faith
[2:04:32] and you expect with your faith now you
[2:04:34] move to god's power
[2:04:36] hallelujah and with power you could add
[2:04:39] the rest of your life
[2:04:40] because all these things are
[2:04:41] supernatural how many knows this is not
[2:04:44] natural
[2:04:45] you can make out buy a rainbow color
[2:04:47] cloth undressing it that is not a
[2:04:49] perimeter inside of you
[2:04:50] that's the dress you're wearing so this
[2:04:52] is not that rainbow cloth you're going
[2:04:54] on
[2:04:54] a new feast and buy this some color
[2:04:57] cloth and make up a rainbow dress
[2:04:59] that's not working what you need is
[2:05:04] this inside of you it starts with faith
[2:05:07] faith is a revelation but you have to
[2:05:09] get power
[2:05:11] isn't that right power need promise so
[2:05:14] okay now listen
[2:05:15] all right here's what ram says now
[2:05:20] christ the bishop got revealed
[2:05:23] the christ in you makes him the center
[2:05:25] of the revelation
[2:05:27] christ's life in you makes him the
[2:05:29] center of the revelation
[2:05:30] christ in the bible makes the bible the
[2:05:32] complete revelation of christ christ
[2:05:34] in you makes you the complete revelation
[2:05:36] the whole thing sees
[2:05:37] what god's trying to do what is the new
[2:05:39] book then you say well brother branham
[2:05:41] what's the new book
[2:05:42] it is the revelation of jesus christ
[2:05:45] personally to you now this is the word
[2:05:49] the new book is the revelation of jesus
[2:05:51] christ
[2:05:52] personally to you but that's not all
[2:06:00] next quote the new birth is an
[2:06:02] experience
[2:06:04] it's a gift of god it's the seal of your
[2:06:07] faith
[2:06:08] so if i preach new word is a revelation
[2:06:10] it's a revelation it's a revelation and
[2:06:11] don't tell you it's also an experience
[2:06:14] you're stuck with revelation and you
[2:06:17] have no expectation for the experience
[2:06:19] the right question must be asked if
[2:06:22] you're saying revelation and experience
[2:06:24] the question is which one come first
[2:06:30] then revelation comes first and
[2:06:32] experience after
[2:06:34] boat is the truth the new boot is a
[2:06:36] revelation
[2:06:37] and a new build is an experience and you
[2:06:40] come right down the middle and you take
[2:06:41] both of them
[2:06:42] oh glory to god you don't let nobody
[2:06:44] talk you out of experience
[2:06:46] hallelujah glory to god what you want is
[2:06:50] the revelation and the experience
[2:06:53] [Applause]
[2:06:54] because faith is the substance of what
[2:06:56] you're hoping for you have not yet
[2:06:58] experienced it in reality but you have
[2:07:00] it by faith
[2:07:02] oh give the lord a shout abraham had a
[2:07:04] revelation of isaac but he never saw
[2:07:06] isaac for 25 years he hung in there with
[2:07:08] his revelation
[2:07:09] he couldn't even show his wife the
[2:07:10] revelation he could talk it but he can
[2:07:12] show it
[2:07:13] it was inside of him and when it's
[2:07:15] revealed to you it is yours
[2:07:17] oh give the lord a shout when it's
[2:07:18] revealed to you it is yours
[2:07:20] isaac wasn't abraham abraham knew it by
[2:07:23] revelation
[2:07:24] because god spoke to him oh glory to god
[2:07:28] and that's what happened with peter when
[2:07:30] jesus said who do men say i am some say
[2:07:32] you're this i'm see you that he said who
[2:07:33] do you say i am he said what the christ
[2:07:35] then jesus said flesh and blood heart
[2:07:37] not reveal this unto you
[2:07:38] but my father oh glory to god that come
[2:07:41] from heaven
[2:07:42] then i come from texas a minister that
[2:07:44] comes from heaven
[2:07:46] and upon this rock i will build my
[2:07:48] church and the kids of hell will never
[2:07:50] prevail against it
[2:07:51] so we are in a triumphant church this
[2:07:53] morning the church of the ransom first
[2:07:55] born
[2:07:56] the glory of god hallelujah because it's
[2:08:00] built upon the faith

[2:08:48] glory
[2:08:53] in natural realm with his pg he had
[2:08:55] intellectual faith he didn't have divine
[2:08:57] faith
[2:08:58] there's a quite a difference in me
[2:08:59] having an intellectual feet
[2:09:01] than a divine feet my baptist friends
[2:09:03] failed to go on he said you get the
[2:09:05] intellectual fear by that but it must be
[2:09:06] a divine
[2:09:07] revelation of jesus christ to you and
[2:09:10] that just come out of the heart the
[2:09:11] intellectual faith is not enough good
[2:09:13] enough
[2:09:14] that's all right it only brings you but
[2:09:16] it only brings you to the holy
[2:09:18] spirit the holy spirit is a
[2:09:21] personal experience of built a new birth
[2:09:25] regeneration making a new creature in
[2:09:28] christ oh hallelujah praise
[2:09:31] be to jesus he said pentecost is an
[2:09:34] experience
[2:09:35] not an organization we experience
[2:09:38] pentecost
[2:09:39] by the new birth now when you talk about
[2:09:41] penny when you talk about sunderland
[2:09:42] people say pentecostal
[2:09:44] in this message they have no sign no
[2:09:48] wonder they don't want to preach about
[2:09:49] it too
[2:09:50] i can't join them if they don't have
[2:09:52] faith
[2:09:53] in that one is that is them are you

[2:12:48] you know
[2:12:49] all right let's continue here now the
[2:12:51] purpose
[2:12:52] of sending the holy ghost
[2:12:55] was for god to continue to a bunch of
[2:12:58] people
[2:12:59] to continually manifest god to the world
[2:13:03] that is not all not by a creed not by
[2:13:07] denomination
[2:13:08] but by the power of his resurrection by
[2:13:10] making his word
[2:13:11] real
[2:13:15] come on now that is the purpose
[2:13:18] [Applause]
[2:13:20] of sending the holy ghost
[2:13:25] do you see it now
[2:13:28] make it worth real by taking his promise
[2:13:32] how are you doing that by taking his
[2:13:34] promise and standing on the side of the
[2:13:36] minority
[2:13:37] which is where we are now and believe in
[2:13:40] god
[2:13:40] and watch the black skies move back and
[2:13:43] the power of god move in
[2:13:45] and take over so we define
[2:13:48] systems we define conditions we define
[2:13:51] we saying everything outside is a lie we
[2:13:54] said this word is
[2:13:55] true there's going to be a super church
[2:13:57] there's going to be a super race
[2:13:58] there's going to be a power coming to
[2:14:00] the church and now coming in
[2:14:02] that the people will be anointed that
[2:14:04] they're going to speak the word we're on
[2:14:06] our way to the rapture
[2:14:08] oh glory to god hallelujah so watch
[2:14:12] through the blood cell of jesus came
[2:14:15] forth the holy ghost
[2:14:16] that had itself bound up in the body
[2:14:18] called jesus
[2:14:20] that blood sanctified away by
[2:14:23] faith to call the redeem or the elected
[2:14:26] of god
[2:14:27] and when the holy spirit has taken all
[2:14:30] the
[2:14:30] meanness out of you he moves right in
[2:14:34] god himself to work his will now your
[2:14:37] how your meanest
[2:14:38] you have your attitude and behavior god
[2:14:41] are living with that you know
[2:14:42] god coming with some dynamite and some
[2:14:44] grenades and
[2:14:45] ripping it off and blowing inside the
[2:14:47] deer blowing up your heart with
[2:14:49] fire and the snake that inside your
[2:14:52] heart
[2:14:52] that burning out too and then the
[2:14:55] atmosphere is right for him to step in
[2:14:57] and sit
[2:14:57] on your throne oh chloe
[2:15:00] [Music]
[2:15:01] [Applause]
[2:15:03] glory hallelujah
[2:15:06] so then you have jesus in your heart
[2:15:10] and that is what a nice sapphire did not
[2:15:11] underhand understand you may be seated
[2:15:14] that cuss but peter got firebombed and
[2:15:16] his
[2:15:17] his demon his his snake got blown out
[2:15:20] and
[2:15:20] christ was always sitting in peter's
[2:15:22] heart so when they lie in church he said
[2:15:24] he lied to me
[2:15:25] you liked the holy ghost they failed to
[2:15:28] understand the holy ghost is operating
[2:15:29] in that man
[2:15:30] if you want to go back to his man force
[2:15:32] and feel like that is your business but
[2:15:33] you'll be judged
[2:15:34] because god they have no lion coming
[2:15:36] inside the church he'll have a glorious
[2:15:38] church without support or wrinkle
[2:15:40] that's the purpose of sending this
[2:15:41] message to have the right kind of church
[2:15:43] that the devil can't deceive because
[2:15:45] this bribe will not be like eve
[2:15:47] this pride could be a different bite

[2:15:51] this bride will be behind the world she
[2:15:53] will be the word

[2:23:06] she said where are you going he's in
[2:23:07] egypt he said we're going to join four
[2:23:10] it's 40 years ago not knew that he said

[2:23:14] yeah she's riding over there
[2:23:18] oh glory she went through you know
[2:23:21] when moses got down there and they think
[2:23:23] it's ordinary moses and moses muslim
[2:23:24] fighter
[2:23:25] no fear and if you have different kings
[2:23:30] bringing this and bringing that
[2:23:31] something in silk something in gold
[2:23:33] something and rice something in food
[2:23:35] they say what kingdom you from
[2:23:37] you see the kingdom of the most high god
[2:23:40] so moses tell him where he kingdom from
[2:23:42] now
[2:23:43] but he had given word yet from the
[2:23:44] kingdom you say what do you bring
[2:23:46] you say the word the man just brings
[2:23:50] silk
[2:23:51] won't just bring gold because pharaoh is
[2:23:53] the superpower of that day
[2:23:55] so pharaoh on top is game what will is
[2:23:58] this
[2:23:59] configuration what would what is this

[2:24:03] treasure behind the other comments

[2:24:06] brings some music i think is that
[2:24:08] is a millionaire treasure i have behind
[2:24:10] so you said the word is let my people go
[2:24:14] you're serious dead serious
[2:24:18] [Music]

[2:24:38] even say by this shall you know and iran
[2:24:40] funeral
[2:24:41] charity god and tell moses them fellows
[2:24:45] didn't seem to me anything to him
[2:24:48] when that stick turned to snake they
[2:24:50] will say is that
[2:24:52] that is what you come here with that the
[2:24:55] best you could come with he said giants
[2:24:56] and jamborees
[2:24:57] just show him a form here just give him
[2:24:59] an experience of what we're doing wrong
[2:25:00] in egypt

[2:25:02] to the snake moses has a rock back no
[2:25:05] if moses says
[2:25:10] if moses it shows that god didn't talk
[2:25:12] to moses
[2:25:13] moses that never happened before the all
[2:25:16] is a supernatural thing you know
[2:25:18] this happened before moses says stand
[2:25:20] back and rock back and just wait
[2:25:22] and watch and watch a snake eat up the
[2:25:24] other two

[2:25:36] wrongs

[2:33:04] sealed till the time of the end
[2:33:06] so the revelation of the seven seals was
[2:33:08] to reveal the bible
[2:33:09] so we have the authority to go back to
[2:33:11] the bible
[2:33:12] back to the word back to the landmark
[2:33:16] that the fathers have set on the day of
[2:33:18] pentecost they set it a certain way

[2:36:53] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[2:36:55] children back to the faith of the
[2:36:57] fathers
[2:36:58] we're going to prove the faith of the
[2:37:00] fathers
[2:37:01] has been restored that's the only way we
[2:37:04] could prove
[2:37:06] and confirm malachi fought in this world
[2:37:09] right now
[2:37:10] by going back to the faith of the
[2:37:11] fathers and picking up what they had
[2:37:21] [Music]
[2:37:22] no man can come now and explain to me
[2:37:24] this message i go run him
[2:37:26] hallelujah there's nothing in this world
[2:37:28] he could come and explain me that he's
[2:37:29] supposed to what i don't know
[2:37:30] what i want is the promise what i want
[2:37:33] in this power
[2:37:34] to produce the promise the promise is
[2:37:36] the holy ghost
[2:37:38] the promises that come upon you the
[2:37:40] fires to come upon the bride
[2:37:42] oh glory to god hallelujah
[2:37:45] so i'm looking for when the press come
[2:37:46] down look for the press
[2:37:48] so i'm looking for the right hundred
[2:37:50] percent group
[2:37:55] without power you'll be killed
[2:38:06] but my bible tell me you shall
[2:38:10] receive power after
[2:38:13] the holy ghost comes upon you
[2:38:16] and faith was given to pull down
[2:38:20] the holy ghost the same holy ghost that
[2:38:22] was bombed by the rule euphrates
[2:38:24] is to be loosed by the even time message
[2:38:27] to bring back god among the people
[2:38:30] because the word was invisible until the
[2:38:32] world
[2:38:33] became flesh and they confirmed
[2:38:36] the word become flesh omnipotence must
[2:38:39] speak
[2:38:40] and to confirm omnipotence being spoken
[2:38:44] the miraculous must take place
[2:38:48] do i shout in the house you can't tell
[2:38:51] me god is speaking
[2:38:52] and there is no miraculous because my
[2:38:55] omnipotent speak
[2:39:10] [Applause]
[2:39:13] [Music]
[2:39:14] [Applause]
[2:39:19] [Music]
[2:39:22] and the first thing you know he began to
[2:39:24] prosper him and he built up garrison so
[2:39:26] that all these uncircumcised could not
[2:39:28] come in
[2:39:28] that's what the church needs today is a
[2:39:31] garrison
[2:39:32] of the old-time apostle teaching so this
[2:39:34] lukewarm
[2:39:35] formal in and out up and down doesn't
[2:39:38] get into our church
[2:39:42] one time i was wondering if they take
[2:39:43] anybody
[2:39:46] let me get a testimony in the early
[2:39:49] years
[2:39:50] i had no interest whatsoever in anybody
[2:39:53] from any church
[2:39:54] any group in this message because the
[2:39:56] behaviors were so horrible
[2:39:58] the ministers was teaching some crazy
[2:40:00] stuff and manipulating and controlling
[2:40:02] people's lives
[2:40:03] that i pledged to god i wouldn't do that
[2:40:06] i made a pledge to god and to this day i
[2:40:09] kept that pledge
[2:40:10] so we went on the fields and miara
[2:40:12] different places i still go preachers
[2:40:14] sinners
[2:40:14] and win them to the lord i didn't want
[2:40:17] nothing to do with them people out there
[2:40:25] that was my heart i remember a time
[2:40:29] in the arrow preaching and on the house
[2:40:31] and nobody would come
[2:40:32] i tell the lord if nobody come next
[2:40:33] service i cancelled him out
[2:40:36] and my friend brought a kangaroo next to
[2:40:38] us so i cancelled because nobody came
[2:40:40] my friend barkangli say um he said um
[2:40:43] oh you could do that that's what i told
[2:40:44] you lord that i fired
[2:40:47] six months later the holy spirit go back
[2:40:48] now
[2:40:50] and i went back and with baptism after
[2:40:51] baptism and there's amazing the hall

[2:40:56] down there he was taking them from here
[2:40:58] baptizing them walking down to the beach
[2:41:02] the hall is still there it broke down
[2:41:04] and run along in a wooden place
[2:41:05] and and dear and some backstage come the
[2:41:09] idea
[2:41:10] and tell them what anybody i i don't see
[2:41:11] when there's no children
[2:41:14] from some big super church and he come
[2:41:16] to criticize and whatnot he hasn't
[2:41:18] backed his mouth for baptism we still
[2:41:19] have people here who got baptized from
[2:41:20] sister
[2:41:22] and they come to the service and after
[2:41:23] service i said i want to see you you

[2:42:52] he said watch we have omitted too many
[2:42:54] things to creep in brethren
[2:42:56] too many things that we left the old
[2:42:57] landmarks from the bedroom i began to
[2:42:58] keep
[2:42:59] we never garrosh in the church okay let
[2:43:01] me just kind of see what happened here
[2:43:03] the time has come when they are teaching
[2:43:05] doctrines of devils perverting the bible
[2:43:09] teaching
[2:43:10] into theories and theologies to draw
[2:43:12] groups and people away to them
[2:43:14] the time has come and we read this
[2:43:16] before that god will gather his church
[2:43:18] together
[2:43:18] under one great big banner of the lord
[2:43:20] jesus and poured his powers
[2:43:23] among them with great signs and wonders
[2:43:26] oh my hallelujah praise god we got you
[2:43:30] got to get
[2:43:30] back to the old pentecostal landmark
[2:43:32] what you need here in the valley
[2:43:34] i was looking around today is a good
[2:43:36] old-fashioned god sent
[2:43:38] sky blue sin killing religion the power
[2:43:41] of the holy ghost back in the church
[2:43:42] again
[2:43:43] back to the blood of the lord jesus and
[2:43:45] to fellowship by relationship
[2:43:47] by being born of the holy spirit oh
[2:43:50] glory to god amen
[2:43:52] hallelujah i have to finish this off
[2:43:54] sorry i can't leave you off now
[2:43:56] right now we're in the cockpit
[2:44:01] oh glory to god so bear with me a few
[2:44:03] minutes let me finish nailing this thing
[2:44:05] down here now
[2:44:06] brother branham he's talking about
[2:44:08] jeruba bell not by not mike not my power
[2:44:10] you know the quote now we will think for
[2:44:12] a few minutes that the seventh angel
[2:44:15] church messenger was to restore the fate
[2:44:19] of the children back to the fathers
[2:44:21] then he interpreted it in other words
[2:44:24] rebuild the church again
[2:44:26] under the power of the spirit so he's
[2:44:28] bringing it to spirit here right
[2:44:30] then oh praise the lord let's take
[2:44:33] another one
[2:44:34] he says now i will restore it in the
[2:44:37] last days
[2:44:38] it will be restored god shall send the
[2:44:40] holy ghost in such a way
[2:44:42] upon planted word that it will restore
[2:44:46] that's number two now watch let's go
[2:44:49] here now
[2:44:50] he says now time shall be no more this
[2:44:52] one says is the time
[2:44:53] he announces that time is over what
[2:44:55] happens what happens could that be
[2:44:56] stoner brethren
[2:44:57] seriously think if it is then the
[2:44:59] pyramid
[2:45:00] is capped by the 700s
[2:45:04] all right no let's continue
[2:45:08] what we have seen happen should put
[2:45:09] every soul in action it should make a
[2:45:11] church that will make a revival
[2:45:12] that people will be flying from europe
[2:45:14] to see what's taking place
[2:45:16] they will say there's a place in arizona
[2:45:17] called maricopa valley a city called
[2:45:19] phoenix there's something broke out
[2:45:21] these until these seven thunders of
[2:45:23] version 10 that are not even wrote
[2:45:25] is being made manifested
[2:45:29] let's continue the bible says the word
[2:45:32] was invisible
[2:45:35] until it was made flesh and then the
[2:45:38] word was made visible
[2:45:40] oh glory to god hallelujah
[2:45:43] hallelujah then he said everybody can't
[2:45:46] be a preacher but everybody got a voice
[2:45:48] and if you can't preach the people are
[2:45:49] so much live the people are sermon
[2:45:51] oh glory to god all right voices what we
[2:45:53] need
[2:45:54] is thousands of voices the thunder of
[2:45:57] god turn around and sweetness and
[2:45:58] holiness
[2:45:59] purity undefined lives walking around
[2:46:01] the world today without a blemish
[2:46:03] real christians that's the thunder
[2:46:05] against the devil
[2:46:07] all glory to god hallelujah praise be to
[2:46:10] jesus
[2:46:11] but then he said these divinely revealed
