common now is when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth and Lord I know that your spirit is pleased this morning the city is a bunch of people on the Earth that have a revelation of Truth and they could now come in the spirit and correctly worship you we thank you Lord for your sons and daughters gathered here we thank you for the same time we thank you for the struggles we thank you for the trials we thank you for the tribulations we thank you for the challenges we thank you for the mountains and The Valleys at all what you have brought us through you have never failed us yet we have failed but you never fail you are the same yesterday today forever oh God be a lamp unto a feet a light onto a part Lord guide our steps guide our footsteps or granted father look of All Families or loved ones snatch them out of hell break the bands of wickedness and evil free the people this morning snap out of the sluggishness snap out of the deadness God made it be raised up raise up in the spirit of the coming of the Lord granted fathers we've eaten you in Jesus and we ask God Amen you may be seated o blessed be the name of the Lord is good to be here this morning it's always good to be in the house of God this morning hallelujah praise God whatever is joy radius praises where we can acknowledge Him Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God Hallelujah thank you Jesus Isaiah 46. verse 9 says remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done seeing my Congress shall stand and I will do all my pleasure he declares the end from the beginning what declares him to be such a God is that he could prophesy through His prophets and see it come to pass surely there's a bride on the Earth surely there's a Next Generation that's going to be the final voice to the final age oh praise the Lord amen so we want to say happy Mother's Day to all the mothers here this morning and it's a challenge especially in times like this to be mother and Mother's Day shouldn't be like just Mother's Day one day but it should be every day amen praise God 365 years a day and there's a real Spirit of motherhood some people just make children and they just have children but there are there's what they call the spirit of motherhood that not just make sure but raise children raise them unto God wisdom to fear the lord raise them in the things and the ways of God Point them to the Cross Point them to righteousness Point them to the things that that you want them to walk in light I have your parents say give them a chance let them live their life and and they're young and instead of foolishness I wonder and and from that time the child won the off keys to be way way off and then it's hell to get them back and you know when if a plane is going a degree a little degree off after a while there's a little off track after so much hours they find yourself way way way from the destination point and as a Christian you have to be careful just a little and your time just roll onto that little thing there and you find yourself the correct line is here and you quite quite also and you want to know how did I get here your turn here that little thing that let's return on all the way so we thank God for his grace this morning and we thank God for the services passed we thank God for the special service we had on Friday by the Cali salt for those who taste come I know a couple of years he gave a testimony and so on and a testimony still holds to show his God and God do a workout he doesn't do halfway working when God openly blind man he blamed like one I see in one accident no no the band saw walked the claim amen God straightened out the dumb spoke and that's why when God awoken you is he do not work in you it has nothing to do with who like you who talking about you is God doing the work in you amen praise God by the Gideon the last crying keep on crying keep on saying one day you wanna have your last cry we're gonna step into your situation we're gonna step into your what you have need of Amen but ULU are generational issues and the abstract to the title deed and he share that people talk Mysteries and whatnot but many times you don't hear how to live how to have the wisdom the guidance the knowledge we need it because brother Branham says sin will get worse and worse things are not getting better things are getting worse people getting an issue they come and that's where either come at the motors of the heart the issues of life and the challenges what's inside your heart everything is under being what's inside the heart people have jealousy Envy malice this defile you not by going you know what comes out and God is make sure the situation comes up that it shows what is in the heart as we said the older brother with the prodigal son he may not even knew what was in his heart until his back sitting money spending wisdom slacker brother came back home hallelujah praise God and they killed fatted calf another big Feast for this brother who was terrible he wasn't a nice guy you know he was terrible Behavior he went far no WhatsApp no call no no phone call nothing at all but his father was waiting on him just like your father today is waiting on you his father was waiting for him that sucker was coming back he said I will arise I'll tell my father I've sinned I'm no longer worthy to be called your son let me be a servant but once a son or with the Sun a father can make a service and a servant a servant is a servant a son is a son I'll be thank God for that today so God looks at the heart that's the first thing people talk about their message and believing and scriptures and everything else but what's in your heart it's got to be deep down in your heart your soul a desire amen for God a desire for righteousness oh my thank God may God bless me it's 16 hungering until sin after righteousness oh God I was like I was going crazy it's 16. and how God has done something I said Lord do something for me this year that was 1974. I say God I don't know you but I want to know you I want to know you I want to know who you are I was struggling in my spirit because I know there's a reality somewhere 1975 how can I forget that year God came into my life done something for me so real that's kept me all these years I can keep myself God kept me I am here by God's grace I am here by God's mercy it's a long time you know 75 is way back when praise God number one if it's really real great is really really did my wife says Oh Praise the Lord what I would do I don't know but this is life that is life so we are grateful to be here this morning so I want to share something with you this morning and even with mothers in mind but let's tune to Hebrews chapter 4 let's stand sin John chapter 16. when we from 12 to 22 Saint John four thank you brothers and thank you brother Stephen for that anointed song service this morning certainly appreciate the music man these brothers are inspired musicians are inspired this is the inspired Church it's bad bunch I love that men move by the Holy Ghost not move by other men you know men not men not men you know men move women move by the Holy Spirit love that love that love that okay Hebrews chapter 4 want to read verse one let us therefore fear lest a promise being lifters of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it but fun to us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as I've sworn in my wrath if they shall enter my rest although the works was finished from the foundation of the world for you speak in a certain place on of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest see in therefore it remained that some must enter therein and dear to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief again he limited a certain day seen in David today after so long a time as it is said today if he will hear my voice Harden not your hearts for if Jesus here we go had given them rest then would he not afterwards I've spoken of another day therefore those nine they remained therefore arrest to the people of God foreign he had also ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest at least any man fall after the same example of unbelief and reading from uh Saint John chapter 16 verse 12. Jesus speaks I have many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he will shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father had are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you a little while on the world and he shall not see me and again a little while and he shall see me because I go to my father then said some of the disciples among themselves what is this that he said unto us a little while and he shall not see me and again a little while he shall see me because I go to my father and when they therefore they said therefore what is this that is here a little while we cannot tell what he's here now Jesus knew what they were desires to ask him and said unto them do you inquire among yourselves of what I said a little while he shall not see me and again why you shall see me verily I see unto you that he shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice it shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy a woman when she's in travail had sorrow because her awe is come but as soon as she's delivered of the child she remembered no more the anguish for joy that a man is Born Into the world ye therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man take it from you let's pray father we thank you for your word we pray interpreted our hearts blessed father we pray and may anointed to the house of your children and take me out of the way and Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh praise the Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah praise God don't go quiet Amino keep us keep the mutual summon praise God keep it in neutral and then it was written again praise the Lord amen so this morning I have a title a woman when she's in travail that's the title woman when she's in travil and I've had an inspiration labor pains you know what mothers but the only way to become a mother is to go through this process travel and Libertines and that identifies somebody being gets into the position of becoming a mother no Hebrews 4 I want to bring back something from the Amplified for he this is verse 10 who once entered God's rest has ceased from the weariness and pain of human labors just as God rested from those labors peculiarism yes verse 11 verse 11 let me know let us labor listen to it in the Amplified let us therefore be zealous Not Dead not having no passion and Zeal let us be zealous and exert ourselves and strive diligently to enter that quest of God to know and experience it for ourselves it must start there oh look it up there ourselves that no one may fall or perish by the same kind of unbelief and Disobedience into those that fell into the wilderness oh Hallelujah I for contact scripture I have Isaiah 66 8 who had heard such a thing who was seeing such a thing shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day shall the nation be born at once for as soon as Zion travail she brought forth her children oh Blessed Be when as soon as Zion travio she brought forth her children of course they have who have heard of this kind of thing oh glory to God shall they come for them one day what did the prophet said God will do in one year but all that erosion failed to do in 2000 years that year is coming that year could start today oh praise the name of the Lord but that year is coming Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord no I trust all of you have heard it so shared and it's in the word his own experience and it's part of the message of the Bible and the gospel and understand this the Bible is our absolute what the prophet came to reveal was the scriptures the scriptures is first that is our absolute that is what you have to plug right back into and the reveal would come on top of that oh glory to God the Bible is first the Bible is the is the Testament of God isn't that right now listen to this oh boy in the Life lays the blood and the blood is the life that's the only man that could bleed the right kind of blood because he was God's own blood so because all of us was born in sin and shape energy God had to do a miracle to identify by prophecy a virgin shall conceive he will take care of the egg and the sperm he go take care of the whole process to bring forth a man that is not of this world this man is from outside oh close this man from outer space this man not of the Earth the sperm The Germ the seed the egg that came from God so when Mary brought for Jesus he was God he was the word made flesh or glory to God God couldn't Deliver us as God yet to come down like us he had to be one of us you have to be born of a man to take on the robe of Flesh to come to redeem us to come to make the purchase price take Ransom us from the hands of the enemy because the devil had us in grip and corner to break the grip of the hands of the devil upon you upon your family upon your loved ones our power to come to do that so Jesus had to come to do that Glory Glory so what goes on blood and he bled the blood that redeemed you so our Salvation lays in Christ Jesus what he did for us at Calvary no matter how low we get how immoral we get how polluted we get when we look at Calvary with a true heart and confess our sins there on Calvary that settles it that settles it when you confess your sins you look to Calvary because that is where your source is you could stop drinking stop smoking you're still going to hell you're still a sinner stop and doing what because that is you doing it or give the Lord some Praises but it's not what you do I don't think people get a nut you know is what he has done and what you have accepted what he has done Oh Glory after he pardon you or hear pardon you and he forgive you or even he'll forgive you and if he forgive you of your sins you have a right to rejoice you have a right to praise God if the whole world know you are a sinner that has nothing to do with anybody or give the Lord some Praises if everybody know have what you have done so what nothing to do with anybody else Jesus dropped your charges Jesus dismissed your case Jesus gave you by his grace [Music] [Applause] so let's see it again no matter how low you get we get how immoral we are how polluted we get when we look at Calvary in a true heart and confess our sins the uncovery that selflessly that right no more than your confession can go from your lips still God has under obligation to answer you no you ain't get that yet no more than your confession go from your lips till God is under obligation to answer you so once you try to confess God make an obligation he has to answer that he cannot let your confession go unanswered he has to come and answer that he has to he's under obligation to respond to that could we give the Lord a prison [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah Glory he said now watch this Christian this Ahab jeze will have plenty to eat and you know Prosperity isn't a sign of God being with you if that is so our nation blessed and all the people are Christians so Prosperity then vice versa no watch he's talking about the widow woman right now God telling Elijah Commander where the woman feels you she's ordered she doesn't know that God think about it go ahead and talk to and say listen feed that man you know he said I have commanded a widow woman to feed you because Elijah shut up the Heavens either with him for three and a half years he said no rain no food and he have to eat he said go down there I have a woman there like a man I want to feed you she looking to die because she has a little meal a little oil she became one last big Shepherd baby her husband has died so she's a widow woman so she's gonna make that big and oil and thing like that and Konan watch this this poor little woman she looked at that little baby all night long she couldn't sleep first place she was so hungry she couldn't sleep she knew that one handful of me stood between her and death what would she do she couldn't stand us any longer she's frail she's walking reeling she walked little fellow crying for a more full of bread yet she was a Christian oh do bless is that Christian we talk about it pressure go see him in there still the word people died who said who said you're going to be no bread you're starting to get frightened already what she was a Christian right she doesn't believe in Jehovah we call Christian today loyal prove that God selected above all the women he selected her yet she done all that she could be done along towards daylight the birds wouldn't even holler they were all starved and gone they begin to break across the room I can see her so you see the Whip or the promise presented it he's seen it by vision the way he's presenting that he's seeing the story so these the gifts that he had could go right back in time because time is still here you know you just have to go back in it and the future is also here you have to go forward into it and what a prophet does he go up in the spirit go in the future come back and take your present tense because see what's going on there and if you can see the future he can see the past because the world is the reason of the Torso an intense of the heart that's what the word comes to do isn't that something there so the prophet is going back and seeing this story now okay Along Came the daylight the boys with him hello the world stops and gone they begin to break across the room I can see a certain old rocking chair ringing a hand the tears running on her cheeks as she looked little boy had spent the rest inside mama can't you just find one little piece of bread Papa was a good man God take name what's matter Mama but the woman stood she knew she met the requirement of God she had one little handful of meal she went in took a little handful of meal into the pan pour the oil in it begin to mix it up now that me was Christ Christ is the meal offering and if you're clear G-Man no and the oil represents spirit and that's the reason we anoint my oil when Elijah one time at the school of the prophets had come down there he sent some men out of the school they didn't know any difference between wild goals and peas some prophets but they pick up Allah of wild gods and Church in the pot and one of them will scream out there's death in the pot and next interpretation where a wild goat looking close to the resulting put it in the pot inside each has gone dead death in the pot that is that don't get excited he went got a handful of meal threw it into the pot and said eat why when Christ is put in debt life comes instead of death praise God and he said don't care how far you have gone how low you have sunk how immoral you are how degraded you are how sinful you are when Christ comes into the heart death Fades away and life comes into the same place from getting to the pot King life in the pot see if the cancer eat you up if tubercula the doctor turn you down nothing else can be done let a handful of Christ come into you let Jesus the same yesterday not a handful of religion now but a handful of Christ the Holy Ghost come into your heart with genuine faith and death will free out and life will take its place the oil is the spirit now what is that Christ is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the widows made flesh the spirit and Jesus told the one in the world the time is coming when God seeks people that will worship Him in spirit and in truth that is the word with the spirit some people ask the word others has the spirit but when you get the spirit and two together something's got to happen that's why the devil trying to disconnect the spirit from the truth first he's trying to make the truth not the truth praise God and they want no Spirit they have the message they have the word but then dead and our Lord we stay that way nothing happening but once you get the truth and the spirit together something have to move glory to God hallelujah something have to move it have to move in your heart it has to move in your life you're not going to leave here the same way if we get the word and spirit together the Brazilian Lord amen when you get the spirit on two together something gonna happen but just a little bit just a little bit it was all she needed God let this sink deep into people's heart you may

we'll just come here to occupy the Pew don't come here because you have no place else to go and you want to see people and this year your Facebook no you don't know that if you come here you come here because you have a faith in your soul that something will happen in your heart and in your life and you want your own personal experience you can't rest on your husband you can't rest on your wife your parents and your father your parents and your mother your car is on the pastor or the preacher or nobody amen in other words you're fighting for your life this morning could we give the Lord some praises Hallelujah what she stood it together that's the only thing between her and that that may be the only thing left for you tonight between you and that is what little spirit that you must muster up in your heart to believe it yes some people don't even have the spirit to believe they wish listen they wish they could be in church there's no atmosphere for them to pull them in church they wish they could be in church that's why blessed are you who are hunger and untested you are blessed have a tears for God you ever blessed the one to walk in righteousness and the walk once you're going to like you you are blessed oh praise God watch this now she said she makes everybody to know what she said Mama mother are you ready to cook the little cake she said yes dear just wait a few minutes but I'm mixing it up mother break it into you take half of it oh honey we'll take care of that now what is it now the word and the spirit mixed together she went out into the yard did you notice the Bible talk about two sticks she got two sticks what is that the cross she said two sticks to make a fire right always good Hunters know to keep the fire burning is the two lugs lays across unlighted right in the center of the Cross is where the sacrifice of God is hung she went into the yard she picked up two sticks she looked up hot blistering wins not a leaf on the tree no grass in the yard when the old tree Once stood there was two sticks left she picked them up I'm going to make it and I saw that similar thing in Africa there when we went to Ghana some uh Amigos and um there was a place we had a service in there and listen there wasn't a blade of grass on the ground it was just in modern no no no so I mean we don't see it here in the Caribbean and stuff but across this other countries sometimes they see places not as Speck of grass I can train that year all the Grassroots dry dry so I will rainfall I said Jesus rainfall but what's the water as soon as the rain fall that brown grass turned green praise God so watch he says here now okay she said no watch when you mix the word with the spirit the spirit with the word and then relatively sacrifice yourself at the cross you're ready to say whether I live or die Lord I have done everything I know how to do and I am coming at the peak of Mercy sacrifice my own believing I'll not think of it anymore talk about the part of dying is you getting rid of your own thoughts see the intellectual part because we could read and write we have this intellectual concept about well yes you see why going through you don't know why going through you want an explanation you want to explain yourself but the point about it what you really need is to get a heart experience because your head keeping your back your head your knowledge your information part is keeping you back you have to step out in faith praise God hallelujah you have to begin to exercise what a life of faith is glory to God Amen do you believe that when I live or die Lord I've done everything I know to how to do I'm coming at the peak of Mercy sacrifice my own believing I'll not think of it anymore I'll not reason anymore I'm casting out reasoning I just believe it Lord because it's your meal and oil your spirit your word your truth I'm showing myself as a sacrifice on the cross she pick up the two cross going in for sacrifice God is a present help in a time of trouble they that wait upon the Lord shall you see he's confident words he's bringing here no husband a child and then it's desert and then there's one more meal I mean you see a death coin coming to you and yet she taking courage in her spirit she taking courage in our heart and that is when you're sinking deep down in the you know faith that God put you when all the things are wrong you doesn't register that it means to go on or press on but you have to go that's when you need that anchor Oh Glory to God you need to know you have an anchor when everything is going wrong if you look with your eyes they will stop they will give up your backup shop and walk away but there is something deeper in you deeper than that that's why you cannot stop you cannot give up you cannot walk away or give the Lord some praises God is a present help in a time of trouble Give the Lord some Praise on that one God is a present help present help shout out present health present help in a time of trouble oh glory to God and they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall monk up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be wary they shall walk and not fade Lord you said in your word did not wait upon the Lord showing you their strength so I'm looking for my strength to be renewed because I'm waiting on you you don't wait don't be wary if you got the word and spirit and sacrifice your own belief and listen across something got to happen she started walking back and about that time she heard a voice and as she turned to look there was a kind looking old bullet gentleman standing at the gate with long flowing whiskers he said would you fetch me a little drink of water maybe on the lips she was ready to say I just have a little bit water was scarce all these Springs was dry what was it God works on both ends of the line that's how he says God you know praise God by the Gideon preach Wednesday I talked about Charlie or maybe where's the night I sent a WhatsApp and he was ready for Friday why because he has something in his heart God prepared him before I ask him God has worked on both sides to play it to show is God in the mode of two or three Witnesses let everything be established don't just hear things and believe it because somebody said it could be a big executive lie established in the motor two or three witnesses will give the Lord some praises did the Lord I shout people believe in all kind of nonsense and leave any message because a man saying that in the internet and they like the social strippers so they're peddling that and they listening that and then I see dropping their soul next minute they don't believe no more before anybody tell me anything that Elijah tell me about Elijah first if you can identify who Malachi foreign glory to God hallelujah not a man in his head God moving from this message because I have a revelation of it oh behold I send you not anybody else okay the Lord some Praises you are the one he said Elijah too because I send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the house of the children back to the faith of the fathers let them criticize but one day we will say this is that that the prophet William Branham speak of okay the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory to God Hallelujah to be a Christian you must be identified and the prophet said I'm identified whether a group that feel the spirit of God that know he's unveiled and no he's the same yesterday the day and forever and this is not fanaticism [Applause] Glory Glory [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God Hallelujah so I have no time but negative I have no time with criticism I have no time but the Cults and the Fanatics and this message because he builds the source seed and the devil has do this with this Minds the Bible talk about these people who we read in Hebrews for they didn't mix the world with faith and the unbelief didn't enter in go let them dry up in the wilderness all heads praise God God have no time with that you know when Moses died he said now Joshua more than my silver is dead take them people over God and wasting time moping praise God kind of you know the work of God will move on God don't need me to move on with this work you know oh give the Lord I shout I am God and I chase not and there was none like me there was none beside me that's what he said I declare the end from the beginning Oh Glory to God I am glad when I change not he had changed for me he had changed but nobody he's the same yesterday than ever oh glory to God you can be delivered today okay the Lord some prayers you know what I said you can be delivered to hey [Applause] let's go you may be seated what was it God works on both ends of the line God showed Elijah Vision go wrong into the city if I have commanded not the Ravens it's time to feed you I commanded a widow man to sustain you and took him to the poorest of the poor I've commanded a woman to sustain you but she didn't even have enough meal in the barrier for her and her son to live that day but I have commanded I have ordained it blessed be the name of the Lord and when God ordains anything is not it's got to happen it will be there God will meet it I have commanded a widow there to sustain you if God said there's going to be a bad Revival there is of death as hell to stop that Revival if God said there will be signs wonders Miracles and the manifesting the sons of God there is nothing of devils to stop it if God's going to deliver you did not delicate stop it no family condition your past your failures your fears your immorality your wickedness can't stop it okay the Lord some praises oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory [Applause] you give him a vision I can see him walking down the street the Lord must have told him this there have been old woman looking oh she's young her shoulders are stooped her shoulders are ragged her arms are out of her sleeves she'll be out in the yard with two sticks in a hand Elijah you know what that means what will this be 800 years from now and he walks he sees a woman he lean over the fence he said fetch me a little drink of water she tuned to see something she thought that's a kind old man he speaks a little different from the ordinary man there is something about God's children that they knew one another something that always been they know one another do you know a light hanging over you do you know when you walk you don't even know that a light hanging around long time ago that's some woman doing that kind of crazy stuff she said but I can't get to you there's something hanging over you it's a light the light a Christian you're a Son of God God call you out a light and listen yo you can't see it all them devils not religious Ram seeing a light over you you walking talking hiding smoking drinking or doing any kind of shady thing and then there was a look at our world look at that one here belong there you know hell give way to the name of Jesus

you here don't even know how you're here but you're here even in the world God was looking over you know God wants to look at the Mary when the angel comes down you know says Mary born a light or Mariana is that ready yet come on baby you can't make baby so she have to come to the age of maturity to be able to be a child but she was always married she was always the Virgin shall conceive she was always that scripture [Music] [Applause] before Mary was born she was inside the womb of her mother to fulfill scripture scriptures they just turning like this because Isaiah prophesied A person shall conceive it was not man's prophecy it was God's prophecy and right now there's a prophecy over your life do you know the prophecy over your life you come here till you have to say the Lord and when we preach the word of God you're here the Lord God is speaking to you by the scriptures God is speaking by the word God you're speaking about the Messiah you are hearing God said the Lord this

predestinated to stay a sinner or give the Lord a shout did you hear what I'm saying this morning you were never predestinated to stay a sinner Oh Glory to God you were predestinated to be redeemed to be delivered to be set free [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign she nodded her head she would do it she started to go away what she heard a voice again and bring in your hand a little cake for me to eat a morsel of bread no the water before the scarce was all right but but this is the real thing between them watch this part now she said I have just enough for me and my little starving boy out here getting these two sticks I've mixed it together dressed it and now I've got two six and make a fart and make the cake then he and I will eat it and die as you turn again she had a voice say but

to go down and get her last penny she had to go down get the last piece of bread she didn't have to go for this or maybe change doctors and so forth some little insignificant thing she had to go the only thing that stood between her and that child bring me a little kick first in your hand I can see another head obedient that's what God requires you get the word and the spirit why do you think it's supposed to work out let me just ask this a little bit as Christians why do you think it's supposed to work out for you because you're a Christian because you come to church why do we feel entitled because we baptized in Jesus name everything we've got everything will be all right Hallelujah Glory Glory why supposed to be so have you not read the scriptures does these things happen for our examples we always believe no trials no testing no tribulation no disappointment we want to live or we want to live and expect more to control how we want to live that is still you and somehow God have to break you I can't because you're in real trouble because I look at my own breaking man can't break yourself you know the Bible said the heart is desperately wicked who can know it but God sometimes man don't even know what's inside their heart that's why you offer a new heart or for you a new spirit or for you his Spirit he said let's deal let's let's trade let's bargain a new utter will give you if you're willing to give me your stone here you can have two hearts inside that they are Stony Island he said give me your Stony and I will give you a heart of Flesh give me your own humans I'll give you my spirit give you a Sanctified Spirit on my spirit now watch this here I can see you're not in obedient and that's what God requires you get the word and spirit mixed together self-sacrifice obedience and when God say a certain thing cause prophecy or something just hold on to just do it she borrow ahead and say yes sir she starts on then she heard the sweetest thing she ever heard that all sufficient way that all of us listen for for they come across the gate a blast from the prophet's voice for thus saith the Lord and that that sounds good that song's good Hallelujah the barrel shall will not go empty or the crews will fail until the way that God sends rain on the earth there it was my field charged with that I feel an anointed come down upon that oh glory to God she was at the very end and in obedience because she turned in obedience she had thus say at The Lord Oh Glory to God and every day after that when she dipped there was meal where she dipped there was oil when she dipped there is meal when she dipped there was oil once you have need of it is there or you're here provider he's a way maker oh Gloria called Hallelujah because he said the Lord do you want to hear that that's the greatest thing you could hear Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God let's go so no matter how far you're stupid and sin you are still Sons and Daughters of God because you have fallen degenerated in your soul mind but God is your creator and in your Fallen estate you are lost undone creation Domination by the devil that's right but still you are Sons and Daughters of God he is not willing and you should perish but all might come to repentance he has done everything possible for only God could do this to give the opportunities to the creators to the creatures of his to accept and to be what he wants you to be back in your right estate again so God's burden is to bring us in back into a right estate you're not in the right mind if you haven't received Jesus Christ Oh Glory the God hallelujah you're not in the right position if you haven't already accepted Christ for him to have the preeminances in your life glory to God hallelujah praise God we believe that amen amen amen now watch he's the one he created your being you'll be crazy to the world when you do that when you're what I'm a Christian genuine Christian he said when you do it you know not an atmosphere and when you do that God lists you right up from the world and you live in a Heavenly atmosphere so say in another world he said Heavenly atmosphere see then to the world you just contrary to what it is and this is contrary to the world now what you want to do is to be lifted by Christ here we go what you want to do is to be lifted up by Christ into an atmosphere to where you are happy peaceful then in dear you create a situation that may seem strange the people get wanted a spirit in churches instead of getting the Holy Spirit you go about a group of people you wash the way a person acts then the kind of people coming to that congregation the first thing you know they act the same way you take a good one woman and a bad man a good woman and a bad man guess what they know she he will become a good man or her a bad woman good man bad woman he will either become a good man or a bad or a bad woman in the atmosphere that you live you project to your Associates what you are so without saying a word as our father you have a projection to your children without even a word spoken because that is the realm of the spirit as a husband you are projecting something with only my words spoken as a wife you're projecting something without email word spoken otherwise he could cook the meal Without Love you could do meals and so forth as a duty and you hate doing that what you're doing but you're doing it you can't say by virtue of sight you can see we should do it but with your spirit terrible is that people so-called Christians who not happy at all because they are messed up in selfishness messed up in their own cells they're unresolved issues within their heart and that's why I love the words of Jesus will though be made whole you're sick but

man is a Christian than anything I know of you know what it is it's a travail of soul a person that is always so hungering and testing for God I pick up a message listening a message and but I'm talking about he's so hungry for God and I'm listening to the prophet saying this 1965. he's just months away from God taking him home and he's talking about he's hunger and too sin for God question you ready are you hungry and testing for God what is what is your deep what is your desires the Bible talk about simply day and night they just can't stand they got to do something they got to do something for God they're full of love they're just so trivial trafficking all the time he that great fortune and tears with doubtless return again bringing in Precious sheath oh let's go now I have something here root I think I brought something about this before I'll bring it let's bring it back again consistency thoughts thought boots wood action action consistently consistently produce a trend a trend consistency produce a habit a habit produces a character or life we have to have habits good habits and then good habits come from thoughts thoughts coming to words words come into action and the action that we do on a daily basis consistent basis you don't read the Bible every week or every month you don't pray every week you pray every day you tribe every day you have to have a consistency that makes a difference Hallelujah I will meet you India praying on a daily basis ride with me seeking on a daily basis come go with me now crying out on a daily basis praising God on a daily basis Thanksgiving on a daily basis how you could get in the wrong Spirit when you're doing this on a daily basis your eye not long no because your neighbor has read you when I read all spell your Vex because you don't have the money the body repaint and he never winning lottery you're competing with the wrong thing this one has that that one and you wanted to and that's in your heart you're stuck but if you say thank you love what I have what you have it's something called gratefulness what did the Bible talk about in this person last day people shall be untangle Unholy and I was ungrateful who Christians church members Church Folks [Applause] it's a blessing to be here this morning every time I come to church you hear me the privilege to be here that's how I see it [Applause] I'm not 65 years young I'm 65 years old the current score meeting yesterday and I can always hearing so I just got paid under my foot as soon as we just before Christmas I don't know where that being come from I don't know what that is about him just under my foot of getting younger so what they want seeking on a daily basis daily and we pledge already I will pray till all these virtues are in this body of mind you're praying for these things daily we have things to pray about crying out daily praising God daily Thanksgiving on a daily basis on a daily basis the consistency is what is going to make a difference I remember having a financial 700 years ago on asking the young men at that time how much double series by a week how much soft drink how much distance buying and whatnot all right I said to them I said I don't want audio to stop mine I just wanted to reduce what you're buying and save the rest and some of them laughed and I was serious at that time I was about 30 or something like that and there were brothers 45 50 much older than me I was talking about retirement and one brother came up to me and tell me how you could even talk about but his retirement come so fast it was real I was showing them accumulated savings after 30 years 25 years 20 years at a chart what have to do with Stevens consistency every time you put away something it's a consistent thing it could be small but after a while it adds up but when you spend all on your act you uh irrational like if it always will be dear your finals haven't want I remember when I got married I told my wife I said I don't want to Pelt my heart and try to reach it to her some people spell they have a hope quite also and they barely had pretty hand coverage I said I am not into that yo and I always believe in living below your means not above living below your means in other words you could afford but you choose not to because you want to live below your means then you always have a steady kind of thing you want me anxious oh God I can't I can't buy this you know because you buy something you buy something you didn't need remember precious brother you're going to be with the Lord you always like to buy yourself and everything you come up just give it some a month or three months and see if I really need it afterwards he didn't even just wanted it because the devil have so flash here boy your eyes has just blinked so plates four or five times and you catch you devil making sure all the offers now were so shiny and and Dandy's he keeps on your eyes like Mother's Day the amount of people with gifts out there everybody has something selling for Mother's Day it's a commercial thing mother's money how much money I could make on this Mother's Day that's what you're really about consistency is what going to make a difference consistency is connected to perseverance perseverance is because it's a goal and there's a Target you can't persevere if you have no goal on target if you want to pass mathematics Advance you have a goal if you want to pass English Spanish French technology whatever it is there's a goal there's a Target and you press towards it if there's no target here you're pressing away you just keep on going you want a job what kind of job then when you find out what kind of job you want do you have the qualification for that job if you don't are you going to get the qualification for that job then you don't want the job you're not serious you only talk and you talk you're not walking you talk yet when you are serious you will say wait a minute I want to be in the Army therefore they need this da da da in the Army you can just go with your own hairstyle but you know young is 20 years when they passed through that says there's a normal machine you're using when they pass that motion in your head there's one cut you know you can't say this is who I am they will throw you out next they surely exit because you have to come under discipline because that was the Army is about and guess what God have an army Glory Hallelujah and you whether you like it or not have to come on the discipline [Applause] because you will get yourself killed or somebody killed or get the Lord some Praises my God we send some things today hallelujah hallelujah so perseverance is because he has a goal there's a Target do you have a goal you have a Target in this church you know to make a church I'll make a Revival as a Target as a goal that's only person in two we're getting back to the feet we can't have a Unity of the faith until we come back to the faith itself only when we come back to the field because about Unity we care about get unity and unity you have to come back to the faith phase and when we come out to the faith we can have a Unity of the Fate we'll give the Lord some Praises that's why ghosts are not passenger and a message to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers we have to have the same faith that Peter had and Paul and all them had the feet of the fathers isn't that right all right if there's no Mark okay so there's a Target and that's why Paul said I press towards the mark you must have a Target whether you're planting garden whether you're doing mechanic whatever you must have ambition you must want Excellence you're able to talk about do all that you can do do the best that you can be the best in what you're in you'll just be in it be the best of it light if your family be the best farmer your teacher be the best teacher you are engineer be the best engineer praise God your taxi driver be the best

about mothers did you know that Those portions how Joshua loted them in Palestine was given by inspiration how those Hebrew mothers of those Patriarchs when the baby was coming forward in a travailing pain to deliver the child she uttered the very spot that those paycheck would settle down and being the last days so the mother's grown in was grown in Prophecy of where the son's children children will be placed positionally in the land of Palestine you talk about inspiration this Bible is inspired no matter how little just every little scripture is an outstanding in the script even those mothers when the baby was born she uttered their voice placed them positionally when they will be in a Promised Land hundreds of years later Joshua not knowing that yet by the same inspiration place them exactly where they was to be here the mothers giving birth under the anointing grown in the child's name Ephraim manner said Benjamin Judah she's ruining their names and then going in the name the name identify the position of birth in the land of promise Oh Glory to God and Joshua not knowing what the mothers did the same anointing that came upon the mothers is the same anointing coming upon Joshua to identify where the positionally placed you buy your prayers okay the Lord I shout hey Hallelujah real mothers Hebrew mothers glory to God hallelujah hallelujah look Joshua dividing up divided judah's portion if you notice on the map it's geographically just west of the plain sea a few miles south of Jerusalem at the capital let's continue he had to divide the lands and there were 12 tribes divided what if he had some picks and pets what if he liked the tribe of God better than United tribe of Ephraim tribal Joseph at Judah but he didn't do it that way he divided it here we go according to the word revealed by the spirit he divided it according to the tribe and noticed he done it by the Revelation by this element of God's spirit each one of those Hebrew mothers given birth to those babies called their name and each name have a meaning Jacob means a planter but when he overcome and wrestled with Angel got him Jacob the prince to Israel the name has something to do with your life when Peter a fisherman had overcome by his faith Jesus said your name is Simon I'm going to call you Peter which means there's a rock when this great thing take place each one of these Hebrew mothers in their travailing in childbirth because that's what make a mother a mother they have to bring forth to be a mother and child would call it Reuben that placed him positionally in Palestine exactly the way that mothers call his name Reuben means she heard her God means cataresa Ephraim means corn razor one is she put her one is kakarisa one is corn razor isn't that right but watch a beautiful tight today but today trouble today is when we come to the promised land God wants to raise sheep like Ephraim one one to raise something up like the other every man wants to do the same let God give one man a give a healing every man won't give a healing iframe and God all of them want to mix up and come as one but we are divided in our positions all don't have to give up wisdom

closing with this Jesus he always says in it The Works that I do The Works that I am doing now Healing The Sick raising the dead Open the Eyes of the blind these Works shall you do also you will do these things if you believe in me you will do these works and then are greater than this shall you do because I go to my father did a while the world seeing see me no more yet you will see me I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world I would not leave you comfortless I will pray the father he will send you another comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the world can't receive but you can receive him notice here we go the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out the Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers two believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impact life that is what Calvary meant it took degraded men and women just like you and I and lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart it in our life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient believers take that take that you disobedient inside of here Oh Glory to God take that and think about it very well [Applause] Oh Glory let me read it again it took degraded men and women and lifted down into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart it in their life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient Believers men who were once unbelievers be made Believers and impart spiritual life how much greater is to say to this woman linear I can pray a prayer of faith and should be healed that's a great thing that's what he's doing then but he said greater than this shall you do I'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while but they're giving it in a life will be Eternal forever poor blind wretched people how do you miss that do you not see the greater thing that's the greatest thing that can happen to you is to impart eternal life

that the devil sees wherever you go even when you get depressed and get down and get discouraged and light is still pulsating because it's a germ of life and inside your soul that the devil does not have the authority to remove he doesn't have access to touch it he'll have access to move it he cannot remove it because you are part of God and because you come from God you're going back to God and
