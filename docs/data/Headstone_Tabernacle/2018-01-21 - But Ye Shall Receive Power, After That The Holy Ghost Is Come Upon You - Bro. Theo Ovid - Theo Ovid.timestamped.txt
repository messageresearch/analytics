[53:48] this is what he must expect humans that
[53:51] can move into the spirit worship in the
[53:54] spirit sing in the spirit pray in the
[53:57] spirit shout in the spirit breach in the
[54:01] spirit moving into a channel oh my god a
[54:08] man amen the Prophet said we put too
[54:11] much emphasis on the mechanics and we
[54:14] have that for 50-plus years but we are
[54:16] actually transitioning now into the
[54:19] dynamics we are coming out of that time
[54:22] of lingering which was prophesied by the
[54:25] Prophet a time when things like static
[54:28] just like nothing moving but you just
[54:30] under the anointing of the spirit of
[54:32] prophecy you're knowing t'en of promises
[54:35] because by these promises you become
[54:39] partakers of His divine nature so god
[54:42] bless you and greetings in the precious
[54:43] name of Jesus is such a privilege to be
[54:45] back home
[54:49] amen and amen
[54:51] attended the funeral service service of
[54:54] sister Coleman and I believe that it
[54:59] closes a great chapter in Brides history
[55:02] I truly believe their turn I I just
[55:08] talked a little bit see how it goes
[55:10] today Haman so sit down relax you come
[55:14] to church
[55:18] ah before I start the other finance I'll
[55:25] just read it from second Timothy 4:1 is
[55:27] I charge thee therefore before God and
[55:29] the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge
[55:31] the quick and the dead at his appearing
[55:33] at his kingdom preach the word be
[55:38] instant in season out of season reprove
[55:43] rebuke exhort with all long-suffering
[55:48] and doctrine why for the time will come
[55:52] when they will not endure sound doctrine
[55:57] sound doctrine but after their own lusts
[56:02] shall they heap to themselves teachers
[56:04] having itching ears and they shall turn
[56:08] away their ears from the truth and shall
[56:11] be turned unto fables but watch thou in
[56:15] all things
[56:16] - until afflictions tree do the work of
[56:22] revenge list for make full proof of thy
[56:26] ministry so that is what Paul was tellin
[56:30] there's quite an experience of Paul the
[56:34] Apostle to be going through all these
[56:35] stuff with the early church because
[56:37] there were some serious issues and
[56:39] challenges that had to be dealt with and
[56:41] to be met so he went to the funeral and
[56:45] ministers give just some money and I I I
[56:48] didn't get any guidelines as such I
[56:50] guess we put thought that I got after
[56:52] what was the theme and so on like that
[56:54] and it seems like I went outside of the
[56:56] team to see what I said and I understand
[56:59] somebody made a clip of it and it went
[57:01] viral and people said oh watch it on
[57:03] what not or minister and train that
[57:04] hijack the funeral service and so on
[57:07] like that and said his stuff something
[57:10] like that some people were very unhappy
[57:12] some people offended and I'm I didn't
[57:14] mean to offend anyone
[57:15] and some people were pleased so six of
[57:18] one half a dozen the other it doesn't
[57:20] matter with me really what matters with
[57:23] me is what God puts up on my heart if
[57:26] somebody tell me I can't see this I
[57:28] capricious and somebody has Church I'll
[57:29] respect that
[57:30] but if there's no guidance given I will
[57:32] always speak what is upon my heart and
[57:37] there is something coming to my heart
[57:40] about Tom when you go to court they ask
[57:43] you do you pledge or swear to speak the
[57:45] truth the whole truth and nothing but
[57:50] the truth and there's a reason why those
[57:53] three things are involved what the first
[57:57] part means are you going to lie don't
[58:01] like tell the truth now if it's telling
[58:05] the truth
[58:05] make sure is the whole truth and nothing
[58:09] but the truth don't act it and send
[58:11] truth a different way so it's the truth
[58:16] don't lie the whole truth and nothing
[58:19] but the truth
[58:19] and I remember thinking 2012 in New
[58:22] Yorkers preaching I was talking about
[58:23] facts and truth sometime the fact is not
[58:26] the truth talk about a car break down
[58:30] and you see somebody coming out of a bar
[58:32] with a container and they say yes I seem
[58:35] comedy rump shop but his radiator over
[58:38] overheating and he went to get some
[58:40] water to plan around it no the fact is
[58:42] he did comedy rum shop but what is the
[58:45] truth was he drinking rum shake a go
[58:49] over the report he comedy rum shop I saw
[58:51] him I saw him any other contingent is on
[58:53] the boot but that's not the truth so
[58:58] that's what the court want is the whole
[58:59] truth so don't just take words and that
[59:02] is why the Bible have safeguards it said
[59:06] do not receive an acquisition against an
[59:09] elder unless there are two or three
[59:12] witnesses and these witnesses must be
[59:17] tried before they even give witness
[59:21] because have liars
[59:24] I have a lying spirit an alliance for it
[59:27] cannot speak truth actually a lying
[59:30] spirit volunteered to jump on 400 men
[59:34] that lines break direct from he'll say
[59:36] he volunteered Gordon pay him body
[59:39] invite him he did he let me go
[59:42] permission please to jump on all of them
[59:44] the prophesy a lie that the Word of God
[59:47] will come to pass
[59:49] hallelujah and God said I desire truth
[59:53] from the inward parts God desire truth
[59:58] from us it's just very interesting
[1:00:02] experience and I got some emails both
[1:00:07] negative and positive but I would read a
[1:00:11] positive one for you I got blasted don't
[1:00:20] worry I thank them for being able to
[1:00:23] freely communicate with me I I will take
[1:00:28] hit mills angle meals whatever it is and
[1:00:31] I'll respond I have no problem with that
[1:00:34] i'ma just cool one second praise the
[1:00:37] Lord
[1:00:37] okay so I want to read this one for you
[1:00:40] but strange are two of the brothers who
[1:00:44] wrote me negatively and offended and
[1:00:46] upset and so on they seem to be saying
[1:00:48] something that is so strange
[1:00:50] they said the revealing of it is the
[1:00:54] vindication of it because I was dealing
[1:00:56] with people claiming to be the Holy
[1:00:58] Ghost
[1:00:58] see so the revealing of it is the
[1:01:03] vindication of it the season is now not
[1:01:06] written as you see what are we waitin
[1:01:10] for
[1:01:11] what vindicate some ministry is
[1:01:14] revelation on the word whether it be a
[1:01:17] prophet or the Apostle I am the Holy
[1:01:20] Spirit revelation is the vindication of
[1:01:24] the ministers who preached it now that
[1:01:26] is so I mean this was so deceived that
[1:01:29] they actually believe that our
[1:01:32] revelation is the vindication
[1:01:34] they're not saying it has to compare
[1:01:36] with the rest of the word but the
[1:01:37] revelation is the vindication but any
[1:01:39] I'll read it to you and so on
[1:01:42] I said arm this person says I now find
[1:01:45] myself god bless you richly okay I don't
[1:01:50] know if you know me at all this business
[1:01:52] writing I now find myself as part of
[1:01:56] 7,000 that were the cool months that are
[1:01:58] all day under the Seventh Seal of life
[1:02:00] under them pushes out there and are now
[1:02:04] beginning to come alive realizing that
[1:02:06] all the lies that was told etc the Holy
[1:02:09] Spirit told me last week to go to the
[1:02:12] funeral service and act civil towards
[1:02:14] the people and that it would Electrify I
[1:02:18] had no idea how profound those words
[1:02:22] would turn out to be and the subject he
[1:02:24] hadn't in a subject line was
[1:02:26] electrifying
[1:02:27] your words of pure inspiration was such
[1:02:30] a comfort to the very few of us still
[1:02:33] standing you have no idea how much they
[1:02:37] meant to us we were all in agreement
[1:02:39] that the seven thunders would get yet
[1:02:43] have to gather the bride together and
[1:02:45] they are the bride revival and we'll
[1:02:49] wake her up again and sure how to
[1:02:52] prepare in the time of life revival and
[1:02:55] the manifestation will be the
[1:02:57] interpretation thank you so much for
[1:03:00] being fearless your powerful exhortation
[1:03:02] and a few words totally revived our
[1:03:05] expectation for that David to finally
[1:03:08] come on the scene and prove the seven
[1:03:10] seat on the spot and the sheep of God
[1:03:13] will come screaming forth no false
[1:03:16] anointed will be able to hold him back
[1:03:19] no kind of way thank you and God bless
[1:03:28] amen praise the Lord
[1:03:32] so I just want to tidy up what we spoke
[1:03:37] about before leaving when I speak about
[1:03:40] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:03:42] shall set you free because the church
[1:03:44] was hijacked and before that you it was
[1:03:45] hijacked or the person was on the clip
[1:03:47] say that I hijack the funeral service
[1:03:50] but actually I was typin that brother
[1:03:54] Coleman's wife is also the church and
[1:03:57] the church got all messed up and as a
[1:04:00] reason why it was messed up so I wasn't
[1:04:02] just taken sister Coleman as such but I
[1:04:04] talking about the condition of his
[1:04:05] church because children not even in a
[1:04:07] church today and something is wrong and
[1:04:09] it's a reason for that
[1:04:10] external outside influences has affected
[1:04:13] the church and I was talking about the
[1:04:15] word sovereignty sovereignty means no
[1:04:17] outside influences this church is a
[1:04:20] sovereign Church nobody can tell us what
[1:04:22] to sing one not to sing what the priests
[1:04:24] not what to preach this is a sovereign
[1:04:26] church and the reason the Prophet wanted
[1:04:28] it that way and the Bible have it that
[1:04:31] way is that no bishop will come over the
[1:04:34] people I remember we went I while we
[1:04:37] were six people in Cairo and I better
[1:04:39] tell me some kind of thing I see our
[1:04:40] children suffering easily only our six
[1:04:42] is sovereign six sovereign people
[1:04:46] [Applause]
[1:04:51] we Ord for Burrell joins Riley was there
[1:04:54] and what mentions a bridge fry or day if
[1:04:58] to fly is two more remain and I preached
[1:05:01] that to the accent and that's all about
[1:05:02] George Lucas rissalah Sandhya that's
[1:05:04] right I am on the word I am NOT this
[1:05:08] side and that side I'm on the world I
[1:05:10] will stay with that word hallelujah
[1:05:15] so he passed as the money just gonna be
[1:05:18] free this morning because he saw the man
[1:05:20] set me free already who the son of man
[1:05:23] set free it's free
[1:05:25] ha ha ha indeed so I came to the Lord
[1:05:31] 975 baptize nothing February 15 1975
[1:05:35] after which I used to go up in the hills
[1:05:38] and love until and the empty houses
[1:05:40] abandoned houses as they once seek the
[1:05:42] Lord and pray I had a hunger in and
[1:05:45] distant for God I remember one day came
[1:05:50] home my sister I was stealing my sister
[1:05:52] that time and her daughter I think we
[1:05:55] got her was one year old or whatever it
[1:05:57] is in the crib and I was seeing that
[1:06:00] room she had a baby daughter and I
[1:06:04] closed the door forgot she I was
[1:06:07] sleeping I closed the door locked the
[1:06:08] door not begin the crowd and seek the
[1:06:10] Lord an explosion of white light came
[1:06:13] into my life
[1:06:14] that was my first supernatural
[1:06:16] experience with God but talked much
[1:06:18] about it but after that experience the
[1:06:21] presence of God was in my heart and I
[1:06:24] had dissonant I'm telling you after that
[1:06:28] experience the world's from the spoken
[1:06:32] word books used to quicken to me it's
[1:06:35] like I feel like it coming out and go
[1:06:36] inside again just like that that's how
[1:06:38] it could in so much that was 17 years
[1:06:41] old in so much that I talked to the
[1:06:44] pastor and I told the pastor I am NOT
[1:06:47] being fed no this is a holy man you know
[1:06:50] you like your beef you steak rice and
[1:06:52] peas a hungry man coming hungry the
[1:06:56] income for conflicts and milk
[1:06:58] you come first seven course menu they
[1:07:00] come for the real deal so I was telling
[1:07:03] the pastor I said I I find it when I
[1:07:05] read the book somebody ran and he's
[1:07:07] speaking prophetically he's freaking
[1:07:09] present tense he's preaching about the
[1:07:11] past but but what you give him it kind
[1:07:13] of short I said but I am staying here
[1:07:17] because the word says don't forsake the
[1:07:20] assembling of yourselves together so I
[1:07:23] wasn't moving anyway I'm staying there
[1:07:24] so if I could get whatever getting I'm
[1:07:26] taking it I was in February March April
[1:07:30] May and May but Coleman came to Trinidad
[1:07:34] and I went to the meetings was dontcha
[1:07:36] bonus and I listened and I bought record
[1:07:41] but what he spoke was the truth and I
[1:07:45] receive him as a servant of Christ and I
[1:07:47] receive what were spoken about these
[1:07:49] seven thunders got any bright together
[1:07:52] and seven thunders we should have I
[1:07:53] talked to BP and seven thunders we'll
[1:07:55] give the back feet I went back to the
[1:07:58] pastor very excited
[1:07:59] see will you preach what that man
[1:08:01] treated in who is was his name didn't
[1:08:03] even stick at that time he said you have
[1:08:06] to consult Billy Paul I see Billy Paul I
[1:08:10] said but the man quoted what the Prophet
[1:08:12] said let me know he is not going to
[1:08:16] preach what that man preach then I told
[1:08:18] him I'm gone we're going I don't know
[1:08:23] but certainly not staying I've I walked
[1:08:27] out what age 17 years old and I began to
[1:08:31] look for any church that preaching close
[1:08:33] to anything that that man was preaching
[1:08:35] to and that is how I end up in the
[1:08:37] church that I was in years ago and stay
[1:08:40] there until things unfold and remember
[1:08:45] I'm saying these things that give
[1:08:47] witness of how things unfold in my life
[1:08:49] and maybe never share this with before
[1:08:51] and I want to speak it and so on like
[1:08:53] that and at that time we were about
[1:08:56] Lopez was the past at a time but 19 I
[1:08:58] was under him and then things didn't
[1:09:00] work out well for him the church brook
[1:09:02] and then we went up north and Brian was
[1:09:05] my pastor and then he used to work next
[1:09:08] door to me
[1:09:09] and so on one day the Holy Spirit told
[1:09:11] me when he moves from next door
[1:09:15] make high with your home church then but
[1:09:19] a nicer Brandeis that but nice was
[1:09:21] abundant in church at that time but
[1:09:23] Joseph's in Cairo I spoke to power
[1:09:25] nights I said don't tell anybody I told
[1:09:26] him and I told butter George said don't
[1:09:29] tell anybody and I my diary
[1:09:31] I've been dark 1981 diary right inside
[1:09:33] the office right now that he could read
[1:09:35] hope things unfold because those days I
[1:09:37] said write down everything and then
[1:09:38] everything what the Lord spoke and
[1:09:40] everything else and a couple of months
[1:09:42] afterwards they move him out move the
[1:09:44] Holy Department out then I make I well
[1:09:46] my home church that is how I end up
[1:09:49] there by God speaking to do that then
[1:09:52] remember Tim brother George was there at
[1:09:55] night in Cairo well in a prayer meeting
[1:09:57] we know if something you don't know why
[1:10:00] all is a guy will have no lights like
[1:10:02] these at the pump the gas lamp but
[1:10:05] you're smiling right now
[1:10:05] sometime ago by the well to get water
[1:10:07] and yeah just a walk not even bicycle it
[1:10:11] has to walk at the walkie how much mr.
[1:10:13] Granger two months about two months
[1:10:20] walking two months and one night prayin
[1:10:24] and a vision Brook and I saw a book come
[1:10:29] down and that book marked the second
[1:10:31] coming of the Lord and that was a
[1:10:33] message that the prophet spoke so I got
[1:10:36] the book went into the book when we
[1:10:38] found that spot when we say when the
[1:10:39] church finds is Bradley love when the
[1:10:41] church finds his holy decency when the
[1:10:43] chief finds is pleased in Christ and so
[1:10:45] on and has told them I said this has to
[1:10:48] be revealed and God brought a revelation
[1:10:50] of brotherly kindness but George is our
[1:10:52] witness and so on the spirit poured out
[1:10:54] and what that was quite an experience
[1:10:56] for us God vindicated a revelation by
[1:10:59] your point of his Spirit and that is how
[1:11:01] I came to claim this revelation orderly
[1:11:04] kindness not in 2010 in 1981
[1:11:09] nah 2010 1981 what give me a revelation
[1:11:14] of early kindness so I know trillion
[1:11:16] aliens and trade that gave work women a
[1:11:17] hard time so when I went to the States
[1:11:19] for the first time was 1981 to 1981 only
[1:11:24] 1982 but I kind of didn't 981 but but uh
[1:11:29] mommy took me to him and he said I want
[1:11:32] to introduce to her brother they'll have
[1:11:33] a testimony of brotherly kindness and I
[1:11:36] came to her home and I we met and greet
[1:11:38] later on
[1:11:39] he told me that when I was walking
[1:11:41] towards him the Lord told him join
[1:11:44] yourself to that man laughter no I do
[1:11:46] understand that but that's what he told
[1:11:48] me later on as he would know in a
[1:11:50] testimony and so on he said the Holy
[1:11:52] Spirit told him put butter over than the
[1:11:54] meetings and training because I have a
[1:11:57] work God has a work for him to do and
[1:12:01] that is how being muted and so on so I
[1:12:04] want to see this to you I went to New
[1:12:07] York by revelation with revelation I
[1:12:13] will say it again I went to New York by
[1:12:18] revelation with revelation when I was
[1:12:21] invited to speak in 1989 I was a manie's
[1:12:25] and the Lord spoke to me and says the
[1:12:28] manifestation of the sons of God that
[1:12:30] was my message and when I came and I
[1:12:32] preached Burcham I said that was the
[1:12:34] inspiration he had I didn't consult with
[1:12:36] man I didn't ask anybody and since that
[1:12:38] time he has never asked me what I'm
[1:12:40] going to preach what is my inspiration
[1:12:42] it has always been free whatever God put
[1:12:44] up on my heart and the inspiration that
[1:12:46] have been among us is what I take to
[1:12:48] this foreign things and so on well no I
[1:12:50] get messages on this front of fields and
[1:12:52] a plane wherever doesn't really matter
[1:12:53] but are trying a point to you that God
[1:12:56] speaks
[1:12:58] what have a voice gonna still talk to
[1:13:01] people we were in Cairo while we build a
[1:13:05] small wooden church and then after a
[1:13:08] while the Lord spoke to me that we've
[1:13:10] been sonic Randy where we I know when I
[1:13:12] told the people that they are come after
[1:13:14] all I said nobody believed that I say
[1:13:16] well even if nobody that doesn't change
[1:13:18] it if God said it it will come to pass
[1:13:22] well you are sitting down right now Oh
[1:13:24] what God said
[1:13:27] [Applause]
[1:13:32] I didn't write down all these things so
[1:13:40] resting just sequencing in my mind right
[1:13:41] now Sunday flippy and preparing and
[1:13:43] sauna but might not be in order so I
[1:13:45] just shame with you what God didn't son
[1:13:47] like that so I share this before what
[1:13:53] division what 30-plus years ago of this
[1:13:55] thing where nakum was to kill me and my
[1:13:56] wife jumped down and block our sister
[1:14:00] was standing next our pasta on top the
[1:14:03] platform people are looking for it to
[1:14:05] die then you just waited for this
[1:14:07] monster to finish T of it off as I seen
[1:14:11] a plane just look at nobody I'm moving I
[1:14:13] went under it looked she jumped down and
[1:14:15] come between and I knew it was spiritual
[1:14:18] I know it have significance the sister
[1:14:21] was not in my church so when she came to
[1:14:23] this church 1993 I knew she had to go
[1:14:26] back this is vision this is behind the
[1:14:29] scenes now 1999 see what what he went
[1:14:32] back and a witch and proceeded monster
[1:14:34] common 2000 1 2 3 4 5 here it comes
[1:14:37] and I knew was ought to take me the cut
[1:14:41] a long story short I was off the fields
[1:14:43] for 6 years 10 2009 the Lord spoke to me
[1:14:47] he said you'll be back on the fields I
[1:14:49] didn't understand till this year that it
[1:14:52] meant that whole seed was over and you
[1:14:55] the church was represented by my wife
[1:14:58] and Marie
[1:15:00] so you the church that's why I love you
[1:15:03] and appreciate you and value you you are
[1:15:05] the ones that stood between me being
[1:15:07] destroy because when that happened in
[1:15:11] 2005 I thought that was it I was ready
[1:15:14] to join the sponge and then my wife ah
[1:15:17] this is good when Gore column an he call
[1:15:20] his wife
[1:15:22] I say it again when God call our money
[1:15:30] call his wife if that man have a place
[1:15:33] in this stitute to do this work he has
[1:15:35] to have a wife in position and my wife
[1:15:38] said stay focused
[1:15:41] that spiritual lady that God gives me
[1:15:43] stay focused and as I talked about that
[1:15:46] lady let me talk a little more when a
[1:15:47] lady those brothers long time they want
[1:15:50] to pick wife for me I won't pick you if
[1:15:51] I know what I said do do that
[1:15:53] you see these women working inside of
[1:15:55] here I say go go provide by for me begin
[1:15:59] to pray and she came by vision also and
[1:16:08] I wasn't fooling so I said she comes in
[1:16:12] sound like this god bless you God bless
[1:16:13] you God bless you I said look at an
[1:16:15] office and one day when it broke my
[1:16:22] dream about her I said lord if you this
[1:16:26] sisters to post my wife revealed to her
[1:16:28] that I am a husband not knowing she
[1:16:31] already got that so she was looking at
[1:16:34] me so we came together by inspiration
[1:16:37] and revelation that is my rib sitting
[1:16:41] right there
[1:16:49] I'm just telling you when guac Holliman
[1:16:53] he call his wife so so so so so this is
[1:16:57] it okay so Lord told me I back on the
[1:17:02] fields let's fast-forward it now 2012
[1:17:07] but I Hardy who built the church came
[1:17:09] and I had personally that D that he died
[1:17:11] I was on my way to service I don't know
[1:17:14] if I talked about it I wounded with the
[1:17:16] breach but God put upon my heart a
[1:17:19] message to preach about dispensation of
[1:17:22] another Ephesians who put it up on my
[1:17:25] heart God put it up on my heart he gave
[1:17:27] me the message he gave me hope identify
[1:17:30] Hobart a woman a cold but a paneled
[1:17:32] message trauma divided and he had his
[1:17:35] own inspiration about himself his family
[1:17:38] and church is not the same thing it's
[1:17:41] two different things
[1:17:41] don't mix it up and I did that okay so
[1:17:46] no calls no invites nothing at all but
[1:17:49] the Lord said you'll be back on the
[1:17:51] fields and if God said that he can't lie
[1:17:54] go to tell stories before they come to
[1:17:57] pass it's a wrong spirit so I got an
[1:18:01] invite for Ghana
[1:18:02] I said whoa Anri there it is and then
[1:18:06] afterwards but a furious impasse safari
[1:18:08] that it wrote not we resigned that they
[1:18:12] booted out he invited me to preach in
[1:18:15] New York a Sunday or Wednesday and come
[1:18:18] back a Sunday Sunday in New York go to
[1:18:20] Pennsylvania he went to preach come up
[1:18:22] with Sunday and okay leave out something
[1:18:26] after preach that message amazingly
[1:18:29] after I preached that message the Lord
[1:18:32] spoke to my heart he said this is to go
[1:18:35] out to the bride I can't explain that
[1:18:37] I have no invites nobody has invited me
[1:18:39] but the Lord told me that God can't lie
[1:18:43] if God speak it has to come to pass so
[1:18:47] when when I was invited to go New York I
[1:18:50] know this is what had to be spoken there
[1:18:51] so I preached the same message across
[1:18:54] there without consulting flesh
[1:18:56] blood I'm telling history
[1:18:59] I do have a telly storm I told you I
[1:19:01] want you to know from this pulpit here I
[1:19:03] don't want you to hear not an outside
[1:19:05] people tell you at home outside you're
[1:19:06] hearing from the horse's mouth
[1:19:08] give another live and direct I'm not
[1:19:11] whispering dinner whispering Pastore no
[1:19:13] I don't do that I don't talk to people
[1:19:15] people behind the back as a gift not to
[1:19:18] do that the gift that I have is the look
[1:19:21] people treat in their eyes I'll tell
[1:19:23] them like it is I don't take no machine
[1:19:25] gun can equip it and I don't do that i
[1:19:28] will stitch it down and use it straight
[1:19:31] to your head I don't want to make no
[1:19:33] mistake I don't want to make a mess
[1:19:35] taken a bullet fly on somebody that not
[1:19:36] supposed to fly on no I don't do that
[1:19:38] one on one that is me okay be behind -
[1:19:43] roughly know my goodness pray the
[1:19:46] gordium is soft three three the charity
[1:19:50] the bond of perfectness you see because
[1:19:53] I can take his smooth slipping I wanted
[1:19:56] real hallelujah because we fight in a
[1:20:00] real devil he is slick and smooth
[1:20:05] so T of it what you see is what you get
[1:20:09] like it was his brother his pastor but
[1:20:12] this Minister brother when he talking ly
[1:20:13] talking normal normal when he gonna put
[1:20:15] bit Lord God anymore twist so once you
[1:20:17] guess what trouble is this boy like he's
[1:20:18] a different person it's a one person you
[1:20:21] talking normal normal we recommend a
[1:20:22] pulpit we will tune intonation change
[1:20:25] and whatnot what kind of scary thing is
[1:20:26] that I know I'm stepping back and forth
[1:20:31] talking mature in enterprise before
[1:20:35] I accept pastorship and I was voted in
[1:20:38] the past and 1982 okay I'm preaches is
[1:20:42] 1979 it's a long time next they're gonna
[1:20:45] be 40 years okay in enterprise the Lord
[1:20:49] shared some stuff with me concerning
[1:20:51] money woman and popularity the Lord show
[1:20:57] me to stay with the world to watching
[1:20:59] the Lord deal with my concern about do
[1:21:02] not impersonate because if you
[1:21:04] impersonate you will die you will know
[1:21:07] who killed Lord kill me which one don't
[1:21:10] imprison it and the next in a lot of
[1:21:12] optimi is about adoption adoption is not
[1:21:17] based upon the people's so this is not
[1:21:19] people's choice this is not I love my
[1:21:22] pasta he's the best man named Tony best
[1:21:24] thing since sliced bread this is not
[1:21:27] that this is between father and son so
[1:21:32] that is why I have never been swayed by
[1:21:35] people whether it's to where there is mm
[1:21:39] because when it come to adoption is not
[1:21:42] the vote of the people
[1:21:43] yoky a vote a man in position please and
[1:21:46] Christ you cannot vote a man to be in a
[1:21:48] fight fool that is not your vote in God
[1:21:52] after place a man there a man was trying
[1:21:54] to climb up in the spirit realm and
[1:21:55] Brahm said only got to put them on there
[1:21:58] go back down and testify to the people
[1:22:00] don't try to climb up we're gonna put
[1:22:01] you
[1:22:03] or glory decor because when God put a
[1:22:06] man in position nobody could take that
[1:22:08] man Oh Oh get the Lord a shout Oh
[1:22:12] hallelujah glory to God that's why the
[1:22:17] bow is the promotion doesn't come from
[1:22:18] the east and the West it comes from the
[1:22:20] Lord or glory the government got promote
[1:22:23] you no man could be more chilled when
[1:22:26] God raised you up no man could put you
[1:22:28] back down these haven't heaven then go
[1:22:31] to hell or get the Lord a shout in the
[1:22:33] house I'm in my own church now all glory
[1:22:38] remember Jason hallelujah we are at home
[1:22:41] right now we have the liberty to say
[1:22:44] what we have to say and we understand Oh
[1:22:47] Lord God give us a voice to speak Oh
[1:22:50] glory we go to speak the land of roared
[1:22:54] the not spoken you can but prophesy Oh
[1:22:59] hallelujah give the Lord a shout
[1:23:03] Laurene Oh God what child we belonged
[1:23:07] about over Judah as he tried I said that
[1:23:13] were in the east
[1:23:14] okay where we had long so I'm in the New
[1:23:20] York and preach people rejoice and
[1:23:22] shouted and hungry for the message and
[1:23:24] so on like that and then the storm was
[1:23:26] coming
[1:23:27] so I'm sandy I believe it was I was the
[1:23:29] lead the next day I said no way
[1:23:31] my esteem running at the rented car I'm
[1:23:34] worried up at got a phone call but in
[1:23:38] England didn't like the message that I
[1:23:39] preached way message the Lord who tell
[1:23:47] maybe on e-fields the Lord and I know
[1:23:49] what appreciate and this guy didn't like
[1:23:52] the message I said okay I will talk to
[1:23:55] him when I get to Pennsylvania when
[1:23:57] Irish Pennsylvania I'll give him a call
[1:23:59] I said I understand you didn't like the
[1:24:02] message of the preach I didn't know what
[1:24:04] he didn't like it in it
[1:24:06] I said uh-uh we have become too arrogant
[1:24:10] we have become too proud I said the Lord
[1:24:13] did all of this to see what's in our
[1:24:15] heart the humble us and to prove us in
[1:24:18] it I remember talking about Isaiah when
[1:24:21] Isaiah got in the presence of God he
[1:24:23] said woe is me Isaiah's it was you he
[1:24:28] said woe is me I spoke about when I'm
[1:24:30] uncommon the presence of work to have
[1:24:31] one effect on every profit on every
[1:24:34] messenger any person going into prison
[1:24:36] it's not one effect it has make you feel
[1:24:39] like you're nothing silly young nobody
[1:24:42] nobody ever gets in God's presence and
[1:24:44] stock up on the trust nobody
[1:24:46] I fell as one death
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:54] could we give the Lord a show that's
[1:24:58] what John did listen John was me Jesus
[1:25:02] John Jesus and John eat Jesus fish
[1:25:06] and bread and all everything else but
[1:25:10] when on the Isle of Patmos when Jesus
[1:25:12] come in his glory he said I fell as one
[1:25:15] dead why put a pranam in that vision
[1:25:18] broke he was packed in the corner he
[1:25:20] said you know about the power of God you
[1:25:22] don't know about the power of God little
[1:25:24] bubble dancing this is a fearful thing
[1:25:27] to come into the presence of God Isaiah
[1:25:30] saw the train of the Lord High and
[1:25:32] lifted up dangerous fine back and foot
[1:25:35] holy holy Lord God Almighty the whole
[1:25:38] earth is full of your glory high in the
[1:25:41] spirit he will always be I'm undone I'm
[1:25:46] a man of unclean lips and I dwell among
[1:25:48] people of unclean lips for my eyes I've
[1:25:51] seen the glory
[1:25:53] then the voice of the Lord said who will
[1:25:56] go for us there is a here am I send me
[1:26:00] Oh Gloria caught but the other confess
[1:26:02] worries me maybe they didn't like that I
[1:26:06] don't know so I call him I say brother I
[1:26:09] was really talking kahi and gruntin the
[1:26:13] other end of the phone that's it brother
[1:26:16] I will not let any man on it tell me
[1:26:21] what to preach I said the three wise men
[1:26:25] one bought frankincense one bought gold
[1:26:29] one bought myrrh they brought the
[1:26:32] revelation that God give them but
[1:26:34] together it make a message God a service
[1:26:36] to die
[1:26:37] yes no what was the inspiration I tell
[1:26:39] them suddenly coming Sunday never came
[1:26:41] because it crash the other two services
[1:26:43] because of this storm and that was it
[1:26:45] and after that I was cut off from that
[1:26:48] signal no problem hard to meet one of
[1:26:53] his surrogates and another brother in
[1:26:55] Pennsylvania and they I began to talk to
[1:26:57] them began the Ark's I'm about the
[1:26:58] condition of the believers that got run
[1:27:00] off the believes that had my bachelor's
[1:27:02] the believers that were weak
[1:27:03] that was my concern I said how will new
[1:27:07] name help them how will pitch your for
[1:27:09] help them help them I'm live begin to
[1:27:11] say this story and what not so then
[1:27:13] began a talk a certain way I said well
[1:27:14] this church is suffering and Warner
[1:27:17] Brothers hit the bench and said that's
[1:27:19] consent we should not go back to
[1:27:21] serenity it will break the unity then I
[1:27:24] know there were plumb off the world
[1:27:25] because without sovereignty there can be
[1:27:28] no unity we must be sovereign because
[1:27:30] the early church the reason the church
[1:27:32] failed listen listen listen the reason
[1:27:35] the church filled is because they take
[1:27:38] the anointing from off the people and
[1:27:40] put it on a man and put it on a holy
[1:27:43] order and then eventually come on a pope
[1:27:46] now what is the argument Catholics have
[1:27:49] Peter gave the keys they don't know
[1:27:53] another scripture no he is the first
[1:27:55] pope
[1:27:56] I'm if you had iki he could ban me
[1:27:59] recipe books because he has the key what
[1:28:04] a flimsy argument in the beginning was
[1:28:07] the world was at with God in the wood
[1:28:08] was gone so this is how things unfold
[1:28:14] and after I preached in New York there
[1:28:16] I got quarrels I got our people
[1:28:18] interested and invited me and so on like
[1:28:20] that and that is how it kind of spread
[1:28:22] around whatnot so to go Ghana no I I was
[1:28:28] going on everything is fine and so on
[1:28:29] not knowing I got a call to go Haiti
[1:28:34] around the same time that goes somebody
[1:28:36] else and go Haiti and so on I said no
[1:28:39] not knowing this brother he offered to
[1:28:43] pay for the whole convention in Ghana
[1:28:45] but I must be out of it and this is you
[1:28:49] know and totally brother but over it not
[1:28:52] coming to Ghana again he's going Haiti
[1:28:53] so yeah please set up somebody to call
[1:28:56] me to try to get me to go to Haiti -
[1:28:58] telling you this is it this is this is
[1:28:59] politics now I never bring politics
[1:29:01] before but I bring in how did this work
[1:29:03] out there and what you have not been
[1:29:05] hearing this is 2012 mmm this is
[1:29:07] stealing this is very still you know
[1:29:11] this you can't even hot this bread again
[1:29:12] this is stealing
[1:29:14] but this is just for informational
[1:29:16] services of the kind of war and battle
[1:29:20] that behind the scenes so when you come
[1:29:22] here and you see me on fire is fast it's
[1:29:29] all kind of dots and arrows and and so
[1:29:31] dr. Cain you know oh yeah mine but
[1:29:36] anyhow so this is how it is right now so
[1:29:41] we come down to New York now and people
[1:29:44] Clemente sovereignity I went in a
[1:29:46] sovereign Church and whatnot and a new
[1:29:48] church already hijacked on sight people
[1:29:53] don't take it over for passes the night
[1:29:59] that they had a whole story sending
[1:30:01] emails to the back of the rebels that
[1:30:03] was any Church yeah
[1:30:06] I need them no the changing locks and it
[1:30:08] you know could email somebody she looked
[1:30:10] at you Tonica get us outta here you have
[1:30:14] to be dreamin that's a nightmare for you
[1:30:19] think about it think about the gang
[1:30:24] inside here change them to smoke I said
[1:30:27] I got myself here you'll be arrested I
[1:30:31] would change in love before you so this
[1:30:36] is the kind of drama that was behind the
[1:30:38] scenes manipulation lies and some and
[1:30:41] all this stem from the false prophet
[1:30:44] anointing that was released as a lying
[1:30:45] spirit spirit of error that was loosed
[1:30:49] and that bring an error in doctrine now
[1:30:53] you hear me talk my new age but people
[1:30:55] so lazy didn't check a lot what were we
[1:30:59] saying what does new is just teach and
[1:31:01] so like that but I want to bring
[1:31:03] somewhat of it today though I want to
[1:31:05] bring you some other photography that
[1:31:07] you know that you are not the Holy Ghost
[1:31:09] you not God so anyhow I think I wrap up
[1:31:20] with this you know this is a letter
[1:31:23] lower send but I am shocked by this
[1:31:26] brother or just couldn't get some
[1:31:27] highlights and I'll just read it and
[1:31:29] read but a gave us response allowed
[1:31:32] Clues all of this because I want to get
[1:31:33] out of this god bless you my precious
[1:31:35] brother creatures from England need as I
[1:31:37] say I'm very saddened by your recent
[1:31:38] message in New York and your decision to
[1:31:41] reject the tree for revelation something
[1:31:43] which of course came as a surprise to me
[1:31:44] after you had helped to bring the
[1:31:46] inspiration alive with the school of
[1:31:48] Elohim logos and bride is he well until
[1:31:51] his brothers is thus they unsubscribed
[1:31:54] to this false teaching they were warned
[1:31:57] subscribe to it and they press the
[1:32:00] button unsubscribe that was the sin of
[1:32:03] the pastor day he unsubscribe from false
[1:32:06] teaching and orchestrated a kick-out
[1:32:11] nevertheless boy it woulda be nice if
[1:32:15] you would call me which are concerns
[1:32:17] before certain our cause to divide the
[1:32:18] body of Christ
[1:32:19] nevertheless I respect your decision and
[1:32:21] right to follow what you believe the
[1:32:23] bitter - inspiration I was disappointed
[1:32:25] that you didn't come in love and try to
[1:32:27] help me and other ministers and a bride
[1:32:29] to treat not what you felt had gone
[1:32:31] wrong instead of cutting yourself off
[1:32:33] from body of Christ around the world
[1:32:35] that has moved together for so many
[1:32:36] years okay let's go Freda and this is
[1:32:40] but I give a response there better call
[1:32:43] his name thank you for your email and he
[1:32:46] caught from first Corinthians 3:12 about
[1:32:50] Paul's talking about everyman work being
[1:32:52] tried if any man would shall be burned
[1:32:54] he shall suffer loss for himself I
[1:32:55] received I know ye not you are a temple
[1:32:58] of God and the Spirit of God dwelleth in
[1:33:02] you okay so watch so then he says here
[1:33:07] in regards took the concerns you're
[1:33:10] talking about I did not feel led to call
[1:33:13] you my brother I went to seek God's face
[1:33:15] concerning his leadership I always
[1:33:18] consult the Lord for his leadership
[1:33:20] whenever there was a change of temple or
[1:33:22] important decision to make
[1:33:24] he always led me in my 47 years of
[1:33:27] Christian life just as he did when I
[1:33:29] went through the heavy trial with Brunel
[1:33:31] who was in my church for seven years
[1:33:33] however all along my Christian journey
[1:33:36] I always observe people's behavior and
[1:33:40] when it comes to a minister I look at
[1:33:43] the way he steers with the word and the
[1:33:46] life he lives before the people I look
[1:33:48] for Christ's character to see if he will
[1:33:52] stand the test of popularity woman and
[1:33:54] money I always watched that because as
[1:33:57] you know my brother we can't judge a man
[1:33:59] by his gift and the anointing that's
[1:34:01] upon him and the number of followers
[1:34:04] he's got no matter how much vindication
[1:34:07] he claims to have from God this is no
[1:34:10] sign indeed last month being invited to
[1:34:13] preach in New York by butter theory the
[1:34:15] paths of the church dear I preached what
[1:34:17] my Heavenly Father put in my mom to see
[1:34:20] I proudly stood for the Lord Jesus
[1:34:22] Christ I stood for Malachi his father's
[1:34:24] message friend or no friend I stood for
[1:34:27] one of the oldest time-tested members in
[1:34:29] this message when nobody stood for him I
[1:34:32] also stood for the truth sheep of God
[1:34:34] India I did that mine at all to go
[1:34:37] against the grain my brother no matter
[1:34:39] what people may think or see when it
[1:34:41] comes to the Word of God I never
[1:34:43] compromise for popularity I am Not
[1:34:46] Afraid of men they haven't got a heaven
[1:34:47] and they haven't got a hell and I gladly
[1:34:51] exhorted the new your brothers and
[1:34:53] sisters to stay with their pastor that's
[1:34:55] all because I know the man to be a true
[1:34:57] Shepherd the whole world knows but if
[1:34:59] here is a true servant of God a man has
[1:35:01] been trained under the Apostle ik
[1:35:02] ministry for more than 50 years and whom
[1:35:05] God has used my to be since but Akuma
[1:35:06] sleep atcha indeed that god-fearing
[1:35:09] pastor stood with Gore from the
[1:35:11] beginning humbly serving his people
[1:35:14] the man was tending the Sheep of New
[1:35:16] York Church while God's apostle was on
[1:35:18] the field all these years
[1:35:20] let me tell you my brother that it was
[1:35:23] totally outrageous that those brothers
[1:35:25] did the pastor theory
[1:35:27] these past few weeks besides it was
[1:35:30] totally disgraceful on your behalf to
[1:35:32] have encouraged was brothers to take
[1:35:34] authority over their posture and go
[1:35:37] behind his back and solicit people to
[1:35:39] vote him out
[1:35:39] they sure acted like juvenile
[1:35:41] delinquents nor church can vote a pastor
[1:35:45] out except for a moral issue that's what
[1:35:49] we did in 90s and mythix when we found
[1:35:51] out that the pastor was a pervert who
[1:35:53] would have dared to step brother Coleman
[1:35:55] down when he started to heat the buna
[1:35:57] lines and sanctioned those writings on
[1:35:59] the wall has been of God obviously those
[1:36:02] brothers did that with a selfish motive
[1:36:04] according to the intellectual and
[1:36:06] legalistic we not according to God's own
[1:36:09] nature and we are doing things but God
[1:36:11] is not mocked God is not going to bless
[1:36:14] what they did they leave you me to go
[1:36:18] around and try to turn people from their
[1:36:20] god-given pasta and then telling the
[1:36:22] whole world that brother Fiore simply
[1:36:24] decided to resign even the website is
[1:36:30] thanking him and in resign and so on
[1:36:31] that is not the whole truth
[1:36:35] add in sizzle I was not the whole truth
[1:36:42] but if is not equal to design
[1:36:51] this is totally out of order brother
[1:36:53] unchristian like and preposterous
[1:36:56] I sure remind me of this conspiracy of
[1:36:59] Absalom in the book of Samuel brother by
[1:37:01] encouraging them to act like that and to
[1:37:04] conspire against their god-given pastor
[1:37:07] you are the one who was set a course to
[1:37:09] divide the body of Christ if someone is
[1:37:12] not happy with their pasta they have to
[1:37:14] they only have to leave it respectfully
[1:37:16] and go somewhere else
[1:37:17] that is all but the go around calling
[1:37:20] people even go into their jobs and
[1:37:22] pressing them to have vote their pastor
[1:37:24] out such behavior is low dong shameful
[1:37:27] very cheap and you know it what a Steen
[1:37:30] on the message for over 40 years go into
[1:37:35] all the pain Harris conventions I've
[1:37:37] seen many forceful preachers that preach
[1:37:38] like Archangels great gifts of God in
[1:37:41] were part of the disability of the
[1:37:43] fivefold ministry which I sure respected
[1:37:45] some of them are being ordained by God
[1:37:47] as a puzzle but I said to the church
[1:37:48] when you go to a department store when
[1:37:51] you see a display in the window shop
[1:37:53] it's not necessarily what you're gonna
[1:37:55] buy inside but we know that the
[1:37:58] manifestation of charity will tell that
[1:38:01] they will declare it when the members of
[1:38:03] his universe are bribed and very few
[1:38:05] members of this fivefold ministry will
[1:38:07] be adopted it will speak for itself in
[1:38:10] the meantime it is our behavior that
[1:38:14] sets us to adoption not what we see from
[1:38:17] our mount or what we pretend to be
[1:38:20] oh my hallelujah so then he could from
[1:38:24] Tottori unknown to the pastor but I
[1:38:26] never remember he's a full head of the
[1:38:28] church but I never has a right to
[1:38:30] exercise any authority that the Holy
[1:38:32] Spirit would anything the Holy Spirit
[1:38:34] would tell him to say in other words in
[1:38:35] the church he has a right to anything
[1:38:37] that God would lead him to do he can
[1:38:39] have a right over his Deacon board he
[1:38:41] can change the Deacon board the trustee
[1:38:43] board the pianist any office in a church
[1:38:45] he desired a change and feel led of the
[1:38:47] Spirit to do so whatever he does I will
[1:38:49] recognize it because he's a godly man
[1:38:51] recognize it to be of the Lord and will
[1:38:53] sanction the same deer for it gives them
[1:38:55] the authority to operate the church
[1:38:58] so in those 36 years which God allow
[1:39:01] meet by His grace to be close to a
[1:39:03] friend who goes apostle and to be on his
[1:39:05] ministry
[1:39:05] that's perfectly the way I saw him
[1:39:07] handle things in his own local church
[1:39:08] and he taught me to do the same if needs
[1:39:11] be in my own church he would also choose
[1:39:13] himself his own deacons and present him
[1:39:15] to the church that's just the way he
[1:39:16] taught me to do and all those who have
[1:39:18] been on this ministry know very well
[1:39:20] that's the way by the Coleman applied to
[1:39:22] his order throughout many years of his
[1:39:24] pastorship and to add to their lead link
[1:39:27] when behavior these brothers change the
[1:39:29] locks of the New York to its building
[1:39:31] which according to the law is totally
[1:39:33] illegal what did he do that for the lock
[1:39:36] but a fiore out of the church
[1:39:38] indeed I am very disappointed at you my
[1:39:40] brother to me this is poor discernment I
[1:39:42] don't think but a Branham would have
[1:39:44] been happy to see that rude and improper
[1:39:46] behavior more my brother it appears that
[1:39:51] the way you are talking about the body
[1:39:52] of Christ it would be a closed circle of
[1:39:55] ministers and brothers and sisters who
[1:39:57] absolutely share your spiritual views I
[1:39:59] do believe that people can be part of
[1:40:03] the body of Christ even if they don't
[1:40:04] see things exactly the way we zoom and
[1:40:06] butter Brannon said some people will
[1:40:08] have access to all the tips I will never
[1:40:10] make the rapture while some will have
[1:40:12] heard just a few tapes
[1:40:13] I'll make the rapture Paul said do I
[1:40:15] have gift of prophecy understand what
[1:40:17] mysteries all knowledge do I have all
[1:40:18] faith to move mountains but have not
[1:40:20] love I am nothing it's not the end okay
[1:40:25] and then he closed off but this third
[1:40:28] story that you know about the man who
[1:40:29] went gold hog huntin he got his goal he
[1:40:32] had all these nuggets he said tomorrow
[1:40:33] he's going to convert it into cash gonna
[1:40:36] convert it and he gonna have his whiskey
[1:40:38] and whatnot he had a good faithful door

[1:40:50] tried to warn his master because men
[1:40:52] come and bandits come at him and he went
[1:40:54] back and laid on his bed the dog started
[1:40:55] back and again he call him after shut up
[1:40:58] I don't want to hear you I want a lovely

[1:41:06] angry you reach in the corner but a
[1:41:08] double-barrel shotgun went to the door

[1:41:15] you I don't need you anymore anyhow set

[1:45:29] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
[1:45:32] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[1:45:35] Samaria and the uttermost part of the
[1:45:38] earth
[1:45:39] next scripture and he gives some
[1:45:41] apostles Ephesians 4:11 and some
[1:45:44] prophets and some evangelists some
[1:45:45] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[1:45:48] of the Saints for the work of the
[1:45:51] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:45:53] Christ here we all come into the unity
[1:45:55] of the faith of the knowledge of the Son
[1:45:57] of God unto a perfect man unto the
[1:46:00] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:46:02] of Christ that we henceforth be no more
[1:46:04] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:46:07] about with every wind of doctrine by the
[1:46:10] sleight of men and cunning craftiness
[1:46:12] whereby they lie in wait to deceive but
[1:46:16] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[1:46:19] into him in all things which is the head
[1:46:21] even Christ from whom the whole body
[1:46:25] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:46:29] that which every joint supplieth
[1:46:30] according to the effectual working in
[1:46:33] the measure of every part make an
[1:46:37] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:46:39] of itself in love less bore his father
[1:46:42] we thank you for your word may you come
[1:46:44] now and breed life and presence and fire
[1:46:47] upon your word speak to our hearts and
[1:46:49] transform your people here to be more
[1:46:52] like you and Jesus and we ask it amen
[1:46:54] and even you might be seated oh praise
[1:46:56] God hallelujah or something and no
[1:47:00] heresy and it just slipped me because
[1:47:04] what this guy is saying now is that the
[1:47:08] local pastors because they have the own
[1:47:11] faith or a 5-footer enough being tested
[1:47:14] and tried and so on the local pastors
[1:47:17] their job now is to point the people to
[1:47:22] the International angel with the
[1:47:25] faithful and if they don't point the
[1:47:29] people to this International engine with
[1:47:32] this fifl the people have a right to
[1:47:35] over to him
[1:47:38] so that is where this guy leaden I'll
[1:47:42] say this he preached a message years ago
[1:47:46] that caused Burke woman a lot of pain
[1:47:47] the message in title was the
[1:47:50] international crisis local reflection
[1:47:53] and he was trying to present the voice
[1:47:57] of the Archangel New York and that's why
[1:47:59] bakoma had a big big war and the people
[1:48:03] say are we seeing voices like Angela
[1:48:04] what not but what he was saying is that
[1:48:07] they're like headquarters and every
[1:48:09] local church supposed to reflect that
[1:48:11] and Burke overharvested spending years I
[1:48:15] went to defend and trying to show Christ
[1:48:17] is the voice if you got injured he tried
[1:48:19] to make and dist it tried to make him
[1:48:21] that and it was so hard so no it flip
[1:48:25] here's what he didn't know I spoke to
[1:48:28] him years ago and he was young and his
[1:48:31] ministry and so on he didn't know but a
[1:48:33] corpsman asked me to talk to him
[1:48:35] I never told him that I suffered him al
[1:48:39] cafe in London with some English tea an
[1:48:46] English cake
[1:48:49] Satya Eton and I began to talk to him I
[1:48:52] said brother branham said a young
[1:48:55] minister should keep the shuts off of
[1:48:57] him this is what I learned this is what
[1:49:00] I know I told him I have never preached
[1:49:03] a sermon that anybody ever came up to me
[1:49:07] and asked me what do you mean when you
[1:49:10] see that
[1:49:11] why did you see that I have never
[1:49:14] preached a message where there's any
[1:49:16] controversy because I try to see with
[1:49:19] what the prophets see and even though I
[1:49:21] don't quote by the book is I still try
[1:49:23] to speak it so I begin a shared for him
[1:49:26] so I told him why are you a New York
[1:49:29] business why do you want to be New York
[1:49:31] business and you lean forward and say
[1:49:34] why I shouldn't be and afterwards I had
[1:49:37] no more to say so that was it I am in no
[1:49:41] church business I am in nobody business
[1:49:44] I will try to over Church nor Church
[1:49:46] I have never proselyte one prison I've
[1:49:48] never done it we don't have no need to
[1:49:50] do
[1:49:51] on the contrary you know me Odyssey if
[1:49:54] you don't like Italy exit every exit
[1:49:55] sign right there no fight we want people
[1:49:59] that want the word want God won't what
[1:50:03] you read manifested you don't need a
[1:50:06] bishop you need the Holy Spirit and the
[1:50:11] last time I read Christ is the head of
[1:50:13] the church the last time I don't have a
[1:50:16] change now but the last time I read in
[1:50:17] Colossians Christ is the head of the
[1:50:20] body called the church I don't see no
[1:50:22] man is he head I always walk ahead I am
[1:50:25] the head of no church he told Peter upon
[1:50:27] this rock I will build my church so
[1:50:33] Christ have a church and that church is
[1:50:35] the body that touches the body of Christ
[1:50:38] the church is not the head doesn't make
[1:50:41] sense you have a head this is the body
[1:50:44] disconnect if anybody else you have that
[1:50:48] is why Jesus said I am the vine you are
[1:50:51] the branches he said you have to be a
[1:50:54] true to me but if you think you could go
[1:50:57] on your own he said without me you can
[1:51:00] do nothing so you better stay inside the
[1:51:02] vine in order to produce fruit way of
[1:51:06] oil

[1:54:07] Noorie this woman
[1:54:11] she'll be McClean never worn them New
[1:54:14] Age experts 1960s she had spirit guides
[1:54:18] used to be speaking to this dimensional
[1:54:21] column spirit guides spirit guides and
[1:54:23] former that each individual is God and
[1:54:26] she passed along the wisdom each
[1:54:30] individual is the Holy Spirit she pass
[1:54:33] along the wisdom that the person is
[1:54:35] unlimited
[1:54:35] New Age thinking has its roots in
[1:54:38] Eastern mysticism which attempts to
[1:54:40] bypass the main the organ they have to
[1:54:43] die spiritual eyes and whatnot and they
[1:54:45] have the belief that all is one one is
[1:54:47] all history is not the story of
[1:54:50] humanity's fall into sin it and it's
[1:54:53] restoration of God's my saving grace
[1:54:54] that's what we know man fell in sin and
[1:54:56] God by you come and save us
[1:54:58] rather it is humanity fallen to
[1:55:01] ignorance and it's the gradual ascent
[1:55:04] into enlightenment that is the gospel
[1:55:07] enlightenment watch there is a change of
[1:55:11] consciousness listen listen listen if we
[1:55:14] are Holy Spirit we need to know we are
[1:55:17] Holy Spirit if we are God we need to
[1:55:20] know your God we must become cosmically
[1:55:23] conscious and enlightened and attuned to
[1:55:27] the Cosmic Consciousness someone reaches
[1:55:29] and like the status will claim to be
[1:55:31] born again
[1:55:32] listen a conquer feet of biblical
[1:55:35] conversion so that is why all the movie
[1:55:39] stars and all the people like the new
[1:55:40] age thing because new age you have to
[1:55:42] repent because after all I am God our
[1:55:47] movie stars in the same day I am God who
[1:55:49] else see so watch the Ascension is not
[1:55:53] whether we believe on meditate or but
[1:55:55] whom we believe in no one but jesus said
[1:55:58] no one comes to the Father except to me
[1:56:00] so the new ichthyologist a super
[1:56:05] conscious creative integrative self
[1:56:07] organization mine that is part of our
[1:56:11] purchases that constitute our court
[1:56:13] likeness that have no Bible doesn't
[1:56:16] that new haven't report no scenes at the
[1:56:17] break manhattan's tell you that and you
[1:56:22] walk out here ballin i am i am holy
[1:56:25] spirit root montgomery this is
[1:56:32] supposedly channel a spirit that spoke
[1:56:36] to her claiming we are as much God as
[1:56:40] God as part of us each of us is God
[1:56:45] together we are God white steers listen
[1:56:50] that sooner or later every human being
[1:56:54] will feel a call from the cosmos to
[1:56:56] ascend to godhood I'm almost done
[1:57:01] beaten Baha my Louise declares there's
[1:57:06] only one question and once you know the
[1:57:09] answer to that question there's no more
[1:57:11] to ask Who am I
[1:57:13] thirty question answer that and question
[1:57:16] does only one answer I am God after that
[1:57:20] you have no more questions to ask you
[1:57:21] done she'll be McCain recommend that
[1:57:28] every person should begin every day by
[1:57:30] affirming his or whom god would you can
[1:57:34] use I am God I am Holy Spirit I am that
[1:57:37] I am
[1:57:37] as Christ often did so that is why the
[1:57:40] pombe Nam said sit sit I have Holy
[1:57:42] Spirit and understood him a cleansing
[1:57:44] when you see it an anointing comes over
[1:57:45] you just see it so you see what they're
[1:57:49] doing here they're doing affirmation I
[1:57:51] am Holy Spirit he said the Indians I
[1:57:53] call up the common India Hinduism did I
[1:57:56] say I am that we we were saying I am
[1:57:58] that I am I am a healer
[1:58:00] I'm the liver and so on they don't say
[1:58:01] it so did I say I am that I am whatever
[1:58:07] that I am is I am that to cerebral I am
[1:58:10] God so that's why the religion of the
[1:58:11] repentance in it that is not the gospel
[1:58:13] amen I'm almost finished here now with
[1:58:16] this so you can you I am God I am I am
[1:58:20] I am as Christ often did or you can
[1:58:21] extend the affirmation to fit your own
[1:58:23] needs
[1:58:24] you fit it away a wonderful special
[1:58:28] revelation need not exist in books or in
[1:58:33] any form outside of us because each of
[1:58:35] us has our own special revelation of
[1:58:40] consciousness and our own ability to get
[1:58:43] in touch with a part of us that is God
[1:58:47] so the grant is individual the power of
[1:58:50] determinants reality by creating a
[1:58:53] co-creation truth with a powerful
[1:58:54] statement creating own reality
[1:58:57] but all appreciative make the selves our
[1:58:59] own God not the god of the word this
[1:59:02] quarter debatable judge America will not
[1:59:04] be great again that is a lie that'll
[1:59:07] come in the pass right now this
[1:59:09] definitely bums the center America
[1:59:10] judgment is about to strike America
[1:59:12] people make mockery at the prophecy over
[1:59:15] the Brenham about seeing the cars
[1:59:17] without steering wheel this week corn
[1:59:19] here General Motors announced that the
[1:59:22] cars coming out next that within five
[1:59:24] years we'll have no steering wheel but
[1:59:25] her mom was a true prophet he said this
[1:59:28] have to come to pass before Jesus come
[1:59:30] again this has to come to pass before
[1:59:33] the seventh vision war is coming next

[2:01:08] come benda what that I was associated
[2:01:10] with this treat for all all these years
[2:01:11] since 1975 yes so I was part of this
[2:01:17] whole movement of or being blessed by
[2:01:20] all these Bridal promises exclusive by
[2:01:23] the promises but a Panama only Reed is
[2:01:25] here for me similar spirit are we no I
[2:01:28] think is a good thing for us ministers
[2:01:30] to follow our order when we see things
[2:01:33] in the world on we see today we have an
[2:01:35] order from God who is for the zenon of
[2:01:38] spirits trying the spirits and I believe
[2:01:41] that is a very great lesson for the
[2:01:43] church today is to try the spirit of
[2:01:45] anything have discernment of spirit I do
[2:01:49] not think that we should ever judge a
[2:01:51] person by the denomination they belong
[2:01:53] to by the group that they are some
[2:01:55] little bit whatever we are
[2:01:56] we should never judge the man by the
[2:01:58] denomination we belongs to we should
[2:02:00] always judge him by the spirit he has
[2:02:02] the spirit whether he has Lateran for
[2:02:04] marine inner in altering Noreen we
[2:02:06] should assume the spirit watch what the
[2:02:09] man has in mind what he's trying to
[2:02:11] achieve if the man buy a gift listen no
[2:02:14] matter how great the gift is I want you
[2:02:17] to get this to the church this morning
[2:02:18] which define denominations you are still
[2:02:21] the treat of Living God different people
[2:02:23] I tell bridging all the time I don't
[2:02:25] expect everybody to believe the way I am
[2:02:27] I am Mina certainly I am built a certain
[2:02:30] way
[2:02:31] I don't expect every Minister to be like
[2:02:33] me I understand that their ministers
[2:02:35] have different characteristics and the
[2:02:37] people could work with that
[2:02:38] but I am Who I am and you have to
[2:02:42] understand that this is how God made
[2:02:44] this O God make you you have your own
[2:02:46] individual fingerprint nobody has a flaw
[2:02:48] fingerprint that is yours and you should
[2:02:51] rejoice in that you don't have to copy
[2:02:53] from anybody you have to be like anybody
[2:02:55] else you want to be placed in Christ
[2:02:57] hallelujah our individual in God God
[2:03:00] want to bless you you have to get your
[2:03:03] Mountain you have to possess your
[2:03:05] inheritance everyone is given my measure
[2:03:08] I measure our faith a measure of grace
[2:03:11] fight for your measure you need your
[2:03:14] measure you want your measure no man
[2:03:16] should drop you from your measure
[2:03:22] so always 5:45 was another title I want
[2:03:25] to get us corrected fight for Zara title
[2:03:29] fivefold ministry is the ministry of
[2:03:31] Jesus Christ it's not my ministry and
[2:03:34] about over ministry he's a five-o
[2:03:35] minister no it is the Ministry of Jesus
[2:03:38] Christ because what a bottom said I wish
[2:03:40] I did pyramid here he said in these
[2:03:42] virtues the building could still leak it
[2:03:45] was not sealed with charity
[2:03:47] so all these virtues faith and virtue
[2:03:49] and knowledge and temperance all these
[2:03:51] things have to be sealed in Paul call
[2:03:55] charity the bond of perfectness like
[2:03:58] this cement to cement the whole building
[2:04:00] so you could have shared virtual
[2:04:02] knowledge he said instant leaking out so
[2:04:05] you need charity to add to all these
[2:04:07] things but you'll have a things then
[2:04:11] that's Christ in you the hope of glory
[2:04:17] he believed that Oh glory to God so the
[2:04:21] messages and it's a particular quote I
[2:04:24] love the coat when Rama sprain in the
[2:04:26] prayer he said me these mysteries be
[2:04:28] revealed to show the plainness of God
[2:04:31] that we might know how to behave
[2:04:33] ourselves so the mysteries is not
[2:04:36] revealed to us to have argument I have a
[2:04:38] mystery
[2:04:38] your mystery my mystery method on your
[2:04:40] mystery another foolishness the mystery
[2:04:43] being revealed it's the shorter
[2:04:45] plainness of God that we can know how to
[2:04:48] behave because your adoption is based
[2:04:50] upon your behavior their host rights
[2:04:52] will be adopted sisters gonna be adopted
[2:04:55] brothers gonna be adopted yet is nowhere
[2:04:58] that prophet said he said the world will
[2:05:00] bow at the feet and melon woman who
[2:05:03] crossed Jordan or get a lot of shut
[2:05:06] doors woman not on the faith or ministry
[2:05:09] but those woman went to be filled with
[2:05:12] God
[2:05:16] Oh hallelujah we gonna some godly woman
[2:05:22] there are some godly Sons what put you
[2:05:25] in his evil issue overcome he put you
[2:05:28] because you know you could overcome it
[2:05:29] he put overcoming inside of you it's the
[2:05:32] outside is inside of you before Bellanca
[2:05:35] come david was gonna get that stone that
[2:05:38] spoon was already here you ever stood
[2:05:41] for you're glad every call out in your
[2:05:43] life there's the spawns that every force
[2:05:47] in your life
[2:05:50] Oh God hallelujah hallelujah glory to
[2:05:56] God amen
[2:06:00] so we are not divided
[2:06:02] we are stones that's cut in different
[2:06:04] forms I wish I had the pyramid here
[2:06:11] because two things I wanted to show you
[2:06:13] you see one reflect the age like fate
[2:06:16] read Paul virtue unison it doesn't mean
[2:06:19] that paulownia fate you know if you
[2:06:21] believe that is cuckoo Paul had the Holy
[2:06:24] Ghost the Holy Ghost consists of two
[2:06:27] seven spirits she's not Paul it
[2:06:29] represented an age so that is right at
[2:06:32] Holy Ghost rut represent the bride age
[2:06:34] because the seven ages in this age is
[2:06:36] hidden mystery it's a bright edge under
[2:06:39] but but in in virtues now all it in
[2:06:42] virtues that holy or is the Spirit
[2:06:44] of Christ by ramesses coming into the
[2:06:47] church to manifest the virtues
[2:06:49] [Applause]
[2:06:58] this is what cause people have seen
[2:07:00] nobody of the illegals because I see the
[2:07:03] holy goes at the top it ma Holy Spirit
[2:07:06] so they said nobody have the Holy Ghost
[2:07:08] because the Holy Spirit is at the top
[2:07:10] this is like a revolution but the Holy
[2:07:12] Ghost is from the bottom to the top
[2:07:14] [Applause]
[2:07:17] do we have the pyramid you go victory
[2:07:21] yes confer get a stand for me I want I
[2:07:22] want to shoot up put in screen okay fine
[2:07:25] let's that's great when they puts it up
[2:07:27] on the screen you go see it when you see
[2:07:29] it because two things involved they're
[2:07:31] watching it from the edge perspective
[2:07:34] and watching it from the the the natural
[2:07:37] put the human perspective the individual
[2:07:41] perspective you see one saying so if you
[2:07:43] look at it from the ears procession and
[2:07:45] you mix it up you can say we add the
[2:07:47] Holy Spirit because eNOS left my Holy
[2:07:51] Spirit and we nothing loudly sir we in
[2:07:53] the Holy Spirit but what does that mean
[2:07:56] that means we are the Holy Spirit so
[2:07:59] Paul is hidden I realize were children
[2:08:02] your honor Sampson and they represented
[2:08:05] seven spirits but these guys have some
[2:08:08] fiat authority Paul was adopted
[2:08:11] B that was adopted they were vindicated
[2:08:13] sons they were speaking the word cast no
[2:08:16] Devils
[2:08:17] [Applause]
[2:08:23] [Music]
[2:08:26] oh there we go okay all right
[2:08:41] so here we have Paul Aranea smut and
[2:08:44] Columbo Luther Wesley pan signature this
[2:08:46] is representing the ages it doesn't mean
[2:08:50] that brother Branham only had brotherly
[2:08:51] kindness
[2:08:52] so he's broadly kindness he was adopted
[2:08:57] he had all these things here this
[2:09:00] l.o.v.e is not even charity when the
[2:09:04] Prophet reveal l.o.v.e he said l.o.v.e
[2:09:07] is Christ
[2:09:08] corporal body under Christ is his spirit
[2:09:16] [Applause]
[2:09:18] do you understand that now so if
[2:09:20] somebody get mixed up they go screw up
[2:09:22] this thing big time on the Christ
[2:09:25] corporal body is his spirit coming into
[2:09:28] the church to manifest these things
[2:09:30] these things have to be in you okay the
[2:09:34] Lord our show
[2:09:36] these things iron you because the secret
[2:09:40] is the word is enterprise give the Lord
[2:09:45] a shout
[2:09:47] or get the Lord our show
[2:09:52] Oh hallelujah
[2:10:00] both glory to God feeling inspired now

[2:10:09] praise God praise God you may be seated
[2:10:11] praise God thank you lord hallelujah
[2:10:15] glory all right
[2:10:20] [Music]
[2:10:26] what a what a Brandon say but a Branham
[2:10:30] says no we see this is from to the
[2:10:32] Exodus now we see the wheel in the
[2:10:33] wheels moving God reads plan moving up
[2:10:35] to get the people lap in the land again
[2:10:37] into a place in a position we could
[2:10:40] bless them remember they have to come
[2:10:42] out of the land they were in to get in
[2:10:44] the land of promise before the promised
[2:10:46] Messiah had come and the church has to
[2:10:48] do the same thing get out of that Koopa
[2:10:50] rejecters over into the promise before
[2:10:54] Messiah and ever be manifested to them
[2:10:57] everybody in churches that reject the
[2:10:59] true Messiah inspiration after come out
[2:11:01] to see Messiah but this is the part of
[2:11:04] when I get to the life of the Messiah
[2:11:07] manifested making a church ready a bride
[2:11:11] not mistress being preached but the life
[2:11:15] this is a life here hallelujah brother
[2:11:20] Branham was so much like Jesus they took
[2:11:22] him for Jesus okay the Lord a shout
[2:11:25] he was walking like Jesus he was talking
[2:11:28] like Jesus he was manifesting Jesus the
[2:11:31] life of Jesus have to be manifested or
[2:11:34] canceled or - oh or chlorine or God
[2:11:39] the life of Jesus must be manifested to
[2:11:43] make the church ready
[2:11:46] Old Glory does Gordon and hallelujah
[2:11:50] let me see said I'm from census this
[2:11:53] time but a Brenham might be closer than
[2:11:55] you think
[2:11:56] it cooked me scared haven't done enough
[2:11:58] where are we at time shall be no more
[2:12:02] he unknown to that time is over what
[2:12:05] happens could that be so if it is then
[2:12:09] the pyramid is kept by the seven
[2:12:11] thunders if it is the pyramid is cut by
[2:12:17] the seven thunders so no but a Branum
[2:12:20] put the seven thunders as the Holy
[2:12:23] Spirit how could that be
[2:12:30] because all these seven things is inside
[2:12:32] of you know hear what he says he called
[2:12:40] the elected Lutheran's to make the West
[2:12:42] viens he called elected Westlands to
[2:12:44] make the Pentecostals listen
[2:12:46] now we call the elected penny custer's
[2:12:48] to make the headstone which is this what
[2:12:52] here to come into it this lock is part
[2:12:56] of the temple this lock is part of our
[2:12:59] house he's making a billion for he to
[2:13:02] step into it then the head the next of
[2:13:06] the body then the full power is in the
[2:13:09] body full power in the church that is
[2:13:14] what the tongue does was about
[2:13:16] [Applause]
[2:13:21] let me see said Oh hallelujah
[2:13:26] Denver Ron says you remember the pyramid
[2:13:28] message
[2:13:29] it's a capstone what did it do the Holy
[2:13:33] Spirit capped off the individual when we
[2:13:39] add to our Fiat righteousness goodness
[2:13:43] so forth
[2:13:44] we kept ad until we got seven things and
[2:13:47] the seventh one was love which is God
[2:13:51] know that is how he makes the individual
[2:13:55] and caps him and sees him at the Holy
[2:13:59] Spirit now here we go
[2:14:01] you can translate that know when that
[2:14:04] happens here what you have you want to
[2:14:05] know what you have if that be so he has
[2:14:10] got seventy judges that he had seven
[2:14:13] mysteries that they song it away and

[2:20:49] about I don't know why I preach and all
[2:20:51] and kind of take this morning or glory
[2:20:54] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:20:57] oh my hallelujah praise the Lord thank
[2:21:01] you lord
[2:21:03] there are so many people just by the
[2:21:05] gifts that they have I believe these
[2:21:06] things are gifts I believe that we see
[2:21:08] take place as gifts their god-given
[2:21:09] gifts but if we do not use them the
[2:21:12] right way that God intended them to be
[2:21:14] used then we do more harm with the gifts
[2:21:16] than we could not reach without a kiss
[2:21:18] the other night I made a statement on
[2:21:20] the pulpit saying I would rather see
[2:21:21] bradlee love exist among the church if
[2:21:24] we didn't have one kiss or divine healer
[2:21:26] this is
[2:21:28] important to this no before I got to
[2:21:30] remember Deaconess I had odds against
[2:21:32] people who mistreated me and so on when
[2:21:34] that came all that leave so I could
[2:21:37] rough you up and still love you I got
[2:21:40] whole notes I could rest on the floor

[2:21:45] brother before when I finish with you I
[2:21:49] am looking at you I don't want to talk

[2:21:54] dear

[2:25:52] people together that he making taken his
[2:25:54] gift to make himself famous and he have
[2:25:56] a big name so other people would look up
[2:25:58] to him as a big person that's wrong

[2:47:38] I could go to Mars and I feel them fit
[2:47:41] as a fiddle all right
[2:47:49] today lady these Jews came as he says we
[2:47:53] will see Jesus became disciples and
[2:47:56] Barham says did they didn't want to just
[2:47:59] hear Jesus they want to see Jesus that
[2:48:01] was the purpose of inquiring not they
[2:48:03] haven't explained today with great
[2:48:07] intellectual messages we can explain it
[2:48:09] till you see the picture but that isn't
[2:48:11] what we're looking for tonight we are
[2:48:13] looking not we don't look at our
[2:48:14] mechanics we're looking for the dynamics
[2:48:16] of it that's it so the Bible but lies
[2:48:19] 16:35 coats train signal truck but if
[2:48:21] you haven't got any steam in it it takes
[2:48:23] dynamic to work with the mechanics isn't
[2:48:26] that right well you know notice they
[2:48:29] come to a servant of Christ here we go
[2:48:31] who have been trained to know what to do
[2:48:33] not just his sit down wait wait signal
[2:48:36] he brought them straight to him so the
[2:48:39] disciple Peter said oh you want to see
[2:48:41] Jesus calmly makes me come come come
[2:48:42] have a seat
[2:48:43] I will have tell you all about Jesus
[2:48:45] know these disciples bring the people
[2:48:47] straight to Jesus straight - straight to
[2:48:51] the fivefold no - Jesus straight to the
[2:48:54] International angel no Jesus he brought
[2:48:58] them straight to him because that is
[2:49:02] what they wanted to see this every word
[2:49:04] said Jesus not we would like you to
[2:49:05] explain it to us and tell us what it's
[2:49:07] all about
[2:49:08] well we want to see we want to see the
[2:49:10] person you say but a Branham we will see
[2:49:12] him when he comes yes but he promised in
[2:49:15] the prison of the Holy Spirit would come
[2:49:18] in the last days and will be with us to
[2:49:21] the end of the world we find there we go
[2:49:24] we couldn't find him in fine lectures
[2:49:26] course we find people who could stand up
[2:49:28] and I can explain the world in such a
[2:49:29] way it's just breathtaking I like that
[2:49:31] you say it is breathtaking Brett taken
[2:49:35] and is some explanation they
[2:49:37] punishing a man even try to explain the
[2:49:39] only with Jesus bypasses the opening
[2:49:41] ungrounded years did not bypasses the
[2:49:43] opening but it was breathtaking how they
[2:49:46] could explain things that should not be
[2:49:48] explained all right we find the
[2:49:51] entertainer you see we find it is still
[2:49:54] a lecture we finally entertainer who can
[2:49:56] go through all the actions and so forth
[2:49:58] but I still isn't it we isn't looking
[2:50:01] for that we find religious site with
[2:50:02] their robes and so forth we are looking
[2:50:04] for the person of Jesus Christ is that
[2:50:07] what you're looking for there we go
[2:50:09] almost done
[2:50:10] God's behavior is his person what he is
[2:50:15] in his behavior declares his person and
[2:50:19] that's the way you are in your behavior
[2:50:21] tells what you are
[2:50:23] oh my hallelujah praise be to Jesus now
[2:50:28] the Holy Spirit will not misbehave
[2:50:30] itself in one person and behave itself
[2:50:33] in another it will make here we go
[2:50:36] each person come into its character
[2:50:39] because it's a spirit that leads you it
[2:50:42] will make you subject its nature the
[2:50:45] Holy Spirit makes you love to do it and
