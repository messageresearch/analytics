the presence of the Lord but the Peter Chandler can we you can you just say now we want to salute you for last night's message what a masterpiece wow what a blessing what are opening brother Peter time-tested faith mine that's the question we have to answer shall the Son of Man find faith when you return the new earth so many of the court said not find the church not find Christians well the Holy Ghost come will it be resurrected no will he find faith and you can find out it's not a 3d faith there's only one thing and the ministers will reveal it to you praise God so and you know there's only one group that can answer that there's only one group on the face of the earth that can answer that question you know that group it's the pride of the Lord Jesus Christ that can answer that question yes there will be faith on the earth hallelujah so may God bless you as it's my honor and privilege to bring to the poopit a special friend of precious brother Jesse the plane oh he's been a friend for many many many years brother ben says there's something about all three you meet new ones and you make new friends but there's something about all friends and I like what proverbs said a friend is forever so it's my honor and privilege to bring up our precious brother Jesse in the play-doh he's been a blessing to the Bride of Christ across the world man has been to so many countries preaching this message stand it for the special of the hour and is is been invited to these meetings and I believe not one person is here by accident I believe God even knew what seat you'll be sitting on and I believe he knew what message would be preached this morning so we're not gonna sit back and let brother Jesse preachers of fire we came with a home fire this morning we came with her own annointed we came with the hope race so let us stand to our features are welcome to precious and brother for the Jesse the play-doh as it comes to minister what God has put on his heart amen and he wanted us to sing that city our men are made so you're gonna aim in that hood Amen we say amen amen amen hallelujah is welcome of precious pastor Jesse ever played oh god bless you [Music] I'm bid [Music] Ct Ct a baby I've been a bit see I'm in a minimun I've been Ct we say we say [Music] we say we said Hey we say what say me [Music] I bet CT I bet I've been a big CT one more time CT CT I've been a bit CT I've been Ct see Ct I'm a dummy [Music] raises wonderful lame men we give Him praise then we give Him glory amen the Bible says enter into his presence with praise and thanksgiving praises wonderful name I appreciate being here this morning you may be seated just a moment while I greet you I tell you what this is perhaps Amen praise this wonderful name but we are here you know without a fight without complications without difficulties there is no way that we could expect the victory so when the devil fights fights in the way that he has fought this meeting and I'm sure that everybody has their own testimony of how well you see the devil don't want you to receive what you're going to receive this weekend did you hear what I said what you're going to receive not what you may receive are hoping to receive but what you're going to receive this weekend hallelujah amen and I believe this is a special meeting and a special time amen for the bride of Jesus Christ and especially during what I believe is a very important theme of this message of this convention amen what a question when a son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and I like what brother Thompson said that you know there's gonna be a people and only a people can answer that and I'm so thankful that there are quotes and things like brother Graham style I'll just read it sometime if I get a chance but when God makes a promise the promise goes out and he's obligated to his word he's not obligated to what I say or what other people say and what we make there are many made-up promises you know but he's not obligated to that he's obligated to his word and since he is obligated to his word then he himself Amen made sure aimin that he becomes the answering of his own word hallelujah so how can we fail Amen so we by faith Amen the elected of God this portion of the bride of Jesus Christ can save not only just by saying it but by divine revelation Amen yes Lord you will find faith on the earth praise God amen and I'm here to tell you is not just saying it Amen is manifesting it Amen hallelujah so we is manifesting time you know Amen because the harvest time is here but I I don't want to I do have should I say schedule to follow and I don't want to keep you too long but anyway I just want to say I am so delighted to be back in South Africa and the first time I walked the streets of South Africa and this great beautiful country was 28 years ago I was a young man of twenty years old and so you know it seems always that when I returned to South Africa although I am getting a little older I just feel a little younger here for some reason I just it's the anointing that makes you feel amen all that singing last night and the singing this morning a man I feel like Aaron's all rod that just was put in the Shekinah glory amen it couldn't help but Amen blossom and yield almonds amen whenever you are in the presence of God you can never be the same again go away be to God listen you cannot enter the presence of God and remain the same amen you're going to either change for the better or you're gonna change for the worse but something is gonna change amen glory be to God Amen hallelujah glory be to God so I just want to take this opportunity before I just get too excited and I love preaching in South Africa because there are believers here that knows Amen the word there was a brother one time who he we had a conversation and he he he said he had visited South Africa and I of course I won't mention any names or anything like that but you know he well he try to preach something that is well not quite aligned with the word you know and I told a brother I said brother when you go to South Africa you better know what you're talking about because South Africa knows the word knows the message Amen so I'm so thankful for that you know why because we all not only South Africa thought the problem that I have seen in this message and too many people do not know the message and this is why they're so easily tossed about to and fro faith can only rest on the world and nothing else and I love to see a believer that's resting on the world hallelujah to the lamb hey man so if you're not you you cannot rest on interpretation you cannot rest on man's idea your faith becomes restless you come in and out up and down but if you ever amen put your faith on the Word of God that word will never return to Him void but shall accomplish the purpose he sent it for no repeats of God what a mighty God we serve today hey I'm here to brag about Jesus you know praise God amen glory you may be seen at a moment in amens OCC I'm just kissy this is what happens in South Africa amen your whole message is it goes out in your comments you know in just your introduction it's just to pull hey man Amen so I'm enjoying this because I have been to places obviously that you preach you try to get people to understand their promises for their day and you know they give you a nod yeah that's a good good point I'm not talking about a good point you know I'm talking about a revelation hallelujah no repeat oh god I'm talking about the same revelation that John had Amen nobody explained it to John he realized Amen that if it wasn't for the Lamb of God that stepped forward and took the book oh he realized he was lost but when the lamb came forth and took the book he saw his name in the Lamb's Book of Life and nobody had to tell John he be quiet be quiet no no no because now he was in the vision he saw himself redeemed he saw him he said I know my Redeemer liveth no repeats our God and no man can preach that to you no man can open that up to you because that comes by divine revelation and upon this rock brother Peter praise God upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall never prevail against the team head Oh hallelujah praise His name Oh praise this wonderful name God richly bless you I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen on behalf of my family and our little Church in Valley Stream I call it a little church and it is a little Church hey man and I'm not ashamed of that you know because you see that scriptural Jesus if you're not little flock what's your gut father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen and I'm not envious of those that have you know thousands whatever but you see God likes to deal with the little things you know so God richly bless you I am once again so privileged and honored to be here and I was so blessed to see yesterday some of my old okay let me correct that longtime friends hey man friends that haven't seen in a long time and it's so good to see a man friends that last year I was asking trying to figure out a man who was president in 1980 and the last time of there was at many hands I think there's a few more hands this convention amen those were so wonderful times in the Lord and we've come a long way and I think we have matured Aemon don't ever believe that you are going through whatever it is that you're going through it's in vain God has a plan God has a purpose and I want you to realize that your trial is custom-design you have a custom design trial because Amen what you are strong at in certain areas somebody else may not be as frog so he has to customize the trial if you have even more trials up God knows that you can carry it so don't worry about the trials don't worry about the burdens don't worry about all all all the devils have turned against me my family my church whatever well praise the Lord Amen because I'm gonna show I'm gonna tell you something here's the revelation when you feel that way what you feel in prison you can't here's the mystery there's power and praise you know because when Paul and Silas was put into jail coal they were put into jail amen they were incarcerated they were in Chains but that is the moment that they decided to have Church [Applause] poor look oh it's a Silas a second you know what sing a little bit I will praise the Lord brother they begin to sing and it begin to shake the prison and shake it and shake it and shake it in so much that the chains that was binding them set off the chains that were on their feet amen fell off the prison door bars networks closed swung open so if you're bound here's the secret you don't praise God because you're free you presume to get a man so now so many have gone before us and we miss those that are good friends and believers and great mighty men of God that have given their testimonies over the years and we learn by them what I like to do always is to take the good and take amen what is going to benefit me amen and move on and because here is what I want to say right now they are on the other side so now there's a great responsibility that has been placed upon those that alive or and remain because they now without us did you hear what I said now they without us cannot be made perfect so we have to come to perfection by the Word of God not by interpretation not by men's ideas but by the original C Word of God amen then we'll be able to call the others hallelujah that are in the grave hallelujah so shall we ever be with the Lord and like brother thompson said yesterday we have to climb up a little higher a man into a sphere amen that's gonna shake the whole world they mention shake and shake and shake brother not only the world but it's gonna shake the graves open this coming a resurrection then we have an appointment laura visa god amen so we which are alive and remain shall not a man shall be caught up together see with those that are asleep amen so therefore we have a responsibility I want to take this moment before I just get into this sermon real quick I want to thank brother Thompson foot and his wife and family they've been so welcoming to me and all of us and I and the tabernacle that so has worked so hard to make this a possibility never forget to pray for the local church because believe me while we're sound asleep many of them are still probably up hours of the night and trying to make us comfortable for the services and the convention so we certainly won't appreciate brother raymond thompson as his wife and my message believers church and of course all those that cooperated and I have enjoyed with the specials that have come forth I like my brother Peter says certain songs you hear certain specials you hear and others you you feel and I have felt everyone hey man oh I have felt everyone no repeats of God it's just just just heavily vibes coming into your heart they meant so God richly bless you and I want to take this opportunity well I bring greetings as I said for my wife and the original faith Gospel Tabernacle in Valley Stream on New York where we are a little group that is waiting amen for the coming of the Lord and we know that we have to stay very close and as close as possible with what the Prophet said brother Brown says say what I said and the problem has been over the years is that so many people have felt the authority I guess to to say what he said but then add a little here there and take a little here there and see but the seed has got to remain original can't be tampered with Amen because God doesn't need help his seed is perfect it doesn't need any help glory be to God amen and that seed is the word of God how on earth can we help God fulfill his word because it's not you fulfilling the word it's the seed in you that's coming to perfection glory be to God we cannot make it on our own no repeats our God but there's something inside of you amen striving to be perfected Amos striving to be adopted striving aim to be positionally plays hey man Oh hallelujah I'm feeling happy now hey man would you mind if I take off my coat hey man god bless you originally a man and what can I say Brock brother my good friend brother Peter Chandler amen yesterday's message time-tested faith amen did you appreciate the message from brother Peter I was tremendously blessed you know because there are people who claim they have faith and you realize that after a while after several years you realize that they have their faith begins to drain and and fade away and what is so sad that as brother at Thompson have said that I have had the privilege of traveling quite a bit and there's a brother who made a statement and said I have wasted 40 years of my life preaching this message and what a sad statement to hear from a minister who has been in a message for 40 years and say I have wasted my time amen so therefore there's a great falling away but when the son of man come in shall he find faith because he that endureth til the end he's the one that's going to be saying you see a falling off here fall in there you see all kinds of things on the internet and let me tell you something half of those people most of those people have never even met brother Brent oh but I am so blessed even here a brother like TL Osborn hey Amen who walk with brother Branham who saw the miracles now you know what is so much he said I seen God in that man I seen God walking in that man I think God working in that man hallelujah so I don't want this new a that's a snoo generation amen I don't give your manitto millennial or whatever it is brother I know this message is truth it is thus saith the Lord and all that we have need of is in this message hallelujah rapturing faith is in this message the resurrection is in this message adoption is in this message hallelujah glory be to God the final and the great kill is in this message hey man god bless you amen so anyway brother Peter Chandler thank you very much for that masterpiece last night a man I certainly did appreciate it was very blessed brother Peter Chandler has a way of just bringing things in a very simple way but powerful way you see because I I was telling him I said you know he comes from a different angle sometimes but boom he hits the mark right there and then you have another minister come the next service and comes to just slightly with a different angle and boom Lee is hits the bullseye and Akili I don't care how many angles you amen as long as we hit the bullseye amen glory be to God amen and I'm so thankful for this opportunity so god bless you richly right now I wish if you could stand to your feet Amen I feel a great anointing here this morning and I know that God is going to bless us amen you get only what you come expecting uh so I want to turn with too familiar scriptures that we know of course Malachi 4 Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 and I just want to pick up of course the theme of this instace convention because I believe that this is not just a question that we could just read look at and say okay that's a nice question this is a seasonal question this is a question for our age because if God is looking for faith he's got to provide a way to provide that which he's looking for and we're gonna find out by the grace of God even though people may or may not you know they may not see exactly but it's okay we're brothers and I always say the time has come amen brother Lee kindness never forget as we climb up the pyramid amen and as we approach amen that the great headstone has something has has got to have something to rest upon you see and never forget there's not many people that preach on the virtue of our age they talk about oh yeah all the power all the disa net but the virtue of our age let's not forget it amen because with if we ignore it we'll never go to the next step amen God Halloween because faith you know is based on forgiveness so let us turn to Malachi 4 and we'll read just two verses there Malachi 4 will read two verses there and verse four Malachi 4 and verse rather verse 5 series on this wise behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet now before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord now listen he had a purpose he had a commission and he shall turn the heart of the father to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse and we realize and I have often tried to explain to denominational people that Malachi 4 Malachi 3 amen are two different messengers Amen so we at the end of the age remember we have have a promise to receive a messenger with the requirements of what would be needed that when he comes he will find exactly what he's needed in other words if I could rephrase it like this God has done his part and if we miss it is nobody else's fault but ours hey if we miss it it's know we we chose and have chosen to miss it we can't blame God for at all but I thought no no no no no Amen he did his part so let us turn to st. Luke 7 rather 18:8 look 818 st. Luke rather 18 and verse 7 so about the unjust judge but I do want to drop in there when the Son of man cometh but verse 7 and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the Son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth what a great question last trip to reading found in Jew and we'll have you have your seats found in Jude because what we realized my friend is that we realize that this faith that we are talking about is one faith there's only one faith one Lord one baptism Amen we I remember I preached a message is Christ divided way back way back in Chile Christ is never divided you know Christ is never divided we do by Christ it's the lack of revelation amen and that brings division we're the ones that device but let's read Jude 1:3 beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the Commons salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints our Heavenly Father we have read your word Lord we realize that just about anyone can read the Bible lor those who you know have the ability of God to read the Bible but only you your spirit can follow that word so I asked your God that you would anoint this service in a special way and lord I pray for the next few minutes that it would be an encouragement to your people father Lord take me out of the way and I pray that your spirit would have Liberty father and may we realize the importance of this subject that brother God has given an inspiration to brother Raymond Thompson Lord I believe is timely it is in season father god we've got to recognize that God has done his part and we must do our part amen and if we do our part he will find faith on the earth amen hallelujah we ask it in Jesus name Amen and amen god bless you you may be seated amen are you feeling good praise God hallelujah I am feeling very well I feel the anointing of the Holy Spirit in this place a man and I had a message that I was about to bring to South Africa something that I had been meditating on and but the Lord gave me a message on the way here so I I put it together pretty quickly and excuse me I had to put some notes on on this notebook and a little bit on that notebook preachers know I guess what I'm talking about today man but I trust that God I just put it all together to make us understand amen so I was speaking on Tuesday to brother Raymond Thompson over dinner and we'd be good to speak on the inspiration of this meeting and what a question Amen the question is as when the son of man cometh shall he find faith to me that is a deep question amen some people we realize and we walk out of this place we're gonna find out you know denominations have faith they have faith to do things they have faith for healing they have all but that's not what I am talking about this morning this is not what we're talking about this morning we have our faith has got to reach a higher level brother Branham said we hardly have faith for divine healing amen but we have to have faith a man not only for divine healing but for the changing of the body no repeats of God amen just before the resurrection praise this wonderful name and I like when brother Branham talked about April 4th that promise son amen they were old and stricken in age we all know that but God promised it God promised the son amen and of course ishmael come around and you know the promise was slightly interrupted by reasoning let's do it this way or whatever that he no no but that's not what god said and he even testified when Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac he said oh because you not have not withheld thy son thine only son thine only Son because a seed will not be heir what the shine praise God hallelujah amen you have been elected before the foundation of the world and I'm gonna tell you something it's not because you were a better person than somebody else Amen it wasn't because your parent or or your daddy was a priest huh that has nothing to do with it Amen because of before the foundation of the world one thing I like about election is that God is sovereign he doesn't have to ask anybody a man he chose Abraham and say him blessing I will bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thee praise God and I'm gonna give you an unconditional covenant for him I know you you you're doing a good job but you can't hold your part of the deal so therefore I am gonna give you an unconditional covenant praise God I am gonna keep both parts Amen hallelujah no repeats our God brother if that don't make you happy I don't know what will amen nothing present nor things to come shall be able to separate you from the love of God so devil bring it on huh Amen bring up the big guns because nothing present nor things to come to separate me from the love of God that's when a person has a revelation that's a person that cannot be shaken by denomination cannot be shaken by false interpretation he's standing on a rock and that bridge will hold across the bridge they'll be no sorrow hallelujah hallelujah but listen if there is a question here is what I want to say if there is a question then there is an answer if there is a question when the son of man come in shall he find faith that is a question and if there's a question there it's got to be an answer and let me tell you something you may think that God doesn't know the answer but he has already answered the question he just wants to get you the revelation that the question has already been answered so this scene this convention Amen is very thought-provoking and ministers and believers and church members or laity deacons I just should really go home and not only home but throughout this meeting and think about this question because it is very important amen when the Son of man cometh shall he find faith Amen so I trust that the convention when it's all said and done we would understand Amen that this is not just a question for just a short period of time this is a question for the age it sounds simple people have read it many times but the deeper you you read it and you go into it and you go into it and you say you know this is something I must have this is something that is not optional this is something that if I don't have it hallelujah amen I will not be able to go and there is no one to blame but yourself I like that amen you see when God made a promise and he's always throughout the ages brother Branham said in each age when God said a certain thing would happen he come here comes that man along behold I'll send you Elijah the Prophet now here's the preparation of the faith that we all need to have he's taking care of his word listen because the word cannot fail or fall to the ground because his reputation is on the line now hey man listen so in each age go when God said a certain thing would happen he come here come that man along and manifest that so somebody manifests what has already been spoken [Applause] the first is a manifestation of the spoken word but let us continue here well here come that people along and live that Oh hallelujah here come that people along and live that so you just can't say I agree with that it's not enough to agree with that it's only enough Ament to live that say Amen somebody praise God amen and only the elected seat of God can ever live that you know why let me tell you the reason why a man had it's God Himself living in the people Amen because is the answering of his word oh I'm just gonna walk around a pulpit here just a moment God promised the promise he asked the question but he's not waiting on you and I to really manifest these things because we cannot do it in ourselves you know why because it'll be gone in the people because it's the answering of his word Christ in you you you you you you you answering the question when the son of man cometh will he find faith on the earth yes he will he will find manifest his sons of God he will find adopted sons of God he will find mature sons of God you're not the belief brother Graham say it or not the believer you know have it in your flesh to believe this God has to put something in you before the foundation of a world to believe this no repeater come that's the difference others will try to figure out intellectually but the real believer is not a word okay explain this to me explain that to me listen God is not known by explanation he's known by revelation and once you get it brother there's not a demon that can take it from you hey man you're on your way to the resurrection hey man I'm feeling good for the home ah ha ha hallelujah so therefore listen you can be seated a moment just so I can get my breath I'm not as young as the Houston amen so the question is and was not will he find good people there are many people many good people out there not will he find churches plenty of churches and in fact I will say this with respect than everything else that years ago and remember our the first time I was here was 28 years ago and everywhere I travel amen I see that there are more and more churches they say in America is like McDonald's there's the money if McDonald's in every corner and we're so divine it in that sense you know that everybody has to you know be uh whatever and I'm not here to judge that at all I'm just here to make a point all right so so therefore we're more defiant sometimes when we could see and recognize the move of God in some man's life and church what don't you unite with them and just put your shoulder to the wheel amen there used to be one like when I first came here you hardly had any auditorium that can fill the these conventions it's a because it was an innocence of of people that just love to be together but something has happened over the years Amen that has divided amen and I'm gonna tell you who that person is that is the cause of division that's the devil that's the devil the devil loves division the devil loves when you speak mean to somebody the devil loves when you don't want to call a person that just offended you he loves that so let us make it clear right now who is the person behind that that is the devil amen but in this day and age we must be we cannot have these situations get us out of focus of what we're looking for because there are so many distractions today that if we're if we get involved in every distraction we will miss the real promised to the bride you know the Bible says in in rubley a rather hebrews chapter 11 speaks of this man call Enoch and Enoch Hanna testimony he nakata testimony that he pleased God he walked with God amen he had this testimony and you know what's the beautiful thing about this is that God Amon vindicated that testimony Enoch was not testifying of himself now it was God who saw that Enoch please God this testimony his life the way he lived was so pleasing to God amen that he said this is the time that I am gonna call him home amen so the question that I have today we all have a testimony but what does God think of that testimony we all have that testimony what is God saying about that testimony we gonna write realize and bring it back to love you know a lot of people there with that love is a week no well yeah love is weak but is powerful amen but listen Enoch had a testimony in Hebrews chapter 11 and God vouch and recognized his testimony he pleased God and one day he was found not and just to show you that this is an individual affair it wasn't just Enoch and a whole bunch of people it was just anak who was so who lived in such a way that he pleased God and I want you to realize the day it is your end of usual walk with God that is giving testimony to God and is that testimony worthy of translation so when God Himself declares hears people say you won't bless God I am the greatest whatever you're testifying about yourself that's not what God's testified about you praise God hallelujah you watch people that is so bragging about their old ministries and who they are how big they are oh my I don't want to hear from you what you're saying that you are I want to hear from God what God what your manifesting glory be to God because we have driven away we have gone away from the life the true meaning of this message it is a life behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind the name hey that makes the proud hard humble glory be to God because in you if you are true seat of God if you are a true wheat man what is keeping you alive it is the life that is in you and whatever you whatever life is in you you cannot help but bear fruits others can't do it it's a different life amen let's let's let's move on but our faith has got to be ripen see a many to another level on our faith has to be matured a man has got to come to a place a man of maturity we've got to our faith it's all these years has been progressing progressing maturing you know brother Graham said in 1965 intellectually we have listening we've been listening to the message but it had to lay in the presence of the Sun for a while too much or he realized that he see he sold the seed of the entire Bible for this body one now people may disagree with me I heard I've got some emails and so forth well I don't believe it's one man message and so forth yeah well you know what here's the thing I always believe and I'm very very positive about this brother I say what he said it's not my words he meant I say what he said the fire falls I walk out and is still anointed today people don't even want to hear tapes anymore they no longer want to do this or that they're trying to criticize this message over the internet but I'm gonna tell you something that this angel is still standing on the earth payment bringing up people back to perfection by the Word of God Oh hallelujah he still uses sake he still delivers hey man I've seen it Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he cannot change hallelujah but let's look at Anna he had a testimony praise God that he pleased God so what kind of testimony is my question what kind of testimony and this last days will we have that that Christ can recognize and say oh that's our testimony that is pleasing Jesus I said and you know the Bible says it is impossible to please God without faith so we must have a God hey man now here is what I'm going to get into the the sermon now just have a human I'm just going to try to abide by it sure about now listen look at in Matthew chapter 8 the Roman centurion listen to this is so beautiful this Roman centurion was not of religious background in fact he never claimed that he was religious or whatever but he had a problem and the problem was his servant was very sick very very sick now oh I love this because this is not a priest this is not a religious person this is this is a Gentile this is a Roman but you see he got her he had a revelation no doubt he was looking at Jesus from a distance and how the demons were being cast out by a word and and when you're in Lane and he's laying his hands on people they were walking the blind will see amen and he caught a revelation now now remember faith is a revelation because what he recognized he said you know what I am a man of authority and I have men under me that when I tell them to go they go when I tell them to come they come so he recognized that this man Jesus who was called Jesus had authority that he himself did not even have to go he sent his servants or whoever was to go for him and he told Jesus one day when he asked for the healing of a servant oh oh just hmm he said Jesus master hey I have a servant who is at home now remember he wasn't Christian because he said I'm not worthy you come under my house now you think that oh the religious people had to fail but this was a Roman since or again oh people are going to be very shocked that day they find out who makes it and who doesn't amen hallelujah people are all righteous and everything else or bless God I don't need God let me tell you something let me put let me bust your bubble we all have to come down we all need to faith this faith that I'm talking about and brother Branham said a righteous man is not a sinless man our righteous man is a man who recognized that when he sinned he gets right with God hallelujah people don't like to repent people don't like to make right with God they cannot be righteous but those that recognize when they have done role amen and go to God Norfolk give me that's a righteous man David was a man after God's own heart hey man he had his faith share a problem but he was a man after God's own heart sure he failed sure he made mistakes but he sought the Lord he sought the heart of God amen and that's the pride of Jesus Christ we're not ashamed to apologize to our brother we're not ashamed to say I'm sorry we're not ashamed to say you know I misunderstood you amen hallelujah that devil hates that but that's a righteous man [Applause] no way be to God hallelujah glory be to God so he said oh I'm not worthy come over the in my roof you know what but Speak the word only speak the word only but here's what I want to pour it out here right now speak that word only what a faith and so much that Jesus marveled he said you know I've been in Israel I've walked around in every village I've gone around every Amen case but I have not found this kind of faith in all of Israel why because somehow someway this Roman centurion his faith was on another level it was a spoken word faith it was out of season back then but is in season now speak the word only the sick will be healed by a word hallelujah the devil will shake a man louia and he's doing his best to divide us he's doing his best to boutique in the body but I'm gonna tell you Satan is too late too late there's gonna be a gathering of the bride of Jesus Christ amen she'll be flesh of his flesh bone of his gold life of his life the same power the same spirit the same anointing [Applause] [Music] [Applause] excuse me a minute ah I told brother John Conte last night brother if you don't have dancing shoes you better have dancing feet amen because I don't shoes or no shoes something on the inside if that doesn't make the believers if that doesn't make the elect of God amen charge with me hallelujah you're not the believer the see in you is the believer because it is the answering of his word I said will he find faith yes he'll find pretty because I see oh listen listen I know I can do this in South Africa I can't do this in many other places but while I'm here excuse me a moment I just got to shop a little bit glory be to God I feel free I feel free I feel free no repeats are gone hey man let the Redeem say so listen if you don't know redeem keep your mouth Wyatt hey man but let the redeemed say so [Applause] brother relator that sounds like a fairy tale no it's not Amen this is thus saith the Lord so it just shows Amen it's not to the religious is not to the good hey man it's just somebody that has a revelation of who God is now can I know you may be seated cuz I want to read it one quote because listen I've learned long ago I don't push any doctrine I don't but at the same time I'm not ashamed of if his brother branham said it I'm not a sheikh he's okay to read quote it's okay that's okay hey man I like that hey a man says yes some people stop reading clothes well you know because all kinds of it I'm not gonna get into a men but a men it's a men Laodicean Church age you know this now this messenger of Malachi [Music] [Music] God promised before the Great and dreadful day of the Lord Neal said Elijah Hilton Malachi 4 but now here is a message this messenger of Malachi 4 and revelations 10 7 is going to do two things [Applause] [Music] not he may do two things because the Seventh Seal syndicated the Prophet so all seven seals must be broken in order for him to be vindicated and we today we preach vindicated prophet number one listen this is a quote said all gone Dolan don't attack me court you better hey man just go back to the quote and just read it yourself hey man I'm Jed I would just show just so blessed amen and have been for years according to Malachi for he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's and number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 [Applause] [Music] which are the revelations contained in the seven seals listen number two he will reveal the seven of the mysteries of son funders in revelations 10 which are the revelations the revelations now revelations can only be be finally revealed or else it still remains a mystery and it's still a mystery to many people it was divinely revealed to the Prophet and as much as he could say he said it but he knew that somebody will see that the finally revealed truth I'm talking about you and I now amen we've got to come to perfection this is no matter let me just say this no matter how much you are in the message you can never get around this [Applause] this is a message on teaching statue of a perfect man Amen that ties the man in listen if you're going to be tied in this is a message on teach sheep so call it what you want to call it say what you want to say but the way to holiness the way the perfect faith is this way [Applause] now listen the seven thunders of Revelation says which are the revelations contained in the seven seals in the seven seals there contains seven a man their revelations in the seventh seal amen but listen as I continue the COPE it will be these divinely revealed truths now Malachi 4 had a commission to restore the faith but without it being divinely revealed Malachi 4 could not be accomplished it would not be able to turn the hearts of the children back to the father so these these are connected and you can separate it revelations 10 7 Malachi 4 st. Luke's 1730 hallelujah because listen the Prophet come amen he wasn't be son of man he was a son of man revealing these son of man and in the days of the revealing of a son of man so shall it be Malachi 4 he said kitchen separated now amen I am NOT the son of man I am a son of man we are revealing these son of man and not only that it was vindicated he's had to show you that the same one that was with Abraham he said let me turn my back to the audience and he began to discern just like the angel who visited Abraham and discerned of thoughts of a heart of Sarah Sarah you left oh no I didn't oh yes you did brother Brandon with his back turned to the to the people you have this you back there Amen you had this cancer you had that problem that was the son of man being vindicated through a son of man [Applause] excuse me just give me a little prayer amen praise His name it'll be revealed truth literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal Prabhas exactly so hey hallelujah now amen as I wind down I don't have much time amen in every age I just want to say this in every age God has had a word a time a people to manifest what he promised for that day never throughout the church ages or any time has God sent down anyone without properly equipping him the messenger with a message and giving him a message hallelujah and not only that they were elected people a special elected people I want to I'm home I'm gonna tell you how special you are how special you are why do you think that those are millions probably thousands and thousands of people way back when when brother Branham was showing the signs and deserting the hearts are the people in China I did the five the revealing of the Son of Man they saw those things but there was nothing in them to catch it [Applause] some of them sets they sat on a platform half-asleep but me my god was being unfair hallelujah the son of man being unveiled scripture was being fulfilled so they did not catch it you know why the message was not for them the Prophet put it in c4 and said this seed has to lay in the presence of the Sun for a while to ripen because all along the Prophet was sowing seeds but he knew right then that generation wasn't gonna catch it oh but there's got to be a see that's been in the ground well the channel about 50 years or so now Oh somewhere somehow God has got a corrupt somewhere [Music] let's see that was in the ground as maturing is coming to perfection glory be to God hallelujah roll I'm talking about you I'm talking about this portion of the bride of Jesus Christ you wasn't ready back then of course not but you had to mature a Corinthians 13 I said when I was a child I spake as a child which means if you can just look at how the scripture is written when I was a child I understood as a child I couldn't understand my limited understanding I I thought as a child I did as a child but when I matured wonder green becomes more mature when it comes to maturity I changed my walk I changed my top those little things I don't play with those things no more I am a man now that's what God is looking for a man a statue of a perfect man amen this is what will tie that man in into that eternal church age at the end of the seals [Applause] now I'm not preaching doctrine I'm just saying what he said [Music] [Applause] just just just food for thought you know don't worry be took aha hey man so in every age I had a seed a time so if God promised amen Malakai for a man a Messenger according malachi for revelations 10 7 st. luke 1730 these scriptures were anointed were assigned to a specific person that was supposed to come on a scene see you've got to know your place in the scripture you because then you have scriptural vindication and brother Branham recognized that see now number one see a word see the message came forth it wasn't Moses message see because not only has a word has to be true but it has to be rightly divided so there are no more pharaohs in this message no more dictators or nothing if you divided that you divided it incorrect I'm talking about our work our time amen to the elect lady and what makes you let me just say the only thing that makes you different from all the rest I want to know what that is not you not your life now how you say Amen how much you shall go and the only difference because you know what if that was the case Pentecostal outdoors rather because they can make a lot of noise they can make a lot of shout and everything you know they're out to us but the only thing that makes you different from the rest because your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world but you could not know this Amen you could not know this but when the Prophet Malachi for Saint Luke 17 verdict Oh revelations 10 7 when he went way back and pull back the curtain there you saw your name brother and when I saw my main message I'm going up I'm going up I'm going up in the first resurrection hey man I don't care what the opposition is I don't care how many devils don't believe it amen it has nothing to do with me I have a revelation that my name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life I'm gonna I'm gonna say this while I'm closing listen and the devil listen he always speaks without proof and authority whatever he can only assume that's the devil's realm and the devil's job is to tell you not said this many times before it's to tell you you know what your name is not there [Music] it's not look what you did yesterday look what you did 12 months ago or whatever 3 years 10 years ago what you did he always puts that back in your face but there's something new in your heart a predestinated see that speaks back to the devil I said devil show me where I actually did that let's go back let's go back a little further let you know later on the journey back he's got the jump off the train you know why before Satan was created you were way back then before the foundation of the world so if he wasn't there how can you he tell you that your name is not in the book before the devil was I was what a revelation oh and one day Joe got that revelation Amen you know trials and tribulations are good for you sometimes you know because Joe was once on his back he lost all that he had he lost his possessions he lost everything but one day [Applause] a whirlwind come down Joe stand up I'm gonna talk to you like a man stop being a baby stop complaining stand up I'm gonna show you where you come from don't worry way you are now but I'm gonna show you where was down when I lay the foundation of the work Oh hallelujah where was now you were beyond this condition you are beyond defeat you are with the men of tested sons of God shouting and glorifying God and he stood up and said I know my Redeemer liveth how many can say today [Applause] [Music] Hey [Applause] to the lamb come on and fries I'm somebody come on and think I'm somebody [Applause] now to prove this to prove this if God is looking for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints ie men in God that's the kind of faith that's gonna go with we need rapturing trains now because as I said what we have sometimes is hardly enough faith for healing or whatever but this is what I love really see in 1954 God has to provide away he says and now and now we're moving right on into another great age see he was referring now to the bride age because remember he come at the end of the Laodicean Church age and Laodicea was already finished so he called people out of Laodicea and according to the scriptures I love how it is written there God took us out to put us in he doesn't just take us out and just leave us in the middle of the earth see but listen this is the last court I ran at a time I listen we're moving and now we're moving right into another great age coming for the rapture this is our age there's no other age after this amen I don't care how much you plan on your 401ks a man your bank account it doesn't matter brother I rather have I bet you know where I Bank I Bank on the in the first blood bank of redemption that's where I and you know every time I write a check it never returns boy who cares the stock markets go down or governments are closing whatever you know why because here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come see a great age coming for the rapture of the church and now this we're living in the last time of the restoration of the gifts see it stumbled many of the big fine churches it wasn't for them see and it said Nazarenes backwards amen it made phonetics out of a lot of Pentecostals and I'm gonna tell you something it happens all the time it's always say the message is pure and it's always right the message is not wrong amen I challenge you to take a close examination you realize if you are sincere and you sit and you study this message you realize that you are wrong I am price is not divided he remains woman one faith one Lord one God one baptism one truth hey so therefore see but just the same God is moving right along bringing in the rapturing faith of his church that's right so tonight here's brother Branham identifying the requirement amen when the son of man cometh will he find faith so therefore tonight I represent the faith the faith that was once delivered to the saints God has done his part I represent the faith not just Penant Pentecostal faith but denominational faith he said I represent the faith amen so therefore I'm just gonna there just 10 minutes that's it 10 minutes on Sunday I'm really done 10 10 minutes I just want to destruct one thing because I realize it's G time bright time if a seed is a seed a shuck as a shut-in a tears of terror now it's not my responsibility to categorize anybody in my I have to believe that everybody's a brother and I have to treat everyone as a brother and a sister you know why because that is the nature of the true seed but if we realize in Matthew the parabola I'll just paraphrase it the parable in Matthew how the sower went out and he sold good seed in Matthew chapter 13 and while he rested there was someone the enemy who came in with terrors see and in the beginning you couldn't tell until they begin to bud and realize wait a minute and the question was asked by his helpers there Wow the I thought we sold good seed I thought we saw I thought we sold he meant every seed from Genesis to revelations according to what brother Branham said I thought we did you see but meanwhile they realized that amen there were tears among the field now here I'm gonna close it this we don't have an option now the wheat must grow very closely intertwined and everything else whatever and even sometimes squeeze you to a point that good see that the the tears will make the C's growth very tough sometimes but here in closing a week is a week because no matter how that close they grew together we could never change because it was planted with the original seat let's see so you hear sometimes excuses well you know this brother with that brother this and that I did sit look listen it's not our responsibility to say who is who is weak and who is there but if you are weak you will never live a life of a tear I cannot change you so don't tell me because you're so close to this and you're being squeezed this way and that way that is because though all wheat is a weak a shuck is a shot and it tears a tear because now we've come down to see time bright time and by their fruits you shall know them in this last days jesus said leave him alone don't don't let it because you may destroy the weeds you may be more you may do more damage to the wheat but let them grow together but here remember no matter how close you get no matter how hard time the tears may give you never act like a tear because you are wheat because I will love you even though you don't love me I love you we have to have the love of God and it's not our responsibility to separate from them because God Himself said in the time of harvest I will separate them so the test is on you're gonna walk out of here I'm gonna taste I hope and pray that when we leave this place
