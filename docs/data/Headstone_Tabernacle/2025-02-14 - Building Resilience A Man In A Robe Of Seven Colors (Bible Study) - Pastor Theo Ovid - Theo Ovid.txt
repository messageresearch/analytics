your people tonight by your Holy Spirit br Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and we want to welcome each and every one of you here tonight to this Friday H Bible study and we want to go straight into it tonight so tonight if have your Bibles uh I will start with the scripture Philippians chapter 3 verse 12 to 14 Philippians chapter 3:2 to4 and this is Paul speaking not as though I had already attained either already perfect but I follow after if I may apprehend that for which also I'm apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press towards the mark for the prize of the th calling Christ Jesus and the amplif this verse 13 says forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead I press on towards the goal to win may God bless his word now tonight I have a title building resilience a man in a robe of seven colors that's the title tonight building resilience and I backdrop what I'm going to which is the the text I'm going to get into is about Joseph I backdrop this here to try to share with you from a scriptural standpoint that this comfort zone we want to live in and stay in it's not really healthy for us and Paul was saying I have not captured and made it my own yet but one thing I do so this goal this aspiration that Paul had in his heart he saw himself as straining pressing fighting pushing and that is what we want to encourage you tonight to press to push to fight our Wednesday night message when brother Ram had this experience of going beyond the curtain at time the voice was saying keep pressing on so let's go tonight in life nothing happen happens by chance or by accident for a Christian believer this is the word and this is Romans 8:28 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are be called according to his purpose so you can see by the scripture that Paul described it as straining for to what lies ahead it's an effort that we must make to keep pressing on this person doesn't come without effort you have to exert yourself exert means to use something such as Authority power influence in order to make something happen so there are people who could be bystanders uh Watchers they're just observing they're not participating but you don't want to be part of that you want to be part of the order to make something happen or cause a Revival or cause something to get started or get the wheels turning now dreams there we go are not given and plac in automatic mode it will not just work out think of a dream as a vision think of a dream as a architectural drawing of a house but the house still have to be built but even though you have the paper you have all the the schematics of the doors windows the building the roof everything else this vision of this house that you have on paper that has been approved still have to be built so now we will go into our text tonight for that connects with our title and this is found in Genesis chapter 37 we want to read from 1 to 11 have bibl Genesis CH 37 1-1 this is where we would stay tonight verse one Genesis 37 and Jacob dwelt in a land whereing his father was a stranger in the land of Canan these are the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his Brethren and the lad was with the sons of Bila and with the sons of Zila his father's wives and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and when his Brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his Brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him and Joseph Dreamed a Dream and he told it his Brethren and they hated him yet the more and he said unto them here I pray you this dream which I have dreamed for behold we were binding sheep in the field and lo my sheath arose and also stood upright and behold your sheath stood round about and made obes to my sheath and his Brethren said unto him shall thou indeed re over us or shall thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet more for his dreams and for his words and he dreamed yet another dream told it to his bed said behold I have dreamed a dream more and behold the Son and the moon and 11 stars made obedience to me and he told it to his father to his Brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream the th was dream shall I and thy mother and thy Breen indeed come to bow down ourselves today on the earth and his Brethren envied him but his father observ the same note Joseph did not give himself the dream note Joseph did not give himself the coat note Joseph didn't apply to be loved so when God loves you this is deep or favors you there's a cost and a price that goes with this favor of God and Joseph find himself at the tail end or the end of that stick of the price of a man that is loved by God loved of the father his Brethren hated him hated who a 17 year- old with a special anointing upon him and God symbolized that anointing by giving Joseph a coat or a robe of Many Colors we say today of seven colors this robe this robe is trouble once you're connected to this robe one this robe upon you is trouble you you get into trouble so you want to get down into the text tonight and see what the Lord will do okay here we go now remember dreams are not automatic so Joseph had this dream is it that he could sit down on a rocking chair is it that he could sit down on a hammock and just sing and say I have a dream my brothers bowing to me and make a special and so on no Matthew 11:12 says and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence the violent take it by force and in the Amplified it says the Heavenly kingdom is sought with most ENT Zeal and intense exertion and we have another scripture we know it familiar with it every man press into it this pressing into the kingdom of God how Joseph choose to survive and our title is here The Power of Choice it is easy to press when things are working out when but when life bow you a curve ball it challenges your faith it challenges your Anchor Point it challenges your trust in God but that is what the test is all about it's about decision your decision it's about Choice The Power of Choice now this is really important I wrot down these things here this is really important you can complain you can blame you can make excuses you could go into depression you could give up you can backslide all of the above are choices you have the ability to choose how you are going to respond to the situation that you find yourself in on Wednesday night we spoke about two nagging women Thea and potifa wife both of them nagging daily arising tormenting torturing with your mouth Samson caved him tell her his whole heart TOA and Samson lost his strength Joseph on the other hand he bolt like using bolt he bowled out of the house and he got into prison because he refused to give in to potifa Po's wife so every decision we make have an outcome your present situation are the results of decisions that you have made instead of accepting the outcome of all decisions many times people choose to blame and to make excuses Joseph had to take ownership of his situation to St to an expected end and I have here written instead of taking blame instead of blaming others why don't you take ownership Joseph did not allow the situation that he was in Define who he was and we can learn from that do not let your circumstances defined you whether you're in prison whether you're sick whether people see you off however your family see you doesn't matter don't ever let the circumstances or situation Define who you are what must we look to now God put you here for a purpose God had a reason an intention for you being here you have been called according to his purpose now this is what you have to believe I don't care what condition you're in tonight this year I'm giving here is the word you have been called according to his purpose your purpose is what should be driving you not your situation because when you look at the situation I'm frustrated I am f up I can't take it no more um is this doctor is this sickness is this issue is this family is this loved one and so and that John 10:10 says the thief cometh not but to steal to kill and to destroy I come that they might have life and this is a part that is the key for me and that they might have it more abundantly the Amplified is I came that they might have and enjoy life and have it in abundance to the full till it overflows so in other words God is interested in our success God is interested in our lives flowing in abundance and have a overflow so let's get back to Joseph now so obviously we can see that Joseph lived life with intention because he knew he was called to a higher purpose that higher purpose gave Joseph the the determination to live and survive that higher purpose is what fueled his actions he did not allow his present situation to affect the endgame of division so his action was purpose based not situation based and this is so very important because sometimes you know how the Bible talk about job's wife she spoke he say she SP like a foolish woman he knew she wasn't foolish but because of the situation she spoke because of his boils and the stress of him treating all these effects and so on like that these things on his body the woman almost caved in fully and you know she said the wrong thing and she say you speak like a foolish woman he know he didn't marry a foolish woman now as human beings we tend to stay in How I Could describe it in our default mode that mode of comfort that comfort zone and when we stay there we tend to believe that things will be easier for us because we're in a safe space we in a familiar space we in a secure space and we stay there and sometime I may describe it of people living in a bubble you can be in church but you actually not really connected to him just in your own little world your own little family your own little bubble and I could see Joseph J have his brothers he have his family has his father his mother the environment is right there support um from his brothers not so much a love but family is still dear now the thing about it is this the comfort zone that we cherish and we tend to enjoy and tend to remain as a divort strange enough that is the zone that keep us from growing that is the zone that keep us from learning that is the zone that keep us stunted I like to make the reference of a man building muscles if you are lifting weights that are light do not building muscles you just moving up your hand once you start to build muscles you have to increase the weight in other words the pressure the tension the weight that is what going to burn the fat and give you the muscles that you want to build well it's the same thing we have to break out of this comfort zone to really affect growth now I could get down into some scriptures that's in John 15 the Bible talk about fruit if you only bear fruit if you don't bear fruit he cut you off if you only start a bear he does what he pruned that tree in order to do what bear more fruit so it just goes to show the law of God is designed not for you to stay where you are or how you are but for you to be in a position to produce goods and produce to the max like how he said the seed some brought for 50 fold 80 fold 100 fold in other words not no dead seed but things that would bring forth life so he said if you bring forth fruit I'm going to prune you then you bring forth more fruit here is my father glorified that you bring forth much fruit so going right up the ladder you could see God is Progressive God God is in the fruit bearing business God is in the addition business God in the multiplication business God is not in the business of negative minus no fruit you know that sort of thing he's not in this Baron not into that are you with me tonight are you getting it tonight so I want you to see all of this because I want you to see how God forces the issue of Joseph completely out of his comfort zone and we want to look at the constraint that he had and we want to look at what we might complain about and how God could help us from Joseph's experience okay let's go so tonight I want to challenge you challenge all of us to come out of the boundaries of your comfort zone you don't talk to this one never reach out this one you don't call no one no effort you just believe in it going to work out God call you 30 years ago 40 years ago and you still L to that calling in the sense then that you're not seeing that God call want to purpose God call you to growth God call you to deal with the issues challenges of life and God setting up things to get you out of your comfort zone now Romans 8 says we know for we know that all things okay for good to them that love God to them who have be called ACC to his purpose and here we go for whom he did for know he also did predestinate what for to be conformed to the image of his son that he he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also Justified whom he justified then he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us now note whom he predestinate he call so your calling knows and bring evidence to you that you are predestinated and watch this now whom he call you also Justified as if he never did it and who he justified he already glorified that is in the father's presence right now but there's nothing here speaks about sanctification but we know that there's sanctification sanctification is the part that we work out sanctification is the part that we do we separate ourselves we overcome we press the battle repr produce faith and Temperance and control that's our choice Temperance control is a choice so purpose coming into your purpose what God rais you for what God call you for that purpose is what gives Focus that purpose so if you don't know your purpose you can make a lot of circles going around and around and around but purpose is what gets focused and that's where you get Paul saying I press towards the mark what is Paul saying there I am focused I have a Target I have a goal now when things are not feable so so when you have that that goal that purpose when things are not fav favorable you press when you have battles you still press whatever you're going through you're going to press your way and I have here what was Joseph's constraints and you could look at your own life we can look at our lives to see what constraint that Joseph had to bear with this 17y old boy number one the jealousy of his brothers that was enough to give Joseph a complaint his brothers jealous him jealous him of the quot jealous him of his words they're not just jealous him they hated him two overcoming betrayal the trauma of being sold by his brothers who wanted to kill him that could have left such emotional scars Joseph later told his brothers and I read it you intended to harm me but go intended it for good and that show that Joseph was able to manage the pain manage the challenge of being betrayed and come out without bitterness did you hear that that's a hard one these are older brothers treating you a young person so terribly that they show you as if you like a a cattle or a horse or something they sold you and you have to process that and get it right and this is where you take back power when you see yourself as the one making the choice and making decision if you see yourself as a victim H you see you see you see you see say pray for me if you see yourself as a victim you're not in charge you are not effectively empowered because we cannot tell life what situation to bring job didn't ask for that experience the man who was born blind and and and or whatever and and Jesus said they say who sin Jesus said none that the works may be manifest so life situations it come like and the winds were contrary then the boat all of a sudden the winds are contrary nobody prayed Lord let the winds be contrary no contrary winds come contrary times come maybe it might be in-laws might be family might be wife husband children sickness job whatever it is and what do we do when those winds come how do we manage when the winds blow what choices do we make in our words and our actions sometime I go for you say when somebody do something against you don't even mention it to anybody just pray for them you know what kind of discipline that is in a place like TR Tobago that people they can't wait to hit that phone and that can't wait to that WhatApp and Facebook they can't wait to do that a man to be a per man you in this is here not at all that itching itching say this and say that and say that it take a lot of Grace to apply the word and say you know what I'm going to pray for my brother I'm going to hold my peace I'm going to press it down so Joseph had was to deal with this thing called betrayal it was a betrayal it's your own family selling you out your own Brethren selling you out not selling you out to somebody in the own country you know to another country out again let's continue praise the Lord ah is number two believe number three isolation being alone no family or friends i' I've heard it so much time um my daughter are no friends my son are no friends no friend in church and no friend this is Joseph no family no friends alone and yet he kept the Fate what are man what a man no wonder why he's a perfect type of Christ I have number four as living with a redefined identity a new name zafat zapat panah he's no longer in the safe space called home he had to adopt a different name all together five the language the culture the people it's all new he had to just he had to flex he had to learn to grow he had to adapt you don't grow in your comfort zone you grow in the stressed room I have it here like building body muscles you have to keep adding weights through pain you gain say it out there in your own mouth come your true pain I'm going to gain pain brings gain pain is not Antichrist pain is not anti- God stress is not Antichrist anti- God God allows stress that we don't be soft and doy you ever hear that before the prophet talk about people be getting soft and dty soft and dty Christians is people rting away in right in church we just see it they getting sofy the could press them and like when press them so the space Remain the body just thing when it press Bing back out because that's resilience you going to get it resilience is when you could recover from being bent from being spent from being strained you could bounce back that is the quality of resilience oh blessed be the name of G some Praises right where you are in your home I trust that this would help you in some way so watch this all these constraints that Joseph had isolation new identity no longer that safe spill called home a new language a new culture a new people he had to grow he had to adapt he had to adjust all these countries how do I say it here how do I maintain my faith and integrity and that was reflecting in how Joseph handled po white he stood there and says how do you want me to sin against God I have the authority in this house I have power to do everything over everything except you because you are his wife I respect your lady but she didn't respect herself that's why she press on trying to get Joseph but you see in the big scheme of things god listen to this like a bum wanted Joseph in prison because that is the only place he could meet the Butler and the butler was the direct link to Pharaoh we give the Lord some Praises you you see how amazing this thing is so here it is oh my pause raising you to help me you have forgive me tonight I was so excited about tonight I couldn't wait to get here to start this thing just to think that this boy you know some people when you see they fall in a bad slump their face long um they working short they working all the hours they're shorting on they work not Joseph Joseph working as if he working for God that means he have what to say it he was internally motivated you see when you have external motivation It could only go so far and no but when you are internally motivated that wakes up in the morning that put a drive in your system because you have purpose you have a goal it gives you a drive you're never tardy you're never looking for you know something to work out and somebody to wash your foot or put on your shoes and and and and and and put on your clothes you're not looking for that you are up and get and going Joseph was like that and because he was diligent because you know in some one of the Bible stories they were asking for the children of the captives who were versed in the language and in certain training and so on they don't want dum dum heads I want you to think about that there a kingdom that they're running and if they have captive people they want the best of the lot and these sons of God were the best of the lot so Joseph wasn't a fool he was prepared to learn the language he was prepared here to get the knowledge to get the information because you see he was about to be promoted what is the use the vision say you are to promoted or somebody want promotion listen they want more money first thing they want more work they said give me more work and I'll get more money no they want more money first if they get them free they get free but the thing about it money is supposed to compensate for what you can do or your ability or your talent and if you want to be promoted and you refuse to study you refuse to add skills you refuse to add qualifications and whatnot do you really want to be promoted no you just want more money and then you'll get disappointed because you're not prepared but Joseph operated with such a level of Excellence that he find himself ready in Waiting ready in waiting let's let's continue I don't want to jump ahead of myself tonight all right so therefore Joseph in Integrity stand I wrote here in parties for house qualify them for the prison experience so listen if you don't have the Integrity no pris for you but you're cut off from God so Joseph with his Integrity willing to run away from that woman end up in prison and he was still okay do you see it now what what made him like that what caused him to stand like that listen to this you may think here we go he should get a reward for his stand or recognition or a trophy but he got a prison term instead if he was a weak man or a weak brother he would have given up with the usual lame excuse excuses are lame his testimonies could have been there we go no family I no friends that is why I'm smoking today your you parents I had this written accepting dumb excuses from your for from your children as to why they need to do this that or the other or they need to go here there Everywhere You sympathize with their with their excuse strategy this guy have to keep the faith listen grow the faith maintain the faith in trusting God to sustain him could we give the Lord some Praises thank God for Joseph life you have to grow it maintain it and trust God with sustain him in this feate don't allow your present constraints affect your actions and decisions so Joseph did not make an excuse well not in a foreign land therefore work so hard I can't give him my best I only give him so much no God wants you to succeed don't forget that I want repeat after me tonight God wants me to succeed say that say it again yourself right home where you are God wants me to succeed he does because success reflects him he wants and desires you to have good success remember what he told Joshua you shall have good success if you meditate on the word day and night those from it to the left or to the right therefore here we go life challenges was designed so that you can grow so you can learn grow and mature adversity here we go Saints believe this tonight did not come to break you but to make you adversity come to strengthen you to make you strong and this is where we're going to get into this word called resilience Trials come to help build resilience resilience is the ability to recover from difficulties or return to normal shape after being bent stretched oppressed that is the definition of resilience do you get that tonight uh say sorry sorry about that something just went are you hearing me and everybody hearing me still oh hear me okay good someone just went off I don't know what happened there I'm like who Devil's a liar tonight I just everything seem like I thought it was crashed anyhow resilience is the ability to recover from difficulties or return to normal shape after being bent stretched oppressed resilience the quality of being able to return quickly to a previous good condition after problems now some people some folks soon as trials hit the announcement is dung and out no longer coming to church lost fate these are evidence of lack of resilience find people complaining complaining complaining easy to push a long face or we a long face easy to tell others their woes and what they're going through resilience when adversity arises it is easy to become distracted by the pain or the difficulties and if you remain focused on the purpose of God that God rais your for you would find strength to keep pressing on I remember when I was going through a real hard trial my wife and that is where forget it it really comes through the type of wife that is around you she tell me keep focused never forget that and I felt I was just I was you know almost a feel like could a disappear but she said keep your focus and that just resonated with me and I caught it I saw something and I told myself I say the devil want to wipe me off I'll give him a run for his money whatever the enemy expect me to do I'll do the opposite if he expect me to sit down I will stand up if he expect me to be silent I will speak if he tell me to be quiet I'll make a lot of noise in other words I went opposite to what was expected of me and man did have a time and I recognized that you know the devil he couldn't do anything after that and you know it's true you know when the devil tell God give me a crack at job and he will curse you and go say go ahead you know when when finished so the devil had no more to say he never come and bring any talk on again he never even he beat I've heard Deep by the of the a but I see the when finished so the devil had nothing to say he had to shut his M and keep walking he had to know there a righteous man on the earth or give the Lord some pray oh this word is true man this word is real this is not no joke something so watch the importance of resilience this ability to bounce back after a setback this ability to adapt and emerge stronger Joseph mindset prevailed even in prison he did not allow himself to be overwhelmed he had to succeed and even though here we go he told the butler to remember him and the butler forgot it did not anger Joseph his patience his quiet his waiting on God for God's timing it paid off I just love this I just love this writing this his patience his quiet he waiting on God listen Joseph was troops in I'm man Wicked Bo and to dream you get from Wicked man what kind of is that Bo wickedness I can't stand next time I interpretting nothing what kind of is what what kind of virtue is that so you see Joseph lived a virtuous life he wasn't saying you scratch my back I go scratch yours he was scratching your his your back because it needs scratching he was serving he was given he said listen man you are going to be promoted when you get promotion remember me the man just forget J he walk prison he back in tux suit with his b tie and different things and caring his drinks and stuff and like that he in a different realm he Palace but go have a time in because brother Bron said Joseph was not ready yet he had more things to shave off so I'm showing you that the dream he had age 17 or whatever age he had those dream doesn't make things automatic it still have a process it still have phases and things to go through and if you as a Christian as a Believer now feel laid back waiting for the Lord to do and the Lord to do and like you a have nothing to do you on a wrong road you know that is not biblical you know Paul said I press towards the Mark if you are not pushing and pressing something is wronging you really in church you're not trying to be in the bride because the kingdom God is preached and every man I can hear you say press every man press into it so I want to wake you up Saints this lgic slack lazy message Believers that have now thinking because they did 15 20 how much 100 years in the message they automatically moving down so they are dead roong God have a requirement God have attitudes God have a way of unfolding how this is to be done and if this is the pattern and Joseph represent a perfect type of Christ God allow him not only to be hated but to be rejected and he could survive alone with a different name learning a different language a different people and he could still stand what about you and I God want us to stand God expect us to stand no excuses Joseph had no excuses he could have flirt around with particular wife and say God frustrated I fed up friends here believe who sister the church Joseph was n that Samson was UN foolishness this again was a choice this again was a choice from Sam he didn't recognize that woman was a dangerous woman because she was under the influence of Satan and you have to understand that our battle is not against flesh and blood our battle is against princip and Powers trying to destroy our testimony trying to take away the gain and I am telling you sometime God release pain to make us get the gain that he wants us to have strength that God all right how we going here now all right good to see clance praise the Lord all right so even though the butler was told to remember the butler forgot didn't anger Joseph his patience his quiet he's waiting on God pay off now people think strength is going it alone no strength is also the ability to recognize when you need help don't allow the enemy to isolate you into thinking you don't need guidance you don't need help listen friends nothing wrong in saying I need help can you help me there are many people Bluff their way they as sham they're embarrassed they don't want to say they need help they don't want to say they don't know so they say their own thing in between and they Bluff their way but friends that makes no sense Peter was walking on the water when Peter start to swi sink he didn't try to make back stroke and front stroke and play the biggest man in Tong he just say Lord help me we need to come to that spot because the devil have a way of isolating people and make you feel nobody know what you're going through and you're going through alone trying to be the bur alone instead of having shared interests a shared prayer requests people have a burden for you a concern for you and you get that support around you praise God praise God a young man give a testimony one time of of um a woman or they were having a Revival and you a set of old people come to this church about 12 so old people and there was one little small boy who was helping pump those days had some kind of piano organ that was had to pump the air in it and thing like that and he was talking about this boy was there and who would want to go Africa who would want to go and this boy raised his hand but that boy was David living Stone I think he has a huge testimony and when he went to Africa now um there were they evangelizing and something like that and one day some um African uh uh Warrior whatever say they go and kill all of them they go and kill all of them but it so happened nothing happen they see them come and kill them and what not eventually that same man came to the Lord and so when they asked him man but I thought that day you say come and kill all of us he said we came now this guy was some Scotland I think it was and he went to Africa they said we came here now but we you see 39 Giants standing around the whole compound that's how we turn Rock back they say when you check the church in Scotland they were praying around that same time and they had the date and everything else of when it happened and they had 39 people in the CH that was praying it was a powerful testimony 39 people in chur was praying and these African Warriors or whatever it is coming to kill these Christians they say they saw 39 Giants surround the building and that's how they end up backing up so I say that to say this that the power of prayer or even Collective prayer is more than you think so you could have an issue a challenge it's not there among the saints and you know if the Saints are praying people are praying it makes a huge difference the forces of the enemy know there prayers are going forth so don't be afraid and ashamed it's not a weakness to say help me it's not a weakness to say I need help it's not a weakness it doesn't make you a weak person asking for help do you get what I'm saying tonight Saints oh praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus all right let's continue all right I'm going to continue until I'm finished all right so the Revelation in Joseph heart the faith his belief his vision his trust in God was the Anchor Point of his resilience courage to rise after each fall and try again again pushing Beyond circumstances pushing Beyond present conditions eases 11:4 familiar scripture it says he that observe the wind shall not SW he that Reg the clouds shall not reap the Amplified says this he who observes the wind and waits for all conditions to be favorable will not so and he who regards the clouds will not reap so what that does that tell us conditions around you may not be favorable what do you do what of your attitude what words will you speak when conditions are not faved over the years by experience we am and I and by extension I saw sure lots of you some of you would know what God has brought you through over the years what mountains look insurmountable what issues look like if it cannot be solved it cannot be uh made out and whatnot and to see God's hand come in a magnificent way and bring a deliverance and bring a breakthrough and whatnot like even recently for me was quite an experience when I preach on this and kind that charity something happened in me and after I was trying to figure it out after I real realized was a complex that I had and somehow that complex sna the complex is when people lie people say things don't hold against them but I have a mind stuff inside my mind concerning them and their behavior and somehow I got freed from that I see it I got cut from that wasn't ought against people was just the complex in my mind wasn't B in my mind and I feel so free I could go and have this dinner and coffee with my enemy in the message and there a breakthrough by itself before I couldn't see myself doing that now I could invite now I could go home and knock on the door they would have to actually stay inside now it feels good it feels great actually I'm enjoying my Christianity I'm enjoying this experience I'm enjoying the fact that the prophet said it will take perfect love to enter there and I want to be a participator I want to be enjoying this thing I want to eat the fruit of this thing called perfect love oh my to enter into this rest he speaking about isn't that wonderful oh blessed be the name of the Lord let me see how we going here now all right so watch so you cannot wait till condition is right to so you cannot wait you have to do what you must do and then I have this word here called consistency marked by regularity or steady continuity free from variation or contradiction you know sometime you want a big move you want a blaze of something and and it doesn't come like that it come by small steps I sh my wife the goal of what the Bible says e that is faithful in little shall be faithful in much or has test you with little he test you with $10 and you're Vex you're upset you're fine you should get a $10,000 and oh you go get $10 half that one in drinks have that in this whatever it is and you see a faithful in 10 he give you 100 100 give you a th000 get 10,000 little you know you can manage much so this consistency this is something marked by regularity steady continuity free from variation or contradiction and the scripture I have with that is Abra um Abraham Romans 820 he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and in the Amplified it have no unbelief or distrust made him waver doubtingly question concerning the promise of God but he grew strong and was empowered by faith as he give praise and glory to God oh blessed be the name of the Lord so in this year with Joseph you could see Joseph was a disciplined guy he had was to discipline himself to be what he was discipline means harnessing your passion discipline means doing what is right and what is necessary as opposed to what you feeling happy to do that is discipline discipline connects with what your purpose is as opposed to what you want to have pleasure in so discipline is connected to your purpose when you see what your purpose is then you want to harness your energy to move it in the channel of what God is have for your life amen men praise the name of the Lord so I have a scripture here from 1 Corinthians 9:24 Paul speaks know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receive the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we are Incorruptible I therefore so run so he is comparing that to race a race anybody who want to be at the best at the top of the game they have to be temperate they have to be disciplined he say I so run I'm running like that not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beat the ear but I keep under my body this is physical now and bring it into his objection this is his choice this is his doing least that by any means when I appr feature others I myself be a cast away so Paul understood as human beings we have our desires we have our tastes we have our feelings our Ambitions things in our heart but when come to this goal when come to this purpose when it come to this Mission we have to take stock of our lives in order to get the energy the strength the grace to do what God wants us to do do you get that so that's why Jesus in the Gard of Gethsemane could battle with his own will not my will I will be done because he had a will on his own so he made a choice made a decision to subject his will to the will of the father so he could go to Calvary to pay the price so God took Jesus through that then we ourselves have to be in such a position where we he look to see what we will do what we will choose and that gives you power the power of choice so here we are tonight I don't know what going through your mind I don't know what your challenges are I don't know what you have to face or what you are facing but here is this tonight you have a Choice as to how you will deal with what you are dealing with right now in other words Joseph could have been toally bitter he could have a bitter let's say he Liv for 30 more years or what a bitter boy can't even enjoy oh God now watch something that hatred if Joseph had hate back is hate for hate they hate him and for selling him out he ha them back to he couldn't have enjoyed that life in in under under pharaoh dead he couldn't have enjoyed it because hate and bitterness and anger it conquers you but Abraham says bitterness will rub you of Christianity will it will grieve the spirit away from you he said don't ever let that kind of Spirit come around you something to avoid is something to duck and the only way you could really see it correctly is to see how God loves you and forgive you that you could forgive others and ask God to take away that bitterness and Powerful testimony Wednesday night a brother from Sweden sent a testimony oh his heart had that bitterness and God give him a deliverance from it that is a beautiful testimony that's a great great testimony because that's a heart that getting it right God wants your heart right God just want you to come to church and whatnot he wants you to reflect something remember we talk about reflection is perfection you have to reflect something and this scripture this Bible study tonight this text on this guy called Joseph I hope it helped you see that you could survive by yourself you could survive in isolation you could survive in another country another a tongue another a language you could survive those Daniel didn't want to partake the king's meet all these guys are testimonies because they believe their God they believe in the real God they believe in serving God with all their hearts and they give it their best and God honor them and God blessed them Joseph Legacy was so powerful that the Bible says and their raise of pharaoh who knew not Joseph in other words everybody knew of Joseph his testimony was so real because he saved the world because of what he did everybody know of Joseph what about you what are you doing for God's King what could God attribute to you as a kingdom Builder Kingdom supporter what are you but Brandon woke up and say I'm 50 years old I haven't done anything let's let's get started and he was preaching for all those here all right let's see if we hear the home stretch here now I just had 10 pages tonight so Paul was saying clearly I have to discipline myself all right I'll wrap up here I want to read something from Israel and the church but I'm talking about Joseph this will cap off the whole story here to the message then he was loved of his father watch if you watch that robe without scene which represented the holy spirit that covered his being talk about Joseph and today it's the holy spirit that covers the church the robe of Many Colors and there's seven colors in the rainbow now if you want to look in Revelation the first chapter there were seven golden candes we started off with Ephesus ending in laia lukewarm church now having a form of godliness but deny the power thereof people going to church coming and saying accept Christ put their name on the book deny the baptism of the Holy Ghost and power miracles signs and wonders making fun of it in Lan Church age which is spewed from God's mouth and the elect taken up something gets into my soul when I think of it friends the world and its condition then talk about aad Stone and so on we started off all right and yeah he was standing and he was to look at upon Jasper and s stone what was Jasper it was Ruben Stone what was sadus Benjamin the first and the last and there were seven golden cands a rainbow is a covenant here we go that God had made to Abraham to Isaac to Christ to the church by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the robe of seven colors that was upon Joseph that was Upon Jesus it's upon the church today protects the body was covered up by the robe and the church is not you it is the holy ghost that got you covered by the blood oh praise the name of the Lord almost done Isaiah SP to them God said that he was hiding his face from your prayers you have got your ritualistic form yet it's the truth you are doing what he told you but you're not doing it in sincerity you Squall out day and night and God said your sacrifice is atin to me I will not receive it anymore and when you pray under such condition I'll hide my face from you he said oh God if people would think of that it was start of Pentecost and God said though you be correctly in the word here we go but if you don't do it with love and sincerity God said he would hide his face and won't hear your prayers you say you are taking the Old Testament brother brandham all right let's take the New Testament 2 Timothy 3 the Holy Spirit warned us in the last days the church would get away from the sincerity and the faith they would have a form of godliness but would deny the power and went with the the right with the right thing having a form of godliness this is what he said here as a reer God hates a powerless religion any religion today that hasn't got Christ in it is powerless any religion that Christ is is is in is under his own blood is got power in it you say God hates a religion without power he said your Solen Feast is a stink he said he ha it it makes me S sick remember he told this Rich Lan church that because you're lukewarm in other words you make me sick I PE out of my mouth we have come to that age God send us an Isaiah to chop the thing to Pieces it is lay out before my people cry out spe not God hates powerless religion it's got to have power in it it's got to have sincerity and listen to this now sincerity brings power sincerity brings real worship not forms but genuine power worship to know your pass from Death unto life God wants to perform his word by his power and when the church unites his power how can he perform and vindicate his word here's what happened God wants to perform by the Holy Ghost and vindicate his word and the church wants to perform they have to deny the Holy Ghost they want to perform to make big organization what else to bring membership no matter what you have to baptize Sinners drunkers bookleggers there a prostitute and the same thing it is today the church they don't want nothing much to do with the life that why they love the quote with these divinely revealed mystery truths is what will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the FI of the man but that is not all what the prophet said he says the church will be rebuilt in the power of the spirit that will turn the heart of the back to the he said God will send the Holy Ghost in such a way that it will turn the heart of the train back to the fathers so these guys they sincerely believe that by preaching Mysteries and long talk in their de churches that that is what the people need now because they on display they could talk for 4 hours 5 hours 10 hours and mistre down the people with no life and here the prophet said what we see should put every soul into action it should make a church that would make a Revival that they will say the seven tunders are being manifested so I want to see these Mysteries manifested because the seven Thunders have to be manifested and if the seven Thunders is the Mysteries they're talking about we want to see not the explanation of it but the manifestation of it well my friends the manifestation truly will be the interpretation let's wrap up sincerity brings power if I say I love you and I don't is that sincere no it is not if I tell you I think I'm adopted I'm not adopted is that sincere of course not it's not sincere sincerity is what God want from the inner man from the heart if I'm say I love you I must mean that from my heart hypocrisy is when the mouth saying and the heart seeing something different we need to get the heart aligned with the mouth so the M could truly see what's in the heart and when it's align like that then if you shall say to this mountain be move and don't doubt you can have what in your heart so Joseph a perfect type of Christ Jacob Grace but Joseph is perfection Joseph and I know there's so much depth into it I can't even go half of it tonight but to think that when Joseph told Pharaoh the dream and Joseph not only told the dream as a problem in he brought the solution he said find a man that is wise enough in the Kingdom to manage this so the issue after the revolation came as to what is to be and what is to be done the issue becomes into a place of management and Pharaoh had the confidence to tell that man you are the man in the position to manage this year while all other bands are empty only Joseph B have green let us bow ahead Heavenly Father it was just a joy to share this story tonight about this Joseph this man who grow and build this level of resilience to stand this man who had a heart full of love and compassion for brothers who hated him he demonstrated it he showed it he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sold in Egypt I'll take care of your loved ones I'll take care of the family don't hurt yourself don't frustrate yourself God sent me ahead to preserve life in a nutshell Joseph understood his purpose he understood that all this drama and Trauma of being sold into Egypt had to do with preserving life and the bigger picture is what struck him God I pray tonight that everyone that is hearing what we are share tonight would begin to see a bigger picture Beyond themselves beyond their little bubble beyond their home beyond their family and to see your picture father the vision of God but the vision is for an appointed time you said write the vision and make it plain and I pray God that through these teachings Bible studies prayer meetings services that things will become so plain to us that we will understand just like Joseph we are loved we are called to put a Rob upon us that robe of Love That robe of seven colors that has to grow mature and ripen that we can be truly adopted into the family of God father we thank you for your love that you extend To Us by releasing this message of Malachi 4 to us we are grateful we are thankful we are appreciative father God I pray you forgive our past and bless our future father God I pray that you would anoint and bless every family father gathered here those that would hear the tape father I pray of visit them with your presence visit them with Revelation visit them with inspiration we not called to be like Jacob Lord we are called to be like Joseph May that Joseph anointed they anointed to stand against Jezebel they anointed to stand against potifa wife they anointed to stand against fornication adultery oh God all kind of unclean living the the anointed to stand against these things and to stand in righteousness in your kingdom may be a on each one I pray in Jesus name I ask it father bless the service this coming Sunday May your glory and presence be with us Lord may you come down in a special way and speak to your believing children granted God in Jesus name as we look to thee in Jesus name I ask it amen amen so I trust the Lord you will bless tonight you inspired tonight I told my wife they might be expecting Isaac but um they have to deal with me tonight so I'm grateful to be here I was very very excited to be here this was upon my heart to share with you about Joseph and I pray that you go and read over about Joseph think about his life think about his constraint and look at what you are been complaining about and recognize it's Petty in the big picture of things have a blessed night God bless you thanks again for being here praise the Lord
