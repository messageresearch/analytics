[25:33] well last week we spoke about the
[25:37] adoption of sons how that we were born
[25:41] first into the kingdom of God born by
[25:44] the baptism of the Holy Spirit we become
[25:47] a child of God but then we have to go on
[25:51] to be trained child trained and then
[25:56] adopted and placed into the body of
[25:59] Christ to really work for the Lord
[26:04] wanna go back on one or two records we
[26:06] read last week and some I couldn't I
[26:08] didn't have my glasses to see and I
[26:11] couldn't read please God from the
[26:18] adoption around says but now to please
[26:21] how are you you are first born into the
[26:25] kingdom by the Holy Ghost
[26:27] how many knows that all right the next
[26:30] you are predestinated unto the what
[26:33] adoption what is that you are
[26:36] predestinated unto the place in his Holy
[26:41] Spirit is here His Holy Spirit is here
[26:47] and he's trying to place his church
[26:49] to get his church in order place it in
[26:52] the promised land so they can enter so
[26:55] that all the enemies can be drove out no
[26:59] we know that when God made man he gave
[27:03] him dominion over the earth no that was
[27:09] God's plan that God Himself the Spirit
[27:12] of God would live in man it was the
[27:14] spirit aboard in Adam leading him and
[27:17] wherever I'm said Adam had dominion over
[27:19] nature he could change the course of the
[27:22] river by speaking it and era was to
[27:24] speak the Word of God and bring forth
[27:27] the other sons but we know that they
[27:29] fell and man came the way of the animals
[27:33] we were born like an animal just how
[27:35] animals born there
[27:37] but that wasn't the original plan
[27:38] however God wasn't it all he made he
[27:44] designed things in a way that that would
[27:47] happen didn't you wrong man
[27:50] but he allowed man to fall that he could
[27:54] be a savior sure his graced a man to his
[27:56] favorite a man so his healing a man to
[27:59] his powers a man reveal himself to man
[28:02] so what was in it all it's not that he'd
[28:05] ever pull one on God and God had to come
[28:07] fight him back
[28:07] amen it was foreknown and pre-planned
[28:11] that it would be this way no man had
[28:16] dominion over the earth now when when he
[28:19] lost that Dominion the enemy moved in
[28:22] no we know the enemy is a spirit and we
[28:26] know there was a rebellion in heaven and
[28:28] a certain amount of spirits I think
[28:30] one-third of all the spirits followed
[28:33] the enemy aboard at least well this guy
[28:35] who rose up with Lucifer and he was cast
[28:39] out from the high heavens and no easy
[28:43] princely power that he is still
[28:46] controlled certain things he controls
[28:48] the things that Adam should have been
[28:50] controlling so the devil infest nature
[28:54] infest the world usually have storms and
[28:58] all these things of nature acting
[29:02] contrary wild animals destroying even
[29:06] man probably the worst are the animals
[29:11] right now but that was not how it's
[29:20] supposed to be so God had planned that
[29:23] you going to bring back man from that
[29:25] condition even better BAM spoke about
[29:29] the poverty a man who is so depraved is
[29:32] a man with - a child out of a mother
[29:35] handle rubbish does the extent that man
[29:38] reached for from being a son of God to
[29:42] be a child a devil but God he proposed
[29:48] that he would bring back man
[29:50] Oh spirits fallen spirits demonic
[29:54] spirits followers of Lucifer they
[29:57] actually control the earth at this time
[30:01] then they control it but it's man was
[30:06] supposed to control it so God had to
[30:08] bring back man into the position so he
[30:12] has to take but all the powers that the
[30:14] devil has and give it back to his sons
[30:16] no we know that we're in no condition
[30:21] really to receive these powers as yet so
[30:26] we have to be trained we have to be
[30:29] brought up in the things of God we have
[30:32] to be educated in the things of God and
[30:34] not just educated by mental ly you know
[30:39] finding out these things did you would
[30:41] have knowing you could know the Bible
[30:43] from cover to cover and yet they not
[30:46] will be talking about that know what God
[30:47] is talking about either so there is a
[30:50] training has to be done the Spirit
[30:52] Himself has to do the training so God
[30:55] has to boot you in as a child you come
[30:58] out in front in God and then you have to
[31:01] be trained you have to be tutored by the
[31:04] spirit autism by the spirit so and then
[31:08] but when you look at it it has to come
[31:10] back to a place where we actually have
[31:14] to take all over all that Satan is doing
[31:17] know all the things he that is to it all
[31:20] you control he has over knit and
[31:22] everything man I think about that so
[31:25] that is more than coming to church you
[31:30] wanna Sandra said not because we come
[31:32] the church or we come regularly you
[31:36] understand I mean that is being a good
[31:38] Christian you know but we come the
[31:40] church then to be taught the word to
[31:44] receive the word and then to be tested
[31:46] on the word now everyone who is going
[31:50] back to that original position will be
[31:52] tested we gonna be tested and be testing
[31:56] it not gonna be in here I mean I've
[31:59] already stand here and say dog a fight
[32:01] with me because I thought
[32:03] if you come here take a fight with
[32:04] people of Israel of being zero but the
[32:07] fight is against the enemy no Satan
[32:10] knows the planner border and he knows it
[32:13] more than us and he's gonna fight he's
[32:17] not gonna give up his position he has a
[32:19] chiral atom he can atom inheritance in
[32:22] that sense illegally but he has it
[32:24] and we gotta take it back so we had a
[32:27] between spirit in spiritual things we
[32:30] are to be taught we are we oughtta have
[32:33] sickness come upon us and overcome the
[32:36] sickness we have to have trials come
[32:38] upon us and overcome the trials though
[32:41] sometimes you get sick and you forgot
[32:43] well boy thing going wrong it not so
[32:45] much acting going wrong you know is
[32:47] training is testings it's trials that
[32:51] will put upon you that you could learn
[32:54] the ways of God and to overcome it
[32:56] because there is something in you
[32:58] there's something in his son of God and
[33:01] that could overcome these things
[33:03] [Applause]
[33:05] jealousy don't fear those ferry one who
[33:08] could who could kill your body then but
[33:12] ferry one who could cast you into hell
[33:15] naughty one who going to catch you in
[33:17] the hell you know hell was created to
[33:24] cast the devil in but all who follow the
[33:28] devil will end up here too so in that's
[33:33] Newton who came you know to hell as you
[33:35] know you have a picture to the ages of
[33:37] devils like as if devil is a king I
[33:40] he'll say then let it kill my hero
[33:43] so I guess silence say that another King
[33:48] I had you know the present as ever the
[33:50] kingdom of Satan
[33:51] fighting the kingdom of God and say tell
[33:53] the king a hell and God is he King I
[33:55] haven't say that hell was created to
[33:58] destroy the devil to lock him up to bind
[34:01] him to destroy him that you will be no
[34:04] more
[34:06] and if you follow well you know mean who
[34:09] follow will end up there too well you
[34:13] got to say well Cora did never fight
[34:14] even the Bible said God casts out Devils
[34:18] with the little finger that Cora did
[34:22] ever fight him is you and it ever
[34:24] fightin is your inheritance you're
[34:27] trying to get back what straining you to
[34:30] beat the devil so you know last value a
[34:39] plane last week you know it was coming
[34:43] the main prayer that we have to learn to
[34:47] wait on the Lord and the Wheaton on the
[34:53] Lord
[34:56] we can't wait frustrated we are to wait
[35:00] with patience we have to wait in faith
[35:04] because all that God's all right city is
[35:08] what God promises and God can lay what
[35:12] promise you that when you cross the
[35:14] river you'll enter a place where there
[35:18] will be no pain no sickness no sorrow no
[35:22] death no end of life you know viselli a
[35:33] tequila see or know how many people
[35:36] really believe that boy it song like a
[35:38] lil times the storia note that no sorrow
[35:44] no pain but this is the promise of God
[35:49] if you could receive it if you could
[35:52] believe all of that so I was ending with
[35:56] you know we supposed to wait wait and
[35:58] pray wait on the Lord the Bible said in
[36:00] a tweet we will mount up with wings as I
[36:03] eagerly
[36:04] they will run they won't be very they'll
[36:06] walk and they won't fit so I'll say you
[36:09] know you know like like you know we hear
[36:13] about guys going on a hunt and
[36:18] your fellows will be less careful and
[36:21] climb up on their I did we did whole
[36:24] night for some animal to come by those
[36:29] who some time and the I did like where
[36:32] abarim even talk about him he was
[36:33] hunting some lion or something and you
[36:36] were tracking it and land was going and
[36:38] he was behind and your truck anything so
[36:40] these hunters fella they actually
[36:42] enjoyed the tracking and all you know
[36:44] they enjoyed each ear said oh so we're
[36:47] going after something I've got some time
[36:50] holding it back hauling it back from you
[36:52] pulling it back and it's a senior and
[36:55] you had you if you any wrong speed you
[36:57] get was treated but we not supposed to
[37:00] be waited on the Lord in frustration you
[37:04] supposed to be waited in faith you
[37:06] supposed to be waiting with joy and
[37:08] another thing that was coming to me to
[37:10] any permit in there is that we're not
[37:13] supposed to be looking back the chicory
[37:17] devil is a get us to look back what no
[37:20] neither all chick
[37:21] everybody here must he get trickled out
[37:25] already you make mistake you fall and he
[37:31] come in and showing your dad and he
[37:33] brilliant that in front of your face but
[37:37] once you confess your sins to board your
[37:40] forgive mind blood wash so you're
[37:43] looking forward so I get to see
[37:45] something I see you know is to be
[37:46] looking forward forward forward
[37:50] forgetting the thing that is in the past
[37:52] there because I like to carry devil he's
[37:54] come on whisper and tell your thing and
[37:56] show your thing is so is his job to do
[38:00] that we had a learn to beat him there
[38:10] was a there was a quote ever Balaam said
[38:13] we said we were born we born we born we
[38:17] say hallelujah praise the Lord glory say
[38:23] but we can whip the Philistines
[38:26] so we had to be trained we have to be
[38:30] following following following training
[38:32] taking the train and everyday is
[38:34] training you know when you leave here
[38:37] you leave here and you put on our next
[38:40] mindset but I do wrong things you know
[38:42] you got is leading all the way got
[38:45] training you everything that happened to
[38:47] you koala low it every single thing that
[38:49] happened to you got a low that if he
[38:52] didn't want you to go to that you would
[38:54] have stopped it
[38:55] because the Bible says for every
[38:57] temptation he has already provided a way
[39:00] of asking he meant everything there's a
[39:04] way out but if we keep our mind on Bob
[39:06] you'll see how they all did it up like
[39:08] Bobby let's say so now when you get in a
[39:10] situation you see what you want the
[39:13] whole boat get about it this one no he
[39:16] no volume came out anti-cheating some
[39:20] time you say you know you could lose the
[39:22] vagina
[39:23] you can lose the vision you go to work
[39:25] and you put on I would mine when you
[39:29] come to church sits back touch its main
[39:31] but no it's good all the way God is the
[39:35] one that is leading so do you think
[39:41] about it is that what was seen it is
[39:44] more than committed chills regularly and
[39:48] dressing regularly and being a large
[39:50] part of it be nice and being kind by
[39:55] bamse well a good citizen will do all of
[39:58] that too but we have to be born of the
[40:01] Spirit and then we have to take the
[40:04] training we have to grow up in God we
[40:07] have to mature in God sees note as we
[40:12] were hearing place in the body that we
[40:17] could drive out both Philistine because
[40:19] mode if Philistines occupy a lot of
[40:23] areas they control the earth and we
[40:26] ought to take it back
[40:27] really take it but this is as far as it
[40:30] goes and we had to go and take it back
[40:32] so it's more than you know being a good
[40:35] boy and a good girl and committed to to
[40:37] regularly ending but
[40:39] then you come into here you would you
[40:40] come into here you would because faith
[40:42] comes by hearing so you have to hear the
[40:46] wood and as we see anybody since Sunday
[40:49] you know something you might want us to
[40:50] my play a tape and set up come in but
[40:52] Julie is you gotta realize that plane at
[40:55] a home up in a tip-in city to the
[40:57] venting I knew that from years know when
[41:01] you play a tape in the church is that
[41:02] different in your game or date and if
[41:04] you see know who myself am plate and is
[41:07] it truth babbles in forsake not the
[41:11] assembling air is a purpose in the world
[41:13] oh we talk about you know is a purpose
[41:15] it's not a commandment you know his
[41:19] wisdom is something good advice God gave
[41:23] us training but he know we doing well
[41:30] who is God a male became the pray
[41:34] tonight we switch wrongly armed service
[41:36] from the Friday today Wednesday prayer
[41:38] so we have a lot of prayer warriors
[41:40] among us tonight
[41:42] glory to God so we want to send up some
[41:45] incense to board tonight and we want to
[41:49] look our eyes you want to look beyond
[41:51] what we were looking up we want to lift
[41:53] our ideas much more as you purposely
[41:55] much more land to be taking he's not so
[41:59] much

[42:04] promise land the earth is the Lord's the
[42:07] fullness thereof but he gave it unto the
