[1:05:58] you invited to be a partaker of his
[1:06:01] divine nature that was nothing but the
[1:06:03] word but Isaac that was the absolute
[1:06:06] Word of God when I first come to this
[1:06:15] message I always believed that anybody
[1:06:16] could crack the pyramid that's gonna be
[1:06:19] it the secret was told to get inside
[1:06:20] idea it was always a secret because the
[1:06:23] pyramid is was bible there are three
[1:06:25] Bibles you know that right one under
[1:06:28] stars do react and the second was what
[1:06:32] the pyramid and the third was this
[1:06:34] violet we have but a pyramid as a
[1:06:37] mystery inside a deer
[1:06:38] isn't that right anyhow we want to get
[1:06:40] into the word
[1:06:41] I trust the Lord blesses us bless the
[1:06:44] wood today and a lickin forgot to
[1:06:46] confirm his word their hearts and in
[1:06:48] your lies you love him this morning it's

[1:06:54] hosts of y'all don't take it for granted
[1:06:56] take it as a privilege you will always
[1:07:00] have this privilege so the title I have
[1:07:04] this morning is the Living Word the Word
[1:07:07] made flesh the Living Word the Word made
[1:07:11] flesh I love the songs this morning lord
[1:07:14] I want to be a Christian in my heart
[1:07:16] more love more power
[1:07:18] isn't that right we have to get there it
[1:07:21] will take love to enter inside idea
[1:07:23] let's go this week President Putin made
[1:07:28] another major announcement to his
[1:07:31] Parliament or whatever it is and he
[1:07:33] claims that Russia now has an invincible
[1:07:36] nuclear weapon that can strike any part
[1:07:40] of the world that cannot be intercepted
[1:07:42] and he gave an animation on it on the
[1:07:45] screen of a video showing Russian
[1:07:48] warheads speeding towards Florida and
[1:07:50] missiles outmaneuvering
[1:07:52] obstacles in the southern Atlantic
[1:07:55] Russia has a new class of weapons
[1:07:59] President Putin said on Thursday that
[1:08:00] could make America defenses obsolete
[1:08:05] listen to what this prophet said in the
[1:08:07] uncertain song we live in a day of
[1:08:09] uncertainty we live in the day when
[1:08:12] there's everything almost that we can
[1:08:14] put our hands on natural is unseated
[1:08:16] there's so much uncertainty til the
[1:08:19] nations are quaking there is uncertainty
[1:08:21] in our national security there is no
[1:08:24] nation safe anymore we could either be
[1:08:27] the victims to Russia by midnight
[1:08:29] tonight or either be in bits it depends
[1:08:33] upon what Russia wants to do about it we
[1:08:36] are talking about our scientists they
[1:08:38] are men that they can put 200 miles in
[1:08:40] the air in a little machine that come
[1:08:42] right over and sitting right on top of
[1:08:43] this nation I send a message down and
[1:08:45] said either surrender
[1:08:47] we pull the lever that's all of it they
[1:08:49] don't have to wait till tomorrow to do
[1:08:51] it they can do it right now
[1:08:54] so put it this way the things are set I
[1:08:59] think they call this bomb that they have
[1:09:01] Seaton - I don't know if you know the
[1:09:03] first one that they had that can reach
[1:09:05] America and so on Collette's it and one
[1:09:06] so this is season two they have right
[1:09:08] now and it's it's fixed the prophecies
[1:09:12] are dear and that's why the Prophet said
[1:09:14] we are striving to enter into the
[1:09:17] kingdom of God before the plague strike
[1:09:20] a lot of foolishness would disappear
[1:09:23] as the pressure comes on as the Bible
[1:09:25] speaks of a time of trouble such as
[1:09:27] never was since there was a beginning of
[1:09:29] times but they're gonna be here
[1:09:31] isn't that right so we want to make sure
[1:09:34] that we put our best into the service of
[1:09:37] the Lord to receive what he has from us
[1:09:40] because when in one place that can
[1:09:42] strike and that's the word only one
[1:09:46] place that cannot strike and that's the
[1:09:50] Word of God there is no hidin place
[1:09:52] hallelujah can't say gone to this nation
[1:09:55] or this country there is no item please
[1:09:56] but yeah yes Christ is that vehicle to
[1:09:59] take you out of here
[1:10:00] amen so are you ready for the word this
[1:10:02] morning amen but a man a man Jubilee a
[1:10:06] say for this world as we see this
[1:10:07] morning has to be fulfilled
[1:10:09] it is God's thoughts made manifest by
[1:10:15] His Word and brought to a reality now in
[1:10:18] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:10:21] was with God and the Word was God the
[1:10:24] word was the beginning but before it was
[1:10:27] a word the word is a thought made
[1:10:30] manifest before you speak your thing is
[1:10:34] not right so God had to think it before
[1:10:37] he could make it a word and when he
[1:10:39] spoke it the word it materialized so you
[1:10:42] go from thought to word to material
[1:10:45] Isaiah 51 55 11 so my world that God
[1:10:49] father of my mouth it shall not return
[1:10:51] to me void but it shall accomplish that
[1:10:54] which I please it shall prosper in the
[1:10:57] things that I sent it
[1:10:59] so God would can't feel we know that
[1:11:02] once God said it it has to come to pass
[1:11:05] because it comes from his thinking his
[1:11:07] thoughts and if God spoke about your
[1:11:10] deliverance your breakthrough whatever
[1:11:12] it is that can feel he himself can't
[1:11:14] even cancel it or glory to God because
[1:11:18] it's mouse pocket it can't come back
[1:11:19] empty your deliverance cannot come back
[1:11:22] empty your healing can come back and
[1:11:24] your freedom your victory can come back
[1:11:28] because it come out the mouth of God
[1:11:30] not the mark of man mother man will fail
[1:11:32] but once the motive God speaks it or
[1:11:36] glory to God hallelujah not man's word
[1:11:39] he said my word shall return to me void
[1:11:41] Oh hallelujah
[1:11:43] so called after sin is word in this hour
[1:11:45] to call out the people his name's Jacob
[1:11:49] Ryan isn't that right so in the
[1:11:51] beginning was the word the Word was with
[1:11:53] God or because in the beginning was L o
[1:11:55] him under waters me that him isn't that
[1:11:57] right and it's the same thing just
[1:11:59] unfolding like the attribute is your
[1:12:01] thought and Gordon the beginni Turner
[1:12:04] he wasn't even God he was eternal he
[1:12:06] wasn't even God because he was eternal
[1:12:08] he was Elohim the self existent one
[1:12:11] isn't that right and then he was
[1:12:13] worshiped and then he became God after
[1:12:15] creates any Angels he wasn't even that
[1:12:18] he was LM eternal but in him was
[1:12:20] thoughts here we go that he wanted to
[1:12:22] become material he wanted to become sail
[1:12:27] out material Oh glory to God he had sons
[1:12:31] locked up in him he had parts locked up
[1:12:35] in him and he wanted to become material
[1:12:38] and the Bible said and the word became
[1:12:41] flesh and dwelt among us
[1:12:43] so the thought comes from thought the
[1:12:45] word then the word become flesh and when
[1:12:48] the word become flesh its material so
[1:12:51] Jesus wasn't just flesh he was the word
[1:12:54] made flesh that's what you want to be
[1:12:58] Oh glory to God you are gonna be the
[1:13:01] living world the word itself
[1:13:04] made flesh Oh glory to God until all
[1:13:10] this was a message riding me for a while
[1:13:12] and I will tie right into what but Isaac
[1:13:14] spoke last service in particles of this
[1:13:18] vinager
[1:13:19] so let's go he was even that he was
[1:13:21] Elohim be Turner but her name was
[1:13:23] thoughts he wanted to become material
[1:13:26] and what did he do he spoke a word and
[1:13:29] the word was materialized
[1:13:31] dönitz here we go that's the whole
[1:13:33] picture from Genesis to Revelation it's
[1:13:37] nothing wrong it is Elohim materializing
[1:13:41] so he can be touched so he can be felt
[1:13:45] so foodcourt was above us in the
[1:13:47] Fatherhood God was with us in the son
[1:13:50] Jesus Christ and God promised to come
[1:13:52] into you he always wanted a dwelling man
[1:13:55] he always wanted you to be his house to
[1:13:58] be a soccer and he's one of our people
[1:14:01] that he gonna live in Oh glory to God
[1:14:04] are you are you ready this morning oh
[1:14:07] this is how good men you this morning
[1:14:09] now this is a full seven-course menu
[1:14:12] this is that soup it's a little more
[1:14:16] than that this morning hallelujah praise
[1:14:18] God praise God
[1:14:20] are you ready and then then he said in
[1:14:23] the Millennium there will be LM sitting
[1:14:24] on the throne that's right with all his
[1:14:26] subjects i wronged him that he
[1:14:27] predestinated before the function of the
[1:14:29] world from things that up ought to be
[1:14:31] your bullet here was pre-planned shot on
[1:14:35] that one

[1:14:41] want you and your mother than want you

[1:14:57] some jump over so but court pre-plan
[1:15:00] your birth on this earth he won't
[1:15:03] mistake he will not here by chance you
[1:15:06] not even a little service by chance get
[1:15:08] the Lord a shout in the hope your birth
[1:15:18] was pre-planned missus it every one of
[1:15:20] you knows that our borders we plan did
[1:15:22] you know that your being here
[1:15:24] never originated as a myth or thought
[1:15:26] everything was or pre-planned by God
[1:15:29] before the foundation of the world that

[1:15:33] knows and to be infinite you know every
[1:15:36] free will be on the earth you know much
[1:15:38] time in the batter's eye that's infinite
[1:15:39] our phantom mind our our finite minds
[1:15:42] cannot fathom it and if we know the Word
[1:15:44] of God we know where we are living we
[1:15:46] know the are we live in and we know what
[1:15:48] lays ahead we see what we have past the
[1:15:51] book of God is the revelation of Jesus
[1:15:53] Christ his work through the ages that
[1:15:55] was up to the book of Revelation
[1:15:57] then his promises that is to come so all
[1:15:59] of his promises are true give the Lord a
[1:16:03] shelter not all of his promises are true
[1:16:07] and God cannot speak anywhere without a
[1:16:12] being confirmed every word that he says
[1:16:15] has to come to pass
[1:16:18] and the Bible said all that pollinate
[1:16:21] shall worship the Beast except those
[1:16:25] whose names written before the
[1:16:27] foundation of the world
[1:16:28] so you have to know this morning that

[1:21:46] to be in spirit spoken words because I
[1:21:48] know that's why I know if I stay with
[1:21:50] this world don't know bless me I want
[1:21:52] God blessed no man could curse victory

[1:22:26] excited about
[1:22:30] oh you know God by Jesus let's continue
[1:22:41] from spirit of truth I might not call
[1:22:44] her the names that books is too much
[1:22:45] that's like one tip I'll give it respect
[1:22:48] is the plate tip and we to be pleased
[1:22:49] players up tips like if like if God or
[1:22:52] Dena's to be T players not me I'm safer
[1:22:56] preacher you're positive about the
[1:22:58] priests who want to play by the bottom
[1:23:00] delicious that's fine we played - but
[1:23:02] that's not it :
[1:23:03] no this is what we have to do I would
[1:23:06] like to tell you how much books I have
[1:23:08] to cover to get what I'm prettier today
[1:23:09] right now I bought about how about six
[1:23:12] already
[1:23:12] alright let's continue one of the great
[1:23:16] problems for God don't chew the years as
[1:23:20] the history of the church goes is to
[1:23:24] find somebody that he can completely get
[1:23:27] in his control everybody wanna be
[1:23:35] somebody but not somebody for God
[1:23:37] because God somebody is mash up men
[1:23:41] broke men quad Mendes mistreat and what
[1:23:45] does break them you know you have to
[1:23:47] break them to make them because gonna
[1:23:49] leave them they were act just like
[1:23:50] mangas with the greed and the
[1:23:53] selfishness and the politics that is man
[1:23:55] as in a chairman you remove one crop his
[1:24:00] next one is that of cookies alone end up
[1:24:02] crooked because that doesn't mean the
[1:24:04] heart of money is desperately wicked
[1:24:08] spider who can know it but God
[1:24:11] so that's why God said give me I'll give
[1:24:14] you a new heart you need a new one let's
[1:24:18] let's take a chance for give me your old
[1:24:19] one give you a new heart I'll give you
[1:24:21] our new spirit and I'll put my spirit
[1:24:23] into your spirit cause you connect with
[1:24:26] my word okay the Lord has showed in the
[1:24:28] house so the issue has always been a man
[1:24:36] surrendered to God
[1:24:37] Jesse people want supernatural and signs
[1:24:39] and wonders and clarifying lights and so
[1:24:41] on they want God to come down and so on
[1:24:43] to say I am right and all others is
[1:24:45] wrong and God is not on that God not I'm
[1:24:49] trying to vindicate a church or a man
[1:24:51] he's here about vindicating his word
[1:25:01] if I die in the morning the word is
[1:25:03] still true if I die in the morning the
[1:25:06] promise is correct
[1:25:08] this word will be confirmed oh give the
[1:25:11] Lord a Shh
[1:25:13] all right he know what he needs one man
[1:25:17] he always used one man at a time we
[1:25:19] started a few nights another group you
[1:25:21] just want one that's all he needs cause
[1:25:23] two men have two different ideas he just
[1:25:24] takes one man and what he just makes one
[1:25:27] man he represent himself true that one
[1:25:28] person never did he do it otherwise and
[1:25:31] he's got one person today and that
[1:25:33] person is the one we just read after the
[1:25:36] Holy Spirit that will send me a man here
[1:25:46] one person that is the Holy Spirit he is
[1:25:49] the person that God has sent forth the
[1:25:53] spirit of Jesus Christ into the earth
[1:25:56] the Spirit of God the manifest and
[1:25:59] declare Christ to his church just to
[1:26:01] continue his life to the church he
[1:26:05] Christ was the Living Word of God yes
[1:26:08] why because he was expressing God to
[1:26:12] himself he was soul completely
[1:26:16] surrendered to the word till he and the
[1:26:19] world was the same and that's exactly
[1:26:22] what the church ought to be today
[1:26:26] that the Word of God is the same what is
[1:26:29] he saying we have to become the very
[1:26:31] Living Word of God itself isn't that
[1:26:34] right so therefore you have a choice
[1:26:37] today to receive the word inwardly and
[1:26:40] willingly as opposed to be ultimately
[1:26:44] informally you have a choice to receive
[1:26:47] the word as from God or if it was a man
[1:26:51] trying a little thing was a man trying
[1:26:54] something well he trying something but
[1:26:56] if it's a word of God you have to
[1:26:57] receive it in early and willingly
[1:26:58] because they receive the word you become
[1:27:01] the word itself
[1:27:03] so butter Branham was brain father beat
[1:27:06] angry that I would I would his truth we
[1:27:08] tangley for the Holy Spirit who is the
[1:27:10] Living Word here tonight to manifest any
[1:27:12] divine blessings that God Almighty has
[1:27:14] promised and now Lord Jesus to see that
[1:27:17] you were conceived here and is lit by
[1:27:18] the Holy Spirit and he wrapped himself
[1:27:20] in a blood cell broke the cell open
[1:27:22] Calvary no man takes his life he lead on
[1:27:24] his life freely and the blood cell was
[1:27:26] broken here we go
[1:27:27] because the Spirit could be made free
[1:27:30] from the blood coming into the body
[1:27:33] again come into the blood it was given
[1:27:35] and his body came water blood and spirit
[1:27:37] just like a natural bird water blood and
[1:27:40] spirit and I pray tonight if there's
[1:27:42] someone here who has never come into the
[1:27:44] body of Christ
[1:27:45] watch now to become a full believer
[1:27:47] sealed unrecognized by the Father God
[1:27:51] that distributor right night that they
[1:27:53] will receive it granted Lord to thy
[1:27:55] mercy we ask oh praise God so the true
[1:27:59] call of God is the broken blood cell of
[1:28:02] Christ that released the Spirit of God
[1:28:04] to pull you into the body and by one
[1:28:07] Spirit we are baptized into that body
[1:28:09] not into a church in a church a
[1:28:11] fellowship but that spirit pulls you
[1:28:13] into the body of Christ where you are
[1:28:15] placed into the body of Christ so he
[1:28:18] Christ was deity himself made flesh on
[1:28:21] earth the manifest is love to the people
[1:28:23] under take away sin of the earth he came
[1:28:25] here in order that he could anchor depth
[1:28:27] in his own body because that was the
[1:28:29] curse the day you eat there after day
[1:28:31] you die so death was the curse upon the
[1:28:33] earth so he came to anchor death like a
[1:28:35] stinger he came to pull debt and unlatch
[1:28:38] it in his body that I posit that where
[1:28:41] is your sting grave Reza victory because
[1:28:43] Jesus come on Britney curse of death
[1:28:45] that we'd have to fear death no more but
[1:28:48] we could free that's why I come that you
[1:28:50] might have life and have it more
[1:28:52] abundantly
[1:28:53] Oh give the Lord some praise as people
[1:28:55] listen listen he came here in order to
[1:28:59] anchor death in his own body you can
[1:29:01] anchor sickness in his own body or glory
[1:29:03] to God the curse that ought to have been
[1:29:05] on you he took it upon himself I like to
[1:29:08] die like a man
[1:29:09] in order to redeem you back
[1:29:11] in the full fellowship with the father
[1:29:13] full fellowship Oh glory to God that's
[1:29:18] the power of love that's the power of
[1:29:20] redemption for God so loved the world he
[1:29:22] gave His only begotten Son that
[1:29:24] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:29:26] perish but have everlasting life
[1:29:28] what praising him on the Lord my god
[1:29:31] what a marvelous thing our hearts can't
[1:29:33] conceive what a thing that was what he
[1:29:35] did we are too slow our mind little
[1:29:38] sluggish the vowels have been stopped up
[1:29:40] they've been paralyzed by unbelief and
[1:29:42] fear and doubt it can't work flow free
[1:29:45] like it should do it
[1:29:46] unless unless we let the Holy Spirit so
[1:29:48] dominate our lives till it pushes those
[1:29:51] vowels then life begins to stop
[1:29:54] operating or glory to God the mechanics
[1:29:57] is there you know but the vowels cut up
[1:29:59] but but we want the Holy Spirit to so
[1:30:02] dominate our lives that the fast are the
[1:30:05] kind of moving the primly hands upon the

[1:53:47] a living example then you are a pistol
[1:53:50] of God read by all men Oh glory to God
[1:53:54] using them disciples and the early days
[1:53:56] our Bibles the bad was even written yet
[1:53:58] the New Testament was written yet
[1:54:00] and then Old Testament was big long
[1:54:01] screws so they can't walk along with a
[1:54:03] coat I'm big screws wrong and rule in
[1:54:06] prophecy no they were the living wood
[1:54:08] itself when the speak was the word it
[1:54:11] was the Word made flesh Oh hallelujah Oh
[1:54:14] glory to God you believe that Thank You
[1:54:17] Laura
[1:54:17] so the mind in Christ you take the word
[1:54:20] just like he did because he was the word
[1:54:22] and the man of Christ in you you are the
[1:54:24] world you are the gods live in word
[1:54:26] representatives of him here on the earth
[1:54:28] continuing to work the church should be
[1:54:30] that way
[1:54:31] so the Bible is manifested again like in
[1:54:34] the early days of the disciples they had
[1:54:37] no scripture what they were preaching
[1:54:39] what Scripture because they were the
[1:54:41] Living Word and we'll come back to that
[1:54:42] you know after court knowledge yes
[1:54:45] they'll come on all we do after question
[1:54:46] or we will be decodes be caught made
[1:54:48] flesh or chlorine a continuation of the
[1:54:51] Living Word or glory Christ veiled in
[1:54:54] Tabernacles walking on two feet in
[1:54:57] Trinidad you may see that yet but it was
[1:54:59] happened or glory the god holy well
[1:55:02] recognize Christ you're gonna walk like
[1:55:03] him you're gonna talk like him they're
[1:55:05] gonna live like him you're gonna love
[1:55:07] like him you're gonna forgive like him
[1:55:08] they're gonna he like him you're gonna
[1:55:10] act like him that's how you know Christ
[1:55:12] oh no I'm not all that good samanya no
[1:55:19] it happened here - I'm not talking more
[1:55:21] than miss Teresa my hello so he was
[1:55:23] Hitler and find like a blast in
[1:55:25] ministries no it's not a blast in this
[1:55:27] region is the emphasis and mysteries
[1:55:29] with other life that is that is a
[1:55:32] challenge to me because if it is
[1:55:34] mysteries then the most mysterious be
[1:55:36] sure he has the habit
[1:55:37] it's just that Paul already handled that
[1:55:40] by say do you know all mysteries and
[1:55:41] have all knowledge and don't have
[1:55:43] charity you're still back to square one
[1:55:46] you just like a man you a token of
[1:55:47] mysteries
[1:55:51] say talking Greek a cocking lactating
[1:55:54] you're talking what kinda thing and
[1:55:55] people head just drizzle all the know
[1:55:58] the nutrition and as a you know as a
[1:56:00] mighty man because he could talk mighty
[1:56:02] and you had to in staff that was what
[1:56:06] we're getting service
[1:56:07] I was I was blessed you click you see
[1:56:17] what we shot last week you put a pig in
[1:56:20] a cage you putting on a legalism you
[1:56:23] lock him up you take much TP be be quiet
[1:56:25] he lock up in the cage and here on a
[1:56:28] truck going to the slaughter they pick
[1:56:33] just didn't make any noise now but
[1:56:34] loosen it first mud poorly season it he
[1:56:38] said this is mines this is what I'm
[1:56:40] claiming because he's a pig he do have a
[1:56:43] lamb nature the pig goes back to the
[1:56:45] matted because he's bound by legalism
[1:56:48] and that is why some people love
[1:56:49] legalistic preachers because keep them
[1:56:52] in a kid's left turn and they love that
[1:56:55] commanders the on yourself to
[1:56:57] domina that's why people like communism
[1:56:59] they control yourself so they want a man
[1:57:01] to control them you see the God's law is
[1:57:07] internal
[1:57:09] man's law is external that's right now
[1:57:12] jail and prison for people can behave
[1:57:14] yourself lock up arrest two in jail
[1:57:17] judge thanks for the people that cabbie
[1:57:18] deserve but really and truly God wanted
[1:57:21] law to be internal but you know how to
[1:57:23] behave yourself that's what the cost
[1:57:26] become to bring about behavior because
[1:57:28] your behavior is what set you to
[1:57:30] adoption it's not just son is the right
[1:57:32] kind of a son so we never got much Sun
[1:57:35] nor was the right kind and I'm all kind
[1:57:37] of son Rascals son ropes son Rennie good
[1:57:40] son but what one day right pain they're
[1:57:43] all kind of ministers men that not
[1:57:45] called halfway called when I'm talking
[1:57:49] to my name cut it off but they're doing
[1:57:53] this stuff on a hot in fact they
[1:57:57] reckon Hyundai destroy it Paul in Paul
[1:58:01] is port of call seven enemies of the
[1:58:03] cross he said but one thing I rejoiced
[1:58:06] is a crisis preached it says the enemies
[1:58:09] is there are contrary people the enemies
[1:58:12] of the cross is about his consolation
[1:58:14] that Christ is preached at least at
[1:58:16] least something about Christ but them as
[1:58:19] well practice dogs and already call them
[1:58:22] real characters but this is the gospel
[1:58:24] and we have the same thing no so watch
[1:58:27] there we go I already so Christ the
[1:58:30] Bible is manifested again like an Aries
[1:58:33] of Christ cause are you ready
[1:58:35] you are a predestinated seed just like
[1:58:38] Christ was you know heard what we said
[1:58:41] before
[1:58:42] your heart is prepared you're built has
[1:58:44] been pre-planned and not you are here
[1:58:47] that you are a predestinated seed just
[1:58:51] like Christ was and when the rain falls
[1:58:55] under seed the life produces itself when
[1:58:59] the Holy Spirit falls so forget about
[1:59:03] her in the rain coming there is another
[1:59:05] issue is if you have the seed because
[1:59:08] the life will produce itself when the
[1:59:11] rain falls or give the Lord a shout so
[1:59:15] the most important thing is for you to
[1:59:17] receive see them
[1:59:19] on top of word on top of word what seed
[1:59:22] promises by these promises you become a
[1:59:26] partaker of God's divine nature by what
[1:59:28] by promises supported random came to
[1:59:31] introduce us to precious promises I
[1:59:32] promise you this I promise you that I
[1:59:35] promise you the Holy Ghost I promise I
[1:59:36] promise I promise I promise that's what
[1:59:37] you're receiving you under promise your
[1:59:40] child of the kingdom your child a
[1:59:42] promise just think those guys in Egypt

[2:00:38] line and come back and bring a report to
[2:00:40] the people that they will know I am true

[2:01:56] Giants I can say let's go up at once
[2:01:58] wherever they take the doctors feet you
[2:02:05] think he didn't see Giants through caleb
[2:02:07] sorry chance to but he was hearing from
[2:02:09] the Giants he was hearing what God said
[2:02:11] and when you hear what God said Giants

[2:02:16] there is a stone or get the Lord a shell
[2:02:19] or a are you here with me for every goal
[2:02:25] I there is a stone and when you
[2:02:28] understand what God said that coordinate
[2:02:30] of man that would lie you not gonna be
[2:02:33] intimidated by any child
[2:02:39] hallelujah
[2:02:40] so you are predestinated seed just like
[2:02:44] Christ was say after me I am a
[2:02:48] predestinated seed say it again I am a
[2:02:52] predestinated seed that's who you are
[2:02:55] Oh glory to God a predestinated seat
[2:03:01] that's right the delicateness of you
[2:03:03] while you were drinking smoking running
[2:03:06] around you still had to come because
[2:03:08] Jesus at all that the father had given
[2:03:10] me he'll come or give the Lord a show
[2:03:16] get the Lord up praise
[2:03:22] stop condemning yourself stop condemning
[2:03:26] yourself God told you the devil is a
[2:03:30] liar but glory to God every seat at the
[2:03:34] comfort
[2:03:36] [Music]
[2:03:41] you are predestinated seed just like
[2:03:44] Christ was and when the rain falls on
[2:03:46] the seed the life produces itself when
[2:03:50] the Holy Spirit falls what did Jesus
[2:03:54] tell them in acts 1:8 you shall receive
[2:03:56] power after the Holy Ghost come upon you
[2:03:59] power for what but what to pray for us
[2:04:02] to live a holy life power to overcome
[2:04:05] power to forgive power to repent power
[2:04:09] to pass the battle hallelujah praise God
[2:04:12] did token what power after the Holy
[2:04:15] Ghost what you supposed to be looking
[2:04:17] for the Holy Ghost
[2:04:18] that's your promise so when I fell on
[2:04:27] those seeds that he chose when before
[2:04:31] the foundation of the world
[2:04:32] they were predestined I see Peter who
[2:04:35] denied him three times
[2:04:37] we told us he was predestinated I wanted
[2:04:42] to bring it real to you Peter who denied
[2:04:44] I don't know him I don't know I don't
[2:04:45] even know simple yeah you ain't Church
[2:04:49] no no no not not me wrong man when he's
[2:04:53] not a closer deny him maybe not he
[2:04:54] because Kristen Lucas
[2:04:56] then Peter wept I am saying to you he
[2:04:59] was a predestinated see this is the part
[2:05:03] I wanna get to this emotional seed here
[2:05:06] disciples 120 this Harlem says opening
[2:05:10] up room these seeds the word and the
[2:05:16] word was laying on dear without life in
[2:05:19] it when there were any upper room they
[2:05:23] were the word without life waiting for
[2:05:29] the Holy Ghost waiting for dynamics
[2:05:33] waiting for the power but they were the
[2:05:36] word because Luke 24 Jesus opening
[2:05:39] understanding to the scripture and open
[2:05:42] the word to them they knew who they were
[2:05:44] oh they were predestinated seeds there
[2:05:48] was sons of God original seeds
[2:05:51] ship you taught
[2:05:52] of God let's continue let's continue and
[2:05:56] the world was laying there without life
[2:05:59] in it and all of a sudden they came from
[2:06:02] a song from heaven as the waters began
[2:06:06] to gush down and it actually fell all
[2:06:09] the house where they were sitting and
[2:06:11] the seeds begin to grow to begin to
[2:06:14] manifest itself the Word of God being
[2:06:16] made manifest in other words join to was
[2:06:19] an effect what the joy says shall come
[2:06:22] to pass that I poured my spirit upon all
[2:06:25] flesh young men shall see visions all
[2:06:28] men shall dream dreams that was a
[2:06:30] prophecy from joy or glory to God Isaiah
[2:06:34] 28 with stammering lips and other
[2:06:36] tongues that speak to these people
[2:06:38] so Jesus seasoned on with these promises
[2:06:41] so when the spirit fall it was fallen in
[2:06:44] connection to the prophecy of joy as I
[2:06:48] believe that's right Peter came and said
[2:06:50] this is that that the Prophet Joel
[2:06:53] because before I become materialized it
[2:06:56] has to be spoken or glory of God and
[2:06:59] before it is spoken it's got to be the
[2:07:02] thoughts of God or give the Lord a show
[2:07:05] so the thoughts of God drop down
[2:07:07] prophesy angel prophesy my sire and
[2:07:10] there goes the Upper Room
[2:07:11] [Applause]
[2:07:15] what about you and I this morning
[2:07:18] halleluyah halleluyah
[2:07:20] my my my it began to manifest itself the
[2:07:24] would have got being manifested you see
[2:07:27] there's no profit you see now why I have
[2:07:31] been so jealous of the kind of seed that
[2:07:35] I planted for the body what what did we
[2:07:37] sew back on now what if we sow confusion
[2:07:39] what we if we show again some other
[2:07:41] judgments about you that is in other
[2:07:43] words we can gain stolen dropping on
[2:07:44] this one that doesn't give us adoption
[2:07:46] Lord revealed to me years ago a crashing
[2:07:50] somebody doesn't put you up so i beat up
[2:07:53] this one and be that one that doesn't
[2:07:54] put you up bless people honor people oh
[2:07:58] yes inspire people save them it love
[2:08:02] them isn't that right watch you see why
[2:08:06] I've been so zealous of the kind of seed
[2:08:08] I planned for the body the rain is going
[2:08:12] to fall pretty soon now I mean the real
[2:08:15] rain and it's got to have C to fall on
[2:08:19] he's I hope I live to see it well God
[2:08:24] didn't allow him to live to see it but
[2:08:25] we gonna see it when the real rain fall
[2:08:30] on DC's here fallen faith and virtue and
[2:08:33] knowledge on temperance all these laying
[2:08:36] inside of you right now right now a
[2:08:38] pyramid has been built inside of you
[2:08:39] it's the word inside of your pyramid is
[2:08:42] already inside of you or glory to God
[2:08:45] and seed form or glory arena have to
[2:08:47] fall on that green have to fall on that
[2:08:50] green have to fall on that Jesus was
[2:08:53] God's seed and he had to wait for the
[2:08:55] rain and he was going down to John to be
[2:08:59] baptized and when he birthed baptized
[2:09:01] the dove the ring the power the dynamics
[2:09:05] in the fullness come upon Jesus and he
[2:09:08] become the anointed son this is my
[2:09:10] beloved son this is Jesus no carpenter's
[2:09:13] son as it was doing carpentry this is
[2:09:18] Jesus it hears a silence from age 12 to
[2:09:20] 30 this the same Jesus everybody seen
[2:09:23] making door and making cupboard and make
[2:09:26] whatever it is the capital isn't that
[2:09:28] right with this carpenter walking down
[2:09:31] to the Jordan River
[2:09:32] John the baptizing and got jumped was
[2:09:35] told the one who you see the Deaf come
[2:09:37] down and remain so if somebody'd of hit
[2:09:40] and fly off you know like anyone because
[2:09:42] maybe somehow they don't get them and
[2:09:44] fight off but this one the dog have to
[2:09:46] remain that's the one so when Jesus came
[2:09:49] even who he was but when he saw that
[2:09:51] does he know that's the Messiah he said
[2:09:54] you should baptize me she said that
[2:09:56] might be so but we have to fulfill all
[2:09:58] righteousness wash this land brother or
[2:10:01] glory the club because Islam is about to
[2:10:03] be crucified
[2:10:04] Oh glory to God and John baptized him
[2:10:07] and Jesus let by the spirit let by the
[2:10:12] spirit into the wilderness to overcome
[2:10:16] the lust of the eyes to overcome the
[2:10:18] lust of the flesh to overcome the pride
[2:10:20] of life to overcome the attacks of the
[2:10:22] devil and all he did was to say this
[2:10:24] written what was he saying that for for
[2:10:26] you for me it is written because it has
[2:10:30] to be spoken for it to be written and
[2:10:32] once it is written that word cannot be
[2:10:35] defeated the world will defeat the devil
[2:10:38] anywhere anytime anyplace under any
[2:10:42] condition that's the word or give the
[2:10:45] Lord a shout Jesus defeated the devil
[2:10:48] not by powerful by the way

[2:21:50] Moses vo he was the Living Word to the
[2:21:53] people and today the people that are
[2:21:56] feel are the same thing they are written
[2:21:57] epistles read of all men not a new
[2:22:01] epistle
[2:22:02] but the Epistle that's been written made
[2:22:07] manifest
[2:22:08] it's doles who believe the world and the
[2:22:11] promise of this day that God is pouring
[2:22:13] out his spirit upon all flesh and that
[2:22:15] is written epistles I when a person
[2:22:17] tries to kindly impersonate that it
[2:22:19] backfires because their life shows what
[2:22:22] you are so what is the word a word is a
[2:22:25] manifestation of a thought it's an
[2:22:26] expression of a thought right before you
[2:22:29] see anything
[2:22:29] subconsciously you think it before you
[2:22:31] speak it he taught and he spoke a word
[2:22:34] and the word has made manifest and every
[2:22:36] word in the Bible is got parts lead in
[2:22:38] seed form and that's just the law he put
[2:22:41] it that's why Gordon come to another man
[2:22:43] he's a virgin shall conceive which is
[2:22:45] the seed the woman isn't that right
[2:22:46] though he's not right he come at her see
[2:22:49] Jesus isn't right so every word in the
[2:22:51] Bible is God taught Sladen seed form if
[2:22:54] receive into human being spoke by the
[2:22:57] same thought that materialized the Bible
[2:22:59] it brings a thing to pass how powerful
[2:23:02] could the church be the Bible says let
[2:23:03] his mind I was in Christ being you as a
[2:23:06] man thinketh in his heart so is he know
[2:23:08] your thoughts if they become expression
[2:23:10] okay oh he's got knowledge - you know me
[2:23:13] like God said let there be a world
[2:23:15] before it could be a word try to be a
[2:23:17] thought so God in the creation created
[2:23:20] the world by his thought and then spoke
[2:23:23] it then he expressed it then I become
[2:23:26] material oh my and if that same spirit I
[2:23:29] said let there be light and there was
[2:23:31] light said let there be trees and there
[2:23:33] was trees and if that seemed mine that
[2:23:36] was in Christ being you and you say let
[2:23:39] there be no cancer then it would be gone
[2:23:42] let the blind eyes be open then it would
[2:23:46] be so it's your tort or glory to God so
[2:23:51] what we're looking for now is the main
[2:23:53] of God to drop down that the thoughts of
[2:23:56] God could come down however you speak is
[2:23:58] not our word it's God's thought
[2:24:00] expressed which is his word that can
[2:24:02] fail okay the Lord has showed do you see
[2:24:05] it now
[2:24:08] we're not talking about a suggestion
[2:24:10] we're talking about God stinking comment
[2:24:14] dong into your heart
[2:24:15] when you speak you're speaking the
[2:24:17] thoughts of God which is the Word of God
[2:24:19] half feet and God isn't that right now
[2:24:21] you can express it by mental conception
[2:24:23] but if it becomes a real revelation of
[2:24:25] God you see it before it happens and you
[2:24:27] express it in Word form and that will
[2:24:30] takes a whole and becomes material
[2:24:32] thought Express and hope God if your
[2:24:35] heart and your mind is so in filled with
[2:24:37] God's Spirit until your thoughts become
[2:24:39] his thoughts when your mind and your
[2:24:42] leaden and your guidance becomes a
[2:24:44] direct place a direct inspiration of the
[2:24:46] Holy Spirit that's moving in your motor
[2:24:48] being what kind of people should we be
[2:24:50] if the very Holy Spirit has you so
[2:24:52] empowered so embodied that you don't use
[2:24:56] your own thoughts
[2:24:57] you don't use your own mind you don't
[2:24:59] use your own opinion but God's but the
[2:25:02] Holy Spirit have you so built until your
[2:25:04] thoughts and your beam is God's Spirit
[2:25:07] expressing itself through you what kind
[2:25:10] of church should we be this is just you
[2:25:13] should want this is how you should want
[2:25:15] us to be minister everybody expressing
[2:25:18] God man dying out hollowed out Oh God
[2:25:23] you know Oh glory to God and the Spirit
[2:25:26] of God could express himself to the
[2:25:29] flesh of that man would mean flesh the
[2:25:32] Living Word what kind of people would be
[2:25:35] this morning
[2:25:35] if this Branum Tabernacle this morning
[2:25:37] was so filled with the presence of God
[2:25:39] why you wouldn't even use your own mind
[2:25:42] didn't even use your own thoughts it has
[2:25:44] no alternative of your own just to be
[2:25:46] led back the spirit they that are sons
[2:25:48] of God are led by the Spirit of God and
[2:25:51] when the human element moves out Oh
[2:25:53] glory to God and the Spirit of God since
[2:25:57] that vacancy one goes out and something
[2:25:59] comes in the human any man goes out and
[2:26:01] the Spirit of God fills that they can
[2:26:03] see when you empty yourself out then

[2:26:08] resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk

[2:28:15] come on now come on now yeah you know
[2:28:22] some fathers that half fight with his
[2:28:23] sons and some mothers have fight with
[2:28:24] the daughters and they all kind of all
[2:28:26] kind of petty shipping us all right God
[2:28:28] doesn't have that when when God's sons
[2:28:31] begin to manifest sin he is feel proud
[2:28:32] he's feel good about it we're gonna
[2:28:35] fight you activator just like him
[2:28:37] you talk about Adam was supposed to be a
[2:28:39] god of the earth come on G isn't that
[2:28:41] right he had dominion over the earth he
[2:28:44] could control the earth because that is
[2:28:46] what we were pleased here for and Jesus
[2:28:48] demonstrated that power and control when
[2:28:50] he said peace be still when he could
[2:28:52] take water
[2:28:53] isn't that right until it's in the wine
[2:28:54] and bypass all the processes he piped
[2:28:57] all the grapes all he personally
[2:28:58] Orlick fermentation if I pass all that
[2:29:00] act and he could convert it into wine
[2:29:02] because He is God he can handle the
[2:29:05] processes and bring it true and he can
[2:29:07] handle your processes and bring you true
[2:29:09] so the prostitute all the filthy woman
[2:29:12] whatever it is he could handle them and
[2:29:13] bring them true and convert them and
[2:29:15] change them into the ladies or glory of
[2:29:18] God that's why they could be genuine
[2:29:20] Christians you can take the drunkards
[2:29:22] and a drug addicts and bring them
[2:29:24] straight through
[2:29:24] there's nothing is too hard for the Lord
[2:29:26] he demonstrates because they are all
[2:29:28] woman like Sarah and transformed as a
[2:29:30] brief word Isaac nothing is right for
[2:29:32] the Lord
[2:29:33] or glory to God a little supper boy like
[2:29:35] David he can anoint him to be king and
[2:29:37] they were they ready yet nothing is too

[2:33:09] because the Holy Ghost come and dry the
[2:33:12] Holy Ghost I come down on deadness it
[2:33:14] has to have an atmosphere and the apples
[2:33:16] they have worship and praise that is
[2:33:18] what the Holy Ones come down into isn't
[2:33:20] that right but I banham you believe this

[2:33:26] ibaka this is some as I wasn't Moses
[2:33:29] I'll be with thee just know bill first
[2:33:31] this is a take a look at the 11th of
[2:33:35] September 1960 remember here we go I
[2:33:38] want you get this you can only be saved
[2:33:41] by your personal feet you can only be
[2:33:45] healed by your personal feet you believe
[2:33:49] this to be the Bible God's Word you
[2:33:53] believe your parcel to be a man of God
[2:33:55] whatever torch you go to if you don't
[2:33:57] you should leave it that's what the
[2:34:02] Prophet said don't believe the man is a
[2:34:04] man of God shouldn't leave it watch get
[2:34:09] to a man that is a man of God then if
[2:34:12] you believe him believe he's telling you
[2:34:15] the truth then accepted your own
[2:34:18] personal faith and Christ saves you no
[2:34:21] matter how good your pastor is how godly
[2:34:24] saintly your mother is how real the Word
[2:34:27] of God is how much you cry how much you
[2:34:29] pray it's your feet that saves you your
[2:34:34] personal faith and that is why I have
[2:34:36] the community you what you see what you
[2:34:40] believe what you act on him and your
[2:34:44] worship
[2:34:44] now the same thing applies no matter
[2:34:47] God's word that we said in the last days
[2:34:50] to straight sermons no I brought natural
[2:34:52] Israel and spiritual Israel together we
[2:34:54] are looking for the Joshua of this name
[2:34:56] here we go which is the holy spirit do
[2:35:02] you get it so just run as our minds
[2:35:05] somewhere I will give her Josh for the
[2:35:06] code name Joshua Joshua is the holy
[2:35:08] spirit to lead us to the land he has to
[2:35:11] speak to somebody because he's a spirit
[2:35:14] I've told you what he told me no you
[2:35:16] believe and be healed this is beautiful
[2:35:18] because called what God was veiled in
[2:35:20] brother Branham speaking this he's I
[2:35:22] told you he said no you believe and be
[2:35:25] healed did you notice that the Moses the
[2:35:28] great miracle performer brought Israel
[2:35:31] down to the land brought him up to the
[2:35:33] promised land but did not place the
[2:35:34] inheritance to them he did not give them
[2:35:36] inheritance he let him up to the land
[2:35:38] but Joshua devises and land to the
[2:35:40] people is that right and Christ here we
[2:35:43] go
[2:35:43] brought the church up to a place where
[2:35:45] the position was made possession was
[2:35:47] made to them was given to them just
[2:35:49] Jordan the cross but the Holy Spirit is
[2:35:51] the one who sets the church in order the
[2:35:55] Joshua of the day puts the church in
[2:35:57] order given to each one gives places
[2:36:00] position and he's the voice of God
[2:36:03] speaking in the inner man that Christ
[2:36:05] has saved the holy
[2:36:07] spirit and then he talked about Joshua
[2:36:09] and Caleb they heard a movement the
[2:36:11] people or it can't be done it can be
[2:36:13] done and Caleb run out in the midst of
[2:36:15] the people and quiet them yes it can be
[2:36:17] just what stood by him certainly it can
[2:36:19] be God given to us amen
[2:36:22] what was it he had the secret behind
[2:36:23] Caleb and Joshua they were positionally
[2:36:27] born in Christ they had a knowledge of
[2:36:31] the word and the word became manifested
[2:36:35] remember every one of those Israelites
[2:36:37] had the would preach to them but it only
[2:36:39] took effect upon Caleb and Joshua to
[2:36:41] realize what it was all about so that is
[2:36:45] the revelation Joshua and Caleb even
[2:36:47] though they were part of the whole bunch
[2:36:49] they were clearly had a position in
[2:36:51] Christ and they had revolution was all
[2:36:53] about and when your revision was about
[2:36:55] nobody could show you off
[2:36:56] nobody could set you back Oh glory to
[2:36:59] God because clear to you what your
[2:37:01] inheritance is isn't that right so if
[2:37:05] the emphasis here sets us like just for
[2:37:07] positionally if from here manases there
[2:37:10] and God here
[2:37:12] Benjamin dear so no Minister could place
[2:37:14] the church or place me or place somebody
[2:37:16] I can place you God has to please you as
[2:37:19] his sons and daughters do you believe
[2:37:20] that how God set some in the church
[2:37:23] through their labor pains they kept
[2:37:27] tremendous sometimes when a church here
[2:37:29] we go church are you ready oh don't tell
[2:37:32] me no we only homestretch I know we just
[2:37:35] call it extra time but I'm not notice
[2:37:37] I'm not getting tired right could this
[2:37:39] have our function to bring this thing
[2:37:40] today praise God amen
[2:37:44] watch when a church is groaning under
[2:37:48] the persecution of the outside world and
[2:37:50] that's gonna come push the Christian
[2:37:52] gonna come I never see a whole different
[2:37:54] thing in this message yes believe in our
[2:37:57] Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy
[2:37:59] Ghost is just as real to us as it was
[2:38:03] the Penta curse how they groan and cry
[2:38:06] under labor pains but when they are born
[2:38:09] one and positionally born to into the
[2:38:14] kingdom of God

[2:38:17] church some apostles some prophets some
[2:38:21] teachers some passes some evangelists
[2:38:25] there's a faithful ministry not before I
[2:38:29] want to say it again this is a wood from
[2:38:31] the Prophet this is the seer the Lord
[2:38:33] God has two pawn and positionally born
[2:38:38] didn't bought sets in the church not a
[2:38:41] man say he's a pastor and therefore he
[2:38:43] that makes him a faithful minister no or

[2:51:52] is the father of Jesus Christ the Great
[2:51:53] Spirit dwelt in the fullness of the
[2:51:55] power in Jesus Christ which is a
[2:51:57] tabernacle of God made flesh dwell on
[2:51:59] the earth Jesus was the word since John
[2:52:02] 1 and the words was invisible now listen
[2:52:05] close the word was invisible until it
[2:52:09] was made flesh and then the will become
[2:52:12] visible and chew his sacrificial data
[2:52:14] Calvary on his resurrection positionally
[2:52:17] places Church in that realm that the
[2:52:20] same invisible God can come into the
[2:52:24] individual and make that word visible oh
[2:52:27] my I wish my church could get that same
[2:52:32] see brother Branham he could come out of
[2:52:35] the way to make quad visible to the

[2:53:06] can strike the word because is the
[2:53:09] Living Word of God then the bride is
[2:53:11] always part of the bridegroom so the
[2:53:13] bride will not be a denomination it will
[2:53:16] have to be the word manifested to be the
[2:53:18] bride of Christ so all the people trying
[2:53:21] to say this choice have it this choice
[2:53:22] have it Duchess of it nice foolishness
[2:53:23] it will not be a church it has to be the
[2:53:25] word
[2:53:26] manifested so you are written epistles
[2:53:30] and Baram says they were ignorant and
[2:53:32] unlearned
[2:53:33] but they were written epistles read that
[2:53:35] they have been with Jesus called Jesus
[2:53:38] was manifested instead of true them here
[2:53:41] we go Christ filled in their flesh
[2:53:45] manifested made alive like he was in
[2:53:48] Moses oh praise the name of the Lord
[2:53:51] Oh glory to God do you see that so go to
[2:53:56] heaven that guacho ends in the Christ
[2:53:58] and I'll go John golden to the bride so
[2:54:00] when announcing the fire came lion they
[2:54:02] were judged because God had a neutron in
[2:54:05] the heart of Peter isn't that right no
[2:54:08] everybody can't be a preacher but you
[2:54:11] got a voice hallelujah if they can't
[2:54:14] preach the people are sermon you're
[2:54:15] still a preacher if you're a preacher
[2:54:17] you're called to the pulpit to preach if
[2:54:18] you're not you're still a preacher but
[2:54:20] live the people a sermon let your sermon
[2:54:22] be lived and it's the voice of God that
[2:54:25] will bring a reproach then we reject it
[2:54:27] they will say if there's any amount of
[2:54:29] God it's that man a woman live your
[2:54:31] sermons those how to preach them if
[2:54:33] you're not called to be a preacher
[2:54:34] you'll get mixed up and messed up your
[2:54:36] tongue to people up to and ruin them and
[2:54:38] yourself live your sermons the preachers
[2:54:40] call the preaches and to live it if you
[2:54:42] can live it then stop preaching it but
[2:54:44] you're supposed to live a Simmons Denver
[2:54:46] Imam said voices how we need intestines
[2:54:49] of ill thousands of lived voices
[2:54:52] hallelujah praise God the thunder of God
[2:54:56] turning out and sweetness and holiness
[2:54:59] and purity undefiled eyes walking around
[2:55:02] the earth today without a blemish yes
[2:55:04] sir real Christians that's the Tunde
[2:55:06] against the enemy the devil don't care
[2:55:08] how old you holla the devil care how
[2:55:10] much it jump up and down what hurts the
[2:55:12] devil is to see sanctified holy life
[2:55:15] consecrated to God see anything to him
[2:55:18] call him anything just as sweet as can
[2:55:20] be
[2:55:20] we write on that chose him away that's
[2:55:23] the Tunder that shakes the devil
[2:55:24] some say well if he could preach like
[2:55:26] Billy Graham or about somebody a great
[2:55:28] inventor speaker who sometimes the devil
[2:55:31] just laughter that he don't pay no
[2:55:33] attention and nothing you can hold it
[2:55:35] till you want all the seminary
[2:55:38] trained and devastate back
[2:55:39] laughs I mean Holi Diwali laughing
[2:55:42] laughing at geology but when he sees
[2:55:44] that life he can laugh at that because
[2:55:46] you know what I'd like did back there
[2:55:48] right look at all these houses back
[2:55:50] there that mean that child but the
[2:55:52] Epilepsy saying come out of him they're
[2:55:54] welcome and ever and ever sit in this
[2:55:55] and now aren't you making a podium of
[2:55:57] yourselves they were talking to them now
[2:56:00] you see what you're doing Jesus told you
[2:56:01] he commissioned you to cast me on
[2:56:03] another one you can do it but brother
[2:56:05] when they see him come one come walking
[2:56:07] quietly he didn't have to see nothing
[2:56:10] the devil was already scared right there
[2:56:12] he knowed he had to leave cause he had
[2:56:16] come a life not a sermon but a life not
[2:56:20] mysteries a life not more revelations a
[2:56:24] life he said come out of him that done
[2:56:26] it quietly
[2:56:27] he knew what he was talking about oh
[2:56:29] praise the name of the Lord please God
[2:56:34] God is know my simplicity and a
[2:56:36] revelation of Jesus Christ in the most
[2:56:39] illiterate person or praise
[2:56:42] isn't that right Northern Rock accepted
[2:56:45] your life is gone and he has the
[2:56:48] preeminence east
[2:56:48] and you show the Prime Minister the
[2:56:50] people and they see the very life and
[2:56:52] works inside so in other words you say
[2:56:54] it has to come to a manifestation we put
[2:56:56] too much emphasis on the mechanics it
[2:56:58] has to come to dynamics by lack of this
[2:57:00] revelation is why are so many different
[2:57:02] divisions and so much mockery so much
[2:57:04] divisions because the people lack the
[2:57:06] revelation the teachers lack the
[2:57:08] revelation so who can really boost and
[2:57:10] say I have it who can claim money that's
[2:57:13] why I asked years ago which Minister
[2:57:15] knee which church which man have the
[2:57:17] Ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:57:18] none so all the big claims and this
[2:57:22] heightened and big sword fighting and
[2:57:23] like the and championship thing like
[2:57:25] that

[3:27:59] want to have a prayer chain throughout
[3:28:01] the church from 12:00 a.m. which will be
[3:28:04] 12:00 a.m. Wednesday morning until 12:00
[3:28:08] midnight
[3:28:09] closing out a 24 hour period of
[3:28:12] Wednesday we have people downstairs with
[3:28:18] the different time slots it's open to
[3:28:21] anyone in the church
[3:28:22] and we try to have an unbroken chain of
[3:28:24] Prayer and we want to have a burden for
[3:28:28] revival a burden for deliverance a
[3:28:31] burden for the holy ghost a burden for
[3:28:34] God to do something for our lives the
[3:28:36] Bible speaks of put a mark upon those
[3:28:38] that sigh and cry for the abomination in
[3:28:41] the city so we want to take some time
[3:28:43] because the revival is up to us but the
[3:28:46] amount of tortas that the minister could
[3:28:48] never bring the revival so the the
[3:28:50] change in the church is when the people
[3:28:52] in the church begin to do something and
[3:28:54] then God could now use the minister in a
[3:28:57] different way because the people are
[3:28:58] pulling on the ministering spirit that
[3:29:01] angel that stands behind a sacred desk
[3:29:04] so that's it for the announcements
[3:29:07] technicians you could
[3:29:09] which over
