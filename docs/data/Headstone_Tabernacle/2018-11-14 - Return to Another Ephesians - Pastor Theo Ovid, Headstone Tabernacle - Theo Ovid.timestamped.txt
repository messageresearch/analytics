[23:18] world according to the Prince of the
[23:21] power of the air the spirit that now
[23:24] worketh in the children of disobedience
[23:27] among whom also we all had our
[23:29] conversation in times past in the lusts

[23:35] the flesh and of the mind and we're by
[23:39] nature the children of Wrath even
[23:40] mother's sooner was no differentiation

[23:55] quickened us together with Christ by
[23:59] grace are you saved and that raised us
[24:01] up together and made us sit together in
[24:03] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[24:06] the ages to come he might show the
[24:08] exceeding riches of His grace in his
[24:10] kindness towards us to Christ Jesus for
[24:14] by grace are ye saved through faith
[24:15] I'm not of us

[24:20] any man should boast for we are his
[24:22] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[24:26] good works which God hath before
[24:29] ordained that we should walk in them may

[24:50] returned to another Ephesians we turned
[24:53] to know if you just last time we spoke
[24:55] with him with us when zero but return to
[24:57] that first love getting back to that
[24:59] love getting back to that word isn't
[25:01] that right and we spoke about the food
[25:02] on his act please God the passion to
[25:04] know his word the cry for reaching over
[25:06] his spirit or begins to feed and instead
[25:09] of the church being on fire with the
[25:11] fire of God has cooled off and become a
[25:13] bit formal that is what was happening
[25:15] back to Ephesians they were getting
[25:17] formal the abandonment that God was
[25:21] dying out and the people want to careful
[25:23] about what God thought of them as they
[25:26] begin to be careful our what the world
[25:28] thought of them so you see when they
[25:30] come to that spot where you're more
[25:32] concerned about what God thinks about
[25:33] your mother husband father brother wife
[25:35] what about you doesn't matter what
[25:37] people say humans you want to study what
[25:39] God says
[25:40] Oh God feel about your life how God feel
[25:43] about your actions and your attitude and
[25:45] so on then it be so Ephesians Ephesus
[25:48] knees relaxed driftin a mat and relax
[25:51] and higher aims but they got relaxed and
[25:54] we can't afford to get relaxed that's
[25:56] why we want to push up the key a bit
[25:58] have that all-night prayer meetin you
[26:00] want to keep adding and adding an errand
[26:01] because we want to know we making that
[26:03] progress you say butter mom says you got
[26:06] to do something for water honor there
[26:08] are people who do like new kind of
[26:09] sacrifice they want what a bless em as
[26:11] they are you see but you see we once
[26:13] were sinners we once in lust we wanted
[26:16] all kind of stuff but God written but
[26:18] God
[26:19] rich rich rich and mercy
[26:20] had weakened us that's the word we want
[26:24] to emphasize tonight quicker quick and
[26:26] us hallelujah lively hope quicken us to
[26:30] a higher order thickeners what has to
[26:33] quicken you that's why all the father
[26:35] phone you called email you have to be
[26:38] called of God to be quickened hallelujah
[26:41] nonny let cannot be quickened but you
[26:43] can be quickened think about it now you
[26:46] were down in sin you were doing whatever
[26:47] but what quick on you and give you a
[26:49] sound that you may see that you could
[26:52] put your foot and walk that's why we
[26:54] could come and worship that's what I
[26:56] could come and express your feet and
[26:57] love to go on because he actually quit
[26:59] can you understand these people are just
[27:01] trying to press to go to church like
[27:03] they stand up to peel the plane lot oh
[27:05] I'm gonna say them or something like
[27:07] that no no no their lineups it to play
[27:10] lotto they line up to take the gamble
[27:12] then line up the ones on so like that
[27:13] but they're not line up to come in a
[27:15] church go out too quick on you and then
[27:17] your soul is being fed by the word you
[27:21] can be service because your soul is
[27:24] being fed by the word every service are
[27:28] getting strengthened every service are
[27:30] getting quicker every service again in
[27:32] Revelation every service should be
[27:34] empowered and you're going from Greece
[27:36] by grease to grease to grease the green
[27:39] from glory to glory from poet apart from
[27:41] strength to strength glory time
[27:47] evangelism this is background in from
[27:49] last week
[27:49] according to Malachi 4 used to bring
[27:51] back the faith that was once delivered
[27:53] to the Saints bring them back to the
[27:55] faith of the fathers the Pentecostal
[27:58] part in the restoration time
[28:01] this message is yet to see the
[28:03] Pentecostal part hallelujah we have
[28:05] message Pat teach and Pat word pack but
[28:08] as a Pentecostal part in the restoration
[28:11] time we have to move into that part
[28:13] that's the Holy Ghost part that's a
[28:16] spirit part that's the quickening pact
[28:19] that's where the quittin power comes
[28:20] within the word who you owe
[28:23] glory
[28:24] God hallelujah understand what the holy
[28:26] wasn't for to anoint the promises to
[28:28] yourself or glory that the promises that
[28:31] oh dear the promises is here because you
[28:34] are pointing it to yourself you have the
[28:37] spirit to anoint it to you or that's
[28:39] right just what that's a key like I say
[28:41] if the Lord be with me if this krypton
[28:44] power be with me if this anointing be
[28:47] with me if the Spirit be with me I shall
[28:50] be able to or give the Lord a shout in
[28:53] us do you understand he wasn't talking
[28:56] intellectual talking or he was talking
[28:59] spirit talk if the spirit be with me
[29:01] when the Spirit of the Lord comes upon
[29:04] my heart you see what David did when the
[29:07] Spirit come upon him what Samson did
[29:09] when the Spirit come upon him all those
[29:12] brothers when the Spirit come upon them
[29:14] that's a different thing altogether
[29:15] that's a different man altogether the
[29:18] spirit have to come upon you oh good I
[29:22] want that switch off on you tonight that
[29:24] you must know you have to go back to
[29:27] another Ephesians we don't want a
[29:28] Corinthian church we don't want the
[29:30] Latian church all that is good that's
[29:32] Scripture we want Ephesians we won the
[29:37] original because you can breathe back
[29:39] the original little plant and get back
[29:42] the original or glory to God hallelujah
[29:44] your concrete battle hybrid no mule Oh
[29:48] blowing Oh God
[29:50] original turbine horse you could get
[29:53] back that because he knew his father is
[29:55] his grandfather is he a thoroughbred
[29:57] horse and when they get a true word
[30:00] believer he is thoroughbred just chopped
[30:03] the word at him and is a big hearty Amen
[30:05] just deliver the word to him and because
[30:08] that's nothing but the truth
[30:10] that's a thoroughbred horse believer a
[30:13] thoroughbred word believer

[30:17] God to bless you in your own thing there
[30:18] you want to come out of that you want to
[30:21] be quick and like the scripture says

[30:28] high order but above the animals but a
[30:31] little lower than the Angels Oh glory

[31:21] nothing hybrid it won't stand

[34:57] see the loan can be reborn when God
[35:00] created a church he created a
[35:01] Pentecostal church
[35:02] no no dead message sitting on chairs
[35:04] talking about the original church that
[35:07] official church was a Pentecostal church
[35:09] that means that shouting singing and
[35:12] jumping praise God Pentecostal clapping
[35:15] you can't tap something is wrong because
[35:17] ex-factory Pentecostal experience then
[35:20] leaves clapping and then the work of the
[35:21] bingo fruit in the midst of that
[35:23] Pentecostal atmosphere before God cos in
[35:26] a prophet he had to send on the
[35:28] atmosphere 19:06 the atmosphere top-down
[35:31] and even before that God said behold I
[35:34] set before you an open door so he put a
[35:37] blood rain in the age we fall out he's
[35:39] here to bring the spirit itself without
[35:42] no man messenger or give the Lord a show
[35:46] he said before thee an open door I
[35:49] thought was normal open a new mental
[35:52] shut and God open the door to the spirit
[35:54] putting a man inside of here so your
[35:57] duty now man
[35:59] to promote the spirit of the law so the
[36:08] spirit is already here he believed that

[41:24] bit him and he the snake off
[41:26] honestly didn't kill him you shake it
[41:28] off show you the power of the blood is
[41:30] more powerful and snake poison think
[41:33] about don't think about it
[41:34] the power of the blood of Jesus is more
[41:36] powerful than snake poison was a
[41:44] Pentecostal church do we get that a
[41:47] Pentecostal church filled with the Holy
[41:49] Ghost
[41:49] men and women led by the Spirit of God
[41:53] not a man from somewhere
[42:04] stiff neck are not circumcised he was a
[42:07] pity it was no preacher he say you do
[42:09] resist the Holy Ghost man watch watch a
[42:17] panic on such a favour the Holy Ghost
[42:18] men and women led by dispersed but man
[42:20] cordon leave that alone
[42:22] he wanted to hydrate the church so he
[42:25] bred the world with the theology
[42:27] doctrines in all the nation you see they
[42:29] could argue over that because they might
[42:31] talk to better than your tortured
[42:33] doctrine that wasn't what one had in
[42:35] beginning co-pending we copy talking
[42:38] explain to my the doctrine because he
[42:40] was an unknown fisherman all he had was
[42:43] defeat that was delivered and defeat was
[42:49] Jesus Christ in him
[42:52] see when you have defeat
[42:56] education doesn't count because the
[43:01] wisdom of God is right on the shoulder

[43:18] named soul over until in the poor

[43:27] together in them scriptures to break the
[43:30] old testament and reveal the New
[43:32] Testament so he couldn't get Peter to do

[46:14] upon him to be ordained ministers of the
[46:16] Lord but highbreed and bringing the
[46:17] church and the theology instead of
[46:20] letting the Holy Spirit lead it they
[46:22] bred in bishops general overseers when
[46:25] the Holy Spirit is called originally of
[46:27] the church they hybrid the church and
[46:29] they did chicken they did the same with

[47:11] got the seed it hasn't got a ring to it
[47:14] life is right inside readin God wants it
[47:18] the way that admitted to the beginning
[47:20] so the church has been hybrid and know
[47:22] it come to a place where the church is
[47:23] more like a lunch any Church never
[47:26] though that left its original foundation
[47:28] has never be able to come again I know
[47:33] people don't like this but it is the
[47:34] truth when God sent luta yellow revival
[47:37] he swept the world but they organized it
[47:39] hybrid over the world and they produce a
[47:41] Catholic child when they did what did he
[47:43] do he would use a bunch of renegades
[47:45] hybrids never rolls and never arrives
[47:48] along come John Wesley safety after the

[48:14] gives you given to Adam it cause a
[48:16] hybrid feet it's a fit and it have
[48:21] hybrid feet and that's what the church
[48:24] so call have a hybrid feet it is mixed
[48:27] are you ready this fate is Mitchell
[48:30] fears don't frustration if it was
[48:35] genuine feel it would move genuine faith
[48:40] will say God said so that's why the
[48:42] Prophet said when a church is believing
[48:44] that the Holy Ghost is just as real as
[48:48] it was under the authentication how they
[48:51] grown and crying but when they are bored
[48:54] and positionally born then God sets in

[57:09] everybody like winter night Church and
[57:11] that nice world nice teachings and so on
[57:13] and they happy with the man but it's
[57:16] what happy with it
[57:17] it's what happy with the church is the
[57:20] church back to Ephesians what do we have
[57:22] this church not be exhorted and sharing
[57:25] thoughts every Sunday every Wednesday or
[57:27] do we see a as a vision that's my target
[57:30] then that's my golden yeah I'm ivy
[57:33] passenger corinne chest but i went to a
[57:34] destination that's my passion true so we
[57:37] become different churches with a
[57:39] destination you pass to them because it
[57:41] wasn't tally enough to what it's
[57:42] supposed to be but you have to see the
[57:44] vision of we're supposed to be the same
[57:46] right the vision and make it plain and
[57:48] has to have a good vision a scriptural
[57:50] vision God planted original seed where
[57:53] is that tree it had denominational
[57:56] branch grafted in and what keep cutting
[57:58] them off cotton law and the tree keep
[58:00] pushing up pushing up pushing up but at
[58:03] the end another original branch will
[58:06] come forth will produce another original
[58:09] freak because it's God's plantain faith
[58:15] like them other seasoned sided here but
[58:18] the original branches portion we want
[58:20] another Pentecost people say we get them
[58:24] they outright head because we don't want
[58:27] that because we know second one as we
[58:29] don't want that that because with word
[58:31] world would we don't want that we want
[58:33] the same thing we are returning to
[58:36] another leader
[58:38] [Applause]
[58:47] [Music]
[59:03] [Music]
[59:09] [Music]
[59:24] [Music]
[59:34] behind behind but what I realize is had
[1:00:29] to be translated go glowing either God
[1:00:31] whatever currency you know the currency
[1:00:33] is fit you can show what a prayer Bible
[1:00:36] and say God because I have this in my
[1:00:38] hand you have to answer my prayer Ubuntu
[1:00:41] like to kinda like that expect God to
[1:00:42] answer you because you like together go
[1:00:44] and say what is that what catch I'm
[1:00:45] sorry that that can affect the kingdom
[1:00:48] to candle burning they to or far and
[1:00:50] really marry that the kingdom what are
[1:00:53] you hearing that we call it three seas
[1:00:55] anger a man make that God came here and
[1:00:59] this man come up to me temple and boy
[1:01:02] Lord I am not like that melodia I paid
[1:01:04] types I decided that the Manzano Mesa
[1:01:07] nothing going to achieve all God have
[1:01:08] mercy upon me a sinner
[1:01:09] Jesus GSA which mama righteous man and I
[1:01:13] outside he recognizes the cinema this
[1:01:16] man is a sinner a noted not attributed
[1:01:19] because of what he does to be
[1:01:20] righteousness and god watch it attribute
[1:01:23] but I was an event so the confession I'm
[1:01:26] a sinner you either come in lord have
[1:01:28] mercy upon me God recommend that I heard
[1:01:30] of him adam wainwright just because he
[1:01:32] caught long and he got mad looking white
[1:01:36] corner look in the garment gonna look at
[1:01:39] that coat God looking at what's in the
[1:01:41] heart so it come back to our gospel in
[1:01:43] the heart and that's what he Peter got
[1:01:45] converted is a converted now the man is
[1:01:48] a gateway to be shown the main channel
[1:01:50] to get long to the womb of your spirit
[1:01:52] so it has to have a channel which is the
[1:01:54] main that's where you would have to
[1:01:56] confess
[1:01:56] so first is always mental but it jumps
[1:01:59] into spiritual it drops into the heart
[1:02:02] and it becomes a divine revelation that
[1:02:05] you actually possess possess it when it
[1:02:09] dropped on us outta here if it's yours
[1:02:11] I wanna jump in your SATA here there is
[1:02:13] no demon could go beyond their to what
[1:02:16] God put in your heart and that's why the
[1:02:19] Prophet said whatever your soul will
[1:02:21] never fail leave your soul to believe
[1:02:22] that is yours
[1:02:24] or blowing overreact one scored leave
[1:02:26] your sword of faith to believe in that
[1:02:28] if you want Oh hallelujah praise God or
[1:02:32] glory you understand that so the woman
[1:02:35] with the blood issue there was no
[1:02:37] scripture saying if you touch any
[1:02:38] garment she took that for herself she
[1:02:40] told herself that and it went so deep it
[1:02:43] went like a revelation into her spirit
[1:02:44] so she was convinced and if she only get
[1:02:47] here she'd be healed that's why she
[1:02:49] pushed it when she push if she was on
[1:02:52] this level when she see the crowd around
[1:02:53] Jesus back go back home but she said
[1:02:55] today's my day ain't going nowhere
[1:02:58] some big big fella stand up there that
[1:03:00] any intermediate or knock
[1:03:01] a bunch of men stand a bit twiddling
[1:03:03] their beers and watching Jesus cookie I
[1:03:04] shall not do with that they don't
[1:03:06] believe nothing
[1:03:07] the only come to try to interpret the
[1:03:09] master but she come for touch touch the
[1:03:12] hem of His garment that's all she comes
[1:03:14] rushing over my touch
[1:03:15] she comes in he bared his words she
[1:03:17] comes the question is words
[1:03:19] she'll come together Porton debating
[1:03:21] thing a doctrinal theology or Qi what is
[1:03:23] a touch because she had a problem and
[1:03:28] she had a need and she needed a pit road
[1:03:31] and she push a cheap press something
[1:03:35] struck a heart
[1:03:36] I went something strike your heart that
[1:03:38] is how you could push on press if we can
[1:03:40] strike in half you have no pusher and
[1:03:41] you have no person you're just thinking
[1:03:43] about it or glory no cover wants to
[1:03:46] strike your heart is there wait a minute
[1:03:47] the mean I could live higher than that
[1:03:49] wait a minute I could get a picture
[1:03:50] tonight wait a minute my home to have to
[1:03:53] have that atmosphere I could change the
[1:03:55] atmosphere around my life I can live in
[1:03:57] a higher and when you see that it was
[1:04:00] personal
[1:04:01] with the press no let me create
[1:04:02] atmosphere now you could believe God no
[1:04:04] or glory leg or are you it with the
[1:04:06] knife
[1:04:07] hallelujah glory not God so what the
[1:04:11] Bible teaches the new birth and there's
[1:04:13] some heated handshakes everything else a
[1:04:15] new birth but he can never take the
[1:04:17] place of the new birth it's got to be an
[1:04:18] experience to be born again so the
[1:04:22] intellectual st. a new book is the
[1:04:23] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:04:25] maybe was experienced not as a coat but
[1:04:28] the promise that new verses experience
[1:04:30] so the question made after which is
[1:04:31] first is it an experience or is it
[1:04:34] revelation
[1:04:35] those were revelation and stick with
[1:04:37] version alone the other people just
[1:04:38] however Elisha
[1:04:39] so I'm born again but he said a new put
[1:04:42] got to be an experience something that
[1:04:44] you know a Brit is a mess so what we see
[1:04:47] now the religion come first experience
[1:04:49] come after support the revelation and
[1:04:51] then go getting experience that's
[1:04:53] something else quicken in your life
[1:04:55] we believe that hallelujah glory to God
[1:04:59] so watch a being a baby is born we all
[1:05:02] know booties are mess when I baby is
[1:05:03] born if it's on the floor even in a shop
[1:05:06] I'm if it's a thing that crazy hospital
[1:05:08] it's a mess but it brings life and that
[1:05:10] is what the new bird is it's a mess no
[1:05:16] no no a mess it's a mess it's a mess but
[1:05:20] it brings life that's what a new word is
[1:05:22] it's a mess but it brings life it in
[1:05:24] style or put on or decoration a crease
[1:05:26] is about to really go so I will do
[1:05:29] believe the doctrine you have and I go
[1:05:30] see it so much I believe it different
[1:05:32] what are they do it the new bird means
[1:05:34] quad blood saw the flow inside of you
[1:05:36] you know what means that you are
[1:05:38] quickened into life the new birth mean
[1:05:41] you are son and daughter of God then
[1:05:43] under the blood of Jesus we get a
[1:05:44] fellowship because the blood of Jesus
[1:05:46] covers you it covers me also isn't that
[1:05:49] right
[1:05:50] so watch now I know you get up from the
[1:05:53] altar crying and boo-boo and squealing
[1:05:55] and slobbering it brother brings life it
[1:05:57] takes the starch out of you it makes you
[1:05:59] something you ought to be it takes all
[1:06:01] the world and stiff neck out of you
[1:06:03] isn't that right and it you said no what
[1:06:06] I take Jesus and my personal Caesar
[1:06:08] today what kind of say I take Jesus for
[1:06:10] my personal Savior
[1:06:11] listen
[1:06:12] that will never take the place of the
[1:06:14] nooblet when men and women come to the
[1:06:16] altar and forget where they are and who
[1:06:20] is wrong them until they rarely die out
[1:06:23] and are born again all night provisions
[1:06:25] and the power of the Holy Ghost get back
[1:06:28] into the church again Oh glory to God

[1:08:02] we are which he said version 10 in
[1:08:05] version 10 we find out the last
[1:08:07] messenger of the last gage during the
[1:08:10] time of his prophecy that seven seals
[1:08:13] would be open the seven mysteries
[1:08:15] Sevenfold Michigan left off in every age
[1:08:18] had some left off uniform I didn't have
[1:08:20] time to take care of it there's a lute I
[1:08:22] preached justification my feet and he's
[1:08:24] gone and then come weary sonification
[1:08:26] not only a penny coaster but we are
[1:08:28] promised corneration ten going to
[1:08:30] Malachi 4 are going to look something
[1:08:32] there's a common Ephesians it is that's
[1:08:35] the prophecy there's a comma infusion to
[1:08:37] this and that these Sevenfold missions
[1:08:40] of the world must be unfolded and it's
[1:08:42] the loudest an age where this takes
[1:08:44] place
[1:08:44] I believe we in the shadow of the coming
[1:08:47] of the Son of God and as Joshua just
[1:08:49] before the features raised up so they
[1:08:51] turned about the razor just before the
[1:08:53] next Ephesians and we are promised
[1:08:55] another Ephesians that's a promise
[1:08:57] that's that's the promise you say what
[1:09:00] this promise
[1:09:01] not for in chance not Hebrews not
[1:09:04] Galatians Ephesians respond that's what
[1:09:07] you're looking for
[1:09:08] nice try to come in a church for you
[1:09:10] want features man I've got to stand in
[1:09:11] the pulpit one that have Ephesians 4
[1:09:13] he's not right past the teacher prophet
[1:09:15] that's what your mother's either here Oh
[1:09:17] glory to Corinne Lynn Allen leave a man
[1:09:20] Karthik a family catechetical support
[1:09:22] that's been mapped officially Oh glory
[1:09:24] to man can take a family or whatever it
[1:09:26] is how could be the image take Kerry
[1:09:28] hosted or doctor that could go good for
[1:09:30] Corinthians but divisions so when it
[1:09:33] features ministers of the lineup of the
[1:09:34] world when that which is perfect is come
[1:09:39] that much as pat has done over it well
[1:09:42] he features is that much is perfect
[1:09:43] so all this part preaching on Pat
[1:09:45] ministry and practice that is finished
[1:09:47] with when we come to visions so when you
[1:09:50] see it come to read Ephesians ministers
[1:09:52] will have to sit down who know qualify
[1:09:54] for that level we didn't talk about
[1:09:57] being placed and the body and please
[1:10:00] positions coming back to that it has to
[1:10:02] be visuals you know have a read the word
[1:10:04] standard the correct and the Deacons the
[1:10:07] correct kind of elders everybody ought
[1:10:09] to stand up to it didn't I tell you I'm
[1:10:11] abortion oh that is decisions all man
[1:10:15] Jack lined up for that it's not my
[1:10:20] standard is quite standard in other
[1:10:23] words is the prom line when I meant put
[1:10:25] the plumb line you just hang it like
[1:10:27] that if you build em crooked it took it
[1:10:29] died not a plumb line fault
[1:10:31] you cap then the plumb line you just
[1:10:33] chopped the plumb line become my show
[1:10:36] you on straight edges if it's pocket
[1:10:38] it'd be probably expose it because
[1:10:40] Ephesians has the problem it has the
[1:10:43] original line the original world the
[1:10:45] original scene that's like
[1:10:47] operationalize in Ephesians the Superman
[1:10:55] assuredly
[1:10:56] you know church was not succeed in
[1:10:59] action is false
[1:11:01] see though the original Church if you
[1:11:04] just really pouring it the Lord Himself
[1:11:07] with everywhere with them Santa knows
[1:11:09] that we are coming back to that same at
[1:11:12] 16:20 the Lord Himself went everywhere
[1:11:15] with them confirming the word with signs

[1:11:20] confirmation of the world as we breached
[1:11:25] organized shout oh this is going good
[1:11:28] tonight hallelujah hallelujah redemption
[1:11:32] is in two parts come on I'll tell I'm
[1:11:34] going in to begin with a Catholic or the
[1:11:37] Methodist or the Baptist but we got to
[1:11:38] go decisions come on come on come on now
[1:11:41] becoming to the message but we have to
[1:11:45] go in teens lesions
[1:11:46] [Applause]
[1:11:48] how many messes Macrina
[1:11:59] go for profit hanging over seven prophet
[1:12:02] elijah what is good they commented the
[1:12:04] message but the message the catching
[1:12:06] divisions God sent Moses to get Israel
[1:12:10] out each opposed the promised land so
[1:12:13] you want to build a church in Egypt
[1:12:14] thank you my gosh if your name even feel
[1:12:20] right how big it set up send on bricks
[1:12:22] layer but the promise is not Egypt

[1:12:28] leave in here not if when you leave
[1:12:31] don't leave my bones here take my bones
[1:12:34] with you because resurrection is in the
[1:12:36] promised land my wedding rapture is is
[1:12:39] diffusion another a political jet
[1:12:44] rapture is an official you have to go
[1:12:47] into bodily features to put the rapture
[1:12:49] because that's a body fit is that and
[1:12:51] you have to have wrapped in faith to be
[1:12:53] changed not hybrid fate rapture in faith
[1:12:57] that's why raft with hybrid fittest evil
[1:12:59] its core is a deceitful fate it makes
[1:13:02] people think because they believe the
[1:13:04] message they have arriving and that time
[1:13:06] the on a journey they have to pour
[1:13:08] nominee visions and it's a battle to get
[1:13:11] here because it's shortened in front of
[1:13:13] you or get a little shock or give the
[1:13:16] Lord a shout be in the world tonight
[1:13:18] this is dossier the law tonight this is
[1:13:21] the message nobody wanna cross Jordan

[1:16:12] target tonight this is the word tonight
[1:16:14] let's continue Redemption us to
[1:16:17] different paths come out of antenna into
[1:16:20] first you have to come out of some
[1:16:22] people want to bring the world in with
[1:16:23] them but you're gonna come out a little
[1:16:25] to enter the Christ you got to come out
[1:16:28] of underneath to enter the faith they're
[1:16:31] gonna be wanting in your way
[1:16:32] for really a genuine Saint you must
[1:16:36] absolutely
[1:16:37] leave everything contrary to the world
[1:16:39] behind and this book of Ephesians of the
[1:16:44] Old Testament is Joshua and Moses
[1:16:47] represent the law that could not save no
[1:16:49] one what Greece could have Joshua here
[1:16:51] it means you have a savior I know we
[1:16:54] find out we have come to another
[1:16:56] Ephesians where here we go in our
[1:16:58] intellectual denominations and all our
[1:17:02] educational program has come to
[1:17:03] extraordin so now after 40 years of
[1:17:06] preaching and teaching and explaining
[1:17:07] and beaten and exhort him it comment on
[1:17:10] any
[1:17:11] where's the power Jordan
[1:17:16] we must them what that what watch in our
[1:17:20] intellectual denomination and so forth
[1:17:21] all our educational programs has come to
[1:17:24] children then we must have an Ephesians
[1:17:28] again we must have an exodus to come out
[1:17:33] and go into full rapture for what for
[1:17:39] what
[1:17:39] so Ephesians is for the rapture then to
[1:17:43] go in a rapture you have to return to
[1:17:46] Ephesians could we give the Lord a shout
[1:17:48] oh my name is Hannah tonight
[1:17:51] how many see that rimmel the point the
[1:17:54] rapture you have to go to the rescission
[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:03] from the one of the greatest pieces of
[1:18:05] The Full Gospel Church is not
[1:18:07] positionally knowing what they are in
[1:18:08] Christ Jesus
[1:18:09] I already said I made two classes of
[1:18:11] people one of them is Full Gospel
[1:18:12] learned man fundamental fundamental
[1:18:15] knows where he stands positionally only
[1:18:17] he's never reborn again we had on point
[1:18:21] he Mountain point he could talk on point
[1:18:25] everything is forget it you can't you
[1:18:28] can't get away from how we can explain
[1:18:29] it
[1:18:29] we're not born again just fundamental
[1:18:33] teaching alone so he doesn't have any
[1:18:35] feet and if there's no feet of course
[1:18:37] you expect no miracles right no signs no
[1:18:40] powers no worship no one knowing to know
[1:18:42] not to because if it is not there now
[1:18:44] the understanding of who they are that's
[1:18:46] they but not defeat but watch so it's
[1:18:50] just and the full gospel have been born
[1:18:52] again but do know instance now if I
[1:18:55] could get the full customer Pentecostal
[1:18:57] faith and the fundamental believers or
[1:18:58] the fundamental believers doctrine and
[1:19:01] the pillar of faith we have mean it's
[1:19:02] like a man I can write a check but he
[1:19:04] has not any money back when I signature
[1:19:08] but you know money
[1:19:16] the other men have money remark but he
[1:19:18] can say thanks trouble you need to get
[1:19:21] it together you won't have money and
[1:19:23] this is Asia I think anybody smiling
[1:19:25] right now
[1:19:25] but anyway you want
[1:19:27] not money but I'm signature he said he
[1:19:30] has to be Jenny you can't honey bun okay
[1:19:33] so watch one got the money in the mouth
[1:19:35] we can write a check they don't have to
[1:19:36] write a check I'm gonna want any back
[1:19:38] but if you get those two together or
[1:19:41] praise the name of the Lord so what a
[1:19:43] bomb says if you put the life of Jesus
[1:19:47] and Donna body I believe us it will be
[1:19:48] the same food the first one did they
[1:19:50] will write another book of Acts behind
[1:19:52] them because it with the same life see
[1:19:54] what I mean
[1:19:54] you can't get away from it playing
[1:19:56] leaders of the body God holds this key
[1:20:00] alone theologians can tell you it is not
[1:20:04] known is it from them they vote nothing
[1:20:07] about it God here we go
[1:20:09] is known by simplicity and revelation of
[1:20:13] Jesus Christ to the most illiterate
[1:20:15] person not my geology is the revelation
[1:20:18] of Jesus Christ as the Spiritist
[1:20:21] self-revealing
[1:20:22] that's why you come in the spirit that's
[1:20:24] why you're singing
[1:20:25] that's why your worship because in the
[1:20:28] spirit you forget the revelation God
[1:20:30] making himself known by revelation but
[1:20:34] God doesn't only Pickens I've got my
[1:20:36] revelation he mixes my manifestation
[1:20:39] also hope Laurie love God hallelujah
[1:20:42] upon this rock I'll build my church
[1:20:44] Nora rocks accepted nor schools accepted
[1:20:47] no nothing exactly the revelation of the
[1:20:49] Jesus Christ true the new world is born
[1:20:52] in there he injects his own life your
[1:20:54] life is gone and the life of Christ is
[1:20:56] put checked and so true you with the
[1:20:58] preeminence is to the people and they
[1:21:00] see the very life one works two signs
[1:21:03] wonders that he did is doing true you
[1:21:07] are you ready outside of that the rest
[1:21:11] of it is not even quantum at all outside
[1:21:14] attack we've just said it commences
[1:21:17] watch God's great revelation and fallen
[1:21:21] by lack of this revelation is why we
[1:21:25] have so many divisions among us so much
[1:21:28] mockery so much official among us is
[1:21:30] because the people like that revelation
[1:21:32] the revelation the teachers he say the
[1:21:35] teachers
[1:21:37] it is Jesus Christ Himself being
[1:21:39] revealed again
[1:21:40] isn't that right so Paul said I come
[1:21:44] among you and I talk about a Joris could
[1:21:46] with not really exited your speech but
[1:21:49] he came to you to testimony of God I
[1:21:51] come in weakness and fear much trembling
[1:21:53] and my preaching was not with enticing
[1:21:55] words of my wisdom but here we go
[1:21:57] in demonstration of the Spirit and power
[1:22:03] you see there is the gospel going into
[1:22:08] world and preach the gospel didn't say
[1:22:10] go teach so all this teaching please to
[1:22:12] positionally that is just part of it
[1:22:15] teaching place of positionally that you
[1:22:18] could have the fear to receive the
[1:22:19] spirit he didn't say go on teach he said
[1:22:25] go preach in other words here we go yet
[1:22:28] interpersonal demonstrate the power
[1:22:31] these signs shall follow just teaching
[1:22:34] doesn't do it it takes the actual spirit
[1:22:37] itself demonstrate and designs remember
[1:22:40] the clients not teaching teaching alone
[1:22:43] can't do it
[1:22:44] so all this teaching on teaching for
[1:22:46] hours teaching teaching three hours
[1:22:48] teach and teach and ten hours teaching
[1:22:50] teaching that alone can do it it will
[1:22:52] take the spirit or glory no thought and
[1:22:56] all you get in that no you're gonna cry
[1:22:58] that they would have pray forehead
[1:23:00] they're gonna fall and God forever
[1:23:02] you're gonna get in a spirit of it it
[1:23:05] will take the spirit it has to be a
[1:23:07] transitioning into the spirit realm in
[1:23:09] this message we are going nowhere the
[1:23:13] wrapped in intellectual thing if it not
[1:23:15] be so we should be in already if the
[1:23:18] rest of us books on the official I'll be
[1:23:19] long gone because we're all in this
[1:23:21] thing no oh gonna be great in this thing
[1:23:25] no oh

[1:23:28] power so you see when the power of this

[1:23:35] will bring the Brethren oh is it
[1:23:37] national force put the church and work
[1:23:39] of the churches but the power of God
