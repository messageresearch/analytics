special speech from the family by Gary mcmo so we want to invite him up to the stand to give us that speech when I came in and I there and I looked at the program I recall the program said a memorial for Michael right and I guess probably I made the one I only one here would have that experience to know him from way backward so you so you would have a long time here but and you see back then is black here he died when it was gray so check it out but anyhow um what I looked at you know in yeah what I looked at um in thinking of what I should see how to express it to you I thought of a burial the burial has gone it's gone one year already but what you're looking at you want to honor him in what he did what is life represented to you and to me I looked at it how he lived his life now in everyone's life there'd be good things there are things that we like to shout about the things we would not want to discuss right but and I look back and see you know you look things that you would not want to discuss and that is not new you will look back at in Psalm 25 you're going to see David say Lord don't remember the sin of my youth and I think we'd all know why don't remember it but it's what we did once we came to that point of knowing Christ our walk would have changed so I can look at it with Michael for you brother Mark however you call him once he came to that point of knowing Christ his life was changed forever and this is what I would focus on more so how it impacted you and I and many others as he went along there times had look back one thing you know as we look then as I look then we had lots of lots of discussions particularly in the early years when heed on his journey there and in those discussions many times you'd see to me Gary you have one foot in and one foot out and I would say that's okay my fet would both will be standing the same place at some time right and um years later you know I got him not the message that he's in but coming to know CH also and I had a discussion with him once and this is what I share with you here now you know just in that discussion then and we talking whatever it was and I gave an impression my thoughts on him and he said to me Gary you're you're on track but you know what you want to understand the Bible you want to understand God's love for you start again start from Genesis 1 and read continually read from 1: one to Revelation and you know over the years I begun doing it right and every time you read through it is more and more and more you can see what is what it's all about you can see how much God loves each one of us and this is what Michael was demonstrating in his life always that it's not so much about him it's about God in your life how much God loved each one of us all right and as time went on yes he had challenges sometimes you disagreed yes but when we disagreed we can sit we can talk and discuss we spent many many hours many many hours discussing issues challenges that he had and during those times me we went back long I'm in Toronto Canada he's in New York and probably we talk as often as possible but some of the longest conversations we have is when he bought he got his first computer and that was a big challenge for you and my wife had always I just can't understand how you could do this he be lying in your bed Michael called and he said Gary A B C D E and you can down and no do a do B look here you're going to see this do that do that and just work and you don't have a screen in front of you right and this was this was the sort of relationship that we had as we came but with that being so um I think big challenges where you saw his grace more and more is when he was at hospital he spent spent quite a while at hospital right and we travel often as often as you possibly can to be with rosan and the others there while she was at hospital and there were times when questions were asked why is he suffering what or whatever his mind was wavering not when I say wavering not in his faith but wavering in thought was sort of losing his memory the early Inception of um dementia and as that went on and questions are being asked I say what he's suffering I don't know I don't know what he's in pain I don't know I can't say he's in pain but what I can see is that God is with him where he is and God is bringing him through he may not be in pain but his life here on while he's on the bed here's what he's doing there to all those who attend to him nurses doctors or whoever he can be ministering to them even at that stage right and that is something I mean really I looked at doctors or the nurses some of them knew him and you know you joke with them and so but they understood yes there's something different about him when he could sing out at times just blast out a song praising God what I so so that is um that's you know the memory that he left behind with a lot of people out there and his walk wherever he went I recall in the early years just to jump back a bit the song was played by arita Franklin s arita Franklin song and that song is um give their life to Jesus and that I recall was the first I think that is 1974 75 Michael gave me a copy of that song give your life to Jesus and to me you know even though I walked outside I walked but the point is coming yes that happened give your life to Jesus and I think that for him to is when he gave his life to Jesus and he shared that with me all right so it's a song every time I hear it yes that's what he shared that's what he gave for us to follow where he'd be now I don't know but what I do know the scripture that was read early on when he started up in John 14 right you look down he stopped at three but if you go down further it's see they talked about um I go to prepare a pleas for you if it was not so I not tell you and you would know you can read the balance of that verse so I believe in all my that he has gone to the place God went to prepare for him his life is his life has left indelible marks on quite a number of people and you being here present it has left a mark on you it has left a mark on us as family members that's what I share with you amen amen that was wonderful now we have our precious Reverend Timothy redhead from all the way from Green here with us and he's going to come and share some word let's welcome him good after everyone greetings from the church in Grenada and my family I came to just share a little word with you but I thought I was just going to see brother Mar and then I saw my father and mother standing with him and I just lost all my steam but I still have my voice and I'll Just sh in memory of our daily departed brother Michael MCM who we have known for over 20 years we did share the same thing he was born September 2nd I was born September 3rd and whenever a bird came around he would call me or I would call him brother mcmo as he was affectionally called can best be described in three words he was sng in fate solid in perseverance and reliable in loyalty we spent many an hours together fellow both in Grenada and in New York in fact he had to come Grenada to to B on Grand speech with us and whenever I visit him we would spend many hours talking always about the Lord someone once asked me if you had to name someone who you look up to who would that be apart from our Lord Jesus Christ and I will have three names on my list first would be brother Brenham for his godsent messages then my dad for his unwavering stand for this message and the third would be brother M be brother M for his consistent Christian support to me both when I was in the world and after the Lord Jesus Christ brought me back to theform there are not many men left of his caliber but in Clos say God bless the day he came into our

Michael M so the first greeting testimony we have is from Carl Caesar from Georgia USA he said brother Michael was so much more than a friend to me he was my mentor Confidant closest brother prayer partner Health advisor family counselor so much more my understanding of the entire message of Malachi 4 was profound deepen by the dedicated and consecrated life that brother Michael lived before me how much we need more live voices like his to inspire the younger generation I feel truly blessed to have had someone like brother Michael in my life as a young man just starting my Christian Journey for many years especially when I first came to the Lord his family became like my adopted family I spent countless hours and weekends at their home and the love I experienced there was unparallel I will never forget how special mother mcmo made me feel she always reserved a little room for me creating a sanctuary where I could escape and find peace I loved her delicious food and the special cup of tea she just prepared just for me sister hosana and adanna you have always been so kind and genuine making me feel like I was part of the family these are Cherished Memories landmarks on my Christian Journey that I would never forget or take for granted brother Patrick Jones and I made every effort to fly to Trinidad but fortunately it isn't possible at this time we are however sending our prayers and love to you and the entire family whom we have come to love and appreciate deeply though we miss our brother dearly we hold fast to the promise that we will see him again and be reunited on the other side with our loved ones in the presence of the Lord there in his presence there'll be no more tears or parting only peace and joy may God continue to bless encourage and strengthen the entire family his grace is truly sufficient with love always brother Carl Caesar praise the Lord next testimony from brother Michael Blackman I first met brother Michael MCM affectionately called brother ma in 1982 when as a newly baptized member of pisp church I went to cyw along with the brothers to assist in painting of The Tabernacle and there is where he encountered uh he talk about account of his FY for the Lord even as a Catholic 1984 as part of the trainer contingent traveled to USA to attend the rapturing fate convention hosted by brother Dave m in Tulsa Oklahoma I was privileged to experience another facet of brother Max spiritual personality Our Guest the Tulsa required us to fly from Brooklyn to Texas and then drive overnight from Texas in a minibus with brother ma as a driver and Navigator in Texas we spent several hours resting and refreshing ourselves at the home of one of brother Ma's relatives but Ma had put together every aspect of this trip on behalf of the local contingent while we were yet in Trinidad apart from travel Arrangement this also included coordinating with the US team responsible for convention in Trinidad I had the Good Fortune to share a quadruple room with brother Mack and two other brothers descend the trend with brother Mack and me for the US convention following years and in one instance and pin Harris we room together through these various interactions but Ma and I grew deep bond and over the years no trip to the US by Me was complete without a visit to heon health store where I pick up my gallon of pure apple juice and consult with bar Mack on the latest Health Products that were available for purchase in all of this what shun through was b m complete and utter dedication to the ministering to the needs of the Saints both natural and spiritual a prime example was brother Ma's insistence on driving on relief for hours and in to and from conventions as well as carrying us visitors a shop and and and ssea on the spiritual time of of things I clearly remember one instant old night service in manah Hamry princess town when the pulpit was open for attending ministers to speak Inc coming to speak after a newly converted brother who was also started ministering with exuberance and very along legalistic lines but a mar in the spirit of maturity and yielding himself to the guidance of the Holy Spirit brought balance with this Spirit of wisdom and maturity brother Mar as a true Elder gently schooled all those present in the correct approach in dealing with the wife of the lamb as an elder he also became a counselor times to put my wife and me when we needed answers to various questions that besiege new Believers but the max Temperance was phenomenal one incident while we roomed together still stands out of my memory brother ma ask me to remove a tag from his jacket his new suit which we already DED at the time we were running a bit late and in my Hast I cut a small hole in the cuff of his new suit I could have seen the disappointment that immediately flashed across M Mar's face but just as quickly it was gone as he was more concerned about my anguish at the damage I had inadvertently caused to make matters worse I found out it was an expensive suit but a Max's genuine and effortless self-control in that situation has always been and continues to be an inspiration and guide when I find myself in situations similar situations but I'm ma an elder who left footprints in the sands of time an elder worthy of emulation brother Mike Blackman praise the Lord amen the third one is from CIA Charles it is easy to conceive it isn't easy to conceive a world without our precious brother Michael MCM he was in many ways a constant Staple in our lives but a ma was very still and steady never a bad word of conflict he was always kind generous gracious many of us were able to attend conventions abroad because of his Hospitality his willingness to host Us in his home and shuffer us to the destination year after year he served God's people with unwavering commitment but a would brother max if brother Max said he would collect you at 2: p.m. to head to P Harrisburg he would fetch you at 6:30 p.m. and while you would be stressed out and worried he would casually put your bags in the car and ask if you're ready to go very unbuttered but nobody could stay mad at brother MCM for long his heart and love for God's people is unsurpassed I wanted to remember him today for many years I worked alongside him at heon where he helped people improve their health with the same passion and fervor as he did helping people to cist I thank him for the confidence he placed in me to manage the local arm of the business and that all I learned from him and his kindness to me and my daughter hadassa May rest in peace and we will see him again in the morning sister cyia Charles the fourth testimony is here from uh the Ali family but mar mar Ali I first met brother mcmo when I was 12 years old he was the first person I heard preaching the gospel and he laid the foundation for the Kwal Church his work was later carried on by brother George and brother ID at that tender age I accepted Jesus as my savior and the baptized by Brother mcmo alongside a group of other believers to me he was like Moses a deliverer from the life I had known at 21 I married chat Ali it was brother mcmo who officiated our ceremony he was also our witness at the red house which where were where marriages were conducted in those days over the years he began traveling back and forth to the United States but his heart always remain with a little flucking cywell brother mcmo was a soldier in the army of God he seized every opportunity to share the gospel leading Conquest souls to Christ a man full of patience humility and simplicity he never sought recognition he was truly unique he was a frequent visitor to our home always sharing the word of God and encouraging us to remain steadfast in our faith his support for the Ali family was unwavering I remember that many times he prayed for us especially during illness and life trials where it was a tractor accident involved with my husband our estate being ravaged by bushfires or my son's head operation one memory that stands out during a period when I was battling depression and isolated myself from others but M came to Trinidad found us at our camp on the estate and prayed for us he encouraged us to rise above the situation and shared a yet a simple yet comforting meal of Bo casava with butter his love and guidance lifted us from that dark time I also remembered when Christmas when he spent the night in a humble home sleeping contentedly in a room made of mud and grass and a fiber mattress his Joy was contagious his presence made every occasion special especially our 25th wedding anniversary celebration my daughter's wedding and conest birdes and family gatherings he even encouraged my husband and me to travel the United States for the first time I always remember how much he enjoyed the fresh fruits coconut water from our land but mcmo had a way of leaving us with wise words and scripture such as seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all other things shall be added to you two pray without ceasing three giving thanks in the good times and the bad times and four love regardless brother you have finished your course you have run the race you have fought a good fight you have kept the Fai now you have received the crown of righteousness and eternal life your purpose on Earth has been fulfilled and accomplished the Ali family will always remember brother mcmo for his dedication to God's word he was a prara a worshipper a man after God's Own Heart of Pastor father a grandfather dear friend and a genuinely kind soul filled with God's love he was our Mentor a shining example of true Christianity and a man of the highest standards offering encouragement and support to all members of the kyell flock truly his life was a masterpiece thank you brother MMO for all you have done and for the person you were make your soul rest in peace praise the Lord amen the fifth one is some brother Michael fortune and he said Michael he's talking about Michael M his name is Michael for Michael would always be remembered in many Journeys kwell convention meetings brandham Tabernacle voice of God recording we shared together the outstanding ones being those kable Endeavors in the early days of the work dear the effort it would take in keeping and neutering the work was phenomenal sometimes when he did not have the use of the little car I would leave home and wait until he finished work and then we would journey to KY I will drop him off and continue to Manzanilla for the return Journey with to home today the work has grown from its bone in the fields of thunder in the Ragged Jagged Sky to tell the whole story would take hours of good conversations he was truly remarkable committed dedicated in his effort may he here well done my good and faithful servant enter into joys of the Lord Brother Michael Fortune praise the Lord amen and the sixth one is from Sister ingred Williams she said a true soldier of the cross a fisherman not fish of fish but of men a winner not of silver bronze or gold medals but of souls I was acquainted with him since I was a little girl as both my family and the mcmo family live at Mendoza Road Upper Belmont Valley Road in Belmont I never imagined or could have known that he would be my brother in Christ and even my employer in later years I remember remember when my dad was Ill B written back in 2004 brother Mack and brother teren over together with my husband visited to pray for Dad and as after they prayed brother ma stayed in the bedroom alone with Daddy I'm sure without a shadow of a doubt he spoke to my dad and led him to Christ a true fisher of men a winner of souls a selfless Christian gentleman full of patience he has indeed left behind a True Legacy I hereby give honor and salutations to the life he live sister ing Williams seventh one we have here some Terence ID greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to the mcmo family and all the saints gathered for this memorial service in honor of brother Michael mcmo it has been about an honor and a privilege to share a few words about the legacy of brother Michael mcmo a true soul of the cross of Jesus Christ while much can be said about his Christian testimony I want to highlight a significant part of his legacy one that I believe has remained largely Untold over the years in 198 to but the kman prophesied that the Holy Ghost would be outp poured in 1983 this prophecy was fulfilled in September and October in New York City where brother Michael MCM received the baptism of the Holy Ghost on Friday October 14th 1983 he returned to Trinidad that evening the Believers were gathered at brother Justin's Alexander home in Santa Cruz to watch a video of the Revival happening in New York City brother mcmo had attended a house dedication in ARA early that day with brother Hugh Williams and they arrived at brother Alexander's home around 1100 p.m. the living room was packed with Believers worshiping as the service was about to close but a MMO stood in the doorway facing the congregation he was asked to pray to to dismiss the service as he begin praying the Lord poured the Holy Ghost upon the Believers but a Hugh Williams who were standing on the porch next to brother mcmo was slain in the spirit and seal with the Holy Ghost the living room erupted with screams and shouts and the overwhelming anointing of God after the initial wave the power subsided but M boldly prayed Lord if this is you send back the power the Holy Ghost exploded in the room once again but he was slain on the power of God for a second time two days later on Sunday October 16th brother mcmo attended a service at Hillen Hall after brother Anon finished preaching the anointing of the holy spirit filled the entire building brother mcmo and brother n began laying hands on the Believers and when they lay hands on me the power of God overwhelmed me I fell to the floor on my back it was felt as though a hand with a knife was cutting into my heart I could feel my heart being torn apart my chest swell I clutch it with both hands the experience was both awesome and painful I cried out the top of my voice after about a minute it ended and profound peace and presence of God enveloped me I was no longer screaming instead I was speaking in tongues and many Believers received the Holy Ghost that morning when I emerg from this powerful experience I asked the Lord about it he revealed to me it was the circumcision of the Heart by the spirit as described in Romans 2:29 but he's a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God the Lord used brother Michael mcmo to spare the Holy Ghost Revival that swept across trinad in 1983 he left behind a tremendous Legacy of Love love and labor for God's people let us continue his work with the same Zeal and enthusiasm he demonstrated pursuing the seeds of God with unwavering dedication I believe the same holy spirit that was at p in 93 is here today ready to be outp poured a new it is prophesied the Dynamics of this church will include a fresh refilling of the Holy Spirit brother mcm's Legacy lives on May we honor it by carrying forward the fire of Revival and laboring for the kingdom of God as he did your brother in Christ but Terence over it and for the praise the Lord amen certainly appreciate all these testimonies the last testimonies number eight is from me and I these what I shared I Shar this a couple of years back and I felt let to bring it back again words cannot fully Express the inspiration and guidance that brother Michael Ministry has provided through the years I vividly remember our time in cywell and his remark able patience something we often joked about we would say he would impress job himself with his patience but loving care and attention he worked with a vision trusting that one day the work he started would continue by God's grace my Foundation as a young Christian and Minister goes back to kaiwa and even earlier to when I work with brother Michael's father at MCM and Sons TR through that experience I first encountered cywell which I felt like a formative backside of the desert moment the lessons I learned there have been the foundation of my Ministry but Michael taught me how to serve selflessly to Bear the burdens and concern of others from him I gain a passion for Trinidad and the Caribbean learning to navigate challenges with grit and determination the Wilderness of kwell shaped and prepared me for what was to come I am forever grateful to brother Michael for teaching me the value of working with one person at a time devoting full attention and care to each Soul so many of his qualities have left a lasting mark on me there aren't enough pages in this collection to express what brother Michael means to us one of his favorite phrases was you need to get rid of toxins you need cleansing in he was always right both naturally and spiritually and even if he sometime got lost on the way to pen Harris he always had that Romans 8:28 smile his home was a genuine welcome mat he split welcome into well welcome inviting multitudes over the years who felt at home in his presence his family graciously embraced his Spirit of hospitality prepared for countless guests friends and Believers as the years passed I saw his quiet maturity patience thoughtful influence shaped the lives of those around him I feel truly privileged to have met and known brother Michael it's remarkable that despite living in the USA for so many years he still makes time to visit Kwal the birthplace of The Headstone Tabernacle there the vision God give him for Trinidad and the cariban took root a seed that now bears fruit he have been a constant present like the North Star steadfast to the bride of Christ in Trinidad words fail to describe the impact of his connection New York and what it meant to us may God bless the MCM family may you be able to look around and see what the Lord Has Done Pastor ID and family God bless you amen and we want to say thank you again for all those testimonies truly we've been blessed and encouraged by all those kind words now we also have some special words from somebody who is very familiar as well brother George Kangley is going to bless us with some special words about our beloved brother Michael mcmo good day everyone special greetings to the MC Representatives I feel humbled you know to stand here after hearing all those well- written testimonies I started to write something and never really got completed so I try and bring out what I knew about brother Michael I first met brother Michael in the year 1974 he had um he had started to fellowship with a group we had in laven till where I was a member and he had recently returned from The Uso where he had been living and working for a few years he had worked I think he had been working with an architectural firm in New York City while there he used to attend a Bible Way Church who had known and practiced baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I believe the pastor there was huu Rogers but not long after he um returned to Trinidad he started keeping Street meetings in kwall a little village near s Grande off the road to manela members of the U lavendel group would accompany him on his Outreach to the the residence of kwall while on the way up he would rent a loudspeaker system and keep meetings at the side of the road in cwall used to hang it up was a horn you know those horns hang it up on a tree and preach at the side of the road these meetings resulted in um a few baptisms and we have a few members here Sister marn Sister Rosemary and I see sister Sanja Harry Paul well we knew her as Harry Paul she's missing something now I don't have this and she came all the way from Princess Tong to be here today all right not long after we had left the street after the baptisms and we went um keep meetings in a home which was the which was owned by brother Michael father's Uncle if I have it correct vicus so we started keeping meetings there and as time went on Michael had um constructed a wooden building where the regular regular Church meetings were held he was constantly moving between nework York and Trinidad and didn't see himself as a pastor suely responsible for the group in cywell he believed that he would be able to hand the work over to someone that the Lord would send at some time in 1975 while we were there in kall bar kman visited and held meetings in um shonas under the opes of brother dunar who but kman was the invited guest and took all the services and uh it wasn't long after I think later in the year that um some convention meetings were held in um I think it was in Fort Wayne Indiana and brother Michael left to attend these meetings and he he ended up staying there for about nine months fellowshipping in New York under the ministry of Brother Joseph keman before he returned one thing I want to say about brother Michael is his witnessing I don't think I ever met anybody who could witness one onone as by Michael he had that d p as you will say one another virtue he had was patience he I remember him telling me one time that he was fellowshipping in this group and the the minister asked how many would like to have the patience of Job so he said everybody raise their hand they would like to have the patience of Job so the minister asks how many would like to have the trials of job and he say he was the only one he was the only one to raise his hand and brother everybody talks about his patience but job's patience came through his Childs and where Michael had his trials he had his trials with his sickness down in his latter end and so on but his patience held out sometime I used to think as if Michael used to exist outside of time as if you know well time didn't matter once he could get that word to somebody once he could get to talk to somebody to witness to somebody it didn't matter time or place doesn't matter what over it was but he would you know he was Z and that he was um he was friends to brother redhead here in Grenada and he had a brother in um Canada brother Luke Clyde Luke they were friends and he will visit their churches from time to time doing um convention meetings when we would attend to Convention meetings that brother Coleman held in Pennsylvania there will be brothers from as you heard from Trinidad visiting and would be we had brothers from Nigeria brother ULU and these brothers would come up and in those days they would stay about Michael's place to be sleeping on the floor think preparing for convention you know and what could I say what more could I say well Michael is the person you heard about witnessing that people spoke about earlier and uh it's just my um unfinished testimony of my fellowship with by Michael my knowledge of him my going about with him to keep meetings in kyell and so on and I think I'll cut off here God bless you all God bless you yeah we thank you so much brother Kangley we appreciate that so much we want to invite sister geneville to to render that special to us the anchor holes greetings to everyone God bless you special greetings to the family [Music] I have journey through a long time night oh no the open se

one to the next we know that this race going to finish one day be with us and strengthen us as we approach your word for a few moments in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you I want to turn to two portion of scriptures eastes chapter 3 want to read verse 1 to8 and eases 9 just one verse there verse 11 Ecclesiastes chapter 3:1 to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under Heaven time to be born a time to die a time to plant time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill time to heal a time to break down time to build up a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn a time to dance a time to Cast Away Stones a time to gather Stones together time to embrace a time to refrain from embracing a time to get a time to lose a time to keep time to Cast Away a time to Rend a time to SW time to keep silence time to speak a time to love and a time to hate time of war and a time of Peace Ecclesiastes chapter 9:1 says I returned and saw Under the Sun that the race is not to the Swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to Men of understanding nor yet favor to Men of skill but time and chance happen to them all may be seated God bless you may God bless his word Psalms 90 is a a Psalm that I love verse 9 says for all our days are passed away in thra we spend our years as a tale that is told the days our years are three score years and 10 which is 70 and if by reason of strength there be four score years Years yet is their strength labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away who knoweth the power of thine anger even to thy fear so is thy rra so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts to wisdom forther thought I have is a season and time to every purpose and I have an inspiration time was given to fulfill purpose that is the reason God give you time so if you don't know your purpose what will you fulfill but Ma had a purpose and he had a certain time to fulfill that to make sure the work is done Jesus had a purpose and when he died at the cross he said it is finished Paul said it this way I run I finished my course I've run my race there are too too much people live without purpose without purpose you have no Focus time was given to fulfill purpose when you miss your purpose you waste your time you waste your time your time is taken up with other things not connected to your purpose you know know I I came to the Lord I was in jundi doing electronic electrical engineering technician I wanted to be a medical doctor but a family was not positioned to for me to advance to that level so I went to do uh and in doing that I might have be a head of T and Tech Fall you know but then I give my heart to the Lord and I dropped out God knows why after one year doing quite well and then my family was furious and I can't remember exactly when I encounter Michael mcmo but then I had to get a job because you can't leave school and then come back home and sit in your mother house not in those times you had to get work had to get a job so I was blessed and privileged to work with MCM Sons for a while and that's getting know brother Michael and then that's how kwell came into for me let's go you waste your time and your time is taken up with other things not connected to your purpose then you feel unfulfilled true fulfillment comes from doing the will of God success doesn't bear a record of God you got have money car Boat Land house helicopter and plane that doesn't show that that is God's success the spirit is bear witness of God and when people not fulfilled they do crazy stuff they paint the house red they get a bigger house a bigger car because they competed with the neighbor the family the brothers and friends and whatnot there's something something lacking on the inside so you feel that you have to do this you feel for tension you feel and I think it was I think it was uh Mar Ali's testimony about brother Michael he wasn't trying to impress nobody he wasn't trying to impress anyone he was just winning souls and I have met countless people in New York and different places where they say it's brother Michael who want him to the Lord the brother Michael War him the Lord I remember time I I to give testimony about that a time I was driving he tell me stop here and and hold on behind the wheel because he going in some Subway to to to get somebody to carry them to service and whatnot and I behind the wheel they hold in the car there and I don't know where I'm at if east west north or south I don't know where faing more Direction I New York sitting down there some police coming and police come and say move move and I am furious cuz I don't know where I'm at and he was say 5 minutes 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes and I don't know if to go left right turn and I had to make a arounds when I do so he come normal smile you know is already you could be fussing you could be with normal smile like if nothing happen like if it's two minutes and he said the person didn't come that is that is on top of that then but that's what the kind of person he will go all out for a soul I think somebody said brother George say you have never seen anybody like that up to now I haven't seen anybody like that God help us to get something like that a burden for Souls amen that you could be concerned I Brother Gary said brother Mar share this testimony that's what when you get lit when he got lit he Shar it with his brother that's that that what we talking about when you really get lit up you could share your testimony you're not ashamed of the Gospel oh praise the name of the Lord praise God so when you do is will you feel fulfilled Our Lives will be the fruit of how we manage time and change listen carefully we cannot change time or influence time you can't ask time to hold on and wait until you know who you are time just rules on time respects no man or woman neither can we change time this physical body here is a body called time time is a kink in eternity time is a aberration or a little break in eternity and when this time is over we go back to Eternity hallu so brother Mar and all of us God put us in a body called time and one day this will be over so I wanted that picture I wanted a young picture of him to show what he going back to not the old man that you see died and going on no this man here and there's a picture Sim and like he's 29 years old that is what we talking about now because we not going to have gray hair across there and missing teeth and missing this and list that that is not we're going back to the original how we were supposed to be as Sons and Daughters of God so he'll be back young again he's going to pick up his body and back young again isn't that right so God make me to know my end and measure of my days what it is that I might know how frail I am like Psalms 39 time breaks the idea or thought of your state is permanent time show shows you that you can change from sinner to Saint our life your life is measured by time years months weeks days within time you get Seasons God plac Us in time to fulfill our purpose and that's why I read a time to be born and as soon as that time hit you you have a time to die I know some of you feel you're living forever but that not what the Bible say you know a time to be born and born time to die so as soon as birth hit have a de you see how the amens disappear amen get light once you go down there you go born yeah you're born but you have to fulfill stuff within time sometime people time run out sometime because of behavior people God cut them off before time say die too soon God cut them off God judged them that same time we talking about body so therefore everything have a season and a time so under time you get season spring winter summer and whatnot so in in in winter time all the leaves are off the tree so if you come and my season now is winter you laugh at me say look at him you no leaves St like that you look in her eyes you're looking like nothing working out but the season yeah check the right season yet come back in the spring check me back in the season of spring time and you will see green life and you see things pushing out and so so sometime you may catch me in a low time in a different kind of season but wait my season coming your season coming tell the devil is a liar because you have a season and time to every purpose under Heaven there's a seasonal time you can't wait you can't you can't force God's hand he said at the time appointed I will R return to you according to the time of life your breakthrough have a season your deliverance have a season in your financial breakthrough of a season whatever you are think in other words your state is not permanent your depression is not permanent your frustration is not permanent your anguish and pain and suffering is not permanent it's only for a Time Oh Glory to God time have an ending because time had a beginning oh I feel to preach this night Hallelujah did you get that time had a beginning therefore time had an ending everything had a beginning had an ending so as jealousy had a beginning it have an ending Envy have a beginning it have an ending but love had no oh give the Lord a praise Oh Glory to God love had no beginning therefore you can't kill love you can't stop love God so loved the world he come down to redeem you that you could come to repentance and get right with god oh give the Lord some Praises every purpose has a time to fulfill its reason for being so time was created to fulfill purpose you were born to fulfill purpose time is not waiting for you to get a revelation of your purpose time manifests itself is Seasons seasons change with time amen so our lives are not measured by our age but by what purpose we are fulfilled it's not how long we are in a message it is what we have done with the message I won't be long I have five pages and our page two already so you know we close time gives us opportunities today is the first day of the rest of your life time gives you the opportunity to to be changed to be transformed we spend our years as a tale that is told there's a time there's a funeral going on and people started talk about the Man in the Box and talk and talk and somebody get up from the congregation and went to look in the box to see if they write funeral because who they know in that box and what they're saying about that man is two different things so they wanted to make sure they in the right funeral but what you hear today with the different testimonies you know what you see what you hear is in harmony everybody can take the same testimony concerning this brother called Michael MC is that something we spend our years the tail of this toll sometime I wonder about that you know if I kick the bucket what people will say about me look at the testimonies a tail that is told look at the tale that's being told I could tell you that this church here is the fruit of a SE seed that's planted in Kaiba and brother ma lived long enough to see the fruit of his labor so go brother Mar can't be a good seed and he pass the B on to a bad seed something wrong God doesn't work so the only reason we are here is because God have a purpose for us being here there is going to be a BRI Revival there's going to be a super Church there's going to be signs ones and Miracles more importantly they in the grave have to come forth and they without us are not made perfect so there's got to be a people come to Perfection he long for Unity he's always talk about that uniting and uniting when you talk about that talk people not interested in that always talk about unity and I made a pledge to love the Brethren people will smile with me and have a dagger behind the back I don't watch the dagger you know I Smile Back people walking with daggers and God bless you and he big night God bless you you and that daggers there people like that but I pled to love them regardless of what they think and what they feel because God raised me for a purpose not to please everybody I remember when I going KYW but said we're supposed to start five start seven you know has because he pick up this one pick up that one pick up pick up everybody when I came there and take over I said listen I ain't picking up nobody but Geor me laughing I didn't know ask them they rise your Witnesses I say you better be here when I come because I have no car I'm traveling and I'm walking in how much miles are going to go up the hill to pump and what that I remember when I come up there three people to preach to but Joseph I didn't stay home you come quite here from Belmont to to preach of two people I say when you repent go go forgive you the next day he repent because you see it wasn't about the people it was about the mission and this were a lot of ministers a lot of preachers they don't even understand what it is to be the backside desert or you know people opening car holding a briefcase for them and the Bible and all them kind of modern thing they don't know about the fields they don't know about the grit and grind they don't even know about winning Souls they're looking for tee people from the next Church sheep rustling prolighting they know what witnessing some of them went one Soul or they looking at they eye long long looking to see what a man have and how they could take it I I want to finish I let finish on page three we spend our years is a tale told time is like currency you can spend it you can waste it you could abuse it some people use their time wisely others foolishly what are you doing with your time time is not waiting on you God places Us in time to fulfill purpose therefore we need to know our purpose what am I here for to do it's either you are done which is you fulfill your purpose like brother Michael or you are doing it or you are you got to do it it is done to do or doing either right now you are working in your purpose I right now you are done your purpose if you done your purpose time for God to take you home because your work on Earth is done so God could take you off your usefulness is no longer applicable to God or his people I told him already I'm not com here with no cloak stick behind the pit I'm not come here with that I ain't coming like that because I believe that you have to be useful to God into his people God tell David go your way with your fathers go and sleep God tell Daniel go thy way go and sleep your time is not yet but you have to know you have truly fulfilled the purpose that God raised you up for do you know your purpose almost done Matthew 25 the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man traveling to a far country and he give one five talents we know the story five talents other he give two the other he give one after a long time the Lord of those servants cometh and and reckon with them so he that received five talents came and brought other five talents said Lord they give me five or five more he said well done now good and faithful servant that has been faithful in few things I make you rule over many things he that received two brought two he said well done good and faithful servant and so on he received one Talent came and said Lord he the testimony I knew thee that thou a hard man reaping where thou was not sown guarding where thou was not St I was afraid I went and hid thy talent in the earth L there thou Hast that is nine his Lord answered him thou Wicked and sful servant th un profitability you know if you don't produce and add to what God give you over time time he see you as wicked you know and he's supposed to see it as wicked not your killing time and just dear dear dear no God nothing in subtraction business and division business God and the multiplication and the addition it blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying and multiply thee God is the adding business so God give Baka seed and say so that and then in time time going unfold and you will see the revelation of that seed that was planted oh blessed be the name of the Lord listen to this now he said the Lord answered thou Wicked slothful servant th newest that I reap i s not and gather and you know the kind of man that I am and you bury the money why didn't put in the bank and guess some interest on it he said thou oughtest to have put my money in the exchanges and then at my coming I should have received my own with Usery take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him that had 10 talents now hear this bum for everyone that had shall be given he that and he shall have an abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even what he had I'm almost finished there are four primary Seasons spring summer autumn winter we no about that but listen to this part Perfection lets patience have a perfect work that it may be perfect and entire lacking nothing God's will for us is perfection that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God that is where time comes in now you know what we preach nobody has gotten cored by blessings note is almost like the more blessings and money and well people have is the more slacker it becomes the more loose they become they start to look gamble games because they have no burden for money they have no B they have everything already they don't have to ask God they they have money they're sick go to the doctor right but when we talking about character this is where tests trials pain suffering comes because you get character through suffering character is not a gift God doesn't gift you with character you change and you transform and you become characterized like him through stuff that you go through or give the Lord some praise to somebody so waiting on God and waiting for God that is where time comes in waiting on and waiting for on and for you're waiting on God to get clearance to do what you think or feel God want you to do now if you don't have the time and the patience you run ahead you get burned and that is where I get burned to learn time waiting is the means by which this process of character development takes place this is the process of character development how highly God commment his Saints in the Dark Ages patience that the lamb is went to the slaughter so God stands in eternity and speaks into time like a book the novel we talk about you could have a novel you have past present future in the book you're reading it but you are outside the book so you could go to the Past you could go to the Future you could go to the presents in the book so just like that God could look into your life and intervene in your life he could speak into your life and that changed everything in other words you could be transformed change everything could change for you today by your attitude amen praise God time is common to everyone 24 hours what you are what you become depends upon how you use that time you could live in Facebook or you could live in your knees in prayer you could live in social media or you could seek God for yourself that is your choice you can't stop time but you can manage time how time is used you can do with time but what you want to do with it life is defined by time life is measured I call it three score and 10 which is 7 life is determined by time time is temporary oh praise God Timothy 4 2 Timothy 4 said I fought a good fight I'll finished my course I've kept the faith Ty time I lifetime I I love time you know I like when somebody ask me to speak for 10 minutes I speak for eight minutes and get them 2 minutes change I like time because time give you no time to waste words if you know you have to speak for 10 minutes then you can't just talk and talk about Mor and long water and how D you know just dragging things along and Rebecca riding the camel to go and see Isaac and you're just going you can't you can't go there you have to choose your words because it's in time about to close time when can and Abel was born children they playing and whatnot the Bible says in the process of time God say offer up present an offering Cain offer something Abel offer something and God blessed Abel and Cain was angry and upset time only time reveals jealousy time reveals lies from truth time reveals True Believers from false Believers from Hypocrites God's burden is to get man to repentance God's burden is to reveal himself to reveal himself to you because somebody testified to you praise God you have to come into this selfless life having a heart for others especially they who are lost you know we talk about brother ma spending time with people you know that was a sacrifice to him you may not have seen that like we say sometime people like freting freting freting but somebody paying for it what you think is free to you somebody pay for it I get free really it it cost something when brother Mar spend time with this one and that one it cost him something you in not seal Mar blessed me and he was with me and so yes but it cost him time his time he can be do other things but he choose to spend time with you that's what God is doing I'm done God used someone to reach out to you someone testify to you and the Holy Ghost used that testimony to steal your heart to wo you to draw you and here you are who's going to tell them that Jesus loves them who's going to tell them there's a better way who's going to want them of the things coming on them so God can turn their night in [Music] today who's going to tell them that Jesus loves them who's going to tell
