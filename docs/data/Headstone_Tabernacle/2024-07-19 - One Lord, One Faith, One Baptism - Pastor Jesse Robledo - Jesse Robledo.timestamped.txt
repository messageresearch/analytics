[39:32] roblo from New York uh brother y will
[39:36] come and bring a greeting and bless you
[39:38] I want to read a
[39:40] scripture uh you can have your seats
[39:42] from 1 Corinthians chapter
[39:44] 1 verse 22 says for the Jews require
[39:48] sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom
[39:51] but we preach Christ crucified under the
[39:53] Jews as stumbling block unto the Greeks
[39:56] foolishness but unto them which are
[39:58] called both Jews and Greeks Christ the
[40:01] power of God and the wisdom of God
[40:03] because the foolishness of God is wiser
[40:05] than men and the weakness of God is
[40:08] stronger than men for you see your
[40:10] calling Brethren listen how that not
[40:14] many wise men after the flesh not many
[40:17] mighty not many noble are called but God
[40:21] had chosen the foolish things of the
[40:23] world to confound the wise God had
[40:26] chosen the weak things of of the world
[40:28] to confound the things which are Mighty
[40:30] and the Bas things of the world and
[40:33] things which are despised had God chosen
[40:36] ye and things which are not to bring to
[40:39] not things that are purpose that no
[40:42] flesh should
[40:44] glory in his
[40:47] presence so God is in this overthrowing
[40:51] of the flesh King that no flesh will
[40:53] glory in his presence and one more
[40:55] scripture 2 Corinthians 5:16 says
[40:57] wherefore henceforth know we no man
[41:00] after the flesh ye though we have known
[41:03] Christ after the flesh yet now
[41:04] henceforth know we him no more so the
[41:07] high calling for us is to know no man
[41:11] after the flesh because Satan's spirit
[41:13] is really the
[41:15] church and the bride spirit is really
[41:18] the word okay amen praise be to Nick
[41:22] Jesus amen so therefore the enemy is
[41:24] really the human mind reason like
[41:26] brother Stephan is talking about uh this
[41:28] morning but God's spirit want you is
[41:30] another realm and God want to break you
[41:32] and I in another realm so we come to get
[41:35] into The Graces of God that God could
[41:37] bless us isn't that right so tonight
[41:40] praise God we want to invite our brother

[41:44] Grace how sweet the song is the grace of
[41:46] God friends that we in this end time
[41:49] message is the grace of God and that's
[41:51] why when we don't give God praise God
[41:54] have a problem with that because Satan
[41:56] wanted Glory Satan wanted praise when we
[41:59] come we come to worship Him in spirit
[42:01] and Truth Jesus said we know what we
[42:03] worship we know why we worship we know

[44:35] God's grace Hallelujah so I'll just read
[44:39] a portion of scripture familiar
[44:41] scripture to the bride in this end time
[44:43] Malachi chapter 4 it says for behold the
[44:46] day cometh that shall burn as an oven
[44:47] and all the proud day all that do
[44:49] wickedly shall be stubbled and the day
[44:51] that cometh shall burn them up said the
[44:53] Lord of hosts and it shall leave them
[44:55] neither root nor Branch but unto you you
[44:57] that fear my name shall the son of
[44:59] righteousness arise with healing in his
[45:01] wings and he shall go forth and grow as
[45:04] the calves of the stall and ye shall
[45:06] tread down the wicked and for they shall
[45:08] be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in
[45:10] the day that I shall do this said the
[45:12] Lord so we know that is future
[45:14] Hallelujah remember ye the law of Moses
[45:17] my servant which I commanded unto him in
[45:18] Horeb and for all Israel with the
[45:21] statutes and judgments behold I will
[45:23] send
[45:24] Elijah hallu this is our our Elijah the
[45:29] prophet before the coming of the great
[45:32] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[45:34] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[45:36] the children and the hearts of the
[45:37] children to their fathers least I come
[45:39] and smite the Earth with a curse may the
[45:42] Lord Jesus add His blessings to the
[45:43] reading of his word you may be seated
[45:45] thanks to brother Tio for giving us the
[45:48] opportunity brother Isaac to be here
[45:50] with you all this afternoon and you know
[45:52] I just want to look at this bride here
[45:54] in this end time uh under this Elijah's
[45:58] Ministry because uh we saw Elijah
[46:01] stepped into the Bible uh on in a time
[46:05] where Ahab was on the throne and he got
[46:08] married to this woman called Jezebel of
[46:10] which we know that Union wasn't the way
[46:13] that uh God's thoughts was never
[46:16] unbeliever should marry a Believer under
[46:19] no circumstance and here it is we saw
[46:22] this woman whose father was a murderer
[46:24] who got the thron by murder entered into
[46:27] this Kingdom through marriage and as
[46:29] soon as she came in idolatry began in
[46:34] Israel
[46:37] Hallelujah it was in a moment like that
[46:40] in the Pinnacle of their idolatry that
[46:42] God sent
[46:43] Elijah we don't know where he came from
[46:45] we don't know his father his mother a
[46:47] man in camel skin and he came with th
[46:50] said the Lord and Elijah's message
[46:53] brother he had power over n he had power
[46:56] to shut the Heavens that it rained not
[46:58] in the day of his prophecy no one could
[47:00] stop him no one could stop his word he
[47:02] had the word of the Lord For That season
[47:05] now when Elijah performed that prophecy
[47:08] there and he stopped up the heaven that
[47:09] was for a reason God had a people in
[47:12] mind he had a bride in mind in that day
[47:15] it's the same thing God sent us Elijah
[47:17] in this hour and it's for a reason he
[47:20] has you on his mind if you would notice
[47:22] after God sent Elijah in the provided
[47:25] place and give R him to feed him brother
[47:28] God was ordaining God had ordained a
[47:31] widow woman when the farming started her
[47:34] Barrel was full God didn't sent Elijah
[47:37] to her at that time he wait till the
[47:39] barrel reached to the bottom Hallelujah
[47:42] because Faith had to be expressed
[47:45] Hallelujah she had to be a replica of
[47:48] who he is her message was sent for her
[47:52] Hallelujah so this bride is caught under
[47:54] the
[47:55] tple Hallelujah we are rainbow CHS in
[47:58] this hour when the the angel was given
[48:01] the Prophet The Vision with the third
[48:03] pull it wasn't uh sardine
[48:07] or it was rainbow CH and to catch that
[48:10] you had to go way out first pull is okay
[48:14] second is okay but we want Hallelujah
[48:18] the inside chamber Hallelujah where the
[48:20] glories never fail so that woman when
[48:24] the barrel reach to the bottom is when
[48:26] he came to
[48:28] her Hallelujah so the supernatural was
[48:32] manifest between her and Elijah on a
[48:34] daily basis she knew the mixture between
[48:37] the oil and the meal the Holy Spirit and
[48:39] the word and she know how to put it on
[48:42] the cross Hallelujah to preserve life in
[48:45] this hour now when that took place in
[48:48] Elijah's day it was a constant
[48:51] Supernatural when Elijah left that house
[48:55] brother he went to mount carel
[48:57] for The Showdown we know OB and the
[48:59] whole story but the the climax of that
[49:03] period of plague upon the Earth ended in
[49:06] a
[49:07] showdown God's thoughts was to elevate
[49:10] his Prophet Hallelujah if you can't
[49:13] receive who I send you can't receive me
[49:16] so at the end on The Showdown on the
[49:18] mountain Elijah after he reped all the
[49:20] Altar and we understand everything he
[49:22] said Lord let them know that I've done
[49:24] this at your command Hallelujah so God
[49:27] show him something he walked into the
[49:29] vision and the fire
[49:33] fell there wasn't a custom with fire
[49:36] Hallelujah the be worship cannot produce
[49:39] the fire we have here
[49:41] hallelujah glory be to God in here the
[49:44] fire consumed the sacrifice and the
[49:46] people cried the Lord he is
[49:49] Goden he said if God is God then we had
[49:52] to get rid of these false prophets they
[49:54] took them down to the brook and they
[49:56] slay them Hallelujah by the Brook great
[49:59] things take place Hallelujah but what I
[50:02] want you to see is that in the midst of
[50:04] all of that the people turn back to God
[50:06] that got Jezebel angry that's right
[50:11] before she was married but she didn't do
[50:13] anything when that took place she got
[50:16] angry and you know what Jezebel did she
[50:19] said I'm going to kill Elijah she came
[50:21] against the servant and brother if woman
[50:24] don't get you popularity brother of the
[50:28] government Hallelujah tax case start you
[50:32] had to be on the run but God waiting for
[50:34] him in a cave to give him a
[50:37] commission
[50:43] Hallelujah that took place Jezebel came
[50:46] on the scene we started to hear a
[50:48] voice what took place after that is that
[50:52] there was a brother in Elijah's days
[50:55] called nebot and nebot had a Vineyard he
[50:59] had an inheritance he searched his name
[51:01] on the abstract and he realized he was
[51:04] connected to death before the foundation
[51:05] of the world Hallelujah he stood for a
[51:08] certain faith and Jezebel was the one to
[51:11] organize the slaying the to matter
[51:14] neighor
[51:16] Hallelujah so she came after the
[51:19] messenger first and then she came after
[51:21] his bride Hallelujah but the scripture
[51:24] said touch not my un anointed and do my
[51:27] prophets no when she came against the
[51:30] bride
[51:31] Hallelujah that moved the hand of God
[51:34] she wasn't judged God's thoughts towards
[51:36] her wasn't expressed until she touched
[51:39] his bride Hallelujah so when Ahab went
[51:43] down to possess the vineyard of nebot
[51:46] the eagle came down
[51:50] Hallelujah he's watching over us the
[51:53] eagle came down brother and he
[51:55] prophesied Judgment of on that
[51:57] hallelujah what is that Revelation 18
[52:00] the Earth was lighted with his glory he
[52:02] came down and he said
[52:04] Babylon the great is
[52:06] Fallen isn't that right there's one
[52:09] Prophet that did that in our day that
[52:12] was elishah before the coming of the
[52:14] great and terrible day of the Lord and
[52:17] He pronounced judgment on that
[52:19] sister and you know what took place when
[52:22] Elijah pronounced the Judgment she
[52:24] didn't die then you know Elijah went up
[52:27] into the Chariot of
[52:29] fire and she
[52:31] remained but as under the ministry after
[52:35] Elijah the Judgment came Hallelujah the
[52:39] bride under her messenger is the final
[52:41] voice to the final
[52:43] age so if you notice Revelation 18
[52:47] another Mighty angel came down the Earth
[52:49] was lighted with his glory and then he
[52:51] start to call a Bride
[52:53] outall come out not of him
[52:57] Hallelujah Babylon will normally rulle
[52:59] by men yeah Nero and all of them Roman
[53:02] so that whole system it really move to a
[53:04] woman dominating which the woman is on
[53:07] display on the end time here woman show
[53:10] us the church it show us where we are
[53:12] when God wanted to show the prophet hell
[53:14] he show him a woman souls in prison is
[53:16] woman when you want to show him beyond
[53:18] the curtain of time it's woman
[53:20] Hallelujah so woman show us where we
[53:22] are come out not of him but come out of
[53:25] her
[53:27] my people hallelujah so there's a bride
[53:30] that came out of that system under
[53:32] Elijah's
[53:34] Ministry and if you notice when God was
[53:37] ready to judge that system because that
[53:39] system is what is coming against us that
[53:41] system is what will close meetings like
[53:43] these but when God was ready to judge
[53:46] that system he had a man called
[53:49] ju
[53:51] Hallelujah glory be to
[53:54] God J didn't come on foot
[53:58] but J came and a
[54:01] horseback yeah glory be to
[54:05] God that's Revelation
[54:08] 19 because Heavens was open and we
[54:12] saw armies coming down is someone on a
[54:16] horseback to declare judgment upon that
[54:19] wh Rejoice over her when ju came to the
[54:24] wall you had some Uno inside
[54:27] Jezebel paint up her face she put her
[54:29] head out the
[54:30] window that could not that couldn't stop
[54:33] the wrath of God God came to avenge the
[54:36] blood God watched through seven Church
[54:39] ages he watched all the Dark Ages he
[54:41] watched all the pollution Tarion and all
[54:44] that came true God was about to
[54:45] pronounce judgment upon that Hallelujah
[54:48] he said who is on my side you had some
[54:51] Uno up there the scripture show us there
[54:53] are some dictators that once give their
[54:56] power to the beast but in that moment
[54:58] they will turn on her and those
[55:00] dictators show off the
[55:02] wall in one hour she came to
[55:05] not Hallelujah so Saints we not living
[55:09] for this world we living for the
[55:11] Beyond Hallelujah in one hour she came
[55:15] to not and you know what the scripture
[55:16] said ju trampled upon her with the horse
[55:21] so brother we the righteous will walk
[55:24] out on the ashes of the wicked
[55:28] Hallelujah isn't that right to enter
[55:31] into the seventh day but the seventh day
[55:34] is not all there is a climax in the 8
[55:37] day Hallelujah when that City comes down
[55:41] brother and that bride stands in a as
[55:43] she sees that City come down Hallelujah
[55:46] 12 Foundation the 12 gates and the glory
[55:49] of that City the lamb is the light
[55:51] earth that is who we are in this hour
[55:54] Heaven and Earth will hug and kiss
[55:56] something will break from that Dimension
[55:58] into this Dimension he say I go to
[56:00] prepare a place for you that city is in
[56:02] prepare preparation now and one day
[56:05] these eyes will see it the Believers
[56:08] from over on the next side one day God
[56:10] will clear the fog and these eyes will
[56:13] become Supernatural and we will see them
[56:16] Hallelujah just as we see them they'll
[56:18] see us we will be in that City so since
[56:21] we in the last day it's a terrible time
[56:23] we're under Elijah's Ministry we know
[56:25] who we are yeah God is bringing judgment
[56:27] on that system but while he's bringing
[56:29] judgment on that system there is a bride
[56:31] here in this hour that is preparing to
[56:33] leave
[56:35] here this is who we are in this hour

[1:26:09] the
[1:26:11] building this is different you
[1:26:14] know I believe that God is fixing to
[1:26:17] move in such a special
[1:26:20] way many of you who have the Holy Ghost
[1:26:25] who are seeking the Holy
[1:26:27] Ghost this is your
[1:26:31] time I was praying and I told Brother uh
[1:26:38] stepanus uh by the way how many
[1:26:41] appreciate his message this morning that
[1:26:43] was a
[1:26:51] masterpiece a real masterpiece
[1:26:55] and uh I personally have have not heard
[1:26:59] brother stephanus preach an entire
[1:27:01] message and I was so blessed I told him
[1:27:04] his dad would be very proud of him amen
[1:27:09] a chip off the O Block amen praise be to
[1:27:14] God Amen so once again I appreciate uh
[1:27:19] being here and for the invitation that
[1:27:22] our precious brother ID invited me and I
[1:27:24] appreciate all the ministers that have
[1:27:26] come and have
[1:27:28] testified
[1:27:30] uh uh I am so blessed with every
[1:27:33] testimony that has come
[1:27:35] forth
[1:27:37] um
[1:27:38] we are here for a purpose we have an
[1:27:42] appointment with the
[1:27:44] supernatural amen and uh I have seen the
[1:27:48] Lord do many wonderful things glory
[1:27:50] glory and I want to uh specifically the
[1:27:54] morning I heard from Ali Shan sham sham
[1:27:59] sham and he struck something that uh
[1:28:02] touch my heart and I'll have you sit
[1:28:05] down in a
[1:28:06] moment about
[1:28:11] humility it really really spoke to my
[1:28:14] heart because I
[1:28:18] think that is the
[1:28:21] key we want anything from God we have to
[1:28:24] Humble
[1:28:28] ourselves we have forgotten how to be
[1:28:33] humble and by the grace of God we're
[1:28:35] going to get back to that
[1:28:39] place see because if we lift ourselves
[1:28:42] up he cannot be lifted
[1:28:44] up
[1:28:46] amen we have got to get ourselves out of
[1:28:50] the way so he can do his business
[1:28:55] we cannot do his
[1:28:57] business we have got to get out of his
[1:29:00] way so he can do his business amen so I
[1:29:04] want to uh thank uh him for that
[1:29:08] testimony and uh I believe with all my
[1:29:11] heart that God is fixing to do something
[1:29:14] very special for each and one may God
[1:29:17] bless the family the church and everyone
[1:29:19] that is here amen I can't remember all
[1:29:22] the names I'm getting a little older
[1:29:24] and uh so
[1:29:28] I I remember a lot of
[1:29:31] things but uh the thing is that
[1:29:35] um as I as the brother was saying this
[1:29:39] morning Faith does not get
[1:29:42] old Faith doesn't get old
[1:29:46] huh what did Caleb say I am as strong
[1:29:51] today his faith was as strong today as
[1:29:56] it was when Moses s to him and my faith
[1:30:00] is as strong today as the day that Moses
[1:30:04] sent uh you know we have these promises
[1:30:08] that we are so
[1:30:11] um fond of not only fond of but we are
[1:30:15] looking for the manifestation of certain
[1:30:18] promises and we must keep our eyes on
[1:30:21] the prize if we do not then the devil
[1:30:25] will make sure that we uh we lose sight
[1:30:28] of them so I had I was telling brother
[1:30:32] stephanus this this morning that I had
[1:30:35] uh or rather this afternoon I had a
[1:30:37] little message that I brought with me
[1:30:39] but then uh early this morning the Lord
[1:30:43] woke me up and
[1:30:45] changed uh my
[1:30:48] message and um and I'm speaking on a
[1:30:52] subject that I have spoken on for
[1:30:55] years and that is the importance of the
[1:30:57] Holy
[1:30:59] Ghost without the Holy Ghost the church
[1:31:01] cannot
[1:31:04] live without the holy ghost that I'm I'm
[1:31:07] not I'm not talking about
[1:31:10] Pentecost I'm talking about a genuine
[1:31:15] experience in the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:18] Ghost that keeps you
[1:31:22] alive the Holy Ghost is the life of the
[1:31:25] church the Holy Ghost is the blood in
[1:31:28] the church you take the blood out of a
[1:31:31] man he dies you take the holy ghost out
[1:31:34] of the church it
[1:31:37] dies amen and we're contending for that
[1:31:41] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:31:44] Saints amen hallelujah and if it was a
[1:31:48] theme of every Apostle it has got to be
[1:31:52] our theme also
[1:31:55] Amen Hallelujah to the lamb God bless
[1:31:59] you I will turn now if you would I don't
[1:32:02] want to keep you too long I know uh
[1:32:05] there is a little meal after so we'll
[1:32:08] just rush right away uh and then do uh
[1:32:12] as the Lord leads see but I want to draw
[1:32:16] your attention to Ephesians chapter
[1:32:20] 4 Ephesians chapter 4 and we will be
[1:32:23] reading the first six uh verses of
[1:32:27] Ephesians chapter
[1:32:29] 4 and we will uh read further on but for
[1:32:35] for the background here I want to just
[1:32:37] uh read
[1:32:39] this I therefore the prisoner of the
[1:32:43] Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of
[1:32:46] the vocation wherewith ye are
[1:32:49] called with all lonliness and
[1:32:52] meekness with longsuffering forbearing
[1:32:56] one another in love endeavoring now I
[1:32:59] want you to listen to the to these words
[1:33:03] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:33:08] spirit he's not talking about yet the
[1:33:12] unity of the
[1:33:14] faith this message in general if I would
[1:33:20] say in the message in general we have
[1:33:22] lost focus of that that Unity of spirit
[1:33:26] we don't even fellowship with one
[1:33:28] another
[1:33:29] hardly and there cannot be any Unity of
[1:33:32] the faith without first Unity of
[1:33:37] spirit you have to love your brother you
[1:33:40] have to love your
[1:33:42] sister amen we're following the same
[1:33:46] message amen we believe in the same
[1:33:49] Prophet the least we could do is come to
[1:33:52] a Unity of the spirit and God will do
[1:33:55] the
[1:33:57] rest amen the unity of the spirit in the
[1:34:00] bond of Peace amen and this is what I
[1:34:03] believe is going on
[1:34:05] today amen I'm so happy to see so many
[1:34:09] different uh visitors that's come from
[1:34:11] around the world and so forth amen we're
[1:34:14] not greater than you you're not greater
[1:34:16] than us we are
[1:34:18] fellowshipping around the revealed word
[1:34:21] of
[1:34:22] God if we can only get started God will
[1:34:25] do the
[1:34:26] rest amen and this is a miracle because
[1:34:30] there are some places you can't gather
[1:34:31] like this unless you're part of a group
[1:34:35] they don't want nothing to do with uh
[1:34:37] I'm telling you the truth but we have
[1:34:41] progressed by the grace of God Amen so
[1:34:46] listen there is one body yes sir and
[1:34:49] this is where I draw my title this uh
[1:34:54] evening there is one
[1:34:57] body remember

[1:38:07] Praise
[1:38:09] amen thank
[1:38:12] you I don't want to be too long
[1:38:14] tonight uh because as I said I I
[1:38:18] realized what's going on uh after and um
[1:38:22] I remember years
[1:38:24] ago
[1:38:26] um well I won't mention any names but uh
[1:38:30] there was let's say the morning service
[1:38:34] there was a a preacher that would come
[1:38:36] with a with a whole pile of books and
[1:38:40] plop them here and then plop them there
[1:38:43] we knew we had a long
[1:38:45] service that was in the
[1:38:47] morning okay and then it was always
[1:38:50] understood that in the evening you don't
[1:38:52] come with a PL
[1:38:54] and here comes a minister with a whole
[1:38:56] bunch of books and here and there uh but
[1:39:00] you realize that um we we have a little
[1:39:03] more understanding and compassion amen
[1:39:06] and to understand what I'm about to say
[1:39:10] you have to understand that there is no
[1:39:13] quote no scripture no nothing that I
[1:39:17] could say that can bring the unity of
[1:39:20] the faith that's right that's right
[1:39:23] because it doesn't come by
[1:39:26] word I have a scripture you may have one
[1:39:30] I have a quote you may have one that
[1:39:33] doesn't bring there's a war of quotes
[1:39:34] and scriptures and things only he can
[1:39:38] bring a Unity of the
[1:39:40] faith Hallelujah and I'm looking for it
[1:39:44] in this meeting praise God but the first
[1:39:47] thing that we've got to uh uh do is get
[1:39:50] in the unity of spirit amen so he can
[1:39:54] take it uh the rest of the way and I was
[1:39:59] reading a quote here and it blessed my
[1:40:02] heart this is a prayer from brother
[1:40:04] brandham and if you're wondering what it
[1:40:06] is that I'm saying or trying to get to
[1:40:08] this is a prayer maybe it'll help you
[1:40:10] understand bless every organization this
[1:40:14] is where brother Brown is preaching 1960
[1:40:16] God's provided way of approach to
[1:40:20] worship bless every organization in the
[1:40:22] valley
[1:40:24] all the Blessed people the ministers and
[1:40:27] pastors of the different denominations
[1:40:30] maybe we might disagree upon some
[1:40:34] theological teaching of scripture but
[1:40:38] father in all one principle we believe
[1:40:43] in
[1:40:45] God the Eternal one so help us Lord to
[1:40:50] have Unity of spirit
[1:40:55] until Unity of the faith is brought
[1:41:00] forth so the unity of the faith has got
[1:41:03] to be brought
[1:41:05] forth and no man can do it only God can
[1:41:09] do it Hallelujah and when we shall see
[1:41:13] him face to face then we'll all see eye
[1:41:17] to eye until that time May the Holy
[1:41:20] Spirit bless us in our efforts that we
[1:41:24] put forth we ask it in the name of the
[1:41:27] Lord Jesus Christ amen and that is my
[1:41:31] prayer
[1:41:33] tonight amen because we all know that
[1:41:36] we've got to come to a Unity of the
[1:41:40] faith that is the word the five-fold
[1:41:44] ministry will have a great Unity of the
[1:41:48] faith and I believe that God is training
[1:41:51] a five-fold Ministry
[1:41:54] but he wants to hone us a little more
[1:41:56] now amen amen because he wants to use us
[1:42:00] in the fullness of our
[1:42:03] ministry but he cannot use us fully
[1:42:08] unless we get rid of some
[1:42:11] things amen I hope you love me after
[1:42:15] this
[1:42:17] amen the Holy Ghost the Dynamics to our
[1:42:21] mechanics is what brings forth the true
[1:42:25] Unity of the faith that's right how many
[1:42:29] believe that to be the truth the Holy
[1:42:32] Ghost the Dynamics to our mechanics is
[1:42:36] what brings forth the true Unity of the
[1:42:41] faith and only he can bring
[1:42:45] it Hallelujah yes sir how many of of us
[1:42:49] have heard before oh we're waiting for
[1:42:52] the dynamic to this church what did
[1:42:55] Brother Brown said the Dynamics of this
[1:42:57] church will be a what a refilling of the
[1:42:59] Holy
[1:43:01] Ghost the Dynamics of this church will
[1:43:04] be a refilling of the Holy Spirit of
[1:43:08] what we have worked in a small
[1:43:12] measure God wants to increase that
[1:43:17] measure where the cripples can walk and
[1:43:20] the blind can see and the dead can be
[1:43:23] raised up
[1:43:25] Hallelujah that's a promise that I
[1:43:27] believe in that's a promise that I
[1:43:30] strive every day
[1:43:33] Hallelujah so don't get bored with this
[1:43:36] message don't get bored with oh there's
[1:43:38] coming a Dynamics to the church there is
[1:43:41] amen Noah had no other message he
[1:43:45] preached 120 years what did he preach
[1:43:49] what did he preach he never changed his
[1:43:52] title
[1:43:54] it's going to
[1:43:56] rain it's going to
[1:43:58] rain and I have to say right now the
[1:44:03] real rain is going to
[1:44:06] fall but it has to have sea to fall
[1:44:11] upon
[1:44:14] hallelujah
[1:44:16] amen glory be to godall and it'll take a
[1:44:21] holy ghost experience
[1:44:25] young
[1:44:26] people the reason I say this is because
[1:44:29] as I said I I feel that the Lord laid
[1:44:31] upon my heart to bring this because
[1:44:33] there are a lot of voices and things
[1:44:34] like this and uh I want to make sure
[1:44:37] that I preach what I I've always
[1:44:40] preached and I'm still here by the grace
[1:44:42] of
[1:44:43] God over 40 years or so I've been
[1:44:47] preaching the gospel I would have never
[1:44:50] made it here un unless it was for the
[1:44:52] holy
[1:44:55] [Applause]
[1:44:57] go I have not
[1:44:59] changed amen
[1:45:02] hallelujah amen so now I want you to
[1:45:04] notice it will take the Holy Ghost as an
[1:45:09] experience like it was on a day of
[1:45:11] Pentecost not an intellectual
[1:45:16] understanding of what the Holy Ghost is
[1:45:19] and you get a good feeling and so forth
[1:45:21] and you remain the same it hasn't
[1:45:23] change the Holy Ghost comes to change
[1:45:26] you from the
[1:45:27] [Applause]
[1:45:28] [Music]
[1:45:30] inside it comes to burn out all the
[1:45:35] demons the very traces and desire of sin
[1:45:39] and
[1:45:40] whatever oh Hallelujah to the
[1:45:44] lamb it'll help you get to the next step
[1:45:48] when you feel like giving up the Holy
[1:45:52] Ghost will which is your theophany comes
[1:45:55] closer and says get up from there you
[1:45:59] can make it by the grace of allmighty
[1:46:02] God
[1:46:04] hallelujah
[1:46:06] amen and where is that theophany sitting
[1:46:09] here tonight brother Braham say your
[1:46:12] theophany is right next is sitting right
[1:46:15] next to
[1:46:16] you brother and if your theophany is
[1:46:19] sitting right next to you there is no
[1:46:21] way you can sit still amen because there
[1:46:24] is a power of the Holy Ghost quickening
[1:46:28] your
[1:46:32] body I'm not trying to make people shout
[1:46:35] but if I if you agree with what I'm
[1:46:38] saying there is something on the inside
[1:46:41] that has to cry out
[1:46:45] amen
[1:46:47] hallelujah because you recognize this
[1:46:49] word you've heard this word somewhere
[1:46:52] way before there was a beginning way
[1:46:55] before there was a moon and a star
[1:46:57] whatever you heard it a it's a certain
[1:47:01] sound and you say Amen to it
[1:47:06] Hallelujah but now I want you to realize
[1:47:09] Hallelujah now you can be seated in a
[1:47:11] moment because I want you to understand
[1:47:12] this 120 Souls went up to the upper
[1:47:18] room in the upper room they did not have
[1:47:21] a Unity of the faith that's right they
[1:47:24] did not have the unity of the faith they
[1:47:26] went in
[1:47:28] obedience
[1:47:29] Hallelujah and they obeyed the voice of
[1:47:33] Jesus Amen and they waited for the
[1:47:36] promise of the father in one mind and
[1:47:40] one Accord we know how the scriptures
[1:47:42] say but they had Unity of spirit but not
[1:47:46] Unity of the
[1:47:49] faith oh Hallelujah you mean need to
[1:47:53] tell me that you could be in in the
[1:47:56] upper room and still have don't have the
[1:47:59] unity of spirit you're not going to get
[1:48:03] anything because you're not open for
[1:48:06] amen whatever God's program is but now
[1:48:09] let's listen so they had the uh Unity of
[1:48:13] spirit but not the unity of Faith they
[1:48:15] were trusting and praying for the
[1:48:17] promise of the father that's what they
[1:48:21] had uh uh gathered therefore and in the
[1:48:25] upper
[1:48:26] room there was no five-fold Ministry
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:35] yet they were
[1:48:37] 120 seeds no five-fold Ministry
[1:48:42] yet amen they were under the unity of
[1:48:46] spirit but something
[1:48:49] happened and this is what I'm talking
[1:48:51] about now
[1:48:53] only God can make it
[1:48:57] happen because when the day of Pentecost
[1:49:01] was fully
[1:49:02] come listen God sent them to the upper
[1:49:07] room and said
[1:49:09] wait and he said oh wait until you are
[1:49:14] indued with power from on high and
[1:49:18] listen Our God does not
[1:49:20] lie he knew that was a coming of
[1:49:25] Pentecost amen he spoke it it went out
[1:49:29] and the Holy Spirit followed that
[1:49:32] word and one day when the day of
[1:49:35] Pentecost was fully come it hovered over
[1:49:38] the
[1:49:39] 120 amen Ready To Break
[1:49:43] Forth
[1:49:44] Hallelujah and I'm going to tell you
[1:49:46] something they were gathered in the
[1:49:49] unity of spirit but when the Holy Ghost
[1:49:52] comes down they came down Apostles
[1:49:56] teachers evangelists amen
[1:50:01] prophets oh
[1:50:04] hallelujah
[1:50:05] oh Hallelujah you see how important the
[1:50:09] Holy Ghost
[1:50:10] is amen don't ever let the devil steal
[1:50:13] the holy ghost from
[1:50:15] you and you may have the Holy Ghost God
[1:50:18] bless you keep it hold on to it fight
[1:50:21] for dear life
[1:50:23] amen because if you don't know where
[1:50:24] you're standing the devil will try to
[1:50:26] take
[1:50:28] it amen
[1:50:30] hallelujah see so now the gift of the
[1:50:33] Holy Ghost was
[1:50:36] divided
[1:50:38] God all that God was he poured it into
[1:50:42] Christ the fullness of the Holy Spirit
[1:50:46] wasn't
[1:50:48] Christ amen so now Christ walked among
[1:50:52] them them among men they did not have
[1:50:57] what Christ had because the Holy Ghost
[1:51:00] had not been imparted yet amen he had to
[1:51:05] uh finish his course at the cross and
[1:51:07] say it is
[1:51:09] finished amen and when he gave up the
[1:51:12] ghost Hallelujah here it comes back on
[1:51:15] the day of
[1:51:16] Pentecost and it divided
[1:51:19] himself amen among 120 yeah
[1:51:23] and after that 5,000 let me tell you
[1:51:25] something the Holy Ghost is
[1:51:27] contagious oh
[1:51:30] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:51:32] hallelujah 5,000 10,000 after
[1:51:37] that and he's still in the Holy Ghost
[1:51:40] filling
[1:51:41] business oh hallelujah amen glory so it
[1:51:47] was a gift of the Holy Ghost that would
[1:51:49] divided himself and put a five for
[1:51:52] Ministry
[1:51:55] interaction do you understand Hallelujah
[1:52:00] they came
[1:52:01] down not only sealed but positionally
[1:52:05] placed that's the measure that they
[1:52:09] had hallelujah amen so some Apostles
[1:52:14] some evangelists some pastors and
[1:52:16] teachers amen so now
[1:52:21] uh now they contended for One Faith one
[1:52:27] Lord and one
[1:52:29] baptism now the content uh now is time
[1:52:33] to contend
[1:52:35] for because brother Brown said either
[1:52:37] you have the Holy Ghost or you have
[1:52:45] religion so I uh listen after the Holy
[1:52:49] Ghost has been
[1:52:50] released didn't br Bram said uh the Holy
[1:52:54] Ghost has been bound for over 2,000
[1:52:56] years uh over at the river of Euphrates
[1:53:00] but the evening time message releases
[1:53:02] the Holy
[1:53:03] Ghost now that it is released I want
[1:53:05] part of it I want my part praise God
[1:53:09] give me my Mountain praise God Amen I
[1:53:13] want my part amen glory be to
[1:53:17] God listen there's been churches
[1:53:20] churches bries Brides churches
[1:53:24] churches hey all throughout the church
[1:53:26] ages all throughout the the ages see

[1:53:38] one
[1:53:40] hallelujah amen there's got to come a
[1:53:42] real bride there must come one that not
[1:53:46] only got mechanics but dynamics of it
[1:53:53] oh
[1:53:55] Hallelujah glory be to God and I'm
[1:53:58] afraid that we have been so busy with
[1:54:02] mechanics on Amen trying to figure out
[1:54:05] what did Brother Brown said here what
[1:54:06] did Brother Brown said that and we're
[1:54:08] full of mechanics now oh hallelujah
[1:54:11] we're full of mechanics but listen we're
[1:54:13] we're putting less emphasis on the
[1:54:16] Dynamics we've got the stress the
[1:54:20] Dynamics this age we've got the stress
[1:54:23] the
[1:54:24] Dynamics because the Dynamics is what's
[1:54:27] going to get us out of here praise be to
[1:54:30] God
[1:54:32] hallelujah you can be an intellectual
[1:54:35] Giant in this message it don't get you
[1:54:38] nowhere what we need is a good
[1:54:40] oldfashioned heart F holy ghost devil
[1:54:43] chasing true blue red hot bloodb
[1:54:48] experience with the Holy Ghost and it

[1:56:21] to The Altar and they begin to cry out
[1:56:25] and their suits were so wet with tears
[1:56:28] not coming down their NOS they did not
[1:56:32] care they wanted God himself to change
[1:56:41] them
[1:56:42] Hallelujah give me that oldfashioned
[1:56:46] Revival that's what I need that's what

[1:59:35] years we've read the mechanics and
[1:59:38] everything else we understand it amen or
[1:59:41] at least we think we understand it and
[1:59:43] uh unless it comes to you by Revelation
[1:59:46] there's no way for us to
[1:59:49] understand you see it has to come by
[1:59:51] revelation
[1:59:52] and it makes the church live talking
[1:59:55] about the
[1:59:56] Dynamics amen does your car
[1:59:59] work you can have a brand new car with
[2:00:02] no
[2:00:04] gasoline it can be brand new Straight
[2:00:08] Out of the
[2:00:10] showroom but my question is does it
[2:00:15] work when you turn the key does
[2:00:18] [Music]
[2:00:20] it can you put it in into
[2:00:23] service
[2:00:25] Hallelujah because I want to compare the
[2:00:27] fivefold ministry today with the
[2:00:29] fivefold ministry of the
[2:00:32] apostolic ho ho ho ho
[2:00:34] [Applause]
[2:00:36] ho in the book of Acts you're going to
[2:00:39] find out amen that we need a little
[2:00:44] humbling we need a little
[2:00:47] humbling and I'll and and I'll get to
[2:00:49] that point in a minute but until we come
[2:00:51] to that place
[2:00:52] until we find that place see we got to
[2:00:55] find that place we have to come to that
[2:00:58] place and we're on a way
[2:01:02] tonight and by the grace of God we will
[2:01:04] find that
[2:01:06] place hallelujah what good does it do to
[2:01:09] polish the hubc Caps amen amen what good
[2:01:12] does it do to give a facelift and
[2:01:14] simonized job when there's no Dynamics
[2:01:16] in it see no matter how much mechanics
[2:01:19] proves to be uh right there there has
[2:01:22] got to be a Dynamics to make it
[2:01:29] work my precious brother was speaking uh
[2:01:32] this morning 60
[2:01:34] years 60 years since the revealing of
[2:01:38] the Seven Seals and so forth by now by
[2:01:43] now brother we we should have been way
[2:01:45] up the
[2:01:47] road way up the
[2:01:50] road Hallelujah
[2:01:53] way up the
[2:01:54] road but we're going to find out tonight
[2:01:56] we're going to get back on that road now
[2:01:59] amen because you see God many times
[2:02:03] permits things to happen
[2:02:08] right to test our
[2:02:15] character he'll cause people to talk
[2:02:18] about
[2:02:19] you Hallelujah he'll call people people
[2:02:22] to stab you in the
[2:02:24] back and you have to have
[2:02:29] self-control because that's the nature
[2:02:31] of the
[2:02:35] person everybody else will blow up but
[2:02:39] what makes you different is listen the
[2:02:42] apostles were menant a few
[2:02:44] words they didn't have to argue with
[2:02:48] anybody they knew where they stood
[2:02:50] Hallelujah
[2:02:54] and when they spoke Heaven opened
[2:02:58] up it didn't prove didn't have to prove
[2:03:00] anything God backed them
[2:03:03] up God backed them
[2:03:06] up
[2:03:08] Hallelujah because it was God's
[2:03:11] men so see uh there's no Dynamics in it
[2:03:16] no matter how much the mechanics prove
[2:03:18] it to be right it's got to be mechanics
[2:03:20] Dynamics rather to work so now quickly
[2:03:22] Ephesians chapter uh 4 let's let's
[2:03:25] continue on this so I I'll put it back
[2:03:28] in the word so we'll understand now
[2:03:30] Ephesians 4 and verse 11 uh let's see
[2:03:34] what brother Brown says here or rather
[2:03:35] this the scripture says here and he gave
[2:03:38] some Apostles and some prophets and some
[2:03:42] evangelists and some pastors and some
[2:03:45] teachers
[2:03:47] now listen this is a fivefold Ministry
[2:03:50] Hallelujah
[2:03:52] what for the perfecting of the
[2:03:58] Saints we have a
[2:04:01] work the work of the
[2:04:05] ministry what are we supposed to do
[2:04:08] edify the body of
[2:04:10] [Applause]
[2:04:12] Christ in other words five-fold Ministry
[2:04:16] we're Servants of the people
[2:04:21] our job is to build up the
[2:04:24] [Applause]
[2:04:27] body to encourage the body to preach the
[2:04:32] baptism of the Holy
[2:04:33] [Applause]
[2:04:37] Ghost but today somehow we've got
[2:04:39] something
[2:04:42] wrong if you say you're a five-fold
[2:04:45] minister first of all I've been around
[2:04:47] the world everybody wants to be an
[2:04:50] apostle teachers too too
[2:04:54] low pastors too low everybody wants to
[2:04:56] be Apostle okay that's great if God made
[2:04:58] you an apostle that's
[2:05:00] wonderful but what happens is it's a
[2:05:04] prestigious
[2:05:07] position I'm not talking about here now
[2:05:10] I'm talking about what's going on in the
[2:05:13] world you understand what I'm
[2:05:15] saying prestigious position I am a
[2:05:18] five-fold minister good for you st
[2:05:21] serving the
[2:05:23] [Applause]
[2:05:25] people stop praying for the people to
[2:05:28] get the Holy Ghost stop praying start
[2:05:31] praying for the people to be healed and
[2:05:34] Hallelujah start doing something because
[2:05:37] we're Servants of the
[2:05:40] people start preaching to edify the body
[2:05:43] of Jesus Christ until when until how
[2:05:47] long until we all come to the Statue of
[2:05:51] the the fullness of Jesus
[2:05:55] Christ that's the Great
[2:05:59] Commission everybody wants to be 54
[2:06:01] Minister that's good and it's good to be
[2:06:04] 54 Minister but I'm GNA I'm I'm going to
[2:06:06] bring some positive things about P five4
[2:06:09] ministers see but the thing
[2:06:12] is we
[2:06:17] misunderstand look at the Apostles of
[2:06:19] old
[2:06:21] it wasn't no prestigious
[2:06:28] position many got their heads chopped
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:34] off some were boiled in Vats of hot
[2:06:40] oil some gave their lives for the
[2:06:46] gospel because in them was the faith and
[2:06:51] they would not deny the
[2:06:53] [Applause]
[2:06:54] faith the original apostles were rugged
[2:06:59] [Applause]
[2:07:02] men and they did not compromise with the
[2:07:05] word of
[2:07:08] God hallelujah no
[2:07:13] compromising when they saw something
[2:07:15] wrong they spoke it cuz God told them to
[2:07:18] do
[2:07:20] it that's that's their
[2:07:27] position but today oh yeah I want to be
[2:07:29] Apostle oh yeah would you give your life
[2:07:31] for
[2:07:33] it would you permit yourself to be cast
[2:07:36] into a vat of
[2:07:38] oil would you permit yourself to be your
[2:07:41] head chopped off listen the Apostles of
[2:07:45] old didn't even
[2:07:47] care because they
[2:07:50] knew that they awaited a more glorious
[2:07:55] [Applause]
[2:08:02] place okay I'm still laying down some
[2:08:04] things amen listen till we
[2:08:08] all how long are
[2:08:11] these God called Men supposed to
[2:08:16] be
[2:08:18] working in their Church
[2:08:23] until
[2:08:25] until that's not just a specific time
[2:08:29] it's
[2:08:30] until which means don't
[2:08:32] quit
[2:08:35] until amen until or they all come to the
[2:08:39] unity of the
[2:08:41] faith now the unity of the spirit is
[2:08:44] different than the unity of the faith
[2:08:46] hallelujah hallelujah and a knowledge of
[2:08:50] the Son of God unto a person perfect man
[2:08:51] unto the measure of the Statue of the
[2:08:54] fullness of Jesus Christ that we
[2:08:57] henceforth be no more children tossed
[2:09:00] and fro tossed and fro and carried about
[2:09:03] with every wind of Doctrine you see the
[2:09:07] reason I'm speaking certain thing
[2:09:09] because there's a lot of Winds of
[2:09:10] Doctrine passed by and somebody's got to
[2:09:13] say
[2:09:17] something now listen by the Slate of men
[2:09:21] and
[2:09:22] cunning
[2:09:26] craftiness they used to you know
[2:09:28] remember years ago I remember uh you
[2:09:31] know years ago when brother Bram was
[2:09:34] taken from the scene as said watch
[2:09:37] Pentecost so close that can deceive the
[2:09:39] very elected if possible watch
[2:09:44] Pentecost Pentecost can't deceive
[2:09:48] nobody no not the bride
[2:09:52] Pentecost don't deceive
[2:09:55] anybody is those people that come up
[2:09:57] with spoken word
[2:10:00] books they read the same
[2:10:05] books they quote from the same uh
[2:10:08] prophet's message and so forth and but
[2:10:12] they have a
[2:10:15] spin that you have to watch
[2:10:18] it and I'm going to tell you something
[2:10:20] here's the importance of having the Holy
[2:10:23] Ghost the Holy Ghost is a
[2:10:34] filter the Holy Ghost is the spirit of
[2:10:39] Truth and somebody could be preaching
[2:10:44] something that you may not fully
[2:10:47] understand but in here
[2:10:55] push it back because there's a filter
[2:10:59] inside the spirit of
[2:11:02] Truth you shall know the truth and the
[2:11:05] truth shall set you
[2:11:10] free I spoken to many brothers and
[2:11:13] sisters you know what I didn't
[2:11:15] understand what he was saying but I just
[2:11:16] couldn't receive that I said Thank God
[2:11:19] Amen you don't have to figure out see
[2:11:22] intellectualism will catch a lot of
[2:11:25] people they put the word together in
[2:11:27] such a way that wow it tickles the
[2:11:30] intellect and it catches people with
[2:11:33] intellect amen but you have to
[2:11:36] understand that this is where the word
[2:11:37] of God comes to in the heart and when
[2:11:41] you're filled with the Holy Ghost there
[2:11:43] is it's too late Satan the word is in
[2:11:47] the
[2:11:49] bride no other SE can work in
[2:11:54] her praise be to
[2:11:58] God you cannot be
[2:12:01] deceived
[2:12:03] impossible let me say that one more time
[2:12:09] impossible you know brother Braham said
[2:12:12] the
[2:12:13] predestinated are the only ones that are
[2:12:16] redeemable
[2:12:19] [Music]
[2:12:24] not because you're a better
[2:12:26] person not because you live a certain
[2:12:31] way but because God before the
[2:12:34] foundation of the world he chose
[2:12:38] you
[2:12:40] Hallelujah and you are
[2:12:43] [Music]
[2:12:50] redeemable it's not goodness because
[2:12:52] brother Brown said Jacob Jacob uh rather
[2:12:56] Esau was a much better person than Jacob
[2:13:01] was he took care of his
[2:13:03] daddy but he had disregard for the
[2:13:07] birthright you know what the birthright
[2:13:10] is you know what the birthright is today
[2:13:13] the birthright is the Holy
[2:13:15] Ghost don't make light of the Holy
[2:13:19] Ghost Hallelujah
[2:13:23] Esau said I don't need that I'm
[2:13:27] hungry I need to eat
[2:13:29] today but he didn't realize amen that
[2:13:32] the birthright we're talking about the
[2:13:34] Holy Ghost is eternal food that will
[2:13:36] keep you alive
[2:13:39] eternally amen glory be to God let's
[2:13:44] let's continue see uh for the perfecting
[2:13:48] of the Saints for the work of the
[2:13:49] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[2:13:51] Christ till we all come to the unity of
[2:13:53] the faith and the knowledge of the Son
[2:13:54] of God unto a perfect man unto the
[2:13:57] measure of the statute the
[2:14:00] fullness of Christ we have work to do
[2:14:05] friends you see that statue of perfect
[2:14:08] man sir brother Brown didn't just bring
[2:14:11] that
[2:14:12] out amen now
[2:14:15] listen brother Brown said he always
[2:14:18] taught add to your faith faith is what
[2:14:22] the Holy
[2:14:24] Ghost so without the Holy Ghost you
[2:14:27] can't even
[2:14:28] add this is why it's so
[2:14:32] important faith is the Holy
[2:14:35] Ghost see how important it
[2:14:37] is but we're promised to reach the
[2:14:42] headstone and as we near The Headstone
[2:14:45] we will be so much like
[2:14:48] Christ that's when you see the fire
[2:14:51] Ministry get into his position and his
[2:14:54] action because we'll be so much like
[2:14:57] Christ they will not be able to tell you
[2:15:00] AP
[2:15:04] part so much like Jesus
[2:15:07] Christ that's when you can say when you
[2:15:10] see me you see my
[2:15:13] father that's when you can say Amen to a
[2:15:16] farmer who has not had rain in three or
[2:15:20] four months
[2:15:22] in the name of Jesus Christ I send you
[2:15:27] rain and you don't even wait for it to
[2:15:30] start you walk away knowing it's going
[2:15:32] to
[2:15:35] rain cuz a spoken word once it's spoken
[2:15:39] the Holy Spirit follows that word to
[2:15:42] make it come to
[2:15:43] pass and right now there's a promise of
[2:15:46] the Holy Ghost hovering all over this
[2:15:49] building and my word will not return
[2:15:53] void but shall accomplish the purpose he
[2:15:57] sent it for because our God is not a
[2:16:00] liar he promises you something you're
[2:16:03] going to get it Hallelujah you're going
[2:16:05] to get it I'm going to say it again
[2:16:08] you're going to get it hallelujah
[2:16:11] hallelujah
[2:16:12] hallelujah just create the atmosphere
[2:16:16] for him to walk up and down the aisles
[2:16:19] [Applause]
[2:16:25] why I like singing he never failed me
[2:16:28] yet he's never failed me
[2:16:33] yet till we all come to the unity of the
[2:16:37] faith so there is a Unity of the faith
[2:16:40] and we all striving to come to that
[2:16:44] Unity of the faith and yet naturally no
[2:16:48] quote can do it no scripture can do it
[2:16:52] only he can come down and bring the
[2:16:54] unity of the
[2:16:55] faith but until that time have Unity of
[2:16:59] spirit because that creates the
[2:17:01] atmosphere for Unity of the faith and
[2:17:04] this is why I'm happy that I see uh the
[2:17:07] whole convention open to who
[2:17:10] whosoever
[2:17:13] hu so it doesn't matter where you go you
[2:17:17] have people that are just I mean
[2:17:19] ministers is so shook up and so
[2:17:22] possesses of of their congregation don't
[2:17:24] go over there don't do this don't do
[2:17:26] that and they get mad and they
[2:17:27] excommunicate you because you went to
[2:17:29] visit a
[2:17:32] friend nothing nothing wrong with you
[2:17:34] that the pastor needs to to to to
[2:17:38] to pray a little
[2:17:44] more pray a little more have
[2:17:47] patience what what are you afraid of
[2:17:50] Amen
[2:17:51] see and there are I hate to say it
[2:17:54] because there are some places you you
[2:17:56] become a member and you never come
[2:18:01] out there's a p is a prison not a
[2:18:05] church you can't do this you can't do
[2:18:07] that you can't do that and I'm not
[2:18:10] listen it's getting quiet here but it's
[2:18:13] all
[2:18:13] [Applause]
[2:18:15] right it's all
[2:18:17] right listen you know why we're free
[2:18:20] from here and out we're
[2:18:22] free we're
[2:18:24] free if we want to fellowship with that
[2:18:27] one that one is not going to deceive us
[2:18:29] because of whatever it is that he's
[2:18:31] preaching we have a
[2:18:36] filter who knows you may convert that
[2:18:39] other
[2:18:40] person who knows you may uh be sent
[2:18:44] there amen just like
[2:18:46] Cornelius sent for Peter
[2:18:51] Glory Glory Glory sit down a moment so I
[2:18:53] I just want to illustrate
[2:18:56] something
[2:18:58] Peter reminds me of
[2:19:00] myself and so many of us can
[2:19:05] agree God had a special relationship
[2:19:07] with
[2:19:08] Peter Cornelius was
[2:19:11] ready he prayed he gave arms he he he
[2:19:15] was righteous and yet he was a
[2:19:18] gentile he was a gentile
[2:19:21] but he was righteous in the sight of the
[2:19:23] go of sight of the Lord and Peter was
[2:19:26] was resting on a
[2:19:28] roof and a vision come down to Peter and
[2:19:31] said
[2:19:33] Peter slay and
[2:19:40] eat pet Peter didn't have that Spirit of
[2:19:46] uh he had that Spirit of you he had to
[2:19:50] of course the faith but he wasn't ready
[2:19:53] to make a step and he said
[2:19:58] no I will not I've never eaten anything
[2:20:02] see but God has a way of of doing things
[2:20:07] that blows your mind
[2:20:09] out and if you're not ready to follow
[2:20:13] the leading of the
[2:20:15] Lord amen you'll never go to that
[2:20:19] place and if Peter never went to
[2:20:22] Cornelius Cornelius would have never had
[2:20:25] the chance of
[2:20:29] Salvation And The Voice come down a
[2:20:32] second time and Peter said
[2:20:35] no can you imagine that no I've never
[2:20:39] eaten anything
[2:20:41] unclean and the third
[2:20:43] time Peter was
[2:20:46] troubled Peter slay and eat
[2:20:51] he was a little confused then but you
[2:20:54] know I I've told the story before
[2:20:56] Cornelius was
[2:20:59] ready he was ready Peter was
[2:21:02] not there are people outside that are
[2:21:07] ready Hallelujah and we must be ready to
[2:21:12] go and stop fussing with the
[2:21:16] Lord if he sends you to Africa if he
[2:21:19] sends you to Europe a place you have
[2:21:22] never been go there by faith because God
[2:21:25] I believe will give you the great
[2:21:27] Victory if he sends you he's got to back
[2:21:31] you
[2:21:35] up
[2:21:38] hallelujah amen it may confuse your
[2:21:41] friends and so forth why would you go
[2:21:43] there because God told me to go there
[2:21:47] and this is why I like the Church of the
[2:21:49] Living God it was never a
[2:21:53] denomination he didn't have to call
[2:21:55] headquarters can I go he went because
[2:21:58] God told him to
[2:22:01] go and this is why I like uh brother o i
[2:22:05] i I asked brother ID brother ID who did
[2:22:08] you ask to have these con
[2:22:10] conventions he said nobody I said Thank
[2:22:16] You
[2:22:18] denomination we're falling to denom
[2:22:20] denomination you know amen you can't do
[2:22:23] it unless you call somebody that's
[2:22:27] denomination watch
[2:22:30] denomination it's a spirit it
[2:22:35] controls it robs you of your
[2:22:38] blessing not only that but it binds you
[2:22:41] to a human
[2:22:44] being who's off the
[2:22:47] [Applause]
[2:22:49] word Hallelujah brother brandham said in
[2:22:52] the church ages is that they bind the
[2:22:55] people to
[2:22:56] themselves
[2:22:58] hallelujah we're supposed to bind the
[2:23:01] church to Jesus Christ the son of the
[2:23:05] Living
[2:23:12] God
[2:23:15] hallelujah so so Peter finally went okay
[2:23:19] and you know what
[2:23:21] as I said I have 20 24 minutes is that
[2:23:24] it right can you can you bear another 24
[2:23:27] minutes of of what I'm
[2:23:29] saying all right okay listen and Peter
[2:23:34] when he got there the house was
[2:23:38] full of hungry
[2:23:43] Believers the ground was right it's
[2:23:47] ready for the
[2:23:48] seed on and Peter said why did you ask
[2:23:52] why did you call for me and this is why
[2:23:56] I say GPS is impersonation of what God
[2:24:00] had years
[2:24:02] ago cuz he told Cornelius exactly where
[2:24:05] Peter
[2:24:06] was he told him what what door to knock
[2:24:10] on where to find
[2:24:13] him and he also working on both ends he
[2:24:16] told Peter go and ask no more questions
[2:24:21] sometimes we ask too many questions the
[2:24:23] Holy Spirit have to say shut up and
[2:24:25] don't ask questions
[2:24:28] go Hallelujah to the
[2:24:31] lamb so he went by the grace of God and
[2:24:35] while Peter yet spoke the word now if if
[2:24:38] the ground wasn't ripened and guess what
[2:24:42] that house was
[2:24:44] full of his family of his
[2:24:49] children amen because he knew he was
[2:24:52] going to receive
[2:24:55] [Applause]
[2:24:56] something Hallelujah and while Peter yet
[2:25:00] spoke the
[2:25:02] word the Holy Ghost fell upon them they
[2:25:04] spoke in tongues and so forth oh that
[2:25:06] confused Peter amen oh how on Earth they
[2:25:10] receive the Holy Ghost they not even
[2:25:12] baptized oh my God don't listen God will
[2:25:16] do things that will blow your mind
[2:25:19] out let them get the Holy Ghost and then
[2:25:21] baptize them later but they amen but he
[2:25:24] did it and then he had to explain to uh
[2:25:27] Jerusalem and all those that up there
[2:25:29] and said you know this is what happened
[2:25:32] and they had to admit well God God has
[2:25:36] turned over to the Gentiles now what are
[2:25:38] we going to do they receive the Holy
[2:25:40] Ghost amen see that's the how God works
[2:25:43] a f real 5old
[2:25:46] ministry glory glory glory okay
[2:25:50] till we all come to un okay uh that we
[2:25:53] henceforth be no more children tossed
[2:25:55] and fro and carried about with every
[2:25:58] wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men
[2:26:00] cunning craftiness whereby we they lie
[2:26:03] and wait to deceive so now uh let us for
[2:26:09] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[2:26:13] into him in all things which is the head
[2:26:18] even Christ now we are growing up into
[2:26:23] what the
[2:26:25] head even
[2:26:31] Christ your pastor your uh all those
[2:26:36] that are in this great ministry are
[2:26:40] supposed to be preaching
[2:26:42] Christ your head is
[2:26:44] Christ you're bound to
[2:26:48] Christ not to a man
[2:26:51] amen from whom the whole body is fitly
[2:26:54] joined together compact by that which
[2:26:57] every joint supplieth according to the
[2:26:59] effectual working of the measure of
[2:27:02] every part maketh increase uh of the
[2:27:05] body unto the edifying of itself in love
[2:27:10] so the true purpose of the five-fold
[2:27:12] ministry is to serve God's
[2:27:16] people do you understand
[2:27:18] that they are to edify the body
[2:27:21] encourage the body build up the body
[2:27:23] strengthen the body until we all reach
[2:27:25] this great place where we all know we
[2:27:28] must reach we all have to come to
[2:27:33] perfection in order to call the
[2:27:44] resurrection I was going to say
[2:27:46] something I'm going to check it amen in
[2:27:49] order to come uh call the resurrection
[2:27:52] this church has got to come to
[2:27:55] Perfection and a five-fold ministry will
[2:27:58] be used to bring this church to
[2:28:00] Perfection by the
[2:28:02] word amen the ministry of Ephesians 4 is
[2:28:07] not for personal
[2:28:11] Vindication now I'm I'm I'm touching a
[2:28:15] sore spot
[2:28:18] here I'm I'm going to do it I'm going to
[2:28:20] do it I'm going to do it I'm going to do
[2:28:21] it he said go ahead thank
[2:28:26] you you ever heard of somebody said who
[2:28:29] who prayed for that brother who got
[2:28:30] healed of
[2:28:32] cancer oh God heard my prayers you know
[2:28:36] and meanwhile the whole church is
[2:28:38] praying you see the point is
[2:28:42] this our prayer should be Lord Heal that
[2:28:47] individual I don't care how it happen
[2:28:53] it's not for my
[2:28:55] Vindication I want that individual that
[2:28:58] sheep
[2:29:00] heal cancer is
[2:29:03] disappearing you see but so much has
[2:29:06] been focused on personal
[2:29:18] Vindication they all carry their cross
[2:29:20] and suffer greatly for the faith in
[2:29:23] Christ Paul now listen I'm comparing the
[2:29:29] Ephesians uh the body rather the
[2:29:32] ministry of the fivefold ministry of
[2:29:34] years ago They Carried a heavy cross you
[2:29:38] know they were menant a few words Paul
[2:29:42] was beheaded in Rome Peter crucified
[2:29:45] upside down John was placed in the vat
[2:29:48] of
[2:29:48] oil and and they were humble men willing
[2:29:51] to stand in the face of death and
[2:29:54] torment the Holy Ghost gave them
[2:29:58] boldness and they were willing to stand
[2:30:01] unto the death today it's all about
[2:30:06] status this is why we need to Humble
[2:30:08] ourselves a little
[2:30:11] bit humble yourself if God answers your
[2:30:15] prayers thank God for it
[2:30:18] hallel all glory goes to
[2:30:25] Jesus amen everyone thinks okay everyone
[2:30:30] thinks amen uh and want to be an apostle
[2:30:34] that's all that's okay they want to be
[2:30:36] an apostle
[2:30:40] why so many of us today who call
[2:30:43] ourselves Ministers of the Gospel could
[2:30:45] never even stand in the shadow of these
[2:30:48] old of the new test
[2:30:53] Apostles God
[2:30:55] chose you to help build up and
[2:30:58] strengthen his church that's what a
[2:31:00] fivefold Ministry is this is what
[2:31:02] Ephesians 4 is all
[2:31:05] about it's not just a title or position
[2:31:09] it's a Ministry in which we should take
[2:31:13] seriously and with great
[2:31:16] reverence and not only that but telling
[2:31:20] the truth in
[2:31:23] Love no matter how
[2:31:27] people understand it or don't understand
[2:31:29] it I have many friends and I have many
[2:31:32] enemies I go home just as
[2:31:35] happy you know why because I'm not
[2:31:38] asking if this is right or
[2:31:40] wrong I speak because this is my
[2:31:44] conviction amen and I
[2:31:46] see mainly an attack on the Holy Ghost
[2:31:50] and I wanted to make sure I Dro this
[2:31:53] right here in Trinidad because I'm sure
[2:31:55] the tapes will go
[2:31:56] out and oh boy I'm I'm I am of course
[2:32:03] always uh talked about but it's
[2:32:08] okay it's okay somebody's got to say
[2:32:15] it

[2:39:23] to
[2:39:25] understand that the unity of the
[2:39:28] faith is coming in

[2:39:33] almighty God a great
[2:39:37] manifestation of the Holy Spirit as we
[2:39:40] near the great
[2:39:41] headstone we will be so much like Jesus
[2:39:45] Christ but we have got to Humble
[2:39:48] ourselves
[2:39:54] so Jesus gets the
[2:39:57] glory because he will not share his
[2:40:00] glory with any
[2:40:01] man no
[2:40:03] man and listen I am not telling you to
[2:40:06] disrespect your pastor your pastor
[2:40:08] should be
[2:40:10] respected evangelists and everyone else
[2:40:12] should be respected for the gift that
[2:40:15] God has given to the
[2:40:17] church they should be respect Ed but
[2:40:20] they are human beings just like you and
[2:40:24] I and their purpose is to lift up Jesus
[2:40:29] in such a
[2:40:30] way that is their Ministry to build up
[2:40:34] the body of Jesus Christ until we all
[2:40:37] come to the unity of the faith and the
[2:40:40] knowledge of the Son of God and anyone
[2:40:43] else that tries to be an
[2:40:47] angel tries to be more than what they
[2:40:49] think they are that is off the
[2:40:55] work hallelujah hallelu amen listen
[2:41:00] there's a quote that I'm going to read
[2:41:01] here in a minute so you'll understand it
[2:41:05] God gave the in increase don't worry
[2:41:07] about God will give the
[2:41:10] rewards uh every five-fold Minister
[2:41:14] every uh Ministry of Jesus Christ God
[2:41:18] understands what you're going through
[2:41:20] he's going to he's going to uh bless you
[2:41:24] I remember there was a brother who was
[2:41:26] upset or in
[2:41:29] Europe he said I'm just so upset upset
[2:41:32] that I was eliminated or
[2:41:36] bypass uh I should be an apostle because
[2:41:40] I take canoes into villages in Africa
[2:41:44] and this and that and I'm upset that I'm
[2:41:48] not an apostle because he was looking
[2:41:51] for somebody to give him amen
[2:41:56] recognition don't look for anyone to
[2:41:58] give you
[2:42:03] recognition you know why God has put in
[2:42:06] a
[2:42:07] church not
[2:42:10] man some Apostles some teachers some
[2:42:13] evangelist because if man called you to
[2:42:16] be an apostle they can take you away
[2:42:20] way but if God has called
[2:42:25] you if God made you an apostle if God
[2:42:29] made you a prophet if God made you a
[2:42:32] teacher I don't care you don't looking
[2:42:34] you're not looking for recognition
[2:42:37] anywhere else you're doing the works of
[2:42:39] Christ and you walk back home or you
[2:42:42] take a flight back home and you feel
[2:42:44] good because you did what God told you
[2:42:47] to do
[2:42:49] you don't get on the phone and say how
[2:42:51] did I
[2:42:53] do how did you do praise be to God I
[2:42:58] Know This is Gospel this is this is
[2:43:01] listen I I I don't mean to be rough but
[2:43:04] this is This is
[2:43:06] Gospel now let's let me just say
[2:43:09] this cuz I I
[2:43:12] save the worst for last or I mean the
[2:43:15] best for last
[2:43:20] there's certain quotes you can only use
[2:43:21] at the end because then you're gone you
[2:43:29] know listen I'm I'm just reading the the
[2:43:34] quote you want you want to get upset
[2:43:36] with me it's okay it's it's you know
[2:43:39] wouldn't be the first time
[2:43:42] anyway
[2:43:43] now as an
[2:43:46] apostle as a
[2:43:48] member of the fivefold
[2:43:51] ministry I want you to
[2:43:53] compare the
[2:43:55] teachings of
[2:43:57] certain other
[2:43:59] groups and the reason I bring up other
[2:44:02] groups and I'm sure as everybody's
[2:44:05] listening I'm glad that everybody's
[2:44:07] listening and I'm glad that I can speak
[2:44:09] to people that are
[2:44:11] quiet because it doesn't bother me
[2:44:15] [Applause]
[2:44:19] I overcame that long
[2:44:21] ago you know I was trying to impress
[2:44:24] everybody you know when the Holy Ghost
[2:44:26] comes you don't care who is
[2:44:28] there you don't care
[2:44:32] amen
[2:44:34] listen what was the apostles
[2:44:43] theme now this theme does not change
[2:44:46] from age to age
[2:44:49] brother brandham says here in the
[2:44:52] token now the spirit is the
[2:44:55] token you shall be filled with the Holy
[2:44:59] Ghost not many days
[2:45:02] hence and when the blood was shed the
[2:45:06] token was sent down on the day of
[2:45:09] Pentecost like a Russian Mighty win
[2:45:15] [Applause]
[2:45:22] here's the next uh he said that was the
[2:45:25] theme of every
[2:45:29] [Applause]
[2:45:31] Apostle not some
[2:45:34] Apostles now how could that
[2:45:37] change the original Pentecostal
[2:45:40] experience the original Pentecostal
[2:45:44] Apostles how could that change to say
[2:45:46] look I denounce this and I denounced
[2:45:48] that I denounce this experience I
[2:45:50] denounce that the Holy Ghost is no long
[2:45:53] look we are the Holy Ghost how on Earth
[2:45:55] can you be the Holy
[2:46:04] Ghost can you be the Holy
[2:46:07] Ghost to be the holy ghost means that
[2:46:09] you're
[2:46:11] God the
[2:46:13] word hallelujah you cannot be the Holy
[2:46:17] Ghost the Holy Ghost dwells in
[2:46:21] man you are a sinner saved by
[2:46:31] grace and any man that says such a thing
[2:46:34] so boldly should get out of the pulpit
[2:46:38] cuz they lack the Holy Ghost
[2:46:42] [Applause]
[2:46:45] [Music]
[2:46:49] listen there's something Apostolic
[2:46:52] moving in me
[2:46:54] now that will reject that
[2:46:59] teaching get back to the Cross what on
[2:47:03] Earth do they know about the Holy Ghost
[2:47:04] if they've never experienced the Holy
[2:47:07] Ghost say I denounce this Holy Ghost
[2:47:10] listen the Holy Ghost poured out in
[2:47:13] every age let me tell you something let
[2:47:16] me tell you something what brother Bram
[2:47:17] said in in Ephesus they had their
[2:47:21] mechanics and Dynamics together virtue
[2:47:24] they had the mechanics and Dynamics
[2:47:25] together all the way up mechanics and
[2:47:28] Dynamics together and you say we can't
[2:47:30] have that you are
[2:47:35] [Music]
[2:47:37] false because Apostles will still preach
[2:47:41] the Holy Ghost by experience because it
[2:47:44] was a theme of every apostle
[2:47:51] [Applause]
[2:48:02] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[2:48:04] you
[2:48:05] [Applause]
[2:48:09] believe well well you see now we are the
[2:48:12] Holy Ghost now because we have a
[2:48:13] different we have a different Holy Ghost
[2:48:17] in This age Hallelujah
[2:48:19] watch the
[2:48:23] salesman watch those
[2:48:28] salesman the next the next you're going
[2:48:30] to hear is like if you call now we'll
[2:48:33] add
[2:48:34] more that's a
[2:48:38] salesperson have no business behind a
[2:48:41] Pulpit not in this day and
[2:48:46] age the thing is is is because we're
[2:48:50] coming to the
[2:48:52] truth the
[2:48:54] real so the devil's trying to cut
[2:48:58] off the holy ghost in the
[2:49:01] church to make this church
[2:49:05] stumble what did Brother brandham say
[2:49:08] when he was speaking about the Statue of
[2:49:10] perfect man he said he saw scrap heaps
[2:49:13] of ministers on the side of the road
[2:49:17] [Music]
[2:49:19] why because they went into it
[2:49:22] [Applause]
[2:49:26] incorrectly is that
[2:49:28] gospel scrap
[2:49:30] heaps so if there's an incorrect
[2:49:34] way there is a correct
[2:49:37] [Applause]
[2:49:45] way I said Lord help me every day
[2:49:49] let me never change my
[2:49:53] message because I know what the power of
[2:49:56] God can
[2:49:57] do I know what the power of God can do
[2:50:01] I've seen young people I've seen young
[2:50:03] people that have a tremendous
[2:50:05] breakthrough years ago and they're still
[2:50:08] serving the lord
[2:50:10] today the Holy Ghost keeps you
[2:50:20] some ran through walls some knocked over
[2:50:23] chairs and everything else and they're
[2:50:25] gone today that don't mean nothing you
[2:50:28] can run all you
[2:50:30] want I'm not talking about running I'm
[2:50:32] talking about getting the Holy Ghost In
[2:50:33] Your Heart the
[2:50:37] anchor that
[2:50:39] holds
[2:50:42] Hallelujah don't let the
[2:50:45] devil sell you that it's
[2:50:52] false
[2:50:54] [Applause]
[2:50:55] hallu now I'm going to
[2:50:58] close I'm G to close what time okay I'm
[2:51:00] going to close now it's getting late now
[2:51:03] I I have I just have two more things to
[2:51:07] say why why do I say that is brother BR
[2:51:11] says see without the baptism of the Holy
[2:51:14] Ghost you're only guessing at it
[2:51:20] you have a lot of ministers
[2:51:22] guessing trying to figure out
[2:51:25] mechanics and then they you know how
[2:51:28] brother R said when you're doing your
[2:51:29] types and things make sure the cow don't
[2:51:31] end up on top of the
[2:51:33] tree and they see the cow on top of the
[2:51:36] tree they still
[2:51:37] continue they preach the cow on top of
[2:51:40] the
[2:51:41] tree but the real believer knows that
[2:51:43] the cow belongs on the
[2:51:46] ground hallah and there's a holy ghost
[2:51:49] filter that tells you know that Crow
[2:51:51] belongs on the
[2:51:53] ground amen we don't have to be enemy
[2:51:55] but I don't believe
[2:51:58] that get the get the cow back on the
[2:52:02] ground and then maybe we can continue
[2:52:04] see without the Holy Ghost they're only
[2:52:07] guessing and we see a lot of people
[2:52:09] guessing because theyve never had that
[2:52:12] genuine experience the backside of the
[2:52:15] desert Moses ran away from his
[2:52:17] Commission why he had no power he didn't
[2:52:21] have an experience amen he tried in his
[2:52:24] own ability to do what his parents said
[2:52:29] his mom told him that he was born a
[2:52:32] special child and he tried in his own
[2:52:34] and all he could do is slay
[2:52:37] one
[2:52:41] man and after slain that one man he ran
[2:52:43] for his life fear
[2:52:46] struck and Moses Mo thought that God
[2:52:50] forgot Moses head as far as he could
[2:52:53] hide but God knew exactly where he was
[2:52:56] at and I'm going to tell you something
[2:52:59] if God has predestinated you to do
[2:53:00] something stop trying to
[2:53:04] hide Moses wasted 40 Years of his life
[2:53:08] hiding meanwhile God knew where he was
[2:53:10] at all the
[2:53:14] time you'll save time your time God's
[2:53:18] time he said because God is going to
[2:53:20] catch you God is going to find you and
[2:53:23] bring you
[2:53:25] back after he gave you an experience in
[2:53:28] the backside of the
[2:53:30] desert then you can go and face pharaoh
[2:53:33] who you ran away
[2:53:34] from
[2:53:36] Hallelujah brother Bram said he come
[2:53:38] down a oneman
[2:53:40] army Pharaoh didn't see what was behind
[2:53:43] him but behind Moses was the armies of
[2:53:46] the Living God Hallelujah he had a
[2:53:49] little stick in his hand but he took
[2:53:52] over because he was commissioned to take
[2:53:56] over he had that experience he didn't
[2:54:00] have it before but he had an experience
[2:54:02] then he knew what he was talking
[2:54:05] about and when he went down to Pharaoh
[2:54:07] now remember when you have an experience
[2:54:10] genuine experience and you know where
[2:54:11] you're standing there's no go no
[2:54:15] negotiation Pharaoh said let your
[2:54:17] children stay back no this is not a
[2:54:21] negotiation I'm taking I'm taking my
[2:54:24] children I'm taking my family I'm taking
[2:54:25] my wife I'm taking my father I'm taking
[2:54:28] my uh I'm taking
[2:54:33] everybody I'm not leaving a hoof
[2:54:37] behind Pharaoh you're not in position to
[2:54:42] negotiate because greater is he that's
[2:54:45] in
[2:54:46] me Hallelujah
[2:54:48] [Applause]
[2:54:51] he came back with hidden power
[2:54:54] hallelujah
[2:54:55] amen now this this is what I want to
[2:54:59] finish with I'm closing now I'm done I'm
[2:55:02] sorry it kept you longer than expected
[2:55:05] but listen the message I believe got
[2:55:08] home and I this this is this is what I
[2:55:11] want you to be very careful be very very
[2:55:15] careful because this has happened and is
[2:55:19] happening
[2:55:22] now brother brandham warns us in
[2:55:25] questions and
[2:55:26] answers he said God has a hard time to
[2:55:30] get
[2:55:31] somebody that he can deal with that'll
[2:55:35] stay
[2:55:39] humble hard
[2:55:42] time they're rare they're hard to
[2:55:47] find but the truth is if you want to be
[2:55:49] a candidate you've got to humble
[2:55:56] yourself uh that'll stay humble and meek
[2:55:59] and stay in place until God calls
[2:56:03] him to do something he said you believe
[2:56:07] you see that a man that God can bless
[2:56:11] and he'll still keep himself a
[2:56:15] man not an angel
[2:56:23] H you you've heard people say oh you
[2:56:26] left the angel what Angel you talking
[2:56:29] about we have the message we've stayed
[2:56:33] with the Angel's message what Angel you
[2:56:36] talking
[2:56:37] about have you become an angel overnight
[2:56:39] I don't understand maybe you have see a
[2:56:42] man that God can bless and he still
[2:56:46] keeps himself a man not an angel or a
[2:56:52] God as soon as man gets blessed and has
[2:56:57] a little something given to him he wants
[2:57:01] to become a
[2:57:07] God he wants to become an
[2:57:11] Angel that's where we have the
[2:57:14] problem you have to humble yourself and
[2:57:16] watch these guys
[2:57:19] watch these guys that talk about angels
[2:57:21] and things like that you you left the
[2:57:23] angel I didn't leave no angel or you
[2:57:26] kidding me the angel promised to go with
[2:57:28] me amen uh God promis to go with me till
[2:57:32] the end of the
[2:57:33] world Amen he said he'll never leave me
[2:57:36] nor forsake
[2:57:38] [Applause]
[2:57:43] me I know this is direct but it needs to
[2:57:46] be done and I may as I said
[2:57:48] this is my last service I'll say it last
[2:57:51] quote and I'm gone amen as soon as man
[2:57:55] gets blessed and has a little something
[2:57:57] given to him he'll want to become a God
[2:58:00] and he wants to become an angel he wants
[2:58:02] to become some great person me and all
[2:58:07] uh uh see and he said me and all he said
[2:58:11] see that's wrong the wrong attitude God
[2:58:14] is hunting right now God is hunting for
[2:58:18] somebody he could uh bless and pour out
[2:58:22] the blessings and the more He blesses
[2:58:25] listen and the more He blesses the
[2:58:28] little uh the man will
[2:58:36] become
[2:58:38] I am not telling a story this
[2:58:43] is
[2:58:46] truth you have people people in churches
[2:58:50] that chant the pastor's name and this
[2:58:53] and that and this and that you you know
[2:58:56] you know I I don't even have chant the
[2:58:58] pastor's name and the Pastor's going
[2:59:00] around like oh my
[2:59:04] God
[2:59:07] God you have others that claim they're
[2:59:10] an
[2:59:11] angel you if you leave me you leave the
[2:59:14] angel
[2:59:20] I'm glad I left you years
[2:59:23] ago and I don't feel bad about it you
[2:59:27] know why because when I left that in
[2:59:31] fact I wasn't really really really into
[2:59:34] that but you're trying to sell me that
[2:59:36] I'm so glad that when he showed me that
[2:59:40] then he promised God promised he'll be
[2:59:43] with
[2:59:44] me even in me to the end of the world
[2:59:49] I don't need amen and then you hear all
[2:59:53] kinds of things I'm not going to say no
[2:59:54] more I'm
[2:59:55] finish but if we as Ministers of the
[3:00:00] Gospel we have a
[3:00:01] responsibility humble
[3:00:03] ourselves let God use you
[3:00:07] Hallelujah let God use you cuz he wants
[3:00:10] to use
[3:00:12] you God wants to bring forth a fivefold
[3:00:19] Ministry with the power of almighty
[3:00:23] God Amen just like I said when they
[3:00:27] speak it'll happen because it's not them
[3:00:29] speaking it's God speaking through
[3:00:32] them but they have gone through the
[3:00:35] process of humility they have gone
[3:00:37] through the process and they know amen
[3:00:39] whatever God does amen he gets the glory
[3:00:44] and the honor amen and I have been to
[3:00:47] different places and so forth and by the
[3:00:49] grace of God I preach messages amen and
[3:00:53] I am I go home to my wife and family and
[3:00:58] I you
[3:00:59] know all glory be to
[3:01:03] God I don't build this is why I like as
[3:01:06] I said I don't see our precious brother
[3:01:09] o building any Kingdom this is why I
[3:01:12] come year after year after
[3:01:14] year I agree Hallelujah
[3:01:18] I can
[3:01:19] identify with the
[3:01:21] vision he's trying to get the people
[3:01:24] together Amen to bring them to a place
[3:01:28] amen where they can receive the Holy
[3:01:30] Ghost the fullness of the Holy
[3:01:33] Ghost and this could be that
[3:01:39] meeting

[3:03:52] be more humbler I want to be more
[3:03:56] Meek because he can only operate in that
[3:04:00] realm he cannot operate in hate he
[3:04:04] cannot operate in uh brother bam said
[3:04:08] when he saw and was transformed over to
[3:04:11] the other side he said nothing but

[3:04:33] us more I believe he can but remember
[3:04:37] what if he answers your prayer what did
[3:04:42] Brother Stefan said I'm not the
[3:04:46] one I was just there when he did
[3:04:49] it that's a humble
