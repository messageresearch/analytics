[21:56] welcome
[21:56] if of your Bibles I like it a turn to
[21:59] Acts chapter 19 the wall I read verse 1
[22:01] to 6 I want to read Matthew chapter 5
[22:06] one verse verse six and also Matthew
[22:08] chapter 25
[22:10] really from who's wanted the team first
[22:13] quickly reading tonight
[22:17] reading from acts 19 first one came the
[22:22] past while Apollo's was at Corinth Paul
[22:24] having passed through the upper course
[22:26] to came to Ephesus and financed certain
[22:28] disciples he said unto them have you
[22:30] received the Holy Ghost since he
[22:31] believed and they said to him we have
[22:33] not so much as food
[22:35] any illegals he said unto them under
[22:38] what then were you baptized they said
[22:39] unto John baptism and then said Paul
[22:42] then said paul john verily baptized with
[22:45] the baptism of repentance seen and unto
[22:47] the people that they should believe on
[22:49] him which should come after him that is
[22:51] on christ jesus and when they heard this
[22:54] they were baptized in the name of the
[22:56] lord jesus and when paul had laid his
[22:58] hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on
[23:00] them and they speak with tongues and
[23:03] prophesied so this Holy Ghost that came
[23:05] upon him was an experience that he
[23:06] received it was an explanation it was
[23:09] not teaching it was not edification and
[23:10] trying to show them what inside of them
[23:12] it was an experience that I receive and
[23:14] from Matthew 5:6 he said blessed Adi
[23:17] which do hunger and thirst after
[23:19] righteousness for they shall be filled
[23:24] our last scripture from chapter 25 of
[23:27] Matthew then shall the Kingdom of Heaven
[23:29] be likened unto ten virgins which took
[23:32] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[23:34] bridegroom five of them Elias five of
[23:36] foolish D that were foolish took their
[23:38] lamps and took no oil with them but the
[23:41] wise took oil in their vessels with
[23:43] their lamps while the bridegroom tarried
[23:45] and the oil slumbered and slept at
[23:47] midnight there was a cry made behold the
[23:49] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[23:52] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[23:54] their lamps and the foolish said unto
[23:55] the wise give us of your oil for our
[23:58] lamps are gone out but the wise answered
[24:01] and said saying not so pleased there not
[24:04] enough for us and you but go ye rather
[24:07] to them that sell and buy for yourselves
[24:09] and while they went to buy the
[24:11] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[24:14] they that were ready went in with him to
[24:17] the marriage and a door was shut
[24:19] afterwards came also the other virgins
[24:21] in Lord Lord open to us but he answered
[24:24] and said verily unto you I know you not
[24:27] watch therefore for you know neither the
[24:30] day nor the hour wherein the Son of man
[24:33] cometh may God bless his word you may be
[24:35] seated
[24:36] or praise the Lord yes aw
[24:39] always a privilege for me to be in the
[24:43] house of God first I come into God's
[24:44] presence and be looking forward to see
[24:47] what low' will do
[24:47] tonight our title tonight bright
[24:50] material wise vigils strange combination
[24:54] of words but which see what will or will
[24:56] do bright material wise verges have a
[24:59] context scripture and this is from Acts
[25:02] chapter 5 eat by reading from verse 5
[25:04] Acts chapter 8 from verse 5 then Philip
[25:08] went down to the city of Samaria and
[25:09] preached Christ unto them what did he
[25:12] preached Christ unto them and the people
[25:15] with one Accord give heed unto those
[25:18] things which Philip speak hearing and
[25:21] seeing the miracles which he did for
[25:25] unclean spirits crime but a loud voice
[25:28] came out of many that were possessed
[25:30] with them and many taken with policies
[25:33] and that will lean were healed and there
[25:37] was great joy in that city so this was
[25:41] hopeful it was preaching the gospel this
[25:43] is all the world was being confirmed
[25:44] this is all the acts 16 was getting into
[25:46] accent oh praise got another scripture
[25:49] we harvest from sin john 12 verse 22 24
[25:53] and there was it in Greeks among them
[25:56] that came up to worship at the feast the
[25:58] same came there for the philip which was
[26:01] of the taste of galilee and desired him
[26:03] saying sir we would see Jesus and Philip
[26:05] cometh and telleth Andrew and Andrew and
[26:07] Philip tell jesus and jesus answered
[26:09] them saying they always come that the
[26:12] Son of man should be glorified verily
[26:15] well I sent you except a corner wheat
[26:17] fall into the ground and die it a battle
[26:19] own but if I died bring it forth much
[26:22] fruit oh praise God so he ready to smoke
[26:25] tonight okay let's go no this is from
[26:30] silver see Jesus where I'm saying some
[26:32] stuff he said knowing that there was
[26:33] some God somewhere told many Greeks and
[26:36] they had thousands of them that they
[26:37] worshipped the hood of a historical quad
[26:40] that none miracles and among the Hebrews
[26:42] and I also heard that this God
[26:44] that used to be a miracle book in Hebrew
[26:46] God was over here in the land with them
[26:48] again so it attracted the attention so
[26:52] they came to see Jesus now notice
[26:54] usually the way people want to find
[26:57] Jesus is to find somebody who knows how
[27:00] to take them to him a leader or one of
[27:03] his servants is do we define him there
[27:06] we go
[27:06] so Jesus if he ever chooses a servant he
[27:10] always chooses somebody that will bring
[27:14] the people to him because it is his
[27:17] purpose to serve the people now they
[27:19] brought unto his presence and I guess
[27:22] into his presence these Greeks Philip
[27:24] they consulted Philip and Philip said no
[27:26] here is someone that wants to see our
[27:28] Lord so it wouldn't be just right for me
[27:30] to have the honor to introduce these
[27:32] Greece to my lord I'll go get Alan's you
[27:34] to go with me
[27:35] so they went got Andrew Andrew and
[27:37] Philip boat came and presented these
[27:39] Greeks to Jesus now here is a greeting
[27:42] and a text that's unusual just as soon
[27:45] as these Greeks was pointed to Jesus
[27:47] Jesus did not point to himself oh this
[27:53] is big you know I know you notice
[27:55] already but this is what Jesus did not
[27:58] point to himself nor did he make himself
[28:01] known to them because you cannot know
[28:04] Jesus in that way jesus is known in that
[28:09] way we see in the scripture that when
[28:12] these Greeks brought brought up to Jesus
[28:14] and won in his presence it looked like
[28:16] Jesus could have said well I am the
[28:18] Messiah of Jewish race has been
[28:20] predicted by the prophets by inspiration
[28:22] down to the cemeteries and I am here now
[28:25] and I am born of Nazareth I'm a Jewish
[28:27] of a Jewish mother my father is God I'm
[28:29] here to make myself known to you Greeks
[28:31] no that would be more like the 1961
[28:34] version of it but look as soon here we
[28:38] go as they are brought in his presence
[28:40] that's the main thing get the people in
[28:44] his presence and as soon as in his
[28:48] presence jesus said except a corn of
[28:51] wheat falls into the ground and die it
[28:53] abideth on what an unusual thing instead
[28:58] of accepting the introduction the thing
[29:00] he done was to point them to the place
[29:02] where they could find him
[29:05] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[29:07] ground and die it abides alone what did
[29:10] he do here he pointed them to that great
[29:12] truth how to see him they could not see
[29:16] him in the way of eternal life just
[29:17] stand-in there though he was he was a
[29:19] man but he pointed them dear in his
[29:22] presence Christ pointed them to the
[29:24] truth he said to see him was to go to
[29:27] the cross that is where it is at at the
[29:30] cross except a corner it falls in is a
[29:34] basil oil and if he did not die he would
[29:36] have to abide alone himself if he did
[29:39] not die but him being a corner week that
[29:42] fell into the ground and then if it
[29:43] falls him to the ground he said it will
[29:45] bring forth abundance it will fall into
[29:48] the ground and dies first
[29:50] it had to be a zoomit eyes green or
[29:52] glory to God what he meant is watch if I
[29:55] live my life alone and die this way I
[29:58] just live my life alone well then there
[30:00] is no food after me here we go I already
[30:02] but if I fall into the ground under the
[30:05] will of God
[30:06] I will bring forth a new bullet and that
[30:12] new birth will bring forth another
[30:14] nobility and another new birth until the
[30:17] whole world will be missionary and
[30:19] gospel preached so he was pointing them
[30:23] that the cross will produce the new
[30:26] birth because his water blood and spirit
[30:31] said of cross will release the
[30:35] ingredients to produce the new built
[30:37] whole glory of God and the new blood
[30:40] spreading from one to another who glory
[30:42] to God so that is right porker asks a
[30:45] question have you received the Holy
[30:47] Ghost since we believe because you're
[30:50] supposed to receive it after you believe
[30:52] or glory to God not when you believe
[30:55] after you believe you receive something
[30:57] to confirm you have faith in what you
[30:59] have received as belief or doodlee that

[44:48] sobota Berlin says them disciples before
[44:53] they did anything they took these Greeks
[44:55] into the presence of Jesus I like that
[44:59] in the presence but in the teaching and
[45:03] the presence
[45:04] I had a doctrine in the book and if you
[45:07] Rosita's this see new fellowship then
[45:10] many presents yet we have not body
[45:13] missing body but not presence Oh
[45:16] hallelujah
[45:18] you see what I'm saying that is si
[45:21] Mussina possible dicey Messina pasta
[45:23] Creed that's the same as Saint eleméry
[45:26] unto our Father that makea Catholic does
[45:30] he say Mass in all of that God want you
[45:32] to come into his presence not the
[45:35] presence of the pastor his presence the

[45:46] Oh glory to God hallelujah
[45:51] Oh glory to God let's go watch and they

[45:57] Jesus and if he's the same like Obama if
[46:00] he's the same yes is them forever he
[46:02] will have to act the same today if you
[46:06] are brought into his presence disciples
[46:10] today is so much different today they
[46:13] bring you to some other place to some
[46:16] church some organization some doctrine
[46:19] laws we believe it so watch but never
[46:23] get you into the presence of Christ
[46:25] there we go
[46:26] almost done this afoot in part a real
[46:29] true disciple would bring you right
[46:31] straight into the presence of Christ are
[46:34] you ready and from dear Christ will show
[46:38] you what you had to do
[46:47] alright let's cut you know so we could
[46:52] get you here question but a Balam are
[46:56] the five foolish virgins of much each
[46:58] one if I counted as the Gentile remnant
[47:00] I understand that the five foolish
[47:02] virgins were saved but have to go
[47:04] through the great revelation period is
[47:06] this correct if so what will be the
[47:09] final destination could there be the
[47:11] sheet that was divided from goats and
[47:13] matter 25 worms it a pretty good to loot
[47:17] illusion you see he said now that they
[47:24] are the remnant the sleeping version is
[47:26] the remnant spoke of in Revelation of
[47:28] the woman's seed that keeps the
[47:31] commandments of God and have the
[47:33] testimony of Jesus Christ
[47:35] a woman will take a piece of goods which
[47:38] clot and lay it down and she takes a
[47:42] pattern unless anywhere she desires
[47:47] which way she's going to cut that and
[47:49] then when she has left overs call the
[47:52] remnant but she chooses to cut it from a
[47:56] certain place by our own free thinking
[48:00] but what is left over is called the
[48:02] remnant and if you noticed that there
[48:05] were five foolish and five wise virgins
[48:07] all of them was virgins made out of the
[48:10] same material but by election here we go
[48:14] God chooses bride by election before the
[48:20] foundation of the world
[48:22] hallelujah put their names on the Lamb's
[48:25] Book of Life slain from before the from
[48:27] this world before the world ever began
[48:30] the day in the funeral that I did the
[48:32] money I was talking about considering
[48:36] the end he said the Bible said that at
[48:39] the end of something than the beginning
[48:41] hallelujah and to consider the end in
[48:45] your decisions and actions consider the
[48:48] end game where you want to end up what
[48:50] the end will be is not where you start
[48:52] because because Joseph started kicked
[48:55] oten and
[48:56] and shunned by his brothers but he ended
[48:58] up as the right hand of Pharaoh Oh glory
[49:01] to God David was a shepherd boy that's
[49:04] when he stopped but he ended up being
[49:05] king of Israel
[49:06] it's not like your status not where you
[49:08] are is very gonna end so you have to
[49:10] consider help me turn on my DS I can on
[49:12] my end but God knows that for the
[49:14] beginning he stuff on the end he know
[49:16] that's why you can say all he foreknew
[49:18] he call or we call it justified all each
[49:20] other he know where you're going already
[49:21] hot already glorified so he finishes
[49:24] already and then coming the beginning
[49:26] and start the story then Satan is
[49:29] trapped because he don't understand it's
[49:31] finished already
[49:32] okay the Lord has shout because he
[49:34] starts at the end Oh Gloria already in
[49:37] the Millennium y'all ready inner city
[49:39] you already have a new body Oh
[49:41] everything is covered already already
[49:42] glorified I mean coming back and roll
[49:44] back the tape here and put you to
[49:46] struggle so God is not rolling dice I
[49:59] saw quad I hope you make it I want to
[50:01] look tonight not because he way they
[50:02] behaved last night no no Gordon up that
[50:04] kind of right mode God know the end from
[50:06] the beginning
[50:07] well glory to God if Israel were to
[50:09] consider their behavior they never they
[50:11] never said we can take it or glory does
[50:14] God didn't understand why bring them out
[50:16] the same father brought him out judge
[50:17] them because it wasn't consider the end
[50:19] and the Bible said decent happen for
[50:21] examples for whom the ends of the world
[50:23] are come or glory the costs and learn
[50:26] from their behavior learn from the
[50:28] attitude not God is a good God all the
[50:30] time that's a phrase what is the core of
[50:32] the word Oh hallelujah Oh get a lot of
[50:35] shout praise God praise God hallelujah
[50:39] little chorus not him who starts and
[50:42] finishes these little sprit is a long
[50:45] distant race is yourself
[50:48] Gloria don't have patience with God have
[50:50] patience with yourself pace yourself
[50:52] this race is not for the Swift but him
[50:55] doesn't go on to the end or glory that
[50:58] God be in for the long haul
[51:01] that's right be not tired
[51:03] dice why be not weary that's why we
[51:06] could stand on after the promise of God
[51:07] to on the leaf but stronger than praise
[51:10] for God because we in this thing for the
[51:12] long haul
[51:13] we're not looking for shortcuts there
[51:15] are no shortcuts you have to die to
[51:17] yourself or - oh we don't want a
[51:25] shortcut I believed if I have it as a

[1:06:38] do you understand the bride is second
[1:06:41] Peter 147 and the church is 1784 heavy
[1:06:45] and high-minded demolition spirits the
[1:06:49] bride spirit is full to knowledge
[1:06:51] temperance peace that's the bride ear
[1:06:53] that's the bright material well glory
[1:06:56] there go that's what God cotton just
[1:07:00] remembers be heady highminded lovers of
[1:07:03] pleasure more than lovers gone cheese
[1:07:04] because in the church Liars in the
[1:07:06] church in the church jealous people in
[1:07:10] the church back biters in the church
[1:07:12] wreath disrespectful in the search
[1:07:28] a great solution came to me early and
[1:07:32] said I believe God it was imputed on
[1:07:36] differences I said that is true he said
[1:07:39] what more can a man do by belief I said
[1:07:42] that's all he could do he said but where
[1:07:44] do you go for this Holy Ghost stuff
[1:07:46] I've said that that no you know he was a
[1:07:49] Baptist he said where do you go with his
[1:07:52] Holy Ghost if a man believed the minute
[1:07:54] you believe you poverty believers
[1:07:56] I said no no you make a contradiction in
[1:08:02] the scriptures the Scriptures no
[1:08:04] contradict themselves Paul asked them
[1:08:07] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:08:10] you believed I said it's true Abraham
[1:08:13] the father of faith he had promise of
[1:08:15] calm believe God it was imprisoned him
[1:08:16] for righteousness but he give him the
[1:08:18] seal of circumcision as a sign that he
[1:08:22] had received his fate and if he have
[1:08:25] never sealed you with the Holy Ghost yet
[1:08:27] he's never received your faith in him
[1:08:29] you've got some loose places you might
[1:08:32] believe but there's a lot of loose
[1:08:33] places but when you get all the book
[1:08:35] news places back right then he sees
[1:08:37] where the Holy Ghost until the day of
[1:08:39] your Redemption that is God's
[1:08:41] confirmation that he has received the
[1:08:43] faith that you possess in him professing
[1:08:46] him
[1:08:46] oh my the church will see with that
[1:08:51] Dogma this is not good this is not good
[1:08:53] when God gives you the Holy Ghost it is
[1:08:56] settled you know where you stand you
[1:08:59] know what happened you are sealed all
[1:09:02] the day totality of your Redemption your
[1:09:05] destination on this earthly journey that
[1:09:07] oughta make anybody just have faith and
[1:09:09] believe God and rise up in the power of
[1:09:11] the Spirit
[1:09:12] now these versions did not get the Holy
[1:09:14] Spirit the only thing the luck was all
[1:09:17] in their lamps they had the books they
[1:09:19] had the mysteries they had the knowledge
[1:09:21] they had all knowledge but not the oil
[1:09:27] they had the best dishes they had the
[1:09:32] greatest revelations but not the oil
[1:09:38] some bring any always a different
[1:09:40] ingredient and yet the word is spirit
[1:09:45] and the spirit is life you know why they
[1:09:50] couldn't get the oil because the word of
[1:09:52] the Spirit is what they rejected and
[1:09:55] last service I quoted it for you my
[1:09:58] voice was gone I didn't have it here
[1:10:00] tonight to see it back but he says the
[1:10:02] church the bride that rejected the head
[1:10:05] pact of the bride would have to suffer
[1:10:08] it if that be so then the thunders
[1:10:13] capped the pyramid then the seven
[1:10:16] thunders is the head part of that the
[1:10:20] seven thunders is in the Holy Spirit
[1:10:22] slot beneath that is the seven churches
[1:10:24] but God put that slot there and LOV is
[1:10:28] Christ coopera body coming down and then
[1:10:31] on it is his spirit coming you have to
[1:10:33] be caught up into this spirit soul hours
[1:10:39] you are you have to be magnetized not by
[1:10:41] teaching but by the Holy Ghost the
[1:10:44] teacher has to become spirit in you then
[1:10:46] you become magnetized so when the brain
[1:10:48] love Divine magnatum
[1:10:49] it will pick you up take you up it's not
[1:10:52] coming for you it's coming for the same
[1:10:54] material you are thoroughly magnetized
[1:10:59] to the headstone
[1:11:03] Magne capita paper magnet capita wood
[1:11:07] magnet capita plastic it could only pick
[1:11:09] up the metal that is magnet I say it
[1:11:12] so whatever whatever inside of you your
[1:11:16] flasher on it has to go through so when
[1:11:19] God come you've got to be raptured
[1:11:20] because this power is inside of you
[1:11:24] that's why I said a rapture gonna be in
[1:11:26] you you're not going to the rapture whoo
[1:11:28] glory bells got the rapture will be in
[1:11:30] you you'll be changed in a moment what's
[1:11:32] on the inside gonna change what's on the
[1:11:34] outside no church to give it out let's
[1:11:46] continue you see they were back in the
[1:11:55] church age there were some of them there
[1:11:57] was good people but it wasn't in this
[1:12:00] night they would whip with the wick
[1:12:03] dipped into oilman it was out it was
[1:12:06] gone out they had separated themselves
[1:12:08] Paul said and he give a scripture for
[1:12:11] that he said they separate themselves
[1:12:13] from us
[1:12:14] seemingly not have any feet so when they
[1:12:19] walk out and they turn on the feet and
[1:12:21] you know what get feet right seven
[1:12:22] thunders give feet seven thunders devoid
[1:12:24] right so they will hurry from the faith
[1:12:26] and they don't understand they will hold
[1:12:28] from the channel to access the oil
[1:12:33] they love the Prophet they love the
[1:12:35] message they love the books they love
[1:12:37] what they're hearing and love the
[1:12:38] bredrin but they do have any oil not
[1:12:42] make them a foolish virgin certified
[1:12:46] people nice people to hug and laugh and
[1:12:49] fellowship with all night long but no
[1:12:51] oil it's not something now notice this
[1:13:04] virgin she went into we pinwheel in
[1:13:06] national tea let me say this my precious

[1:15:57] to that Great Commission or glory of God
[1:16:00] go to all the world and preach the
[1:16:01] gospel which is the good news that
[1:16:05] Christ is not dead he's raised from the
[1:16:07] dead and if he raised from the dead we
[1:16:09] could prove it we could show it we could
[1:16:11] demonstrate it we can make it manifest
[1:16:13] because that is why he raised from the

[1:25:03] for me wrap up here all right Jesus live
[1:25:24] in a world that no one note about here's
[1:25:27] an odd person he lived in a wool of
[1:25:29] perfect feet and a perfect God but she
[1:25:31] was he if we lived in a perfect faith of
[1:25:33] a Christian to what we are will be
[1:25:35] mystic to the world the people wouldn't
[1:25:37] understand you you would walk in the
[1:25:39] spirit what the spirit said you would do
[1:25:41] what it forbid you will not do see
[1:25:43] that's the way it has to be all
[1:25:45] believers they are mystic the people
[1:25:47] don't understand because they live in a
[1:25:48] world to themselves Jesus live in a
[1:25:50] world nobody else could touch the
[1:25:52] disciples couldn't understand him when
[1:25:54] he spoke to them he said they use
[1:25:56] riddles you see so when a man
[1:25:58] here we go lives by faith walks by faith
[1:26:02] I mean substance faith so he's bringing
[1:26:05] it that you were going to do reality
[1:26:07] live by faith walk by faith then he
[1:26:09] defines it substance feet he is isolated
[1:26:12] from the entire world and becomes a new
[1:26:14] creature in Christ dear now you are
[1:26:18] getting into bright material there is
[1:26:27] where you getting into bright material
[1:26:30] see see you see all the intellectual
[1:26:32] thing for example
[1:26:33] brahmam servicing was 65 he said I
[1:26:35] believe the church has been hearing a
[1:26:38] message intellectually he said but your
[1:26:40] feet isn't ripe enough you have to lay
[1:26:43] in his presence until your feet becomes
[1:26:46] ripe so he understood that what he was
[1:26:49] presenting to them was hitting them at
[1:26:52] the intellectual level but he understood
[1:26:54] that it will take presence to get defeat
[1:26:57] into ripeness do you understand that
[1:27:02] it will take what presence to get the
[1:27:06] fit into rightness now watch this
[1:27:08] he said no minutes ago very revival they
[1:27:11] don't pack it with them it you revive I
[1:27:13] have to come from the people so the
[1:27:16] people have to get the vision that they
[1:27:18] could see to run right the vision make
[1:27:24] it plain that he that readeth may run so
[1:27:27] it means somewhere along the line this
[1:27:29] vision has to be activated into you to
[1:27:32] push you into action and don't leave the
[1:27:34] burden to the minister because he can
[1:27:37] bring the revival when you see it you
[1:27:39] could run with it when you could see it
[1:27:42] you will pray on it when you see it
[1:27:43] you'll fast and you will be twisting and
[1:27:45] hungry for it and when you see it you
[1:27:47] will see a revival brick in your home
[1:27:49] your house and in the church you will
[1:27:50] bring the revival from your home to this
[1:27:52] church or chlorine accordion we have a

[1:27:56] explode and what do you think gonna
[1:28:00] happen the power of this children to
