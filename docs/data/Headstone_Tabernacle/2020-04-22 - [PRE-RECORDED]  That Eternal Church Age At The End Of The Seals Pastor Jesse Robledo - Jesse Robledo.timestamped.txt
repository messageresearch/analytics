[52:34] honored amen to be here especially the
[52:38] theme of this convention certainly it
[52:43] when I got the invitation and of course
[52:46] something just struck me and you know as
[52:50] a minister many things just kind of you
[52:53] could reach something and you've heard
[52:55] it many times before but something oh
[52:58] the word of the Lord and due season how
[53:01] good it is praise this wonderful name
[53:04] because we know the time that we are
[53:07] living in time has got to yield and give
[53:12] way to eternity we don't have much more
[53:17] time time as we know it a man will soon
[53:22] amen

[53:28] reason I'm so happy that to be
[53:31] identified with this group amen and my
[53:36] good friend brother Theo Ovid we've been
[53:38] friends for many many years many years

[53:47] earlier years and so forth and I one
[53:49] thing I love about our host pastor here
[53:52] he has no I don't sense no objective no
[53:57] motive
[53:58] no nothing just the motive is just to
[54:00] see just God's people blessed and I am
[54:04] very happy to put my shoulder to the
[54:07] wheel with men like that you see there
[54:12] are too many people that are building
[54:13] their own kingdoms here today
[54:15] hey man but we're not here to build
[54:17] kingdoms we're here to be witnesses amen
[54:20] you see the Holy Ghost was set to be a
[54:24] witness hallelujah without the Holy
[54:29] Ghost you cannot be a witness amen and
[54:32] I'm going to tell you something
[54:34] it's you shall be witnesses unto me and
[54:38] me is the word hallelujah not uh not an
[54:43] interpretation not a man's I did the
[54:46] Holy Ghost will always Amen the Word of
[54:49] God and you recognize it to be the word
[54:53] because a Holy Ghost in you has always
[54:56] got to Amen the Word of God hallelujah
[54:59] to the lamb a man so I'm just so happy
[55:03] to be part of this great gathering here
[55:06] this afternoon or rather this morning
[55:08] amen and I'm sure there are I just want
[55:12] to make something very clear you know
[55:15] because there is a great you know things
[55:20] that goes around that we you know people
[55:23] think they are exclusively bride or they
[55:27] are exclusively this is what you know
[55:30] their God you cannot contain God in this
[55:33] go
[55:34] [Applause]
[55:34] [Music]
[55:36] God is all over the world and I always
[55:41] say you know I remember there was a
[55:42] story that I used to read a genie you
[55:45] know you can't you can't stuff God in a
[55:48] genie bottle and release him when you
[55:50] want him no no no no no our God is a big
[55:55] God hallelujah
[55:58] he is from eternity to eternity praise
[56:02] God hallelujah
[56:05] and he has a pride everywhere hallelujah
[56:10] even if I recognize or know the minister
[56:14] I don't have to know the minister the
[56:17] minister has to know God and God has put
[56:21] in the church some apostles some
[56:24] teachers some evangelists hallelujah
[56:27] that's not the work of man that's a work
[56:29] of God
[56:30] yo repeat Oh God Amen hallelujah oh I
[56:35] feel good this morning hey man
[56:39] hallelujah so I have enjoyed every
[56:41] service and the ministers have testified
[56:44] and preached and surely my heart has
[56:47] been blessed I have no words you know
[56:52] you find try to look for the you know
[56:56] words in the dictionary to properly
[56:59] explain what is going on with the head
[57:02] this is this is unspeakable you can't
[57:06] speak joy unspeakable and full of glory
[57:08] amen so praise this wonderful name I'm
[57:13] so thankful him and I want to thank and
[57:16] take this moment to thank brother ovet
[57:18] for the invitation amen to coming to
[57:23] come back to Trinidad is always a
[57:25] blessing for me to come amen
[57:27] and to share my testimony and my
[57:30] testimony I love this message you know
[57:33] my heart that's my testimony
[57:35] I gave my heart to the Lord when I was
[57:37] 14 years old
[57:39] hey man I've been around the block a
[57:41] little but a few times and so this is my
[57:47] life I have nothing else you know if I
[57:51] would have found something better I
[57:53] would have gone with it
[57:54] amen so I'm 57 now so you can imagine
[57:58] you do the calculation how long I've
[58:00] been around so therefore I have seen
[58:05] many things and one thing that I do
[58:09] appreciate is the sincerity of real God
[58:13] called men their objective their motive
[58:18] is to do their best to get people back
[58:21] to the world back to the Word of God we
[58:28] have received a message in this endtime
[58:31] amen and we now have brother Graham said
[58:35] the perfect interpretation of the word
[58:37] with the line vindication he says a lot
[58:41] of people say that they have the word
[58:43] but you see that's all good but God is
[58:47] going to manifest and prove because the
[58:52] head part can only rest on a true body
[58:56] and that body has got to be the word
[59:00] amen and the head identifies the body as
[59:03] I have often said so you know there are
[59:07] many claims it's ok find it's not a
[59:10] problem I
[59:11] don't argue with no man well the brown
[59:13] said I argued with no man hey man you
[59:16] preach the word and you just go on and
[59:19] love everybody because you see the trial
[59:22] that we many times face today from you
[59:28] know if you don't know a person for
[59:30] example if they run you down it's not a
[59:35] problem you don't know them but it is
[59:38] those that really are your friends and
[59:42] your associates and things and then they
[59:44] that's the challenge you know that's the
[59:48] challenge and we have got to be mature
[59:51] enough and understand that these are
[59:55] trials to mold us and make us to be more
[1:00:01] like Jesus Christ
[1:00:03] a man is written in the scripture where
[1:00:07] did you get these stripes in the house
[1:00:08] of my enemies no friends hey amen so
[1:00:13] praise the Lord I'm so thankful for
[1:00:17] friends should I say that have helped me
[1:00:21] grow in Jesus Christ amen hallow every
[1:00:28] trial every tribulation listen to me
[1:00:32] right here right now nothing happens
[1:00:36] without God permitting it to happen
[1:00:40] and if God has permitted it praise God
[1:00:45] there must be a purpose for it that the
[1:00:49] purpose might be fulfilled and
[1:00:52] accomplished go ribbit Oh God
[1:00:54] you want to have faith and virtue and
[1:00:57] knowledge and temperance God cannot
[1:01:00] listen character is not a gift it is a
[1:01:04] victory you want virtue knowledge
[1:01:07] temperance patience God has special
[1:01:10] design trials for you hallelujah to give
[1:01:13] you the character of Jesus Christ praise
[1:01:17] God hallelujah
[1:01:19] hey man I'm so happy
[1:01:23] whoa blessed be his wonderful name and
[1:01:26] once again brother Ovid your family and
[1:01:29] the entire church I don't ever want to
[1:01:33] be little or or take lightly what has
[1:01:37] gone on behind the scenes because we
[1:01:40] realized that there's a lot of work that
[1:01:43] goes on behind the scenes and I want to
[1:01:48] say from the depths of my heart that I
[1:01:50] that I do appreciate amen all the labors
[1:01:53] of love behind the scenes and they
[1:01:56] brother Ovid I think you've got this
[1:01:58] down to a science you know I mean just a
[1:02:03] smooth check-in and the smooth is just
[1:02:06] so wonderful praise the lord god bless
[1:02:08] you and i appreciate
[1:02:11] men like brother Ovid and the family and
[1:02:16] the church here god bless you richly is
[1:02:19] my prayer you have made us very
[1:02:21] comfortable and welcomed amen so is is
[1:02:27] beyond my expectation and of course we
[1:02:30] say God richly bless you and if I would
[1:02:34] say this very quickly it is you know
[1:02:38] Paul said in Romans chapter 1 and verse
[1:02:42] 8 he said I thank my God through Jesus
[1:02:45] Christ for all that your faith is spoken
[1:02:51] of throughout the whole world your faith
[1:02:55] is spoken throughout the whole world
[1:02:58] amen
[1:02:59] so stay with it it may not be many
[1:03:02] remember Jesus Church wasn't many he had
[1:03:07] 70 and and those 70s couldn't really
[1:03:12] accept the Word of God amen and when he
[1:03:17] turned over to Peter will you go also a
[1:03:21] Peter had a man eternal life in him he
[1:03:26] had representation glory be to God he
[1:03:31] said where can I go I've gone everywhere
[1:03:36] where can I go so you alone have the
[1:03:39] words of eternal life and that's just
[1:03:42] the way I feel this message is correct
[1:03:46] praise God that's my testimony don't be
[1:03:51] to God I don't have to argue with nobody
[1:03:53] praise this wonderful name thank you
[1:03:56] brother Chandler amen representation by
[1:03:59] predestination hallelujah
[1:04:02] [Applause]
[1:04:04] my my you know if you don't have
[1:04:07] representation Amen and this day and age
[1:04:10] I doubt very much if you'll get too far
[1:04:14] you see because it's the grace of
[1:04:16] Almighty God it's nothing that we have
[1:04:19] done amen
[1:04:21] tell me what righteousness have you done
[1:04:23] to earn what you have here today
[1:04:26] absolutely nothing and I'm so thankful
[1:04:29] that you know we have not chosen God he
[1:04:33] has chosen us a man and we're not
[1:04:36] holding on to God he's holding on to us
[1:04:38] we don't have the strength to hold on to
[1:04:41] God glory be to God and I'm so thankful
[1:04:44] and that's why the scripture says all
[1:04:47] that the father has given me shall come
[1:04:48] and I will not lose not one for he's
[1:04:52] gone so brother Isaac also to last night
[1:04:57] possessing your individual inheritance
[1:04:59] and I was telling brother Isaac last
[1:05:03] night Damon what a wonderful masterpiece
[1:05:05] it was regarding Caleb now remember
[1:05:07] Caleb represents the believer you know
[1:05:10] amen so you know Joshua
[1:05:13] the Holy Spirit you know in tight but
[1:05:15] Kalyn he had his eyes on a mountain he
[1:05:21] had his eyes on something that was
[1:05:24] promised to him as an individual
[1:05:28] he didn't represent the tribe is an
[1:05:31] individual affair amen and today if you
[1:05:35] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:05:37] it's an individual experience who can't
[1:05:41] explain it to somebody else
[1:05:43] hallelujah amen is something that God
[1:05:47] has done for you personally amen
[1:05:50] hallelujah
[1:05:51] and it will speak for itself praise this
[1:05:54] wonderful name Amen and I like what the
[1:05:57] brother Isaac said you know in brotherly
[1:05:59] kindness he said the Brethren hey men
[1:06:03] that went with me a man he could have
[1:06:05] been on that mountain you know 40 plus
[1:06:08] years ago but the Brethren
[1:06:10] and we all know that the brethren
[1:06:12] brought an evil report hey man that's
[1:06:15] what the brother Bram says we have got
[1:06:18] to bring a good true report because
[1:06:23] Joshua and Caleb came back with the
[1:06:25] evidence the others did not they could
[1:06:29] only explain what they saw and what they
[1:06:33] felt and what you know but vision
[1:06:37] hallelujah revelation Moses described
[1:06:42] the land fluid milk and honey and they
[1:06:44] saw it and that was enough for them
[1:06:47] hallelujah and they came back with the
[1:06:50] evidence amen and we're now living by
[1:06:54] the evidence
[1:06:55] hallelujah of that new land hallelujah
[1:06:58] there is no way I can doubt it now
[1:07:00] praise God Amen Jesus Christ is the same
[1:07:05] yesterday today and forever praise God
[1:07:08] is so food now amen this is so food this
[1:07:13] weekend God richly bless you amen and so
[1:07:17] our time is limited and we want to turn
[1:07:20] straight to the word and may we can we
[1:07:25] can stand to our feet now as we turn to
[1:07:28] the Word of God I trust that these few
[1:07:31] words would be a blessing to you amen
[1:07:34] and I want to under you to understand
[1:07:40] that as I said heaven and earth will
[1:07:42] pass away but my word will never pass
[1:07:44] away and if we just read a scripture
[1:07:47] today that in my opinion is enough I
[1:07:51] bring greetings from my wife I thank God
[1:07:53] for The Specials by the way and all the
[1:07:55] testimonies that went forth if I should
[1:07:57] forget somebody or whatever it's not
[1:08:00] intentional it's just our time is
[1:08:03] limited here and I just want to be
[1:08:04] obedient to I asked brother Ovid what I
[1:08:08] want to be in church order you know
[1:08:12] and back home I have a reputation of
[1:08:15] being well a little lengthy so I don't
[1:08:21] want to do that here hey men so but I do
[1:08:24] agree bring greetings from my wife a man
[1:08:27] she wanted to be here of course she is
[1:08:31] working last week she was off but this
[1:08:35] week she had to go to work and if I had
[1:08:38] worked out where the meetings were last
[1:08:42] week she would have been able to come
[1:08:44] but I do bring greetings from our little
[1:08:47] assembly in Valley Stream New York a man
[1:08:51] who as a group there that's waiting for
[1:08:54] the coming of the Lord a man you're
[1:08:58] waiting for the coming of the Lord amen

[1:09:09] testimony god bless you I I amen you see

[1:09:16] spirit in which I like I like brother
[1:09:18] Solomon name and God richly bless you
[1:09:21] and prosper your ministry where when you
[1:09:24] go back home you see the bride can no
[1:09:27] longer be deceived you know amen because
[1:09:30] a word is in the bride
[1:09:33] and the word that's in the bride has got
[1:09:35] to compare now what what is going on
[1:09:38] around in the world today amen and you
[1:09:42] see your womb is closed because you have
[1:09:44] received the seed amen of this message
[1:09:48] you can't receive anything else glory be
[1:09:52] to God hallelujah to the land I'm so
[1:09:55] thankful amen
[1:09:57] so quickly let us turn first of all let
[1:10:01] us I'm gonna give you my title the
[1:10:05] eternal church age at the end of the
[1:10:07] seals Amen that eternal church age at
[1:10:11] the end of the seals and so many have
[1:10:14] spoken about the eighth day and you know
[1:10:18] people's quotes are being taken I hear I
[1:10:24] see ministers going around and just like
[1:10:26] oh my God my my even my message is
[1:10:30] chopped up now but you know my message
[1:10:34] is chopped up but we'll see how the Lord
[1:10:36] God we can't exhaust God's blessing he
[1:10:40] always has something for us and a title
[1:10:42] as I said before I read a scripture that
[1:10:45] eternal church age at the end of the
[1:10:47] seals so let us read if we can I have
[1:10:51] two portions of Scripture Saint John 14
[1:10:56] I'll be reading the first four verses
[1:11:01] and also revelations chapter 21 and I
[1:11:06] think it's it fits it's very fitting for
[1:11:10] the theme that has been announced and we
[1:11:16] want to just stay on that line and that
[1:11:21] theme brother John Oh had mentioned
[1:11:28] something in his testimony there's got
[1:11:31] to be a place prepared for the word to
[1:11:35] be made manifest
[1:11:37] we know that is a body a body has now
[1:11:41] prepared me so there is a preparation
[1:11:45] you see so let us let us start here
[1:11:48] verse one let not your heart be troubled
[1:11:53] ye believe in God believe also in me in
[1:11:58] my father's house are many mansions if
[1:12:02] it were not so I would have told you now
[1:12:06] listen I go to prepare a place for you
[1:12:12] you see Jesus when he was walking with
[1:12:16] man could not make this preparation
[1:12:22] because the Holy Spirit had not been
[1:12:25] released but he had to go but on a day
[1:12:29] of Pentecost on the Holy Ghost and the
[1:12:32] Holy Ghost poured out
[1:12:33] he began his preparation he began his
[1:12:36] preparation and we have to understand
[1:12:37] his house amen this preparation we're
[1:12:40] talking about is your tabernacle I go to
[1:12:43] prepare a place for you and if I go I
[1:12:46] love this and prepare a place for you I
[1:12:50] will come again and receive you unto
[1:12:52] myself that where I am there ye may be
[1:12:58] also and whether I go ye know and the
[1:13:03] way ye know next scripture verse found
[1:13:07] in revelations chapter 21 and I trust
[1:13:11] that I can kind of bring this across in
[1:13:16] a way that it had come to me because we
[1:13:23] have to understand that the eighth day
[1:13:29] is coming
[1:13:33] but let us look at how is written in
[1:13:39] revelations chapter 21 in verse 1 now we
[1:13:44] know that we shall reign on the earth
[1:13:47] the earth as you know it today you're
[1:13:53] not going to come back to the same earth
[1:13:57] there's got to be done something done to
[1:14:00] this earth because then we're phasing
[1:14:04] into a new day now let's see what John's
[1:14:08] says here and I saw a new heaven oh no
[1:14:12] what happened to the old I saw a new
[1:14:17] heaven and a new earth for the first
[1:14:20] earth and the first for the first heaven
[1:14:23] and the first Earth were passed away and
[1:14:25] there was no more sea and I John saw the
[1:14:31] holy city New Jerusalem coming down from
[1:14:35] God out of heaven prepared as a bride
[1:14:38] adorned for her husband and I heard a
[1:14:42] great voice out of heaven saying behold
[1:14:44] the temple of God is with men and he
[1:14:48] will dwell with them and they shall be
[1:14:52] his people and God himself shall be with
[1:14:56] them and be their father and God shall I
[1:15:01] love this man and God shall wipe away
[1:15:06] all the tears from their eyes and there
[1:15:09] shall be no death no sorrow no crying
[1:15:13] hey men neither shall there be any more
[1:15:15] pain for the former things under the
[1:15:19] seventh day and all the in a period of
[1:15:23] time hour passed away he man this is the
[1:15:27] new law of the new day you see he men
[1:15:30] and he that sat upon the throne behold
[1:15:33] said behold I make all things new and he
[1:15:37] said unto me write for these words are
[1:15:41] true and faithful for an
[1:15:43] he said unto me it is done I am Alpha
[1:15:47] and Omega the beginning and the end I
[1:15:51] will give unto I will give let me see if
[1:15:57] okay I and I will give unto him that is
[1:16:01] athirst amen of the fountain of water of
[1:16:04] life verse 7 he that overcometh shall
[1:16:08] inherit a man shall inherit all things
[1:16:12] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[1:16:17] son
[1:16:18] may the Lord added blessing to the
[1:16:20] reading of his word let us just bow our
[1:16:22] heads in a word of Prayer our Heavenly

[1:17:36] a second I am using this this power
[1:17:41] PowerPoint and um it's just kind of not
[1:17:45] working for me a little bit but amen
[1:17:48] brother Branham said we have lived
[1:17:52] through seven Church ages
[1:17:55] and we all know that in every church age
[1:17:58] there were over comers every church age
[1:18:03] there were eighth day people hey man
[1:18:07] every Church age they were
[1:18:10] eighth day people that were
[1:18:12] predestinated to overcome in that age
[1:18:16] you take up all Irene is Martin Colombo
[1:18:20] and everything else it and down to this
[1:18:22] age and I hear sometimes so many people
[1:18:26] complain about the trials and
[1:18:29] tribulations and things that they they
[1:18:31] think that God made a mistake in putting
[1:18:33] you here listen I want to tell you
[1:18:36] something you're not a mistake
[1:18:38] there is no oops with God God doesn't
[1:18:43] make mistakes oh well you know amen he
[1:18:45] has over comers in every age hallelujah
[1:18:50] and if he has over comers in every age
[1:18:53] or something to overcome that's what
[1:18:57] makes you the believer the eighth day
[1:19:00] believer eternity hallelujah you come
[1:19:03] from God and you go back to God again
[1:19:05] and listen to me hallelujah you have
[1:19:09] representation as brother Peter Taylor
[1:19:12] said you see the believer that was in
[1:19:16] God before the foundation of the world
[1:19:18] amen
[1:19:19] he was spirit man way back in the
[1:19:23] beginning we see and he come to earth as
[1:19:25] spirit man we all know those things we
[1:19:28] all know these things but then God even
[1:19:30] you had to come in a in a place of time
[1:19:33] because eternity is like a circle you
[1:19:36] know we all know that brother Branham
[1:19:38] said that is a circle but when sin came
[1:19:40] in it put a hickey or a kink in this
[1:19:45] great circle hallelujah and God was
[1:19:48] determined to fix this circle
[1:19:51] it was sin that dropped out hallelujah
[1:19:55] amen to enter to try to interrupt the
[1:19:58] Eternity but God is from eternal
[1:20:01] eternity to eternity
[1:20:03] hallelujah glory be to God - God has
[1:20:06] overcomers in every age glory be to God
[1:20:11] amen and they are the ones at this time
[1:20:14] and this final age will receive a
[1:20:16] Sevenfold reward
[1:20:17] amen there's no overcoming for there for
[1:20:20] people who give up this is an overcoming
[1:20:23] amen there's no reward for people who
[1:20:25] who who just say I cannot make it
[1:20:27] anymore
[1:20:28] oh my my my my but listen amen I want
[1:20:32] you to understand now what brother
[1:20:34] Graham says here in the Seventh Seal now
[1:20:37] we all know that the seventh seal
[1:20:40] seventh under message has been unfolded
[1:20:43] and revealed by a prophet how many can
[1:20:46] say amen to that all right
[1:20:49] but now let's let's look at what the
[1:20:51] seventh seal amen we know that the
[1:20:55] seventh seal had a beginning and has an
[1:20:59] end how many to know that to be the
[1:21:01] truth the seventh seal has a beginning
[1:21:04] and it has an end brother Graham says in
[1:21:07] the seventh seal he said we must
[1:21:09] remember that the seventh seal is the
[1:21:12] end of time the end of all things is
[1:21:20] that right
[1:21:21] the things written in the seventh sealed
[1:21:24] book sealed up of the plan of redemption

[1:30:33] God will be made manifest
[1:30:35] hey man and I'm gonna tell you something
[1:30:39] can I can I speak what's on my heart

[1:30:46] speak goes on my heart don't worry be to
[1:30:49] God
[1:30:50] people don't know what the anointing is
[1:30:53] I'm gonna make it clear to you because I
[1:30:57] have scriptures and I have quotes and
[1:30:58] things Amen people fail to know what the
[1:31:02] anointing really is hallelujah brother
[1:31:06] Graham said that the greatest anointing
[1:31:08] that struck the earth was when Jesus
[1:31:14] walked into the temple he picked up the
[1:31:19] scrolls of Isaiah and he read the
[1:31:25] portion that pertained to him
[1:31:30] nobody was shouting nobody would you see
[1:31:35] people get confused with noise and think
[1:31:39] they have all that there is to have but
[1:31:43] the anointing or not listen please I'm
[1:31:46] not against shouting and glorify God I'm
[1:31:49] just making a point
[1:31:50] listen I want you to understand you can
[1:31:53] shout but at the end of the day you've
[1:31:55] got to understand that the anointing
[1:31:57] comes to make the word made flesh
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:02] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:32:08] be to God
[1:32:09] and he said the Spirit of the Lord is
[1:32:11] upon me amen he has anointed me
[1:32:15] hallelujah that preached to the poor and
[1:32:18] so forth amen glory be to God and he put
[1:32:21] the scroll away and brother Branham said
[1:32:24] oh you take these Pentecostals they
[1:32:26] would just love and run around that
[1:32:27] temple and shout and speak in tongues
[1:32:30] and everything else but that was the
[1:32:32] greatest anointing the anointing comes
[1:32:34] upon the word to make it live it is them
[1:32:38] the dynamics who are mechanics
[1:32:40] hallelujah and brother Bram says you
[1:32:43] wake to the anointing really strike this
[1:32:45] church amen
[1:32:47] I doubt very much if it's just gonna
[1:32:49] make us shout and glorify God although
[1:32:51] that is the after-effects Amen but we
[1:32:55] would rejoice because the word is
[1:32:57] becoming flesh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:33:04] amen glory a man listen so therefore
[1:33:10] without the statue of perfect man a man
[1:33:13] you will never make it you will never be
[1:33:16] able to be tied into that eternity
[1:33:19] change a man and I believe the thunders
[1:33:21] with all my heart you know why because
[1:33:24] brother Branham said it amen and I have
[1:33:27] to believe what he said hey man but you
[1:33:30] see here in brother Branham says in the
[1:33:32] seal of God he lived here once with us
[1:33:36] on earth in the form of a man God lived
[1:33:41] in his son Christ Jesus as the god man
[1:33:48] and he returned into glory leaving this
[1:33:53] world a little while in the world seeth
[1:33:55] me no more yet ye shall see me for I
[1:33:58] will be with you even in you to the end
[1:34:00] of the world now listen the person of
[1:34:02] the Holy Spirit returning in the form is
[1:34:07] that jesus said I come from God and I go
[1:34:11] back to God listen he said he came out
[1:34:16] of eternity eternity is number eight
[1:34:22] amen he wasn't in time God was eternal
[1:34:27] and he's still eternal but he had to
[1:34:31] drop into this kink that the devil
[1:34:34] caused and through sin but here is
[1:34:38] what's so beautiful about this amen you
[1:34:41] can be seated a moment amen I come from
[1:34:44] God and I go back to God he came from
[1:34:46] eternity and stepped down into time a
[1:34:49] man went out back and went went out of
[1:34:53] time back into eternity
[1:34:57] I love that so now when Adam sinned you
[1:35:04] see in the beginning God said the day
[1:35:10] that you eat thereof you shall die the
[1:35:16] day and to God a day is a thousand years
[1:35:21] we all know that and we read in the
[1:35:24] Bible that nobody lived a thousand years
[1:35:28] but who was looking close but he didn't
[1:35:31] but no God doesn't forget his promises
[1:35:34] you know he takes care of its promises
[1:35:37] don't worry about it
[1:35:38] amen because he created man here to be
[1:35:42] eternal in the beginning there was
[1:35:44] eternal hallelujah Adam was eternal Eve
[1:35:49] was eternal become from God and they got
[1:35:53] what we're supposed to go back to God
[1:35:54] but Eve let down the bars unbelief came
[1:35:58] in and they caused a kink amen and that
[1:36:01] is what broke fellowship between a man
[1:36:04] the early Adam and Eve and God but God
[1:36:08] had to fix that you know because he
[1:36:11] himself had to drop down into this
[1:36:14] little loop Oh hallelujah to make sure
[1:36:18] that he pushes it back up back into
[1:36:21] eternity and the reason for the
[1:36:27] thousand-year reign listen to me the
[1:36:32] reason for the thousand-year reign is to
[1:36:35] prove that God had paid the price of
[1:36:39] restoration
[1:36:42] somebody's gonna leave a thousand years
[1:36:45] go repeats ah God hallelujah at the
[1:36:48] wedding supper praise God
[1:36:50] Oh Satan will be bound a thousand years
[1:36:54] will have no tempter then Oh God takes
[1:36:58] care of his word Oh hallelujah lower
[1:37:04] these our God we would be rejoicing and
[1:37:07] of course the Great Tribulation is is
[1:37:09] taking place for three and a half years
[1:37:11] and Satan is bound and so forth but in
[1:37:14] this at the same time God
[1:37:16] Oh is preparing a place for you and I
[1:37:18] listen but it won't be the heavens that
[1:37:21] we know today it won't be the earth that
[1:37:23] we know today the earth that we know
[1:37:26] today has water has seas has trouble and
[1:37:29] so forth but Jesus what John was
[1:37:32] speaking about a new earth for the old
[1:37:34] things has passed away glory be to God
[1:37:38] you talk about Oh hallelujah
[1:37:43] amen see you can be seated if you can't
[1:37:47] a man and we live through all these
[1:37:49] types here but when you hit the eighth
[1:37:53] number eight see you go back to eternity
[1:37:58] you don't come from laws and rituals and
[1:38:00] orders as the brother already wrote a
[1:38:03] man or rather read you come by
[1:38:07] predestination hey men I'm going to say
[1:38:12] I'm gonna stop and say something here
[1:38:19] without predestination and God is not
[1:38:24] unfair you know he told Jeremiah before
[1:38:30] when you were in your mother's womb I
[1:38:34] knew you
[1:38:35] and I had ordained you to be a prophet
[1:38:39] to the nation's Jacob and Esau before
[1:38:47] they breed the single breath Jacob have
[1:38:52] I loved Esau have I hated
[1:38:56] hallelujah how can he do that because he
[1:38:59] knows his own God is not unfair and I'm
[1:39:06] gonna tell you the greatest revelation
[1:39:08] that any man any Christian can have
[1:39:10] today is their true revelation of
[1:39:13] predestination hallelujah to know that
[1:39:16] you come from God and you're going back
[1:39:18] to God again don't be to God
[1:39:22] hey man so let's take a story I've said
[1:39:25] this many times before the devil wanna
[1:39:28] he's the accuser you know he's the
[1:39:30] accuser there's nobody else named
[1:39:32] accuser outside of the devil he likes to
[1:39:35] accuse and there is is no redemption in
[1:39:37] accusation and to accuse he just wants
[1:39:40] to he's judge jury and he wants to just
[1:39:44] make you look bad but put you in the
[1:39:46] front paper and so forth that's an
[1:39:48] accuser you see but Jesus told the woman
[1:39:52] neither do I accuse you because his love
[1:39:58] was was a love of forgiveness and in her
[1:40:04] heart was a see she was in vain she was
[1:40:10] caught in adultery this is why I said
[1:40:14] don't we don't have the ability to judge
[1:40:20] any man any body we don't have the
[1:40:23] ability to judge any person
[1:40:26] the only reason God's judgments are true
[1:40:31] and they are pure and they are final is
[1:40:34] because he knows all things you present
[1:40:41] your case to a jury and all of you
[1:40:44] trying to get is some evidence evidence
[1:40:47] something DNA anything amen and
[1:40:50] sometimes you get a bunch of it and
[1:40:52] sometimes you get a little bit of it but
[1:40:54] then you go to court amen and it's the
[1:40:57] proof Amen that you present whether that
[1:41:00] case it is is a rule for you or against
[1:41:04] you
[1:41:05] Amen but God
[1:41:08] [Applause]
[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:15] God knows all things amen but God knows
[1:41:19] all things and that's how he could judge
[1:41:22] and this is why he before Jacob and Esau
[1:41:26] lived one day he knew he knew that
[1:41:31] hallelujah
[1:41:32] oh that a man Jacob would have respect
[1:41:37] unto the birthright hey man
[1:41:40] oh and everything that Jason that's the
[1:41:44] only thing he wanted amen was that
[1:41:46] birthright but Esau he made light of it
[1:41:50] let us never make light of our
[1:41:53] birthright this is the Holy Ghost it is
[1:41:57] your birthright never make light of
[1:41:59] adoption never make light of perfection
[1:42:03] never make like this is your inheritance
[1:42:06] glory be to God hallelujah glory oh
[1:42:11] praise be to God but when your
[1:42:16] predestinated now the act the accuser
[1:42:20] let's get back to the accuser you did
[1:42:22] this you did that to be predestinated
[1:42:25] means to be way back before there was a
[1:42:30] star before there was a moon before
[1:42:33] there was an earth before there was
[1:42:34] anything an atom before there was
[1:42:36] anything moving you were in the back
[1:42:39] part of God's mind and listen I want to
[1:42:44] tell you that he did not think of you in
[1:42:46] your condition now because he doesn't
[1:42:49] think in complete thoughts now he saw
[1:42:53] you as a perfect image just like him
[1:42:59] casting out Devils healing the sick
[1:43:03] preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ a
[1:43:06] man standing for this message
[1:43:09] glory be to God team Han that's how he
[1:43:13] saw you huh a man and this is why when
[1:43:16] the Devils enjoy you not data well
[1:43:19] listen devil he's still working on me
[1:43:21] don't worry buddy don't worry you just
[1:43:22] hang around a little bit hang around a
[1:43:25] while and you'll see he'll keep his word
[1:43:27] oh you're not in the book you're not in
[1:43:31] the book or what do you mean you're not
[1:43:32] in the book you know the devil don't
[1:43:34] even know you whether you're in the book
[1:43:36] or not because because when the book was
[1:43:40] written he was even he wasn't even in
[1:43:43] existence so what he is doing he is
[1:43:47] guessing he is trying to make you doubt
[1:43:51] that you're in the book so you have to
[1:43:55] challenge your devil said ok devil let's

[1:47:12] hallelujah and you know something about
[1:47:16] nelq acidic and you know this is why

[1:47:21] a mystery you know a man who was this
[1:47:24] Melchizedek oh my they tried to they
[1:47:28] tried to look for records of his
[1:47:31] existence

[1:47:42] had no beginning

[1:48:35] glory be to God he was King Melchizedek
[1:48:40] a man king of Salem Amen let's let's
[1:48:44] look at another quote here just a moment
[1:48:46] amen see as as I said eternity is like a
[1:48:51] circle let's get back to that we all
[1:48:57] come down we are eternal when the Holy
[1:49:01] Spirit comes into your heart and brother
[1:49:05] Graham said that's the only way we can
[1:49:07] get back to eternity because the Holy
[1:49:11] Ghost is eternal and you know what it's
[1:49:16] called Zoe the very life of God the very
[1:49:25] person of God listen man I'm not just
[1:49:28] looking for a blessing I'm looking for
[1:49:31] the person of God
[1:49:34] ehh halleluya he dropped down in time
[1:49:46] but during that time he had to put blood
[1:49:50] across the chasm they are across the the
[1:49:54] whole length of time to redeem it so
[1:49:59] push it back up
[1:50:01] amen Jesus was when he come in a flesh
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:06] Amen and dropped into time it did not
[1:50:09] stop him from being eternal no but he
[1:50:13] just come down into time now he didn't
[1:50:16] come into time just to just pay us a
[1:50:19] visit he came into time to redeem those
[1:50:23] that have fallen into this little mood
[1:50:26] hallelujah glory be to God and to redeem
[1:50:31] all those Amen hallelujah and to bring
[1:50:33] it back up not for everybody but for the
[1:50:37] Elector predestinated seen of God before
[1:50:41] the foundation of the world jesus said I
[1:50:44] don't pray for the world but I pray for
[1:50:47] those that God has given me no repeats
[1:50:50] our God hallelujah he had a mission he
[1:50:53] had a purpose
[1:50:54] he had a hey man you come from God and
[1:50:58] you go back to God again glory be to God
[1:51:02] Amen blow read so therefore the change
[1:51:07] Amen this little loophole was broken but
[1:51:10] he come down to redeem Amen oh that was
[1:51:13] in that a match so he come from eternity
[1:51:17] listen to me he come Jesus come from
[1:51:19] eternity and step into a space of time
[1:51:23] and he come amen and made of flesh
[1:51:27] amen and through here in the order
[1:51:29] sanctified and a streak of blood went
[1:51:33] across this place to redeem it and to
[1:51:36] connect it back to God again all for the
[1:51:39] eternity do you see that
[1:51:42] amen so therefore he come in a step and
[1:51:45] step into this body of time could you
[1:51:47] imagine the God of glory he's eternal he
[1:51:56] steps into time he puts on a body
[1:52:02] he was the mystery of God revealed
[1:52:07] because all that God was he poured it
[1:52:10] into Jesus Christ
[1:52:13] [Applause]
[1:52:14] [Music]
[1:52:16] he was the mystery of God revealed and
[1:52:20] the church has got to be the mystery of
[1:52:23] Christ revealed the world wants to see
[1:52:27] Jesus the world is longing to see Jesus
[1:52:31] where will they find him
[1:52:32] it's Jesus in you and I don't explain
[1:52:36] don't expect the world to understand you
[1:52:39] you are a mystery to them hallelujah
[1:52:43] just like Jesus was a mystery to the to
[1:52:47] his age now if this God of glory you
[1:52:51] would expect him to have stadiums of
[1:52:55] followers He healed the sick he raised
[1:52:59] the dead he did everything and all the
[1:53:01] sign of the Messiah he manifested God in
[1:53:06] human skin

[1:53:58] the foundation of the world but listen

[1:54:28] day of the feast see the tabernacle
[1:54:31] notice after that after the last piece
[1:54:33] after the last Church age after the last

[1:55:55] years he keeps his promises
[1:56:00] oh but after that i john saw the new
[1:56:06] jerusalem coming down for the old earth

[1:57:03] gonna close with this like brother Isaac
[1:57:05] said a man you know we're coming back
[1:57:08] and we shall reign on the earth on a new
[1:57:14] earth not the filthy one we see today
[1:57:19] because the Old Earth and the old heaven

[1:58:04] call it cancer still a demon amen

[1:58:26] judge the earth hallelujah

[1:58:38] that the redeemed of God their names
[1:58:42] have been transferred to the Lamb's Book
[1:58:44] of one where our wedding certificate is
[1:58:49] [Music]

[1:59:57] the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[2:00:00] our Lord
[2:00:01] we come from God and we go back to God

[2:00:26] Oh
[2:00:30] never did it in the first place glory be
[2:00:33] to God hallelujah you know what I like
[2:00:40] here's what I like there's a quote that
[2:00:42] brother branham said that every sin has
[2:00:46] got to be judged we all know this I hope
[2:00:50] I hope I hope you've you're in the
[2:00:52] message man every every sin has got to
[2:00:55] be judged he said but when we make
[2:01:00] mistakes and we sin not willingly that
