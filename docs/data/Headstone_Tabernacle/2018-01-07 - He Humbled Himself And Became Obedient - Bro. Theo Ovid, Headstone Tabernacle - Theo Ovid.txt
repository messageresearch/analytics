we want to go to the scriptures we want three portion scriptures this morning Philippians chapter two you wanna read from verse one to eleven he boosted after eleven we wanna be from 32 to 40 and first Corinthians chapter two wanna read verse one to five all right here we go Philippians chapter 2 verse one if there be any therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels of mercies fulfilling my joy that should be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus and he's describing the kind of man who been in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men being found and fashioned as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross a wherefore God also had highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father we go to Hebrews 11:1 a refound verse 32 finance' amen what shall I more see for the time would feel me to tell of gideon of barrack of samson of jeff sigh of develops an ell of the prophets who true fate subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed violent and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens woman received their dead raised the life again others would tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had trials of cruel mockings and scourges ye moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect last scripture 1st Corinthians chapter 2 wanna read verse 1 to 5 Paul speakin an I brethren when I came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power that your faith had a purpose why why that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of and button the power of god let's pray one more time father we thank you for your blessed word and we are blessed to read a woman to hear a word interpreted through our hearts confirm your word with signs wonders and miracles and may become a reality as the prophet said that the mysteries will unfold that we might see the plainness of God to know how to conduct ourselves in the evil day we live in granted father in Jesus name we ask it amen amen you may be seated without a title this morning this is our first service of the year I really looking forward for go to the greetings among us this year this 2018 we have to be looking forward and a great expectation and you get what you expect and you have to do more if you want to get more isn't that right okay so the title I have this morning is heat from the scriptures in Philippians the title is he humbled himself and became obedient that's a title just to take a scripture text from what Christ did he humbled himself and before you could come into obedience you have to learn how to humble yourself another an inspiration the revelation of Jesus Christ now we know the scripture Hebrews 5:8 says though he was son yet learned he obedience by the things that he suffered though he was a son it didn't get my free pass it didn't give him as is you though he were a son they suffer and didn't make him a son he was always a son but even though he was a son he learned obedience by the things that he suffered so obedience is something that you have to learn yeah yeah you are not born with obedience your mother didn't give you that I'm your father didn't Hanyu that you have to learn that and things have to come to teach you and to bring you in obedience are you with me now you have to be able to be taught in order to learn it come like if your wife is not a good housewife coming to church doesn't make a good all wife it come a good church member but if you want to be a good wife you have to learn what good why does anybody come to church that don't mean a good husband or good father or good mother or a good daughter or whatever it is you have to become what you want to become you want to be a better mechanic you want to be a better son you want to be a better preacher you want to be able to leader you have to become that you have to want to do better better than you had before so you come to church and learn stuff that you could come in obedience to the Word of God that you can follow instructions you have come to church to judge others you come to church to get the benefit they get the juice on the orange praise God praise God that not to complain because you do a lot of complaining you do it very well you'll be very good become an expert and complaining you have a gift of complaining you love to complain and as the more completely more anointing of complete and come upon you but if you come for faith which is God's currency to purchase things from God or to get things from God then you're in the right place hallelujah praise God what we say is a lot of shout so we're gonna take our time this morning the passes in the house we'll give the Lord a shout or glory to God Amen hallelujah so when Jesus Matthew 16 came to the close of Caesarea Philippi he acts the sciples whom o men say I to Solomon am become men always talking so I want to know what they sing about know that then this is something you are this some say you're John the Baptist Alliance he said but whom do you say I am because they oh they don't know who I am so talk to me now reach back to me now speak back to me you following me all these years talk back to me and they still didn't know but Simon Peter he broke into a channel and he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto Him blessed are thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven then he went on further I say unto thee thou art Peter and upon this rock hallelujah this revelation I will do not know past ability not know five hölderlin I will build my church that's why revelation is sovereign and the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the revelation of Jesus Christ or could we get a lot of shout that's why you can be busted into tears but that can't stop the Holy Ghost from revealing Jesus Christ to you and these are same yesterday today and forever or give the Lord a shout of praise Oh hallelujah so Jesus this isn't read his identity dog pizza on upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and that gets that gates of Hell you wanna wrestle with it but they'll prevail against it so the battle is on but I want to confirm to you in case you didn't know that Jesus said he will build his church so it have no man Church really the real church is Jesus Church and that is built upon by Revelation so Todd revelation solid again revelation that church is built by revelation not you following this man or following this church or falling this group you have to get a revelation of Jesus Christ and then you know you're following the Messiah or give the Lord a shout hallelujah praise God understand this they leave they leave the fishing business they leave that's collected they leave all the follow this man because they had a revelation that that was the Christ amen praise God or do you love him this morning hallelujah brother branham from the breech this book is a mysterious book it's a book of redemption now we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood it's proved that to six church ages but and when the 17th up begin the song is mystery he winds up all the loose ends these fellows probe that and the mysteries come down from God as the Word of God and revealed the entire revelation of God so all this mystery mystery stuff comes down as wood and that word is preached and that wood comes to you and the devil is thicker than mine battle because he doesn't know how the word get in the brain but that's the secret the word is in the brain the Woodman underboss the word gets into the bride hallelujah do you know I hear man is that word in you the world is in the bride that's the secret that is your secret that's why you in church this morning that's why I don't care much a backslide whatever your judge this morning because there is something on top your head there is something inside of you you don't heal an explainer you can explain why I keep pressing on while they keep getting back up can't even explain ER hallelujah but Peeta Peeta was revealing something in second Peter one he said whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these what these what these promises you might be a partaker of the divine nature having escaped the corruption does the world you loss and besides this giving all diligence given all application given all cerfancy given your passion your drive your enthusiasm you see you give it all generous add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge keep piling it up knowledge temperance on pages and brothers and practice the kind of charity add these things up so we have a commission to work the labor to strive and this possession comes taxes or labor it starts with feet but you're laboring to enter into this great promised land there's always been that week what set it up that way as labor are striving like the chicken in the egg you have to persuade out him and that worm had to be converted to a butterfly after process way out but positive you that it wouldn't be a jellyfish that it wouldn't be some kind of oh my Harlem Cookie Monster same way calling again and puppet business see cooking one city I'm fluffy thing when you put in handy hands in so I put honey on so go don't want you like that push it so you're safe so no doesn't want you like that Iraq doll yeah then tied all my rag doll China's messy and you know Deuteronomy 29:29 the secret things belong to the Lord that's the sizzle but those things are revealed belong to us no devil pass stop you from getting what what is revealed boy now once is a secret got to keep it but once it come down as a word that's mine spotted take your hands off of my property she could things belongings a little Oregon but those things that are revealed belong to us and to our children what's the purpose for that nobody sees us know that we may do all the words so all the revelation has to come into action it's not for sitting information fritter I see people fish already immense question answer you could see the engane it making a question mark you see people on the far in mechanic's question marks on oh that's not what the word is for the word is to reveal to push you into action let me get a scripture Habakkuk to write division make it plain he left Gudrun so this vision of God must be made plain I am NOT here to tell you you're fine I'm not here to tell you you're the nicest thing since sliced bread sorry I'm going to tell you that you here to find out your back spots the cooking spots you wicked whiz things and your heart that the husband don't know that the wife don't know that the children don't know that is what you're here for for the surgeon general's knife the sharp sword cut them between the bone and tomorrow the common cut out what's not like him who is out in the house [Applause] but a matter of money absolute says this let me tell you something listen to this closely this is the complete divine revelation of God his will the coming of Christ everything is right in this book completed and if anything draws you off of that and trolls you all find the compass and that sets you to the Word of God in other words don't let nothing shake you of the wood of them don't let wife husband children money car land pastor bishop Pope whatever it is don't let nothing shake you of the world when I give my heart to Jesus Christ I was 17 years old and when I saw his only three things the floor man off his ideas money its woman or popularity it had pen things there are hundred things just three things I ask God to protect me from them three things I said Lord let me be a man they're gonna wait upon you because I found the scripture where it said they that wait upon the Lord I found the scripture where young men shall fall utterly fall and I know the scripture that I call you young man because you're strong so when I understood that because you're young that don't mean you're gonna stand this latter wear upon God when I understood that I pastor be a man that's gonna lead upon God I went wait till my change come unless the where the punk or going to bless you the devil cannot stop a man that put God first I don't care what shape to the left what to the right but that not gonna come for any hyung [Applause] glory to God never in my life I ever thought I wouldn't come to cook a dishonest lyin preachers but they'll have them hallelujah but they can't stop anything because they don't have a heavenly dollar hell and then all the power reduction yes I go God show me the top son of nothing to the people I shall do it father and son so he cares a how much the people love the man and of the past I wonder that I've nothing to do God have to say this is my beloved son and human well pleased that's why I don't bother with the people what do you wanna show the show yo show that's your business I will shout for you I will praise God for you Oh glory to God because I know my name is on that book I'm no I'm a child of the king Oh hallelujah I know serpents EDA 904 cemented once hallelujah brother branham he said God created me revival let me be the revival but each one of us be the revival the revival in me make me to hunger make me to test create and me Lord that what is needed in me let me from this hour on be more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more humbler more kinder more willing to work more look into the team that are positive and forgetting Byzantine gonna pass let's cut off 2017 we have a land in front of us and land to possess it's a good land if I'm size in it is that wonders in it it's not miracles in it in the restoration in it it's not power yet it's a good land all in after pulling it adoption in it it's a fire fire fire in it and I'm your half foot on the damage net on it or get the Lord a shout it's a bridge you have to press you in it deliverance deliverance power all of that is in that in hand my Oh glory you'll be seated so butter man talk about the lesson he sent feeling the Holy Spirit which way to set this back the people will see it you see huh you've got to see it I love how the Lord did this thing it is beautiful I just love it write the vision make it plain so the ministers fulfill the Commission when the people get the vision of God so what the Prophet said is that the minister Carboni revival thank God the Prophet said that these jokers want to bring revival itself but he said 'no man can bring it they take the people so the minister have to transfer the vision so if you wanna play pope and keep everything for himself as the revealer of the z miseries then he on his own because he has to stand there revealing a whole lot of things for very long time but the point is is still we all come not till the minister come the ministry is still we all come into the unity of the faith into the knowledge not not some come all come knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of Christ measure because we do have all the same measure Oh hallelujah he ascended to high and give gifts unto men we don't have all the same gifts we don't have the same measure but the content is God so when God hit a housewife and fell over the Holy Ghost it doesn't make a preacher because she get God in her no no doesn't do that it's maker one anointed Holy Ghost big cooking pan cooking rice hallelujah food my goddamn husband can't wait to come over

the Holy Ghost I had a holy God showdown come on give the Lord a shout in the house how many feels very viable this morning [Applause] supermom says I want to see which way the setlist that the people will see it that you might conceal it be enlightened and cause you to come closer to Christ because we are the endtime not closed at the church but the Christ maybe not take this as a lecture but may we suddenly take the warnings of the Holy Spirit and pretty a night don't let nothing stop you from praying that include the cell phone that include Facebook back include the internet doctor could whatever don't let nothing stop you from praying we get in we take up the lives of those great men back there how they sacrifice you see hold it little did we have done it makes me a shame of myself

mystery they have all glory to God that's what we're talking about the church have to be attuned to spirit this natural part is only pact but in the beginning after the church was broken the spirit realm there was removing spirit bringing natural removing spirit bringing natural until the only spirit man so-called was the Pope it went to one man he's old man I'm going to one that actually God say he that he hit the lady being conquered he hit you not having what you supposed to have when you leave that you supposed to walk with a bundle of joy a bundle of peace a bundle let the simple bundle put in man your back a bundle when you open that up so you can share it out because they never had joy in service you want some you have a bundle of it a bundle of God's love a bundle of God's peace when you go on your job you have a bundle of it look at smile hallelujah praise God if it laughs there could rejoice you could shout because you know inside your soul your aunt oh god the logos and praises hallelujah so what each year the cousin of the spirit I did not show off this bridge I didn't answer until now there is route again we living in the last days they closed in the consummation of the church now why does Satan hate revelation why is he so against revelation it is because the entire canon of God's Word and church is suddenly built upon revelation so normal no one wants citizen job visitors keep you in the flesh keep your natural you come to service you come late so your car you sing to get in the spirit that's what the signals for the singing is the gain inspiration you know the sickness of being an atmosphere you know the signatures will be singing that one has some long mrs. song they write some long message song after pictures at a club because it's will somebody prophet now so it's something good but have no anointing with it there's no inspiration with it it has no fire no process nothing with it is just like information in song form but when them writers was going to the experience it was not information in some form when that brother lost his wife and somebody say say Lord he said precious Lord and he said precious wasn't talking on like a thing they read in a book and they put some words together and call that a message song wasn't that it was real the blind singer she said I shall know him by the prints of the nail in his hands that was no message song that was a reality or the blood of Jesus Oh Halloween oh it was the blood there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's Fame where sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains or get the Lord a shock in the hall [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] in the walls of an insane institution the phone the words written the love of God so pure so measureless and strong it shall forevermore enjoy the same that means of song they know liking that's inspired stuff the man went crazy trying to figure the love of God and have our important song written there or give the Lord a show we might look crazy some time but we are inspired o Cloney that God took the Lord a show we might talk crazy sometimes we might not crazy sometimes but you live your meal bi inspired [Applause] so the church is not based upon Jesus it's built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ what has been revealed so there's not intellectual stuff with that revelation wherever you have nothing doing intellect when when when I say I got the revelation of Allah shall conceive if it has passed intellectually stop Oh just rewind could you play that again the intellect but because it bypasses intellect he says a virgin shall conceive and be a son his name shall be called wonderful counselor everlasting father Prince of Peace somebody challenged you of which in Congress Eve I didn't see it you know I was just expressing the thoughts that dropped on direct that's not my interpretation of a general that come direc no secretary I've come direct fresh and blood

Jesus when the wise men when Pharaoh Wiseman and suits ears and movie men and witch doctors so the sign that a special child was born they have to inform the King because God have to put the same and

when Peter look at his hands to see what change you could give him he recognized that he's contingent at the resident Scranton apostle Holly that no you don't have that sorry don't have that pillar

these years tired tired tired and got loose then bugs free free free at last glory no God the prophet said when there Dennis saw that he said witta many other stuff that Neisseria stuff now Dino Dino shakin in upper room and fall in dough I could be done with that but this thing here this is the same work Jesus drew them guys doing - that's what we're talking about the same works I do shall you do also and greater oh my so whatever I'm said when that time comes to the Holy Ghost when traveese Christ back in the church with power and demonstration and healing the sick and making a sign that we said we'll follow the believers then Satan turns over in his bed he does something about that until that time cylinder came a church adjoint or how much Monsieur reveal that is the mysterious balls yes insistence see it I'm loading them up when they say Satan loading up in mysteries listen is a bottomless pit abyss reason and yeah but this commander - slamming mysteries all day and the itching ears people I never see it so sit down laughing just sit let's move on to somebody else from top already they focus on them not focus on the life of Christ to be made manifest to focus on that you after a revelation of Jesus Christ do you get that how many understand that not a revolution of this church not a result of my ministry not mention I'm your pastor not that but the revelation of Jesus Christ if I die in the morning you still have that revelation if this just fall flat you say that revelation if trainers split into 15 parts you still have the revelation of Jesus Christ make sure make sure you have a revelation of Jesus Christ I remember good friend of Mines the plectrum holiness you couldn't see the message I used to work together I said share with him the word at a time I see we solve it he said you have a revelation of Jesus Christ you say everybody that talked to him about his message we talked about a brand and say but I Brown saying brother Branham Samba he couldn't get that I was talking about Jesus but Jesus said how jesus said behold I will send new prophets and if you see through the eyes of Jesus you could present it correctly if you don't have that but I Brown see who is brother Brown to them but Ron is an authority to them but on authority to you but you're not present in Christ the presentin a prophet like a prophet and a prophecy only prophet who is that did you even understand that there's a promise because in Elisha they didn't understand that so you presented something that I even start to begin to grasp and they turn Adamo necessarily rejected they reject what you have to be have a religious Christ then you could present Christ to the people through the Prophet [Applause] so that is why i could tell you i go by nobody fight you have your fight with this one nice you end up I know you me and them don't bring me in the business staying a business you fight your fight I am i fact the fight I will fight my fight I fight my own fights I will bring you to church in it that brothers and ministers bring the whole church and eternally who cheat fighting with them fighting fight invite them destroy the believers this pass up over the past and believe or to sit and hold and I already had a fish soup suppose they better repent all your undoing that edit undo that couldn t Microsoft Word the computer you can do that after its quality per head and I shot the mind and ripped their spirits and saw the wrong season them against this one and that one who you undoing that God will catch them I'm not supposed to do that [Applause] well yeah that strong right that's right yeah it's strong but it's the truth and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free when they go in court they say I do you promise to speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth that'll take all jury they can go online so the first part clear that truth break itself at home true you can leave out some nothing but the truth give us all God say I desire truth from the inward parts God one truth from with inside the truth from inside of you that's why Jesus said the woman go call your husband just see what kind of woman she is it's not a matter she doing this and doing that a liver this manner that man you know is what inside of her it's not what so much you're doing is who you are it's such a career he took upon him no repetition repetition is what others think about you but character is who you are everybody can see a nice and nice and nice but that dough has to be so that's what people say that what people think but I you nice do you do nice things do you have a nice character or are you cooking inside about nice outside that's what the word comes to do no thought between the bone and the marrow and go down in China [Applause] glorious hallelujah hallelujah the woman dear says that fitted exit bread and passes the dogs the woman said cute Lord I'm a dog but he dog just get crumbs just go your way woman she humbled herself hallelujah praise God and she receive a blessing that's the problem people don't want to humble themselves oh yeah they want bless they want lessons but I do wonder humble because the Obi you have to subject yourself and Jesus didn't talk they taught it robbery to be equal with God he was God but ya come and say I am Lord look at me you see these muscles these are good muscles be this just like a car around a girl she didn't do that he humbled himself he became the form of a servant and he became obedient and the Bible said let this mind be in you before that Paul said esteem each other better than yourself that means see your brother better than you bigger than you say I did for somebody space I better than she I better than he I have more civility in another word this one had more revelation so he's a man of the aura listen every minister going preached by the feet and relational God give him I'm not trying to have nobody measure I never tried in anybody else but what what happening I'm very comfortable to be what God made me and I want to do the best that I can and so each one of you must be that way the surrender to the Lord isn't that right so let's look at the vision we have today for the branagh but Ron says find out if David left AMA David and the rest of them would only a consulted the bread of the hour you remember David got in trouble right you didn't consult the Prophet if you want to be remember the AK they were feelin move and led to do this and at the error and he didn't consult God and men died innocent man died so you watch if the priests and prophets and preachers and theologians schools and our nation would have consulted our now it won't do them no good didn't they don't move out it won't have a bit she's gone now she's crossed the line five years ago between repentance mercy and judgment talk on Motown America notice what is then what can be done what is to be done let's consult the Prophet the Bible where we cannot add or take away from it God takes us from the Book of Life the Bible said Malachi 4 version 10 how the seven seas would be open and reveal all these mysteries I mean hid through these reformers he said how it would be done it's in the Bible thus saith the Lord God has completely perfectly identified that and vindicated to be the truth by signs wonders and heavens and the sky is everything else for it 33 years you think they listen to it no they're dead it was when this thing happened that David saw he said Oh God send us a David that can see where you stand in that can look out and see God made a promise what how he's gonna do it today God said it right in his word how he would do it God pulled my car my kiyah examine his vision before 400 dignified prophets he examined his vision as he was right he looked back to what the prophets said before him to see what happened he looked back he saw Elijah standing there saying up the dogs will lick your blood too and he's seen that the vision was exactly according to the Word of God so he pronounced it no matter what the rest of them said stayed with the word when my cars and go you see when I come back I will be with you he see if you come back God never talk to me let's look at the vision we have today is it building churches is it new things is that great things are going to happen or is it judgement this is what is feast in the world America is perfectly sudden right now there is Sodom anointed America is getting ripe for judgment they have two kings King jong-un on that side I'm Kingdom Trump on our side both of them chutney whenever I'm talking nuclear talk but something on the break and you're gonna break soon it is judgment there's nothing left but judgment you know so the bride have to come into position before these things begin to strike oh yes they're gonna begin to move in because when those hands releasing the bag will be here so teams will be moving in it wouldn't be business as usual or business as normal something horrible happened watch people start a pre Oh God not Ibrahim but that's how we supposed to be known making a greater push isn't that right because Los Angeles is a sign for the world not for the bride that's for the world outside but for you you supposed to see your promises made manifest right in your midst that was you suppose we're looking for your promises isn't that right watch so watch so David consult the priest of that date illusion but it was contrary to the word God said he would do it today how you restore all things he would restore exactly enjoy 228 all the years the conquer woman a caterpillar I restore everything back to the church exactly what they had in the first place what are you saying I'm saying tongues have to come back prophecies have to come back interpretation of tongues have to come back give her wisdom give of healing every gift has to be back in the church I serve as finishing somebody represent tongues and somebody interpret given warnings exposing people Colin Olsson whatever it is that could be back in the church then people would just walk in the building just any old home there was no goddess among those people hallelujah fires there and you serve it long time you know oh yeah tongues and interpretation and whatnot I was on one meeting I was so scared I wasn't preaching that that was abnormally believer winter silver song so and what has minister say on the platform and my man was preaching talking afterwards tongues come and interpretation come and when course had to expose some things I said the minister said only platform sitting down their faults Delta Novello and I mean she can literally don't even say go call them Falls only platform this is say I make that a better spirit picking up what's in their people's lives and hearts the full operation in the church God can film in the world which signs wonders miracles gifts do you want to see that or just one of your words words words words words that's is what you must want to see the Living God [Applause] but when thunders was breached 1975 every give dry up that was a kind of mind-boggling call his brother some Pentecostal church and open Bible Church and whatnot had gifts and signs along I think every sign of anyone else you know what was doing trying to get the gifts to identify if he would was true and God just try it up our brothers to come to me but she all these signs really tongues let's see what the that catches you with the wood is above all those things so God bring you words to the people see they could take it then peg Russell who couldn't handle it the leave the message because they want that signs then power there and they don't understand that the message comes to bring character because character is what gonna positionally place you for Genuine power what the Pentecostal I was a temporary power temporary blessing God couldn't use them because didn't have the word to use the word in them he used men but the word come to the prophet and because they reject the prophet the reject the word so go just use men flesh and blood but he's promised a bride that will be a true seed of the word a true right of the word and in that prayer will have the word and you're gonna use the word in the pride that is right the bride cannon sale it's not you he's using you are not even the believer the believer is the word in you come on kill hello - OH get-along I shop you are not gonna leave her the believer is the word in you God put something in you when before the foundation of the

your years believing this message is not wasted I come to remind you that time is at hand for say reconceive the time is at hand from marriage British Messiah you haven't wasted your fate you haven't believed I don't advise fables no no no no no no you're gonna be activated for glory in a word and you're gonna come alive the water you'll be manifested Oh glory to God amen hallelujah Subramani lukewarmness demands a penalty from God the penalties are they be spirit of his moat here we don't want to go astray folks they very unwisely see that God can spew out of his mulch and that proves that no such a thing as any true love the doctrine of in our sins I wanna corrugating can right now this face is not given to an individual and it's given to the church he's talking to the church furthermore if you want to keep the word in mind you recall nowhere does it say that we had a motive blood we engrave on his palms with a carried in his bosom way back in the unknown ages before time knew in his mind we own a sheep fall in his pastures but never in a smoke but what is in the Mount of the Lord the word in his mouth Oh hallelujah for prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so what is wrong with these people in the last day they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about yet they are lukewarm about it the Baptist's have decrees and dogmas based on the word and they can't shake them they see their possibilities and miracles are over there's no batteries or Holy Ghost subsequent to believe in and the Methodists have this stuff all them clean the doctrine to be would be so I'm gonna strain to find anything anything the fit date of June they put the doctrine first and then trying to fit it they will sell out the word for sensation about every time if they can produce a manifestation like oil blood tongues and other signs where is water or not whether properly into from the word the majority will fall for it the word God says here we go I am going against you all I will see you out of my mouth this is the end for seven or seven ages I have seen nothing but men esteem in their own word above mine so at the end of this age I'm spooning out of my mouth it is all over I'm going to speak alright I'm here in the midst of the church the 'man of God the faithful and it will be by my prophet then he could Russian ten seven and this is the voice seven injured yeah it is he is still in a vindicated prophet he said on a prophet almost two thousand years he is sending someone who is so fast an organization education religion this prophet will turn a half of the turrent back to the father's listen to this he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was rapport he will restore the truth as they had it and those elected him will be the ones who will truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works who is that the electret him hallelujah a momentary consideration of church history will prove in the Dark Ages the world was entirely lost to the people but court sent loot over the world Lutheran's spoke for God at that time at that time and watch but they organized again the pure was lost for organization tends towards dogma and Creed and not simple word shout out simple word simple word has to be able to be made plain to the people not complex because what has come in the complexities because LM in Ghana long time the preachers ad whole mass in Latin so the people sitting there and he was secular said : meeting me so very hands and they go home then they converted Latin to English but the people sit down and this Catholic I did you have a clue him and Christian and the mood seducer they have no clue whatsoever he is speaking a different language revolting he's become she's another language God doesn't want that one time afterwards yes stop talking parabolas he said logo stickers no cleanly because he speaking parable to tab some of them but he bring in the brick of the disciples he is talking a certain way but then he begin to bring it to them because the mystery has to be made clear what you about to receive that's why the Bible said he opening understanding to the scriptures and open the world to them that if you go in the upper room without any doubts that this promises minds this Holy Ghost is mines I'm gonna be filled behold I send the promise of my father upon you but Perry you see the usual I'm until you be endued with power from on high there's no power going sideways someone high balls on below for money no man eternal power from an a dr. Witt [Applause] and the Bible said when the day of Pentecost was fully come I liked those words fully come there in one man there in one Accord they were prison as normal but all of a sudden something happened Russian might you win fill all the old house fire divide itself give is everybody a portion [Applause] LeBron says the church is no longer the more peace of God it is the one more piece so what is tilling in her hope the church God is doing that oh yes he will confirm her to the Prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her and the last day the spirit and the bride say come rushing 10 to 17 let's go once more the world will hear that from God as at Pentecost but of course that would bribe you pretty is it as in the first age now he has cried after this age you have heard you have the word your more Bibles than ever but you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and Hakkinen the pieces taking what you want leaving on what you want you are not interested in living it but debate in it I would sooner you be hot or cold if you were cold and rejected I could stand that if we could get white hard to know its truth and live it I would praise you for that but because you simply take my word and honor it I will spew you out of my mouth oh my let's take a little more the him it overcometh will I grant to sit with me might wrong know what are we to overcome that's a normal question that asks but that is not the actual thought in this verse is not so much what we have to overcome but how but no this is logical for it doesn't matter what we have to overcome as long as you know oh we can overcome a quick look at the scripture but Jesus overcome devil the temptation by the word is written we know that watch Adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me see this is the only way to be overcome it's the only way you can know if you're overcoming because that would can feel you have to be able to overcome by the word because God said it you're standing by it God said it you're staying with it is it if you have a dog in your mind don't do it and you know you're right should I should I should I should I don't do it you're right stay with the world oh my so brother Branham says watch he constantly apply the word Jesus he speak only what the father gave him to speak there was another time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom because was the wisdom of God in his personal life contending with himself this is big this is huge now this is Jesus are you at me in his personal life contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the Word of God Hebrews 11 says who in the days of his flesh when he offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears to him that was able to sit on that and was hurt and I was here that he feared door he was a son yet he learned obedience by the team that he suffered I know you're here that they're here not intellectually because us thought a soft are yet you only get his stuff and you you don't fit already yeah it's suffer not stuff sometime we suffered you leave before I come here by my learn obedience so see when we finish this service here nobody's complain if the roof all along you fix it yeah to flat tire fix it this happened fix it do some about each other will ship Garrick keeps women don't give up and wrong you that's what I'm saying but you see people feel entitled what if Paul said you're entitled Lord God don't know I'm a prophet to the jetpens this that's supposed to happen to me what was the people think shrimp or swim in sports around when I bought that sinking opposed I'm poor Paul would be bawling because he'd be drawing inside of a pole ship record everybody else had to fight up pull things off the shore get word light fire and all of a sudden a snake bite him now everybody know that sneakin that's Nick don't make joke in one minute you're gone and Paul just shake of the snake and continue anybody looking calm ten 10 nine eight seven six five four three two one understanding for say Jesus thinks I'll bite them and shall let them be snake-proof payments on a week is had a man used to bring snakes unless nicked by try the vitamin and was protected and say you know eventually as they buy them but he was trying to prove what courts say I'm not doing that nice his job if you want to do that let's feel free to go and do that but my point is this God proved himself Paul being shipwreck for we know all things work together for good to them that love God even when you shipwreck when the marriage when you're Homer when this happened and that happened even oh boy yeah shout in the house what was Jesus obedient to the Word of God then there will be not be one person there will not be one person who will sit on the tune of Jesus Christ unless he has been living that word your prayers your fasting your repentance is no matter what you presented God will not gain you the privilege of sitting on that throne it will be granted only to the word brand as at Roane is shared with the Queen understand this fasting is not all be faster as part of what you do but that is not what if God tell you something and you're fasting faster once they pick up that people from there you're faster you're faster once they pick up the people from there until you pick up a paper you're faster less reason than ever God is on your fast he said pick any paper you want a faster cutting it for you follow what God saying this word husband love your wife thank you would I didn't put that in so I would appreciate a feeling preacher would appreciate you know I didn't put a wife obey a husband I didn't write not the Bible cheering obey your parents debugger put that in oh hallelujah all right let's go on the home stretch now now the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you see the Lord you have to say where he loves us watch they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant baby with parental care but God said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen and salvation because God had chosen you to salvation should a sunny vacation on Spirit and belief of the truth he made me come he made me commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering there is no II Men on that one but I sell the word so we say Amen anyhow that don't mean you're gonna and Dad did the same amen to the truth I'll see it again just to get a confirmation he may commit you to suffering as he did jus he may commit to the deficit Paul that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not peace so gourds are the author over a frustrated a frustrated yeah you first reason Gordon order that you fight in obedience you fight in homeland yourself because if you humble yourself to the Word of God you will know all things work together for good say if you want this and God said not know you win me vegetable Gordon yeah angry with this one and angry that one no they're gonna believe that God know why you look at said no [Applause] hallelujah a father could shave a sun-kissed even for a

am mr. desperate so so help me God I was going on that bus I got any bus come on time mama I made it all glory to God and there's another bus coming we call it the rapture Express don't miss it make sure you get on board make sure you get the top let me grab a beer but a Brandon do a sunny little bean I think he suffered James 1 to the 4 count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations neither religion myself knowing this that the trying of your faith work patience let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanted nothing for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time there we go is that worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us all glory to God sister cormaneau is a no pain no suffering she has one of mine eyes everything is back everything is normal she's happy she's rejoicing she's shocked him she made it over but I want to make it over you want them make it over Oh glorious listeners unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer there in that should be a messy Vader you know that Tyson some time ago how to preach that one the other suffered I mean the reason for this is reason this reason there isn't character simply is never made without suffering that's why it's painful to see poor parenting and people spoil their children to debt our series is a painful thing mothers destroy sons destroy the one family by their behavior by their conduct by the operation I refuse him to be the kind of example that the children could see and reflect on when they time come they ruin their marriages and their homes and their lives and all your name of you love your child yeah a spoiler child if you only look how God handle his children and you try to emulate how God does that you'll be a whole different ball game altogether oh yes alright let's go character is simply never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character cannot dream because power upon character is satanic so when I see brothers ministers lying and deceitful and underhand and cover up or whatever it is I know they're not option for them it has not done for that or in a power yes temporary power people power people love your power and engine power woodland that's right microphone power but not power with God not not Jesus a man a priest of God not that that can come like that there has to be the right behavior but Romney's return the right kind of a son not son why can it have 20 different mangoes you know who hear the mango the mangoes the kind of mango it's a twenty sons kind of son you are the right angle and your behavior set your to be the kind not your mysteries not revelations letter convert that into behavior you have to convert all and revelations into a behavior which is a life and that is what could the the develop or glory to God a man without character can reign because power apart from karate a satanic but Paul with character fit to rule and since he wanted to share even the strewn on the same basis that he overcame and said on his Father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go true now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that would reveal in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter his kingdom through much tribulation so the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God disapproval neither the bright skies and still waters signs of God's love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world how does he love us yes how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifest that he loved us for he brought us to himself and give us his spirit placing us as sons how shall I prove my love to him are you ready ever your life are you ready how shall I prove my love to him by conducted by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy I missed the trials he in his wisdom allows come to pass that's how you pull back your love to God conduct yourself with joy believing what he said sure because of in his wisdom send those things now friends many things the people do and see I am NOT the judge of people but I think any ministry or any demonstration of the Spirit of God that can't be backed up in this Bible I would leave it alone if anything that anyone says that isn't backed up by the scripture I couldn't go with it although I wouldn't say it wasn't God till I seen the fruits of it then I would say nothing about it I'll just let it go like that so that is just a little side ba and this whole thing oh I'll skip that skip that the prophets of the Old Testament I want anytime they live in the presence of God until become with the word their message is the wood itself now the Holy Spirit will not miss me if I'm almost done musical calm please the Holy Spirit will not miss the a myself in one person and behave itself in another it will make here we go and we'll make each person come into its character because it's the spirit that leads you you are not all that natural anything you know there's a spirit influence in your life whatever Spirit is there's something influence in your life let's let's trust is the right influence but the Holy Spirit would bring each person into its character because it's a still that leaves you it makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature it makes you subject to its nature the Holy Spirit makes you live and love to do it oh you love to give up the things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in all right every word in the Bible is got thoughts latency form and if they receive into human being and spoke by the same thought that materias the Bible it brings it to pass I'll skip that I'll skip that all right okay so but Abraham okay I'm getting there what I'm talking about um each age God places two things into this church all right I'm showing that each individual that possess these qualities for money some virtues and this being this sub virtues being is the Church of God that's going to the rapture not this confession of mysteries no this being when it's completed is the church that's gonna rupture okay are you with me hallelujah and this being when completed is a servant of God in the church of god that's going in the rapture so every minister have to complete get is being completed to go in the rapture you see when that big magnet come that magnet that rapture magnet I want you to look at it now the magnet a pickup cloth a magnet can pick up wood so let's wrap your magnet could only pick up those virtues that magnet not coming up books on tapes are all around books or round tips you will stay with that creature Alicia with the books and his ears there's no rewrapped is about he told bound tabernacle you have to apply the token that's part next fact you have to display it applied and displayed displayed any we must see it remember Moses time take the blood and put it on the doorpost on this this this that when I see it I will pass over so there is something that must be displayed not talked I know pastors like to see your villain in mystery manifesting here alright that sounds kind of good the manifestation is son speak because the revealing hidden mysteries but bore a module on mysteries we can only echo what the prophecy ain't a man reveal a mystery Berman reveals you know that man of God a promise that it's almost one messenger to reveal every mystery that's why we could take the message than just every minister they don't judge him by his group your judge my how we stay with the word you can't judge me by my children you just may hope I stay with the word that's the only way you authorize to judge me all glories are going along I'm on the way you can't take me off you can't take me out all glory that God wants you on the way nobody could take you out hallelujah praise God in their glory so do you see it now all right it's sort of maybe next week this is too much boy Wow Mamma Mia we try to make weakness no excuses you want to tell how big we are how great we are and I think that's what scored give me this text for the little things that we do and become the church as the fine whale of false is that we can better ourselves we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places and see how little we are and put our trust and somebody that strong and the reason he chooses us when we say we're insufficient when we say I can't do it and you're feeling less down you feel unworthy you're feeling struggle in he knows that and yet he choose you and he knows your spirit on your condition and he says the reason he chooses us because we in that condition that song strange if God been willing we find out that weaknesses and rejections we find out that those people who are the weakest and rejected by the outside world is God heroes that's the Conqueror and the frontline doors that feel himself unworthy I met his brother three of them they said well Ron we just need the Holy Ghost know she received gifts to the ministry I said don't do it let it alone he said because we need the Holy Ghost and we need gifts you say unbecoming stuff it is always duel trying to get away from it easy no seed nothing got anything where you give it to you notice it takes the weakest and rejected and practically every hero God ever had on the front line was that type of person a person that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient a person that had no ability at all then that person is in good shape so God can start using them I have no ability Lord I can't talk this that when we are thinking that we're able to do it God can't use us because we wanted to do ourselves no watch so the other side we get these feelings and we think that we insufficient we don't want to do it and if we listen to the call of God that's the very thing that God wants us to do when we are in here we go this is a big thing when we are insufficient ourselves then we are subjects to you to God's theory as long as we think we can do it we can't do it when we get to a place where we know we can't do it then we heal ourselves to God and he does it if it's us trying to do it will feel but if we year ourselves to God then God can't fail that's one thing you can't do this feel the important thing what an important thing we must master remember this especially you young preachers only members are like there's one thing you have got to master if you expect to fulfill God's desire in our lives we have to master the thought of human ability if we get to a spot where we think we can do it with our own intelligence our own abilities we've got a master's in such a way that we can get rid of the things as laid aside so God can use us and make a complete surrender to us no ability when we expect in saying this guy is a great person this is a great person I'll lean on him that this piece is God so when our Minister put himself us as deal lampposts up hill anyhow lean on me God hates that it must be him it must be him working through the ministry it might be him in the man then you see God isn't that right no ability I don't care whose it is would ever be usable in the sight of God God has to get all our abilities out of us before he can achieve his purpose he's got something for us to do a lot only we do not pretty good job he never built use of God we have got together on human ability we have got to get to a place where we can surrender our souls lives even to the housewife to the farmer to the mechanic whosoever we are we gotta surrender completely to God knowing we are nothing and then God starts from there he starts moving working that includes all of us oh my what about him said the reason that Paul was fearing it's not because he was scared of anything but he was scared he would displease God in some way and he will get his own ability mixed up into it so he said I didn't come with excellency of speech I come to you in fear that and so forth I come to know only Christ and him crucified the greatest enemy I got is William Branham he's the one that's gets in God's Way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes ie thinks he can do something about it and when he does that she was going out the picture but when I can get rid of that guy then I could get to a place he's out of the way then God can come over and do things William Branham knows nothing about how many ministers could God use this morning if the only that God bind them with his word with his power and loosed them from the strength of dedi nomination an organization how many sins have people in a city this morning that goes to these great organization churches how many could fill with Holy Ghost said his country afar with the gospel and the power is the only take and lose themselves from the power that they have and be bound to the spirit power Paul had Moses realized look I'm almost done no no keep saying that but almost done Moses realized God took him back to the wilderness to learn some human weaknesses he puts your custom being really managed Egypt I mean copied rule for him the poor his right everyone got it sorry he took him back to learn well all about so he and where will he learn did he can listen grant must have had a time with him back there mood had a temper and God gave my wife my name is report she had one too so I imagine things wasn't so pleasing back on the backside a desert for a while when both of the temper get out of control at the same time I suppose his intellectual conception of how psychology or to control a person didn't do much good because he because on his road to Egypt she's still at his temper she said you're a bloody husband to me God was so angry that he's looking at the end and he could have found him a harmless lead watch human weaknesses here we go we'll never be used of God this is the point God by human weaknesses pause himself into you and he uses himself you just become an instrument because it got yourself out of the way did God feel sorry for Moses with all his weaknesses say poor little Moses something sho has happened to you you fell from your degree yeah yeah great intellectual brother you had your PhD you are weak no God wasn't sorry for him God never took pity on him God had him cured of all that stuff and he wasn't sorry for him oh my forty years out there I had you unzip or fasten kind of I'm gonna wilderness where they could find out their human riches are not and then on so forth oh my I think I want to read this one could I read something for you somebody tell Barbara he's just a nice man and nice person I'm so happy for that I'm saying program there's one thing one thing wrong what's that sister system one thing bird man that if you could just compromise with a little doctrine you have every organism will receive you he said I said I'm what doctrine sister that baptism in jesus name i said but sister you couldn't expect me to compromise on the word and still be a servant of god she said well there's a bunch of ministers I'm here to represent out of this big city and I if you tell them that the angel of the Lord that gives you these visions told you to baptized in Jesus name they will be willing to accept it he said well I said their experiences wicked and dishwater I don't care what any angel would see if it ain't according to the word I don't believe it if that angel told me something different from that I wonder the angel God word is first above all the engines that way you may say bring your insulin come because we have the word hey man - just what any angel is saying and por favor angel any other gospel let him be accursed [Applause] when Jacob lost all his strength then God give him power to become a prince when poor lost his education God made him a missionary to the Gentiles when Moses knows all of his ability become weak God making powerful to sell him to Egypt when you are weak then you are strong it's a simplicity of the gospel let's talk of the people they try to make us I'm great in the lecture of something it's the simpleness but God takes the very tool of unity and weakness and simplicity the work is work with oh my talk about the leader of the captain demons growing around powers of Devas under the name of Christianity teaching for doctrines the commandments of men who is strong enough who is wise enough to tame them Legion shipping off the woman then the name of preachers who is strong enough just the words I say that this American is pass what we need oh god I feel it pouring around here no well it needs a prophet I've gotta rise up
