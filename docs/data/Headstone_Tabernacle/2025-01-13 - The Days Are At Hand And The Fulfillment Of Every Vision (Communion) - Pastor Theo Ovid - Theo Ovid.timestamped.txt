[24:38] chter 12 we want to read from verse
[24:41] 21 to
[24:43] 28 Ezekiel chapter
[24:48] 12 and the word of the Lord came unto me
[24:50] saying son of man what is that proverb
[24:54] that you have in the land of Israel
[24:56] saying the days are prolonged
[24:59] and every Vision feel it tell them
[25:02] therefore thus sayeth the Lord God I
[25:06] will make this proverb to cease and they
[25:09] shall no more use it as a proverb in
[25:11] Israel but say unto them the days are at
[25:16] hand and the effect of every vision for
[25:20] there shall be no more any vain Vision
[25:24] nor flattering devation within the house
[25:27] of Israel
[25:29] for I am the Lord and I will speak and
[25:33] the word that I shall speak shall come
[25:35] to pass it shall be no more prolonged
[25:39] for in your days oh rebellious house
[25:42] will I say the word and will perform it
[25:45] seeth the Lord God again the word of the
[25:49] Lord came unto me saying son of man
[25:53] behold they of the House of Israel see
[25:56] the vision that he seeth is for many
[25:58] days to come and he prophesied of the
[26:02] times that are a far off therefore say
[26:06] unto them thus sayth the Lord God there
[26:10] shall none of my words be prolonged
[26:12] anymore but the word which I have spoken
[26:15] shall be done say the lord god let's
[26:18] pray Heavenly Father we thank you for
[26:20] your word and we pray your presence will
[26:22] come into it come among us and come upon
[26:24] your people speak to us we wait to hear
[26:26] from you in Jesus name ask it amen you
[26:29] may be seated oh praise the
[26:31] Lord before we have
[26:33] communion we have something that we want
[26:36] to share with you and have a title for
[26:39] this exhalation the days are at hand and
[26:43] the Fulfillment of every
[26:45] vision and have an
[26:47] inspiration the spirit of
[26:50] Prophecy now this month and next month
[26:53] is very interesting this January and
[26:55] February in January 2025
[26:58] a notable planetary alignment will occur
[27:01] featuring Mars Venus Jupiter and Saturn
[27:04] appear in night sky so six planets going
[27:06] to be aligned in this January month this
[27:09] event is expected to be most prominent
[27:11] between January 15th and 21st will Peak
[27:14] around January 17th and 18th during this
[27:17] period Venus and Saturn will be visible
[27:20] and so on like that
[27:22] and February 28th
[27:25] 2025 AR Ray alignment involving seven
[27:29] planets Saturn Mercury Neptune Venus
[27:32] Uranus Jupiter and Mars will be visible
[27:35] from the earth this phenomenon often
[27:38] referred to as a planetary parade is the
[27:40] visual effect resulting from the planet
[27:43] positions along the epileptic plane lot
[27:46] of high talk but God put these things
[27:49] for signs and
[27:50] Seasons okay let's go Genesis 1:14 and
[27:53] God said let there be lights in the
[27:55] firmament and the heavens to divide the
[27:57] day from the night and let them be for
[28:00] signs and for seasons and for days and
[28:05] for years so all that is happening now
[28:08] so strange fire and then the alignment
[28:11] of these planets six in January 7 in
[28:13] February and here it is but Bram hting
[28:17] on the wall he said at the junction of
[28:19] each age we have had several Junctions
[28:21] of time when time Runs Out man's ability
[28:26] fades
[28:28] take note when time Runs Out man's
[28:32] ability Fades Rian 10811 The Voice which
[28:36] I heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[28:39] and said go and take the little book
[28:40] which is open at the hand of the Angel
[28:42] which standed upon the sea and upon the
[28:44] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[28:46] unto him give me the little book he said
[28:48] unto me take it eat it up it shall make
[28:51] thy belly bitter the shab in th mouth
[28:53] sweet as honey I took the little book
[28:55] out of the Angel's hand and ate it up
[28:57] and it was my mou sweet as honey as soon
[28:59] as eaten it my belly was bitter he said
[29:02] thou
[29:03] must
[29:05] prophesy again I want to emphasize that
[29:08] must part that must part is the part the
[29:12] bride have to pick up thou must prophesy
[29:15] again before many peoples and Nations
[29:18] and tongues and Kings the Amplified you
[29:20] must make a fresh prophecy concerning
[29:22] peoples and races so Revelation 10 th
[29:25] must prophesy what what must we prophesy
[29:27] the word
[29:28] isn't that right so we must prophesy the
[29:31] word so all these 700 seeds of Revival
[29:34] of the Bride Revival and dynamic in the
[29:36] mechanic had to be prophesied by that
[29:39] Spirit of Prophecy that's my inspiration
[29:42] tonight the spirit of Prophecy praise
[29:45] God so the days at hand and the
[29:47] Fulfillment of every vision and the
[29:49] inspiration is the spirit of Prophecy so
[29:51] this all these promises for the bride
[29:54] exclusive promise for the bride seven
[29:57] give Faith show the bride how to prepare
[29:59] bride's Revival Holy Ghost Dynamics all
[30:02] these promises for the bride had to be
[30:04] spoken by a fresh prophecy brought by
[30:07] the word nothing outside of the word the
[30:09] word itself isn't that right so brother
[30:12] Branham restored this big prophetic
[30:14] Vision that we could speak by prophecy I
[30:17] like to say it like a puzzle you see the
[30:19] picture of the puzzle then you know how
[30:20] to fit the pictures all the pieces of
[30:22] the puzzle all everything mix up and
[30:24] jumble up but because you have the
[30:26] vision because have the picture on the
[30:28] puzzle box you could fit this here fit
[30:31] that there every it taking time but it
[30:33] going to be built up and when that
[30:35] prophecy going to complete it's
[30:36] fulfilled because when it's fulfilled
[30:38] you don't need to prophesy you said this
[30:41] day this scripture is fulfilled you
[30:44] don't have to prophesy when in its
[30:47] fulfillment but before it is fulfilled
[30:49] you prophesy but Los Angeles you
[30:52] prophesy about whatever to take place
[30:54] around the world we have to prophesy the
[30:56] bride must prophesy again oh praise God
[31:00] give the Lord some Praises Revelation 19
[31:03] let us rejoice and be glad give honor to
[31:05] him for the marriage of the Lamb is come
[31:07] and his wife had made herself ready and
[31:10] to her was granted that she should be a
[31:11] rain L fine and white clean and white
[31:14] for the fine linen in is the
[31:15] righteousness of saints he said unto me
[31:17] blessed the day which are called unto
[31:19] the marage supp of the Lamb he said unto
[31:21] me these are the true saints of God and
[31:23] I fell at his feet to worship Him He
[31:25] said unto me see thou do it not I am thy
[31:27] fellow servant of thy Brethren that have
[31:30] the testimony of Jesus worship God for
[31:33] the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[31:36] Prophecy so I want to hear say this
[31:38] today that the Dynamics is here in the
[31:42] form of the spirit of Prophecy and that
[31:44] is what we have had all these years we
[31:47] preaching what the promises that the
[31:48] prophet brought oh give the Lord some
[31:50] Praises we preached that by the spirit
[31:53] of Prophecy and we have had the
[31:56] testimony of Jesus and we have the
[31:58] testimony of Jesus which is the spirit
[31:59] of Prophecy that prophesy over you that
[32:02] you will have a Revival that you will be
[32:04] filled with the Holy Ghost glory to God
[32:06] that the quicking power will come upon

[57:26] which he was betrayed took
[57:28] bread and when he had given thanks broke
[57:32] it and said take eat this is my body

[57:41] me after the same manner also he took
[57:44] the cup when he had sted
[57:47] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[57:49] my blood this do he as often as he drink
[57:52] it in remembrance of me
[57:56] often as he eat this bread and drink
[57:57] this cup ye do show the Lord's death
[58:00] till he
[58:02] comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[58:05] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[58:07] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[58:10] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[58:13] examine himself and so let him eat of
[58:15] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[58:18] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[58:21] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
