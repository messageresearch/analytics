[15:36] bless you. Amen. As we brother Shane
[15:39] switch over. Amen. Praise the
[15:48] Lord. Moment of prayer.
[15:52] Oh God, our father, we thank thee again
[15:56] tonight for the privilege that we have
[15:58] of assembling ourselves together in
[16:01] praying. Thou has promised that you
[16:03] would hear from heaven and would answer
[16:06] our prayers and would heal the
[16:09] land. And God, if there ever was a land
[16:12] that needed healing, it's the land that
[16:15] we live in.
[16:17] And we pray that you will heal it by
[16:20] sending an old-fashioned revival that
[16:23] will cure it of its diseases, its
[16:27] spiritual
[16:28] ailments. Grant it, Lord. Thou has given
[16:32] us plenty of food, good clothes. But oh,
[16:36] how we long to hear the word of the
[16:40] Lord.
[16:41] Thou is said in the word there would
[16:44] come a famine in these
[16:46] days and people would run from the north
[16:50] to the south and from from coast to
[16:54] coast seeking to hear the word of God
[16:57] and would fail to find it.
[17:01] Oh God, anoint your ministers aresh.
[17:07] Lord, may we get out into the field with
[17:10] the
[17:11] word. Plank the real word. If there's no
[17:15] word, no seed sowed, there will be no
[17:19] harvest. Give us strength now while it
[17:22] is day that we might sew the seed of
[17:25] life to the dying and perishing
[17:28] millions. For we ask that in his name
[17:31] and for his glory.
[17:33] [Music]
[17:36] Amen. You may be
[17:48] seated. Those little handkerchiefs like
[17:51] that. That's perfectly all right to lay
[17:54] them up here. We have pray over them and
[17:56] we will have a great blessing of doing
[18:00] it and God has always honored
[18:03] it. Such little simple things as praying
[18:07] over a handkerchief.
[18:09] There's a young man here, a
[18:12] minister's
[18:14] brother's son from South Africa who was
[18:19] in my meetings down
[18:21] there. And I was at Cape Town and we had
[18:24] about eight big grass sacks full of
[18:28] mail. We didn't have time to minister to
[18:31] each and I was praying over those sack
[18:34] fulls of mail and the paper said brother
[18:37] Brandon is rather superstitious. He was
[18:41] praying over the
[18:46] mail. It's scripture to do so. It's the
[18:51] word of the
[18:52] Lord. Now tonight I want to try to get
[18:56] out early. I kept you late last night
[19:01] and I'm I'm sorry if I cause you to miss
[19:04] your buses and so forth. Now, tomorrow
[19:09] night, if the Lord is willing, I want to
[19:12] preach on the subject of the handwriting
[19:14] on the wall and the signs of the time.
[19:18] And
[19:19] then Friday night I want to preach on
[19:23] the subject if the Lord willing. Will
[19:25] the church go before the tribulation
[19:28] period? Yes or
[19:30] no? Then Sunday afternoon I want to
[19:33] preach on the subject will the eagle as
[19:35] the eagle stirs her nest and flutth over
[19:38] her
[19:39] young. I got to drive home Friday night.
[19:42] I'm bringing Mrs. Brandom and the
[19:44] children up. It's closed. It's only
[19:46] about 140 mi home. They don't get to see
[19:49] any of the meetings. And I'm fixing to
[19:51] go to Africa right away. And I just had
[19:55] a great message today that just thrilled
[19:57] my heart of about five nations sent word
[20:02] to me today for and there great men of
[20:07] the nations. They're calling for the
[20:09] ministry that's what would save their
[20:11] nation from communism. Oh, I was so
[20:14] happy to hear that. I was in one of the
[20:17] nations not long ago and a little baby
[20:20] died that morning at
[20:22] 9:00. And that night at about 10:00 when
[20:25] I finally got to the
[20:27] platform, the Lord God gave a vision of
[20:30] this little lady and her little baby
[20:32] come to life and it was healed. And all
[20:36] when that struck the papers the next day
[20:38] and the following night there was 20,000
[20:42] at one time gave their hearts to the
[20:44] Lord
[20:45] Jesus. This young man Mr. Toms sitting
[20:49] here he's somewhere I see spotted him a
[20:51] while ago. I wonder Tommy if you were in
[20:54] the Durban meeting when 30,000 got
[20:58] saved. Was you up there that time at the
[20:59] meeting?
[21:01] You wasn't there but you heard of it. I
[21:03] think your father was there. Tommy was
[21:05] just a little boy then. He's over here
[21:07] in Bible school now. And he was
[21:12] 30,000 blanket natives received Christ
[21:16] as personal savior at one
[21:18] time.
[21:21] Oh, God is so good, isn't he?
[21:25] I want to take a subject
[21:30] tonight that the Lord put on my heart
[21:33] today and unite it under one
[21:36] head. And I want to read for some
[21:39] scripture back in Genesis the 11th
[21:42] chapter and just the phase of the sixth
[21:46] verse.
[21:48] And the Lord said, "Behold, the people
[21:51] is
[21:54] one." Now, may he add his blessings to
[21:57] the reading of his
[22:00] word. The people is
[22:03] one. Now, Genesis means the
[22:09] beginning. And everything that there is
[22:12] today had that is had its beginning.
[22:18] And everything that there is began in
[22:21] Genesis. Remember life began in
[22:27] Genesis. Death began in
[22:31] Genesis. And all thoughts begin in
[22:36] Genesis. Right and
[22:38] wrong all begin in Genesis.
[22:42] If you study the scriptures real
[22:45] closely, you'll find out that even the
[22:49] isms and the cults of today had their
[22:53] beginning in Genesis. If you'll just
[22:56] watch Nimrod and and the different ones
[22:59] in the scripture, all them isms that we
[23:03] have today begin in Genesis. Now, today
[23:08] they polish it up and make it look like
[23:11] something else, but it's still that old
[23:14] evil spirit.
[23:17] If you'll watch the nature of it and the
[23:19] way it
[23:21] acts, you know, a few years ago when I
[23:25] was just a little boy, I was lived in
[23:28] the time of
[23:29] prohibition and they had old Charlie
[23:33] Barley Corn they called me. Many of you
[23:36] can remember that hideous looking
[23:39] person, his hat all caved in, his sto
[23:43] shoe shoulders stooped
[23:45] over, and such a horrible looking
[23:48] critter he was. That was Charlie
[23:53] Barnacorn. But you know, today he's
[23:56] become a polished up man.
[23:59] He ain't no more in the little brown
[24:02] jug and out on the corner where the red
[24:06] light district
[24:09] is. He lives in a bumper in everybody's
[24:13] ice
[24:14] box. But he's still Charlie Barleyorn
[24:19] just the same same old evil one.
[24:25] The Bible
[24:26] said, God in the Bible said, "My spirit
[24:31] will not always strive with
[24:36] man." And Jesus said in Matthew
[24:39] 24, "As it was in the days of Noah, so
[24:44] shall it be in the coming of the Son of
[24:46] Man."
[24:49] Did you notice the spirit of God was
[24:53] striving with
[24:55] man? Not man striving to know the spirit
[25:00] of God, but it was the spirit of God
[25:02] striving to get to
[25:06] man. And oh, how it parallels
[25:10] today. The spirit of God is striving
[25:14] with
[25:16] man. And I wonder if God doesn't think
[25:20] just about like he did in those
[25:22] times. It grieved him that he ever made
[25:26] man to see how rebellious man can be
[25:30] against his
[25:31] spirit and his
[25:34] program and his way of life for man and
[25:37] women.
[25:40] Now we see now in our text tonight that
[25:45] man had united themselves
[25:48] together and they had come from the east
[25:51] going
[25:52] west and they come to the valley of
[25:59] Shina. Civilization has always traveled
[26:02] from the east to the
[26:06] west. I wished I only had time. I like
[26:09] to speak on a message. When the east and
[26:13] the west
[26:14] meets, what
[26:16] happens? And it's already
[26:19] met. The east and west has met
[26:23] together. Man has traveled with the
[26:26] going down of the sun because he is a
[26:29] perishing
[26:32] creature. He's going with the sun rises
[26:36] and travels westward. Now the east and
[26:39] the west has
[26:40] met and as he goes on he gains knowledge
[26:45] all the time until now the wheel is
[26:48] turning backward
[26:51] again. Now we see that as they travel
[26:55] they come to this fair land and they
[26:58] united themselves as one
[27:02] people and that's all
[27:05] right but they hadn't united under the
[27:09] wrong
[27:11] leadership. They hadn't united under the
[27:14] leadership of man.
[27:18] And God wants man to unite under the
[27:20] leadership of
[27:23] himself. He wants us to be
[27:27] one. But he wants to be the one with
[27:32] us. But man wants his fellow man to be
[27:36] his
[27:37] leader and unite under the wisdom of his
[27:41] fellow man.
[27:44] And it is very
[27:47] striking to see how that man wants to be
[27:52] one. The reason that he wants to be one
[27:55] is because that God designed him for
[27:59] that
[28:02] purpose. God designed man, made him up
[28:05] to be
[28:06] one, to work together, to cooperate
[28:10] together.
[28:12] That's the makeup of
[28:14] man. That's the way God made him. But
[28:18] man always wants to have his idea about
[28:22] it. He wants to project something that
[28:26] God never intended him to
[28:29] do. He wants to figure his own ways
[28:32] out. He wants to make his own
[28:36] plans. He won't accept the plan that God
[28:39] made for him.
[28:41] because it's his fallen
[28:45] nature. God told him in the Garden of
[28:48] Eden that the very minute that he even
[28:51] touched that
[28:53] tree that trouble was in the
[28:56] road. But man taken from that tree and
[29:00] he become a scientific
[29:03] worker. And the very first bite that he
[29:06] took, he separated himself from his
[29:09] savior or his
[29:12] creator. And so is it
[29:15] tonight that man still lives by that
[29:21] tree. And there's no way in the world
[29:24] for a man to be saved by that
[29:27] tree. And why do we put so much emphasis
[29:31] on scientific
[29:33] research? How to save
[29:35] ourselves? To make a bomb that's better
[29:38] than Russia's to make a plane that can
[29:41] fly faster. Trying to save
[29:45] ourselves. Knowledge will never save
[29:48] you. It takes you farther away from God
[29:51] all the
[29:53] time. There's only one way of salvation.
[29:57] That's back to the tree of
[30:00] life. Knowledge isn't even even isn't in
[30:04] the
[30:06] picture. It's back to the tree of life.
[30:10] There was two trees. One was knowledge,
[30:12] the other was life. As long as a man ate
[30:15] from this tree, he lived. When he bit
[30:18] from that tree, he
[30:20] died. But you see, it's his nature to
[30:24] try to do something to save himself.
[30:27] There's not one thing that you can do to
[30:30] save yourself.
[30:33] Man said to me one time, he said, "Oh, I
[30:37] sought God and I sought God." I listened
[30:40] at him for a few moments and I said,
[30:42] "Sir, I don't want to disagree with you,
[30:45] but I have
[30:46] to. You never did seek God." And no man
[30:51] never
[30:52] did. It isn't man seeking God. It's God
[30:57] seeking
[30:59] man. It wasn't God going up and down the
[31:03] garden saying, "Adam, Adam, where art
[31:06] thou?" It wasn't man going up and down
[31:08] the garden saying, "God, God, where art
[31:11] thou?" It was God calling
[31:15] Adam. And God said in his
[31:18] word, "No man can come to me except my
[31:22] father draws him first.
[31:27] You're seeking to find what's drawing
[31:29] you, but it's God has to draw first.
[31:32] Amen. The scripture says
[31:35] that. And how true it
[31:38] is. But we find out here that they had
[31:41] united under one great
[31:45] leader. And when you get man under
[31:48] leadership of
[31:50] man, then he gets some ideas of his own.
[31:55] trying to achieve something that he can
[31:58] design or do
[32:00] himself and Nimrod had built them a
[32:05] tower. And it's very strange to think
[32:09] that how that all the things that the
[32:14] devil
[32:15] has, he stole the copyright from God to
[32:19] make
[32:20] it. Satan cannot create it.
[32:26] Satan is no creator. He's a perverter of
[32:30] something God
[32:32] created. That's the reason that there is
[32:35] no one that knows his Bible or knows God
[32:39] that would say that the devil can
[32:42] heal. Healing is
[32:45] creation. And if the devil can create,
[32:48] he could create himself a world and some
[32:50] people. But he cannot create. He
[32:53] perverts what God has created.
[32:57] What is
[32:58] unrighteousness? It's righteousness
[33:01] perverted.
[33:05] Everything that you see that's
[33:07] wrong, just do absent and you'll be
[33:12] right. For
[33:14] unrighteousness is righteousness
[33:16] perverted.
[33:19] then you've got the right
[33:21] to. And remember that anything that man
[33:25] does that's outside the plan of God,
[33:28] it's
[33:29] perverted. No matter how good it looks,
[33:32] it's still
[33:35] perverted because God's got his original
[33:38] idea and he gave it to man and man wants
[33:41] to make something of his own self. He
[33:45] wants to have something to do to it.
[33:48] Israel made its greatest mistake in the
[33:51] 19th chapter of Exodus after grace had
[33:54] provided a
[33:56] sacrifice. Grace had provided a savior,
[34:01] Moses. Grace had provided a
[34:05] deliverance. And yet they wanted
[34:07] something to do themselves. Give us the
[34:10] law. And they never did keep it. and
[34:13] they couldn't keep
[34:14] it. But it's all falls back to its God
[34:19] who does all good
[34:22] things. United under one head, the wrong
[34:26] head. Did you notice the devil always
[34:30] wants to use a man's
[34:34] head? Give him some
[34:36] knowledge. How many people go to choose
[34:40] their minister? the one who's coming to
[34:43] your church. Oh, he has a a
[34:47] PhD. Oh, he's just the guy for our
[34:51] church. I'd rather have a man that
[34:54] didn't know his ABCs and know God.
[34:59] But you see, you think it's because he's
[35:02] got an
[35:03] education. He looks at the
[35:06] eye. Now, that's the same lie that the
[35:10] devil told Eve.
[35:12] He said it is pleasant to the
[35:16] eye and the eye always is by the
[35:21] head and all that it is is death dressed
[35:26] up. It's garbage with a little whipped
[35:29] cream over the top of it. That's
[35:33] right. They'll see these pictures along
[35:36] our
[35:37] roads of lovely young
[35:40] women standing saying we smoke
[35:44] Chesterfields and it makes the young
[35:47] woman today want to be like
[35:50] that because she wants to be
[35:54] popular. Why? It's the same lie and the
[35:58] same liar behind it, the devil
[36:02] that makes sin look pleasant.
[36:07] It's only death dressed
[36:09] up. And they'll put some kind of a sign
[36:12] board out of some little lady nice
[36:17] looking and some kind of a little
[36:20] immoral looking
[36:22] clothes and she thinks, "Oh, that's just
[36:26] pretty. It's looking at it through the
[36:29] eye, but it's death dressed up.
[36:34] That's all it is.
[36:37] Death
[36:39] formed in the form of
[36:41] beauty. And remember, beauty is
[36:44] deceitful.
[36:46] It was Satan's idea to make a better and
[36:49] a more prettier kingdom than
[36:52] Michael's. Beauty was the downfall to
[36:55] begin with.
[36:58] And the devil has used that ever since.
[37:04] What a thing it is
[37:06] today to see that the kingdom of the
[37:10] devil is made so
[37:13] pretty. A lot of people fall for it. Now
[37:16] remember, the devil is
[37:19] religious. Many people likes to go down
[37:21] to a
[37:23] church that's got great big high steeple
[37:27] on it and seats that's so plush.
[37:32] No wonder the preacher can't preach but
[37:34] 15 minutes you'd go to sleep in such a
[37:38] place and with a great big milliondoll
[37:42] pipe
[37:43] organ and with the pastor with his
[37:46] collar button in the back and a long
[37:49] robe on with some kind of a little ear
[37:51] tickling something of some society or
[37:55] about some politics. Well, we don't want
[37:59] that. the real child of God if he has to
[38:03] stand on the street corner or in a
[38:05] little old mission and hear the word of
[38:08] God preached in the power and
[38:10] demonstrations of the Holy Ghost.
[38:16] But it's
[38:18] science. It's man's
[38:21] organization. Man organizes himself. Oh,
[38:26] how good it is to hear sometime the
[38:29] people say, "I am a
[38:32] Presbyterian. I am a
[38:35] Methodist." Not slamming you, my
[38:37] brethren. I'm only trying to show a
[38:40] truth.
[38:43] But if you had to say you were
[38:47] Pentecostal, it would dampen your
[38:49] spirit. And that kind of a spirit ought
[38:52] to be dampened.
[38:54] [Music]
[38:58] You say it kills the spirit. Well, any
[39:01] spirit that could be killed by the name
[39:03] of Pentecost ought to be killed. That's
[39:06] right.
[39:09] Pentecost is not an
[39:11] organization. Pentecost is an experience
[39:14] that comes to all the born again
[39:18] church. Oh, I know that man's tried to
[39:21] organize it and have did it. They've
[39:23] organized a group of people, but they
[39:25] can't organize Pentecost.
[39:27] [Applause]
[39:28] Pentecost goes to Methodists, Baptists,
[39:31] Presbyterians, or whoever wants it.
[39:35] But they make an organization out of it.
[39:38] That's man, the devil working on his
[39:42] head. Something that he has to see. Our
[39:46] denomination is bigger than the other
[39:48] fellows. Can't you see that old devil?
[39:52] Don't die. It lives on.
[39:56] We are greater than somebody
[39:59] else. A little girl, she looks
[40:04] like she was an alcoholic and she was in
[40:08] one of the greatest Protestant churches
[40:12] in the States the other day giving a
[40:14] testimony.
[40:15] And the people wept when she told them
[40:18] how that she had been brought from a
[40:20] drunkard's grave where five of the best
[40:24] doctors in the nation said she's
[40:27] hopeless. The
[40:29] AA alcoholic synonymous give her up as a
[40:33] hopeless case. And when she come to the
[40:37] platform, the Holy Spirit said, "Rosella
[40:41] Griffin, you are an
[40:43] alcoholic." and so and so and such and
[40:46] things has happened. But thus saith the
[40:49] Lord and she was delivered.
[40:52] She gave her testimony. The people wept
[40:55] and after a while somebody said, "Oh,
[40:57] she was a darling child, but she's
[41:04] Pentecostal." Don't you see that old man
[41:08] made greeneyed devil? Amen.
[41:14] Oh, you can't polish it up. It's still
[41:16] sin and unbelief.
[41:19] I don't care if it was a Jehovah witness
[41:22] or any other kind of a witness. As long
[41:25] as God's there, I'll be with him.
[41:30] Correct?
[41:33] When God moves in the spirit, his
[41:36] children moves with him.
[41:43] Someone's recorder. I'm
[41:45] sorry. I'm not
[41:48] excited, but I feel real religious.
[41:53] Oh, there's just something about it gets
[41:56] all over you. The work, not all over
[41:58] you, but all in
[42:00] you. It moves every little fiber inside
[42:04] of you.
[42:06] Man works by his head and looks by his
[42:11] eye. See the devil said to the woman,
[42:15] "Oh, the tree is pleasant." She said,
[42:18] "It's good to look
[42:19] at." See that same devil, if he can get
[42:22] you to stop just for a minute,
[42:26] he can make you reason it out.
[42:30] He can make you think with your mind.
[42:34] But God doesn't use the man's
[42:37] head. God uses his part.
[42:42] God works on his heart while the devil
[42:44] works on his head.
[42:49] God chose the
[42:50] heart. The Bible said, "As a man
[42:54] thinkketh in his heart, so is he."
[42:58] there. Some time ago, years ago, the
[43:02] scientists said, "Well, God sure made a
[43:06] mistake there because there is no mental
[43:09] faculties in the human heart to think
[43:12] with." Yeah, he meant your head. If God
[43:16] would have meant head, he'd have said
[43:18] head. But he said heart, so I believe he
[43:22] meant heart. Amen.
[43:26] Then you know about 5 years ago I was in
[43:29] Chicago I seen a great piece in the
[43:31] headlines of the paper where that
[43:33] science had found that in the human
[43:36] heart not the animal heart in the human
[43:39] heart there's a little compartment that
[43:41] doesn't even have a blood cell in it. It
[43:44] was the abiding place of the
[43:48] soul. So man does think with his heart.
[43:51] After all, God was right.
[43:55] And we'll find out every time that God
[43:58] is right.
[44:01] He thinks with his
[44:03] head, but he believes in his heart.
[44:08] Now the devil thinks through his mind to
[44:12] show him something with his eye, but his
[44:16] heart will make him believe
[44:19] something that would be impossible to
[44:22] look at because it's the faith that he
[44:26] has in his heart. He believes with his
[44:29] heart for things that he can't see. And
[44:32] the devil turns around and takes his
[44:34] head and makes him scientifically prove
[44:36] something. and his heart turns around
[44:38] and denies
[44:40] it. Oh, if we could get away from our
[44:44] head knowledge and head religion to
[44:46] heart religion where God could go to
[44:48] work in the
[44:51] church out of our head into our
[44:55] heart. A man believes in his heart. He
[45:00] thinks with his head believes in his
[45:02] heart.
[45:05] Now the mind reason things. The heart
[45:09] doesn't reason at all. It just believes
[45:12] what God said. But you see today we're
[45:15] so scientific. Oh, we Americans anyhow.
[45:19] We are so scientific. It has to be all
[45:23] proved out to us. In the old days when
[45:26] someone said the Lord did a miracle,
[45:28] they just believed it. They thought
[45:31] that's all right. Thank the Lord for it.
[45:33] But today, oh, we've got the scientific
[45:37] take it down and prove it. And if it can
[45:40] be proved scientifically, then it's not
[45:43] faith anymore.
[45:47] Oh, I hope you get that.
[45:50] If it's scientific, it isn't faith
[45:52] anymore.
[45:54] What if Moses would have said, "Wait a
[45:56] minute
[45:57] here. Let me stop for a minute.
[46:01] What kind of a chemical spray has been
[46:04] put on that
[46:05] tree? Them leaves are on fire, but
[46:08] they're not
[46:10] burning. You know what I'll do when it
[46:13] quits burning? I'll pick off some of
[46:15] those leaves and take them down to the
[46:16] laboratory and I'll have them uh the
[46:19] chemicals analyzed and just find out
[46:23] what kind of a scientific thing this is.
[46:27] If he would have had that kind of a
[46:29] thought, God would have never said,
[46:31] "Take off your shoes."
[46:34] What did he do? He walked up humbly. He
[46:38] didn't care what the fire how it was
[46:41] burning or where the tree burnt up or
[46:42] not. He was searching for God. And every
[46:46] other child of God will believe it the
[46:48] same way.
[46:50] He heard a voice that said, "Take off
[46:52] your shoes, Moses. You're on holy
[46:55] ground.
[46:57] If you go down to the meeting tonight,
[47:01] and you come down to find some kind of a
[47:03] fault, the people make too much noise,
[47:06] the preacher preaches too long, I can
[47:09] scientifically tell you there's people
[47:11] there that's weary, they ought to stay
[47:13] up that long at night, go ahead. But
[47:17] those who come with their shoes on,
[47:21] with their head knowledge left behind
[47:24] and a heart open for God, you'll hear a
[47:26] voice say,
[47:28] "I am the resurrection and the life."
[47:34] I'll go down to count how many members
[47:36] of my church attended that revival and
[47:39] I'll hurry right back to tell the pastor
[47:42] that our good Presbyterian Methodist
[47:45] Baptist brethren are down there. What a
[47:48] disgrace. Well, there you go again. Back
[47:52] with the head. God deals with the heart.
[47:57] Now, the reason that that little
[48:00] compartment that's in your heart, God
[48:03] molded you that way. That was for a
[48:06] purpose. That little place in your
[48:08] heart, all the rest of your body belong
[48:11] to him, to
[48:12] you. But that heart belongs to
[48:16] God. that God made himself a little room
[48:19] in there so he could sit in the
[48:21] controlling tower
[48:23] that he could guide.
[48:26] Blessed be his holy name.
[48:30] Oh, if we would let him be the pilot and
[48:33] the Holy Ghost the co-pilot,
[48:36] [Music]
[48:37] we would be guided over this sea of
[48:39] life.
[48:41] It's his control
[48:43] room. But what did man do? He listened
[48:46] to his fellow man and accepted the devil
[48:48] in there and the devil come into it and
[48:51] he guides him to the things that he can
[48:54] see. God guides him to the things that
[48:56] he say. No wonder people can't believe
[48:59] in divine healing with the devil sitting
[49:01] up there saying, "Don't you believe it?"
[49:03] Yes, Mr. Devil. That's
[49:05] right. But God sits in the heart and
[49:09] makes his word real to everyone that
[49:11] believes it.
[49:13] Though it may not come to pass, maybe
[49:15] they can't do it, but they believe it
[49:17] anyhow because God said so.
[49:22] Abraham when he was told he's going to
[49:24] have a baby by
[49:26] Sarah, she was 65 years old then and he
[49:30] was
[49:31] 75. What a ridiculous sight. An old man
[49:34] 65 or 75 and a woman 65 going downtown
[49:38] buying up all the pins and the bird
[49:40] eyee. I want to have the baby. Well,
[49:43] what do you think the doctor would have
[49:45] thought? It said, "Sir, we want to make
[49:47] arrangements for the baby." Ever had one
[49:48] before? No. How old are you, Sarah? 65.
[49:52] What? How old are you, Abraham? 75. What
[49:56] you doing with all those little booties
[49:57] and things? We're going to have a baby.
[50:00] Oh, I can scientifically prove to you
[50:03] she's 20 years of past
[50:06] menopause. Why, you're ignorant. But
[50:08] Abraham called those things which were
[50:11] not as though they were because God said
[50:14] so.
[50:15] [Applause]
[50:17] And as the years went by, he got
[50:19] stronger.
[50:21] The first 30 days, Abraham said, "Sarah,
[50:23] how you feeling, honey?" No different.
[50:25] Bless God, we'll have it
[50:27] anyhow. Right?
[50:29] The first year passed, Sarah, how you
[50:32] feeling, honey? No different. Praise
[50:34] God. We'll have it anyhow. 20 years
[50:36] pass. How you feeling, Sarah? No
[50:38] different. Praise God. We'll have it
[50:40] anyhow.
[50:42] Why? God said so.
[50:45] It wasn't in his head. It was in his
[50:47] heart.
[50:50] God don't speak in the head. He speaks
[50:51] in the heart.
[50:54] That's where God lives. But if God's on
[50:57] the throne, he stirs you. He makes you
[50:59] go and see the things that he wants you
[51:02] to see. And you turn your eyes from
[51:03] things that the devil talks about. You
[51:06] stay right with
[51:08] God. Oh, how and we being Abraham's
[51:12] children. The Bible said that we being
[51:15] dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed
[51:18] and we're heirs according to the promise
[51:21] and we can't believe God for 25
[51:24] minutes. And Abraham believed him for 25
[51:29] years and then had to take the child up
[51:31] to kill it to confirm the oath again.
[51:35] And then we're the children of Abraham.
[51:37] I wonder sometime if we were the
[51:39] children of Abraham, we'd have Abraham's
[51:42] faith in God and would call the things
[51:45] contrary to God's word as though they
[51:48] were already
[51:49] happened. If we were the children of
[51:52] Abraham. Now, I know this is rude,
[51:56] friends, but it's true. Now, we notice
[51:59] then God takes the heart. He takes
[52:01] control. Now when sin came in and upset
[52:05] your heart and and the devil come in and
[52:10] thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord. Thank
[52:12] you Lord. Thank you father for your word
[52:14] oh God in due season. Thank you Lord
[52:17] Jesus. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[52:19] Blessed be your wonderful name. Thank
[52:22] you father. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank
[52:24] you Lord Jesus. Blessed be the name of
[52:26] the Lord. Oh praise your wonderful name.
[52:30] Amen. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Now, we're
[52:33] going to switch over to the Lord's
[52:35] Supper. So, let's turn to our Bibles at
[52:37] this time to First Corinthians chapter
[52:41] 11. Thank you, Lord
[52:50] Jesus. Amen. Heavenly Father, we pray
[52:53] bless the reading of the scriptures Lord
[52:56] and bless this portion of the service
[52:58] Lord in Jesus name.
[53:02] Amen. 1 Corinthians chapter 11
[53:05] [Music]
[53:08] 23-32. For I have received of the Lord
[53:12] that which also I delivered unto you,
[53:15] that the Lord
[53:16] Jesus the same night in which he was
[53:19] betrayed, took
[53:21] bread, and when he had given thanks, he
[53:24] broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is
[53:29] my body which is broken for you. This do
[53:32] in remembrance of
[53:35] me. After the same manner also he took
[53:38] the cup when he had sucked, saying,
[53:41] "This cup is the new testament in my
[53:43] blood. This do ye as oft as you drink it
[53:47] in remembrance of me. For as often as
[53:50] you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[53:53] ye do show the Lord's death till he
[53:56] comes.
[53:58] Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[54:00] and drink this cup of the Lord
[54:02] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[54:05] and blood of the Lord. But let a man
[54:08] examine himself. And so let him eat of
[54:11] that bread and drink of that cup. For he
[54:14] that eateth and drinkketh
[54:16] unworthily eateth and drinkketh
[54:18] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[54:21] Lord's body.
[54:24] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[54:27] among you and many sleep. For if we
[54:31] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[54:34] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[54:37] chasened of the Lord that we should not
[54:40] be condemned with the
[54:42] world. Amen. Let's just bow our heads
[54:44] and close our
[54:46] eyes. Amen. Our heavenly father, Lord,
[54:51] your people have gathered this evening,
[54:53] Lord, to fellowship around your word and
[54:55] Lord to obey the ordinance of feet
[54:58] washing and and communion. Lord,
[55:02] partaking of the bread and wine, a
[55:03] symbol of the body and blood of the Lord
[55:06] Jesus. Father, I pray Lord that you
[55:08] would sanctify our hearts and cleanse
[55:10] our hearts, Lord, by your precious
[55:13] blood. Lord, may our hearts burn with
[55:16] love for you, Lord. burn with the fire
[55:18] of God, Lord, that we would become
[55:21] better Christians, Lord, true believers,
[55:24] Lord, that a revival spirit will spark
[55:26] off in the lives and homes of the
[55:28] believers, Father. Lord, may it start
[55:31] even this evening, Father. Lord, that
[55:33] and we will grow in your love, Lord, and
[55:36] this and get in the spirit of the coming
[55:39] of the Lord, Father. Lord, as we partake
[55:42] now, Lord, to of your your bread and
[55:45] wine, Lord, may you touch each one,
[55:47] Lord. May you heal, may you strengthen
[55:50] your people, Father. And Lord, as we
[55:52] would wash one another's feet, Lord, may
[55:54] we do it with humility and the spirit of
[55:57] love and brotherhood, Father. We commit
[56:00] our lives now into your hands, Father,
[56:02] and the entire congregation in Jesus
[56:05] name with thanksgiving. Amen. And amen.
[56:09] We want to observe a moment of silence
[56:11] where you would pray for the ministry
[56:13] and the ministry would pray for you at
[56:15] this time.
[56:37] Praise the name of the Lord. So at this
[56:39] time you may be seated as the deacons
[56:43] and the elders get ready to
[56:48] serve. Praise the name of the Lord. His
[56:50] brothers the back.
