heads or with a prayer tonight as we are push forward to the service I want to pray for one Sherry McIntosh for her to be loosed from under the power of Darkness and from the house of Hell she's trapped let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for gladness together for this time for him and I pray that you would Inspire and a few words that will be shared with your people that it will Minister unto them and entrance that they could enter into the channel of prayer where they could break through Father prayer bless this prayer meeting tonight bless them in their homes may they receive a special visitation tonight in the name of Jesus and father I bring Cherry Macintosh before you that you will lose her from under the power of darkness and deliver from the house of hell take out of that trap condition Lord and fear fear we preach you have done a work in our heart before you can come and do so again may she be delivered tonight in Jesus you might ask it amen God bless you things and welcome and before I read the scripture uh as one of you heard with the night service uh what is your excuse and um I really thank God for the focused thought that was presented to us and you know many times most times when I pray in for Kuala will speak or exalt or share anything at all I would ask the Lord to drop his thoughts into their hearts put his words upon their lips that we could be edifying so regardless of who it is I listen to hear God I listen to hear things that I know is the spirit speaking because God could use any one of us and but he is limited to our surrender if we're going to see that tonight it will change your perspective and you would see the need to pray in other words the spirit of God even though God could do things he has to get a channel to you that's why you're looking for your hands and your feet and your attitude and your words and and your prayer note that Jesus explained this he says you pray the Lord of the harvests that he would send laborers into the house because the Harvest is right but the leverages few and but Ibrahim said that God set it up that way that it doesn't happen till we pray it doesn't happen to be called can we asked to repeat that is how it is set up in other words we could know the prophecy that with a mighty hand he's going to deliver we know the deliverer is coming and he could sit down he could sit with your more clues you could sit with a bad attitude your consistency will grow it from your system awaiting on it but that's not how it works when God came down to Moses his first thing I have heard the Christ of my people now if it was simple that because God said it and you believe it and that settlement in that context then you just sit back and relax you know but it wasn't like that God so I realized now why pressure comes we don't like pressure but we're not doing the things we're supposed to do we're making excuses but pressure come to force the issue this is what is about so it's like Joseph dreams put pressure on his Brethren who was jealous of him to sell him out D1 the pressure they can't handle this young man with Revelation inspiration and love of the father with a rainbow quote that was the issue he committed on the cause they dump it Joseph no under pressure pain of losing his family and getting a whole new different environment and he had to survive there with his Revelation with his vision with his testimony we know the story but if our wife in prison until until the man remember me the Butler and the man forgot him because he wasn't ready yet and many times we won't go to do things but we're not ready yet we don't know we're not ready we think we are ready and we wanted to work out and we find is a is a pain because it's not what we expect live then turn out the way we want it to turn out and we get disappointed we end up living in the Gap and again we're not living in a kind of state of consistency about God but when you look closer you realize a lot of things are dependent on prayer so let's see tonight that this session here that we're having is the core behind the service on Sunday behind decision on Wednesday night in other words this is the Indian room of the power or the inspiration or the anointing that's in the church this is where that's something different understand this we are humans God put us on the spirit with our own Wills our desire our own man has achieved a lot of things without God companions have stopped without God Science and Technology a lot of stuff man thinking and God gave him the ability to be creative God given the ability to have imagination and what they imagined they could have something like that and because of that you could really do great stuff as a human being on it even without God but the thing about it for the spirit of God to work or the spirit of God that knows the things of God to work we he has to find people that make himself available so whatever you yield to God that's what he could use you want to sing you could use your voice but your heart want to be right here you could use your feet your hands whatever whatever you want to yield to him no he want our entire being that he could express himself to us no Satan is the same Satan remember he doesn't belong here he was kicked out and that spirit that leave the spirit looking for vessels and temples and and things to work through and once you see an opening he slips in and we call that a back door once he gets a back door whether in your life by sin like whatever it is in your home and your family by the things that you do a back to any back door you slip them and he slips in to make Havoc he's not thinking of good things you know to make havoc in your life and so on like that so tonight I trust them that the few words I share with edifying you and help you that you could see and get a burden to pray and when the devil tried to stop your mouth and shut you up and whatnot you have to break past that because you as a son or a doctor of God has access to the father I call upon his name so if you have your Bibles I like to read at least two portions of scripture from Ezekiel nines you're pretty familiar with one to six and also First John 3 18 to 22. very interesting here tonight uh is the kill nine now let me say this before we continue don't let pray for me be an excuse for you not praying you somebody say pray for me I pray for me I pray for me and you saying pray for me because you're lazy pray for me because you're not praying pray for me that can't work cut that out that is childish thing when I was a chance take like a child I'm gonna shoot like a child I'm gonna become a man they put away childish things you have to pray you do the same you do praying you have to be repentance all right Ezekiel 9 reading from verse one he cried alongside my ears with a loud voice saying cause them to have charge over the city they're drawn near even every man with a destroying weapon in his hand praise God uh uh everybody hear me tonight everybody's hearing me tonight but let's continue um and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which light was in North everymanus photo weapon one man among them a school with linen my writer was ink one by side they spent it and Stood Beside the bridge North and the glory of the god of Israel was gone up from the Cherub where upon he was to The Treasure of the house and he called to the man ruled with linen that which had the righteous ink on by side and the Lord said unto him go to the midst of the city now this is not church it's not who your pastor is where you go to church and fellowship they're not there's nothing with full and the Lord said unto him go to the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem I set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that signed Christ all the Abominations that be done in the midst of us and to the others he said in my hearing going after him to the city and smite let not your eyes fear leads little children women that come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at My Sanctuary then they bring it on the ancient men which would be her for the house so listen whenever the Seal of God breaks out No Authority Church judgment is next reading First John 3 reading from Verse 18 to 22. my little children let us not love in wood neither in tongue but indeed and truth so here sin is not quotes it is that scripture is not belief it's going beyond that love can be in Word when talk which is tongue but indeed an intrude okay it was 19. and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall have four Hearts before him now if our hearts condemn us God is greater than our heart and with all things beloved if our heart come there must not then we have confidence towards God now listen to this sub Clause I call it like a clause you know actors shall be given think you shall find lock on the door shall be open listen to verse 22 here now and whatsoever we ask we receive of him why because we keep his Commandments which is obedience like what given talking about on Wednesday night and do those things that are pleasing in a sight so you hear us shall be given and people ask you an Ocarina what not but are you in obedience are you doing this thing that pleases him because if you're doing those things we receive from him okay let's go you see the Holy Ghost said he only sealed those who wept inside for the abomination of the city the title of what I want to share tonight ever taught seal Dunes you have a dose see you do not everyone so you do and he says who would he steal in the cities of night who lay on their face day and night crying for the sins in the city now I don't believe he's expressing somebody that say prayers or your prayer thing I believe this thing about sign and crying is deep it's not a light thing it's not something that you hear much in the message as a good time and crime people like talk Fellowship Revelation Mysteries information I never heard such so when I call it was presented but at the end of the day when that is stripped when you are alone whether you are tonight in your home on your room Wherever You Are and you come down to sign and cry that's personal that has nothing to do with huge corporate that has to do with individuals he says if he was an obedient child he loved his father no matter what any other boy said on the next round he knew what his father wanted do you know what your father want that means having a knowledge of God's will for your life and knowledge of the good and knowledge what is required of you no matter what any of the other boys at the next farm he knew what his father wanted watch he could tell from the way he built and what he did what he wanted and a man that's the Son of God reads the Bible and see what God was yesterday he's a sing today and believe him to be deceiving principle in power and everything else Hebrews 38. now then he said when he proved to be a true son here's what the father did to come out to the public place in the street and then he took his son set him up clothed him at rope special role for a special occasion and then there was ceremony where his father adopted him his own family now this is plain there's no complications with this there's no hidden Mystery behind this it is very simple I've got to get the answer if we please him on the back which is when you pray pray to the father who's eating secret and the father who's eating secret to contribution openly openly means you will see the Joy on you in which he feet on you you would even see the glory of God upon you you would see eventually adoption upon you because the father would reward you okay so it's not a matter you promoting yourself I am this I am that you have a flapped a wave there's no flock to weave he said he will let it be known among men it will speak for itself so actually any man pumping himself something another man asking I don't get what should we have he not on track he's not on track because it takes God to identify this is my beloved Son to whom I will please the people don't do that a lot of men like the the the the the um this ceremony of from the people they love him so much and everything is like that but it's not it's not the people this is Father and Son okay and then anything that son did was answered by the father this fan name was good as a check or the father was we know that was adoption now when we receive the Holy Ghost prophecy it's just isn't a jump and shock of it it isn't just to speak with tongues and run over the floor it isn't to organize a group and say we got it the rest of them haven't it's it's to work here we go with love and humility as Christ come to do with them Drop Distance out of here this will all men know that you are my disciples when you have loved one father love is from not with tangible love is something that is expressive love is something that you could feel love is something that you could be aware of that you know child know if you love the dog no dog's tail so if you are a vibrating expression sharing and so on the love of God it will be felt it will be known it will be unfolded as God's love again I want to ask you a question we take so much emotion over religious ideas like this is like like people think they are spiritual but they're very religious spiritual is different you see but spiritual you can bear with others but religious you can't stand this one and it comes to an argument but watch who in the city tonight in Jacksonville that is so concerned about the Lost World in this last day and even spends here we go 13 minutes a night free in for the sins of the city but according to the scripture the angel of God was told to seal those who signed up right questions are you one of those those are those that he's talking you know sometimes I'm praying and I be praying ordinary let's say ordinary just saying words to God and then no something just break and it goes deeper and then it's not just words coming up no it's a hard thing it's a heart for me and then no you're looking to pray till you break through you ever was praying and like it did a sheet over your head and you're praying not going anywhere and you pray and your boss too it's almost like if there's something hanging over that is when you preach through you're not giving up you want to be able to preach no put into takes time so it's not just well okay we have a time of prayer and this is your weekly deposit of prayer you yourself have to have a desire that you want to break you if you don't even know what that is you should want to know what it is don't leave yet and then they begin to cry out there's another way you don't hear people don't cry out remember the only days people will be falling asleep in parameters and just you know losing their eyes and they say the praying in their mind they're all kinds are tough and a lot of things just going on in the mind but God wants you to talk to him this is zoom prayer meeting give us an opportunity to be in a room together with your room but yet you are home by yourself no I don't know what if the neighbors are wrong or whatnot but you could really have a passionate time in talking to the Lord and and sharing your burdens and sharing your concern let me just finish wrap up here reasonable okay so what I want to talk about who is consumed that we spend 30 minutes a night praying for the sins of the people and as as you said 30 minutes at night understand this but us param talk about making praying a habit I was thinking about if we ask what is your routine no no I'm an early writer and that's that's just how I am you have to know what is your routine because if you don't have system if you don't have something that you do like on a daily basis that it becomes part of your habit you'd find yourself scratching you'd find yourself not being able to account for all your time is unfolded so for example somebody could rise early in the morning let's say four five because pretty even half an hour pray five to half past five if they want to do some work they could go half past five to six and then they could have their breakfast and this becomes a routine a reason when they could stretch it from five to six in prayer and that becomes a rhythm it's not like a fighting because you see it all adds up the discipline and and this is where people are running from they don't want accountability and they don't want the discipline but this is what being a disciple is all about this is what Jesus call is man to be about to be disciplined ones or disciples followers of and and and people don't want that they don't want to be really taught how to follow many people want to lead but they don't know how to and we have to learn to follow and the Bible talk about those who are of authority over you follow them who are examples of the faith you have to be able to see it whose Faith follow whose Faith follow their conversation who Faith follow their way of life you have to see feet applied Faith growing feet manifested you have to see vision and what Vision does and why we do what we do and to see the results because everything we do have an end game you know everything we do have a result you plant think it takes some time to unfold but they produce fixed for you plant orange it takes some time to unfold but you get oranges you plant watermelon they sometimes to unfold but you get watermelon whatever we gonna read so if we plant habits habits could bring in character by virtue of you know it come like automatic subconscious like we say like when a child is not willing to write have a three wheel and have a like guide Wheels but afterwards they don't need no guide Wheels when they get older you just write you don't even think about it you just go on a bike balance and you're right you don't think twice because it comes subconscious it comes automatic and this to me is how really to become this is to me is how praying has to become and you have to be able to understand God wants you to cry out to say God yesterday yesterday's gone that's why even my preaching and teaching I don't dig up too much in history Lord did us two years ago or three years ago and fabulous how many dates and he did enough I just probably seen yesterday so the same God yesterday is today I need him today I see tomorrow coming and I will hit tomorrow I want them tomorrow too okay all right so let's hit the home stretch and wrap this whole thing up tonight what about him say this now that is what Christ wants to do with this church not give you any more gifts you have too many of them no this is a blow my own not give you any more gifts you have too many of them know what he wants to do is to give you himself and love the love of God the Abundant Life in your heart that makes you love everybody makes you love him to the kind of rest remember the Bible said that the Holy Ghost went forth to seal those for the kingdom the Holy Ghost was hidden to only those whose side cried for for the Abomination that was done in the city and anybody raising Hunter Knight and tell me of a Christian one in Greenville that lays on their face so good for the sins of Greenville that they cry outside before God day and night tell me where that person is I can show you the mark of the Holy Ghost so the Bible said lack only those foreign and why are these people are coming I want some of you that's that's on on praying wrongs with God I want some of you pastors go down here now I want the pastors and those Christian women that knows God come around this woman here you men who know God are interested in Souls you know what the Bible says in the last day so who is calling to pray last days the prophecies said that the people here we here we go in the last days the prophecy said that the people would be so cool and indifferent and when the Holy Ghost come true just to see those who sigh and cried for their permissioned ethnicity I want each of you of ministers to point out me in your congregation that person that science and Christ their light or the sins of the people in the city could you put a Hanuman up on this person remember the Holy Spirit to manage to seal those touch not the others but they're going to perish all right that's cool that is why the Rapture the bride the wise version the call out the affording the elected they're bright wise version called forwarding elected why you businessman wouldn't run your office like some people try to sing war on this program God knew before the foundation of the world who would be safe and who would not be safe by predestination by Foreign he saw every member in other words God saw the choices you would make I'm seeing his prayer about the power of decisions it's not that God forced you to make a tradition God bringing the drama in front of you for you to make a choice a Battleground is the mind and it because that is where decisions are made so because tonight you choose to come into this virtual room you cannot watch television you can go and watch some movie You're Gonna Go by some friend or some family you choose to come in tonight and thank God I certainly appreciate you did but in choose him no you have to choose in hearing what you're hearing whether or not you're gonna cry out whether or not you ever break past the human Instagram and say Lord I need you to intervene tonight hear what he said here now he says God knew before the foundation of the world who would be thief and who would not be saved by predestination by Foreign knowledge is for every member and put every name on the lamb book of life before the church ever began Jesus comes to seek and save that which was on that book he bought the book of redemption it was lost and the redeem us and all the names was on that book was redeemed when he redeemed us so therefore he comes with a shout right and that shout is all right and the Holy Ghost is what SEALs you and the bride elect will be crying against the foolish virgins in the church all right because they were rather than inside the masculinity right so the Bride is a bride the bride is going to make herself ready the bride is going to take the clothes of the wood and rock herself in the gong of the promised would isn't that right I said the Holy Spirit come now and what long treatment time when I'm Dreaming time when he gets woke up when I'm going to smoke up the copy weak should be weak you're clean you clean the lamp and so on like that and it shines bright again and and and because the weak now because fire using oil you have a carbon behind it so after a while still in the Lord You're testifying you're witnessing you're coming to church Karma builds up and your lights gets a little dry or hot or whatever it is it's part of life okay but you have a job till the week that's what these things is about all right all right so let's go find our code something I've read over and over I will read it again tonight they fall no better with our baby to get What It Wants of course with it when the baby is born you could set a bell down there say my little son I'm actually illusion and when you are hungry you need your mother ring the bell it will never work the only way that you could get what they want is to cry fit that is God's sweet let me switch to us this is the final knuckles that's the way that we get what we want is the cry for it coyote don't be ashamed to say I'm hungry for God don't care whether the beacons pastors whatever is a wrong scream what anyhow he said the Jones are certain there what difference does it make as you only read it is to get it until you get help he taught that when you see on earth a body unjust judge and I'm finished tonight so friends oh my God he didn't say to you those who are spoken with books let's be real he did not see he's seeing those who go to put over Church let's be real he didn't say steal those who in the message let's be real steal those who believe in William Branham no he did not say that she would also believe in Joseph he did not say that feel those who you know opened Us open book on the head or sleep with spoken book under the head no you didn't see that see those who sigh and cry and that is why all these scriptures is all absolute that is why we have to hold the word it will take us to where God wants us to be but Abraham didn't come and bring a new doctrine he came to reveal the very scriptures itself that's why we talk about the revealed with and Lord you know the choices we will make you know the choices that we will be here and you know by this permitting the change that would fall off the prison bars have been busted open and the people going free father I pray for them tonight that anyone in Chains when you break it off again any home any family break it off of them pardon me the anointing come to give them the strength to pray and the crowd unto you there is no other way you set it up this week you said when the people begin to pray then God's servants can come into action father he said
