[8:03] was adorned with goodly stones and Gifts
[8:05] he said for these as for these things
[8:07] which you behold the days will come in
[8:10] which there shall not be left one stone
[8:13] upon another that shall not be thrown
[8:16] down and they asked him saying Master
[8:18] but when shall these things be and what
[8:21] sign will there be when these things
[8:24] come to pass and he said take heed that
[8:27] you be not deceived for many shall come
[8:30] in my name saying I am Christ and the
[8:32] time draweth near go ye not therefore
[8:35] after them but when you hear hear of
[8:38] wars and rumors and commotions be not
[8:41] terrified but these things must come to
[8:45] pass must first come to pass but the end
[8:48] is not by and by then said he unto them
[8:52] Nations shall rise against Nation
[8:55] Kingdom against Kingdom and great
[8:58] earthquake shall be in diver places and
[9:00] famines and pestilences and fearful
[9:04] sights and Great Signs shall there be

[10:07] second in patience possess your soul and
[10:09] when you shall see Jerusalem compassed
[10:11] with armies then know that the
[10:14] Desolation thereof is nigh then let them
[10:17] which are in Judea flee to the mountains
[10:19] let them which are in the midst of it
[10:21] depart out and let not them that are in
[10:24] the countries enter there into for these
[10:27] be the days of vengeance
[10:29] that all things which are written may be
[10:32] fulfilled but wo unto them that are with
[10:35] child is them that give suck in those
[10:37] days for there shall be great distress
[10:39] in the land and wrath upon this people
[10:43] and they shall fall by the Ed of the
[10:45] sword and shall be led away captive unto
[10:47] all nations and Jerusalem shall be
[10:50] drunen down of the Gentiles until the
[10:52] times of the Gentiles be fulfilled and
[10:56] there shall be signs in the Sun and in
[10:57] the moon in the Stars upon the Earth
[11:00] distress of nation with perplexity the
[11:02] Sea and the waves roaring men Hearts
[11:05] feeling them for fear for looking after
[11:08] those things which are coming on the
[11:10] earth for the powers of Heaven shall be
[11:13] shaken and then shall they see the son
[11:16] of man coming in a cloud with power and
[11:19] great glory and when these things begin
[11:21] to come to pass then look up and lift up
[11:23] your heads for your Redemption draw it
[11:25] now let's bow our heads Heavenly Father
[11:27] we have read your word your word is ET
[11:29] your word is true and it is prophetic
[11:31] unto this hour that we are living in
[11:33] Father step by step word by word
[11:36] scripture by scripture line by line as
[11:39] what is to unfold in this end time
[11:42] father speak to us as your people and
[11:44] prepare us for your soon coming granted
[11:46] God in Jesus name I ask and bless your
[11:48] word tonight in Jesus name I pray amen
[11:51] you may be seated praise be to
[11:55] Jesus thank you Lord
[11:57] Jesus and the scripture want to
[11:59] highlight for these be the days of
[12:03] Vengeance that all things which are
[12:05] written may be fulfilled and have a
[12:08] title Mercy before the days of
[12:12] Vengeance that's a title Mercy before
[12:14] the days of Vengeance well the election
[12:16] is over and uh Donald Trump is now the
[12:20] 47 president of America we see that play
[12:23] out but what is striking to me is the
[12:26] time that God given us as among some
[12:29] ministers I telling them you know what
[12:31] is the sign for the bride on the inside
[12:33] we seen things unfolding the outside but
[12:36] what about our people and the message
[12:38] come to prepare people and if we are not
[12:40] ready my God God have to extend some
[12:43] time with some mercy to give us the
[12:44] grace to be made ready because
[12:47] understand once that that car without
[12:49] the steering wheel that is to come about
[12:51] next two or three years is now highlight
[12:53] what they're going to do but the thing
[12:55] about it the prophecies is going to come
[12:57] to pass every one of them will be
[12:59] fulfilled is how prepared we are so
[13:02] tonight Mercy before the days of
[13:04] Vengeance that how God describ it you
[13:05] know it come in the days of Vengeance
[13:08] now Daniel 2:21 says and he changeth the
[13:10] times and the seasons he removeth Kings
[13:14] and set it up Kings he giveth wisdom
[13:16] unto the wise and knowledge to them that
[13:18] know understanding so God know why at
[13:21] this point in time he brought back that
[13:23] man God knows what that is about because
[13:26] he does that he removed Kings
[13:29] and set it up Kings he does that because
[13:32] he is in the Affairs of men now there
[13:35] must be an inside sign for this bride
[13:37] Hallelujah and I'm going to show you
[13:38] that tonight oh praise be to Jesus see
[13:41] the angel of the Lord is on earth now
[13:45] see he's moving around fixing everything
[13:48] for the coming of the Lord now when you
[13:49] come to church you have to come out of
[13:51] your bubble you have to come out your
[13:52] backround your little small little world
[13:55] in your house and your home you have to
[13:56] come out of that to try to catch what
[13:58] God is saying here because remember
[14:01] there's not a book of behavior and be
[14:02] nice and be a Christian there's a book
[14:04] of Prophecy so you have to understand
[14:06] your day and its prophecy concerning
[14:08] what God say and God TS and that you
[14:10] will understand how you are to behave
[14:12] your life in your in your life the angel
[14:15] of the Lord is on earth
[14:17] now now he's moving around fixing
[14:22] everything for the coming of the Lord
[14:25] Revelation 71-5 said and after these
[14:27] things I saw four Angels standing the
[14:28] four corner of the Earth holding the
[14:30] Four Winds of the earth and the wind
[14:31] should not blow on the earth nor on the
[14:33] sea nor on any tree I saw another Angel
[14:36] ascending from the East having the seed
[14:37] of the Living God he carried a loud
[14:39] voice to the four angels to whom it was
[14:41] given to hurt the earth and the Sea so
[14:44] these angels had a commission to hurt
[14:46] the Earth hurt the sea hurt and a angel
[14:50] from the East said hold
[14:53] it hurt not the Earth neither the sea
[14:57] nor the trees till we have sealed the
[15:00] Servants of God in their
[15:02] foreheads that's the slot of Mercy when
[15:05] the angels of Destruction have been
[15:07] commission that is the grace that's is
[15:09] the opportunity that God give us that we
[15:11] could praise come into line with that
[15:12] isn't that something praise God and I
[15:14] heard the number of them that were
[15:15] sealed and they were seal 144,000 of the
[15:18] tribe of children of Israel we know that
[15:20] the Jews but before they are sealed
[15:21] there's a bride to be sealed Before
[15:23] Destruction there's a bride to be seal
[15:25] do you believe that oh praise God and we
[15:28] know what happened in 1970 on November
[15:31] 1917 November the 11th at 11:00 in the
[15:33] morning 11th Hour 11 minutes the war
[15:36] just stopped
[15:38] suddenly nobody know how they wall stop
[15:40] it just sto because God stopped it to
[15:43] hold back destruction to call out a
[15:45] gentile bride some of us was even born
[15:48] yet but God had to call out you a
[15:50] gentile bride not for Destruction but
[15:52] for election and the Rapture oh give the
[15:54] Lord some Praises isn't that something
[15:58] so God stopped the and release a prophet
[16:00] with a message to go get that bride so
[16:03] you have been found by God tonight I
[16:05] don't care what you feel what you think
[16:07] you have been found by God God send this
[16:10] message to find you maybe you're not
[16:12] feeling well tonight you're not feeling
[16:14] on top the mountain tonight but this
[16:16] message was sent to find you because God
[16:18] sent Malachi 4 to take out a people for
[16:21] his name's sake oh give the Lord some
[16:23] Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah
[16:26] glory to God we won't be long with you
[16:28] but we are something Upon Our Hearts
[16:30] tonight praise God Ezekiel chapter 9
[16:32] familiar scripture he cried also in my
[16:34] ear with the Lord voice saying cause
[16:35] them to have charge over the city to
[16:37] draw near every man with a destroying
[16:39] weapon in his hand and behold six men
[16:41] came to the way of the higher gate which
[16:43] L towards the North and every man a
[16:45] Slaughter weapon in his hand and one man
[16:47] among them was throw with linen with a
[16:49] righteous incor by his side and they
[16:51] went in and Stood Beside the Brazen
[16:53] altar now this is after God was showing
[16:55] them successive Abominations of Israel
[16:58] look look in this room you see what
[16:59] they're doing look in this room you see
[17:01] what they're doing look in this room and
[17:02] God had enough of that and that's what
[17:04] I'm saying don't misinterpret God's
[17:08] mercy don't misinterpret God
[17:10] longsuffering because you in your
[17:11] foolishness and God told it for so long
[17:13] he told it forever don't think that
[17:16] sometime he comes to end of stuff and
[17:18] say I had enough the iniquity is full
[17:21] the cup is full I have to react now I
[17:23] have to act upon that the day of
[17:25] vengeance is at hand oh praise God and
[17:28] this man
[17:29] watch and the glory of God was going up
[17:32] from the CH where upon he was to the
[17:34] treas of the floor and he called to the
[17:36] man clothed with linen which had the
[17:38] righteous incor by their side and the
[17:40] Lord said unto him go to the midst of
[17:42] the city to the midst of Jerusalem and
[17:44] set a mark upon the foreheads of men
[17:46] that sigh and cry so the bride have to
[17:48] come into that position you have to come
[17:50] in that position this can't just be a
[17:52] scripture you have to be burdened enough
[17:54] just like Daniel when he saw there was
[17:56] two more years left he got a burden to
[17:58] fast and pray he got a burden to press
[18:00] on like never before and I am seeing
[18:02] what open here is a window to press on
[18:05] to the bride Revival a window to press
[18:07] on to receive the Holy Ghost a window to
[18:09] press on that your life can be cleaned
[18:11] up and you can be a people prepared and

[21:42] not near any man in whom is the mark and
[21:46] where to start begin at My
[21:49] Sanctuary because judgment begins in the
[21:53] house of God before judgment hit this
[21:55] one and that one and that one out there
[21:56] and all them Nation judgment had to
[21:57] start where
[21:59] in the house of God that's why they have
[22:00] to have a sign in the house of God as
[22:03] what God going to do outside we not
[22:04] looking outside for the signs we have to
[22:06] look for the sign inside oh give the
[22:08] Lord a shout before anything is done
[22:10] outside the proclamation the the
[22:12] anointing the the the the the the the
[22:14] fire have to come from
[22:17] inside before Jesus Took up his ministry
[22:20] what he did after he overcome the devil
[22:22] he took up the book in the temple and
[22:24] said what the spirit is upon me for he
[22:26] had anointed me Jesus had to take the
[22:27] book book going and find the scripture
[22:29] read the scripture proclaim the mission
[22:31] Proclaim what the anointed is there for
[22:33] he said to declare the acceptable year
[22:35] of the Lord and he left out the rest the
[22:37] rest was to declare the day of Vengeance
[22:39] of our God and I am telling you that God
[22:42] is extending Mercy before the day of
[22:44] Vengeance because there be a bride and H
[22:46] going to declare their Vengeance no man

[27:28] Luke
[27:30] 21:20 and when ye shall see
[27:32] Jerusalem compass with armies then know
[27:37] the Desolation thereof is n then let
[27:41] them which are in Judea flee to the
[27:42] mountains let them which are in the
[27:44] midst of it depart out let them not that
[27:47] are in the countries enter there into
[27:49] for these be the days of Vengeance that
[27:52] all things must be written and be
[27:53] fulfilled
[28:03] Saints regen Believers it cannot be
[28:05] business as
[28:08] usual
[28:11] please Jesus said wasn't days a
[28:14] Noah so shall it be you know what Jesus
[28:18] described they eat they drank they build
[28:22] they got married but the day Noah
[28:24] entered into the AR the flood came and
[28:27] destroyed them all
[28:29] he was describing normal living nothing
[28:32] out of the ordinary you know you go to
[28:34] work you go in your grocery you put gas
[28:37] in your car you drive here you go on
[28:39] Fellowship you read a book you play with
[28:41] WhatsApp you do a little YouTube or or
[28:43] Tik Tok or whatever it is you you watch
[28:45] this and you L normal
[28:48] living but you could do that and you're
[28:51] not in the spirit of God you could do
[28:53] that in the flesh natural missing what
[28:56] you're supposed to be seeing what is
[29:09] happening so the
[29:11] Jews the Christians that believe Jesus
[29:15] words when they saw Jerusalem surrounded
[29:18] by armies and that was led by Titus
[29:21] surround Jerusalem it was a powerful
[29:24] Siege there was in famine it was real
[29:27] pressure but the Christians believe what
[29:30] Jesus said when you see
[29:33] Jerusalem surround with armies flee to
[29:36] the
[29:38] mountains how you fleeing when the Army
[29:42] Sur but you're watching you're watching
[29:45] what the word say yes you're watching
[29:47] what happened outside but guess what
[29:49] happened the Army pulled
[29:52] back the Army pulled back because Titus
[29:56] his father was the Vespasian
[29:58] was called back and when he pulled back
[30:01] the true
[30:02] believers they bust it and run out
[30:06] Hallelujah they took it as the sign of
[30:08] God's mercy because judgment was coming
[30:11] not because Titus disappear tit coming
[30:14] back oh give the Lord a shout Give the
[30:17] Lord a shout in the house hallelujah
[30:20] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[30:24] praise God Amen brother stepen I some
[30:26] brothers say if that woman get through
[30:28] there this might be the last election in
[30:30] America could you imagine sigh of
[30:35] relief is like a space of Grace to get
[30:39] yourself in order because what coming
[30:42] out will be worse it coming you know
[30:45] just delayed but it coming we don't know
[30:48] how but it will come isn't that right so
[30:52] Titus was called back and when Titus
[30:54] praise God was pulled back praise God
[30:56] the true Christians they got out amen so
[31:00] I was doing some research in it Titus
[31:02] briefly withdrew from The Siege of
[31:03] Jerusalem historical account suggest
[31:05] that Titus with Jo created an
[31:06] opportunity for the people in the city
[31:08] to flee if they recognize the moment
[31:11] praise God so this was connected to
[31:14] Jesus prophecy where he urges followers
[31:16] to flee when they saw the signs of
[31:18] impendent disaster oh praise the name of
[31:21] the Lord praise praise God so the early
[31:24] Christians and Jews who recognize the
[31:25] signs Jesus had prophesied seized the
[31:27] moment to leave the city I hope you
[31:30] could seize the moment to leave
[31:31] churchianity and leave the fleshly world
[31:34] and leave Hollywood and the movies and
[31:35] leave all everything else to get it
[31:38] together because the time is short oh
[31:40] blessed be the name of the Lord things
[31:42] will happen suddenly you
[31:44] know not long and drawn out you know
[31:46] overnight you know things will begin to
[31:48] happen you know so I telling the
[31:50] brothers I I no California bringing so
[31:52] much income and money and I guess all
[31:54] the tech CH down there when Los Angeles
[31:56] sink that could be a real a huge thing
[32:00] for
[32:01] America worse than
[32:03] 911 because California going under
[32:05] ground and the bride will still be here
[32:08] oh praise the name of the Lord Bible
[32:11] call it the beginning of Sorrows oh
[32:14] praise God hallelujah so glory to God so
[32:18] those who
[32:20] stayed because Rome eventually breached
[32:23] Jerusalem defenses destroy the temple
[32:25] and the the massard enslaving the
[32:27] surviving
[32:29] inhabitants and those who escaped was
[32:31] those who was connected to the prophecy
[32:34] of
[32:35] Jesus okay let's continue here now but
[32:37] brandham somebody talk about his dream I
[32:40] thought i' bring it back he said Mr
[32:42] brandham I realized I got to stand
[32:43] before God he said I don't know whether
[32:45] I was asleep or what happened my dream
[32:47] I'm going to say I was dream asleep and
[32:49] dream I taught my son in the market and
[32:52] then he says and he said a voice shook
[32:54] the little Earth and the Earth shook
[32:56] from under my feet and said after it
[32:58] quit shaking I Heard a
[33:01] Voice and brother brandom it was your
[33:03] voice and said I know there was
[33:05] something said it said I'll ride this
[33:08] Trail once more and I started looking up
[33:10] the rock like this and look on past the
[33:12] clouds and way up there on a rock from
[33:14] the East to the West it pointed to shape
[33:16] like a pyramid it run back to the East
[33:19] and there you were standing there on a
[33:21] horse like I've never seen anything in
[33:23] my life Great White Horse white man
[33:26] hanging down and the were dressed like
[33:28] an Indian chief with all the things the
[33:30] Indian use said he had breastplate and
[33:32] bangles on the arms all know like that
[33:34] you had your hand up like that that
[33:36] horse standing in a like a military
[33:39] horse with a PR like that walking and me
[33:41] standing still you pull out the rains
[33:43] went riding out towards the west and I
[33:46] looked down there and there was a whole
[33:48] lot of scientists and the next morning I
[33:50] preach on scientists you know being of
[33:52] the devil and scientists were pouring
[33:54] things in tubes and mixing it and said
[33:56] you stop the hole raise up your hands
[33:59] and scream I'll ride this Trail once
[34:01] more and said the whole earth Shook and
[34:04] them people shook looked at one another
[34:06] like that and look up to you so this was
[34:08] the dream where B talking about I ride
[34:10] this Trail once more now on the fourth
[34:14] seal when he was praying he said this
[34:17] Lord how thankful we are I'm so glad
[34:20] Lord so happy for you and your people
[34:22] you purchased our Salvation on Calvary
[34:25] we gladly accept it Lord now try us Lord
[34:27] by your spirit and if there be any evil
[34:30] Among Us Lord any unbelief of the word
[34:34] any person here father that would not
[34:36] punctuate every promise of God with an
[34:38] amen May the Holy Spirit come down now
[34:42] the white horse rider while his Spirit
[34:47] the spirit of Christ in the face of the
[34:49] Antichrist call his own and call them
[34:51] out so he came around identifying the
[34:54] holy spirit is the white horse rider so
[34:57] what he said I will write this Trail
[34:58] once more it wasn't brother brandham it
[35:00] was the Holy Spirit speaking I will
[35:03] write this Trail once more that's why we
[35:05] keep saying there'll be one more ride so
[35:07] when we say one more ride we mean a
[35:09] riding of the power and the person of
[35:11] the holy spirit of God the Dynamics to
[35:13] the mechanics it is guaranteed it is
[35:16] promised it can't fail God can't lie oh

[35:33] and who saying that what you're going to
[35:34] see something happen when something is
[35:36] going to take place and all this
[35:38] background here has only been a
[35:40] foundation for a short quick message
[35:42] that will shake the whole nation the
[35:45] message itself going to shake the whole
[35:46] nation that has to be a message of
[35:48] mechanics and Dynamics because we have
[35:49] books and tapes all these years and they
[35:51] Shake nothing so when you talk about the
[35:53] message going to shake the whole nation
[35:54] it has to be more than books and tapes
[35:58] the hour is coming when this world I
[36:02] want you to say Amen to these
[36:03] things when this world will shake under
[36:07] the impact of the Church of the Living
[36:09] God that is moving forward in great

[40:15] tightening B say will be a tightening
[40:17] that
[40:18] wait hold your tightening
[40:21] there come that VRI to lock you up they
[40:24] can't do nothing out weight could you
[40:25] imagine that we have the Assurance out a
[40:27] weight
[40:29] but
[40:31] Bram there's a vast difference between a
[40:33] Christian and a holy ghost fil
[40:38] Christian that's the problem the message
[40:41] everybody say they believe they believe
[40:42] what devil believe and he trembling
[40:45] people believe in normal normal and
[40:47] devil trembling when he believe there's
[40:50] a vast difference between a Christian
[40:51] and a holy ghost filled Christian he
[40:54] said we are going to get this from the
[40:55] scripture and place it exactly in the
[40:56] scripture the first place is a Christian
[40:58] profess to be a Christian but if this
[41:00] Christian has not yet been filled with
[41:02] the Holy Ghost he's only in the process
[41:04] of being a Christian he is professed to
[41:06] believe it he's working to it but God
[41:08] has not yet given him his the spirit of
[41:10] the Holy Ghost he has not yet reached
[41:12] that goal with God that God recognized
[41:15] because when God made a covenant with
[41:16] Abraham he called Abraham which is the
[41:18] type of calling the believer today he
[41:19] called Abraham and Abraham moved out of
[41:21] his country went into a Strange Land to
[41:23] dwell among a strange people and that
[41:25] was a type of when God calls a man to
[41:26] stop his meanness repent of his sins he
[41:29] turns them from the crowd he was in to
[41:31] live in a new crowd among a new type of
[41:33] people and then after God found Abraham
[41:35] to be faithful to the promise that God
[41:38] gave him that he would have a child and
[41:39] to this child all the Earth would be
[41:41] blessed then God confirmed his feet by
[41:44] giving him a sign and that sign was
[41:46] circumcision and circumcision is a type
[41:48] of the Holy Spirit isn't that right
[41:51] praise the name of the Lord so but BR
[41:53] say what is the SE however the mark that
[41:55] was put on their head was not tattooed
[41:56] what was it the baptism of the holy
[41:58] spirit that was the mark that was going
[42:01] to be for the last dayj so the mark for
[42:03] the last day is not the books and vials
[42:05] and plagues and Wes how much how much
[42:06] you know the Mark is still this the
[42:09] baptism of the Holy Spirit regards of
[42:12] what Mysteries them fell preach it the
[42:13] word without sensation and all what they
[42:15] say the Mark is still the baptism of the
[42:18] Holy Spirit Oh Glory to God what is the
[42:21] mark that is going to be for the last
[42:23] day question the answer the Bible said
[42:26] the Seal of God was the baptism of the
[42:28] Holy Ghost for the people in the last
[42:30] day no man could give you that seal God
[42:32] give you that seal God promis you the
[42:34] Holy Ghost God promised you to Ace don't
[42:36] let no man take that away from you and
[42:38] talk that out to you you should be
[42:40] hungering and thirsting after
[42:41] righteousness just to be hungering is to
[42:42] be blessed he said blessed are they that
[42:44] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[42:46] what going to happen to them they shall
[42:47] be filled oh give the Lord a shout your
[42:49] hungering and thirsting is a blessing a
[42:52] blessing to be thirsting for God a
[42:54] blessing to be hungering for God oh give
[42:56] the Lord some a shout in the house
[42:58] Hallelujah the Bible said the seed of
[43:01] God was the baptism of Holy Ghost and
[43:03] for the people in the last days
[43:04] Ephesians 4:30 said grief not the Holy
[43:06] Spirit whereby you are sealed until the
[43:08] day of your Redemption the Bible speaks
[43:10] about amen what is a seal a seal cannot
[43:13] be put on anything until it's
[43:15] complete then he Dro this bomb but punch
[43:18] the Lutheran wasn't sealed the day of
[43:20] dispensation of Grace wasn't completed
[43:22] the preach justification Methodist
[43:24] wasn't sealed but the baptism of the
[43:26] Holy Ghost is the the completion of the
[43:28] works of God hallelujah so the baptism
[43:31] of of of the Holy Ghost produced the
[43:32] rest press to enter into the rest oh
[43:36] give the Lord some Praises however the
[43:38] mark okay I repeat there I don't know
[43:41] how I have that twice now notice this
[43:43] Holy Ghost is a sign I mean the Holy
[43:45] Ghost is a seal it's a sign that God
[43:46] given to his chosen children to reject
[43:48] it is to be cut off from the people to
[43:50] receive it is to be finished with the
[43:52] world here we go finished with the world
[43:55] and all the things of the world and to
[43:56] be a product that God has put a seal of
[43:59] approval on used to work at the railroad
[44:01] out there and we used to go down and
[44:03] load a car my brother duck standing
[44:05] there and when a car is been loaded they
[44:07] go to the car the inspector and if he
[44:09] find anything loose they would fall and
[44:11] break and would destroy he will not seal
[44:13] that car watch anything you find
[44:15] anything loose until that car is
[44:17] completely packed and so packed down and
[44:19] so in order that the shaking of the ride
[44:22] won't bother the product on the inside
[44:24] what is he saying when you get all them
[44:26] things packed into you because we have a
[44:28] shaking right to go through Oh Glory to
[44:30] God and if if it get too shook up and it
[44:32] not packed right you might get shake out

[54:03] caused problems and what did God tell
[54:06] Abraham God a say nothing to abrah God
[54:08] wasn't even telling Abraham nothing
[54:10] until he watched Abraham decision and
[54:12] action Abraham made a choice to call his
[54:15] cousin and say listen not so let's
[54:18] straighten this out we are Brethren you
[54:20] are blessed I am blessed we are all
[54:22] blessed make your move you move East
[54:24] West North you choose why he could have
[54:27] say you choose we would say Wonder this
[54:30] PC is you watching good land and whatnot
[54:32] Abraham he knew who he
[54:34] was he wasn't defined by others he
[54:37] wasn't allowing others to Define who he
[54:39] was he knew he was a Son of God he knew
[54:42] the calling of God was upon his life he
[54:43] know the devil can't take what God put
[54:45] upon him you know the devil can't curse
[54:47] what God have blessed he know he was
[54:49] blessed because God told him so
[54:52] Hallelujah he knew
[54:55] that let look with his eyes and look and
[54:57] look and look and he pitches it towards
[54:58] Sodom without even having no thinking
[55:01] how it will destroy his family L was a
[55:04] selfish man he was just thinking about
[55:06] his own interests not even thinking of
[55:10] what the family could handle but he
[55:13] choose that way at the ending how much
[55:16] people he lost because he made a
[55:18] decision he had something in his heart
[55:21] he had an anchor he had a strong tower
[55:23] but not his
[55:24] family he could have made a different
[55:26] decision but he chose that let's
[55:28] continue while they went to buy the
[55:30] bridegroom came and they were ready went
[55:32] in with him to the marriage and the door
[55:35] was shut afterwards came the other
[55:37] virgins Lord open to us he said I know
[55:39] you not watch therefore for you know
[55:43] neither the day nor the hour when the
[55:45] son of man come but five of them all
[55:49] virgins five wise with oil he said now
[55:52] you can have the father without having
[55:53] the son you can't have the father
[55:54] without having the son you can't have
[55:56] the Holy Ghost without having father and
[55:57] Holy Ghost but you can be justified
[55:59] without being Sanctified you can be
[56:00] Sanctified without having the Holy Ghost
[56:02] and be clean live a Pure Life and so
[56:04] like that here the part I want to get to
[56:06] there is a wise virgin who had all in
[56:08] their lamps Rapture in
[56:10] faith that's a bum that's a bum the Holy
[56:14] Ghost is rting Faith so if we don't have
[56:16] the Holy Ghost what we going with to
[56:19] leave here we need what rapturing
[56:22] faith there is a wise virgins those who
[56:25] had all in their Lambs Rapture in fate
[56:28] give me all in my lamp keep burning
[56:31] Rapture in FA believe in all signs and
[56:33] wonders prophecies everything else these
[56:34] five cutout of the remnant was taken
[56:36] away and the rest of them are still
[56:38] virgins will not be lost but will go
[56:40] through the tribulation period so all in
[56:42] your lamp is Rapture in fate Hallelujah
[56:47] almost
[56:48] done Isaiah
[56:50] 61 it reads the spirit of God is upon me
[56:52] that what Jesus read Because see the
[56:54] Lord had anointed me to preach good
[56:55] tidings into the
[56:57] meek and this is where it brings Clarity
[57:01] that the fivefold ministry will be the
[57:05] ministry of Jesus Christ I've been
[57:07] saying this for years people challenge
[57:08] it people disagree with it I have
[57:10] nothing to do with that I don't care if
[57:12] every minister in the world disagree
[57:13] with that but I am contending that the
[57:17] this fful ministry will be the ministry
[57:21] of Jesus Christ in the form of Pastor
[57:23] Prophet evangelist and so on like that
[57:28] and I'll show you
[57:30] why spirit of God is upon me because he
[57:33] anointed me to preach good TI to the
[57:34] meek he assem me to bind up the
[57:36] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[57:37] captives opening of the prison to them
[57:39] that are bound to proclaim the accept of
[57:42] the Lord that's where Jesus
[57:44] stopped and said this day the scripture
[57:46] fulfilled but the other parts reads and
[57:49] the day of Vengeance of our
[57:53] God and then
[57:58] he said this in identify Masterpiece of
[58:00] God he's cutting you down now he's
[58:02] cutting you down to the word only
[58:05] cutting all the Creeds and dogmas and
[58:06] everything away from you trying to get
[58:08] back to the bride first the son another
[58:12] Masterpiece part of the
[58:14] word Jesus couldn't take the place you
[58:19] remember when he read the day in the
[58:21] book he read just part of the
[58:24] prophecy he left
[58:26] the rest of it for the last
[58:30] days we are supposed to take that
[58:33] part which man could declare Vengeance
[58:37] no man so it will be
[58:40] Christ veiling a bride
[58:44] declaring the day of Vengeance of our
[58:47] god do you see it Jesus couldn't take
[58:51] that place you remember when he read
[58:54] that day in the book he read just
[58:56] started the prophecy and left the rest
[58:58] of it for the last days musician pleas
[59:01] so you see he has cut and he wants to
[59:05] cut the church out just like he did the
[59:08] Sun out and this is where you get the
[59:12] free
[59:13] thinkers
[59:14] now the prophet always talk about the
[59:17] cloth that a woman puts into cut a
[59:19] dress it's the same clot but there a
[59:22] pattern that is placed on the clot and
[59:25] is cut out
[59:26] now the freethinkers want to do their
[59:28] own thing act their own way and whatnot
[59:30] and like free thinking but they're still
[59:32] part of that clot you have to be willing
[59:36] to be
[59:37] cut or I'll use another word
[59:41] honed or
[59:43] shaped this is what bride material is
[59:48] like the rest of the church members they
[59:50] come to church and they go back
[59:52] home but bride material could handle the
[59:56] cutting the Shaving because you have to
[59:59] cut in order to be fit and he said that
[1:00:03] is end time evangelism shaping Stones
[1:00:07] not Gathering Stones together and just
[1:00:09] pour water on the stones but cutting the
[1:00:12] stones that the stone could be fitted
[1:00:14] into God's
[1:00:16] program when you know you are fitted in
[1:00:18] God's program how the Raptor leaving
[1:00:20] your back you a calling leave anybody
[1:00:23] there you you are part of the whole body
[1:00:28] so
[1:00:31] watch he has cut he wants to cut the
[1:00:34] church out just like he did the son out
[1:00:37] like he did the bride and the groom to
[1:00:38] be his bride you must be part of him not
[1:00:41] part of a Creed not part of a church not
[1:00:44] part of denomination but part of him he
[1:00:47] out of any other kind of form won't work
[1:00:51] you got to be hewed from the word so a
[1:00:54] pastor could heue out a church chch
[1:00:56] based upon his image and likeness and
[1:00:57] his vision he's not talking about that
[1:01:00] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's always
[1:01:02] do it here don't by we that talk is good
[1:01:06] the word says so but we we no no you
[1:01:10] want to be
[1:01:11] cut by the word so that eliminates oh
[1:01:14] she do do that and she does do that so
[1:01:15] you want to do it too because that
[1:01:17] person is so much in the church no
[1:01:19] you're not following them you following
[1:01:20] what does the word
[1:01:22] say so when you see it like that you are
[1:01:25] being cut by the word and this is where
[1:01:28] I'm going to
[1:01:30] close all right brother BR he's praying
[1:01:33] father God from the little children I
[1:01:35] got two girls two boys in this room
[1:01:36] today Lord youngsters Lord send the
[1:01:39] power upon them look at this prayer

[1:01:55] have to cross to Jordan alone but oh God
[1:01:58] when they come down to that nearing that
[1:02:00] Shore when the breath is about to leave
[1:02:03] the lightning Flash the wrath of Jehovah
[1:02:05] upon a sinful body that's been born in
[1:02:06] sin how the breakers will Dash the
[1:02:09] lightning Roar and the great Breakers
[1:02:10] and dangerous shows oh God may they
[1:02:13] anchor just now in
[1:02:15] Jesus when that time comes knowing
[1:02:17] there's an anchor that holds that will
[1:02:19] guide them across every dangerous sholl
[1:02:22] the lightning or nothing can sink them
[1:02:24] they're safe for Jesus granted
[1:02:28] Lord have mercy upon
[1:02:30] us forgive us of our sins to play
[1:02:33] something Grant it Lord fill us with
[1:02:36] your Holy Spirit may we not be satisfied
[1:02:39] Lord with joining church and trying to
[1:02:43] be a Christian listen to these words
[1:02:45] being some self-effort somewhere we try
[1:02:48] to manufacture something now I'm joining
[1:02:50] a church and the people going to expect
[1:02:52] me to be a Christian now I'm not and I'm
[1:02:55] not have to do this and not have to do
[1:02:57] that no more become a Christian oh God

[1:03:14] Pharisees God fill us with
[1:03:16] deity fill us with power and energy
[1:03:20] until our souls are flame that our
[1:03:23] strength will be in him our testimony
[1:03:25] will be in God our words will be his
[1:03:28] Devils will tremble and the world will
[1:03:30] shake and rock under the impact of it
[1:03:33] Lord if you can only find a people who
[1:03:36] are willing to wait upon the Lord and
[1:03:38] then he begin to sing later wait upon
[1:03:39] the Lord then he said may we consecrate
[1:03:42] our frail boats this morning this little
[1:03:44] Tabernacle of shameful flesh that we
[1:03:46] think so much of to work so many days to
[1:03:49] keep it comfortable place we live in
[1:03:51] fine homes nice cars oh God and when we
[1:03:53] get our eyes on that and off the Ransom

[1:03:59] things to know that we leave them here
[1:04:01] on Earth let us seek the Heavenly
[1:04:02] Treasures the Holy Spirit the true
