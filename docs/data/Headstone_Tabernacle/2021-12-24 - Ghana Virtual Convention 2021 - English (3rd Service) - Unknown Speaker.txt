god bless you amen and amen in jesus name amen good morning to everyone greetings to pastor solomon joseph nachina hope i got it right and to the saints at life tamanna tamale ghana as you celebrate with the bride of christ around the world in a virtual setting i am honored to bring you greeting at such a time like this when the world has been brought to a false halt with adjustments being made that are deeply affecting one and all including the little bride of christ before i continue let me read a scripture exodus 12 12 for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and i will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment for i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the house where you are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt notes carefully that he says he was going to smite the land but this mightin was with a plague as we have displayed going on now now we must remember and i'm sending this message especially to those of us who have been in the message for some time and are yet to identify with the token let me just send this little friendly warning to you we must remember that no matter what we do or how successful we are in life without christ without christ we are totally lost everything why if he is that if he is all that there is to look forward to then it will be most foolish not to accept it like the foolish virgins and cherish it not only to accept it but you you come to something greater than that after you've got it don't take it on late on the shelf it has to be put into use now obviously we are talking about the blood of the lamb is a token for you and when i see the blood i will pass over you it's the same as being ready as the wise virgin who had oil in the lamb christianity is about displaying the token publicly in public life at the office on the street when trouble is around anything at the church for the blood is the token and the token must be applied if it's ever going to be done it has to be done now because we can see that the rat is not a boat but the rat is already on display throughout the land throughout the world everything that is not under the token will perish and the blood identifies us remember the rat is on the ready over the world you know in the early days and the message we would have said well you have to kill the lamb and then put it on the doorpost well it seems to me the time is not killing the lamb but the time is to display the token there's a time for killing and there's a time for this plane once the deaths start to pass through there's a time for this plane seems to me it's not a time for killing now we are living in the shadows and the rat is striking and god has required a token that you yourself have received this token which is the holy ghost is the only way and the only sign that god will ever pass why it is the literal life of jesus christ returned back upon the believer it is the literal life of jesus christ else how else are we going to in his name cast those devils and see signs and wonders it's not going to be done unless the token is on on display the holy ghost is our identification it's what identifies us as christians not our membership in churches not our standing of the bible and mysteries or how much you know about the bible it's about how much you know about the altar how much the author is living in us it's your old self gone dead you are no more you wrecking yourself dead not just a reckon you are dead if you touch a dead man he doesn't move but my god these days you don't have to touch you just have to look and you get this tears back and you get the words back and you know they're not dead angers are bringing have brought us into places that we have never been before offense has become the normal sea he that is born of god does not commit sin for he cannot sin for the seed of god remains in him how can he sin when the sinless god is in him when he's a sinner's god how can he sin no matter what he's done the blood has covered him so does a man or woman who is full of the holy ghost he is sealed away secured from harm and danger his whole life displays what he is wherever he walks whatever business he does whoever he talks to when he comes in contact with woman when he comes in contact with the associates when he comes in contact with everything the token is lying there praise god let the token be seen not all not our personality not to curse the risks not our anger not to see how long we could stay vexed without that quote took that covenant the rat of god is upon us it's caught up with you your sins will find you out what is sin unbelief you have disbelieved the message you have disbelieved the word you have disbelieved the witness of the token itself when it's identified itself in the midst of us all these years my brother they always here when the token itself is identifying himself right among us proving he's the same yesterday today and forever because if you say you believe and you don't follow the instructions of the word then you do not believe it's as simple as that this you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand this message you know you just have to be obedient and have your hearts change and your ears in tune i always pray really circumcise my heart and circumcise my ass so i can hear what god is saying because if we're using the ears and the heart of the old nature you're dead into the things of god though you be circumcised do you join until you are baptized you've done all these things that's still in the token so when you're circumcised then you are putting yourself in a place for the token to be on display you're putting yourself in a place for god to begin walking on us because it's a process justification sanctification but we've got to finish the baptism of the holy ghost now you cannot imagine it but you got to stay there until you know the token is implied until your whole mind the mind that was in christ is in you and when that is done then you know your life is done you are dead your life is dead you are hidden christ you are hidden god and sealed in there by the holy ghost then when the cry comes behold the bridegroom comment go yell to meet him you will be one of them for wise virgin and not the foolish may god bless you i greet you in jesus name amen dear brothers and sisters it is again my pleasure to have been invited for a short greeting my brother solomon it is precious to have fellowship in the revealed world of this hour and to dig together and enjoy the glorious blessings of our savior the topic for this conference is a very serious one and it brings us to the point of questioning ourselves and finding out if we are walking in a straight line in the right direction we have understood that there are two groups two kinds of virgins the wise virgins and the foolish virgins and that ultimately only one group emerged as overcomers so the bible calls us to be wise this cannot be our human limited wisdom it can only be the wisdom of god which we can ask from him if you look very closely we see that both the wise virgins and the foolish virgins had a lamp both lamps shown in the beginning both went through the process of justification sanctification and baptism of the holy spirit so that their lamb was lit they were both virgins pure and holy but at the end of time we are promised that there will be a difference between wise and foolish but we also have the promise that the holy spirit will guide us into all truth this holy spirit guides us to the one who is the truth our head jesus christ this great person this little addition wise to oil in their vessels is the crucial difference there is a great multitude of believers who testify that they are born again and had received the holy spirit and that they have experienced signs and wonders in their lives they are also not married to a system they are virgins and this group of believers are sure that they are christians sons and daughters of god therefore at the end of time they will say lord lord did we not do all these things in your name and these great things such as healing the sick deliverance raising the dead and so on comes from god but they elect oil in their vessels we see from this very clearly that today it is no longer a matter of the foundation of justification sanctification and baptism of the holy spirit alone which every christian if he calls himself by his name must have experienced what we need now in addition is to experience what jean experienced on the isle of patmos take the little book and eat it up that which makes our light shine today is a revelation of who he is who i am as a son or daughter who my brother sister is next to me and a revelation of the promises for this day and hour so that we can come forth as overcomers in the rapture but we also see very clearly that even those who love and heard the message of this hour need grace that the fire of love and joy does not go out yes there is something more that we need in our vessels as it is written in the third seal here he comes in as the antichrist as a false prophet than the beast then in dark age then the church ages out of the dark age justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost incarnate word the way now and he goes down he goes down the church goes up it's just as perfect as it can be oh it's beautiful i just love it two things have become very important to me in this regard the first thing that we certainly all need to clean our lamps is now it's my time for consecration to god god's time to speak to me see i must just have a little change in my own life not as i think that i am wicked but i want to feel a little more closer to people see let us take a closer look at this saying of the prophet he said in the message humble thyself as i brought this statement this morning the people was laying in the shadow of peter they never even asked for prayer we know this is the climax in the third pool i've went into many homes watching this pray before i go just go in there with the anointing and don't even pray for the people walk out and they are healed see see that's right i've seen it done so many times see you have got to have somewhere to place your faith see you have got to believe it and i believe that the hour is approaching and now is is on the way and something is already given and we know he is the same yesterday today and forever and when i can really see and grasp what is given to us then we can place our faith in it and we know there is nothing outside the world our rock of salvation that we can lay our faith in it and i realized that this is not a tape service they might make a little one for themselves but this is not a tape that goes out across the blessed be the name of the lord today these words are in our hands this what i was speaking of this morning has brought us right up to a climax and that's the reason that i'm going to take next sunday for a healing service because since i've been home i've told you about the visions and what's happened and everything and brought it right up why i've done all these things and then this morning bringing it right up now to that last pull and while we live in the time of that last pull because the seals are broken and the word is revealed to us we need something more so that the glory of the lord can shine through us in this end time we need something more as what the foolish virgin said now it's my time for consecration to god god's time to speak to me see i must just have a little change in my own life not as i think that i am wicked but i want to feel a little more closer to people see that is what the wise virgin have a vessel filled with oil this oil that only the wise virgin can receive as it is written heard not the oil and the wine in revelation 6 4 6. brothers and sisters why is this deep longing in us to walk closer with him there is a marvelous promise given to us and this is the second fact i like to express to you and i want to close with this deep quote it is written in modern events may clear by prophecy notice now they had done to him just exactly what the prophet said they would do just as they are doing to this very same day in the laodicean age if you want to look at it read revelation 3 blind naked and don't know it turning christ when he begins to reveal himself into the seed form again the same one that went into the ground come back to be the bride just the bride and the groom is the same flesh and blood the same ministry the same things doing just exactly what he done the spirit and here they are impersonating and doing everything else and each one has got his book and running and this and oh you never heard such sensations and i smell a devil and all this that just as unscriptural as it can be and the gene thing laying right there before them they walk away they don't belong to my organization i see just blind leading the blind won't they all fall in the ditch blinded by men's denominational traditions they put him out of that church as god said they would do in revelation 3 as usual as prophesied notice how jesus made himself known to these disciples now and and we'll close these two disciples cafes cleopas rather and his friend now we are in the resurrection the morning after the resurrection the first resurrection what a beautiful morning jesus is up from the dead and living among his people what a beautiful thought he is here the same today as he was on that day because he's the same yesterday today and forever and revealing himself more today than he has in any other age since that day come through the weed and stalk and shuck is all past now we are into the wheat again see we are back into the grain back into the seed from into the seed form again that brings the life germ the powerful life back in the seed every seed will bring forth after his kind and we know he is risen hallelujah god bless you all mightily in this conference i am so happy to greet you and may god be with you oh hallelujah glory to god do you appreciate that today glory to god hallelujah thank you amen hallelujah thank you lord oh let's just give him praise oh hallelujah right now hallelujah glory to god glory to god hey thank you so much for that special amen we certainly appreciate it today oh glory to god glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen and amen and amen oh hallelujah praise god but let's get ready to change the order of the service amen please i knew the lord do you love him today hallelujah amen and amen

holy name oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the lord god almighty oh hallelujah we give him all the glory we give him all the praise today amen hallelujah glory to god well as we switch over now to the word portion of the service amen it is our pleasure to introduce a man or speaker today so as he comes we pray to god it'll be a blessing to you praise god as he comes we welcome him amen and brotherly love amen and with christian faith god bless you amen and may the word amen bless your hearts today in jesus name pray amen and amen [Music] hallelujah thank you lord jesus i greet you saint in the name of the lord jesus christ you may be seated just for a minute or two before we go into [Music] are you happy to be in the house of the lord this morning amen i'm happy to be in the house of the lord even though the devil is fighting me but we thank god for he is faithful [Music] and this morning i'm standing here just maybe to start the greeting to the virtual convention a special greeting to brother solomon nachina is from life tabernacle to mali in ghana as the host pastor of the virtual convention on behalf of the pastor so i'm not standing here in my own capacity but i'm standing on behalf of pastor raymond thompson of etmb johannesburg south africa so i'm here just to stand in the gap on behalf of our pastor and to greet the convention at the same time also to appreciate the ministers that will be preaching this virtual convention we want to thank god for them and the different ministries and how their ministries has blessed the pride of christ around the world let's just give lord and praise for that for these powerful ministers that we're going to be hearing at this virtual convention [Music] and a tremendous blessing i mean even looking at the the inspiration for the convention that brother solomon had behold the bridegroom cometh it's lamb trimming time and if you go back 20 30 40 plus years all of these ministers had preached on this inspiration before so even what you're going to hear this morning is nothing new these ministers had preached on this before and why because they've preached from the vindicated word of a prophet that the prophet had brought himself at the same time also just to appreciate headstone tabernacle we know that they provide the platform to stream these conventions let's just give the lord and a praise for for headstone what a tremendous blessing they've been around the world and to the bride of christ for providing the platform also again like i said uh i'm just here standing in the gap for our pastor this is the second time around and i believe that you'll preach with me and i believe that the message is going to be a blessing [Music] so let's go into the word you may be just please stand so we can do the scripture reading and then we'll go into the word so this morning i've got three portions of scripture the first one is uh found in first thessalonians from uh chapter four and then we'll read from 16 to 18 and at the same time if you want to just hold on to first thessalonians 5 we'll read from verses 1 to 6 and then the third one will be from revelations 19 verse 7 to 10. if you find it we'll start with first thessalonians 4 16 it reads as follows for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words we'll go to first thessalonians 5 it's just the next chapter reading from verse 1 but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with a child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief we are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober we go to revelations 19 from verses 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he sayeth unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb so blessed are those that is called unto the meristep of the lamb and he sayeth unto me these are the true sayings of god and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy let's just bow our heads for the word of prayer almighty god eternal father we come to your throne of grace and mercy thanking you lord just for this opportunity that we have oh father to be found in your presence we thank you father god for this opportunity lord just to be able to share the word with your pride lord around the world and when it's going to be streamed we thank you for the reading of the word we know lord that we have a vindicated word we pray lord that it was a blessing to the reader as well as to the to the year of father lord i just want to commit myself into your hands at this stage father may no man be seen but may christ alone be seen i commit the service into your hands in the name of jesus christ amen and amen you may be seated amen amen agree to the saints again in the name of the lord jesus christ and at the same time also just to greet the rest of the bride around the world that will be watching this service when it's played may the lord richly bless you and i pray that this message will be a blessing so just to come back to the inspiration for the convention brother solomon gave it through as behold the bridegroom cometh lamp trimming time now we know that the inspiration is also based on matthew 25 where it speaks about the ten virgins the five wise the five foolish and the bridegroom coming now the prophet preaches a message on the 10 virgins in 144 000 and if you allow me i wanted to really look at this from a different angle because looking at that scripture it talks about the 144 000 then we know there's the five foolish and we know there's five wise we know the 144 000 has their place and they will have their two witnesses we know that the the the five foolish is the remnant but i wanna address really looking at the wise virgins and because out of that story if you understand it she must be a special lady and so this morning my message is is really to the bride and if i would title the message i would call it a message for the wise virgins or you could say a message to the wise ones because somewhere along the line their prophet says there is there's churches churches brides brides but there's only one special lady that is chosen and there's no ifs and buts when it comes to that the prophet says that he had chosen a bride out of his own choosing the very same way that you and i when we had chosen our wives or our brides it doesn't matter who else was there but she is that special lady that was chosen so this morning i want to address the message to this special lady because that's who he's coming for behold the bridegroom comes who's he coming for he's coming for the one that he chose so there's no misgivings there's no misunderstandings there's only one special lady and this is who i want to address the the message to the inspiration is the bride has made itself ready by the message of the hour because if the message of the hour didn't come she wouldn't have known that she was the chosen bride and if you and and i want you to take the the ministry of eliezer as the bottom line or the underlying theme for this message why because elaiza was sent to get a bride for isaac and if eleazar didn't come the bride would not have known that she's the chosen one and if she didn't accept the proposal the marriage would not have happened so so you and i are living in the most glorious time of all ages the prophet says why because it's the coming of the lord we're living in the age of the coming of the lord and if the church only recognizes who she is the prophet says the rapture will go so the message came to identify you as the bride of christ so that the rapture would go now the prophet says we've come through all the ages he says we've come through the reformers and he's talking about the church ages we've come through justification sanctification he says the restoration of the gifts but we are right now at the top of the tree and this is the age when the fruit is now being made manifest in other words it was the restoration of god himself appearing amongst us and that's basically what i want to take as a theme and if you look at it if you look at through the ages we know that god has chosen a bride through the church ages he says there was an elected seat for each and every age that came but now we come right up to where we are now and if you look back through the church ages the way the prophet will say he says they without us is not going to be made perfect so in other words they are depending on you the last church age bride to come to perfection so that you can call the resurrection and so that's what i want to do now just to set the theme the prophet in a message called ashamed he says he was troubled at some stage he said lord show me a character in the bible that my ministry ties into and in that message the prophet explains he's talking about when he was working for the public service company and and he you know he had he was just troubled and he says at that stage he says the he was led to just open up his bible he says and he opened up his bible and he opened it up right on to genesis 24. and on genesis 24 in genesis 24 abraham instructed his servant eliza to go and fetch a bride for my son isaac now that was the perfect identification of the ministry of malachi 4 to show exactly he asked the lord show me a character in the bible that my ministry fits in with and god allowed him to open up to genesis 24. now if you listen to the account of genesis 24 abraham extracts and he makes him swear that you're gonna go get a bride from my people and eliza says but what if she doesn't want to come he says but don't worry jehovah will send an angel before you he says but you're the one that's going to carry the message to her and you are the one that will bring her an introducer to my son and and and that's the underlying theme that i want to bring now mrs jesus christ is who will be preaching to in a message proving his word according to malachi according to malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 luke 17 30 specifically speaks about in the day when the son of man is to be revealed now in that message proving his word the prophet puts it this way he says what is the reason why the son of man is to be revealed he says is to join the church to its head then he says in that message it's to unite the marriage of the bride so in other words when we go to the marriage supper of the lamb the marriage ceremony has to take place why because the marriage supper is this is the celebration why because the two has already now been declared one they know are no longer twin but they are now one flesh and then they go to the wedding supper of the lamb so we're looking at the at the sequence of events before he comes and takes her away now the prophet says the bridegroom ko will come right through this and when he refers to that in a quote he says when the son of man comes down from heaven in flesh he says to unite the two together and the church itself has to be the word why because she is being joined to the word and we've preached on this before then he turns around he says the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man is to bring that uniting now can we clap our hands and thank god that he said an elohees a ministry to unite the bride with the bridegroom because rebecca did not know that she was the chosen one eliezer told her he chose you as the bride so there's no misgivings there's no misunderstandings there's only one bride there's only one rebecca that was chosen and the day that he comes back she is the one that he's coming for let's give the lord and a praise for that amen [Applause] he says and he took the very manifestation of the revealing of the son of man to identify her as the bride now he says who is the son of man he says it's jesus christ it's jesus christ himself that came down in human flesh amongst us he says to make his word so real that it unites the church and him as one and then he says the bride he says and then they will go to the wedding supper now he says the rapture is only going to the wedding supper he says but the word is here to unite the person now we've spoken on this before now when he says the person is referring to an individual is to unite the person and that is when the two becomes one now the prophet says at that time with the uniting time he says that is going to be the bride coming of christ so in other words it's the individual that is united with the word so it's not your denomination it's not your church it's not your group in the message or your denomination in the message it's about the individual that is united with the world and that is the person that makes part of the bride body in this day the scripture is fulfilled now we know that the manifestation of the ministry of the son of man is the bridegroom because improving is what the prophet says this now in this day the scripture is fulfilled he turns around and he says i say to you tonight this was preached in 1965 again that this day the scripture is fulfilled in your sight you in tucson you in in california you in new york you on the telephone hookups i say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your sight then he turns around in in that quote he says let us be glad let us be merry why for the marriage of the lamb is at hand and his bride has made herself ready so there's the marriage taking place it's mind-blowing and that's why we can thank god for sending this a ministry because i didn't know before the message came i didn't know that i'm bride material i didn't know that i was elected before the foundation of the world to make a part of his bride body for this age and they without me cannot be made perfect why because she will come to the perfect perfection to call up the resurrection my my my let's give the lord and a praise for that [Applause] [Music] now in exposition of the church the prophet says with the restoration of the word comes the restoration of the power he says but also it is a fact that the prophet of this last age must be bringing forth a message from god that will forerun the second coming so that was his ministry it was to forerun the second coming for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the pentecostal fathers and with the restoration of the word welcome the restoration of the power now jesus said in that day when the son of man is going to be revealed from heaven in a message the called out the prophet says this he says let me close by saying this that the son of man is now being revealed from heaven now that was the appearing of the son of man what was it it was a son of man revealing the son of man and then in that message called out he says it was the very same way that he revealed himself to abraham he says and the revealing comes just before the destruction and that also comes just before the changing of the body why because he visited abraham just before the body change and so if he does it that way he's always going to do it in the same way now he says in that day they missed it only abram recognized this man in flesh was the son of man why because by a revelation he had dressed him as my lord because behind that flesh was filled the son of man then in perfect faith he says this the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart but the word was failed in flesh when he done that so in other words the word was filled in flesh he stood with his back turned to the tent and he discerned what was in sarah's heart the word comes back in jeffersonville in our age the word was veiled behind flesh the word turned around and i'm going to read a quote where he says that very same angel that was sitting with abraham was now veiled behind flesh and is doing the very same thing that he did back then now abram recognized it and if you are the seed of abraham you too will recognize the appearing of the son of man behind human flesh and the identification is the discern of the thoughts and the intents of the heart now in a message the mark of the beast the prophet turns around in that message he turns his back to the audience and i'm going to read the quote he says this now there's many praying if i can if somebody like the little woman that can touch his garment he says yes right before me now is coming a vision it happens to be a woman she's sitting there now remember he's got his back down to the audience as he's speaking i'm reading the quote he says she has heart trouble also with my back turned if i call her name maybe she'd understand then he says mrs hudson mrs hansen stand up and receive your healing [Applause] now i've never looked around yet he says now do you believe he says just have faith where was the lady she's back this way somewhere he says right there then he says was those things true lady are we strange to one another it is wave your hand like this was all true was it question mark then he turns around and he says this then the same angel of god that was sitting there at sodom and gomorrah to give a sign to abraham that hour was that the hour was drawing close for the burning of sodom is here tonight [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now to you and i we were not there that night that he preached that message that he demonstrated the sign now blessed are you who has not seen but yet believed it why because you receive the prophet in the name of a prophet and you are the one that will receive the prophet's reward [Applause] my [Applause] [Music] now he says in convince then concerned he says there's a great difference between the sign of jesus appearing and then jesus coming in in that message he says now the appearing of the lord is now this is in his own monastery he says and he's appearing in his people so in other words there was a ministry of the son of man in the wave chief there's going to be a ministry in the son of man in his people that will be the bride coming of christ and when we say the lord is coming what the prophet was saying the lord is coming is it's a bride coming why because he's going to be reflecting himself at this day through his bright body and when that happens that is the kickoff to the resurrection because they meet him in the air the next time that jesus comes back would be uh it would be with the millennium so they won't see him in other words it's a sudden secret going away it's an invisible union of the bridegroom and the bride they won't even know that he's come to snatch her away they won't even know that the marriage of the lamb has already taken place [Applause] now he says it's a spirit that's working among them proving that it's him with them what will it be he says it's to get them ready for the rapture for the coming of the lord and to catch away his pride he says now that's the appearing and then he's coming now paul in the message a sudden secret going away of the church he says notice what paul said in second timothy 4 8. he says paul said there is a crown of righteousness laid up for me that the lord the righteous judge will give to me on that day he says then paul stopped notice why he paused he says did you notice why he paused and what did he say next he says but not only to me he says but to all of them that love is appearing all of them that love is appearing you and i love his appearing why because we recognized that this was god himself that had come down behind flesh and came to call you bride now when the prophet preached i don't know if you honest if you remember i think it was an exposition where he says for you to understand what i'm saying now i'm gonna call you pride this is what the prophet said he says for you to get the revelation i'm calling you bride why is he calling me bride when he preached what did he do he only preached the the opening of the word it was the revelation of the seals it was the mysteries being revealed but all of a sudden you recognize your name he says it was an oman evil only veil he just preached the mystery he preached the unfolding you are showing jesus christ he was unfolding your bridegroom to you and you recognized but that's me that's my name and that is you in the bride part of the bride you are the brain there's no misgivings there's no misconceptions when he comes he's coming for you there's no other lady that he's coming for my man now if you notice this is unquote is coming is set in motion by is appearing so he comes down and he appears behind the son of man [Music] that was the shout ministry but that appearing was setting into motion he's coming now if we look at this lady she must be someone very special for for the god of the universe for the god that created all of what we see and what we don't see to have chosen she must be someone special i wonder who this lady is the prophet says and if you take it and you tie now into the story of the ranch the ranch's son her cousins was like when she said you know what he said he's coming back for me they couldn't believe her that can't be when did you get to speak to you no do you remember the time that he appeared he came to visit that was when he spoke to me why because he had in between that time when they were celebrating and making us she was the one that was in the back parts she was the one that had a dirty apron he started he decided the ranch's wife the ranch's son to walk behind the building and all of a sudden he sees this virtuous girl [Music] and he spoke to her and he recognized in her very character that he wanted he recognized in her that she will be the very reflection of his nature and they can't understand but now when did he speak to you there was an appearance and he said he's coming back to for me they couldn't believe it why because it can't be you dirty you don't have your earrings on all you producing and all you're showing is the virtue but that is the character that he was looking for and so what happened is she's the one that he made the promise to so in other words it didn't matter how many suitors was there there's only one that he made a promise to there's only one that he comes back for and when the cry goes out behold the bridegroom cometh he's only coming for one elected lady and she is the one that he made a promise to that i'm coming and the prophet says he came that call went out in the seventh watch now the seventh watch is the hour just between twelve and three and he says the seventh watch is the seventh age and and and and the ministry of malachi 4 is that 7th watch so that shout message was behold the bridegroom is coming rise from your lamps and make yourself ready for him let's give a lot and a place let me get back to my notes bye [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen my my my special lady she's a special lady here's a portion of this bright body on the live stream she's probably she's all over individuals making up this bright body that he had chosen from before the foundation of the world now in who is this melchizedek the prophet says according to malachi 4 luke 17. he would appear again in human form amongst his people he's going to be doing the same things that he did you will be revealing the same things and he says you will be showing the same messianic sign now they missed it because they didn't see it coming in the way they thought it should come now if you look at the coming of the son of man when christ himself was made flesh when god himself was made flesh he says he didn't come as a theologian he didn't come as a priest he didn't come as the king the way the jews would have wanted him to come why because he will come and he will establish the kingdom of israel but the prophet says he came according to scripture and yet they failed to see it why because moses himself told them he prophesied and he said that god jehovah will rise up a prophet like unto me and in that message he says he came the way it was prophesied of him and in this very same day he came the way the scriptures foretold he came as a prophet he came veiled behind the prophet and as they did in that day they missed the coming or the appearing this is how they must be appearing but there's one special lady that did not miss it why because the message came specifically for her amen now as it was in the days of noah and in the days of lot it be in the coming of the son of man again he says just before the days of the anti-deluvian destructions this is in the called out he sent a prophet to the earth enoch he sent an angel he sent a message he done the supernatural he says but what did they do in that day they ate they drank they married they planted but they rejected the message that came and he says the very same thing he does in this day and in this age he sent an angel he sent a message he sent a messenger with the message he done the supernatural but what did they do they did eat they drink they marry they continue to plant but they missed the message that was brought then in called out he says what did that message consist of he says it consisted of grace mercy and deliverance now we know what enoch represented enoch represented the bride going and noah representing the the the remnant now he says in recognizing your day in his message the reason why the people he knows they did not go into the ark was because they never recognized the message or the messenger why because it was too simple [Music] for their scientific age so the simplicity of the message and the messenger is why they missed it he says noah wasn't scientific he wasn't even educated so in other words he might not even be able to articulate himself as well educated as they were in that day but he had a message from god it will reign and he preached that message to whoever was to be identified or for whoever that message was meant for and so because of the simplicity of that is why they missed it so we know that he came for an elected lady now just looking at who this bride is when did that election happen when did he say it's you now it took the message of the hour to come identify you as bride and you may ask yourself the question well when did he elect me to be part of this bride and we know we spoke about this in the first seal the prophet says do you know that he put the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace on you before the foundation of the world so so so he chose you as his bride even before he decided to form a molecule even before he decided to talk like to speak right into existence that is when he chose you now he says in that spoken word he says that he he put the wedding band of pre-destiny unmerited grace he slipped it on you that time already so in in this age or whenever you were born now you come into existence but you come from there [Applause] and he took the message of the owl to identify you to allow you now now i heard a preacher say before he says spiritual amnesia only means that you you you had the knowledge of something or the consciousness of something all it is is that you just forgot it so it only took that messenger to come and bring to your remembrance spiritual remembrance where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy you were there before the foundation of the world so he took this alley he's a ministry to come bring to you your remembrance do you know when he chose you do you know when he slipped the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace on your finger before the foundation of the world so now you realize yes he is special wow if he done that that was the attribute and now you the expression of that attribute so the very same you and i decide this is going to be my bride he says he took a brian out of his own choosing the prophet says he created his own bride and that's you and i that had come into manifestation and so that's the reason why i'm saying this message is for that special lady [Applause] the 144th has got their their time but it's about the special lady that it takes before that now he's now in the first seal he says the antichrist in that they will deceive all on the face of the earth whose names were not written under those seals from the foundation of the world and so therefore then we recognize and we realize that this is his perfect redemption plan when he took the book from the original owner that was his pride that was the redemption he says and the prophet puts it this way he says and that was him redeeming her comes down and he dies and he pays the price he goes up and he intercedes for each and every name as they come about in the designated decreed season he says but now we are talking about the time when he comes to redeemer so in other words to receiver because he's already come to redeem and he's coming to receive unto himself and the third time he comes with her as king and queen let's give the lord a hand of praise for that that's the reason why i'm saying she's a special special lady now talking about this election now in other words when was she elected in the first seal he says see now that's the elect when the sound come the bridegroom cometh then every one of those that slip down through those ages awakened he says everyone see it isn't god as we would think just going to hunt him out a few thousand people of this age and take them so it wasn't a haphazard choosing he says it's the very elected out of every age and that's the reason that christ has to stay on the meritorial seat back here as an intercessor until that last one comes in at the last age and the prophet turns around he says and these revelations then of what it has been breaks forth upon the people and they see what's happened so he took the message of the hour the shout message for to reveal to you to open it unto you it was the revealing of christ to show to you who you are because then we came to the realization that okay that's my name he says the very same way that john recognized his name when those seals was broken he saw himself and he saw himself as a bride he saw himself as a member of the bright body and when the mystery was preached you saw yourself and that's the reason why you rejoice the very same way that john rejoiced why because the opening of the seals showed me who i am it showed me who god is it showed me that he's elected me to be a part of his bride and that's why like john if we can only scream so that all of heaven everyone on the earth everyone beneath the earth will hear this rejoicing why because he has redeemed us from before the foundation of the world and he is the one that was found worthy to take the book to lose the seals and to redeemer and because he's redeemed he's the one that's coming to receiver to himself and that's the bride let's give the lord a praise amy now he says it's god that's calling the elected it's god that's calling a virtuous bride and she is the elected lady this is in the invisible union then the bride is always a part of the bridegroom why because we spoke about this before when when eve was taken from adam she was made from his body so this bride is a part of the bridegroom because she was taken out from him he says and it will have to be the word manifested to be the bride of christ now the prophet says he does this in every time he says by the same pattern he does it again he's calling out his virtuous bride in the last day then he says the lovely rebecca waiting for isaac he says oh what a beautiful time what a beautiful time why because she's got no misgiving she knows that she is the bride let's move on now the prophet in 10 virgins and 144 000 speaks about this seamstress and this is also just to show you the election he says there's a seamstress or a tailor cuts out the pattern she is the one that takes the scissor and cuts out of this pattern which part of the pattern will form a part of the garment that she makes then there's another part that is the remnant now the remnant is like the offcut but it's the same material then in in that message he says now what is this pattern how was it known he says by the one that placed the he says it's by the the part where the lady elected to cut so it's just a scissor cut that decides which part becomes a part of the garment which part becomes the remnant then he turns around he says now god before the foundation of the world who knew the end from the beginning buys for knowledge he elected where to cut my so if if you recognize this message and you accepted the appearing [Applause] you are the one that he elected where to cut then he turns around he says it's only he knew the difference between jacob and esau now look at how how marvelous this election was he says it's only god who knew before the foundation of the world but because he knew the end from the beginning by his four knowledge he says he elected where to cut then he turns around and he says our names were put on the book he says now listen to this he says our names was put on the book when he elected him to be the lamb that was going to be slain then he says then he elected you to be the one that the lamb is going to be slain for wow he says he elected you [Applause] he elected you to be associated with that lamb that was to be asleep then he says now what is the remnant he says that's the cut that's the piece that's cut and it's left but it's the same kind of goods he said but he didn't make the cut then he says now look at god's election look at god's predestination look at god's ordination he says it's him that decides and it's him that takes the church out of that he turns around and he says it's the remnant that will be left to go into the tribulation period [Music] in the rapture message so there's nothing but the bride the elected ones that was four known by god from the beginning he says the father's spiritual genes so in other words she was that attribute in the father and she is nothing but the bride so in other words you come from god and you're going back to god now as god brought the nation out of a nation god will bring the pride out of a church the bride will be called from all the churches it will be the elected of god will be brought out and we're on the verge of that exodus right now for we have every scriptural proof that we're standing there now he says i know that that that's been said a lot of times but my friend one time it will be said for the very last time [Applause] [Music] he says time will fade into eternity then he's coming to take a bride out of the church my my am i let's give the lord a praise now in the marriage ceremony at some stage the two is declared one so in other words i present to you must and misses jesus christ in other words she is now her identification is now in the bridegroom why because she takes on his name and so the two is now one in the marriage of the lamb he says as the feminist spirit was taken from adam and was put into the woman and when that happened he said then she was both or they were both in spirit and in body they were one then in marriage of the lamb he says now it was a beautiful type of what god did at calvary he took christ and he connected him with the church through a riven side he says he brought the blood that cleans the person that sanctifies the flesh of the church and puts the spirit of the living god that he took off the cross there he says out of christ he took the spirit out of christ and he puts it into the individual again it's not your church now we're talking about the individuals that makes up the bright body he says and when he does that he says then the two becomes one he says they become one why because it will be christ in you the hope of glory now he says then another thing is as soon as she takes a vows so she takes a vows she takes on her husband's name and then they are declared mister and misses jesus christ my wife is mrs thompson why because she took on my name and the two has now become one and he says when she does that then what does that make her she is now a of everything that he possesses [Applause] because when you see the bridegroom you see the bride she is a of all that he possesses why because she is misses jesus christ there's no other one that was that was joined to him but her a little while in the world will see me no more but you bride will see me why because i will be with you even in you until the end of the world what is that that is christ in you the hope of glory the two has become one and so now all we're waiting for is we're waiting the prophet says in uniting time and sign he says there's a uniting right on now he says what is she uniting for she's uniting for the rapture he says and who is she uniting with she is united with the word why because the bridegroom is the word now as the bride is a part of the bridegroom the woman is a part of her husband and then he takes the same type this is in rapture message the same type as when he says now if you look at eve was taken from adam so eve's mechanics was adam's mechanics the the feminist spirit of adam the first created man was put into that body so she was flesh of his flesh she was born of his bone she was spirit of his spirit and then he turns around in that message he said now the very same way this bride is taken from the bosom of the word of god for this day if she is taken from the bosom of the word of god for this day then she is word of his word why because he is the word that was made flesh and as soon as the uh his spirit comes into it to quicken that word to make it to life that's the bright body that comes to life so then she is word of his word flesh of his flesh bone of his bone she is spirit of his spirit and that is what makes her bride [Applause] so let's move on to the oil [Music] [Applause] in marriage of the lamb the prophet says now we know the oil is spirit and that's what the representation of the oil in the lamp was its spirit it says the marriage of the lamb christ injects into her his own spirit he says it's his own life and as the bible said to adam and eve that you are no longer two or you are no longer twin but you are now one he says when this woman the church is married to christ they too are no longer two but they are one because it will be christ in you then he turns around and says it's his life that has been brought into you so he sanctifies her so that he can bring his own life into her the prophet turns around he says then you become pride christ in you the hope of glory pokemon church age now from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride she is virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man made creeds or dogmas by and through the members of this bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin now the word of promise came to the virgin mary but that word of promise was ye himself to be made manifest in other words when the angel appeared the angel brought the message of good tidings to this virgin and he said to her the blessed are you amongst many virgins [Applause] [Music] but you are the one that he chose and because she accepted the angel visitation she accepted the message that the angel brought the prophet says what was that manifestation it was he himself to be made manifest in her and through her that was eternal life he says because she believed the angel's message he says through her he was able to fulfill the prophecy of isaiah 9 6. why because she believed blessed are you amongst all the other virgins now notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed to him by the father then he goes to saint john 5 19 he says now this harmony is also to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it the word is in the bride as it was in mary [Music] in other words she is pretty impregnated with the word and the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to fulfill it comes to full harvest to serve its purpose now he says that my word is spirit are we doing well with time then he refers to the wise virgin he says the wise virgin had oil in a lamp she trimmed the lamp when she heard the call and then he turns around and he says now we know that god is the word and we know that the oil is the spirit in conflict between god and satan he says god said that my word is spirit he says that's right then the true bride must be united by the word if she is a part of christ she has to be the word of christ in other words in both mechanics and dynamics and he says it in that quote that there has to become more there has to come one that will have both mechanics and dynamics and with the restoration of the word came the restoration of the power so that he can fulfill in her the bright coming of christ now if the oil is spirit then by one spirit are we all baptized into the body according to matthew 25 which is the kingdom and according to first corinthians 12 13 in a sudden secret going away of the church he says keep oil in your lamp he says the oil is the spirit the holy spirit when you feel your love dying away and your sincerity towards christ he says go quickly to him who is the fountain of that oil so in other words this is what we know what the oil is we know that the oil is the holy spirit that's why according to ephesians 4 30 we grieve not the holy spirit because it's by that spirit that we are baptized that we are sealed until the day of our redemption until he comes and gets her now he says when she when he comes at that day he is coming for his holy spirit character he's coming because he wants to see his own nature reflected through her and so that's why ephesians 4 30 is so important to us as the bride because we don't want to grieve that spirit this is what we want he says in that quote he says keep oil in your lamp now remember we're addressing the wise virgins keep oil in your lamp he says if you feel it dying out go quickly and replenish he says why go to the fountain of that oil he is the fountain of that oil [Applause] now in mark of the best seal of god he says now there's a difference between the seal and a mark he says notice in genesis cane was marked but the marking of cain meant a distinction in other words it was a distinction and it was also brought about separation because as soon as cain was marked he went out from the presence of god so the mark was a separation to him then the prophet says he says i can show you and i can show you that the mark and the seal all the way from genesis and i'll run it right through to revelations he says but look at the difference between the two the one is to separate but the other one is a sign of ownership in other words if the church is sealed by the holy spirit it's showing that she is owned by him and that's the reason why the scripture says you are sealed until the day of your redemption until the day that you reach your destination so that ceiling shows ownership [Applause] so we don't want the mark because the mark is a separator depart from me because i never knew you you want the ceiling why because the ceiling shows that i belong to the bridegroom i am his she is him and you are sealed until the day of your destination why am i that is a beautiful one that one bless me let's give the lord another praise [Applause] 10 virgins 144 he says what is the seal of god the holy ghost sure all right now he that has not the spirit of god is none of mine if you have the holy spirit you are part of god because you he is he's sealed you and he's in you he's working in you and the signs that he does you do also now does everybody understand that he says you class it takes the holy spirit to be gods so if you want to be a part of that ownership it takes the holy spirit to be gods and this is in 10 virgins amen we're getting there christ is the mystery of god revealed now in this message really it's to identify the bride the bright body he says his body will do the works that he promised like in mark 16 and so forth his body was not held in the grave but it was recognized with him in the resurrection now in this message the prophet speaks about when he was lying in the tomb he saw went down to hell to preach to the to the to the lost and his body was a representation of his bright body he says if that body was recognized with him in the resurrection then he turns around and he says then the the body of his believing children will not be held in the grave when he comes why because they will be recognized with him so in other words his bride body of his believing children the very same way that that body was a representation and that body was raised when he came up he says then all of those believing children that had died in christ his bride body that was represented through the church ages he says they come up [Music] because they are represented with him in the resurrection when he comes and he says it's for that purpose that he went to go and die so he died so that he can resurrect his bride [Music] so his body is recognized with him why because the body is is the word because she was made from him flesh of his flesh word of his word spirit of his spirit christ is the mystery of god revealed he says now do you see the seals when he's in his meritorial work back there redeeming but someday he's coming forth to get this book that is redeemed so in other words in revelations 5 he went to go and take the book so he does his editorial work but there's a day coming that is coming to come and receiver he says and all that's in this book would be him so in other words she is him the names that was in the book is him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in that he come forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when you are slain as a lamb now as long as them names have not been manifested on the earth he stays at the intercessory so in other words if you or if there's an elected seed that was not yet made manifest on the earth he stays there for that name because that name was in the book [Music] he'll stay there because that is the reason why he died it was for god and all day he stays there for those that god had ordained to eternal life invisible union now your name is now in the new book he says it's not the book of life but the lamb's book of life he says it's what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural union he says but you're new and then he just says pride then he turns around and he says your new life is in the lamb's book of life then he turns around and he says your marriage certificate that's your marriage certificate [Applause] beautiful so the lamb's book of life is my marriage certificate to show that i'm married to the bridegroom let's move on invisible union he says now you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god the prophet turns around in invisible union he says oh that spiritual union of christ and his church when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested and vindicated he says now we're nearing the coming of the lord jesus to be united with his church where the word becomes word why because she is a word bride and then when i want to move on to the coming of the lord now we know how the prophet preaches this he says the coming of the lord is a process and as we read the scripture in first thessalonians he says he comes in a shout voice and a trump and christ jesus christ himself does all three he says he had to send a shout message to get the people ready and with the shout message he came and he that brought back the person of jesus christ it was a son of man revealing the son of man but it was god himself that had come since 1963 it was that angel the mighty angel that had come down himself the seventh seal himself had come down in that shout message and that was already the coming of the lord so we've been living in the coming of the lord [Applause] and that's been the process the prophet says as he descends he comes in a shout in a voice and a trumpet so he comes in a shout message he says the second part will be the voice of the resurrection the voice of the resurrection will be he himself in the bride that's the reason why she will be the final voice to the final age but she will be that under messenger why because the shout message had to come first become an identifier and then he himself steps into her as the voice of the resurrection then the third step is the trumpet of god he says to call israel to the feast of the trumpets and to call her to the marriage supper now do you see this coming he says and now we also understand the process of redemption which is linked into that why because he came to redeem and the second time he comes to receive and shout voice trump is in the receiving and the third time he's coming with her as king and queen now that's the process of his coming let's give lord and praise we're almost there now looking at this process the first thing he comes he comes in a shout out now what was the south he says it was the message that went forth that screamed out behold the bridegroom is coming rise trim your lamps he says then they all rose and tramly lambs but some found out that they had no oil and then it turns around it says but we are we are right now in lamp trimming time then the second process is talks about he says it is the voice of the resurrection now we know that the voice of the resurrection he says and the resurrection is the person of jesus christ and it's also an event he says but it's that same loud voice he says the same voice i've seen john 11 38 and since john 11 38 it was jesus christ him stand in standing in the front of the grave of lazarus saying to martha roll away the stone and called lazarus from the dead he says now that very same voice will be failed in her to call the dead saints from the grave [Applause] so the first process is get the bride together the second thing is call up the dead he says and together they we're going to meet him in the air and in that is the body change to meet the lord in the a but it's only to a special lady we're almost there so the third process is the trumpet of god he says and we know that the the feast of trumpets is always to call the people to the feast and what is that now in in in feast of the trumpets he says that was always a sign for israel to come to the feast he says and that is we'll be calling the bride to the supper he says the the lamb supper with the bride so in other words the marriage has already taken place she's already been declared mrs jesus christ now she goes to the wedding supper of the lamb now his wife has made herself ready she's laid aside all things just like esther because esther was the only one that was chosen among all of the maidens but she chose to avail herself in a virtue only she laid aside all other things and that is why the king chose her he says and at that day the way paul had spoken he will crown he says it's a crown of glory with a crown of righteousness to crown his queen at that day now conflict between god and satan when esther was to be chosen to stand before the king she didn't adorn herself with all the things but she adorned herself with a sweet meek spirit he says that's what the bride is adorning herself with with all of the fruits of the spirit following it he says what she got she's assembling together in the fellowship of the word he says amen fellowship of the word that's right she's fellowshipping she's sitting together in heavenly places in christ jesus tonight in one accord in one place one spirit one mind one hope one god one purpose [Applause] and there's your type now even though they were all sanctified talking about the versions he says there was only five that was wise enough to have the wisdom of revelation to catch the door only five that was wise enough to have the wisdom of revelation to catch that open door he says see what was it to be filled with the spirit so in other words when the when the core went out she was wise enough to have that extra oil so that when the bridegroom came she was able to catch the open door now that's a quote in the philadelphia church age now we almost there then in a message perfect faith he says talking about this bride now you have to have substance faith to be or rather substance faith has to be in the bride for her to be bribed material and to get to her into a rapturing condition i'm reading the quote so when a man lives by faith and he walks by faith the prophet says i mean substance faith he is so isolated from the entire world and he becomes a new creature in christ he says there now you're getting into bright material see see you're getting into a rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor the deacons the trustees he says that means for the laity every individual walks in the world with god alone god taking his rightful place in our hearts he says then you're baptized into the kingdom now he's giving the secret now he says there's nobody in there but you and god he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of a doubt no way you walk right on if the lord says this there's nobody in the world that can talk you out of it in other words this is my husband nobody in the world is going to be able to talk me out of this he says you go right on just the same he says now you're coming into perfect faith a perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails he says yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so it is now with those who have perfect faith are mystic to the others and he's talking about you now [Applause] so we're coming now to the perfection he says why because the people has to come to this in order to go into the rapture now he says the church has to come into a perfect raptured faith then in in perfect faith he says now that means a lot of shaving down for me and he says it means a lot for you he says but together we're gonna make it by the grace of god that's our lamp trimming time why because the prophet of our age under our messenger [Music] that said together we going to make it by the grace of god it will mean a lot of shaving down so in other words we all will need to trim our lamps why because we know the bridegroom is coming so it will take a lot of shaving down for me it will take a lot of shaving down for you but by the grace of god we're gonna make it by the grace of god he sent a message for you to catch that open door first seal he says now god help me tonight to show you that through this we are to receive a messenger that's going to tie up the loose ends you may rise to your feet i'm actually coming to a close the musicians can come [Music] and this is where i want to strike rapturing faith god help me tonight to show you through here that we are to receive a messenger that's going to come and tie up the loose ends and is going to reveal the whole secret of god for what purpose is it come to reveal the whole secret of god you can play something he says it's for the rapturing of the church [Music] then in first seal now in paragraph 75 he says this [Music] and then there is coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all and i believe now this is the prophet that spoke now remember we we preaching to the wise virgins because they they had a revelation of something that the others did not have they had wisdom of revelation to catch the open door but to have the extra will now he says i believe and this is the prophet that said this this is a quote it's no man's doctrine that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the pride together for rapturing faith and if he's tied the thunders into rapturing faith [Music] then we know what that extra oil was that those wise virgins had and that's the reason why the pastor has been preaching this inspiration all his life because we know what that extra oil is [Music] in statue of a perfect man he says now if you embalm a man in other words you take the blood out of that man he is gone he says the only way to bring him back he says if you pour another blood into him now if you pour in the blood of jesus christ he says what will it bring it brings the faith of jesus christ it brings the virtue of jesus christ it brings the knowledge of jesus christ it brings the temperance of jesus christ it brings the patience of jesus christ it brings the godliness of jesus christ the brotherly kindness of jesus christ and then he says finally the love of god which is jesus christ the love of god at the top of the pyramid which is jesus christ now that's the oil that the wise ones had let's give the lord another praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] there's absolutely no mistake there's absolutely no misunderstanding who she is because he sent the eliezer ministry to identify who she is she accepted when when rebecca was asked let the maiden speak for herself [Music] it didn't matter what mommy said it didn't matter what the uncle said elijah said what do you say she said i will go and as soon as she was on a road to meet isaac isaac metter halfway the prophet says in the field and how he recognized her was he recognized her by the dress the garments that he sent with eliza now the prophet says he says lord crown my ministry by allowing me this dispensational prophet eloisa ministry sent for this last age to dress your pride in the righteousness of your word and when he comes he recognizes that that's the gift that he sent with eliza and he recognizes that's my pride isaac ran out to the field he met in the middle he didn't meet her at home before he took her home he met her halfway in the field and that is what we're looking for to meet our isaac in the sky changing of the body rest in his righteousness taken up to meet our lord in the air my let's give the lord a praise [Music] what shall i do with jesus call christ let me say something too this uniting time to see churches uniting nations uniting it's a uniting time of god and his bride too and i say this with reverence and respect i believe that the bride of christ is called i believe she is sealed in the kingdom of god i believe that the mechanics is there they're waiting for the dynamics that will take her off the earth into glory in the rapture i believe it with all my heart this is the prophet [Music] he says yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it and we know how we typed the changing of sarah's body he says with that he says and that was it it was the word himself that formed a new person from the inside out to change to be able to receive the promised son perfect strand by perfect weakness come lord jesus catch away your church and if it be your will lord just before that church is raptured may there rise power oh god fill these vessels raise them up lord shake this world once more we know it will be past time there will be no repentance then it'll be too far for them then but show your power lord fill those vessels and shake this world like it's never been shook before take your church then and leave this world in a chaos that she sets him let's give the lord a no praise i'm done [Applause] [Music] give the lord a end of praise for the elohesa ministry that came to identify you as the bride that came to take away the spiritual amnesia and told you that you rebecca is the one that he chose among all of the maidens there was only one that was chosen and when the bridegroom goal goes out behold the bridegroom comes he's coming for the one that he had chosen there is no misunderstandings about that they might laugh at like the rancher's son coming to the maiden they don't know when did he speak to you when did he propose to you he's coming for me they might not believe it but there is only one bride and that's you god richly bless you amen oh thank you jesus
