[12:19] lord we
[12:20] hope we appreciate the lord that the
[12:22] believers would gather together this way
[12:24] and to hear
[12:26] from you to hear word from you to get a
[12:28] word of encouragement a word of
[12:30] inspiration a word that would pilot and
[12:33] better guidance in their lives
[12:34] father may be soon as they bless the
[12:37] word the scripture will be read bless
[12:39] the things that will be said made edify
[12:40] and strengthen them in jesus name i ask
[12:42] it amen and amen god bless you and
[12:45] welcome tonight i trust that all of you
[12:47] are doing fine
[12:49] and i trust that all of you here tonight
[12:51] must have heard the wednesday night
[12:53] service
[12:54] uh have no other gods before me and i
[12:56] pray if you haven't heard it you should
[12:58] listen to it
[13:00] it's a very very important message
[13:02] i think it's relevant today
[13:05] and um i would see what the lord will do
[13:06] tonight um
[13:08] i guess
[13:10] um
[13:11] you know sometimes
[13:14] not
[13:15] just you
[13:16] but i myself wonder
[13:18] how things come how scriptures come how
[13:21] thoughts come how inspiration come
[13:24] to share with god's people
[13:26] and
[13:27] and many times i know it's the lord it's
[13:30] not my thinking is that my studies
[13:33] is just
[13:35] being
[13:36] called to say it inspired
[13:38] by
[13:40] the spirit of god to see
[13:42] and to share and to get certain things
[13:45] and
[13:46] i'm grateful to god uh it's not
[13:49] a human ability but i feel that
[13:52] we are hearing from god i believe that
[13:54] we are hearing
[13:56] from the spirit of god on the word and
[13:58] to help us in this hour
[14:00] because it's very treacherous they'd
[14:02] have more bibles more books more
[14:03] ministers more preachers more teachers
[14:05] more voices
[14:07] more influences by way of
[14:09] facebook and youtube and
[14:12] tv evangelists and messengers and so on
[14:14] like that there's so much voices today
[14:16] and but ram talk about it runs out
[14:19] the voice of god
[14:21] and it's shocking
[14:22] because the the prophecies that will be
[14:25] found in the last days and from a
[14:27] natural intellectual standpoint
[14:30] it's virtually virtually almost
[14:32] impossible to think there's a family
[14:34] and that farming is not books and tapes
[14:37] and preachers and ministers we have tons
[14:39] of that but the famine is for the
[14:41] hearing
[14:42] of the true word of god what would cut
[14:45] past
[14:46] the different voices today what would
[14:48] cut past the influences that the other
[14:50] christians
[14:51] goddess have tied up
[14:53] in many different influences and they
[14:55] speak it you speak what is influence in
[14:58] your life
[14:59] you speak what is upon your heart you
[15:01] speak what is near to you what you are
[15:03] thinking about
[15:04] it's near to your mouth if it's politics
[15:06] you find yourself talking politics is
[15:08] religion or whatever it is it will come
[15:11] out your mouth it's abundance of the
[15:13] heart the mouth will speak
[15:14] so whatever is bubbling up inside your
[15:16] heart even though
[15:17] your churchy or go to church or whatever
[15:20] it is it will come out and etch out your
[15:21] mouth if you're negative on the inside
[15:23] it's bubbling on the inside
[15:25] and for a while christian environment
[15:27] you talk a little positive or talk good
[15:28] or whatever it is but generally the
[15:30] negative will begin to spew itself out
[15:33] so i trust today that god
[15:35] help us help us
[15:37] i think the 23rd of march last year 2021
[15:41] but isaac uh uh
[15:43] spoke a message a bible study changed
[15:45] your mind change your world 20 to the
[15:47] most just about one year ago
[15:49] change your mind
[15:51] change
[15:52] your world and the thing of it is
[15:56] and listen carefully now
[15:59] people
[16:00] have been trained
[16:02] to listen
[16:04] not so much apply
[16:07] but to hear
[16:10] and
[16:12] the challenge is how do you get people
[16:14] from just hearing
[16:17] to begin
[16:18] to want to apply
[16:20] you know something we read i think was
[16:21] wednesday but abram said that
[16:24] his wife had made himself already
[16:26] and he's talking about
[16:28] the true bride the true vine
[16:31] judges herself
[16:35] it almost appears as if
[16:37] okay
[16:38] so
[16:39] the the prophet of the hour brought the
[16:41] close of the world
[16:43] but the bride have to dress herself
[16:46] the clothes is there
[16:48] the promises are there he talked about
[16:50] being wrapped in the gong of his
[16:52] promises of the promised world but what
[16:55] do you do do you sit and it's something
[16:57] that scared me in my league christian
[16:59] experience
[17:00] i was scared of
[17:03] with us
[17:04] uh a message a world
[17:07] people
[17:08] coming out of the pentecostal waiting
[17:10] for the rapture
[17:13] waiting for the rapture and when i
[17:17] saw the prophet say the rapture is a
[17:18] revelation
[17:20] so i i i always believe that the
[17:22] pentecostals of course we know they
[17:25] missed the boat but they didn't have the
[17:26] right picture of what the rapture is
[17:27] about they're looking to be caught up to
[17:29] meet him in the ear
[17:30] without seeing that it takes a
[17:33] revelation
[17:34] to really go and meet him
[17:36] a real revelation of god not your
[17:38] inspiration not your thoughts and ideas
[17:41] but what the words say
[17:42] and
[17:45] as we get deeper
[17:47] you'd realize god
[17:49] keeps his word
[17:50] you know i'm saying something isaac
[17:53] about
[17:54] about uh obedience about obedience
[17:57] someone was talking about obedience a
[17:58] show what obedience looked like
[18:01] contrasted with disobedience i know we
[18:04] talked a little bit i was thinking about
[18:05] brother branham
[18:06] when god told him to go among the
[18:08] pentecostals
[18:10] and he disobeyed
[18:11] and he lost his wife he lost his
[18:13] daughter
[18:14] um he had the flood he lost the
[18:16] anointing for five years
[18:18] and i was thinking about it i was
[18:19] thinking that even though
[18:21] this was a man of god called of god and
[18:24] a prophet
[18:26] it still didn't
[18:27] it still didn't escape
[18:29] god's anger or god's judgment or words
[18:33] and
[18:35] displeasure
[18:37] of his behavior or his conduct
[18:39] now all sons must be tried all sun must
[18:42] be tested
[18:43] and there has to be a basis on which god
[18:45] tests us
[18:47] just like children go to school
[18:49] and after
[18:51] they learn they have to get a test to
[18:52] walk to the next level
[18:54] i see it as we as sons
[18:57] have to go through our own tests
[18:59] we admire but ram's testimony we admire
[19:02] other things because we can he went
[19:04] through and he shared and so like that
[19:06] but when come to us
[19:08] in our times of distress what do we do
[19:12] and it was not worthy in the scripture
[19:14] we read on wednesday night oh god say
[19:16] well listen um go to your gods the god
[19:19] that you choose you leave me you forsake
[19:21] me you know i brought you that protector
[19:24] each i brought you out of different
[19:25] conditions and situations and your
[19:28] choice you choose yourself for the gods
[19:30] you choose to let your heart
[19:31] go astray
[19:33] and i hope that the words we share
[19:35] tonight would help you help your heart
[19:38] jesus rebuke them we hear the scripture
[19:41] these people honor me with their lips
[19:43] but their heart is far from me
[19:45] so you want to get your lips
[19:48] and heart
[19:49] aligned
[19:51] it was those people
[19:53] their lips and their hearts were
[19:56] were not in alignment
[19:57] what they were seeing with their mouths
[19:59] and what they were operating with at the
[20:00] heart level was two different things and
[20:02] that is what makes hypocrisy
[20:04] but when we get what we speak with our
[20:06] mouth line up with what we have in our
[20:08] heart
[20:09] that is a channel that faith and god
[20:13] presence and power can go through
[20:15] so may god bless you tonight strengthen
[20:17] you
[20:18] and i hope that there could be a shift
[20:20] if i see a paradigm shift a shift in
[20:22] your mind
[20:23] that you're not
[20:25] coming just to hear words
[20:27] but you're coming to get clues
[20:30] as to what you must do
[20:32] clues
[20:33] it's almost like the bible is a puzzle
[20:35] a puzzle you know like children long
[20:37] time used to if you have
[20:39] like uh finding the treasure hunt
[20:41] treasure hunt and you put a clue here
[20:43] and a clue there under stones and rocks
[20:44] and different things and when you find
[20:46] this clue when they get this screw it
[20:48] leaves another place and then you get
[20:49] another clue and eventually get to the
[20:51] treasure it's almost something like that
[20:53] clues clues of life who wants it who's
[20:56] hungering for it who's still still fit
[20:59] it is troubling and you may hear me
[21:01] repeating myself to see people who
[21:03] sometimes don't have a desire to change
[21:06] their content with themselves
[21:08] actually they are god to themselves
[21:11] they are absolute
[21:13] in themselves they are their own god
[21:16] if their wife their husband don't tell
[21:18] them anything they pass the catalan as
[21:20] the church nobody can tell they tell
[21:22] themselves
[21:23] you see
[21:24] and
[21:25] no there's in subjection to no one no
[21:28] one could instruct them guide them
[21:30] rebuke them whatever they power their
[21:33] own ship and so on like that but that
[21:35] ship eventually will crash because
[21:37] that's not who god's set up man man was
[21:39] supposed to be dependent
[21:43] on god
[21:44] dependent on god that is what man is
[21:47] supposed to be dependent on god seeing
[21:49] god as his source as his strength as his
[21:52] life and his joy so let's get into
[21:54] something here tonight let me have your
[21:55] bibles i'll let you turn to romans 12
[21:58] and
[21:59] romans chapter 12
[22:01] and philippians chapter 4 scripture
[22:03] reading tonight let me just give the
[22:05] scripture
[22:09] uh romans chapter 12 from mega scripture
[22:11] i believe i beseech you therefore
[22:13] brethren by the mercies of god
[22:16] that you present your bodies a living
[22:18] sacrifice
[22:19] holy
[22:20] acceptable unto god which is your
[22:21] reasonable service
[22:23] and be not conformed to this world and
[22:26] this is where we want to go tonight but
[22:27] be transformed
[22:29] by the renewing of your mind
[22:31] that you may prove
[22:32] what is that good
[22:34] unacceptable
[22:36] and perfect will of god and the
[22:37] amplified verse 2 says do not be
[22:39] conformed to this world this age
[22:42] fashion after and adapted to its
[22:43] external superficial superficial customs
[22:47] but be transformed changed
[22:50] by the entire renewal of your mind
[22:53] by its
[22:55] new ideals
[22:56] and its
[22:57] new attitude let me repeat that
[23:00] by renewal of your mind by new ideas and
[23:03] new attitudes that you may prove for
[23:05] yourselves what is the good
[23:07] unacceptable and perfect will of god
[23:10] even the thing which is good and
[23:11] acceptable and perfect in his fight
[23:13] for you
[23:15] philippians chapter four
[23:16] you want to read verse five
[23:19] paul speaks let your moderation be known
[23:21] under all men
[23:23] the lord is at hand
[23:24] be careful for nothing
[23:26] because in everything by prayer and
[23:28] supplication but thanksgiving let your
[23:30] requests be made known under gods all
[23:32] the issues trials tribulations problems
[23:35] you have and what let it be known to god
[23:38] make a request under god the seven and
[23:40] the peace of god which passed that all
[23:43] understanding shall keep your hearts
[23:46] and minds
[23:48] to jesus christ and this is the verse
[23:50] you want to get to tonight eat
[23:52] finely bread with it
[23:53] whatever things are true
[23:56] whatever things are honest
[23:59] whatsoever things are judged
[24:01] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[24:04] things are lovely
[24:05] whatsoever things are a good report
[24:08] if there be any virtue
[24:11] and if there be any praise
[24:13] think
[24:15] on these things
[24:16] tonight
[24:18] our little title i'd like to put us
[24:20] renew your mind
[24:21] think
[24:23] on these things renew your mind
[24:25] the amplified of that same voice it says
[24:28] for the rest brethren whatever is true
[24:32] whatever is worthy of reverence and is
[24:35] honorable unseemly whatever is just
[24:39] whatever is pure whatever is lovely and
[24:42] lovable whatever is kind and winsome and
[24:45] gracious if there be any virtue and
[24:48] excellence if there be anything worthy
[24:50] of priests think on
[24:52] we
[24:54] take account of these things
[24:56] fix
[24:57] your minds
[24:59] on them
[25:01] note
[25:02] note
[25:04] this list
[25:05] that paul
[25:07] presented here to think on these things
[25:09] this list
[25:11] excludes the negative the filthy
[25:15] the what is a contrary
[25:18] what is not wholesome it leaves those
[25:21] things out not does those things doesn't
[25:23] exist
[25:24] but he's trying to get them to refocus
[25:27] to renew to think
[25:29] but
[25:30] i said to friends across the world
[25:32] now you go to look for me i will listen
[25:35] to the angelic choir there are great
[25:37] voices sanki's the phones i love good
[25:39] singing but one of the greatest things
[25:41] i've ever had for enjoyment
[25:44] is meditation in the word of god to me
[25:47] there's one thing that's fundamentally
[25:49] and one thing that is true
[25:51] one thing that is infallible that's the
[25:53] word of god to me all christendom must
[25:56] be based upon one
[25:58] solid thing
[25:59] the word of god and that's the
[26:00] foundation and that's what we are here
[26:03] for tonight is the fellowship around
[26:06] this word
[26:07] and meditate on the word you know the
[26:11] way to find god is to meditate upon god
[26:14] think of god
[26:15] david spoke of it how he would bind the
[26:18] laws on his bedpost how he would merit
[26:21] it day and night
[26:23] and speaking about medication meditation
[26:26] psalms 1 says blessed is the man that
[26:28] walketh not in the counsel of the
[26:30] ungodly of standards in the way of
[26:32] sinners or sisters in the seat of the
[26:34] scornful
[26:35] stand it in the way of sinners let me
[26:36] just pause there you
[26:39] as a believer
[26:40] live in such a
[26:42] a way
[26:43] that if you become a stumbling block to
[26:45] the sinners don't do that
[26:47] no sit in the seat of this cornfield but
[26:50] here we go with two
[26:51] but his delight
[26:53] is in the law of the lord
[26:55] and his law
[26:56] that he meditated dear knight
[26:59] his delight is in facebook no
[27:02] is in youtube no
[27:04] is in what's up whatever social media
[27:06] have out there no his in light is in the
[27:08] law of the lord
[27:10] and in his law thought he made the dear
[27:13] knight what happened to this man now he
[27:14] shall be like a tree planted by the
[27:16] rivers of water so when you see
[27:19] that man
[27:20] a man a woman
[27:22] and i was thinking about man
[27:24] there's only one man who admits enough a
[27:26] male man and a female man male man is
[27:28] man
[27:29] and the female man is woman so woman
[27:32] man he shall be like a tree planted by
[27:35] the rivers of water that bringing forth
[27:37] his fruit in his season disease also
[27:40] inshallah whichever he does
[27:42] the ungodly are not so
[27:45] but they're like the chaff which the
[27:46] wind drowns away therefore the ungodly
[27:48] shall understand and the judgment or
[27:50] sinners in the conversation of the
[27:51] righteous but the lord nor does the
[27:53] righteous and the way of them godly
[27:55] shall perish
[27:57] so paul
[27:58] paul is trying to get us
[28:00] to have deliberate
[28:03] thought and attention to these things
[28:06] you know sometimes
[28:08] like
[28:09] uh
[28:10] there are something called i think it's
[28:12] it
[28:13] is something so some attention this
[28:16] deficit disorder with children they
[28:18] can't stay focused for long you know
[28:20] they're always pretty fidgety and
[28:22] somewhere are you like that in the
[28:23] spirit realm
[28:24] where you can't focus long enough for
[28:27] something to soak into you see so so
[28:31] this here tonight
[28:32] is trying to get us to have a deliberate
[28:35] thought
[28:36] a deliberate attention as to what we
[28:39] must apply and what we must do
[28:41] so so paul identify all these things
[28:43] whatever that could report what if it's
[28:45] honest and so on and in a world today
[28:48] that is so full of misinformation
[28:51] disinformation
[28:53] lies what is ugly what is disgusting
[28:57] what is rude crude ungodly and
[29:00] everything else
[29:01] he this is a challenge
[29:03] that our minds could become disciplined
[29:07] to dwell on
[29:09] these things to think on
[29:12] these things every single day whether
[29:15] it's on the news whether it's on
[29:17] facebook whether it is on the internet
[29:19] whether it is and whatever on the
[29:20] streets the signboards whatever it is it
[29:23] is information bombarding us
[29:25] it is is all that is have to do with the
[29:27] influences of this world of course and
[29:29] the prince of the power of the ear
[29:31] behind all these technology and
[29:33] everything else but it's trying to
[29:34] influence our minds
[29:36] see so therefore this is to bring us
[29:39] back into our disciplines to a challenge
[29:43] people easier talk about the negative
[29:44] than the positives i think is somebody
[29:47] was sharing something with me
[29:48] uh tonight as i read it
[29:50] einstein i think somebody sent it
[29:53] einstein um was doing some or doing some
[29:56] problems
[29:58] maybe i'm not seeing it right but this
[30:00] is just of it and he's getting
[30:01] everything right first sec second third
[30:04] fourth fifth
[30:05] the tenth
[30:06] question
[30:08] he gave a wrong answer
[30:10] and the whole class came down on him
[30:13] and
[30:14] he said look at that
[30:16] i did from one to nine i'm just part of
[30:19] reason correctly and because i did one
[30:23] wrong you'll get down on me
[30:26] you don't value the right that i've done
[30:29] but you highlight the wrong and this is
[30:31] where this is
[30:33] human this is what we do it is easier to
[30:35] talk about somebody's faults and
[30:37] feelings and to talk about the successes
[30:39] and
[30:40] their
[30:41] uh pure objective and motive and they
[30:44] may have flopped along the way in trying
[30:46] to do something for the kingdom or
[30:48] trying to do the best that they can and
[30:49] they collapse along the way or they
[30:51] stumble along the way and we focus on
[30:53] this fumble and we talk on the stumble
[30:56] and so on like that and that becomes the
[30:57] news that becomes the focus
[30:59] but paul
[31:00] was talking about whatsoever things are
[31:02] lovely what whatsoever things are true
[31:04] whatever things are honest whatsoever
[31:06] things how do we get to discipline
[31:08] ourselves to think on these things as
[31:11] opposed to the the
[31:13] vast volume of negatives and concreting
[31:16] that's come our way
[31:18] because you see if we do these things if
[31:20] we choose choose now to meditate on
[31:23] these things and think on these things
[31:25] then we are more likely to watch going
[31:28] in the direction of practicing these
[31:30] things and applying these things
[31:32] so this is it has to start with the
[31:35] discipline of the mind and that is where
[31:37] we get that thought from renewing
[31:39] of your mind
[31:41] not just hearing but have an interest
[31:44] now i remember
[31:45] i remember
[31:47] uh
[31:47] i have an interest to cook i wanted to
[31:49] cook because i i had a desire to cook
[31:52] food one day for my wife and i
[31:55] went to work all these years didn't get
[31:57] the chance to i had to return i said how
[31:59] you do that how do you do that no
[32:01] i don't know what might have been going
[32:03] through her mind
[32:05] while i was asking those questions
[32:07] but i had an interest to learn and the
[32:10] only way that i could learn is to ask
[32:13] questions and find them now if you're a
[32:16] person who is embarrassed to ask
[32:17] questions well i am very sorry for you
[32:20] you have a problem getting the
[32:22] information you will take longer to
[32:24] learn not that you want to learn it just
[32:25] take a longer way but in order to learn
[32:28] you have to find out you have to get the
[32:30] information you have to know so i would
[32:32] ask how do you do that why you mix that
[32:34] why you put that inside of there why you
[32:36] choose to sprinkle that why you add that
[32:38] and so and i'm going to that way because
[32:40] i know that when i get dear i will have
[32:43] to do it
[32:44] and do it well so the other day i did
[32:46] something i cooked something and i said
[32:48] i said this isn't very good this system
[32:50] just as if you make it and she smiled
[32:53] and um
[32:54] when she tasted it it was ceasing just
[32:56] as good and i felt good about it i felt
[32:59] great about it because i did it well i
[33:02] wanted to do well and to me
[33:04] this is
[33:05] an interest
[33:07] and you have to have an interest you
[33:09] come like i say your wife talking to you
[33:10] or husband talking to you are you on
[33:12] your phone yes
[33:13] you're not listening you are not showing
[33:15] any interest you have to have an
[33:18] interest in what the person is saying so
[33:20] many persons irritated or irritable and
[33:23] and you're not trying to cool them down
[33:25] or soften that irritable ability you
[33:27] identify it by not paying attention by
[33:30] not listening and sometimes we hearing
[33:33] the word coming and we saying you know
[33:35] are you ready
[33:39] but you are hearing but are you
[33:41] listening are you meditating
[33:43] but i could often see to meditate is not
[33:46] to read to meditate is not to listen and
[33:49] it makes it it's
[33:51] just soak in let it digest like since i
[33:54] got this thought i would have not have
[33:56] gotten before me it is ringing in my
[33:58] spirit it is ringing in my eye no other
[34:00] gods no other gods no one of god you
[34:02] know god you see in female form over
[34:04] there you're seeing this out there
[34:05] that's out there no other gods no other
[34:07] gods no other gods nothing must come
[34:09] between you and the real god this is the
[34:12] word of the lord no other gods and this
[34:14] how meditation is thinking about it why
[34:17] would god emphasize that why would god
[34:20] address idolatry because idolatry
[34:22] replaces him he who pleases us he who
[34:25] put us on the earth who call us on our
[34:27] dinners this is what he does and he is
[34:29] offended by it he say i'm a jealous god
[34:32] don't come
[34:37] he don't want that in other words don't
[34:39] put nothing between you and god go put
[34:41] your wife there some people put their
[34:43] children there some people live their
[34:44] lives with their children or their
[34:46] children achieve they feel they achieve
[34:48] and whatever it is some people put the
[34:49] card here the house chair the money
[34:51] there the bank account there they they
[34:53] position there they see you they they
[34:56] whatever post they have the balls
[34:57] whatever it is they put that deal but
[35:00] and they put money there whatever but
[35:02] god said don't do that
[35:03] seek first the kingdom
[35:05] so therefore this word
[35:08] this word to meditate is a serious thing
[35:11] because this takes you beyond reading
[35:14] this take you where you need time how
[35:16] could you meditate in front of a
[35:17] television you can't how do you meditate
[35:19] in your thesis in front of you and cell
[35:21] phone you can't how do you meditate on
[35:23] your face in the newspaper you can't how
[35:26] do you meditate and you're talking long
[35:29] long long talking wasting time with
[35:31] somebody who
[35:32] it doesn't really support your vision
[35:34] and everything else
[35:36] you need
[35:37] time
[35:38] to meditate it meditate and that time
[35:42] is quite time it's time
[35:44] for him to whisper time for him to speak
[35:47] times him to talk to your heart and your
[35:49] spirit and the devil's job is to
[35:50] sidetrack you and take up your attention
[35:53] and drive you almost crazy with
[35:56] information and and emails and disk
[35:59] popping and that popping
[36:01] and and and i i don't i i don't mean to
[36:03] offend anybody in that sense but you see
[36:05] all the forwards people forwarding yeah
[36:07] i watch them forwards and do don't be
[36:10] one of them people being used just
[36:11] forward forwards because you're feeling
[36:13] forward-ish but but you have to
[36:14] understand what you're doing because a
[36:16] lot of these things are distraction it
[36:18] sounds good
[36:19] it's okay and everything else but
[36:22] how much you are caught up in it
[36:24] is is a whole difference so therefore
[36:27] so therefore the to me without
[36:30] renewal of the mind
[36:32] how can you really
[36:34] get that change
[36:37] the bible talk about you must be born
[36:38] again of the word
[36:40] and of the spirit
[36:42] not just born again of the spirit but of
[36:44] the word
[36:46] and of the spirit the word is the
[36:47] conductor of the spirit so the word have
[36:50] to be laid inside the tear that the
[36:52] spirit could do effective work or
[36:55] you could say it this way the word is a
[36:57] seed and the spirit is water so if you
[36:59] want to get
[37:01] uh to change your crop
[37:03] let's say for instance you have pickles
[37:05] and you have torns and you have briars
[37:07] and everything else and you take a hole
[37:10] and you clean this out
[37:11] you want to change what is on your land
[37:14] then you have to put in seed and get
[37:16] water to water the seed and then you get
[37:18] a different crop all together so that is
[37:20] like your mind we are born in sin
[37:23] we iniquity we have a lot of briars and
[37:24] torns and bad behavior and enmity and
[37:27] jealousy and all these sort of stuff
[37:29] and that is what is growing in our
[37:31] system and here it is we get a word you
[37:33] don't have to be like that come and
[37:35] you'll get washed by the washing of the
[37:36] water of the wood come and you'll get
[37:38] cleansed and then afterwards you get
[37:40] seeds now and the mystery of god coming
[37:42] as the word of god and jews sees into
[37:44] you and as the seed begin to get into
[37:47] you then the spirit begin to deal with
[37:50] those seeds and bless the seeds inside
[37:51] your heart then you suddenly begin to
[37:53] grow and then as you grow all these fall
[37:56] off new leaves grow out and then you
[37:58] find yourself changing from the inside
[38:00] out because something supernatural is
[38:03] happening on the inside so after a while
[38:06] and paul if i can find it paul talk
[38:08] about are following me let me see if i
[38:10] get it here okay
[38:12] here it is finally my brethren quotes
[38:14] are we read whatsoever things are true
[38:16] whatever things are honest whatever
[38:17] things are just whatever things are pure
[38:20] whatever things are lovely or something
[38:21] that's a good report if they believe you
[38:24] if the abilities present any things but
[38:25] this part this night
[38:27] those things which you have both learn
[38:31] one and receive to
[38:34] and heard
[38:36] and seen in me
[38:38] do
[38:40] and the god of peace be with you
[38:42] in other words you said practice what
[38:44] you have learned this is the amplifier
[38:46] that's in scripture and receive and
[38:48] heard and seen in me and model your way
[38:51] of living on it and the god of peace of
[38:54] untroubled understood well-being be with
[38:56] you so in other words mimic me
[38:59] mimic what you have heard mimic what you
[39:01] read mimic act like do like repeat like
[39:05] what you are hearing don't just hear it
[39:08] and leave it no
[39:10] act like do like repeat like mimic it
[39:13] and praise god what you see in me do so
[39:16] i think this is a very powerful
[39:17] scripture those things which you have
[39:19] would learn and receive and heard
[39:22] and it's interesting
[39:24] not just how it is pleased but how it is
[39:26] written you have to hear it
[39:28] you have to learn it
[39:30] you have to receive it learn
[39:32] receive
[39:33] heard
[39:34] singing in me do you have to see an
[39:37] example
[39:38] so that is how we get where we go and
[39:40] that's how you come into your own like
[39:43] we say cricket or football or something
[39:44] there's always somebody that you have to
[39:46] train with
[39:47] there's a um
[39:49] always really coach or whatever it is
[39:51] and then they make you watch pictures of
[39:54] footballers or cricket or whatever it is
[39:56] whatever sport and then you watch how
[39:58] they do it and then you do it like them
[40:00] and it's like you're mimicking and
[40:02] you're doing strokes like them and so on
[40:03] like that or
[40:04] kicking the ball like them and
[40:06] afterwards you come into your own form
[40:08] but you start copying you start acting
[40:11] like you start doing like and then you
[40:14] get into your own rhythm your own beat
[40:16] your own authenticity praise the lord so
[40:19] trust tonight that this will help you
[40:21] praise the name of the lord psalms 46
[40:23] stink on these things this one says
[40:26] god is our refuge and strength
[40:29] a very present hell controller remember
[40:31] brother branham got that scripture
[40:34] god is our refugee strength
[40:37] a very present help to trouble you're
[40:39] thinking on these things
[40:41] therefore will not be fear
[40:43] do the earth be removed
[40:45] and do the mountains be carried in the
[40:47] midst of the sea
[40:49] do the waters thereof roar
[40:52] and be troubled
[40:53] and though the mountains shake with the
[40:55] swelling thereof sinner
[40:57] my
[40:58] so in other words by meditating on the
[41:00] goodness of god
[41:02] the grace of god
[41:04] the mercies of god you could trust god
[41:07] in difficult times in hard times and
[41:10] when you go and tell them go to your
[41:11] gods when they go that you choose when
[41:13] deliver you in your time of tribulation
[41:15] because this is what i'm to israel
[41:17] whenever pressure gets so hot and heavy
[41:20] they cried out to the lord and god
[41:21] delivered them god had enough that he
[41:23] said he said i'm not even part of you i
[41:25] will not deliver you i will leave you in
[41:26] your condition because you choose to
[41:29] watch the other gods
[41:30] tonight
[41:32] i trust that you're gonna reboot i trust
[41:34] you get a renewal i get you know i re a
[41:37] first start with the love of god in your
[41:39] soul but about
[41:40] it's too bad
[41:42] that the church doesn't walk in the
[41:43] spirit like more than we do
[41:45] for it was that kind of time when god
[41:47] comes to you
[41:48] it was on the road to emmaus when
[41:50] cleopas and his friend was speaking and
[41:52] talking and thinking about jesus
[41:55] that he walked out of the bushes by the
[41:56] side of them
[41:58] and walked with him
[42:00] it is while we are thinking upon you
[42:03] the trouble with the world today we are
[42:05] thinking about everything else but him
[42:08] and this is
[42:10] a big problem
[42:11] then he says
[42:13] we wonder why we don't get blessed
[42:16] it was a few weeks ago about three weeks
[42:18] ago when i sat down
[42:20] some sycamore trees i was telling you
[42:22] i begin to think it was dear
[42:25] for the first time he came and declared
[42:27] a new ministry to
[42:29] think on him
[42:30] jonah unto me
[42:32] i'll join i unto you saith the lord
[42:34] think upon him
[42:35] david spoke he was write his
[42:37] commandments upon the back post medicine
[42:39] on him day and night
[42:41] that's what the church ought to do but
[42:43] keep your hearts tuned in with god day
[42:45] and night and in den is when he appears
[42:48] solomon said as the man taken in his
[42:50] heart so as he begin to think that
[42:52] you're one of his children
[42:54] that he saved you
[42:56] that he is good to you and you love him
[42:58] and he loves you don't just wait till
[43:00] you go to church or some convenient hour
[43:04] just keep him on your mind
[43:07] all the time let me repeat that you say
[43:09] begin to think you want of his children
[43:12] that he saves you
[43:13] that he is good to you and you love him
[43:15] and he loves you
[43:17] many times we act as secretary israel
[43:18] okay god did not work for us god did not
[43:22] call us or did not press us we are angry
[43:24] we upset because we don't get what we
[43:26] think we should get at this point in
[43:28] time
[43:28] when you look back historically when you
[43:30] look back in your life you recognize
[43:32] that this grace has brought you all
[43:34] these years
[43:35] and if his grace brought you and kept
[43:36] you all these years he could keep you
[43:38] further so continue trusting him but
[43:41] but to you who believe
[43:42] he said oh god do you know that you've
[43:45] got something in you
[43:46] that is the call into the deep if all
[43:49] the deep you've got have been satisfied
[43:51] then stay where you are
[43:52] but for me and my house
[43:54] for me there is something more than what
[43:56] we have seen
[43:58] there's a land beyond the river
[43:59] somewhere
[44:00] there's still a deep corner to the deep
[44:02] i cannot be satisfied with theology
[44:04] i cannot be satisfied with the good
[44:06] church i cannot be satisfied with a good
[44:08] campaign i cannot be satisfied with
[44:10] hearing service there is something
[44:12] beyond that calling
[44:14] so just let them alone don't argue with
[44:16] them you're going to another line
[44:18] and this is it friends when you
[44:20] recognize that you are going to the land
[44:22] beyond the river
[44:24] you're going to a better place
[44:26] you'd rather go on first and carry on
[44:27] with anybody
[44:28] god said i give esau this mountain don't
[44:31] touch him i've got something different
[44:34] for you cross over amen
[44:37] that's my desire brethren to see my
[44:40] church cross over into another land
[44:43] i desire to move over to the other side
[44:46] if there is something in you first call
[44:48] in there'll be something to respond to
[44:49] that call just settling down to reason
[44:51] sheep isn't good enough for you go into
[44:53] some sort of business not enough for you
[44:55] just to join church put your name on the
[44:57] book is not enough for you because there
[44:59] is something called
[45:00] across the rich yonder across the next
[45:03] ridge all across jordan until you fall
[45:05] in the arms of god a deep call into the
[45:09] deep did you notice
[45:10] when joshua started to cross jordan here
[45:12] we go so is monkey
[45:15] leave brother
[45:17] leave them alone alone because god gave
[45:19] them what they are
[45:21] their portion is before your portion
[45:25] you're the cross jordan
[45:26] you say when joshua started to cross
[45:29] jordan how joshua remembered his
[45:31] commission let not this book of the law
[45:34] my word depart out of your mouth
[45:38] question
[45:39] how come
[45:41] you could believe
[45:43] nice things of people philosophers and
[45:47] and people talking all kind of thing are
[45:48] you not like just on the word that came
[45:51] out that does hear the lord about 20th
[45:53] century prophets in this last day
[45:55] how come
[45:56] all these word of these politicians and
[45:58] philosophers and and all these crazy
[46:01] prophets you have nowadays
[46:03] saying what is saying
[46:04] yes part of it might be right i don't
[46:06] know
[46:07] but i'm seeing
[46:08] what
[46:10] should not depart out of your mouth is
[46:12] this book
[46:13] because the mighty angel the one with
[46:15] the swept back wings the one with the
[46:17] seventh field the one that came out
[46:19] version 10 he came along with this book
[46:21] open
[46:22] this is why we have this revealed word
[46:25] this is why he said the spirit the
[46:27] prophet and the pride will say the same
[46:29] thing
[46:30] we are not here to preach our own
[46:31] message we're not here to preach our own
[46:33] thoughts and ideas and share what we
[46:34] think and what we feel and what we dream
[46:36] we are here to present the words from
[46:39] the angel
[46:40] we can't get it because the word of lord
[46:42] comes to our prophet so god stick a
[46:44] prophet upon the malachi 4 behold i said
[46:46] elijah the prophet he bring the angel to
[46:49] that prophet give him the message
[46:50] because the word comes to the prophet
[46:52] and then the prophet gave it to bride on
[46:54] books and tapes version 10 11 the voice
[46:57] said go and take the book and eat the
[47:00] book and prophesy again
[47:02] and the reason right now we still into
[47:04] prophecy is because it a lot of stuff
[47:07] has not yet been fulfilled so we have to
[47:10] still meditate on the word day and night
[47:14] and if we are doing that then from our
[47:16] mouths will come the word because that
[47:18] is what we are meditating on in other
[47:19] words joshua i don't care what the tribe
[47:21] say
[47:23] what all the clues you see stay with
[47:24] this world for them though shall make
[47:27] that way prosperous
[47:29] no matter how many big things they do
[47:31] how many little things they do how many
[47:34] organizations it means tea with the word
[47:35] joshua stay with the word
[47:38] this word shall not depart out of your
[47:41] mouth so he's reading the scripture only
[47:43] be those strong and very courageous that
[47:46] don may observe to do
[47:49] according to all the law which moses my
[47:53] servant has commanded thee
[47:55] to not from it from the left hand or the
[47:58] right hand to the left in other words do
[48:00] a certain thing do it i don't care what
[48:02] the organization says
[48:04] do it anyhow that's the joshua
[48:07] that god has written for
[48:09] till not one inch one eyeopener stay
[48:12] right with the wood to the nutrient from
[48:13] the right to the left the dominance
[48:16] prospect so watch things
[48:18] even though god is saying joshua take
[48:21] the people over and everything else and
[48:23] i wondered you are with moses that is
[48:27] the bold print
[48:30] as i wanted moses i'll be with you i
[48:32] will not fail you that is the big print
[48:35] you see the fine print
[48:37] the fine print is don't let that book
[48:38] leave you know
[48:40] don't think i take that thought out to
[48:42] your heart or forsake that book and
[48:45] meditate on that book day and night so
[48:48] always
[48:49] there is the fine print
[48:51] to the bold print
[48:53] and the fine print is
[48:55] equal and important to enforce the ball
[48:57] print so the ball print on which you
[49:00] replace your project yours all that song
[49:03] and great
[49:04] but then what about this part
[49:06] the book of the lord shall not depart
[49:08] from thy mouth but also match it in the
[49:10] dna to turn from the right or to the
[49:12] left that don't mess prosper so you say
[49:14] you think you're prospering when you're
[49:16] building big churches
[49:18] getting ten thousand added to your
[49:19] denomination
[49:20] he said that's not prosperity god don't
[49:23] take you one step closer to the promise
[49:25] what we need
[49:27] need
[49:28] is more of god more of the holy ghost
[49:31] repeat that again
[49:32] what we need
[49:34] is more of god
[49:37] more of
[49:39] the holy ghost the dharma is prosper
[49:41] wherever you go
[49:42] this book of the law shall not be passed
[49:44] out of thy mouth but also merit it
[49:47] during day and night in other words you
[49:49] will speak it
[49:50] you'll be meditating on it you'll be
[49:52] thinking on it and it will unfold and
[49:54] come out through you
[49:55] when you are thinking on doing something
[49:58] you are are you taking god's word for it
[50:01] are you finding your desire in the world
[50:04] are you preaching what which is in the
[50:05] bible
[50:06] just like me today
[50:08] preaching for doctrines the commandments
[50:10] of men and said read
[50:12] this book of the law shall not depart
[50:15] out of thy hand or thy mouth
[50:18] he said i'm out what are you saying just
[50:20] don't read it and walk away speak it
[50:24] live it
[50:25] teach it
[50:27] but those shall meditate during day and
[50:29] night the dome is observed to do
[50:32] according to all that is written therein
[50:35] you see what joshua of this day is going
[50:37] to be
[50:38] you see what a joshua the church
[50:40] spiritual is going to be is the same
[50:42] kind of joshua they had into its natural
[50:45] church spiritual has got to be
[50:48] the same thing
[50:50] then he quotes psalms 42 as the heart
[50:52] planted
[50:53] after the water broke so pointed my soul
[50:55] after the o god
[50:57] my soul truth
[50:59] for god
[51:01] for the living god
[51:03] when shall i come and appear before god
[51:05] my tears have been my meat
[51:07] day and night while they continuously
[51:10] unto me where is thy god
[51:12] i think david
[51:14] in the writing of this psalm must have
[51:16] been in distress
[51:17] so are you in distress you're not alone
[51:20] david was in distress it usually takes
[51:22] distress to bring the best out of a man
[51:26] really
[51:27] when god gets down to where we fast many
[51:29] times to get ourselves in position to
[51:32] get ourselves out of the way and i think
[51:34] when david got in these places then he
[51:36] began to meditate on the lord begin to
[51:37] think about the things
[51:40] and many times god get us in tight
[51:42] corners where we have to look up
[51:44] sometimes we even have to get on our
[51:46] back in the hospital bed sometimes
[51:48] somewhere we can look up to see
[51:50] where the great blessings of god come
[51:52] from and that message was he's speaking
[51:54] about
[51:55] truth
[51:57] so we live in a world today where we are
[51:59] being bombarded
[52:01] by
[52:02] messages images
[52:05] world
[52:07] views full vision
[52:10] disorder
[52:11] that are conflicting with
[52:14] biblical scriptures biblical principles
[52:19] and by the isaac so masterfully brought
[52:22] out
[52:23] on the message with the unchanging
[52:24] god-changing world changing people
[52:27] he's talking about in school and i
[52:28] always hear the expression
[52:30] the only change is
[52:32] the only constant is change
[52:35] and that's not true
[52:36] the only constant really is god
[52:39] so you know the modernist
[52:42] and this secular
[52:44] system and world and what they see and
[52:47] and philosophize is trying to make a
[52:50] non-effective scriptures on the bible
[52:52] the power of the word
[52:54] so christians
[52:56] that rub up so much and christians have
[52:58] to talk to effect what do you have out
[52:59] here look what the scriptures say
[53:01] and we have to reject those things
[53:05] that does not draw us closer to god
[53:08] whatever
[53:09] sin or words
[53:11] consider
[53:12] the scripture we read of philippians and
[53:15] that chapter 8 4 8 whatever things are
[53:18] lovely pure good report
[53:20] so if whatever you're reading
[53:23] listen
[53:24] watch it
[53:25] does not bring you closer to god
[53:29] it does not pass this philippians 4 test
[53:34] it does not pass it
[53:35] so you can't continue reading that
[53:38] listening to that
[53:39] looking at that
[53:41] you can't continue doing that
[53:44] because it has to pass this litmus test
[53:47] it has to pass through philippians
[53:50] 4 8
[53:52] whatever things are true
[53:54] today
[53:55] a lot of things are not true
[53:57] i have seen people they spreading things
[54:00] on the internet spreading things and
[54:01] sharing things only to come and
[54:02] recognize is false
[54:05] is false it's not true
[54:08] it's not confirmed but they're excited
[54:11] to share
[54:12] information
[54:13] without verification
[54:16] but the thing about the word
[54:18] god word is true
[54:21] he can't lie so whatever he promised
[54:23] whatever he speaks it has to come to
[54:26] pass
[54:27] so we have the assurance that is his
[54:29] truth
[54:30] so therefore
[54:31] this is something that we could use as a
[54:35] template
[54:36] to evaluate
[54:37] what we are consuming
[54:39] by way of
[54:40] media
[54:42] whatever digital media or physical media
[54:44] whatever means your tv or
[54:46] facebook or whatsapp or whatever
[54:48] whatever whatever
[54:50] access of the question what i am
[54:52] listening to
[54:53] what i am reading
[54:55] what am i looking at
[54:57] what am i studying what am i meditating
[54:59] on
[55:00] is it bringing me closer to god
[55:02] or further away from god
[55:05] this is what we have to ask ourselves
[55:07] psalms 9 94
[55:10] this is deep
[55:11] oh lord god
[55:13] to whom vengeance tensions belonging oh
[55:16] god to conventions vengeance belongs
[55:20] lift up thyself thou judge of the earth
[55:23] render a reward to the proud lord how
[55:26] long shall the wicked how long shall the
[55:28] wicked triumph
[55:30] how long shall they utter and speak
[55:32] hard things and all the workers of
[55:35] iniquity boast themselves
[55:37] they break in pieces like the lord an
[55:40] afflicted heritage they slay the widow
[55:43] and the stranger and murder the
[55:44] fatherless
[55:46] yet they say the lord shall not see
[55:48] neither shall god of jacob regard it
[55:51] understand he brutish among the people
[55:53] and he fools when will he be wise
[55:56] he that planted the ear shall he not
[55:58] hear
[56:00] he that formed the eye shall he not see
[56:03] he that chasteneth the heathen shall not
[56:05] correct he that teacheth man knowledge
[56:08] shall not he know
[56:10] the lord
[56:11] knoweth the thoughts of man
[56:14] that they are vanity blessed is the man
[56:17] whom though jesus oh lord and teaches
[56:21] him out of thy law
[56:23] that thomas gave him rest
[56:25] from the deeds of adversity until the
[56:28] pit be digged for the wicked
[56:30] for the lord will not cast off his
[56:32] people
[56:33] neither will he forsake his inheritance
[56:36] but the judgment shall return unto the
[56:38] righteous and all the upright and the
[56:40] heart shall follow it who will rise up
[56:41] like for me against the evildoers who
[56:44] will stand up for me against the workers
[56:46] of iniquity
[56:47] unless the lord had been my help my soul
[56:51] had almost dwell in silence when i said
[56:54] my foot slipped
[56:55] thy mercy o lord help me up
[56:58] and the margins of my thoughts within me
[57:01] i comfort
[57:02] delight my soul what is that
[57:05] what is sound sounds like before
[57:07] sometimes you must go and read it over
[57:10] made it on that side and then he
[57:11] amplified
[57:13] i want to just go down quickly he said
[57:15] lord how long shall the wicked
[57:17] how long shall the wicked triumph and
[57:19] exalt the poor arrogant words speaking
[57:22] heart things
[57:23] all the evildoers both love me they
[57:26] crush your people lord afflict your
[57:28] heritage display the widow the transient
[57:31] stranger and murder the unprotected
[57:32] orphan they say the lord does not see
[57:35] neither does the lord of jacob notice it
[57:37] consider and understand you stupid ones
[57:39] among the people and you self-confident
[57:41] fools when will you become wise he who
[57:44] planted the ear shall he not hear
[57:47] he will form the eye shall he not see he
[57:49] who disciplines and instructs the
[57:51] nations shall he not punish
[57:54] he who teaches man knowledge
[57:58] the lord know the thoughts of man that
[58:00] they are vain empty and futile only a
[58:02] breath
[58:03] blessed happy fortunate to be envied is
[58:06] the man whom you discipline and instruct
[58:09] o lord and teach out of your law
[58:12] that you may give him power yes
[58:15] that you may give him
[58:16] power
[58:18] to keep himself calm
[58:21] in the days of adversity
[58:23] until the inevitable pit of corruption
[58:26] is dug for the wicked for the lord will
[58:28] not cast or from spurn his people
[58:31] neither will he abandon his heritage for
[58:33] justice will return to the
[58:35] uncompromisingly righteous and all the
[58:37] upright in heart shall follow it when i
[58:40] said my fault is threaten your mercy and
[58:43] loving kindness oh lord held me up who
[58:46] has been keeping you all these years
[58:48] who have been holding you up all praise
[58:50] the name of the lord
[58:52] and whom you're scared
[58:53] psalm 63
[58:56] leave it
[58:57] oh god
[58:58] the word my god
[59:01] only will i seek thee
[59:03] my soul
[59:05] twisted for thee
[59:06] my flesh longing for thee
[59:09] in a dry and tasty land where no water
[59:11] is
[59:12] this farm here
[59:14] is an expression of a man
[59:16] who is cut off from
[59:20] worry stuff
[59:22] his soul
[59:23] is after god
[59:25] he is hungering after righteousness
[59:28] if
[59:29] god can help us tonight to understand
[59:32] that
[59:33] he put a twist
[59:35] in your soul
[59:36] you may not be experiencing it now
[59:38] because it's covered up
[59:40] a lot of stuff
[59:42] is on top of there
[59:44] hurts
[59:45] beans
[59:47] self
[59:48] past
[59:49] conscience
[59:50] failures
[59:52] trap smears
[59:54] and it's all there like
[59:56] wrappings over you and you're trying to
[59:57] claw your wheel
[1:00:00] but it is there
[1:00:02] the tooth for god is there
[1:00:05] you know i remember
[1:00:07] early experiences with the lord
[1:00:11] in love and tell stream of my sister and
[1:00:13] they had some empty houses up there
[1:00:15] and i used to go and pray
[1:00:17] in them seeking the lord
[1:00:20] and one of the songs isis peace again
[1:00:22] over and over let the beauty of jesus be
[1:00:24] seen in me
[1:00:25] all his wonderful passions and purity oh
[1:00:28] thou spirit divine
[1:00:30] all my nature refined till the beauty of
[1:00:33] jesus deceiving me
[1:00:35] it is a song that i couldn't get away
[1:00:36] from
[1:00:38] it was like a israelite
[1:00:40] like an antenna let the beauty of jesus
[1:00:43] be seeing me
[1:00:44] i was hungry
[1:00:46] i was thirsting for god i couldn't
[1:00:48] explain that to anyone
[1:00:51] and you may tie it into the first love
[1:00:53] holy love whatever for the lord
[1:00:55] anything like that
[1:00:57] but there was something genuine about it
[1:01:00] something striving about it i remember
[1:01:03] experiencing john johnson
[1:01:04] technical institute where i was studying
[1:01:07] and um i said testify about the lord i
[1:01:10] had a d
[1:01:11] i want a crowd a guy come out and boy
[1:01:14] look at you i believe in a false prophet
[1:01:16] and whatnot and i'm trying to talk to
[1:01:17] him and say something and i started
[1:01:19] stutter and the woods
[1:01:20] just can't couldn't come with my mouth
[1:01:34] and it was quite embarrassing to a point
[1:01:38] but yet i felt good because i felt that
[1:01:41] i still have a heart for the lord i love
[1:01:43] the lord i want to put this to him
[1:01:45] and even though
[1:01:47] it was
[1:01:48] a kind of discouraging thing that i
[1:01:50] couldn't
[1:01:50] stand up and say because i just was
[1:01:52] stuttering i just we just couldn't come
[1:01:54] out it just just didn't come up
[1:01:56] but
[1:01:57] i still believe god said no i still
[1:01:59] believe you i still trust you set up
[1:02:00] confidence
[1:02:01] and sometimes
[1:02:03] god sends you some embarrassing
[1:02:04] situations people laugh at you mock you
[1:02:07] scuff you
[1:02:08] but you are his son
[1:02:10] you're one of the stars you're his
[1:02:12] daughter it doesn't change your status
[1:02:15] yeah
[1:02:16] they may mock for a while
[1:02:18] but
[1:02:19] you as a son or the child of god will
[1:02:21] come true
[1:02:22] that's why i want to encourage you
[1:02:24] tonight don't just
[1:02:25] hear it
[1:02:27] make a conscience a conscious attempt
[1:02:31] to meditate
[1:02:32] to think on these things it's an active
[1:02:35] thing to change
[1:02:37] your mind you can
[1:02:39] you know
[1:02:41] the bible being a eastern book
[1:02:45] marriages were arranged
[1:02:47] and
[1:02:48] you
[1:02:49] you know it's amazing how
[1:02:51] these marriages that were arranged
[1:02:54] many of them most of them last very well
[1:02:58] because the marriages were based on
[1:03:00] certain principles of operation
[1:03:02] the wife
[1:03:04] the sister
[1:03:05] they knew what they had to do in terms
[1:03:07] of how they were brought up and raised
[1:03:10] when rebecca saw isaac was the first
[1:03:12] time she see any man she went she's
[1:03:14] going to get married
[1:03:15] a man she never met
[1:03:17] a man she only had a report of
[1:03:20] and
[1:03:21] is interested
[1:03:22] because in so doing in making this
[1:03:25] arrangement
[1:03:26] the wife or the woman
[1:03:28] learn to love her husband
[1:03:30] she grows to love her husband
[1:03:33] these days
[1:03:34] people could talk for long engage for
[1:03:36] long you know everything long long long
[1:03:39] stilting break
[1:03:41] but
[1:03:42] that those times was the operation was
[1:03:44] the principles behind it and the
[1:03:46] principles brought the correct guidance
[1:03:49] the bible talk about let the older 50
[1:03:52] younger ones have to love their husbands
[1:03:54] and and give you examples about fear and
[1:03:56] whatnot that wasn't an issue about um
[1:03:59] women's rights and all them kind of
[1:04:01] attitudes and so on it wasn't an
[1:04:03] attitude like that at all it was a
[1:04:04] matter of the husband and place right in
[1:04:07] place the children come and fall in line
[1:04:09] and then they understood that they
[1:04:12] belong to a special class of people
[1:04:14] where they're on a lineage that has that
[1:04:16] is covenanted that is blessed and they
[1:04:19] belong to the seed of the righteous it
[1:04:21] was a kind of understanding that they
[1:04:23] belong to that generation and that seed
[1:04:25] of the righteous and you have to begin
[1:04:27] to see yourself exactly like that the
[1:04:30] serpent seed is on the earth there's a
[1:04:31] wickedness there's evil all them
[1:04:33] planting these sodomites everybody who
[1:04:36] has to come into the position they get
[1:04:37] into this position and so the bride too
[1:04:39] would have to come into her position so
[1:04:42] david talked about as the heart pant
[1:04:43] after the water book my shoulders could
[1:04:45] you see that tonight is your soul
[1:04:47] twisting or are you waiting for this to
[1:04:50] over to go and watch a movie are you
[1:04:51] waiting for this over to go and read
[1:04:53] some novel or some kind of book or
[1:04:54] something so you know and you'll forget
[1:04:56] hey i was in submission right here i
[1:04:58] hear all these pictures like you see
[1:05:00] some words
[1:05:01] it can't be like that friends
[1:05:04] god deserves you
[1:05:06] your mind your body your soul you can't
[1:05:09] wait for this to overcome god do your
[1:05:11] own thing you have to wait for this to
[1:05:12] over to say lord change me
[1:05:14] change my thinking renew my mind
[1:05:16] transform my life
[1:05:18] i want to think on these things
[1:05:20] think on these things let us be the
[1:05:22] meditation of your soul in your heart as
[1:05:24] i told you since i preached that the
[1:05:26] wednesday night has been bringing no
[1:05:28] other gods no other gods you could make
[1:05:30] anything you god
[1:05:31] you can make fool your god and all
[1:05:34] think about it now you know it was not
[1:05:36] god for his food first
[1:05:38] serious and you need food because you're
[1:05:40] a human being
[1:05:41] but you could make anything your god
[1:05:43] but he wants to be
[1:05:45] your lord tonight so let's see how we
[1:05:48] could just his eye
[1:05:51] he said what
[1:05:53] oh god that was my god only will i seek
[1:05:56] me
[1:05:57] my soul
[1:05:59] twisted for thee
[1:06:00] my flesh
[1:06:02] longed for thee in a dry and tasty land
[1:06:05] where i know what it is this is so
[1:06:06] descriptive you could see it with david
[1:06:08] say
[1:06:09] a tasty lamb in the water to see thy
[1:06:12] power
[1:06:13] and thy glory
[1:06:14] so as i have seen thee in the century
[1:06:18] because thy loving kindness is better
[1:06:19] than life
[1:06:20] my lips shall praise thee thus will i
[1:06:22] bless you while i live i will lift up my
[1:06:25] hands in thy name
[1:06:26] my soul shall be satisfied as with
[1:06:28] marrow and fatness my mouth shall crazy
[1:06:31] the joyful lips when i remember
[1:06:34] here we go now
[1:06:35] this is david
[1:06:37] this is not hollywood on his bed when i
[1:06:39] remember thee upon my bed
[1:06:43] i meditate on thee
[1:06:45] in the night watches
[1:06:48] okay
[1:06:49] so we we like to see david a man after
[1:06:51] god's own heart
[1:06:53] but here is this man after god's own
[1:06:55] heart you could see why he's distant
[1:06:59] you could see why you could compare it
[1:07:01] in like my flesh longest within a dry
[1:07:03] and tasty land where no water is you
[1:07:05] mean your real tasty your desperate
[1:07:09] he said when i remember thee upon my
[1:07:11] dead
[1:07:12] i meditated on thee
[1:07:14] in the night watches
[1:07:16] because
[1:07:18] thou has been my help
[1:07:20] therefore in the shadow of thy wings
[1:07:22] will i rejoice
[1:07:24] my soul follow it hard after thee my
[1:07:27] right hand upholded me
[1:07:30] but those that seek my soul to destroy
[1:07:32] shall go down in the lower parts of the
[1:07:34] earth they shall fall by the sword there
[1:07:37] shall be a portion of foxes but the king
[1:07:40] shall rejoice in god
[1:07:42] everyone that spirit by him shall glory
[1:07:45] but the amount of them that speak lies
[1:07:47] shall be stopped
[1:07:50] so paul
[1:07:52] by seeing think on these things
[1:07:54] was trying to get the people the
[1:07:56] believers
[1:07:57] to refocus
[1:07:59] and to understand
[1:08:01] that instead of filling your minds with
[1:08:03] etc
[1:08:05] things that carries no value
[1:08:08] like i find myself
[1:08:10] in watching
[1:08:12] news sometimes
[1:08:13] you know you getting an information
[1:08:15] person and i recognize this has no value
[1:08:17] to me i don't forget to read it
[1:08:19] you should see me spin newspapers
[1:08:22] you wouldn't believe there's news
[1:08:24] anybody doesn't
[1:08:25] because once it doesn't connect with
[1:08:27] anything i just flip the page put the
[1:08:28] page flip the page will be paid in no
[1:08:30] time at all people are done
[1:08:32] because it doesn't carry the weight
[1:08:35] i have no interest enough are so much
[1:08:38] things that i've already none nada
[1:08:40] nothing i'm not interested
[1:08:45] so paul was
[1:08:47] trying to say
[1:08:49] instead of worrying being anxious
[1:08:52] forget that idea
[1:08:54] whatever things are true
[1:08:58] whatsoever things are genuine
[1:09:01] watch the word things are authentic
[1:09:03] what people like we call them they like
[1:09:06] the negative they like the flare that
[1:09:09] goes with
[1:09:10] you you hear that you yeah you
[1:09:12] you you hear that and
[1:09:15] god lord you talk about this information
[1:09:17] i wouldn't go into any detail whatever
[1:09:20] is
[1:09:21] true
[1:09:23] whatever is
[1:09:24] lovely
[1:09:26] whatsoever is pure
[1:09:28] perfect
[1:09:29] chased
[1:09:31] uncontaminated
[1:09:33] think about pure as uncontaminated
[1:09:37] not you know
[1:09:38] it could be
[1:09:41] 60
[1:09:43] right 40 wrong you know
[1:09:46] you cannot mix up no whatsoever is pure
[1:09:50] whatsoever is a good report
[1:09:52] good report not bad
[1:09:55] you know
[1:09:56] you know
[1:09:57] you're on the heat
[1:10:00] no if they benefit you
[1:10:04] if there be any praise
[1:10:07] think
[1:10:08] on these things
[1:10:11] friends
[1:10:13] what we think about
[1:10:16] what we meditate on
[1:10:19] have a greater effect on our lives that
[1:10:21] we think
[1:10:26] some time ago my grandson
[1:10:28] upset my knee have a park
[1:10:30] and he was in the park walking around
[1:10:32] and you know running in different things
[1:10:34] two little small guys just like himself
[1:10:36] maybe six six years old one sixth and
[1:10:39] then one five or four
[1:10:41] then park two
[1:10:43] never saw them before they came at their
[1:10:44] dialogue granddad
[1:10:46] and i see him talking to them so when he
[1:10:48] came
[1:10:50] i said what did you tell them
[1:10:52] he said to me i told them that my name
[1:10:55] is samuel david ovid
[1:10:57] say okay
[1:10:59] but you could see
[1:11:01] even at that age
[1:11:03] he has this confidence
[1:11:06] that he actually introduced himself now
[1:11:09] he wasn't taught to do that
[1:11:11] but he did that
[1:11:12] because he's aware of who he is
[1:11:15] and he's confident
[1:11:17] of who he is
[1:11:19] and i was amazed
[1:11:21] and i look at these things sometimes i
[1:11:24] see the confidence in the children
[1:11:26] you see adults
[1:11:28] without confidence
[1:11:31] adults that don't have that
[1:11:33] confident look
[1:11:35] that
[1:11:37] as the psychologist might say that
[1:11:39] quality of self-esteem
[1:11:42] we call a healthy self-esteem
[1:11:45] and
[1:11:46] you know
[1:11:47] when somebody has a
[1:11:49] healthy self-esteem
[1:11:52] they have no problem complimenting other
[1:11:54] people
[1:11:55] you see when people can't compliment
[1:11:56] people
[1:11:58] guys are signed up it's not issues and
[1:12:00] we know them we have seen them within
[1:12:02] church the people who cannot compliment
[1:12:04] they will receive compliments but they
[1:12:06] can't get
[1:12:07] and that speaks of a lot of things
[1:12:09] hidden under there
[1:12:10] sometimes it has nvidia without jealousy
[1:12:15] when you are comfortable
[1:12:17] with you as god has made you as god has
[1:12:21] blessed you you have no problem
[1:12:24] praising people and making people
[1:12:26] feeling good actually but abandon says a
[1:12:29] great man make other people feel great
[1:12:32] do you make other people feel great
[1:12:35] or do you find yourself trying to be
[1:12:37] little smallify i know that's not a word
[1:12:40] and um
[1:12:41] trying to shrink people like i tell
[1:12:43] people trying to hold somebody kind of
[1:12:45] doesn't make your light shine brighter
[1:12:47] yeah
[1:12:49] and it causes a whole fuss
[1:12:51] because you you really don't want that
[1:12:53] person light to shine
[1:12:55] and you should be happy for somebody
[1:12:57] light to shine you should be happy for
[1:13:00] somebody to be blessed because another
[1:13:01] person blessed that they could serve the
[1:13:03] lord in a blessed way
[1:13:04] the devil god gave him blessing for it
[1:13:06] not faith backside
[1:13:08] i know her brother say if i only get
[1:13:10] that car we'll call her go save the lord
[1:13:12] i'll be there i'll be taking service
[1:13:13] when you get the car back fighting the
[1:13:14] beach or everywhere else you see why
[1:13:16] didn't he call along him from himself
[1:13:19] so many people think that when they get
[1:13:20] this they do god better you could serve
[1:13:23] god right where you are how you are with
[1:13:25] what you have
[1:13:26] he doesn't need things he needs heart
[1:13:30] he needs you
[1:13:32] renew your mind
[1:13:34] but you have to actually make a
[1:13:36] deliberate attempt
[1:13:38] to do that
[1:13:39] because it is not automatic
[1:13:42] understand this
[1:13:43] if you are
[1:13:44] and i'm sure there are people here
[1:13:46] tonight that are negative beasts they
[1:13:49] will see the glass half empty than half
[1:13:51] full
[1:13:52] they are negative based
[1:13:54] it is not easy for you to come from
[1:13:56] negative b to positive business
[1:13:58] you have to make a deliberate choice no
[1:14:00] i'm not going to speak that i hear this
[1:14:02] with that person negative i'm not going
[1:14:04] to go there
[1:14:05] you have to make a deliberate attempt to
[1:14:07] adjust
[1:14:08] your thinking
[1:14:10] you have to get a renewal of mine
[1:14:12] and then it will come out your mouth and
[1:14:14] you choose not to speak negative
[1:14:17] can i tell brothers and ministers a lot
[1:14:19] of stuff among ministers i wanted to
[1:14:20] bring to the church
[1:14:23] i don't want it
[1:14:24] i see men through things in the church i
[1:14:26] the people know this and i know that and
[1:14:28] there's a lot of things that they they
[1:14:30] figure they have they speak to the choir
[1:14:32] they already supported the people so
[1:14:33] they can tell them anything but they
[1:14:34] point about it
[1:14:36] everybody doesn't possess them the same
[1:14:37] way
[1:14:39] the former president of america when he
[1:14:40] talked and he talked he's saying his
[1:14:42] things an ex-man half crack he ate a
[1:14:45] certain way and feel like to do certain
[1:14:47] things
[1:14:48] and he said but i didn't tell him do
[1:14:49] that he didn't say that but they hear
[1:14:51] that
[1:14:52] they hearing things they say he say
[1:14:56] so everybody doesn't possess things the
[1:14:58] same way
[1:15:00] so we can't just lose and that's why
[1:15:02] jesus even said be careful
[1:15:05] how you hear
[1:15:08] because what you hear have an effect
[1:15:10] upon what you meditate on your heart
[1:15:14] so when somebody speaks something
[1:15:15] negative about another person let's say
[1:15:17] it's a lie
[1:15:18] and you receive that until you say stop
[1:15:21] pull your verification for that
[1:15:23] you have two or three witnesses you're a
[1:15:24] recipient right you're telling them okay
[1:15:27] you know what i hear okay before you
[1:15:29] speak holy just hold it holy gently
[1:15:32] what you're about to say about that
[1:15:34] person is it very fine
[1:15:37] well
[1:15:38] sheila tell me
[1:15:40] no no is that two witnesses behind that
[1:15:43] because you see if you tell me something
[1:15:45] that is not true you will cause me to
[1:15:47] spread something that is not true and i
[1:15:49] don't want to do that
[1:15:50] so before you comment your stories get
[1:15:52] it verified
[1:15:54] you see what i'm talking about now
[1:15:56] so things that we hear have an effect
[1:15:59] upon what we meditate have an effect
[1:16:02] upon what we speak have an effect about
[1:16:04] that
[1:16:05] that's why sometimes somebody have a
[1:16:06] issue with somebody
[1:16:08] and they bring it and they put it on the
[1:16:09] family
[1:16:10] next minute the whole family have an
[1:16:13] issue with another family
[1:16:16] it's not fair
[1:16:17] it's not right
[1:16:19] when it's just an issue between two
[1:16:21] people that could have been sorted out
[1:16:23] don't be guilty of doing that
[1:16:26] don't be guilty of running and spreading
[1:16:28] false stories and stories because you
[1:16:29] hear it you see it back
[1:16:32] it's a choice we have
[1:16:34] it's always a choice
[1:16:36] you as a free agent of god give them a
[1:16:39] choice
[1:16:41] to live to believe to receive the act
[1:16:44] and i like to hold jesus over it you see
[1:16:47] a blind man
[1:16:48] when he came up to the blind man he go
[1:16:50] ask a blind man what
[1:16:52] do you want me to do for you
[1:16:56] and you know it sounds almost illogical
[1:16:59] because you could say
[1:17:00] the man is blind jesus supposed to know
[1:17:02] the man wants sight but that's not true
[1:17:05] we don't know the man wanted cyborg
[1:17:07] suppose he man jesus lord i want a
[1:17:09] million dollars
[1:17:13] i want this i wonder you don't know what
[1:17:14] any man had so jesus gives the
[1:17:17] opportunity
[1:17:18] for the man to express
[1:17:20] what he has in his heart
[1:17:23] if god
[1:17:24] is to come down tonight let's be close
[1:17:28] and ask you what is it that you want me
[1:17:30] to do for you
[1:17:33] what will your answer be
[1:17:36] let us bow ahead
[1:17:39] almighty god i
[1:17:42] thank you to be here tonight it's such a
[1:17:43] privilege and an honor
[1:17:46] to speak to your children
[1:17:48] and i'm trusting lord and hoping that
[1:17:51] the few words spoken here tonight will
[1:17:53] help
[1:17:55] transform their minds
[1:17:57] i presented the thought to renew their
[1:17:59] mind think on these things
[1:18:01] i will not bring in foreign things or
[1:18:03] strange things strange fire or strange
[1:18:06] gods or strange words things you already
[1:18:08] know
[1:18:10] i trust you all that you fire them up
[1:18:13] to rethink
[1:18:14] their thoughts
[1:18:16] and what they think on
[1:18:19] when they look at a brother or sister
[1:18:21] what
[1:18:22] are the thoughts that they hear
[1:18:25] it is so easy to fix people into box
[1:18:28] boxes and fix them into a concrete as if
[1:18:30] they can't change
[1:18:32] but that's not true
[1:18:34] people can change
[1:18:36] but it has to start somewhere
[1:18:38] and you talk about in your world be
[1:18:40] transformed
[1:18:42] by the renewing of your mind
[1:18:45] it has to start somewhere
[1:18:47] a thought
[1:18:49] and a word
[1:18:50] and a manifestation lord may not thought
[1:18:53] that tonight
[1:18:54] that i can meditate on whatever is true
[1:18:57] whatsoever is lovely
[1:18:59] whatever is pure
[1:19:01] whatsoever is noble honest
[1:19:04] whatsoever is a good report and to think
[1:19:06] on these things you give us words that
[1:19:08] we could think on
[1:19:10] meditate on
[1:19:12] take a pause a seller and wait on your
[1:19:14] father bless them tonight i appreciate
[1:19:16] they coming out and listening and i
[1:19:19] trust that it wouldn't fall to the
[1:19:20] ground but with stirring hearts like

[1:19:26] lives granted father bless the common
