means go to church wait wait wait that's not display when something unexplained I reckon see it is on display it's unveiled the rod is taken off of it the sheet that was covering it come to the unveiling that's what a display is is the put in a prominent place where could be seen it's just a put on show it is the put on view it is the present it is to unveil it is the state of public entertainment season event isn't that right it's also electronic device for visual presentation of data or images as when God put you on display and not with touch and the speaker also be touched Oh

you so just stop pretending you're not a chicken you could fly chickens can't fly they can flap very high but they can't fine but Eagles can now if you don't understand your eagle you could fly and flip like chicken but when you begin to get the understanding that you will overcome because you were born for that what put you here to give the devil a run for his money the only reason why you are here there is something inside of you not outside of you it has to be an inside of the display and the computer is reflecting what is operating on the inside then the screen only showing you what moving be behind the scenes and when the bride's support on display it will only reflect what is happening behind the scenes this break everybody talked in this morning everybody preaching this morning we're not talking about that but we're not talking about acts we're talking about the word being made manifest but mom read a scripture from Deuteronomy chapter 16 observe the month of added keep the Passover a month out of the Lord I got brought out of Egypt by night though shall therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God of the flux from the herd in the place where God has chosen to place his name there where I'm gonna teach that God will meet mane anyw anywhere he always choose the place he's the boss we can't choose the pace a lot meet me here yes no he choose the place I went to choose the base I'll meet you there he wanna meet you there so God choose the place and in that place I will put my name there and you know who his name is right his name is Jesus so he I will choose the place of my worship I'll put my name in it and that's the only place that God would ever meet anybody was by his own choosing isn't that right Deuteronomy mean two Lord's law of debt and the law of life to follow him and serve Him and worship Him his life to reject it is dead you could sit on your jacket and the dead in service come here every sunny and still dead stone there they had collected all yet their Pony box here about much spiritual you know what you did so you have to fight that spiritual debt that demon that will make and knock praise God that is the danger that demon that you wish passes the angel that angel to be more sealed that is among getting again another same thing so God the one that caught don't need that he's the object of worship submission when you begin to worship you create the atmosphere wrong you my friends are bricks when delivered you have to get back the damage of the slap you up and tuck up and keep it on hold it boy hold it boy he didn't get that up here he wanted and worship like my cousin wouldn't get that up there he's jealous he is we said none for him no worship in hell he don't deserve that be as I give God the glory and then given what the worship degrees in the atmosphere in that measure you walk off the field deliver praise God [Applause] I remember crippled woman king of the world man on the platform and he was doing praying for one and healing this one healing this one eye when she came up she just had him the crutches and brother the platform he didn't have to pray you not to speak she just hand them though the crutches are broke what the platform that's when you fear that the whole I'm the lord thy god of healing [Applause] maybe season P covenants rains God God made two covenants it's not right a second covenant to give a brown one he gave Adam one if you do this as good acts I don't feel give Abraham and tell him untidy have I've already given already done it that's the greased covenant if God choose a place it behooves us to find that pleased to find out what about it where it is I want to find it because I want to rule pushing him and the name was placed in a man not a church when he had to sit this is it the other come here neo K you know he's a lying spirit behind that at that cute spirit this is the man of the hour is that right I totally grew city man Rio and then one by one day maybe I woke up on poop because water put blood on them yeah sure if I claim to be manly over what will it pull up man you are gone then you're lost man of the or but what you'll meet the connect with is the core of the now he's got no our border minute God he's gone outside your time zone he's caught outside law stealing your sicknesses boot abused by the breath of his nostrils he open up the Red Sea you know how a tsunami the Scot is that the quick underground the it and it flip up the whole sea light level and the sea have to run with this power and force it cast up until it release itself and that wave of water is like a body of water bill up and just loose and see what everything around that's what we talking about and by the breath of his nostrils we hope up the sea that are we talking about work the center tsunami under whatever he wants what is God this morning and I love it and I'm gonna serve it I'm gonna do the best that I can I am running oh come on you young man go for the kingdom of God for the kingdom the losses here yeah you get the other side you don't know white horse and he'll go getting it as egg you do plant garden you're getting the other side too we have a talk you might make it you never know Oh hallelujah praise God my but this is not the only world so we just passing through I know some of you have to be nice to me because you see you're looking to stay but you have to prepare to leave praise God something you only preparing to stay but you have to understand in your preparation and living you have to prepare to leave because we have to leave hallelujah some living in the rapture some leave into the grave and some leave into the deck in the tribulation period but you have to leave anyhow Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah you take praise and honor jumping he's leaving he still feels oh you think President Putin things he'll even you think all and premise anyone in a thinking that they thinking no I'm in power and the only see in short distance I'm poor forever but you don't understand is God put them there I went all right to pull the plug he pulled it over for them you're gonna cut them off here and cut them off there so I know what ok the devil after you did ever doing this devil you nut but if God want he could just cut it off but it's the part that you have to play to apply his word to apply that blood so here we go God choose to meet man not in a church not in a denomination not in a creeper tin Christ that's the only place that God meets a man and he can worship God is in Christ no matter if you are Methodist Catholic protester whatever you might be there's only one place that you can correctly worship God as in Christ and it gives descriptive elements each one there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit because data the after the flesh cannot please God so you are challenged to walk in the spirit so if you walk in the spirit the other reader writings you have to listen to the right things you have to look at the right things you have to get the right friends and the right environment because you want to walk in the spirit you have to fight what is trying to pull you down to the flesh because you were born in sin to have a natural magnetism to what this world so the spirit come to give you a higher law to bring you above the world system and once you break through to get above the world system you recognize you are power to walk you hell and not be touched by hell yeah or give the Lord some praise this people a [Applause] man called me little long ago in boomin Texas a mr. Brannon this is if your name is not an oil change book you cannot go to him that's a pool the first man that's a big one that's not like Saban sake would you ever think of that don't you believe such a thing as that do you think you have to belong to that certain group or you cannot go to heaven that's wrong listen it is to believe that is Antichrist and I will say this if you believe such a spirit you are lost even wrong deeper that's a good thing you are lost because it's taken away from what God said God never put his name in any Church do you get it now so anybody said yeah yeah no here [Applause] no we call it all right dog yeah say it out loud liars Jesus let every man will be alive I will be true all right all right so we get known as something now so he put it in his son Christ Jesus when he and his son became one that's a genuine place of worship no other foundation was laid not a rock the lamb was a type of Christ for Shadrach Christ because he was the Lamb of God John introduces that takes away the sin of the world we find Jesus coming at the view XS the 12th chapter and he's breaking it down now and switching it back to strip each other really notice it is the only place that could not strike when death was about to strike the land they had to be a certain place all from under this died only one place it didn't mean it was one house but it was one place that's where the lamb was killed where the lamb blood was that that angel could not strike because it was the one place that God put his name and that lamb was named back there a lamb it was in one place he could not strike and no today is the same there is one place that spiritual death cannot strike and that's the word that can strike the word because it's the Living Word of God get rest right every interpretation every man's idea every false prophecy every false prophet but death cannot strike the Word of God that's right the bride becomes the word what you want to know is if it's a word or not you don't want to know what this one doing or that one doing you want to know what is the world what does the word said what about my attitude what does the word say I want you in the world the devil can watch for the Yap touch you have to get permission to do anything with you oh give the Lord some praises do you understand that we have confidence in God who is the word who wants to meet you become the word and I say receive the world you become the word and as a receiver when you receive the anointing with the word the world after tough was verse then the anointing come behind the word if you receive this well this morning we will receive the anointing that is behind the word think about that the word is of this God [Applause] notice the decision was not forbidden to strike Egypt's great intellectual people it wasn't forbidden to strike the secret lands its grease building these Pharaohs the priests of the land the engine was not forbidden to strike it was like any building any place anybody but it could not strike where the lamb was where that blood was applied strike wherever's feet on virtual where there is knowledge and temperance where it stations and coordinates where the blood of the lamb is printed upon a people when I see the blood I'm gonna pass over you it has to be a flag hallelujah you have to be operational for this display of the token because you have to see something not when your mother see not when your wife see when I see when God you have to see something you're not here to impress the pasta nothing P enter impress people you're here to see the will of God and the program of God or glory think about it thinking what you have young children tell you what idiot angel mousses bring this announcement think about the fear hidden the camp do you know what you have to go and get this round think about where and talk about a priests say you know what I asked you to get Islam I am a long-standing priests he died Joshua died some people have all kind of cuckoo attitudes and trainer is so disrespectful that's why some things were jumping because I'm not gonna that disrespect I'm gonna fight it with all I got go bring a designer here because smokey oh is that disrespectful please country that's right so when Moses give that instructions it's a fighter priests whoever it doesn't matter who that was not Moses instructions that was court gave Moses words because Moses got back this is your family oh no no family no family take the blood apply it I don't care you're just painted white the day before is Moses come and said take blood dick and splash it up opposed doorpost put it because everybody fanatic look like that blood on it all the laughing let angelicum yet but the blood is on display [Applause] dynamics that come yet because when dynamics come they're coming onshore [Music] everybody I know it's dynamic spring on every seed that's inside your system so be careful be careful that you're not hearing you think a hearing for my money here on board be careful that cannot strike where this provided place of God is that is in the lam church what a brown speaker wherever you are what you belong to makes me no difference but one thing you must know you must be in Christ or you're dead in the Old Testament was dead to go in now is dead to steal you have to be in presence I would have money house and home and job and and the street to get you out of the atmosphere out of the atmosphere that's what it ever was he's shamming you to shake your the atmosphere but if you could hold steady maintain the atmosphere the devil laughter regroup and rethink and restructure guys hope to try to get you on track because once again all the atmosphere you will say things and do things outside the program of God but if you stay that's why David said I have the right of the Lord the right hand rose before me I shall not be moved keep the Lord in his thoughts keep the Lord in his thinking keep him right before you and they're gonna go right because you want to follow the leading of the Lord and that's why I said all tied together with humility you have to be able to humble yourself yes some people don't like to be corrected you like to be spoken to yes some people don't accept blame for nothing they will never hear these words I accept responsibility for this know me then who who stole the cookie from the cookie jar and always somebody else my friends we have to come to terms with who we are who we are because Jesus learnt look like I would not learnt obedience by the things he suffered but he humbled himself and became obedient Oh glory to God you have to humble himself to put himself in subjection to the Word of God this is the problem there are people who are what you call free thinkers because they could read and listen to what the prophecies they figure they have a free thought of opinion of whole thing's supposed to be what is supposedly said and taught they are free thinkers now the free thinkers is derailment when the woman cut the cord when you put the pattern on the Word of God the free thinkers is the remnant of that same code the wise virgins is the elective that is cut according to the program of God or do you hear me this morning don't be a free thinker same court that's right scrap and the karate woman is dropping in wrong makalah's cutlet kadai is not a dress it's faster the court but it's not the elected part that she goes so up and seal the job that's not that bad June the bride is the path cut off everything she appointed loses her going on do that is that right did you consult God did you ask the Lord and you're going down the road going down the road and there's some you brought under some donkey something to show you off or something like that because you didn't consult to God but to elect he will cut off what is not like him Oh glory to God I said cut off you ever get caught yet oh my I like this hairstyle yes you like that hairstyle I'm not saying no but I have got me yes that or that Egyptian he has done way again inspiration from well I season a magazine who rated a Christian right now magazine make original or some sudden I tried a magazine but behind themselves who really be ended up copying themselves but you're spinning pages looking at these stats for what why I guess I'm in special gotta get your own style with your long dress along here the right kind of atmosphere that you look like a Christian won't people take pictures are you you want to make a magazine yourself you want to be noticed there people do so much thing for attention there is something inside of them crying look at me look at me green here sticking also yellow here speaker also I see you then what there is something empty that makes them to these things there is something empty but when you get satisfaction guaranteed inside your spool you not impress anybody because you know who you are and you know who you are you have to look like nobody because you recognize you out regional there is nobody else like you you don't want to be like nobody else you want to be what video so relax you call me a little intuition tonight Moses born Abby said some time ago Prince an Jews and Prince William's that know much Prince is that right now when they were born they don't know these princes that to be priests of internet environment shrink somebody tell them your real father is a king and you father father father and tell me history and tingman day and hell is another minute area but having learned this stuff somebody

because they figured they might have produce it money make the promise just a behold I send the promise of my father upon you I would preach it because the promise in God's Word that you have to receive God's Spirit in your life it wasn't born with it sorry you are not it you have to receive it you have to receive another spirit of Spirit of God that was just died he died that he could release the spirit to God up the sons in the last days you are only here because the spirit found you did you get that [Applause] understand this you gotta be a nice Catholic beast upon your mother be

you claim but what God does true you will speak out louder than anything you could claim [Applause] I similes exclaim so much things alight here right here right here this the Auckland included but I said what God does true you will speak louder than anything you could claim because next Pacey said it will speak for itself there will be no need to boast about anything because the manifestation will be the interpretation it will not be did I explain it well I want to explain this and you don't understand this and you need to get this no we do need to get that the manifestation will be the interpretation watch he spoke in this age what would we know the believers of this age has to believe what he promised today just the same as they had commented he asked to be saved go out of Egypt to be safe they have to come into Christ to be saved now into the ark out there a enter Christ they have to come out in the Christ no to be saved now into the wood message never got around call it a wood message that he's the same yesterday today and forever his promise word you won't have to interpret it he will interpret it through you what you are doing what departments to do the church that follows him will be so much like him until the people will know there is no question where are you in the message or where they believe the word the people will know because it gonna start to ooze out of you what gonna hit the wood itself oh my hallelujah do you believe that thank you Jesus my two sons are Kenan either the beginning kin was not a communist kin was a believer get on your shockproof s no kin was a believer on a worshiper of God if God only require a believer kin was just as evil once God will be unjust if he condemned Cain for his feet in him and except evil if heat was only required alright but Cain came over the sacrifice Cain little altar which can me the sacrifice just as evil did Cain worship he never come as an unbeliever he come as a believer use of his hands worship God seem as evil did when its church membership an altar or worship my sacrifice is all about require then came adjusters righteous it was if you belong to a church go to church got a name on a church book a good tight beer worshiper sincerity that still isn't it that's alright I don't want to hit you I gotta stand before judgment with you God requires more than that and Cain was just as just on it as evil was it that's all go require you have got to get this right here before you can see it right heart have to be right before they could see it right and sometimes when you see your heart is not right he said I see things see things wrong like when one says a lot of times people completely Intuit's they can trouble it just get in fighting for the Jews and he said this wrong that from that from that from Moses I'm theorem the marchers empty wrong and they said I want more you see judges say don't get me judges find that Rome find that Rome find that room and you see this is

if you're not born is born of God you can't believe it you are quickly yet you're still trying to build a fine church put a crown on it angelic voices and thing like that that don't please God keen in the beginner would have been accepted if it was but God to Alexa hallelujah court call evil and recompense of reward evil come nothing beautiful cane you know bought the flowers and so on even got an

went on to Pentecost is not right the tentacles of people saw it a way they went right out under a pillow fight when Shelton and no I belong to the Assemblies I belong to this you're organized so tight God is moving the pillar fire I thought again I will restore restore what what was in the beginning or glory what we have to ask for that we have to demand that we have to want that what what what was in the beginning because courts and the prophets do not ask back to the faith of the fathers they had the faith in the beginning so we have the 1 pick up that faith and then tomorrow we can't go forward without work without picking up the faith and I say that signs in it that's it that that was raised that's it demons were cast off that fit the SEC was healed Oh Chloe now give the Lord a

God now if you understand that when I look to some man when you need to get revelation from God because revelation is revealing power and if you pray and ask God to reveal the word to you he's going to reveal it to you and that will give you inner strength I thought that we could take her to you right if enough Isaac Abraham five hits am son by faith chest I looked at Moses Moses grew up in this

priests playing Christian but this time coming when you going to run then then the Lord after the church people ever want to join because there will be resentment there with the power of God flowing freely there will be the spirit calling out stop Laurie doesn't move on the beam that kind of church let a scary place to the end but put around prophesy doctor where be a church with Jesus walking in it and the Shelf of the king the south of the king will be in the camp all glory to God this is more than noise tonight Old Glory knows what we under the anointing of prophecy or what we see should make a church that would make the revival I impressive enough revival who want to help me without revival I believe what the purpose said that's my absolute you want a son no but this guy help us Methodist I help us Catholic I help us penny cause I gotta look at those churches in America and they back and eternal if he is some kind of agent of God is on the library blind I mean do you understand the wheels are turning to bring on the mark of the beast system under shutdown future do you understand the give them liberty know to prove joint political groups on what that and still keep the tax free on what in America the creeping in upon the churches do you even know them I think they get them more but do you understand the green diecut hijacked our constituents and who rests on the United Nations the do you understand that here we are because of of course on a profit to bring clarity of the vision of where we headed and spiritual death nor moving in a way yes and the Bible says that the ancient men were before my house goes bless and see you only those who sigh and cry something like to strike your spirit something had to touch your heart that you can get behind a bootie dozen Lord this can't be right this is not me this is what I want and desire I want more of you on the begin to hunger and tells the world walking behind you see it and watching it every move to see if you really believe what you're hearing that Devlin outside this kyle aachen he's looking at you because we want to see if you really believe if you truly believe I think tis they'll talk about a woman she was a housewife and the man came on some friends and they joined all the drinks and trained on the pizza and I think fall on the ground I would not buy what early woman this humming nicely and sweetly and mopping up what a mess the making and everything else cleaned up and nice Christian behavior and whatnot and if I any husband telling the Christian she's a Christian know what is afterwards doing the carrying on no she felt up ruling pin on the head I said get off my house and we ever bring them in back in my home sack kill them a rascal friends they bring a what a manga see a torch she was a Christian so so so the thing about you know when the test comes on it has to bring out a display it has to bring out something that you have on the inside has to come out on the outside and going to bring the test so it comes out automatically if you have angered it it's fit so you have tempered it it comes out - it would have hurt you that it comes out it's our faith and courage it comes out enough kindness it comes at all so you have to choose to be kind you have to choose to be loving to be careful to be caring you have to choose that and and listen deny the excuses where my boss make me do this maybe I can let me do this what you deny all of that shake all that off and accept responsibility for your actions oh my could we take some more Wow yuck whoa this was

Jesus what abandom says his first beam was spirit God supernatural all right the great eternal second he began to form himself towards flesh in a t often e it's called a word it's called a buddy so a T often e is a word buddy so this eternal spirit trying to get the flesh for my buddy call the word a wit buddy isn't that right thank you Jesus then that was the state he was in when he met Abraham he was calm as Jesse dick he was in the form of a theophany after often is something you could not see it could be right here no yes you cannot see it like television which is another dimension people are moving right along to this room right now singing colors but the eye is only subject in five senses your whole being is submitted five senses television doesn't manufacture a picture a television channels it into a circuit and the television screen picks it up and the picture is yet to begin with television was here when Adam was here television was here when he Leiter was an on camera television was here when she has a Nazareth Walker shot of Galilee but your know discovering it they wouldn't have believed it back there you've been crazy to sell something like it but now it becomes a reality so he reveals himself in his great form of what he claimed as he and Morpheus himself into his sylvans and proves himself he has their morphe himself into his servants and proves himself now he is in the form of spirit and then he comes and he appeared to Abram and morphe and when Abram returned to the stall of the Kings here come mezack talk to him no we see here we go this is important right let me know we see are you ready the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into this word form body you attribute sons have not yet entered into your word buddy if this tablet can be resolved we have another body waiting for us Oh hallelujah if this fish tamatha be resolved the one in the box is not the body we don't move on already hallelujah are you at me so we see a T often in this body is subject to the wood and illness waiting for the change of the body now the difference between him and you as a son he was at the beginning the width and in Morphy buddy he came and lived in that person Melchizedek then later we never heard what matches the deck because he became Jesus Christ Myrcella was a priest and he became Jesus Christ but you bypassed that because in that form he knows all things you have never been able to know that yet you come like Adam like me you came from attribute the flesh to be tempted taught the flesh to be tempted so temptation is legitimate like the minds blown you can expect to tell God let all in half the government cross the next Rita what nephew let your street be clear you can tell go down you can tell God let us protect my sheets but only you can see the thing - yeah you wanna see nobody you wanna see no evil you wanna watch even talking ears I'm big big buffers big sue I don't wanna hear no evil Christian I want a mountain I wear long clothes and because you ain't want to see no evil you need Hill you be a Hut you playing John the Baptist you can't tell Gordon you come from taught the flesh to be tempted to be tempted so now we don't understand it we have never become the word we just become the flesh man not the word but you see in order to stand temptation you have to bypass city of Annie so we come from taught the flesh and bypass the world oh my you had to come down here in the flesh to be tempted by sin and if you stand all the father had given me will come to me I'll raise him up on the last days but a Branham says they won't shortcut to heaven hallelujah all I have to do is to get down there don't think nothin all I said Halle hallelujah there is no shortcuts you come the way of Calvary you come the way of the brass altar you come the way of the brazen serpent you die you actually die and die to yourselves die to the things of the world this is genuine Christianity friends this is the just combination of go back home until the very end and you serve any Lord no it's not that this is genuine No you want to be like Christ isn't that right there are no shortcuts say after me no shortcuts say they get no shortcuts so don't look for any let me get a lot some prison [Applause] [Music] [Applause] they wanted to come right quick they don't want to grow we grow in the Lord it takes growth and experience and my excitation in the permission or sharing with them little by little God said you want to take the land little by little people want instant they want down by the play lotto I well applause Nichols the money they want to win it big and then lose it big - but they want to win and big and rich and I hit the Mac hit the jackpot but God doesn't have jackpot Joe bought half feet future clear this land planted if you look late and planted grass Wakaba you are like God is this clean line here the clean plant clay and plant as you manage what your plant either manage what your clear then you take more land it always have more land to be taken in some of you chunks and chunks in you know eating small small small God want you to eat the whole thing it's a big meal alone those thick but they're prunes and peanut butter inside of it that is orders any mapa dies if I do that but but but I'm a small thing people you take it the meal coming it all out all on do like an appetizer fool you didn't really you coming God want you have room for that meal for that meal so there are no shortcuts it take growth and experience and just at the kingdom of God like nah man plant a seed and they'll grow you know it not how and I produce everything the air the corn and everything else but he does know it grow it draw in silence and grow with the experience you have to grow in the Lord isn't it right watch this is a Padawan I get to not he that starts is he that finishes there are no shortcuts you are disqualified at the end of the race no shortcuts oh my hallelujah some time I was readin over mom's any reason that the people looked so much to the preacher in that kind of a way is because the people don't want to surrender to God so really what they want is a priest that minister intent on their behalf that is what they want so they love the personal love this man and they're behind the man in the balcony manages God feel caught in flesh not God in them you know going in mind an evil but if you couldn't in the word what Ron said cortázar go to the audience I'm in the beginning in the early church goers among the people and they get caught from the people and put it in a man and that's how we end up a Depot do you get it now God want to be the core of the audience so then the pasta the fivefold ministry becomes channels of God to bring God to the people not for God to remain behind here no forgot to come down there but we get a lot of shout [Music] it's never God's will for man to rule man read available have power over the fish over the birds over creeping things he never say how pole another man or give the Lord some praise these people give the Lord some shouts give the Lord some praises God never said that [Music] you cannot follow all the others until the power over yourself so don't try to get Paulo only anybody do you love yourself Mac the perfect man he can drag his tongue not the perfect man he'll temperance will give the Lord some shows you know [Applause] so knowing this you think I can reach my muslin seal like I'm like Liam as well as a joke you can't do that you have to be able to humble yourself many people don't want to humble themselves yeah take the right when they did wrong humble yourself why would go up with a minister as a minister why would go up with a watchman in the tower just see what you see the enemy you can be your own private pasta the private Revelator you can t up again private inspiration yeah that's free thinkin abolition material hallelujah you have to get into leadership and guidance that my god sent gift some places to bring guidance to bring leadership by the Holy Ghost by the Holy Ghost not here at starts either finishes many start the race but has one finish it there'll be many judges start many groups of people there will be one group finish that's the overcomers isis eyeliner send me a coat dear was really a blessing to me because i had this prepared hadees and i will just take this one is that a year and it's on me same message ok i overcome now we're speaking of overcoming the would overcome of course you know what it means you've got to have some need overcome and this church age that holy ghost was speaking about here biodiesel you teach has always been true it needed a rebuking quite early outside but notice his calling as not just to the church he not overcome it not the church that would be she but is he over commit the individual that will overcome so this group is that a church group is a bunch of individuals that will be overcome and that will make up that group he commits oh praise the name of the lord are you with me all praise be to Jesus thank you Lord notice each son out of each church age overcome the temptation of that age along along with you as I said in the beginning you are born defeated and put that that bit can never bring it to life because your Pony fitted you are the in a defeated world among a defeated people among if he decrees fifty nominations you've got to come to victory somewhere that Lily presses his way through the muck and the mud and to bring an express what it has been and God by predestination has brought the seat in life and expresses itself to life isn't that right oh praise God so for the Branham let's continue I have to continue my Jesus give us the example how to do it how we know how to overcome Jesus told us how to do it humility he could himself took a towel washes at his feet the very court of heaven humiliated himself we told one to be humiliated we want to show we better than we have more than we could better than there whatever it is but God wants you to be humble Jesus humble himself and become common obedience to God to the cross we don't want to be humiliated that's a reason woman don't have to grow out the reason they dressed like ladies should it's the same thing they don't want to get humiliated greatness is expect it greatest is humility don't forget that church greatness is expect expression humility overcome means a standard test just like the old scenes did just like Jesus did I miss all the enemies he stood the test overcome means to recognize that develop every one of his tricks a real devil you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the one you recognize him I know he's a devil he's against you then overcome you must recognize that the God in you is greater and mightier he that's trying to overcome him isn't that right so you bypass your - you're funny then oh my mind my mind could we take a little more I want you to I want you to want a little more no watch oh geez you see he come home directly I thought my Jesus before the function of the world is nimble in Lombok alive then from that he become the word the theophany that could appear and disappear then they became flesh we turn back resurrected that same body in a glorified condition you bypass the opening become flesh man to be tempted by sin if this Tabernacle is dissolved Scripture we have one already Wheaton we have not yet the bodies but look when this body here we go receive this body express somebody receive the Spirit of God the immortal life inside of you it draws this body in subjection to God so here come the scripture he is born of God does not commit sin that shows your body in subjection so watch so you don't have to say oh if I could just quit drinking if if just get in Christ it's all gone because your body is subject to the spirit so the more spirit coming to you is the more time things that you shake it off the most easy to shake it off because it will Troy your body physical in subjection to the Spirit of God do you see it now hallelujah so what like you woman claiming if at all he goes and we're in shorts how could you do it how could it sprint up whatever let you do such a thing it can't be he's on a fifty spirit you the Holy Spirit when you become subject to that spirit it tours your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit you know I already that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed would mean manifest or quickened mineralize Oh hallelujah so all this bully what you're talking about is the word in you turn in the spirit the same see the receiving inside your soul [Applause] poor Eva good tax even sadder comes alive all of a sudden your new engine is all over you because the seed now is breaking out inside of you you're recognized your son of the king he had thought of the king you rocket they live under the mark of the devil no more oh my this is big now this body is something to the spirit you have not yet entered into the wood form we are still in flesh form but subject the debt debt in the flesh will take us there that will take us to that wood buddy the bright promise for the rapture is we shall not see death we will be hitting that body without debt Oh glory to God doors that are sleeping those things that are in the ground dad you often have to come and pick up those bodies redeem those bodies on bring them out in the right but the bride will get a transformation theophany will it buddy change in a moment then pick up an I have no power the blood wash one free from that hooker no more green is a victory what a child's the branding harm what with death over the grill get praises thing beer is a victory Oh blowing up corn are you free this morning hallelujah hallelujah glory does God my my my my so then when a man is born again from heaven he become a spirit live in Christ and when this rule of flesh is dropped there's a natural body at theophany not made with hands need a born of a woman that we go through and that body returns back and pick up the glorified body that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died on preacher desorden prison he turned back into the orphanage and second Corinthians 5:1 of this the only time can be dissolved listen rhetorical we have another one we have bypassed that to come straight from God the attribute to the flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam but when that testing of his word is over then we are taken up to his body that must be paired for us before the foundation of the world it is the word dear that we skipped to come write her on to be tested and tested and if we had come to that there'd be no temptation with normal things that's the reason Jesus not all things because he was the word before he become flesh then we become the word and here about here right here we are formed to the one image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you had in you from the beginning when you start the journey on yet we are being formed into the word image by what the trials the testings the temptations that immense are in a week but are sealing in that trials that's the best thing courtesan for your children trial husband trial by trial boss trial neighbor child Oh business trial or find a child and you're fighting and you're struggling praise bugger struggling a world to become a butterfly I just struggling and struggling and struggling somebody gonna break up he's gonna be transformed because that trial is what is forming you is

earth that's a covenant send back the holy spirit to live in the church to prove he seemed yesterday than forever when the Holy Spirit fell on Pentecost it produced a church and brother I don't care what he nomination you've got talk to you accept that spirit was taught or the crisis put in time and he'll be left in the other rapture so that rapture connection is connected with the spirit of price itself which is the token so he is seeing to go in the rapture you have to have his sin spirit and that same spirit must be on display you can hide it at all our experimental nobody he will pull the mask off for you this is my beloved son look at me look at me you can find this thing you can hide Christianity you can hide the blood the blood has to be applied you can hide it stop hiding understand you have to step out now come on now come on now because I have to see that but when I see the blood I'm gonna oh my so he tore my parts and holy goes on to live in us straight of Christ therefore the only kind of true spirit that can receive the word that can receive Christ wrestle number try put the spreader call upon a wolf it angered mean it won't stay there the whole spirit just flies away it won't do it if that dove a compound if it does come down instead of being lamb with a wolf summarising mother couldn't see dog let the lamb notice it let the lamb to slaughter now this is where if you don't have a humble heart you will end up in trouble because leaden have to do with leaving where you don't want to go we have all kind of things to do in the church some people might like to do this I'd like to do that but we may not want that done no see I enter in that and win that ok you're not doing that see in life we could act like way but when you are being led you have to have a heart to lead to follow where you are being led by the spirit because Jesus was led by the spirit into the wilderness nobody goes in the wilderness the wilderness do have a coke Stan you know coca-cola and Pepsi under the witness offer ice buckets with cold juice and sandwiches you know it wilderness is dry the wilderness is beer the winners have no one knowing tune in it it is desert nobody walks the car gets it up since I'm gonna die anybody talking away you know something wrong you have to be led Jesus humbled himself and became obedient Church it is very important if all what you we hear a lot of stuff today but this is checked out check ours for this today's important French was the trans important very important you have to have a humble heart for this period of God to guide you especially where you do want to go if you don't have a humble heart and his bracelet Google say hi yeah dude I understand that no it can't be led can be directed but a Branham the dog led the lamb notices leather lamb to slaughter lamb was obedient to the dog no matter where delayed he was willing to go I wonder today when God leads a life every go of compensator and service to Him I wonder if I was bridge don't repel shooing if he allows a llama is obedient a lamp is self sacrificial it doesn't claim its own it can lead oh my I think I'll stop here music on please whoo-hee I continue next week but I instead get to my text really about the blood you identify in your life by the sacrifice you make then the plan was a token or identification the blood identified that the worshiper had slain accepted alarm a pilot talking to himself he was not a shame he didn't care we saw it he wanted everybody to see it it was placed in such a position that everybody could see that too many people wants to be Christians they want to like it secretly nobody could know they're Christians he said well I want to be a Christian but I do want you also to know about it but that's not Christianity even the governor's not me think Christianity are clueless hasta display its token publicly in public lights at the office on the street when trouble is around anything in church
