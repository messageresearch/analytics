[56:35] Luther's age Wesley's age all down to
[56:38] the ages and the Pentecost of age each
[56:39] age is given a promise of the word and
[56:42] the people of that age that manifest
[56:45] that promised word is the seed of that
[56:49] age you know it's almost comical when I
[56:51] hear somebody pronounce somebody a shock
[56:53] a shock this what is shock and who shock
[56:56] but the prophet said the ones here the
[56:59] people that manifest the promised word
[57:02] is the seed of the age it it have no
[57:05] verbal manifestation sorry it doesn't
[57:08] have no people manifestation the people
[57:10] that manifest the promised word of the
[57:12] age is the seed of that age according to
[57:16] what Jesus said right here they are the
[57:18] children of the Kingdom that's right the
[57:21] manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[57:23] operating through children is those
[57:27] seeds of the kingdom of that age oh

[1:04:11] man and you know of course there was
[1:04:16] some suspicion around him especially
[1:04:19] when the the Scorpion had bit him but it
[1:04:22] it didn't break Paul all Str he just
[1:04:25] shook it into the fire you know and what
[1:04:29] I want to say by saying this is that the
[1:04:35] devil could label you you could either
[1:04:37] choose to wear that
[1:04:39] label or you could choose to shake it
[1:04:47] off and and by the grace of God you see

[1:10:32] manifesting himself amen that's the
[1:10:36] that's the Jesus that the world wants to
[1:10:38] see right so let's stand to our feet as
[1:10:41] we go straight to the word I don't want
[1:10:43] to keep you too long I had asked your
[1:10:45] pastor how long do I have and um I
[1:10:50] always have a tendency of going over my
[1:10:53] time and I don't want to do that this
[1:10:55] morning I know we uh have meals in
[1:10:59] between services and so forth so but
[1:11:02] once again I am happy to be here I want
[1:11:04] to draw your
[1:11:05] attention uh to the Book of
[1:11:08] John uh verse
[1:11:11] 15 and
[1:11:15] also uh verse 15 St John 15 verse
[1:11:21] one St John 13
[1:11:25] verse
[1:11:39] 34 are you ready amen amen you know my
[1:11:44] world my words can fail but God's word
[1:11:47] cannot fail and if we did nothing but
[1:11:50] read the scripture we would be blessed
[1:11:53] amen uh St John
[1:11:56] 15 uh I like this this this thought I
[1:11:59] just want to give you a little testimony
[1:12:01] just before I uh get into it this
[1:12:04] thought came to me while I was packing
[1:12:07] to come here you know I had I had some
[1:12:10] messages and things that I had preached
[1:12:12] and packed and the Lord had uh dropped
[1:12:15] this thought in my heart and I you know
[1:12:18] how you speak to the lord well I'm
[1:12:20] packing I had have no but he he he gave
[1:12:23] gave it to me so I know that uh the Lord
[1:12:26] will bless
[1:12:28] so the title of my message if I would
[1:12:31] before I
[1:12:33] forget I am the vine and ye are the
[1:12:37] branches and I like how God
[1:12:39] distinguishes
[1:12:41] that because no matter how much God we
[1:12:45] become or like God we will never be
[1:12:49] God I am the
[1:12:52] Vine and ye are the
[1:12:55] branches so we'll get into this here
[1:12:58] just a few minutes amen St John 5 and
[1:13:02] verse one I am the True Vine not just a
[1:13:05] Vine but the True Vine and my father is
[1:13:08] the husbandman every branch in me that
[1:13:11] beareth not fruit he taketh away and
[1:13:14] every branch that uh beareth fruit he
[1:13:17] purged it that it may bring forth more
[1:13:22] fruit so therefore don't worry about the
[1:13:25] trials and tribulations you have a few
[1:13:27] little fruits here and there God wants
[1:13:29] more fruit than he's going to purge it
[1:13:32] amen because he wants more fruit from
[1:13:34] you amen the trials of this life is more
[1:13:37] precious than gold amen and now ye are
[1:13:41] cleansed through the word which I have
[1:13:43] spoken unto you abide in me and I in you
[1:13:47] as the branch oh listen to this as a
[1:13:50] branch cannot bear fruit of it
[1:13:54] itself amen except it abide in the vine
[1:13:59] now therefore you cannot join the
[1:14:03] vine you cannot uh you have to be born
[1:14:08] into the vine amen no man uh no more can
[1:14:13] ye except ye abide in me now let's read
[1:14:16] that again as a branch cannot bear fruit
[1:14:19] of itself except it abide in the Vine
[1:14:23] no more can ye except ye abide in me I
[1:14:28] am the vine and ye are the branches he
[1:14:30] that abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:14:34] bringeth uh forth much fruit for oh
[1:14:38] listen to this for without
[1:14:41] me ye can do nothing amen amen oh I like
[1:14:48] that
[1:14:49] position without him we could do nothing
[1:14:52] amen amen we could try be a good
[1:14:55] Christian but without him we can do
[1:14:57] nothing amen amen because God this is
[1:15:00] fruit time and uh sea time bride time
[1:15:04] and I believe that we are all looking
[1:15:06] for the same thing and we're all
[1:15:08] striving for the same thing uh but we
[1:15:11] have to use God's way of doing it see
[1:15:15] Hallelujah there's no other way uh to
[1:15:17] bring forth fruit he said I am the vine
[1:15:20] ye are the branches so therefore if a
[1:15:22] man abided not in me he is cast forth as
[1:15:26] a branch and is withered and Men gather
[1:15:29] them and cast them into the fire and
[1:15:32] they are burnt if now here's the
[1:15:35] condition of this promise if ye abide in
[1:15:38] me and my words abide in you ye shall
[1:15:41] ask what you will and it shall be done
[1:15:44] unto you hearing oh my herein is my
[1:15:49] father glorified that ye bear much fruit
[1:15:53] so shall ye be my
[1:15:56] disciples amen St John Chapter
[1:16:00] 13 if we just go back two verses or two
[1:16:04] chapters rather St John Chapter 13 and
[1:16:07] verse
[1:16:13] 34 Verse 34 a new commandment I give
[1:16:16] unto you that you love one
[1:16:21] another now listen to to this next these
[1:16:24] next few words as
[1:16:28] I have loved
[1:16:32] you that ye also love one
[1:16:35] another now God's love is the highest
[1:16:39] form of love we know amen and he wants
[1:16:42] us to love one another as he also Lov
[1:16:48] us I'm not talking about ailio
[1:16:51] conditional love I'm talking about an
[1:16:53] agapo love amen amen as we are reaching
[1:16:57] and approaching that great headstone
[1:17:00] amen amen the stone of power the stone
[1:17:04] uh which the builders have rejected and
[1:17:08] refused has become The Headstone of the
[1:17:12] corner amen it's the universal
[1:17:15] Unconditional Love That Remains the Same
[1:17:17] regardless amen of circumstances and
[1:17:21] situations amen that is how he loved us
[1:17:25] am and by this shall all men know that
[1:17:29] ye are my disciples if you have love one
[1:17:32] for another amen may the Lord add a
[1:17:36] blessing to the reading of his word let
[1:17:38] us just bow our heads in a word of
[1:17:39] prayer our heavenly father we have read
[1:17:42] your word Lord Glory any man who can
[1:17:47] read English and can read this Bible can
[1:17:50] read the context of it father but Lord
[1:17:53] we ask that the author father who wrote
[1:17:56] the word Lord would come down Among Us
[1:17:59] Lord and reveal the context Lord and
[1:18:02] reveal the meaning and reveal Lord to us
[1:18:06] that which you have in store for us this
[1:18:08] morning Lord we take ourselves out of
[1:18:11] the way and father we ask that you would
[1:18:14] bless your people and may the spirit of
[1:18:16] allmighty God move from uh cheer to
[1:18:20] cheer Heart to Heart father down in the
[1:18:23] uh basement in the lower level and out
[1:18:25] in the uh uh uh The Yards father may
[1:18:29] your spirit uh be felt all over the
[1:18:32] place father for we know that there's a
[1:18:35] prophecy that went forth this in itself
[1:18:38] shall make uh come to pass the
[1:18:40] tremendous victory in love divine father
[1:18:44] so we don't seek another message we
[1:18:46] don't seek another revelation we don't
[1:18:48] seek another anything this in
[1:18:51] itself shall make make Hallelujah come
[1:18:54] to pass a tremendous victory in love
[1:18:56] divine so we're looking for the
[1:18:59] tremendous Victory father God victory
[1:19:02] over ourselves victory over uh Lord
[1:19:05] anything that would keep us from dashing
[1:19:08] into the uh presence of almighty God so
[1:19:11] we ask that you would take control of
[1:19:13] this service and we ask it in The
[1:19:14] Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ amen and
[1:19:17] amen God bless you you may be seated
[1:19:20] amen well over the years I have become a
[1:19:24] slow starter uh but I trust that God
[1:19:27] would uh kick us into another gear just
[1:19:30] shortly here I have to uh I'm not as
[1:19:34] young as I used to be as you know I I
[1:19:38] used to run the pulpit all around and I
[1:19:41] still do that from time to time but uh
[1:19:44] the point I want to make today is really
[1:19:48] uh as I said the title I am the vine and
[1:19:51] you are the branches you know the
[1:19:53] prophet
[1:19:54] said that uh God had a beautiful bride
[1:19:58] tree yes sir on the day of Pentecost
[1:20:01] amen that was a wonderful tree signs
[1:20:04] wonders and miracles was was was
[1:20:06] Vindicated you know I mean God I mean he
[1:20:09] didn't just have a church that he called
[1:20:11] the church God himself went with them
[1:20:15] everywhere working amen these signs and
[1:20:18] wonders and miracles amen and no Apostle
[1:20:22] no teacher at that time anybody who was
[1:20:25] placed uh in the body of Christ and God
[1:20:28] was using them never ever took credit
[1:20:32] for anything that God did amen so if
[1:20:35] that be the case God is looking for a
[1:20:37] group of people God is looking for a
[1:20:39] bride that will come back to a place
[1:20:42] where we can get out of the way and God
[1:20:45] can use us in a way that he used the
[1:20:48] First Apostolic church amen I I I think
[1:20:52] I just think that we just get in the way
[1:20:54] sometime amen and when we learn how to
[1:20:57] get it out of the way then God can move
[1:20:59] and do the things that he promised to do
[1:21:02] Amen brother BR said what is a gift a
[1:21:05] gift is to know how to get out of the
[1:21:07] way praise His Wonderful Name Hallelujah
[1:21:11] they were spirit filled and word
[1:21:14] fed I like that spirit filled and word
[1:21:19] fed the word of God that was in Jesus
[1:21:22] Jus Christ amen who fed them amen for
[1:21:25] three and A2 years or so in his ministry
[1:21:28] and even though they didn't understand
[1:21:31] all the things that he was speaking but
[1:21:33] yet they were fed and it went in in a
[1:21:36] form of a seed oh listen you may say I
[1:21:39] don't understand what's going on you
[1:21:41] don't have to understand you have to
[1:21:44] just believe what God is saying
[1:21:47] hallelujah he never said do you
[1:21:49] understand he said Do You
[1:21:51] Believe amen and faith in amen the right
[1:21:55] attitude towards any Divine promise of
[1:21:58] God will bring it to pass because God
[1:22:01] said so glory be to God explain that to
[1:22:05] me preacher I cannot explain it amen I
[1:22:08] just believe it because God said so
[1:22:11] there's going to be a Dynamics Revival
[1:22:13] God said so there's going to be
[1:22:15] manifestation of sons of God God said so
[1:22:19] I can't explain it praise God but I
[1:22:21] believe it because God T off glory be to
[1:22:25] God the world wants an explanation but
[1:22:27] let me tell you something I don't have
[1:22:29] an explanation but I have a faith in my
[1:22:32] heart praise God I like what the brother
[1:22:35] said one
[1:22:36] time I'm not here to wait for something
[1:22:39] to happen I'm here to make something
[1:22:42] happen glory be to God if we can get
[1:22:44] started then God can do the rest amen
[1:22:48] hallelujah
[1:22:50] amen glory be to to God she's spirit
[1:22:54] filled and word fed oh my think of it
[1:22:59] God all that God was he poured it into
[1:23:02] Christ hallelujah amen and Christ we
[1:23:04] know according to brother brandom how he
[1:23:06] spoke he said that Christ was the
[1:23:09] mystery of God
[1:23:11] revealed all that was in Christ all that
[1:23:14] was in God rather he poured it into
[1:23:16] Christ so he walked the Earth as a
[1:23:20] mystery they wanted to know who God was
[1:23:23] they had to go through Christ because he
[1:23:24] was unfolding that great mystery he came
[1:23:27] in the volume of the book Hallelujah hey
[1:23:32] glory be to God and brother Bram said he
[1:23:35] was a Mystic to the
[1:23:37] world so if he was a Mystic to the world
[1:23:41] Amen we today are all that Christ was he
[1:23:45] pours it into the
[1:23:47] church so then we are the mystery of
[1:23:50] Christ
[1:23:51] revealed and if he was a Mystic to the
[1:23:54] world so will we be Mystics to the
[1:24:01] worlden hallelujah

[1:24:08] we getting warmed up now praise God the
[1:24:11] same Spirit life that was in Jesus now

[1:24:15] baptized with the Holy Ghost on the day
[1:24:18] of
[1:24:19] Pentecost amen I don't know what your
[1:24:21] teaching is what people may be preaching

[1:24:42] laying praise God hallelujah hey you
[1:24:46] know what brother R said it was the
[1:24:48] theme of every Apostle and if you are an
[1:24:50] apostle or you claim to be an apostle

[1:25:39] that and they heard in the convention

[1:36:35] branches without
[1:36:37] Hallelujah
[1:36:39] fruit even without
[1:36:43] leaves you you know the leaves brother
[1:36:46] say it's Pentecostal clapping their

[1:36:53] the
[1:36:55] tree when he restores something he
[1:36:58] doesn't just restored up to the fruit
[1:37:00] and get rid of everything below because
[1:37:03] now we're in Fruit time that's how you
[1:37:05] hear a lot of doctrines like that oh we

[1:37:10] and they sit there dead as dead can be
[1:37:13] amen but let me tell you have you seen a
[1:37:15] tree amen that has a little fruit on the
[1:37:18] top and you can't even sit under it and

[1:37:42] life amen that was in
[1:37:45] theine hallelujah hallelujah manifest it
[1:37:51] the fruit of
[1:37:53] identification amen I'm talking about
[1:37:55] original
[1:37:57] Branch you want to know what a tree is
[1:38:01] the Bible says by their fruits you shall
[1:38:05] know so the fruit identifies the
[1:38:10] tree and the branch cannot do anything
[1:38:15] without the
[1:38:16] vine so there must be some Supernatural
[1:38:20] power pushing out pushing out pushing
[1:38:24] through the branch pushing through the
[1:38:26] branch the next thing you know hey
[1:38:27] here's a little leaf come out amen thank
[1:38:30] God for the leaf you may not have the
[1:38:32] fruit yet but thank God for the leaf
[1:38:34] here keep pushing out and there's
[1:38:36] another Leaf comes out don't worry but
[1:38:38] God Amen can will keep on pushing and
[1:38:41] keep on pushing until the fruit is made
[1:38:43] manifest and then that will identify
[1:38:47] what that tree
[1:38:50] is
[1:38:52] Hallelujah Jesus said the fruit you
[1:38:54] shall know them see the fruit identifies
[1:38:57] the life in the
[1:38:59] branch and herein is my father
[1:39:04] glorified he in other words he loves
[1:39:11] fruits when we bear much fruit he's
[1:39:15] glorified the fruit is not glorified
[1:39:19] when we bear much fruit than he is
[1:39:22] glorified Hallelujah because that's what
[1:39:24] he put the tree there for to bear fruit
[1:39:28] that he may be
[1:39:29] glorified
[1:39:31] amen and this is why I said praise God
[1:39:35] let's sing that song it's a life behind
[1:39:37] the name amen it's time that we uh Focus
[1:39:41] back in that life amen hallelujah that
[1:39:45] life that comes that is actually in the
[1:39:47] vine and ye are the branches amen the

[1:40:25] the vine and ye are the branches the
[1:40:27] branches is energized by the life of the
[1:40:32] vine

[1:40:37] now therefore Jesus had no
[1:40:42] lips tonight on Earth but

[1:40:51] so you see he needs a
[1:40:55] body he needs amen he has no hands but
[1:40:58] mine and yours and he energizes us and
[1:41:03] we bring forth his
[1:41:08] life as he brings it through us whether
[1:41:13] in preaching the gospel by lips or
[1:41:17] seeing visions by eye see whether it
[1:41:20] whatever it is laying hands on the sick
[1:41:23] remember there's an energy behind that
[1:41:26] Hallelujah whatever it is is Christ

[2:03:08] believe in staying on the positive side
[2:03:11] we are better people
[2:03:12] today for the works of of many of these
[2:03:15] brothers some will say oh we're we're
[2:03:18] worse whatever but we are better people
[2:03:19] you know why we're
[2:03:22] wiser every trial comes your way to
[2:03:25] teach us a lesson
[2:03:27] oh we know things today that we didn't

[2:03:32] ago and it can only make you stronger it
[2:03:35] can only make you more
[2:03:37] mature it can get you only closer to God
[2:03:40] Almighty amen
[2:03:42] hallelujah amen but anyway I what I was
[2:03:46] looking I just can't find it right now
[2:03:47] but what I was looking at
[2:03:49] at uh when brother brandham I often
[2:03:52] wondered in my heart when brother
[2:03:55] brandham was giving the testimony hallu
[2:03:59] of the resurrection of that little
[2:04:03] fish I want you to catch that
[2:04:06] now the resurrection of that little fish
[2:04:10] Hallelujah little fishy I give you your
[2:04:15] life I always wondered why he tied
[2:04:19] in the voices to that
[2:04:23] experience but if you read it and you
[2:04:26] could study it and you know this story
[2:04:29] is true he said that the Lord told him
[2:04:33] that there was going to be a
[2:04:36] resurrection of some creature see so now
[2:04:41] just before that
[2:04:42] happened listen brother Bram said an
[2:04:47] anointing an energy come down on the
[2:04:50] lake yes it was so powerful Hallelujah
[2:04:54] that those that were with him felt oh it
[2:04:56] is good to be here is they almost felt
[2:04:58] that they were being
[2:05:01] raptured but what did Brother Braham
[2:05:03] said he said I couldn't keep from
[2:05:07] uttering those
[2:05:11] voices and he said it wasn't me it was
[2:05:15] the uh Vine using the branches using the
[2:05:20] the Church of the Living
[2:05:24] God that anointing is here now by the
[2:05:27] grace of almighty
[2:05:29] God and that is my
[2:05:32] testimony amen everywhere I go
[2:05:35] listen I am not afraid to say seven
[2:05:39] Thunders give Faith seven Thunders is a
[2:05:41] bride's Revival because brother brandham
[2:05:44] said that and I SC cannot skirt around
[2:05:47] that praise God whatever it is it it is
[2:05:50] Gospel
[2:05:52] truth even though uh you may have your
[2:05:55] opinion about it this and that I don't
[2:05:58] care it's going to happen because it was
[2:06:01] spoken amen and it's going to be some
[2:06:05] people say well we have Revival all
[2:06:07] along amen but I'm not talking about
[2:06:09] this you wait till them Thunders utter
[2:06:11] their voices to that group that can take
[2:06:13] the word with God a and hand it there
[2:06:16] it'll slice and cut and everything else
[2:06:18] but listen you have got to have the
[2:06:20] right character before he entrusts you
[2:06:23] with that sword amen or else you'll cut
[2:06:27] the ear
[2:06:32] off I want to let you know there's
[2:06:34] nothing humanistic about what is about
[2:06:37] to take place right it's totally
[2:06:41] spiritual Peter said I'll die for you oh
[2:06:45] really amen I'll go to the death for you
[2:06:49] I believe he was
[2:06:51] honest but he lacked the power to do it
[2:06:55] Hallelujah and the only thing he had was
[2:06:57] a sword and he cut the ear off Peter put
[2:07:01] your sword away amen he that uses a
[2:07:03] sword will die by this sword amen
[2:07:07] hallelujah and even Jesus told pontious
[2:07:09] pilot if my kingdom was of this world my
[2:07:13] people would
[2:07:15] fight I want to let you know your
[2:07:18] kingdom is not of this world so don't
[2:07:21] get in a fight with people who are
[2:07:24] trying to get you in a
[2:07:28] fight love your brother love your sister
[2:07:33] amen it doesn't mean you agree with them
[2:07:35] but love them
[2:07:36] anyhow be a better person I like what
[2:07:40] the Bible says he I I love him because
[2:07:45] he
[2:07:46] first that's a big word for me he
[2:07:51] first today we say oh I'll love him
[2:07:54] if we have a whole list of things that
[2:07:57] we want people to make right what if God
[2:08:01] had a whole list on
[2:08:06] you I
[2:08:08] love
[2:08:10] him because he first loved us with what
[2:08:14] kind of love it wasn't filial amen it
[2:08:16] wasn't conditional amen amen it was a
[2:08:20] gopp love unconditional and that proves
[2:08:25] and shows that we are expressing the
[2:08:28] right character and the right Behavior
[2:08:31] we don't hate anybody we love everybody
[2:08:35] and everywhere I have gone I have pre I
[2:08:38] have had to preach what my conviction is
[2:08:40] but at the end of the day you know what
[2:08:43] one thing that shook me several months
[2:08:46] ago and to tell you something I was
[2:08:49] listening to a
[2:08:50] tape uh across the banit of
[2:08:54] time and brother Braham said beyond the
[2:08:58] curtain of time brother Bram said
[2:09:01] nothing but perfect
[2:09:05] love we we'll make it
[2:09:09] there he didn't just make that statement
[2:09:12] he said listen to me thus sayith the
[2:09:16] Lord he said because there is nothing
[2:09:19] but perfect
[2:09:21] teaching perfect
[2:09:24] Revelation so in spite of whatever it is
[2:09:27] that we believe whatever we've got to
[2:09:29] come back to that perfect
[2:09:33] loveall and that put A New Perspective
[2:09:37] in my uh understanding that's right
[2:09:43] amen the Bible says love your
[2:09:47] enemies
[2:09:49] amen it didn't say you're not going to
[2:09:51] have
[2:09:53] enemies because you have to have enemies
[2:09:56] to
[2:10:03] love not that you make them enemies but
[2:10:07] I've met some
[2:10:10] people they're predestinated to hate you
[2:10:12] that that's just about it they don't
[2:10:14] like you they're not impressed with you
[2:10:16] I mean you can do Somers Sals back flips
[2:10:18] anything else you can preach the fire of
[2:10:21] God down by the grace of God they just
[2:10:24] don't like
[2:10:28] you that's not you see and that is your
[2:10:33] trial to love him to love the
[2:10:39] unlovable when God tell me something
[2:10:42] when we were in the world and when we
[2:10:45] were not even in a position even
[2:10:48] thinking of
[2:10:51] God his mind was full of us his mindful
[2:10:55] he was mindful of us his mind was full
[2:10:59] of us and he thought and he loved us in
[2:11:01] our
[2:11:02] condition only God could do that and not
[2:11:06] only only God can do that but he's
[2:11:07] trying to teach his church too love the
[2:11:10] same
[2:11:11] way
[2:11:13] because here is I'm going to close now
[2:11:16] you uh brother are you going to uh
[2:11:19] uh you know I'm just uh I do this all
[2:11:21] the time I'm sorry somebody in the field
[2:11:24] was counting how many times I said I'm
[2:11:27] going to close out I think it was eight
[2:11:29] times or so but listen this let me get
[2:11:33] back to the scripture a new commandment
[2:11:36] I give unto you that you love one
[2:11:40] another amen
[2:11:43] as I have loved you
[2:11:52] you that ye also love one
[2:11:56] another and by
[2:11:59] this Hallelujah

[2:12:07] express by this shall all men know that
[2:12:11] ye are my disciples amen if he have uh
[2:12:15] love one for another another I'm closing
[2:12:20] with that God bless you let us remember
[2:12:22] friends we living in a strange
[2:12:25] time we're living in a time that you
[2:12:28] know there's a lot of different opinions
[2:12:31] and things like that but there is a
[2:12:32] truth as as sure as there is counterfeit
[2:12:35] as sure as there's error whatever some
[2:12:38] are uh well we have to remember to pray
[2:12:42] for one another because if it wasn't for
[2:12:44] the grace of God we too would be in a
[2:12:47] situation that we cannot so it just
[2:12:50] helped me to understand that we must
[2:12:54] love one another the fighting and all
