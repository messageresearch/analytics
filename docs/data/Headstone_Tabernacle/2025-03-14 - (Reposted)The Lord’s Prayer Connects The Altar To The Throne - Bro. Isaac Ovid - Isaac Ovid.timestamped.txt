[39:38] the church so the Believers in Germany
[39:40] on fire they are under expectation
[39:43] they're looking for God to move in a
[39:45] mighty way and I could testify that all
[39:48] over the world the spirit of God is
[39:49] moving can the church say
[39:52] Amen so and two Sundays ago I was in
[39:56] Nigeria and the Saints in in Nigeria on
[39:59] fire and they are looking for Redemption

[40:04] the same holy ghost that fell on the day
[40:06] of Pentecost to fall upon this end time

[40:26] been to every convention ition we have
[40:27] had and he went on to be with the Lord
[40:29] and I was there to be for present for
[40:32] the service and the burial I was able to
[40:34] give some words uh at the funeral
[40:36] service as well as go over to Port
[40:39] harkort where uh he was based where the
[40:42] burial was and two Sundays ago I was in

[40:49] River State so many of the churches in
[40:52] the State uh River State where Port hak

[40:59] for the Believers and they send their
[41:01] love their greetings their appreciation
[41:03] to the
[41:05] church and last week Sunday I was in
[41:08] France by Brother Jano so we had a
[41:10] wonderful time in the Lord we preached
[41:11] twice there uh in France as well so it's
[41:14] been quite a journey and we know that
[41:16] God is doing something tremendous and
[41:19] it's certainly good to be back home
[41:21] there's no place like home you know when
[41:24] I was sharing with my wife that many
[41:26] times you travel on the field and uh one
[41:29] thing and I've seen it with brother ID
[41:30] as well and maybe it's it just uh maybe
[41:34] it's what what we have been trained with
[41:36] but many times the messages that we
[41:37] preach on the fields and in conventions
[41:40] actually start right here that's you
[41:42] know the message I preached in Lagos
[41:44] some time ago about jeffa it was
[41:46] preached here when I preached about the
[41:47] continuation of the generation of Jesus
[41:49] Christ it was preached here then I
[41:50] preached in Ghana uh time no longer time
[41:53] is running out preach here then spoke
[41:55] about brother Norris church and I took
[41:57] it to Nai church and you know so many of
[42:00] the of the of the services and the
[42:01] prayers it's your prayers and your
[42:03] encouragement because we can only do so
[42:05] much as the gift of God is operated by
[42:08] the prayers and the pull of the people
[42:09] so we thank you for your commitment for
[42:11] your dedication for your labor for your
[42:13] love for being present for understanding
[42:15] your post of Duty to knowing that you
[42:17] were born for such a time as this to
[42:20] know that time is short and before we
[42:21] realize it will be out of here this
[42:23] world is finished and we are under
[42:25] expectation for God to move beyond our
[42:27] reasoning beyond our imagination you
[42:30] know and last weekend in France uh I was
[42:32] able to witness a baptism and uh it's
[42:35] quite something uh sister came for
[42:38] baptism and uh it's one of the first
[42:41] times I've seen so many friends uh I
[42:44] guess who uh from the world come to
[42:46] witness the baptism you know and you
[42:48] know it's one thing to be here from the
[42:50] Caribbean and but it's another thing to
[42:52] see this in Europe and many of those who
[42:54] came drove 5 hours to come to a baptism
[42:57] that speaks of something it speaks of it
[42:59] doesn't matter what the enemy does it
[43:01] doesn't matter how much technology it
[43:02] has it doesn't matter what the God is
[43:04] still calling sons and daughters and it
[43:07] was moving to see that they came uh I
[43:10] spoke Saturday night and Sunday morning
[43:12] but their intent and the intention was
[43:13] to be there just for the Saturday night
[43:15] service and go back home you know for
[43:17] the drive you know so I asked but Jano
[43:20] will will they be in the Sunday morning
[43:21] service he said no they plan to go back
[43:23] home but the Lord having his way the way
[43:27] the Lord moved on Saturday night Sunday
[43:28] morning we got there and they were all
[43:30] there still in the service am as like
[43:32] what happened they say well the way the
[43:34] service went last night they couldn't
[43:35] afford to go back home and we are
[43:37] looking to see God move calling
[43:40] individuals because it's an individual
[43:41] Affair God doesn't move by groups he
[43:43] moved by individuals and it doesn't
[43:44] matter if you're in Germany if you're in
[43:46] France if you're in Nigeria if you're in
[43:47] Trinidad you're in America Australia or
[43:50] you take a rocket and go to another
[43:51] planet once your name is on the book God
[43:53] is going to call you home can the Church
[43:56] Say Amen
[43:57] so everybody feeling
[43:59] fine so if you have your Bibles let's
[44:02] stand to our feet let's read two
[44:04] portions of scripture I really want to
[44:06] appreciate uh the Bible uh sorry the
[44:08] prayer meeting the exhortation on Friday
[44:10] night and the service last Wednesday if
[44:13] you did not hear that service last
[44:14] Wednesday I tell you that was a Thunder
[44:17] From Heaven so I want to salute brother
[44:19] ID I want to salute all the services
[44:22] brother Anthony what a tremendous what a
[44:24] tremendous time Amen to see how God is
[44:29] moving and connecting because it's one
[44:32] body it's one Lord It's one faith and
[44:34] it's one baptism so we're looking for
[44:36] God to speak to us this morning from his
[44:39] word so reading two portions of
[44:41] scripture we're going to read from
[44:43] Revelation 5 and we're going to read
[44:45] Matthew chapter 6 and we know that today
[44:47] is Sunday uh it is the Lord's day so we
[44:51] are here in the house of God to spend
[44:52] our time in the presence of the Lord so
[44:55] forget about your bills forget about
[44:57] about tomorrow forget about everything
[44:58] else and I want to encourage you to pay
[45:01] full attention on what God wants to say
[45:04] here this morning so reading from
[45:05] Revelation 5 and reading from verse
[45:10] one and I saw in the right hand of him
[45:12] that sat on the throne a book written
[45:14] within and on the backside sealed with
[45:16] Seven
[45:17] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[45:20] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[45:21] worthy to open the book and to lose the
[45:24] seals thereof and no man in heaven in
[45:27] Earth neither under the Earth was able
[45:28] to open the book neither to look there
[45:30] on and I wept much because no man was
[45:33] found worthy to open and to read the
[45:35] book neither to look there on and one of
[45:38] the elders saith unto me weep not Behold
[45:41] a lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[45:43] David hath prevailed to open the book
[45:46] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and
[45:48] I beheld and lo in the midst of the
[45:50] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[45:51] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[45:54] had been slain having seven horns and
[45:56] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[45:58] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[46:01] he came and took the book out of the
[46:02] right hand of him that sat upon the
[46:04] throne and when he had taken the book
[46:06] The Four beasts and the four and 20
[46:08] Elders fell down before the lamb having
[46:10] every one of them Hops and gold and vs
[46:13] full of odors which are the
[46:15] prayers prayers of the Saints and they
[46:19] sung a new song saying now arew worthy
[46:21] to take the book and to open the seals
[46:24] thereof for thou was slain and H has
[46:25] redeemed us to God by the blood out of
[46:28] every Kindred and tongue and people and
[46:30] nation and H has made us unto our God
[46:33] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[46:37] the earth and reading Matthew 6 reading
[46:40] from verse 9 a very familiar scripture
[46:44] and uh we're going to spend some time
[46:47] here relooking at this by the grace of
[46:50] God Matthew 6 verse
[46:54] 9 after this manner there therefore pray
[46:57] ye Our Father which art in heaven
[47:01] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[47:05] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[47:07] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[47:11] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[47:13] our debtors and lead us not into
[47:16] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[47:19] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[47:22] the glory forever amen may the Lord add
[47:26] a blessing to the reading of his word
[47:28] can we bow our heads for a word of
[47:29] prayer our gracious Heavenly Father any
[47:32] man could read the scriptures but it
[47:34] takes the Holy Spirit to breathe life
[47:36] upon it Lord for the few moments we have
[47:40] together on this Sunday Lord we come as
[47:42] a needy people looking for a fresh
[47:46] touch Lord looking for a word in due
[47:49] season the right word one day Lord your
[47:52] Prophet said the right words will be
[47:53] spoken and we'll Dash into the presence
[47:56] of God Lord may this be that kind of a
[47:59] day May something that be said Lord May
[48:01] something be said that Lord that will
[48:03] touch the hearts of the people in such a
[48:05] way Lord that if there's a backslider in
[48:08] our midst this morning they'll be
[48:09] restored completely if there's anyone
[48:12] sick in our midst they'll be healed
[48:14] completely if there's anyone Lord down
[48:16] or uncertain or father going through
[48:18] some struggle Lord that the word of God
[48:20] would bring peace and Clarity and
[48:22] comfort Lord Lord if there's anyone
[48:24] Desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:26] there'll be filled father Lord may you
[48:28] pour out your Holy Spirit upon your
[48:30] people and may you confirm the word with
[48:32] signs with wonders with Miracles Lord
[48:34] and may you Lord speak to us as you've
[48:36] never had before take me out of the way
[48:38] hide me behind calvary's cross father
[48:41] Lord I don't want my thought I don't
[48:43] want my idea is but father Lord you send
[48:45] us a prophet with a message Lord and the
[48:47] opening of the seals has turned the
[48:49] Bible into a new book so may you walk
[48:51] out of the pages of this book father
[48:54] Lord father through the lens of the
[48:56] revealed word so we can take comfort and
[48:58] safety to know how we're going to leave
[49:00] this place father Lord may you Lord take
[49:02] complete control in the precious name of
[49:04] Jesus Christ and the church says amen
[49:07] and amen you may be
[49:08] seated I'm under expectation for what
[49:12] God is going to do I want to take my
[49:14] time because I want to do a bit of a
[49:15] teaching some little preaching some
[49:17] little encouragement but by the grace of
[49:19] God at the end of the service I want you
[49:21] to be able to relook at the Lord's
[49:24] Prayer maybe in a way you never thought
[49:26] about it you know many things uh we look
[49:29] at in scripture uh and in the word
[49:31] become common to us you know and and
[49:34] until when Jesus came he said I I don't
[49:36] like all the Traditions you have turned
[49:39] everything into just a tradition and a
[49:41] and a ritual but there's substance in
[49:43] the word and there's things in there
[49:45] that God left and if you don't spend
[49:47] time to to look at it and investigate it
[49:49] and study it and pick it up then then
[49:51] you'll not see the magnitude of it so
[49:53] can the church say Amen so I have a
[49:56] title this morning morning The Lord's
[49:58] Prayer connects the altar to the
[50:02] throne The Lord's Prayer connects the
[50:06] altar to the
[50:08] throne so for us to even start this
[50:12] study if I could use that word this
[50:14] morning we need to go back to the very
[50:17] beginning and in the very beginning when
[50:19] God created the Sun the moon the stars
[50:22] the Earth man everything was in place we
[50:25] could clearly see that God's will was
[50:27] perfectly established on the earth God
[50:31] has a will he has a desire he has a
[50:33] purpose he has an objective he has
[50:35] something that he wants to see and when
[50:36] God had finished he could say it was
[50:39] good can we agree on this this morning
[50:41] when God looked at the work of the first
[50:44] day and the second day and the third day
[50:45] and the fourth day every single day God
[50:47] said it was good the very thought of God
[50:50] the very picture of God what God had in
[50:53] his mind had been perfectly expressed
[50:56] and God God could rest can the church
[50:58] say Amen the perfect will of God was
[51:00] established on the earth and there was
[51:02] no separation between Heaven and Earth
[51:05] that's right can the church say amen and
[51:08] I'm beginning to hint at certain things
[51:10] because in the Lord's Prayer it says
[51:12] your will on Heaven and Earth can the
[51:15] church say Amen so at the very beginning
[51:17] before man fell God's will was the same
[51:20] on Heaven and Earth because man was in
[51:22] perfect harmony with God hallelujah man
[51:25] didn't have his own will he didn't have
[51:26] his own idea about things he didn't have
[51:28] his own Ambitions about things he was in
[51:31] perfect harmony with God can the church
[51:33] say amen hallelujah God and man had full
[51:38] communion full fellowship and I want to
[51:41] add something there was no need for
[51:44] prayer Hallelujah in the Garden of Eden
[51:46] there was nothing like a prayer meeting
[51:48] brother Lyndon there was no need to
[51:49] prayer because it was perfect Fellowship
[51:52] there was perfect harmony there was
[51:54] never Adam did not pray before the fall
[51:56] oh somebody preach back to me maybe you
[51:59] never heard that before but there was no
[52:00] need for Adam to pray because he was in
[52:02] perfect fellowship with God God could
[52:05] come down in the cool of the evening and
[52:06] just have a conversation with his son
[52:09] because his son was in perfect alignment
[52:11] with his will with his purpose with his
[52:13] plan with his vision with his objective
[52:15] can the church say
[52:17] amen and our whole objective from the
[52:20] fall of Man is to get back to Eden can
[52:22] the church say Amen so prayer has to be
[52:25] a means
[52:27] to get us back because prayer wasn't
[52:28] there but God had to oh I don't want to
[52:31] get ahead of myself this morning can the
[52:33] church say
[52:34] Amen but after the fall communion was
[52:38] lost Fellowship was lost Adam went into
[52:42] hiding can the church say amen and
[52:45] prayer became necessary as a way for man
[52:48] to reach God can the church say Amen
[52:51] somebody help me preach this morning the
[52:54] Bible tells us the first time you could
[52:55] find prayer is in Genesis 4 when the
[52:58] Bible says then began men to call upon
[53:01] the name of the Lord so in Genesis 1
[53:03] Genesis 2 Genesis 3 you can't find one
[53:06] reference to prayer but at the end the
[53:09] last verse of Genesis 4 it says then men
[53:12] began to call upon the name of the Lord
[53:15] because they recognized they couldn't do
[53:16] it on their own and they needed
[53:18] something more they needed to reach
[53:20] Beyond themselves somebody help me this
[53:23] morning anybody with me in the house
[53:29] [Music]
[53:32] brother Brandon would pick this up and
[53:34] in Revelation chapter 4 we have said
[53:37] this before but the brandham said the
[53:39] only way back to Eden is by the
[53:47] altar here you go again see Back to Eden
[53:50] through the altar so the
[53:53] altar is the way back to Eden amen but
[53:57] we preach about the war of altars the
[53:59] war of priests the war of sacrifices
[54:01] some months ago when you have an altar
[54:03] altar is one part of the puzzle you have
[54:05] to bring your sacrifice to the altar the
[54:09] altar is a means to pray at the altar so
[54:12] when you come standing praying at the
[54:14] altar without if you have the altar
[54:15] without prayer there just an
[54:18] [Music]
[54:20] altar can the Church Say
[54:25] Amen H I'm building this it's a little
[54:28] encouragement so we could now relook at
[54:30] the Lord's
[54:33] Prayer so man because he is Fallen man
[54:37] because he is broken man because he has
[54:39] needs throughout all of the Bible we
[54:42] could find instances of
[54:45] prayer we see Hannah in the temple
[54:47] praying because she wants a child and
[54:50] God
[54:51] answers her prayer hallelujah hallelujah
[54:54] you could go example after the example
[54:56] he said If my people will humble
[54:58] themselves and pray seek my face turn
[55:01] from their Wicked Ways they will hear
[55:03] from heaven and I will heal their
[55:06] land prayer was a means for God to be
[55:10] activated he said I've heard the cries
[55:12] of my people and I've come down I can't
[55:16] move until you call me I can't respond
[55:18] until you call me when you start to
[55:23] pray you begin to move heaven Hallelujah
[55:26] you begin to
[55:28] activate thej Hallelujah the celestial
[55:31] realm to bring the celestial realm down
[55:33] to the terrestrial realm you begin to
[55:35] bring God to Earth because man has
[55:37] dominion over the Earth and he needs to
[55:38] be invited he said I stand at the door
[55:41] and knock If any man hear my voice and
[55:43] open it that voice is a voice of
[55:47] prayer anybody with me this
[55:50] [Music]
[55:53] morning Hall
[55:59] many scriptures Abraham prayed his
[56:02] conversation God was a pray say Lord if
[56:04] there be
[56:09] 50 Moses prayed David prayed you could
[56:12] find it all through
[56:14] scripture and these men prayed with a
[56:18] partial
[56:19] realization a partial understanding can
[56:23] the church say
[56:24] Amen but when Jesus
[56:28] came because at the highest level of
[56:30] Prayer in the Old Testament it was the
[56:32] high priest brother George who had to go
[56:34] and intercede for the
[56:37] people but when Jesus
[56:40] came the King was on the earth the king
[56:44] who was
[56:46] prophet the prophet who was Priest the
[56:49] priest who was sacrifice the sacrifice
[56:52] standing there and the disciples in Luke
[56:55] said teach
[56:57] us teach us how to
[57:00] pray it had to have been something about
[57:03] the way he prayed that attracted their
[57:09] attention can the church say
[57:15] amen
[57:18] and he gave them a structure of a prayer
[57:23] that every single believer should know
[57:26] but what does it really mean because the
[57:28] real issue is Brother George anybody in
[57:31] Christendom who claims to be Christian
[57:33] could look at the Lord's
[57:36] Prayer but what does it mean to us as
[57:39] Believers now that the seals have been
[57:42] opened because the seals being open
[57:45] means the Bible is a new book means we
[57:47] could read that prayer with the lens or
[57:50] the eyes of the fullness of the revealed
[57:53] word because if the question was asked
[57:56] ask Lord teach us how to pray and Jesus
[57:58] begins to give them a way to
[58:01] pray that would withstand time that's
[58:04] right would withstand ages would
[58:08] withstand
[58:09] situations I want to encourage you this
[58:11] morning that in that Lord's Prayer God
[58:14] dealt with all the church
[58:15] ages in the Lord's Prayer he dealt with
[58:18] the Seven Seals in the Lord's Prayer is
[58:20] the seven thunders in the Lord's Prayer
[58:23] is your inheritance in the Lord's Prayer
[58:25] is your deliver Deliverance in the
[58:27] Lord's Prayer is your
[58:32] [Applause]
[58:36] Revival The Lord's Prayer is more than
[58:38] just words in the Lord's Prayer he
[58:40] actually expresses the whole plan the
[58:43] whole Plan of Redemption for the bride
[58:44] is in the Lord's
[58:46] Prayer you remember when Peter was there
[58:48] and the Lord told Peter Peter I've
[58:50] prayed for you that your faith don't
[58:52] fail the Lord give us some ammunition
[58:55] because there's a certain prayer and
[58:56] within his prayer there's a mystery of
[58:58] this Lord's prayer that is most relevant
[59:00] to us today can the church say Amen not
[59:03] everybody could pray this Lord's Prayer
[59:05] you
[59:10] know this is not the Our Father prayer
[59:13] no it's more than that it's a weapon
[59:16] there's power in this prayer there's a
[59:19] secret in this prayer there's a mystery
[59:21] in this prayer are you ready let's
[59:25] go The Lord's Prayer a Divine
[59:30] blueprint and the Lord Prayer has a
[59:32] certain number of statements being
[59:37] made are you
[59:39] ready let's
[59:48] go but a punch shine and preach ahead of
[59:51] me
[59:58] Glory Glory Glory
[1:00:01] Glory so the Lord's Prayer starts with
[1:00:03] Our
[1:00:04] Father which art in heaven now when you
[1:00:08] look at this statement this was a very
[1:00:10] interesting statement because this is
[1:00:12] the only time where Jesus actually says
[1:00:15] our father he would many times say I am
[1:00:18] my father
[1:00:19] one my father this is the only time he
[1:00:22] brought a level of
[1:00:24] inclusion into this concept of
[1:00:27] fatherhood because it means for you to
[1:00:29] say our father you are part of this
[1:00:31] family of God of which he is the air and
[1:00:35] we become joint a So within this just
[1:00:37] simple Declaration of our father there's
[1:00:40] an acknowledgement of a mystery of
[1:00:42] adoption because it's only by the spirit
[1:00:44] of adoption we could properly cry AB
[1:00:47] father so outside of Hey Brother
[1:00:50] Clarence good to see
[1:00:52] you Hallelujah So within the Our Father
[1:00:56] you can't especially now in this age
[1:00:58] where the George when you say our father
[1:01:00] it is with now the revelation of
[1:01:02] adoption not just God is my father no
[1:01:05] but by the spirit you could the spir
[1:01:08] What Spirit the spirit of adoption you
[1:01:10] could truly cry AB father so the Our
[1:01:13] father now means access to God as your
[1:01:16] father because you are now part of the
[1:01:18] body it means the Our Father part of the
[1:01:22] prayer speaks the Divine
[1:01:24] privilege Divine access yes so outside
[1:01:27] of the body you can't even pray our
[1:01:29] father because it's only by the
[1:01:34] spirit Hallelujah go you have to be led
[1:01:38] by the spirit but say as many as are led
[1:01:40] by the spirit they are the sons of God
[1:01:42] so if you're not spirit-led you can't
[1:01:43] even start to pray just pray oh you
[1:01:45] don't hear me this
[1:01:48] morning
[1:01:51] hallelujah hallelujah so when Jesus said
[1:01:54] our father he was speaking about the
[1:01:56] restoration of
[1:02:02] sunship Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah this
[1:02:05] was not a light Our Father brother
[1:02:07] George he was talking about your check
[1:02:09] your signature being good as a father's
[1:02:11] check this is not the Pentecostal age
[1:02:13] this is not irenia age this is the
[1:02:15] briide age the same Lord's Prayer worked
[1:02:19] in the first age it was prayed in the
[1:02:21] second age it was prayed in the third
[1:02:23] age it was a prayer for all ages but now
[1:02:26] in our
[1:02:28] day what does it mean in our
[1:02:34] day now in our day Sons daughters could
[1:02:38] pray our father with a revelation of
[1:02:40] being in your rightful position as a Son
[1:02:43] of God hallelujah because this is listen
[1:02:47] if somebody random who you don't know
[1:02:48] come and call you father you in
[1:02:51] respond somebody is walking and say
[1:02:54] daddy you say who are you there's no
[1:02:56] relationship but this very prayer starts
[1:02:59] in our father a level of Fellowship a
[1:03:02] level of communication with a direct
[1:03:04] pathway of sunship inheritance
[1:03:08] adoption Romans 8 for you have not
[1:03:10] received a spirit of bondage against the
[1:03:12] fear but you have received a spirit of
[1:03:14] adoption whereby we can cry AB father
[1:03:17] Hallelujah brother Bram taught us
[1:03:19] adoption mean placement so we're talking
[1:03:21] about this prayer there comes a point
[1:03:23] where the Jo where this prayer is about
[1:03:24] plac sonen having a certain kind of
[1:03:26] communication with God can the church
[1:03:29] say
[1:03:32] Amen everybody with me this morning this
[1:03:34] is the same Lord's Prayer right let's go
[1:03:37] we building so going to look at just two
[1:03:39] snapshots they're going to go through
[1:03:40] the prayer then we're going to look and
[1:03:42] see how does the seals connect to the
[1:03:46] prayer everybody with me you know we are
[1:03:49] not creatures of time because from
[1:03:50] eternity and the seeds unlock the
[1:03:52] mystery John wept because there was no
[1:03:54] found no one worthy to to lose the seals
[1:03:56] but the breaking of the seals gives us
[1:03:58] direct access to Redemption the full
[1:04:00] Plan of Redemption can the church say
[1:04:04] amen and brother B I'm taught that the
[1:04:06] Seven Seals is the mystery of God being
[1:04:09] unveiled to God's children can the
[1:04:11] church say amen he that overcometh in
[1:04:14] Revelation shall inherit all things and
[1:04:16] I will be his God and he shall be my son
[1:04:19] Hallelujah
[1:04:22] Glory it goes beyond this Our Father
[1:04:25] which Art in Heaven speaking about the
[1:04:28] sovereignty of
[1:04:30] God glory acknowledging the separation
[1:04:34] acknowledging the fact that God is Not
[1:04:36] on our
[1:04:38] leveling that he's above all our
[1:04:40] problems that the situations on this
[1:04:43] Earthly existence this is small to God
[1:04:45] because he is God in heaven Hallelujah
[1:04:48] and this will make more sense when we
[1:04:49] get to the seals but Our Father Who Art
[1:04:51] in Heaven he is bigger than your problem
[1:04:54] he's bigger than the Earthly situ ation
[1:04:56] he's bigger than Earthly kingdoms he's
[1:04:58] bigger than your bills Our Father which
[1:05:00] art in Heaven this was a prayer but the
[1:05:02] prayer was also a blueprint but it also
[1:05:05] teaches us that before you ask God for
[1:05:07] anything you have to acknowledge who he
[1:05:12] is this prayer has seven Parts but the
[1:05:15] first part just acknowledges Our Father
[1:05:17] Who Art in Heaven Hallelujah he's not a
[1:05:20] God of this Earth he's a god of the
[1:05:22] heaven he is higher than the earth he is
[1:05:25] higher than your problem he is higher
[1:05:26] than your situation he is higher than
[1:05:28] your sickness he is higher than your
[1:05:30] mind battle he is higher than your
[1:05:43] depression then it goes
[1:05:45] on and only true Sons could really pray
[1:05:49] this prayer Hallowed be thy
[1:05:54] name Worthy is your name there's
[1:05:59] reverence in this name there's power in
[1:06:03] this name there's Deliverance in this

[1:06:23] the Bride of Jesus Christ she'll beuse
[1:06:25] miss is Jesus Christ because he will
[1:06:27] have his name oh can the church say Amen
[1:06:30] but do you recognize that there's power
[1:06:31] in his name do you recognize that his
[1:06:34] name is Holy At The Mention Of His Name
[1:06:37] that John was dead in Elizabeth's womb
[1:06:39] but At The Mention of the name that John
[1:06:42] came alive there's power in that name

[1:10:50] redemption that belongs to the human
[1:10:52] race and that is the name of Jesus
[1:11:01] and that name will be your
[1:11:06] identification everybody with me just
[1:11:09] encourag you this morning then the
[1:11:11] prayer goes
[1:11:12] on thy kingdom
[1:11:17] come and here Jesus is connecting all
[1:11:20] the way back to when Daniel saw that
[1:11:23] image talk about the stone that was cut
[1:11:26] out without the hands of man that stone
[1:11:28] that strike the image of the Beast and
[1:11:30] destroyed every single Kingdom this is I
[1:11:33] want you to understand this is a prayer
[1:11:34] that Jesus is saying we ought to be
[1:11:36] praying this
[1:11:38] way so you ought to be praying with a
[1:11:41] consciousness of the relationship you
[1:11:43] have with God and the relationship you
[1:11:46] should have with God the fullness of
[1:11:48] that relationship through the mystery of
[1:11:50] sunship and adoption Hallelujah the fact
[1:11:53] that God is Sovereign and he he is
[1:11:55] bigger he is more powerful he's not here
[1:11:57] on Earth limited to our limited beliefs
[1:11:59] but his thoughts are higher than our
[1:12:00] thoughts his ways are higher on our ways
[1:12:02] as he Heavens are hide on the earth he
[1:12:05] is in
[1:12:07] heaven Hallowed be his name Hallelujah
[1:12:12] and then his kingdom before you ask God
[1:12:14] for blessing before you ask God for
[1:12:16] healing before you ask God for anything
[1:12:19] you want to see his
[1:12:21] kingdom thy kingdom come Hallelujah
[1:12:25] Hallelujah Jesus said the kingdom of God
[1:12:28] the Kingdom of Heaven the kingdom and he
[1:12:30] when he came he was preaching the
[1:12:32] kingdom the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:12:36] hand the whole Bible is about the
[1:12:38] restoration of this
[1:12:40] Kingdom that's
[1:12:43] right and the kingship represents the
[1:12:46] Dominion that man lost that Adam
[1:12:49] lost and we read that scripture because
[1:12:52] when the breaking of the seals that that
[1:12:54] verse 10 it says and we shall reign on
[1:12:57] the earth God has made us both Kings and
[1:12:59] Priests restoring both the priesthood
[1:13:02] and our access to the Altar and
[1:13:04] restoring our kingship which is our
[1:13:06] rulership and Dominion which is Back to
[1:13:07] Eden can the church say
[1:13:10] Amen thy kingdom come a spiritual
[1:13:13] Kingdom an Earthly Kingdom and eternal
[1:13:16] Kingdom can the church say Amen
[1:13:18] everybody with me could we take some
[1:13:22] more amen
[1:13:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:13:29] hallelujah when we get to the seals we
[1:13:31] talk a little bit about how Satan tried
[1:13:33] to build his kingdom and how this Lord
[1:13:36] structure of it God gave us the weapons
[1:13:38] throughout every age to deal with it
[1:13:40] because prayer is your deliverance when
[1:13:43] you're in trouble what you supposed to
[1:13:43] do pray and if you pray a certain way
[1:13:46] with the revelation of what you're
[1:13:47] praying for that's how you overcome
[1:13:49] Jesus overcame by
[1:13:53] prayer everybody with me this morning so
[1:13:55] you're saying brother Isa I'm praying
[1:13:56] for my family I'm praying but are you
[1:13:58] praying with a revelation of
[1:14:00] sunship of where God is with a
[1:14:03] revelation of his name with a revelation
[1:14:05] that his kingdom coming also means
[1:14:07] certain privileges to those who are part
[1:14:09] of this Kingdom die Kingdom Come means
[1:14:12] those who are part of the Kingdom could
[1:14:13] access Kingdom benefits could access
[1:14:15] Kingdom Authority could access Kingdom
[1:14:18] power and that when this kingdom is
[1:14:19] fully realized Satan has no place
[1:14:22] because the sons of God will be in their
[1:14:23] position no wonder the whole creation is
[1:14:25] grown in for the manifestation of the
[1:14:27] sons of God which is the same as Sons
[1:14:29] coming into position in the Kingdom can
[1:14:33] the church say
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:38] hallelujah fear not little flock it is
[1:14:40] your father's good pleasure to give you
[1:14:42] the
[1:14:48] kingdom and the Bible says in Revelation
[1:14:50] 11 the kingdom of this world I become
[1:14:52] the kingdom of our Lord and of his
[1:14:54] Christ and he shall reign forever and
[1:14:56] ever so Satan know his time is short you
[1:14:58] know Hallelujah we are the Kings and
[1:15:00] Priests this Earth belongs to us brother
[1:15:03] Hui are going to take back what belongs
[1:15:05] to us the devil is squatting but the

[1:15:13] looking at royalty K are on the earth

[1:15:18] revealing of the word the opening of the
[1:15:20] seals the revealing of every mystery
[1:15:22] identifies kingship on Earth

[1:15:29] king you are a priest you are royal
[1:15:33] priesthood you were born with the power
[1:15:36] born with authority now are we the sons
[1:15:38] of God it do not appear what we shall be
[1:15:41] but when we see him we shall be like
[1:15:44] [Applause]
[1:15:45] him Hallelujah you may be
[1:15:51] seated everybody feeling fine anybody

[1:16:12] kings there has to be some Kings so he
[1:16:14] could be king of kings we are Kings and

[1:16:26] kingdom becomes the more powerful we
[1:16:30] become when the heads all come
[1:16:34] on and I'm here declaring this morning
[1:16:37] the kingdom is at hand it's closer they
[1:16:40] look for it in the first age they look
[1:16:42] for it in the second
[1:16:44] age do you realize every Church age had
[1:16:48] this
[1:16:50] prayer every Church age prayed for the
[1:16:53] kingdom to come yeah
[1:16:57] they had this same blueprint and every
[1:17:00] every member of the Bride of every age
[1:17:03] could pray the same prayer they say Lord
[1:17:05] thy kingdom come Lord we need your
[1:17:07] kingdom but it was not for the first age
[1:17:10] it was not for the second age it was not
[1:17:12] for the third age but now final age
[1:17:16] final Voice final people thy kingdom
[1:17:19] come
[1:17:23] [Applause]
[1:17:44] Hallelujah we are not just talking about
[1:17:50] sunship Hallelujah the same way brother
[1:17:53] punch Jesus could be
[1:17:55] Prophet priest king sacrifice lawyer and
[1:18:04] judge it's the same way the bride could
[1:18:06] be son King priest intercessor Advocate
[1:18:11] oh come on now you don't hear me this
[1:18:14] morning you're looking at yourself
[1:18:17] small come on Gideon you mighty man of
[1:18:20] Valor do you know who you are do you
[1:18:22] know what you're called to do do you
[1:18:24] that there's more power in you than
[1:18:26] everything the enemy has there's more
[1:18:28] power in you now greater is he that's in
[1:18:30] you than he that's in the
[1:18:33] world that's why your female condition
[1:18:35] has got to
[1:18:37] go that's why cancer has got to go
[1:18:40] that's why high blood pressure has got
[1:18:41] to go that's why every disease has got
[1:18:44] to go because the kingdom is coming into
[1:18:46] Power the kingdom is coming into view
[1:18:49] thy kingdom come
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:02] the kingdom coming is the authority that
[1:19:06] Adam lost coming back into
[1:19:11] Power full restoration of
[1:19:15] Eden everybody feeling
[1:19:18] fine
[1:19:19] Hallelujah
[1:19:21] Glory Hallelujah could you take some
[1:19:24] more
[1:19:25] we still in the
[1:19:28] prayer and it's a prayer you know many
[1:19:30] of us when we hear prayers like you want
[1:19:32] to ask God for something but here Jesus
[1:19:35] is saying you want to know how to pray
[1:19:37] and God has given a secret in this
[1:19:39] prayer a mystery in this prayer a key in
[1:19:42] this prayer he giv them a road map he
[1:19:43] giv them a way of Escape he's given them
[1:19:46] power in the
[1:19:49] prayer now it's one thing because but B
[1:19:51] said the moment the bride gets to know
[1:19:52] who she is then the Raptor could go
[1:19:56] a virgin shall conceive set a scripture
[1:19:59] until Mary
[1:20:01] came Malachi 4 five and six sat a
[1:20:04] scripture until brother brandham
[1:20:09] came so this full mystery of redemption
[1:20:12] unlocked by the revealing of the Seven
[1:20:14] Seals has sat a
[1:20:20] scripture now revealed it's been here
[1:20:22] because Rapture in faith is laying in
[1:20:23] the message
[1:20:25] the key to out of here is lay in the
[1:20:27] message but preach all of
[1:20:30] this thy will be
[1:20:34] done on Earth as it is in heaven now
[1:20:38] this scripture is
[1:20:39] powerful because this scripture is not
[1:20:42] about your will or my will this is about
[1:20:45] the administration of
[1:20:49] will so in Gethsemane in get Gethsemane
[1:20:53] Jesus says Lord not my will but thy will
[1:20:56] be done but this scripture is a little
[1:20:58] different this is saying thy will be
[1:21:00] done on Earth as it is done in heaven in
[1:21:04] other words when God has a will in
[1:21:06] heaven it is carried out a certain way
[1:21:10] or you don't hear me there's nothing to
[1:21:12] challenge his will in
[1:21:17] heaven the administration of his will
[1:21:21] whatever existed to challenge his will
[1:21:23] was kicked out when Lucifer was kicked
[1:21:25] out and we were there doing the kicking
[1:21:29] [Applause]
[1:21:34] out hallu so this prayer before you even
[1:21:38] ask for anything is Lord die will be
[1:21:41] done on Earth with the same
[1:21:43] ease with which it is done in
[1:21:46] heaven where there's nothing to stop it
[1:21:49] you don't hear me this morning thy will
[1:21:51] be done on Earth the same way when God
[1:21:54] say move in heaven brother Lon nobody
[1:21:56] stop they move Hallelujah and there's
[1:22:00] coming a time when God's will on Earth
[1:22:02] will be just like his will in heaven
[1:22:04] where there'll be no nothing to stop his
[1:22:07] will from being fulfilled and if God's
[1:22:10] will is to see you come to Perfection
[1:22:12] there's nothing to stop that will from
[1:22:14] being expressed there's been no demon no
[1:22:17] sickness no power no doubt no fear no
[1:22:20] unbelief his will will have a perfect
[1:22:23] will a perfect
[1:22:28] way you may be
[1:22:32] seated God's will is always done in
[1:22:37] heaven the problem is not in
[1:22:40] heaven the problem is here on Earth
[1:22:43] because man have dominion over the Earth
[1:22:45] and it takes a man totally surrendered
[1:22:47] to God for God's will to be able to
[1:22:51] operate but there's some resistance on
[1:22:53] Earth
[1:22:56] that's hindering the
[1:22:57] will so in that prayer before you ask
[1:23:00] for anything is thy will be done because
[1:23:04] if you could ever get to the spot where
[1:23:06] the way your will is managed and
[1:23:08] administered and
[1:23:10] expressed so when those boys were in the
[1:23:13] fiery furnace worm would say send me
[1:23:15] I'll
[1:23:16] go but God's will say woman no you don't
[1:23:21] go woman say Fe and led to go down
[1:23:25] the Lord himself became the Forman in
[1:23:27] the fire his will perfectly
[1:23:31] [Music]
[1:23:34] expressed we are waiting to see the will
[1:23:37] of God fully expressed on the earth the
[1:23:40] same way is expressed in Heaven Can the
[1:23:43] church say
[1:23:47] Amen this battle of will where on the
[1:23:50] earth now
[1:23:52] Jesus has to pray not not my will but
[1:23:55] thine be done and this battle that we
[1:23:58] face on this Earth of this two Wills
[1:24:01] your will your desire your goal your
[1:24:02] dream your ambition and God has a will
[1:24:04] for your life he has a purpose for your
[1:24:06] life he has a plan for your life he has
[1:24:08] blessings for your life and we end up
[1:24:10] actually hindering the plan of God for
[1:24:12] our lives because our will gets in the
[1:24:13] way of God's will right that's right can
[1:24:17] the church say
[1:24:19] Amen
[1:24:21] Glory Hallelujah now after this picture
[1:24:26] where the Clarance is p is painted Our
[1:24:28] Father adoption sunship Who Art in
[1:24:31] Heaven his TOS hide on our thoughts the
[1:24:33] celestial realm above the terrestrial
[1:24:36] realm Hallowed be thy name the name of
[1:24:39] God the name above every other name
[1:24:41] there's no other
[1:24:43] name thy kingdom come prophetic speaking
[1:24:48] of the coming Kingdom that has been
[1:24:49] spoken about that brings us all the way
[1:24:51] back to
[1:24:52] Eden thy will be done
[1:24:55] on Earth as it is in
[1:24:56] heaven now we finish this first part of
[1:24:59] the prayer that has nothing to do with
[1:25:04] you all of that prayer thus far has all
[1:25:07] to do with God our Father in heaven
[1:25:11] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:25:14] thy will be done on Earth as it is in
[1:25:16] heaven no man in that prayer
[1:25:22] them some of we approach God and say
[1:25:24] Lord is me
[1:25:28] again Lord I look in you know you know
[1:25:30] my
[1:25:31] need and you approach god without
[1:25:34] acknowledging if you even have a
[1:25:37] relationship without acknowledging the
[1:25:39] sovereignty of who he is and the Majesty
[1:25:41] of his power without reverencing his
[1:25:44] name without speaking the way he said of
[1:25:47] his coming
[1:25:49] Kingdom without acknowledging the fact
[1:25:51] that his will has to be here on Earth as
[1:25:53] it is in heaven the way it was in
[1:25:55] Eden because we said at the beginning
[1:25:58] God's will was perfectly expressed
[1:25:59] before the fall anybody with me this
[1:26:02] morning now after this he could say give
[1:26:06] us this
[1:26:08] day our daily
[1:26:12] bread speaks of the provision of
[1:26:15] God every single
[1:26:18] day so every day you supposed to be
[1:26:21] asking God where is my bread for today
[1:26:28] because he's the one who's supposed to
[1:26:29] give you your daily bread and the
[1:26:33] prayers give us this day our daily bread
[1:26:36] on a daily basis you acknowledging the
[1:26:39] fact that there's no bread outside you
[1:26:41] don't want bread outside of God's
[1:26:48] bread so when you get up in the morning
[1:26:50] and you working because you working and
[1:26:52] and it's your effort and that's is not
[1:26:54] God's bread you going to work because
[1:26:56] you want to go to work for God to
[1:26:58] determine how what bread you supposed to
[1:27:00] get so this is in the natural as much as
[1:27:03] it is in the spiritual
[1:27:05] amen are you looking to your own
[1:27:07] strength for your daily bread or are you
[1:27:10] ready trusting in God to give you every
[1:27:13] day your daily bread because he said
[1:27:16] I've
[1:27:17] never seen the righteous
[1:27:20] forsaken or his seed begging bread this
[1:27:23] is not you breing bread this is God
[1:27:25] saying he has promised to provide your
[1:27:27] needs but you have to ask him on a daily
[1:27:31] basis give us this
[1:27:34] day I want my bread for Sunday Lord
[1:27:37] whatever is for me today in the natural
[1:27:39] in the spiritual I want it today this

[1:32:19] this thing good all by itself all the
[1:32:22] nutrients for the body is in bread this
[1:32:25] is not man big bread this is daily bread
[1:32:27] from the Lord
[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:31] himself friends you may be seated I have
[1:32:35] no bread to give
[1:32:36] you my bread a taking you anywhere
[1:32:40] because Jesus said he is the
[1:32:46] bread he's the living
[1:32:50] bread so the daily bread is eaten
[1:32:53] brother George of the the living
[1:32:55] bread we are feeding on the body
[1:32:59] word the unfailing body word of the son
[1:33:02] of man that's the living bread fresh
[1:33:05] every day can the church say Amen come
[1:33:07] on young people you got to know this
[1:33:09] this is your
[1:33:14] message throughout every age with the
[1:33:17] pop well they had to seek
[1:33:20] God for the bread of that day
[1:33:25] so the just shall live by faith was the
[1:33:28] bread for luter day and if you fed on
[1:33:31] that bread you were nourished in that
[1:33:34] age in Wesley's age they had bread for
[1:33:37] their day Luther's bread was stale in
[1:33:41] Wesley's day they had to get fresh bread
[1:33:45] baked for their age baked for their hour
[1:33:48] God called men had to stand identified
[1:33:51] with the revealing of the word for that
[1:33:53] day
[1:33:54] only preaching fresh bread only bringing
[1:33:57] fresh bread but that bread also became
[1:34:00] stale during the open door age when the
[1:34:02] Pentecostals come can the church say
[1:34:04] amen and now under the messenger of the
[1:34:08] seven Angel seven star in the right hand
[1:34:11] of God Malachi 45 and 6 St Luke 17:30
[1:34:16] Revelation 10:7 William Bram the prophet
[1:34:18] we have all the food value that was Tau
[1:34:22] up all over the ages big into the best
[1:34:24] bread you could ever eat the Lord Jesus
[1:34:27] Christ himself because the son of man
[1:34:30] was veiled in a son of man giving out
[1:34:32] the bread
[1:34:34] [Applause]
[1:34:35] himself Hallelujah you may be
[1:34:41] seated hallelu so I want to underscore
[1:34:43] friends that Jesus gave this Lord's
[1:34:45] Prayer and as a believer in every age
[1:34:48] you had a right to pray this
[1:34:51] prayer with the revelation of the word
[1:34:53] you had in that day it is just that in
[1:34:56] our day it means the fullness of of
[1:34:58] everything because we can look back and
[1:35:00] see what has already taken place
[1:35:02] everybody with me could you take some
[1:35:11] more
[1:35:18] Glory so much I want to skip a few
[1:35:21] things here because I have some
[1:35:23] us is day our daily bread and let's move
[1:35:27] on forgive
[1:35:32] us everybody with
[1:35:35] me forgive us our
[1:35:39] debts as
[1:35:42] we so your
[1:35:45] debt is
[1:35:48] conditional now this is a mystery here
[1:35:51] because this age there's a virtue of
[1:35:54] this age brotherly kindness
[1:35:56] forgiveness so Jesus was praying and yes
[1:35:59] they could have prayed it in the first
[1:36:00] age second age third age but this has
[1:36:04] significance because if this virtue is
[1:36:06] not displayed your father can't even
[1:36:08] forgive
[1:36:09] you who am I to hold something against
[1:36:12] you when God had to tell the prophet
[1:36:15] that when he was judging The woman there
[1:36:18] he said I forgive you and you condemn
[1:36:20] her
[1:36:28] So within the Lord's Prayer God drop a
[1:36:32] mystery of the virtue of this
[1:36:34] age it was relevant in every age but
[1:36:37] this age has particular
[1:36:42] significance we are dependent on God's
[1:36:45] forgiveness I cannot stand here this
[1:36:47] morning before you without God's
[1:36:50] forgiveness last week Sund neigh who
[1:36:52] over was preaching he say know to your
[1:36:58] ID I know Isaac ID you know
[1:37:02] yourself no one could stand here and
[1:37:05] claim to be
[1:37:06] anybody because the same blood for you
[1:37:09] is the same blood for me without the
[1:37:11] blood I cannot say anything because I
[1:37:13] need the blood to speak better things
[1:37:15] for me than I what I can say for myself
[1:37:18] I need the voice of the blood to speak
[1:37:20] for
[1:37:22] me who am I to hold a grudge sometime I
[1:37:25] go about over preach people renewing
[1:37:26] their
[1:37:30] grudges the The Grudge on a
[1:37:35] subscription until some you forget what
[1:37:37] The Grudge is
[1:37:38] for mama why we don't talk to them again
[1:37:40] I can't remember you know I just know we
[1:37:42] don't talk to
[1:37:46] them but within the
[1:37:49] prayer God is saying on a daily basis
[1:37:52] because you grow as a Christian by
[1:37:54] reading the word and praying every day
[1:37:56] and however you pray this here is a
[1:37:58] template that every day you're dying out
[1:38:01] to yourself and every day you're
[1:38:02] forgiven looking for God to release you
[1:38:05] and as you release others God releases
[1:38:09] you forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:38:14] our debtors and if you hold one art but
[1:38:17] I'm said you stand in danger of Hell's
[1:38:21] fire thank you just one just
[1:38:25] one you imagine you stand for this B all
[1:38:29] these years and you can't forgive one
[1:38:30] brother one sister one Deacon one Usher
[1:38:32] the pastor your wife your children your
[1:38:35] coworker your
[1:38:38] boss and you risking your life because
[1:38:40] you you want to
[1:38:44] forgive we still in the Lord's Prayer
[1:38:54] and that simple verse speaks of two
[1:38:55] kinds of forgiveness it speaks of God's
[1:38:58] forgiveness and it speaks of forgiveness
[1:39:00] towards one
[1:39:01] another and friends quite honestly if
[1:39:04] there was no nothing to offend or
[1:39:06] nothing to hurt or nothing to create
[1:39:07] conflict there'll be never situation for
[1:39:09] us to have issue with one
[1:39:11] another but God by Design thank you Lord
[1:39:15] allow
[1:39:16] situations so that we can express this
[1:39:19] thing and brother brandham taught us
[1:39:21] that the devil will test every virtue
[1:39:24] to see what stuff you really made up
[1:39:26] because that those virtues is the entire
[1:39:29] word image of God that's the being when
[1:39:34] complete will go into Rapture so you
[1:39:36] have to have it all can the church say
[1:39:38] Amen everybody feeling
[1:39:41] fine could you take some
[1:39:47] more and then the prayer goes on
[1:39:54] lead
[1:39:55] us not into
[1:40:00] temptation but Deliver
[1:40:03] Us from
[1:40:06] Evil that lead us not into
[1:40:10] temptation it's powerful and we'll get
[1:40:13] to it when we dealing with the
[1:40:15] seals but it speaks of a testing time
[1:40:19] and a certain kind of a test can the
[1:40:22] Church Say Amen
[1:40:28] amen and Deliver Us from
[1:40:33] Evil So within the prayer and and your
[1:40:36] daily prayer and we'll see it in the
[1:40:37] seal exactly what this prayer really
[1:40:38] means for us you're looking for God to
[1:40:41] Lord don't lead me into temptation don't
[1:40:43] lead me into a trial a situation a
[1:40:47] test and Deliver Me from all evil
[1:40:56] and then it ends with a
[1:40:59] declaration for thine is the
[1:41:02] kingdom kingdom is in power now and the
[1:41:06] power so by the time you reach this
[1:41:08] portion of the prayer this is full
[1:41:11] restoration for thine is the kingdom and
[1:41:14] the power and the
[1:41:16] glory
[1:41:18] forever can the Church Say Amen
[1:41:23] at the end of this prayer it speaks of
[1:41:25] God's kingdom fully
[1:41:29] restored it speaks of the Kingdom with
[1:41:32] Christ as king over all the Earth it
[1:41:35] speaks of the full authority of God
[1:41:37] being displayed and it speaks of the
[1:41:40] bride and the groom
[1:41:42] glorified his kingdom coming into Power
[1:41:46] Daniel's Vision come into full
[1:41:48] manifestation can the church say Amen
[1:41:51] now I want to jump into a few things
[1:41:52] here now
[1:41:54] from the message the seven
[1:41:55] seal brother brandham said the breaking
[1:41:57] of the seal was so great as heaven was
[1:42:01] hushed there was nothing move for half
[1:42:03] an
[1:42:04] hour but in the suspense of between
[1:42:07] death and life it seemed like a
[1:42:08] millennium it was so great Jesus never
[1:42:11] mentioned it none of the rest of them
[1:42:13] John couldn't even write it he was
[1:42:14] forbidden to write it can the church say
[1:42:17] Amen we're building into something the
[1:42:19] 420 Elders have stood and B goes and
[1:42:22] breaks out the whole drama of it
[1:42:29] Hallelujah let me skip through a few
[1:42:30] things
[1:42:32] here hallu God's great mystery of how
[1:42:35] it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody
[1:42:38] know nothing about it even the angels
[1:42:40] didn't understand it he didn't reveal it
[1:42:42] that's the reason under our seven
[1:42:44] mystery when the seven seal was open
[1:42:46] there was silence so all of this is
[1:42:48] painting a picture of the importance of
[1:42:50] the ministry of the prophet and the
[1:42:53] importance of the breaking of the seals
[1:42:55] and the re revelation of this mystery to
[1:42:58] us a voice to break the silence and
[1:43:01] brother brandham taught us a seal is a
[1:43:03] finished work and a seal signifies
[1:43:06] approval and the seal is necessary to
[1:43:08] protect what's inside and we know the
[1:43:10] Seven Seals was that book of redemption
[1:43:14] it was tied up in those seals and when
[1:43:15] you open a seal to look at the contents
[1:43:18] you could know what's happening under
[1:43:20] the seal now the first seal to the four
[1:43:23] seal identifies how Satan infiltrated
[1:43:27] the church with the Antichrist Spirit
[1:43:29] everybody with me four Riders the White
[1:43:33] Horse red horse black horse Pale Horse
[1:43:35] we're going to do a little teaching here
[1:43:37] some of you will know it some of you
[1:43:38] it's a reminder to
[1:43:40] you but even though Satan caused havoc
[1:43:43] in the church God still did a work of
[1:43:46] redemption and in every age even though
[1:43:48] these Riders were riding through the
[1:43:50] ages God still call upride and God sent
[1:43:54] forth a lion ox man and an eagle to deal
[1:43:58] with these Riders can the church say
[1:43:59] Amen this great drama of God being
[1:44:03] unfolded as he opened each seal and when
[1:44:06] he opened the fifth seal we see another
[1:44:07] work of redemption a work of redemption
[1:44:09] for the Jews and The Sixth Seal we know
[1:44:12] is a judgment seal the judgment to come
[1:44:15] but when he open the seventh seal there
[1:44:16] was
[1:44:17] silence a mystery under there Satan
[1:44:21] don't know what's there Hal Hallelujah
[1:44:23] the invisible God doing a work in secret
[1:44:26] because if he reveal it the devil could
[1:44:28] do
[1:44:29] damage and Satan is mad because he
[1:44:31] doesn't know the mystery of how you
[1:44:33] going to get into Power how you going to
[1:44:35] move from the altar of having to pray
[1:44:37] all the way to your throne of power
[1:44:39] moving into your full position as a
[1:44:41] royal priest can the church say
[1:44:44] Amen every seal had a
[1:44:46] symbol but the seven seal itself is
[1:44:49] Christ the lord himself he sending with
[1:44:51] a shout voice Trump Hallelujah could it
[1:44:54] be that you and I are the living symbol
[1:44:57] of the seventh seal to take us back to
[1:45:00] Eden back to the spoken word each seal
[1:45:03] had a word had a history had a age had a
[1:45:07] vision had a people the first to the
[1:45:10] four seals had their age and the history
[1:45:13] it was the church ages the fifth seal
[1:45:15] has the age of the Jews the six seal has
[1:45:18] a age which is the
[1:45:20] Tribulation hallu
[1:45:23] The Sixth Seal will have a history or a
[1:45:25] time three and a half years but the
[1:45:27] seventh seal since the prophet left we
[1:45:30] have been feasting under the of the
[1:45:33] under on the hidden manner under the
[1:45:35] seven
[1:45:36] seal the seventh seal as a age we are in
[1:45:39] the briide age the age of the seven seal
[1:45:41] and hidden under silence every mystery
[1:45:44] being unfolded s is a time for the bride
[1:45:46] to break the Silence from under the
[1:45:49] seven
[1:45:51] seal and it could it be the mystery of
[1:45:53] God of all ages was locked up through
[1:45:56] that Lord's Prayer when God said Deliver
[1:45:58] Us from Evil this is not just smoking
[1:46:00] and drinking but is the evil one
[1:46:02] himself Deliver Us From Time Deliver us
[1:46:06] from sin Deliver Us from sickness
[1:46:08] Deliver Us from unbelief Deliver Us from
[1:46:10] all
[1:46:13] evil Adam had lost the book this book of
[1:46:17] redemption Adam lost it Satan tried to
[1:46:19] grab it but that book of redemption went
[1:46:22] back into the the hands of the original
[1:46:25] owner only a certain hand could hold
[1:46:28] that
[1:46:30] book and John was weeping because there
[1:46:33] was nobody found worthy to even touch it
[1:46:36] or even look upon it and they cried out
[1:46:38] Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[1:46:41] Judah the royal king and there stood a
[1:46:45] lamb Hallelujah and that lamb stepped
[1:46:48] forward and John could shout because he
[1:46:51] knew that the silence was about to break
[1:46:54] the breaking of the seals to reveal the
[1:46:56] secret Plan of Redemption can the church
[1:46:59] say
[1:47:02] amen
[1:47:03] hallelujah Glory
[1:47:06] Hallelujah everybody feeling fine we are
[1:47:10] more than conquerors this morning do you
[1:47:12] know who you
[1:47:14] are could you take some more no I want
[1:47:17] to do something here
[1:47:21] now we start Ed in Genesis we started
[1:47:25] with the perfect will of God on Heaven
[1:47:26] and on Earth we started with man falling
[1:47:29] out of position we started with man not
[1:47:31] needing to pray and then prayer becoming
[1:47:33] a requirement because man communication
[1:47:35] with God was broken we talked about
[1:47:37] Jesus coming on the earth king priest
[1:47:40] Prophet sacrifice to restore the
[1:47:42] connection we talk about Jesus Christ
[1:47:44] dying because the lamb slain was the
[1:47:46] only one who could take the
[1:47:49] book and we talk about he giving them up
[1:47:52] blueprint brother Cen of a prayer that
[1:47:55] would withstand time would withstand
[1:47:57] ages it will work in the first age it
[1:47:59] will work in the second age work in the
[1:48:00] third age and it work in the last age
[1:48:02] can the church say
[1:48:08] Amen now the Seven
[1:48:12] Seals brother bam showed us the seven
[1:48:15] Mysteries unfolding God's Redemptive
[1:48:18] plan
[1:48:26] Revelation
[1:48:28] 6 and I saw when the lamb open one of
[1:48:30] the seals and I heard as it word a noise
[1:48:32] of Thunder one of the four be saying
[1:48:34] come and see and I saw Behold a white
[1:48:38] horse and he had sat on him had a bow
[1:48:39] and a crown was given unto him and he
[1:48:41] went forth
[1:48:43] conquering and to
[1:48:49] conquer and but man I'm identified
[1:48:52] this first Rider as the Antichrist
[1:48:58] amen that started riding through the
[1:49:01] first church
[1:49:03] age and M brandham taught us that this
[1:49:05] Antichrist Spirit began as a deception
[1:49:07] in the early church with the nickan
[1:49:11] influence and what this what did this
[1:49:14] nickan influence bring it actually
[1:49:16] brought a false
[1:49:20] fatherhood everybody with me in so much
[1:49:24] that we started to call for the Holy
[1:49:25] Father because that is where paple Rome
[1:49:28] started to
[1:49:29] form so when Jesus is now giving this
[1:49:32] Lord's Prayer The Lord's Prayer starts
[1:49:35] actually dealing with the deception of
[1:49:38] the first
[1:49:39] seal because those who were caught under
[1:49:42] that age of the first seal were being
[1:49:44] deceived into paple Holy
[1:49:49] Father fake
[1:49:51] father so when Jesus saying Our Father
[1:49:54] which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[1:49:58] this was now
[1:50:00] ammunition to deal with that first horse
[1:50:03] rider that was bringing deception to
[1:50:05] introduce a different
[1:50:08] fatherhood so the Lord's Prayer had in
[1:50:11] it a secret as it were to deal with the
[1:50:14] deception of the first
[1:50:17] seal the Antichrist Spirit under the
[1:50:20] first seal was trying to overcome God's
[1:50:23] position and receive worship as a Holy
[1:50:26] Father so here it is the Lord in the
[1:50:29] Lord's Prayer is given a weapon for the
[1:50:31] first seal Our Father which art in
[1:50:34] heaven Hallowed be thy name and that
[1:50:37] first horse rider trying to bring a Holy
[1:50:40] Father paple Rome that prayer dealt with
[1:50:42] that father dealt with that horse rider
[1:50:45] come on now
[1:50:54] everybody with me can the church say
[1:50:59] amen and when he had opened the second
[1:51:01] seal I heard the second beast say come
[1:51:02] and see and they went on another horse
[1:51:05] that was red and power was given to him
[1:51:06] and sat there on to take PR peace from
[1:51:09] the earth and that they should kill one
[1:51:11] another and they were given unto him a
[1:51:12] great
[1:51:14] sword look at the mystery of God
[1:51:17] unfolding Jesus is actually speaking
[1:51:20] about all the church ages and all the
[1:51:21] seeds in the Lord
[1:51:23] pray because amidst this shift brother
[1:51:27] brandham calls it of the rider coming
[1:51:29] off of the White Horse to go onto the
[1:51:32] red horse but bham said now here is my
[1:51:34] revelation of it this is Satan again
[1:51:36] it's the devil again in another form he
[1:51:39] dropped his bow he got off his White
[1:51:40] Horse he got on his red horse for he can
[1:51:43] kill anybody that don't agree with him
[1:51:44] there's your
[1:51:46] seal so when Jesus said thy kingdom come
[1:51:54] prise what began as deceit on the White
[1:51:57] Horse became open violence Under the Red
[1:52:01] Horse and by the Bon revealed that the
[1:52:03] Antichrist Spirit under the second seal
[1:52:06] was uniting church and state to create a
[1:52:09] false
[1:52:10] Kingdom so in response to the red horse
[1:52:15] creating a false Kingdom he is Jesus
[1:52:17] saying thy kingdom come
[1:52:22] So within the Lord's Prayer The Lord's
[1:52:24] Prayer deal with the White Horse The
[1:52:26] Lord's Prayer deal with the red horse
[1:52:28] anybody with me this
[1:52:35] morning thy kingdom come stands at a
[1:52:38] bold declaration as the false church was
[1:52:42] rising up under that red horse rider as
[1:52:46] it were the falsehood raise a sword
[1:52:48] there was a kingdom that was being
[1:52:50] established and in the face of that
[1:52:52] kingom om here is the voice in The
[1:52:54] Lord's Prayer declaring thy kingdom come
[1:52:57] there's no other Kingdom that can match
[1:52:59] his kingdom it doesn't matter what they
[1:53:01] do the second seal showed a kingdom
[1:53:04] being formed which is church and state
[1:53:06] but the bom taught us
[1:53:08] that by the time you reach the third
[1:53:10] seal what was it a black
[1:53:12] horse
[1:53:14] balancing with a with balances in his
[1:53:16] hand the Bible says a measure of weed
[1:53:18] for a penny and three measures of barley
[1:53:20] for a penny and so forth and what was it
[1:53:22] brother random typed this out as the
[1:53:24] will of man being expressed this was Pap
[1:53:27] Rome expressing the will of man with how
[1:53:29] you're supposed to go to heaven and all
[1:53:30] these things isn't that right what does
[1:53:33] your Lord's Prayer have thy will be done
[1:53:36] on Earth as it is in
[1:53:39] heaven so that Rider tried to bring
[1:53:42] man's will as established and God is
[1:53:44] saying not man's
[1:53:46] will but thy will be done on Earth as it
[1:53:48] is in heaven the will of man with how he
[1:53:51] supposed to be saved God deals with that
[1:53:53] writer can the church say Amen oh
[1:53:57] Hallelujah in that age but the Bram tled
[1:54:00] as a age of great
[1:54:01] hunger as they held back the wheat from
[1:54:04] the people as it were can the church say
[1:54:07] Amen the Believers had little access to
[1:54:08] the Bible we know these
[1:54:10] things by the time we come to the fourth
[1:54:13] seal what was it the Pale Horse but said
[1:54:15] that Pale Horse was wrapped up in him
[1:54:17] all the other
[1:54:18] horses and that rider was dead
[1:54:23] and what did God give us as a response
[1:54:25] to debt in the Lord's Prayer he said
[1:54:27] give us this day our daily
[1:54:29] bread because in that age of debt is not
[1:54:31] just natural that is spiritual debt
[1:54:33] famine in the land death in the land and
[1:54:35] in the midst of that as a response to
[1:54:37] that those in that age could say give us
[1:54:39] is there our daily bread and they could
[1:54:41] have life and sustenance away from what
[1:54:43] the devil was doing can the church say
[1:54:45] Amen we see the unfolding of God can the
[1:54:48] church say amen glory
[1:54:54] when he opened the fifth seal what was
[1:54:56] it Jews under the altar crying out for
[1:54:59] what for
[1:55:02] vengeance the next part of the prayer
[1:55:04] actually says about
[1:55:08] forgiveness because those Jews could
[1:55:10] only cry for vengeance because they
[1:55:12] hadn't received
[1:55:13] Christ but receiving Christ Ministry
[1:55:15] would give you a Ministry of forgiveness
[1:55:17] but yet still they were true so God
[1:55:19] would actually still do a work of
[1:55:21] redemption with the Jews
[1:55:23] but the connection there is still that
[1:55:25] Ministry of forgiveness and
[1:55:28] Reconciliation can the church say amen
[1:55:31] glory everybody feeling fine I'm almost
[1:55:35] done and the six seal what is it is a
[1:55:38] judgment
[1:55:40] seal and I beheld when he had opened a
[1:55:42] six seal and lo there was a great
[1:55:44] earthquake and the sun became black a
[1:55:46] sack clot of hair and moon became as
[1:55:48] blood and the stars of Heaven fell under
[1:55:49] the Earth even as a fig tree casted her
[1:55:51] on figs when she was shaken of A Mighty
[1:55:54] Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll
[1:55:56] when it was rolled together and every
[1:55:58] mountain and Island were move out of
[1:56:00] their places and the kings of the earth
[1:56:02] and the great men and the rich men and
[1:56:04] the chief captains and the Mighty Men
[1:56:06] And every Bor man and every free man hid
[1:56:09] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[1:56:12] of the mountains and said to the
[1:56:14] mountains and rocks fall on us and hide
[1:56:16] us from the face of him that sited on
[1:56:18] the throne and from the Wrath of the
[1:56:20] lamb from the great day of his Wrath has
[1:56:22] come who shall be able to
[1:56:27] stand the Judgment
[1:56:33] seal and in the Lord's Prayer the next
[1:56:37] part of the say lead us not into this
[1:56:40] temptation in other words this prayer
[1:56:42] actually means Lord don't I don't want
[1:56:44] to see the tribulation or
[1:56:47] know don't take me down this road not
[1:56:50] thises in other words words we are being
[1:56:53] taught that we have to pray Lord
[1:56:54] whatever I need to do I don't want to
[1:56:55] make that I don't want to be in that
[1:56:58] that's not my
[1:57:01] portion so the Lord's Prayer is actually
[1:57:03] saying avoid the six
[1:57:08] seal and it goes on to Deliver Us from
[1:57:10] Evil which is not just evil it's not
[1:57:12] just smoking and drinking this is the
[1:57:13] evil one evil has a
[1:57:16] source so it's the evil
[1:57:19] one and that last scripture which is
[1:57:21] Deliver Us he will for down the kingdom
[1:57:23] that's the seventh seal because the
[1:57:25] seventh seal deals with the Enemy the
[1:57:27] seventh seal reestablishes the kingdom
[1:57:30] the Seven Seals puts you into your
[1:57:31] position the seven seal is the claiming
[1:57:33] seal the seven seal is the Dominion seal
[1:57:36] the seven seal is the Seal of mystery
[1:57:38] the seven seing the seven
[1:57:40] [Music]
[1:57:45] Thunders can the church say Amen Glory
[1:57:49] Hallelujah can the Church Say Amen the
[1:57:52] seven seal is the Deliverance seal it's
[1:57:55] Christ coming back in the power the Lord
[1:57:56] himself that's who you are you are the
[1:57:59] mystery under the seven seal and you
[1:58:02] shall reign on the
[1:58:06] earth the musician get ready I'm
[1:58:08] wrapping up
[1:58:09] [Applause]
[1:58:12] Glory oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:58:17] hallelujah so the Lord's Prayer is a
[1:58:20] prayer that wits to the ages but it's a
[1:58:22] prayer that places God in his place and
[1:58:25] allows us to now come to God with the
[1:58:27] right kind of
[1:58:29] request because the Bible say but asking
[1:58:31] God a Miss we asking God for all kind of
[1:58:34] stuff driven by our own lust but here
[1:58:38] God is saying ask for Daily Bread ask

[2:18:11] brother Isaac as God has blessed him to
[2:18:13] be traveling this little season here and
[2:18:16] get more more experiences of what God's
[2:18:19] love and the commitment of the Bel Bel
[2:18:21] all around how they love the Lord and
[2:18:23] they're seeking after God the same devil
[2:18:25] fighting them fighting you fighting us
[2:18:28] and we have to fight for one another
[2:18:30] pray for one another and pull up one
[2:18:33] another not to beat down somebody your
[2:18:36] kind lightting brighter doesn't mean
[2:18:37] that you want to out somebody light to
[2:18:39] make your candle light bright you want
[2:18:41] to help somebody light up you want to
[2:18:43] encourage somebody you want to pick them
[2:18:45] up there's so much negative all around
[2:18:47] and that's why God bring these things
[2:18:49] that you could see it clearly why he
[2:18:51] could justify us why because it is Adam
[2:18:54] and Eve's fault that's why we are here
[2:18:57] why we are great here that why we have
[2:18:58] sorrow that we have debt that where we
[2:19:00] have crying because of Adam and Eve if
[2:19:02] Adam and Eve did not fall we was going
[2:19:04] to be in a perfect State as Sons and
[2:19:06] Daughters of God so God in bringing this
[2:19:09] old Plan of Redemption he could bring us
[2:19:11] back to full justification as if we
[2:19:14] never did it now you as a finite person
[2:19:16] a human person remember all what you
[2:19:18] have done but God said
[2:19:21] he doesn't remember it because he has a
[2:19:23] sea of forgetfulness now if he doesn't
[2:19:26] remember it why should I hold it against
[2:19:28] you doesn't make any sense because he's
[2:19:31] the boss he's in charge I want I think
[2:19:34] about if he doesn't remember it why
[2:19:36] should I hold it against you so it is
[2:19:40] important because faith is based upon
[2:19:43] forgiveness you guys what people feel of
[2:19:45] they have faith and what they have no
[2:19:46] faith if they a big old gr is God so big
[2:19:49] it pumping out their skin
[2:19:52] pumping all the mouth every open the
[2:19:54] mouth is Grudge talking it's Grudge
[2:19:56] talking they are Grudge like Grudge
[2:19:59] speak have a voice you have to drop it
[2:20:02] you have to let it go it's like your
[2:20:04] passport stamp you have a Visa and you
[2:20:06] find away
[2:20:08] Glory you're going away you're watching
[2:20:10] you watching know what your neighbor
[2:20:11] will do forget that you back you're on
[2:20:15] your way out so let's all stand we want
