their beautiful daughter congratulations where is that where's that new dada oh he's not here oh he's opportunity to leave happy for them praise the lord blessed be the name of the lord okay there we are and forgive me i have to kind of find my way around here a bit so india we are glorious meetings i it's kind of mind-blowing got some great experiences and i spoke five messages here the prophetic vision one the word bride two three the lamb's book for the inheritance divided and five the final voice i never spoke so many times in one meeting before but that's what i did my god's grace and uh i really want to thank you for your prayer i felt the prayers of the believers i felt empowered i had the strength and energy to preach and i just thank god for that that i was able to go through by the grace of god i was able by god's grace and helped to address many issues that are now pending and to deal with them and we don't have other messages as yet from india on the website or available but as soon as come we're going to put it up we do have the pa meetings now on the website i spoke two services there the bride the lamb's wife that's the first message the second message was the spirit and the bride so that's the two messages today i told them not to come that's the spirit and the bride see the spirit gonna come up on the bride but the bride the lamb's wife meant a lot to me because i'm totally convinced now that the bride will not be manhandled i am thoroughly convinced that the bride will not be manhandled because the bride is the lamb's wife hallelujah hallelujah you know in trinidad they have a false teaching and a false doctrine where the church is the wife of the pastor so if you go by the next church you commit adultery and fornication and that kind of foolishness and that's based upon one little quote but abandonment says you know the white the church like our wife said they passed a one little quote and that has been doctrinized nailed on and the people knee along with it see and with that now the people feel obligated to that particular minister but the scripture says and it's so unique that is the angel with the viles having the plagues to come i will assure you the bride the lamb's wife so i want you to know this morning that anne-marie is my wife you bride lamb's wife so you're not tied to me have one woman tied to me that is annmarie but the bride is the lamb's wife hallelujah and jesus knew how to take care of his wife and the scriptures say his wife had made herself ready so she going to know who she is hallelujah you're not hearing me this morning she's going to know who she is and she's going to make herself ready the bible said his wife had to make herself ready oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen you may be seated so brother branham brought the wedding garment and put it on books and tapes and his wife got to take the wedding garment and she's gonna put it on and everybody's going to laugh at her believe she's going to put it on she's going to be dressed in the gong of his promised world give the lord a shelter praise that's the brightest morning she'll be dressed in the gown of his promised word that's why for 40 plus years you have been hearing promise after promise after promise oh get the lord glory hallelujah hallelujah and you know why i'm not afraid to preach it because i didn't promise it the god who promised it is able to perform it the god who promised it is able to confirm it oh hallelujah man has nothing to do with him oh hallelujah glory so we're living in troubles times hallelujah this morning on the news russia politely let the world know it has 5 000 nuclear warheads just in case they don't know what they have and and what they can do he let the poor politely know they have 5 000 nuclear warheads this is not a game this is just two forces hallelujah is the power of god and the power of the devil hallelujah this is prophecy is about to fulfill the king of the north is about to make his move what about the queen of the south what about the bride hallelujah if the king of the north is about to make his move if there is a pharaoh who knew not joseph isn't there going to be some joseph isn't there going to be some people called out some elected if the power is moving upon those demons out there and their power to move upon the pride what are we waiting for what are we looking for what are we expecting this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the bible call it the beginning of sorrows however does daniel call it a time of trouble such as the world has never seen but at that time my culture stand up oh what michael's gonna do he gonna stand up and deliver every name on the book for glory to god oh hallelujah hallelujah at that time michael gonna stand up and deliver every name on the book oh hallelujah oh glory to god say if you ever thought this message was just another ordinary church message you're gonna find out this is the real thing ebola is coming it's on its way it's part of the plagues that is loosed on the earth and brother branham said we are striving to get into the kingdom of god before these horrible plagues strike it's coming it's coming but they're going to strike but before it strikes he's prophesied about the manifestation of the sons of god that could have stopped sickness that could just stop diseases that could just stop cancer they're going to stop what is coming on here there is no way out we call it perplexity men are failing for fear for the things that coming up on the earth oh hallelujah hallelujah and i mustn't praise god you are one in a million you better start to shout if you never showed before you better start the show oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah praise the name of the lord praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory glory glory glory glory hallelujah the bible said when the enemy when the enemy that's we have an enemy when the enemy comes in he's coming when he comes like a flirt not a trickle like a flood he had to get big and bad you had to get big and bold it ought to be beyond what man can do when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit the spirit not a spirit but the spirit the spirit is health not looter not wesley not pentecost but the spirit itself going to raise a standard and the word is a conductor of the spirit then the bride has to become the word that the spirit could move to that bread and be a conductor or glory to god by the time the enemy come the bride should be the word itself glory and the spirit will come upon the pride hallelujah oh glory to god they haven't seen this message yet you may be seated they only hear paper testimonies they only hearing quotes they're in scripture but they haven't seen the living word yet you hear what i said it have scriptures and quotes and arguments but living word it's a different thing altogether the word is invisible until it become flesh then the word that is invisible becomes visible so that living word is when that word become flesh when it thunders into your soul that the world can't see it they see the same outside view but on the inside seven rainbows demons moving out of the way all the way the holy one of israel that's what they said about jesus and when them seven colors begin to flash and settle we are talking about a living fate a living virtue a living knowledge and living temperance living patient living godliness living brotherly kindness at last seven living voices at last seven thunders let me bring this whole thing into perspective all that rejected the seven thunders since 1974 they are deceived only rejected it deceived why because seven thunders gather the bride sometimes get the right faith sometimes i should rather appear so they reject that since years ago did they have already got them hallelujah now in the thunders the devil had to come to see if you could get the rest yes the threats are church members so that god had been filtering all all along they shout called street kind of believers come here stand there give the lord a praise offering the shout the shout the shout message of malachi 4 called three kind of believers but the voice gonna call the elect oh glory to god hallelujah the shout all kind of spirits come up with a shout out the type you may be seizing israel when israel came out what came up dayton bunch of people come out everybody come out they're drifting out a mass movement everybody moving on so we move into hallelujah little did they know out of that whole bunch out of two million people two two out of a million joshua and caleb two out of one million people the oil was thought it was coming out all thought they were going out coming out is not good enough you got to go in got to go in got to go in praise god hallelujah you might be seated god bless you for that message that sunday rapture in faith things that are to be praise god things that are coming got to be in rapture in condition in order to make it you've got to get in condition and the condition the church is in right now it cannot meet the challenge of the hour what we will tell ebola that we're on patreon for what we're going to tell you it would be ola that we have jv at you what we're going to tell ebola we can't tell ebola no talk we have to tell ebola work we have the power to tell it when to go where to go and how to go oh get the lord some praises we are talking about manifestation of the power of god inner people true people by our people for our people oh hallelujah hallelujah this reminds me of a story i read about brother branham she said early days you want to be a cowboy another old horse you jump on the horse put the sat on it right of course put some some kind of picketing on their horse cochlear bull oh i saw all he couldn't move but he still had a good time you know on the horse and so on and whatnot he going by some cowboys rodeo and these are real you see some broken up cowboys men who custom breaking horses i'm at so they called somebody to break a horse and a no time at all the person fell off the horse and then blood to the man nose and mouth and ambulance coming and so on and a man he said was the time of depression he said give fifty dollars for anybody who could steer that hospital thirty seconds and he came to barbara and said are you a writer he said no sir he said that was a different one and that's what i'm talking about are you alright all this you could pretend to ride on an old horse but that horse is a different kind of horse we could pretend to be pride sitting in church but when the plagues when the conditions sent me an email this morning in texas the actually subpoena five teaches humans to see if they're talking against homosexual and gays and so on and the mayor of the of the saying she passed a law that that descended similar they want to read the simmons and send the silvers to see what they're preaching that's what i'm saying you don't even know if all of this is going to build up where they're going to shut the churches down because they're not doing what they want us to do and brother banham said they're going to close the churches down isn't that right that same prophet that said that say i saw america all bummed up and so on he saw that we're not even sure if america is going to reach the tribulation period because man never made a weapon he never used and russia keep talking talking talking the west want to press them and russia saying you know you can't do that you're talking to a real big man here they are the most powerful army on the earth how much threatening they will threaten them they will take so much and then nobody gonna act out the scriptures say we're gonna do but the scripture said what we have to do so so we have to make a church that would make a revival isn't that right we have got to make something maybe seated and in pennsylvania i describe what a goal is i want the reward is it's not the same a goalie could achieve a goal you have time with it you have stages you could go towards the goal we say if you're going to buy a car you said i'm going to buy i i'm going to have a buy a car and all you have with that in your mind that's not a goal until you set stages to get that car until you're going to put money and savings and sacrifice and then you could see us have won a backhand next year in the month of march and you know how much months ahead you know what you're going to get and so on that's a goal you can set a target that's a goal so that bride have a goal a earthly goal something she could achieve but the reward is something given to you for a behavior attitude both good and bad judgment and life that's a reward you cannot pressure it towards a reward you could behave and do and get a reward a reward is given and every age had a reward there have been seven rewards the new name is a reward the new name is not a goal i could preach that but it's not a goal but what you need to do is to get the goal because the goal is if you overcome you get a reward if you don't overcome you have no reward to get so we come to preach to you the target and paul said i press towards the mark of the high calling in christ jesus so we got to have a target that we have to get onto and when we hit that target we are deal we are right we have measured steps towards that goal justification we are on our way sanctification will be on our way god don't want you to stop there but we press into a position of the baptism of the holy ghost to be positionally placed in the kingdom of god oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah let's play through it all through it all i learned to trust in jesus you sit down let them play and just relax yourself oh hallelujah right now they are collecting dead bodies in liberia right now there's war in different places people running for their lives they have nice new babies they have nice little children and their bums and their heartaches and their pain and they're struggling for water and for food and and so on but i'm say the force anointed by the people to themselves by fear you see what isis does when they go into a village one place they cut out some heads hang it up then if you don't want your head cut off you behave yourself you fall in line what they do they generate fear fear but you know what perfect love does no man have a heaven and no man ever held nobody could keep you out of the kingdom you know what i told mpa even if they don't want me i will come to whosoever will so they can't get rid of me through it all right trust in god i thank god for the mountain i thank god for the valleys i thank god for the trials i've been through i never know what faith in this world can do but this morning hallelujah through it stand and shake somebody next to you testify to somebody one more time through it all through it hallelujah jesus yes i am praise god this morning i want to greet all those connected to us on the internet i want to greet by the roman bentryga and the bontragers and all those who were responsible for the meetings in pennsylvania it was a special meeting to me there was such a flow of the spirit and such an ancient wasn't much people but the unction of the spirit was there to speak what i believe the lord wanted us to speak and i believe god got glory in it all amen so this time we want to turn the bibles to matthew chapter 3 and we're going to read for 16 and 17 and one voice in matthew 4. are we going to read from luke 4 verse 14 to 22. matthew chapter 3 and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and low the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased chapter four verse one then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil luke chapter 4 reading from verse 14 and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and they went out of fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found a place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sight of the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord then he closed the book he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the single synagogue were fastened on him and he began to see unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear witness him witness and wandered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this joseph's son let us pray father we thank you for your words lord and your word is life father we are so needy this morning needy of your unction of your inspiration of your power the people here who are sick and lord they need your help and your intervention in their lives they're those that need deliverance need to break you need a touch need a baptism need power into their lives father may you come in your word and may the spirit move in your word and bring deliverance and heal them all and body mind spirit and soul in jesus name bless your word and interpret our hearts amen and amen you may be seated praise god and i want you to give god some praises if you know how important that is the devil's job to try to wipe out the praises of god and the worship and that worship creates the atmosphere in which the spirit could reveal things and that's what you need that's what you want salvation the ministry of jesus christ identified by prophecy i have an inspiration the life of the messiah manifesting making a bride ready that's actually from a quote the life of the messiah manifested making a bride ready so you notice our emphasis on power manifestation holy spirit dynamics inspiration not on mechanics so much we had that for 40 years ministry of the word we are looking for the life the spirit the power i will return unto you we're looking for another visitation of god jesus came in three sons name son of man son of david son of god the sequence of son of david david son of david is in the millennium so we could leave that out for now but son of man is prophet son of god is spirit so the prophecy was son of man to come and he came that was jesus the word of the lord is not i came through the son of man isn't that right and after jesus left son of god came in the upper room spirit seven ages was son of god but there's a prophecy look something to the son of man will return in the last days and son of man brings back seed so what follows son of man is son of god one son of man comes son of god follows because son of man is word and son of god is spirit solomon brings seed and son of god brings the water to the seed isn't that right so jesus himself couldn't give them the holy ghost he could only give them the promise received the holy ghost he was son of man and he gave them promises he came and unlocked the understanding he opened the mysteries of the new old testament and showed them the promise of joel scripture it shall come to pass i thought my spirit so he gave them the promise of the inheritance which in the natural was a land called canaan but in the spiritual was the holy spirit land hallelujah so in type coming out of egypt going into the land of canaan was coming out of the world and going into the holy spirit so the promise was always the spirit but he had a natural type in it back there so when jesus came he came to introduce the real land hallelujah the land of the spirit oh glory to god hallelujah isn't that right so jesus unlocked the understanding open the word to them and say go up and receive your promise and they did isn't there right and they wrote another book of acts they wrote a book of acts that was the first book the book of acts so after matthew mark luke and john was the book of acts was the wheel in the middle of the wheel turning in the book of acts was the terror fire in the book of acts it was not the acts of the apostles it was the acts of the holy ghost and the apostles the holy ghost was on the move the church was on the move the church the book of acts was guarded by the four gospels of matthew mark luke and john by the oxy land the eagle and the man hallelujah mark luke and john the oxy eagle and lion and the man they were god in the book of acts the axe was the wheel of god turning as to what the church will be the book of acts was the alpha church the book of after the church in operation the book of acts was adopted sons not ready yet to be changed in body because the time was not yet because redemption was not complete and the revelation was not yet fulfilled because god told daniel go that way the book is sealed till the time of the end so we have to wait for the end of time for the full mystery to be unfolded which will give us the open book the one with the seventh seal in it or give the lord some praises oh hallelujah hallelujah god said i am alpha and i am an omega he was in the alpha church he is going to be in the omega church and that is why when brother branham come but abram couldn't take us further he had to go back first because he came to turn our hearts back to the faith oh glory to god because the faith was jesus christ in the church oh give the lord a shout of praise that was the fate that was delivered this if the rapture was promised then those brothers going to rapture in them because they were fully redeemed in their soul and spirit it's just that body needed the power and that was a promise at the last day the last trump is not right this mortal shall put on immortality and we shall be changed so because it was not yet they went and fell asleep that's the story of the first church then the other churches the other ages are to fall away write in the book of jude and james that i can't rebuke them for having rich people in special places and tell them content for the fate fight back for the original argue for it debate for it amen make noise there stop being silent i want to challenge the culture of silence people seem wrong and saying nothing they wouldn't speak out they wouldn't ask a question just sit like dumb dogs and just sit still it's there's no room for that right now you have to come to spiritual maturity you know what ordinary believers that challenge them in that day in ephesians they found them who say they were apostles and found them to be liars and god commended the ephesians church for having that kind of guts and gumption to expose boss and expose what was hypocritical what was ridiculous what was unclean was forced doctrine unclean spirits they were on the word hallelujah give the lord a shout of praise and there is going to be a word church a church back to the bible some ministers feel they can't be judged they will be judged and they have to be judged they have to be checked out but i'm saying when a man gets some power he said try it see if it is right you have a right suppose lucifer sent him and lucy popping in his garment so the all right it's a try try the spirit because many false spirits has gone out many not few many so when we say check them out check them out you're supposed to check them out oh glory to god because brother branham had a life before he was adopted come on i want a bigger shout than that i want a bigger shot than that but ibrahim didn't get adopted to get the life he had a life and that life got adopted come on how many are standing so what is this ministry of jesus christ what is it the unsealing of the prophetic vision of perfection from under the seventh seal the ministry of jesus christ was prophesied it's from a prophetic vision of what must be fulfilled john said there is one standing among you john i was the prophesied that that ministry was coming here come the ministry walking down the banks of jordan here comes the spirit because that was the word jesus was the word here come the word in season call it the word right from age 12 to 30 he was getting ready from age 12 to 30 he's in the scriptures from age 12 to 30 he is preparing himself for the ministry it's the ministry of jesus christ and for him to get a start he can't come up and say i am you know who i am no we don't know who you are no you know who i am no he couldn't start like that that ministry had was to be introduced so john the baptist spirit of elijah was centered for ron the first coming here come christ have to wait it's 12 to 30 and then be anointed the spirit came down as a dove and said this is my son in whom i am well pleased it wasn't a minister's association consultancy program and when she signed up to get his head examined or his psychology or way or technique of preaching examine it wasn't if he was in the groove of the other ministers or ministries he was led by the spirit he was anointed by the spirit and the spirit led him into the wilderness to be tested not by men but by satan himself and when you see you could deal with satan you could deal with man oh god him good hallelujah are you with me he did not have class with that man giving me a fight and he upset me with what he say this is the devil himself he overcome the lust of the eyes come on now he overcome the lust of the flesh he overcome the pride of life he overcome lucifer and his offer lucifer give him an offer and jesus turn it down oh give the lord some praises people all these kingdoms are mine and if you bow down and worship me i will give them to you and you won't have to go to calvary you know where's jesus he wanted to put jesus as his ceo but he's the main man on top of that so jesus said no dice i'm going to pay the price i am going to pay that price isn't that right so then jesus went through his wilderness test or place of train after being anointed with the spirit in the fullness come on now with the fullness the fullness of the spirit came upon that example seed sun he is our example we have one example sweet son that was jesus what happened to him have to happen to me have to happen to you because that's the original way that is the way there is no other way you have got to be filled with the whole egos oh give the lord some praises people oh hallelujah i don't want nothing affect you from hungering and cursing after righteousness because jesus said blessed are that day that hunger and test after they righteousness be filled and save again they shall be filled how many want to be filled you are under promise to be failed now i'm going to make a shocking statement long time make a shocking statement but a good shock the ministers have to get the baptism of the holy ghost in this season to move forward even virtue power for service what they have now can't make it can't do it no it will take a power but that is what this promise god cannot release charity as charity no we're going to mess things up he has to get character and to get character he has to lose power that would send you to calvary that would send you into the wilderness now watch question all the ministers who preached by the banner message i don't care where they are any part of this globe that preach this message to go into the ministry of jesus christ the spirit have to come down upon them they or we i should say is i identify with the message but the messages have to become identified with us it's not the same thing right now on planet earth no minister have the ministry of jesus christ no man has that ministry and it takes that ministry to catch the headstone so where we are i'll say this way we have to get desperate let me give the next shock what around says what we need is a prayer meeting and say lord send down the adoption of the holy ghost in other words we have to come to that spot where you begin to realize that as you are you can't make it in other words you have to come to that spot where you say lord i've got to get that mark because the death angel was commissioned to take out i want to say it like i don't understand it to take them out hallelujah you know like a shooter shoot this one and take them out all who don't have the mark remember all that fell on the earth shall worship the peace except therefore if you see your name on that book how you should rejoice how you should bless god for the opportunity to sit down in church to hear this word put the mark who feel they have arrived put a mark on the arrogant no put the mark on the proud no no no no don't don't put them back there put a mark upon those who sigh oh god i can't take it no more you ever see somebody sign somebody in a stress a baby's sick a baby hospital you ever see a mother with a sick child or the mother sign they can hardly breed because they don't know if the baby is dying and the mother is cyan that's what we're talking about we're talking about the groaning we're talking about travailing when zion travail zion brought forth where is that in the message where is the preaching of the gospel to create in the house of the people a hungry for righteousness a thirsting for god like david he says the heart plant after the water brooks so my soul turns out to god to see the living god when shall he appear why where did the heathen rage and the people imagine the vain thing they say where is your god oh give the lord a praise offer him but you're going to see him you're going to see that god your god will come quickly and he will do right glory hallelujah glory to god man see this is it a burden for the fulfillment of prophecy a burden for the fulfillment of the word of god the three wise men caught jerusalem by surprise jerusalem should have known better because they were the holy place they had the holy people they were the people of god but they were out of the spirit of what was about to be fulfilled here come three men shaken up the country with a short quick message messiah is here somewhere somewhere on the earth there is anointed word here come three wise men coming to jerusalem with three powerful words where is he they didn't ask for a quote they didn't ask for the prophecy they didn't ask to listen to a tape they just had three words where is he born king of the jews where is he where is the fulfillment of all what the prophets have spoke where is the manifestation we have had interpretation for years we have had the ministry of the world for years show me where is here where is this messiah because it will take the life of the messiah to get the people ready we have our courts and the people still not ready we have mysteries and they're not ready we have history we have teachings we are teachers but it will take the life of the messiah and messiah is an anointed word somebody going to manifest that word somebody going to live that way that would have to live listen there is no more one-man message sit down you may be seated i was telling them and p the angel is a messenger i went to the whole bible to see what the angels does who it goes to what it see how it operates i got a quote abraham said the last time he just poked about six months ago the angel not resident in a building take a picture with me the angel is not playing games the angel came to the prophet and said i have been sent from the presence of god to tell you this to tell you that to tell you the other the angel calm the angel go where's the angel what about him said where the angel is he said the angel of god is on earth now fixing things are wrong for the coming of the lord so the angel on a job right now he's on the job he's on the job right now you're not going to stop him because he had been sent to fix up tinge he is fixing things this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he was fixing things in india yeah yeah he fixed things in pa2 he's on the earth fixing things are wrong oh hallelujah and the manifestation of the holy ghost is that angel trying to get the people back to the world why because he could only come down on the world you may be seasoned hallelujah going in coming along on foolishness god come along on this world in india while i'm not standing with anybody i'm standing with the word hallelujah you have a time to say what it happened right and have righteous righteous you know but i'm 35 foreign back one another you said that but you know back foolishness up you had to say this is that not that is this peter said this here is that this manifestation is that you have to work it up and say no that let me see what i fit into this no not that is this this is that oh hallelujah can't walk it back that way you see your car back no this time his friend and a friend staying with the word because god coming upon the world god will vindicate the word not flesh and blood for flesh i'm not the boss i am right you are wrong god not in that foolishness god with the word all right let's go a little further here now from adoption by the branham he said now if what notice the coming of the lord jesus is so close at hand until the spirit from way down here barely justification signification about the holy spirit no right into the time of the coming of the headstone the church here we go has got to be so perfectly like christ wait a minute not like church no we have that new year's message believers people looking messages they're looking like they're in the message because that's how they look they have a look have a look no he's not talking about looks he's talking about spirit of perfection when i first got baptized i came to the message in the lord these weapons and i went to the same taylor they went to so i get the same type of pre-parts and when i look in the mirror and saw that bleed pants i recognize i don't like that so much so i start to wear straight parts and when i walk over the straight pants they want to reverse backslidden by your pants you shall know them that's what we're talking about no reason nothing you how you look all right this is how you look right now if the spirit of christ is in you here we go it makes you live the life of christ no no he didn't talk at first right called brother olivia and said well they believe no i can't take them back to the rapture you're supposed to believe trump all right watch i said brother since when what you believe taken to the rapture you've got people believe what i think here i thought was life but obama said national force put israel in the homeland national force would put the people in the work of the churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride stop it you mean you don't join no sorry you don't apply in a form no no sorry you don't claim bb message long time and you're right no sorry the power have to put you in so without power you can't make it so you need power but thank god there's a promise x18 you shall receive power power is what is promised and you're going to find out what the power is but what the prayer power deliver holy life power to make things right power to overcome power to have fit you over the world over the lost or that's paul we talking about all what you're struggling with power to overcome that give the lord a shout don't you want that power don't you want to overcome but this is what god promised now watch the church has got to be so perfect like christ until christ and the church can unite together the same spirit and if the spirit of christ is in you it makes you live the life of christ act the life of christ do the work of christ we have got a ministry coming prophecy that's exactly like the life of christ that's not a trinidad ministry that's not an american ministry that's not a european ministry that's ministry that's exactly like the life of christ that's what he said he said what does that minister identify the coming of the lord and the lord come the shout the voice and the trump but was the shout the trump is his coming the only slot we could identify is the voice in other words these words have to become voices these words have to become a manifestation in your life peter had it in word form peter had it in mechanic form peter was afraid peter denied christ peter run for his life and then peter you went fishing after three years of no vision amen no time at all as soon as years gone them fellas they go fishing we go fishing too and they go on and do their own thing just out for them and i say we will go in come back i have to talk to you you are the man that i choose you have a purpose in life you didn't fully understand you give them some heart rebukes and they begin to break the bread to them because he knew that they have to they are going to be the conductor of the spirit then he knew they have to become the very word itself they lack understanding they lack revelation they lack the word of being open to them so with a resurrection ministry private ministry he appeared to them peace be unto you as my father sent me so send are you what's that prophecy as my father isn't me he's gonna be in you too oh glory to god as i live by my father you're gonna live by me oh glory to god as i reveal my father you'll reveal me oh hallelujah and jesus was the revelation of god and they became the revelation of jesus christ hallelujah that's why they take note that they've been with jesus because it was walking like jesus they were talking like jesus they were healing like jesus they were acting like jesus they had to take note they had been with jesus because jesus was living in them oh give the lord a household to pray and jesus gonna be living in you how many believe that that's the promise i am alpha and omega i was in the first church i'm going to be in the last church oh glory to god amen praise god glory brother branham did exodus he's talking about the spiritual man can look down in egypt see the persecution rise see joseph taken away in order that the persecution could rise joseph did a great job but god will take joseph out of the way for the persecution to rise so certainly how they move out of the way for other things to come and take its place isn't that right see what if i reject joseph see the light toll see joseph in prison his beard growed out excommunicated from his brethren then all of a sudden god moved in oh we can see the wheel in the wheel moving god great plan moving everything up to this exodus watch when he would call his people back in the land again back in the place watch in position where he could bless them and place among them the one that he promised he would place among them he they had to be in their land remember they had to come out of the land that they were in to get into the land of promise before the promised messiah could ever come hallelujah and the church here we go has to do the same thing get out of that group of rejecters over into the promise before messiah can ever be manifested before them that's why they're going to be an exodus from groups and churches all the people that reject the full atonement yes when the spirit begin to move the spirit will connect with the seeds that is in the elect in every group in every church across the entire world but i brought him said the holy ghost will go across the world overnight overnight the holy ghost going to go across the world and connect with every predestinated seal right now the minister is only fooling with the human spirit and with their mind they can't touch the soul in the heart of the elected because that is the wife of the lamb i don't care if you have alzheimer's i don't care if you go plummet in your head that has nothing to do with the seed that's inside of you that god placed before the foundation of the world glory i don't care if you're going nuts and you're going to mental institution that has nothing to do with the seed in your soul that there is a liar this morning hallelujah so what abraham said he said watch you see it the congregation said amen the life of a messiah the life of the messiah manifested making a church already a bribe that's where i get inspiration from the life of the messiah manifested not talked this is what we have for 40 years promises and talk 400 years they're expecting moses right they don't know his name they're expecting deliverer because i bring my people out so generation of the generation said he's coming gods and deliver is our god we're talking about god's term in the bondage because behavior has bring bondage judgment destruction i read that scripture remember exactly where it first where god sent our angels to destroy jerusalem and the inner beginning destroyed he said god the bible says god repented and totally injured it is enough stop it is enough man they want to repent but god repented that he said stop it is enough stop it's enough god god said my people engrave in the palm of my hands i can't forget israel that's his people the bible said think about it he came unto his own and his own receive him hallelujah glory notice what happened son of man come jesus christ preach manifest christ to them manifest god to them he keeps saying the same oxide who you're gonna do they can't do one thing at that hour but you know what he's prophesying he's telling them if you shall say this mountain be moving don't talk to anyone you can have what you say he keeps dropping what they will become jesus didn't talk to them where they were he keep speaking where they will be oh give the lord i shout people stop talking about where you are where do you want to go this morning you're born crippled oh make a you got an accident jesus wasn't that small talk he tried to tell them pick up the bed and walk in other words i see you walking get up get up from there i see you revived i see you shield i see you fail i see you delivered get up from there pick up your bed and walk jesus always pointing them to where they're supposed to go where you want them to be he cursed the fig tree master the picture traveling he said don't watch that if you shall say you can imagine how they went from that day they say you know what jesus divine shall say that are you saying nothing they wasn't ready to say anything they didn't know they couldn't say nothing but jesus you know sometimes we do that we hold back on people because we feel not ready yet listen a baby eagle is those big ones in small form you see all what that big one is doing that little one could do too it's just that little one as big as that yet but we are getting there you know when people get older just figure yeah i want to pray for them i see by my favorites on my night something god heal them so i'm not praying for those ideas for them today and go take them home safely safely to that show no that they could be healed because god is a healer do you understand that this transformation this rapture is the level of divine healing your body is being changed into your immortal condition do you understand that cf can only go after death but faith takes you to the resurrection do you understand that we are the first people on earth that will be dead proof you're not getting me you're not getting me you said i'm saying that we are the first people on earth that certified that proof we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment before your blinky eye be gone go on go on hallelujah hallelujah ringing the pastor he's not there he's gone glory hallelujah we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye hallelujah hallelujah why because we bypass autophagy oh eternal body word body and come down on his head to be tempted to be tested jesus did not bypass theophany he came from thought to word to flesh so he knew all things but we are going back to know all things because we're going back to the world where at that day you shall know and the bible said you know in part and probably sign part but when that which is perfect is come but then you shall know as you are known you shall know as you are known you don't really know how you are known here but jesus gave a hint he said father glorify me with the glory i had with thee before the world was because they were in me and the glory we had we share with them because they were with us before the foundation of the world so we are not from trinidad we are not from this world we come from god we go back to god the devil is alive this morning we have got to be filled because the holy ghost is your expression peter no much when jesus opened an understanding open the wood to them peter didn't say well you know what i know who i am now i don't have to go to no upper room i am the word but the wood is a seed so what peter will be saying i am a seed if you don't get water on that seed you'll remain a seed for a very long time so what jesus was telling them when you get the revelation that you are the seed of god the word you go in that room and call for water because the water when that water hit the seed the devil is in trouble now satan hold it satan underestimated the staggering he misinterpreted that he didn't read it well he thought they were drunk he thought they were excited he thought they were pentecostals because we in the message and we pass the pentecostals so we're not supposed to shout and dance and shake up and no no we're not we we are past all of that so when the devil thought was there's a pentecostal behavior and they came out staggering up a room and preaching peter preaching gospel going back to jesus and saying this same jesus god has beat lord and christ that was fine the devil said okay tell me some more wake me up what i'm saying the devil turn over and abandon sleep when peter walked to the gate called beautiful and the man crippled it everybody knew and peter didn't have extra change to give him a little drink and peter said sylvain go have i none but such as i have i i give it unto you rise up and walk in the name of jesus and that man walked that was the talk that that man walked that was the talk the talk wasn't what peter said at the day of pentecost the talking tongue was that man who walked when peter talked to that man he had to walk when you talk to the he has to walk you talk to the blind that's right enough to see it you talk to the dumb that don't have to speak because jesus walking again not the third person not the second person but the only person the person of god veiled in his people oh hallelujah when the devil saw that they never said with a man this is serious let's call a meeting emergency emergency meeting was called in hell he said no we have to stop it immediately we can't let his fire spread we call it his glory spread we can't let this anointing spread jesus was one man and he was on fire it looked like other men get recruited it looked like they are terrorists in my kingdom i can handle that right now we can't lose this holy ghost terrorism upon us we can't lose faith and virtue this knowledge and temperament we can't lose this kind of people with character but metal with spirit with humility with simplicity with godliness with holiness with righteousness we can't hold them the loose in my kingdom oh hallelujah the devil in trouble this morning we're gonna walk right we're gonna talk right we're gonna live right the voice is gonna thunder what we seek and justinville is thousands of your voices so you may be seated they arrested them put licks on them or if they were baby believers maybe believers when they got arrested they would be saying we should not be arrested because we are sons of god don't talk about lexi my father beat me since i was that child but just for these firefighters they put legs on me i do deserve it i'm entitled not to be beaten i'm entitled not to be you gotta go back and read again mature again because you have no entitlement he leads you this way he leads that way and when they got licks listen they get blows you know it's not like spank on the hand go home go home no the lakes was to discourage any power manifestation that was like isis licks them that was saying don't you move no power business again no no raise no dead no heal no sick quiet shh if they were immature people they standing sickly for the service i said i have to take two three two weekends off because i really already feeling body feeling beat up but not these people they gather in service and they say lord strengthen us empower us give us more power to go out there to be witnesses because jesus said you shall receive power you shall be witnesses unto me so give us power and they were filled again but the holy ghost and the building was rocking by the purple building was shaken under the anointing of the holy ghost that wasn't afraid of their trials it wasn't afraid of pressure there was no fear of tribulation stop being so soft stop being so flimsy you may be seated ram said long time the woman didn't have a washing machine they had chicken board they had spent plenty of time to wash their clothes now they have washing machine i had enough time to waste the one full or wrong men come home they're going cut logs like the fire to cook food go on hunt good old days but we improve modern man amen those i know this speed the horse have a maximum and you're not breaking that max so even though you want to go faster you got to work with him you have to work with them you have to work with them no one can just press gas and move but in those days you have to work with what you got well we're working with what we got we got power in the name of jesus i want to disturb you i want to disturb your spirit i want to i want you to disturb me i want you shaken up yeah yeah i want you shaking up that's why when you get licks don't come and i said little less licks no less slicks sometimes you need more legs shake you up to see what you're gonna do you're gonna say lord give me something power lord if i get power back over there more likes you don't wanna licks so lord hold back the power because i don't wanna go there yet you're not ready when you're ready it doesn't matter what licks what blows if your husband carry on your wife carry on your children carry on your neighbor carry on your boss carry on other church people carry on that doesn't matter god have people to put pressure on you and god love to see you get pressed you know why all of that is a rehearsal for when the press come down you know a real press come in people laughing but listen he talk about the press you talking about closing known churches he told me when you're pressed out what you think pulling god have to send a rehearsal was always coming you know israel didn't know that think about it they were fighting conquering gulag coming he's coming they don't want it yet it's two hills you know mountain and mountain there's a valley between the two mountains on that mountain when they came send us a man and they on this side say which man because we have no man big like that he want a physical fight david don't know go ahead come in but david getting a rehearsal on first phase and second phase because until phase a giant is coming you see when brother brown see that man get two of the horse and fallen and blood come on an ambulance coming when a man say you're a rider he said no sir but he came to right here but when he saw that he reckon is he not qualified for that know that you've fallen off of that your man said get 50 dollars for 30 seconds no sir i watch it i like that you don't bluff your way in that sense you don't do that you will perish brother brianna went on south africa there was a witch doctor a real one in that bogus one who taking people money for do what kind of foolishness but this one is the real one he has real witchcraft that a big tent and the man cast a spell and the tent was moving off and rocking and bomb rebuke and the man sent back a spell and the tent had a rock and she can rebuke afterwards he said bang you you have to bind the source itself all night it's like a tennis match you serve i serve you survivor forget that buying the ban buying a strong man you can't sell nothing we're going to bang the strong man oh hallelujah give the lord our shelter praise oh hallelujah hallelujah this is not a game who if this is real there is a real power of god and there's a report on satan and you come to church to get empowered with the power of god by the word of god oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god glory to god hurry the corner man we have a little clip a little less than three minutes click on the facebook page i'll click from india and see them those brothers in india rejoicing and dancing see when the holy ghost had to move and the presence of god started to come down i know they rejoice like anybody else you see the holy ghost have one behavior whether it fall in india in africa in china in europe and wherever it is in trinidad is one lord is one faith is one baptism it's one holy ghost it's one lord and of all hallelujah isaiah saw the lord high and lifted up high and lifted up trail filled the temple and when i saw i went there what happened to him he fell as deadly he said where is me i'm undone a man of unclean lips isaiah said lord me and you we are there so i didn't say that as i was broken when john gets in that glory he fell daniel fell all of them one behavior but abram was slamming a room he said you no blessings but you don't know the power reverent fear of god the power of god when the fire came on the mountain mount sinai the people said don't let god speak let moses speak god let moses put some rope around the mountain he said any animal anything cross that kill it kill it because the unholy ghost let him cross that map don't cross that line if you cross it kill it this is not man this is god we're talking about he's no respecter of man he's gonna get glory satan angle beat him on this one he's gonna get glory satan gonna satan came down and god's eden and now god himself come along and satan eden according to first thessalonians 4 the lord himself descends with a shout to get his people out hallelujah so i didn't come in this message to remain here and die in good old age no i came here to accomplish a purpose i wanted to be fulfilled god expect you to give more to do more to add more he said after your faith virtue you may be caesar now watch the most we could receive is revelation amen at the first level and at that level that's faith but virtue is power and power comes from god that power is spirit so faith brings down spirit or faith brings down the power of god it takes faith to anoint the power of god so when you come to church you are not in power for your life you can't be satisfied just to be a normal human being you're too ordinary no you ought to be like samson a parrot a spirit the spirit has to come upon you when you feel it you could run when you feel it you could jump when you feel it you know you are alive unto god your child of god your son of the god is with you there's no weapon form against you're going to prosper then you can make a table in the presence of your enemies then the lord is with me that would ever say the lord is with me harlow david knew that the lord is with me oh glory to god said i look under the hills for once come on my help they will never set out good fighters behind them but here david i look under the hills from once come with my help and all the men had a sword behind david i look under the hills someone's calling my help my help comes from the lord and all his swordsmen behind him all his fighters behind him but he's looking under the hills from whence my help we have not been this way before demons will be cast out people are going to walk blind on the sea they're going to be raised i prophesied you're going to see the ministry of jesus christ hallelujah this is promise it's your promise which promised jesus after he overcome the devil three while attacks he went in the power of the spirit at first the spirit came upon him and the spirit left him as it was in the wilderness to deal with the devil with the word alone that's the word dry word beer word will but no anointed just the scriptures it is written it is written it is also written that's what you overcome right not power not i command you satan no no no he wasn't doing that no he wasn't doing that either just it is written it is written and when the devil wanted to play the word game he said it is also written it is also written and he will overcome you keep walking through the wilderness within willingness is not forever please are trying to forever testing that forever keep on walking now don't stop don't stop you don't get stick in the window keep walking so the spirit hits him here he's filled with the holy ghost we're going to start right here have a certain point an ending point walking through the boat it's dry it's dusty nobody around there's no digging to help you no elder no comforter nobody encourages you no song could comfort you no you alone oh like you're going to hell but you're going to keep on going now you're going to make it we're gonna keep on walking now and all of a sudden you break out hold jesus return power of the spirit come back upon jesus and the power led him to the word come on now come on now power didn't have him swinging on a tree the power of the nominees bringing in church the power led him to the scriptures give the lord a shout out praise power will lead you to the word of promise because the word i promise god identify the target the goal the objectivity of the operation of this power that god has released so jesus was going to identify the purpose of the spirit being upon him he said the spirit is upon me quote in isaiah 61 for he had anointed me for this purpose hope on the blind eye heal the sick praise the dead proclaim jubilee and declare the day of vengeance of our god he left that part out because he knew a bride mrs jesus will come in the last days to pick up where he left off you didn't know what i'm saying mrs jesus will pick up where he left off mrs jesus is a continuation of jesus he is the world and she's a continuation of the variable itself and jesus pronounce the scripture and listen he made a bold statement he made it present tense no blind heal yet no of walk yet and he said this day this is as good as fulfilled done consider it finish considered accomplished consider it sealed it is already done hallelujah i'm already in the ministry despair this scripture is fulfilled in your air in other words he was saying it's no longer on paper it's no longer in isaiah 61. it's jump out hallelujah it's alive he is saying the word has become flesh he is saying the word is alive today all glory this day the scripture is fulfilled oh glory glory what a day whatever what are they what a day for you to come to your day you will come to your day and you can say this day is my day you know the next question is not this joseph son my god this is the same man we know did the same man helping joseph cut wood in the carpenter's shop is that this joseph's son how is he speaking like that how could he anoint that huh how could he do that that had to be jews if son isn't it's not joseph's son hallelujah no oh oh yeah oh yeah he was joseph sandra perfection oh hallelujah hallelujah son of perfection jesus was the perfection he was the son of perfection oh glory to god the word made flesh and it could be made fashion in your flesh do you believe that hallelujah glory to god brother branham whoa a man marry a woman disagree with him it will be a fuss continually but when a man and his wife his girlfriend his ex-spouse when they're in perfect harmony like one soul one man they're gonna be one flesh and when the church can get into such harmony with god you know all the quotes i have read so if i haven't do it mysteries teaching knowledge intellect i know it has nothing to do with that harmony with god until the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride because they're going to be one oh hallelujah you see brother branham he's standing looking helpless he preached a message sometimes he's not a deep message hard message and then he said you know what i'm waiting on i'm waiting on the angel of the lord i don't know if he'll be here i don't know if he will come be waiting upon the regional lord and he keep talking a little bit talking a little bit talking honestly but he's here now the people who sit in the community and they don't know he's there they haven't seen him because they don't have eyes yet to see it unless god open their eyes but but rather he is here he says i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god glory say one time paul gives testimony one time there was a child had some spirit kind of epileptic person like that and balaam prayed on the child the spirit didn't move and burn said there's something wrong and he looked up in the congregation and saw a man on the balcony he said he said would you all bowl your heads and close your eyes and the man keeps standing there watching he said would you boy your head and close the eyes and then baram prayed he said lord don't let that unbelieving spirit or something like that or that disrespectful or whatever stop the healing of this child i was a little girl and when the devil leave that girl it fell on that man a man fell off the balcony plumb of the balcony the man and wife came up above the bomb after service is it barbara that's my husband he's a minister he and me no wrong harm i'm praying that this spirit come up for him i can't help him he crossed the line you could cross the line don't cross the line he's a minister but all the prophet said was bow your head close your eyes this is a spirit here this is not something it's a spirit that's here in other words be respectful be reverent god going to bless you that's all that's what we're talking about when the angel is there the power is there i mean god glory get glorified look how much years but i see a person's shadow unto death they have cancer keep talking about it until somebody took a picture and i see the big black hood over the person you see the darkness did that come to death and when they're prayed for that darkness leaves he could see death over people and that could leave people light could come over your life it had many times people in darkness and all of a sudden light come and push back to darkness don't think that your state is permanent don't think that your condition you have to be who you are no you could be released today yeah you could be free today hallelujah hallelujah praise god amen praise god so whatever adam said now watch when this going to be when all is going to be fulfilled he said i'm going to visit you i'm going to visit you a corny time of life you're going to have that baby you're waiting on the latter rain is fixing to fall so you slip this in you have hold that seed long enough now unbelieving you are looking for the coming son that's the real church today that's the elected seed you're looking for him and i'm going to send him to you oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god how are this going to come about how this ministry going to come true by acts 1 8. sin john 1 11 12 as many receive him to them gave me power to become the sons of god so in other words no minister could claim to have the ministry without power that makes no sense you must have virtual power watch faith alone won't do it you shall receive power the seven thunders give faith that alone can do it it has to take virtue power so the power is the promise of dynamics a refilling of the holy ghost isn't that right charity coming down village virtue to give the bride us our revival to give the bride virtue power to make that seventh undersea live because that word in you have to be activated before you're going to wilderness before you go into willingness you can't go in willingness without spirit coming upon you because the spirit have to lead you there are you with me the spirit have to lead you there so the seventh thunder manifestation will be the real revival not the seventh under preaching or teaching or interpretation but the seven thunder manifestation he promised a manifestation isn't right blessed being of the lord and brother branham said our molina foundation for a short quick message for that will shake the whole nation and i believe that message is going to be dynamics to our mechanics isn't that right where we could have jews everybody got manifested where the virtue could be flowing out the minister flowing out to the people i understand brother branham had like something around him and on the platform you will see people come up and barack said don't be afraid that's just his presence a woman has come up with him and as she come like she just bounced back there was something around him that was the coat that was the glory that was the presence that is what he had that is what the bride gonna have also a power a presence a glory around your life then you are protected you are shielded hallelujah by the glory of god the devil have to get permission to approach you oh glory to god amen so jesus had power isn't that right the bible said a woman with a blood issue she touched him she said i felt the power come out of me that must happen are you with me glory to god of power isn't that right so jesus promised this ministry to his bride called the fate isn't that right syndrome 14 12. the same works i do shall do also sin mark 16 these signs shall follow never believe the bible said the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs for one of the miracles the lord himself went with them they were going and the lord going with them too the angel with them too fire with them too power with them too where you go god going oh glory to god the witness of the lord is with you you'll even have to speak it will speak for itself god will vindicate you as his daughter and vindicate you as his son do you believe that so brother branham left us a short message with a promise of dynamics he didn't release dynamics he gave us a message with the prophecy of dynamics just as jesus gave them a message with receiving the holy ghost behold i send you the promise of the father oh glory to god i will not leave you confidence i'm gonna come to you oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord isn't that right hallelujah praise god do you believe that now so we are looking for the spirit isn't that right to come down upon the bride dynamics of the holy ghost to come upon a bride as virtue powerful service the same spirit that came upon jesus has got to come upon you isn't that right you have a holy ghost promise how many understand you have a holy ghost promise say i have a holy ghost promise save again i have a holy ghost promise say it one more time i have a holy ghost promise oh glory to god amen hallelujah give the lord i shout i pray glory glory this is brother joseph coleman and it almost appears as if god by design had a journey for the bride after brother madame left that the bride helped us to pass through as it was new york city because brother branham himself said there is something about new york city and that something was a ministry that got placed there to bring more light in the world now hear this what he said we cannot have an in-between ministry between pentecost and the ministry of jesus christ we have to wait for the ministry of jesus christ otherwise we in pentecost are being a revelation of seven thunders seven manifestations not only will you hear the truth seven thunders but it will be a manifestation of expression from the inward parts will come out in the spirit and love divine what is he saying there is no in between ministry so when peter of them got their understanding open and the word they had to wait so right now we are waiting we have no power in ourselves we have to wait till dynamics come dynamics will produce further power for service that will lead us into the wilderness to be formed into the word image and then when seven virtues are formed charity come to cap the whole thing attack sons and place them in this glorious ephesians ministry hallelujah now you will understand when the prophet says when a church has grown in that the holy ghost is just as real as it was to their pentecost how they groan and travail and cry but when they are born and positionally born then god sets in the church think about it 40 plus years have gone 50 years since what abraham left and there are ministers and pastors all around the world not yet pleased the inheritance have not yet been divided joshua had a threefold purpose take the people over are you with me conquer the land two three divide inheritance are you with me when the holy ghost came on pentecost it was divided tongues of fire sat on each of them each of them got the liquor fire each of them got their portion each of them walk out there with something nobody will tell peter peter i feel like to talk in a hula pull back no no peter knew what he had to do peter was pushed because he had the key to unlock the kingdom so peter stepped forward under the inspiration of the holy ghost and said this is that that the prophet jewel speak of every man was led by the spirit philip did not consult anybody to go to the ethiopian eunuch philip left the revival led by the spirit go to the chariot of ethiopian eunuch to witness jesus to him peter had to consult no one to go to cornelius coast the spirit was leading the spirit was directing the spirit was in charge the cap was amongst them hallelujah paul led by the spirit buster rebuke and rebuked peter and straight them out and peter led by the spirit humble himself because paul spoke the word and what paul spoke was right oh hallelujah they were godly they were rugged they were gutsy they were directed by god there was no lead man it was the church on the moon so i want to say since barack obama have died there is no vacancy for his position no man needs apply there is no vacancy god used brother coleman an individual a certain way and after he left the land has to be divided and i will tell you something joshua buster rebuked in joshua 18 he said how long are you so slack i told them brothers in india are safe only waiting for somebody from america england trinidad wherever they come to give all your inheritance i say oh yeah you are lazy i didn't preach any convention i told you to be ministers i said you were lazy i said because joshua said why are you so slack to go and possess i said nobody around you would have have um the mention of jesus christ i don't see god the fight for ministry speaking english i say god can speak hindi too speak spanish any language because when the holy ghost came known there were different people of different languages there and they said oh here we in our own language so when god came down in their pentacles they were hearing their own language the words that was being spoken as peter spoke it god was translating it you're not hearing me you mean just that we need a translator god help us whoa that'll be good that'll be good you're preaching and people hearing in their own language friendship in french spanish here in spanish everybody could come to the revival everybody could come to a convention no more translation needed oh what a revival that gonna be back to the day of pentecost hallelujah glory to god think about it philip was translated no more visa you don't need a plane right you see it when you're playing tickets think about it feel like going canada this evening and you're going to ghana whoa hallelujah praise god you're walking straight to the pulpit you could invite you to the pulpit hey member of you is coming right now i want to pray when service is over i'm going back training hallelujah what back in trinidad my god science don't know nothing about that what you think that is impossible that's something tough listen to this one peter had guards with chain next to him on each side it had guts outside the door and the angel came and get peter out of that and get him out of the prison prison clothes and they called him men to ask them where is the prisoner where they say well by all checks and everything is in position everything the door closed the mainland we explain this that's a paradox see when they can explain it that's incredible but true and something about the break in your life that gonna be just incredible but true that's a paradox hallelujah cannot be explained oh hallelujah jailed up locked up and god the angels said follow me quickly and follow him straight out free him from that prison and i feel somebody going free from their prison prison in your mind prisoners of your past prison of your failure prison of your fears prison of your sins prison of what happened in your life whether he was 12 years old 13 15 years old you have prisoner of the past god free you come out quickly give the lord some praises musicians come up please oh hallelujah glory hallelujah glory to god amen oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord praise god it's a virtue power for service virtue the person a hidden mystery brahman says the person of christ in you without sensation performing signs wonders and miracles but obama what is the holy ghost given for he said long as god got a people god's got a church god's got the holy ghost matching with it that's what god gave the holy ghost for intellectual rights always have but god's got a minority somewhere god's got a little church that will move right on with the baptism of the holy ghost to claim in the light and they'll be the ones that through their testimony will judge the world then the bible says jesus said blessed are the pure heart that they shall see god and the other one said the same shall judge the earth your testimony today will bring judgment against the city our testimony of the baptism of the holy ghost and the power of god a holy life will bring judgment against the city oh glory to god them that are first i will be last he said watch and so will you and through that by the scattering of our light and the bottom holy spirit and by the light that you live and the things that god has done to prove that he's moving here with the intellectuals walk away from it they'll be judged by the saints oh my i was talking about power of prayer power of speech power for holy life that is what the holy ghost is to do you hear what the holy ghost is to do give your power of speech power of prayer power deliver holy life some of you people say i can't quit drinking i can't quit this the holy ghost come to live in you to make all these counts get away from you hallelujah or what you can't stop doing he will put the canter in you oh glory to god isn't that right praise the name of the lord here where we go it's a gift unction to the preacher that's what the holy ghost is for it's to give holiness to the group that's what the holy ghost is for it's the church in order that's what the holy ghost is for it's to bring a unity of the spirit that's what the holy ghost is for it's to unite us together with power it's to unite us together with love brotherly lord oh give the lord some praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah nobody said this he said upon this subject of what the holy ghost he said now what what is it now the reason i have taken this subject in this line like this you cannot come and receive the holy spirit unless you know what it is you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and for you and then you cannot know whether they got it unless you know what results it brings so if you know what it is who it's too and what action it brings then it comes then you'll know when you get it what you get when you get it oh praise the name of the lord do you believe that we are the end time listen that the holy ghost does the holy ghost by justification just a light shadow of it the holy ghost by signification a deeper shadow of it the holy ghost by the baptism a deeper shadow now the holy ghost by the restoration of its very person being here the very person of christ has to restore back to the church he said then we are worshiping the living christ him moving in and out among us hallelujah that's the seventh on the revival oh glory to god amen hallelujah what is this vision to do to hone the bride to a statue of perfect man oh am i almost done here now not almost but i'm gonna wrap up that's the way that jesus is going to have to be honed on the word horn in the church until when christ comes to take the church the ministry the church will pick up right on it will raise up luther and wesley and so on oh praise god he said first line justification restaurant by three certification the button only goes what is it you know this is not preached this is not preached they're not preaching this you have to come to justification that's where it goes and then what the horning that's what the ministry is for you see if there is no horn and there is no need for fightful ministry the fifo ministry have to produce the finishing touches for the bride by the word yeah we said watch watch the holy ghost bunch being honed out you can't hone some weird bunch it has to become a holy ghost bunch only the holy ghost bunch could be honed the word hone in israeli using metal work with fine to cut metal to find measurements and so on because brother find precision because the pyramid is accurate it is sharp bronzer impassa razor blade it is honed so he said the bride has to be honed to be fitted in so you have to be willing to adjust your attitude and your position to allow the spirit to work on you because it's not you fitting you have to get cut to fit that you have to get cut to fit your position god is not adjusting the position some self-adjusting as you get wide and you you do this it bend to suit you no god have a cut pattern and we cut get cut to that pattern isn't that right now the pentecostals have to shape their themselves in condition to receive the headstone it have to be so horned that there won't be a song or hammer or buzz of denomination it's already cut out well i'm going to skip down oh hallelujah ah so but abandoned said this this is a nice one from conferences he said when the church here we go so in the early days he talked about horn and as you get further down conferences this is 1963 8th of june he said when the church gets honed into the perfect image of jesus christ he will come and resurrect all the saints when he comes and take them with him amen so he fine-tune it to horn into the image in other words you have to be formed into the world image we often say that image is like material like this building here is a building this make of cement and and and and and steel and so on but but the thing about it if you have cement and steel and bags and gravel that's not a building that is material you know when you get the drawing and you start to build and shape it you have formed it into a building well okay but a brand bought materials and that material could make up the building he said rapturing faith is leaning the messages in other words all the material to hit the rapture is in the message but god going to raise us some scientists some ministers some people that are going to dig and get the material and put it all together isn't that right here i'll close you this one like this part here watch how close it gets to that razor edge now between right and wrong remember it will fall on on on on the other side till it comes something like a horn razor between the difference of right and wrong it must be every word not almost every word but every word hallelujah praise god he said come on come on to a razor edge between right and wrong oh praise god i believe there's coming a church that's coming into that perfection that ministry of perfection where the officers apostles prophet teachers evangelists them pastors and teachers will be so with the word until the whole thing will work itself right up to the coming of the lord oh praise god the ministry of the bride the ministry of christ this isn't a token these former treaties of theophilus that i wrote to you that jesus began to do and continues to do his death didn't stop him no sir he returned again not a third person but the same person returned again in the form of the holy ghost to continue to work on which is another book of acts oh hallelujah i'm going to run it straight down the conclusion i want to get something from barakuman here and brother branham talk about david's ministry pompeo fake strength he says watch he said it will not take a doctor he said we know what we need a revival we know we need a stone amongst the people it will not take a doctor of divinity it will take weeks that it will take the work word of god in the power of the resurrection and slay this thing we need a david untrained in theological schools we need a man who knows nothing about that some little plow boy or something some little guy with stupid shoulders not much to look at but walking on the road with the power of god oh praise the name of the lord so brother bulma was saying this here inspiration came down and he said the rock confession revelation of christ is directed to the intellectual giants stone in the forehead this is the holy spirit right now the rock of revelation would slay every one of them the church intellectual things intellectual powers david ministry is finally going to come on the scene and slay goliath on the forehead when the revelation of jesus christ go to all different places what it will lay goliath flat and you will see the sheep of god come streaming forth when the real david takes that stone of the rock of the revelation of jesus christ when that david stands out there with a confession of what the seventh seal is here is and what the power of god is and he can prove it on the spot it will smash into goliath forehead and all the intellectual forces tense white horse will be scattered there will be one more ride and here it is he said it exploded in my heart the holy spirit spoke to me and said the following the manifested sons of god will step forward in this vorder gap and bring up the mysteries of my malachi for one the manifested sons will reveal the mysteries left by malachi 4 which are already revealed as the revealed word oh hallelujah isn't that right only his ministry christ ministry can come forward the fifo ministry and bring it up and show it to you the others cannot do it none of the builders can take us dignitaries cannot do it because they're not ordained to do it the manifested sons will reveal the mysteries left by malachi 4 which are already revealed ephesians 4 11-13 is this ministry the manifested sons shall speak by prophecy and revelation the testament of jesus is the spirit of prophecy they will write by they will by revelation rightly divide the word of god and according to ephesians 4 they will reveal the secret things and place them in the word the manifested sun ministry was left on purpose for these past 36 years just waiting for dynamics to manifest the fifo ministry which will be christ so then the voice angel moves over to ephesians four this will take place watch you mean jesus will be in them okay no he will call them forth and they will go after the lord sheep hidden under revelation 22 17. this five-fold ministry will not cut off people they have to have a voice and the voice of the fifo ministry and the bride will be revelation 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come that is going to be the final ride to the entire world because in there of whosoever will come also so indeed your family your loved ones your co-workers whoever they could come because that voice gonna be in the bride that means the bride then becomes the word and the spirit that came upon jesus comes upon the bride so the spirit the bride and the prophet will be saying the same thing come whosoever will it's the final call so we can't do like if heaven shorts of seats and because heaven shorts a seat we keeping people out heaven have lots of room in case you didn't know all right so watch the fifo ministry has been teaching the word of god and the ministry of the word will come forth under the ministry of the spirit to quicken the bride here we go they can only comfort by dynamics not by preaching mysteries teaching mysteries unfolding mysteries no dynamics they can do nothing in themselves this faithful manifested son's ministry must come true number one here we go they must be born again to begin with by the baptism of the holy ghost number two they have to go into a place of trying to add the life of second peter one four through seven because the life of this virtue is not a gift if this life was a gift all god has to do is to give it to you but this life is character and character is never a gift character is a victory so they have to have tests place that trying grace of the wilderness jesus was led by this work into the wilderness character is what puts there god because i got some praises just about a few more minutes undone but i've got to get this through do you say amen hello amen hallelujah okay they have to go through the place of trying to get the life of second peter 1 427 and galatians 5 22 which is joy love peace not anger temper and hate and malice and strife and jealousy and envy and just plain don't write spiritual wickedness that is not galatians 9 nine is peace love joy long suffering meek his gentleness long suffering not short suffering all right how can you say jesus in you and this is not the lie i have life there's no way then charity okay okay come back up a bit they have the life of second peter 147 galatians 5 22 23 that will have to be a requisite listener spot they have to have that life or they will not be fifo ministry because that is jesus i said this way in pennsylvania the fifo ministry is jesus in the form of five offices it's not man saying you know who i am i am one of the fool no is that man trying to be in the full it is jesus life manifesting in these offices you need the evangelist a fireball to win souls you need a teacher to nail down the word of god you need a pastor who would anchor the people and deal with the issues among the people you need an apostle to go out and help support the churches and bring instruction you need all the gifts you need a prophet as it was you need all the kids to have its place it is god manifested indeed different attributes and offices now what there's no way then charity comes down after their season out sanification behavior and your behavior is your person how you behave how many know your behavior as a person your behavior is your person so christ's behavior is this person could you imagine christ gambling could you imagine christ stand up to buy a lotta ticket no you can't imagine that so the seven thunder watch and if you have christ in you then you will behave like who christ the seventh and the seed of faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness bully kindness will be planted in galatians 5 22-23 and you will see a nine-fold fruit then charity come down after you are seasoned out behavior sun vacation to set the fifo ministry into the kingdom of god and then they are positionally born into the kingdom and if and you are predestined to be there after being adopted and placed positionally in the land of the ephesians the promise of the holy spirit they will then step into this great ephesians adoption ministry of the manifested sons of god to shake the nations for a short quick ride oh praise the name of the lord and this is where i thank god for his servant brother jesus command because with all this light on the word we will just think all these sons are there where now we know they're not dear until they go through the same process that jesus went through holy ghost baptism born for the season power for the season then led into the wilderness to be formed into the word image oh hallelujah i am finished by the stephen come and get ready to sing but before that i have a scripture i want to read to you and that scripture is from ezekiel chapter 34. you could tune your bibles and you could find it or we want to read ezekiel and we're going to close with that scripture hallelujah and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel prophesy and say unto them thus share the lord god unto the shepherds this is isaiah 34 thus saith the lord god unto the shepherds will be to the shepherds of israel who do feed themselves should not the shepherds feed the flocks you eat the fat you clothe you with wool you kill them that are fed but you feed not the flock the diseased have you not strengthened neither have you healed that which was sick neither have you bunged up that which was broken neither have you brought again that which was given away neither have you brought sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have you ruled them and they were scattered because there was no shepherd and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered my sheep wandered through all the mountains upon every high hill yeah my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth and i none did search or seek after them therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the lord as i live see it the lord god surely because my flock became a praying and my flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was no shepherd neither did my shepherd search for my flock but the shepherds fed themselves and fed up my flock therefore o ye shepherds hear the word of the lord thus hear the lord god behold i am against the shepherds i require my flock at their hand because there and caused them to cease from feeling the flock neither shall the shepherds feed themselves anymore for i will deliver my flock from their mouth and they may not be meat for them for thus here the lord god behold i even i will both search my sheep and seek them out as a shepherd seek out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will i seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy underpay father god we thank you for your presence we thank you for your love we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you being a
