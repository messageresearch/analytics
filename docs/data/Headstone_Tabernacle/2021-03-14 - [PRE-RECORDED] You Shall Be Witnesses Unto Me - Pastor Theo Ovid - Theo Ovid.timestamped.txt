[20:00] okay so this morning we are so grateful
[20:02] to be here
[20:04] it's always a privilege to come into the
[20:06] presence of god
[20:08] i don't know how you feel when you come
[20:10] and you feel the atmosphere and the
[20:11] anointing
[20:13] and to think when adam fell and he fell
[20:17] they would drive him out the garden of
[20:19] eden
[20:21] think about being driven out of presence
[20:25] presence you're living in it
[20:28] communion in it all of a sudden you're
[20:31] walking out and you're looking back and
[20:32] you're walking out of presence
[20:35] not only walking out of prisons but
[20:37] angels with swords
[20:40] guarding any way possible for you to get
[20:43] back into presence
[20:46] and the prophet taught us god is setting
[20:48] angels
[20:49] no to drive you
[20:53] back into the presence
[20:58] the object of the service is not just a
[21:01] talk word
[21:03] it's to bring you into presence
[21:07] because in in the presence is life
[21:11] is the presence is power in his presence
[21:14] is healing
[21:16] is his presence is deliverance we
[21:19] wasting time
[21:21] if we cannot come into presence oh glory
[21:24] to god amen
[21:26] amen so this morning you want to go into
[21:28] the word i
[21:29] was so thrilled by the anointing and
[21:31] atmosphere of the song service
[21:33] and you know a body gets started with a
[21:35] tremendous prayer meeting on friday
[21:38] we won't have another one and we won't
[21:41] have another one
[21:41] and we want to stream that next one next
[21:44] friday for those who can't make it out
[21:46] but we want as many of you to come out
[21:48] to come out
[21:50] and join us in that time of prayer and
[21:52] seeking the lord
[21:54] on friday so this morning we want to
[21:56] turn our bibles to mark chapter five
[21:59] it's in john chapter one and acts
[22:01] chapter one
[22:02] for scripture reading this morning
[22:13] reading mark 5 reading from verse 25
[22:18] on a certain woman which had an issue of
[22:20] blood 12 years
[22:22] had suffered many things of many
[22:24] physicians
[22:25] spend all that she had and was nothing
[22:28] bettered
[22:28] but rather grew with and when she had
[22:31] heard of jesus
[22:32] came in the press behind and touched his
[22:35] garment
[22:36] for she said if i may touch but his
[22:38] clothes
[22:39] i shall be whole and straightway the
[22:42] function of her blood was dried up
[22:44] and she felt in her body that she was
[22:47] healed of that plague
[22:50] and jesus immediately knowing in himself
[22:55] that virtue had gone out of him turned
[22:58] him about in the press and said
[23:00] who touched my clothes and his disciples
[23:04] said unto him
[23:05] thousands the multitude thronging thee
[23:07] and says thou who touched me
[23:10] and he looked around about to see her
[23:13] that had done this thing
[23:15] and the woman fearing and trembling
[23:18] knowing
[23:18] what was done in her came and fell down
[23:21] before him
[23:22] and told him all the truth he said unto
[23:25] her
[23:25] daughter thy faith had made the whole
[23:30] go in peace and behold of thy plague
[23:34] saint john 1 reading from verse 11 to
[23:36] 14.
[23:40] he came unto his own and his own receive
[23:42] him not
[23:43] but as many as received him to them gave
[23:46] you power
[23:47] to become the sons of god even to them
[23:50] that believe on his name
[23:52] which were born not of blood nor of the
[23:54] will of
[23:55] flesh nor of the will of man but of god
[23:58] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[24:00] among us and we beheld his glory
[24:02] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[24:04] father
[24:06] full of grace and truth and our last
[24:08] scripture
[24:09] one verse was acts 1 8 familiar
[24:12] scripture
[24:13] and you shall receive power after the
[24:16] holy ghost has come upon you
[24:18] and he shall be witnesses unto me both
[24:21] in jerusalem
[24:22] and in all judea and in samaria and to
[24:25] the uttermost part of the earth may god
[24:26] bless his word you may be seated
[24:29] praise the name of the lord oh blessed
[24:31] be the name of the lord
[24:33] as we said on wednesday night uh in
[24:35] going forward
[24:36] once i'm preaching i'll be making
[24:38] reference to
[24:40] azusa street and some pointers of azusa
[24:42] street revival
[24:43] a revival that took place in 1906 where
[24:46] the holy spirit god came down in a
[24:48] powerful way
[24:49] and what i didn't even realize that the
[24:51] brother seymour he prophesied
[24:54] that there was going to be another
[24:56] revival
[24:57] it will be about a hundred years from
[24:59] now because that revival just died out
[25:02] and then god sent a prophet messenger
[25:04] because he needed that atmosphere for
[25:06] the prophet messenger to come into it
[25:08] so 1906 by 1946 rival
[25:11] dead gone the angel of the lord appeared
[25:14] unto
[25:14] branham and gave him a message to bring
[25:18] to a gentile bride
[25:20] that is how you got called out because
[25:22] the pentecostal was like shock
[25:24] and brother branham brought the word
[25:26] which was the seed
[25:28] so he we have a message bought by a 20th
[25:31] century prophet
[25:32] and the message itself is dusty at the
[25:34] lord
[25:36] the message itself is not word only the
[25:38] message itself is not teaching only
[25:40] it's not information only on books only
[25:43] that's what we have had
[25:44] for 40 50 years the message is a little
[25:47] more than that
[25:49] my title tonight is ye shall be
[25:51] witnesses unto me
[25:53] that is jesus words to his disciples
[25:56] ye shall be witnesses unto me
[26:00] and i have an inspiration virtue power
[26:03] for service
[26:04] virtue a witness is to see something
[26:08] experience something to be there
[26:12] a person who is present so you can't
[26:15] be it cannot be a heresy you have to be
[26:18] here
[26:19] to be a genuine witness and jesus he's
[26:23] told disciples
[26:24] you shall receive power after the holy
[26:27] ghost has come upon you
[26:28] and you shall be witnesses unto me
[26:32] not your own witness your witness in
[26:35] christ
[26:36] hallelujah you are going to represent
[26:39] christ
[26:40] you are going to see christ and i
[26:42] realize this is the problem with many
[26:44] people today
[26:46] the burden is not christ it's a selfish
[26:49] thing
[26:50] it's about you it's about your stories
[26:52] about how you
[26:53] feel and how you think it's not about
[26:55] the lord
[26:56] but you are promised to become a true
[26:59] witness
[27:00] a witness unto jesus and that is why
[27:04] when peter healed a man he said you
[27:07] think by my power this man is made whole
[27:10] but in the name of jesus it's not me
[27:13] it's jesus so peter was bearing witness
[27:15] of jesus
[27:17] and as jesus reflect god
[27:20] you shall reflect christ as jesus
[27:23] reflect
[27:24] and reveal god you're going to reveal
[27:27] jesus christ
[27:28] because christ is the mystery of god
[27:31] revealed
[27:33] hallelujah is going to be christ in you
[27:37] amen praise the name of the lord
[27:40] praise god so pride and selfishness and
[27:43] i was given a
[27:44] i think it was in the prayer meeting
[27:46] that seymour who started this revival as
[27:49] loser street revival
[27:50] was a a negro man and he had uh
[27:54] he was half blind so a one-eyed man
[27:57] and god called him the first church he
[28:00] went to was a kind of radical church
[28:02] the church had black and white's worship
[28:03] and in those times that segregation
[28:06] white's here blacks here so he went to
[28:08] church that didn't believe in that was a
[28:10] white pastor
[28:11] but he did not believe in segregation
[28:14] so therefore he was there for a while he
[28:16] went to another church and this church
[28:18] now preaching and teaching the baptism
[28:19] of the holy ghost
[28:21] but that preacher white preacher he
[28:24] believed in segregation
[28:26] so he believed that black and white not
[28:27] supposed to be together but seymour was
[28:29] a humble man
[28:31] and he wanted to hear what to be what is
[28:34] being taught
[28:35] about the baptism holy ghost so he was
[28:38] contented to be sitting
[28:39] outside the church separated from the
[28:42] congregation
[28:43] to listen from outside what the man was
[28:46] teaching
[28:47] hallelujah glory to god and he learned
[28:50] something from the both sides
[28:52] one side was preaching unity when he
[28:55] went back to them they don't believe in
[28:56] the baptismal all heroes
[28:58] but they believe in unity this side
[29:00] don't believe in unity
[29:01] but the teaching is baptized so he
[29:05] was able to draw from both sides and
[29:07] come down the middle
[29:09] with unity and power
[29:12] of the baptism of the holy ghost to
[29:15] activate
[29:17] a revival that we still feel in the
[29:20] effects of
[29:22] oh glory to god because man didn't start
[29:25] that revival
[29:27] as god started revival hallelujah
[29:30] the fire of the holy ghost was so hot
[29:34] over the roof people were seeing fire
[29:37] they were calling fire services to oak
[29:40] the fire
[29:41] that was on top of that building oh
[29:43] glory to god
[29:45] but it wasn't a natural fire it was a
[29:48] holy ghost fire
[29:50] and i am believing that same holy ghost
[29:53] that same fire but come down among you
[29:57] oh hang over the building hang over you
[30:02] or give the lord a shout
[30:08] glory to god
[30:10] [Applause]
[30:12] as long as we remain separate and
[30:15] selfish
[30:17] the spirit cannot come hallelujah
[30:22] what would happen if we come to a unity
[30:26] of defeat hallelujah
[30:29] what would happen if the walls of
[30:32] partition is broken down
[30:34] and people begin to see themselves as
[30:36] brethren
[30:38] sons of god
[30:41] sons of the kingdom a kingdom
[30:46] that cannot be moved hallelujah
[30:50] what a power it's going to be amen
[30:54] glory to god but the branham was talking
[30:57] about
[30:58] what we need today is some fire in the
[31:02] boiler
[31:06] you know them long time training used to
[31:07] move by steam
[31:09] to get steam you had a hot deal water
[31:14] not warm water warm water don't produce
[31:17] steam
[31:18] it has to be boiling water boiling hot
[31:22] water
[31:22] and then the steam come out to produce a
[31:25] power
[31:26] to get that engine moving and the church
[31:29] and going nowhere
[31:31] with lukewarm water oh come on now come
[31:34] on now
[31:37] things have to get hot
[31:41] in here
[31:48] things things have to get hot in your
[31:51] life
[31:52] if you want things to move it has that's
[31:54] why i said rather
[31:55] hot on your coal because if you're cold
[31:57] you're dead
[31:58] lukewarm and moving no train but if
[32:01] you're hurt we can get steam
[32:08] so i say this morning let's raise the
[32:10] temperature
[32:12] of praise let's raise the temperature
[32:15] of prayer let's raise the temperature
[32:19] of worship and see what god's going to
[32:21] do inside of here
[32:26] oh glory hallelujah
[32:31] there's a testimony and i i know but
[32:33] abraham said mr lim will be restored
[32:36] but i didn't realize that that was done
[32:37] in the exercise revival
[32:41] one man in a factory got his arm cut off
[32:44] everybody knew it went to the azure
[32:47] street and his arm grew back in seconds

[49:22] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[49:25] so let's continue says from the rising
[49:28] sun
[49:29] no matter how much your legends claim
[49:31] how well you got your church set
[49:33] how much education you got how much the
[49:35] bible
[49:36] until that wave sheath until the holy
[49:39] spirit
[49:40] comes upon that person to quicken the
[49:43] word
[49:44] the gasoline represents the word it's
[49:47] the truth
[49:48] but without the spirit it won't move
[49:51] we have put too much stress on the
[49:54] mechanics
[49:56] and nothing on the dynamic it needs
[49:59] the dynamic power of god the
[50:02] resurrection power of jesus christ
[50:04] upon the church to manifest and bring to
[50:07] pass that is gasoline
[50:09] so regardless how people are taught how
[50:12] much mysteries they are taught
[50:13] how much revelations they are taught it
[50:16] needs the fire
[50:18] it needs the power to know if it is
[50:20] gasoline
[50:22] because if it is water you scratch your
[50:23] match and drop at the side of the batch
[50:24] ocean
[50:26] [Music]
[50:28] it may be in a gasoline can but that
[50:31] don't mean it's gasoline

[50:45] make it gasoline
[50:47] no you have to have real gasoline on the
[50:52] inside
[51:02] [Applause]
[51:06] if that is really that
[51:10] so to prove his gasoline you haven't
[51:11] liked it much and when you drop it if
[51:14] it's gasoline
[51:15] boom you'll hear explosion
[51:18] you're gonna see fire if it's gasoline
[51:22] if it's not gasoline people just sit and
[51:23] steal oh going to go but if it's
[51:26] gasoline
[51:27] upon you and that light hit you you have
[51:30] to do something
[51:32] at least your hand will go up at least
[51:35] your head my shake a little bit so
[51:37] [Applause]
[51:41] even even if you're stiff neck your
[51:44] whole body might lose so
[51:46] but something's gonna
[51:49] to move hallelujah listen
[51:53] one time there was burying a dead man
[51:56] and he had some robbers and bandits
[51:57] coming and elijah grave
[52:00] was there and they dropped the dead man
[52:02] and the might come back to life
[52:04] on because it was quickening power not

[53:13] have you received the word then power is

[59:21] widow's wrinkle or glory to god
[59:24] i believe that
[59:26] [Applause]
[59:35] until that church becomes both dynamics
[59:39] and mechanics
[59:40] and the spirit of god that moved him
[59:44] to jesus to do the things that he did
[59:47] if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the
[59:50] bride
[59:54] for he said in sin john 14 12 he that
[59:56] believeth on me
[59:57] the works that i do shall do also i will
[1:00:00] give him a
[1:00:01] charge of my dynamics in his mechanics
[1:00:04] that is the interpretation of that
[1:00:06] scripture
[1:00:07] [Applause]
[1:00:09] let me read it again die not a text to

[1:04:04] doesn't believe it on me the works that
[1:04:06] i do shall do also
[1:04:07] i'll give him a charge of my dynamics in
[1:04:09] his mechanics
[1:04:11] that the world will not be able to
[1:04:13] withstand it
[1:04:14] [Applause]
[1:04:19] jesus even say greater works than these
[1:04:22] shall you do
[1:04:23] that's the easter message the mechanics
[1:04:25] and dynamics together
[1:04:27] the mechanics without dynamics no good
[1:04:29] nightmares with all the mechanics
[1:04:31] no good it has to come together
[1:04:35] you can scream and shout and jump up and
[1:04:37] down all you want and deny this word
[1:04:39] no good you're just cranking around the
[1:04:42] pistons
[1:04:43] it got to have a spark the fire
[1:04:46] but there's no gasoline so the mechanics
[1:04:50] put gasoline in your bottle put gasoline
[1:04:53] in your
[1:04:54] system he said the secret is the word
[1:04:58] or the gasoline is in the right
[1:05:01] hallelujah
[1:05:02] here come the dynamics which is the
[1:05:04] spark
[1:05:05] which is the fire which is the power to
[1:05:08] come upon your gasoline
[1:05:10] over the weed of god
[1:05:14] and the sun says when the spirit of the
[1:05:16] lord

[1:11:14] we're finishing up on earth
[1:11:19] the battle that started in heaven we're
[1:11:22] going to finish it on
[1:11:23] 8th what satan sat in eden
[1:11:26] we will correct it god leave the right
[1:11:29] for the last day
[1:11:30] to prove to satan we are not like eve
[1:11:34] this bride is anointed this bride is
[1:11:36] appointed
[1:11:38] this bride is predestinated nobody could
[1:11:41] stop this black
[1:11:42] this bible will not be manhandled paul
[1:11:45] will take the man handle
[1:11:47] off of that right the bride will go free
[1:11:50] but we give the lord some praises
[1:11:52] oh my my mind hallelujah
[1:11:58] from revelation book of symbols brahm
[1:12:00] say god is waiting and trying and
[1:12:02] pressing
[1:12:03] to get the mystery of god revealed
[1:12:06] to his church that is what holding back
[1:12:09] the coming of christ now
[1:12:11] and the great millennium is this
[1:12:15] great supernatural power
[1:12:18] that really lays dormant in the church
[1:12:22] here he is saying the mysteries have to
[1:12:24] reveal
[1:12:26] for what for what's the purpose to say
[1:12:28] we have mysteries
[1:12:29] other jesus don't have as much mysteries
[1:12:31] as us we have plenty mysteries
[1:12:34] tons of it no that's not the purpose no
[1:12:37] is to get activated this great
[1:12:41] supernatural power
[1:12:43] that's why what about him says the
[1:12:44] mission of the seven thunders he said is
[1:12:46] this the mystery
[1:12:47] that will bring back a power into the
[1:12:49] church
[1:12:50] will we leap and run over walls not miss
[1:12:53] you to talk and say well
[1:12:54] we talk i'm making a mistake no no no is
[1:12:56] this the mystery
[1:12:58] they're going to bring back come on
[1:13:00] shout out power
[1:13:02] bring back our power into the church
[1:13:05] power to come into the church
[1:13:07] [Applause]
[1:13:11] so after the mysteries we have to see
[1:13:13] that mystery
[1:13:14] connecting to power not power to reveal
[1:13:17] more mysteries
[1:13:18] so help me guard people stuck in some
[1:13:20] time warp mystery world
[1:13:22] it's a mystery oh they're still warped
[1:13:25] up in mechanics
[1:13:27] it's a mystery and they don't want to
[1:13:29] leave the channel
[1:13:30] because we see when jesus came he meet
[1:13:33] these crime pharisees with their
[1:13:34] mysteries
[1:13:35] of the old testament and and they had
[1:13:37] long hearts
[1:13:38] tall hearts long beards nice gongs
[1:13:42] no works no signs no wonders no miracles
[1:13:43] no nothing so when jesus come and jesus
[1:13:46] see them
[1:13:47] just blast them you see you bite
[1:13:49] yourself cuts
[1:13:52] he saw the looking clean old sound like
[1:13:54] dead men bones on the inside
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:58] he busted them and started manifesting
[1:14:01] what they hated him
[1:14:02] because he was showing them up they say
[1:14:05] we are moses children
[1:14:08] our fathers eat man in the wilderness he
[1:14:10] said everyone dead
[1:14:11] you say moses what i am moses on my day
[1:14:15] and so forth
[1:14:15] he was trying to view who he was the
[1:14:18] people who was
[1:14:19] scripture in the word rejected him
[1:14:22] and those sinners like peter fisherman
[1:14:25] gosmod
[1:14:27] matthew material guys tax collector
[1:14:29] these are the guys that received jesus
[1:14:32] because their name was in that book you
[1:14:35] can't be a christian
[1:14:36] really unless god ordained you to be
[1:14:41] that's why you in church this morning
[1:14:42] considered a privilege and an honor
[1:14:45] to get the opportunity to hear
[1:14:49] this word
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:15:00] so christ he's not out of speaking
[1:15:02] distance
[1:15:04] some of you are backslid and done that
[1:15:07] which is wrong
[1:15:08] you have lost that joy your water is
[1:15:11] dried up
[1:15:12] my lord he is still in speaking distance
[1:15:15] of you
[1:15:18] he follows you
[1:15:21] you're sad you're done you're depressed
[1:15:25] but he's following you
[1:15:29] he follows you he knows every move you
[1:15:32] make
[1:15:34] and everything you do he is
[1:15:38] longing to hear you call him on the
[1:15:41] scene
[1:15:43] of course satan's job is to make sure
[1:15:45] your mouth get tight
[1:15:48] and your clothes when the birds get
[1:15:51] wounded
[1:15:53] they're flying away to ease the wind
[1:15:56] pressure on the bridge that is wounded
[1:15:59] they fly in a constellation a certain
[1:16:01] kind of a way
[1:16:02] certain job is to get you aside from the
[1:16:06] consolation
[1:16:07] of the group of the flying birds and
[1:16:10] when it catch you on your side
[1:16:12] where you have no real guidance and
[1:16:14] leadership and so on
[1:16:16] beat you in the corner there and you
[1:16:18] find yourself suffering all alone
[1:16:21] it doesn't have to be that way that is
[1:16:24] why
[1:16:24] you're among the people that's why in a
[1:16:26] group
[1:16:27] where you can get the help and the
[1:16:29] support and the encouragement and the
[1:16:31] nurturing and
[1:16:32] strengthening your soul can be fed where
[1:16:34] you could be edified
[1:16:36] or you can be inspired it's more than
[1:16:38] just hearing words
[1:16:40] there's a community that is here there's
[1:16:42] a family that is here
[1:16:44] there's a blood flow in your veins is
[1:16:46] the same blood
[1:16:48] is the blood of jesus hallelujah that
[1:16:50] brings life
[1:16:52] give us an opportunity to say you're my
[1:16:54] brother you're my sister
[1:16:55] i'm praying for you hallelujah your
[1:16:58] tears is my tears
[1:16:59] your pain is my pain when you suffer i
[1:17:02] am suffering
[1:17:03] hallelujah i don't have a point to prove
[1:17:05] that i am better than you
[1:17:06] the blood is for all of us the same
[1:17:09] blood for me
[1:17:10] it's the same blood for you i love you
[1:17:13] i care for you i am there with you
[1:17:17] i want to be have your back
[1:17:23] he's longing to hear you call on him on
[1:17:25] the scene and this great pentecostal
[1:17:28] move today
[1:17:29] god is waiting for you to call him on
[1:17:31] the scene
[1:17:33] you are not out of speaking distance
[1:17:34] with him though you have done wrong
[1:17:38] sinned turn our backs on him
[1:17:41] done things we ought not to do yet he is
[1:17:44] with us
[1:17:45] christ said he is we will be with us
[1:17:49] isn't it strange that god wants the
[1:17:51] people to have a patent to it
[1:17:53] when jesus looked upon the harvest he
[1:17:54] said the harvest is right
[1:17:56] the laborers are few you pray the lord
[1:17:59] of the harvest
[1:18:01] look the vision we talk about brother
[1:18:02] branham 12 year old girl
[1:18:04] she wants to die that very day the lord
[1:18:06] tap the prophet and tell him pray for
[1:18:08] her
[1:18:09] that that doesn't happen amen so god
[1:18:11] couldn't stop it because that was
[1:18:13] destiny
[1:18:14] that was what was supposed to happen but
[1:18:16] if a prophet prayed
[1:18:18] if somebody prayed you could flip it
[1:18:24] so i i could now see how prophecies
[1:18:26] could fail
[1:18:28] because there could be a prophecy
[1:18:29] against your life you could have one
[1:18:31] more week to live
[1:18:32] but god because our prayer god flipped
[1:18:35] that over
[1:18:39] and cancel that assignment
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:43] whatever assignment on your life prayer
[1:18:46] to come and cancel that
[1:18:48] prayer i could change the mind of god or
[1:18:51] go away to god
[1:18:53] if you need a cancer in this morning you
[1:18:55] can have it
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:19:00] you don't even know the forces of taxes
[1:19:02] and evil that come in your way
[1:19:05] and the traps and sneers that sit and
[1:19:07] set up and you don't even know the
[1:19:09] reinforcement that god about to put on
[1:19:10] you
[1:19:12] because this coming week going to be a a
[1:19:14] challenging week
[1:19:16] and god given special unction and
[1:19:17] inspiration
[1:19:19] that you could face your week this
[1:19:20] coming week
[1:19:24] don't come here and act wiki wikiwiki
[1:19:26] come here and get strength
[1:19:39] i'll not not put peeling potatoes in the
[1:19:41] background
[1:19:42] but going on the battlefield hollywood
[1:19:45] hallelujah
[1:19:46] isn't it strange that god wants the
[1:19:48] people to have patented when jesus
[1:19:50] looked upon the house he said harvest is
[1:19:51] right
[1:19:52] the laborers are few you pray the lord
[1:19:54] of the harvest that was him
[1:19:55] you pray to me that i will send laborers
[1:19:58] into my harvest
[1:20:00] it is some part you have to do
[1:20:04] this thing about prayer is not just
[1:20:07] saying prayers
[1:20:09] it's to connect to praying in such a way
[1:20:12] that you have a prayer life
[1:20:15] a prayer life is different from prayers
[1:20:18] or saying prayers let me say it again
[1:20:21] our prayer life
[1:20:22] is different from saying prayers our
[1:20:25] prayer life is a life of prayer
[1:20:30] you don't eat breakfast once a week so
[1:20:32] how are you praying once a week
[1:20:35] all right you're living with breakfast
[1:20:37] lunch and dinner

[1:23:26] [Applause]
[1:23:28] they came where they were so insincere
[1:23:31] they would send people to offer blam for

[1:23:35] off of a jehovah take that no sincerity
[1:23:38] not going to church no sincerity
[1:23:40] communion service no sincerity
[1:23:43] hallelujah the minister there doing all
[1:23:44] kind of wrong things nobody's saying
[1:23:46] nothing nobody repented no sincerity
[1:23:48] and god says i hate your feasts i hate
[1:23:50] your new moon i hate your diss
[1:23:51] your sabbath and you recognize it
[1:23:55] because there's no sincerity
[1:23:58] because to really offer sacrifice you're
[1:24:00] supposed to lay hands
[1:24:02] upon the lamb and that land represented
[1:24:05] you
[1:24:06] that is supposed to die you're resting
[1:24:08] your hands on the lamb before he died
[1:24:11] so you know it alive so when the priest
[1:24:14] cut the neck of the lamb and the blood
[1:24:16] start to spit out
[1:24:18] and you'll feel the life leaving the
[1:24:20] lamb
[1:24:21] you know that's supposed to be you you
[1:24:23] get identified
[1:24:25] blood is on you you know that's supposed
[1:24:28] to be you
[1:24:29] you supposed to die but the lamb is in
[1:24:32] your stead
[1:24:33] the lamb taken your place giving you an
[1:24:36] opportunity
[1:24:37] to be free it was something that was
[1:24:39] sacred
[1:24:40] it was something that was solemn it was
[1:24:42] something that was ordained by jehovah
[1:24:44] that you the believer had to lay your
[1:24:46] hands you have to touch it
[1:24:49] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:24:53] all glory to god and be identified with
[1:24:56] it you have to touch it
[1:24:59] hallelujah people talk to service
[1:25:01] they're not drinking

[1:25:10] there's not that you know you have to
[1:25:11] eat the whole scroll
[1:25:13] this is the word this is the spirit that
[1:25:15] woman who read about that woman in the
[1:25:17] blood issue
[1:25:18] she spent all her money her money ran
[1:25:20] out and sometime when your money ran out
[1:25:23] yeah well wait even though pressure
[1:25:27] that pressure has been on desperation
[1:25:29] and people owe that money to do some
[1:25:31] desperate things you know
[1:25:32] something's turned to rubbers and all
[1:25:34] right because they want money bad yes
[1:25:36] all kinds of things do but this woman
[1:25:39] she knows she has no money to go to the
[1:25:40] doctor
[1:25:41] doctor ripping off a long time yeah
[1:25:43] because he don't have no cure he's just
[1:25:44] taking some money
[1:25:46] but she heard about jesus you have to
[1:25:48] hear
[1:25:49] hallelujah she ain't hear about jesus
[1:25:51] just explaining mysteries and talking
[1:25:54] she hear about our god that healing is
[1:25:56] sick
[1:25:57] reasonably dead you see your body good
[1:26:00] and you're fine and healthy you could
[1:26:02] hear plenty mysteries
[1:26:04] because you don't have no needs but you
[1:26:06] see when that woman had a need
[1:26:08] a bloody history you can't teach me
[1:26:10] about mystery you know
[1:26:11] trumpets and violence woes woman and his
[1:26:13] son and this missionary mystery you know

[1:26:21] she told herself
[1:26:23] because nobody was telling her so she
[1:26:25] told herself
[1:26:26] and when nobody telling you you better
[1:26:29] tell yourself
[1:26:30] the right thing she told herself
[1:26:34] if i to touch the helm of his garment
[1:26:37] how we made whole what are you telling
[1:26:40] yourself this morning
[1:26:41] oh we talk about revival we talk about
[1:26:43] azusa
[1:26:44] we talk about the power that is promised
[1:26:47] that is prophesied william branham is
[1:26:50] not here
[1:26:51] but the power is here god never take the
[1:26:54] power
[1:26:55] it was reserved but here take it
[1:26:58] [Applause]
[1:27:02] you may receive oh i love him
[1:27:05] i just thank god god loose with power
[1:27:09] i thank god he has character to connect
[1:27:12] with power
[1:27:13] because if men behave as they believe no
[1:27:15] with all power
[1:27:16] if god gave them power they must have
[1:27:18] been placed oh glory to god they
[1:27:21] wrecked the place so god ain't gonna
[1:27:23] have that
[1:27:24] he's gonna have character first because
[1:27:26] the pentecostal
[1:27:27] they failed because they didn't have
[1:27:29] character so they stumbled at the gifts
[1:27:32] they still have the gifts but god called
[1:27:34] a bride to be formed into the word image
[1:27:38] he said as many as receive him to them
[1:27:40] gave me power
[1:27:42] to become a power to be formed
[1:27:46] into the
[1:27:49] image or glory of god
[1:27:53] ruling of god and faith
[1:27:56] is a revelation but virtue is power
[1:28:00] oh glory to god you need power

[1:28:06] service
[1:28:07] oh give the lord a shout give the lord a
[1:28:10] shout

[1:34:51] of the harvest
[1:34:52] that was him you pray to me that i will
[1:34:55] send laborers into my harvest

[1:35:00] waiting for his church
[1:35:01] to call on him he always did it
[1:35:04] god here we go is waiting today
[1:35:08] for the people to call his servant
[1:35:11] into action and the servant
[1:35:15] can't get into action till the people
[1:35:19] praise what a mystery is in this morning
[1:35:21] this is a hidden mystery that i'm about
[1:35:23] to reveal right now
[1:35:25] hallelujah we want to break the seal
[1:35:27] over this hidden mystery
[1:35:29] this hidden mystery of prayer that the
[1:35:31] church so dead
[1:35:33] that they have stress and and think the
[1:35:35] capri i think but the clients
[1:35:37] i think but karen sent me a powerful
[1:35:38] code this morning if you could find out
[1:35:40] here

[1:36:19] no it's almost an impossible thing to
[1:36:22] get people praying and fasting and
[1:36:23] calling on the lord
[1:36:24] it seems that the church has got so
[1:36:26] drowsy and lazy in these last days
[1:36:28] so pitiful i hate to come and just
[1:36:31] keep stirring and preaching and saying
[1:36:34] these things but brother sister that's
[1:36:35] the truth
[1:36:36] i just can't hold it it's the gospel and
[1:36:39] it must be preached
[1:36:40] it's got to be preached as a witness it
[1:36:42] is true and i think we have come to that
[1:36:44] spot
[1:36:45] we have come to know nia when god has
[1:36:47] given an issue for the church to call a
[1:36:49] halt
[1:36:50] a back to our prayer life not back to
[1:36:53] prayer no
[1:36:54] and you pray because we call it
[1:36:55] permitting no back to our prayer
[1:36:58] because he said no ministering a revival
[1:37:00] in the ministers this so-called man of
[1:37:02] god man and the hour and main man and
[1:37:04] only man and whatnot
[1:37:05] if they could have done it they would
[1:37:06] have done it already he said the reviver
[1:37:08] can only come by the people
[1:37:10] in their homes in their lives
[1:37:14] then you bring a revival with you from
[1:37:15] your house

[1:37:19] revival with you

[1:42:01] god is waiting the hour to see his
[1:42:04] church come to that position
[1:42:06] regardless of denomination regardless of
[1:42:08] creed color
[1:42:09] whatever it may be that his entire
[1:42:12] church would come to the place
[1:42:13] that they are displaying the token of
[1:42:16] the death of jesus christ
[1:42:18] you see it nice to talk doctrine talk
[1:42:20] because we can argue
[1:42:22] because we don't believe the same thing
[1:42:23] i found that quote bomb says we'll never
[1:42:25] agree on the same thing until jesus come
[1:42:28] or something nothing like that there
[1:42:29] so it's not a mata green same thing
[1:42:31] somebody like sprite somebody like cokes
[1:42:33] on my like big red
[1:42:35] and somebody like orange and somebody
[1:42:37] that drinks drinks at all
[1:42:39] like apple juice cranberry
[1:42:43] somebody don't want no juice they want
[1:42:44] hot tea i feel about a george you want
[1:42:46] coffee
[1:42:52] so there's about 10 different things we
[1:42:54] call there and people have different
[1:42:56] choices
[1:42:57] they want this they want that god gave
[1:42:59] you that right to be that
[1:43:01] peter was a daring guy lord is that you
[1:43:03] built me to come
[1:43:06] machi wasn't like that james wasn't like
[1:43:08] that and brother cannot fight but you're
[1:43:10] not like that number
[1:43:11] do you see peter
[1:43:15] but you know when united trial that
[1:43:17] peter said i don't know that man at all
[1:43:21] so be careful who you want to be like
[1:43:25] what's be careful because any whole
[1:43:28] pizza you know you can't just take
[1:43:29] walking in the water you know you gotta
[1:43:30] take him in the incredibles too
[1:43:32] and crying and i'm cussing and thinking
[1:43:33] you have to take all that too
[1:43:40] so the object is the purpose of god
[1:43:45] and the objective of god for the brandon
[1:43:48] said
[1:43:48] from genesis to revelation the whole
[1:43:50] mind behind that
[1:43:52] is for the word to become flesh
[1:43:55] [Music]
[1:43:58] that is the objective word
[1:44:02] to become flesh and the word become
[1:44:04] flesh is god
[1:44:06] he said the word was invisible until
[1:44:10] it became flesh so you carry see
[1:44:13] god until
[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:17] it becomes flesh then that god becomes
[1:44:20] active because he have a place
[1:44:24] a room a house he can operate
[1:44:27] in by and true
[1:44:31] oh glory to god so if god take up you as
[1:44:34] his house
[1:44:35] he could speak through you he could heal
[1:44:38] through you
[1:44:40] he can see visions through you give you
[1:44:42] dreams
[1:44:44] that's the word i report my
[1:44:48] spirit your sons and daughters
[1:44:51] shall prophesy all men
[1:44:54] shall dream dreams and you young
[1:44:57] minister here

[1:56:04] line in the middle of the road left side
[1:56:06] right side
[1:56:06] you can feel let you have the right side
[1:56:10] you are care about your left side no
[1:56:11] more you're going normally right
[1:56:15] you're looking for accident you're

[1:56:17] be arrested and imprisoned
[1:56:19] you have to buy by the rules go to rules
[1:56:21] too
[1:56:23] if my people are humble myself you have
[1:56:24] rules too joshua
[1:56:26] meditated on the word day and night to
[1:56:28] have good success
[1:56:30] if joshua said i have even let them
[1:56:32] meditate
[1:56:34] i just go in not their night night going
[1:56:35] there alone
[1:56:38] then the scripture is different you know
[1:56:40] when they go to jordan jordan watch them
[1:56:41] back to yourself
[1:56:44] do they say what you say because you're
[1:56:47] not anointed to open me
[1:56:48] you don't have the power to open me so
[1:56:51] jordan jordan is a certain anointed and
[1:56:53] power
[1:56:54] so so joshua out of sync with god's
[1:56:56] program
[1:56:58] jordan not responding jonah jordan full
[1:56:59] exams like this
[1:57:03] but when them guys obey god
[1:57:05] [Music]
[1:57:06] under the anointing of obedience because
[1:57:09] you can't just say amen you know
[1:57:11] you your spirit have to come in
[1:57:14] obedience
[1:57:16] to the word and many people come into
[1:57:18] church just to here
[1:57:19] [Music]
[1:57:21] and have a nice atmosphere and feel good
[1:57:24] but god wants your spirit to come
[1:57:27] in obedience to the word because
[1:57:30] obedience is the key
[1:57:32] and could give you the scripture faith
[1:57:34] from obedience
[1:57:36] to the whole word of god entitles you
[1:57:39] to the token
[1:57:41] [Applause]
[1:57:43] for obedience the prophet said it nicely
[1:57:46] when abraham came
[1:57:47] into the fullness of believing then the
[1:57:50] angel calmed down
[1:57:52] they gave him a fresh anointing that he
[1:57:54] going to have isaac
[1:57:56] he knew it by revelation with all the
[1:57:58] inspiration fully behind it
[1:58:00] but when the angel came down his fate is
[1:58:02] now anointed
[1:58:04] he know for sure isaac are coming too
[1:58:06] long
[1:58:07] time of life is around the corner and
[1:58:10] the bride have to get anointed
[1:58:12] to know time of life

[1:59:26] and jesus said you with your traditions
[1:59:29] make

[1:59:34] because the word here is supposed to
[1:59:36] have an
[1:59:37] effect upon the believers
[1:59:41] [Music]
[1:59:42] listen don't come all these miles to
[1:59:45] come and get 500 meal
[1:59:50] you're coming for the world i i can't
[1:59:54] understand people come to chicago
[1:59:56] fight with the pastor every day fighting
[1:59:57] he's saying this and he's in there
[1:59:59] you're gonna fight
[2:00:00] you want to you want to get delivered
[2:00:03] from your own fight hallelujah
[2:00:07] so traditions make the world of
[2:00:10] non-effect
[2:00:11] the word no longer had the effect upon
[2:00:13] the people
[2:00:15] because they was doing it like ritual
[2:00:17] you see
[2:00:18] and god don't like rituals because with
[2:00:20] a ritual
[2:00:21] your heart is not in it you do it
[2:00:24] because it has to be done
[2:00:26] it's like a task it's like a job you do
[2:00:29] it because you are asked
[2:00:30] you are do it because you are told but
[2:00:32] there's no love in it
[2:00:37] it's just like husband and wife if
[2:00:39] there's no love there it's just you know
[2:00:41] two people in the house
[2:00:42] it's no longer really a home it's just a
[2:00:45] house
[2:00:46] and people just talk the wife make the
[2:00:50] meal
[2:00:50] you meal they make with no love in it so
[2:00:53] the meal tastes a certain way
[2:00:54] it tastes minus love however that does
[2:00:58] taste
[2:00:59] it tastes minus love if the meat are
[2:01:02] loving it and it's only
[2:01:03] bhaji and rice or bhajjiyan bread it
[2:01:05] tastes good
[2:01:06] because they all in half and that meal
[2:01:10] was prepared with love in it
[2:01:11] so when you put love between the two
[2:01:13] slices of bread with some tomatoes in it
[2:01:15] it do like it's a burger
[2:01:18] because of love between them two slices
[2:01:22] you put some ketchup and some pepper and
[2:01:24] some garlic sauce on that
[2:01:26] ah you never believe you have no meat
[2:01:29] inside really
[2:01:33] why because they have love inside of it
[2:01:36] and this is how it's supposed to be with
[2:01:38] you in christ
[2:01:40] in your life in your work it's supposed
[2:01:43] to have love in it
[2:01:44] and when you have a love for the lord if
[2:01:46] god said no you still have love in it
[2:01:48] you put some mecha check you put some
[2:01:50] spice you put some praises
[2:01:51] you put some worship you put some
[2:01:53] thanksgiving and you say lord
[2:01:55] you know best
[2:01:56] [Applause]
[2:02:01] because that is how you show you love
[2:02:03] god by conducting yourself with joy
[2:02:06] amidst the trials he in his wisdom sends
[2:02:09] your way
[2:02:11] so you are blessed you are blessed
[2:02:14] david say my god run it over man
[2:02:19] oh glory to god you're so blessed
[2:02:22] that your cop run it over give the lord
[2:02:25] a hand up please
[2:02:33] [Applause]
[2:02:35] now let's ask ourselves the question
[2:02:38] isn't that something like today as bad
[2:02:41] as we have to see it
[2:02:42] we have got to face facts somewhere
[2:02:45] there is something wrong
[2:02:47] he said why this church ought to be a
[2:02:51] million miles up the road
[2:02:53] to where it is now jesus is waiting on
[2:02:55] his church to get ready
[2:02:57] his bride has made itself ready listen
[2:03:00] to these words now
[2:03:01] we we have got the potentials
[2:03:04] the holy spirit is here god is here
[2:03:08] the power to heal the sick the power to
[2:03:10] do all these things that christ did
[2:03:12] i have seen it demonstrated myself by
[2:03:15] the holy spirit
[2:03:16] so the potentials are here so that is
[2:03:19] why the prophet said
[2:03:20] what we see manifested temporarily will
[2:03:23] be manifested in the fullness
[2:03:25] when the press come down so he saw
[2:03:28] by manifestation the power that will be
[2:03:32] hallelujah and god demonstrated to the
[2:03:35] prophet by speaking to the storm
[2:03:36] by speaking for his wife's tumor healing
[2:03:38] creation pull over the element
[2:03:40] he demonstrated all this and say all of
[2:03:42] this package is for the bride
[2:03:45] but it's coming down the road because
[2:03:48] you expect by down the road
[2:03:49] all the character will be in us you
[2:03:52] expect down the road we will be like
[2:03:53] jesus
[2:03:55] so we won't be abusing one another and
[2:03:56] getting the devil a holiday
[2:03:58] we'll be living like christ and giving
[2:04:00] the devil a headache
[2:04:02] because lord we fight one another the
[2:04:04] devil will have no work to do
[2:04:05] he is somehow why he's somewhere under
[2:04:07] some umbrella relaxing himself by the
[2:04:09] beach
[2:04:10] people said them fellas fighting one
[2:04:11] another let him keep fighting and
[2:04:13] sometimes
[2:04:13] another text to keep on fighting send
[2:04:15] something in between give somebody a
[2:04:17] mind battle keep on fighting
[2:04:18] send some wrong data some fake news
[2:04:22] some false news and people absorb it
[2:04:25] they take it as
[2:04:26] what is that what they say and instead
[2:04:28] of verifying everything they tell
[2:04:29] somebody else
[2:04:31] and everybody going in a bad mood a bad
[2:04:34] mood
[2:04:34] and that's what we are looking at inside
[2:04:36] of here and that's why i don't burn you
[2:04:38] with no foolishness
[2:04:39] because i don't know foolishness upon
[2:04:40] you anybody could come here and preach
[2:04:42] the gospel
[2:04:44] but um what do you mean by the comments
[2:04:46] i say listen you offend it i said listen
[2:04:48] if you preach the word the people see
[2:04:50] amen and glory i say if you preach any
[2:04:52] strange thing they will look at your
[2:04:53] soul
[2:04:54] [Music]
[2:04:57] i turned out my office i said preach
[2:04:59] where you want to preach
[2:05:01] i say if a preacher is strengthening i
[2:05:02] said my people do so
[2:05:06] because the train really worked
[2:05:08] [Applause]

[2:05:18] could it be whatever it is
[2:05:21] suppose it's not coming into him
[2:05:25] whatever it is
[2:05:27] i wonder if we're not wondering if
[2:05:30] nothing
[2:05:30] god sent a prophet to give us dusty of
[2:05:33] the lord
[2:05:34] [Applause]
[2:05:41] see the moon outside and the moon mean
[2:05:42] this and istan mean this and jupiter

[2:16:16] what god's heart known for tonight he
[2:16:18] longs for it in dallas
[2:16:20] in every place in the world a breakdown
[2:16:22] of prejudice
[2:16:23] a cleanup from the pulpit all the way to
[2:16:25] basement an old-fashioned revival
[2:16:27] that will shake the nominations together
[2:16:30] and will
[2:16:30] fill the real church of the living god
[2:16:33] shake hands with holiness baptist
[2:16:35] methodist pentecostal nazarene
[2:16:36] he longs to get into our fellowship and
[2:16:38] his people to come in and commune
[2:16:40] and to bring you something good but the
[2:16:43] church
[2:16:43] and the people keeps him away because
[2:16:46] you see
[2:16:47] well that group don't believe just like
[2:16:50] i do
[2:16:52] we are reading he said what difference
[2:16:54] does that make
[2:16:56] that has nothing to do
[2:16:59] with it we are christians
[2:17:02] born again in the same family a bunch of
[2:17:05] pilgrims and here they quote
[2:17:07] like it's right here we will never see
[2:17:09] eye to eye
[2:17:11] until we see him face to face and be
[2:17:14] changed
[2:17:14] and made into his glorious own brother
[2:17:19] so stop trying to look at somebody's eye
[2:17:21] and say see like my eye
[2:17:24] because i might be seeing coke next man
[2:17:25] seeing sprite next man seeing coffee
[2:17:27] like my seeing orange like my seeing
[2:17:29] red mekman sea and orange juice
[2:17:33] so don't try we cannot look to see eye
[2:17:37] to eye
[2:17:38] we could see the purpose of god and see
[2:17:41] what the spirit
[2:17:42] is trying to accomplish what is a man's
[2:17:44] motive and objective and that's what ram
[2:17:46] says you don't judge a man by his church
[2:17:48] you judge a man by his motive and
[2:17:50] objective
[2:17:51] what he's trying to achieve and then if

[2:30:14] oh my so i'm going me skip quickly uh
[2:30:17] something but i'm talking about the
[2:30:19] beast and anytime the devil put up power
[2:30:22] a white horse red horse tail was god's
[2:30:24] release of power also
[2:30:26] to come back to the enemy so when god
[2:30:28] saw the first antichrist was writing
[2:30:29] with a teaching
[2:30:30] he was teaching his writing word so god
[2:30:33] sent the teaching out the word
[2:30:35] the lion of the tribe of judah which is
[2:30:39] the word made manifest by the holy
[2:30:42] spirit
[2:30:44] that is what god to compact what the
[2:30:46] devil had to offer
[2:30:48] he lose what the word made manifest
[2:30:52] by the holy spirit that was the line of
[2:30:54] judah oh praise god thank you lord jesus
[2:30:57] in this scripture
[2:30:58] hallelujah so remember he keeps his
[2:31:00] blessings and he keeps his curses
[2:31:02] every promise god keeps you have to
[2:31:04] choose which one you want
[2:31:06] his blessings by believing or his
[2:31:08] christians
[2:31:09] by perverting it if you pervert it and
[2:31:12] believe the perversion side of it
[2:31:14] you are cursed if you believe it the way
[2:31:17] he wrote it and hold on to it then you
[2:31:19] are blessed
[2:31:20] oh my hallelujah
[2:31:23] praise god brother brahm said this now
[2:31:27] he said we find out in revelation 3
[2:31:29] there's to be three church ages in this
[2:31:31] age did you know that
[2:31:32] he said then he talked about elements
[2:31:34] three three elements justification
[2:31:36] sound vacation a holy ghost pentecost
[2:31:38] three messengers
[2:31:39] they're coming in the last time now we
[2:31:42] find out
[2:31:43] that the rain listen the holy spirit
[2:31:45] being poured out in the last days do you
[2:31:46] believe it is to be poured out
[2:31:48] upon what upon what somebody is sowing
[2:31:51] seeds
[2:31:52] to bring forth his latter day crop so
[2:31:54] the holy spirit is the fall upon what
[2:31:56] upon seeds i'll restore saith the lord
[2:31:59] what will i do i will bring her back to
[2:32:02] her original condition
[2:32:04] listen careful i will bring her back to
[2:32:06] her original doctrine
[2:32:07] i will bring her back to original word i
[2:32:09] will break every nomination to pieces
[2:32:11] i will bring her back to my word so
[2:32:13] maybe i better shut up boy stop i will
[2:32:15] bring her back
[2:32:16] and when you get away from the word you
[2:32:18] got away from god
[2:32:19] you got away from the principles you got
[2:32:21] away from the holy spirit you got it
[2:32:23] from everything the devil will give you
[2:32:24] something false
[2:32:26] but it will never be a record of it so
[2:32:28] anytime people get off the word
[2:32:30] devil dare to give them something false
[2:32:32] oh praise the name of the lord
[2:32:33] the bible is to be finished the gentile
[2:32:35] dispensation is to be finished
[2:32:37] with the church age when this anointed
[2:32:39] messenger arrives of course
[2:32:41] he will plant the seed of the entire
[2:32:42] bible plum from the serpent to the
[2:32:44] messenger of the four marine
[2:32:45] so brother branham came to plant the
[2:32:47] seed of the entire bible
[2:32:49] and the bible is in three levels the
[2:32:52] zodiac
[2:32:52] the pyramid and this physical bible so
[2:32:55] he came to plant the bible
[2:32:56] which is the pyramid inside of you and
[2:32:59] today
[2:33:00] you have a pyramid inside of you which
[2:33:02] is the seed
[2:33:04] of the entire bible the secret the word
[2:33:07] in the bride
[2:33:09] so all these mysteries all these
[2:33:10] unfolding of the word is the bible
[2:33:13] sealed inside of you the mystery of god
[2:33:16] come built from god as the word of god
[2:33:19] and that is what is taught and preached
[2:33:20] and that is what inside of you oh glory
[2:33:23] to god
[2:33:24] so listen i believe that christ has a
[2:33:26] church
[2:33:27] and the church is the field we will get
[2:33:29] into it and you have got to get the word
[2:33:31] in the field
[2:33:32] before the spirit can do anything so
[2:33:35] all these years god was getting the word
[2:33:38] into the field
[2:33:39] you are the field and the word is the
[2:33:41] conductor of the spirit
[2:33:42] so if god will lay down the plumbing and
[2:33:44] the electric wire
[2:33:46] the current car flow through it so all
[2:33:48] these years god was wiring up the church
[2:33:50] and god is about to pull along the
[2:33:53] breaker
[2:33:54] hallelujah because the inspector when
[2:33:57] you buy your house you have that
[2:33:58] inspector
[2:34:00] how's the government inspect the house
[2:34:01] if the inspector don't inspect the house
[2:34:03] the house could burn down
[2:34:04] especially now if they have a faulty
[2:34:06] electrician or a lesser general didn't
[2:34:08] get a certificate
[2:34:09] or some kind of bogus or half-washed
[2:34:11] electrician he cannot cross the wires
[2:34:13] and make it wrong
[2:34:14] so then you flick this thing so bab post
[2:34:16] bon dong
[2:34:17] hallelujah so they have an inspector to
[2:34:20] inspect the wiring
[2:34:21] oh glory to god then you get approval
[2:34:25] to get connection to the source
[2:34:28] to the power source hallelujah
[2:34:32] oh glory to god so when the inspector
[2:34:34] come down and look down
[2:34:35] and see all the wiring's in order we're
[2:34:37] ready for connection
[2:34:39] and i feel today we're ready for
[2:34:41] connection
[2:34:42] god wants to connect you to the source
[2:34:46] all glory to god my my mind
[2:34:49] i'm almost finished just back i'm going
[2:34:50] to wrap up i know you're hungry
[2:34:53] but this is food food for your soul
[2:34:56] you're going to get food for your body
[2:34:58] but this is food
[2:34:59] [Applause]
[2:35:01] all right mori
[2:35:04] then the kind of seed you have planted
[2:35:05] in your field will be the kind of crop
[2:35:07] you will reap
[2:35:09] mori is for marine or plantain rain so
[2:35:12] you call it teaching
[2:35:13] planting rain it's a rain it's the
[2:35:16] atmosphere
[2:35:17] but it's the atmosphere to put in seed
[2:35:20] all right
[2:35:21] what happened the four marine is planted
[2:35:23] the unwise version
