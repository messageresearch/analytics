[23:53] about Jesus now when the time has come
[23:55] that he should be received up he
[23:59] steadfastly set his face to go to
[24:02] Jerusalem so when Jesus recognized the
[24:07] time is drawing near for him to be
[24:10] crucified he he set his face steadfastly
[24:15] towards Jerusalem you have to fix your
[24:20] position towards your destination you
[24:25] have to get focused on where you're

[45:29] get par with God that door open as the
[45:32] approach
[45:37] is that manpower it is got power and
[45:41] that's my brother madam said the world
[45:43] will bow at the feet of men and women
[45:45] who cross Jordan not just cross Jordan
[45:51] but cross Jordan go beyond Jordan and
[45:55] coming back because when he lies I came
[45:58] back the school that the Prophet said
[46:01] the spirit of Elijah but rest upon
[46:04] Elijah then oh he was coming back in
[46:08] power
[46:11] come on shame and somebody you may be
[46:16] seated
[46:16] but ask me he went across a son and he
[46:22] came back a manifested son did you
[46:26] understand that
[46:27] just across over yonder halves power the
[46:34] change and transform you from being a
[46:38] son into a manifested son where is a lot
[46:43] thought of Elijah and he smote the
[46:46] Jordan and he walk just like Elijah and
[46:49] Jesus said the same words I do
[46:56] we'll be walking like you will be
[46:59] talking like him we'll be manifesting
[47:01] what he manifests he said the same works
[47:04] the same works
[47:07] he cast out Devils we cast them out also
[47:12] heal the sick
[47:14] [Music]
[47:15] how many gotta say amen to that some
[47:19] people are still not saying it
[47:24] you maybe season you see when you look
[47:28] at yourself you don't want to say Amen
[47:29] because you're telling yourself you're
[47:31] not ready for that
[47:32] but God don't deal with where you are
[47:34] acting God deal with where you will be
[47:38] so Jesus could see what Peter was going
[47:41] through and said the devil wants if
[47:44] you're like wheat
[47:44] I see what the develop to but I pray not
[47:49] to get you out of your stuff but in the
[47:51] smiths of your stuff I pray that your
[47:54] feet don't feel because if your feet
[47:57] only feel all fall down because we live
[47:59] my feet we walk by faith your Christian
[48:02] life is my feet if they get delivered
[48:04] you're keeping deliverance by fit yes I
[48:06] keep a healing by fate if you let
[48:09] yourself drop the disease come back the
[48:11] product in your bind you comes back its
[48:13] next day to keep off the devil they can
[48:16] say to keep your healing deliverance
[48:20] I'm still walking and slackness it this
[48:24] time come on reach back to me somebody
[48:26] you need a hostage
[48:36] it is the currency of God that God
[48:40] respects all that I am all that I ever
[48:42] will be is based upon faith in this
[48:44] world that's God's currency so somebody
[48:48] could be a Christian there for 30 40
[48:50] years and have no faith and somebody
[48:52] walk in a building may be a sinner maybe
[48:55] a whatever it is and they have faith and

[51:49] you know doctors for past a point a
[51:53] man's Ronnie man Walker a poor boy poor
[51:55] he's a deacon support he's look at the
[52:01] lot of people in church looking to
[52:03] harass people by their hogs and do this
[52:05] all these ice power because I'm and put
[52:09] that man in power that's not power with
[52:12] God send that police amigo la that's a
[52:15] wolf not me somebody else Pau with God I
[52:23] want you to focus on man Machias by try
[52:27] no no I don't wanna study trials this
[52:29] morning my situation don't study that
[52:32] study what the power God will do for you
[52:36] in your situation notice notice Moses in
[52:45] his intellectual condition kill a man
[52:47] and run that is having an understanding
[52:49] of his calling intellectually with no
[52:52] power he just had a power to fight
[52:56] Amanda if I time and on kill a man and I
[53:00] recognize where listen this trouble you
[53:01] know run so he had read in power without
[53:06] power notice when he got in contact with
[53:10] the pillar of fire he was alone wife not
[53:15] with him
[53:16] children not with him deep not with him
[53:22] alone
[53:23] this power thing is the loop thing
[53:27] [Music]
[53:34] and a lot of people caught up the cause
[53:36] they want the group support they want
[53:38] group v saved when Moses met eternal
[53:44] fire and God finish with him I like that
[53:48] he was ready to face anything you write
[53:53] the face what he ran from question what
[53:58] are you running from Moses couldn't run
[54:04] from his past
[54:05] Aquila man not only record book he
[54:11] couldn't say let me be struck off by a
[54:14] news history but that had changing what
[54:17] God think about Moses that doesn't
[54:19] change what God purposes has a Moses
[54:21] life and whatever you have done that
[54:24] does not change God's about your life
[54:33] the past I can't stop it the elder can
[54:36] stop it
[54:37] he can't ah stop it your past I'll stop
[54:40] it your sins can't even stop it
[54:44] because God said my world shall not
[54:51] return unto me void
[54:55] so once he sentences without it's good
[54:58] as done thy word is separate forever in
[55:03] the heavens God set up word concerning
[55:08] you the devil is finished this morning
[55:11] you gonna get a breakthrough I feel it
[55:14] gonna be now right now the service the
[55:18] devilish finish this morning are gonna
[55:21] come into your life I believe it that's
[55:25] why I'm preaching it he has to get it
[55:29] [Applause]
[55:36] oh let's go further I can't believe this
[55:41] after believe it who we were speaking
[55:46] about all the mysteries not to reveal to
[55:48] the Brian when he went down the road he
[55:54] said know how anybody got a revised
[55:55] version of the Bible is that the eagle
[55:58] the messenger of the loudest and church
[56:00] age Russian 10 1 2 7
[56:02] he said he come down he put one foot
[56:04] upon the land one foot upon the sea and
[56:07] then time shall be no more when it did
[56:11] seven thunders uttered a voices I when
[56:14] the seven thunders of the divorce is
[56:16] John said I water right is it on righted
[56:17] he sealed it is the power I wanna get to
[56:22] someone say well that seven seas then
[56:26] but I Branham talked about Sam thunders
[56:28] that seven seas speaking about what you
[56:30] see talk about there seven others will
[56:33] reave in the last days
[56:35] are you ready some great mystery how we
[56:41] get closer to God that's a question here
[56:48] the answer no sir it can't be it's
[56:52] whosoever shall take one from the Bible
[56:55] or other one water it is possibly take
[56:56] not from the book of life what it is is
[56:59] a revelation on what has been missed
[57:03] back there it's already wrote but it's
[57:08] to reveal what has already been written
[57:11] that is what the Tundra's is about now
[57:15] the reason I presented that to you is to
[57:18] identify that the revelation of the
[57:21] seven thunders is not the key how to get
[57:26] closer to God in that sense so in ours
[57:29] the thunders doesn't make you bypass
[57:32] Jordan
[57:33] [Music]
[57:36] he had a question again dem seven seals
[57:40] will be reveal some great mystery hall
[57:44] we get closer to God he said no it's a
[57:55] reveal was it what's written that's what
[57:59] that is about
[58:00] but God has revealed how to get closer
[58:02] to him by faith by virtue by knowledge
[58:06] by temperance by patience by Jordan so
[58:10] none of what the seven thunders can make
[58:11] you bypass dead people believe sins
[58:17] haven't under 700 fada what that what
[58:20] that means no Jordan that means not
[58:23] there no dying out no crucifixion when
[58:27] God took a prophet and God took away his
[58:30] wife God took away his shyer God took
[58:34] away the anointed caught up a black
[58:36] sheet over him and he was that Elijah if
[58:39] God could take a son to true all of that
[58:42] and when but Iran was preaching adoption
[58:44] he was say he was just testing me going
[58:47] through it it doesn't look like tests
[58:49] but he was just testing me because they
[58:51] Elijah got about 10 years to fit into
[58:54] the mantle God not cut any mantle to fit
[58:57] you God cut in you to fit the mantle the
[59:00] mantle have the size cut shape already
[59:02] if you have to get cut it took Elijah
[59:05] some time to grow to meet the mantle
[59:09] that is why that particular time ago
[59:12] said praise God stay here stay here stay
[59:14] here to see what's in that man to see if
[59:18] he will cope a stay here stay here stay
[59:20] here I am not staying until I meet up to
[59:24] what God purpose and predestination for
[59:28] my life I am not staying anywhere
[59:30] [Applause]
[59:34] notice there was no friends around him
[59:36] there was no family with him
[59:39] there was no brother sister mother
[59:41] husband oh no that's Elijah alone and
[59:44] that is horror must come to him
[59:47] you gotta be caught alone like Jacob
[59:53] Jacobs and his family here his wife here
[59:56] this one here that one year is property
[59:58] here all his things yeah and he was
[1:00:00] caught alone God wanted that and some of
[1:00:04] you is still not alone her cellphone
[1:00:06] ringing and he texted Texan I mean

[1:01:22] shut it off it is a half an hour hour
[1:01:24] you got to do it to make time to connect
[1:01:28] with your God we need that connection we
[1:01:32] need that empowerment you see this B's
[1:01:37] system making magic if the people from
[1:01:44] long ago come now and they see what's
[1:01:46] happening you know what I will say which
[1:01:48] graph you put a car in a machine and
[1:01:52] Monica move that's witchcraft you take
[1:01:59] some military air and put it on talking
[1:02:00] to somebody as miles away which graph
[1:02:03] that will be a mystery for somebody 200
[1:02:07] years ago come back and see you talking
[1:02:09] on the phone what's that
[1:02:11] do you smoke signals long time one smoke
[1:02:15] mean yes maybe to smoke me no I don't
[1:02:17] know maybe three smoke means how are you
[1:02:21] it had no faxes had no phone so what
[1:02:25] they will see know is like we're doing
[1:02:27] magic well that is what the B system is
[1:02:30] supposed to do profuse miracles powers
[1:02:34] relying on science and technology there
[1:02:38] is no need for God
[1:02:41] [Applause]
[1:02:44] long time you need translation power to
[1:02:47] move five this senses like Philip no you
[1:02:52] can take a taxi or maxi or Evelyn long
[1:02:56] time was different it was power that was
[1:02:59] the test needed it was power that was
[1:03:02] calling for not man power
[1:03:05] woman hi not man of the hour coming to
[1:03:09] bring some revelation we are 40 plus
[1:03:12] years of that it's the power of God and
[1:03:21] Paul Paul said this way when I come
[1:03:23] among you I come here with weakness and
[1:03:25] fear and trembling that your faith may
[1:03:27] not rest in the wisdom of men but in the
[1:03:31] power of God so he didn't want them to
[1:03:35] get get caught up in his intellectual
[1:03:37] capacity to Brazil mysteries and word he
[1:03:41] wanted him to be get caught up in the
[1:03:42] God that was behind the intellectual
[1:03:45] stuff that he was presenting that when
[1:03:47] he walk away they will have faith in the
[1:03:49] God that he presented by the word
[1:03:52] because the power wasn't God understand
[1:03:56] is all these think of me preach without
[1:03:58] power all the mysteries could be
[1:04:01] preached without inspiration
[1:04:02] it could be spotty and just plain
[1:04:05] intellect humans speaking but when God
[1:04:08] began to move the Bible talk about men
[1:04:10] of all moves by the Holy Ghost that's
[1:04:13] different
[1:04:14] [Applause]
[1:04:17] I would hate to think that I'm doing
[1:04:23] this not inspired just intellectual just
[1:04:27] studying a man reading understand what
[1:04:29] the presets do college etiologies do
[1:04:31] breaking on Greek and walking all kind
[1:04:34] of mystery something inside of it and
[1:04:36] they will come and lecture and so on you
[1:04:37] ever went to a Catholic sermon and a
[1:04:39] funeral very polished and then they have
[1:04:43] this sacrament that Nadezhda sacrament
[1:04:45] and is smoking up on the smoking up when
[1:04:49] the fear is there it looks so classy but
[1:04:54] I just been intellect God not in that
[1:04:57] coordinate inspiring that but we have to
[1:05:00] see God coming to inspire the word to us
[1:05:04] that's why you need to be in the spirit
[1:05:06] that the Spirit could reveal himself to
[1:05:09] you and bring revelation to you when you
[1:05:12] leave there your leader will prevail in
[1:05:13] power it doesn't change the situation at
[1:05:16] home it doesn't change whatever it is
[1:05:18] but it changes you because you had the
[1:05:22] object of God to change the devil trying
[1:05:26] to get your side shows that's why I hate
[1:05:30] blaming I like when people own up notice
[1:05:37] what the angel asked Jacob
[1:05:38] what's-her-name who are you Jacob Salma
[1:05:44] I'm a businessman very well do you want
[1:05:47] that you know I deserve a break
[1:05:50] no he didn't say that he was a schemer
[1:05:53] I don't think people understand
[1:06:00] yeah but Jacob and Jacob and Jacob but
[1:06:03] you do know how much people do the
[1:06:04] scheming mother father brother he's keep
[1:06:06] everybody if if you're ready understand
[1:06:12] Jacob you didn't want to talk with a man
[1:06:14] because you'll be watching the pocket
[1:06:15] you'll be watching it kill you you
[1:06:19] capture him because he will rip you off
[1:06:23] which eyes open nice Jacob and God said
[1:06:28] check out my love we're not going on
[1:06:32] Esau he hit we're not going there we
[1:06:34] just stickin with the reading Jacob I
[1:06:39] love what did God see in Jacob he had a
[1:06:45] desire for the boot right so do you
[1:06:56] understand you cannot bypass the life of
[1:07:02] Jesus Christ by mysteries by knowledge
[1:07:06] by information by teachings you still
[1:07:12] have to get to the life because the
[1:07:15] Prophet said that's the Thunder that
[1:07:19] shakes the devil not not the coach no no
[1:07:26] the light that's the Tunde because he
[1:07:29] Satan get in contact with power already
[1:07:30] you know and it sends him when Jesus
[1:07:34] gave his fault he can I forget that you
[1:07:38] ever get pushing hand in a socket and a
[1:07:40] shock there's some people no don't like
[1:07:43] to touch anything electrical because it
[1:07:45] was shock before that's what Satan got
[1:07:48] from Jesus he was shocked with a fault
[1:07:50] from it is written he caught that and he
[1:07:53] canceled it again that's why he'll be so
[1:07:56] mad at those who remain because the
[1:07:59] bride will give him a shock
[1:08:02] he don't understand who you are he don't
[1:08:05] even believe who you are how could you
[1:08:07] believe it
[1:08:08] Jacob you trickster you how could you
[1:08:15] believe a few have already changed
[1:08:19] [Music]
[1:08:20] you are a history that he knows but you
[1:08:25] have a history that God knows which
[1:08:28] history is right your history is already
[1:08:31] in God
[1:08:33] [Applause]
[1:08:36] Oh glory hallelujah don't let the devil
[1:08:39] open his history book boo back in God's
[1:08:42] book that's why the angel came by the
[1:08:45] open book to reveal who you really are
[1:08:48] not your flesh history your genetic God
[1:08:52] history when you come from God he went
[1:08:55] back to God listen with the power of God
[1:08:58] you would slap up those trials you would
[1:09:01] crush the things that on he would walk
[1:09:05] on water you would walk on your
[1:09:08] situation you will stop feeling weak
[1:09:11] weak weak and say I am strong strong
[1:09:14] strong
[1:09:22] we stopped that Oh hallelujah
[1:09:26] okay let's one forward we're going slow
[1:09:30] but sure I'm not hurry I'm fine I'm fine

[1:09:44] many say if the law will take this evil
[1:09:48] spirit from me from drinking from
[1:09:53] gambling from lying or stealing our
[1:09:56] servant but that's up to you you have
[1:10:01] got to do something - Dina overcomes
[1:10:06] shall inherit all things they that
[1:10:10] overcome you have power to do it but you
[1:10:18] must be willing to lay it down you see
[1:10:21] she has made herself ready I like that
[1:10:24] you see God could not push us through a
[1:10:27] little pipe pull us all the other end
[1:10:30] and let's say blessing is here
[1:10:33] overcoming you are nothing to overcome
[1:10:37] he just push you true but you have got
[1:10:41] to make decisions yourself I have to
[1:10:45] make decisions for myself and in doing
[1:10:48] that we show our faith and respect to
[1:10:53] God I love decisions because decisions

[1:16:05] day
[1:16:05] Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh let's take
[1:16:10] Alfred ah Martin Luther saw it he come
[1:16:13] out the Catalan ISM what did they do
[1:16:15] they built a little fence we are
[1:16:16] Lutheran's this is it the better fence
[1:16:20] then West become what they say the Bella
[1:16:22] fence
[1:16:22] this is it and the light move on then
[1:16:25] because I was what what they do
[1:16:27] Wesley on all and build fences he said
[1:16:30] we cannot do that we cannot do that we
[1:16:37] have got to follow there we go
[1:16:39] are you ready we got to follow every day
[1:16:42] every hour of the day every step of the
[1:16:46] way we have got to be led by the Lord
[1:16:49] Jesus Christ if we don't we get on an
[1:16:54] organizational life and a life that
[1:16:58] doesn't follow Christ daily is not
[1:17:00] worthy
[1:17:02] remember organization is mark of the
[1:17:05] beast and that's what I tell you people
[1:17:07] talking on behalf of the church they
[1:17:09] have a church life they don't have a
[1:17:11] real Christian life because the
[1:17:13] Christian life you take up your cross
[1:17:15] dearly not Sun daily I know that's not a
[1:17:18] word not monthly but daily not Sunday
[1:17:23] that the cross on my time ago long
[1:17:24] stairs the cross off your back no you'll
[1:17:26] follow him daily
[1:17:29] analyze that doesn't follow Christ daily
[1:17:32] is not worthy a man as a Christian on
[1:17:35] Sunday then goes to church and set back
[1:17:37] I think he owns the church because he
[1:17:39] does this that the other
[1:17:40] I'm under a stealing lying woman I
[1:17:42] report on the public beaches I'm upon
[1:17:44] the streets and moral clothes on they
[1:17:46] take the spirit of the world that don't
[1:17:48] belong in the 2000 Living God praise the
[1:17:51] name of the Lord yet is now this is sea
[1:17:54] time bright time the shock is dead the
[1:17:57] shocks are tried up virgin would time
[1:17:59] not touched his virgin virgin would and
[1:18:02] listen
[1:18:03] there will be no denominational man
[1:18:06] Hamlin in the Virgin boot of the bride
[1:18:09] she is commanded by God to come on Asajj
[1:18:12] so the bride calling her allow the bride
[1:18:14] to be manhandled
[1:18:15] that's why court were to deliver the
[1:18:18] brain out of the spirit of man number
[1:18:22] six because the bride has to get the
[1:18:24] word from a husband oh jesus here we go
[1:18:27] love this a Christian is not a tool or
[1:18:31] some kind of mechanical wrench to a
[1:18:35] great big religious regime a Christian
[1:18:38] is not some kind of tool that keeps a
[1:18:41] religious organization moving that's not
[1:18:44] a Christian a Christian is to be
[1:18:47] christ-like and a Christian cannot be a
[1:18:50] Christian until Christ come into the man
[1:18:53] the life of Christ in him then it
[1:18:58] produces the life of Christ lived and
[1:19:00] you do the things that Christ did what
[1:19:03] am I talking about a personal
[1:19:05] relationship to Christ you come to
[1:19:08] church but do your relationship with
[1:19:09] Jesus Christ because that makes the
[1:19:11] whole difference it changed the whole
[1:19:13] perspective that you are not alone you
[1:19:16] are connected to God
[1:19:18] Oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:19:21] Lord
[1:19:21] please so there's only one way to get
[1:19:24] into the church that is by both
[1:19:26] Christians you must have a personal
[1:19:30] relationship to God in order to be a son
[1:19:32] of God you must become relations to God
[1:19:35] he must be your father in order for you
[1:19:37] to be a son and only as sons and
[1:19:40] daughters are saved not the members of
[1:19:42] the church but sons and daughters
[1:19:44] there's only one thing that can produce
[1:19:46] that and that's the new birth and if you
[1:19:49] are born again your entire nita is
[1:19:52] changed and God himself what you become
[1:19:56] a prisoner to him now you become a love
[1:19:58] prisoner other men can smoke the work
[1:20:01] and laugh make fun but you are prisoner
[1:20:03] to Christ
[1:20:04] other men can smoke and drink and carry
[1:20:06] on if they want to Collins have
[1:20:08] Christians deacons in preachers but not
[1:20:09] you
[1:20:10] your prisoner your prisoner to
[1:20:14] notice God making himself known we are
[1:20:17] not supposed to make converts to
[1:20:19] Christianity by government dying by
[1:20:22] hunting books and tapes and we bringing
[1:20:23] people to the Lord and what not watch
[1:20:25] he said no watch but by the revelation
[1:20:28] that Christ is in you and God was in
[1:20:31] Christ and God was in Christ and Christ
[1:20:33] is in you and what God in Christ Christ
[1:20:36] does in you so we're not even supposed
[1:20:38] to make converts by government we
[1:20:41] supposed to make convert by revelation
[1:20:43] isn't that right
[1:20:44] not by legalism look what you're here
[1:20:47] don't do this don't do this we had that
[1:20:48] for 40 plus years what has it brought
[1:20:51] about churches but where is the power of
[1:20:54] God manifested or praise the name of the
[1:20:57] Lord we believe that what is it is being
[1:21:00] filled with the spirit him having the
[1:21:02] preeminence 'yes that's what cords
[1:21:04] achievement
[1:21:05] that's God's purpose to do that he might
[1:21:08] be in Christ and Christ in us and all of
[1:21:11] us together the Holy Spirit the same
[1:21:13] thing revealed it to Christ revealed
[1:21:16] here the supernatural creative power now
[1:21:19] listen close nor the church nor the sign
[1:21:22] nor the fellowship nor the government
[1:21:25] nor the testimony nor decreed no
[1:21:29] denomination is accepted outside of this
[1:21:31] God except nothing else but Christ in
[1:21:34] you may God help us here this morning to
[1:21:38] see the burden of the world that what
[1:21:40] God really trying to get his Christ in
[1:21:42] you the hope of glory you see God is not
[1:21:45] in this bishop fruiting a bishop over
[1:21:46] his people God in the purifier coming
[1:21:49] inside of you hallelujah
[1:21:52] remember the pillar fire before God
[1:21:54] identify God above us then God with us
[1:21:57] in Christ then his purpose was because
[1:21:59] in us the object was caught to come in
[1:22:01] his people not man ruling over man but
[1:22:05] court ruling in man
[1:22:07] you've been a powered son so God come
[1:22:10] and put a power generator inside of you
[1:22:11] and you begin to light up others others
[1:22:16] from your mouth others be empowered and
[1:22:19] then the whole kingdom being
[1:22:21] revolutionized by sons of God because
[1:22:24] that's what God was originally let us
[1:22:27] make man and multiply and replenish is
[1:22:29] not right
[1:22:30] how Dominion and multiply is not right
[1:22:33] upon the earth so Adam was to reproduce
[1:22:35] other sons so we have a kingdom of sons
[1:22:38] but then the devil injected himself and
[1:22:41] that's where we get the battle that we
[1:22:44] have this morning Oh glory to God so
[1:22:47] Balaram says and God accept nothing
[1:22:48] about Christ a new group of glory
[1:22:50] the only thing that God recognizes no
[1:22:52] fellowship no church no creed no
[1:22:55] denomination it is dead it is fragment
[1:22:58] that neither be cut off all this church
[1:23:00] thing and message and no that had to be
[1:23:02] cut off it has to be powered son people
[1:23:04] can't judge you by what coop you go to
[1:23:06] church true that's what I have to do
[1:23:08] know who is a pastor and I won't know
[1:23:10] whether here did the eyeball thing up so
[1:23:12] and they forward thing up to because
[1:23:16] they do like a pastor trouble you see

[1:40:37] this morning you see what around said it
[1:40:39] this way Jesus look beyond the cross and
[1:40:43] saw the glory of the resurrection that
[1:40:47] [Music]
[1:40:48] made the cross a little easier when you
[1:40:53] could see beyond Jordan that means
[1:40:56] die not not so bad

[1:41:22] God wanted to die out oh I want you to
[1:41:25] understand about Jesus did he such as
[1:41:27] face towards Jerusalem but that is where
[1:41:30] he was headin to the cross because you
[1:41:34] cannot go to the resurrection if I don't

[1:41:38] resurrection glory and power you have to
[1:41:41] go to the crucifixion but you can't
[1:41:43] justify crucifixion Oh God well I'm died
[1:41:45] but is it destroy this body I'll raise
[1:41:47] it up you have to see beyond Jordan you
[1:41:51] have to see the glory of coming back we
[1:41:53] turn in the power of the Spirit the
[1:41:57] shock there's no more left watch but the
[1:42:01] green is that right it has got to be the
[1:42:03] green it has got to be the same kind
[1:42:05] that went into the ground Jesus Christ
[1:42:08] the same yesterday ever he had a promise
[1:42:10] a Spirit come upon the bride to do the
[1:42:14] same thing that he did it's reproducing
[1:42:18] again of the green so after peravaram
[1:42:21] came and left what we have to see is
[1:42:25] that green rapid
[1:42:28] we have had the Ministry of teaching the
[1:42:31] teachers and prophecy of what is to come
[1:42:34] but that comes an hour when a key is 10
[1:42:36] and the spirit begins to anoint to bring
[1:42:40] life to the seed and that will produce
[1:42:43] another grain again it is not right to
[1:42:46] reproduce in the green same life same
[1:42:49] science so the word your Young's pick
[1:42:51] fits this I'm seen on every show
[1:42:53] there is a secret of the message now the
[1:42:55] father's business the secret of the
[1:42:57] message is what the father's business
[1:43:00] and the father's business was to fulfill
[1:43:02] Isaiah of will shall conceive a
[1:43:04] fulfilled what I said the lame shall
[1:43:06] leap like a heart of the Lord I caught
[1:43:08] shall reveal a prophet unto me it was
[1:43:10] the father's business
[1:43:11] what is it now question we must be about
[1:43:15] the Father's business the REIT would cry
[1:43:17] back the green what must do there we go
[1:43:21] finding it Malachi for vindicate cook
[1:43:24] some dented a finicky Hebrews 13:8 sent
[1:43:26] John 14:12 vindicate provision 10 that's
[1:43:30] what the green must do right now we when
[1:43:33] people see what's happening now the
[1:43:34] Massey be moved of a truth God send a
[1:43:36] prophet because these are the children
[1:43:39] whose hearts have been turned back to
[1:43:41] the faith of our fathers we will
[1:43:43] vindicate William Branham we will Finley
[1:43:46] Kate the message of the hour we will
[1:43:48] vindicate what we stood for for all
[1:43:51] these years
[1:43:52] don't want to back us up but power with
[1:43:55] science with wonders with miracles and
[1:43:58] there'll be no dispute about it they
[1:44:01] will have to say the spirit Elijah
[1:44:06] rest on Elijah Oh hallelujah praise God
[1:44:13] Oh with God not the ministers
[1:44:17] Association
[1:44:18] you lost poor them long time hallelujah

[1:44:37] more we know warming up hallelujah
[1:44:41] alright let's go talk about Jacob a
[1:44:45] little bit you know I love hope we're on
[1:44:47] brought it out in his presence too after
[1:44:49] Jacob rest all night and confessing his
[1:44:51] sins he called a place penny on penny
[1:44:54] tell the whooping yell and the Hebrew
[1:44:56] means the feast of Almighty God
[1:44:58] Jacob had his name was Jacob which means
[1:45:01] a planter that's a deceiver I run all of
[1:45:05] his life are we from God you hear that
[1:45:09] he run all his life are we from God now
[1:45:14] if that was a Jacob in our own that we
[1:45:16] know we say oh he you know the seed he
[1:45:20] ain't comin in here on a running watch
[1:45:24] but he got a hold upon God
[1:45:26] I won't even lose God we need more
[1:45:29] Jacobs he held on to the face of God in
[1:45:32] the presence of God he steal until it
[1:45:34] was son of God said let me go the son is
[1:45:36] arising he steered in the face of God
[1:45:39] he went away justified and saved what a
[1:45:42] great thing it was to know he and
[1:45:44] Russell true that he had seed signs of
[1:45:47] God he are not dreams about God but this
[1:45:49] was one time he was in the face of God
[1:45:52] in the presence of God think of it
[1:45:55] friends as we hurry up in the presence
[1:45:58] of God - change Jacob was change no he
[1:46:02] could walk with God he was a different
[1:46:04] man that when he went up there the
[1:46:06] battle was now over yes sir
[1:46:07] he began to build altar he hadn't been
[1:46:10] used to building altars you know I tell
[1:46:12] you when you come in the presence of God
[1:46:14] you want
[1:46:15] bill an order somewhere you want to find
[1:46:17] somewhere you can pray now Jacob was
[1:46:20] changed from Jacob to Israel a prince
[1:46:22] having power with God that is what
[1:46:25] happened to Jacob the deceiver
[1:46:28] are you ready the unrighteous the unholy
[1:46:31] the deceiver he deceived his brother
[1:46:34] stole the birthright from his brother
[1:46:37] and a little dirty way of doing it such
[1:46:39] a deceiver he deceive his father-in-law
[1:46:41] put popular sticks and mixed pack of
[1:46:44] cards when the calls be impregnated come
[1:46:46] here and look at it
[1:46:47] he deceive his mother he deceive his
[1:46:50] daddy he deceive his brother he was
[1:46:52] running everywhere he went
[1:46:54] always on a run from God he was on the
[1:46:56] run from his brother but when he come
[1:46:58] into the presence of God he recognized
[1:47:00] he was a sinner what did he do what did
[1:47:02] he do he's seen his opportunity he had
[1:47:05] met something he didn't even think about
[1:47:07] before and he stayed there until all
[1:47:10] sins was gone
[1:47:12] God manages a way to get men in their
[1:47:17] presence and they made the decisions
[1:47:19] some of them run from him some run to
[1:47:22] him and if their predestination life
[1:47:24] they believe it they hang on to it the
[1:47:26] guy that confessed his sins shall have
[1:47:28] pardon if you hide your sins you not
[1:47:30] prosper so Jacob you know the next day
[1:47:34] he met his brother Esau he didn't need
[1:47:36] no help from him then he didn't need our
[1:47:38] means he was in the business of building
[1:47:40] altars
[1:47:41] he wasn't afraid of Esau no more Oh
[1:47:44] hallelujah that contact with the angel
[1:47:48] that Rossler with God he didn't need no
[1:47:51] support no human support I need this one
[1:47:55] I need that one I need that I need that
[1:47:57] no you need God and God will bring on
[1:48:00] unfold all what you have need of David
[1:48:04] said I have set the Lord before me
[1:48:05] sounds sixteen eight that's a good thing
[1:48:07] to do I've set the Lord before me he
[1:48:11] wanted to be conscious of his presence
[1:48:14] so David said I have set the Lord always
[1:48:16] before my face watch that's a good
[1:48:20] lesson for us tonight set the Lord
[1:48:21] before face be conscious of his presence
[1:48:24] put him first but
[1:48:26] first before you why then you want sin
[1:48:29] when you realize that you are constantly
[1:48:32] in the presence of God when you realize
[1:48:35] God is are wrong you'll watch what you
[1:48:37] see a man many think God is gone
[1:48:40] Hira cuss he would lust after woman he
[1:48:43] will steal he will cheat he would lie he
[1:48:46] will do anything when he think that God
[1:48:47] don't see him but bring him in the
[1:48:49] presence of God he will stop it right
[1:48:51] now
[1:48:51] and David said I have put the law all
[1:48:54] before me that's a good thing
[1:48:56] no wonder no wonder God said he was a
[1:48:58] man after his own heart man will do
[1:49:00] anything when God is near but when you
[1:49:03] realized that God near and so forth
[1:49:06] Oh hallelujah so he said Jacob he
[1:49:09] watched all Jacob held on to all night

[1:59:15] what trying to say listen I have certain
[1:59:16] laws if they keep within those laws your
[1:59:18] best feelings flow freely the precursors
[1:59:20] lost you get in trouble Oh blessed be
[1:59:23] the name of the Lord let me see if I can
[1:59:25] wrap up here praise God is so much oh my
[1:59:29] so David when dear that's the matter
[1:59:31] today gorg another sheep that gone
[1:59:32] astray the organization and things are
[1:59:35] stole em out and brought them out in
[1:59:37] psychology God give us David's with the
[1:59:40] Word of God and the power of God to
[1:59:42] direct it when we go to these
[1:59:43] intellectual Giants with all your PhD
[1:59:45] whatever it might be
[1:59:46] give me the word and the Holy Ghost and
[1:59:49] I'll tell you we can sleep every giant
[1:59:51] on the field that's all we need today
[1:59:54] the word and the Holy Ghost and every
[1:59:57] giant and the field gonna be challenged
[1:59:59] I'm insane so today we know we need a
[2:00:03] revival we know we need a stir in
[2:00:05] amongst the people it will not take a
[2:00:07] doctor of divinity it will take a week
[2:00:09] hallelujah that will take the Word of
[2:00:10] God in the poor the resurrection of
[2:00:13] Christ and slitted sting if they're
[2:00:14] being Christ to the country it will let
[2:00:16] them see he can still opened up eyes of
[2:00:18] the blind heal the sick raise the dead
[2:00:20] he God as a conqueror we need a David
[2:00:23] untrained in theological schools we need
[2:00:26] a man who knows nothing about that just
[2:00:29] a poor boy some little guy which took
[2:00:31] shoulders not much to look at come
[2:00:33] walking on the road with the power of
[2:00:36] God hallelujah
[2:00:38] how many ministers could God use this
[2:00:40] morning if they'd only let God bind them
[2:00:42] with his word how would his power lose
[2:00:44] them from the strength of the
[2:00:46] denomination and organization how many
[2:00:48] sincere people in the city this morning
[2:00:50] that goes to great organization churches
[2:00:52] how many could be filled with the Holy
[2:00:53] Ghost and set the country afire with the
[2:00:55] gospel and the power if they'd only
[2:00:57] taken lose themselves from the power to
[2:01:00] have them bound by his spirit to be like
[2:01:03] Paul was a love sister God
[2:01:05] got to Paul I mean a sliver to him bond
[2:01:08] him to himself send him to the Gentiles
[2:01:11] which he hated you hear God take his
[2:01:16] power bind Paul his power and sent him
[2:01:20] to the Gentile which he hated but you
[2:01:23] see here we go
[2:01:24] he had to be loosed from his
[2:01:26] ecclesiastical power to be bound to the
[2:01:29] power of God do you understand that
[2:01:32] these churches all they bought in the
[2:01:35] message and all the message have a power
[2:01:39] but rank was an ecclesiastical power
[2:01:41] that binds the people but a power is
[2:01:46] coming to unbind them oh my way he had
[2:01:58] to lose his strength and become weak and
[2:02:00] nothing in order to receive the strength
[2:02:02] of God to be bombed to God to do what
[2:02:04] God would tell him to do he ever
[2:02:06] something to console us he has something
[2:02:08] that encourages out of weakness and
[2:02:10] humility God chooses the people
[2:02:12] developing a motive if we ever get to
[2:02:15] heaven if you ever stand on the presence
[2:02:18] of God in His Church we will stand in a
[2:02:20] bunch of people I mean weak rejected
[2:02:22] cast out of the world and no nothing a
[2:02:25] rabbit can run a squirrel can get in a
[2:02:27] tree a dog can bite the land can tear a
[2:02:30] horse can kick a bird can fly but a
[2:02:32] sheep stand helpless that's the way God
[2:02:34] wants us realize that we are totally
[2:02:37] insufficient then God can take that
[2:02:39] person begins to mold himself into that
[2:02:42] person make his highness do what God
[2:02:44] would have hands to do make his lips
[2:02:46] speak what God lips would speak because
[2:02:48] they are not his they're gods he began
[2:02:51] to build a character and begin to take
[2:02:53] his weakness and to make his own self go
[2:02:56] outside as weak and humble
[2:02:57] that's what opportunity that's what we
[2:03:00] have gettin to us is when we are weak
[2:03:03] said it again preacher that's God's
[2:03:06] opportunity that is God's way of gettin
[2:03:09] to us when we are weak see elegant
[2:03:12] preacher that's cause opportunity that's
[2:03:15] course we have gets into us when we
[2:03:17] week we get something then the problem
[2:03:21] is we are too strong so Court have to do
[2:03:23] something to break you come on and
[2:03:26] weaken you that he could get to you Oh
[2:03:28] glory to God praise God this encourages
[2:03:33] of course cause God whole kingdom is
[2:03:36] built out of these kind of people then
[2:03:39] when you get that kind of way your image
[2:03:42] Kingdom the case is roughly not too weak

[2:07:16] the same don't fuss Kempe breeds temper
[2:07:20] the first thing you know you grieve the
[2:07:22] Holy Spirit from you you'd be fussing
[2:07:24] back then the Holy Spirit takes is
[2:07:26] flight
[2:07:26] and we could operate in a home and he's
[2:07:29] not a Christian home in a Christian
[2:07:31] environment because whose brain is not
[2:07:33] ready dear
[2:07:33] because fussing is carrying on and
[2:07:35] whatnot we not look into the Lord your

[2:07:47] fussing you will not fuss why you're
[2:07:50] looking to encourage the Spirit of God
[2:07:51] because a home can run without the Holy
[2:07:54] Ghost and I understand this people can
[2:07:57] live their life without God you know and
[2:07:59] be prosperous I have a good home and
[2:08:02] good marriage and whatnot they're just
[2:08:06] normal human being

[2:08:12] called to be of God and the devil knows
[2:08:16] that this is a light over you and trying
[2:08:19] to out that so that's why he's in your
[2:08:21] marriage in your pocket whatever your
[2:08:23] life that's why there's so much are

[2:08:42] much Jesus he end up his own son he will
[2:08:45] do the same if you stand here we go
[2:08:47] after you receive the Holy Ghost and
[2:08:50] make yourself a Christian
[2:08:54] it does not appeal that we hang out
[2:08:56] after service they take two pill and
[2:08:58] that makes you a Christian a gospel and
[2:09:02] take that and make your Christian you
[2:09:05] grow into Christ you become a Christian
[2:09:08] you make yourself a Christian you
[2:09:13] respect your husband because the word
[2:09:14] said that you humble yourself in the
[2:09:17] home because the word said that you
[2:09:19] respect your parents because the world
[2:09:20] said that you love your wife because the
[2:09:23] word teaches that hallelujah praise God
[2:09:27] is that right
[2:09:28] you choose to obey the word and that is
[2:09:32] what makes you a Christian by your
[2:09:34] choice and by your action and by your
[2:09:36] life and God recognizes that because
[2:09:39] thou has chosen you have walked in your
[2:09:41] own chosen you have picked the precise
[2:09:43] and correct decision it is my way you
[2:09:46] choose the road that you're walking on
[2:09:48] it's the harder way but it's God's me
[2:09:50] cover the bless you because you were
[2:09:53] choose the heart away look at the Elijah
[2:10:00] and Elijah I like the last one he said
[2:10:03] the Lord sent me to Jordan stay here
[2:10:06] there's the last chance the last chance
[2:10:10] to stay where you are stay put toward of
[2:10:15] the follow me all the way and that man
[2:10:17] said no way I'm going all the way
[2:10:21] hallelujah I wonder if we have people
[2:10:24] here like that this morning want to go
[2:10:26] all the way how can the church the
[2:10:30] Pentecostal church the Methodist Baptist
[2:10:32] Church we adopted until they come to
[2:10:34] discipline we've got to be disciplined
[2:10:37] first God could not trust this power
[2:10:42] with the church
[2:10:47] I didn't expect any mix of aiming for
[2:10:49] that how could quad release power and
[2:10:52] there's no discipline these bunch of
[2:10:55] jokers it has how Krakow just let power
[2:10:58] upon them they do have power and look at
[2:11:00] the behavior think about it now look at
[2:11:06] the behavior of churches pastors and
[2:11:08] whatever it is with all power it's so
[2:11:11] off the beaten path much as if God Papa
[2:11:14] Wanda that's why she will be adopted
[2:11:18] because few will come at the discipline
[2:11:21] she would come into character Oh hallelu
[2:11:25] because that's what God wants to use
[2:11:27] character how could a father trusses
[2:11:29] bhisma the boy that might pollute his
[2:11:32] whole inheritance so that's why the
[2:11:34] ballet said bro he's a son he is not

[2:11:51] something in the in the document Satan
[2:11:53] when you reach this age he will get all
[2:11:55] of this that's what God does when he
[2:11:59] reached his stature you get all of this
[2:12:01] it's poking with power with this in
[2:12:04] power Holy Ghost power jointed power
[2:12:07] manifestations the power both glory to
[2:12:10] God so we could reach every blue in the
[2:12:12] face we still have to get character
