ability from inside of you it's inside of you this morning oh praise god [Music] praise the lord amen so you ready for the word this morning oh hallelujah so we want to stand we want to turn our bibles to first corinthians chapter 13 and first peter chapter 2 for scripture reading certainly blessed last week to be here ministry of reconciliation first corinthians chapter 13 i want to read that old chapter and then we just read the first verse of 14. do i speak with the tongues of men and angels and of that charity i am become a song in brass or tinkling symbol do i have the gift of prophecy understand all mysteries and all knowledge do i have all faith so i can remove mountains and have my charity i am nothing and do i bestow my goods to feed the poor though i give my body to be burned of the charity it profited me nothing charity suffered long and is kind charity voted in charity envy at not charity wanted not itself is not puffed up dot not behave itself unseemly seek it not our own is not easily provoked tinker no evil rejoice it not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth bear at all things believe in all things hope at all things endure it all things charity never feel it whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall finish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child speak like a child understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things and now we see true glass darkly and then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known now abided faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity let's continue follow after charity and let's go to first peter chapter 2 i want to read from verse 4. to homecoming also as a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious ye also here's the description as lively stones not dead ones i built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold elaine zane achieve cornerstone elect precious he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them would be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made head of the corner stone of stumbling rock of offense even to them which stumbled at the word being disobedient where unto they were appointed but yeah chosen generation the royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy daily beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul let's pray once more father we love you and we thank you for your word feed us lord with your the bread of life break the bread of life unto us this morning lord may the people be strengthening the inner man may the love of god vibrate through this building here take all the evil out lord take all the unbelief out father i may a revival fire break into every soul here in jesus name i ask and if they are sicken or misheal them if they are bonding on its freedom if their backsliders and omits restore them if they are sinners and omits save them in jesus we ask it amen and amen as you stake your seed give the lord some praises [Applause] our title follow after charity i amen an inspiration charity never feel it follow after charity and that word and amplified is to eagerly pursue and seek to acquire this love make it your aim or your great quest pursue it go after it press towards it make that effort so just to connect back to last week's service we read the scripture from 1st peter 4 8 and above all things have fulfilled charity among yourselves for charity shall cover a multitude of sins colossians 3 above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and where we got that inspiration from uh it was god by second corinthians 5 it was god personally present in christ reconciling and restoring the world to fever with himself not counting up and holding against men their trespasses but canceling them and committing to us the message of reconciliation or restoration to fever so what purpose this morning is that each one of you will be restored into favor with god that's why we are here we are here to be restored in the favor with god when man fell we fell out of favor with god and god put angels to guard the tree in the garden of eden that man in that fallen condition wouldn't partake of that tree of life isn't that right but when jesus came he bring the bring the connection it come like your phone get cut and what jesus came he come to restore the phone line that you're gonna have access to your father so when he died he paid a price to reconnect you into heavenly places to reconnect you into your sonship into a godship to reconnect you with your inheritance because adam lost it adam forfeited it and god wants to reconnect his people because it belongs to you the devil can't own it his hand is too greasy and filthy to own this inheritance it belongs to our the sons of god so we have to come to a place to recognize what is our redemptive rights because the devil can't interfere with it and you can't partake of it if you don't know it's yours that is given for you and you have a right to it glory to god how many understand that now oh glory to god to the devil he is only jealous because he cannot possess what it belongs to you he cannot ever inherited it because the book that adam had he went back in the hands of the original owner satan was written to catch the book because he saw the book slipping under adam's hand that was the objective to take away the book of redemption but it was healed the mystery of it was sealed so when the devil looking to get the deed to take over the earth it went back in the hands of the original owner waiting for the cry to come out who is ready to take the book and to lose the seventh season oh glory god and john was weeping because there was no man worthy a man had to come forth a kinsmen had to comfort and here come that bloody bleeding lamb of god here come that bloody bleeding lamb of god even jesus oh he died to take the book or we are free this morning well hallelujah hallelujah here am i to worship where am i to bow down i'm the four bc amen and the 24 hours they begin to worship and thousands tank thousands oh that's what we're here to do [Applause] [Music] oh hallelujah so every service you suppose you're more excited [Applause] maybe seated every service you should be more used to be more thrilled to know that we are closer than the day before oh hallelujah you've been restored back to favor so god take you to plant you by the rivers of water where your leaves will not rhythm and whatsoever you do want to prosper when the ungodly is not so blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly stand in the way of sinners or set in the seat of the scornful but as the light is in the law of god and in that lord that he meditate day and night he shall be he shall be he you can't stop that man give me a housewife give me a preacher give me anybody that gonna put god first i will show you a man that is successful despite all what the devil put in front of here oh we have something to shout about oh we have something to praise god about [Applause] [Music] you maybe see that if you don't want a shout out shout for you but this message is too real for me to sit dead i will shout for you and me too but i ain't gonna let no rocks all praise me jesus said if they don't shout if they don't worship the rock's gonna cry out i don't care if your roof blows last night you're supposed to give god worship and tell the devil he's a liar you're getting another roof oh give the lord some praises [Music] hallelujah let's rock the boat yes yes let's rock the boat [Applause] hallelujah i don't want you to be predictable i want you to be unpredictable because the devil predicted you long time because you're born in sin shape iniquity i'd condemn you you do this something a wrong they never understand that he long time in his business he has nothing new to discover he has nothing new to unfold his only god have stuff that the devil know nothing about that's why he put silence under the seventh seal to confuse the devil he don't know what happening there you don't even know what happened right now he don't even know you're being loosed you're being set free you don't even know the holy ghost has been disguised as the word and you have received it in the word form you don't even know that the transforming power the power of love is here oh glory to god [Applause] devil don't know that [Applause] brother branham came to introduce us the messiah that introduced us to be messaged people [Music] you're supposed to have a personal relationship with christ you love the virgin lovely president that's fine but you have to know christ and christ is the word [Applause] [Music] so i'm building my greenhouse beautiful house with stones cut from all around the world in the individual country owned in the individual country that when solomon got the stones he just had to fit it here fitted there it's already cut already honed already shaped already formed not even my hammer not even my soul was heard he's just laying it there cleaning it there behold i lay in zion for a foundation stone stones and you are a lively stone that god is about to cut that poison out of shape that god is about to hone we also have lively stones you got to know who you are [Applause] i like that i like that normally see a stone on the ground there's a that's so not dead stone he's saying you are one of that but a lively one that make it and raise your hands that make us shout that means you're not dumb dog in israel praise god you could open your mouth and give god praises that means heaven could look down this morning and said there's a bunch of people in sandy grande that you don't care they don't care who in front of them they don't care who behind them they don't care what excited them that okay what happened yesterday they ain't care about nothing tomorrow it's like no see it is it looked like they owned the expectations for anything it looked like anything could happen i can see devils begin to leave already some already going down the steps so i'm heading out to the door they say not this morning not this sunday oh glory to god not the sunday not here what is coming the capstone the headstone the stone the bill is refused that's the love of god but it will come follow after charity [Applause] what did paul teach us you wanna be seated do i get my body to be burned don't put my name on a big building and say i give everybody this and everybody that all right zero nada living that tough what about knowing i haven't known all mysteries they have plenty knowledgeable mysterious preachers you know they could bring mystery after mystery of the mission but doing all of that let me check your charity god bring a thermometer it's a charity to monitor oh hallelujah when you dip it soul recognize charity hidden at all because charities suffer at long in his care charity voted up itself charities that puffed up not easily provoked it can't get no evil and rejoicing not iniquity but rejoices in the truth come on now come on now my god i'm going to dance all by myself i'm going to have a revival all by myself i don't know if you want to dance with me but i'm going to dance like david dance all by myself [Applause] where the shelters at last week i told you you didn't start the show here you were starting the show since before the foundation of the world that's what the devil don't understand he can't take out your shouting shoes you put on your shouting shoes that's why you're here this morning this is the place where god gets worshipped jesus told the woman of the world woman the whole common now is when the true i'm not hearing you the truth the truth going to worship the father in spirit and in truth maybe caesars [Applause] you can't go to that cricket match and a man get out who's the opposite manual manage six to win the match and you're about year six i wouldn't want to be sitting next to that person that person's not supposed to be there he's not in the spirit of what's going on football match going on goal score i want there's a goal 84 minutes past 0-0 six more minutes to finish the match and somebody on your tie caught a goal and what there's a goal you shouldn't be in that place at all you're not in the spirit of the match you're not in the spirit of the game you're not in the spirit of the environment and if you're not on fire this morning you should be home come on same as somebody oh this we know what we worship we know why we worship we know who we were [Applause] like tuesday this night i just break into something with our father prayer we just had the prayer meeting and i was exhorting them i said the first thing when they they said jesus teaches the prayer the first thing jesus said is our father what in heaven he told nothing earth yet he tell him straight up in heaven he'll make one request yet hallowed be thy name no request yet you're still worshipping [Applause] thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as in heaven you're still here sitting here you're selling god his will will be done when you're finished with that you say give us this day [Applause] our daily bread after you're caught up in heaven after getting the spirit like john was in the spirit and i was caught up in the spirit and suddenly a door open [Applause] [Music] forgive us yes forgive us jesus teaching them forgive us of our sins amen as we forgive those that trespass against us he didn't pray forgive me my sins forget my neighbor yes they on their own no no he didn't say that he said forgive us of our sins as we say if you do not forgive neither will god forgive you of your trespasses but this morning you want to cancel it come on now we want to reconcile you back to god you see maybe season with brotherly kindness you can fail your family gonna fail you your husband's gonna fail you your wife's gonna fail you you're cheering gonna fail you the job gonna fail you your money gonna fail you the doctors may fail you but charity never failed follow after charity be walking into something that cannot feel that cannot be defeated it will push back the bull it will calm the bees it will roll back the storm it will stop the doctor's knife before that ah glory to god that's what we're talking about that's what we are walking into follow after charity they're going to arrest the maniac man oh give the lord some praises do i hear praises in the house this morning you may be seated you see god sent a prophet to reveal the written word this book is what was sealed he didn't come to dismiss this book and push this book aside and say the prophecy and the prophet says no no man can add or take away from this book it's original it is god in print form this is the second bible three bible the first was the zodiac the second was the pyramid this is the third ever could be i wouldn't be psychologists say it would be a fought you'll be a living bible but this is god in print so whatever we hear as message has to be able to take us back to that i feel great this morning scripture first john 1 verse 5 this then is the message that we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all [Music] if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie knew not the truth now this is not for prostitutes and drunkards and drinkers and smokers and partygoers this is church people you're talking to so let's get that right now this is for us now if we walk in the light as he's in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin [Applause] so once we walking in the light and my brethren over there walking in the light and my bridging dong dear walking light vibration of deer walking on the right it has to have fellowship one with another because we walking in the light the only reason that the camera fellowship light going out [Applause] somebody flipped the switch but the blood the blood i feel like an old fashion my god i feel like my god oh this is a reason [Applause] well i want to tell you something there's a man here [Applause] there's a man here that can turn on the lights my god my god i'm having myself a revival glory lord god oh give the lord some praises the holy ghost is here we say it if we see we have no sin we deceive ourselves [Applause] that's a different kind of selfie that's a self-deceiving picture and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us so don't come with that don't try that don't play a squeaky clean don't try that i caught you this morning the blood of jesus oh dear the lord i don't know are there shelters in the house [Music] [Applause] right now they're so far from where it's supposed to be this is coming up like a mystery right now [Music] the people so far off the path of god that what i'm preaching here from the scriptures with this anointing upon it is like a hidden mystery you may be seated first john 2 paul john speaks brethren i write no new commandment unto you then i know new thing he said but an old commandment which you had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning again a new commandment i write unto you he said you he said all he say but i'm bringing it new it's coming fresh it come in fresh it is freshly anointed it is freshly inspired it is baked from heaven this morning you could smell the heat of this bread oh come on now say it man somebody it's eaten nice [Applause] as but i was saying grenada it eaten nice oh glory watch i write unto you which watch again a new commandment i write unto you which things is true in him and in you because the darkness is passed the true light now shine it verse nine he that say it here we go he's in the light and hated his brother is in darkness even until now [Applause] they can have all the books listen to every tape at night be in darkness they can go to church and have the best time matching their socks and their shoes they're in darkness they could be smiling in the morning god bless you but they have hate they're in darkness who said so god [Applause] he that lovett his brother abideth in the light amen and there is none occasion of stumbling in him but he that is hated his brother is in darkness and walk it in darkness and know it not whether he grew it because the darkness had blinded his eyes so they don't even know where they're going amen because the darkness blind their eyes so sometimes they take they switch themselves and switch themselves off nobody knows the light for them at all because of the hate because of what on the inside they switch off because see devil know we are sons and and he know if we break laws there are penalties that goes with it the worst one is when you trap yourself when you end up in your prison and you have the key then nobody could unlock you really because you have the key you you you put the gate and you turn it up and you put the key in your pocket and while in prison i'm in prison i'm in prison i can't forgive her in prison our vex are in prison i hate i'm pretty your prison do you want to come out [Applause] because he said when you stand praying for charity forgive if if if if you have ought against any drop it drop it like a hot potato ouch drop it drop it just drop it say that them thinking like hot potato just drop it just don't you want to take just drop it what your wife did what your husband did what your children did what this one do what the neighbor what the ball just drop it drop it and hurt yourself bad that's your human spirit drop it drop it don't even talk about it drop it [Applause] if a man love the world and love the father is not in him for all that is in the world and he listed here the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the father it's of the world and the world passes away in the lust thereof but he that do it the will of god amen abide it forever amen first chantry verse one behold yes what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us now if you could see that why you want to be terrorizing somebody you isis you you want to be a terrorist why why do you figure you terrorize somebody when you understand what manner of love that god listen i'm feeling so afraid i could fly right now if i had wings [Applause] i might have fly feeling free it's like the son of man set me [Applause] [Music] behold what man of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knew it not us because it knew him not beloved nor we the sons of god verse 14 we know that we have passed some death into life because we love the brethren [Music] we're not talking about brethren who bring a cake for him we're not talking about bridgette who treats you nice and and help you here you get a flat tire and the bedroom for everybody's the tire nobody not talk about that you know the bridge is the bedroom good bad ugly indifferent hateful miserable because not all israelis is real but that doesn't stop your love come on same as somebody hallelujah this is getting it real [Music] we know you see you see all these scriptures yeah you know preachers ain't gonna touch it because it's not a deep enough one one person tell me they find that i i don't preach deep enough i say okay and he's praying for me to get deeper but do i know all mysteries do i have all knowledge do i get deeper deeper deeper if i go get deep in the love of god i am messed up [Music] so if this morning we could break into this thing that can't fail where is sickness going to remain in this building [Applause] right now cancer will be trembling tumor trembling diabetes trembling high blood pressure trembling crippled trembling back pressure trembling back ache back pain at written condition trembling eye problem trembling praise god glucoma trembling everything trimming because charity cannot fail when charity come and sickness see charity sickness after backup shot because that love is greater than more powerful than it's the greatest weapon for god so loved the world my god satan had the world so wrapped up but god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son what was it it was the love of god that released the grace of god and that is why we are here this morning could somebody give god a shout in the house so we know we are passing that on their life because we love the brethren he does love it not his brother abides in debt still going to church no don't think i'm angry with you i just read in the scriptures don't bother to rush me and try to say hey preachers say this no no no no no no no whosoever hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer had eternal life [Applause] hereby perceive me the love of god because this is a big one because he laid on his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren amen oh that is a huge one they call it big one amen see please get quiet hallelujah i think i'll read it again because that's so big you have to take it in deuces i don't repeat this one because there was one fly over your head hereby perceive me the love of god because he had laid on his life for us we ought to lean on our lives for the brethren but whosoever had this world good and see his brother have need and shuttered up his bowels of compassion from him how dwell at the love of god in him amen is getting light bro i say long time some people don't like to ask how you're going to know because they're afraid you say you're going bad and they could do it a raise you could do with a sandwich and they don't want to put out anything from their pocket so that's a question to ask at all all right all right open your mouth and ask them how are you going and if you have a five dollars you know one dollar here and they're not going so good take the five and give them it and see god add to the one dollar in this pocket here that's a challenge i know but i know people live that out and you never know how much they have but always given always cheerful always helpful always blessing is something that they choose to do oh hallelujah praise god amen all right my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but deed and truth and hereby we know we are in truth and shall be assured in our hearts okay question four almost almost done this part after this part i got this morning right there in the office to bring this part to you [Music] beloved let us love one another amen for love is of god and everyone that love it is born of god and know it god he that love it not know it not god for god is love in this was manifested the love of god towards us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him hearing his love not that we love god but that he loved us sent his son to be a propagation for our sins beloved if god so love us we ought also to love one another no man had seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he had given us of his spirit was 16 and we not have known and believed the love that god had to us god is love he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him this is the last scripture i have here hearing is our love made perfect amen that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casted out fear because fear had torment he that fear it is not made perfect in love what is he saying as you walk towards love you get less fear follow after charity as you walk in love the fear of men be fear of failure the fear of falling the fear of mistakes all of that begun to dissolve because you're walking in the love of god nothing could hurt you or harm you because you're in the will of god he doesn't fear it it's not made perfect in love we love him because the first love of ever man say i love god and hated his brother he's a liar for he had he had that love it not his brother whom he had seen how can you love god whom you are not seeing amen and this commandment has read from him that he will love god love his brother also oh praise god do you love the lord this morning praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah for a message called love but abraham i say this tonight as a minister of the gospel i've tried i have had the privilege of preaching around the world before tens of thousands of people and every divine promise in the bible is true and if you take the right mental attitude towards any of god's divine promises it will bring it to pass if you can take the right attitude our scripture tonight is god so loved the world and if there's anything that the world is dying for today is love in my travels i find that it's the rejected stone that keeps the building from being fit together where the assemblies in the church of god the baptist methodists will shake hands and be brothers if they just had love one for another that is the great need the world is dying for and god is love when you find the church that what's hindered the church has been a wrong conception of love now love there are two different types of love that's real love one of them is a greek word called agapo that's god's love and there's a perverted love called filio love which is human love failure comes from the word fellowship the fill your love is what you have for your wife a man might flirt with her or insult her you will shoot his brains out over her that's what failure love will do it accompanies jealousy and many other things goes with it but agape love will make you pray for his sinful soul that's the difference between the two loves god's love is the beginning of love it's a fountain of love and the church today is lacking in that that real agape love that makes you have love for your enemy and if we only have that kind of a love there'll be a revival sweet this nation from coast to coast from north to south and the reason that we do not have that love the main reason the church is not progressing like it should we don't need theology we need real love to go with theology we already know we don't need another doctrine we don't need another mystery we had them for 40 plus years what we need is the spirit love dynamics the holy ghost charity love divine to come upon what you already know hallelujah we only need love real love to go with the theology we already know we all argue so much whether we should be baptized forward backwards whatever more but that don't make any difference how you're baptized or what church you belong to or what evidence that you have that you're a christian if you haven't got love you haven't got god we need love god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son now when love is projected and come to its end sovereign grace produced to project without love projected o praise the name of the lord what a bran of our mind new ministry justin neville brother brown as soon as i returned from california the lord willing what the branham tabernacle needs is a revival they need a revival and a filling of the holy ghost and that's the great need of the tabernacle some of the finest people in the world comes here but what we need is the baptism of the holy ghost i feel it i can tell it and as soon as we return back if the lord willing we're going to have a revival for that very purpose that's the members of this tabernacle and other people who are seeking the holy ghost might come in and give instructions and everything half prayer meetings in here to receive the holy ghost and that the church might get back into the will of god and move on with the program of god as it moves on amen oh hallelujah so bahrain himself saw the need for the holy ghost in his church isn't that right so he said what god calls foolish what man is called foolish god called great so that we have got to do is to get back into the program of god are you in god's program or are you coming to church you have to know the program of god and you know you're in the program of god they're not devil control you're off beat no devil control you're off balance because you're in god's program it's god's program for you you're here this morning because he said don't forsake the assembling of yourself together as the man of psalm is the cast still man listen to the books and just play tape that's the purpose to get be in the church there's a purpose to be in fellowship there is unction and words coming from god that you need to hear and need to know but more than that is a ruinous environment you could get to access broadly kindness only in a group scenario can somebody mash your corn mash your toes affect your life or straight your life and only in this circumstance you can get the opportunity to forgive and repent and say forgive me say i'm sorry say i'm wrong bless god to be in a group that feels the spirit of god can somebody upset you you're in the right place [Applause] somebody hurt you is the right place you're feeling bad about this when you're in the right place what you're gonna do about it christian man christian woman what you're gonna do about it oh hallelujah this we're gonna live it's going to thunder the tower gonna be stunned because it looked like the honeymoon stick but the honey will stick oh give the lord a shout [Applause] now watch all this forgiveness forgiveness most of the time is just talk just words just more going there is something i call the spirit of forgiveness until i get to that spirit it's a forgiveness yet when you're getting the spirit of forgiveness it's really forgiving it's really released it's really it's come true because you're in the spirit of it hallelujah now you're to need the spirit of forgiveness in order to approach charity no we get into something because he said we have to come to this ministry what ministry the ministry of jesus christ we have to come to the king you can't just walk up to the king you have to have on the right dress [Applause] that's the thing with esther esther was getting instructions of hold the dress you couldn't just go in like that but because of the press we have to go let's just say if i perish i perish [Applause] but i'm going in the presence of the king who is the king the capstone charity [Applause] so we've got to get back into the program of god and finally here we go what god wants us to do and the only way i know to do it is prayer [Applause] could you say it again sure sure we have got to do we have got to get back into the program of god and find out after all what god wants us to do and the only way i know to do is prayer prayer is the key that's the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of a human being [Applause] so when you ball your head and open your mouth it's a weapon of warfare one time jesus before last week he said lord god i know that thou always hearst me but for dear sakes he was living real more together that power of that prayer that's why you should keep on praying because your prayer could ricochet in heaven angels dispatch based upon your prayer i've heard the cries of my people and i've come down today you could just walk or heal totally completely right now completely [Applause] put around him have a prayer line and there was an indian lady from apache in india she had crutches and so on and she came up on a platform with her crutches and when she got up there she just handed him the crutches and walked back home he didn't have to pray for her her faith was so anointed her faith was so anointed another woman she was in a wheelchair she got a preclude and she put that prayer card on her legs and said satan come out of there in the name of jesus the people spirit and she come with a wheelchair why don't you get out your wheelchair this [Applause] how many want to go free free free this morning [Music] that's what i'm here for to set you free by the power of the word and preaching the cast of devils or for your life that you can worship and give god praise and once your devil started moving for you up goes your hands lip is going to praise god you're going to begin to worship god want to drop a robe over you but i want to drop an anointing upon you you feel his presence you know he is here this morning [Applause] all right okay let's get down in the honey jar from the contest for the brown praying 1962 31st of december he got the vision of the seven angels he wrote something about the break that

laity all the visitors be there with us lord we are your servants we give ourselves holy to you for 1963. you're coming that in other words the power of your spirit might have more preeminences in our life in our being help us god forgive us and help us hear how the prophet i can't pray for no forgiveness help us we pray listen raise up mighty men amen not sit down my demons up mighty men not even mighty mentally tips raise up mighty warriors of the faith [Music] open this year which is 63 coming lord that hidden manner that rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of god cap off the pyramids of our lives amen that year 1962 he preached such a perfect man faith and virtual knowledge so he understood all of that so he is praying looking for the cap not on the people there because they they they wasn't there in that he knew what he was looking for cap off the pyramid of our lives lord put the capstone christ jesus upon each and every one of us may his great magnificent holy blessing be upon us all may the fire of the holy ghost come upon us may the power here we go of the resurrection be manifested amen lord we thank you we are yours we give ourselves fully to you what a prayer rock beneath the rock open up that we might see the program of god then put on the capstone cap the perimeter of our lives what are you saying someday you're gonna wake up to understand a pyramid was being built in you come on now ride with me write me don't don't don't don't slow down now one day gonna wake up and recognize a pyramid was being built in you and you're gonna have to ask god to cap the pyramid [Applause] of your life hallelujah because the cap is promised isn't that right this great servant moses message but moses had no fellowship not one thing in that 40 years was spoke that god did for him or any way any supernatural he was out of fellowship or when a church gets out of fellowship with god miracles cease signs of wonder cease revival cease just moves right out when you when you get out of the fellowship oh so you said the bride hasn't had a revival as yet it will take them seven thunders that means sometimes have to bring back the blood amen because the blood is not going to bring fellowship and fellowship we're going to bring okay now the thing to do is keep is keep that's what i'm trying to say a while the love of god in your heart keep fellowshipping with him and he will add these other things just as we mature that's very important hallelujah but i'm talking about somebody got their baptism shall i ask god for gifts he said become a stuffed shirt because that's what people do they get the blessing they get puffed up so he said no don't do that let the lord lead you and different things like that so watch i'll keep fellowship with him and he will add these things other things just as we mature don't you think so so moses was out of fellowship no fellowship dear what no fellowship out there in a strange country among strangers not his own people she was his the people there was ethiopians and he was a jew completely out of the reach of god seemingly are you ready and god all the time knowing that no matter how much of a mess that god that man makes out of the program of god god is going to straighten it out [Applause] no matter what mess is in this message god will straighten it out moses was 40 years under silence normal living and god waited for his time to reconnect back moses to his commission and purpose nothing could stop it not his backside not just running nothing could stop it and you're back sliding and running that ain't going to stop it this happened that happened that ain't going to stop it the purpose that god put inside for your life that must must must be accomplished because he said my word shall not return unto me boy oh hallelujah glory to god what it shall accomplish oh praise him of the lord [Applause] david says god is my rock you know what a rock is referred to a rock is a revelation like the word the christ david was crying out saying god is my rock my revelation now peter rock confession which we know he would build his church on the rock not peter being a stone as a roman catholic tries to say it but peter's confession of the revelation that's the church god will reveal it not a confession of this man because later he backslid not in not a confession of him being the son of god because they knew he was the son of god peter just said it but it what it was it was the revelation that had been revealed from heaven that he was the son of god so it wasn't the words that was the son of god no it was the fact that peter heard from him that he was the son of god that was divine revelation coming to peter and you have the ability come on i want to give a shout on that you have the ability to hear from god don't let the devil tell you otherwise don't let the devil tell you backstage you cannot hear from god don't let the devil tell you you sin you cannot hear from god the bride has the ability to hear direct from god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] blah blah blah i'm talking about rock confession you cannot make a holy church there's no such thing as a holy church a holy organization the holy spirit can be preached in it but in there you'll find good bad renegade indifferent and everything else so organization cannot hold it you cannot say we got it none of the rest of them has it no sir the holy spirit is poured out on individuals that should nail that thing down the holy ghost is not poured inside your church it called upon individuals individuals are gonna contain the holy ghost and if they're not going to receive the holy ghost if they're going to possess the holy ghost and nobody can stop your blessing so that's why you have a right to shout like never before because your cup is about to run over you know god's so long to pour out it's just because he couldn't find his space all along [Applause] once one's got cmd room hey hey look at this one somebody have trick water room hey portrait what inside of you some people only have one ear just a little thing some people have no room but follow your head and fall off come on give the lord some praises people god want to turn your upside down inside out shake it up turn your right rack back and then pour it inside of you oh glory to god how many believe that god wants your cop to run over how many believe that david said my cup running over that is when it's coming more than enough oh you're not giving me this morning that is when it's coming more than enough more than you need god just jamming it in oh my god preston i'm running over you get this song for your soul you give your son for your spirit and then examine it into your body you're gonna take away your conscience your memory your affection your reasoning you're gonna press it you'll be anointed of god perfect standing perfect statement oh glory to god hallelujah you talk about anointed you have seen nothing yet we told god begin to anoint the sons of god for this hour direct inspiration direct revelation hearing direct from god [Applause] this tabernacle they say this [Music] jesus said so you see he does it he hear he hear he hear he where he said before the kingdom is within you now if the kingdom within you you have to go everywhere when you recognize the kingdom is within you wherever you go the kingdom goes you gotta look here and look there you're free the hebrew say we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved that's why you will be a christian in switzerland you'll be a christian in africa you'll be a christian in america wherever you go it doesn't matter if they put you in a small island with their six other people you'll still be a christian wherever you live wherever you go because a christian is a christian nobody can change that god put a rock in your soul glory to god this church don't make you that god makes you that oh give the lord a shout out [Applause] listen what are we preaching here already tried you know it's trite stuff you know we talking about live voices you know people leave this out already you know the true boys they went in fiery furnace they were still christians they put daniel lions there he was still a christian hallelujah they didn't put samson in prison and samson's still come on christian once more lord [Applause] you don't hear what i'm saying praise god don't try yet don't try that don't think something wasn't a christian he backs it but he was restored oh give the lord a shout and samson had more power than ever before he destroyed more enemy like never before or give the lord a shout in the house maybe seated [Applause] let the devil know you are double trouble praise god when he bang you up on what are you coming back you come back double heavy man you're coming back for total war you're coming back to take back what the devil took from you you have no right to take on my eyes you have no right to take my wife my husband my children if i had no right [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you see you see we coming to church you're getting like a mental revolution because you come from sinner to come to recognize your inheritance who oh you're just lying with his heritage too thinking natural you have nothing you're poor you're struggling what not always send someone some income and say well you know they have a deed what is that something on a paper and my name on it let's say i can't read all right someone come and say you know what you have two acres of land you have a house there on top there and everything up there really you can take them up to see it when you're going up and see it now you see squatters sliming on it i walked out and you timid and you're shy and you have no confidence you can't tell me last year good meal carter elastigirl good shoes you have holes in your shoes and whatnot but but the anger come and see that line is yours and what you're going to tell people this is minds they start to laugh at you hallelujah then you get the instructions out to go to the lawyer attorney named jesus the enforcer to enforce what he died what he'd be dealing with because the final he died to make the defective he died to bring this paper to life [Applause] no watch you may be seated all the time the devil laughing because you're starting to make claims and nothing happening yes this is my i claim it i claim it just keep on claiming it now if you take on here go stop keep on claiming it but no when you go to the lawyer when you go to charity when they go to the enforcer then they never recognize something's had to move now because they're getting back up you're getting support so you're coming back you know you stay there i come back with power i have a promise you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you and you shall be witnesses i come back on the books and tapes i ain't coming to save no people notice i told me to take back what you took from me i'm kicking back my joy i'm taking out my prayer life i think a revival an old-fashioned home brewed revival i want a revival that i don't have to go to church for i want it in my house i want it in the kitchen i want it in the drawing room i want it in the gallery area i wanted in the backyard i was in the front yard i want an old-fashioned home cook revival oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah give the lord a shout in the house this revival is demon chasing this revival as hell raise him demon chase him oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] just as fast as it gets as fast as it's gone there's a fast food revival but good old home cooking revival yes every day you're reviving every day you're adding gas every day you're cleaning the lamp everyday you add in oil give me all in my lump and when the lamb gets suited up you clean it and you get good light every day you're charged up every day you're in the wood every day you're in the spirit you're seeking the lord daily until every one of these virtues is in this statute of mind till i become a manifestation of jesus christ for he took my place lord let me take his place that's the purpose he died for [Applause] hallelujah who you're following now man no you're falling after charity you're seeing how he walks you're seeing how he lives in the watch so watch then this tabernacle the the individuals they are the time that's going to contain the holy ghost i want to get to now the honey represent broadly love brotherly kindness which is the age i just got to telling you bradley can't say he believe in now no you might see i sure don't like brother neville i show the like brother jones i don't like brother shawn so but something like that but let something happen to him your heart is broke it just nearly kills you we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another to maintain it in a group why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him at the altar you fellowship with him you shook his hands you worship at him he's your brother listen he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with because you kind of stay you ought to do it shun a little bit but at the bottom of your heart if something under that brother it will only kill you or that sister i'm an old man i have once young and now i'm old i've seen it through the ages here people say i won't have no more to do with him and something happened that man it nearly kills him oh god i let my precious brother go without making friends with him see it's broadly love there we go it looks like it won't stick but it does stick the honey it sticks real honey it has the fast food honey it's just sticking at all it's just a fast thing a temporary temple day so each age each one of these age had that rock confession and whatever i'm talking about uh the saints sleeping wait and wait and wait and see until this age but soon the holy ghost being poured out from christ will come and seal at the church then the church will be raptured it will be a complete unit of the lord god oh hallelujah could you take some more the other night i made a statement at the pulpit saying this that i would rather see burly love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of divine healing or anything else we must know what these things are for i rather have a church listen just a moment i would rather have a church that knows nothing about spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with christ i'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operated in the church now i know that my son had in a pentecostal group but i would rather have it where there is gifts they would feel where there is gifts there'll be confusion where there is gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it's perfect [Music] that's right so if you are perfect love you are perfect gifts that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts so when people switch off the switch and fall in the darkness there's no fellowship it is evidence there is no love because you don't have to agree with me to fellowship with me we don't have to believe the same thing for you to be a friend with me there are people evil toward each other in church but they're talking to unbeliever in their job they're talking to people they don't know they will go and eat dinner with them they will go on have fellowship with them and that is not a problem but they have a big problem to repent and repent unto somebody at the offending church whether you say hallelujah or not that doesn't bother me i cannot proof that long time ago i i don't that don't but whether you see even or not as long as i'm speaking what i believe god lay upon my heart that's it whether your face hard what do you say don't say that doesn't matter i'll see it still that's just how i am built i guess you know who i am built just have to bring the wood and just slam it in the bridge just eat it all up because she loves her husband her mate the revealed word so once they're hearing the revealed word they say that's mine that's my come on preacher give it to me give it to me don't hold back give it to me i don't want to hear a dream like you had last night no give it the dream you've been like nobody's dream last night all right so now work with love first love brings fellowship fellowship bring gifts you say what the world need today is a filling a filling and when the dumping out comes it needs a filling what does that feeling do when it comes in what does the filling do what it does where you have doubts it brings fate where you have indifference it brings love when you have hatred it brings fellowship so this message need a big dumping in of the holy ghost [Applause] oh hallelujah and when the church of the living god someday will be united under one great head amen that will be the head of god go into the unity of the body of christ will be the governor and the king and the lord over the entire church under his control that head will not be the pope that will be the lord himself could you take any more we have more it's coming watch you talking about the lutheran just lost the light one more the lost coin the pentecostal just lost their light and so on he said but watch i don't care if you're messing she had a hostility in time she scrubbed the floor she swept the walls she took down the cobwebs she kept on until she found what she had lost and when she did she called her little sister changes to come now i don't care if you're a methodist here we go baptist pentecostal presbyterian let us rejoice together when that time come prophecy when the church finds his brotherly love so the prophet knew it would be absent he prophet knew it would be something that was lost but he also knew we would find it when the church finds this broadly love when the church finds his whole relationship when it just finds his place in christ it will call to the members of the body come and rejoice with us god wants the church to love him [Music] people love the pastor but he want the church to love him hallelujah praise god amen no you know a confession a decision is a confession the confession is a stone you say what could it do to pile up a bunch of stones if you haven't got a stone cutter here we go to shape them by a sharp twitched sword of the word in the son and daughters of god so the object of the word coming to us is to shape us not for us to get a blessing on our sunday but for you to be shaped because you are a stone i want to say a living stone a lively stone but you have to be cut to be fitted in some people like themselves they don't want to change because they are satisfied with themselves but when you get trouble in your spirit that you are not all right amen you need something more then you can say lord chip me hold me cut me amen hallelujah oh praise god so watch let them run around here with all kind of women dressed like skinned women and columns of christian men letting them do it and call themselves servants of christ and the church in a lukewarm condition we need stones here we go cut into son and daughters of god that's why the prophet when he left he left a ministry on the earth to continue bringing the word say what the tapes say that we could be cut to be shaped another time he said make himself a christian you know that instant christian is under a tablet a puppet inside you and become a christian you're baptized and become a christian no you make yourself a christian you overcome you pray you press you turn your head from the woman out there yes yes you overcome your jealousy and envy you die out to yourself make yourself a christian he said i want to be a christian you're going to be a christian speak and express it walk in it [Applause] glory to god hallelujah and we say some time ago action is caused inertia just happens but action is caused you have to do something for something to happen if you're drifting in life and yet keep drifting don't be like that driftwood just drift wherever the current take is you take it but be a wood that is cut and healed attach your engine to it like a boat and they could guide you somewhere but at driftwood wherever the current going you go into the car and go inside going so you're going so wherever the car and going he going he's a driftwood a log and somebody can take that same log and cut it out making it a boat but the engine put a power on it and it could be guided here guided there guided there not drifting it's being directed hallelujah the same wood let's put it this way two trees fell and one fallen to the sea and he wanted to go he said i go in he wrote broad it's wide are you one false i want him in the ground i want you to cut me and honestly say i don't want to be cut at all leave me so i like myself like i'm going and that treat is going on that way and afterwards what happened hit the cataracts it hit the fall it crashes that people lies you have cousins and family and whatnot they take their choice and they leave of christ and they have good businesses and good money and good everything else oh in the sea at the end they recognize it wasn't worth it at all the only thing that counts is what comes to the kingdom of god hallelujah all the styles all the fashion all the shoes [Music] all what you want and you get it oh you understand do you have christmas we need stones cut in the sons and those of god what good does it do to roll up the stones if you're not going to have them cut they got to be cut to fit into the program of god by gifts and calling oh glory to god amen so through your rock revelation you have to have forgiveness to your faith you have to get forgiveness on top of that god help us in this place my god i want you to exercise yourself in it glory to god amen you know we are grandparents we the children stay by us and so on and when they learn to turn over and the guy discover he could turn over from his belly to his back like first time was like a shock afterwards but you don't know what happening after all you recognize easy way to go nature say turn over and they turn over you know what i recognize now they practice they practice it until they get it perfect another one is time to sit up and you do all kind of and think somewhat and then he sit up whoa i mean he said who put him in his house nobody you know he's up first time he's up and afterwards he's doing that he's doing it again why is nature calling he's not an animal he's a he's a human being they're going to accept they're going to stand they're going to walk you another animal you're a son of god you're going to sit you're going to stand you're going to walk you're going to talk they're going to speak they're going to create they're going to manifest you're going to get vindicated you'll be adopted come on give the lord a shout you know but you have to begin to exercise you have to begin to get some practice you have to begin to walk in love you have to begin to forgive look for people to forgive them [Applause] oh god lord they said to you but be crazy this morning the pastor going crazy look look for the opportunity to repent when you're doing the exercising well let's just turn somebody forgive me forgive you when i say that that comes in your mouth somebody's so proud right you know these things you know what it is in the past you know that's not it you you say

long time until you come out your mouth i am so sorry that that i make you feel hurt and bad and we talk about the man he loves his wife the other quarrel or whatever it is in the morning from the neighbors gets his wife for the goodbye and you're walking on the road but it's not right that is traditionally elders that's intellectual that's mechanic then he turned around and come and give his wife a proper kiss then he got in the spirit anything then that was the real one the first one bogus the first one was an impostor the first one was bogus the second one was the real one but let's get real people come on let the forgiveness get real [Applause] not only you forgiving others you know but you accept and god has forgiven you because some of you walk around condemning your own self and god has nothing to do with that because jesus dropped the charges dismiss your case me see if i can enter evangelism but ram says watch confession is a stone now what peter good stone now watch you're piling up a bunch of rocks is that right it isn't doing a bit of good the water wear it away the stone so all these books and tapes and the message sweeping over the stones it's not doing good only getting smooth stones the stone's getting wary here what he says but you got watch you haven't got a true stone mason with a good sharp tool to shape you into fitting place in the house of god that is what is needed real stone mesa packs packs go and move packs be getting through packs or give the lord a salt in the house stone mix with a hammer and a chisel because you are a lively stone that you could call you the darkness to show forth his praises that is why you should be praising god continually [Applause] that is end time evangelism taking stones and shaping them if the stone mason isn't there they will shape them and make them quit this and that and cut them and make them miss wait praise god all right it's not right wife obey your husband that's the word some woman taking them off spiritually and they looked like they tried to lead your mind by their ears or something like that where your ass where are you getting that from and because of some kind of thing and you're feeling so super spiritual and a man feeling like i don't know what husband love your wife that's the word you love your wife and love is nothing just talk and say you know i love you and she says no but i will get stumped you know i love you she said no i don't know that i am feeling it i'm gonna divide summit and get the spirit of it amen [Music] i'll say a better than ability to ring it because suppose you bring another side you're looking like a bell when you do so nothing a song another song they sing it could be a poetry to be a poem love wasn't given to stay love is not love till you give it away love has to be given come on now [Applause] you can't keep love wait [Music] give it show it give god that love from in your soul that's what i love about david he was a king he was a warrior but that man loved god he fancy dancing wife she she couldn't handle him when he saw the act coming on the road david had to dance dance dance dance dance when he come home that way the wife embarrassed she said king king kingdom supposed to dance like that them steps they're moving they're supposed to move the front let somebody else dance to you he said woman come back tomorrow he said i'll now start hallelujah you can't come and tell me i'm a son of god you're trying to cramp my spirit i rest my anointing change but you can't come and do that when the act coming down the world come back in the position the joy of the lord coming back in the house of god the joy of the lord is my strength you tell me i can't dance you've got to be crazy no longer under stress i like it was a bit of backbone i was like i getting released praise god hallelujah i'm getting a way to express myself this is the place to express your love for god and the true spirit of worship thanksgiving unto god

of god has been restored more than that the kept to that pyramid finally is coming capping stone what's that the love of god what's that charity not never fail oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory so he called the elect lutherans to make the wesleyans he called the elect pentecostal to make what to make the headstone to come into it the very same kind of ministry he call in the elect pentecostal to make up the headstone the bride you what what to call you all because you know we have a pyramid here but between brotherly kindness and lovee is a that's that's the bright age that's the holy spirit slot that's where the rainbow is at he called you out of loudly to fit you inside of there a fitted stone and i didn't complete last week but we have to be fitly joined together there's not one man making up that so i can't do without you because you are part of this thing here to make up that body that the spirit could come on understand this when the bride is taken off the earth but abram said the spirit leaves the earth the bride will be the container of the spirit of god when the bride is taken up the spirit leaves and there will be judgment fires upon the faith of the earth nothing to hold back the wrath of man and god oh hallelujah what ram said they will do whatever they want to do because there's no spirit here to hold them back when the spirit is dead god could stop this and the spirit couldn't imprison somebody away from this but when it's pretty removed it's forget it hallelujah devil take behind most oh han i don't want to be here for that i am preparing to get out of here oh glory to god who will go with me but i'm getting out of here i'm preaching to get over here i'm on my way out of here oh glory to god amen so he's calling out the elect pentecostal to make the headstone to come into it so he was making the cap as it was to cap the pyramid isn't that right no this is what code is a powerful code he was the rejected stone and here we go those stones are you ready everybody awake anybody sleeping with raise your hands nobody raise your hands that's good nobody is sleeping i can't force you to sleep on this one this one's too important and then those stones here we go that fit around the headstone [Music] will have to be so completely like that stone so there are stones gonna be fitting around the headstone which is lovely [Applause] so as we near the headstone more of that love supposed to be dripping coming down now if the spirit of christ is in you it makes you live the life of christ act the life of christ do the life of christ we have got a ministry coming what exactly like the life of christ what will that ministry identify the covenant of the lord oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god praise god so joseph had that rainbow quote right and that quote brom says that represented this group of seven colors was upon joseph was upon jesus was the baptism of the holy ghost the body was covered with the robe the church is not you it's the holy ghost that got you covered from hebrews 7 is complete god was complete seven spirits those spirits were perfect the first was the color of red perfect love redemption and how we had time and so on he said those colors represent the motives of god the attitude of god those seven colors represent seven churches isn't that right all those spirits seven spirits makes up watch in revelation it makes up god was perfection and the only way we could come back to the perfection is to come back to that perfection which is god in other words we have to come back to that seven perfect spirits all those seven virtues flowing into your life here's what i'm gonna get to the motives of it if you just get it for somebody that's different if a man is guilty and locked here we go had went wrong and backslid though he was a hebrew he went on and was backslid he was in grace but he had fallen from it and lot was saved don't ever think lot wasn't saved he was because all the time when he was in the wrong place the bible said the sins of sodom vexes righteous so daily now his flesh was doing one thing but what was his end he brought more disgrace his wife turned a pillar assault he had children by his daughter so you see what it is great it brought because he had fallen from grace and never restored himself back again but god had to take him out of the earth but still here we go this is a big one he was a fallen brother what was and abraham done all that he could do amen to bring him back again amen the spirit that was in abraham is the spirit of christ that is in the church today or should be in the church today doing what doing all that you can do to bring back your messed up fallen backslidden brother who owed a favor with god but the spirit of christ will come with the ministry of reconciliation to bring back your brother back into favor with god that is the spirit of christ oh give the lord a shout glory glory hallelujah no matter what the brother done no matter what the worst of sin the worst of whatever condition the filthier self-condition that's what the blood is for that's what jesus died for for the worst sin for whatever fornication adultery lying whatever condition it is it doesn't matter that's what the blood is for that's what the attorney is for that's what jesus died for he died for your sins to redeem you from your sins to deliver you from your sins that you could go free [Applause] no matter what the brother has done you will do all that you can to bring him back into fellowship of christ again no matter what he has done oh glory to god god some god keep his word won't have a freak body he won't have six fingers on one hand it'll be five fingers in one hand the body of christ won't be a freak [Music] when the last person comes in into the body of christ then it's over maybe over in africa today the last one will be brought in then the book is closed but god will not have a freak body amen watch jesus have to come down himself at the head of the church and he will resurrect this church being his own body there is the body and the way god is expecting us as individuals to grow is the way he brought the church to grow everything changed to begin one church watch these fellows were required watch okay let me go first seven things faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly love advertise and then the love of god the holy ghost christ and the person of the holy ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the holy ghost when you get all these virtues sealed in you then god lives in a tabernacle called the building the living tabernacle of the living god's dwelling place and when a man possesses these things then the holy ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues no matter impersonatory gift but you still might do that but until these virtues go into you you are still off the real true foundation of faith and then these virtues grow in and you add to that then you are living monument you are living moving idle amen hallelujah where i'm going with all of this well on the message got the guide baron says if god gave a duck enough sense to dodge the coldness how ought to give the church if a duck can by instinct what about the holy ghost in the church it ought to lead us from formalities and creeds into a glorious wonderful baptism of the holy ghost that brings virtue and knowledge and patience so since the prophet left the guide was supposed to guide us to this oh man you should be shouting since the prophet left the guide was supposed to guide the people not the ministerial associations not the message popes and bishops but to this year to watch the church watch it ought to lead us from foreign creeds and things into a glorious wonderful baptismal holy ghost where it brings virtue and knowledge patience godliness and the holy spirit that's what the real guide will lead because he will breed nothing else but the gospel amen oh hallelujah glory when that bridge is perfect it's come and we have it today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication perfect interpretation of the word where you could see where you are and see what god wants you to be deal with us not made perfect isn't that right oh hallelujah praise god praise god so the prophet said the people in the message their faith isn't ripe enough oh my god he's talking about the writing of your fate we have to come into brotherly kindness which ripens your fate because faith is based on forgiveness fate is based on so therefore in the ripening of your faith it has to have the application of the blood of brotherly kindness isn't that right oh praise god praise god oh hallelujah i'm about to close oh praise be to jesus oh my my my mind i want to bring something to you that brother coleman had brought out and this was such a blessing to me this is the 9th of june 1991 for a message to brotherly kindness act charity and in this message he fleshed out the contents of charity in a particular way that i want to bring it back to you hallelujah you know what abraham says may god raise up men to make more sense to this message this make more sense to this whole thing called charity let me just bring it here to you now charity we are talking about is not some kind of society give good will and give some clothes and so forth and old shoes we're not talking about that kind of charity we're talking about agape love spontaneous divine love there are nine ingredients i picked out of here in first corinthians 3 of divine love it's right in the scripture patience here we go this is love passive no hurry suffers long bears and believe and hope and endures all things you find that in verse four and seven kindness number two love and action never acts rashly or incidentally not inconsistent or puffed up or proud that's in verse four number three generosity loving competition not envious or jealous number four humility love in hiding not running wrong you know a parade i'm a christian no heirs works does his things then retires out of the way it gets off the scene after good works drops off the fool off it goes doesn't stand around how do you like that does it how does it taste no it's gone it's not looking for medals or merit watch number five courtesy loving society courteous does not behave unseemly always polite it don't push it don't shove always put light at home it's at home with all classes of people black white yellow red or indifferent it's still the same they don't just love the lovely it loves the unlovely all classes never rude or discourteous number six unselfishness love in essence never selfish sour or bitter seeks only the good of others doesn't run others down it lifts others up seek only the good in others does not retaliate and seek revenge number seven good temper love and disposition never irritated never resentful number eight righteousness love and conduct hate sin never glad when others go wrong always gladdened by the goodness to others always slow to expose charity heights are multitudes of sin number nine sincerity love and profession never boastful or conceited not a hypocrite always honest leaves no impression but what is strictly true never self-assertive does not blaze out in passionate anger why did she do this to me i don't understand always joyful truthful knows how to be silent full of trust always present praise god don't we speak with the tongues of men and angels and have no charity and become a song then brass and a tinkling symbol do you understand the message of the rapture if you don't have charity it don't mean a thing to you do i understand all the thunders all these things it means nothing to you until you have charity oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so that's it how many appreciate that word now so i have it listed i want to go to our number one patience love passive secrets here i just want to read it back you have to find it do i bestow my guts to feed the poor do i get my body to be burned have no charity probably nothing charity suffered long and is kind charity envy not charity voted not itself is not puffed up dot not behave itself unseemly seek it not our own is not easily provoked tinker no evil rejoice it not iniquity this is charity talk about charity the love of god this is it here rejoice in the iniquity but rejoice in the truth bear with all things believe in all things hoping all things enjoyed all things charity never fail there's some people like to hear back and i like to hear evil like they hear like they say this thing happened to this one and that one happened this one like to point out faults and failures and shortcomings they love that that is not charity we just write what charity is rejoices not in iniquity hallelujah but rejoices in the truth o praise god number one patience love passive no hurry suffers long beers and believes that hopes on the all things number two kindness love and action number three generosity love and competition there's some people they can't they don't like to lose they're not generous somebody wins something somebody looking good they can't say congratulations that's a hard thing it's them or nobody else it's all about them humility loving hiding no parade courtesy i like this one loving society courteous does not behave itself unseemly always polite number six unselfishness love in essence never selfish sour or bitter seeks only the good enough of others number seven good temper love and disposition museum come up please number eight righteousness love and conduct hate sin number nine sincerity loving profession oh praise god but ibrahim said this i believe the time is coming the manifestation of the gifts that's give to every man that profit all i believe gifts are wonderful we need them and respect them and i believe the time coming when it's going to be in a higher standard than that after all of these things is done away that which is love will endure forever it's the love of god we'll be just standing preaching like this and love will just settle over the building oh hallelujah praise god the message of grace he said it takes a sincerity it takes the simplicity of believing god to make his words speak out to show that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever it takes a humble heart dedicated to god to bring jesus christ into present tense oh hallelujah praise god i'll close it one last scripture for mach 11 jesus answers telling them half faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall see unto this mountain be thou remove and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart which i believe that those things which you see it shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said and therefore i say unto you that whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand
