[28:18] anyone in concrete I don't believe in
[28:21] that sense of permanence that people
[28:23] have to stay as they are I always
[28:25] believe once there is hope once there is
[28:28] possibility and I'll tell you why there
[28:30] was a man in Abraham you maybe she was
[28:32] an old man he couldn't have any children
[28:35] his wife was Barren and the Bible said
[28:38] against hope he believed in hope when
[28:41] there was no hope when the doctor would
[28:44] have turned his back on that man the
[28:46] Bible said he believed God that's the
[28:49] difference when you come to the spot
[28:51] when everything seems to be sailing
[28:54] along you and you choose to believe God
[28:57] for your deliverance to believe God for
[29:00] your healing to believe God for your
[29:02] breakthrough to believe God for your
[29:05] Revival Michael I see all people but

[36:10] given to you the foreign moderately and
[36:13] he will cause to come down for you the

[36:19] full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow
[36:21] with wine and oil and I'll always talk
[36:23] to you the years the Lucas had eaten the
[36:26] conquer worm the caterpillar the Palmer
[36:28] World migrate Army which I sent among
[36:30] you and he shall eat in plenty and be
[36:32] satisfied and praise the name of the
[36:34] Lord your God that are dead wondrously
[36:36] with you and my people shall never be
[36:38] ashamed and he shall know that I am in
[36:40] the midst of Israel that I am the Lord
[36:42] your God and none else and my people
[36:44] shall never be ashamed and it shall come
[36:46] to pass afterwards that I will poured my
[36:48] spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your
[36:50] daughters shall prophesy your woman
[36:52] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[36:54] see visions and also upon my handmaids
[36:57] in those days will I pour out my spirit
[37:00] and I will show wonders in the heavens
[37:03] and hear blood and fire pillars of smoke
[37:05] the sun shall be turned into darkness
[37:07] the moon into blood before the great
[37:09] interprety of the Lord let us pray
[37:11] father we thank you that you have
[37:13] promises for the bride elect before the
[37:15] great and terribility of the Lord father
[37:17] may you come down tonight and begin to
[37:19] manifest your promises pour out your
[37:21] spirit upon your people we are needy and
[37:23] we await upon you in Jesus and we ask it
[37:25] amen you may be seated
[37:28] thank you
[37:30] priests God will have a title the
[37:33] restoration of defeat
[37:35] and our inspiration the promise Holy
[37:39] Ghost baptism to the bride oh blessed be
[37:42] the name of the Lord the promised Holy
[37:44] Ghost baptism to the bride
[37:47] nobody Branham brought one message
[37:49] one inspiration and we are all in it it
[37:54] is an inspiration of Seven Seasons seven
[37:55] Thunders to prepare the people to leave
[37:58] this earth
[37:59] to prepare people to get the extra oil
[38:01] to get ready to be as the wise virgins
[38:06] do you believe that no there can be no
[38:09] real faith without manifestation
[38:12] because works is Faith Express
[38:16] so when we speak about restoration of
[38:18] the faith it cannot be without
[38:20] manifestation because works is evidence
[38:24] of faith if you have faith you will have
[38:27] a manifestation to express the fear it
[38:31] that you see that you have isn't that
[38:33] right and the prophet said there have
[38:36] been no manifestation of God touched to
[38:38] the bride so what he is saying is that
[38:41] fate have to come forward to produce a
[38:43] manifestation of God and that
[38:46] manifestation is what will awake still
[38:50] excite Insight the bride in other words
[38:54] it can't be Revelation only
[39:00] and demonstration
[39:03] of the spirit so when we talk about the
[39:06] restoration of the faith we are speaking
[39:08] about the restoration of power but signs
[39:11] wonders and miracles
[39:14] that is what we are talking about could
[39:16] we give the Lord a shout to praise
[39:18] and there have been an absence in this
[39:21] message of that power but Joel said I am
[39:25] gonna restore
[39:41] and my people shall be satisfied my
[39:46] people they're going to praise me my
[39:49] people shall not be ashamed
[39:55] oh Hallelujah are you with me tonight
[39:59] what is he saying
[40:01] you're redeemed from your sin
[40:04] from your past from your failures from
[40:08] your mistakes you'll be justified all
[40:12] condemned God promised to apply blood
[40:16] upon your life God promise to look at
[40:20] you as if you never did it never did it
[40:24] God promised to justify you not just
[40:29] forgive you come on help me somebody
[40:32] help me somebody I'm getting excited now
[40:35] I'm not talking about forgiveness I am
[40:39] talking about justification as if you
[40:43] never get it you can't sit there and
[40:46] believe that you gotta shout you got a
[40:50] rejoice
[40:53] that is
[40:57] [Applause]
[41:00] my people
[41:02] my people be separated from other people
[41:05] he said my people my very own people
[41:09] called by my name
[41:11] my people
[41:13] this is Jesus come on Oh Glory we give
[41:16] the Lord a shout my people do know who
[41:20] you are when you are my people you
[41:23] better say Amen you better shout like
[41:27] how John Shout
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:41] I call you by name before your mother
[41:45] conceive you before your mother had you
[41:48] I ordain you to be a prophet into the
[41:51] nation
[41:52] I thought
[41:54] in the seed to comfort nothing will stop
[41:59] the mystery of who you are from unfold
[42:03] in
[42:04] thank you
[42:09] so therefore
[42:11] what about him said there have been no
[42:13] manifestation of God
[42:15] to steal the bride
[42:17] it will take those seven Thunders to
[42:20] produce it
[42:21] to produce what
[42:23] to produce a manifestation not
[42:26] Revelation only but a manifestation of
[42:31] God
[42:33] to stay the bride because you are not
[42:36] really bright yet until you come into an
[42:40] experience
[42:41] with your mate your husband but charity
[42:45] with the Holy Ghost is only then you get
[42:48] connected with your husband his wife had
[42:52] made herself ready
[42:54] so God wants to contact you God wants to
[42:58] touch you
[43:02] [Applause]
[43:05] so you must have an experience with the
[43:08] person of the Holy Ghost
[43:10] isn't that right the person of Christ
[43:14] so they're calling out time which we
[43:16] have had for 50 plus years of teaching
[43:21] and Revelation is about to change the
[43:25] season is going to change right before
[43:28] your eyes at the time of the ministry of
[43:32] the spirit the Supernatural and
[43:35] omnipotent speaking even sin being
[43:38] called out it will be changed right in
[43:42] front of your eye Power is coming the
[43:46] black out the spirit of man you see when
[43:49] Peter James and John saw Jesus with that
[43:53] Glory around him they said let us make
[43:55] three Tabernacles and the power shut
[43:57] them up the power said shut up
[44:01] him
[44:02] don't come with the humanists at taught
[44:05] don't try to build no Tabernacle to make
[44:07] no man no glory at the end of it Christ
[44:11] only
[44:12] Christ only
[44:14] Jesus only not even fivefold
[44:20] not past time evangelism Jesus
[44:24] only when they look there was only Jesus
[44:26] No Moses no Elijah no Jesus only have to
[44:30] come after Jesus
[44:32] I only got to come back to Jesus only
[44:35] Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today
[44:38] and forever
[44:40] the power
[44:41] I believe that the time has come for the
[44:44] power of God to follow the word
[44:47] the power is going to change you there's
[44:50] got to come a resurrection power among
[44:53] the bride isn't that right and the first
[44:57] thing that Paul will lead to is to the
[44:59] cross
[45:00] where you are crucified with Christ who
[45:02] give the Lord some Praises oh hallelujah
[45:05] hallelujah
[45:06] not
[45:08] not power to show off not power to say I
[45:11] am right you're wrong no power to die
[45:15] Oh Glory to God because that is where
[45:18] Jesus conquered
[45:19] Jesus
[45:21] he didn't conquer resilience Healing The
[45:23] Sick that was the easy part the path
[45:26] that he conquered is when it looked like
[45:29] nothing happened when he on the cross
[45:31] when he says finish
[45:38] oh Hallelujah it doesn't look Auto
[45:41] dramatic it was painful but it was there
[45:45] he conquered in suffering and
[45:48] crucifixion in Christ being paid friends
[45:52] this gospel has to become real
[45:55] if Christ suffered so must we if he went
[45:58] through we got to go through also no you
[46:01] just have to bless God to escape
[46:03] the terrible day of the Lord but before
[46:06] that terrible they come and they have
[46:08] Darkness grieving us and they have
[46:10] Blackness a day that you wouldn't even
[46:11] want to think about before that they
[46:13] come he promised to send Elijah
[46:16] prophet
[46:17] and he had a job to do he is going to
[46:19] turn not the head of the people back to
[46:23] the theater dividers no not not the head
[46:25] he gonna turn the heart somebody say
[46:28] heart yes I want her God want hot in
[46:33] your heart that's the real you your
[46:35] heart somebody abundance of the heart
[46:37] the mouth will speak when you happen
[46:40] back you can only speak where your heart
[46:42] is at
[46:45] oh you have some powerful things to say
[46:48] tonight
[46:49] and I said I sell him to you the Holy
[46:52] Ghost cannot behave in one man and
[46:54] misbehave in another
[46:57] because God behavior is his person so
[47:00] when God said you turn your heart back
[47:02] to the faith that's just what he means
[47:03] your heart not not yet to go to some
[47:06] church your heart you see the devil is
[47:09] fighting watch the rock of Revelation to
[47:12] the individual
[47:16] so what the devil introduced the people
[47:19] to to church
[47:21] and group
[47:22] so the people end up at group think
[47:27] but once you catch that the Father in
[47:31] heaven he alone is to be healer then
[47:35] that frees you from group church group
[47:40] think group Revelation group
[47:43] interpretation men's ideas
[47:46] [Applause]
[47:51] then
[47:52] you would realize God will have
[47:55] young Sons older Sons and different kind
[47:59] of sons no it's his sons
[48:05] there's you see him as a son just came
[48:07] in five minutes ago
[48:18] as somebody 40 years coming to church
[48:24] [Applause]
[48:31] you see the problem is your humanistic
[48:34] realm where you see in whom spiritual
[48:37] whom are holy whom are righteous but
[48:40] when God brings binoculars he said all
[48:43] have sinned
[48:47] and if you are sin you're born in it
[48:50] [Applause]
[48:52] in other words you're born in it you do
[48:55] it so stop playing righteous we will
[48:59] expose you tonight because there is none
[49:03] righteous no not one
[49:09] check somebody out and tell them there
[49:11] is unrighteous
[49:12] [Applause]
[49:21] oh you could give the Lord a shout
[49:25] [Applause]
[49:30] don't watch
[49:31] the Catholic
[49:32] but my name was in the book
[49:34] I wasn't even my acolyte
[49:38] there's a
[49:39] servant Catholic yeah
[49:43] but God called me
[49:47] the whole family stayed but God called
[49:50] me
[49:51] and I made a choice
[49:52] to give up my sins and repent and get
[49:54] baptized in Jesus name
[49:58] next there could be 40 years since I
[50:00] made that choice
[50:05] a Feeling
[50:06] I'm feeling
[50:07] just as strong
[50:10] that's when I first started out
[50:13] don't let the gray hair bother you
[50:15] because they've got bothering me I just
[50:19] are strong
[50:20] my soul on fire I'm on the expectation
[50:24] I am looking to die no I'm looking to
[50:27] start to live
[50:29] because Jesus said I come that you might
[50:33] have life and have it more abundantly I
[50:37] want the Abundant Life I want God's joy
[50:41] I'm not trying circumstances
[50:52] all right
[50:54] so all of you
[50:56] who want to express your dose of
[50:58] tiredness
[50:59] because you're waiting long
[51:01] cut it out because he come down
[51:05] according to first Thessalonians 4. the
[51:08] Lord himself already come down I have
[51:11] news for you
[51:13] news oh shocking news yes you
[51:16] see but the manam says the seven angels
[51:19] come from eternity to gather up the
[51:21] scattered world to tie it back into the
[51:24] word to bring down the Holy Ghost
[51:28] so they brought down the Holy Ghost but
[51:31] we wasn't ready yet for the Holy Ghost
[51:33] in that measure so the Holy Ghost came
[51:38] down as the word
[51:39] because Jesus said the words that I
[51:42] speak they are spirit and their lives so
[51:47] God take his spirit and hide it as the
[51:50] word which is the revelation of the son
[51:54] of man
[51:55] [Applause]
[51:59] live under the anointing of the ministry
[52:03] of the word to be seated on because the
[52:07] Holy Ghost have to fall in such a way
[52:11] upon planted bread that it will restore
[52:16] God will be the restoration of the pain
[52:22] thank you
[52:22] [Applause]
[52:25] watch this how could the FED be restored
[52:29] and we can't do what Peter did
[52:33] [Music]
[52:35] Peter didn't have Seven Seals
[52:38] seven Church ages
[52:40] all the Mysteries but he had the feet
[52:45] you see the faith is Christ
[52:49] the Holy Ghost in you the person
[52:55] [Applause]
[52:57] not just the baptism but the added life
[53:05] so that is
[53:09] I have something and I could release it
[53:13] I have it I could give it he actually
[53:16] had the dream of God
[53:23] resident
[53:25] and because the gym was in him he could
[53:28] speak for other Sons
[53:32] [Applause]
[53:36] Adam was supposed to do foreign
[53:41] [Applause]
[53:43] wants to bring
[53:45] Representatives like him
[53:48] but when man said it went into the sex
[53:51] way instead of spoken word which was
[53:53] word and spirit so when Jesus came his
[53:57] first message was you must be born again
[53:59] of word and spirit
[54:03] so it had to bring back word in order
[54:06] for you to get back to Spirit
[54:08] but the word was lost
[54:11] so of course in a prophet to restore the
[54:15] word that was lost so we could come back
[54:19] to word and spirit
[54:22] [Applause]
[54:29] so before the appointed time comes he
[54:33] had was to have to call in all time
[54:35] which you're in right now
[54:37] so even though people want to cut people
[54:38] off and top people off God's still
[54:40] calling whosoever will come come quickly
[54:43] spiritually by sit come come come take
[54:45] the word come hold the ticket come
[54:50] ticket is the token the ticket is the
[54:53] word when you buy a bus ticket the
[54:55] doctor the conductor don't want to see
[54:57] your money
[54:58] he want to see the ticket if you don't
[55:01] have a ticket he said go and buy
[55:03] [Applause]
[55:05] go and get some oil and then come back
[55:09] the bus is ready to go everybody's in
[55:12] line have a ticket you have your money
[55:14] you got a million dollars he is
[55:17] authorized only to take the ticket
[55:19] you said conductor hold a hundred dollar
[55:21] bill he said no ticket
[55:23] where do you get it you have to go to
[55:25] the company and buy it and while he went
[55:27] to buy the bus takeoff
[55:32] don't be caught like that you want your
[55:35] ticket your ticket is evidence you pay a
[55:37] price
[55:40] I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you
[55:43] so when you see a man with the power of
[55:48] God you know that man paid a price
[55:54] [Applause]
[55:57] are you with me
[56:00] amen remember Christ in the true church
[56:04] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[56:06] The Book of Revelation shows how the
[56:09] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[56:12] church and defile it
[56:15] that's prophecy what preacher you're
[56:18] going to be giving me the church yes
[56:19] that is by Satan visiting
[56:22] even visiting the panyard and the
[56:24] Calypso Pence know he feels in the
[56:26] church to defile it why because he
[56:29] understands that if we get things in
[56:32] order the power of God going to be here
[56:34] to destroy his works
[56:37] his imps and his demons so he want to
[56:41] affect and inflict and mess up the
[56:44] church to affect the power from flowing
[56:47] freely in other words nobody is supposed
[56:50] to walk in here sick and stay sick I
[56:53] want to declare that tonight I want to
[56:56] say it a certain way tonight
[56:59] nobody should walk in this building sit
[57:02] and walk back out sick
[57:04] [Applause]

[57:55] Association

[58:29] inspired he prophesying he's speaking as
[58:31] king and sowing started to screw up and

[58:44] anointing he wasn't playing Lord anoint

[59:07] do you understand what we're talking
[59:09] about God said anoint that man king

[1:00:37] back good and make a good argument but
[1:00:40] she choose to bring a problem to God she
[1:00:44] chose to weep before God and God saw the
[1:00:49] groaning God saw the traveling and God
[1:00:53] said bless you I'm gonna bless you with
[1:00:55] a prophet
[1:00:57] I'm gonna bless you with a man of God
[1:01:00] [Applause]
[1:01:03] I've heard the groanings
[1:01:05] under Christ
[1:01:07] of my people you see God have to move
[1:01:10] upon your heart to break you out this
[1:01:12] you want to stick around

[1:02:10] the glory that is why a sinner doesn't
[1:02:13] impress God and the self-righteous he

[1:03:57] combustion to start the fire and I

[1:04:51] tall you're dead
[1:04:53] it's a look it's on fire you're on fire
[1:04:55] but lukewarm is in the cold not dead
[1:04:57] that's a kind of sickening thing making

[1:06:07] Free to
[1:06:09] Be Inspired close down
[1:06:13] [Applause]
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:21] Hallelujah you see the thing about it is
[1:06:24] this as humans we feel sorry
[1:06:27] assuming we want to extend ourselves and
[1:06:29] Care in a certain way but God doesn't
[1:06:32] operate as a human does
[1:06:35] his eyes see a different and we have to
[1:06:38] go with the eyes of God
[1:06:40] that's why Jesus always looking for the
[1:06:42] seeds looking for the Sun
[1:06:44] look at the sons of Zebedee with a fish
[1:06:46] and neck and a business and he watch him
[1:06:48] all follow me how you will interpret
[1:06:50] that business knows how to Boom you need
[1:06:54] your boys
[1:06:55] and this man with beard come and say
[1:06:58] follow me and the Bible said they
[1:07:01] dropped their Nets
[1:07:04] to follow on nomad
[1:07:06] a man who had no place no Hotel
[1:07:10] no business
[1:07:14] no salary check the right dot for them
[1:07:17] he said follow me and I will make you
[1:07:22] he says of men
[1:07:24] that's what the gospel is about fishing
[1:07:27] for men
[1:07:28] to understand that they are going to be
[1:07:32] Sons
[1:07:36] ignorant man fisherman
[1:07:38] can't write his name can't read call by
[1:07:42] God to follow Jesus Jesus the only man
[1:07:45] carried car right but Jesus dropping
[1:07:48] promises upon him same works I do shall
[1:07:50] we do also
[1:07:53] he shall say to this monkey you could
[1:07:55] have what you say Jesus dropping
[1:07:58] Promises by Spoken Word
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:03] to their Spirits into their soul and one
[1:08:07] time he released anointed upon them he
[1:08:09] said behold I give you power and my God
[1:08:12] is at the castle Devils they come back
[1:08:14] rejoice and say Lord developer Rejoice
[1:08:18] subjected ourselves to us he said don't
[1:08:20] Rejoice for that Rejoice because your
[1:08:23] names is written because he knew they
[1:08:25] don't have character yet he knew it's a
[1:08:28] taste of power to show them what is
[1:08:31] possible
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:34] I wanted to say beginning on that
[1:08:36] because many preachers have a taste of
[1:08:38] power that God only show what is
[1:08:40] possible but he must have character and
[1:08:43] character is not a gift character is a
[1:08:46] victory you have to go through stuff you
[1:08:49] have to go through something
[1:08:54] so stop looking down her now because you
[1:08:57] fail and you fall and whatever forget
[1:08:58] that it's a good thing you fall
[1:09:01] you know how you fall and you don't have
[1:09:03] to fall again
[1:09:04] because God could Empower you tonight
[1:09:07] power of His word
[1:09:09] and upon that the power of His Spirit
[1:09:11] don't tell me it can happen because
[1:09:13] Samson didn't have the Holy Ghost but
[1:09:16] the spirit Came Upon him
[1:09:18] I'm not hearing you
[1:09:19] and he did something when the spirit
[1:09:21] Came Upon him he that deny the Holy
[1:09:24] Ghost but he walked on water
[1:09:26] I'm not hearing you I'm not here with
[1:09:29] you I'm not hearing you even without the
[1:09:32] Holy Ghost he was in the Supernatural
[1:09:35] Jesus he said Jesus if that is you beat
[1:09:38] me to come and Jesus said come one word
[1:09:41] come
[1:09:44] what would make a normal man walk out a
[1:09:48] boat to walk like Jesus
[1:09:51] I'm not hearing you
[1:09:52] Jesus was walking on the water and just
[1:09:55] said he says that you'll be me to come
[1:09:56] just say come
[1:09:58] I ain't coming if you don't say come
[1:10:00] if you say karma coming
[1:10:02] because I know you are the boss
[1:10:06] that is when they could really trust God
[1:10:09] that's when they can really have faith
[1:10:10] in God and Peter start to walk as he was
[1:10:13] watching Jesus of course the devil get a
[1:10:15] fight because the devastating potential
[1:10:17] and anytime the devacy potentially want
[1:10:19] to kill it so you rip up some waves and
[1:10:22] Peter took his eyes off of Jesus and
[1:10:24] look on the waves and they begin to sink
[1:10:26] in but you know what along with him yes
[1:10:32] among the brethren
[1:10:34] he said Lord I'm taking
[1:10:37] and I kind of like that no Peter could
[1:10:40] swim he's a fisherman all fishermen
[1:10:42] could swim but Peter wasn't taking no
[1:10:44] risk
[1:10:45] why take risk and Jesus is there
[1:10:50] [Applause]
[1:10:56] he could pull you up
[1:11:00] so we're talking about restoring the
[1:11:03] faith right one time she was in the boat
[1:11:05] he labored he he preached and Barnes
[1:11:08] said real a preaching services like two
[1:11:10] days hard labor Jill was so tired he was
[1:11:14] in deep sleep
[1:11:16] storm rocking never see opportunity
[1:11:19] sinking
[1:11:20] no you think the devil wouldn't sink you
[1:11:22] to get a chance
[1:11:24] I'll give somebody a shout about human
[1:11:26] Angels fighting for you

[1:12:10] are in between
[1:12:11] and that God has to fight for you
[1:12:16] [Applause]
[1:12:18] when you think it's bad it could have
[1:12:19] been worse
[1:12:22] Jesus in the boat
[1:12:24] he's tired devil cake was storm the boat
[1:12:27] is rocking after a while the disciples
[1:12:29] recognize they cannot hand it on their
[1:12:31] own let's wake Jesus wake him he's
[1:12:34] sleeping he's not dead he's only
[1:12:36] sleeping he's only in the silence he's
[1:12:38] not dead he's only sleeping

[1:27:31] nobody to support me and then somebody
[1:27:33] said Jesus is on the next rate Lord have
[1:27:36] mercy upon me he began to cry out not
[1:27:39] seek out not depressed out not sad out
[1:27:43] because Jesus is not there near him he
[1:27:47] began to cry out Hearts cry out what
[1:27:50] that crying out was a symbolism of the
[1:27:53] faith inside of him because Jesus
[1:27:56] couldn't hear his cry literally but that
[1:27:59] faith in his soul hit heaven and Heaven
[1:28:03] touched Jesus and Jesus couldn't help it
[1:28:05] he has to walk whoever faith is whoever
[1:28:09] faith is Power is coming and seven
[1:28:12] Thunders the faith and Faith but lead us
[1:28:17] to power and power will take us to the
[1:28:20] promise to manifest the promise and the
[1:28:23] Bible is the road map of God's power and
[1:28:27] hate must lead
[1:28:31] yeah
[1:28:33] how many consultant that one
[1:28:36] [Applause]
[1:28:41] say it again said that the road map you
[1:28:44] may be seated is the Bible
[1:28:46] and Faith leads you to power and power
[1:28:50] lead you to the promise you see we're
[1:28:52] born in sin shape iniquity so we're born
[1:28:54] defeated so we have nothing to boast
[1:28:56] about our abortion is in the blood
[1:28:59] our boss is in the cross because Jesus
[1:29:02] Come To Die to redeem us and the world
[1:29:06] to redeem is to bring us back so he then
[1:29:08] comes into a halfway job I come to
[1:29:10] redeem them but I can't make no because
[1:29:13] things hot boy things really pressure no
[1:29:15] he released the Redemption by releasing
[1:29:18] the book it was a book of redemption now
[1:29:21] if the book is sealed you don't know for
[1:29:23] sure you're there because your name is
[1:29:25] sealed up but once that book is unsealed
[1:29:28] you have the opportunity to connect
[1:29:31] listen to who you really are
[1:29:35] [Applause]
[1:29:36] you talk there was a sinner you thought
[1:29:39] it was a Baptist and Methodist your
[1:29:41] Witness Catholic you taught that but
[1:29:43] when the book opened
[1:29:44] [Applause]
[1:29:46] then you recognize that you are son and
[1:29:49] daughter of God
[1:29:51] not of your mother and father
[1:29:53] [Applause]
[1:29:57] your mother only give you physical
[1:29:59] characteristics but you are the physical
[1:30:04] manifestation of the attribute that you
[1:30:07] are in God so God put that German you in
[1:30:11] the Ducks
[1:30:13] in your dust
[1:30:14] [Applause]
[1:30:20] of God
[1:30:22] [Applause]
[1:30:27] I understand the Bible said the word
[1:30:28] alone is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:30:33] our intents of the heart
[1:30:35] so the heart is uh no trespasses please
[1:30:39] for the devil
[1:30:41] I'm no trespass sign over your heart so
[1:30:44] the devil can't come and trespass what
[1:30:46] God have as a hidden Mystery in inside
[1:30:48] of you
[1:30:49] which is the term now because it's
[1:30:52] inside you Jesus could plainly say all
[1:30:55] that the father hath given me will come
[1:31:10] he's not in that all
[1:31:13] the father
[1:31:14] not not giving me a heart given me past
[1:31:19] tense
[1:31:19] you're not no sir
[1:31:21] [Applause]
[1:31:26] you're getting a revelation of the blood
[1:31:29] that brought you but God put your jam
[1:31:34] in the book
[1:31:36] and when we preach the word we are
[1:31:39] preaching your name
[1:31:45] that is why you could shout out the
[1:31:48] world that is why you can get excited
[1:31:51] because when you hear the word yes you
[1:31:54] have your struggle in your flesh yes you
[1:31:56] have battles in your mind you're
[1:31:57] supposed to have the battle
[1:32:01] if you have no back for something wrong
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:06] so God
[1:32:07] allow the loose end spirit Spirit the
[1:32:10] god of the Loose Ends in the spirit
[1:32:12] people that loose in their life you see
[1:32:14] because the foolish versions are really
[1:32:15] free thinkers
[1:32:21] action they want to do their own thing
[1:32:23] if they talk to them they get vexed they
[1:32:25] do like you say you like how you say it
[1:32:27] you're like what you say they do like
[1:32:29] this free thinkers but God have a
[1:32:32] pattern
[1:32:33] a seamstress work with a pattern I said
[1:32:36] Jessica just watch you and say okay
[1:32:37] you're looking like size 18. give me the
[1:32:39] clothes
[1:32:40] gamer scissors
[1:32:42] let me go
[1:32:44] [Applause]
[1:32:45] you know don't go back again
[1:32:48] it's trouble
[1:32:50] somebody said okay just give me clothing
[1:32:51] images
[1:32:54] no measurement no pattern no nothing
[1:32:56] that's dangerous she could give you a
[1:32:59] second
[1:33:00] so so you just don't do that well God
[1:33:04] had a pattern
[1:33:05] there it is
[1:33:08] [Applause]
[1:33:12] so when God sees us come out God can say
[1:33:15] oh you don't like it so
[1:33:18] how you like it
[1:33:22] himself can't do that
[1:33:24] making not God he said I am God and I
[1:33:28] change not my pattern change not a state
[1:33:32] first for two second knowledge State
[1:33:36] game Templars damn patience then you
[1:33:40] know coming to Godliness then you have
[1:33:43] that forgiveness because faith is based
[1:33:45] on
[1:33:48] [Applause]
[1:33:51] planet
[1:33:54] [Applause]
[1:33:59] go watch
[1:34:01] the devil knew
[1:34:02] faith is beasts upon forgiveness because
[1:34:04] that's what being preached so his job is
[1:34:07] to make sure it have some solidots and
[1:34:11] some concrete Grudge
[1:34:15] long standing for years
[1:34:18] Family Feud for years and the devil tell
[1:34:22] them go to church but do not forgive at
[1:34:25] all
[1:34:27] same and same and Hallelujah
[1:34:29] say Glory Glory Glory
[1:34:31] raise and raise and awake wait wait but
[1:34:34] when you go home
[1:34:36] yes
[1:34:47] I can't afford that
[1:34:49] [Applause]
[1:34:53] so if that church was this past against
[1:34:56] that Pastor this belief against the
[1:34:58] believer husband fighting with wife why
[1:35:01] are you fighting with children
[1:35:02] dog fighting with cat
[1:35:04] everybody fighting
[1:35:08] no forgiveness
[1:35:11] because once forgiveness start to be
[1:35:15] effective you put yourself in a position
[1:35:19] to be like God
[1:35:21] because he smiles on the just and on the
[1:35:26] unjust and the rain just Falls
[1:35:29] on the tomato tree and the marijuana
[1:35:32] tree
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:41] durian duplicate righteous
[1:35:45] today
[1:35:46] I am falling on no my ownership no ganja
[1:35:49] crap only corn tomatoes and melon and
[1:35:53] watermelon
[1:35:55] what do farmers like I go move that way
[1:35:58] the rain don't talk that way they Ruiner
[1:36:01] just fall
[1:36:02] and every seed
[1:36:04] bring forth after escape and if there is
[1:36:08] a son of God's seed
[1:36:10] shown in your heart and that rainfall
[1:36:14] it's got to bring forth I thought after
[1:36:17] its kind
[1:36:19] a Godly kind a kind of holy kind a
[1:36:23] righteous kind every seed brings forth
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:30] so let the devil do his do we got to do
[1:36:34] our do
[1:36:34] [Applause]
