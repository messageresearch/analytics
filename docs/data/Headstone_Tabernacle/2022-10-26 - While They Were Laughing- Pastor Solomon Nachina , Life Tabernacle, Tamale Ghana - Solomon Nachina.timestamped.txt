[27:45] [Music]

[27:53] [Music]
[27:54] The Book of Luke chapter 8
[27:59] then we will read from
[28:01] the
[28:03] 49th verse
[28:06] praise God
[28:07] [Music]
[28:09] now this was just after the woman with
[28:12] the blood issue touched Jesus and Jesus
[28:15] said who touched me praise the Lord and
[28:18] then verse 49 while he yet speak they
[28:23] commit one of the ruler of the
[28:25] synagogue's house
[28:27] saying to him thy daughter is dead
[28:31] trouble not the master
[28:33] for when Jesus had it he answered him
[28:36] saying fear not believe only and she
[28:39] shall be made whole and when he came
[28:43] into the house he suffered no man to go
[28:46] in
[28:47] Saint Peter and James and John and the
[28:50] father and the mother of the maiden and
[28:54] all went very important now praise God
[28:59] and the wield him
[29:01] but he said with not she is not there
[29:06] but sleeping
[29:08] and they loved him to score knowing that
[29:12] she was dead
[29:14] and he put them all out and took her by
[29:17] the hand and called saying may arise and
[29:22] his Spirit came again and she arose
[29:25] strict way
[29:26] and he commanded to give her meat and
[29:30] her parents were astonished but he
[29:33] charged them that they should tell no
[29:35] man what was done may the Lord had a
[29:39] blessing to the real of his word praise
[29:42] God
[29:43] Amen what a glorious time tonight
[29:55] please be the neighbor in the name of
[29:57] Lord
[29:57] I'm entitled to mine while they are
[30:00] laughing praise God and my subject is
[30:04] taken from Jesus's advice to the father
[30:06] fear not only believe
[30:09] and my inspiration is take the deity of
[30:12] Jesus Christ praise God oh you love him
[30:16] tonight
[30:20] is seated as to keep your fire as you
[30:23] keep your praise praise God while they
[30:27] were laughing praise God so he can
[30:30] imagine this group of people Jesus was
[30:33] out there performing preaching the
[30:35] gospel amen and here was a woman that
[30:39] had gone through all that she could go
[30:41] through and have no remedy to her
[30:44] problem
[30:45] but she said if I could just Touch the
[30:48] Hem of His Garment praise God so here
[30:52] was the multitude but here was one
[30:54] person with the focus why is it with the
[30:57] vision one person with a determination
[31:00] praise God and that was faith in a
[31:03] Believer praise God he wasn't even faith
[31:06] that was preached to her but she caught
[31:09] a revelation if I could just touch
[31:12] praise God immediately she taught Jesus
[31:16] that you went out of hell then Jesus
[31:18] said I feel something killer of me who
[31:21] touched me praise God now Peter could
[31:25] not even understand the question because
[31:27] there were multitudes around Jesus
[31:29] Christ they were shoving and moving and
[31:31] praise God but this was power standing
[31:34] there this was virtue standing there
[31:36] this was deity standing there praise God
[31:41] detected by himself nothing they shocked
[31:45] him but they felt nothing praise God
[31:47] they were with him they sat at his feet
[31:49] they felt nothing but here was a woman
[31:52] with faith he was a woman only believer
[31:55] praise God
[31:57] if I could get to him if I could just
[32:00] touch him I don't need him to lay hands
[32:03] on me I don't need him to pray for me if
[32:05] I could just touch the head of His
[32:08] Garment
[32:10] what a faith oh what a fate that's the
[32:14] faith we need tonight if I could just
[32:17] get a hold of the promise if I could
[32:19] just get a hold of his presence
[32:21] praise God hallelujah praise God oh
[32:27] glory be to the name of the Living God
[32:29] and so when Jesus found out praise God
[32:34] that he was this woman with blood issued
[32:36] that attacked her praise God because he
[32:38] said I felt bad to get out of me in
[32:41] other words she pulled power out of
[32:43] Jesus Christ she pulled Praise You Out
[32:46] of Hell by her faith oh blessed be the
[32:50] name of a living God when you come in
[32:52] prison that's what you do when you feel
[32:54] the presence when you know he's here
[32:56] because he promised to be here you walk
[32:59] in here come on you are here to patch
[33:01] the Hem of His coming so pray for nobody
[33:03] you are here alone with faith to touch
[33:07] the head of his comments praise God oh
[33:12] blessed be the name of the Living God
[33:16] Amen praise God Amen Hallelujah
[33:21] so immediately that happened
[33:24] then something happened Hallelujah this
[33:28] man that was there was listening to
[33:30] Jesus he was in church praise God but
[33:34] something was taking place in his home
[33:36] as he was hearing and seeing the witness
[33:39] of faith that was displayed the enemy
[33:42] was working in his home Dev stuck his
[33:44] home town struck his hole and beliefs
[33:47] track his whole sadness from this hole
[33:50] he wants to be discovering for an
[33:52] adventure he was going to believe on
[33:53] Jesus Christ to be saved by the devil
[33:56] the enemy the devorah attacked his home
[34:00] to kill his faith to kill him praise God
[34:03] but the seven said your daughter is dead
[34:07] don't even worry the master in other
[34:11] words don't even bother telling Jesus
[34:13] about it because there's nothing he can
[34:15] do she's completely dead no glory to God
[34:19] glory to God
[34:25] but before God ever does anything he
[34:28] does not do anything for any man's Glory
[34:31] he does it for his glory he was going to
[34:34] be glorified
[34:36] please stop to the servants that don't
[34:40] even tell the master don't bother him
[34:43] because there's no hope praise God and
[34:48] as usual the announcement has been made
[34:50] people started to cry as we will do
[34:54] today praise God you don't allow the
[34:58] death of a person once a person dies in
[35:00] the whole Brother The Wailing and the
[35:03] crying will confirm that somebody is
[35:05] dead so the neighbors began to run there
[35:07] because somebody was there they're
[35:10] crying and the Willing better he made an
[35:12] announcement that somebody in the house
[35:15] was dead Hallelujah so by the time the
[35:18] seven will leave the house there was
[35:20] absolute confirmation that the maid was
[35:24] dead Hallelujah before he run to tell
[35:27] this master your daughter is there
[35:31] praise God I don't tell the master
[35:35] from home let's see what we can do but
[35:39] Jesus had it oh Jesus had it praise God
[35:43] nothing can be hidden before him a new
[35:46] praise God that God was going to be
[35:48] glorified Hallelujah faith has been
[35:51] expressed faith has been displayed that
[35:54] you don't even need a master to pray you
[35:57] don't even need a master to lay hands
[35:58] you don't even need a mother to speak
[36:00] just patching the help of His Garment
[36:03] that he was standing right there oh
[36:06] blessed be the name of a living foreign
[36:14] Jesus told the father fear not believe
[36:18] only Hallelujah
[36:20] and she shall be made whole praise be
[36:23] the name of our living God she is not
[36:26] sick she is dead praise God and when
[36:30] they go to the house he suffered no man
[36:33] to go in
[36:34] praise God God he wasn't time for
[36:37] unbelief it wasn't time for doubt it was
[36:41] time for absolute faith God thank you
[36:45] presence was standing life was standing
[36:49] and they gave the Gate of death could
[36:51] not stand before that day the praise God
[36:55] hallelujah so he kept all the
[36:57] unbelievers out and took only the pure
[36:59] Believers those that knew who he was
[37:03] praise God hallelujah
[37:07] and then the mother and the Father the
[37:10] Bible said and they all wept
[37:17] praise God to cry and demonstrate before
[37:21] Jesus Christ that he was finished
[37:24] [Applause]
[37:29] everybody that was around there was
[37:31] whipping
[37:32] wailing on the floor rolling and holding
[37:36] their tummies
[37:37] praise God hallelujah and bewild her but
[37:42] he said we not
[37:48] now Jesus
[37:50] only believe he's a witness she is not
[37:55] dead
[37:59] Hallelujah
[38:01] now when Jesus made this pronouncement
[38:03] you could not understand the language
[38:06] the importance of the capitals and
[38:08] preaching the importance and talking but
[38:12] this was dating God himself The Giver of
[38:16] Life the maker of Life all the people
[38:20] the Alpha and the Omega was speaking
[38:28] praise God
[38:30] now this is where we are now
[38:34] praise God now God has displayed who he
[38:38] was he told him fear not believe only
[38:43] believe what believe that I am here
[38:45] believe that all is well praise God oh
[38:51] thy daughter is not dead
[38:53] Hallelujah believe that it looks
[38:57] impossible to the human mind but God
[39:00] Specializes you maybe see that in the
[39:03] impossible the beliefs of your human
[39:06] limitations oh did you hear me now God
[39:10] Specializes on the limit of your human
[39:13] limitation when your heart cannot take
[39:16] you God goes beyond that
[39:18] oh glory to God when your reasoning
[39:22] cannot take you God goes beyond that
[39:24] when your desires cannot take you God
[39:26] goes beyond that where your expectations
[39:28] will not take you God takes you beyond
[39:30] that
[39:30] [Applause]
[39:33] so Jesus said
[39:36] with not she is not dead but sleeping
[39:39] and they loved him man now God that were
[39:44] wailing crying
[39:45] oh they tend to laughing
[39:48] see the hypocrisy
[39:54] but they were not crying
[39:57] I service
[39:59] praise God and as soon as Jesus touched
[40:03] their human Spirit don't we She's Not
[40:06] Dead by sleeping they loved him to
[40:10] school
[40:13] amen praise God
[40:16] I loved him to ridiculate praise God
[40:21] knowing that she was dead now that was
[40:25] what their senses could tell them but
[40:28] God David standing they look beyond the
[40:30] realm of the senses
[40:32] he saw that she wasn't dead man she was
[40:34] just sleepy because God was going to be
[40:36] going to be confined he was going to be
[40:38] magnified he was going to be
[40:40] a little bit
[40:41] praise God so what did he do he put them
[40:45] all out and took him by the hand Jesus
[40:48] didn't say now when I'm going to show
[40:50] you now oh in the name no forget that
[40:52] Hallelujah he took it by the hand and
[40:55] God said make arise
[41:00] hey all right
[41:03] praise God and His Spirit came again and
[41:07] she arose straight away
[41:10] immediately as if Jesus was talking to
[41:13] her men arise and she immediately stood
[41:17] up praise God
[41:21] give us some food let them eat so they
[41:24] know that she is not a ghost so they
[41:26] know that I'm not hypnotized them to do
[41:29] some magic this is the one that was once
[41:31] dead she is alive why deity was on the
[41:36] sea dating was on display Teddy has
[41:39] spoken God himself The Giver of Life
[41:47] no
[41:49] but the important thing was that Jesus
[41:52] had to suffer reproach you may be seated
[41:56] praise God and I want us to take that
[42:00] line tonight
[42:01] amen praise God now you can never break
[42:06] through without reproach
[42:10] so when you see things are not going
[42:12] well for you that's true that God is
[42:14] with you
[42:24] Victory the next minute you are down God
[42:27] is there come on now don't give up fear
[42:30] not only believe because the devil is
[42:32] trying to derail you say that he's
[42:34] trying to get you up but remember
[42:36] remember that you're a child of God you
[42:39] are
[42:40] a god the Son of God that's why the
[42:43] devil is trying to shake your faith
[42:46] [Applause]
[42:51] you're gonna I know my redeemer leave it
[42:55] whereas that the Living Faith of the
[42:57] Living God in his church there is
[43:00] something in our heart that speaks that
[43:03] there is a land beyond the river
[43:06] is it your heart tonight
[43:08] that is why you are holding on praise
[43:11] God that's why you believe him that's
[43:14] why you know that this God can never
[43:16] fail every promise he has left in the
[43:18] world must come to pass it must be
[43:21] fulfilled
[43:24] brother don't put my finger on that land
[43:27] neither can any man but there is
[43:30] something within us that tells us that
[43:33] the grave is not in school
[43:36] Hallelujah so death is not our end
[43:41] death is not your end you didn't come to
[43:45] this world just to live eat and die and
[43:47] that anything is the land beyond the
[43:49] river there is a Rapture there's a
[43:51] heaven there's a place that we have to
[43:54] go praise God Amen but before we get to
[43:58] this place whether we must have a
[44:00] reproach we must discard that we must be
[44:03] laughed at we must be ridiculed we must
[44:05] suffer persecution
[44:08] but don't let that stop you praise God
[44:10] your master your maker God himself will
[44:15] take him power filled in hell he had to
[44:18] better approach he has to suffer the
[44:20] reproach he had to suffer the score but
[44:22] beyond that he didn't change who he was
[44:25] he was God Almighty he was Alpha and no
[44:28] maker he was a Giver of Life he was on
[44:30] power he wasn't important he was only
[44:33] said praise God he was the I am that I
[44:36] am he allowed to not stop him he has
[44:38] this belief could not stop him they are
[44:40] mockery could not stop him he was sent
[44:43] for our purpose
[44:44] and he stood just for that
[44:48] praise God so nothing the enemy will
[44:51] bring against you will change who you
[44:53] are you are a son of God you are a
[44:56] daughter of God you are called to
[44:58] Perfection you are called to adoption

[46:46] us that the grave is not his goal and

[53:32] Purpose of God to mourn us and to make
[53:36] us in his own way who knows how to
[53:40] Fashion the material more than the
[53:42] Creator
[53:43] praise God so everything
[53:47] is for the people
[53:50] praise God
[53:52] God knew that it was coming and farming
[53:55] in the land you may receive it
[53:57] [Applause]
[53:58] Joseph was a young boy
[54:01] but God knew that was coming at a time
[54:05] there will be farming in Allah praise
[54:08] God God had to make a way of Escape for
[54:12] his children praise be the name of the
[54:15] Living God so God sent for a Divine
[54:17] Purpose
[54:19] for the children of Israel for Jacob and
[54:22] his descendants praise God
[54:25] it didn't come in a usual way a dream
[54:28] come the way they wanted it Hallelujah
[54:31] to God in the beginning had to give
[54:34] Joseph a gift a gift of vision a gift of
[54:38] Dreams a gift of interpretation of
[54:41] Dreams praise God and it was all working
[54:45] towards his Divine Purpose for his
[54:48] children praise be the name of a living
[54:50] God oh Hallelujah and God made Joseph a
[54:55] dreamer and Joseph was loved of the
[54:58] father praise God in order to bring
[55:01] persecution on Joseph
[55:03] Hallelujah did you hear what I said
[55:06] Hallelujah now Jacob had to love him so
[55:10] much praise God that he would bring what
[55:13] he trained against him praise God so
[55:17] here was Joseph gifted with the spirit
[55:19] of Dreams hallelujah oh and Joseph was
[55:23] not a quiet guy Joseph was the guy that
[55:25] liked to testify he said come on now
[55:28] daddy God showed me a dream as I saw a
[55:30] dream of praise God the Son and the moon
[55:33] oh Hallelujah and he starts bowing down
[55:36] and this Moon and the Sun and the other
[55:39] stars bowing down to this one star they
[55:42] caught the Revelation they've got the
[55:44] interpretation and Joseph knew Jacob
[55:47] knew that one day this sun was coming
[55:50] all to be a spiritual boy to be a son
[55:53] that God was going to deal with foreign
[56:01] [Applause]
[56:22] and the Brethren got more angry
[56:31] why that is how God proves how he
[56:34] strengthens the church
[56:36] praise God hallelujah and so what did he
[56:40] do
[56:41] he hated Joseph
[56:44] they could have killed him
[56:48] my God like you told the devil
[56:50] that is true go after him but don't you
[56:54] touch his soul don't you touch his life
[56:59] praise God because God knew that victory
[57:02] was going to come out to glorify hell
[57:06] praise God so here was Joseph
[57:11] sold out
[57:13] to these ishmaelites Hallelujah
[57:20] and the first thing they did was that
[57:22] they dumped him in the well
[57:24] he could have died in that well the next
[57:27] day they came he was still alive
[57:29] praise God
[57:32] but that was not because it was for
[57:36] Joseph
[57:38] it was God's Divine Purpose in the life
[57:43] of Jacob I mean of Joseph to bring life
[57:47] [Applause]
[57:51] now when you read the Bible Joseph never
[57:54] complained Joseph stayed Focus Joseph
[57:58] was surrendered to the will and the
[58:00] purpose of God oh God will bring me
[58:03] through well I know I will not die at
[58:05] least they have kept me in a well but
[58:07] Avengers somebody will see me and bring
[58:09] me out
[58:12] and here they came and brought him out
[58:15] some said let's kill him and they said
[58:18] though let's not take innocent God
[58:20] praise God and God was touching the
[58:23] heart of them and they said you know
[58:25] what let's tell him off to Egypt far
[58:28] away that no one will remember him
[58:30] Hallelujah are you following me tonight
[58:34] just follow your story now you've got to
[58:37] have the spiritual understanding that
[58:40] whatever takes place in your life is
[58:42] waking up for his glory he's waking up
[58:44] for his good he's working out for his
[58:47] purpose in your life
[58:51] praise God now when they go down to
[58:54] Egypt
[58:56] Joseph said Thank God I'm alive
[58:58] praise God he was Soul into slavery
[59:04] amnesty along the line
[59:06] praise God let me stay here in Egypt and
[59:10] be obedient as a slave praise God for
[59:14] adventure in time will come that will be
[59:16] amnesty in Egypt and Pharaoh Will Set Me
[59:19] Free
[59:22] so Joseph was happy
[59:25] praise God but that was God's purpose
[59:28] all of divine intervention
[59:31] Hallelujah Joseph was going to come into
[59:34] Authority and power
[59:38] praise God
[59:39] so they realized that Joseph was a
[59:42] proper boy
[59:43] a potifier had to take him in praise God
[59:48] and he was giving you know some duties
[59:51] to be in charge of the slaves
[59:53] oh I believe
[59:57] so Joseph was a bit happy
[1:00:00] but he was still in Divine Purpose
[1:00:03] praise God
[1:00:05] hallelujah now here was God working his
[1:00:10] way out to Joseph
[1:00:13] to the human mind because I would have
[1:00:16] been bitter
[1:00:18] but Joseph stayed focused
[1:00:22] spiritual
[1:00:24] as many other led by the spirit they are
[1:00:28] the sons of God we have to learn to talk
[1:00:31] less
[1:00:32] and give him glory most
[1:00:35] [Applause]
[1:00:39] about our situations and give you glory
[1:00:41] I surrender to you Lord have your way
[1:00:43] father Lord be glorified in this
[1:00:46] situation be glorified in this trial let
[1:00:49] your name be glorified for all things
[1:00:51] working together for my good
[1:00:54] praise God
[1:01:08] in order for Joseph to have said I have
[1:01:11] arrived
[1:01:13] if I can fall in love with this man's
[1:01:15] wife who is not always at home I would
[1:01:17] have made it I'll be free but the world
[1:01:21] constrained Joseph amen hallelujah
[1:01:24] Joseph knew that you couldn't do that he
[1:01:26] has hit the law of God in his heart
[1:01:28] [Applause]
[1:01:36] what would you do if you were in
[1:01:38] Joseph's shoes
[1:01:40] would you start the persecution reduce
[1:01:43] the time the trial would you stand the
[1:01:46] hatred and the division and the
[1:01:47] separation and you know to attempted to
[1:01:50] kill and to to destroy his whole history
[1:01:53] praise God what would you do
[1:01:57] praise God that there was something in
[1:02:00] Joseph a seed of perfection
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:06] please stop
[1:02:08] so here was the best one she couldn't
[1:02:11] get her way she had to lie on that young
[1:02:13] man
[1:02:14] praise God Joseph's case was getting
[1:02:16] worse and worse
[1:02:19] and yet he was praying and praying
[1:02:24] and when they brought yourself out he
[1:02:26] never defended himself
[1:02:29] he said amen
[1:02:33] God's Divine Purpose is not that's why
[1:02:36] he said my ways are not your ways my
[1:02:39] words are passed finding out you can't
[1:02:42] find out the ways of God you cannot find
[1:02:45] out the purpose of God for your life all
[1:02:47] you got to do is the leg of the spirit
[1:02:54] let us be left of the spirit
[1:02:58] Joseph had to go into prison
[1:03:01] Hallelujah and in prison you know the
[1:03:05] Butler and the baker
[1:03:07] had a dream
[1:03:09] and not trouble them praise God
[1:03:12] but Joseph God inspired it into Joseph
[1:03:17] you can see your continuous trouble what
[1:03:20] is the problem
[1:03:21] they told yourself the dream and Joseph
[1:03:23] smiled praise God God was sowing the
[1:03:28] foundation laying the foundation for
[1:03:31] Joseph to come to power because
[1:03:34] something Pharaoh was going to have a
[1:03:36] dream that no man could understand that
[1:03:39] no man could interpret except God
[1:03:41] hallelujah
[1:03:45] praise God
[1:03:48] so Joseph interpreted a dream
[1:03:51] and it came to pass
[1:03:53] Hallelujah and when this man was
[1:03:57] released years later
[1:03:58] praise God Pharaoh had a dream
[1:04:03] so if it was you I have been sold to
[1:04:06] slavery
[1:04:08] but you were sold for a purpose
[1:04:12] because there was coming a dream
[1:04:15] and it was not just the interpretation
[1:04:17] of the dream but it was all waking to
[1:04:20] the farming in the land but not just the
[1:04:24] farming but the preservation of life oh
[1:04:27] Joseph was going to come into power
[1:04:34] so in Joseph's case the persecution he
[1:04:37] received was the score and the laughter
[1:04:40] and the reproach but all that report was
[1:04:43] working in Divine Purpose of God for his
[1:04:47] life amen my brother is all in the
[1:04:50] Divine Purpose of God to mold us because
[1:04:53] we are coming to that Perfection now
[1:04:57] David is going to live in you
[1:04:59] for David to live in you you must all be
[1:05:02] strict of who you are what you take how
[1:05:06] you think it should be you must be
[1:05:07] straight completely
[1:05:09] that you can walk in the blessedness of
[1:05:14] his peace and his Divine Purpose
[1:05:20] oh you're loving tonight please stop
[1:05:26] so pero had a dream and you know the
[1:05:29] story
[1:05:30] Joseph was now put in second place
[1:05:33] Hallelujah
[1:05:36] given a ring of authority
[1:05:39] abducted in that place that whatever
[1:05:42] Joseph said it was fire praise God oh
[1:05:46] from prison to power From Slavery to the
[1:05:50] king of Egypt to the king of the world
[1:05:52] praise be the name of a living God and
[1:05:55] God cannot fail whatever God has
[1:05:57] declared in your life will murder storms
[1:06:00] no matter the circumstances no matter
[1:06:02] where you pass it must come to pass
[1:06:05] foreign
[1:06:08] hit the well
[1:06:10] there was no choice than for them to get
[1:06:13] down to Egypt
[1:06:15] when do you come down to Egypt they had
[1:06:18] to bow to Joseph
[1:06:19] can God fail
[1:06:21] can that drink fail could that word fail
[1:06:25] it was in Divine Purpose
[1:06:29] they came there and they bowed and
[1:06:33] Joseph recognized them but they couldn't
[1:06:36] recognize Joseph because they never
[1:06:39] thought he would rise to that place they
[1:06:41] never dreamed in their life oh they
[1:06:43] thought they were persecuting here they
[1:06:45] thought they were approaching hell but
[1:06:47] they were sending him into Power into
[1:06:50] his position into his place and that is
[1:06:54] what God has for you you are living in
[1:06:56] Divine Purpose to cry about the
[1:06:58] persecutions don't cry about the
[1:07:00] rejections don't cry about the reproach
[1:07:02] it is God working out his Divine Purpose
[1:07:05] you are committed to power as touching
[1:07:08] is yours Perfection is yours the Holy
[1:07:11] Ghost is yours the blessing of the sons
[1:07:13] of God is yours today
[1:07:16] giving thanks is a good time giving
[1:07:19] thanks in the bad time is all working in
[1:07:22] Divine Purpose
[1:07:25] praise God
[1:07:28] Hallelujah and that is why the believer
[1:07:31] you've got to look through God's
[1:07:33] binoculars praise God for that Divine
[1:07:36] Purpose
[1:07:38] hallelujah oh the powerful Divine
[1:07:41] Purpose is hidden in the wisdom of God
[1:07:43] not the wisdom of man but the wisdom of
[1:07:47] God
[1:07:54] but how he got to power was not present
[1:07:58] it was beyond the human mind
[1:08:01] but it was God working his way out oh
[1:08:06] don't you love this young girl
[1:08:11] Oh Glory to God so he wonders but
[1:08:15] Abraham said amen
[1:08:17] hallelujah he said and it is it is the
[1:08:21] only grounds of Fellowship that God has
[1:08:24] ever laid down for himself and his
[1:08:27] church is the Oneness of himself in his
[1:08:31] people
[1:08:32] hallelujah the only grounds of
[1:08:35] Fellowship
[1:08:37] that's why we are coming to The Showdown
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:42] that's right but there's coming forth
[1:08:45] amen that is spread of his word Spirit
[1:08:49] of the spirit life of his life
[1:08:52] praise God
[1:08:55] and it is the Oneness of God remember
[1:08:59] our inspiration the deity of Jesus
[1:09:01] Christ
[1:09:03] so the prophet that it is the only
[1:09:05] trance of Fellowship
[1:09:08] that God has laid down for himself in
[1:09:11] his church is the Oneness of himself in
[1:09:13] his people and that is the only grounds
[1:09:16] of Fellowship
[1:09:18] praise God so you can never have
[1:09:21] Fellowship outside be connected with God
[1:09:24] by experience with the baptism of the
[1:09:27] Holy Spirit
[1:09:31] it's not a rituals we do in church
[1:09:35] ah it's not the building and it's not
[1:09:37] what we can do but it is your connection
[1:09:40] with him
[1:09:46] and the holy
[1:09:50] Holy by a union
[1:09:53] hallelujah praise God it's not enough to
[1:09:56] just believe the message you must be
[1:09:57] born again of the spirit
[1:10:00] and when you are walking in the spirit
[1:10:02] life Joseph was appointed you will not
[1:10:05] complain in God's Divine Purpose
[1:10:18] but he played out the path of Christ
[1:10:21] they mocked Christ imagine that this
[1:10:24] girl's Resurrection they loved him to
[1:10:27] store
[1:10:28] but he never moved he walked in Divine
[1:10:33] Purpose
[1:10:34] praise God and the only way you can have
[1:10:38] those grounds is by a union to be United
[1:10:41] with him forever just like when you
[1:10:43] Unite with your husband the woman to
[1:10:46] unite with the husband it is a vowel
[1:10:48] until death now then when you Unite with
[1:10:52] God is the same thing that the church
[1:10:54] United with Christ is until death we
[1:10:57] part so what shall separate me from the
[1:11:00] love of God ah shout persecution shall
[1:11:12] not
[1:11:17] your future
[1:11:19] oh Hallelujah if you can understand the
[1:11:23] love of God

[1:11:30] praise God
[1:11:33] oh is the same thing that the church is
[1:11:36] united with Christ is unto them with
[1:11:40] part and then if you never sin or do
[1:11:42] anything wrong you will eternally United
[1:11:45] with God and only death can take you
[1:11:48] away from God not physical death now but
[1:11:51] the sin of death sin is death and that
[1:11:56] takes you away from God so to be United
[1:11:59] with him in the spirit of his power is
[1:12:02] eternal life

[1:12:09] United with him in the spirit of his
[1:12:11] word power amen

[1:12:28] with God
[1:12:31] that woman with a bloody issue she had
[1:12:34] to connect with the spirit
