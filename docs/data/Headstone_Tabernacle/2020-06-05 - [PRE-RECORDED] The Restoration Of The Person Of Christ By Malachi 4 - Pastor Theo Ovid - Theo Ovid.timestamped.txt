[8:05] mature tree was 16 and 17
[8:20] and Jesus when he was baptized went up
[8:22] straightway out of the water and lo the
[8:24] heavens were opened unto him and he saw
[8:27] the Spirit of God descending like a dove
[8:30] and lighting upon him and lo a voice in
[8:34] heaven saying this is my beloved Son in
[8:37] whom I am well pleased
[8:40] Matthew chapter 17 and after six days
[8:45] Jesus they could Peter James and John
[8:46] his brother and bringing them up unto an
[8:49] high mountain apart and was transfigured
[8:51] before them his face would shine as the
[8:54] Sun is raiment as white as the light and
[8:56] behold he appeared unto them Moses and

[9:35] to graduate to Matthew 17 where is not
[9:39] just this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[9:41] pleased but three more words are added
[9:43] here he him father son please in a
[9:47] position of authority and power and that
[9:49] son has to be a son that has your
[9:52] character that has your nature that has
[9:54] your life Lord your prophet taught us
[9:57] that power with our character is satanic
[10:00] and we know by the word that you look at
[10:03] the Trice's and prove sons to bring them
[10:06] into a place of adoption help us tonight
[10:08] as we approach your word help us tonight

[10:30] [Music]
[10:36] it's a title tonight the restoration of
[10:39] the person of Christ by Malachi for Oh
[10:42] blessed be the name of the Lord the
[10:45] restoration of the person of Christ by
[10:48] Malachi 4 and Sunday we were talking
[10:51] about this a small recap the days where
[10:53] the Pentecostal even made a mistake we
[10:55] think as soon as we become sons and
[10:57] daughters that settles it
[10:58] we just come into a place of trying the
[11:02] Methodist said as soon as I shouted the
[11:04] Lutheran said to believe on my feet no
[11:06] matter what kind of position God put you
[11:08] in you are still growing you are still
[11:11] going on to perfection
[11:12] isn't that right now remember the Holy
[11:15] Spirit has got to bring God everything
[11:18] that every professing Christian see
[11:20] about it so that means that the Son of
[11:24] God Jesus when he got off the water he
[11:26] began to be tried and tested and her son
[11:28] isn't that right he said what are you
[11:30] preaching that for brother branham i
[11:32] want to see the church of god in deep
[11:33] sincerity i want to see the
[11:35] old-fashioned prayer meetings i want to
[11:37] see the times they can't leave the
[11:39] church they want to stay all night and
[11:41] pray and fast and call out till God
[11:43] answers instead of that it's in the love
[11:45] of dwindled away from us the love of God
[11:49] now he spoke about a negative when the
[11:51] son didn't behave himself but he says
[11:53] what if the boy then then he is still a
[11:55] son now we not talking about sip-and-see
[11:58] we not talking about force anointed once
[11:59] we're not talking about false prophets
[12:00] we're not talking about second Timothy
[12:02] heady and high-minded lovers of Prayer
[12:04] we're not talking about that we are
[12:06] still speaking about sons and daughters
[12:08] of God sons and daughters of God not
[12:11] evil people not evil workers not shocked
[12:13] we're talking about sons and don't owe
[12:16] me less than a tonight we are not
[12:18] talking about negative we're only
[12:19] talking about the bride the sons are
[12:21] born of God rather I want to say the
[12:23] sons and daughters of God
[12:24] now watch this now now this is the boy
[12:27] if he come up the way and didn't what
[12:29] the not obedient did not have the action
[12:32] of his father did not carry his father's
[12:35] business on the way his father did then
[12:38] that child
[12:39] missed all its inheritance another
[12:43] brother had two tickets please that's a
[12:45] powerful one now today if we try to take
[12:48] the church before God under common creed
[12:50] we all believe the same thing read some
[12:51] scripture or theology that's not the way
[12:54] Jesus took the church before the Father
[12:56] God wants the church these depart we
[12:59] have to kick with how God wants to
[13:01] church no man have it now hope people
[13:03] like it no but how God wants it God
[13:05] wants the church before God what God
[13:09] wants the church to be filled with the
[13:11] Holy Ghost
[13:12] that's what will not you come and just
[13:15] get baptized that you come and occupy up
[13:17] you let you come and shake the pastor's
[13:19] hand I get up a free Bible no that's not
[13:21] what he wants he wants the church filled
[13:24] with the Holy Ghost let me say Amen he
[13:28] won the church filled with the Holy
[13:29] Ghost watch watch doing the same work
[13:32] that he did when he was here on earth
[13:35] that's the kind of church that the
[13:38] teacher the Holy Spirit will want to
[13:41] present before God he don't want to say
[13:44] we just gathering he want to say we have
[13:46] the same life the same science the same
[13:48] wonders this church looking like it
[13:50] ready to take off this church looking
[13:53] like it ready for the rapture Express
[13:54] that's the kind of church is coming for
[13:56] that just could only have 12 people in a
[13:59] hundred it will have that fifty people
[14:01] from said the church stood original we
[14:04] wouldn't have more than fifty but the

[36:01] Oh glory to God glory
[36:08] glory glory glory all right let's go my
[36:13] events maker my prophecy you were genome
[36:15] your father and you were in your father
[36:17] yet your father had no philosophy new so
[36:20] in jean form there is no fellowship but
[36:23] watch what there was a betting ground he
[36:25] was mighty manifested you that you could
[36:28] have fellowship at you say in a nutshell
[36:30] you're in the gene of your father and
[36:32] then to a womb isn't that right spill
[36:34] Manette come together you become Express
[36:36] manifests and when they become
[36:37] expression still get fellowship yet
[36:39] until they grow up until I can walk and
[36:41] talk and guild words it's not right and
[36:44] the same where we were in his genes we
[36:46] went in stores we couldn't have
[36:48] fellowship with our Father
[36:49] so he make us bypass or theophany drop
[36:52] us down on earth and send him son gonna
[36:54] come out in the age in season in that
[37:01] dispensation and we are going to have
[37:04] fellowship raises people know I want to
[37:09] get to it but Luther was in the womb yes
[37:12] he was in the womb even the Pentecostal
[37:15] was in the womb that's like a mistress
[37:17] could be made known to them so therefore
[37:19] God cannot fellowship with them because
[37:21] they were in the womb but when Malachi 4
[37:24] came he came to release the entering of
[37:27] bat that we could be born in this hour
[37:30] that we could grow up in the soul the
[37:33] quarter said this is my son these
[37:36] is born or gives a lot some praises
[37:40] corner Hassan fellowship or glory
[37:46] hallelujah but apropos you know I'm
[37:50] saying that that's the next quote right
[37:51] here that do if I got it it's right here
[37:54] question and answers yeah when you use
[37:57] the expression if we do not believe the
[37:59] word we will be eternally separated from
[38:01] Christ do you mean the foolish version
[38:04] will live eternally but D will be
[38:06] separated from the New Jerusalem where
[38:08] Christ will dwell with the brain here
[38:10] are those who do not have the Holy
[38:12] Spirit born again as the Scripture
[38:14] speaks of being born again it is a
[38:16] question if the natural but requires
[38:18] water blood and spirit does the
[38:20] spiritual boot requires all three stages
[38:24] of grace before the boost is truly born
[38:26] again he said absolutely he says
[38:30] absolutely I just explained that this
[38:33] morning you've got to have all stages
[38:37] you are begotten of the spirit just like
[38:41] a baby is begotten in the mother's womb
[38:43] but not born until they receive the Holy
[38:47] Ghost you were born damn you are not
[38:51] converted you are in the process of
[38:53] being converted until that time here we
[38:57] go that's the reason that all these
[38:59] great mysteries could not be given to
[39:02] loser could not be given to Wesley could
[39:05] not be given to the ears that just
[39:08] passed by us Pentecostal age why it
[39:12] wasn't time they were begotten now the
[39:17] person of Christ himself the son of I'll
[39:21] reveal himself in human flesh it could
[39:24] not have come tell that
[39:28] so therefore quad was weighted with a
[39:30] special Brad age to bring on the
[39:33] mysteries hallelujah to the science it's
[39:37] not right
[39:37] he says now he said justification my
[39:41] feet was a white sphere and we never
[39:43] move from that Along Came Wesley
[39:45] John Wesley shook them down and down and
[39:48] brought her down to sonification live a
[39:50] good clean life Sammy fight by the Word
[39:52] of God give joy in your heart that shook
[39:54] a lot of Lutheran doctrine then Along
[39:56] Came the Pentecost with the baptism of
[39:58] Holy Ghost that narrow down again and
[40:00] the gifts and the restoration and the
[40:02] Spirit of God had come in in the
[40:04] fullness of sand and one is into the
[40:06] church and that shook Pentecost what is
[40:08] it we are so close to the coming of
[40:09] Jesus until a high here we go
[40:13] people talking about the Trump and talk
[40:15] about the commander Lord but Restless we
[40:17] are so close to the coming of the Lord
[40:19] Jesus watch until the very same spirit
[40:22] that was in him is working in the church
[40:24] not more agents it has to move from with
[40:31] the spirit we have to see the spirit
[40:33] itself beginning to work hallelujah
[40:37] watch watch until work in the church do
[40:39] it doing the very same things he did
[40:41] that he was young good it's never been
[40:43] anywhere back from the time of the
[40:45] Apostles until this time why it's narrow
[40:48] it known what is it there we go just
[40:50] like your hand coming to a shadow
[40:52] negative negative well it's a reflection
[40:55] what was luta so he put luta as a
[40:57] reflection on your hand as they get
[40:58] nearer it coming closer to the real
[41:00] thing is not right it isn't that right
[41:02] the shadow blending it with the real
[41:04] thing so watch what was looted our
[41:07] reflection at Christ what was basically
[41:08] are you French deny Christ but we are
[41:10] the end time each man looked at the end
[41:12] of his Junction for the coming of Christ
[41:14] but it had to look forward to the return
[41:16] of the Jews flying sources in the skies
[41:18] all the things that we see today we are
[41:20] the endtime we are here now they know
[41:22] here we go they know the church was to
[41:26] receive a power that would work in the
[41:29] church the same works of Christ because
[41:31] as a shadow becomes deeper and deeper
[41:33] you take a shade further away from the
[41:36] shade the least reflection you get of
[41:38] the shade and
[41:39] the shield got closer to the tree the
[41:41] shade of the same thing now the spirit
[41:43] that worked under justification and
[41:46] looter sonification under Wesley
[41:48] baptismal holy was from the Pentecost
[41:50] and here it isn't a last day performing
[41:54] and doing the very same thing that he
[41:56] did when it was in Christ what is it the
[41:59] church and Christ has become one so he's
[42:04] identifying his ministry as a sign of
[42:06] the church and Christ becoming one
[42:08] isn't that right now here we go and
[42:11] watch they will connect together and she
[42:13] will go to the sky shouting up will come
[42:15] Wesley looter all the rest of them back
[42:17] there and he does his first will be last
[42:20] and last will be first in the Comoros
[42:22] direction we are the end time what was
[42:25] the Holy Ghost what the Holy Ghost does
[42:27] excuse me the Holy Ghost by
[42:29] justification see a light shadow of it
[42:31] the Holy Ghost by signification a deeper
[42:33] shadow of it the Holy Ghost by the
[42:35] baptism a deeper shadow now the Holy
[42:39] Ghost here we go
[42:40] by the restoration of it's very peaceful
[42:43] being here performing signs and wonders
[42:47] like he did at the beginning they say
[42:49] who glory corner call me Holy Roller you
[42:52] might as well get started right now so
[42:55] justification shadow signification
[42:57] shadow baptism shadow but the
[42:59] restoration of the person that's the
[43:01] real thing oh let me say this with
[43:04] justification may not wait for
[43:06] certification certification make way for
[43:08] the battle Holy Ghost and the Parthenon

[59:30] intellectual knowledge that is not
[59:32] chemistry and biology and physics and

[1:02:01] you one double choke you is this a joke
[1:02:05] you said this is one to choke you the
[1:02:08] baptism of the holy ghost don't mean
[1:02:10] you're going in not at all
[1:02:13] not on that don't have anything to do
[1:02:17] with your soul that's the baptism but
[1:02:21] there's an inside soldier that's got to
[1:02:23] come from God Oh hallelujah oh praise
[1:02:29] the name of the Lord that's why you
[1:02:31] should be shouting tonight hallelujah
[1:02:34] praise God you're inside inside watch is
[1:02:39] a remember in that spirit you can be
[1:02:41] baptized with the genuine Spirit of God
[1:02:43] and still be lost
[1:02:44] it's the soul that lives so like a seed
[1:02:48] you have three parts you have a soul you
[1:02:51] have a spirit and you have a body you
[1:02:53] could be baptized in your spirit still
[1:02:55] not make it but that soul that seed that
[1:02:58] germ
[1:02:59] that comes from God you didn't stop that
[1:03:03] God started that god place you in the
[1:03:07] Lamb's Book of Life you are a gene port
[1:03:10] in this mind before it became word that
[1:03:15] was your gene thought that was your soul
[1:03:17] black ink or it's not right and that's
[1:03:22] soul that's seeded it's what God put
[1:03:24] inside of you and put you in debt and
[1:03:27] plant you in the earth and let the devil
[1:03:30] take you are just one of them normal
[1:03:32] seeds but you are a mystery hallelu and
[1:03:36] a mystery is in your history where you
[1:03:40] come from where I was though when I lay
[1:03:43] the foundation of the earth and the
[1:03:45] mornings I sang together and the sons of
[1:03:47] God shouted for joy you was not you
[1:03:50] didn't come in the beginning you were
[1:03:52] there before the beginning that's where
[1:03:54] you come from that's where your anointed
[1:03:57] comes from that's where your theophany
[1:03:59] is that before there was a moon before
[1:04:03] there was a star before there was the
[1:04:04] word you were the part that was in God
[1:04:07] and the world is not expressed
[1:04:10] so when color they express you he
[1:04:13] expressed the word and the word is God
[1:04:16] so that's why when you yet aware there's
[1:04:19] an instant connection you can't help it
[1:04:22] if it's something else built inside of
[1:04:25] you you can't even control it it is just
[1:04:28] something that's inside of you you are
[1:04:32] thought that coral expressed by this
[1:04:35] bird or chlorine of thought
[1:04:39] and you can only be a word there was a
[1:04:42] thought to begin with or how you have to
[1:04:45] be a taught to become weird to become
[1:04:48] wet you have to be a gene part or give
[1:04:52] the Lord some praise as people that is
[1:04:56] why you ought to be shocked in every
[1:04:57] service praising God every service that
[1:05:00] is why any upper room they would dry
[1:05:03] seeds in the upper room they were dry
[1:05:05] wood in the upper room waiting for the
[1:05:08] spirit to fall I went to spring in the
[1:05:10] fall they bring in a style.i trunk man
[1:05:12] Oh hallelujah a very fine line this how
[1:05:16] to walk like truck man Oh hallelujah
[1:05:18] praise God we want to leave your trunk
[1:05:21] in the spirit they said these people in
[1:05:23] the trunk does you suppose but this is
[1:05:25] that the Prophet joy speaker or there
[1:05:28] was new wine that was stimulated by the
[1:05:31] revelation of the Holy Ghost coming upon
[1:05:34] them
[1:05:34] that's gonna be another stimulation yes
[1:05:36] let me know Jubilee you're gonna be
[1:05:38] released from your sins
[1:05:40] you can release from your character even
[1:05:42] release from your past

[1:05:46] break upon your soul
[1:05:48] [Applause]
[1:05:57] you know decision some preachers take
[1:06:01] this code is code what about the logos
[1:06:04] you're not gonna going with that they
[1:06:07] make the people don't even believe any
[1:06:08] before leave us may believe you have
[1:06:11] this hidden is swollen asset but Peter
[1:06:13] didn't say obviously install I go on a
[1:06:14] poem I ever need that be that didn't say
[1:06:17] that Peter had his seed in a soul and he
[1:06:20] waited because yes a behold I send the
[1:06:23] promise of my father you see you have
[1:06:27] the right to divide the word I send the
[1:06:29] promise of my father upon you Kyrie in
[1:06:33] the city until we receive power from on
[1:06:37] high

[1:06:39] power which is temporary power Judas was
[1:06:42] dead with that power that power was only
[1:06:44] temporary
[1:06:45] opposed only to play for time but this
[1:06:48] was permanent parties it was this was
[1:06:50] residual power this was dynamic power
[1:06:53] now dynamic power is power with the

[1:15:39] Oh hallelujah okay listen
[1:15:43] but the real ordained of God the real
[1:15:46] gene that real germ a soul of god that
[1:15:51] was in God before the foundation the
[1:15:53] world remember that you already got the
[1:15:56] Spirit of God in you tonight you were in
[1:15:58] Christ because he was the fullness of
[1:16:00] the word and he reconciled the world to
[1:16:02] himself
[1:16:03] diddly that he was in Christ if you are
[1:16:07] in God a gene a world attribute from the
[1:16:12] beginning then you walk with Him
[1:16:14] when he was a nerd then you talk with
[1:16:16] him when you are inert then you suffer
[1:16:19] but him on earth then you died with him
[1:16:21] Calvary then you rose with him again and
[1:16:25] you were sitting in heavenly places
[1:16:26] communion with him as the word fees into
[1:16:29] your soul as the word feeds into your
[1:16:33] soul Oh hallelujah glory to God on and
[1:16:41] so Christ spoke of an elected people for
[1:16:44] the last days it will he see the very
[1:16:46] elect it for possible Christ himself
[1:16:49] said that there be either two people so
[1:16:53] you're not ordinary you know there's a
[1:16:55] bunch of test people on the earth he
[1:16:57] said this I never shall deceive the very
[1:16:59] elect if it was possible so Christ
[1:17:02] himself defined pride in this hour or
[1:17:07] she's not chosen by man she's elected by
[1:17:10] God Oh hallelujah the people can live
[1:17:18] clean holy life not be sinful adulterous
[1:17:20] and drinkers liars gamblers and live
[1:17:23] about that and still not with it so I
[1:17:28] look at you you know you know good is
[1:17:32] our mirror of the word and that's what
[1:17:35] you have to focus on if you look longer
[1:17:37] I cook you become a crook if you look
[1:17:39] long enough you become a teeth whatever
[1:17:41] you focusing on whatever they connect in
[1:17:43] with the atmosphere that they release
[1:17:45] you'll be connected with that that's why
[1:17:47] you're taught to classify bombs here is
[1:17:48] your one the Holy Ghost hang around with
[1:17:50] people with the Holy Ghost because they
[1:17:53] generate a certain thing you hang with
[1:17:55] the wrong people you get the wrong toss
[1:17:56] the wrong atmosphere the wrong words
[1:17:59] coming out your mouth praise God because
[1:18:01] you're hanging out with the wrong crowd
[1:18:02] Oh hallelujah praise God
[1:18:06] this is the age of life

[1:23:59] gonna close you my goodness speech eat
[1:24:02] out of the team almost there but boy you
[1:24:05] wouldn't like to hit him you next Pilate
[1:24:07] is taking Oh hallelujah praise God but
[1:24:12] as Moses was calling the nation out of a
[1:24:15] nation Christ today is calling a church
[1:24:17] out of a church you see watch know
[1:24:20] nothing against them he says to refuse
[1:24:23] the person that's doing the callin no
[1:24:26] matter if you're a Pentecostal Baptist
[1:24:27] nothing against them not at all but this
[1:24:29] is the age you've gotta accept the
[1:24:31] personal Christ which is the word Oh
[1:24:34] Lord my goodness cut it cut about five
[1:24:38] more minutes again Christ my shaco
[1:24:41] revealed where I'm said the new blood
[1:24:43] and what is it now look look Christ in
[1:24:45] you makes him the center of life of the
[1:24:47] revelation Christ life in you makes him
[1:24:51] the center of the revelation Christ in
[1:24:54] the Bible makes the Bible the complete
[1:24:56] revelation of Christ here we go now
[1:24:58] Christ in you makes you the complete
[1:25:01] revelation of the whole thing now I know
[1:25:05] you can get that all the mysteries all
[1:25:09] the teachings all the things that that
[1:25:12] sum up into Christ in you
[1:25:16] what's the new burden but a Branham what
[1:25:18] is the nubile it is a revelation of
[1:25:20] Christ personally to you not you joint
[1:25:23] Church not you shook your hand anything
[1:25:25] like that what is it here we go you say
[1:25:28] when I'm Lutheran I'm Baptist I'm
[1:25:29] presbyterian that don't mean a thing to
[1:25:32] God during the message that doesn't mean
[1:25:35] a thing to God listen to what is you
[1:25:38] know what is it
[1:25:39] are you ready it is Christ being
[1:25:44] revealed and he is the word and when the
[1:25:50] word is revealed it expresses itself now
[1:25:59] people only equate revelation with
[1:26:01] information knowledge and toxification
[1:26:04] an another word talking yappin the Kotok
[1:26:08] it the talking revelation but when
[1:26:10] Christ is revealed it is expressed so
[1:26:15] that's the purpose of Jesus Christ to
[1:26:18] express himself so all these services
[1:26:22] teachings world is to eventually become
[1:26:26] flesh in you that Christ comes out of
[1:26:31] you that people to take note that you
[1:26:34] have been with Jesus because Peter could
[1:26:37] even write his name the Paris that they
[1:26:39] were ignorant and unlearned but they had
[1:26:42] to take note that had been with Jesus
[1:26:44] because Christ was middle eyes made
[1:26:47] manifest in them as wasn't Moses
[1:26:50] [Applause]
[1:26:53] these guys are no cxe no GC your passes
[1:26:56] no University grief no mass there's
[1:26:58] nothing like that but that Kaizen em
[1:27:00] listen you know we crisis the mystery of
[1:27:04] God living in them and that is what got
[1:27:08] to live in you say see when you have
[1:27:10] that there is no Baptist Methodist there
[1:27:12] is no argument the manifestation is the
[1:27:14] interpretation or glory to God here we
[1:27:18] go
[1:27:18] I'm almost done watch so Christ
[1:27:20] expressing myself in the individual room
[1:27:23] where I is in the lecture when I he
[1:27:24] don't know his ABC half the Apostle
[1:27:27] didn't know it but I know Christ so the
[1:27:30] new birth is a revelation God has
[1:27:31] revealed to you this Christmas mystery
[1:27:33] it's a personal individual affair but
[1:27:36] the person that Christ is revealed to
[1:27:38] them so this more a group inspiration
[1:27:41] this link groupthink group theology this
[1:27:45] is you and God not you and your family
[1:27:47] not you and your brethren not you and
[1:27:50] this group ends a small group and we
[1:27:52] gather together and we believe this it
[1:27:54] have no we believe it is Christ
[1:27:56] expressing himself through you we
[1:27:59] believe that get as far now if you say I
[1:28:02] know you say this before but it will
[1:28:04] come fresh tonight if you say he has
[1:28:07] been revealed to me and the life that
[1:28:10] Christ produced here in the Bible does
[1:28:13] not produce itself in you you cut the
[1:28:15] wrong revelation Oh hallelujah so the
[1:28:21] revelation brings the life the real
[1:28:24] revelation that's why the Bible but
[1:28:28] about these divinely revealed mistreats
[1:28:30] roots it's what will literally turn the
[1:28:32] hands of the children back to the faith
[1:28:34] of the fathers so we understand how
[1:28:36] people have more intellectual faith than
[1:28:38] real revelation of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:40] comment down inside your fate they got
[1:28:43] that will give you an anchor when the
[1:28:45] storm come you Bianca
[1:28:46] Paul said in this way what can separate
[1:28:49] me from the love of God that is in
[1:28:51] Christ Jesus shall prosecution shall
[1:28:53] pressure
[1:28:54] shall take nothing present nothing to
[1:28:55] come witness separate me from that goal
[1:28:58] from that love from that purpose
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:02] [Applause]
[1:29:04] watch Wow and the life of Christ protect
[1:29:08] himself true you with the preeminence is
[1:29:10] to the people and they see the very life
[1:29:11] works science wonders what he did watch
[1:29:14] outside of that the rest of it is not
[1:29:16] even called to watch by lack of this
[1:29:18] revelation is why we are so much
[1:29:21] divisions and so much mockery so much
[1:29:23] divisions because the people lack the
[1:29:25] revelation they lacked version the
[1:29:27] teachers so because the teachers don't
[1:29:29] have the revelation did you know kind of
[1:29:31] crazy stuff what kind of foolish stuff
[1:29:34] and the people taking the stuff to say I
[1:29:36] am right you are wrong we are higher you
[1:29:38] are lower
[1:29:38] we are in front you are behind we have
[1:29:40] something you don't
[1:29:42] and in a bunch of immaturity that God
[1:29:46] can't come and confirm no fujas like
[1:29:48] that God was trip people trip Isaiah
[1:29:51] shut this one and shut that one Jesus
[1:29:54] went to tree to the other heart rise
[1:29:56] tree how he has an other trials to get
[1:29:58] an approved son why because character is
[1:30:01] not a gift
[1:30:02] we could never overemphasize that
[1:30:05] character is the victory you can't pay
[1:30:07] for character you can bribe but the rap
[1:30:09] tilaka past money for character you can
[1:30:11] see you have this annual character
[1:30:13] praise god most of the time people a lot
[1:30:15] of stuff have no character
[1:30:18] after they get blessed again Aragon to
[1:30:20] get proud everything else going to break
[1:30:22] people the Bible says Jesus learned
[1:30:23] obedience by the teen that he suffered
[1:30:25] God warns character but character is not
[1:30:28] a gift God gives you that you have to
[1:30:31] overcome something that's right the
[1:30:33] child after a while become the greatest
[1:30:36] thing in your life because every child
[1:30:38] needs an opportunity for victory every
[1:30:41] child needs an opportunity to be changed
[1:30:43] every child me like opportunity for your
[1:30:45] nature to be affected so you're not
[1:30:50] afraid of the storms you're gonna fail

[1:31:40] you were to choose to accept a Creed for
[1:31:42] my baptism offering you're supposed to
[1:31:44] lead here watch until the reckless self
[1:31:47] dead far from of the altar is not right
[1:31:49] I'm closing now what in very plain
[1:31:53] language now a hundred months 4:16 watch
[1:31:56] the Bible talk about Galatians tree
[1:31:58] identified the seed singular with Jesus
[1:32:01] and come to the sea children as Jonah
[1:32:03] promise and promise have to do with
[1:32:05] election the children of God that is
[1:32:08] exactly what we have been seen these who
[1:32:10] are the royal seeds are the elect of God
[1:32:12] are the predestinated for known of God
[1:32:15] in the mind of God in his thoughts in
[1:32:17] very plain language the true Bride of
[1:32:20] Christ was in the mind of God eternally
[1:32:23] do not express until each came fourth in
[1:32:27] the designate
[1:32:28] the greet season as each member came for
[1:32:32] it become Express and took its place in
[1:32:35] the body thus the pride is the literal
[1:32:38] spoken woodsy bride and she is feminine
[1:32:42] and designation she is called the body
[1:32:44] of Christ and he is the head Oh glory to
[1:32:47] God it is very apparent that she ought
[1:32:50] to be called that for she was
[1:32:52] predestinated in him came from the same
[1:32:54] source
[1:32:55] once he turn over him and now manifested
[1:32:58] God in a many membered body whereas once
[1:33:01] clothes manifested in one member even
[1:33:03] our Lord Jesus Christ we did not become
[1:33:06] seed by the rebirth we will see the deer
[1:33:09] for will reborn because only the elect
[1:33:12] can be reborn so when Jesus said you
[1:33:15] must be born again
[1:33:16] he was talking to elect some praises
[1:33:21] people Oh hallelujah glory now watch
[1:33:27] but Abraham talked about Samson here's
[1:33:30] my only hope this morning to write my
[1:33:32] message up while Samson was bummed and
[1:33:35] you shocked to hear groves or let them
[1:33:38] laugh at us let them laugh at what
[1:33:40] happen in the church let them laugh what
[1:33:42] happened to people and so on but why
[1:33:43] Samson was wrong I knew he rolled
[1:33:46] out
[1:33:46] he said God send us another Church in
[1:33:49] the end time that the power of the Holy
[1:33:51] Ghost could come into her in the
[1:33:53] demonstration of the spirit acts 2 acts
[1:33:55] 2:38 would follow signs wonders
[1:33:58] accompany the Apostles he said while be
[1:34:00] in prison surely God is going to crop
[1:34:03] somewhere for that last great kill maybe
[1:34:07] you my Christian friends that your
[1:34:09] strength is beginning to come back so
[1:34:11] the seventh under revival is to bring a
[1:34:14] deliverance from every spirit that will
[1:34:16] keep the principles of the kingdom of
[1:34:17] God from flowing through you that will
[1:34:19] stop God's righteousness from flowing
[1:34:21] through you the seventh under revival is
[1:34:23] the last quick kill to kill the lion
[1:34:26] demons the lust demons all the demons
[1:34:28] the seven thunders is the last great
[1:34:29] killed he said me the son son of God

[1:34:38] until this new crop goes out until they
[1:34:41] come for a joy in Zion and they come for
[1:34:43] a group that can recognize and
[1:34:45] understand and can see the Messiah and
[1:34:48] the hidden power that hid from the world
[1:34:50] that they will understand it now long as
[1:34:54] people Oh hallelujah glory and when that
[1:35:00] light struck little Rebekah
