when all hell was against this ministry and the church and my family you stood with me god bless you you're getting standing there hallelujah your faith was not in vain oh glory hallelujah be amen certainly love and appreciate you amen and what i've been preaching for the past years has been my core belief like core in terms of this is my inner being sovereignty of the local church the freedom of the spirit the holy ghost certain things are just in resonating my system not the system of man and the power of of bishoprian and and mother church and whatnot all these things that's not part of my system i have always been i feel that the saints should have that liberty of god i see legalism over the years trying to conform people and pong them and push them and run with it but there is nothing when the love of god takes your heart and you understand the grace and the mercy and the opportunity that god has given you some people take it for granted they just care for you with it but i can't be every day i'm grateful every day i'm thankful because he doesn't have to give me another day just think about just think about it now many people are not going to even reach your age but god gives you another day another year another time another season free i didn't come to say all of that this morning but such an atmosphere i don't want to leave but we leaving today five requests so you want to pray for us but we have service on easter easter morning eight o'clock at least a friday five o'clock so be here give support and god gonna bless you tremendously do remember us in prayer for every course and also in april when i get back i have some meetings in kentucky two churches i have some services there also remember some prayer so in a great uh great uh expectation for god and god has given me real strength i know it is strength of the lord god i've touched my kidneys touched my body i can do what i've done for the past two years the god didn't help me physically so i am very very grateful to god there was such a great need i remember my testimony 2010 the lord spoke to my heart and said i'm back on the fields i was in the field for many many years the lord spoke to me through my wife and standing lord told me i'm back in the fields there was nobody there was no cause there was nothing and 2012 the cause began to come in and god fulfill his word god never speaks something that he can't back up god can't lie if god speaketh if it's god if it's god he will vindicate it there's a need there's a need out there and now that god is opening the world to us in such a positive way then you realize that a lot of things say mirrors and shadows it's just shadows it's not the real thing the real thing is christ and you christ in you all right that's the real thing not the church not the organization not the group not the body a people but christ in you the hope of glory and when you see that you are an individual powerhouse you become a source of god you see you you come your own power source then afterwards you have to plug into nobody you plug into the source himself resource coming inside of you then you become a source of god to go out to the world to your family to your loved ones isn't that beautiful this morning oh hallelujah as they grow in god the weight of the world falling off of you the old leaves of your life falling off of you depression begin to fall frustration begin to fall you begin to grow in god you get closer than god you get more mature the things that you couldn't overcome you start to overcome because you recognize those things are petty those things they you're called to overcome it the struggle is great it was a great struggle your struggle whole week to be here but you thank god your victory you've made it to be here oh glory to god this is the sun that we call palm sunday this is when jesus come down a little donkey praise god right in jerusalem you tell them go and tell that man that donkey is for me go and tell them the master of need of that donkey hallelujah that man gonna release that donkey oh glory to god and you don't have need of you come on now the devil has to hey devil have to let you go the devil have to lose you because god wants to ride you this morning oh don't let me inside the preach this morning the priests are going to come and preach but god going to write you want to write you this morning go give the lord a shout in the house my okay so we are sharing the service this morning and uh we're lucky to stand on them and we want to go into the word luke chapter 14 and revelation chapter 18 for scripture reading by the grace of god luke chapter 14 reading from verse 16 luke chapter 14. so when i finish isaac your eyes are going to come afterwards and minister to you and we have special service today now we have the prayer line reading from verse 16 then he said this is and then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and beat many sent his servant at suppertime to say to them that forbidden come for all things and already and then all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him i have bought a piece of ground i must needs go and see it i pretty have an excuse another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i have to prove them i crazy have me excused another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come so the servants came showed his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to himself and scored quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bringing hither the poor and the meme and the halt and the blind and the servant said lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways into the byways and go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper reading from revelation chapter 18 verse 1 to 5. and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the greatest fallen is fallen and has become a habitation of devils and the hold of every false spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations are drunk of the wine of the wrath of a fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of a delicacies and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out from her my people that she be not partakers of her sins and that he received none of our plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and god had remembered her iniquities that's boris who to pray father we thank you for your word bless it interpret your hearts confirm your word with signs wonders and miracles and bless your people your needy children that are here looking for virtue deliverance touch healing from you granted father honor your word lord in jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise god blessed be the name of the lord just give god some praises as you are seated i have a title this morning and yet there is room amen that's my title amen have an inspiration come out of babylon come out of confusion because that is what babylon is i want to bring back something we said two sundays are back from the seal of god but abraham was saying this the first church started off at the pentecost where the holy spirit was poured out on believers that is where the church started off start of where at pentecost we saw the reaction of these believers and how it acted upon them what they did and the signs and wonders that followed them now after the closing of the church age about 300 years they sprung up a heresy among them called the doctrine of the nicolaitan it was a heresy and that word nicoletan means a conquer the lady it was the introduction of men ruining the church without holy ghost structure of men okay we find out it was deeds to begin with the next church age would become a doctrine and then become persecution in a dark age then when martin luther come out seeing the spirit of god lead him out instead of letting the people stay free he organized the church an image lightened to the beast so clearly the prophet revealed what the image of the beast is any organized church is image unto the beast because the b system is the catholic church which was the first organized church and on her relations 17 said she had blasphemous names and these names are like baptist mothers pentecostal witnesses all these names are names of blasphemy because god didn't make that god only making sons and daughters in the last days god from his sons and daughters methodist produced methodist baptist produced baptist pentecostal produced pentecostal but god's word produced sons and daughters so god promises an elijah the prophet to turn the house of the children back to the faith of the fathers so god called the mother church a and call it that your daughters which is protestant churches so podca called black because both all are filthy in god's sight and it's a spirit it's an organizational spirit and once that take church once that take over then the people don't speak as individuals they speak with the church voice and that is the be system when you're speaking with a church voice when you no longer have the voice of god as an individual by revelation peter said the christ the son of the living god peter didn't speak for nobody jesus said flesh and blood had not revealed this unto you but my father had revealed it unto you and i said thou art beaten upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell will never prevail against them so when martin luther come out seeing the spirit of god leave him out instead of letting the people stay free he organized the church and imagined the beast a political power likened unto it watch so then they organized the church and made an image unto the beast a political organized power purpose to bind the people to a creed instead of being free to worship and walk in the light [Music] what do you realize christian friends that the antichrist which is the mark of the beast the antichrist anyone knows that the mark is a power the beast is a power here we go are you ready there's a power of the catholic church there's a power of the methodist church there's a power that's that is beast power the baptist church the same all of them the pentacles are just as bad so the prophet prophesied in 1955 around the 50s that there will come a message among the gentiles that will bring the bride out so many are being people being marked by the beast system and don't even know it listen to what the prophet said he said well god bless you from seed of the antichrist he said if you want to see real christian genuine gifts and not impersonation if you want to see real solid christians walking and so salty till they eat it's tinsel we can't go down the street and tell what a christian is anymore they go down the street they act the same they talk the same all the time cracking all kind of jokes everything like that when god said you give a kung fu every idle word that you speak what happened because brother you will let the devil come in and put it over your eyes the first thing you know hear the prophecy the time will come when god will give a message and you'll be sealed in or out of the kingdom amen here is the prophecy a message will come that will produce the ceiling in or seal it now no other thing sealing or sealed out so therefore when god gives that message you are sealed in or sealed out of the kingdom of god isn't that right and the seat of god is the holy ghost the mark of the beast is rejecting it amen or unbelief in the holy ghost or turn along the holy ghost that is the mark of the beast so the holy spirit come to seal you into the body of christ not into a church hallelujah that means you could go anywhere and worship you could go any country and worship you could go any church and worship because you're not stealing the church come on now you are sealing the christ [Applause] oh give the lord a shout so all this thing you have to come to this church is foolishness you have to come to duchess that's nonsense that's babylon come out of her my people or get the lord i shout the praise hallelujah that's confusion [Applause] my god i always wondered about that angel version 18. i was wondering about that why the messi was come out to battle run no i know with all this sort of confusion they've got to come on with message a genuine echo message that say come out of babylon babylon means confusion in other words when you come out there can be no confusion nothing messing your mind you should know where you come from you're supposed to know where you're going you're supposed to know who you are what you're going for no confusion oh thank god to be out of babylon babylon is falling babylon [Applause] will fall let me say it clean every man system built in this message of seven seas and seven thunders will fall [Applause] the only thing that gonna stand is the word of god bible says we have received a kingdom that that that cannot be moved because everything that can be shaken will be shaken everything that can be shaken will be taken but we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved oh hallelujah when god put you in the kingdom who could take you out of the kingdom [Applause] [Music] who are these intellectual giants trying to put people out they don't have a heaven they don't have a hell they can't keep anybody out and yet there is room [Applause] oh glory to god there is room for your family come on preach back to me there is room for your loved ones there's room for the prostitute there's room from the drunkard call the lamb call the halt call the blame yet there is room [Applause] oh give him praise give him worship give him glory glory to god yet there is room they say but i'm a sinner there don't let the devil tell you otherwise yet there is room [Applause] don't put nobody out you you didn't design the kingdom you you didn't lay the foundation of it thereof you you didn't do it you don't have the key to the door of it so you can't put anybody in and neither could you put anybody out you you can't say this one not gonna make it because they did this that and the other you you can't say this one can't make it because they fell here and they failed here and they did this here you you can't say that but the master said go and find him find him find them find them find them and the voice said it is done but there is room come on now help me somebody [Applause] glory glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah find them find them find them and yet there is room [Applause] you may be seated so much room so much room you tell them compel them that's different from accident they're coming you know that didn't invite them to come in nice tell them i'm coming to pick you up i'm coming to wait on you i carry the service this morning i'm waiting to come out i'm buying a dress for you i'll bring in a pants for you i could buy you a tie you have to be there this morning disneyland street this is victory day this is healing day this is fire falling day [Applause] [Applause] don't let nobody think you they will kick you out of the kingdom they can put you on the kingdom oh hallelujah or praise god just a little more hallelujah and the preacher are going to preach something to you this morning hallelujah oh glory to god i love that parable i love that story you already must have seen none of them who make the excuses none of them who got invited will be received taste of his supper remind me of the two million people that came out two million people didn't go in they just come out don't be like that don't be satisfied to come out i'm not a baptist i'm not a catholic i'm not a pentecostal you come out but have you gone in all right how many messages i believe william branham that's good you come out but have you gone in because the prophet himself he brought a message to go in message ephesians oh praise god all right now let's go now watch this is from christ the mission god reveal here we go god holds the key to the revelation of christ himself schools of theology can never find it jesus said so scripture matthew 11 25 and 27 jesus said i thank thee father god of heavens and earth that was hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent and has revealed it to babes such as would learn jesus himself said he hide it from them [Applause] but reveal it to his elect so watch isaiah said you have ears you can't hear eyes you can't see because isaiah said in the spirit god has blinded your eyes you do like eve accepting the intellectual side and know nothing of the spirit of god won't they fall in the ditch both the leader and the blind too the leader will fall with the blind because he's blind also the leader fall he's blind leaving the blind they both fall into the ditch do you say let them alone let the blind lead the blind we're not responsible for the blind leading blind we're responsible to bring the word to the elect thank god god open your eyes that you could hear and see and be free oh hallelujah god alone holds the key he expressed the same thing in the previous scripture who the men said the son of man and he told peter what when peter said that what the christ blessed us all simon jonah flesh and blood has never revealed it to you but my father which is here must reveal to you so therefore here we go there is no school no theologians no teaching of the bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it it's impossible for them to know anything about it god has hid the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers it's a personal individual affair with the person that christ has revealed to them did you get that it's not a group thing it's a personal affair that christ has revealed himself to you sometimes i wonder if people have ever met christ have you met christ have you met the lord has he softened your heart speak to your heart has you shown him has he shown you his cross have you fell at his feet and experienced the dripping of his blood from off calvary hallelujah mercy there was great and grace was free pardon there was multiplied to me there my burden soul from liberty and cavalry had you had a calvary experience when you could sing at the cross at the cross when i first saw the light turn at the cross where my savior died hallelujah dare from cleansing from sin i cried dear to my heart was the blood of plow singing glory to his name that is a rich christian experience not this intellectual mumbo jumbo sitting in a pew saying it in the message no they got to have a heart shaking demon chasing covering holy ghost anointing gospel that's what's lacking let's go if you say he's revealed to me and then the life that christ produced here in the bible does that produce death in you you've got the wrong revelation so they're not a talk thing they're not a talk show it's half talk show and comic shoe this is not that this is you have to have back in with your testimony isn't that right every denomination will be a fruit of itself of its own life and if here we go that original vine ever put forth another shoot it with their grapes like it did the first time now this is what i like the life of jesus christ ever puts forth another body of believers it would be the fruit of the first one did they will write a book of acts behind it oh you should give a scream on that one because that is the original church that is what the prophet was saying back to in the book of acts was in church who was the bishop who was the pope who was the man in church who was the man of the hour it had none like that the holy ghost sent peter so the holy ghost and philip the holy ghost sent also come on give the lord a scream in the house [Applause] here we go save the church is to put forth another branch it will be another book of acts it will be the acts of the holy ghost move into the people god [Music] is not known by education that's right you want a bigger bomb i'll keep reading god he is not known by how to explain it [Applause] let us talk a little bit somebody want to explain to trump god is not known like that somebody want to explain the new name you can explain it god's not known by explaining it i spend the millennium explain the seven seal explain the seven thunders god is not known by explanation he is known watch by simplicity and revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person you don't need education to get revelation [Applause] moses had education egyptian education moses was qualified he had his degree and masters in egyptian arts but when he killed the man he ran with his degree with his masters he ran straight out in egypt and went and established himself with a family relaxing for 40 years that same man that run went fire when fire came upon that man he said i can't talk what i make more continue [Applause] let that fire come upon your life once when i get them peer pressure i don't let me know people trying to push me and all my friends trying to push me and this one trying to pull me let that fire come upon you once this one it may be caesar that fire wrecked moses intellect when god finishes moses and you meet his wife he said where you going he said i go in to take over i'm going back to egypt not going back to egypt to take over that's when a man met god nothing blocks him nothing stops him nothing interrupts him that man is focused that man don't care that man is unstoppable that man is invincible that man cannot become conquered oh glory to god that man is a one-man invincible helmet sent by god he's one cent some went but this one was sent come on say him as somebody oh glory to god we don't bother with who just went oh but when god sent that something else the whole heaven behind you all the angels behind you the fire behind you the anointing behind you oh glory to god what a revival are we going to have [Applause] so god is known by simplicity and a revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person not your child not your theology is a revelation of jesus christ upon this rock i'll build my church no the rocks accepted no other things accepted nor the roman rock protestant rock nor the school nor than nothing but exactly the revelation of jesus christ through the new birth you never hear jesus christ's name once it's astonishing a whole service are you not even any name jesus every other thing what do you do that boy the bible is the revelation of jesus john all these mysteries john's the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him all these symbols have to do with jesus christ he's the mystery behind it john said herself whitewashed rider bow with no arrow red horse bailors that was john c but behind that had paul martin arenas they couldn't see all of that that was stars in the right hand of god symbolize [Applause] so wherever you see the enemy don't just look at the enemy alone behind that has something hidden there come on now come on give me a scripture preacher whenever the enemy coming like a flood [Applause] the spirit is always there the rays are standard so the enemy comes like a flood and you're feeling wrong and you're feeling drowning and you feel like you're sinking but god is here today the rays are standard in your life okay here we go so exactly the revelation of jesus christ through the new birth he he's born in there and listen he injects his own life your life is gone and the life of christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminences to the people and they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest of it is not even called two at all watch god's great revelation unfolding by lack of this revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us so much mockery so much divisions because the people like that revelation they lack that revelation the teachers he didn't say in revelation making divisions he has seen lack of revelation what revelation the lack of the revelation of jesus christ because if you understand it's the revelation of jesus christ then no man will want to rule over no other man come on now the fight for ministries that a permanent post is till we all come come on now to the unity of the faith to the knowledge of the son of god unto our perfect man give the lord some praises you take a little small glass of ocean water you have the same contents as the whole small piece big piece god have different offices and roll like elijah said when he passed you giggling better than jericho he said what do you want he said double portion he said that's a hard thing my god he said that's a big thing that guy had faith that i had courage he pressed after being told stay here stay here you belong here put sit down here he said no i see something that's when a man have a revelation not even the prophet could stop him come on now see elijah didn't give elisha revelation it was the lord it was the father [Applause] did you get that you may be seated that is the prophet elijah the prophet says stay here jericho he said no no a next obedient denominational group thinking believer city prophet tell me say some of them steal away the prophet tell them [Applause] but that man you see you see you see thinking about it the lord told elijah what to do show the mountain pull it off give him a taste to pull the fire and pull it off because when you pull it off it put a deep to call to a deep [Applause] you see he had to grow into his passion he had to grow into his desire he had to grow [Applause] so you have to grow into the mantra so first thing like just drop them out and pull it off and walk away like you do nothing because you like the season drop it and pull it off wait wait wait wait go on where are you going afterwards just had a twist in your life and like you're saying you're crazy husband can satisfy that man can satisfy that woman cast wife husband children brother money house car it's a long and it's a deep calling to a deep you don't know you're hungry in the morning you're hungry not for food [Applause] you're twisting for god oh it's a joy to preach to you because the bible said the love of many will watch coal but i feel the love waxing warm your love for christ because of inequity the love of many the servants are going harder and colder and giant people just shaking their head and god god wants you to boil amen don't want you to boil glory what what about hallelujah that's what god wants you to do [Applause] i'm in the droid come back you know bring back the joy david said i was glad when they said unto me bring back the joy the joy of the lord is my strength when you have a love for god the soul of god to service people oh glory to god the love of god breaking upon your soul [Applause] it's too short to have oughts it's too late to have grudges it will short the whole enmity against people and despising this one why are you saying number over is here the kingdom have room for your enemies too [Applause] the political son big brother your big brother thought he alone was getting everything you know when a younger brother come and the father killed the fatted calf and given the ring i gave him the robe he outside you don't want to communicate in a fight man had no revelation pure intellectual father telling but son but but everything i have is yours [Applause] i don't call you getting on so far [Applause] one ring one robe and a cocoa come on you could do better than that you can pick any one fatted one medium-sized one slim one tin one but this my son was lost yet there is room this my son was sick oh tell somebody jerry's room uh [Applause] so i don't care if your daughter wearing mini skirt there is room i will give you some smoking cigarettes there is room [Applause] here where there is no room there is no room for you to see you're coming now you're not seeing the light no it's no room for that it's not room for you to make style in them so look at you know look at you know it's just long time for 20 years i'm just waiting on you that's what you have to do i have no room for that you have to be like god let us let the sun just shine on them let your blessing fall upon them all glory let your grace move out towards them let your grace reach unto them oh glory to god they can't stop you they can't touch you because there is no fear in love nothing could hurt you when you're walking in that kind of love nothing to touch you come on now it's supernatural it's heavenly [Applause] daughter cousin aunt auntie mommy daddy who also and wife whoever it is when they get in trouble you have to understand there is room that's why that's why the door is shut yet that's why the anointing is strike home yet because there is room that mocking means i want to put them back come on glory right now some of you being mocked by god the reward comes after put the seal put the mark watch the holy ghost alone is the only revealer of the divine revelation of christ notice he didn't say the fivefold notice he didn't say apostle or prophet or teacher or pastor or evangelist he said the holy ghost alone even if the prophet preaches it will be the holy ghost alone [Applause] if the prophet come here and preach this morning it will take the holy ghost to reveal what is being spoken so do you understand is the holy ghost alone the holy ghost alone is a revealer of the divine revelation of jesus christ has been in all ages who does the word come to the prophet that is right and the prophet had to be vindicated first not because he said he was a prophet because he was born a prophet proved to be a prophet and everything he said was exactly on the word and come to pass then men of all move by the holy ghost look gender baptists would have never known jesus if it hadn't been for the holy ghost pointing him out upon whom you see the dove descending that's the one john could never know it except the holy ghost reveal it to him look him there that's the messiah listen close now i want you not to fail to get this no other church no other sign no other fellowship no other government no other testimony no other creed no the nomination is accepted outside of this god accepts nothing else but christ in you the hope of glory the only thing that god recognizes amen no fellowship no church no creed no denomination no nothing everything else is dead it is fragments that has to be cut off off that christ might live with preeminences in you you said it's my organization that's got to be cut off too i got so and so in there this is my mother tell me i'm a holy roller that's got to be cut off too my husband want me to wear these shorts that i have to be cut off too it's got to be cut off and pruned till it's you and christ alone where does your friend come in now and is that person really a friend or is it the devil with a mask of a friend face that person that influence in your life they influence your life positively or negatively they influence you the right way or the wrong way is that really your friend jesus is a good friend [Applause] and he has love the kind of love that he has rebuked you see as many as i love i rebuke and chase them he's alas therefore repent oh hallelujah that's the kind of friend you want to have a friend that will correct you a friend not rebuke you a friend i tell you when you're going wrong don't encourage you and wrong but say no no no no no no no that's not the way we are going remember think of it that people born of the spirit in this day in this great denominational age that we live in that's why we can be a paradox you know got everybody connected to this beast system and image system so who are you nobody your son or son remember what jesus encountered he encountered pharisees sadducees herodian scribes he counted all of these people he was a solo then john the baptist was sold before him talking about this one son among you here come jesus cutting the crowd in multitudes he's been popular even the sick racing is dead he's the the pharisees and scribes that they can fight they have those who want them to rebel and fight rome and jesus had to tell him well listen fellas my kingdom is out of this world so put on your swords and behave yourself we talk and talk in the front contain all joy when you enter the diver translations and trials forget rome we have a next kingdom coming isn't that right so jesus is doing what now he's bringing and introducing a new thought into the whole system of things because this is all new this shake in the system it's rocking the fire race pharisees rocking these scribes what are you introducing a new boot you must be born again your life have to change you can't continue as you are you are hate or either truth but i say unto you love your enemies try to jam the mind interfere with the thoughts jam the processes of of of generations of law study introduced grace they find a woman in a doctor and said this woman caught in the very act and moses law same stone he said yes donor if you have no sin and all them have excuses to go but yet there is room jesus said who where are the accusers come on say him and somebody he said woman go and sin no more just go into the kingdom come unto the lord give the lord a shout in the house this is jesus flipping things turning things upside down shaking up the community shaking up the system [Applause] i want them trying to squeeze them he said my always not yet come they can't touch me they can't touch me they can't touch me because my heart has not yet come [Applause] glory to god when you're overcome when you overcome me say my always come watch more shall i say oh hallelujah hallelujah and when you're overcome the devil can't stop it when you're over healing come you're all british you'll come you're all deliverance come and i believe it's here now today but i believe your all has come though devil can stop when your hour has come oh let me finish off here now [Applause] god vindicating in your life he said something that you cannot do proven himself it's not you it's him you become a love slave to him to be bride hallelujah almost done his presence in the individual only in an individual never in a group an individual not in a group who said that the prophet said that who could speak contrary to that we challenge that not a group hallelujah it's with the individual that means no man could stop you from receiving your portion today you didn't get that you did not get that oh glory you see brother branham and discernment on the platform people are coming up there he's praying for them and all of a sudden pillow fire move he said that woman across there god i'm hanging over there you you're sick with someone so your name is so and so jesus christ just healed you she didn't have a prayer card she didn't have a card to line up with the group she only had faith her faith hit god god hit the prophet the prophet had [Applause] [Applause] what about the woman with the dead baby in mexico they wanted a barrier baby she heard about the next child that raised from the dead she said no not this baby she gone to the big convention how much thousands and thousands of people aren't she coming through but she dead baby she's coming through she passing through legs she pushing through the ushers she's diving on top the deacons they couldn't hold her back ruxin that's a mother that is desperate she doesn't want that she want the life of that child come back the prophet tells somebody she don't know who i am go and somebody pray for her that wasn't stopping her she probably said something on that platform there i have to get there as you're moving through crowd didn't matter numbers didn't matter moving through that's the attitude you have to get you come today to move through to get something from the lord all of a sudden what about i'm on the prayer line you see a baby smiling he said wait a minute that's the woman let her come what happened she touched helen and hit the emergency line [Applause] when you hit the emergency line a red light does show up in heaven [Applause] the blue light is when you're taking it cool but when you're desperate it's a red light angels assemble they say i see that red light emergency downstairs oh hallelujah let's activate that red light this morning glory don't get me blue take him in blue don't give me blue [Applause] his identification with an individual watch not with the methodists not with the baptist not for the presbyterian not with the lutheran not in the pentecostal with the individual i'll take one and leave one not i'll take one group and leave one group amen i'll take one and leave one it's not a group not say my church no my church has nothing to do with it so when you hear people go with my church forget it that's saying like my catholic church or my methodist church what on earth does that have to do with god blah blah blah woman do you believe in jesus christ i have you to know i burn three candles at night he said what on earth that have to do with anything with jesus christ but the church teller burn three candles say to our father and three hailey mary as long as the church is god she could yeah but god is the word sorry sorry god is not church god is the word god is not any message god is the word hear me brangham tabernacle says apply your token or perish [Applause] here we go this is the part i wanted to get to not say my church my church has nothing to do with it it's an individual one person are you ready all hell is against this teaching [Applause] hello mind with peace group hello my representation right there wrong hello mind that sit and say come on now you just like the mother church too but when it comes to the individual oh hell is against that because when you come as an individual you cannot be received because you are moving by revelation say revelation tell somebody i'm moving my revelation tell somebody that [Music] [Applause] dead is the revelation not them but him an individual not a group all hell is against it but this mystery his mystery is going to reveal to his beloved bride i'm closing why i'm against oh my religion that's the reason i spoke against the church the lodge i quote i can't call it a church but abraham there's only one church and that church is the body of christ but these lodges that called church my bible tells me that they are blasphemous names all of them all organizations what they are blaspheming blasphemy is to be contrary to or speak against against when god said come be born they say come join all right all right come and be a jehovah witness come and be a methodist come over your pentecostal come and join and jesus messes with you must be born again you didn't join your family your mother built you that's why you have the name that you have you didn't come up on them but could i join the williams family the jones family permission please to join nobody did that you were born therefore you can't join god's family come on now [Applause] you got to be born of god born that's good [Applause] watch this is so powerful he said when the baptism of the spirit is force he took for a wafer in the catholic church a handshake in the protestant church in the caricature is a way for hold that potential in church take that same thing mother of wafer daughter have shake hands listen to this when the baptism of the spirit is forced she took over away from the catholic church a handshake in the protestant church emotion in the pentecostal church instead of the person of christ here we go coming in with all that pyramid building that we had after your faith virtue and so forth and godliness and purity and holiness and then you are sealed by the holy ghost so what he is saying getting into the pyramid is getting into the church that's the body of christ not this building here oh hallelujah oh glory to god what is it we're in exodus the first exodus was a natural land to natural land the second exodus from a spiritual condition into a spiritual baptismal holy ghost no he's bringing him from a spiritual back in holy ghost to the land of the millennium hallelujah this is the last quote i believe yes last quote here wow so we find out our messages today the message we have is come out of babylon and be free be filled with the spirit you're lamb streamed and clear look up your redemption draw it near and yet in the midst of all of that we don't have nothing against those people totally not national people they're all right they're fine they are associated in the gospel because jesus said no man can come except the father draws him we were only responsible for sowing seeds some fell by the wayside some fell on different grounds we just sow in seeds may the lord bless you let's stand alone we're singing a song and you get the next portion and then we're going to have some time of prayer praise the lord amen oh blessed be the name of the lord we appreciate the lord this morning we appreciate pastor teo awful it's over this morning yet there is room oh hallelujah why don't you turn around brother greet your sister this morning hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Music] are you in the church triumphant whoa are you in the savior's breath come and be papa have you been baptized into the body baptized with the holy ghost and baptized with the holy ghost oh there is but one way there is but one way to enter in it just as they did just [Applause] for are you in the safest round come and be baptized into the body and forevermore abide for the last time whoa are you in the church triumphant in the savior's bride come and be baptized into the body oh and forever can we give the lord a hand of praise this morning you appreciate the lord this morning you appreciate our pastor this morning amen amen amen you may be seated for a few minutes i'm not going to be long with you at all we do have a prayer line right after this but i do want to make some announcements once again what can we say about our pastor i really want to salute him for his burden for his labor and what can we say about brother anthony with his exhortation last week lessons from the pool of bethesda remember it spoke and left no man deceive you and it's been every service going higher and higher and higher it's good to be in the house of god in a few hours as beloved said that around 4 p.m we are supposed to be in the airport so it just keeps going higher and higher and higher and higher amen so but god is good and uh so for this week we will have service on tuesday in maraval so we encourage you to make uh the effort to be there and then this weekend we have service on friday at 5 00 pm and sunday morning at 8 00 am but the waldron and his church should be here with us as well so we earned expectations with god to do great things and you know on this palm sunday we remember when jesus ruled into jerusalem the city of peace and caused a disturbance you know he came against what was expected and there was eruption you know people woke up that morning thinking it was just like any other morning and then they had to hear all kind of noise and i don't know how many people were there when it started but the noise just started to build and build until it's had to pull out palms and i don't know if they ever did that before so it was not just that jesus came into jerusalem but people found themselves doing things they had never done before and i feel that the season we are in right now we are doing what we have never done before what happened last week sunday we never did before what's happening today we never did before why because jesus is riding into jerusalem jesus is coming to see his people he has something for you this morning and i believe that this service it's a deliverance service it's a prayer line and i believe the message has already gone forth i don't think i have to preach anything to you but i just want to encourage your fate because i believe that god is not going to leave you empty today and i believe if you came in here this morning with sickness with affliction with mind problems you came in this morning and you were back sitting you are struggling there is no reason for you to leave the same way you came this morning if you came with desperation to receive the baptism of the holy ghost there is no reason that you cannot leave with the baptism of the holy ghost because in acts 19 when paul laid hands on them they didn't know about the holy ghost but when he laid hands on them they were filled with the holy ghost so we are on the word this morning to lay hands on the sick and see them recover we are in the word this morning to lay hands on those who won the holy ghost and see the holy ghost pour out we are on the word this morning because the time is here for you to receive your promise come the church say amen so i am so excited this morning just before we read the scripture let's just sing a song and f pass me not pass me not oh do not pass me by one more time with your hands lifted from your heart now make it your prayer right now pass me nuts oh gentle savior today today is your day for [Music] deliverance hallelujah [Music] he's calling somebody this morning he's calling somebody this morning to not pass blessed savior all over the building let's just sing say save y'all [Applause] [Music] oh you're calling me this morning to not pass [Music] just say that do not pass me one more time to not pass that's my present day lord not pass me [Music] can we bow our heads in a word of friend heavenly father as we approach this second part of the service and prepare for the prayer line lord lord as i look all through the building today we see people lord who have come with needs all kinds of needs father and lord you are the god who could meet needs lord they haven't come to hear from me they haven't come to hear from a man but they come to be ministered to by the angel of the lord the angel of the covenant the holy ghost himself lord and i believe lord that lord the atmosphere is right for the miraculous to take place today lord for the next few minutes father may you take my thoughts out completely and may you speak lip to ear to your children lord they are your people father use me as your instrument this morning of knowing the ministers and the elders father for the prayer line annoying the people today lord that today would be a day of breakthrough a day of release a day of deliverance if there's any sinners in the house today may they repent today lord and ask to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ if there's any backsliders in the house this morning father called me the lord the angel of the lord convict them today lord that they will look no more back but they would look forward unto calvary father may you break every chain break every shackle house of hell give way to the name of jesus christ we serve notice today for every sickness every disease mind battle frustration demons of lust demons of alcohol demons of whatever it is filth and ungodliness we serve notice this morning in the name of jesus christ and satan you are finished this morning among these people these are the sons and daughters of the living god almighty god may you move through the camp may you stir every heart may you stir your people this morning may you bless the reading of the word and may you get glory in the precious name of jesus christ we pray and the church says and the church says amen thank you musicians can we just go to two portions of scripture reading from the book of saint luke chapter 4 and reading from verse 14 and reading from revelation chapter 10 reading one verse there verse 7. reading sing luke chapter 4 reading verse 14 and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region roundabout and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah's and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the broken hearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight of the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and i want to go on to two more verses and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and reading from the book of revelation chapter 10 and reading 1 verse 4 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated for a few minutes just to encourage you before the prayer line this morning so for a title this morning the mystery of god and my inspiration this day this scripture is fulfilled you remember though it would really bless me and as he was speaking he was speaking about christ and it's all about christ and in the message with the brandon preach christ is the mystery of god revealed he said now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how it's unfolding itself right down to this present hour that we're living then you'll understand clearly then i believe what is being done and but abraham goes on to say now a scholar could read the bible the word till he can just tie your mind up in any way if he wants to do it because he is smart brilliant get a catholic priest or not so much as that as a real good trained theologian in the bible brother a baptist or a presbyterian or something he'll make you think you don't know nothing when it comes to talk see because he has known him in the flesh but ibrahim said and he passed his bible but the only way you are saved is by know him by revelation but the random goes on he said i can take the presbyterian doctrine and tie you pentecostals till you won't know i can take the baptist doctrine and show you pentecostals a million things you know nothing else that's right but that's not it that's not his church that's not his church his church is himself revealed and expressed by the word now i'm going somewhere we're talking about the mystery of god now this world is full of mysteries this very world itself is a mystery to this day scientists are still trying to figure out some of the mysteries in this world everything that cannot be explained is a mystery but iran said a mystery is something that was previously hit but is now divinely revealed god was a mystery but he wanted to express himself he was bigger than everything powerful than everything he was everything itself but he had to find a way to express the magnitude of this mystery books can't write enough about it movies can be made about it you can build buildings because it's too great of a [Applause] the mystery was so big that god took centuries and centuries and piece by piece he was trying to get this mystery out to people because he didn't want to be complicated he didn't want to be misunderstood he didn't want to be unapproachable he wanted to be approached he wanted anybody to talk to him but when he was all by himself there was nobody to talk to him so he had to find a way to take this mystery the mystery of god and bring it into simplicity are you with me this morning [Applause] you may be seated brother branham said when david was living and when abraham was living and when moses was living but the branham said they had no idea what they were living out let me say that again god spoke to moses and moses went and did what he did but he still had no idea what he was doing i gotta say that again david as a shepherd god spoke to him god called him and when david died he died not even knowing what he was about because brother branham said david was just a shadow revealing the mystery so david as a shepherd he was not just a shepherd but there was a great shepherd that was coming and moses and david rather was that little mystery being spoke about just the shepherd attribute of god's nature god as a deliverer he couldn't just express all of that so he found moses and said moses you are going to express this mystery of deliverance that i have david you are going to express the shepherd that i am joshua you're going to express the warrior that i am somebody preached to me elijah you will express the prophet that i am come on now somebody with me daniel you will express the scribe that i am paul you will express the apostle that i am but everyone was expressing a part of the mystery of [Applause] god may be seated [Applause] so i want to say something there's a difference when it's part of the mystery and it's the fullness of the mystery so up until the old testament all of the scriptures compounded it was just part part part but when jesus stepped out it was not part of the mystery because jesus christ was the mystery of god revealed in his fullness [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] we are going somewhere this morning so you are here this morning and that's why sometimes young people sometimes it feels like your life is so confusing and it's so mysterious because you haven't seen the fullness of the mystery of who you are because brother branham said the mystery of who you are is also a secret because you are part of god that mystery gene you also carry that mystery dream so when you were saved that is only part of the mystery when you are here this morning that's only part of the mystery when you are filled with the holy ghost that also is part of the mystery there's come in a time when you will manifest the fullness of the mystery of who you are and when people see you it will be christ in you the hope of glory because christ is the mystery of god revealed [Applause] you may be seated oh somebody say man so what are we here to do this morning we are here to give you a snapshot into who you really are we are here for revelation because only revelation could show you who you are the pastor cannot show you who you are the minister cannot show you who you are but if you get a revelation because a mystery is something that was previously hid but now divinely revealed so we are looking for divine revelation so that when you walk through the prayer line you are just not just going through a prayer line but you are coming with divine revelation that you are an attribute son of god attribute daughter of god you may be seated you might be living in sin that's part of the mystery because you don't even know fully who you are you're not hearing me this morning you might be going through depression that's only part of the mystery because who you really are can be revealed just yet because god doesn't even want the devil to know who the bride is because he has to be a secret so all your situations all your past all your mistakes all of your ups and downs it's all a great mystery that god created to allow you to happen something on the inside that nobody could see but one of these days you will be able to see this day this scripture is fulfilled [Applause] [Applause] i'm not going to be much longer with you hallelujah when you wake up to go to work that's a part of the mystery you are living out something when you pay the bills that's just part of the mystery because you gotta have a roof over your head you gotta eat but that's not who you really are there's a mystery behind that flesh man there's a mystery behind your mind there's a mystery inside of your soul and that's why the planet said you are not even the believer but the word in you is the believer so you didn't come here this morning but the seed in you is fighting to express himself [Applause] david couldn't explain why he acted that way and we preach it a while back and after all of his mistakes god still said that's a man after my own heart because david was expressing attributes that were part of god so even in your up and down you are expressing attributes that are part of god because you are from the same genetic structure as your father and no devil in hell could stop it that's why we can see this morning you are going to be healed you are going to get the holy ghost you are going to be your top 10 you are going to be manifested sons of god [Applause] hallelujah i'm not going to be too much longer with you but the man i said what is it the mystery of god then he says it here is god in you the hope of glory shining forth the baptism of the holy ghost he said when these things take place time shall be no more so when we hear about time shall be no more god is just waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god waiting for this season when you will come to full realization of who you are [Applause] now let me drop something in there jesus is born he's growing up working with his father he's with his family they think he's all normal no wonder when jesus is going around they say is this not joseph's son because they knew joseph's son but what jesus was displaying was a little different from what joseph's son was you don't hear me this morning jesus wasn't in church that day for the first time he was in the synagogue the bible says as was his custom so he was always in church but they never really paid attention to him because he was just walking like everybody is shaking everybody's hands and doing everything else like everybody else it was his custom he was always in church but that day was different [Applause] that day was different and i believe this day is different there's somebody this morning who's going to get a revelation of who god is who they are who the devil is and realize that that demon of cancer that demon of arthritis that demon of female condition that demon of high blood pressure low blood pressure high sugar low sugar mind battle that demon has got to go because there is no legal right for that demon to be in your body that sin that condemnation that lost that unbelief that has got to go because you are realizing who you are and when the devil asks you a question you can look the devil in the face and see if this day this scripture is fulfilled [Applause] you may be seated hallelujah brother branham said it like this he said every scripture in the old testament was pointing to jesus christ and i'll give you another example when isaiah said a virgin shall conceive that was scripture that was word it was spoken but it had to wait until the body came for that scripture to be manifested so people could look at it as scripture but when god opened the book he wasn't seeing scripture he was seeing names i don't think you got me but the brandon said god is coming for the book the book of redemption he said it's a book of names [Applause] we see the book as scripture and god is seeing the book as names so when isaiah say a virgin shall conceive that's in your book in his book he see in mary it's a book of names and he's coming for the book of names when the book said a voice of one crying in the wilderness that's in your book but in his book that's john but the branham shared when the bible says the people that know their god shall do exploits that's in your book but in his book he's he and george kangali he is seeing joshua he is seeing gideon he is seeing your name and he's coming for your names hallelujah hallelujah glory to god that's a revelation to you church it's not just words it's your name the words in the book you are not the believer of the word in you as a believer you are gonna be filled you are gonna receive the holy ghost i don't care what the devil tells you he's coming for you you haven't seen it for a moment you may be seeing it for a moment hallelujah for the backsliders in here this morning the book said in joel that in the last day i'll poured my spirit upon all flesh that's the words in the book peter came and said this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel so peter what was the words in the book i want to make mention of something friends peter didn't know he was the word in the book when peter was denying christ he was still the words in the book you don't hear what i'm saying peter said he made mistakes peter said i don't know this jesus but jesus wasn't looking at that it's the word in the book it was going to take some time for peter to get a revelation a divine revelation of the mystery of who he was but what he did didn't change his name in the book [Applause] everybody should be on their feet everybody should be shouting your mistakes your past your failures what they say about you doesn't change the words in the book hallelujah so when my bible tells me there'll be a manifestation of the sons of god to god that's not words he is seeing you coming out to your condition coming out of your depression coming out of the world coming out of sin coming out of your past and being adopted being perfected can the church say man hallelujah you could be gonna play something softly as the deacons we're going to get ready for the prayer line i don't think not much more needs to be said friends god is here but it depends on yawning but the brandon said the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass what's your attitude this morning did you just come because it's a service or a special service so did you come because you realize that the needs in your life are more than you could be the needs in your life could only be fixed by god himself you have to come to that awareness you have to come to that conclusion you have to come to that position yourself i'm not talking to groups but over it made it clear it's study individual so if your brother doesn't want it your father doesn't want it your wife doesn't want it you got to know why you are coming into the prayer line today you have to know what your need is you have to know what you are struggling with and you have to come knowing that god is able to heal you to deliver you he promised to restore you he promised good health he said if my people will humble themselves and pray seek my face and turn from their wicked ways they will hear from heaven i will heal their land that scripture is just as real today as when it was first written and when god says my people that's words to people who read it on the outside but to god he is seeing you being reconciled to himself part of this great mystery of god i believe there are sons in here this morning there are daughters in here this morning you have not been living right you come through this line with true repentance with a contrite heart with a desire to not go back and do what you did before but the brandon said repentance is not just saying i'm sorry it's a turn away from what you used to do that desire must be real in your heart he promised to put a mark upon all those who sigh and cry for the abomination in the city when you come through this line this morning god give us a sigh give us a cry let it not be just for a show let it not just be just for an occasion but let it be for a reality god i cannot live anymore without a personal experience with the holy ghost itself i don't want to face tonight i don't want to face tomorrow i don't want to face my boss i don't want to face my job i don't want to face my wife i don't want to face my husband i don't want to face life without a personal experience with god i'm not talking about coming to church signing up for church i'm talking about being identified by christ in you the hope of glory revelation and experience and encounter with god fire in your soul to burn out all the sin to burn out the lust to burn out david cried out he said lord restore unto me it's a joy of my salvation i haven't lost my salvation but god i lost the joy my prayer life is not what it's supposed to be lord i've not been spending time on you i've been so caught up in my own world and my own things and my own desires i've completely lost myself but this morning god i'm coming back home it's a homecoming service may we be like the prodigal son this morning and come to our senses the bible said he came to his senses me each one of us i'm including myself in their this morning friends god i want to come to my senses i want a closer walk i want a real walk with you i just want to be a church member but i want an experience in my soul i don't want to know god from hearing what other people said but i want to know him for myself for myself can we bow our hands on a word of prayer see let's get ready for the prayer line can we bow our heads heavenly fathers we approach your throne of grace lord we pray you forgive our sins forgive our past lord where we have fallen when we have made mistakes lord the things that we are supposed to do that we have not done lord we repent things that we have done that we should not do lord we repent this morning lord we lay our lives down at your feet we prostrate our lives before your august presence this morning it's only true blood we could be here this
