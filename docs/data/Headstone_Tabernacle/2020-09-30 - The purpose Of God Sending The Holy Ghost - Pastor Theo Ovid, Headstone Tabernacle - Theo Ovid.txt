rain down i trust that's your desire tonight that's your prayer tonight that the holy spirit would rain down go praise the lord so god bless you it's a privilege to be here tonight to be one more time in the presence of god and to share with you the word of god amen praise the lord so tonight we want to go to the scriptures we want to read two portion scriptures tonight from sin john chapter 14 verse 14 to 26 and luke chapter 16 1 verse 8 verse 16. it's in john chapter 14 reading verse 14. if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father this is jesus talking and he will give you another comforter so referencing another comforter because he himself being among them he was a comforter with them but he's talking about another comforter so he was the word and he's prophet sign of the spirit i shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive this is not the spirit of error now it's not a spirit of lies it's spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not you don't know with him but he know it you you know him for he dwelleth with you shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while the world sees me no more but you see me because i live he shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and hear me and i knew so he's saying to them you don't know that now but at that day you will know this verse 21 he didn't have my commandments and keepeth them he is that love at me he that loved me shall be loved of my father and i will love him i will manifest myself to him and judah said unto him not a scare at lord how is it the tower it manifests thyself unto us and not unto the world answer jesus answered and said unto him if a man loves me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and we'll make our board with him he that loveth may not keep it not my sins and the word which he hear is not mine but the father which sent me these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you but but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name send operating word whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatever since that time the kingdom of god is preached on every man will you speak to them take me out of that peter was con responsible for what he shared by words to cornelius house but lord he was not responsible for the moving of the spirit and the dynamic operation of the holy spirit that fell on cornelius and the gathering at cornelius home because the scripture declared while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell upon them that heard the word it was such a shocking thing to peter and the other jews with him they were astonished that the holy ghost itself was being poured out upon the gentiles just as they had had it in the upper room and it was an astonishing thing for them to see it so peter wasn't in charge of opening that pipe of the spirit you are in charge of that lord and we pray that you would come down tonight and open up in the people's hearts and lies right in their homes the fire of god the healing virtue of christ the deliverance lord the witness of your spirit the power of god even right now while we are praying may the dove sweep into every home every heart every life lord and bring that victory to them lord oh god we are depending on you tonight uh our words will fail lord but your words can feel and we believe that we are moving to that cycle father of the spirit uh having the preeminences of the spirit having the oversight for your deepest desire is to see your sons in such a position that you can say there is my spirit flowing freely no hidden agenda no politics no unclean spirit no crooked life just a channel of god that you can flow freely father god may you find such a place the night in our hearts where you're knocking all the doors and you are available to every crevice in our lives that with the freedom of spirit lord the liberty and of god that the word could be operational tonight lord in jesus name we ask it amen and amen okay so tonight i have a title the purpose of god sent in the holy ghost that's the title tonight the purpose of god said in the holy ghost i have an inspiration every man must press every man must press i like to always find things that we are responsible for you know like how the bible says the secret thing belongs to god where things that are revealed belong to us isn't that right so secrets god in charge of that but what belong to us belongs to us what is has been revealed amen now uh let's let's go see what the law will do tonight now have you ever seen have you ever seen this you see in our churches today even the groups where we have separated ourselves and make organization we see all of this and you've seen a man here we go pick up a certain scripture and brother that man can take that scripture and make it live new make it live just exactly what is promising in the bible and the next man will see him do it and he will come along and try to do it and fail i hope you're reading now he'll feel why the scripture is not inspired to him he's only trying to impersonate he's trying to act like something watch he said no watch but what about the church what kind of messiah is the church looking for today the church has been crying the loudest we're holding about a messiah we are looking revival no time what are they looking for to do it what more do you want what does the church want anyhow we already got it god give it to us it's his promise for this hour we look in the bible we see it everywhere through the bible anointed ones come on and make that word live again listen to it anointed ones if it's not anointed how could it really live it will take the atmosphere the presence the power the anointing to make that word live dry dead cold formal no life coming to that it has to be the breath of god so here it is now anointed ones come on and make that word live again right in the hour for that over now we have got the messiah this is him the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and the word remains god the same yesterday therefore we are wanting a messiah and god give us the messiah what's the messiah his promise word for this day it's just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again o praise the name of the lord so i want to encourage you tonight that all we have need of is in the message of the hour is in the books is in the tapes but it takes fear to anoint every divine promise and you have to claim it for yourself isn't that right so you said he says no martin luther mechanics and dynamics of this day john wesley had them pentecostal had them of their day what about our day this is another time the church should be fully grown now ready to meet christ with the manifestation of every blessing that he promised in the bible operating in that one great body where he promised he would meet the people and be worshiped in this great church of his oh blessed be the name of the lord do we believe that tonight that the church should be fully grown ready to meet christ with what with books and tapes no with the manifestation of every blessing that he promised in the bible operating in that one great body where he promised he would meet the believer the people and be worshiped o praise god so god's purpose of sending the holy spirit is one purpose one purpose that god himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church and that's why the holy spirit told the prophet pick up the pen and write by and through the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised isn't that right that god was in christ continuous plans through christ out of christ into the church continuing his work through the church all god was he coming to christ all that christ was he poured into the church what is it god working in you anywhere in the world that he would want to call on you working in you to do his good will oh we ought to thank god for that thank god the holy spirit is sent for the purpose of god living in his church moving through each age isn't that right he was lifted up between the heaven and earth died and redeemed everything and in bleeding hallelujah he sanctified a church that he himself might live in not come to church now his blood is what sanctified the church because he could only come to a sanctified life oh glory to god and that's why it was so powerful the testimony of cornelius he was just and devout and amanda was praying always he don't know about jesus hallelujah he don't know what's going to unfold but the god was so pleased with his prayer and his testimony that god sent visitation of an angel to tell him to send for peter because peter was part of this body of christ this operational functional book of acts this channel of god that life could come out the mouth of peter oh glory to god and peter on new grounds was challenged to rise and kill and eat and he was challenged to go to these gentiles called to minister to the gentiles oh glory to god and all peter was to do was to give a witness and testimony by word of what happened and why he was given testimony while he was speaking while he was witnessing what he saw what he experienced the spirit bore witness oh glory to god and once more the spirit will return and is returning and has returned to be a witness the bible said the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word not a hope this is a blessing to you not that confirming the word with signs following or give the lord a shout in the house supernatural power supernatural vindication supernatural presence all glory to god people have to they they're afraid of the supernatural but something supernatural have to happen to you oh glory to god there's not no morse back church member sitting here and hearing intellectual in your head something has to happen to you is not you stop smoking stop drinking stop doing this it's the operation of god that operated supernaturally that takes the desire for the smoke take the desire to lust take the desire to live all kind of crazy life god working in your life oh hallelujah praise god so he was lifted up between heaven died and redeemed everything and then bleeding he sanctified a church that he himself might live in and fellowship and commune with that lost spot of fellowship from the garden of eden where god came down in the cool of the evening and i could see why god leave these lastly sons to receive the full revelation of the mystery of god that he could fully commune with them and have fellowship with them what a privilege to be in this hour it's crazy outside the dear it is crazy and it'll get crazier but we are blessed and privileged because many wise men and prophets long to be in such a time as this when the birth hallelujah when the sons of god will be born into manifestation oh this is great tonight hallelujah just a thought of it just thinking about it that sons of god will be born into manifestation oh glory to god and they're going to scorch the earth with the power and the supernatural presence of the jesus christ hallelujah once more the world will hear direct from god they have to hear oh glory to god because we are under a messenger of the age hallelujah he brought light to us hallelujah that we could walk in that light and manifest that supernatural light do we believe that tonight that's the purpose of the holy ghost is the father again god the father dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his plan of redemption working through you making you a co-worker with him giving you a place giving you a pact for your ford lost brother so there is not just a sit down in church and warm a bench no this is giving you a pact for your full lost brother because one day the last name gonna be called into that book from the book will be called and redeemed and that redeem is unfair all the way to charity redeemed then the book is closed not one more to be saved oh glory to god the book is finished and then god go across to the jews hallelujah praise god giving you a path for your fallen brother just imagine that we have a path still to play oh glory to god to go after the loss not eternal loss but go after your fallen brother those that backslidden those that lost their way all glory have got to go after and says they come back the spirit and the bride say come oh glory to god the spirit is here and the bride is here the spirit and the bride has come they come oh glory to god giving you a path making you a co-worker with him giving you a place giving you a path for your fallen lost brother and sister giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the loss as he did in the garden of eden not saying this one is shock this one finished let's laugh at that always after that all you say is one fish i guess i guess when they saw saul persecute the christian they say finish finish hallelujah let the church members say what they want god going and change that man oh glory to god nobody didn't put your name in the book and they can't take it out oh give the lord a shout that's why we are free this night hallelujah praise god giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the gather eden adam that's what the holy ghost does to a man or woman when it strikes the heart and takes it aboard there's a thirst and hungering for lost souls and then here we go then as soon as he gets his church and speaking conditions speaking conditions when you could speak and he could speak back then you qualify to access god i have heard your prayer i have heard your cry oh glory god speaking conditions not a one waiting where god talking and behind the pulpit you're hearing word word word not that speaking conditions is mean you're back almost like back to eden where god could talk to you and you could talk back to him where the spirit is dear the bible said jesus said you are not a comforter and he will bring things to your remembrance what i have spoken unto you oh glory to god you're with me like a fool praise god you will get back the same word that was spoken before it will come back again i'll ride the trail once more oh glory to god he will bring it back to remembrance hallelujah because god can't change his word he subject his own self to his word o blessed be name of the lord as soon as the church gets his church and his speaking conditions get his church to a place where he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship then there will come an eden so where does that put all the legalists down where he want to get the spirit that he could flow and love and persuade that's the spirit of god brooding hallelujah that he's not thou shalt not indulge that law get look up long time god after they couldn't obey the law that's why you make a new covenant oh glory to god you want your faith to be motivated by the love love for him love for the course love for his people oh glory to god hallelujah when that love is dear then you could step out on the limb then you could accept challenges because there's a love of god in your soul oh praise god so come back even he would take his church back we had left him back to eden again and watch days where we'll be taken back again and so on oh hallelujah praise god notice now god as the light begin to shine in the last days here we go he's expecting us he is expected so god has an expectation you know people don't wait in the lord reason lord listen to this he is expecting us a great thing from us oh glory to god hallelujah if you were here in the church i would tell you turn around and tell somebody he's expecting a great thing from us he's aggressive great thing from you he's expecting a great thing from you come on now another little thing you know a great thing oh glory to god if your mind don't hold that you're in trouble oh glory to god you know i was saying some of my wife are still nowhere you know there's a reason why god didn't show israel the shortcut to go into the promised land it's the reason why there was a shorter way i think 11 days or something they got to hit the land but god wanted to see if he could get them to change their minds because they came out of egypt but egypt didn't come out of them so it's one thing to come out of egypt is another thing to get egypt out of the people because he understood and knew how the human nature is as soon as pressure come they want to go back to the comfort zone they don't want to go beyond to see where they called to it is easy to rock back where they were before and even peter and the disciples found themselves in that position after three and a half years with jesus after doing miracles after seeing miracles after seeing power once jesus was no longer wrong they went back fishing to the original thing that they were in that was the easy thing for them to do and he told them i come to call you out of fishing for fish and make you a fisher of men that's what the calling was but those guys fell right back to their comfort zone right back to what they are custom with and it is easy to do that hallelujah it takes effort to press beyond where you are to where you're supposed to be hallelujah and they said the law and the prophets were until john and since that time the kingdom is preached and every man pressed their way into it hallelujah the kingdom itself have to be preached and you have to press your way you have to see yourself moving forward the press is to push hollywood to battle to fight not to sit back and relax to push yourself oh glory to god you don't want to just do and enter in you want to do better you want to do the very best oh glory the god is adored here and you have to bust past that door hallelujah press into the kingdom of god oh glory to god that woman with a blood issue that's what she was doing hallelujah there was a range that that the people was a wrong jesus but she had a need and that need made her push herself she ran out of money her husband tell her to go to that small church she had everything negative around her but she told herself if i could touch the hem of his garment i would be made whole oh glory to god she told herself something sometimes you have to talk to yourself sometimes you have to encourage yourself sometimes they look in the mirror and say listen you're not going are you supposed to go in you have to change your mind you have to change your thinking you have to press and did that woman press she pressed away oh glory to god everybody wrong jesus but she didn't have that kind of thing she didn't come to just hear him she wanted to get a touch she wanted to get an answer she wanted to get her healing she wanted to get to deliverance she was desperate oh glory to god are you desperate tonight because to get certain things from god you've got to be desperate watch he's expecting us a great thing from us because where there's much given there's much required so he is going to require much more of us than he did of the lutherans or the methodists because we walk in a greater light that's why i will reject deadness reject formality and reject the message spirit i got rejected the trinity spirit all of that be getting blasted and busted we want holy spirit oh glory to god and you have to jump out of your human spirit children that spirit whatever spirit i'm coming to the holy spirit there is one holy spirit if it in india africa wherever the holy spirit is one behavior going with it it's the old time holy spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me oh glory to god give me that old-time religion it's still all time isn't that right so he said no because we walk in a greater light with a greater power with a greater witness than they had we have a greater witness of the resurrection we have things more firmer than the hand all right hallelujah god doesn't deal with the church just as an organization he doesn't deal with the church as a group of people he deals with the church as individuals so the ministers who try to tell the group that la group is it he is lying to them and deceiving them because god is not dealing with the church as a group he is dealing with individuals in the group oh glory to god hallelujah just as the church can't hold the holy ghost as a group because the holy ghost is poured out on individuals that is why i believe tonight people in their homes could receive the holy ghost tonight not next week tonight because the holy ghost is poured out on individuals hallelujah and even while the world is going forward now you can receive the holy ghost the operation of god could come right in your home so he said watch he deals with the church as individuals each individual in the church so i care about dice less old man fool me i want to make sure it's the word of god is the promise of the hour i want to make sure that this what i'm seeing as a vision even the prophetic vision is the right one i don't want to wake up and say hey because he tells me that did i check it out myself did you switch it out to yourself i'm not explaining this i'm saying all them books and tapes is 50 plus years people have time to figure out what a man preaching if he's off the water or not oh glory to god he deals with the church as individuals each individual in the church and now it's got to our time here we go it's no secret we all see it when a man proves and god loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself dear in the front of angel he does something for him he lifts him up in the presence of god and gives him fills him and sets him out that's the age we are living in so we are living in the age where god could pull a man aside give him fill him and set him out that is the age we are living in the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans that sanctified the methodists that baptized the pentecostal is now set in an order the coming of the lord jesus when it will be so powerful this body will come into this group a church that will draw the rest of them from the grave there will be a resurrection that is what the holy ghost is for we know intellectual selves we know our message self and our talking self can't bring the resurrection it will take god himself is the resurrection power is what brought lazarus from the grace he said i am the resurrection and the life here say no man is that i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he dead he shall live isn't that right where have you laid him roll away the stone lazarus come forth lazarus come forth we know what that voice was that was the voice of the archangel and that voice have to be in a bride we understand that that is the voice of power that's the voice authority not even the dead could stay dead when that voice had to speak oh glory to god and what happened christ does all three the shout the voice and the trump the dead in christ shall rise jesus does all three the shout is already done oh glory to god through malachi 4 will the bride be that voice hallelujah praise god then that same jesus going to come and usher to a bride hallelujah because this church has to come to perfection in order to bring for the resurrection oh glory to god and there's going to be a resurrection this is the hope of the gospel this is the hope of us christians this is our hope that there is going to be a resurrection if a man dies shall we live again oh glory to god this is our hope that's how we preach that's why we say amen that's what we believe that there is going to be a resurrection but there's going to be a bride they're going to be changed and transformed in this last day change in a moment in a twinkling of an eye oh my hallelujah he said they live in one day he said he said that's what holds them for they'll be resurrection without us they cannot be made perfect now we need it the spirit of god is a standard what is it he was pouring in his spirit all this this go beyond texts and nice teachings and four hours of revelation and mysteries he's pouring in his spirit those who are resting yonder in the grave under the altar of god as the scripture say crying how long lord how long how much longer god is waiting you can imagine that on me on you i don't be waiting on god god is waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when god can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection and when the church and christ become so close together till christ become visible among us and raises the dead and we're going to rapture it is simple no complications the word was invisible until it became flesh and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and that was the invisible god become invisible so if this same word become flesh in a bride then the invisible god will be manifest once more just as they saw god manifested in that elijah in the fullness of signs and wonders hallelujah in that prophetic ministry of luke 17 30 god vindicated that elijah in the person of william branham with the fullness of signs and wonders that stunned the pentecostals that same god that same word that same prophecy hanging over your life if that word become flesh that invisible will become visible and when omnipotent speak the miraculous going to take place omnipotence is god veiled all glory that god and god have to be veiled then he's going to be unveiled he's going to be veiling a bride and he's going to unveil himself in that bride oh glory to god amen so i want to show you just those who are filled with the holy ghost goes in that rapture any minister any pastor say different they are lying they are lying prophets line seers lion preachers just the holy ghost filled go in the rapture not those who believe the message holy ghost phil not those who are books and pets holy ghost phil not those who play in books and tapes holy ghost phil not those who have the best preacher or the best teacher holy ghost phil not those who

phil only the wise virgin have the wisdom of revelation to know they have to get the holy ghost they have their extra oil oh glory to god hallelujah praise god the purpose of god sending the holy ghost he said behold i send the promise of my father upon you it was sent all glory to god the holy ghost was sent hallelujah god send it they don't want it that's okay we will take it we will take what they don't want but god send the holy ghost oh glory to god and he will give the holy ghost to those who obey him oh glory to god will give the holy ghost to them that ask him ask oh my those those who are filled with the holy ghost goes in that rapture i oh my aren't you glad tonight something in your heart talking lord i want the holy spirit i want you lord in my heart that's because god put your name in the lamb's book of life so because you are son you can be reborn because you are son you have a taste look at david davis has the heart panthers the water broke so my sword is after the living god king david david hungering for god david turson after righteousness he leaded me beside the still waters he restored my soul yeah do i walk to the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil oh glory to god david in the spirit he was a son hallelujah isn't that right and you are sons and daughters and says if i could only with my human voice placed into your heart the importance of receiving the baptism of the holy ghost it will be the most wonderful revelation you ever had in your life you must do it then you talk about let me make it clear about you are not converted and to give that example you talk about peter and peter he had given power to against unclean spirits he was sanctified and jesus said before the three times you deny me he said but i prayed for you and after you were converted then strengthen your brethren he had shouted he probably had danced in the spirit he had done all kinds of things but he hadn't received the holy ghost yet he said after you are converted then strengthen your brethren that's true to carry out his plan go into all the world and preach the gospel isn't that right not word only but through power and demonstrating of the holy ghost making the word of god manifest is the gospel oh glowing up teachings and revelations and mysteries no that is a seed of the gospel but the gospel has taken the same word hallelujah and making it manifest oh glory to god what's the first thing we read men could take the scripture and make it live hallelujah waiting for somebody to anoint it and make it live that somebody is you who glory to god god call you with faith in your heart to anoint what is promised to you oh hallelujah so jesus knew hallelujah that there would be a great intellectual move just like there was in his days washing pots and pans and wearing of clothes and turned around colors he said wait a minute i am not going to leave you comfortless i'm going to come again to you the works that i do shall you do also oh glory to god not the talk that i talk but the works that i do shall you do also the purpose of sending the holy ghost was for god to continue to a bunch of people to continually manifest god to the world yes people believe when we share scriptures when we share the word and god open up the eyes god is operating all that too but god's purpose is to manifest himself to show he is god he has no hands but your hands you have no eyes about your eyes he has no mouth but your mouth step forward brethren he want to use you or give the lord a shout make yourself available to him hallelujah the purpose of selling the holy ghost was for the god to continue through a bunch of people to continually manifest god to the world that's exactly not by a creed not by denomination but by the power of revelation how by making his word real by taking his promise like what we're doing tonight and standing on the cider mind of the minority and believe in god and watch the black skies roll back and the power of god moving and take over that is what he wants that is what the holy ghost will stand for that's the purpose he sent it to stay on the side of the minority and that's what he said when the church has grown him hallelujah under how the persecution of the outside world that the holy ghost is just as real as it was on the day of pentecost how they grown how they travail but when they are born unpositionally born then god sets in the church pastor teacher prophet evangelist let him fight that oh glory to god we are fighting that channel we believe the same holy ghost that peter had the same holy ghost that paul had the same holy ghost that the early church had we have to have that same holy ghost oh glory no no modern thing i am the message that is the holy ghost oh glory to god when i believe i have the holy ghost that's a lie that's a baptist doctrine oh i am the holy ghost that's another lie there's a big lie for glory to god you have to receive it because he sent it oh hallelujah what's the holy ghost is for he's the purpose of the holy ghost that's what god said the holy ghost for the power is to give you power hallelujah what are the words that's for power he's send that give you power you can fight with god fight satan and with some rhyme or some some catch freeze and i can't say that power he said give you power what for power in prayer you take a person live a good life always defeated they never get a prayer answered you fill that little woman with the holy ghost one time watch what take place when she goes before god she's not defeated she comes boldly to the throne of god believing she has a right because she's a daughter of god by birth you take a little man so cowardly boss kick him all over the place wait a minute something changed he's got the holy ghost it gives you power your life is full of power it gives you power of speech we don't want self-confidence i hold you i can't remember other things call it damn brass face or bold face we don't want that it gives you a power of speech or when you see when they will feel about the holy ghost they say oh and she's the one they say where is rabbi jones where's the fellow where's that intellectual giant peter they were scared already you know but then come out there this is that they where their fellas wear them fellas who talking all the time buying us with coat and wood and widow hallelujah they had they had they had they had power of speech it's not right god's got a little church that will move right on with the baptism of the holy ghost i want to repeat that one god they know pentecost because they prophesied there'll be a baptism outside of pentecostal denomination so he's talking about us a fresh baptism a baptism of god hallelujah god's got a little church that will move right on so when i don't want baptism i know my pen because i never knew six you know i don't want to put it because i chose speaking in tongues and i'm not talking about that i don't want to be baptism to get this word moving because moses had all this big revelation you know mother telling my father tell him he read it he studied it hear what he promises but nothing happening 40 years take off and run because he was defeated because he never met god he only heard intellectually but when that light speak to him when fire hit him hallelujah something happened within him that transformed that man altogether he knew he had power he knew god was with him he had confidence to face any situation that's what we're talking about oh glory to god the devil is a liar tonight oh glory to god all your fears will be dissolved by the pillar of fire by the voice of god by the thunder of god by your encounter with the supernatural your fears will dissolve and something going to break into your soul of a faith like you never had before that's why when the storm was raising jesus was putting on a hard sleep on the boat and when the disciples were singing the specials and they recognized it not working it's still there moving they're still shaking with all the specials they're singing they say let's wake jesus yes this thing is serious because the devil saw opportunity to sink all of them oh glory to god they didn't make jesus jesus always tumbling in the sea oh glory to god awaken me but peace be still oh glory to god he rebuilt the storm hallelujah is fair that doing that he's all he have little failures rebuilt the storm show them their power with the elements power the wind the same power joshua have shown stand still his sons talking oh glory to god hallelujah he lights up at the mountain and strike the river and the jordan open up his sons walking son stalk him all glory to god rest he had to open up because sun's moving is god's people moving and it's time for that red sea to open up it's time for your mountain to move it's total time for your cancer to resolve it's time for your blind eye to pop open oh glory to god it's time for the anointing to strike the church of the living god we are on the prophecy we are walking into the vision to prepare a vision but we walk into the reality of the vision to fulfill the vision that was prophesied of us oh hallelujah oh my power your testimony today will bring judgment hallelujah against the city our testimony of the baptism of the holy ghost and the power of god a holy life don't leave that one out we'll bring judgment against the city power of prayer are you with me paul speech are you saying amen out there power for a holy life that is what the holy ghost is to do some people say i can't quit drinking i can't quit this the holy ghost come to live in you to make all these cans get away from you to make you a holy life it will make you follow the instructions of the bible every time it's to make you turn your head from them half naked woman amen brothers quit lusting after them and church members it's the quest making you smoke and drink and want to be a big shot oh glory to god holy we will stick all the big shutting out to you it takes that out of you it takes that lust to be a big shout out to you it'd make you quit gossiping make a quick quick playing cards hallelujah make you quit carrying on the way you do living untrue to your wife hallelujah it will make you set your affections and things above you say i can't do it i can't do it he said but the holy spirit come for that purpose that's what it come for to take it out of you all of them all habits and things you're doing they're all biting separating yourself say bless god i'm a methodist i would have nothing to do with them holy rulers the holy ghost come to terror to you hallelujah i'm a baptist i'm a presbyterian i wouldn't go to that little holy church the holy ghost come to take all that stats out to you oh it washes you with the blood it irons you out it come to straighten you up it makes the crooked places straight that is what they come to do all this is what the holy ghost was sent for hallelujah is to give unction to the preacher oh glory the god says the preacher have no unction you know the holy ghost is not there it's to give unction to the preacher is to give holiness to the group is to set the church in order it's to bring unity of spirit is to unite us together with power is to unite us together with love bloody love and if the holy spirit is in you it will lead you right to the word there'll be no excuses oh my you'll make it toward the line every time what the holy ghost is to make you a citizen of the kingdom of god and what does god do in his kingdom is holiness righteousness purity of thought beauty of mind power and love going to the loss healing the sick performing miracles doing great things including remark then it is absolutely now to you people it is absolutely essential unnecessary and compelling and compulsory that you receive the holy ghost now for if you don't you cannot come in the resurrection nor watch god cannot break his laws we know that he follow his laws i want to read it again he says no to you people it is absolutely essential unnecessary it might be essential you shake the pasta it might be necessary you have to believe all the teachings and on all them you know that might mean the thing but this year it is essential necessary compelling compulsory that you receive the holy ghost now for if you don't you can't come in the resurrection now what god cannot bring his laws we know that he follow his laws what is the holy ghost god in you what's it for to continue his work among his people to bring his church together to bring the church to our place in this day fabian lutheran methodist pentecostal into a place of adoption and rapture and grace and when this part of the church when the spirit moves into this church here it will just raise and bring it forth and all the redeemed that touch that spirit so actually the bride will have the capstone spirit i like to bring it as a magnet that magnet anointing all them in the grave who are elected they are already magnetized hallelujah so once this bright magnet is activated it will pull them right up out of the grave hallelujah praise god you must receive the holy ghost by one spirit we are baptized into one body oh glory to god what is it is the spirit of god what's this for to lead you to guide you to fill you to sanctify you to call you out oh glory to god thank you lord jesus and after the seas was open and the prophet preached the token he said that was the message to cap the seals that was the captain message after all the mysteries after all the revelations after all the history the messages were capped off by this particular message the token and the token is not doctrine the token is not teaching the token is the blood on display and the blood display like how the blood was on the door post and moses time but in this time it is the literal life of jesus jesus christ on display we're not talking about talking apply to the heart now we're talking about talking on the outside so the life on the inside began to ooze on the outside and that's why he said the ministry has reached perfection when christ is reproduced in the natural oh glory to god do you see it now hallelujah some minister can say what they want and say they've adopted and said that ministry and this and that and you're not seeing jesus you know something is dead wrong he said the ministry has come to perfection when christ is reproduced in natural hallelujah now we don't talk about pulpit thing we're not talking about message thing a nice message a nice teacher we're not talking about that we're talking about the reproduction of christ oh hallelujah a life thundering oh my oh hallelujah the law and the prophet saw until john almost finished since that time the kingdom is preaching and every man presented he said every man presented not just simply walk into it easily it's got to be pressed into it's got to be pressed into stay present to wherever you are pressed into not shaken not your love your past and he he's sung in good and he's preaching good and he wishes nice not that forget that you have to press into the kingdom you're passing of the kingdom he doesn't control the kingdom he doesn't have the kingdom you have to press into the kingdom of god hallelujah almost finish usually it takes a state of emergency to thrust into desperation it's too bad it has to do that but human beings are so slothful in their mind it takes emergency something arises and when they do it throws them into a desperation and really in doing that desperation it brings out the real thing that you are it shows what you are made up of hallelujah oh praise the lord thank you lord in egypt time it was a real tough hour you know it was tough because you're hearing these screams young people calling people bowling night because that angel moving and hearing it coming from a distance i want you to think about it now from a distance and you have crying going on a mother wailing because a son is dead in a house that the angel just moved through and the prophet dramatized the children asking the father daddy are you sure are you sure we are safe i hear cries down the road and the cry is getting nearer and nearer that's the shaking time you can't eat you can't sleep that's a dreadful night actually that night they wasn't sleeping and rocking her child going to sleep i gonna take us no no no they had the stuff in their hand oh god shoes on the feet it wasn't free time you know it was time to move out i wanted that time coming back again a desperate time time to leave this place time to leave this world i want to be coming back to that again hallelujah a midnight time a midnight cry or midnight oh people lay back in the message they're relaxing probably say yeah you're relaxing but then something going to happen that changes everything oh my hallelujah it was a shaken time did daddy are you a short time you see when we have genuine love what does it do it pushes our feet out to the battlefront for god genuine godly love for god and for his word and for his people will push fate out dear love just takes a hold of fate that is why it's important to understand that this faith to put long charity is based upon forgiveness if we can love the brethren if we can't have genuine forgiveness and dropping out how could we access this presence and power and i was sharing how we need the lord we really need the lord all this coronavirus the kind of variants of respect and if any message you believe that book someone it will knock you out we'll kill you because it's a judgment that's what it really is it's dead are you following me now no we need a lord we need a spirit we need this power it is promise we cannot say send it no we want it no we would like to have it now we are not in charge of that like peter he was just speaking but the holy ghost fell on them the word seed was going out and the spirit is here to water that seed and make the word spoken made manifest and put them into the kingdom of god swear turn to spirit in their life they receive it spirit word into their hearts out of peter's mouth because peter is in the body so he's a dramatized son he's a channel of god hallelujah life is flowing through peter eternal life oh glory to god joey god's own life fire from of the altar oh glory to god the man even baptized in jesus name yet the man never went to one service the man listened to one book one tape but he had testimony from a living witness i know dead scripture there's a living witness those black those brothers was written epistles hallelujah that was a living word talking to them that was a living word preaching to cornelius house the text of what peter was preaching wasn't written yet he was living it out hallelujah and the devil had to move out oh glory to god this wonderful tonight hallelujah but i'm saying god will always meet a desperate soul he says usually it takes something to drive us into that to that despair to that desperation it takes something to do it james 5 15 the effectual fervent the prayer of a righteous man of that much the effectual favor and prayer he said that is desperation where is desperation effectual food and prayer it's similar to he that committed god must believe that he is he's a reward of them that diligently energetically fervently seek him so there's a way to see god father oh i love you lord and you know how it is no i know desperation i just talk like that hiding under the breath of prayer we're not talking about that kind of thing you know when you're desperate it reflects in your action your attitude it reflects in your desires and everything else oh glory to god effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man fulfilling prayer oh praise god as in the bible teaching when i elijah elisha didn't know what was wrong with the child god didn't tell him everything he said a piece of flow he's had to paste the floor started he's what happened he's desperation he won't know happening the child fall dead this can't work i give the woman a promise and this comes at me and hallelujah they put a child in the room getting desperate hallelujah he passed in the flow but i'm saying peace on the floor why something moving in he said lord is your will your god if you beat your will lord um if the child lives well he's live he died die you bury him no it wasn't that wasn't it that what we have known lord if it's your will people just accept the condition accept the diabetes accept cancer accept tumor accept whatever they want to accept because if god before us we are the miracles hallelujah where's the desperation to see the miracle nor if we don't say this if we don't preach that people wouldn't expect miracles they expect to be dead and buried they expect to sick and die where are the miracles they've got before us oh glory to god hallelujah listen to this jacob we find out we know jacob he he he had to meet his brother esau he sent his wife's one way cherry one away and everything else but jacob fall along on his knees and then he get desperate hallelujah abraham says anta daddy oh that's the only way you'll be able to get to achieve the thing that you're wanting is to desperately come i must have it tonight i get it now or i'm finished tomorrow is too late i have to have now and i read this because i want to bring this next part when you pray for the baptism of the holy spirit the token here we call it when you pray for the baptism of the holy spirit the token don't say well no i'll go up and try lord i'm a little tired he said oh mercy stay in your seat don't even make an attempt if you come and say i'll pass you the prayer line put all in my head i'll see if it does me any good you might as well set where you are until you get to that place until the whole church here we go until the whole church gets to a place that's between life and death then you you have to have it no or perish then god will move on the scene it takes desperation to bring god on the scene we know jacob got desperate and then jesus pulling on and so on and some people say i see a light he said glory to god you say there you are you'll receive somebody i feel so good brother branham i went down there and prayed shiva's run over me that might have been god i saw a light that still might have been god but that ain't what i'm talking about he's talking about jacob stay there until something happened that make him walk different made him a different person because he stayed until something happened not until he hear a good message you'll find i will be beaten that and i will keep beating it until it strike home not until i hear another sermon we are people who sit and hear someone and say amen and they live they live in rotten they are terrible people terror behave but they're doing that duty amen him and that every word nothing unto them nothing up to them they are eminence of wood hallelujah the amen and word and when they leave they forget what what would they amen oh hallelujah my god but here is bomb here now jacob stayed here until something happened that made him walk different made him different person because he stayed until that happened the bible said he held until he prevailed how can a man prevail over god but you can do it you can do it a man can prevail over god but you can't be desperate till god speaks to you so you have to hear direct from god so church right shake yourself pinch your conscience wake yourself up in this hour we must be desperate or perish there is coming forth something from the lord i know it has thus said the lord there is coming forth something and we better be desperate is between life and death it will pass through us and we won't see it a blind bartimaeus when he cried out to jesus they telling me making shut up he made too much annoyance but he was desperate and he what he do he screamed out he said oh jesus no matter they told him to stop he cried out just the same that more louder when they told him to shut up it made him get louder because he was desperate nobody could stop him he said lord have mercy upon me that was enough oh glory to god hallelujah and christ left what he was doing to minister to him because god always responded to a desperate soul mission comma please desperation calls for a subject and when the subject no matter how faint it is it's received it is believed right then oh my peter we know peter he fell in the water and so on and he said christian tonight if you're in a line of duty trying to follow the leading of the holy spirit and i can't say grab you that grabs you or cancer tuba color uh what whatever it is he said scream out and said lord save me hallelujah god heard him in the line of duty he started to sink he failed no matter if you fail that don't have nothing to do with it i think i would read it again god heard him he said in the line of duty he started to sink he failed no matter if you fail that don't have nothing to do with it we all feel we are fair to begin with but we got somebody standing now with a strong hand who can reach us and take us above the water and if you make a mistake some women make a mistake some man made a mistake some boy or girl made a mistake don't sink scream out in despair lord save me all perish get desperate about it god will hear you he always hears a desperate soul oh my and jesus his humility he said not my will but i'll be done he prayed earnestly he said brother sister if jesus prayingisly how much more have we got to pray earnestly if god of heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly then how much more we are still received by grace so where are we putting all the arrogance that we see in this message all the hostile behavior all the proud and and so on like that and people believe that because they have a book or table believe this message that everything is fine they just made it already they are deceived they will receive them fully deceived they failed to understand that those two million people that came out of egypt wasn't going to make it to the promised land yeah yeah two million people come out under moses tapes books and tapes and moses message they all say we go in hallelujah they're going to the red sea hallelujah but they couldn't see the carcass fall in the wilderness they couldn't see the time begin to unfold and reveal the unbelief in their system they couldn't see the god that sees the end from the beginning saw the next generation moving in they couldn't see their children is who gonna cross over with joshua and caleb they couldn't see that their attitudes and their mindset was so difficult and tough that god said you know what not one of them going over the children will go over the children will cross over hallelujah it's god we serve i think the last message we preach on talk about ezekiel 9 about the incon writer and you know what the bible says start in my sanctuary and then they begin at the ancient men before the house before destruction struck the city before destruction strike los angeles before destruction strikes the world he was stacked in his house to the very people who claim to believe him love him and serve him he said begin at my sanctuary judgment actually begins right there and from there it goes out begin at my sanctuary this is not a game this message is not a plea thing this is the word from the lord and the word of the lord came unto me saying oh glory to god when that word come that word can fail because that word is god oh hallelujah thank you jesus but abraham says the people had their own camp but they had to change the kyam grunge in order to see the supernatural when god deal with the people for many years god is not in the camp anymore because they made themselves a self-made camp not god's camp of his word a camp of their own he had to leave them for he is the word and he cannot stay where people are taught out of the word every group that off the word god can stay there yes they acknowledge and this and god prophet he move out already because god in the world is the same that's why he says say what the tape say don't say with no cuckoo revelation no new revelation some revelation the prophet did not bring and it's song and good but it's not the scriptures it can match all from genesis to revelation hallelujah so i be able to stay with this hallelujah who vex lost glory to god i'm gonna close if you are not in the kingdom of god press into it surely i would have knowledge of what i'm speaking of god would never honor my prayer to do what he does and you're outside the kingdom seek christ as your refuge now oh my you say man press into it you don't just turn around and say pick me up by the color lord push me in you press into it you get desperate between life and death oh my you begin to play something i'm done tonight and this is what i had to share with you tonight oh glory to god the purpose that god sent the holy ghost he said he's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god when god will make himself known oh my for 50 years god has made himself known by scriptures by text by revelation by the word since the prophet have lived but we're talking about waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god when god will make himself known when they will stop sickness they will stop cancer they will stop diseases do you think can say something the bible said there will come a time when men will rot right in their flesh and the buzzers will eat off the carcasses before they even die cancer is a two take to what's coming but remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who are the seed of god that's what we are striving for now to get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of god before these horrible plagues strike kona virus that's not the end is how much plague is coming it have words coming that is just a tip of the iceberg that the lord could show what he can do what he can allow what he can permit what he can show to man with all his intelligence and in all his science and all the technology he can show that something that your eyes can't see hallelujah is affecting people affecting lives and all along you see masks all over the world because people don't want to get this virus since he says oh glory to god but there is another there's a inoculation of the holy ghost that god wants to give oh to whosoever will who wants it who wants the holy ghost tonight who wants to reach out tonight oh glory to god could you everybody sing that brother reach out you hear the word [Music] but where's the time to reach out and touch the lord where's the time to say lord i need you
