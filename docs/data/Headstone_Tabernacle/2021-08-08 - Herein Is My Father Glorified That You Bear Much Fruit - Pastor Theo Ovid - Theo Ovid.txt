come down and breathe upon it lord breathe life into it take me out of the way anoint me by the pillar of fire by the anointing lord and deliver the word to the people in jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you so if you have your bibles this morning i'd like to turn to sin john chapter 15. i want to read from verse one to eat we want to read from sin mark 4 verse 26 to 29 and also we want to read in john chapter 12 verse 24. uh saint john 15 reading from boston i am the true vine my father is a husband man every branch of me that bear it not fruit he take it away every branch that beared fruit he pushes it that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i knew now we know this is jesus speaking right as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except abide in the vine no more can ye accept you about in me so this year is the secret you must abide in him i am the vine one you are the branches two he that abides in me and i in him the same bringing forth much fruit so the condition for much fruit is abiding for without me you can do nothing if a man of by not in me is cast forth as a branch and is riddled men gather them and cast them into the fire and they're burned if you abide in me in my words abiding you shall ask what you really shall be done unto you hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples and in amplified they have when you bear or produce much fruit my father is honored and glorified and you show and prove yourselves to be true followers of mine said mark 4 reading from verse 26 jesus again and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he'd know what not how for the earth bring it forth fruit of itself first the blade then the air after that the full corn in the ear but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put it in the sickle because the harvest has come our last scripture from saint john chapter 12 verse 24 verily where i sent to you jesus again speaking except a corner wheat fall into the ground and die to abide it alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit may god bless his word you may be seated or it's great to be here today and by the scriptures i believe you know where i'm going tonight and the title i have is here it is my father glorified that you bear much fruit herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit and the subject when the fruit is brought forth the harvest is come an inspiration but if it die it dies the seed it brings forth much fruit so that is conditional if it die if it don't die it abide alone but if it dies the sea that is it bringing forth much fruit so that is conditional on that seed dying out okay so this is a prophecy and this is brother branham i want you to notice a really close something just happened malachi 4 is to bring back back to the original talk about it right now she is spitting from the church from the bloody church body spreading with her master for the same purpose she is the word just as joseph was spitting from his brethren because he was the word and jesus was smitten from his brethren because he was the word the church the bride is smitten from the church because she is the word so the church is the church but the bride is the word there's your stages again one two three see just exactly the word living and in action the bible bride i love that the word living and inaction the bible bride not some man-made bride the bible bride smitten afflicted of god no beauty we should desire her and but yet we did a steamer smitten afflicted of god that's right she stands alone she is smitten from all denominations according to revelation 3 she's smitten out of the louisiana church age she was raised up in this church was raised up in the loud recent church age that's the husk can't you pentecostal see that he said if the stalk had to die if the tassel had to die so must the husk die stands alone like the bridegroom rejected of men despised and rejected of the churches the bride stands that way what is it it's his masterpiece see here we go here the interpretation of that it's the word that he can work through made manifest that is a masterpiece the word that he can work through may manifest so the stalk the tassel the husk never become seed not at the harvest time oh glory to god i love this the seed is back to its original life back to the bible oh glory to god some point in time it has to go right back to the bible at the harvest time the seed is back to its original life back to the bible malachi 4 said it would be that way my you must have all the word isn't that right it must have all the word oh praise the name of the lord oh praise god is that the word he said where are we at there's only one thing the office is here she is dead right she is ready now for the coming and that's the prophecy there's only one thing the harvest is here that's prophecy she is dead right she is ready for the coming so when will we be ready for the coming when we are dead right that means we are really ready for the coming when we are dead right do you believe that this morning oh blessed be the name of the lord so he said now at the harvest time the seed is back to its original condition and must have all the word in order to be the seed now you can't have half a seed it won't grow it's got to be the whole seed it's got to manifest and say i believe in the baptism holy ghost i speak in tongues no that's just part of the seed and now added to that see the life not the gifts the life of the gifts see what i mean we are the end time brethren so the taste in the believer's heart should be for the life the life of the seed that was sown scripture hallelujah we read it and for the he said no watch so is the kingdom of god they saw mark four we read this as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed would spring forth and grow you know and how all right so to see springfield and grow but what sense does it make for the farmer to go out if the seed just spring and growing he goes out in nothing he has to wait for it to bring forth or unfold for the earth bring forth fruit of itself this is the laws of god now nobody could break it first the blade one then the air two after that the full corn in the air tree but then number four but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put in the sickle because the harvest has come so god is not going to reap green god is not going to reap stalk and tassel and husk he's going to wait for the fruit and that's what we get into so the blade justification looter the air sanctification wesley the full corn in the air the bathroom only goes to pentecostal but now the fruit which is what the prophet brought the full word to bring forth the fruit word made flesh back in the bible bride oh praise the name of the lord now we type three women we know it praise god sarah hager and mary and mary had the seed and mary was like the husk but the seed was christ inside of there right so three denominational ages or carriers must die and dry up just like the shock and so forth to give room for the seed oh this is real now the seed cannot get ripe until the shock stalk leaves all dry it sucks every bit of the life in them out plus praise god no it is sea time or bright time so this is the word now it is sea time or bright time notice in harvest time you can't change your seed whatever the seed is that is what it will produce oh we're living in dangerous times now you have to know what seed inside of you hallelujah the sharks are dead prophecy the shocks are dried up diversion time not touched it's virgin a virgin would time if you put in the hands of a denomination it won't be a version it will be manhandled time you get it but god church is not touched by the nomination all praise god regardless of what ministers say so-called apostles so-called prophets so-called evangelists so-called pastors whatever they say god's real bright church will not be touched because jesus himself said upon this rock i will build my church not mandolin church but god himself building that church and that church is built by revelation not by group thinking we here do this we do that it's not that he's building a church on he's building his church by revelation oh praise god so he said hallelujah how wonderful i love it i know it's the truth it will not be touched there will be no denominational manhandling in the virgin birth of the bride oh glory to god look at that there's a powerful one there'll be no denominational manhandling in the virgin birth of the bride you mean the bride has to be beaten yes not church joining a message the birth of the bride hallelujah no she is commanded of god to come out of such touched not the unclean thing oh my that's from the seed not here with the church the shock praise god another scripture context trip i had james 5 7-9 be patient there for brethren unto the coming of the lord i think i believe i read this in the prayer meeting friday be patient there for brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husband man waited for the precious fruit of the earth he's not waiting to look how how bountiful the seeds pop up or the seeds are growing no he is waiting for the fruit of the earth watch and had long patience for it until he received the early and the latter rain now there's a reason i just love how the scripture places this the husband man okay waiting for the precious fruit of the earth he could only wait because he knew that he has planted the seed and every seed has to bring forth after its kind he had patience for it he's unhurried because he know according to nature the life of the seed has to unfold and as the life unfold it reveals itself so if you want to know what kind of tree what kind of tree is that well let it grow what kind of seed is that plant it let the life unfold it have a law of the life being unfolded by stalk by tassel by fruit and when the fruit comes then you know what kind of tree it is and then the verse eight of that scripture says be also patient so the husband is patient and you are exhorted to be patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord jordan 9 and then an exhortation in verse 9 grudge not against another brethren least she be condemned behold the judge stand it before the door so in harvest time your behavior and your attitude towards one another is a big issue it's a big count let's continue and this is from the associations i believe and i've said a moment ago that the false vine came into full fruition in this age her fruit would mature and ripen that is correct this evil-spirited church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree where enlarge the falls of the air and her head will be the antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then it must also be true that the bright church will mature hallelujah on that the bright church will mature and her rightness shall be an identification with a lord by means of the word and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is christ and as the false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up of political force physical force and demons of darkness come against this true vine the true vine here we go the true what true vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that jesus did oh glory to god hallelujah who doing that the true vine what scripture is that i am the true vine my father is the husband man now i notice now and we said it before the devil is not even in the picture it had no lucifer in the picture it had no rome in the picture it have no antichrist in the picture this scripture this has to do direct with the elect with the people that claim to be connected to christ i am the vine the true vine not just mine my father is a husband man so i'm declaring to you who is the husband man i am the true vine any branch in me that don't produce cut off no fruit cut you off oh brother ovid we have to bear fruit exactly oh glory to god hallelujah even didn't bear fruit in the first outer court or in the holy place but when that went into the shekinah glory when that went into the presence of god into that supernatural light it brought forth olives and blossom and almonds hallelujah why it was in the presence of that kind of glory it was identified by god isn't that right so let's read it again the true vine with the fullness of the spirit fullness and the word will do not we'll talk not we'll teach we're talking about the true vine with the fullness of the word charity is the bride's absolute charity is the cap of the pyramid the thing that can fail and to get to dear as a process at a fair virtue under virtual knowledge and the knowledge temperance under temperance patience and godliness and brotherly kindness what we're doing you're going right up to the fullness of the spirit the fullness of the word will do the very acts of power that jesus did then as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word jesus will come that the bride and groom may be forever oh blessed be the name of the lord but what about the true seed the people of god are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her this bride will be the fullness of pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning and that is thus saith the lord oh give the lord a shout nobody could cut that off and say we have this pentecostal thing and this penis said no no this is the word you know right back the people of god are being made ready you know i was thinking about this being made ready what's the purpose of if somebody know the exact date of the coming of the lord the pastor revealed the date and the hour and the moment and they have a big revelation we know we know it's coming oh we know we know the date the month the hour the year whatever and they're not ready it's a waste of time so that date is not relevant the very day is not relevant or even important it's about getting ready and when you're ready it doesn't matter which day it is the day does not matter if it's 20 more years 40 more years 100 more years two more years six months it doesn't matter because you are ready but the bible said his wife had made herself ready so the key is not the date is that information or even in connection with the minister of this information which is lucifer hallelujah but is really becoming ready back the word oh let's continue it is thus saith the lord but ram for that is what joel 236 26 says then he quote the scripture be glad and he turned his hand rejoice in the lord your god for he had given you the former reign moderately and he will cause prophecy to come down for you the rain the former and the latter in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall be overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years the locusts have eaten the conqueror on the caterpillar the pamu my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that i just want to live with you and my people shall never be ashamed now it says god is going to restore the lutheran age did not restore the church it started the reformation the western age did not restore the pentecostal age did not restore but god has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church this is the restoration to restore is to go back to what it was before let me say it again to go to restore is to go back to what you had your former state or condition god prophecy now okay god will take the church right back to pentecost of the beginning oh that is something to shout about man oh god i could hear the believers in the whole shouting god taking you right back to pentecost no minister no force anointed could stop the bride from going right back to pentecost no let no man lie to you and tell you they have no pentecost to go back to this is it here the western ages that we store the pentacles earlier did not restore but god has to restore for you cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration god will take the church right back to pentecost at the beginning notice in 25th it tells why we need restoration the lucas the conquer womb the caterpillar pam are eating all but the root now we are told that all these insects are one and the same in different stages different stages they are the antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination and false doctrine through the ages and that poor little roots talk is going to be restored god isn't going to plant a new church it's going to bring back his original plantain back to the original seed he is doing it he is starting it by the teaching oh give the lord a shout or the four marine next will come the harvest rain or rapture and fate oh that's a big bomb next will come what harvest rain or rapturing fate he's restoring it what by teaching or for marine next will come the harvest rain or the rapture of rapture and feet so the harvest rain that comes at harvest time together the fruit of god is rapturing fate so now you could see that the bride is really going in the rapture because when the harvest has come he said put quickly the sickle and reap because the fruit has come oh hallelujah so when god's seeing the fruit he's ready to put in the sickle immediately hallelujah and harvest that bride oh glory isn't that wonderful this morning oh no the seed must be planted and then it must have water in order to grow so you know the secret is right the word is in the bribe how the wood get there seas was planted into the bride what kind of seeds promises promises that was brought by 20th century prophet promising the holy ghost promised adoption promise you deliverance promise to heal by these promises we will become partakers of the divine nature not our seeds we suppose you be eunuchs we're not supposed to have our seed of our interpretation or what we think he's saying and we you know it come to me and i see it so i know i don't see it so it has to be what god said this spoken word is original seed say it in your home the spoken word is the original seed what spoken word what the municipality pulpit no not that the spoken word original seed is what came out the mouth of the prophet because the prophet mouth is the mouth of god man channeling by bread alone but by every word that proceeds of the mouth of god and the mouth of god is as prophets and under that mount of god of other men to echo the same prophecy that the prophet spoke that's why he said the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word can be no newton it's the same thing all glory to god have no man bringing no extra mystery hallelujah all the mysteries has been unfolded all the mysteries have been revealed as you're being taught under for marine anointing the seed going into you these promises these spoken promises put your seed no interpretation with it so hear this now this seed must be planted that's number one but number two it must have water in order to grow so you can't be in love with the teacher in love with the pastor he love how he does say it and love what he explained thy seed that his word but he'd have to have water for it to grow just as much as you need seed is just as much too much water and see this word and water is inspiration oh glory to god see this word and water is the anointing see this word but water is your watering with your praises so if there's no praises and blessing and worship there is no water to that seed it's just intellect just flesh getting mysteries flesh getting teachings flesh getting revelation or interpretation or knowledge hallelujah that's why john was in the spirit that's how we have to be in the spirit oh hallelujah did you say well brother branham i'm going to express your thought thought here we have had water so baron pick up somebody thinking we have water you say so be it that's correct you have had the water you ever plant cabbage or anything or seeds other like that usually they got water there just pour a little on them right now wait but did we have a plant in time before marine oh you said but iran nonsense now wait a minute you take the word former in jewel too look at it and see the hebrew word and see if you want to write it down m or u r e a maury and get the hebrew word and interpret see what maura means teaching or the teaching ring when fought the nominational teaching ring went forward you see now watch now remember the word moire means teaching the four marine isn't that right now what's the matter she's waiting on for the lettering and that is when she produces her fruits oh glory to god she's waiting for what later in that is when she produces her fruits i hope you get her then the kind of seed you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap so that's what i said last time all them haters they have the harvesting coming all the liars they harvest time coming all the black biters the harvest time coming all them people with terrible nasty attitudes the harvest time is coming just remember the camera will snap one day on him that is filthy filthy still him that is righteous righteous still him that is holy holy still caught in whatever condition you're in oh this is this is this is real now all right so watch she's waiting for the lettering that is when she produces a fruit i hope you get her then the kind of seed that you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap if the denomination wants more members that's what they're going to get and that's what they have gotten the pentecostals one more pentecostals that's what they're going to get but the word is going to produce sons and daughters of god not message believers not church members but sons and daughters of god when we say that we're saying about attribute sons of his spirit manifested sons are you with me look at that great latter rain supposed to be done how they would run and leap over walls how there will be an army coming wait a minute the kind of crop you will get is the kind of seed you put in your field somebody asked me to repeat that hebrew word again he said mori which means teaching in other words it will be a teaching ring and a harvest rain we have had the teaching rain and we are ready now for the harvest rain you know the first rain is when you plant the seed and start your crop growing oh here the bomb down but just before it matures then comes another crop irene that is called the harvest rain we know when it is oh my god the spring rain and then about june it makes a crop and the rain we find out was the spirit and people fighting the spirit they want men with words that tickling their ears the bible talking about the last days silly woman leading with lust heaping unto themselves teachers having itchiness they want to know if there's any numerous mystery coming forth hidden mystery underground mystery deep mystery all kind of mystery they want and it keeps the grey matter going hallelujah not the heart matter but the gray matter in the head going so listen friends we have had teaching rain you say but we have to be ready now ready now for the harvest rain hallelujah the first rain is when you plant the seed and starts a crop going but just before it matures hallelujah praise god it has to have a lattering just before it matures because when the fruit is comfort hallelujah the harvest has come and when you have this community habits are written you have to go and reap it you have to put in the sickle quickly oh glory to god and take that bride home take that bride away or are you getting along and to be fruit bearing oh how you don't want to be a tree you want to be a fruit let's continue hallelujah fruit bearing maturing right then first john 2 we did from verse 12 to 14 scripture john i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake 13 i write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one i write into your little children because you have known the father verse 14 i've written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i've written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of god abides in you and you have overcome the wicked one and the amplified it reads i'm writing to you little children because for his name's sake your sins are forgiven pardon to his name on account of confessing his name i am writing to you fathers because you have come to know recognize be aware of and understand him who existed from the beginning i'm writing to you young men because you have been victorious over the wicked one i write to you boys or lads because you have come to know and recognize and be aware of the father so that children again in verse 13 is not the same children in verse 12. verse 14 i write unto you fathers because you have come to know recognize be conscious of and understand him who existed from the beginning i write to you young men because you are strong and victorious and the word of god is always abiding in you in your hearts and you have been victorious over the wicked one so therefore these oh my these four groups here four groups speaks of spiritual development the first is babes in verse 12 newborn infants greek word tanika newborn infants little children they are rejoicing because their sins are forgiven can't do nothing much with that that's one level next level two the children in verse 13 hallelujah they know the father and that knowledge doesn't give them the ability to do anything for god with the knowledge of god and that greek word is paddier which is like a a higher child a bigger child a grown-up child the amplified called lad the third is the young who god said they are strong and overcome the wicked one and the thought is the fathers adopted sons the fathers who know him from the beginning the fathers will come true place of trying tutoring sanctification maturing so god's objective by these four stages of development is to bring us into fatherhood in other words when you are child you can rule but under truthism governors until the time appointed by the father so god's program is always to bring someone into maturity even the plants all around the whole thing is to bring you to your to produce fruit hallelujah to come into your full potential so the fathers who knew him from the beginning and god take them higher not knowing what god is doing but why he's doing it isn't that something else praise the name of the lord so let's look again i said in john 15. i know you will be tired let me read that scripture but this scripture is so important i like how it squeezes out the devil oh the devil is not in the picture at all is you as a believer being committed to see this word revelation of what you're supposed to connect with so is this not no brother no elder no pastor you have no excuse with the scripture none we have no issues all of us we have no excuse before sam john 15. i am the true vine my father is a husband man every branch in me that bear it not fruit he take it away every branch that buried fruit he purchased it to bring forth more fruit so number one is as fruit or i say number one no fruit pudding cut off number two if you bring fruit you can approach it to bring forth more fruit and then we find out that he want much fruit so there is no place for us to be we have arrived we are here we are it we have it it have no it here with that you have to come to much fruit because hearing is my father glorified let us read the whole thing here now now you are clean through the word which has spoken unto you abide in me and i knew as the branch cannot be a fruit of itself except at a bar in the vine no more can he accept you by me so he's telling you straight here you can't go on your own you could say you are the branch and the battle produce the fruit you know the vine to produce the fruit and the brightness branch and you and you are the french yeah go on your own if you go on your own you'll be a dead branch because the life flows from the vine into the branch to produce the fruit oh glory to god are you with me now so he said abide in me and i knew as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can he accept you by me he is not talking about abiding in a church he is not talking about abiding in a group or abiding in a camp he's not talking about that people have to come on the camp and come out of the group to abide in him because he grew up binding them and tying him up he's not going to abide in him they have no devil deal abiding in him he said i am divine yeah the branches he that abideth in me and i am him the same bringeth forth much fruit oh glory to god hallelujah for without me you can't do nothing if a man abides not in me he is cast out of the match and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if he abideth me hallelujah and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you so that is evidence of abiding a man can't talk he abides and there's no evidence of abiding this is the whole thing about it the evidence is dear if he abided me and my word abide in you you shall ask what you will hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit and we talk about the amplified we said it before we've seen it again when you beer produce much fruit my father is honored and glorified and you show and prove yourselves to be followers of mine and jesus said it this way by this shall all men know you my disciples when they could explain the mysteries that written on the book no he didn't say that he says when you have love one for another then shall all men know that you are my disciples and the bible talk about paul talk about the love that passes knowledge pass it understanding we're talking about agapo now guys what deal with the bull that could talk the bull language to tell the ball go back and sit down and lie down that's the love we're talking about that's the capstone anointing that's the supreme anointing that's the super anointing to come upon a bride is where they'd love to enter there not a message not a book not a tape not a tablet it will take lovee which is the cap promise to comp on the bride oh glory to god so this sin john here identify again stages fruit born again newbert more fruit isn't that right purred some more to bring forth what much fruit glory to god so one fruit two more fruit tree much fruit hallelujah much fruit god wants us to be fruit bearing do you believe that hallelujah fruit bearing much fruit to come into adoption spoken with power much root by much persian hallelujah praise god jesus said it if except a corner we'd fall into the ground and die it abides alone but if it dies it's bringing forth much fruit jesus already lose the key hallelujah death when i say dead death to self death to the human spirit debt to what we think are what we feel this is not a phrase this is the only way he point them to calvary glory to god the greeks came and said sirs we would see jesus the disciples didn't take them in a corner and show them the private interpretation or the private revelation no they brought them straight to jesus which a true minister will do and when they came to jesus you say i am he look at me i'm the messiah no he said look at calvary because you cannot really see me the way you should see me except you go to calvary that death takes us to the cross where you die your life is crucified hallelujah your human spirit crucified your trade spirit is busted and crucified you're not training that spirit rub down with the word or rub on like a rubbing something and he trained a spirit there no the trainer spirit ripped apart hallelujah to be placed with his spirit that's why he said a new heart i'll give you a new spirit and my spirit coming behind that new spirit that's why he said that claude hearth is desperately wicked who can know it but god let's continue my lord matthew 13. be back to the bible reading from verse 24 jesus speaking my god i'm looking forward for that bible study on tuesday jesus speaking not a problem but he fought unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like not a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and so tears among the wheat went his way and when the blade was sprung up broad fought fruit then appears the tears also so the servant of the house allah came and said sir this that now so good seed and i feel from whence then had it tears and he said to them an enemy had done this the servant said will now then that we go and gaze them up he said nay least while you guard up the tears you root up the wheat with them let boat grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say it to the reapers gather you together first the tears bind binding and bundles to burn them but carry the wheat into my ban don't touch them when they're going through the process don't touch them when the life is unfolded touch them only when they produce in the time of harvest oh glory to god hallelujah in other words when their fruit is identified then they could bring in the reapers or give the lord some praises so jesus in matthew 13 36 he is going to interpret this parable to them because he was only dropping parables dropping mysteries in the form of parables so matthew 13 verse 36 jesus then jesus sent the multitude away went into the house and the disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable the tears on the field he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man oh glory to god that is luke 17 30. even though shall the son of man be revealed that is all seven seals like all the sin has been unfolded to this malachi for end time elijah prophet he is the soul of the good seed oh hallelujah we can only take seeds from elijah we can't bring our own seeds if we bring our own seeds we become our own messenger oh glory to god but we going into the barnyard hallelujah of stored up food and breaking it out from the from the storehouse hallelujah and releasing it to you so watch that's where jesus said he answered them he that swear the good seed is the son of man [Laughter] my god listen to jesus word carefully now he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the feel is the world and all of a sudden jesus switched the good seed are the children of the kingdom so he put it from seed to children from seed to people good seed oh does he love to make you shout this morning the good seed at the children of the kingdom and the tears are the children of the wicked one so not just see those people hallelujah the enemy that saw them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world so listen friends it doesn't matter what preachers pipe and they fight their own interpretation until the fruit come forth we are we have to wait because the reapers are coming until the fruit is produced and the fruit is not message churches the fruit is not having a picture of the pillar fire over ram head and a cloud in the back of the church and i'm really messing with any bride that's not it that's the interpretation of it that's not it or are we not taking a vaccine to win the bride well take over instead you don't want any vaccine take over that's your choice up to you as if that make your bride and them who they will take the vaccine something wrong with them they're probably taking the market because they're off they're seeing revelation that is nonsense wait let me let me go there i ain't coming favor that okay so but i'm speaking message all to see the discrepancy and i went down and found the word discrepancy and i got the dictionary and looked what the word discrepancy means it means so in discord or being contrary so sowing discord or something else being contrary to what has already been hallelujah notice who he said that the swords were and what the seed was the sower was he the son of god is but abram who went forth to win seed and then he came from behind him which was the devil saw the seed of discrepancy behind so in the right seat friends that has happened to every age what is he saying after the prophet left then come the seed of discrepancy then came men to sow different seeds after the prophet left while the prophet was wrong they couldn't come up with the foolishness but after he left then come the enemy to sow different seeds and that is why we have so much variance today in this message i call it variance now all right okay so now he said the seed of god the word of god jesus said in a certain place the word is a seed word seed i never see the ringword after the sky no so balarama is tying it both together if the christian the children of god the children of the kingdom has become the seed of god then they must be the word of god so this word oh my that be preaching is not dead letter this word has to become flesh so the people the elect the bride become the seed itself that's why the bright seed word bride bible bride is given from church colonel members fleshly carnal church bench warming people killing time for years with a religious spirit on them catholic rebuke correction instruction discipline nothing they just want to take what they want dance sing say amen hallelujah rejoice but when coming to obey that's different that's why he said if it dies it bring it forth much fruit you might be a seed but if it stay by itself it'll by the lord no it takes debt to produce hallelujah isn't that right so watch if the christian the children of god the churn of the kingdom has become the seed of god there must be the word of god the word of god manifested in the age of living in for the promised seed of that age god gave his word at the beginning and each age had its seed it's time it's promises now we live through luther's age wesley age methodist age all along through the ages and the pentecostal age and each age is given a promise of the word and the people of that age here we go that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age not the people of that age that explain but manifest what you mean this word brought by this end time prophet messenger is to be manifested of course when jesus came there was a ton of scriptures jesus couldn't pick up anyone that identified who he was he found the place where it was written the spirit is upon me for he anointed me to do this that that that that he found the exact place then he said this day what you're reading here is fulfilled in your ear there's no longer a scripture it's no longer a text in the book it's no longer isaiah right that what isaiah prophesy is now here in other words this is that that the prophet isaiah spoke of peter said this is that that the prophet joel speak of we have to say this is that that the prophet william random speak of not some other man oh glory to god god sent one messenger to this end time behold i send you elijah the prophet oh glory to god do you believe that to say so the manifestation of the holy spirit operating through his children is though seed of the kingdom at that age he didn't say the manifestation of the holy spirit operating behind the pulpit or behind the pastor or being evangelist or whoever be operated in his children that means they came from child young lad young men into fathers enter spiritual adoption spiritual maturity isn't that right so notice the tears was the one the enemy satan also discovered or the seed of discrepancy he was the one guilty of doing this horrible thing satan saw the sea from the beginning and when god placed his first harvest of human beings upon the earth adam of course had a knowledge of the truth of right and wrong but he never completed us yet so satan is still controlling the ministry of disinformation i think last week i think i said somebody who said don't take that vaccine don't take that vaccine well the person who told that person don't take the vaccine they are now dead they called the trainer and said don't tell me vaccines you know they are not doctor the hell they're scientists they're not involved in the medical protection profession but they're influencing others don't take it you know now they come and die oh hallelujah praise god my lord praise god jeremiah 17 10 i the lord search the heart i try the reins even to give every man according to his ways according to the fruit of his doings according to what the fruit of his doing proverbs 11 30 the fruit of the righteous is the tree of life and he that winneth souls is wise the fruit of the righteous is what a tree of life psalms 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly no standing in the way of sinners nor sitting in the seat of this country but his in the light is in the law of the lord and in his law dirty merits a day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he do it shall prosper oh glory to god hallelujah matthew 7 verse 17 to 20. jesus speaking even so jesus every good tree bringing forth good fruit and the corrupt tree bringing forth evil fruit and yet above now a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringing forth not good fruit is huge and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits you shall know them oh glory to god i'll be coming along to that hour now because you see we come to the hour now where people can't change their seed they have the hatred they hold in grudges and oats think about it now coming down to the harvest time sowed on with this thing and always started produce all the pastors that saw their wicked evil seeds in the people against groups against other ministers and whatnot they have a harvest coming it will hit them right back because that is the seed that they saw what was given to them by the prophet is brotherly kindness look it right there the blood for the age spirit of forgiveness that was given say something nice say something good say something loyal if you have nothing good to say shut up it's that simple keep your spirit clean away from evil anger temper oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord notice the life that comes out the original seed comes through different processes three different processes oh and then turns back to its original condition oh blessed be the name of the lord hear what the prophet said the life that was in the husk in the stalk in the tassel gathers up in the seed and the life that was in the stalk one went to make the other justification made away for signification san signification made away for the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come down into perfection and back to the word again to manifest itself this part is very important the baptism made a way for the holy ghost to come down in perfection back to the word to manifest itself but the branham continues you notice when the seed goes into the ground it's the original seed when it comes forth it brings forth a life but what does the life do out of the seed of wheat it doesn't produce the same stock of wheat right then or the same grain on wheat it's the life of the wheat so it's cellular about the processes so when the seed goes on the ground it's original you put the seedling on the ground but out become a seed or come a stalk so now all this talk the tassel the leaves become carriers of the life the life of a destination the destination of the life is to reproduce itself in multiplied form so you have one corn seed and you plant that corn seed no you're not expecting one corn seed back when you put that corn seed the life of that corn seed start to unfold itself stalk leaves getting stronger more mature it's getting taller what are they going to do give you a full a of corn with multiple multiplication of itself hallelujah are you with me now all right so then he's showing what this church is all about and when you see it you see the mystery of god being unfolded in such simplicity the church ages is really the unfolding of the life and all these ages have been part of the caries of the life so the sea that we're known into the ground must come back to the original at the end because that's the destination of the life the life have nowhere else to go it can't stop at looter it can't stop it's a pushing then nominate and fall off then i'm on it it fall off it keep pushing because it's going back to the original oh glory to god hallelujah watch notice they were virgins talking about them they did not have the holy spirit so they must be in the bride talking about the foolish virgins they were virgins but foolish they believe their message but they're foolish they have the books on tape but they're foolish they love the pastor but they're foolish they love the church they're foolish they love the singing the songs but they're foolish they love the channel the children the channel the past saying but the foolish because it doesn't matter what channel here or the church or the people in is if they have the holy ghost hallelujah so if they think they have it to have it they still need it to be part of the bride so notice now they were virgins they did not have the holy spirit so they miss being in the bride not they they had they didn't take the vaccine on anybody you say you're talking about now because people feel they're on because they're taking bacteria you know they can say they're not taking a vaccine but they can't say i ain't taking any covering them because it come they have no choice with it had to deal with it but these here now they did not have the holy spirit so they miss being in the brine while the five wines who had oil became part of the bride but these people being a separated god loving people trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the lord will come up at the end of time they will miss the millennium which you can begin to see by these truths is much more important and wonderful than we ever taught or believe hallelujah don't gamble give me all in my lamb to keep me burning hallelujah give me all in my lamp i pray yes give me all in my lamp to keep me burning keep me burned until the break of day what you said because of iniquity the love of many gonna wax cool and you see this pandemic here something that works called something dead some drop out not back school you know they go on they accept hallelujah fall off the track hallelujah whatabrana this is deep i know you heard this before let's hear it again we would liken the church through the ages to the wheat plant a grain of wheat is planted to the end that a single grain of wheat will reproduce and multiply itself through certain processes during a certain period of time the singer seed that single seed will die but in dying the life that was in it will come up into the plant which in turn will be the bearer or the carrier of that life which is to come back to originality in a multiplied form jesus the great royal sea died that much this one who is the life of the church stand in the midst of the church for all seven churches giving his life to the church the carrier or the bearer to the end that his very life will be reproduced in bodies like unto his in the resurrection it is in that resurrection that the royal seed will see many royal seeds like unto himself and they will be even as he is for john said we shall be like him this is what john the baptist was referring to when he said that jesus would gather the wheat into the ghana that was the resurrection where the redeemed who have been elected in the eternal life come in then the record of this wheat plant whose end is to reproduce the original seed in multiplied form is the book of life i repeat the history or record of this wheat plant is the book of life of which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life this is convincingly seen by examining the wheat plant our beer seed is sown sooner blade is seen that's not the wheat yet it grows into a stalk that's not the wheat yet life is deer but not the wheat watch then at the end of the stalk is a spike send out a tassel still a wheat plant but no wheat yet so your car said it not in a message you can't say it or believe but you're heading down towards fruit so as we get down to the end of the tape you're running like a wrong distance at the end of that tape you have to produce fruit not just fruit more fruit not just more fruit much fruit because herein is my father glorified are you with me so then the land the plant is pollenized we see shaft grow it looks mighty like the wheat but it's not seed then forms a wheat a husk it is now back to what it was originally now the ripened wheat is harvested so jesus died he gave his life that life was to come back upon the church and bring many sons like unto himself into the glory of the resurrection but as the weed seed had to have a carrier to bring forth multiplied with seed even so there had to be a church which should be a carrier of the life of jesus christ as the blade stalked tassel and husk were carriers for the seed but not the seed itself so the church cooperate through the ages has been a carrier of the true seed do not deceit itself that is why we can say the book of life is the whole wheat plant but there's a section of that book hallelujah that's the bright section that's the eternal section oh glory to god he said let's go over that again here's the original seed that was planted it produced a blade that wasn't it it produced a stalk not that either here come the husk in which the wheat is the form the tassel appears then pollen falls on those pistils part of the plant is quickened something of the original seed that came through the rest of the plant turns into seed why didn't the whole plant go into seed because it was created to that end just part of that plant can go back into the bean seed because just part of that wheat plant is eternal life wheat so that's the ordination of god so there are people that started this message in the 70s they're not around in the 80s they're not around in the 90s they're not wrong but you are here oh glory to god you're alive and kicking you're one of them who who who them who are alive and remain the hallelujah oh glory to god you should be shouted in your house right now you are one of them who are living remain hallelujah praise god thank you jesus so the whole thing is original oh my thank you jesus so jesus christ died was planted he died that the life that was in him came up through the wheat plant and is reproducing itself in molecules of wheat seeds having the same life in them and being like the original and he had a bomb because by spirit they are original by what by spirit the original so what the devil couldn't see the life coming forth hallelujah all the grant the branches grafted in that get cut off but their life keep going up because it's a promise life at the top of the tree oh praise god praise god prophecy son of man candice won't live wish we had time i got to wrote down here hallelujah prophesied candies won't live what's the four stages coming forth for the church what's the four stages of ezekiel dry bones but life only come not when the sin knew skin was on them not when but when the wind blowed on them there come a message of life first bone to bone prophesy then flesh upon the bone all of this processes then skin upon the flesh process but then the wind come to bring that standing man to life oh praise god watch justification brought back the pulp some vacation brought back the back doctrine of holiness what brought back the leaves pentecostals clap their hands rejoicing but the fourth was the word the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the resurrection sign that christ oh glory to god i feel like running right now after justification have been planted sanification being planted baptism holy ghost organization died out christ has again scented himself like the cup of the pyramid first line justification signification baptism holy ghost then the coming of the cup what is it that holy ghost bunch being honed out to fit with that same kind of ministry no wonder he want more fruit because this bunch had to be honed to fit into the ministry of jesus christ oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god the holy ghost that he can fit with the same kind of ministry that he had when he went away and when he comes back it will catch the whole thing in the rapture where the justified sanctified baptism holy ghost that prim will stand again the house of god will live again the tree of life is going again we're almost done oh praise the name of the lord notice the first tree and three days after his death now the bride tree is also going to be restored in three stages now watch justification signification the baptism of the holy ghost he say one two three notice after three days the first three was restored so you're going to bring a revelation here at the beginning having the same signs same wonders jesus come back same jesus doing the same thing and at the end of the third day at the end the signs appeared not the end of the first day at the end of the day now the first day that form second day a rumor it was still there luther wesley at the beginning of the third day there was a rumor luther nothing on the second day third day the dispensation of the holy spirit there was a rumor he was the same yesterday today and forever but at the end of the third day that is where he made himself known and now here in the last days he is right with us moving right among us at the end of the third day he appeared and showed all of them his resurrection sign that he was living to see me yesterday and forever living fruits of his presence living fruits of his presence are you getting it after three days the fullest tree restored at the beginning having the same signs same wonders jesus doing the same thing the signs appear at the end of the third day now here in the last days he is right with us living fruits of his presence oh blessed be the name of the lord do you mean that must come back hallelujah glory to god living fruits of his presence thank you jesus hallelujah praise god could you give him some worship this morning hallelujah praise god praise god praise god mission cometh please hallelujah thank you lord jesus blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah praise god so what was the even light come on for what is the evening light for to restore to restore you get it the even light watch what is the even light come on for what is the even light for to restore you get it the even light is for the same purpose the morning light was for to restore what was cut down by the dark ages to rome god is going to restore by showing him for the even light what restore the whole word of god again the full manifestation of christ in his church everything that he did here we go everything that he did just exactly the way he did it would be again in the evening light and to know we are living right here to see it now the evening light exactly according to prophecy the even light come out to restore what to restore what the bugs had eaten out oh glory to god so when the fruit is brought forth the harvest is come where is the fruit and the fruit come and the holies of holies oh my hallelujah be on the veil friends that's what we are called onto it is serious abide in life a separated life unto god revelation from verse 13. i heard the voice of heaven saying unto me right blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth ye see at the spirit that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them and i looked and behold a white cloud upon the cloud one satellite under the sun a man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle another angel came out of the temple a loud voice unto him that sat on the crowd trust in thy sickle and reap for the time has come for thee to reap for the harvest of the earth is ripe and he has sat in the cloud trust in his cyclone earth i knew it was reaped and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also have a sharpsickle and another angel came out of the altar which had the power over fire and cry with a loud voice and cry to him to have the sharp sickle saying trust in thy sickle and guard the cluster of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe and the angel trusts in his sickle onto the earth guard the divine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of god judgment how close are we friends the prophet said god will do in one year what all the theologians failed to do in two thousand years he said we wait till the door is shut god will anoint the church then after noah under four marine anointing preaching to the people for 120 years to get into that act not only noah was preaching but he was adding layer upon layer deck upon deck wood upon word when it was completed when it was ready god put the actors sit there that the world will witness at that time witness the completion witness the fruit of it of his vision of of rain coming without producing any evidence whatsoever and they couldn't come in the door was shut souls in prison people watching then they can't touch watching and can't enter in but they have to see a witness they have to hear a word oh my what a famine is on now hallelujah famine in the land not for books and tapes not for preachers tons of them but for hearing hearing hearing hearing hearing the true word of god i can't fool you i can't tell you if in this church of the bride i could tell you to be part of that bride you have to be the word manifested to be the word manifested you have to produce much fruit if you produce fruit you're gonna purge you produce more fruit you're gonna perch until he produced much fruit god is gonna be glorified in this bride oh let's pray hallelujah thank you jesus father god i thank you today god is what was pressing upon me to deliver to your people about this whole thing about fruit the food has to come forth lord lord we're not looking for the mark of the beast and and the rome and the press come down and all of that all other scriptures all that is fine but there has to be a fruit that must be harvested and that fruit come at the end lord just like the orange tree grapefruit grafted in tangelo grafted in but at the end if that branch put forth another original branch it will produce an original fruit an original orange lord and your promise that light will come to shine upon the word to manifest that with father god i pray that your
