hallelujah the holy spirit is here this morning [Music] anything is possible do you believe that this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah let's just bow heads forward of praying keep playing softly [Music] heavenly father lord we are so grateful this morning lord to be in your presence to feel the anointing to know that the angel of the lord is here this morning fixing things around for the coming of the lord lord we see the cry of the people and the lord the desire of the people and the hunger of the people the thirst of the people the desperation lord of the people to break past the limitations of this world and this life and the cares of this life and lord the deceptions and the distractions and the obstacles and the situations lord that lord the bible describes could so easily be set us lord and lord we are so grateful to be in the land of the living that we could come to this house this morning lord to bring our sacrifice unto you lord lord there's nothing that we could do to deserve what you have done for us lord but your grace and your love and your mercy lord is bigger than our problem your grace your love and your mercy is bigger than our pain your grace your love and mercy is bigger than our situations your grace your love and mercy is bigger than every challenge and trial and test and we pray this morning that you would speak to your church you would speak to your people lord take me out of the way and lord father may this be a service that we will never forget we committed into your hands in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen you appreciate the song silvers this morning you appreciate uh brother anthony and the musicians amen you appreciate your pastor this morning the service last sunday and how god has been unfolding to us amen so certainly a great privilege and honor to be in the house of god this morning and to be able to just exhort you this morning by the grace of god and uh we look to see what god will do for us this morning so if you have your bibles would you turn with me to one portion of scripture reading from philippians three and reading from verse 8 philippians 3 and verse 8 ye doubtless without a doubt and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things paul is counting it an honor to suffer the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ and be found in him i want to take that slowly be found in him not just in church but in him not just in the message but in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law so paul is saying here that the law could only bring him to a certain level of righteousness and he could he could speak of his own but he said this is not what i'm talking about here not mine own righteousness which is of the law so he's given credit to what the law was able to achieve but he's now beginning to push beyond the law and beyond his own righteousness but that which is true the fate of christ so he is separating the righteousness that comes from the law with the righteousness that comes through the fate of christ and he clarifies it the righteousness of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings that is just too much to bear the fellowship of his sufferings to enter into his sufferings to feel his sufferings to talk about his sufferings to understand his sufferings being made conformable unto that if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained in other words when you look at me don't count me having anything either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the lord and it's certainly good to be in the house of the lord this morning to be able to enter into his gates with thanksgiving enter into his courts with praise be able to separate from the the the fears of life and to put god in his place keep him in his place which is first in our lives first you know affairs first in our transactions first in our conversations first in our deliberations first in our homes first on our jobs first in our families first when we have to face the doctor first when we have to pay the bill first when we have to approach anything we want to put god first we want to acknowledge him in all our ways we want to be sure that what we are doing is pleasing unto him we want to be sure that what we are doing is honoring him we want to know that he is satisfied that he is pleased we spend so much effort trying to please people we please our bosses we please the neighbor we please all kinds of different things but it is so important to please god that is the most important person that we have to please and we want to be reminded of these things it may seem simplistic but it is ever important that we please god if it's one person i want to satisfy this morning is the lord jesus christ whether you're on your feet or you're clapping or you're shouting that's secondary to me being sure that i'm pleasing him i'm not here to please anybody this morning but him and if he is pleased with you and if he is pleased with me then he promised to do something about it because he even when jesus was there he said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and we want to please god we want to be genuine christians we want to be genuine daughters we want to be genuine sons we want to be genuine believers we want to amen so you may be seated so this morning i kind of want to talk to you a little bit i have a burden on my heart and the lord kind of been dealing with me and it's something else when you know you may be trying to you know think of something you want to share with the church but it's very different when the law just drops something that you know is from him and for the people for that particular point in time so this morning i was up early and then this just dropped down and i have to follow what this leading is you know and uh it's been a burden of mine for some time as i've watched and i've sort of hinted it for some time that a lot of people have gotten casual a lot of people have taken things for granted they take church for granted they take preaching for granted they take prayer meetings for granted they take the internet connection for granted they take life for granted they live life in such a way that they believe that tomorrow is promised to them that's how much for granted they take it they take their understanding for granted they take their knowledge for granted and one of the deepest truths you will ever come to know is that you do not know what you do not know and that is what is scary because when you speak to somebody who has been through some stuff and they say if i know how is it if i would know now what i if i knew then what i know now that's it i would make different decisions they could look back through the passage of time and they could look either with regret or with disappointment and these things because they now have more visibility into how things work if you choose to isolate yourself in the corner somewhere and choose to ignore what's happening around you it doesn't change the fact that change is happening around you you ignoring what's happening doesn't change the fact that it's still happening you turning your back on what is taking a place in the world doesn't change what's taking place in the world anybody with me this morning and so it is we have allowed ourselves to get casual we have allowed ourselves to take things for granted we take bible readings for granted we take the prayer meetings for granted we take for granted that when we wake up in the morning that our lives will unfold a certain way and that kind of really pushed me to how many people will really make it and that's the greatest burden of this whole message and the purpose and what it is designed to achieve it's to pull our people out of this world so that they can make it i want to make sure that we're on the same page with that because church is not the objective even knowing the word is not the objective the objective is to know him so for a title this morning i want to speak on to know him is life to know him is liberty branham said that over and over to know him is life he said not to know the creed his life not to know the doctrine not to know the bible not to know he said not even know about him but to know him is life and the real question is do you know him not not do you know the message or you know the scripture you know the stories or you even believe but to know him is life can the church say man we do so many things without knowing how things will turn out there's so many things we don't know we make deals and not know the outcome we jump in a car not know what was going to happen or what will happen people come to the marriage vows to get married and they don't know if the vows that they are taken will be kept for a lifetime people move from house to house move from area to area to live thinking they're making a better decision or or whatever it is and there's a lot that we make decisions on without having a full knowledge of how it will unfold there's a lot in this world that we don't know you go back a hundred years 200 years they knew less than than we know now there was a time they thought the earth was flat there was a time you thought that the only way to eat food was to light a fire outside but now you have electric stoves and you have microwaves and you have different technologies and the bible says knowledge will increase but the crazy thing is with all of this knowledge and this scientific discovery and the advancement of all these things somehow people can't figure out how to know god they are more books than ever they are more bibles than ever they are more websites they are more theologians they are more analysis than ever but people don't know god they know about god you could go online and search through the prophet's message you could read all kinds of different things but that is not knowing god that is not a personal experience with god and that's what i want to get to this morning do you know him because to know him is life there is a cost for not knowing there's a price for not knowing what you do not know will be used against you that's the world in which we live in today so i want to talk to you a little bit this morning there's a price to not knowing how to be a father there's a cost to not knowing how to be a wife there's a cost to not knowing how to perform in your job what's that cost after a while the boss will say it's time for you to go because you don't know enough it could be that you were there for so long and didn't improve your skills and suddenly you find yourself obsolete because you don't know not knowing could be a problem a big problem not knowing what your children are doing is a problem not knowing what's happening in your house is a problem not knowing what's happening in your own life is a problem can we bring it home this morning there are people here today they don't even know what's going on with them what's happening with you because what you do not know about yourself is the problem when people backslide it doesn't happen overnight sometimes the deaths don't realize that they're getting lower and lower and every week and if you don't know it and you don't realize it you'll find yourself one day separate from god cut off from god come the church say amen there's a cost for not knowing there's a price for not knowing i have some scriptures i'm going to lay a background i'm not going to be too long with you but i want to encourage you this morning because we want to know him many people know the church they know scriptures and and they believe that's enough because any time you do something that's outside the world it shows you don't know him do you know his nature do you know his being do you know his attributes do you know what pleases him do you know what motivates him do you know what draws him nearer to you do you know what he's doing do you understand him do you know him can the church say amen so i want to speak a little bit about knowledge knowing and knowledge and you know we use three omni words to describe god omnipotent as an all-powerful omnipresent meaning he can be everywhere an omniscient and that word omniscient means all-knowing there is nothing he doesn't know he knows the past he knows the present and he knows the future but our minds and the condition that we are in we cannot know all the past we cannot know all the present and we can know all the future the only certain things we can know and only the things that which are revealed to us really belong to us anybody with me this morning but as we begin to live and move from as i was a child i speak as a child and understood as a child i'm talking this morning not not preaching yet i put away childish things it meant that paul was realizing that there was a progression that he was going through that was moving him from not knowing and not understanding and not being able to speak he said when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as a child i acted like a child but when i became a man i put away the childish things in other words his understanding was different as a man than when he was a child his knowledge was different as a man than when he was a child his behaviors were different as a man than us when he was a child anybody with me this morning so it means that your understanding should be increasing your knowledge should be increasing your wisdom should be increasing your revelation should be a great increasing your expectation for this should be increasing your passion should be increasing the more you know about god the more you love him the more you know god the more you worship him the more you know god the more you pray to him [Applause] there are a lot of things you could forget but don't forget god you can forget the formula pythagoras theorem that's all right but don't forget god don't forget him in the morning don't forget him in the middle of the day don't forget him in the night don't forget him before you choose the response you give back to somebody because all these things matter all these things are important when somebody is speaking on behalf of somebody else you could only do it from a position of knowing them if i have to speak on behalf of brother ovid i cannot do it without understanding what he wants because if i'm to be in alignment with what he wants i have to spend time to understand what he wants so that i will not leave you in a different direction to what he wants anybody with me this morning and so too with the power that is being given to adopt its sons these sons must know him well enough to do what he wants can the church shame and anybody with me this morning so i want to start a little bit and touch a few scriptures if that's okay with you we would have done we would have touched this before in chronicles here it was a young solomon seeing the challenges that he was going to face seeing the obstacles that he had to deal with seeing the challenges that we all have to deal with he started praying and he said to god give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before these people for who can judge this thy people that is so great and god said to solomon because this was in thine heart and thou has not asked riches wealth or honor nor the life of thy enemies neither yet has asked long life but has asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself that thou may has judged my people over whom i have made thee king wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee and i will give thee riches and word and honor such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee neither shall they any after thee have the like but i want to reach down into the fact that solomon knew what to ask for he wanted wisdom and he wanted knowledge we're building somewhere this morning in job 36 verse 3 jobs that i will fetch my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my maker in other words i want to get my knowledge from from not the textbooks of this world not from the professors of this world not from the school teachers of this world but i want to know how to live i want to know how to act i want to know god's thoughts on the matter i want to know what he wants for me and the only way i can get the full insight of that is to get to know him i want to know what oh come on now anybody with me this morning is there anybody wants to get to know jesus [Applause] oh hallelujah the closer you get to him the better you know him the closer you get to get to him the better you understand him [Applause] listen to david in the book of psalms have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge in other words don't they know who eat up my people as they eat bread and call not upon the lord proverbs 1 7 the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction we're building into something so knowledge and the knowledge we're talking about this morning which is building into knowing him the fear of the lord is the beginning of that knowledge so now i look at people and say do they fear god because if you don't fear god you're in trouble the more you get to know him the more you fail the more you love him the more you get to know him you can't tell me you know him and dress how you want you can't tell me you know him and sing what you want and and go where you want because you don't know him because his his thoughts on everything is important to people who know him if i send you to buy something for me you will want to buy what i will want the only way you could do that is you have to know what i want if i tell you go and buy a lunch to me you have to know what what i like to eat or what they don't like to eat because if you don't know me you can buy what i want so when jesus was at age 12 he said i must be about my father's business so he understood the father's business and was acting on the father's business so this whole gospel this whole message all of the bible of the world is to bring us to know him so we could move with him act like him move live with him i have a few scriptures i hope this is okay with you this morning proverbs 1 22 how long his simple ones will he love simplicity and the scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge fools hate knowledge of this word they hate the knowledge of god they don't want to know about the god of judgment they want to know just the god of blessings but god is a god of judgment and blessings you have to know that he's a god who keeps his word you have to know that the arrow of god's deliverance has already been shot you have to know that judgment has already been proclaimed on this earth and if you know that that is taking place how desperate ought to be to be how ought to be to live how ought to be to act can the church say amen proverbs 2 6 for the lord give it wisdom out of his mouth commit knowledge and understanding so when god speaks he's giving knowledge and understanding he wants you to know him and he wants you to understand him every service you come to it's to get to know him better and the more you get to know him better is the more you understand him better and that's when scriptures become a whole new thing to you add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and the temperance it takes a whole new meaning to you because you get to know that's who he is that's his nature that's his being that's his attributes that's what i want to be like that's my goal that's my desire that's my motivation [Music] i'm not saying don't study i'm not saying don't go to school but when all that getting get understanding and get the knowledge of god and not just the knowledge of god but know him who is more unable to take you to your child more unable to take you through your situations more than able do you know that he is more unable to bring you to adoption do you know he is more unable to bring you to perfection do you know that he has fire this morning to burn the snake in your heart that's holding you back from your breakthrough this morning do you know he's able to deliver your children do you know he's able to heal you this morning so if you know he's able to heal you why should he dead why sit you confused why sit you wondering if he is still the god of armies why sit you wondering if he's the same yesterday today and forever do you know he's a god of judgment do you know what you did yesterday it's important to him [Applause] do you know him do you know him not know the pastor not know the preacher not know the church but do you know him he's an awesome god he's a powerful god he's a merciful god do you know him you might know his mercy but you don't know him you might know his love but do you know him because to know him is life and we're gonna get to how we get to know him because it's not knowing us and just had knowledge but it's an experience it's a relationship it's an encounter with god it's not just the knowledge of scriptures but it's you having an encounter a spiritual experience where he's now inside of you so it's not an external conversation but he's in me oh hallelujah can the church say man come on young brother come on young sister if you know him you will be careful with who your friends are if you know him you will be careful where you go if you know him you can't just mischurch services if you know him you can't answer back your parents if you know him as once you love your wives if you know him wise he will reference your husbands if you know him you'll tell everybody about him oh come on now somebody preach back to me do you know who i'm talking about this morning oh do you know who i'm talking about i'm not talking about a man i know he's more than a man they said what manner of man is this do you know hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah i've said it before people know all kinds of things and people they know what they want to know you know people know what they want to know i say right here and truly that people spend so much time analyzing the election and analyzing u.s election during that election the election on the street whatever it doesn't matter and they know everything but they don't know him they know what the prophet said but they don't know him the measure is not your knowledge of the message is to know him it's not to know even about the prophets to know him because the prophet was pointing to him come on now let's get back to basics have you met him because when he walked many knew about him but didn't you realize who he was but for those who recognize that it was him to them he was their power come on now we're going to get it in the in some quotes but ibrahim said he was described to them in so many ways and the pharisees didn't realize that it was him they were reading the descriptions all along by the parents and they didn't realize that what they were describing for all these years was there they didn't know him oh come on now they knew about him they knew him in the word only they knew him in the letter only but when he walked on the streets of nazareth they want to know who this is even to accuse him of being with babe with blg bob that's how backseating they were but there was a woman who had an issue with blood she had spent all of her money i don't know who spoke to her if she read a newspaper i don't know how she found out he didn't have no social media but she knew who he was and she told herself if i could just touch the hem of his garments i'm going to be made whole nobody could dissuade her she didn't need encouragement and she could not be discouraged she didn't need to be motivated and she could not be demotivated because she knew who he was she knew who was on the earth and she got to church that sunday morning and there were a lot of people around jesus but her knowledge of who he was and what she was going to get was enough to make her go past the deacons go past the ushers go past the elders go past the ministers until she came and contacted jesus jesus had to scream out who touched me [Applause] [Music] she knew that she knew that she knew if she could just get to jesus everything will be all right do you know in this message i want to touch on four things not knowing knowing about knowing and what you're supposed to know people move from you have to move from a state of not knowing you in the world you didn't know something caught your attention walking on the street somebody gave you a book you didn't know but abandoned call it spiritual amnesia you didn't know where you come from like joe battery be reminded where was that you didn't know all of us came from not knowing even you're groping church you don't know because this thing is a revelation revealed to an individual and god has no grandchildren so you move from not knowing and typically you move to knowing about so you know about the miracles you know about revival you know how it used to be you you know what god did but you don't know him yet you know about the holy ghost you know about being filled you know about being adopted you know about the cripples walking but until you get your experience you don't know him anybody with me this morning i don't want to know about him i want to know him i want to say i met him for myself he came into my living room i was i was on my knees one day and i felt as oh come on now somebody it wasn't a book i was reading but i felt a presence and i could now say i know him anybody with me this morning elisha was minding his business doing what he did best keeping the plumb line straight he knew about god he knew about the miracles but when elijah dropped the mantle upon him and he felt something later he would come to unless and it wasn't the mantle but it was the god of the mantle so he had an experience that experience is able to sustain him past the critics past the schools of the prophets [Music] you see when people fall away it's because there was no experience it's the about phase anybody with me this morning i have a few more scriptures if that's okay are we doing for time i don't want to be too long with you personally press on proverbs 8 10 says receive my instruction and not silver so solomon is comparing instruction to be more valuable than silver you know why because with the right instruction they could find silver but if you get silver with no instruction you wouldn't know what god wants you to do and he says and knowledge rather than choice gold so not just knowledge rather than gold you know brother eclipse but choice goal the fine gold that that knowledge is more valuable than choice gold proverbs 14 7 go from the presence of a foolish man when thou perceive is not in him the lips of knowledge he talking shoppiness what you there trying to get from him the moment you perceive that the lips of knowledge are not in him go from his presence because you want to be speaking to people who have the lips of knowledge and not just any kind of knowledge but godly knowledge anybody with me this morning listen to this one if this makes it clearer proverbs 15 14 the heart of him that had understanding secret knowledge but the mount of fools feed it on foolishness what are you feeding on what's motivating you what's pushing you and there are many scriptures are going to skip some of them but isaiah 5 13 therefore my people have gone into captivity because they have no knowledge do you have the discipline to read the word every day do you have that discipline it's a real important question what you don't practice for you can't prepare for you can't deal with it there are principles in this world that are unbreakable if you are olympia and you're going to prepare for the olympics there's a regimen of training that you have to commit to to be good because success and achievement is not accidental winning is not accidental there are no accidental victories it is too competitive there's too much effort and sacrifice going into making it and the world tells us to meditate on the word day and night that's not some days but that's day and night every day to have good success and that is success in every way spiritual success family success relationship success financial success marital success what you do not know will hurt you the more you know the better decisions you make spiritual knowledge and not just spiritual knowledge knowledge about simple things how long will you go saying i don't know i don't know i don't know nobody ever told me that could have worked a hundred years ago but now have all information is available you don't know how to do two plus two check online they'll show you google it but don't just sit there and say i don't know what did the prophet say about something well i don't know brother i said what did the prophet say you know you can search it you know you can search in a message yourself right so before you ask me what he say research at first and bring the quotes and let's have a conversation around it anybody with me this morning people don't want to do homework they don't want to do any work i may have said it in a bible study the root word for work and worship is the same word so your work attitude is the same as your worship attitude so worship is work and work is worship that's why the bible says whatever you do do it unto the lord even if you're a slave do it unto the lord because your work is part of your worship it's a work ethic god is looking for it's an attitude to getting because you have to add to your faith virtue you can't sit and expect virtue to come you have to add it and add knowledge and add you have to add it it's on you to do it it's not unto the preacher to give it to you you have to work so may this service give you the knowledge to know you have to work i'm not going to give you the answers for the exam this is not that kind of exam anybody with me this morning you know there are some exams the lecture can give you the answers this is a practical exam we could tell you what on the syllabus but the examiner is the holy ghost we can't give any answers for this exam the holy ghost or the tutor is there watching your behavior to pass this exam it's up to your behavior we could only give it a curriculum we could only give you the broad strokes of what god said preach it in season out of season not to make you feel good but fear to know the truth because you shall know the truth that's a promise and the truth will set you free and he is the truth so you will get to know him and he will set you free anybody with me this morning so your prayer life is work and it's also your worship reading the bible is work and it's also your worship forgiving is work and it's also part of your worship anybody with me this morning if you didn't know now you know hallelujah and you shall know and it'll make you run and leap over walls can the church say man to know him is life i'm not really preaching today you know i don't know he's having a conversation with the beloved of jesus christ he purchased of jesus christ so that he will grow in knowledge and understanding of this scripture here jeremiah 3 15. in fact before that isaiah 28 9 whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine how long will you not understand doctrine you know i know i know how long you say that them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast so how long you'll eat milk paul say the same thing you know at what point in your christian journey will you grow up and be able to defend what you believe why you dress a certain way why you act a certain way why you live a certain way why you don't listen to certain kinds of music why do one sleep around why you don't fornicate you can't defend your position a nice elementary suffer give me a scripture present your body's a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto the lord which is a reasonable service he says reasonable it's not it's not hard thing to do is that a difficult achievement it's a reasonable service how long will you go wrong saying i know i understand i know i understand he said if any man like wisdom let him ask for it us some strong christians who people could bring all kind of thing to you but you can stand up because you understand doctrine you know who god is you know what the word says you know what the prophet presented you know how scriptures dovetail with one another and when you know these things you could tell the devil where to get off because that is what gave jesus that confidence in the wilderness it is written it is written it is also written he knew exactly where to pull from the repository of knowledge to deal with the situation that he was dealing with at that point in time and that's the least expectation of every christian that you should be able to pull into this bible and pull from there when you have need of something you can pull and you can encourage yourself in the lord like david encourage himself and you can pull scriptures when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit will raise a standard no weapon formed against me shall prosper by his stripes i am healed you need to know these things [Applause] jeremiah 3 15 and i singular personal pronoun will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding so i believe this morning we getting a servant of knowledge and understanding because god wants you fed so that you could contend you know it's not i always say the fifo ministry is a means to an end it's a limited ministry until we all come into the unity of the faith and into the knowledge oh if the word is there again you got to know [Music] hosea 4 6 hear the cry of this prophet my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge talk to anybody who made mistakes and messed up and they say okay i wish i knew i wish i knew if i knew i wouldn't have done that if i knew i would have done something different you look back and watch how you dealt with children or situations and we all have them i have them when we look back and say but if i only knew that this was going to be the result i would not have acted this way you look back and say oh gosh if i knew if i'd spent a little more time if i slow down if i went back to the scriptures and not went and and and i didn't lean on my own understanding and took my approach that i thought was right but when i look back i realized based on the evidence it was not right and when i go to the word i see the answer is there in the word had i known it would have been different but lord help me now to seek your way to seek your thoughts i want to know you because knowing you makes me a better father knowing you makes me a better husband knowing you makes me a better wife a better christian and knowing you gives me a way out oh come on now knowing you gives me a way of escape knowing you shows me how to go lord i want to walk in your footsteps i want to recognize your footprints cause i'm gonna put my foot just where you walk anybody with me this morning is anybody in the house this morning [Applause] hallelujah hosea 4 6 my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge because thou has rejected knowledge you see how hosea puts it they reject it you ever talk to young people and they say don't do this now now i gotta know i know already you don't know why going through and in your day it was so and so and ting ting ting and there's now is we time no one anything rejecting knowledge failing to see the scripture there's nothing new under the sun wrestle with that nothing new it's the same devil and it's the same god it's still the same influences there are only two influences so i don't care if it's the internet if it's books if it's computer if it's scroll if it's a beaten drum whatever it is discern the source of the influence and where it will pull you and for that somebody you can't even read has enough experience and knowledge if they are christian to give you good advice come on young people be more respectful yeah you have a degree and your mama have no levels what does that have to do with it get spiritual knowledge get spiritual understanding get spiritual wisdom and god will bless you [Music] the only scripture the only commandment with a promise and a blessing honor your father and your mother so your day will be long you have your degree but your life's short because you don't understand the principle you don't know there's an old saying to know and not do is the same as not knowing so your heartbeat going through one ears and go through the others and you look at scorn and disdain at the older church people there's only old people as being church really thank you but anthony fix it jesus fix it jesus [Applause] give the devil a chance he will erase the history of this church not just this church not talk about the church the bride of jesus christ so that you don't know that's why it's important you read the book of revelation and read your scripture you know so when the devil come say satan i know when you went against elijah what he did i know when he went against david what he did i know when he went against daniel and the hebrew boys that didn't bow down and if you think that i will down now when i know how they stood you got to be kidding me [Applause] and and you maybe see that then your whole conversation begin to change because now you can continue to push the buttons satan you don't know who i am oh come on somebody help me you don't know who i am because oh you don't hear me this morning god is omniscient all knowing but the devil there are things he does not know oh come on now there are things that you know that he don't know there are things locked up in you that he doesn't know they are facing you that he cannot know [Applause] anybody with me this morning is this helping anybody but albert said many times there's no finishing school you can learn physics you can learn chemistry you can learn biology but there's no school of being a man no school of being a woman there's no school of being a husband there's no school of being a wife you can go and learn to swim you go and learn to play tennis well you could try to learn to swim i try twice field but this bible teaches you how to be a man this bible teaches you how to be a husband to be a wife how to act as a child how to act as an employee how to act as a boss how to do your research how to study to show yourself approve how to save how to live how to forgive how to act how to teach how to discipline how to speak how to interact it's all in there [Music] you may be seated for those of you who know me see this word knowing get something together i read a lot of business books and i've yet to find one as comprehensive as the bible [Applause] i've read books on marriage i've yet to find one as good as the bible i've read books on negotiation i've yet to find one as good as the bible if there's one book you ought to know is this bible and not just know this but the brandon said know the order because knowing the author is even better than knowing oh come on now what i want is an autograph from the author that i'll be a written epistle somebody help me this morning written epistle i want them to write i want them to continue the book [Applause] you may be seated you know what an epistle is the epistle of paul every book there's an episode and he said you will be an epistle that he will write he will write it so don't look at me about my story he wrote my story the vex with my story he took samson through his experience he took david to his experience he took me to my experience he taken you to your experience and he's the author and he's a finisher and he is still writing this morning he is still writing this morning and he's not finished with you that's why you could be in church this morning because he's not finished with you give the lord a shout our praise [Applause] i'm gonna try to find a place to i'm not too far in one third into the message listen to hosea i'm still in the scripture and i have some quotes to get to it later on my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge marriage is destroyed for a lack of knowledge business is destroyed for a lack of knowledge relationships destroyed for a lack of knowledge brotherhood destroyed for a lack of knowledge people in the emotions in their feelings when every decision has to be governed by something so i'll give you an example if you are a lawyer you cannot go to a court of law and make up something what you want for the judge to act on for you to present anything in a court it has to be based on something based on the constitution based on a precedent based on evidence there's a whole stuff so you can't say well johanna i think because i feel this morning when i wake up and there was a chicken outside so i think because of that this case that can't hold water and that's how we make decisions in life you know i guess when i had a bad feeling in my stomach and i had a dream and i feel that you know god showing me something really that's why there was a uranium thumb and many old testament you know you said you had a dream you had a bad feeling you have a talk you have something come bring it in front of your room tommy and if them lights don't light up they're still in here so it makes you cautious with standing and say no no not the urine time the moment you doubt your dream undoubtedly vision you know it's not from god anybody with me this morning so you cannot be a lawyer and make decisions from your top of your head they say well where's the legal case what what article are you quoting what section where's your reference point you have to have some article section b when a policeman gives you a speeding ticket he not say well because he was speeding i feel to give no he said article section something something something is what give me the authority to give you a ticket because if there was no authority and context to give you the ticket i can't just get a ticket just so so even in trinidad with this whole corona viral situation they couldn't just say give people a chance for not wearing masks they had to go and make a law to now create a system of technology a way to say okay we can give a ticket based on x and this system that exists here is based on a system that exists elsewhere because god has laws and he uses words covenant covenant is a legal team they are covenants and they are contracts he swore by himself anybody with me so how you intend to fight your battle and you don't know the articles and sections to defend your case because the articles and sections is the scripture so that's why i remember the branham prayed for the man and he came back to get prayed for again he said go and say bye stripes i'm here bye stripes i'm healed by shameless i'm healed what do you say and keep quoting this section until this section and you become one because the man was not familiar with his section he had never encountered the section before he and his section wasn't won but after a while by stripes i'm healed by stripes down hill by stripes on here by extra extra read all about it by striped heel one day he and his section became one and what happened he got healed so what begins to happen when you begin to speak this word over and over until it becomes you and you will become one i shall be healed i shall be adopted predestinated onto adoption by foreign knowledge god wrote my name and listen you in that mindset the devil there he said i give up i done i done he can't get to you no more because your mind is made up he is able to take charge over me i've never seen the righteous forsaken on his seatbelt bread though that and you are in that channel what are you caught in sections [Applause] you may be seated is this helping anybody so now you know that you are supposed to be a spiritual lawyer but isaac where is that the bible say be ready to give an answer to any man that would answer i've said it before in the greek is apologia which means a reasoned defense is not what a lawyer does so you have to give a reasoned defense you could defend it from somewhere even the devil as accuser of the bridge and has her accused in context you know oh listen carefully the devil got this accused you know he has to go into scripture to accuse you because he got his accused out of nowhere he has to find these scriptures that speak about judgment and mistakes and when you do this this is what happens and tell god that that's how we could that's the only way he could accuse you because the law is what said is wrong to lie the law is what says if you bring another god before me that is a problem so when you do your foolishness the devil has a right now they take the same scripture and go to go to accuse you see look they're not doing you tell them pray and they pray you tell them read and look they are reading look that's what i read for you he can't find the bible he think he think it somewhere he think it has confused me where people forget the bible in church and you know confu i'll be confused how your bible in laws are found the decency to get rid of that box that there should be no lawsuit for your bible but it's with a context i know when the devil accuses you of these things no no your lawyer god i don't know find a case don't finish it listen listen i make grace and god has to find only scripture just to cover you until you reach into your stature so that's why when the prophet was there sitting watching the woman and saying and starting to accuse her and say god said listen look at your life and you show him the blood bumper showing how he was dealing with it the blood is what was separating it anybody with me i hope he gets strength no no because we're using the word now as a weapon some of us seen the bible as an inspirational book isn't it it's a weapon it's a weapon of warfare it's a short sharpening two-edged sword it could cut into your situation this morning and bring your child save your marriage give you a new job give you a direct channel of access to god and his blessing and wisdom a revelation to know how to live and how to act it is not semantics it's the reality of it if you could get the wisdom and the understanding to know what this is we're dealing with this morning i'm almost finished i hope this helping somebody i am moved beyond hosea i was telling jose i am rich i have reached a message yes or no i actually have this section i mean the title of the section is called background my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou has rejected knowledge i will also reject thee look at god's responses that thou shalt be no priest to me seeing now has forgotten the law of thy god remember i say don't forget i will also forget thy children who is there six six for i desired mercy and not sacrificed and the knowledge of god more than burnt offerings burnt offerings is the type of just rituals so you're coming to church and you feel that is it so you're coming to church i come to the church you know but you know but you don't know him he said i much rather the knowledge of god than the ritual you have to come to church but the objective of community church is to know him his nature his being his attributes prophecy habakkuk 214 for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of god as the waters cover the sea just a few more scriptures first corinthians 1 5 that in everything ye are enriched by him this is this is paul's declaration of a blessing that in everything all you are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge ephesians 3 19 and to know the love of christ which pass it knowledge so this is this is now going beyond just the knowledge nobody love of christ to know the love of christ is to know him you know because he gets in contact with his love now not just in knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god look how we tie it there isn't that beautiful to know the love of christ which pass it knowledge it passes our finite understanding how his love could be so great even when we messed up so many times oh do you know his love no greater love than this that you might be filled with all the fullness of god i said this for but i have the scripture here ephesians 4 13 places the fire full ministry in its role of knowing god till we all come in the unity of the fate and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ philippians 1 9 and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in judge in more in knowledge and in all judgment because you can't judge without knowledge you know imagine you are a lawyer defending a case and they put a judge up there who don't know the law that whole courtesy breakdown that is why typically the judge was a lawyer before and they get elevated on the bench because they are proven and they recognize your fear and listen but you can't be a judge and you know the law see what um what law is that um hold on what was that what was that and we read that scripture in philippians yeah doubtless i count all things but loss for the excellency the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i'm trying to wrap up shortly colossians 1 9 for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you unto desire that he might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding let me skip through i have two more pages of scriptures so to know him is life and we spoke about four things not knowing knowing about knowing and what you're supposed to know and not knowing can be negative it can also be positive in context from a negative perspective lot did not know that he would lose his family he didn't anticipate it he took it for granted that they were strong enough because they were in abraham's house he thought that the foundation that they had in abraham's house was enough to sustain them and they didn't realize because the bible said and i preached this before that it vex righteous lot he was redeemed in the new testament with he said it vex right so lot himself wasn't caught up with what was going on there but he lost his family i've seen many people make decisions leave church and now there's children the family everything mashup because they didn't agree with something and and now you look at the ears and see the consequences everybody of the church did not know he was going to lose his family the people in noah's day thought they were right they didn't know judgment was over them saddam and gomorrah they didn't know that it was over already judged samson didn't know that he was going to lose his eyes then we could switch not knowing into moses didn't know that he was born a deliverer gideon didn't know he was a mighty man of allah but in each of these situations they went from not knowing to knowing and the knowledge of what they were born for changed their whole life and their destiny and their purpose so you can't keep operating as if you didn't know because if you say you left the world and coming to church and you left not knowing into knowing i expect a change in behavior from how you were when you didn't know to know that you know you can't be behaving like you didn't know anybody with me this morning was that who i that's who i am and who i grew up well then you didn't leave yet because you have to leave it behind you you have to be really scripted forget any things that are passed there are some things that cannot be part of your conversation anymore and there are things that is not the holy ghost of the worst noise you have to make a choice did not do it reasonable service speaks to your discipline you know there are people who i know who not christian and have discipline and there's not no spirit driving them they just make a choice to eat healthy to do certain things i remember being in university and there were young ladies in university who will tell you they're not having sex before they get get engaged and in my into marriage and and they were not christians what is your excuse there has to be a change when you know if you know putting something in your food is unhealthy for your heart you never had condition why are you putting it it's best willing to tell you because if you intend to do what you was doing before before you know you know you have high sugar and it has to be drinking soft drink if you buy you're ready you're ready don't you ready no you know the only solution dicey solution now because these are simple things you know but it just goes to show how difficult choices and discipline and decisions really are because will is like a muscle will is like a muscle so it takes will it takes focus it takes decisions to live every single day to have victory and you know something interesting victory is contagious so victory in natural and victory is spiritual is all victories so when you even makes it a natural decision certain spiritual decisions get affected as well you know because it shows you lack the ability to make good decisions we think so i have decided to follow jesus it's a decision you don't want to decide to take sugar out your drink when you're not supporting it we're dealing with the measure and character of a man now the temple of the holy ghost what you can do to remain healthy is your responsibility i tell you we go and find the devil wherever he is on buddhism you can't show it because you're just tired because you need wrong things you're there feeling sluggish every entire in church get some vegetables stop eating complex habakkuk carbohydrates appreciate myself to her do it i know what they say no no no no um all of us under the edge of everybody's breathiness this morning one time with anthony sing a song there noma numa numa didn't reach him i just had him no part and i said but wait no shouting on the heels of glory listen you have to be able to jump and shout we shall have a grand time up in heaven jump on shoulder and sing around you there you can't move two things you're done tired already what are you doing in the show taking your car really jump out but his decisions i'm trying to bring a point about decisions saving is a decision playing around with the world is a decision prayer is a decision they're all decisions and it's important because god made a decision to come to you to come to me and he has the discipline to stick with his decision let us do the same i have decided to follow jesus no turning back no turning back you could take the whole world but give me jesus [Applause] let's try to find a way to close out is this helping anybody this morning i said it's a conversation with you is that you could grow and you can meditate because listen people are jumping and shouting i see people jumping shout and they're nothing churchill because the grounding of what it takes to survive the devil playing games you know while we're here here they're planning this whole week you ain't want to plan you can plan your week for you i could pull scriptures on planning how god went to plan you think the devil don't understand where the balance said he knows the bible better than you and i you know you don't have a plan you don't want to pray you don't want to meditate how we expect to have victory and sustainable victory not just a operative but sustainable victory you want to be beating the devil every time blows blows blows but abraham said it a man could live in such a way that he devil just get get fed up with him and walk away you could live such a lie that he never leave you alone that is a point where the devil come and he just waiting for him like you don't even you don't have to raise your hands when i was younger i was doing a little martial art training i always said keep your hands up keep your hands up keep your hands up because you don't know when he had come in after they're walking wrong so but the point was if you stay ready you'd have to get ready so when he so when he devil come and he take you off your guard like joshua that's what joshua was joshua was like are you forced against us he said well i'd leave my bible in church sunday no he was ready he said are you fools or answers let's bring this so close musicians get ready so moses didn't know he was born a deliverer gideon didn't know he was a mighty man of allah jahazi didn't know that it was more for him than against him saul thought he knew god but on the road to damascus he realized he didn't know god and god met him and introduced himself to him and after that encounter he changed from saul to paul and he could say i know him and he could write the entire new testament can the church say amen so goliath did not know that there was a david who was raised up to deal with him oh hallelujah pharaoh didn't know that when moses left and came back it was the end of moses of pharaoh's time can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i'm trying to find a place to close out here oh blessed be the name of the lord and when you know you have to do better you cannot just know and not do better moses knew he was supposed to speak to the rock but he ended up striking the rock so he knew what was right but he did something different to know and do when you know you have to be prepared to do so david after his experiences he knew god was with him joshua knew god was with him so he could say son stand still moon hang over angelon job oh i don't have the time to go into it now but job knew at first he didn't know what was going on he didn't know it was god having a debate about him he didn't know god was boasting about him he didn't know god was there cheering him on and say no matter what you throw at my servant job he is not going to curse me job didn't know these things but if god had to remind them where was it all and at the end of it job looked at this condition looked at the situation and said i know my redeemer limits oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah i spoke about this from the message spoken with his original seed i'm wrapping up listen close now how different jesus was in his day from the denomination of his day they would point back to him how i'd like to hold on this for a while they would point back over their shoulder back down through time and say we are moses disciples we knew that god appeared to moses that's knowing about in the burning bush we know he said they know the history of moses but they didn't know the god of moses because he stood before them in john 6 and said before moses was before abraham was i am hallelujah they knowed moses history so is it today they claim they know the word of christ but they don't know that god was in christ oh hallelujah my oh but iran said no i feel like david whining that sling up now i hope i don't seem sacrilegious to you jesus could and did say the father that sent me is in me and as he has sent me so sent are you to his disciples the father that sent me is with me if i do not the works of the word promise of my father then don't believe me because they are the ones that testify of me let me say this if god don't vindicate this to be the truth but if i'm speaking about himself then it's not but if god vindicates i'm telling you the truth then believe the word jesus said i know you you think you know moses you know might have known history of moses but you don't know this god for i was before moses they couldn't see it because they of their father the devil but abraham said oh hallelujah and i think that that reflects again and he wants to pass this way if a person ever meets jesus and finds him really in your heart you entrusted not only in your own household but the household of god everywhere you are interested that they know him and to know him is life know him see not know to read the word also but know him is life oh hallelujah and christianity is misrepresented to people christianity has been represented the people as a declaration of creed christianity is a living being jesus christ the resurrected god that's alive and among us now christianity is a person not a creed to know him is life not even know his word that isn't life know him and he is the word look how the prophet place it not just don't know where people know scripture and they're doing what they want but to know him he is the word yes but you have to know him because to know him is life oh hallelujah hallelujah listen to this now and this would encourage you but ibrahim said a fellow said to me not long ago you came in and played something softly a fella said to me not long ago uh i was just discussing what we taught about a certain scripture in the bible and this fellow was quite a scholar he said well you just don't know your bible he said it to the prophet you imagine the one who tied up all the loose ends reveal every mystery and this color telling by the random you just don't know your bible i said i know the author real well hallelujah so that's the main thing if i know him he will take care of the rest of him to know him is life hallelujah glory in feast of the trumpets but abraham said daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know you see is he now they shall know their god now now how shall you pay in the last days is to bring the people back to the wood so it is true the word we could get access to knowing him oh hallelujah so that the bride will know her husband i'm reading the prophet her meet the revealed word that's why this has to happen and last quote church wherever you are what you belong to makes no difference but there's one thing you must know you've got to be in christ or you're dead you can't live outside of him your church might be all right as a building your fellowship might be all right as a man but when you deny the body the blood the word of jesus christ you're dead the minute you do it it's god's chosen place of worship there's where his
