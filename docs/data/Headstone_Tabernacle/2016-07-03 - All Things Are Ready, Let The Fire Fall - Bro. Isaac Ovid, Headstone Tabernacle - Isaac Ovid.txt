way my love let Give the Lord one more hand of Praise In The House of the Lord this morning he many many many many many many many many my my my my my so are you ready for the word this morning amen so let's take our Bibles we're going to go to one portion of scripture this morning taken from 1 Samuel 1st Samuel 7 I'm reading from verse one 1st Samuel 7 and reading from verse 1 and the men of Kad jerro Rim came and fetched up the Ark of the Lord and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill and Sanctified eleasa his son to keep the Ark of the Lord and it came to pass while the Ark abod in Karim that the time was long for it was 20 years and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord and Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel saying if ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts then put away the strange gods and asteroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the land of the Philistines then the children of Israel did put away balam and ASAT and served the Lord Lord only and Samuel said gather all Israel to mesp and I will pray for you unto the Lord now mesp is a city of Benjamin it's a watchtower it's a lookout where the children of Israel will meet in great National emergencies so it's a conference place it's a meeting place it's a high mountain where they meet and they gathered together to mesp and Drew water and poured it out before the Lord and fasted on that day and said there we have sinned against the Lord and Samuel judge the children of Israel in mese and listen carefully and when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to mesp the Lords of the Philistines went up against Israel and when the children of Israel heard it they were afraid of the Philistines and the children of Israel said to Samuel cease not to cry unto the Lord Our God for us that he will save us us out of the hand of the Philistines and Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt offering holy unto the Lord and Samuel Cried unto the Lord for Israel and the Lord heard him and as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering the Philistines Drew near to battle against Israel but the Lord thundered with a great Thunder on that day upon the Philistines and discomforted them and they were smitten before Israel amen and the men of Israel went out of mispah and pursued the Philistines and smoted them until they came unto Peta then Samuel took a stone and set it between mespa and Shen and called the name ezzar saying hitherto had the Lord helped us so the Philistines were subdued and they came no more into the coast of Israel and the Hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel and the cities listen carefully which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel from ekron even unto Gat and the course thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines and there was peace between Israel and the amorites and Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life and he went from year to year in Circuit of bethl and gilgal and mesp and judge Israel in all those places and his return was to Rama for there was his house and there he judge Israel and there he built an altar unto the Lord may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the word let us bow our heads once more Heavenly Father Lord any man could read the scriptures but Lord it takes the Holy Ghost to breathe life upon it may you speak to our hearts today and open our understanding to the word as we prepare for this convention Lord this last service before the meeting father may we be under expectation may we get our houses in order Lord may we be ready this morning for a great outpouring we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated this morning Hallelujah my my my my my my my my my Something in My Heart hallelujah hallelujah my so for my title this morning all things are ready Let the Fire Fall Hallelujah all things are ready Let the Fire Fall s is this the time for the fire to fall s is this the time for the Holy Ghost to pour out s is this the time for our Revival we have talked about it we have preached about it but I believe this is revival time this is bride time this is seed time this is manifestation time somebody say amen and what does Revival mean it means freedom freedom from the oppression Freedom From The Bondage freedom from your sickness freedom from being up one day and down one day freedom from looking back to your past freedom from wondering what's going to happen the Revival means restoration it means taking back everything the devil took from you doesn't matter how long how much time pass when the Revival breaks out that's your time to get it back it's your time to get back your joy to get back your family to get back your peace to get back what belongs to you you don't hear me this morning the Revival means Redemption it means going back to your original condition back to your original state back to your original Glory because when God saw you he didn't see you in this form he saw you where was down when I laid the foundation of the earth you had a body that didn't get sick you had a body that didn't get tired you had a body that didn't get sad because you were made in His image can the church say Amen the Revival means a super church I'm not talking about headstone Tabernacle I'm talking about Christ's Church I'm talking about his church I'm talking about his bride no wonder but the brandom said a super Church a super race as we near The Headstone he's not talking to your flesh he's not talking to your mistakes he's talking to your genes the genetic structure that comes from God and the Revival is to bring those seeds to life to remind you that you are not from here but you come from somewhere else to remind you that we are one day closer to the Rapture one day closer to the resurrection don't worry Andrew I'm just warming up I'm just testing the temperature a little bit because we are getting ready for something we are getting ready for another Ephesians uh we already in Ephesians but there's another dimension of Ephesians there's another wave that's coming I will ride this Trail once more it's all right to jump uh it's all right to shout uh but there's promis of power to come into the church there's coming a power a supernatural element that still remains uh despite the Revelation that we have held all these years there's a supernatural element that remains uh that could break the chains of the world off for you that you could come into the house of God and in one Service uh you could worship in one service you could shout because who the son of man set free is free indeed hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah a Revival means the Holy Ghost has got to pour out because God has to pour it out because that's how God expresses himself uh because God is a spirit so for him to multiply himself uh he is obligated to pour out the Holy Ghost he said I'm never going to leave you I'm not going to forsake you but I'm going to send another comforter even the spirit of Truth he will come oh Hallelujah my my my my my my my my my are you ready for Revival a Revival means Victory a Revival means no more a Revival means alanas a Revival means dancing like David dance a Revival means singing when it don't have a voice a Revival means speaking in tongues when he you don't hear me the Bible said the dumb will sing they went beyond speaking the Bible said the dumb will sing just talk they're going to sing they're going to shout they're going to worship my my my my what are you doing brother Isaac I'm placing the seeds for what you go about to happen I'm placing the seeds for what you going to expect why because the Revival could only revive the seeds that have been planted so if the seeds are not there there's nothing to revive and if you getting ready for seven Revival there's got to be some seeds inside your soul it could be buried under some dirt this morning I don't care the condition I just got to make sure that the seeds are there because the rain is about to pour out the Holy Ghost is about to pour out it doesn't matter what it doesn't matter what your condition is once the seed is there every seed must bring forth after its kind so if we speak seeds of healing that seed has to bring forth after its time if we speak of seed of Revival that seed must that seed must bring forth you may be seated oh so what are we doing this morning we are making sure that all the seeds are planted we are making sure that all the seeds are in you making sure that you know what to expect so when you come this weekend and the rain begins to fall my my my my my overnight like Aaron's rod in the holies of holies that Rod was just there for one night one night one night in one night by the next morning that Rod was blossoming that Rod had fruit all you need with God is one night one night in the presence of God one night with the angel I'm not going to let you go until you blessed me I'm not going to let you go until my change comes I've come too far I've fought too long I've went too many services I've believed a message for a long time but all I want is one night with Jesus Hallelujah my my my my Hallelujah oldfashioned sin killing sky blue Holy Ghost Revival that's what we're talking about this morning a Revival means that all that Adam lost comes back to the manifested sons of God the whole world is groaning the nation is groaning the trees are groaning the economy is groaning the United Nations is groaning the politicians are groaning Los Angeles is groaning but Los Angeles got to wait on something to happen the trees have to wait on something to happen the politicians have to wait on something to happen they don't know what it is but we know what we worship we know what they are waiting on they are waiting for us some manifested Sons to come back into position Hallelujah you may be seated you see what people fail to understand is that nothing could happen before it time nothing could happen before it time because God is a god of order God is a god of structure one time with the brandom I saw a vision of going to pray for somebody and he went to the house and he prayed and I believe the baby got sick or something like that and he realized that he went ahead of the vision that there was a old lady who had to be there in the vision and he had to wait until she came and her glasses had to be in a certain spot and she had to be seated in a certain spot because that was in the vision despite the fact that he was the prophet he could not go ahead of the vision because the vision is for an appointed time do it t wait for it you can rush it you could pray all you want to you could hold on all you want to but the vision is for an appointed time and the prophetic Vision as laid down by Malachi 4 is for an appointed time it cannot happen before it cannot happen after but when the appointed time has come it has to happen and I believe we have come down to the appointed time for the bright 7th under Revival oh Hallelujah I feel like seei on this morning I'm under expectation because I have a promise I'm not going to see death until I see the Lost Christ and although Simeon was old he held on to his promise he had been a Believer for a long time but he held on to that promise because God spoke to him and I believe if you're here this morning it's because God spoke to you because you couldn't come this morning unless God draw you first so I believe this morning that we are here because we have a revelation that there's a power coming to the church and that now it's coming in h spoken word power Redemption power healing power it's coming into the church it's been here all along in word form but now the ministry of the spirit the Dynamics is all over you this morning can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my my my my my so Simeon he knew that Christ was coming so he couldn't see Christ in his house he couldn't see Christ in the shop he couldn't see Christ in the grocery he couldn't see Christ in his bedroom he knew that Christ had to come to the temple so he made it his business every service he was there at the temple and he was getting a great joy every service because he knew that Christ had to come to the temple there was no other way about it so every service that passed he felt better about himself because he knew the god that spoke to him does not lie he knew the God who spoke to him is a god of his word he knew the god that spoke to him doesn't make any mistakes he had a promise and every service he will come is this the day is this the day and he will be waiting is this the day is this the day is this the day is this my day is this my day that was Simeon he was under expectation he was never late because he didn't want to miss messah he never left early because he didn't want to miss Messiah he wanted to be there for every minute because he knew Messiah had to come to the temple and I believe this morning there's somebody in the building who knows that Messiah is in the temple this morning Hallelujah I'm just laying a foundation this morning hallelu Hallelujah gory so what do you looking for this morning this is not about being in church it's not about a group and the more that I look at the word is the more I see that people have missed the fact that it's an individual Affair you have to come to the convention and it must be about you let me say that again I'm not saying don't pray for your brother don't pray for your sister but it must be about you because you got to make sure you get your portion don't you leave without your portion every service you come it must be about your portion you have to be selfish about your portion you have to be aggressive about your portion because the Bible said the law and the prophets were until John but since that time the kingdom is preached and every church every group know the Bible says Every Man Press into it friend or no friend group or no group church or no church but every man makes it his business to press past doubt to press past fear to press past what people say about you why because you want to see the prophecy fulfilled can the church say Amen you may be seated amen amen my my my my my so Simeon had a revelation yes that he will not see death until he see the Lord's Christ and we have a revelation that we going to get the Holy Ghost we have a revelation of a perfect church we have a revelation of a super church we have a revelation of individuals that are being called out to form POS of The Headstone to connect with the Corporal body we have a revelation of a time of honing of a time of of shaping we want it because we have a revelation can the church say amen and Revelation puts you in a mode for Preparation because you are under expectation you cannot tell me you are expecting something and not making preparation for it you are lying to me but if you are expecting something then you will start to make preparations for it can the church say amen and brother Bram said in influence we know the quote but I want to make sure we have it what we have seen happen over all these years should put every soul into action it should make a church that would make a Revival here in Trinidad we got to say it right that people would fly in from Europe to see what taking place they'd say there's a place in Trinidad a city called sangri Grandy we got to claim it we got to speak it every church has every right to claim it I'm claiming it for this church that's my responsibility can the church say Amen there's something broke out there until the seven thunders of Revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the Bible is being manifested can the church say Amen from the message it is the rising of the sun brother brandom said there's been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but there has got to come one Hallelujah there's got to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but Dynamic so in other words the identification of a true church is not the pastor it's not what you believe the identification of that real bride is got the mechanics and the Dynamics let me say that again so the true church is not identified by your Doctrine it's not identified by your teaching it's identified by mechanics and Dynamics because the Dynamics could only come to confirm the mechanics amen the Dynamics cannot come upon anything else other than the mechanics can the church say Amen makes the church live move in the power of his resurrection my from the fourth seed God's word sharp two-edged sword slays him puts him right down wait till them seven tunders utter their voices to that group who can really take the word of God and hand it there it'll slice and cut they can close the heavens they can shut this or do that whatever they want to Glory why are you saying this but is it because there are people who still don't believe this and they in the message and the people sitting in church who happy to be in church but they don't own a word so that Revival that we're talking about must be clearly identified because you cannot be part of a 700 Revival if you don't know what it is if you don't know what's the promise if you don't know what we are doing can the church say amen amen so a Revival is to revive the seed that planted in you so the seeds had to be planted the devil knows this so his only move was to plant seeds of error but the bride cannot be deceived I thank God we have a revelation of say what the tapes say so God had to wait for all these years until all things are ready because only when all things are ready the fire could fall can the Church Say Amen from the message condemnation by representation brother bam said no wonder God can't send a Revival he's got nothing to build it on then he'll take individuals and build it on them individuals let me say that again he will take individuals and build it on them individuals and declare them before the world who stay with that word amen so it's only individuals I'm talking to this morning amen and and situations have come and will come to see if there would be individuals who would stay with that word and I've said this before Paul was very clear Hallelujah because but over and I were having a conversation this morning and in speaking we he used the word you must be more sincere and I said you know that's that's one side of it because there are people who are sincerely wrong that's right yes yes yes yes yes amen amen so you see people they go to church and they worship and they shout and they jump and they are sincere believing that what they are worshiping and shouting and is the truth they are sincerely wrong so being sincere is not enough you have to be sincere about what's right and it's not about what's right for you it's about what's right for God there's a difference because God wants his word interpreted his way brother Brandon preacher God is his own interpreter you ever heard that before now whenever you have somebody interpreting a language if you takeing English to Spanish or to French or to another language there are different kinds of interpretation there are different words that you could use to express it and still don't get the original meaning so it's always a blessing to see somebody preach who is bilingual because sometime the translator says something and he says no no no no no no no and he corrects the translator because he wants to make sure what he is communicating is getting to the people so God is multilingual and he is his own interpreter so when he is speaking he is confirming his own word are you with me this morning because God listen man always have good ideas you know come on I told young people sometime ago I have great ideas but whether my ideas are in God's plans is a different story but God is his own interpreter and only God can vindicate his word we cannot vindicate his word he has to vindicate his word he is the one doing the work you know we are not the ones he is the one to confirm the work but the B said if God is to do anything anything it's by the grace of God because he is Sovereign it's his grace no wonder the headstone will come with shoutings crying Grace Grace Grace Grace because if it was how much time and how you do this and that half of you not going to make it but it's the grace of God that you could be called to a seventh under seven SE revival can the church say Amen so I want to touch on something here because in what hearest thou Elijah but the B say we can testify and jump up and down and sing and everything like that but until God makes us in such a condition till we can recognize one another as brothers until all malice Envy strife and everything's gone out of us our jump in shouting praising God organizing speaking in tongues Healing The Sick even going to signs and wonders and Performing Miracles and everything else will never amount to nothing let me read that one more time but BR said we can testify and jump up and down and sing and everything like that but until God makes us in such a condition till we can recognize one another as brothers until all malice Envy strife and everything's gone out of us our jumping shouting praising God organizing having conventions speaking in tongues and healing the sick but Bram lays it out flat he said the sick could be healed Miracles could be performed it will never amount to nothing until there's love because charity will never fail you may be seated so I've heard people talk about how much jumping and how much shouting and how much testimonies and you can't forgive your brother nothing I don't want to hear it oh you don't hear me this morning I don't care how much jumping jump on one foot jump on the other foot jump on both feet jump on tiptoe and you can't love and you got jealousy take that testimony and go and Pray Again take that testimony go back to the altar give me charity because jumping will fail knowledge will fail that's what Paul taught us and Paul said If any man any Angel preach anything else let him be a curse I'm preaching what Paul preached and William Brandon preach what Paul preached Hallelujah you may be seated so God's thermometer is not measuring your shouting and your testimony and how long you're in the message his thermometer is a love thermometer because God is love that's what he identifies with and love forgives and love hugs your brother lugs have no oughts love has no grudges love loves the fellowship love loves the Brethren oh you don't hear me this morning that's the seven T Revival hallelujah hallelujah we have to keep the main thing the main thing amen because it will amount to nothing if the right foundation is not set people have all kind of testimonies you know how many people wrote tremendous testimonies over the years and they're not in church you can't see them you can't hear from them you when you say God bless you they say how you doing because it was not a real experience there was no testimony and they never met God because God is love brother K said paper testimonies but what we want is a lived voice you don't even need to write it brother Raymond you don't need to even tell somebody but the it speaks for it you don't need to publicize it you don't need to put an announcement about it you just walk and devil have to fly off the corner fly off the walls because that's what Jesus is he's love so when he's walking all the demons have to scatter because l o v is walking down and that's what we need that's what we need in Jeffersonville that's what we need in Trinidad that's what we need around the world lived voices that's the Thunder that shakes the devil can the church say Amen what are we preaching this morning we are in another Ephesians that's what Ephesians say you will understand you will know where you come from you will know where you're going you will know what your promise is amen hallelujah hallah let me drop this in here I didn't plan to do this today but I was meditating and I shared it with my wife I shared it with brother over as well I said we read Ephesians six put on the whole armor of God and people shout and they jump and it's wonderful Hallelujah but that scripture sort of makes people assume that they have no armor on because to put on the armor you can't put the armor of God on top of your own armor am so to put on the armor of God you got to take off your armor because an armor is meant to defend you it's meant to protect you and people come to church with their armor to protect them they don't want to talk to nobody they don't want to greet nobody they don't want no problems with nobody they don't want nobody tell them anything because this is how I am that's your armor you are protected there's no room for the armor of the Lord because you have your own protection I've been this way for 10 years that's your armor this is how I worship that's your armor this is how I used to do it I've been in the message for 20 years you have your own armor but for you to put on the armor of God you got to strip everything your feelings your Revelation people have re that they give themselves strip your God didn't give it to you because his revelation will only confirm the word you holding on to Revelation that is off the word and telling me God give it no God doesn't lie and God is not the author of confusion he is God and he loves things to be clear he's a god of clarity so he wants you to leave here with a clear purpose a Clear Vision a clear plan of what what you are supposed to receive that fire is going to come down in your soul and burn the snake out of there that he could Tabernacle himself behind 16 elements somebody say amen I want to read this quote one more time because I think a lot of people missed it Hallelujah we can testify and jump up and down and sing and everything like that but until God makes us in such a condition Lord make me into that condition till we could recognize one another as brothers not your church my church your ad Doctrine my church your pastor your until all malice Envy strife and everything's gone out of you our jumping shouting praising God organizing speaking in tongues and healing the sick and Performing Miracles and everything else will never amount to nothing amen amen Lord help us to be sincere about the right thing brother the brandom said if there's a ought in your heart against anyone sinner or saint sinner or Saint you are in danger of Hellfire he didn't ask how much books you read how much Revelation how much Visions or dreams he said there one out against a sinner or Saint you are in danger of Hellfire but I thank God for a revelation of the blood I thank God and when he looks at us he sees through the blood and if because of the blood he could forgive us then we have no reason to hold anything we could forgive because forgiveness is the key to Faith is the key to the Holy Ghost pouring out if you get every ought every Grudge every malice Envy out of here you know what's going to happen in 5 minutes there' be not one sick person inside the building in five minutes there' be not one person Desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost Oh My My My from a message of blushing Prophet what we need today is not social regeneration it's not intellectual talks what we need today is a oldfashioned God sent blood transfusion from Heaven the corn plasters won't do no good we are anemia we need a blood transfusion we need to come back to the oldfashioned gospel that calls out for repentance before God and not a drye hand shook profession but a God sent Holy Ghost Revival with the possession of the cleansing of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ into every human heart we need a Revival to start in the church and sweep the nation across we'll die we'll perish we are gone without that type of Revival amen why are you saying this brother Isaac because if we don't clean up before the convention you will not get out of the convention what you want to get out of the convention there's some stuff that you have to do because God is not coming down to our level brother brandom said we have to come to his level you will be in a service and see other people blessed because you didn't do your part am can the church say amen amen so let me jump to the text this morning in first Samuel 7 we see that Israel is at a place where they need Revival amen by 1 Samuel seven they had been attacked they had been overcome and they had been defeated by the enemies the Philistines amen and in reading through the scripture we talked about the amalekites they pray on weakness they are the Hittites the hites they different ones the Philistines are a unique breed because but the brandom typed the Philistines as the personal demons so we're not talking about what other people do in you we're not talking about you falling out with a brother we're talking about the personal demons the ones that you carry with you wherever you go your personal struggles your personal battles and he says it'll take the adopted Sons take the pillar of fire to drive the Philistines isn't that the word amen amen so the children of Israel found themselves in bondage of the Philistines after they had wor through Egypt and come out of Egypt and come through the Red Sea and going through Jericho and had Victory after Victory and their ups and downs here it was like a cycle the children of Israel are now in bondage of the Philistines and and as a result of this the Philistines had taken possession of the Ark of the Covenant the sacred Ark of the Covenant which held among other things the tablets upon which The Ten Commandments were written on when Moses went to the Mount and met with God it was this Ark of the Covenant that would go before them in battle yes that's right to cross to Jericho Joshua's instruction will let the Levites walk in the ark the ark had to go forth first give it room because it is sacred it's holy Hallelujah the Ark of the Covenant was known throughout Israel and Beyond but during this time in Samuel that we read Eli was the high priest and if you read scripture Eli was a corrupt high priest his son run a mock through the church doing all kind of fil and foolishness and God was so displeased and God had to raise up Samuel Eli was so out of the spirit that when God was talking to Samuel and Samuel ran to Eli Eli was no I wasn't calling you and they went back and forth but God had a purpose with Samuel because Eli's time was over at abzar the Philistines had defeated Israel in 1st Samuel 4 and the Philistines put themselves in Array against Israel and when they joined battle Israel was smitten before the Philistines and they slew of the Army in the field about 4, thousands so when Israel were defeated the Israelites fetched the ark out of Shiloh and carried it into the camp they were not living right but they tried to bring the ark yes the word and try to bring it as a as a PCH to their problems and once again the Philistines attacked Israel and smold them with a very great Slaughter and 30,000 of the children of Israel died and in 1 Samuel 4 the Ark of the Covenant was taken away when Eli heard this that his sons had been killed in battle Eli fell backward and broke his neck shortly thereafter Eli's daughter went into labor and died after giving birth and in 1st Samuel 4:21 before she died she gave the child the name ikabod which means where is the glory and she said for Israel's glory is gone Hallelujah and she named him thus because the Ark of God had been carried and because her father-in-law and her husband were dead so the children of Israel were trying to understand how things could go wrong when they had the ark back into the battlefield and at this point the enemies of God possess the Ark of the Covenant they possess the sacred Scrolls they possess the most valuable treasure that the Israelites possess but they will find that trying to handle the word when you're not supposed to be handling the word will bring you more harm than good from 1 Samuel five Affliction came to the Philistines they placed the Ark of the Covenant next to the idol of deeon in deon's Temple and a couple days later by the pop World deeon fell face down before the ark the heads and hands of the idol was broken and lying in the doorway the people of ashdod when the ark was around them the in the nearby Villages they were a inflicted with humors because you can't take something sacred and leave it among people that are Unholy the children of Israel were backslid but it was still God's Ark of the Covenant you can't mishandle the word and try to do what you want with the word so the moment these things had to happened those of the Philistine but the Terry who had the ark say take the ark away from him send it to another Philistine City because this Ark brother the Thompson is causing problems they moved the ark to the to to gath and at GTH the Lord struck them with a plague of tumors so they start to move the ark from God to the town of ekran and the Bible says on the way to ekron the children of is of eon saw it coming I said don't bring it here don't bring the ark here send it back to Israel because we can't handle it too much fire too much anointing too much word too much promises we can't identify with that send the ark back we should have never take it and that's how the devil is going to be concerning your promises give them back the joy give them back the peace give them back their promise it doesn't belong to us it belongs to them you may be seated who did that God is his own enforcer so you think the devil took your joy and peace and God not doing something about it God will force the issue you're going to see your joy just coming back you don't know why you're so happy but the devil can't hold your joy it's too holy the joy of the Lord is your strength he don't know what to do with it it's your strength it's got to come back to you you may be seated so when the villagers of Arron came outside the city brother punch with their placards and they started to protest we don't want the ark we don't want the ark the time were forced to drop the ark right outside the Israelites and just run away because they didn't want nothing to do with it and the Ark was taken we read in the scripture to car jerim which is about 7 and 1 half miles Northwest of Jerusalem and there the ark remained in the house of abinadab and was guarded by his son Eleazar and now we arrived to chapter 7 and that's where I want to really come to this morning because now we have an interesting turn of events Israel had backslid they lost the ark because of their backslid condition and now God restores the ark now the ark is a type of the word the type of the Lord the type of The Commandments but now the ark is restored and when we read Samuel 7 they have been holding the ark for seven for 20 years for 20 years it's been restored for 20 years the ark has been in their holding brother the kangali but there's no joy in the camp there's no Revival in the camp for 20 years they have the books and the tapes and Arc is in place under lock and key the billers and the caretakers let me read it I don't want you to think I'm making this stuff up Hallelujah and the men of karum came and fetch up that's 1st Samuel 7:1 the Ark of the Lord and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill this is a place of safety and Sanctified Eleazar his son laid hands on the brother to keep the Ark of the Lord and it came to pass while the ark in Karim that the time was long for it was 20 years and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord so when the T the word has been restored the ark has been restored the builders and the cakers have it on the lock and key but there's no Revival there's no outpouring there's no manifestation and the people are crying and the people are sighing because they know something else is missing despite the word despite the Revelation a supernatural element still remain they have the ark they are in their land but there's no joy there's no peace there's no Victory they don't have all that is there the Philistines oppressing them they up one day and they down one day and they crying Lord for 20 years now it's been restored but where is the god who delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt but where is the god who delivered Jericho into our hands can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel saying if you do return to the Lord with all your hearts then put away the strange gods and asot from among you and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve him only he will deliver you out of the hands of the Philistines then the children of Israel did put away Bim and ASAT to see it here now the word was restored but they were still fellowshipping with b and still fellowshipping with with ASAT and still playing around with the world and still doing worldly things but then the Bible said the children of Israel put away bam and ASAT have you put away the unclean things in your house have you put away the unclean things in your life and they serve the Lord only but that wasn't all after they put it away Samuel said gather all Israel to mespa amen and I will pray for you unto the Lord and that's why I said this morning this morning is our mper because before the convention we want to pray unto the Lord that he restore that he deliver that he cleans up so that when you walk into the convention you are walking in Heavenly places and before the convention is over your son is walking in your daughter is walking in what is that it's your land being restored because we are into battle listen skipping now a few verses and when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to misper the Lords of the Philistines went up against Israel because the devil knows whenever you come to church there always a possibility that that day is your breakthrough day that a word will be spoken to set you free completely and that you could do what you have never done before but I love this the children of Israel said to Samuel seek not to cry to the Lord for God Our God for us that he will save us out of the hands of the Philistines and as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering the Philistines Drew near to battle against Israel but the Lord thundered with a great Thunder on that day upon the Philistines and discomforted them and they were smitten before Israel and I believe right now that's happening right now through his word God is thundering thundering to the Philistines thundering to your personal demons thundering to doubt and to fear and to unbelief and to push them back and the Bible say the Philistine were subdued and they came no more to the course of Israel in other words after this Victory the T the Philistines have no more room because it's all restored to you your joy is restored your family is restored your inheritance is restored your land is restored no room for the devil restoration time Holy Ghost time revival time can the church say amen and they push back the enemy so friends that's a condition it takes for a real Revival amen these were God's chosen people and God didn't create a shortcut for them that's right they had to cry they had to seek they had to pray they had to clean up they had to put away the ungodly things but the B said and any man that believes God and takes him at his word no matter what the situation is God will perform another Paradox to keep his word so when Samuel was speaking to the house of Israel Samuel was God's man Samuel had been chosen for a specific task and we have received a prophet who was chosen for a specific task and we have the word we have the promise now what are we doing about it there must be a realization this morning that we have to return unto God not just in word but in sighing and in crying and repenting there must be a removal of all the strange gods in our lives how much time we spend on the job how much time with of our family it's a real thing friends it might sound simple but what good is it to come and jump and shout and then go back and do the same thing you did before because a change has to come that's right how long will you come to church and go back home without a real change when you have the opportunity today to go and sin no more because the angel of the Lord is here to meet you at the point of your need I'm not talking about a Revival as a church now I'm talking about you as a an individual in your personal Revival your personal prayer closet your personal time with God knowing that every day that you spend crying and sighing you are pushing back to works of the enemy I'm not talking about worrying and fing I'm talking about a real oldfashioned Lord God I need you this morning that's the condition that God is looking for to say all things are ready God couldn't come to deliver the children of Israel and until all things were ready so when he said I've heard the cries of my people and I've come down because all things are ready and I've come down to deliver and there are people here this morning that God wants to deliver you God wants to restore you you've been living any kind of way for the last few months for the last few weeks or whatever but somewhere along the line you lost your joy you lost your peace you've been distracted but before this great convention God has called us to mper for another time to cry and sigh and say Lord Lord you said If my people will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways we're going to hear from heaven we want to hear from Heaven it can't be just another service it has to be here from God is there anybody in the house this morning who wants to hear from God is there anybody in the house this morning you're tired of being sick you're tired of being up and down that disease that you have we have to serve it notice and we got to do something about it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated I'm not talking about the work up I'm not talking about just you doing something because other people doing it but I'm talking about you catching a burden for your house you catching a burden for your life uh you catching a burden for a spiritual experience you getting desperate because God is speaking to you it takes God to fill you but are you desperate to be filled with the Holy Ghost it takes God to deliver but are you desperate this morning to be delivered are you desperate to be changed or do you want to go back home the same way that You' have been coming it's not just word only but the gospel is in power and demonstration and we're looking for power and demonstration this morning to deliver the captives to set you free if my people will humble them themselves and pray prayer is the key but the pr said we could sing too much we could preach too much we could shout too much we could sing too much but we can never pray too much if you want to see something happen this weekend then you begin to pray right now you begin to pray every day this week you begin to shake heaven doors and say Lord you promis a Revival you promis Deliverance uh you promis a visitation to the young people Lord I need you I've been in church where long time but I don't want to be just a church member I don't want to be a church goer I don't want to just be an attender I just don't want to seat but Lord pass me not oh gentle savior Hallelujah Glory oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah from the message invisible Union of the bride of Christ brother the brandom said brother let's get all things ready for one of these days the fire is going to fall we are going up now let's get ready for the fire falling time he said we in the last days we all know that and we ready for the coming of the Lord the thing to do is listen separate yourself from all sin separate yourself from anything that pertains to the world don't love the world or the things of the world Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory can the church say amen hallelujah Glory why you kneeling this down brother Isaac why because you could have all the quotes but people are living in the world people are still struggling with their personal Philistines but this morning we come to expose them so that you could go free you could go free and you could walk into here without condemnation and you could walk into here knowing that there's a provided way for you to be healed to be delivered to be set free can the church say amen amen amen amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah we're getting ready for this war friends it's a military operation and we must have military preparation all these years we have been under military preparation by the ministry of the word every service is pointing us to get ready get ready for this spiritual battle and we are waiting for the Dynamics we are waiting for the Thunder of God to finish the battle but while we are waiting we are cleaning while we are waiting we are preparing while we are waiting we are sanctifying ourselves Joshua told the people sanctify ourselves because in a few days we are going over we have not been this way before listen in this season when the Holy Ghost drops down what is Promised is a church that sin cannot stay in it it's a church that the sick cannot stay sick it's a church you can't just walk into and go back home no no no no no no no no no no it's a church that's going to be a holy church because a holy God will move through the church through individuals in the church can the church say Amen so this is not the time to run this is not the time to hide this is the time to hold on to the halls of the Altar and say Lord I don't want to miss it that's what they were doing in the upper room they were holding on say Lord you promise the Holy Ghost they were saying Lord you made a promise I'm not going to let you go until you bless me I'm not going to let you go until my change comes and while they were worshiping while they are praying while they are praising then come a song from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled the whole house uh where they were setting that's the way I feel this morning to see the Holy Ghost pour out inside of this church to part in this convention can the church say amen amen the musician good get ready thank you hallelujah hallelujah from the message Jehovah Gyra but B said may this be a great time just now for all things are ready the word has been preached the songs has been sung and the Holy Spirit has confirmed his presence Lord let those who are needy tonight and I say this morning let those who are needy today reach up by faith and receive Christ for what they have need of yes brother BR said no matter how many preaching there is and making a valley full of ditches how many vision there are the subject was then and the main principle was make ready for the water get the ditches dug that's what we got to do tonight is to make way for the Holy Ghost to pour down make it in your house make it in the church make it in yourselves kick everything out of the way get ready there's coming a gusher if you'll get ready for it if you don't make ready for it you will never see it you could begin to play something Softly Hallelujah but R went on to say and when it gets to the place that the people that love God will throw everything they got right into the Revival with prayer and with everything else and see God's face and pray and seek God and call out in the hours of the night for mercy and get the neighbors saved and so forth I tell you we'll stop the mouth of every critic we'll knock down every formal thing that's standing up and they'll have to know that God's been in the camp and that's right friends we'll never do it until that takes place let's all stand to our feet begin to play some things can we bow our heads in a word of Prayer you begin to talk to him right now begin to rededicate your hearts to him right now we're going to take a few minutes to just begin to pray and begin to talk to God and we want to begin to say a special prayer for the convention is coming weekend that the Holy Ghost itself will just keep pouring out and every day this week it'll keep building and building and building to a mighty visitation of the Holy Ghost that this island will never remain the same that this church will never remain the same and most importantly that you will never remain the same again come we bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your blood we thank you for your grace for your mercy we thank you for your precious Holy Ghost that's here this morning Lord and Heavenly Father Lord I
