the land of the living father Lord that way we could pour Our Praise on our sacrifice of praise and we could Lord walk in this great light of this message of the hour Lord your Center Prophet Lord Lord be son of Manville and a son of man to point us Lord to this word that was Lord close this book that was sealed but Lord through a prophetic message and Ministry of a seven seal seven Thunder message we could walk plainly through the word and we could see who we are and more importantly whose we are father Lord we come this morning with a burden for your church for your people for the young people for The Killers for those that are tired those that are wary those that have been in the battlefield for a long time and Lord those that are Lord may be in the beginning of their Journey whatever fears in the journey we may be in this morning may you speak to us don't mean you take me out of the way and speak lip to air to your children may you bless the word bless the reading of the

Lord we thank you for the power that's working in the world and the world being the conduct of the spirit for the spirit to bring life and healing and Liberty to point us from Faith all the way to charity love me you speak to us in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen and amen thank you brother Anthony what an inspired song service thank you musicians what a presence in the house of the Lord this morning I certainly want to greet brother Ovid and the Services the last few Services might tell you every service such a blessing the prayer meetings the Wednesday night services the Sunday Services every wrong going higher and higher it's just a sign pointing us so we're gonna leave here Victorious we're gonna leave here on fire we're gonna leave here with the Holy Ghost We're Gonna Leave Here adopted We're Gonna Leave Here perfected We're Gonna Leave Here shouting and jumping and praising and worshiping and we're gonna leave with our families oh yes we're not gonna leave anybody behind Hallelujah when Pharaoh reached the point of frustration he said take your cattle take your people take your flocks take everything on gold and I believe we are coming to that season where the devil will say just go take your family go take your flocks and go take it and go because we're gonna frustrate the devil before we leave this place but the Branham taught us that you know but Abraham said a man can live in such a way with God that the devil doesn't know what to do with him that's the kind of testimony I want to have that the devil say I don't know what to do with this one I don't know what to do I tried this he still worship I tried that he's still in church I thought he was going to give up but he's still in church I turned this against him but he's still in church Hallelujah I took his job but he's still in church I cut his pay but he's still in church he's sick this morning but he's still in church he get cussed out last week what he said in church things didn't work out for him but he's still in church I don't know what to try again I don't know what to do about it but he's telling the house of God Hallelujah reaching a place where nothing could move you nothing could shake you nothing can make you backslide nothing can make you give up nothing can make you recant nothing can make you give up your testimony whether you're up whether you're done whether you're sideways whether you're in where you're out oh what can separate us from the love of God it's a reality to our souls can the Church Say Amen so for a brief time this morning in the presence of the Lord do have two portions of scripture when I read from the book of Nehemiah chapter 4 and reading Ephesians chapter 6. for a scripture reading this morning Nehemiah 4 I'm reading verse 14. Nehemiah 4 and verse 14. and I looked and rose up and said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not here free of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses and reading Ephesians 6 reading verse 10 a very familiar scripture finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that he may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places whereforeth take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and haven't done all to stand therefore having your loins good about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shut with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith weareth he shall be able to quench all the fiery dots of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord I have a title this morning taken there from the script to be read in Nehemiah 14 4 14 fight for your brethren your family and your houses fight for your brethren your family and your houses and just for some context we do have a burden today special burden for the church but in particular we have a burden for the young people and for the young children as this week some tomorrow some the day after but within the week or so everyone is back out to school and the reality is as you look at what's happening around us we would be foolish to deny the reality that schools are not where they used to be schools are no longer just about education and Mathematics and Science and sociology and social studies and these things but many of the things that our young people learn come from the school they conduct their behavior their attitude children grow up in homes and they don't know about disrespect and using certain words the way that they do in a Christian home but when they go to school they start to use different words they come home with attitudes they come home with behaviors they come home singing songs we didn't teach them they come home using words we didn't give them and that's not just school that's in the job that's in the workplace and as they progress through age it gets worse and worse until sometimes we look at them and we wonder what happened along the way and we sometimes didn't realize how as time progressed we started to lose our children as time progressed we started to lose the connection we had with them and the few hours we may spend in church on a Sunday or Wednesday or prayer meeting really cannot mathematically compare with the time they spend with their school friends and the time they're spent in the workplace the time they spend with others who are not of your conviction and persuasion and Revelation and belief and you realize that if you don't have the right conversation with your children somebody out there is having it having some kind of conversation and if you are afraid to confront the real issues of Life they will be confronted with the real issues by somebody else with another agenda and before you know it the home that you taught was protected is no longer protected the home that you thought was covered is no longer covered because Windows have been opened and doors have been opened that you thought you left shut for many of us who grew up under the feet and we had our experiences many years ago there were things that we have cut off from our appetite we have lost the appetite for certain things but unless somebody has an individual experience they have to go through the experience to lose their appetite and if they're appetite and were over preach it on Wednesday night if that nature is still a pig it doesn't matter how much you love to pick up the moment the door opens that pig will go back to the mud it's the nature of the picture desire the mud and as I'm watching and I'm looking and I'm reading and I'm watching and I'm looking and I'm reading and I'm seeing what's happening I say God what's going to happen the prophet when he was here looked around and said is this the kind of world that my children have to grow up in and that was how many decades ago what about now the stuff that we did not know at age 10 children know at six at five even four the things that parents guarded your eyes and guarded your conversation until you were a teenager they know at nine or ten at 11 and 12 and we'll be naive to operate as if it's business as usual when the walls have been broken down and the walls have become rubble and the reality is yes there's only so much we could do but we could only do all that we could do let me say that again we cannot be with them a parent came to me not from church a parent came to me a couple days ago with a situation with their 12 year old daughter he's in tears he's broken and I said to him you cannot be with her all the time you could only do all that you could do and the question is have you done enough how much raising of your children was left to YouTube or to movies or to games or to others who don't share your belief it is still a responsibility because we are stewards we are not owners we have a responsibility to train up a child in a way that they should go so that when they become older they will not depart but the Branham taught us that he God Don't Make halfway Christians but a Christian could be halfway he don't make halfway preacher but a preacher could be halfway parents could be halfway and children could also be halfway there comes a point where there's an acceptance of responsibility where the children could no longer say its appearance because if you have reached that age of accountability then you have to give an answer for how you speak in school and what you do in your neighborhood and what you watch on the internet and is anybody with me this morning so all of this has created a conviction in my soul to fight to fight as we have never fought before to fight differently to fight even if you have never been a fighter we are being challenged to fight [Music] and we read that scripture there in the himaya and I looked and Rose up and said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not here afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses hear it can the Church Say Amen I'm building into something this scripture we read in Nehemiah 4 we would have done this in a Bible study some time ago and the background is this name I was a Jew he was a Jew in Babylon as it was in shushan the palace and he was The copier The copier is a trusted role The copier is the person who tastes the drink before the king drinks it so ensure that nothing kills the king so you're putting your life on the line but it's also a trusted role because if you you are the one that if you wanted to poison the king that's the only way the king can get poisoned so it's a position of trust it's a position of confidence and it is interesting to realize that instead of having a Babylonian that Babylonian King had a Jew in that spot it meant that you had to have such a testimony that even though he was not in his environment he still had a testimony a testimony of trust a testimony of confidence a testimony that he would have the ability to be that close to the king and they would go on and we don't have time for it this morning that the king realized that he was sad one day and he was sad because he had heard that the walls in Jerusalem had been broken down he was sad because the people of Israel had been scattered he was sad because things were not the way they were supposed to be he was sad because the walls were destroyed and the people couldn't Worship in safety and they couldn't praise God and in other words Holmes were exposed marriages were exposed houses were under attack and you have to realize that right now we are under attack and unless we choose to fight back we will remain under attack with the Enemy gaining ground [Music] the Bible says every place you put your foot is yours so we cannot wait and say well we waited for God to fight for us we have to fight could I get a little more on the microphone please we have to fight we can wait until the enemy is inside of our gates for us to defend Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so Nehemiah he caught a burden and his burden became his calling and he shared to the king that listen I need to go I can't stay here anymore the job is good the peer is fine I know you have confidence in me but my family is in trouble my brethren is in trouble my neighbors are in trouble my Kinfolk are in trouble and I'm not willing to sit here in my comfort zone like like Esther could have stayed in here and see I'm in the palace I'm fine and Mordecai said to her how do you not know that for such a time as this you are in the place that you're in and the question that was asked Esther is for such a time as this and if you don't get involved then God will bring deliverance from somewhere else but something has got to be done and I want to call out to the parents this morning let's do something let's do some do something but let's do something the devil is after your marriage let's do something about it the devil is after your children let's do something about it the devil is after you let's do something about it the devil is after your business let's do something about it the devil is after your worship let's do something about it the devil is after that brother who's next to you let's do something about it the devil is after your wife let's do something about it he wants to destroy your children he wants to pull him to Hell let's do something about it he wants a moment your child goes to school he pulls him into a different world let's do something about it it's time to fight for your brethren fight for your family fight for your houses it's a call to war a call to declaration the Bible says in the Book of Ecclesiastes there's a time for war and there's a Time For Peace I'm saying peace is over this is not the time for peace it is time to peer up arms arms for your family arms to your Revival every place you put your foot is yours can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah Hallelujah we are declaring a state of emergency we are declaring a time of War we are not going to go home this evening as we came We're not gonna lose one I'm tired of losing young people I'm tired of losing and see marriages broke up I'm tired of seeing people who are on fire you can't find them no more because the devil knocked them out there's a cause this morning isn't there a cause this morning oh Hallelujah are you willing to fight for your family are you willing to fight for your brethren are you willing to fight for your house Hallelujah when you worship you are fighting Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord every step you take every move you make listen [Music] you maybe sit here for a minute I'm trying to build something and just declaring this this morning means the enemy will be mad because he wants us to operate in a way that allows him to walk over us I want you to understand that this gospel is dripping with blood Moses had to fight Joshua had to fight brother Branham had to fight Elijah had to fight Joshua had to fight David had to fight Noah had to fight [Applause] it's a fight in your school to walk away from the music it's a fight on your job to walk away from the lunchroom Hallelujah fighting is not just physical fighting is not just having confrontation sometimes it's a fight to leave the room and walk away because you want to stay there but because you're a fighter you choose the battle to walk away when Joseph was in Egypt he didn't see his son's tale and see the Salvation no he fought and his fighting had him run away from Potiphar's wife it's a fight do you know the Bible says that when lot was in Sodom and it was time to leave the angel was pleading with them let's go let's go let's go the Bible said to the angel grab lot and pull them out it's a fight the Angels was fighting for lot the angel was fighting for the family are you ready to fight for your brethren your password and brother you know they're in trouble say come on you can make it come on you could be healed come on you could stand you could stand in your school you could stand on your job never has there been a day like this day and the attack is not just one attack when you listen to the way the prophet would speak he would talk about staying home to watch TV and he talked about going out and drinking all the rickies and the rakatas he will talk about all these things you're doing and when you look at what you have to deal with then and now it's so different it's the same spirits but more forms of expression [Applause] the world America was built in a foundation of In God We Trust there is a time where people challenge that's different and say we can't say that no more they are no more atheists than ever people who don't believe there is a God or any kind of God the psalmist David says in Psalm 1 when 14 1 the fool said in his heart there is no God I've seen many young people grow up in the message went to University and left saying I don't believe in God so with all of the education they are fools because it's the fool who said it is no God when we should teach our young people at the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom not your old levels not your A Levels your C second SCA your degree the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom [Music] and wisdom surpasses knowledge at any time and in all that getting get understanding we have to reject what the world wants to normalize that's a statement they make though let's normalize this and let's normalize that the fact that things are being normalized meant it was not so from the beginning [Applause] and we want to know why our homes are broken and why things because we have left the enemy to creep in because our walls have been broken down and if the walls around your home your family your life is broken down we need to rebuild the walls we need to close the breach the only way the enemy can get to you is because it's an opening but if we close the gaps this morning if we close the preachers this morning then there's no room for the devil he can come into your home he can come into your marriage if there's a gap in your life Hallelujah bring back the family prayer let's close that breach Hallelujah through the worldly clothes out of your house let's close the breach or you don't hear me this morning when they went in the Cherry cold Jericho Joshua told them whatever you do don't touch your cursing don't take anything from Jericho don't take the clothes don't take the money don't take the wealth don't take the books don't take the DVDs don't take the movies leave everything in Jericho because everything in Jericho is a curse you know it and they went to war they went to the battle it was AI dentist artificial intelligence now [Applause] I'm not playing games technology will be the undoing of this generation [Applause] [Music] until man thinks they don't need God and they can figure it out and the computers could solve the problems and then every day you get further away from God and you opening doors into your house you close your door at night but your windows are open your roof is open and the enemy is coming in [Applause] coming into your mind coming into your subconscious based on the things you watch the things you encounter and you want to know why my prayers can get to God because in the subconscious level when you asleep at night all the stuff you watch is at war with who you are [Applause] you willing to fight for your brethren are you willing to fight for your family I want to fight for your house Joshua say after me and my house we will serve the Lord is that your declaration listen to fight translate into how you dress the fight translates into where you go the fight translates into what you read the fight translates into if you have a prayer life the fight translate into your worship the fight translate into your fasting the fight translates into being in the house of God the other places you could have been this morning but you fought your way to get here hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord thank you all right we live in our other way it's a fight against the over sexualization of our young people we're in the schools they teach you different family types now coming soon to a theater near you if your school won't have it yet it's coming foreign agendas different things to normalize Solomon gaborah normalize drug use normalize alcohol use normalize violence normalize dishonesty normalize pressure peer pressure normalized I was trying to protect my mental health so I don't want to think stress them out excuses upon excuse normalizing well because I have to study so much is why I can't make it to church when the Bible said what is it Prophet the man to gain the whole world and to lose his soul I will never see a school isn't important but you have to make sure you have your priorities right and it starts from the top it starts from the appearance set in the environment in the home [Applause] [Music] one of the biggest challenges is our parents not doing what they're supposed to do and the parents want to leave it on the school teachers when it's in school supposed to do it on is Sunday school supposed to do it or the church supposed to do it that's why there's a big difference between being a man or being male or being a father and being a a dad or just having a child it's a it's a responsibility [Applause] [Music] social media or the pressure the Styles and the fashions parents how we can expect our children to do better if we are struggling too much we have too much compromises I'm sorry this is not the kind of jump for joy service too much compromises the Bible say right in your heart or your cold let you know be you know if this is the if this is a Christian home then we live by Christian principles either we are Christian or we're not a Christian woman and if it's a Christian home and certain things could happen and certain things cannot happen [Applause] I'm sorry foreign you speak to anybody who has been true or they will tell you if I could have done things differently I would and for those who are walking down the 30 parts of this journey you have an opportunity to do different to do better to ask the questions but even still for those who have walked out there's still a promise of restoration and there's a promise of Deliverance and is a promise of real being rebuilt can the church say amen I don't believe believing him with one person behind who is supposed to be in a Rapture it's my promises unto you and to your children even to them that are far off so it's not a time to be discouraged it's a time to realize that we need to fight we want to fight for those who are here and then fight those who are not here knowing that we're going to speak a word for every backslider that not many days hence we're gonna see them in the house of God not many days and when is God do it you will know it's God hallelujah sister Rana sits he has a testimony you know much he has to surround that was done in church and then one day something gripped her heart and since then your car final outside of the presence of God she'll have her up and down but that's good that's that man nobody forced her not to be here she has a desire to be here and whether you I'm prophesying over your entire house they're all coming back we have to speak it we have to declare it oh Hallelujah but I asked me I prophesy over your house your children will be delivered Hallelujah but a black one I prophesy over your house your children will be delivered hallelujah hallelujah back in the house of God that's God when God is ready for your children nothing will stop them from coming back to the house of God so don't be discouraged prepare for war we want to be ready because every time God does something the enemy gets mad and we are just warming up we are just warming up we are sad yet we are just warming up we are coming to every house we are coming to every half family we are gonna fight five our Brethren fight to our families fight our houses yes brother Matisse your house too yes sister Nicholas your house too yes brother Thompson your house too yes brother punch your house too yes with occurrence your house too yes with a Terence your house too everyone will fight we're gonna put our shoulders to the wheel shoulder to shoulder back to back sword in hand sealed in hand I don't care what the professor says what the lecturer says they have no power over the blood wash ones and okay what happens in a neighborhood I look your body gets her there's power in the Church of the Living God to Break Every Chain Break the jacket of lust of pornography of alcohol of music of drugs a fornication I don't care what it is oh you may be seated Nehemiah he was fine you know he had a testimony where he was but it troubled him what he was hearing about in his city of Jerusalem it affected him so much it changed his countenance he was going to work every day but he wasn't himself no more it was not a sadness that came from the depression of the world it was a forlorn-ness that came from having a burden [Applause] a burden for God's people a burden for broken homes Joy a burden for those who struggled to dress like a Christian a burden for those who struggle to sigh and cry for the Abomination a burden for those whose walls been broken [Applause] the story of Nehemiah is a story of rebuilding defenses and we read in Ephesians to put on the whole armor of God friends without your defense you will be killed [Music] [Applause] put on the whole armor the whole armor but Abraham told us this is the Holy Ghost you know the entire Armor of God can be described as the Holy Ghost [Applause] expression of the Holy Ghost one Holy Ghost taking his position to be your defense the Holy Ghost is your guide the Holy Ghost is your protection the Holy Ghost is your comfort the Holy Ghost is the truth even the spirit of Truth the Holy Ghost is the anchor for your soul the Holy Ghost is the control tower of your heart Hallelujah and where have you ever got an experience with the Holy Ghost it'll give you a burden [Applause] because it's one body you know you're baptized into one body and if you're part of this body if the toe is hurting you feel the pain if the finger is hurting you feel the pain so you can't sit there say well I'm all right no if you're part of this body when one brother in trouble something awakens in you to fight for your brethren fight for your family fight for your house it's not more than one body it's one mystical body could you take some more [Applause] forgive me how much all over the place this morning but I want to just look back again into this scripture in Nehemiah 4. we read verse 14 but verse 14 was a responsive situation and whenever you decide to do something for God like I pray today you make a decision to do something for God not just something but a fight the enemy is going to respond so if you have your Bibles and you can wanna ride with me in Nehemiah 4. verse 1. good to see you brother Isaiah God bless you [Applause] but when Sam Ballard heard that we were rebuilding the wall but it came to pass that when someone heard are we building the wall he was wrought and took great indignation and mocked Jews in other words under nehemiah's pleading on the nehemiah's cry the people realized that they were defenseless and the first way to make progress is to build back the wall friends you need to have a wall in your home a wall on your job a wall in your school without the wall the devil have free clearance or walk in and do what you want to do so sambala tell her they were rebuilding the wall he became Furious completely enraged what do these people choose will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice so you see the question they will ask it in other words he said you you think they really will sacrifice so get his wall back up because in fact they're rich in that condition meant things went wrong and so he was like I don't think they have it in them the sacrifice you know well they revive well uh will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day in other words you think they could fix it in one day will they revive the stones out of the hips of the rubbish which are burned in other words what are they trying to do you see how the enemy looking at you trying to get your house back in order now to buy it ammonite was by them and said even that which they build if a fox go up he shall even break down the Stonewall in other words he's saying listen whatever they do when they're so weak they wasting time you know in other words I will still get them so this is bear in mind now this is what this is the word that's coming to the children of Israel they hearing what the enemy thinking about them and this is the war that even happened in your mind with where he never said what are you thinking you ready to take your break to your rating your son gonna be delivered you really think God will work for you and Nehemiah prayed this is verse 4 hear o Our God for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity uncover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked Vita anger before the builders verse six saw built we the wall in other words Against All Odds against what the enemy is saying against the discouraging statements against people saying you're wasting time going to church against the enemy saying but other people walk away while you're still standing against all their voices about giving up and while what's the use of going to church and what's the use when things are working out for you so built with a wall in other words we're not stopping in other words we're not stopping we might look weak but we're not stop him we might look tired but we're not stop him so build we the wall every time we come to church so built we the wall every time we have a call proper a meeting so built we the wall you drag yourself to church but you put another brick and you put another brick and you put it under a brick and the enemy watching and he laughing but it was another brick every time you left your hand in worship you put another brick so built we the wall your daughter gave trouble but you put another brick your husband act up this morning but you put another brick your wife didn't do what you asked her to do but you put another brick saw built with all whatever happens I'm not stopping I've got to be defended I need the whole armor I'm tired of the enemy coming into my house foreign [Applause] [Music] so this is the lesson right here in the face of criticism in the face of negativity in the face of people saying it's not possible to have a Revival in the face of people saying are you not gonna make it in a face of the devil saying what you did last week what did it last year was it in the face of all of that so built be the wall and all the wall was joined together until the half thereof in other words for half the height for the people had a mind to work Hallelujah in the amplifies oh God give us a heart to work give us a heart to defend our house give us a heart to defend our families give us a heart to cry for Revival give us a heart a heart a heart for the work friends it's working on it's not just sit down and take any Services work it's work by prayer it's work by worship it's work by reading it's work by science it's work by shouting it's work it's work it's work parents it's a work parent in his work being a good student is work and he can have a work another hard for the worker for the people who had a mind to work only everybody you know when somebody just do something versus whenever hard to do it there's a difference between doing it and having a heart to do it [Applause] have a conversation with your daughter your son I talk to them you know you do it because you do it but was your heart in it make things right with your wife make things right to your husband well I tell them sorry you do it what's that it was a heart in it people know it's hearted it you're doing your job and you're just doing your job is it hot in it you know the Bible say whatever job you have do it unto the Lord your heart's supposed to be in it under no circumstances in a Christian still like this working pretty man you know that is not scriptural [Applause] you can't just go to school where I do this school work your heart wasn't it I come to church you're hurting it [Music] there's a different many song leader sings and his heart is in the singing there's a difference between the musician playing and the artist in the plane [Music] [Applause] there's a difference between preaching and your heart and the preaching there's a difference between being a worshiper and your heart [Applause] I'm coming back with a Heart of Worship there's worship and it's the art of worship that's why the psalmist never say creating me a clean heart oh God and we know our right Spirit Within Me I want to have a heart because sometimes we lose the burden for a family you know sometimes parents with your point is at this point whatever happened happiness universe [Music] at this point wherever whoever it is lady better go lie down there yes hot [Music] in fact I get so bad the things we say to our children we speak curses upon them you're going up to nothing you end up with nothing hot in the not any message I heard a preacher I say God help us some people left the church and he prayed in the church he said Lord let those who lead the church let them have no money no health me you sending them into sickness I was like what what he was so upset that he's had to pray said Lord may you bind up their bank account a little basically the car shut down but you know what that is it's a lack of understanding that it's God's people and not his people because he is the shepherd oh you don't hear me this morning on this Earthly represent the shepherd we are all sheep under the great Shepherd but a real Christian you could never wish bad to somebody where they do to do it they do you good to do you evil because somebody had your Vex you pray a lot didn't you trip them up when you tie them up for you and God's saying when you repent come back to me [Applause] he said that's why this Beyonce and drop the order because someone else say you dropped me all but you're wishing parting on people [Applause] anybody in your house [Applause] but drop it that drop it and every time you think about that boy just hope that man I get our promotional but nobody can say no I forgive them I forgive them I just don't want no promotion for them I forgive them I just don't want to see them happy what it took me through like Lord I forgive them but don't make them smile y heart you know because God read in your heart not your lips he said in vain they worship me hot do you have a heart for the young people I'm coming I'm coming to your house you know will my children not in church so I really don't care about your service so because your house in trouble you okay but anybody else house but if you have a burden that's why I said fight for your brethren fight for your family and fight for your houses that you script to be read [Applause] and you will find a secret in there that when you catch a burden for the body the body begins to work for the body and you extending Grace to somebody else God put a burden on somebody else for your house and you can't even explain what happened to your son to your daughter you can't even put it into words because God knows you try everything you could but God's saying is not you to do it it's me to do it anybody in the house this morning some of you God crippled up your blessing because you're too selfish fight for your brethren fight for your family fight for your houses I fight for you you fight for me you in pain I feel it I'm in pain you feel it I'm Victorious your Rejoice you are victorious I rejoice all for one one for all one Lord one said one baptism one body one Prophet one message amen having a heart [Music] of worship a heart for God a heartless people you're an usher in the house of God but is your heart in it everything we do it's reflective of what's in our heart God is so interested in that heart he said that's why when you break the ties and your finger brings saying from your heart not unwillingly [Music] be a cheerful device in your heart somebody asked you to do something you do it but you have much in it that's why Jesus says somebody asked you to walk one mile one is the expectation on a two is heart he asked for a cold give me a cloak too he's open heart in other words going beyond what you were asked because your heart anything anybody with me this morning and I'm raising it because that's crittery red shirt says the wall was only Built for the people had a mind to work or hard to work so this is what we're talking about this morning only happens if we all have a heart to do it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] can we go on Allah says so not quite sure what time we finish it no I know the verse is just I have them notes here too and I just kind of somebody pulling them they're getting heart right you could be in a marriage and a half not to be my original oh God there we go let me go this morning [Applause] may God perform heart surgery you're in church but you're partner in your church you your body your mind but your heart your heart somewhere else verse seven but it came to pass so because the heart was seven because their heart wasn't the thing now they able to build a wall up to halfway halfway is not all the way but they have achieved something by the Anthony they have made significant progress verse seven but it came to pass that when sand ballot and tobiah and the Arabians and the ammonites and the astronauts heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped can we say stop the breaches Hallelujah in other words he's had to close down certain movies yeah you start to throw certain things out of your house little cracks you'd ever like to come in and start to close it up and the enemies have to worry about without trying to go into the house I went in last week but this week I couldn't get in this week I meet a new door when there was no door there used to be a crack there but there's no crack there how we're getting into the oh God somebody help me and the enemy heard that the preachers were being closed I tried to go by Sister Nicholas but he where does go it was blocked up because there was some prayer that blocked that crack or you don't hear me this evening oh anybody in the house this morning [Applause] listen the devil watch in your house more than you watching isn't it because you are bright light going against the current to them Hallelujah but when it came to Pastor when San Valentine to Bayern the Arabians and the ammonites and the asterisk Hood now the walls of Jerusalem were being made up and that the breaches began to be stopped then they were very rough and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it so what do you think you will come to church and shout and jump and feel good on the enemy not works brother Micah you don't think that after God took you through and preserved you are the enemy not mad nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God and set a watch against them day and night because of them and Judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is the key in the Amplified it says the strength of the burden bearers is feeling and there's so much rubbish so that we are not able to build a wall in other words they're making progress but the burden bearers I want us to go through this a little slowly burden bears strength is the kid this is where I want to get to the younger people in church in every company in every family in every Church they are burden-bearers people who do the work people who show up people for whom has more action than talk if you ask for help they're ready to say I will help daddy put mirrors and the Bible said that he wouldn't bear us their strength start to decay who will pick up this Slack who will catch the burden Francis wanting to be the message for this gospel to move on I watch somebody else in the church those have been fighting a long time and sometimes wonder how some of them do it I don't want to give in trouble calling plenty names but I look at better than Hugh Williams if anybody has a burden and whether you they're responding so because I don't even need to finish his statement because your work speak for itself it's not a talk burden there's certain people you see I don't want to get in trouble like holy names and if I call I will reverse on that road foreign but you know who are the birth and it's in homes too you know who will share the burden can I go to the house I see my wife went downstairs maybe it will help somebody but punch sharing the burden if I ask the sisters in the church how much are the house burden the husband's share the Pastor said oh Lord father keep driving around or I should reverse this this one too [Applause] I think nine out of ten wives would say they wish their husband cheer more of the building and if I could identify one of the number one complaints of the wives in the house is that tired because burden bearers get I saw a meme recently when the husband gets sick versus when your wife gets sick when your husband gets sick he curl up in the bed he's sick when your wife gets sick she has a tea really cheer and thing with his thing do this do this cook for the husband cook for yourself and I'm not saying nothing's happening in the church but I'm challenging us to step up and to understand burden because it takes a burden to open the church early it takes a burden to be part of a team to help clean up after the service it's not as any people who are doing that drink five lucozade and a Red Bull before they do that they're tired too but the burden outweighs the tiredness but the Bible says that as they were building the wall and there were certain pointy and let's say listen we tired we've been working in the 70s in the 80s in the 90s in the 2000s we've been doing this a long time anybody with me so it's a salute to the burden bearers but it's a call for who will carry who was shady burden years ago I knew prayer warriors God bless her heart sister Joe for those of you remember this is a joke real prayer Warrior and the testimony said the prayers from those who walked before it's harder to find them now you know the real praying mothers and he will pray in grandmothers who carry the burden because all that is possibly fighting you on your knees will do so much for your children as they go to school going to University let's continue I don't need this helping anybody [Applause] and Judah said the leaders of Judah the strength of the bearers of burden is decayed and there is so much rubbish so that we are not able to build a war so they feel the tiredness and our adversaries said they shall not no need or see till we are come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease in other words the enemy saying we will infiltrate them they wouldn't even know when we entered do we know how to identify us they will not know we are there and they will not know we are the enemy until we kill them and stop the work that's what that's saying there right and it came to pass that when the Jews which dwell by them came they sent unto us ten times from all the places when you shall return unto us they will be upon you from so from every direction they're being told the attack is coming the attack is coming the attack is coming verse 13 therefore said I in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places I even said the people after their families with their swords their Spears and their bows and I looked and Rose up and this is script we read and said unto the Nobles unto the rulers and to the rest of the people be not here afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses in other words I know you're tired I know you're weary but let's band together let's come together let's get the burden shared let's get the people together let's defend the walls because we can't stop now we can't give up now what we are doing as a greater purpose so let us fight let us fight for our Brethren let's fight for our families let's fight for our houses [Applause] and verse 15 and it came to pass that when our enemy is heard it was known unto us in other words when the enemy recognizes that Witness like the taken battle formation like they're getting ready for some kind of War like they know we're coming and God had brought their counsel to note that we returned all of us to the wall everyone unto his work and it came to pass from that time Fort that the half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both despairs and the Shields and the Bulls and the herbertions and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah in other words we are building and fighting we are building and defending we are building and we are alert we have to send our children to school but we're not sending them undefended we will pray for them before they go to school or you don't hear me this morning we will pray with them we will pray for them [Applause] [Music] verse 17. the a was building on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that leaded everyone with one of his hands brought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon everybody so we're working but uh Thompson will be ready to fight for the builders everyone had his sword girded by his side and so build it so we're not building in ignorance we're not building blindly we're building with our Swords by our side and he that sounded a trumpet was by me so Nehemiah had the trumpet saunda right next to him in other words if you need a Sony alarm I don't want the man who wear the man with the alarm no he I want him right next to me at all times because we unfollow alert we are the highest alert level church we are the highest alert level [Applause] [Music] and I said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people the work is great and large and we are separated upon the wall one far from another in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet resorting theater unto us our God shall fight for us in other words when you're in other words the trumpet is the thing you're listening for when you hear the trumpet just come together the work don't stop but if you do hear you trumpet that's the only time you'll stop working because it means we're going into fighting mode but in the meantime build keep your sword next to you work go to work with your sword go to school with your sword go to your family with your sword go to the grocery with your sword go into the taxi with your sword drive any traffic with your soul anybody with me [Applause] in other words don't let down your God verse 21 so we labor in the work and half of them held his Spears from the rising of the morning till the Stars appeared likewise at the same time said I answer the people let everyone with his servant Lodge within Jerusalem in other words nobody on the outside everybody come inside be come inside the water come inside don't be on the outside don't miss church trying to fight by yourself let us band together because together the enemy have not known one without a thousand five but two ten thousand there's strength and unity there's strength and there's two shall agree touching anything you agreeing all by yourself but that's two people shall agree touching anything let everyone with a servant Lord within Jerusalem and in the night they may be a guard to us and labor on the day so so neither I nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the garbage followed me none of us put off our clothes saving that everyone put them off for washing in other words I fell asleep with their boots on put on because they're ready all the time you don't have to get ready friends if you're staying ready and that's the word tonight you'd have to get rid of this game and he's still ready Stay Ready Stay Ready oh Hallelujah I'm not gonna be too much longer until you appreciate the Lord this morning before we close out the service today we will be asking all of the young people those going to school University whatever and all the teachers as well to stand for prayer we're going to pray with you because it's not just the students need prayer these rebellious spirits that any school is different now yeah and teachers are also under attack she wanted fortified teachers and the students that's important here today that God could preserve them in their schools and they don't lose their desire to serve the Lord and they don't allow the influences and the conversations and the peer pressure [Applause] to be read from Nehemiah and we read from Ephesians but putting on the whole armor of the Lord a message to remind us that we are in a battle in a real battle and whether you're tired thinking about giving up maybe you're discouraging I'm so happy for those of you who made it here and I want you to catch a burden for those who are not here because we're in a real battle and many times we don't realize when we're losing ground and we want to encourage you this morning that this war field we're going through is not now starting it's a war that's been going on since since in heaven the war started in heaven so you have to get used to the fact that this war thing is a thing that's been going on for some time and the war that certain Heaven became a war that we are engaged in it's a military operation and the enemy is not taking prisoners he has white people how do you need to take your mind because if you go insane it could never come down on the signing of this thing so you have to guard your mind you have to guard your heart guard your heart and every service we come to is not to be taken for granted because it's getting us more prepared for battle as we wait for the Dynamics for the final showdown because demon and devil but the Devil Himself will wage war and it'll be so mad when this bride leaves the Earth he will go after the remnant so we have to fight for every inch of ground to make it to the rapture and God help those who don't make their object because they will deal with all the enemy and his anger for those who got away God had to pull us out of the world brought us to our understanding and a revelation of this message of the hour that is not just scripture but the light shown on the scripture from the message of the Prophet to give us a clean visibility into what was sealed in this book so that we could have Clarity of what our promises are so we can get ready to leave and because of this message we don't have a simple understanding of God and who God is but God revealed himself in Simplicity to us as the Life of Christ the Holy Ghost itself in US living himself out so it's not about you working yourself up to do something but it's about total surrender and crime in the pyramid [Applause] until you are sealed as an individual and that being when it's completed is the being that goes in the rapture but a crime also means a fight it means to die out and to fight and every death is a fight because you have to fight today [Applause] die out of your feelings your thinking diet or how you want to dress how you want to speak diet to where you want to go and what you want to do it's a death and the thing is you can choose a journey God takes you through God chooses that for us with one desire to shape our character so that when we get through it we are looking like him so it's a time of preparation and just like in the Army where you can't just go to war just like that there's training there's chastisement there's lift your head up there's keep your boots shining there's the discipline of the word there's that's not how you operate that's not how you speak to a superior officer that's not how you move you need to report on time you need to live a certain way you need to have a prayer life you need to worship you need to be in the house of God your car report when you want to report you need to report a duty every time on time a certain way because any army so you could be a true fighter so this is not the time for you to live die and run and hide is it time to stop running understand and to fight we read that scripture having done all to stand stand after your prayers stand don't give up after you try talking to your children stand after you apply for a job I didn't get it stand after you pray for the Holy Ghost stand don't give up after your side and Christ and from the message as I was with Moses let everything go wrong let everybody else Prosper let the others Prosper let the men who have a form of godliness deny the power thereof prosper and shove you back but if you know where you'll stand you stand regardless of the whole world turns you down you'll

they fought for that we have to fight for it we have to kill every Philistine every amalekite every hittite average every site on site we want to kill them this is a battle cry today to the Bride of Jesus Christ to earnestly content for the Fate that was restored by Malachi 4 to get ready by putting on the whole armor of God Psalms 144 1 says blessed be the Lord my strength which teaches My Hands to War and my fingers to fight so David say I want my fingers to know how to fight I want my hand to know about war because I'm not gonna let this world take away my joy my peace my victory everybody Hallelujah every day it's a fight it's a fight to pay the bills it's a fight to go to work it's a fight to deal with the stress but it's something that's in you that's better to fight you were born an overcomer and we are declaring war on the enemy for too long we have allowed the enemy to have us on the ropes but this morning we are coming off the ropes and we are taking the fight to the enemy this morning we are rebuilding the walls the walls around the church the walls are on our homes the walls are on our desk in our job the world's in the schools the walls that protect our testimony the devil will not have it easy we will not make it easy for the enemy to come into our homes we will not make it easy for the enemy to come into our hearts we will make it very difficult for the enemy to take our joy we will make it very difficult for the enemy to take our Victory we will make it nearly impossible for the enemy to take our family until as we grow it will become impossible for the enemy to come into our homes oh come on now foreign [Applause] for the bride to get into her position the third phase adoption time that third step up please and Christ's up then the Philistines will get to bucking up up that's what we're looking for for the power of God the Holy Ghost itself up doesn't step into the church to step into individuals in the church listen Nehemiah didn't have an intellectual Revelation he wasn't leading by intellectual Revelation it was Godly wisdom that was directed Nehemiah and it'll take Godly wisdom to direct fathers now it will take Godly wisdom to direct mothers now it'll take Godly wisdom to direct young people now Hallelujah and he promised he'll be with you even in you the battle is not yours it's the Lord's but he's gonna use you for the battle oh you don't hear me this morning I'm almost finished oh Hallelujah we're on the home stretch now the church in the massive adoption the church is supposed to be predestinated under the adoption of children where God can take a man and adopt him into the family and give him something first try it and see if it's right the Bible said try the spirits the man claim a certain thing tried and save his right if it's right move with it then say Lord send us something else just moving say every fellow take its place so that wall Nehemiah was putting men in their place and in this season God is putting men in their place he's putting women in their place he's putting sons in their place he's within taught us in their place so we could build and fight we're not just building a wall we're building a pyramid but while we build this touch of a perfect man why we build this Great Pyramid we are fighting and building every man in this place [Applause] [Music] then you're going to see the Church of God begin to get into place that's when the Philistines will go to backing up the shorts will go off here will grow down faces will be washed cigars will be missing that's right when the truth begins to get into its Mighty power when they have an anonymized and to fire a few of them yes sir you're still in that Holy Church stands again in its power positionally placed as sons of God
