[24:00] this is tur upon me to read to you from
[24:02] second-handed robe he's talking about
[24:05] Elijah on Earth God's prophet of the
[24:07] hour God has never left himself on Earth
[24:09] without a witness God always have
[24:11] somebody somewhere a person get his
[24:13] hands on somewhere God has a man that he
[24:17] can lay his hands on now watch that was
[24:19] a Prophet Elijah he got a man to lay his
[24:23] hands on but watch this now but he's got
[24:25] more than one man now he has many men
[24:29] that he can lay his hands on because we
[24:32] are coming onto the Gathering time or
[24:34] the Harvest time so when come to the
[24:36] Harvest and Gathering time one man show
[24:39] is
[24:42] over could to hear a bigger Amen in the
[24:44] house when come to Gathering time it
[24:47] have too much a harvest for one man to
[24:51] reap if we wait on one man they har

[25:18] of the seed and has been maturing and
[25:20] and 6,000 years have been the maturing
[25:23] of the Harvest Time and it's Gathering
[25:26] time now all great things that started
[25:28] to the greatest time that anyone ever
[25:29] aged lived is this time it's a shaken
[25:33] time it's a troubling time for Sinners
[25:35] but it's a marvelous time for Christians
[25:37] because we know we are packing up we are
[25:40] gathering the last efforts together to
[25:43] go home and meet the Lord and the last
[25:45] one he said now watch he said whenever
[25:47] you get licked and realize you are
[25:50] licked and when you come back to humble
[25:52] yourself and get weak and find out
[25:55] you're human and this is the problem
[25:58] people feel they're not human so they
[26:00] can't get licked but he said when you
[26:03] come and recognize you're human and
[26:05] there's none of your intellectuals can
[26:07] do it human weaknesses will never be
[26:09] used of God God by the human weaknesses
[26:15] pours himself into you then he uses
[26:20] himself you just become an instrument
[26:23] you get yourself out of the way so

[32:02] amen hallelujah very very happy to uh to
[32:08] to know the season to know the time to
[32:11] know the day we're living in and I think
[32:14] the pastor has summarized it beautifully
[32:15] when he when he gave those comments the
[32:17] sons of God have to step out there and
[32:21] and to overcome all the the the stuff
[32:24] and to just whatever happens it's it's
[32:26] not going to fail
[32:28] God is going to be with us now I've I've
[32:30] chosen a title today which I believe
[32:32] will provide us with a sort of a keynote
[32:35] and it's called Adam where are
[32:38] you and I hope it will supply the
[32:41] ministry with some uh that they can pick
[32:44] something from it and be a blessing
[32:45] shall we stand to our feet as we go to
[32:48] the uh the Blessed scripture and um I
[32:52] pray that you would be greatly greatly
[32:55] uh uplifted in this great convention
[32:58] here amen Genesis 3:8 is where we're
[33:02] starting and uh that is the first
[33:05] scripture the second one over in the
[33:07] Book of
[33:08] Revelation Revelation 108 so if you can
[33:11] get a marker in those two places uh
[33:15] we'll uh we'll go forward amen Genesis
[33:18] 38 and uh
[33:22] Revelation chapter 10 and verse 8 which
[33:26] will dovetail with the in pration of
[33:29] these meetings and they heard in verse 8
[33:32] the voice of the Lord God Walking In The
[33:36] Garden in the cool of the day now and
[33:41] Adam and his wife hid themselves from
[33:46] the presence of the Lord God amongst the
[33:50] Trees of the
[33:52] garden now and the Lord God called unto
[33:55] Adam and said unto him him where art
[34:00] thou there's my title and he said I
[34:04] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[34:10] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[34:16] myself that's the the reading out of
[34:19] Genesis we now go to the Book of
[34:20] Revelation 108 amen and
[34:24] uh the and the voice which which I heard
[34:29] from Heaven spake unto me
[34:33] again and said go and take the little
[34:38] book which is open in the hands of the
[34:43] Angel which standeth upon the sea and
[34:47] upon the Earth verse N I went to the
[34:50] angel I said unto him give me the little
[34:53] book and he said to me take it eat it up
[34:56] it shall make your belly B
[34:58] but it shall be in your mouth sweet as
[35:02] honey amen let us
[35:04] pray gracious and almighty God we take
[35:08] these two scriptures Genesis and
[35:11] Revelation Satan hates them because it
[35:14] shows how he started and how he finishes
[35:17] dear God we thank you for this Alpha and
[35:20] Omega and dear God may we be uplifted
[35:22] and strengthened as we approach this
[35:25] sacred word we give you the glory glory
[35:28] and the honor now in Jesus Christ's name
[35:31] amen and amen God bless you you can be
[35:33] seated praise be to
[35:39] God hallelujah what a what a great uh
[35:43] responsibility has fallen on our
[35:45] shoulders Adam had it you know he he
[35:49] wasn't carrying a
[35:51] Bible uh there wasn't a King James under
[35:54] Adam's arm but he had something called
[35:57] the title deed of
[35:59] redemption it was in the man he wasn't
[36:02] you know packing a book you know this is
[36:04] my little I use this on the streets when
[36:07] I preach amen my little preaching Bible
[36:09] amen and uh Adam had no book there was
[36:12] no written book but it was just in him
[36:14] it was just part of him now he lost that
[36:18] it was too big too important too
[36:22] consequential for it to go into the
[36:24] hands of Satan amen so it went straight
[36:26] from Adam to
[36:28] God on the throne stayed there a long
[36:31] time this title deed now the only person
[36:35] worthy of taking that back was our
[36:38] precious Lord Jesus Christ amen and he
[36:41] came took that book and opened all Seven
[36:45] Seals amen the lamb opened that amen
[36:48] next thing we find the same book in the
[36:51] hands of a mighty Angel hallu and he's
[36:54] coming down to where all this belongs
[36:58] which is back down on the earth so he he
[37:01] comes down with this little book open
[37:04] and then he comes to this spot we've
[37:06] just read and then the last segment the
[37:10] last portion The Last Action has got to
[37:13] be where John takes that book am type of
[37:17] the bride and he's going to eat that
[37:19] book bitter as it may be Hallelujah he's
[37:21] got to eat it now this is a huge step
[37:25] yes as we go back not just to a blessing
[37:29] not just to the gifts of the Spirit but
[37:31] to the authority that was back in Eden
[37:34] praise be to God and accordingly we find
[37:37] ourselves
[37:39] predictably understandably in a great
[37:42] battle in fact it's the greatest battle
[37:46] that was ever fought is what we are
[37:49] fighting right now the enemy is loosing
[37:52] everything he can because if this ever
[37:56] gets manifested
[37:58] brother we are going straight back to
[38:00] Eden
[38:01] again amen
[38:04] hallelujah if this works then Satan is
[38:08] completely
[38:09] finished it means that the original
[38:12] takes over and the squatter
[38:16] goes praise be to God
[38:20] hallelujah now when the stakes are high
[38:23] the weapons are
[38:24] big you look at these guys in Mexico and
[38:28] these what they call drug cartels the
[38:30] stakes are high if they get
[38:33] arrested they they could die the stakes
[38:38] their weapons aren't small amen they use
[38:41] machine guns
[38:43] Bazookas bombs whatever they need to do
[38:47] to defend themselves because the stakes
[38:50] are high so you find that we are living
[38:54] in a time now where the stakes are high
[38:58] we should not be surprised when the
[39:00] enemy tries
[39:03] everything in his
[39:05] Arsenal everything to stop
[39:08] you everything to hinder you everything
[39:11] to bind you praise be to God he will use
[39:16] if necessary bazooka he will use machine
[39:19] guns he will use demonic Powers but none
[39:22] of these things shall separate us from
[39:25] the love of God which is in christes
[39:27] Jesus charity never
[39:31] fails glory to God thank you
[39:35] Jesus if this works he's using weapons
[39:38] of mass
[39:41] deception
[39:42] amen if this gets through the enemy is
[39:46] finished it's that reminds me of the
[39:48] days of Moses if Moses got through that
[39:52] River Israel would be delivered amen
[39:55] every crocodile
[39:57] came to stop him yeah but the crocodiles
[40:00] were Bound by
[40:02] predestination Hallelujah they came to
[40:04] that Ark they couldn't touch him they
[40:07] came with a big old don't fear
[40:09] crocodiles crocodile got a small brain
[40:13] only one megabyte amen so you don't have
[40:15] to worry about a crocodile amen and they
[40:18] are bound by
[40:19] predestination they came to bite they
[40:21] came to kill they couldn't do it Moses
[40:24] got through praise be to God
[40:28] so Church bride brother sister don't let
[40:31] any devil stop you make up your mind I'm
[40:35] going
[40:36] through I don't care what
[40:39] barrier that the enemy puts in front of
[40:41] you that barrier cannot defeat
[40:46] predestination praise the Lord I feel
[40:49] like saying Satan be careful amen praise
[40:53] the Lord can we clap those hands as we
[40:55] say Amen
[40:57] praise be to God glory to God be seated
[41:01] as we approach you look at our Lord
[41:03] Jesus Christ as he went to Legion full
[41:06] of full of demonic Powers he never had a
[41:08] a smooth ride he had a rough ride that's
[41:12] right and the sea was full of demon
[41:14] demonic Powers but he had to go through
[41:16] that roaring sea to get to Legion and
[41:19] what I want to say to you uh brothers
[41:21] and sisters is that there's one enemy
[41:24] that we all have to watch and that's
[41:25] your worst enemy that's yourself
[41:29] we have to watch ourselves and say Lord
[41:32] amen I don't even trust my understanding
[41:35] I just believe your word if the prophet
[41:38] said it I believe it and that settles it
[41:42] there should be no disputes the prophet
[41:45] was Vindicated amen I've got a couple of
[41:49] quotes as we approach this great subject
[41:51] of Adam where are you and I pray that it
[41:54] will inspire you out of the message of
[41:56] Israel and the church what I quote here
[41:59] of course if you're interested in these
[42:00] quotes you'll be taking key phrases
[42:02] anyway so I won't go laboring with
[42:04] paragraph and Pages you'll take the key
[42:07] phrases amen and we just want to read
[42:09] from this which says my out of Israel
[42:12] and the church look at the nature of a
[42:15] sinner amen
[42:17] hiding hiding is a
[42:20] nature it's a nature that a sinner has
[42:24] in fact as soon as something goes bang
[42:26] people go they keep still because that
[42:28] is the first camouflage is to keep still
[42:32] and people go to church and they still
[42:34] hide young people go to church and they
[42:36] still hide it is the nature did you
[42:39] catch that word nature to hide we can
[42:44] boldly talk like this thank God we know
[42:46] about another nature amen which is not
[42:50] interested in hiding it is the nature
[42:53] called the divine nature praise be to
[42:56] God and so it should have been Adam
[43:00] calling
[43:01] God but it was Adam hiding there was
[43:06] some barrier there amen that Adam had to
[43:08] hide behind God was calling
[43:12] Adam amen it was Adam hiding God calling
[43:17] Adam you see that's the nature of a
[43:20] sinner to hide and to run away you see
[43:24] it that's the nature hide get behind
[43:27] something amen that's always that
[43:30] Amazing Grace calling God always seeks
[43:33] manall man never seeks God it's always
[43:37] God seeks you aren't you glad that God
[43:39] found you
[43:41] amen aren't you glad amen praise be to
[43:45] God so we have a different nature amen
[43:48] that is not interested in hiding it is
[43:51] interested in projecting amen come on
[43:54] now amen not hiding amen amen but what
[43:58] it was in Jehovah Jare he goes on to say
[44:01] Adam Adam where are you and Adam was
[44:05] hiding that's his nature today amen
[44:08] man's nature is not to come out and just
[44:11] confess his
[44:13] sins but to hide behind something and
[44:17] just watch him sit in a convention or a
[44:19] meeting just
[44:21] hiding young people just go to church
[44:23] and they sit there can I ask you a
[44:25] question if I were to give you a
[44:31] tree a tree and say where is the best
[44:34] place to hide
[44:38] it I wonder which young person would
[44:40] have the solution to that shall I tell
[44:43] you the answer unless somebody has the
[44:45] answer the best place to hide a tree is
[44:49] in a
[44:54] forest how many C it
[44:57] if you have a forest you won't know
[44:59] where the tree is and that's where
[45:02] people hide in
[45:03] church they come to church and they do
[45:06] all the right things and they do this
[45:08] but they're still hiding maybe during
[45:10] this convention we'll come out
[45:12] differently say Lord no more hiding no
[45:16] more hiding Lord I'm different from
[45:19] today glory to God thank you Lord he
[45:23] says man's nature is not to come he says
[45:25] to hide behind something he says no man
[45:28] comes to me except my father first
[45:31] called him now this nature he says is
[45:34] still there future home he said this
[45:36] nature he says you can't even repent for
[45:38] it he said it takes the fire to burn out
[45:40] of
[45:41] you you can't repent for what Adam did
[45:45] it takes the fire to get that out amen
[45:48] it's like the old uh I don't know if you
[45:50] say torus or tortoise amen water won't
[45:53] move him knocking won't move him but the
[45:56] fire will bring the taught us out of his
[45:57] shell is that right praise be to God you

[46:43] and and
[46:44] forthright amen and that strain still
[46:48] lays in man instead of coming out he
[46:51] will try everything in the world and if
[46:54] the church gets too strict he will
[46:56] change
[46:59] churches instead of making things
[47:01] right that strain still lays in man we
[47:06] are fighting a great battle here we have
[47:09] to fight the enemy on the outside and

[56:20] correct I'll read the quote to you the
[56:23] quot Adam led by the spirit they were in
[56:26] an upper room to hide from the Jews I

[56:37] said Peter would open the door make sure
[56:40] nobody was there go out here it was a
[56:43] hiding place yes Hallelujah to me this
[56:46] is wonderful amen amen that hiding place
[56:49] was where God chose to come down

[58:35] always find you amen hallelujah what
[58:40] happened Jonah Rose in verse uh three of
[58:43] chapter 1 to flee to tashes from the

[58:51] fact running from the presence of the
[58:54] Lord amen he was hiding in the ship he

[59:44] ship going to tares and he paid the fair
[59:47] and he says uh he went from the presence
[59:50] of the Lord amen he was running from the
[59:53] presence of the Lord but God came down
