[1:06:34] know that you'll be blessed I justify
[1:06:39] comes just a few thoughts - sure just a
[1:06:42] few words from the Branum were speaking
[1:06:44] about the token and said pastor Moses
[1:06:46] spoke and said you have got to get
[1:06:48] beneath the blood for God said blood as
[1:06:50] a token it's a token no matter how much
[1:06:53] you believe how much you're circumcised
[1:06:55] that's the Covenant God gave to Abraham
[1:06:57] and so forth
[1:06:58] that's the Covenant but you've got to
[1:07:00] get beneath the blood that's the token
[1:07:03] when I see the Blood I will pass
[1:07:05] that's denomination either one you must
[1:07:08] come beneath the blood Methodist Baptist
[1:07:11] Presbyterian in the costal on
[1:07:14] denomination whatever you are it's for
[1:07:18] an individual you've got to come beneath
[1:07:21] the blood not just to talk about it may
[1:07:25] I use his words all outside of Christ
[1:07:28] will perish
[1:07:29] how do you get into Christ first
[1:07:31] Corinthians 12 by one spirit not by one
[1:07:35] handshake not by one membership but not
[1:07:39] by one denomination that's what they're
[1:07:41] trying to make it but by one spirit we
[1:07:45] are all baptized into one body and if an
[1:07:49] angel from heaven teaches anything else
[1:07:52] Paul said let him be accursed that's the
[1:07:56] message comment to Christ look any
[1:07:59] person outside of the token God was not
[1:08:02] responsible and God is not responsible
[1:08:04] for any person they got small
[1:08:06] popular or unpopular rich or poor bond
[1:08:08] or free male or female he is not
[1:08:11] responsible for anyone from under that
[1:08:14] stroking covenant he's not responsible
[1:08:16] you say Lord I did this I cast out
[1:08:18] devils I preach the gospel depart from
[1:08:20] me you don't work iniquity I never knew
[1:08:22] you he only recognized a token do you
[1:08:25] hear the coalition said Amen so now it's
[1:08:28] upon you he said sitting down in the
[1:08:31] woods the other day the boys was
[1:08:32] wondering here's two days I even he
[1:08:34] didn't even shoot a squirrel they said
[1:08:36] what was the matter see what it was he
[1:08:39] said please sit upon them said no longer
[1:08:42] was the burden of the Prophet it was the
[1:08:44] boon of the people to begin to apply the
[1:08:47] token
[1:08:48] he's a play set upon them no it is in
[1:08:51] your lap it's in yours he won't
[1:08:53] recognize nothing but that covenant of
[1:08:55] the Holy Spirit and you cannot receive
[1:08:57] that covenant unless you are saved
[1:08:58] sanctified and then baptized into the
[1:09:02] body you only recognize the token that's
[1:09:05] the message of the hour that's the
[1:09:07] message of this day that's the message
[1:09:09] of this train in the name of Jesus
[1:09:11] receive it God is your joy God is your
[1:09:14] strength knowing the message knowing the
[1:09:17] truth
[1:09:18] that's our sufficiency he's my all
[1:09:20] sufficiency in him all things I have
[1:09:22] need is in him I saw strength my he'll
[1:09:24] come from the Lord you Christians look
[1:09:26] to him for your joy look to him for your
[1:09:28] strength look to him for your happiness
[1:09:30] he is my peace he is my joy he is my
[1:09:35] love
[1:09:36] he is my life that's the Covenant
[1:09:40] remember only safe when the token was
[1:09:44] displayed and if a man was here under
[1:09:46] here and his son was across the street
[1:09:48] he was in danger he would perish his
[1:09:51] daddy would receive or if their son was
[1:09:53] over here his daddy was over there
[1:09:54] his daddy would perish only the token
[1:09:56] when I see the token I will pass over
[1:09:59] you
[1:09:59] that's the only thing less horse town is
[1:10:02] gonna bring God's servant to the
