special service this evening a special time of study and and unto you granted lord and jesus in my ask it amen with you all i trust you're doing fine uh thank god for stephen's contribution last tuesday to the bible study we want to pray that god strengthen us and go will inspire us each one and it's amazing to see how the services and the whole things is being connected is connected together and you can see is one mind at work in the mind of god the mind of christ and this is what we want to see among us you want to see evidence of the spirit having it its own way among us not just fish blood and fighting up with mental powers and whatnot but things that would help and assist and strike me i trust that you're reflective over that um thought about parenting um a story and we talk about it on friday everybody have their own story and you know we paul said i show you a better way a more excellent way and this is where we want to strike for the cute other people as an individual you don't want to do things just the way you're custom doing it or this is the way you always do it you want to know is there a better way is there a better way as a father as a husband as a brother as a sister you know probably maybe maybe a brother brother sister or sister is there a better way that we could be genuine authentic no hypocrisy no guile honest and heart true in heart twin spirit is there a better way tonight i want to look at the book of jude it's a short book is one book it's a book just before the book of revelation it's a very important book it's an important book to me i don't know how many of you ever studied it look at it closely can it have our message about the faith why we need a prophet why god sent a prophet all of that is locked up in this book of jude and in this book of jude just before the book of revelation and um if i put a title to this i have it here written um jude an entrance before the book of revelation that's the title here jeweled an entrance before the book of revelation it's incredible that this book of jewish small book 24 so this is um one chapter and yet and it has so much that belongs to us in terms of the fate terms of the warning in terms of broadly kindness and a sum of compassion everything is right there just before this great climax of the bible the book of revelation the capstone revelation of the bible is where it is please god sweeten jude with something right before this so we want to look at it tonight the trusted will help you and edify you and strengthen you so let's go and start tonight praise the lord let's not be the only floor okay now let's read the first verse find the book of jude jew the servant of jesus christ brother of james and here who is this book too to them that are sanctified by god the father preserved in jesus christ and called so you're talking about a called people a sanctified people on a preserve to people now but abraham was saying this here we want to look right straight into his word and read some of this here and see what he would say about it how he would speak to our hearts and i want every person now let yourself forget about washington tomorrow and the things we got to do we are here for one purpose worship god we are here to learn something and i'm here to learn something now you see the humility you say i am here to learn something and i am looking to the holy spirit to teach me something this afternoon and teach me how to be a better man teach me how to be a better minister and through me teach you how to be a better christian and all of us together to be a better church that is what we are here for and the word of god is for instruction and reproof that a man might stand before god blameless if we follow the blueprint we will stand blameless so let's continue so jude was addressing it not to those who are just called and you know of time you hear but isaac say we need to drive a little slow slowly and we could see more things sometimes you zip past things you know your tongue got to be called but are you sanctified you're telling what to be called but are you preserved because preserved takes time to see how somebody is preserved you know the jesus spoke about that feed and fell among the rocks and it rejoiced for a while and when trials come and test and come it dries up so short for a while jump for a while and then disappear but you see when it is anchored like a tree planted by by water by rivers of water you see year and year old season and seasonal hard season harsh weather it is stevie it is preserved it is kept so its three parts to this year those who are called sanctified and preserved it is not uh a guess of words it is specific that he's writing he said mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied then he gets done beloved when i give all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the fate we just want delivered unto the saints so by this scripture it seems as if jude wanted to write other stuff maybe let's say positive stuff uh things that we have in not just in common but the fate that we believe but he he had was to interrupt what he wanted to share because something came up something came up that prompted jude to write this letter it was needful for me to write unto you i cannot hold back anymore i need to get this unto you it is agent it is important put an exclamation mark on it note it and i'm here to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the fate which was once delivered into saints the saints had something and it is flipping it is flipping away it is dissolving it's disappearing there's a reason why and this contend is to fight to struggle to strain to agonize over serious difficulties so i'm gonna blend in the scriptures and some of what ram said are we gonna go and see how it goes tonight so again the content is to fight to struggle to strain to organize you know it's almost like if why should i have to do that as a pastor sometimes sometimes you don't want to tell people certain things you you don't want to say certain things but you have to because god is putting in your heart and it has to be said because he has no respect for persons now but the brain he's addressing to the church telling them just to those that are sanctified in god preserved in christ and called now he says you are the people i am talking to you will earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints note not delivered to fight full ministry note not delivered to the bishops and the archbishops and they would be popes and message popes not that is what these scenes have remember and i keep saying that and you will hear me say it over and over again that the fifo that the the fifo ministry or the is not for the glorification of of the fifo ministry the technology and the purpose of having this military the fightful ministry is for the perfecting of the saints the saints or the sanctified one and if you're not sanctified the intercept so this scene to be talking about here is not church members let's get that clear it is not you go to church your husband is like whatever it is and you go to church and your wife is this or whatever it is that is not what we're talking about church and saint is not the same thing saint simply means sanctified set apart for service set apart because something has to take place to put you in service okay so this is what he was dressing to somebody says you are the people right that you would earnestly content for the feet that was once in the saints now not a feet that was delivered but defeat that was delivered did you notice that here this is about a man the fate that was once delivered to the sins not just a feet some people say well that's against my feet there's only one feet one feet one lord one god one baptism one doctrine this is barbara and now people say well i have a faith and i go to my own church but that's not what this is about jew speaking here he's talking to the people to contend for defeat that was once delivered unto the saints what if we could get the believers the saints of god to meditate on the scripture and begin to dig up study ask question challenge we want defeat that was restored by malachi 4 we want the fate that was once delivered to the saints and was restored by william marion brown and the prophet of malachi 4 we want to see that same fate back in the church what must we do what must we say what must we have because what we have now can't cut it and if we have to go down to the resurrection down to the press down to meet the challenge if they are we have to have defeat but isn't that why god sent malachi 4 to turn our hearts back to spoken word books and listen to tips no that is not the objective he sent maokai for to turn our hearts back to the fate of the father this thing is so simple i don't know why people make it so complex as if you almost have to get the degree to get through the understanding or grasp the revelation of what this message is about it is very simple god started a church and put on a big corn seed a corn tree a corn an original grain their pentacles that train went through processes and then in the evening time he promised that green will come back again another original branch that tree will reproduce itself and produce another book of acts which is that simple amen so then jude saw this danger this danger and this is what prompted him to write this letter and brother bannon said this here if we will go back to where they were first called saints and find out what kind of feed they had then we will know more or less what to contend for so you can't fight for something that you don't know what you're fighting for you see so if you're fighting for a watermelon and you don't know what it looked like and somebody says you have vine you could end up bringing a pumpkin because pumpkin roll and vinyls it has to be clean and clear what this feat is now if this fate is sitting down under the most uh knowledgeable preacher then all who understand the knowledge they have defeated every fate is sitting along under the preacher up and down the platform screaming and hollering and speaking and downs then those who under that then that's the fate but that's not so okay so he's saying that you have to go back and find out what kind of fate that they had and i want to say this people go to church catholic church mathis church dear witness church whatever church you could do and they just accept this is the church this is what they do this is what they teach this is what they say and i'm a believer i believe amen amen this here is not that this here is trying to get back to the original not a copy not a new uh con like a new version of it or new interpretation of it no you want exactly what is there in the original now let's continue now when the church was called was after they were sanctified the word sanctifier saint come from meaning clean pure holy unadulterated and so forth that was the beginning of the church when it was inoperated at the day of pentecost now let's look at what they had back here what that church contended for what they had lost just 33 years after the beginning of the church and you know that jude wouldn't be talking about back in the old testament on the levitical law see he is a christian he is talking about when the first church was set in order was inaugurated on the day of pentacles now we will notice what kind of fate that they had they had a fate in a resurrected living christ someone who rose from the dead and was living among them that is not the fivefold ministry that is what we're talking about is jesus christ raised from the dead alive among his people confirming his word with signs wonders and miracles let me read this again we will notice what kind of fate that they had listen to the fate they had a faith in a resurrected living christ someone who rose from the dead and was living among them just the same as he was before he ever died now it wasn't contended for some historical affair they were contending for a living christ a resurrected one who was in their midst and i declared tonight what he is speaking about here is not pastor prophet teacher evangelist or apostle it is not these men it is christ christ to be veiled in these men okay let's continue so now when he rose from the dead he done the same thing after he goes from the dead through the apostles that he did before he died even greater and more of it so you could see evidently that when christ was on the earth he turned water into whiny he multiplied the bread and fish he healed the sick he raised the dead okay you see him on the cross my god while forsaking me he's dead now but he rose from the dead and didn't appear in public so he didn't have a public ministry post-resurrection he had a private ministry in which he was dealing with only his disciples or elected be sanctified the preserved he was dealing with them because he had to bring a prophecy over their lives of this resurrected life coming into them previous before he died he told them i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you a little while the world sees me no more but you're gonna see me so he was prophesying to them that the father will send this comforter which is the holy ghost so all of this they were seated down with this now bear in mind these men had ministries these men had anointed these men cast out devils these men were sharing in the ministry of christ without having his ministry in them they were anointed to preach anointed to preach about the kingdom anointed to heal the sick they were anointed to do that but that anointing was a temporary power that was released to them to make them a partaker of christ's ministry so by the time christ finished they knew about all the manifestation that sons of god will do because they were participating in that and then when he stopped them from preaching and said don't even cut it out no more preaching for you right now just stop because you have to get power for the next phase for the next level then and then he opened it understand to the scriptures and then open those scriptures to them and then open their understanding you need both not only must the word open to you but your understanding must open us so it's just like fatherhood maybe you never consider the depth of what a father is and when that open up to you then you look in the mirror and when you look you see how short you are then you want to talk you want to mesh up to that line of what a father really is or what a mother really is or what our wife really is you know some i know i've strained a little bit you know but the thing of it is sometimes we take things for granted a wife is somebody who might wash clothes and cook food and creepy hugs and you know i do certain things but sometimes when you drill down when you drive slow there is so much depth to our lives and purpose that you need to really look again and but this even brought that tremendous thought last tuesday about in the house of different vessels different purposes the king have gold cup and you know different purpose and whatever you have to find your value your goal what you are in god and how god wants to use you you have to find that spot but jude here he was pressing his way to to declare something so let's continue here now in the amplified of this same verse 3 it says beloved my whole concern was to write to you in regard to our common salvation but i found it necessary and was impelled to write you an urgently appeal to and exhort you to contend for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints the fate which is that some of christian belief which was delivered verbally to the holy people of god for there was certain men crept in unawares and that's the next scripture one thing we want to read it and that is verse four for there were certain men if you have a bible just watch crept in unawares who were before of all ordained to this condemnation and he is describing the men ungodly men turning the grace of our god into las difficulties and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ and the amplified they say for certain men have crept instiltively gaining entrance secretly by a sido now when i read this i don't want you to generalize and say you know certain men what jude is talking about is ministers pastors so-called apostles so-called prophets so-called evangelists let me say it good again it's not this man with a top hat and you don't know men no no point you think all about is men alive and kicking right now men in the pulpit right now men going to be fulfilled right now then we just walk away pulpit right now is these men we talking about and you would found it necessary and i think brother isaac i was a message that really was very inspiring to me about be not deceived don't be deceived because jesus won many false prophets arise so this is not just about um saints and and and and all the positives and all the you know the lift you up and to bring up this is also warning you from being naive in other words you're kind of smart by your you know you you can strip it yeah you're not acting with the wisdom of god to understand and it have crazies out there it has falsehood out there it have false teachers we're not against anybody yet i'll give an example something let's just shift gears a little bit samson didn't want and didn't find a girlfriend among the israel girls i'll just say it this way he'd go on any bush and find him out of the feet and because he like this girl he feel it's supposed to work out now samson is using his five senses he's out of defeat because faith pushes you beyond the five senses know what samson is not singing because that woman is not covenanted she is also a tool for the devil to use he's not seeing that he is seeing love and like and angie nice and whatever whatever you want to talk about what sam if sam's not pulled back and think it over and recognize wait a minute you mean my enemy could use that so i have to keep an extra eye out that is what he was supposed to do okay so sometimes so i like how the bible described this men slipped in crept in it's not so so these men is not overnight guys they're just banging do i i am i'm the messiah you know everybody knows who are you no they're slipping slowly crapped in by the side door people shake their hand god bless my brother and think like that if there's a brother he has preached and his gay people woke up saying email email emails wait for him watch him and afterwards he back back he brought back out of his own interpretation right there in his back so he gave you a good word that you know is true and he wanted amen amen amen when you have your heart with a man you don't want any black bags and drop his own revelation and if you don't work sharp you're saying he meant to that too so you have to watch these guys and as your pastor i'm telling you that it has flickers all day flickers out there no in this social media age like my sister she work in hospital and so on she said if it had social media anytime i pull you he said all the countries will have endless polio people with their foolishness because liars everybody with a camera could see something on facebook anybody in vaccine and immaculate beast and all kind of nonsense if this is this social media crap was back there the world wasn't going wasn't even going to get water pull you that's so much a diseases and sickness and balaam say you wish to get the indoctrination of cancer man if scientists when you say that i'm definitely cancer you will hear his empires i have taken what are they listening to what are people hearing you know what it's something in the system they like i can train everyone's talking about will be protected because right now it has gone down it has mutated downwards into like a common cold i'm i'm glad i am glad i want to be out of it i want to be but let me tell you something since i'll tell you as your pastor if i have to take this boost every year i taken it every year i am 10 like if every year i get a job i'm taking a job immaculately every year every year who want to see marketing beasts and they talk foolishness they're talking crap they're talking foolishness every year i will take okay because i'm here on the street and i have a choice i have a mind no minister will just swing my head and swim around no they are doctors mind you on basically any pulpit they have no qualification they give no pronunciation over medical issues you want a a legal issue you go to a lawyer you don't go to a pastor you want a medical issue you go to a doctor he's not he's he's not he's not a doctor you know you're your pastor many some people come to me with things that say that is about my pay grade i i can't answer that i can't talk about that yes go could inspire certain things sure but i cannot uh do like if i'm exploiting this and expressing that no i'm called to preach the word and i'm content for the faith and this is what we're doing tonight fighting for defeat so jude jude didn't want to go here but he had to because it was critical what was coming up on the church and this facebook and social media and whatsapp have been so destructive it has been more destructive than we thinking it's more than forwards and forward and forward and people ain't thinking no just forward to something forward is something forwarding something it is very destructive and the time people spend in social media if they spend it in prayer it might have been so much different now so i digest a digression and a whole different thing there but let's continue praise the name of the lord your love and tonight o blessed be near the lord so therefore oh christ let's continue so so the what the fate that they had was in christ being resurrected among us and you know brother branham he would say you know what i'm waiting on i don't know if you come out here i'm waiting to injure the lord and then we say angel is here he is here no brother brown is not the angel he is waiting on the angel he as a human being says i can do nothing i am depending on him i'm looking to him i am not it i am written for it when it comes it's a different thing all together i get a super charge it's one anointing i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god and the whole you know drama set behind here okay so then jude says here for there were certain men crept in unawares who were before of all ordained to this condemnation [Music] he said no during the time 32 years of last there come many false brethren who raised up and brought in heresies and brought people off the theology and different things like that and as paul i think of him playing here they come and told him this little jew with his little hooked nose laying down here in prison the chains around him around his ankles and so forth and say well he says some is preaching christ for gain some is trillion and others disciples aside there it began to organize and god great organization and so forth so let's continue to verse five and you know when jude spoke about contending for defeat he didn't say how how to contend he did that when we go down to verse 20 and lower 20 22 23 but what he was caught up in is identifying what was the results of false teachings false leadership false leaders and the first example we give was in verse 5 and we read this i will therefore put you in remembrance though you knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterwards destroyed them that believe not now remember the warning that i give the bible studies about two weeks ago when we read from first corinthians chapter 10 that all all fathers were under the cloud all baptized into moses all eat the same spiritual meat all drink the same spiritual drink but what many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness and these things were for our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be you idolaters as they some of them and as a written the people sat down to eat who's up to play neither commit fornication some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand they attempted christ and they went down the stairs that and so and these things happen unto them for examples and they're written for our admission admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come so what jew did here the first reference he gave was how the people came out of egypt and got destroyed and you know of time you hear me say this message has never encountered god's judgment message don't know what god's judgment is that is why a lot of things go seemingly unpunished seemingly untouched and people take for granted because they believe they are fine they'll read the bible it is the lord they believe a prophet and they're good to go that is not the scriptures our type in going into the scriptures when you look at our time you'd realize the same people that god called out he destroyed because the word they heard will not mix with faith and we could see it and that's why we tell you ask god for divine revelation and brother anthony was tremendous on sunday to have true revelation give you a feed for the promise because with true revelation there is clarity because the uncertain inspiration comes from god straightened down into your heart because it is the operation of the spirit not your study not your mental faculties but the operation of the spirit so that's why by faith enoch by faith by faith it was revelation revolution is free so are you with me tonight so later on we would see what this fear is he's talking about how to get it how to get to it or praise the lord okay so watch he began to go and talk about and then he then in chapter six he said and the angels which kept not their first estate left their own habitation he has reserved an everlasting chain under darkness unto the judgment of the great day and verse seven he gave another pointed reference even as solomon gomorrah and the cities about them in a like manner given themselves over the fornication going after strange flesh a set forth as an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire likewise also these filthy dreamers speaking about these guys defile the flesh despised dominion and speak evil of dignitaries you know what that is in the amplified nevertheless in like manner these dreamers also corrupt the body scorn and reject authority and government let me read that back again i apologize to set an order settings in order nevertheless this is amplified in like manner these dreamers also corrupt the body scorn and reject authority and government and revile and libel and discover heavenly glorious the glorious one wow this nine said yet michael the archangel when contend with the devil he disputed about the body of moses does not bring against him a reeling accusation but said the lord rebuked thee so jude now is drilling down into the characteristics of these guys and these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally has been beast in those things they corrupt themselves grow unto them he's calling judgment for they have gone in the way of cain and ran greatly after the era of balaam for reward and perished in the gain saying of korra verse 12 these are you how we describe them spots in your feast of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water this one is a big one clouds they are without water you know you know when you see clouds setting up you guys have rain coming you're looking for rain you're looking for water and these are just blusters bluffers i call them mount champions clouds they are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withered look at the description judas beginner not only were they original but without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots raging waves of the sea forming out of their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever this is these people who are spiral spoken on workbooks claiming they're preaching the message sometime back we read for you i believe was in ezekiel where god was warning people about false prophets and he said i did not speak to them and i did not send them and yet they speak in my name this is almighty god telling the prophet these guys are speaking in my name and i did not speak to them i did not call them who called them who sent them so listen scenes it will come down now to to the british when he tired hit the road will come unto brassiere it will come down to let the god of answer by fire let him be gorgeous it will come down to a little more than talk no argument with men it will be god vindicates in his word or ibraheem prophesied when charity comes down seal all the virtues in he said when that time comes then you will see vindicated sons and vindicated daughters not just sons so he is not talking about men behind the pulpit because sisters not beyond the pulpit but there is going to be vindicated sons and vindicated daughters okay this is what is promised nobody could keep that from you this is your promise no minister no pastor no bishop could keep that from you do you believe that tonight could we give the lord some praises tonight okay so um so then it went into verse 14 and enoch also received from adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints to execute judgment upon all to convince all that are ungodly among them of all the ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all the hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoke against him oh blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus and then it went on to say you know wow who's 16. these are murmurs check check check them out complainers walking after their own lust and their mouth speaker great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of advantage and it was 6016 [Music] in the amplified it says here these are inveterate murmurs grumblers who complain of their lot in life going after their own desires controlled by their passions their talk is boastful and arrogant and they claim to admire men's person and play people flattering compliments to gain advantage so these are some real hyphen manipulators flatter you to work you over and my goodness you remember uh when we just have first seminar and talking about complimenting your children and your daughters and different things like that if you don't compliment your child until they're looking nice and whatnot the day some man tell them hey sweetie and we have to do these things we have to really show love one to another and show that this is a community of christ a body of christ a church that that that expresses by this shall all men know that recycles you know and these people fighting the law of the land and what the government say and he put a call and they want to fight it and fight out israel foolishness when god brought israel out and he said bring them to this mountain was to give them laws true laws you have a society that's why the bible talked about pray for the governor pray for the kings as much as possible if peace be with all men is laws that that give us the opportunity to have what we call a society if there was no laws anybody could just come and take your house take a car do whatever they want to do because there is no laws there's no penalties we have to have laws god have laws let me say it again we have to have laws god have laws man have lost you can't just walk in the airplane and you're no passport you're just here if you take a flight how much it costs you say passport i have a passport i don't want to paddle in your passport well the law is to throw you out because you need to get a passport to get on the plane to pay for a ticket to go on the plane so god have laws also you must be born again by jesus for his message you must receive the holy ghost then you should want the holy ghost you have to have a revival understand this if you don't fight to live you will die this fighting for defeat is fighting for your breakthrough it's fighting for your life it's fighting for your anchor for your whole this is your faith this is defeat this is what the saints was delivered to the saints and you want that for your own life for your family so you see what i'm saying tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord oh let me see if i could just get down here now these are murmurs no it's interesting i'm going to stop here and come back to it that in second peter 2 i think you could just flick there quickly um second peter two it's impressive how these brothers so much in the spirit and they're almost saying the same thing in second peter two reading from verse one peter's saying this but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you so peter is prophesying all right who privily shall bring in tamil heresies even denying the law that brought them and bring them upon themselves sweep the structure and many shall follow their pernicious weeds so if you're looking where the crowd going look look the crowd right here many shall follow the pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be even spoken of and through covetousness shall the fake words make merchandise of you whose judgment know for a long time the lingering knot and the damnation islam right now and here peter gone down drilling just like jude for if god speared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment and spared not the old world but save noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes condemn them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that after should live ungodly and deliver just lot vexed with the filthy conversations of the wicked which is for the righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds the lord knew it how to deliver the godly out of temptation but to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government here we go again presumptuous are they self-willed they are not afraid to speak evil of dignity whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not a real accusation against them before the lord but these as natural brute beats look at the terminology peters use it very similar to what judas used make to be taken and destroyed speak evil of things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption and shall receive yet the reward of unrighteousness as they that counted pleasure to riot in the daytime spots they are blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you having eyes full of adultery and cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls so these characters spirits people they're not they're staying by themselves but they dare to beguile deceive bewitched unstable souls and heart they have exercise with confucius practices cursed children which are forsaken the right way and are going astray following the ways of being i'm the son of bonzo who love the wages of righteousness but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbid the madness of the prophet these are the intervals related to jude wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the midst of darkness is reserved forever for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure to the lusts of the flesh too much wantedness those that were clean escaped from them who live in error while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage for if after they have escaped the pollution of the world through the knowledge of the lord savior jesus christ they again entangled therein and overcome the latter is worse with them than the beginning for it is better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them but it is happening to them according to the trooper verb the dog is turned into his own vomit again and this fool that was washed to her swallowing in the man so saints i want to wrap that up there and then we're going to go to our climax of where jude was bringing back now to the things how [Music] to contend for this feat how to get that feet how to keep that feet and here we find it uh verse 17. and this is where we're going to hit the home stretch here now from verse 17. praise the name of the lord verse 17. look at these words now but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ how that they told you that there would be markers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lust these be they who separate themselves sensual having not discovered and here we go this is our voice here now but beloved building up yourselves on your most holy fate praying in the holy ghost oh blessed be the name of the lord and in the amplified it says but you beloved build yourself up founded on your most holy fate make progress rise like an edifice higher and higher praying in the holy spirit so jude here is comparing this faith as a building which we know is the pyramid okay and it's starting that fate so you could say build yourself up on your most holy fate pray in the holy ghost keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ and eternal life enough some of compassion making a difference oh my verse 21 it says god keep yourself in the love of god expect and patiently wait for the mercy of our lord jesus christ which will bring you life eternal verse 22 i don't know some have mercy who weaver and doubt and this here is the anchor point tonight of true broadly kindness and of some have compassion making a difference between the brute beasts and those are failing who have garments spotted by the flesh let's read on verse 22. let's verse 22 again and of some of compassion making a difference and others save it fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh i want to pause here tonight you know god is able to keep you i want you to have confidence and faith in that that god wants you to stand having an all to stand stand if you don't have a revelation of the faith that god released then any winner doctrine could blow you aside any talk any any win anybody say something just sweep you off but if you are convinced that this word is true and this this fate was delivered but the branham went about to restore it that's why we have all these manifestations and testimonies and god bless and confirm his ministry and vindicate him as dedicated him as that elijah then we have prophetic questions that we could hold on to but here it is the next book is the book of revelation the next book is the capstone and here it is right before that book of revelation the book of the apocalypse the book of the right before the unfeeling of god here it is you have and if some have compassion making a difference we have to be able to make a difference with people who have no revelation and people who are arrogant unwilling to obey and follow god's program and plan it is not the same and god who have extended mercy and grace to us he would check out and he will ensure that we have this opportunity that we could extend grace to others if you extend grace to someone and you have to make a big boost about it i don't understand that one because when god extends grace to you it was no big scene you were grateful and you were thankful and you could raise your hands because god has been merciful to you i want to see you i'm not talking down to you now you and i what has been merciful to me and because god extends grace to you he looks to see how you will extend grace to others so somebody may do something in the flesh may do you something that was unwarranted may even lie on you says something falsely about you and yet god is not testing that person god is testing you because you have to go into this next book or next door and next door is a rapture next door is the revelation of jesus christ next door is come up hither next door is the climax or the harvest of the entire bible genesis 3 chapter revolution is the harvest right next door and you would understand where brotherly kindness is placed in the pyramid right on top of that have this holy spirit sloth that is where you belong that is where you want to go as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of god they that are in the flesh cannot please god cannot be subject to the program of god so the object is to get us more into the spirit that god could have the preeminences the object is to get us malleable you know like when you're using putty sometimes you put to get hard and then they put some oil in the potty and then you put the oil in the putty and it didn't become malleable when you could press it okay when you could press it and when you could knead it and press it and shape it and then it could shape that putty into how you want it and we have to be like putty in gorgeous hands that he could make us malleable and shape us and press us however you want us to be and we could fit into god's program because the pyramid as you know not even a razor could go between the edge it was so well put together that with the pyramid nothing in between perfect and then paul talked about charity the bond of perfectness to come and seal the whole building cut out all the leaks in your life if you could have a leak in patience you can have a leaking temperance you have a leak here leak there yes you have but things are leaking out because you're not sealed yet with charity the bond of perfectness they get the charity we have to get to the seventh step the seventh step is really love the seventh step is where we have the opportunity to express and manifest the compassion of god his compassion and this is what was demonstrated when the two people came making love in the church and go to the prophet whatever you say will be happening to these people if they say die they will die we say blind they'll be blind and god gave him the whole list of what he could choose from and you know what because of this spirit life in him he said i forgive you and you know what he said behind that because he would have done things wrong he would have acted wrong inside he needed god's forgiveness and even those these people were terrible carrying on in church and you could say they deserve the judgment of god yet a man of god stood there and said i forgive you and god was pleased right at country when they bowling crucify him and all these people coming out to see our next man crucified jesus your father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing you want to tell me in your christian life in your christian work you have never recognized that you have been wrong [Music] to tell someone forgive me i'm sorry please forgive me you mean in your christian walk you have never had the experience of seeing how sorry you are wrong you are or forgiving someone who come to you and said forgive me i'm sorry you mean that has never been part of your christian world how you could go to the next step how do you know you have this forgiveness this kindness this is god's kindness even when they ask jesus teach us how to pray forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us forgive us as we this is jesus now this is not brother we're trying to make up a prayer this is jesus showing you the conditionality of you forgiving others even when the disciples ask you how much time shall we forgive three times a day and these are troubling mathematics on them 70 times seven days for ten years is that ten years that deposit for ten years a day because god has forgiven us and god gradually forgive god thanks man and god have a friend in his face i know you're gonna do it again you know no that's why he could afford to put your name on the lam's book of life and forget about it you're born yet think about it you're even born yet and you put your name in the landscape of life and you're being when you're born you're born in sin i can say last last thing i talk about in friday emily babies recognize something amazing all right so we are not now saved in that sense he chose us before the foundation and the least we could give back to him is a quality of gratefulness let me see if i could wrap up here i wouldn't go on and on let me take a wrap up here like all right so let's go over this again here this little part here all right so jude one build yourself up in the most holy fate to praying in the holy ghost three keep yourself in the love of god and have some have compassion making a difference and this part i want you to look closer despite verse 23 of some of compassion there's 22 but verse 22 says and others saved with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garments spotted by the floor and it is one thing that i see things is how we have to be able to encourage one another because this is what i'm seeing here real genuine encouragement for one another when you hit number 23 on others this is beyond you know reaching out to others others who don't understand it's so easy to hold something against someone and you see me preach drop your words yes they did it yes they were rude yes they were even disrespectful yes but don't hold us against them they have their own problems already pray for them pull them out of the fire we have to be able to hate the sin and love this sinner we have to be able to separate and make a difference with what people do from who they really are because why we were sinners god died for us and god saved us god brought us up he didn't say when you get clean up then i will save you he saved you then he got cleaned up he invited you to come just as you are we are about to wrap up here i have some of compassion making a difference between who are weak and ignorant and those who are natural rude beasts in other words have discernment to see the difference between those who are proud and arrogant and unwilling to obey the truth the objective is not to run people out the objective really is to restore them to fellowship the attitude is one of grace and mercy remember some seniors years ago had a problem with me and how i manage young people they find i was too lenient they find uh they wanted a heavy hand because they came from a heavy legalistic background and they want a big stick come down to beat the people up whatever pastors do lots of time keep them in check and they both european they beat them here and beat them here and everybody yes two i turn on left unit and i saw some of these young people unsaved they don't know the lord many of them didn't even know the word struggling and sometimes yes we could take a big stick and beat and then you beat him out of church and then you have a prayer request would you pray for my son because you failed for my daughter and what we can do really is the prayer that they get revelation because a lot of things that young people are struggling with the one uncomfortable pill of fire one encounter with god twin country with god all that gonion all that gone you know i can't oh god i gotta tell my mindset god is sin he's still in me he can't stop sinning you yeah encounter fire you never come into presence of god where you fall as one dead it changes you coming into presence let me see if i could just close off here my god's grace but lebron you speak about faith is based upon forgiveness this this is glorious tonight i could show it right here faith is based upon forgiveness so jude is a book that is correctly placed it is placed correctly in the canon of scriptures because this book is what is a touchstone of this thing called forgiveness because what we want to turn back to is faith but what is faith based on no we've been creating business here and here in the word of god but faith is based on forgiveness and when jesus was given his word and said mach 11 he said when you stand praying and so like that forgive you for your ought against any and then then he end up now if you shall know he's happy to pull first if you shall see to this monkey be moved and don't doubt what you're saying when you pray believe you have received you shall receive he's drilling down he's drilling up and when you stand praying forgive why would he say that he's not drunk conspiring he's not sinners praying is the believers he's trying to get to it is this like what he's talking about he said okay here's his book speak to him here's the second pull when you believe when you pray believe you have received and you will receive and always believe you receive it before you get it and you will get it but but when you contemplate if you have a vote against your husband your wife your children your boss your family your neighbor whoever it is drop it and your father could hear you so then when you drop it when you could express this forgiveness all of a sudden your feet that was done here goes straighter and you begin to get your prayer answered and you begin to get access to god access in a way that you did not have before this is what this is about building yourself up growing striving oh blessed be the name of your lord i think we are done tonight and then jude cruz okay one more and jesus said if you do not forgive neither will your father should forgive you and then he said rapture and faith will only be revealed to those who forgive their brothers that's a bomb i don't know if people even know this exists this is for man i believe on uh west palm beach farm 1953 rapture and fate will only be revealed to those who forgive their brothers teaching on moses if we have one ought against us on squander we stand in damnation of hell's fire verse 24 and 25 and we close to the two last portion of scripture no one to him this is jude now given god praise and worship unto him he came back to god here under him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you fullness before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only ones god our savior be glory and majesty dominion and power now for now and ever amen and i say amen tonight god bless you thank you so much i wanted to share this book of jude with you and i trust it was helpful i trust it was a defined i trust that you would uh come down to the point where you could see you as those seeds that judah's talking about hear what they're fighting their fate guys slipping and twisting are shake believers and people the wrong way a lot of people in problems no mind battles and confusion but here what i want you to build up in the most holy feet in other words i want you to act your feet with you and devote your knowledge to knowledge temperance then punch peace because patience confidence god is brotherly kindness i want you to get the love of god i want it to be upon you and down to him who is able to keep you from falling let us buy it almighty god uh i thank you tonight to be here it is such an exciting time to go into the scriptures and look again at what you said in your word william branham your prophet and servant didn't come and bring a new message lord he came to reveal what was already written further the scriptures it can't be something outside of the word it has to be something hid in the word and lord here it is jew tonight a very important book it connects with the message we are it connects with our heart being turned back to the face of the fathers it connects from the bottom to the top from faith straight up to bravely kindness because we know lord that once we hit that seventh step by revelation and manifestation we are ready for place in christ for you said in your word lord when the church finds his broadly love but the church finds his holy decency when the church finds its place in christ it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us lord i feel your presence tonight and i pray and trust that all the believers connected and those who would hear it would feel your presence from your word lord god is not my presence is your presence we are thank you we are grateful father may they catch my revelation that this book was addressed to those who are called those that are sanctified and those that are preserved if there's anyone listening who are not sanctified it's not sanctified father may you give them the desire to be truly sanctified may the seraphs take the cause of the altar touch them even now your presence come upon them even now i mean the old leaves fall off the old ways fall off the old attitudes fall off there are people we have seen them lord just get old they have not grown they have not changed they have just aged away just as they always was and we feel sorry for them because we see a lack of revelation but i pray tonight something's still in their spirit and stood in their hearts is not how we start god is how we finish a lot of people go back and they have regrets they didn't start at this time they wish it was early dude whatever it is doesn't matter how we start the question is how are we gonna finish because many start but a bunch that gonna finish will be the bunch of overcomers how'd i pray tonight the doors under the song of my voice come true in overcoming lord overcoming themselves overcoming their fears overcoming their paths and they enter into the love of god father may there be a greater love for one another a greater love for your people and lord that word and others pulling them out of the fire oh god help us lord pull up the weak ones we see it lord we can't explain why they don't have what we think they should have but we could help them help us lord take out out of take us out of the laziness of those flock forces or the slackness and give us the energy and the strength and the faith and the courage to help the weaker ones and to strengthen those that are struggling laws and those that feel they can't make it lord because they are not everybody have bulldog faith not everybody have this this hard sort of faith there's something we can feed lord but we pray that you strengthen them and bless them tonight bless the service tomorrow night that will be streamed on the upcoming prayer meeting this coming friday asks in jesus name amen and amen god bless you saints thanks again for being here with us we certainly enjoy your company and we appreciate you being here have a blessed night
