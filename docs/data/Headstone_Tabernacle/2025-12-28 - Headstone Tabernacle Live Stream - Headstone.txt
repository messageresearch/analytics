Do you know it's only by his grace and his mercy, by his [music] love, by his purpose, by his plan. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer. Our gracious heavenly father, we thank you this morning that we could be gathered one more time in your sacred house of prayer and praise, reproof [music] and correction, of admonition and training and teaching and healing. House of refuge, a house of peace, a house of safety, a house of God's bread, a house of comfort, Lord, a house where we could come and we could leave, Lord, different than the way we came. Your prophet taught us whenever we come into your presence, [music] we either leave better or we leave worse, but we never leave the same way that we came. Heavenly Father, may we leave this house, Lord, not just change, but change for the better. change in the inner man. Not just change in our feelings or our emotions or Lord just to feel good about ourselves but something on the inside that Lord a new creation has been activated. The seed in us has been quickened to life by the word of God that comes in contact with the spirit of God. Father we thank you for the grace and the mercy that you have Lord placed upon us. And we thank you in advance for the healing that's about to take [music] place. Uh breakthrough that's about to take place. Uh deliverance that's about to [music] take place. Uh captives that are about to go free because that's what you came to do to set the captives free. To Lord to put that liberty them that are bound to loose the bands of wickedness and [music] break the shackles that have held the people back, Father. Lord, and as we come to the end of another year and prepare for a new year, Father, Lord, where your word teaches us to forgetting the things that are passed and to look to the things that up ahead, Father, we come to your house, Lord. Lord, for this final service of 2025, of last Sunday, as it were, of the year, Father, we give you glory. We give you honor to your holy name in the precious, marvelous, wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; and the church says, &gt;&gt; amen and amen. And you may be seated for a few minutes [music] in the presence of the Lord. And certainly want to greet you, greet one and all in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And it's certainly a great privilege to be in the land of the living. &gt;&gt; It's not something to take for granted. It's not something that you could take casually because there are many people did not make it to this point. They didn't make it to this day. They didn't make it to this month. They didn't make it to this year. But God through his grace and mercy has seen it fit that we would be counted worthy to be present to see what we see and to hear what we hear and to be a part of what God is doing in this season and this hour. So we want to just give the Lord a hand of praise and thanksgiving that he who has started the work in us is more than able to bring it to pass to bring it to completion. He said I know the plans I have for you the thoughts I have for you to bring you to an expected end with an end that is expected. He knows the expectation of the end before you were even born. He had an expected end in mind of how you should look when you leave here. How you should look when you come to the house of God. How you should look when the Holy Spirit comes upon your life. So I want to greet one and all and salute one and all by the grace of God. It feels good in the house of God. It feels like you're here because you know who you are. You know where you come from. You know where you're going. You know what God expects of you. and your expectation should be rising by the grace of God. So I greet one and all those that are here. I know there are few people who are not well and they're downstairs. And I went to brother Hugh. I said, "Brother Hugh, why are there so many people downstairs?" He says, "Some people are not well." So as I left hearing those words, I say maybe as the word goes forward this morning, the people downstairs will be quickened to come upstairs because a healing power that's not limited to time and space and limited by four walls can reach downstairs and quicken and heal and transform and deliver regularize blood pressure. Come on. Destroy the virus and the flu and female condition, male condition, whatever condition it is. Destroy cancer. Destroy arthritis. Destroy leukemia. destroy every demon because every spirit, every principality has a name. And if we could identify what it is, we could call it out and deal with it. Can the church say amen? Even to reach users of the internet, to those that are connected online, may the quickening power of God touch you where you are. May your house, your home, your office, your desk, where you be, may the pillar of fire drop down because the spirit is promised to follow the word of the living God. Can the church say amen? So, by the grace of God, on behalf of the pastor, I'd like to thank the church for their commitment to this year 2025, for the grace of God, and for your faithfulness to the message of the hour. We don't preach our own message. We preach another man's message. Can the church say, "Amen." So, we salute you, the church, those that have made that choice to make this your home church. You know, the prophet said, "You ought to have a home church, a place you call your home, a place where you identify. There are many people who profess this message and have no home church. True. &gt;&gt; You know, we're going into a new season. &gt;&gt; So, we're not holding back on anything anymore. We we're not dealing with children. Brother Clarence, when I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child. And but when I became a man, we put away childish things. So, we want to eat some real food. &gt;&gt; You know, people coming out of the Christmas season, they had all kind of food. But there's some real spiritual food. That's not cereal. That's not milk. That's not soy milk or this kind of milk or but it's a real food of the word of God that quickens us and strengthens us and prepares us for battle because there's a great battle that lays ahead. There's a war that lays ahead. There's a there's challenges that lays ahead. But by the grace of God, he has raised up another generation who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age. I really want to salute Oid. You appreciate your pastor this morning. [applause] I'm moving by inspiration this morning. He doesn't know I'm doing this. But but we appreciate we appreciate you. We love you. We thank you for the vision. And I heard somebody say, you know, recently in the last few days, we are grateful for the ministry that we are under. And that is I could speak that from myself. There are God called men in this season. Ephesians says, "For God has set in the church." It's not man voting. It's not man electing. It's not man choosing. But when God sets and puts something upon a man's life that you be identified within and without, then you know it's the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes. And the random taught us you can't go where your pastor can't take you. You can't live higher than your pastor. So by the grace of God as we come to this end of this year, we want to keep praying for our pastor that the Lord would strengthen him and like an eagle, he would fly even higher so we could fly as a church. Hallelujah. to where the food is gathered and the where the carcass is there, the eagles gathered together to get strong meat so we could deal with the issues of life. Can the church say amen? So we want to salute our pastor and all the ministers and the elders in the church who stand faithful, who are committed, who are dedicated. Brother Anthony, Brother Steven Oliveri, Brother Gideon, the song leaders, Brother Jason, [applause] [cheering] all the elders, the deacons, the trustees, the ushers, the technical team, the Sunday school team, the kitchen team, the hospitality team, the parking attendants, the gardening team, the welcoming committee, the prayer warriors, the mothers, the fathers, the grandfathers, the children, the young, the old, the healed, those that are about to be healed, the delivered, those that are about to be delivered, the free, those that are about to be free. It doesn't matter. We give the Lord praise. He said, "Thank him." In the good time, praise his name. In the bad time, do the same. Hallelujah. Glory. I'm telling you, we have preached it many times before, but this season is different. We don't have much time left. When you look and see America has put their troops in this place and this army's in this place and all these things they are doing has to wait on you and I to come into position. [cheering] It is not up to some war room and some political debate to decide what happens next. What happens next is determined by the bride of Jesus Christ. She is God's authority on the earth. Oh, you don't hear me this morning. Nothing moves until we say so. Hallelujah. Elijah shut up the heavens. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; There'll be neither due nor rain until I call for it. And the bride on the earth will have the power to shut up the heavens. Nothing will move until we speak. Hallelujah. You've got to realize who you are. You got to realize the power that's locked up in you. And that power wants to come forth because when two omnipotent meet, the miraculous must take place. And there's an omnipotent this morning in the person of the Holy Ghost. That same angel that never left the earth when the prophet left this of the earth now fixing things around for the coming of the Lord. But there's another omnipotent here this morning locked up in the seeds of the elect. In that elect precious bride of Jesus Christ who will be washed by the word, washed by the blood, cleansed by the spirit that the Holy Spirit himself will make himself known. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; So, we want to salute the church. &gt;&gt; I want to appreciate my wife who has put up with me and my daughter Isabelle that the Lord has blessed me with that we could be of service and of fellowship to the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And friends, it's later than we think. When brother Brandham said these words, he said, "It's got me scared that we haven't done enough. Have we done enough?" You know, and on December the 24th, just about 4 days ago, 60 years ago to be exact, 1965 to 2025. Has been 60 years since God in his wisdom took the profit of the earth. &gt;&gt; But the Brandon couldn't stay one more minute longer because his mission was finished. His purpose was finished. Every mystery had been revealed. Everything that this messenger was supposed to do had been accomplished because God will never take you off the earth unless your mission is accomplished. So if you are still here, &gt;&gt; can I say it one more time? God can never take you off the earth until your mission is accomplished. [cheering] So if those who are not here are not here, it's because their mission has been accomplished. But once there's still a mission in your life, God cannot take you off the earth. You could be sick. You could be tired. You could be walking this way, that way. But if there's a purpose upon your life, then you'll be in the house of God. You'll be fighting devils. You'll be dealing with the world. You'll be dealing with issues and challenges, but nothing's going to stop you because there's a purpose upon your life. Can the church say, "Amen." Turn to your neighbor and tell them there's a purpose upon your life. I'm just warming up this morning. It's the last Sunday, church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There are no more Sundays left. So, we want to put our all into it this morning. There are no more Sundays left. So, this is it. What you didn't do in the first Sunday, you'll do today. What you didn't do in the third Sunday, you'll do today. What you didn't do in the 15th Sunday, you'll do today. There's no more Sundays left in this year. So if you didn't get the opportunity to give the devil a knockout punch on a Sunday, then this is the Sunday to do it. You have no other Sunday left in this year to do it. Oh, you don't hear me this morning. If you didn't kick the devil, punch the devil, but the brand say booak. If you didn't do it in the whole year, then today is the only day you have left. Let us do what we could do while we could do it. We must work while it is day. [cheering] Everybody feeling fine? Hallelujah. Glory. You know, but you know, I'm still under mentorship. I'm still under training. But over to say, don't say I'll be I won't be too long with you. So, I'm taking instruction this morning. So, I'm not going to say that this morning. But by the grace of the Lord, when we come to the house of God, friends, it's to distress. But the Bon preacher say letting go of the pressure &gt;&gt; because this year was a lot of pressure you know. &gt;&gt; So wait that was just for me. &gt;&gt; This year was a lot of pressure &gt;&gt; and that how it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be a lot of pressure because the pressure is what proves the character in you. If there's no pressure there's no character to be proven. And we don't know who you are until the pressure comes. And when the pressure comes then we can see it that looks like a son. That looks like a daughter. Look at pressure. Look at stress and they're still standing. They should have given up but they're still in the house of God. They should have backslid but they dragged themselves into the house of the go. They maybe their mama brought them. Maybe their daddy brought them. I don't care but they're still here. So which mean the devil don't have them because they're still in the house of God. Can the church say amen? Glory. [music] Hallelujah. So I'm excited by the grace of God this morning. Can we stand to our feet just to read three portions of scripture for a little encouragement this morning from the word of God? I want to read Malachi 1, 2 Timothy 3 and Revelation 10 by the grace of God this morning. Malachi 1 verse one, the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. Reading 2 Timothy 3 and reading verse 16. All scripture is given by inspiration of God. Not some scriptures, but all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. And lastly, Revelation 10:7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he had declared to his servants, the prophets. May the Lord add his blessing to the reading of his word. Shall we just pray one more time? Heavenly Father, we thank you to be in your house on this final Sunday of 2025, Father. And Lord, there are so many who did not make it into this day. And Lord, we pray a special blessing, Lord. and everyone that's here, Lord, in the sanctuary.
