[1:20:26] day may God help
[1:20:29] us that we can break the
[1:20:31] word amen let's
[1:20:38] stand and turn our scriptures first of
[1:20:41] all to the Book of Leviticus
[1:20:45] 12: 1-3
[1:20:54] acts 7
[1:20:58] 6-8 and then we'll read Revelations 23 I
[1:21:01] want to put some scriptures to get about
[1:21:03] four of them short
[1:21:05] ones and then we
[1:21:07] will
[1:21:09] pray levius 121-3 the Lord spoke to
[1:21:13] Moses
[1:21:14] saying speak to the people of Israel
[1:21:19] saying if a woman conceives and bear a
[1:21:22] male
[1:21:23] child she
[1:21:25] shall be ceremonially unclean seven days
[1:21:29] as at the time of her
[1:21:31] ministration she shall be
[1:21:33] unclean on the Eighth Day the Flesh of
[1:21:37] his forkin shall be circumcised amen
[1:21:41] acts 7
[1:21:44] 6-8 and God spoke on this
[1:21:47] wise that his seed should sojurn in a
[1:21:50] string land and that they should bring
[1:21:53] them into bondage and ENT treat them
[1:21:55] evil 400
[1:21:57] years and the nation to whom they shall
[1:22:00] be in bondage will I judge says God and
[1:22:03] after that shall they come forth and
[1:22:06] save me in this place and he gave him
[1:22:10] the Covenant of
[1:22:11] circumcision and so Abraham beg Isaac
[1:22:15] and circumcised him the eighth day Isaac
[1:22:17] beg got Jacob Jacob he got a 12
[1:22:21] patries finally Leviticus

[1:23:07] civil work therein shall we bow our
[1:23:11] heads we
[1:23:15] pray Lord your Prophet taught us
[1:23:20] that when the Holy Spirit comes into a
[1:23:23] man's life we cease from our
[1:23:27] work because now we are taking your
[1:23:32] rest may you
[1:23:33] come as we have

[1:23:57] healing may you touch
[1:23:59] them those who have come Lord in a
[1:24:01] special way but you open our eyes of

[1:24:32] blessings upon the lives of your
[1:24:34] children that Lord by the time we live
[1:24:37] here your anointing and your grace will
[1:24:40] rest upon us in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:24:43] pray with
[1:24:44] Thanksgiving amen amen our final
[1:24:47] scripture before you sit Revelations
[1:24:51] 81 but Norris was hitting on that one as
[1:25:05] well to some people uh we should never
[1:25:09] read Revelations 81 because to them yeah
[1:25:13] it's a closed book still oh
[1:25:16] my but according to our Bible and our
[1:25:21] scripture when he had closed the seven
[1:25:24] no sir no sir that's good you reading
[1:25:28] with me then that's very nice so when
[1:25:31] they had opened the seventh
[1:25:33] sealah there was silence in heaven about
[1:25:37] a space of half an hour Glu we see the
[1:25:49] church now
[1:25:54] this Gathering
[1:25:57] here is not a political
[1:26:02] event this Gathering
[1:26:04] here is not a gathering of a soccer
[1:26:10] game this Gathering here all is not a
[1:26:13] sport
[1:26:15] event it is a convocation amen amen and
[1:26:21] one of the definitions of a convocation
[1:26:25] means that it's a summoned assembly yes
[1:26:28] sir it's called a holy
[1:26:32] convocation as commanded in the Mosaic
[1:26:35] law amen and these convocations had
[1:26:39] special days that they were held yes sir
[1:26:42] and it requires a gathering of God's
[1:26:47] people in fact some translators also
[1:26:50] call it a holy convocation or a sacred
[1:26:55] assembly now we know that any gathering
[1:26:59] without a true revelation of who Jesus
[1:27:01] Christ is is a bunch of drunkers who are
[1:27:04] meeting because whever two or three are
[1:27:08] gathered the Gathering must be God's
[1:27:10] provided place where he has chosen and
[1:27:14] the place must have his name at the
[1:27:17] [Applause]
[1:27:19] Gat praise the name of the Lord there
[1:27:22] are many churches many organizations
[1:27:25] some of them claim the worshiping God
[1:27:27] yeah but to them it might be an
[1:27:30] intellectual God it could be the god of
[1:27:32] science but we meet at the name of Jesus
[1:27:35] Christ because that is the revelation of
[1:27:39] God's name given to
[1:27:41] what so once we have gathered two or
[1:27:44] three in his name this is a solemn
[1:27:48] assembly
[1:27:51] hallelujah amen amen it's a gathering
[1:27:54] yes sir of Sons and Daughters of God
[1:27:58] Amen for one
[1:28:00] purpose just to come and worship the
[1:28:04] Lord in spirit and in
[1:28:08] truth and God
[1:28:11] plays special attention to this
[1:28:14] convocation yes sir that it must be done
[1:28:17] on the
[1:28:19] first
[1:28:20] day and the eighth day amen
[1:28:24] amen as a matter of fact the first day
[1:28:28] is the Eighth Day yes sir and the eighth
[1:28:30] day is the first day
[1:28:36] amen
[1:28:39] meaning when we get to the point of our
[1:28:43] life that we know what God has done for
[1:28:46] us we move from time to
[1:28:51] Eternity and as we are seated here today
[1:28:55] we may live in time but we are Eternal
[1:29:01] beings praise the name of the Lord now
[1:29:05] there was a reason why the Lord was
[1:29:07] giving these Feast to
[1:29:09] Israel in which they have to do these
[1:29:13] observations
[1:29:15] now Israel as a
[1:29:18] nation met in certain of these
[1:29:22] days we as God's children must have our
[1:29:27] scriptures under which we come to meet
[1:29:29] the Lord
[1:29:32] amen if if if if we don't do that in the
[1:29:35] context of God's word then we are out of
[1:29:38] context but we need to be in God's
[1:29:43] program so the first time that the
[1:29:45] number eight was given was when God
[1:29:49] after Walking With Our Father Abraham
[1:29:51] for
[1:29:52] years when he was close to about 99
[1:29:56] years old in Genesis 17 yes sir amen the
[1:30:01] Lord appeared to
[1:30:03] him and God began to tell him that he's
[1:30:06] going to bless him and give him a son
[1:30:11] Hallelujah Abraham let let's go to
[1:30:15] Genesis 17 for a second Church how many
[1:30:19] love the Lord
[1:30:28] thank you Brothers
[1:30:37] amen watch this and when Abraham was
[1:30:42] 90 n was 90 years old and N or 99 years
[1:30:48] the Lord appeared to Abraham and said
[1:30:50] unto him I am the almighty God walk
[1:30:56] before me and be thou perfect amen and I
[1:31:00] will make my Covenant between me and
[1:31:03] Thee I will multiply thee exceedingly
[1:31:05] yes and Abraham fell on his
[1:31:08] face and God talked with him saying as
[1:31:12] for me behold my Covenant is with thee
[1:31:16] and thou shall be a father of many
[1:31:18] nations
[1:31:20] am neither shall thy name anymore be
[1:31:24] call Abraham but the name shall be
[1:31:26] Abraham for a father of many nations
[1:31:29] have I made thee and I make thee
[1:31:32] exceedingly fruitful I will make nations
[1:31:35] of thee and Kings shall come out of thee
[1:31:40] and I will establish my Covenant between
[1:31:42] me and thee sir and thy seed after thee
[1:31:46] in their generations for an Everlasting
[1:31:50] Covenant Amen to be a god unto thee and
[1:31:54] to thy seed after theee all Abraham's
[1:31:57] seed will worship the god of Abraham
[1:32:01] amen I will give unto thee andto thy
[1:32:03] seed after thee the land wherein thou
[1:32:06] art a stranger all the land of Canaan
[1:32:09] for an everlasting possession and I will
[1:32:11] be their God yes and God said unto
[1:32:14] Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant
[1:32:17] therefore thou and thy seed after thee
[1:32:21] in their generation amen and this is my
[1:32:24] Covenant which ye shall keep between me
[1:32:26] and you and thy seed after thee every
[1:32:30] man child among you shall be
[1:32:33] circumcised and ye shall circumcise the
[1:32:36] Flesh of your forkin and it shall be a
[1:32:38] token of the Covenant between me and you
[1:32:42] and he that is eight days old shall be
[1:32:44] circumcised among you every man child
[1:32:47] your generation he that is born in the
[1:32:50] house or bought with money of any
[1:32:53] stranger which is not of thy seed he
[1:32:56] that is born in thy house and he that is
[1:32:58] bought with thy money
[1:33:01] must on these be circumcised and my
[1:33:05] Covenant shall be in your flesh for
[1:33:08] Everlasting Covenant look at verse 14
[1:33:11] and the uncircumcised Man Child whose
[1:33:14] flesh of his forkin is not circumcised
[1:33:17] that Soul shall be cut off from his
[1:33:19] people he has broken my Covenant and God
[1:33:23] said unto him Abraham as for sarahah thy
[1:33:26] wife thou shall not call her name Sarah
[1:33:30] but Sarah shall be her name and I'll
[1:33:32] bless her and give the a son also of her
[1:33:35] I will bless her and she shall be a
[1:33:38] mother of Nations Kings of people shall
[1:33:40] be of her amen then Abraham fell upon
[1:33:43] his face watch this and
[1:33:46] laughed said in his heart shall a child
[1:33:50] be born unto him that is 100 years old
[1:33:53] and shall Sarah that is 90 years old
[1:33:56] bear and Abraham said unto God oh that
[1:34:00] ishma might live before thee and God
[1:34:04] said Sarah thy wife shall be the a son
[1:34:08] indeed and thou shall call his name
[1:34:10] Isaac and I will establish my Covenant
[1:34:12] with him for an Everlasting Covenant and
[1:34:15] with his seed
[1:34:19] after so just let's enjoy these
[1:34:22] blessings a little bit
[1:34:24] yeah so here is the father of our
[1:34:29] faith the men that was seven
[1:34:32] Idols who never knew that there was any
[1:34:35] God hallu the god of his father Tara was
[1:34:39] to make Idols of stones and wood and
[1:34:43] brass and so in fact Abraham was an idol
[1:34:47] salesman right that's right that's right
[1:34:50] if I want to put in the plain language
[1:34:52] he was selling
[1:34:55] C and all kinds of Idols to
[1:34:59] people but even in that
[1:35:02] state he was a seed of
[1:35:08] God for 75
[1:35:11] years he could not find his way but God
[1:35:15] reach him
[1:35:16] Mercy reached down to
[1:35:19] Abraham and pull him out of idol
[1:35:22] worshiping
[1:35:23] and many of us Church Hallelujah have
[1:35:26] gone on maybe 30 years maybe 40 years
[1:35:30] maybe 50 years maybe 20 years but God
[1:35:33] reach him Mercy reach out wherever you
[1:35:36] are and God pulled you out of the
[1:35:40] condition am from the god of Idols to a
[1:35:45] living
[1:35:48] God it wasn't Abraham looking for God it
[1:35:52] was God who appear to him it wasn't us
[1:35:56] looking for God it was God looking for
[1:35:59] you you are here today because God came
[1:36:02] looking for you God was hunting wherever
[1:36:06] you
[1:36:07] are it's all by
[1:36:09] [Applause]
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:12] Grace
[1:36:14] Hallelujah and when God now started with
[1:36:17] him he been walking God told him I'm
[1:36:20] going to bless you and give you a child
[1:36:22] they've been waiting for you Years
[1:36:24] brother they been waiting for years
[1:36:27] until he's 99
[1:36:29] years Sarah is 89
[1:36:32] years and God now comes and says that
[1:36:35] you walk before me become perfect I will
[1:36:39] EST my Covenant with you I'm going to
[1:36:41] bless you with a child I'm going to
[1:36:43] bless you with a son Hallelujah then
[1:36:44] Abraham
[1:36:46] laughed that's right can a 100 year old
[1:36:50] man have a
[1:36:52] child and Sarah 90y old that was what he
[1:36:56] was saying but praise the name of the
[1:36:59] Lord he also knew the Bible now the
[1:37:02] Bible said Abraham never
[1:37:06] started you know why when he
[1:37:10] laughed God just said my son I will
[1:37:13] prove to you that I am
[1:37:15] God so God did not take whatever he did
[1:37:19] into consideration because his Covenant
[1:37:22] with him can never be
[1:37:24] an Hallelujah and many at high church we
[1:37:28] do stupid things we do crazy things and
[1:37:32] many a time God just have to because you
[1:37:35] are his son look over it so that his
[1:37:39] promise will come through
[1:37:46] you now this Covenant is going to give
[1:37:49] him amen where the Covenant of
[1:37:51] circumcision Hallelujah before Isaac was
[1:37:55] born God has already told him that I'm
[1:37:57] going to give you something to give your
[1:37:59] Generations what I'm going to bless you
[1:38:01] will extend to the generations of your
[1:38:05] children the sign I'm going to give you
[1:38:07] is going to be the sign of circumcision
[1:38:09] and every M child must be
[1:38:13] circumcised if you are not you're not
[1:38:16] part of me it said if there a stranger
[1:38:19] that come to your home if you bought
[1:38:21] with money they come to your home they
[1:38:23] must all have this sign of
[1:38:27] circumcision therefore if an Egyptian is
[1:38:31] in Abraham's house like Eleazar of
[1:38:35] Damascus was in elzar's house remember
[1:38:38] he was of Damascus and we were born in
[1:38:42] the house of Abraham so the man was
[1:38:46] circumcised which means there's one
[1:38:48] thing that when you have to common
[1:38:51] common to everybody is
[1:38:54] circumcision if you're in Abraham's
[1:38:56] house you might be
[1:38:59] circumcised just like he is you must be
[1:39:02] and when you come to the message it
[1:39:04] doesn't matter where you are you must
[1:39:07] have the Holy
[1:39:13] Ghost now when God use the word there'll
[1:39:17] be no Civ work or C work translating
[1:39:21] says that Civ mean there be no
[1:39:24] partiality there be no
[1:39:26] discrimination you cannot give a partial
[1:39:29] judgment you cannot prefer one upon the
[1:39:32] other and the only thing that bring us
[1:39:35] all together and make us one is the holy
[1:39:48] spirit so let's enjoy the 8 day
[1:39:54] now eight is not
[1:39:57] numbered with the regular days because
[1:40:01] we only have seven days in a
[1:40:04] week and God is giving numbers now in
[1:40:08] the Bible we don't have things like
[1:40:10] Tuesday Monday Wednesday Thursday these
[1:40:13] are Roman
[1:40:15] names right are you with
[1:40:19] me and the month of August and July and
[1:40:23] and June are all Roman
[1:40:26] names that's right but we use them and
[1:40:29] it's good we use
[1:40:33] them we still have to use them but when
[1:40:37] God is using his
[1:40:39] numbers God
[1:40:41] goes from the seventh he goes to the
[1:40:45] eighth and because there's no more
[1:40:48] number after seven you got to bring
[1:40:50] eight to be number one so eight start
[1:40:53] again meaning that eight is actually
[1:40:56] back to the
[1:40:57] [Applause]
[1:40:59] beginning

[1:41:14] voice calling his children or the seed
[1:41:18] that should be wherever they were that
[1:41:21] they must come into manifestation

[1:41:57] scriptures was
[1:41:59] raised on the eth day or the first day
[1:42:02] of the week

[1:42:09] was the first
[1:42:11] fruit that rose up he Jesus became the
[1:42:16] wave sheath amen
[1:42:19] amen so the wave sheep is time of the
[1:42:26] Resurrection which mean the resurrection
[1:42:28] of Jesus took place on the Eighth Day
[1:42:31] hallelujah amen and every child of
[1:42:35] God who is seated here must also be

[1:43:02] quickened when you have the Holy Ghost
[1:43:05] you are an eternal
[1:43:07] [Applause]
[1:43:13] being now from the web sheath God told
[1:43:18] Israel to count seven sabbaths until p
[1:43:23] Pentecost which will be the 50th yes so
[1:43:27] the prophet of the age came back and
[1:43:29] told us that seven sabbaths is actually
[1:43:33] seven Church
[1:43:36] ages that's
[1:43:38] right right I want to take my time here
[1:43:40] now
[1:43:41] church it's seven Church ages yes sir
[1:43:45] now in those Church ages the prophet
[1:43:48] taught us that Jesus was in the office
[1:43:52] of the Son of God right
[1:43:57] amen It Go are you with me
[1:44:00] church and according to Leviticus as you
[1:44:02] read when a male son is born he stays
[1:44:07] with the
[1:44:08] mother for seven days
[1:44:11] am but on the eighth day amen hallelujah
[1:44:15] the mother has to bring the
[1:44:17] child into the temple for circumcision
[1:44:21] amen so he moves from the matter from
[1:44:23] the seventh to the eth by
[1:44:28] circumcision Hallelujah but God is
[1:44:31] saying is that through the seven Church
[1:44:33] ages it was the Church of Ephesus it was
[1:44:36] the Church of smina it was a church of
[1:44:39] pagamos it was a church of Tia it was a
[1:44:42] church of sadis Church of Philadelphia
[1:44:45] Church of
[1:44:47] lodia but we got to
[1:44:51] move and get into another place where
[1:44:54] now the church belongs to
[1:45:02] God and so I want to put it blunt yeah
[1:45:06] tell us us we are not in a Son of God
[1:45:09] dispensation we are under the
[1:45:11] dispensation of the son of
[1:45:14] man that's right it means then that the
[1:45:17] ages are going on but the bride is not
[1:45:21] there God pulled us out and now we are
[1:45:25] in the bright
[1:45:26] [Applause]
[1:45:33] age and in the bright
[1:45:36] age the child is now belong to
[1:45:41] God we have left
[1:45:44] organizations brothers and sisters we
[1:45:46] are the Lamb's
[1:45:48] wife we belong to him he is our
[1:45:51] everything
[1:45:59] let me put it another
[1:46:00] [Applause]
[1:46:01] way when Jesus
[1:46:04] rose he walked on the earth for 40
[1:46:10] days
[1:46:13] now his first two pools healing and
[1:46:18] discernment was a public show that's
[1:46:21] right all right he healed all man of
[1:46:23] sickness all man of diseases he raised
[1:46:26] all man of
[1:46:28] [Applause]
[1:46:29] dead but brother when he rose from the
[1:46:31] dead come on come on but Jesus never
[1:46:34] went back to the
[1:46:36] public he never healed one person in the
[1:46:40] public he never went in 40 days time he
[1:46:44] never went to caas he never went about
[1:46:47] to anybody out there he said but what
[1:46:49] are you trying to say the ministry of
[1:46:52] the res Resurrection was to open the
[1:46:55] understanding of God's
[1:47:05] children so who was he working on two
[1:47:09] brothers come on who never
[1:47:12] understood when he told them that
[1:47:14] destroy the
[1:47:15] temple and I'll raise it
[1:47:18] up it pass over their head when he told
[1:47:22] them that as Jonah was in the belly of
[1:47:24] the
[1:47:25] whale you know the Jonah said it was a
[1:47:28] fish special fish Jesus said the fish
[1:47:30] was a whale that's right then people get
[1:47:32] confused like you don't understand when
[1:47:35] make a statement here he said he been a
[1:47:37] mistake yeah come on well if a wh is not
[1:47:40] a fish Jesus said the wh is a
[1:47:43] fish
[1:47:51] amen so what John was experiencing in
[1:47:54] his day he was experiencing because
[1:47:58] Jesus will come
[1:48:00] someday to reference that that's right
[1:48:03] for his
[1:48:06] resurrection you know the word
[1:48:07] Resurrection is not in the Old Testament
[1:48:09] it's not there you can't find it one
[1:48:10] place there not one way Resurrection
[1:48:12] there but when Jesus came he used
[1:48:15] it and he us it in types that's
[1:48:20] right he used it in types yeah as Jonah
[1:48:24] was in the belly of the a COR of GRA
[1:48:27] fall to the ground it Abid alone destroy
[1:48:31] this Temple I'll raise it up so is the
[1:48:34] rapture it is not in the Bible stated
[1:48:38] Rapture but God has seen it in the word
[1:48:42] Enoch Was raptured Elijah was
[1:48:45] raptured Jesus was raptured and we shall
[1:48:49] be raptured
[1:48:56] yeah you know there are some people if
[1:48:57] they don't see the word rapture in the
[1:48:58] Bible they don't believe
[1:49:00] it so if they don't see seven Thunders
[1:49:02] they don't want to believe it but
[1:49:04] brother Thunders is the
[1:49:07] word come on Amen are you with me amen
[1:49:11] all right so the uh sisters came early
[1:49:15] morning to the
[1:49:17] seara with embalming fluid yes yes they
[1:49:22] were coming to to keep Jesus in the
[1:49:25] grave so that he he will never
[1:49:29] resurrect and if Jesus remains in the
[1:49:31] grave we are
[1:49:33] finished Paul
[1:49:35] said if Jesus did not rise from the
[1:49:38] grave we are all miserable
[1:49:45] men he said but because he
[1:49:49] rose we shall also rise
[1:49:54] glory be to God
[1:50:01] Amen Hallelujah so our sisters never had
[1:50:04] the true
[1:50:07] Revelation you think the sisters did not
[1:50:10] have it what about
[1:50:13] Peter in fact one place he went a
[1:50:15] fishing he was even naked in the sea
[1:50:20] Hallelujah and then two brother were
[1:50:23] going to
[1:50:24] ouse then they were just talking on the
[1:50:27] road they felt so miserable that Jesus
[1:50:30] is dead they've killed him a man doing
[1:50:32] so good is
[1:50:35] dead and Jesus appeared to them in their
[1:50:40] ignorance walking with them haven't you
[1:50:44] heard what has happened how the high
[1:50:46] priest have killed the people while they
[1:50:48] were going you know Jesus just the Bible
[1:50:50] say it says you Fo
[1:50:58] slow to
[1:51:00] understand all that the prophets have
[1:51:02] told
[1:51:03] you brothers and sisters in fact Jesus
[1:51:06] is trying to say that just don't be dull
[1:51:10] amen all the time you got to sharpen
[1:51:13] your
[1:51:18] Revelation and he was with them talking
[1:51:22] until they invited him
[1:51:23] home still in the ignorance yeah and
[1:51:27] they brought Bread and Wine come
[1:51:29] on and when Jesus Took the
[1:51:32] bread and broke
[1:51:35] it they
[1:51:37] realized there's only one
[1:51:40] man who can break the bread like this he
[1:51:44] was the man we are talking
[1:51:46] about only him and when he realized that
[1:51:50] they saw him he disappeared
[1:51:53] at the breaking of the word they saw
[1:51:56] Jesus at the breaking of the word we see
[1:52:00] Jesus just when we see Jesus at the
[1:52:02] breaking of the
[1:52:04] word now you can worship
[1:52:16] him I think in Luke 24 45 it says that
[1:52:21] Jesus was for fulfilling all that the
[1:52:23] prophets the Psalms was was was was
[1:52:26] given right and the B said he opened
[1:52:29] their understanding that they will
[1:52:32] understand the scriptures which mean
[1:52:34] they walk with him for 3 years and a
[1:52:36] half they understood
[1:52:40] nothing and it is possible you could be
[1:52:43] in church never understand is preaching
[1:52:47] what we are preaching what we are
[1:52:48] talking about you have no clue but if
[1:52:51] God is merciful to flueless people he
[1:52:55] can be merciful to us this
[1:52:58] morning and open our eyes that we can
[1:53:01] understand
[1:53:01] [Applause]
[1:53:15] him so the circumcision of the Old
[1:53:18] Testament of the
[1:53:20] flesh is no more valuable now amen in
[1:53:24] fact Paul said circumcision is
[1:53:27] nothing now when Paul was saying that he
[1:53:30] was saying that with the understanding
[1:53:32] that we've changed
[1:53:34] dispensations from law to
[1:53:36] Grace amen now there are scriptures to
[1:53:39] compound Revelation anti typ to typ and
[1:53:43] there are many things fulfilled in the
[1:53:45] New Testament that the Old Testament
[1:53:47] will never be able to pass
[1:53:49] through for instance in the Old
[1:53:51] Testament if you're a left-handed man
[1:53:54] you can't be a priest yeah
[1:53:58] hello I said if you're a left-handed man
[1:54:00] you can't be a

[1:54:51] Israel that on the seventh
[1:54:56] month on the 10th day of the seventh
[1:54:59] month was to be the day of
[1:55:03] atonement it looks like Revelation 10:7
[1:55:06] to me amen that God is bringing the word
[1:55:10] to his
[1:55:12] children in this
[1:55:14] age now when Jesus walk on there for 40
[1:55:18] days he told the disciples the day of

[2:06:52] so I'm going to give a quote here if you
[2:06:54] can put a slide on on uh number 28 on
[2:06:58] the future
[2:07:00] home but Bram says that but you see
[2:07:04] there is no such a thing as eight days
[2:07:06] you go back to the first day again see
[2:07:08] the first
[2:07:10] day
[2:07:11] now the Sabbath speaks of the Old Law
[2:07:16] which was to pass away the keeping of a
[2:07:18] Sabbath which was pass away all I have
[2:07:21] said said changed to another yeah it
[2:07:25] didn't pass away but it changed from Old
[2:07:28] Law of keeping a certain day of the week
[2:07:32] amen and now they're getting into God's
[2:07:35] rest yes
[2:07:37] sir you enter into life not keeping a
[2:07:41] day or Shadow right that's right Paul
[2:07:43] said in Hebrews the 4th you keep days
[2:07:46] and shadows and things like that I'm
[2:07:48] scared of your experience we don't pass
[2:07:51] in to certain days and orders you pass
[2:07:54] from Death onto eternal life not days
[2:07:57] and times you pass into eternity that is
[2:08:01] the holy
[2:08:05] convocation amen glory 7
[2:08:09] days what which pass away all I have
[2:08:12] said will change to another 8 Days deals
[2:08:17] with New Creation not old creation eight
[2:08:21] his new creation amen
[2:08:25] hallelujah and so Jesus when he rose
[2:08:29] brothers and sisters it was a new
[2:08:32] beginning for many of us to have faith
[2:08:34] in the resurrection
[2:08:36] am and because he rose now listen to me
[2:08:39] carefully
[2:08:40] Church each and every one of us right
[2:08:43] now is rising with him
[2:08:53] now for it was on the eighth day that
[2:08:56] our Lord raised from the dead yes sir
[2:08:59] there is other convocation the Holiness
[2:09:01] not conc the Sabbath at all or the Feast
[2:09:03] of the Tabernacles or the Feast of
[2:09:05] Pentecost Jesus raised from the dead for
[2:09:09] our justification on the eth day amen
[2:09:12] after seven Sabbath or seven Church ages
[2:09:15] Jesus raised from the dead amen eight
[2:09:18] which is a holy convocation which is the
[2:09:21] first day see you done had passed
[2:09:25] through time and dropped into eternity
[2:09:28] again not keeping of days and keeping of
[2:09:32] sabbaths and new moons and things like
[2:09:34] that but have pass change your form not
[2:09:38] anal Glory but pass from Death onto life
[2:09:40] eternal what the bible teach us pass
[2:09:43] from one to another I like that church
[2:09:46] yeah God has changed
[2:09:49] you from what you well to what you
[2:09:54] [Music]
[2:09:54] [Applause]
[2:10:02] are eternity is like a
[2:10:04] ring you cannot find no corners you
[2:10:08] can't find no stopping place in the
[2:10:10] perfect circle amen I don't care how far
[2:10:13] you go you are still going you can't
[2:10:15] start going around like this and go
[2:10:17] through through far on the earth and go
[2:10:19] beyond the Earth you are still
[2:10:21] therefore what I'm saying is that when
[2:10:23] you have the Holy Spirit nothing can
[2:10:26] stop you from serving God how can you
[2:10:29] come this far and say I stop worshiping
[2:10:34] [Applause]
[2:10:37] God there is your holy convocation not
[2:10:41] having anything to do with the literal
[2:10:43] things is beyond that is into the
[2:10:47] kingdom of God with eternal life amen
[2:10:49] with a predestinated that never did
[2:10:52] starts it never started on any day you
[2:10:56] wasn't saved on any day you was always
[2:11:00] saved Jesus just came to redeem that but
[2:11:04] you were saved from the beginning
[2:11:07] because you had eternal life to begin
[2:11:16] with let's enjoy the one
[2:11:19] more what carefully see eight cannot be
[2:11:23] counted with a week you can't do it
[2:11:27] because there only seven days in the
[2:11:28] week count it anywhere you want Sunday
[2:11:31] the first day of the week see you count
[2:11:33] seven you go back again and start over
[2:11:36] the prophet is bringing something here
[2:11:38] and we live through these types here but
[2:11:41] when you hit e you go into eternity you
[2:11:45] don't come by laws and rituals and
[2:11:47] orders you come by predestination
[2:11:51] there is a genuine holy
[2:11:54] convocation and we are ending the seven
[2:11:57] Church age the Pentecostal Church age
[2:12:00] yes sir do you see it we are entering
[2:12:03] into that Holy convocation we are
[2:12:05] entering into that really General
[2:12:07] eternity where the church is called not
[2:12:10] to some station some denomination but
[2:12:13] into eternity with the Eternal King we
[2:12:16] don't have it at all no such thing as
[2:12:18] days and times your pass into it ity
[2:12:21] where you come from you was there to
[2:12:24] begin
[2:12:26] with if you got eternal life there's
[2:12:30] only one form that is God and you are an
[2:12:34] expressed attribute if you are not you
[2:12:37] are not going to be there no one can
[2:12:40] come to me except my father trust him
[2:12:43] amen all these old things but these
[2:12:45] don't see it speaks of Eternity the Holy
[2:12:48] Ghost is eternal you are in eternity
[2:12:52] where you was all the time you just
[2:12:57] recognize what
[2:13:03] happened you were made for an eternal
[2:13:06] purpose the manifestation of an
[2:13:09] attribute that was in God that that
[2:13:12] thought of you and express you and he
[2:13:15] made an earth took you out to make you a
[2:13:19] human being sin come along and perverted
[2:13:23] his way Hallelujah you come

[2:13:53] it in Ephesians 1:10 if you putting it
[2:13:58] down it is called not the dispensation
[2:14:00] of the seven days called the fullness of
[2:14:02] time yes and when the fullness of time
[2:14:04] has come that's when time has been
[2:14:06] fulfilled when there's no more time that

[2:15:11] baptism he can come and dwell with you
[2:15:15] we can sit in Heavenly places in Christ
[2:15:18] because we are already in him

[2:15:26] Christ Jesus how do we get into it by
[2:15:30] one Holy Ghost
[2:15:32] baptism by one Spirit we are all
[2:15:35] baptized into Christ which we are now
[2:15:39] won't be in Christ we
[2:15:41] are he is the great spiritual King over
[2:15:45] the spirit that is in us because we are
[2:15:48] all in him at the beginning
[2:15:51] [Applause]
[2:15:52] how many love
[2:15:54] [Applause]
[2:16:06] him now I want to bring two
[2:16:10] characters that were there on the eth
[2:16:13] day when
[2:16:14] Jesus came for circumcision
[2:16:18] Hallelujah let's take Luke chapter
[2:16:24] 2 and ver
[2:16:26] 21 and when eight days were accomplished
[2:16:29] for the circumcision of the child his
[2:16:32] name was called Jesus which was so named
[2:16:34] of the Angel before he was conceived in
[2:16:37] the womb how many know that your names
[2:16:40] were in the land book of life before
[2:16:42] your father knew your
[2:16:44] [Applause]
[2:16:48] mother G my father called me
[2:16:52] John my name on the
[2:16:54] book may not be that the prophet say
[2:16:57] your name on the book is not like on
[2:17:00] manev your name on the book is a
[2:17:03] mystery when the mystery of the age is
[2:17:06] unfolded and You by Revelation catch a
[2:17:09] glimpse of
[2:17:11] it God is calling you by your
[2:17:14] Revelation by your name
[2:17:22] and when the days of a purification
[2:17:24] according to the Lord Moses were
[2:17:25] accomplished they brought him to
[2:17:27] Jerusalem to present him to the
[2:17:29] Lord as it is written in the law as I
[2:17:33] read every male that open the womb Shall
[2:17:35] be Called holy to the Lord and to offer
[2:17:37] a sacrifice according to that which he
[2:17:39] said into the law a pair of turtle do
[2:17:42] watch and behold there was a man in
[2:17:45] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon
[2:17:48] Hallelujah and the same man man was just
[2:17:51] and devout amen waiting for the
[2:17:54] consolation of
[2:17:56] Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon
[2:17:59] him and it was revealed unto him by the
[2:18:02] holy ghost that he should not see
[2:18:05] death before he has seen the Lord
[2:18:09] Christ and brother it have been revealed
[2:18:11] by the holy ghost that we shall not all
[2:18:14] die
[2:18:26] he came by the spirit yes sir into the
[2:18:30] temple on the eth day when Jesus had be
[2:18:32] circumcised on the eth
[2:18:34] day and when the parents brought a child
[2:18:38] to do for him after the custom of the
[2:18:41] law then took he him upon his
[2:18:45] arms and blessed God and said Lord
[2:18:51] now let thy servant depart in
[2:18:54] peace according to Thy word for my eyes
[2:18:58] have seen thy
[2:19:00] salvation Hallelujah but I want to stop
[2:19:02] it for a second this is an old man a
[2:19:07] sage led by the
[2:19:10] spirit

[2:19:16] getting circumcised yeah but when he had
[2:19:19] Jesus
[2:19:21] on something came upon
[2:19:24] him and he began to bless God I said now
[2:19:29] I can go in
[2:19:30] peace for my eyes oh yes brother the eye

[2:24:23] metaphor he was actually seeing the
[2:24:26] salvation of
[2:24:28] God in every concr
[2:24:31] sense Jesus
[2:24:34] means uh savior or sin God or Jesus is

[2:25:15] of the
[2:25:17] Lord the joy of the Lord is my strength
[2:25:22] we are strengthened this afternoon with
[2:25:24] the joy of God in
[2:25:29] you oh sometimes some old people can
[2:25:33] Rejoice better than we young
[2:25:35] people Sister Miriam Moses senior sister
[2:25:40] when he saw Israel cross the Red Sea and
[2:25:43] saw all the Egyptians dead she to the
[2:25:47] tambourine and began to praise God

[2:26:02] [Applause]
[2:26:18] God brother religious Authority may seem
[2:26:20] gentle
[2:26:21] loving until when they
[2:26:24] contradicted when the religious
[2:26:27] authorities thought that Jesus Christ
[2:26:30] was revealing their
[2:26:31] hearts Amen brother they became hosti to
[2:26:35] kill
[2:26:37] him and any time that the God's word is
[2:26:41] been revealed trouble hat
[2:26:44] people that's right what Simeon saw that
[2:26:47] day was that Jesus was himself the word
[2:26:49] of God
[2:26:51] who had come to
[2:26:53] us people were seeing a
[2:26:57] baby but Simeon saw
[2:27:00] God
[2:27:02] Simeon had some inherent
[2:27:05] superpower that made it stand out from
[2:27:08] everyone else he saw God in
[2:27:12] Jesus because the spirit of God gave him
[2:27:14] eyes to do
[2:27:16] so but when God wants us to see his
[2:27:19] salvation
[2:27:20] he
[2:27:21] will nobody can stop you from seeing
[2:27:25] [Applause]
[2:27:33] God and there was another lady called
[2:27:38] Anna Anna means or
[2:27:41] Hana the grace of
[2:27:44] favor she's identified as the daughter
[2:27:48] of penuel
[2:27:50] now penel means the face of
[2:27:54] God his name may be in plain words since
[2:28:00] Anna was among the first to recognize
[2:28:02] the face of God when she saw the Infant
[2:28:06] Jesus hallelujah
[2:28:08] [Applause]
[2:28:10] amen in other words when you see the
[2:28:13] face of God it bring
[2:28:16] Grace and when we saw the face of God
[2:28:20] in the
[2:28:21] cloud it brought grace to the church
[2:28:25] because the head son is descending with
[2:28:28] a shoutings of Grace Grace
[2:28:35] Grace you know when Joshua was crossing
[2:28:39] Jericho the message he gave the final

[2:29:57] give God a
[2:30:00] praise you can't stop the
[2:30:02] [Applause]
[2:30:07] bride now let's come to our promise
[2:30:12] now Revelations
[2:30:15] 81 when the seventh seal was open
[2:30:21] I want all those outside there who do
[2:30:23] not
[2:30:24] believe that all seven cies was open
[2:30:27] according to my Bible since you want us
[2:30:30] to say what the Bible said the Bible
[2:30:33] says the seven seed was
[2:30:36] [Applause]
[2:30:39] open and because I am not a
[2:30:43] prophet God's word come to a prophet
[2:30:46] amen only a prophet can interpret am
[2:30:50] a scripture like
[2:30:53] this so brother Bram
[2:30:57] says in the
[2:30:59] message uh the Feast of trumpet
[2:31:03] paragraph
[2:31:04] 264 I want to say one more thing closely
[2:31:08] now don't miss
[2:31:11] this how
[2:31:13] striking from the seven angels that's
[2:31:16] messenger of the seven seal message in
[2:31:20] Revelation 10 that's right was the seven
[2:31:24] seal Amen in other words the SE is
[2:31:28] chapter 8 The Happening is chapter 10
[2:31:33] amen yes
[2:31:34] sir the reason why there's a silence in
[2:31:38] heaven it because there's an activity
[2:31:40] taking place in chapter 10 amen
[2:31:43] yes am God is the object of

[2:38:26] book come
[2:38:30] on because see the problem in eating was
[2:38:33] an eating
[2:38:36] problem and we got to fix it by
[2:38:39] eating so we add the tree of knowledge
[2:38:42] to bring the problem we are eating the
[2:38:44] Tree of Life
[2:38:51] [Music]
[2:38:53] joh said when he ate
[2:38:56] it it was
[2:38:59] actually sweet in his mouth amen when
[2:39:03] you came to the message you thought
[2:39:04] everybody was an
[2:39:08] angel you thought you go to a people
[2:39:11] where nobody will say nothing about
[2:39:13] you that every brother is sweet every
[2:39:16] sister is
[2:39:18] nice which of course it is but I'm also
[2:39:21] here to tell you that your bitterness
[2:39:24] and your
[2:39:25] trials will come around ranks of your
[2:39:28] own so when somebody is trying to make
[2:39:32] you
[2:39:32] bitter refuse it but let him understand
[2:39:37] that this word is sweet in my
[2:39:44] mouth and we must all go to trials
[2:39:49] let me repeat I wish I can tell you
[2:39:53] that uh brother John you know God love
[2:39:58] you so much that you will never have
[2:40:00] trials right come
[2:40:03] on Trials are the only way to bring the
[2:40:07] you
[2:40:13] out one time somebody was talking to a
[2:40:15] brother he said that
[2:40:17] uh you are very very
[2:40:22] fortunate if not for God because God has
[2:40:24] changed
[2:40:26] me you actually seen what I've done to
[2:40:31] you God have
[2:40:33] mercy right we don't want to go back
[2:40:36] there so you can never show
[2:40:38] longsuffering until somebody make you
[2:40:40] suffer
[2:40:43] long you claiming her
[2:40:45] patience how do you deal with your wife
[2:40:49] and your
[2:40:51] husband and brotherly
[2:40:54] kindness is not a
[2:40:58] [Music]
[2:40:59] phrase charity is not a
[2:41:04] phrase you can only show these things
[2:41:07] with a character inside of
[2:41:09] [Applause]
[2:41:12] you you know so sometime when you say
[2:41:14] Lord give me
[2:41:16] patience God said that you need more
[2:41:18] trials
[2:41:19] because only trials can break through
[2:41:25] patience and let me put it this way
[2:41:27] before I go onto my next one before I
[2:41:29] close character is not a
[2:41:32] [Music]
[2:41:33] gift character is a
[2:41:36] victory we don't have anything called
[2:41:39] gift of patience that's right and gift
[2:41:42] of
[2:41:43] longsuffering there's nothing like
[2:41:45] that amen amen oh this is is called
[2:41:48] patience
[2:41:49] called Grace it doesn't
[2:41:52] mean that because of their Nam they are
[2:42:03] not veryy
[2:42:05] name but sometimes sister patience and
[2:42:07] sister Grace can really make you
[2:42:09] understand
[2:42:10] that you have to see the grace of God in
[2:42:13] your
[2:42:14] life amen with me Church am so John to
