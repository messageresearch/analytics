[57:46] word of God our words will fill and um
[57:50] but God's word will never fail
[57:52] and I just want to take a short portion
[57:54] of scripture found here in Saint Luke
[57:57] chapter 4. uh familiar scripture where
[58:01] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[58:03] every word
[58:04] that is what the word is what gives us
[58:06] the feet
[58:08] Faith coming by hearing the word of God
[58:10] amen and the scriptures say Jesus and
[58:13] Luke chapter 4 Jesus being full of the
[58:15] Holy Ghost returned from Jordan was led
[58:17] by the spirit Into the Wilderness being
[58:20] faulted is tempted of the devil and and
[58:23] in those days he did eat nothing and
[58:25] when he were they were ended afterwards
[58:28] he hung God
[58:29] so what led him into the Wilderness we
[58:33] know this is his son in whom God was
[58:34] well pleased
[58:36] brother that was the lamb coming to be
[58:39] washed brother that was the word coming
[58:41] to the prophet John animal Jordan
[58:43] brother Heaven and Earth hogged and
[58:46] kissed Hallelujah it was a great
[58:48] experience only body boxer Jordan John
[58:50] said behold ilama God Christ was
[58:53] correctly pointed out Hallelujah he was
[58:55] correctly identified brother that the
[58:58] bride wouldn't miss him
[58:59] amen and brother G John said I have need
[59:03] to be baptized of G and Jesus said
[59:05] suffered to be so far become at us to
[59:07] fulfill all righteousness so as a bride
[59:09] of God many things we will understand
[59:11] but we fulfill the word of God
[59:13] hallelujah when that great event took
[59:16] place the eyes of that great Eagle
[59:18] Hallelujah met the eyes are journal what
[59:21] an experience that was in the water at
[59:23] that time Hallelujah
[59:25] and brother The Voice the heavens was
[59:28] open and the spirit of God descended
[59:29] like a dove and said this is my beloved
[59:32] Son Hallelujah this is the one and whom
[59:35] I'm well pleased and that Spirit we know
[59:37] the dove always leads us into battle
[59:40] so the dove immediately led the eagle
[59:43] Into the Wilderness to be tempted for
[59:45] what it is Hallelujah we know Forte is a
[59:48] judgment number Hallelujah but Forte
[59:50] also at the end of 40 days a lot of
[59:53] things come out
[59:54] Moses and Imam for 40 days a lot of
[59:56] Revelations came out at the end
[59:58] Hallelujah so the end of your trials
[1:00:00] there's a great Revelation coming forth
[1:00:03] and at the end of those 40 days brother
[1:00:05] he was a hunger the professors when we
[1:00:07] really fasting with God we can't get
[1:00:09] tired we don't get hungry but at the end
[1:00:12] of The Fast brother the devil was
[1:00:14] entitled to a punch and he came and
[1:00:16] Jesus being a perfect man he was a
[1:00:18] hunger Hallelujah and the devil came to
[1:00:21] him and he said no if thou be the Son of
[1:00:24] God if thou be
[1:00:26] he didn't really know
[1:00:28] the ministry was now starting he said if
[1:00:31] God be the Son of God command that these
[1:00:33] Stones be made bread Oh Glory not if
[1:00:37] thou be the Son of God he was the son of
[1:00:39] God Amen brother he was the son of
[1:00:42] Abraham as his son of Abraham he was
[1:00:44] heir to Palestine the Royal Grant amen
[1:00:47] as the son of man he was yet in yet as
[1:00:49] his son of David he's here to Detroit
[1:00:51] brother and a son of God he's here to
[1:00:53] All Things Hallelujah all things was
[1:00:56] under his feet amen
[1:01:00] brother Jesus then clung for the Devil
[1:01:03] the devil then hallelujah he didn't know
[1:01:05] the power that was locked up inside of
[1:01:07] him that was Emmanuel God in flesh with
[1:01:09] us hallelujah and Jesus now at the end
[1:01:13] of the 40 days he resorted to the one
[1:01:16] and he told Satan Hallelujah now Satan
[1:01:20] quoted the word c-o-a-t hallelujah he
[1:01:23] tried to court the word brother body
[1:01:25] Bride quotes the word q u o t e
[1:01:28] Hallelujah we go back to the world
[1:01:31] amen and Jesus went back to the word at
[1:01:35] the end of the 40 days in Deuteronomy
[1:01:37] chapter 8 in the Old Testament Moses was
[1:01:41] showing them that God allowed you all to
[1:01:43] to sojourn these 40 years in the
[1:01:45] wilderness all right so Deuteronomy
[1:01:48] chapter 8 verse 2 thou shall remember
[1:01:50] all the way which the Lord thy God let
[1:01:53] these 40 years in the wilderness to
[1:01:56] Humble thee and to prove he to know what
[1:01:58] is in thy Hut so it wasn't that God
[1:02:01] didn't know but he allowed the test to
[1:02:03] see what is really inside of you and all
[1:02:05] that didn't believe the word the
[1:02:07] characters perish in the wilderness
[1:02:08] isn't that right
[1:02:14] look at it God's bread is now proud
[1:02:17] bride he humble them
[1:02:19] and suffered into hunger she had a thank
[1:02:22] God for hardships because true hardships
[1:02:24] and help you to be more humble Paul was
[1:02:27] given an informative flesh to keep him
[1:02:29] humble because of the abundance of
[1:02:31] Revelation to keep the humble Hallelujah
[1:02:34] and February
[1:02:36] Egypt didn't have manner
[1:02:39] Oh Glory
[1:02:40] which don't know it's not neither did I
[1:02:42] find us know that he might make it to
[1:02:45] know that man does not live by bread
[1:02:48] only but by every word that proceeded
[1:02:52] out of the mouth of the Lord that man
[1:02:54] left Hallelujah so look at this at the
[1:02:57] end of the 40 years of sojourning this
[1:03:00] scripture came out man shall not live
[1:03:02] and at the end of Jesus Is 40 days
[1:03:05] fasted the scripture came to life again
[1:03:08] Hallelujah so it is of great importance
[1:03:11] to us and not just the same scripture
[1:03:13] we're saying said Luke chapter 4 verse 4
[1:03:16] is the same scripture in Matthew chapter
[1:03:17] 4 verse 4 so Matthew brother presented
[1:03:20] him as a king brother Matthew 4 4 is the
[1:03:23] same thing
[1:03:24] man shall not let my brother Lord look
[1:03:26] who presented him as a man man shall not
[1:03:28] let my brother alone so it is of
[1:03:30] importance to us
[1:03:32] Hallelujah so you cannot satisfy a
[1:03:35] spiritual fight with a natural meal
[1:03:40] Hallelujah not bread alone but by every
[1:03:43] word that every word that proceeded
[1:03:48] not proceeded
[1:03:51] that proceeded it is continuous tense
[1:03:54] Hallelujah that word is still proceeding
[1:03:57] today brother we need the word made
[1:04:00] flesh Hallelujah
[1:04:02] that is Christ today
[1:04:04] proceeded out of the mouth of God that
[1:04:06] man LED
[1:04:08] man shall not live who is man Hallelujah
[1:04:11] man was
[1:04:19] the first man that was made was Spirit
[1:04:21] man
[1:04:22] it cannot be tempted
[1:04:26] that theophony cannot get hungry
[1:04:29] so that is not the man he was talking
[1:04:30] about Hallelujah but this man
[1:04:33] that is trapped this is the pesos this
[1:04:36] can get hungry
[1:04:39] but there's an inner man locked up
[1:04:41] inside of here for as much emphasis as
[1:04:43] we place on the outer man there's an
[1:04:45] inner man that will take care of that
[1:04:48] man Hallelujah
[1:04:49] you see man man was made only sixth day
[1:04:53] isn't that right six is an incomplete
[1:04:56] number
[1:04:56] all right
[1:04:58] sexual suffering
[1:05:00] you will work six days but the seven
[1:05:03] talk of arrest
[1:05:05] six years they were labor six years they
[1:05:07] were planned but when his seventh year
[1:05:08] is The Lord's release
[1:05:10] six is a number of men if you're lucky
[1:05:12] in the Bible brother they had the statue
[1:05:15] that the bell of Daniel that was an
[1:05:16] image to a man it was 60 cubitai by six
[1:05:19] cubits wide so six
[1:05:22] was the image of a holy man that was he
[1:05:25] popped back then but we see the pope
[1:05:27] down in place of the Son of God he sits
[1:05:30] on a seat and his numbers add up to six
[1:05:33] six six six sixes incomplete
[1:05:38] but God sent a power to come back 666.
[1:05:44] he sent us brother William Marion
[1:05:47] Branham
[1:05:48] 777 to come back 666
[1:05:51] [Applause]
[1:05:55] the believer when the believer dies the
[1:05:59] highest we could go is in his sixth
[1:06:01] dimension
[1:06:02] all right
[1:06:03] boys I believe when we die it's in his
[1:06:05] sixth Dimension but God is in the
[1:06:07] servant so there's something called into
[1:06:09] the servant right now we are living in
[1:06:11] the sixth day brother but he's seven
[1:06:13] days just ahead where there will be no
[1:06:16] more tears no more path no more sorrows
[1:06:19] so the seventh is calling us
[1:06:23] glory be to God in the highest you're
[1:06:25] watching Prophet Suffering The Prophet
[1:06:28] suffered all his life
[1:06:29] but this girl was only six inches long
[1:06:32] he always looked for the seven inch of
[1:06:35] that animal
[1:06:36] and your sixth note came down and it's
[1:06:38] just Queen the mother dreamed brother
[1:06:40] but the seven Dove is the one that
[1:06:42] brought the healing
[1:06:45] so that man is a supernatural man he's
[1:06:48] incomplete and what completes a messy
[1:06:50] word of God
[1:06:52] need the word of God to live by
[1:06:54] Hallelujah
[1:06:56] man shall not lay thy bread alone but by
[1:06:59] every word we need the word present
[1:07:02] tense and this bride brother is a eighth
[1:07:06] zebrae
[1:07:11] just to close quickly

[1:23:06] greetings to all I bring greetings from
[1:23:09] our little church in Valley Stream New
[1:23:12] York

[1:23:16] greetings from my wife sister Rebecca
[1:23:18] she had what I've loved to have been
[1:23:20] here and our people but we are we are a
[1:23:24] small group waiting for the coming of
[1:23:26] the Lord
[1:23:28] I like when brother Branham would greet
[1:23:30] the different ones in the Rapture tape
[1:23:32] there's a group over in Arizona this
[1:23:35] group way over there waiting for the
[1:23:37] coming of the Lord another group over
[1:23:39] there waiting for the coming of the Lord
[1:23:41] amen so no matter how bigger or big your
[1:23:45] group is just make sure you're waiting
[1:23:48] for the coming of the Lord that's the
[1:23:49] most important thing so God richly bless
[1:23:52] you amen once again if I forgot any
[1:23:55] anything or anyone uh I please forgive
[1:23:58] me and I was I wanted to say this I I
[1:24:02] haven't seen a good friend of mine in a
[1:24:04] while brother Lino Dorado I saw him just
[1:24:08] the other day God bless you brotherly no
[1:24:10] wherever we we've trans he's translated
[1:24:13] for me for many many messages around
[1:24:15] South America and God willing although
[1:24:19] my time is limited in travel uh I trust
[1:24:25] and pray that God will open doors for me
[1:24:29] to return to South America and if it's
[1:24:32] just a weekend or two then it would be
[1:24:35] worth it I love the people in South
[1:24:37] America amen and around the world
[1:24:40] because they have been so good to me and
[1:24:43] sadly I you know you have to live
[1:24:47] uh and you have to work to live
[1:24:52] I always say it's a thing you live to
[1:24:54] work and work to live
[1:24:55] and and so therefore God knows all
[1:24:59] things so therefore we are unhappy I am
[1:25:02] a happy person I'm going to tell you
[1:25:04] something because I've told the Lord I
[1:25:06] said I am not complaining about the
[1:25:08] cross I just ask you to help me to Bear
[1:25:10] the cross amen as long as I have to work
[1:25:13] for Pharaoh may he be gracious to me
[1:25:16] and I know that God will us take care of
[1:25:20] the rest so I don't want to keep you
[1:25:23] long I just have an hour message or so
[1:25:26] it's already 51 minutes I have it
[1:25:29] counting down and uh so God bless you
[1:25:32] we'll turn right to the word
[1:25:34] and we are
[1:25:36] uh so blessed to be speaking on this
[1:25:40] great thing
[1:25:42] of the faith that was once delivered to
[1:25:46] the Saints
[1:25:48] I like the brother who said it was
[1:25:50] delivered once
[1:25:54] I'm going to say that again it was
[1:25:55] delivered once
[1:25:58] and brother brother Branham said that
[1:26:01] Paul
[1:26:03] once he laid the foundation
[1:26:06] he himself
[1:26:08] could not fool his own church
[1:26:12] because the foundation was laid
[1:26:15] and the word says if me or an angel
[1:26:17] comes speaking any other thing let him
[1:26:20] be accursed
[1:26:21] amen the foundation was laid so we have
[1:26:24] got to find those landmarks we've got to
[1:26:27] find those uh promises that pertain to
[1:26:30] us and and nail them down amen and
[1:26:34] content for them amen so Ephesians
[1:26:37] chapter 4 and we'll have you seated
[1:26:41] is Ephesians chapter four we're going to
[1:26:44] start with verse 3 endeavoring to keep
[1:26:46] the unity of the spirit and the bond of
[1:26:49] peace and ironically this uh word
[1:26:52] endeavoring means to earnestly try to
[1:26:56] succeed
[1:26:58] and to strenuous strenuously uh to make
[1:27:02] a strenuous effort
[1:27:04] and Earnest attempt
[1:27:06] so this is what we have come to do
[1:27:10] to contend
[1:27:12] and to earnestly content for this Faith
[1:27:14] because I will say this that that faith
[1:27:18] is here now
[1:27:20] just waiting to be released
[1:27:23] we're often say that okay uh it's coming
[1:27:27] and you know and just we put things off
[1:27:31] uh at long distance but you know brother
[1:27:35] Brown said one day we'll be standing
[1:27:37] sitting preaching and love will come
[1:27:40] down and all that is wrong will be made
[1:27:43] right
[1:27:44] amen what is that that uh
[1:27:48] you know that perfect faith and remember
[1:27:50] perfect faith
[1:27:52] the faith rapturing faith is all the
[1:27:56] same thing
[1:27:58] uh Enoch had a testimony that he pleased
[1:28:01] God
[1:28:02] it is impossible to please God with our
[1:28:04] faith so he had to have rapturing faith
[1:28:08] Amen in order to be found not
[1:28:11] amen so uh there is one body
[1:28:16] so let me just start there there is one
[1:28:19] body one Spirit even as he are called in
[1:28:23] one hope of your calling one Lord
[1:28:27] One Faith
[1:28:29] one baptism
[1:28:31] one God and Father of us all
[1:28:36] who is above all
[1:28:37] and through all and in you all may the
[1:28:42] Lord add a blessing to the reading of
[1:28:44] his word let us have a word of prayer
[1:28:47] our heavenly father
[1:28:49] we have come Lord to this place and this
[1:28:53] portion of the service Lord which is a
[1:28:57] preaching of the word
[1:28:59] Lord we are absolutely helpless unless
[1:29:02] you come down and speak through our
[1:29:04] mouths and use our vessels dear God to
[1:29:07] speak something that would be uh
[1:29:10] anointed to your people Lord and we know
[1:29:13] that anyone can read this word but
[1:29:16] unless the spirit follows this word and
[1:29:19] make it alive to the people then it just
[1:29:22] sits on Stony grounds or Stony Hearts
[1:29:25] whatever but father I pray my prayer
[1:29:28] dear God is that you would uh every seed
[1:29:31] that would go forth May a find good
[1:29:34] ground May the people water it dear God
[1:29:37] and apply it to their hearts and their
[1:29:39] lives and say this is mine because you
[1:29:43] promised it and Lord may we push
[1:29:45] feelings aside may we push thoughts
[1:29:48] aside dear God because we realize right
[1:29:51] now our surrounding this assembly
[1:29:54] surrounding this house there are deeming
[1:29:57] powers all over wishing that they could
[1:30:00] enter in to this place but they cannot
[1:30:02] because there's too much power in the
[1:30:05] house of the Living God Amen but they
[1:30:08] try to make us doubt they try to use our
[1:30:12] minds to question your word father May a
[1:30:15] perfect Faith drop down tonight dear God
[1:30:18] in such a way where the cripples will
[1:30:20] walk in the blind will see and those
[1:30:23] that are captive dear God those that are
[1:30:25] depressed an oppressed Lord I pray that
[1:30:28] they would find a freedom and a liberty
[1:30:30] that they have never experienced before
[1:30:33] a father God for he who the son of man
[1:30:35] has set free is free indeed and we know
[1:30:39] that we are in that time father God land
[1:30:42] possessing time so we ask Lord God that
[1:30:45] you would Grant the things and do the
[1:30:47] things that you promise to do Lord and
[1:30:50] we know because we are believers father
[1:30:52] God and that takes Faith to operate
[1:30:55] their God your gift and your word we
[1:30:57] believe in your word the father we pray
[1:30:59] Lord that by the time the service is
[1:31:02] over May our hearts say did not our
[1:31:04] hearts burn within us Lord and everybody
[1:31:07] dear God go with their portion back to
[1:31:11] their respective places Lord and may we
[1:31:13] truly say oh my God the Holy Spirit did
[1:31:17] speak to my heart amen tonight and it's
[1:31:20] something special for me we ask it in
[1:31:23] the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God
[1:31:26] bless you you may be seated
[1:31:28] for a title for just uh 45 minutes I
[1:31:33] have now
[1:31:35] upholding the apostolic Banner of the
[1:31:38] faith
[1:31:41] upholding
[1:31:42] the apostolic Banner
[1:31:44] of the faith
[1:31:46] and I got this inspiration by I was I
[1:31:51] was driving to one of our sites
[1:31:54] that we have we have plenty of sites and
[1:31:58] I have the tapes on all the time and
[1:32:01] then of course sometimes I have to pull
[1:32:02] over to the side and and jot a couple of
[1:32:05] notes and just put that over to the side
[1:32:07] but brother Branham uh
[1:32:09] brother Ovid put out the announcement
[1:32:13] and he was talking about the uh the
[1:32:17] faith amen uh original faith and he said
[1:32:21] uh here's the quote that brother Branham
[1:32:24] uh actually
[1:32:26] um
[1:32:27] it was on the actual invitation
[1:32:30] or the actual video that was made of the
[1:32:33] invitation Jesus never questioned
[1:32:36] when he came back would he find respects
[1:32:41] although many seek respects
[1:32:44] they want to be respected people
[1:32:47] it's okay
[1:32:49] I often said if Jesus made himself of no
[1:32:52] reputation then what respects do we
[1:32:54] really have yeah but he was obedient to
[1:32:57] the cross
[1:32:58] so he never questioned whether he'll
[1:33:01] find Saints which he probably would find
[1:33:04] you know self-righteous people and
[1:33:06] things like that and he never questioned
[1:33:08] whether he would find righteous but what
[1:33:12] Jesus questioned whether he'd find or
[1:33:15] not is what I'm trying to uphold
[1:33:22] so I like what brother Peter Chandler
[1:33:25] did this morning there's a lot of things
[1:33:27] I'm gonna I guarantee you by the time
[1:33:30] this convention is over you're going to
[1:33:31] know everything about uh the faith the
[1:33:35] original faith when the son of man
[1:33:37] cometh willifying faith and the faith
[1:33:40] Etc but brother Peter Chandler come from
[1:33:42] a different angle here and a little
[1:33:44] different anger and I'd like to perhaps
[1:33:46] come a little bit from a different angle
[1:33:48] it's still the faith now
[1:33:51] amen so but brother Branham said this is
[1:33:54] what I'm trying to uphold so the real
[1:33:57] question that I would like to ask he
[1:34:00] said he says this is what I'm trying to
[1:34:02] uphold will I find faith when I come
[1:34:05] back and then he said that Faith uh in
[1:34:08] the message faith is a substance so
[1:34:11] we have something to uphold
[1:34:15] for too long the message has been
[1:34:17] trampled on
[1:34:20] and I'll be honest with you uh in
[1:34:23] general the message
[1:34:27] is more divided than it has ever been
[1:34:33] and brother Branham never taught that
[1:34:35] you know that
[1:34:37] so we're listening to another voice
[1:34:39] somewhere
[1:34:41] and so we have to understand that when a
[1:34:45] country sends their uh people their
[1:34:48] military their Fighters
[1:34:51] to War what do they have they have a
[1:34:56] flag and everyone unites around a flag
[1:34:59] and uh
[1:35:01] and for a while everybody has their own
[1:35:04] little Flags into different individual
[1:35:06] states to have uh all kinds I'm not even
[1:35:10] going to go into that because I don't
[1:35:11] have the time
[1:35:12] you know they have all kinds of beliefs
[1:35:14] all kinds of little Flags but when War
[1:35:17] comes they have to unite under one flag
[1:35:19] amen and when they go into the enemy's
[1:35:22] ground then they're United knighted
[1:35:24] under that one flag
[1:35:25] you see that's the banner in which we
[1:35:28] are and we have to withhold as long as
[1:35:30] we uh expect to be a United Army we have
[1:35:34] to fight under that flag
[1:35:38] you may come from a different Church you
[1:35:40] may come from a group you may come from
[1:35:42] with a denomination amen your flag is
[1:35:45] not the representation where people will
[1:35:47] fight under
[1:35:48] we've got to be United under one head
[1:35:51] and that head is Jesus Christ
[1:35:54] and that head is love that head is
[1:35:56] Charity praise God and charity never
[1:36:00] fail us
[1:36:01] amen whether it be tongues as shall
[1:36:04] cease whether they be prophecies they
[1:36:06] Shall Perish and they will cease to
[1:36:08] happen but charity never failth
[1:36:13] amen so if he sends his army out he's
[1:36:17] going to have to send them under the
[1:36:18] correct banner and love conquers all
[1:36:22] let me say that again love conquers all
[1:36:27] amen Love Will Conquer The Bull
[1:36:30] praise be to God Amen the bull had a
[1:36:34] plan to Amen to run into brother Branham
[1:36:37] and to flip him over and give him a
[1:36:40] couple of thoughts but when that bull
[1:36:42] ran into that atmosphere of love amen he
[1:36:45] ran into a cement wall of love
[1:36:49] praise be to God there's something about
[1:36:53] love
[1:36:54] amen when the bees amen went you know
[1:36:57] when brother Branham and I love how
[1:36:59] brother Branham uh you know he he lived
[1:37:02] and he could speak to Creation you know
[1:37:04] he had that kind of experience with God
[1:37:06] Amen when he was mowing the lawn and he
[1:37:09] accidentally uh ran over the Beehive and
[1:37:12] the beehives were the the bees were
[1:37:14] upset about their High being uh
[1:37:17] destroyed and you know knocked over and
[1:37:20] so forth oh they were angry
[1:37:23] you know and you know bees make beehive
[1:37:26] to make honey
[1:37:28] amen you find the best honey in the
[1:37:30] beehives and so forth amen but when they
[1:37:34] went over and began to surround brother
[1:37:36] Branham you all know the story I'm not
[1:37:38] gonna get into detail amen they ran into
[1:37:41] the sweetest honey that they ever
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:45] oh
[1:37:47] ho ho ho ho ho ho they ran into the
[1:37:50] sweetest honey that they have ever
[1:37:51] experienced in their life
[1:37:53] amen because that is a charity the amen
[1:37:57] that has got to be uh the bride has got
[1:38:00] to be Anointed with charity
[1:38:02] Love Will Conquer All Things
[1:38:05] love is the answer
[1:38:07] and we're gonna come down to a quote
[1:38:10] here just the minutes if the Lord will
[1:38:12] permit is that it shows that without
[1:38:15] love you cannot have faith
[1:38:18] so if we are if we are striving for that
[1:38:21] perfect love if we're striving for a
[1:38:23] love that Faith the original faith we
[1:38:26] cannot get there without having that
[1:38:28] perfect love
[1:38:30] impossible
[1:38:32] impossible
[1:38:34] amen hallelujah see and I like what
[1:38:38] brother Brown says in the message here
[1:38:39] God's preparation the kingdom of God
[1:38:42] shall rule how many believe that
[1:38:44] amen listen we are not working with I

[1:39:20] it

[1:39:39] in this sign
[1:39:42] but my kingdom is not of this world
[1:39:46] listen if men would not fight for Jesus
[1:39:50] because he had no Kingdom on this Earth
[1:39:53] I'm not fighting for nobody

[1:40:46] ask you can I can I get you get you to
[1:40:49] bring me a Trinidadian flag I wanted to
[1:40:52] illustrate something to you because the
[1:40:55] thing is no matter how much we unite

[1:43:49] brother Branham said if God would not
[1:43:52] permit his own mother into flesh and so
[1:43:54] forth not that he was his own mother but
[1:43:57] he God used Mary to Bear Jesus
[1:44:01] if he would not permit her to go to

[1:45:41] considered for Redemption

[1:47:16] almighty God
[1:47:17] if God has poured out grace to you we

[1:51:01] he saw Adam do the works of God
[1:51:05] but if you be the son of God
[1:51:09] turn these stones into bread
[1:51:13] why did he ask that is because he saw it
[1:51:16] before
[1:51:18] he saw somebody do it before
[1:51:20] Hallelujah
[1:51:22] Adam amen was a God on Earth
[1:51:26] do you understand that
[1:51:29] we live many times way below our
[1:51:32] privileges we think sickness is normal
[1:51:34] we think our backaches are normal we
[1:51:37] think covet is normal oh no no no that's
[1:51:40] Devils that are trying to take over
[1:51:44] this Earth is polluted and you know it
[1:51:48] brother Branham said hey God does not
[1:51:51] have to destroy man man will destroy
[1:51:53] himself oh yes he will but you see
[1:51:56] here's the thing we are going back
[1:52:00] we're going back
[1:52:02] to our original condition you may be
[1:52:04] seated
[1:52:05] so the main question I like to ask you
[1:52:07] amen what are we upholding
[1:52:10] we as ministers I trust I wanted to just
[1:52:14] everybody I'm talking about everybody
[1:52:16] not just ministers we all have
[1:52:21] brother Branham said in discernment of
[1:52:23] spirit
[1:52:25] that if you want to know
[1:52:28] what a minister a person
[1:52:32] if you want to follow somebody if you
[1:52:35] want to put your shoulder to the wheel
[1:52:37] find out what his objective is
[1:52:41] what is he trying to achieve
[1:52:44] for the kingdom
[1:52:49] not for his church for the kingdom
[1:52:51] see because here I'm stressing the
[1:52:55] ministry of Jesus Christ of Ephesians
[1:52:58] chapter 4.
[1:52:59] and there's been a lot of impersonations
[1:53:02] and a lot of teachings on Ephesians
[1:53:04] chapter four but I'm going to tell you
[1:53:06] something these individuals who are
[1:53:08] actually true fifo ministers have one
[1:53:13] purpose and one purpose and heart and
[1:53:16] that is the kingdom of God
[1:53:22] [Applause]
[1:53:23] and I don't know if you know this or not
[1:53:25] but a true faithful Minister can
[1:53:28] Minister Universal
[1:53:32] his ministry is effective universally
[1:53:35] you know why because he's sent to the
[1:53:38] body of Christ and the body of Christ is
[1:53:41] universal
[1:53:43] Hallelujah Universal
[1:53:45] I'm so happy to see amen people that
[1:53:48] come from everywhere amen enjoying
[1:53:52] everybody's welcome
[1:53:53] everybody is welcome everywhere we go
[1:53:56] everybody is welcome amen we're not
[1:54:00] crazy people we love this message
[1:54:04] we preached the promises of almighty God
[1:54:08] we believe in a prophet
[1:54:10] Hallelujah
[1:54:12] we contend for the same faith
[1:54:16] we may disagree here and there but it's
[1:54:18] still we should be still United under
[1:54:20] one head
[1:54:22] because we are fighting a common enemy
[1:54:26] you are not my enemy
[1:54:29] I am not your enemy
[1:54:31] brother Brandman was talking the other
[1:54:33] day and said you know if you had a bunch
[1:54:34] of people in Missouri shooting the
[1:54:37] Indiana and the the Hoosiers and so
[1:54:39] forth and the devil will stand by and
[1:54:42] just look and just wait for you to kill
[1:54:44] each other
[1:54:45] he has nothing to do you know why
[1:54:48] because you're killing one another
[1:54:50] and then when you finish killing one
[1:54:52] another he'll just clean up
[1:54:55] what an easy battle that was
[1:54:57] I don't even have to do anything amen so
[1:55:01] we've got to stop fighting one another
[1:55:07] that's what I preach
[1:55:10] that's what I believe
[1:55:14] I vow I will love my brother
[1:55:18] so the main question what are what is it
[1:55:20] that we are appalling now brother
[1:55:23] Branham says here now let's get uh I
[1:55:26] have 20 minutes as I promise 21 minutes
[1:55:30] I represent the faith this is a a quote
[1:55:34] that brother Brown says here and God has
[1:55:36] a provided way and now we're moving
[1:55:39] right
[1:55:41] uh right on into another great age
[1:55:45] brother Branham was looking for this age
[1:55:48] now way back in 1954.
[1:55:51] but he says something so profound
[1:55:54] so mind-blowing that he never I I've
[1:55:57] checked it out but he's never quite said
[1:56:00] it this way before
[1:56:02] but he made a point he dropped this seed
[1:56:05] for you and I tonight
[1:56:07] amen he said uh and now we're moving
[1:56:11] right in uh on into another age the
[1:56:14] coming of the Rapture of the church and
[1:56:17] in this we're living in the time of
[1:56:20] restoration of gifts
[1:56:22] see restoration of gifts he said and it
[1:56:26] stumbled many of their big fine churches
[1:56:28] it sent nazarenes backwards in May
[1:56:32] frenetics of a lot of Pentecostals amen
[1:56:35] but just the same
[1:56:38] see God is not responsible for people
[1:56:42] that fall back and get confused about
[1:56:45] the program of God he's not responsible
[1:56:48] for that he's responsible to keep his
[1:56:51] word
[1:56:55] remember only the predestinated are
[1:56:59] considered in Redemption
[1:57:00] see it's it's set Nazarene backwards and
[1:57:03] made Fanatics out of Pentecostals but
[1:57:05] just the same God is moving right on
[1:57:08] bringing in rapturing faith for his
[1:57:12] church that's right rapturing faith and
[1:57:16] it'll take those seven unknown Thunders
[1:57:18] brother random said amen what we have
[1:57:21] now is not enough to actually transform
[1:57:26] this body amen into a position that we
[1:57:30] can be translated now Enoch had it
[1:57:35] Enoch is your perfect type in the Bible
[1:57:38] there's no other type not Elijah no
[1:57:41] other Ty Enoch is your perfect height
[1:57:43] because Elijah although he was
[1:57:45] translated and so forth not transl taken
[1:57:47] up into fiery horses and so forth that
[1:57:50] he has to come back in Revelations to
[1:57:52] experience death
[1:57:54] Moses body was uh he died and the and
[1:57:59] the angels hid it
[1:58:01] and of course we know that there was a
[1:58:03] great debate as to a great fight over
[1:58:05] his body
[1:58:07] but Enoch
[1:58:11] he walked with God
[1:58:14] and he was found not
[1:58:17] listen one day you're you're not going
[1:58:19] to be found
[1:58:22] you're not going to be found
[1:58:25] Hallelujah
[1:58:28] amen no the FBI will find you CIA won't
[1:58:32] find you the Secret Service here and the
[1:58:34] island won't find you you know why
[1:58:36] you'll be so far past the moon past the
[1:58:39] start Pat you're going to a place where
[1:58:42] they cannot follow you
[1:58:45] oh Hallelujah it was a rapturing faith
[1:58:49] you see and Enoch had this testimony
[1:58:51] that he pleased God and the Bible said
[1:58:55] it is impossible Amen to please God
[1:58:58] without faith
[1:58:59] so so Enoch had that kind of translation
[1:59:02] Faith so uh so now let's continue so
[1:59:05] just the same God is moving right on
[1:59:08] bringing in the rapturing faith for the
[1:59:11] church that's right so tonight
[1:59:14] I
[1:59:16] represent that faith
[1:59:21] [Applause]
[1:59:23] the faith that was once only once
[1:59:28] delivered to the Saints
[1:59:31] in a way of a Divine gift
[1:59:34] so the Divine gift
[1:59:37] that God gave brother Branham
[1:59:40] and told him that no one else will have
[1:59:42] it
[1:59:44] was the gift of the faith
[1:59:50] because you can't impersonate that
[1:59:54] this is why brother Bram said no one's
[1:59:56] going to have it as long as I'm alive
[1:59:58] and the other people who's going to have
[2:00:00] it or the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:00:02] because it's not going to be
[2:00:04] impersonated
[2:00:05] you're going to have to die out like he
[2:00:08] died out you're going to have to live
[2:00:09] like he did Amen in order to have this
[2:00:13] gift from God
[2:00:14] [Applause]
[2:00:16] Hallelujah
[2:00:18] brother if that'll make you happy I
[2:00:20] don't know what will
[2:00:22] amen by way of divine gift amen which to
[2:00:26] my opinion gifts and columns he says is
[2:00:28] not my opinion but the Bible says gifts
[2:00:31] and callings are without repentance
[2:00:32] there's nothing you can do about it see
[2:00:35] God gives it to you
[2:00:38] you're predestinated
[2:00:41] in other words let me explain this to
[2:00:43] you God knows every single person that
[2:00:46] is going to be at that wedding supper
[2:00:51] in fact he knows it so well your name is
[2:00:54] already written on the seat
[2:00:57] reservation
[2:01:00] no one can sit in your chair
[2:01:03] [Applause]
[2:01:10] do you know when you have wedding
[2:01:12] ceremonies and so forth and the bride
[2:01:15] and the bridegroom they get they have
[2:01:17] mind battles where are we going to put
[2:01:19] this one and what we and you have
[2:01:21] placement cards and when they come in
[2:01:24] the guests oh where am I sitting and
[2:01:26] they're looking for their name
[2:01:28] they're actually looking for their name
[2:01:31] so I'm here to tell you God has placed
[2:01:33] your name
[2:01:34] [Applause]
[2:01:38] already reserved
[2:01:41] and let me give you another word of
[2:01:43] encouragement amen oh that the father
[2:01:46] has given me
[2:01:49] will come
[2:01:52] I'm not gonna lose one
[2:01:57] I don't care what the devil's telling
[2:02:00] you amen if you come from God you've got
[2:02:03] to go back to God again
[2:02:05] Hallelujah to the lamb
[2:02:08] amen why you are a part of God
[2:02:12] [Applause]
[2:02:15] oh my do you realize that you have seen
[2:02:18] you're already over the devil do you
[2:02:19] realize that how many knows that
[2:02:22] before the devil was
[2:02:24] I am
[2:02:27] you are
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:30] you were you were away before there was
[2:02:33] a star a moon whatever you were in God's
[2:02:36] in the back part of God's mind
[2:02:39] and the devil has limited memory you
[2:02:41] know although you think wow he really
[2:02:43] can remember 20 years that's nothing
[2:02:47] you may have done something 15 20 30
[2:02:50] years ago amen and he wants to bring
[2:02:52] that up to you
[2:02:54] amen as though it happened yesterday
[2:02:57] oh because he has a vivid memory
[2:03:01] but you know what what's so beautiful is
[2:03:04] that he fails to realize that uh we go
[2:03:07] way back
[2:03:10] way back
[2:03:12] I think I've said this before in
[2:03:14] Trinidad but we go way back
[2:03:16] before there was a moon before there was
[2:03:18] a star and you know as a train as it
[2:03:21] were the Redemption train going way back
[2:03:23] way back way back after a while the
[2:03:25] devil has to jump off that train
[2:03:28] because he was not represented in the
[2:03:32] back part of God's mind
[2:03:35] [Applause]
[2:03:39] and your name ends up in the blood
[2:03:41] section of the book
[2:03:45] your name has been transferred from The
[2:03:49] Book of Life to the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:03:51] where your marriage certificate your
[2:03:54] wedding certificate is laying dipped in
[2:03:58] blood
[2:03:59] [Applause]
[2:04:03] you know in the judgments when the books
[2:04:06] are open amen and God has to oh God is
[2:04:09] the only just judge you know
[2:04:11] amen no man can judge you because he
[2:04:14] doesn't know all things
[2:04:16] only God knows all things
[2:04:19] he has recorded all things except those
[2:04:21] things that have been erased by the
[2:04:23] blood of Jesus Christ so when he says
[2:04:26] you did this you did that you did this
[2:04:27] so don't you remember you did that okay
[2:04:29] let's play the video tape and here you
[2:04:31] have an attorney
[2:04:33] your attorney is Jesus Christ
[2:04:35] [Applause]
[2:04:37] father or he's speaking to the judge
[2:04:39] okay uh I claim that this man is
[2:04:43] innocent
[2:04:45] okay present your case well play the
[2:04:48] tape and there is nothing absolutely
[2:04:51] blank on the tape
[2:04:53] so then that Jesus Christ who is your
[2:04:55] attorney he then becomes also your judge
[2:04:58] and slams The the gavel down and says
[2:05:02] case dismissed saved by grace
[2:05:05] praise be to God
[2:05:08] oh Hallelujah
[2:05:11] I represent that Faith by way of divine
[2:05:14] gift
[2:05:16] amen so you realize amen the prophet
[2:05:20] represented the Faith by way of divine
[2:05:21] gift now listen rapturing faith perfect
[2:05:24] Faith the faith the prophet had uh I
[2:05:28] have 11 minutes amen it was all wrapped
[2:05:31] up in the Capstone of love that we all
[2:05:33] see here
[2:05:37] why did Brother Branham say that nothing
[2:05:39] but perfect love will make it there
[2:05:45] nothing but perfect love
[2:05:49] now here's what I want to say
[2:05:52] you have to forgive
[2:06:01] if I told you
[2:06:04] that you have to forget I would be
[2:06:07] preaching false Doctrine
[2:06:12] because only God can forgive
[2:06:16] and forget
[2:06:18] brother Brown said that he's he's not
[2:06:21] made us that way
[2:06:23] and the only reason we remember is for a
[2:06:27] lesson
[2:06:30] it shouldn't change our character
[2:06:34] it should still make us uh forgive
[2:06:38] regardless
[2:06:39] but I'm going to tell you something
[2:06:40] you'll be very dumb to walk in the same
[2:06:42] trap
[2:06:43] because you've learned nothing
[2:06:47] we forgive but we don't forget
[2:06:51] amen only God
[2:06:54] can put your sins in the sea of God's
[2:06:57] forgetfulness and remember them no more
[2:07:01] and that is only a benefit to the Bride
[2:07:05] of Jesus Christ every one of
[2:07:10] that's not in the land's Book of Life
[2:07:12] their sins will be remembered
[2:07:17] oh Hallelujah to the lamb
[2:07:21] amen hallelujah
[2:07:23] amen what time is it
[2:07:26] don't worry about I have to worry about
[2:07:28] it amen amen so now listen okay thank

[2:08:40] ashamed to come down to the altar amen
[2:08:43] and and cry out to God with with I
[2:08:46] remember years ago in the revivals
[2:08:48] people would run up amen oh God Jesus
[2:08:52] have mercy on me amen and there was
[2:08:54] nodding from the nose and everything and
[2:08:56] nobody was concerned about that
[2:08:59] because they had opened their hearts to
[2:09:01] God Almighty amen and God was listening
[2:09:05] and God filled them with the Holy Ghost
[2:09:07] and Fire what we need today is a good
[2:09:10] old-fashioned heartfelt holy ghost devil
[2:09:13] chasing true blue red hot bloodboard
[2:09:15] Jesus Revival

[2:09:55] Lamb's Book of Life amen nobody can help
[2:09:58] you but nobody can put your hand down
[2:10:02] Hallelujah to the lamb
[2:10:13] it's important to God
[2:10:16] it's important to God that we receive
[2:10:18] the Holy Ghost by experience it's
[2:10:21] important to God
[2:10:22] amen because that is amen the actual
[2:10:26] formula repent be baptized in the name
[2:10:29] of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[2:10:32] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[2:10:35] the promises unto you and to your
[2:10:37] children and to those that are far off

[2:13:03] did Peter think he was going to get away
[2:13:04] with that
[2:13:06] that the Angels get offended said okay
[2:13:08] that's it I'm not going to deal with no
[2:13:10] brother Bram said if God tells you to do
[2:13:12] something you might as well do it
[2:13:13] because somehow one way or another
[2:13:15] you're gonna do it
[2:13:18] you can run but you cannot hide
[2:13:23] but at the third time a man Hallelujah
[2:13:26] Peter finally understood that there was
[2:13:28] a need
[2:13:30] there was a deep calling to the Deep
[2:13:33] there was a need people needed to be
[2:13:35] filled with the Holy Ghost and that's
[2:13:37] how it worked on the day on on the in
[2:13:39] Apostolic times amen and he told them
[2:13:42] listen there's gonna be this is
[2:13:46] God knew Peter
[2:13:48] there's going to be people at your door
[2:13:51] don't ask questions
[2:13:55] no more questions
[2:13:57] just go
[2:13:59] amen because there was a need Amen to
[2:14:03] the Gentiles that group that gathered
[2:14:05] together amen and guess what uh when
[2:14:09] they finally made the connection through
[2:14:11] GPS God's global positioning system
[2:14:15] amen told them where to go
[2:14:18] amen and he knocked on the door said
[2:14:21] okay I'll go because I was already told
[2:14:23] that you'll be coming for me
[2:14:25] amen so he went
[2:14:28] now if God if that was the end of the
[2:14:31] story that would be the end of the story
[2:14:33] amen but there was something that needed
[2:14:37] to be fulfilled
[2:14:40] the sea germ was in Peter's body
[2:14:46] and I don't care how that much they
[2:14:49] fight this listen the seed term is in
[2:14:53] the bride
[2:14:56] somewhere somehow somewhere
[2:14:59] don't you tell me God don't fill with
[2:15:01] the Holy Ghost anymore amen the seed
[2:15:04] word seed germ is in the body
[2:15:08] [Applause]
[2:15:09] and while Peter yet spake the word the
[2:15:12] Holy Ghost fell upon them they spoke in
[2:15:15] tongues amen amen they were filled with
[2:15:18] the Holy Ghost praise God Amen and they
[2:15:21] were oh Peter was perplexed
[2:15:23] wow how can these Gentiles amen received
[2:15:27] the Holy Ghost as we have received them
[2:15:31] but I'm going to tell you what
[2:15:33] we've got to learn how to be a little
[2:15:35] independent
[2:15:38] whenever you have to call somebody from
[2:15:41] somewhere else another country is it
[2:15:44] okay to do this that the other
[2:15:46] no Peter had no time
[2:15:52] Peter heard from the angel
[2:15:57] the angel told them to go
[2:16:01] they're never said oh hold on let me let
[2:16:03] me get a hold of people in Jerusalem
[2:16:07] see what they think about it
[2:16:09] if he had done that he would have never
[2:16:12] gone
[2:16:13] because whenever you get men involved
[2:16:16] I'm going to tell you something
[2:16:17] Hallelujah they will ruin the program of
[2:16:21] God
[2:16:26] listen to the angel
[2:16:28] we're going to have to learn how to uh
[2:16:31] listen to thus saith the Lord
[2:16:34] whether you call headquarters or no
[2:16:36] headquarters listen I have no
[2:16:38] headquarters I'm so thankful the only
[2:16:40] headquarters I have is Jesus Christ amen
[2:16:43] when he tells me Amen brother bran said
[2:16:46] all they needed was a nod from God Amen
[2:16:49] and off they went praise be to God Amen
[2:16:53] of course so then he went back later on
[2:16:56] and explained to the the apostles in uh
[2:16:58] Jerusalem and they all uh understood it
[2:17:01] because they were one in Vision one and
[2:17:04] purpose one in Doctrine
[2:17:07] should not create a division
[2:17:09] so here is my oh I've already
[2:17:14] sorry
[2:17:20] your kingdom
[2:17:22] this Kingdom
[2:17:25] Jesus Kingdom
[2:17:27] is not of this world
[2:17:30] don't so don't try to please anybody in
[2:17:33] this clean Kingdom
[2:17:34] or in this world
[2:17:36] our Focus
[2:17:38] should be
[2:17:41] Kingdom focused
[2:17:43] kingdom of God base Jesus himself had a
[2:17:46] kingdom see but it was not of this world
[2:17:49] and in John 18 and 36 Jesus speaking to
[2:17:53] pilate he said my kingdom is not of this
[2:17:57] world and if it was and if my kingdom
[2:18:01] were of this world then would my servant
[2:18:05] fight
[2:18:06] that I should not be delivered Amen to
[2:18:09] the Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[2:18:13] hence
[2:18:15] so therefore if they did not fight
[2:18:19] and Jesus did not want them to fight
[2:18:22] because Peter pulled his sword out and
[2:18:25] cut one ear
[2:18:27] and Jesus and his grace of the temple
[2:18:31] guard he took that ear in
[2:18:33] healed that uh the ear of the temple
[2:18:36] guard
[2:18:37] he didn't want you to fight
[2:18:39] especially one another
[2:18:43] we're brothers
[2:18:45] we're coming to The Headstone now
[2:18:51] the coming of the Lord is at hand
[2:18:57] we have got to be so much like Jesus
[2:18:59] Christ
[2:19:02] until the bride and the bridegroom are
[2:19:05] united together
[2:19:09] we're blending in
[2:19:12] so don't tell me about your Doctrine
[2:19:14] don't tell me about all your Revelation
[2:19:17] unless it comes back to this
[2:19:27] I'll say
[2:19:29] good thought
[2:19:33] you know why
[2:19:34] because my Bible says
[2:19:37] there's one body
[2:19:41] we're all baptized into that one body
[2:19:43] amen
[2:19:46] one Lord
[2:19:49] not three how did we divide them all
[2:19:54] what what what what what
[2:19:57] part of the message are you in it should
[2:20:00] not be part of anything it should be in
[2:20:02] Christ Jesus Christ you see one Lord One
[2:20:05] Faith one baptism see so I'm here to
[2:20:08] preach unity and I hope that you
[2:20:09] understand one God one father amen of
[2:20:13] All Above All and through us all praise
[2:20:16] be to God see
[2:20:17] now I'm going to close I
[2:20:21] all right here here's what I want to say
[2:20:23] love produces faith I'm closing
[2:20:27] love produces faith
[2:20:30] not Faith love
[2:20:33] you have to love first
[2:20:37] before you can have faith
[2:20:45] we're talking about perfect Faith we're
[2:20:48] talking about the faith that was once
[2:20:50] delivered to the Saints amen we've got
[2:20:54] to love first
[2:20:57] the problem is is that oh well
[2:21:01] I will apologize when they do it first
[2:21:06] you'll be waiting for a long time
[2:21:10] but the Bible tells us we love him
[2:21:13] because what
[2:21:16] ah
[2:21:18] when we were unlovable
[2:21:25] he taught us when we were unlovable when
[2:21:29] we were not even thinking about God he
[2:21:31] loved us then
[2:21:35] and if he did that why can I
[2:21:41] so therefore I don't care go back to
[2:21:43] your church go back to say I love you my
[2:21:46] brother
[2:21:47] I love you my sister
[2:21:50] and mean it in your heart
[2:21:53] mean it in your heart I will guarantee
[2:21:57] you're gonna feel a whole lot better
[2:21:59] because the devil don't want you to say
[2:22:01] that or do that you see you'll feel a
[2:22:04] whole lot better
[2:22:05] you see and I'm not telling you as I
[2:22:07] said I'm not telling you oh yes just
[2:22:09] forget about everything in it yeah don't
[2:22:12] in other words don't let your memories
[2:22:14] affect you saying I love you
[2:22:18] see because that's the devil
[2:22:21] but say it with all your heart
[2:22:23] and do it with all your heart see so
[2:22:26] therefore you could join all the
[2:22:28] churches in the country anywhere you
[2:22:30] want it and make all the confessions you
[2:22:32] want but there but if there isn't
[2:22:35] genuine real Holy Spirit born again love
[2:22:40] in your heart your faith is in vain
[2:22:45] oh no matter how much you confess that
[2:22:49] you believe God that you have nothing uh
[2:22:52] that has nothing to do with it has got
[2:22:54] to be born in the human heart then
[2:22:57] you've got eternal life can never be
[2:23:01] separated from God
[2:23:03] oh my let me close with this okay you
[2:23:09] can stand to your feet I want to close
[2:23:10] with this amen because we're all
[2:23:15] I told the church
[2:23:18] I've heard many messages I've heard many
[2:23:21] wonderful powerful
[2:23:24] sermons
[2:23:26] anointings that would come down
[2:23:29] and yet
[2:23:31] you wonder
[2:23:33] what will it take
[2:23:35] for a real true
[2:23:38] Unity of the faith
[2:23:40] you wonder sometimes
[2:23:42] only God can bring a Unity of the faith
[2:23:48] and it can only be be based on his word
[2:23:52] you see no good lesson no good sermon
[2:23:56] can bring the unity the faith
[2:23:59] see it will take the Dynamics
[2:24:03] it'll take the renewing of your mind and
[2:24:07] your heart and your spirit amen to be in
[2:24:11] condition to receive now brother Brown
[2:24:13] said this and I'm believing it to this
[2:24:16] day 1957. I believe it's coming a time
[2:24:19] where Paul said where there's prophecies
[2:24:22] that shall fail where their tongues they
[2:24:25] shall cease I believe it's coming to a
[2:24:29] time till when the saints
[2:24:33] get together like this
[2:24:36] and just a love spirit
[2:24:40] will just sweep over the audience
[2:24:46] and just every person in there oh that's
[2:24:50] wrong
[2:24:51] will be taken out
[2:24:57] he said this back in 1957. see It'll be
[2:25:02] such a presence of the Holy Spirit
[2:25:05] so it'll take the presence of the Holy
[2:25:07] Spirit
[2:25:08] to do that and to transform us
[2:25:11] because we need to be inoculated
[2:25:14] yeah we have gone through the pandemic
[2:25:18] we've gone through a lot of things but
[2:25:20] the sickest body
[2:25:23] that brother Brown said he knows is the
[2:25:25] body of Jesus Christ and he's a real
[2:25:28] baptism of love so never forget this
[2:25:33] when we're striving
[2:25:36] for perfect love
[2:25:38] when we're striving
[2:25:40] Amen to come back to the original faith
[2:25:44] amen we've you we cannot eliminate
[2:25:51] the most important thing that is love
[2:25:56] what did now I spoke
[2:26:00] and
[2:26:01] at Harrisburg just recently
[2:26:03] about landmarks how
[2:26:06] the landmarks were set
[2:26:09] by our forefathers
[2:26:12] see
[2:26:14] and the Bible says don't move your
[2:26:16] neighbor's landmark
[2:26:19] whatever you do don't move that's an
[2:26:22] offense you know
[2:26:24] so for too long landmarks have been
[2:26:28] moved around
[2:26:30] and I want to say this that that brother
[2:26:33] Branham you may argue with me but I'll
[2:26:36] have a scripture to show you
[2:26:38] brother Branham didn't come to set new
[2:26:41] landmarks
[2:26:42] he came to reveal those that have been
[2:26:45] already established
[2:26:48] by the forefathers
[2:26:51] Hallelujah
[2:26:53] because it had been buried for so long
[2:26:55] you've taken this is why who was that
[2:26:59] was smoking a cigarette and or pipe or
[2:27:01] whatever
[2:27:02] Luther whatever and drinking everything
[2:27:04] they had to measure it but they had to
[2:27:06] work at that time
[2:27:08] amen but they didn't have a perfect word
[2:27:11] see but it's coming to Perfection coming
[2:27:13] to Perfection now amen he come to reveal
[2:27:17] the landmarks and now we know
[2:27:19] what belongs to us
[2:27:22] we perfectly know what belongs to us and
[2:27:25] I'm gonna tell you in case you forgot
[2:27:27] adoption is ours
[2:27:30] Perfection is ours
[2:27:32] rapturing faith is ours seven Thunders
[2:27:36] is ours the Seven Seals is ours
[2:27:39] Hallelujah every promise that was
[2:27:43] promised to be revealed is ours is our
[2:27:46] inheritance it falls within the
[2:27:49] boundaries of our inheritance
[2:27:52] Hallelujah this is why I'm going after
[2:27:55] it by the grace of almighty God
[2:27:57] amen don't you move your neighbor's
[2:28:00] Landmark whatever you do amen God richly
[2:28:04] bless you I ran out of time amen I'm
[2:28:07] sorry I have kept you a little later
[2:28:09] than than usual
[2:28:12] [Music]
[2:28:14] [Applause]
[2:28:15] [Music]
[2:28:18] when brother Branham made it to the
[2:28:20] other side
[2:28:22] let me finish with this
[2:28:24] this is why brother Bram said
[2:28:27] when he got over to the other side he
[2:28:29] wanted to see Jesus and of course he
[2:28:32] couldn't see him because he was in
[2:28:33] another dimension and he asked one
[2:28:36] important question
[2:28:39] will Paul's group be judged
[2:28:43] you remember that huh
[2:28:46] well so yes yes he'll be judge every
[2:28:48] group will be judged
[2:28:51] but he was specifically asking us well
[2:28:55] Paul
[2:28:56] the original landmark
[2:28:58] the one who said if me or an angel come
[2:29:01] preaching any other thing let him be a
[2:29:03] curse
[2:29:05] Hallelujah and he said well praise God I
[2:29:09] preach what Paul preached
[2:29:12] [Applause]
[2:29:14] [Music]
[2:29:17] Hallelujah it didn't matter uh about
[2:29:19] anyone else he said I preach what Paul
[2:29:22] preached
[2:29:24] because
[2:29:25] Paul laid amen the landmarks of the
[2:29:30] Apostolic Church
[2:29:31] amen
