[50:05] it's
[50:06] over Hallelujah you believe that there's
[50:08] one more push there's one more go at it
[50:11] brother sister there's one more chance
[50:14] that if you didn't receive your blessing
[50:16] during this meeting but
[50:18] today Jesus stood at the last day of the
[50:21] feast he said If any man thirst any man
[50:24] whosoever will let him come and take off
[50:27] the Waters of Life freely so you welcome
[50:30] today to dash into the promises of
[50:33] almighty God and we want to salute our

[50:37] about the message last ton night the pom
[50:40] of Freedom brother Olo We Salute You we
[50:43] bless you man and what a masterpiece
[50:45] that was what a
[50:48] blessing my just to see the the way the
[50:52] Holy Spirit led him to say certain
[50:54] things and and and uh after the meeting
[50:56] certain people begin to just Express how
[50:59] the they they understood this and they
[51:01] understood that and how that meant so
[51:03] much to them and and we so thankful and
[51:06] brother Ola said something striking he
[51:08] says you know when when Adam came on the
[51:10] on the scene he says before that a tree
[51:13] never
[51:15] died he says the enemy was bound because
[51:18] the Son of God Satan was right in the
[51:21] garden of him but he was bound why
[51:24] because there was a man of F ested son
[51:26] and again that comes up back in the end
[51:28] time brother where the enemy will be
[51:31] bound where by the manifestation of the
[51:34] sons of God and they coming back brother
[51:38] they in process there's something
[51:40] happening in the unknown world that the
[51:43] the Devils don't even know what's going
[51:44] to happen brother but there's going to
[51:46] be an activation uh all of a sudden uh
[51:49] like on the day of Pentecost the Bible
[51:51] says
[51:52] suddenly suddenly brother it didn't just
[51:56] they didn't know when it was going to
[51:57] happen but they were ready and I want to
[52:00] tell you today let us be in the right
[52:03] place at the right time so when the
[52:06] ignition happens the activation uh when
[52:09] suddenly the Dynamics come we in the
[52:12] right place to receive the promise of
[52:14] God
[52:16] hallelujah man I like my brother all who
[52:19] was stressing that that we got to get
[52:22] hungry we we sometimes too lazy we
[52:25] slothful we don't pray enough you see
[52:27] God uh when he came down and he met
[52:30] Moses in the burning bush you know what
[52:32] was God's words I heard the cries of my
[52:36] people and I have come down and I
[52:39] remember my promise so there's a lot of
[52:42] promises but the people must start
[52:44] crying for it the people must start
[52:47] getting hungry and thirsty and say Lord
[52:50] that's me every time a promise is
[52:53] mentioned you must say that's me
[52:56] Hallelujah you might be in a state I
[52:59] don't care but you must claim it for
[53:01] yourself and cry out for it well there's
[53:04] one more meeting brother and I believe
[53:07] God is able to meet with us he's able to
[53:09] touch us this morning as we break
[53:12] through those Realms as we break through
[53:14] every spirit and and brother over

[53:28] break into the spirit of God and once
[53:30] you get away from this man and you come

[1:07:44] them so one of them called me that I
[1:07:47] should pray for him he had like a kidney
[1:07:49] or liver problem or something he said
[1:07:52] The only person he could trust to pray
[1:07:53] for for him was
[1:07:55] me because he
[1:07:57] said he does not want people to know
[1:07:59] that he's
[1:08:01] sick because in our message in our
[1:08:04] ranks if they know he's sick of that
[1:08:07] disease they will say God is judging
[1:08:10] him they'll try to trace back his life
[1:08:13] and find something he did wrong some
[1:08:14] time
[1:08:15] ago and bring that thing up and connect
[1:08:18] it to his
[1:08:22] illness
[1:08:24] when Eola struck my country they say God
[1:08:26] was judging
[1:08:28] me put in the
[1:08:33] message so when we come to these
[1:08:35] meetings we looking for the sick to be
[1:08:37] heal it's not in our
[1:08:40] heart because in our subconscious we are
[1:08:43] even trying to see if God is not judging
[1:08:44] that
[1:08:45] [Music]
[1:08:46] man brother I don't want God's judgment
[1:08:50] I made mistakes but I want his grace
[1:08:58] I prefer God's grace than God's judgment
[1:09:01] can somebody shout hallelujah
[1:09:04] hallu I am not asking for his
[1:09:09] Justice because I might not pass his
[1:09:12] justice but Grace can rewrite my
[1:09:16] life can somebody shout hallelujah so
[1:09:19] this morning forget about your mistakes
[1:09:22] your mistakes is not really in the
[1:09:24] account it is really who you are in
[1:09:27] Christ what Jesus Christ has done for
[1:09:30] you you see
[1:09:32] [Applause]
[1:09:37] it that's really
[1:09:42] terrible so a lot of times we come to
[1:09:44] meetings to do you don't you don't even
[1:09:46] hear
[1:09:47] claims claims is of this
[1:09:50] message everybody is afraid to make a
[1:09:53] claim we preach the word but no claim
[1:09:56] because we are afraid we might not
[1:09:58] measure
[1:10:00] up to the claims we
[1:10:07] make but until you say
[1:10:11] it God can back it
[1:10:16] up can somebody shout hallelujah
[1:10:19] hallelujah be
[1:10:22] seated I want to get the atmosphere set
[1:10:24] for
[1:10:30] Revival we preach the Holy Ghost but no
[1:10:36] claim people are afraid to say I have
[1:10:38] the Holy Ghost because they think if
[1:10:40] they say have the Holy Ghost their life
[1:10:41] canot measure
[1:10:44] up they afraid to say I am an adopted
[1:10:47] son of the making they can't say
[1:10:50] that they afraid to say I am from the
[1:10:52] god class of of creation they can say
[1:10:56] that they afraid to say I am the
[1:10:59] continuation of the creation of God I am
[1:11:03] not another creation I'm the
[1:11:05] continuation they cannot say
[1:11:08] that because they are afraid that their
[1:11:11] critics might watch
[1:11:17] them
[1:11:18] Hallelujah I came I became a Christian
[1:11:21] God gave me Grace not to fear my
[1:11:25] mistakes one thing I know I am
[1:11:28] predestinated my spiritual history shows
[1:11:31] have always been in God's mind I cannot
[1:11:34] be
[1:11:36] lost I told the devil if I have to go in

[1:12:08] convert his entire people oh somebody

[1:13:55] declaring that
[1:13:56] today for thy seed to possess the Gate
[1:14:00] of his enemies I want to connect your
[1:14:02] seat back to an
[1:14:06] Ephesians because Ephesians is the place
[1:14:08] of the
[1:14:11] Overcomer no battle is lost in
[1:14:15] Ephesus God told Joshua no men no mortal
[1:14:19] men shall be able to stand before you
[1:14:23] all the days of your life that was his
[1:14:26] mandate to Cross Jordan and this morning
[1:14:30] we have a Divine mandates that no demon
[1:14:33] no Spirits shall be able to stand before
[1:14:37] this bride if you feel that way then say
[1:14:39] Amen this morning mayab me
[1:14:44] [Applause]
[1:14:46] seated so let's turn to the scriptures
[1:14:49] quickly I want to excite myself this
[1:14:52] morning I just hope you join me this
[1:14:56] morning glory to
[1:14:58] God hallelujah and Ephesians is here for
[1:15:03] thy seed to possess the Gate of his
[1:15:04] enemies for an inspiration that
[1:15:06] Ephesians brings us back to the Glorious
[1:15:09] age of the
[1:15:12] Overcomer so we don't have no business
[1:15:15] over
[1:15:16] here this flesh
[1:15:18] thing making your efforts TR that's over
[1:15:22] here
[1:15:24] over here we have missing limbs
[1:15:26] dysfunctioning lers and
[1:15:29] kidneys but over in
[1:15:31] Ephesus is
[1:15:35] different praise God
[1:15:37] hallelujah T
[1:15:40] 25-18 Galatians 3:16 but Peter read the
[1:15:43] same scriptures and Genesis
[1:15:46] 1:6
[1:15:48] hallelujah thank you
[1:15:51] Jesus okay let just s
[1:15:54] quickly he said and the angel of the
[1:15:57] Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven
[1:15:59] the second time and said by myself have
[1:16:03] I
[1:16:04] sworn say the Lord for because thou has
[1:16:07] done this thing and has not withheld thy
[1:16:09] son thy holy son that in blessing I Will
[1:16:13] Bless thee and the multiplying and
[1:16:14] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[1:16:16] heaven and as the sun which is upon the
[1:16:19] seashore and thy seed shall possess the
[1:16:23] Gate of his
[1:16:25] enemies that's your
[1:16:28] promise and in thy seed shall all
[1:16:30] nations of the earth be blessed that's
[1:16:32] how you stand this morning the whole
[1:16:33] creation is waiting for
[1:16:36] you yeah that's how important you
[1:16:40] are because thou has
[1:16:43] obeyed my
[1:16:45] voice Galatians 316 and now to Abraham
[1:16:48] and the seed where the promises made he
[1:16:51] said Not andto seeds as of many many but
[1:16:53] as of one and to thy seed which is
[1:16:57] Christ
[1:17:00] bece praise God hallelujah so what
[1:17:04] establish the Ephesians inspiration the
[1:17:05] Holy Ghost the B says Kenya doesn't
[1:17:08] represent the age of the Millennium we
[1:17:10] all know that his message it represents
[1:17:13] the age of the
[1:17:14] Overcomer the dispensation of
[1:17:17] overcoming because in Canan they killed
[1:17:20] and born and took cities see but but but
[1:17:23] it represent an age a dispensation of
[1:17:28] overcoming so the bride has an age a
[1:17:32] dispensation of
[1:17:33] overcoming and until we into that age
[1:17:36] that dispens began can't overcome at all
[1:17:39] hallelujah praise God can somebody say
[1:17:41] Amen to that church Hallelujah and Mal
[1:17:44] came back and connected this Joshua that
[1:17:47] the Book of Joshua as a book of
[1:17:49] redemption it said it it paraly the book
[1:17:51] of Ephesians
[1:17:54] right right and and the book of
[1:17:56] Ephesians is a book of
[1:17:59] redemption and the Book of redemption is
[1:18:01] Jesus
[1:18:03] Christ so the book of redemption is is
[1:18:05] not only a book but it is also a land so
[1:18:10] Ephesians is a book but also a
[1:18:13] land the land of the Overcomer so it
[1:18:16] starts both ways can somebody say Amen
[1:18:19] to that church can somebody say Amen to
[1:18:21] that church and and and Adam had this
[1:18:23] book in his
[1:18:25] hand so Adam in Eden was what was
[1:18:29] Ephesians there was Adam's
[1:18:31] Ephesus somebody say Amen to that church
[1:18:34] now Adam was given a seed of his word I
[1:18:38] think but the all talk that last night a
[1:18:40] seed of his word you see this seed of
[1:18:43] God is what we are trying to bring out
[1:18:47] not just any seed Mal revealed the
[1:18:50] entire Bible and he brought out seeds
[1:18:53] Hallelujah he brought out Church
[1:18:55] seeds Pentecostal seeds but in his
[1:18:59] message there is an original seed which
[1:19:02] he calls the seed of the entire Bible
[1:19:06] and he says Jesus is the principal theme
[1:19:09] of the entire Bible if you read the
[1:19:10] scriptures You Don't See Jesus with it
[1:19:15] again you see
[1:19:17] it so Jesus makes the Bible a book of
[1:19:21] life
[1:19:23] if you take Jesus Christ out of the
[1:19:25] Bible it is just a
[1:19:27] [Applause]
[1:19:29] book there is no life in it but once
[1:19:32] Jesus is injected into the Bible it
[1:19:35] becomes a book of life the Lamb's Book
[1:19:39] of Life can somebody say Amen to that
[1:19:41] church so we can't just preach word word
[1:19:45] word no
[1:19:48] [Applause]
[1:19:50] Jesus we've got to connect Jesus the
[1:19:53] Holy Spirit to the word to make that
[1:19:57] word
[1:20:00] life may me see
[1:20:02] that let me see
[1:20:08] that so when R
[1:20:11] came he opened the seals now listen
[1:20:15] carefully because don't miss
[1:20:19] this but the
[1:20:21] Bram went before the
[1:20:24] beginning no Theologian did
[1:20:28] that before there was a time before
[1:20:32] there was an angel before there was let
[1:20:35] there
[1:20:36] be he existed as Elohim self
[1:20:42] existing self
[1:20:44] knowing Hallelujah but he existed with
[1:20:48] attributes which are called
[1:20:51] thoughts
[1:20:53] [Applause]
[1:20:55] that was his nature to be a savior not
[1:20:59] to be a destroyer but to be a savior to
[1:21:03] be a son to be a father that is God's
[1:21:07] original attributes he want to be a
[1:21:09] father to you he want to be a son to you
[1:21:13] let me see it that is his nature his cor
[1:21:16] nature Hallelujah and out of that nature
[1:21:19] comes mercy and Grace and forgiveness
[1:21:29] H then God expressed those
[1:21:34] attribute into virtues and Thunders they
[1:21:36] became the
[1:21:37] lugus the
[1:21:41] word and we were are members of his
[1:21:44] body members of the
[1:21:48] lcus can somebody say Amen then Elohim
[1:21:52] not spoke to the
[1:21:53] logos that let us make man in our image
[1:21:56] Jesus Christ the logos was the image of
[1:21:58] God we all know
[1:22:01] that but that image was not a
[1:22:05] shadow it was a being a
[1:22:09] person God's image is not like your
[1:22:14] image when God speaks of an image he
[1:22:17] speaks of a
[1:22:19] being If His Image comes here right now
[1:22:22] this place could be
[1:22:24] loosed you see it so Jesus Christ is the
[1:22:28] image of God is the express image of the
[1:22:31] invisible God that means when you see
[1:22:33] Jesus you see God because Jesus reveals
[1:22:36] God because God is a mystery see
[1:22:42] it that Elohim spoke to logos let us
[1:22:45] make man in our
[1:22:47] image then God created Man In His Image
[1:22:50] after his own
[1:22:51] likeness but the prophet said that was a
[1:22:53] seed of his word a seed is only a
[1:22:55] potential
[1:22:59] tree a seed needs
[1:23:02] growth to becomes a
[1:23:05] tree when you take a seed in a tree
[1:23:08] there's no semblance between the two but
[1:23:10] the seed has transforming power once you
[1:23:13] s that seed there is a law on that seed
[1:23:16] to transform itself and becomes a
[1:23:19] [Applause]
[1:23:21] tree so when you hold the seed you might
[1:23:24] not see anything in that seed that looks
[1:23:27] like a
[1:23:31] tree until you saw that seed on good
[1:23:35] ground then there is an invisible law
[1:23:38] you don't see that law that's hanging
[1:23:41] over that seed but once you plant that
[1:23:44] seed that LW takes effects so you
[1:23:47] activate the law where you plant the
[1:23:49] seed you don't need to see the law you
[1:23:52] don't need to feel the law the law is
[1:23:55] hanging there but you've got to activate
[1:23:57] the law by sewing the seed let somebody
[1:24:00] shout hallelujah
[1:24:02] H
[1:24:06] yeah may see
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:11] that if you have to wait until you see
[1:24:15] the
[1:24:16] law you will sow that
[1:24:19] seed so sowing the seed
[1:24:23] is your faith expressed in activating
[1:24:27] the law that makes that seed bring forth
[1:24:30] after it can and once you saw that seed
[1:24:34] you can go and rest the seed has
[1:24:37] Potentials in itself to bring forth
[1:24:39] after it kind that's God's law let the
[1:24:43] house shout hallelujah May
[1:24:47] [Applause]
[1:24:49] seated let be
[1:24:51] seated
[1:24:53] and what we lack in the church today is
[1:24:58] sewing because sewing goes with tears
[1:25:02] sowing goes with labor sowing goes with
[1:25:05] pain but until we s because showing is
[1:25:09] how you express your faith in the Lord
[1:25:13] to bring forth out it kind hallelujah
[1:25:16] praise God and brother Bram brought out
[1:25:19] the seed of the original Bible
[1:25:25] and he took that seat to
[1:25:27] himself
[1:25:32] SE the seed of
[1:25:35] God so when he said he came to put a
[1:25:38] revelation on Genesis 26 that when God
[1:25:42] made his Man In His Image he was a seed
[1:25:44] of his
[1:25:46] word but the man has
[1:25:50] potentials to become like
[1:25:54] God then he gave that seed a
[1:25:57] commission he said be
[1:26:00] fruitful and multiply but the Pam said
[1:26:03] Adam never came to
[1:26:07] that that means he never came to the
[1:26:09] fruit of his
[1:26:13] seed because that was a
[1:26:16] commission because the fruitfulness of
[1:26:18] Adam was to reproduce all like Precious
[1:26:21] Sons
[1:26:23] that means we were the seed we were the
[1:26:25] fruit of that seed so if Adam had come
[1:26:28] to
[1:26:29] fruitfulness it would have been you and
[1:26:32] me standing here
[1:26:35] today oh somebody say that
[1:26:38] [Applause]
[1:26:41] church so Adam could not come to his
[1:26:46] Commission because he himself had to
[1:26:51] overcome
[1:26:53] so he failed in his
[1:26:55] commission but God sent a second
[1:26:57] [Music]
[1:26:58] [Applause]
[1:27:00] Adam his name is
[1:27:03] [Applause]
[1:27:05] Jesus and Jesus says without me you
[1:27:08] can't bear
[1:27:10] fruit because he is the fruit of your
[1:27:15] seed that means when your seed brings
[1:27:18] back after its kind it will produces who
[1:27:21] Jesus Christ
[1:27:22] you've got to believe this man seven
[1:27:25] thought that gives you Faith to believe
[1:27:27] this don't put your mind
[1:27:30] there let me see that many of us we are
[1:27:33] sympathizing we are negotiating god with
[1:27:36] our
[1:27:37] spirit
[1:27:44] see I want to preach this
[1:27:51] morning
[1:27:53] please give me time let us just rejoice
[1:27:56] in the words because the Holy Ghost will
[1:27:59] surely
[1:28:00] fall and if you don't have the Holy
[1:28:02] Ghost you shall be sealed but let's
[1:28:05] enjoy the word this
[1:28:07] [Applause]
[1:28:10] morning
[1:28:12] see why do I love genes
[1:28:15] story that's the only place we can go
[1:28:17] back to our world
[1:28:19] image Pentecost has can go there
[1:28:24] yes so the three for mystery of God was
[1:28:28] to restore us back to
[1:28:32] Eden say Amen to that say Amen to that
[1:28:36] and that you your
[1:28:38] promise and Jesus Christ makes that ple
[1:28:41] for Revelation because he reveals who
[1:28:43] God is because God was hid in Christ so
[1:28:47] you won't even know who God is except
[1:28:49] you see Jesus then how do you you know
[1:28:52] who you are you be also hid in God in
[1:28:54] Christ he said because our life was hid
[1:28:57] in God through Christ you can't see your
[1:29:00] life except you see Jesus so Jesus
[1:29:03] Christ is the center of the revelation
[1:29:05] of God and you as
[1:29:09] well let me
[1:29:11] see so how can you know who you are
[1:29:14] without
[1:29:19] Jesus let SE
[1:29:24] and I I'm not just about about
[1:29:25] Revelation now but the knowledge of the
[1:29:33] son a real God Minister want to to the
[1:29:40] knowledge it's a g knowledge kind not
[1:29:43] just when you know through your brain
[1:29:45] it's an experiential
[1:29:47] knowledge when you know Jesus and the
[1:29:50] Forgiveness of your sins and you know
[1:29:53] Jesus in the power of his
[1:29:56] resurrection that's a different kind of
[1:29:58] knowledge it's a knowledge that comes to
[1:30:01] you by
[1:30:02] experience that makes you know that you
[1:30:05] know that you know that you
[1:30:14] know let me see
[1:30:16] that I was going to
[1:30:19] church but I never really knew Jesus
[1:30:24] until
[1:30:26] 1983 then I knew there is a power that
[1:30:30] can make you stop adultery make you stop
[1:30:33] fornication make you stop I knew God in
[1:30:36] the forgiveness of
[1:30:38] sin my life changed and that God is not
[1:30:42] dead is still alive he can still change
[1:30:47] you
[1:30:50] Hallelujah
[1:30:54] let
[1:30:56] see let me
[1:30:58] see so we need men today that can preach
[1:31:03] experience than
[1:31:06] theology to the many preachers they
[1:31:08] preach theology what the prophet said
[1:31:12] they've not partaken yet of the
[1:31:14] fruit how do you cross over Jordan
[1:31:17] except some spice come and convince you
[1:31:21] that the land is goat the land is real

[1:33:54] Hallam said Adam's
[1:33:56] theop has always been in
[1:34:01] Eden so in Eden was his
[1:34:03] theophany which was leading the animals
[1:34:06] like the Holy Spirit leads the church to
[1:34:08] be you see but Genesis 2:7 men was not
[1:34:13] tuned wasn't activated to eat so God
[1:34:17] came and gave adam a breath of
[1:34:20] life
[1:34:23] because that theop can't come on
[1:34:27] dry because the dove leads the

[1:35:02] you bring out you preach all this word
[1:35:05] no Holy Ghost
[1:35:07] Element no baptism
[1:35:12] element that word is
[1:35:18] chaff so it's the content of the man's
[1:35:20] message
[1:35:22] the
[1:35:23] element water blood
[1:35:28] spirit a whole message has no
[1:35:34] blood has no water in it has no
[1:35:38] life
[1:35:39] [Music]
[1:35:42] hallu I am preaching today man this is
[1:35:44] South
[1:35:45] Africa brother the rmon am i f to preach
[1:35:49] I'm preaching the words somebody young
[1:35:52] people coming now this is your season
[1:35:54] now this is your season now be SE may be
[1:35:59] SE that may me see
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:08] that that's why we we call them six
[1:36:10] seals they preach the
[1:36:12] word but no
[1:36:15] Jesus the elements that make the
[1:36:18] body no water of the word GL people come
[1:36:21] to church condemn what wash them
[1:36:25] out they are so sticky in their wrong
[1:36:27] ways they come to church for a cleansing
[1:36:30] but the word has no
[1:36:32] water the man come to church sleepy come
[1:36:35] sleepy no
[1:36:38] refreshing because when you take a bath
[1:36:41] what happens to you you feel
[1:36:43] refresh at least the de for that day
[1:36:45] goes
[1:36:46] off can somebody shout hallelujah this
[1:36:50] is what church is made up above when you
[1:36:52] come to church you come for a
[1:36:55] washing it takes away the guilt takes
[1:36:58] the fear and refreshes you for the
[1:37:02] blood the blood of
[1:37:05] [Applause]
[1:37:08] Jesus baby SE
[1:37:13] Hallelujah hallu you come from work
[1:37:17] you've been messed up in your office you
[1:37:19] made many mistakes you feel so clumsy
[1:37:23] you come to with a heavy
[1:37:26] Spirit what you need is the water of the
[1:37:29] word to make you refresh again because
[1:37:33] that not your stop you can still go
[1:37:36] on
[1:37:39] y the blood of Jesus keeps you
[1:37:43] safe let me
[1:37:45] seated Hallelujah but the P said the
[1:37:49] blood does not save you but it must keep
[1:37:52] you
[1:37:55] Sav so if the man is saved there's no
[1:37:59] continuous flow of blood that's
[1:38:03] dangerous the blood was not meant to
[1:38:06] save him but it was meant to keep
[1:38:10] [Applause]
[1:38:13] him so when the church loses blood
[1:38:16] people
[1:38:17] backslide they lose Faith they lose
[1:38:20] faith in their salvation they lose faith
[1:38:23] in their Redemption because there is no
[1:38:25] blood young people I don't care what you
[1:38:28] have done the blood still
[1:38:31] speaks I don't care your mistakes the
[1:38:34] blood still
[1:38:38] speaks Hallelujah let me
[1:38:45] seated and the
[1:38:47] life was only meant to follow the
[1:38:55] blood the life cannot
[1:38:58] come if there is no blood because the
[1:39:01] life rest under the
[1:39:03] blood and when the blood comes the life
[1:39:07] gives a token that the blood is here
[1:39:10] because you feel the
[1:39:14] spirit let me
[1:39:16] [Applause]
[1:39:19] SE let me SE
[1:39:22] Hall hallu you come for whole service
[1:39:25] you don't feel
[1:39:27] the says I'm identify with a
[1:39:30] group that fills your
[1:39:34] spirit we have the word of God is made
[1:39:36] manifest because to be a Christian you
[1:39:39] need to live in that
[1:39:41] atmosphere to be kept save you need that
[1:39:45] atmosphere so in this convention
[1:39:48] Hallelujah when did just come to a tent
[1:39:51] convention but to feel the spirit to
[1:39:53] feel the anointing to F the Holy Ghost
[1:39:57] shout hallelujah hallu let me seated
[1:40:00] it's the element of the
[1:40:03] word
[1:40:07] hallelujah so the content of a man's
[1:40:09] message is not how long it is it's the
[1:40:15] element and the church can only Survive
[1:40:17] by these three major
[1:40:19] element because those element to mix the
[1:40:22] body
[1:40:25] Hallelujah where is the
[1:40:29] water where is the
[1:40:33] blood where is the
[1:40:37] life that's the
[1:40:39] lifeline hallelu once that is missing
[1:40:44] that message is
[1:40:48] shock that's why we are so excited with
[1:40:50] this seven
[1:40:52] seal Lord have mercy Jesus Christ makes
[1:40:57] up that seven seal that's where you
[1:40:59] belong that's where your name is that's
[1:41:02] where you coming from from under the
[1:41:05] seven seal where there is water where
[1:41:07] there's blood where there's life under
[1:41:10] the seven seal you cannot die you can't
[1:41:14] be a church member you're always on fire
[1:41:18] Hallelujah you cannot stand you cannot
[1:41:22] [Applause]
[1:41:24] rock
[1:41:27] hallelujah
[1:41:35] SE when I came into this message that
[1:41:39] was one thing I had to
[1:41:41] do because I came from my Pentecostal
[1:41:44] church so I already know the Holy Ghost
[1:41:47] if I if it wasn't for that I'll have
[1:41:49] been lost in this message
[1:41:51] the first group I entered into said just
[1:41:53] believe you have the Holy
[1:41:57] Ghost that the message is the Holy Ghost
[1:41:59] that's all you need but I have known the
[1:42:02] Lord by your baptism before I came I
[1:42:05] know there is something called Holy
[1:42:07] Ghost I've received it I've tested it
[1:42:10] you can deceive me on
[1:42:13] that somebody say Amen to that church so
[1:42:16] I stood my crowns the first time I came
[1:42:19] into that church I was leing songs I
[1:42:21] just broken to tongue man said no no no
[1:42:23] don't speak in tongues
[1:42:24] here see that that
[1:42:28] Pentecost I said well but I thought this
[1:42:31] message should be had in pente so I was
[1:42:34] wondering that I had a man called
[1:42:36] brother kman the first man I heard say
[1:42:38] God said B of the I that's the group I
[1:42:41] belong
[1:42:43] to but thank God I have already known
[1:42:46] the Lord by way of
[1:42:49] baptism
[1:42:52] so you cannot deceive me now let for the
[1:42:58] devil and that is what I preach and I
[1:43:01] will not stop preaching it until the
[1:43:04] Rapture comes there is the Holy Ghost
[1:43:07] there is a change a transformation
[1:43:09] somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah
[1:43:12] there is a miracle signs and wonders
[1:43:14] that God is alive I will not stop
[1:43:16] preaching that that is my experience
[1:43:19] that is in my back
[1:43:21] [Applause]
[1:43:26] plate let you see
[1:43:31] [Applause]
[1:43:33] it let
[1:43:34] [Applause]
[1:43:39] see God made no mistake to bring the
[1:43:43] prophet after Pentecost has
[1:43:47] come it his days he said that that was
[1:43:50] why he had to go to the Pentecostals
[1:43:52] because they were the only ones that
[1:43:53] could receive the
[1:43:54] message because the Holy Ghost was
[1:43:58] there the method is
[1:44:01] can't the for the devil they don't
[1:44:03] believe in angels they don't believe in
[1:44:06] Holy
[1:44:07] Spirit they thought the prophet was
[1:44:10] crazy but the Pentecostals can't believe
[1:44:13] it because they experience the door was
[1:44:19] there this message was not meant to fall
[1:44:22] on
[1:44:25] dry the element of the baptism must be
[1:44:29] present and young people don't give up
[1:44:33] on that I don't care how long it takes
[1:44:36] don't give up on
[1:44:40] that because the day you receive it I
[1:44:43] tell you the whole thing changes the
[1:44:47] whole story changes the whole Lifestyle
[1:44:50] Changes ages you live in another
[1:44:58] world
[1:45:01] baby ra explains he ask him a
[1:45:06] question let me explain quickly ask a
[1:45:09] question about each person's Angel
[1:45:12] that's with him at
[1:45:15] path he put some mys
[1:45:19] there now he say explains
[1:45:21] how your at the angel which he calls the
[1:45:24] angel Spirit of the
[1:45:27] earth it tach that to your breath of
[1:45:31] life he says when the child is
[1:45:34] born see the life that child has is
[1:45:37] blood life hemoglobin
[1:45:39] life Jam of life but blood
[1:45:42] life because blood life makes your
[1:45:45] flesh because it takes blood to make
[1:45:48] flesh so the life of the flesh is in the
[1:45:51] blood you understand that quite well
[1:45:54] good but that life depends on oxygen to
[1:46:00] survive because if your blood has no oxy
[1:46:02] it cluts and you
[1:46:04] die correct I think the scientists are
[1:46:08] here somebody child is burn he has a
[1:46:11] blood
[1:46:13] life which depends on oxygen but it
[1:46:16] needs a
[1:46:19] spirit to make breathing
[1:46:22] impossible so if the Speak doesn't come
[1:46:25] he might breathe for a while later on
[1:46:29] die that's
[1:46:31] right all right because his blood life
[1:46:35] depends on oxygen that's the
[1:46:39] air that's not like that's just the air
[1:46:42] but he has a spirit and angels of the
[1:46:44] earth that ATS
[1:46:47] breathing that makes intake and outake
[1:46:50] of oxygen possible so if that doesn't
[1:46:54] come it's a still
[1:46:56] bath the child
[1:46:59] dies but it says that spirit is a dying
[1:47:03] Spirit after a while it dies but it's an
[1:47:07] angel Spirit of the earth is an a spirit
[1:47:10] given to you to help you breathe
[1:47:12] Hallelujah so when that Breath of Life
[1:47:14] lifes you say so your breath actually is
[1:47:16] a life it's not
[1:47:18] oxygen breath of life helps you to
[1:47:21] breathe in
[1:47:24] oxygen that's the life of your
[1:47:27] breath but is different from the life of
[1:47:30] your flesh that's your blood
[1:47:34] lifeall you must understand this Bic
[1:47:36] things in the message that's how it
[1:47:39] works in the
[1:47:41] spirit it says so that child has to be
[1:47:44] given a
[1:47:47] choice then the child makes its decision
[1:47:51] when the child does that that the angel
[1:47:54] of the Lord comes down which he said is
[1:47:57] a spiritual
[1:47:58] body which he calls the New
[1:48:02] Path and it says only the redeemed of
[1:48:06] angels not Sinners so once you make a
[1:48:09] decision to accept Christ an angel comes
[1:48:13] down you see but what connects you what
[1:48:16] activates your s to the angel is a
[1:48:19] baptism
[1:48:21] because just the decision is not really
[1:48:23] enough so there's an Angel by you right
[1:48:26] now that's close to you because you
[1:48:30] could not have come this far without
[1:48:32] that angel you see listen seated but you
[1:48:35] see our bodies we are
[1:48:37] dead to that Angel's
[1:48:44] presence
[1:48:45] see so natural
[1:48:48] people they are bright but they they
[1:48:50] natural they have Angels following
[1:48:53] them but their bodies are not
[1:48:56] tuned the body is not
[1:49:00] quickened to the signals of that
[1:49:05] angel so your PR when you receive the
[1:49:07] Holy Ghost as a baptism you become a TW
[1:49:09] full
[1:49:10] being you become a candidate of
[1:49:14] Association so the holy baptism
[1:49:17] Associates you with that angel you are
[1:49:23] connected says by that Spirit Holy Ghost
[1:49:26] he has a
[1:49:27] contact so without the Holy Ghost he has
[1:49:29] no
[1:49:32] contract but not having contract does he
[1:49:34] mean he's not there but you just don't
[1:49:37] have the
[1:49:44] contact so you make a
[1:49:47] decision the angel is there Sanctified
[1:49:49] the angel is there
[1:49:50] when the baptism
[1:49:52] comes it establishes a
[1:49:58] contact that angel now becomes
[1:50:03] real he walks with you he talks with you
[1:50:07] he gives you messages you are now in
[1:50:10] association with the Unseen
[1:50:13] [Applause]
[1:50:15] War oh somebody shout hallelujah oh
[1:50:18] somebody shout hallelujah Hallelujah be
[1:50:22] seated the new birath so the new birath
[1:50:25] came to you at the time of your
[1:50:30] choice but if you don't move on to the
[1:50:34] baptism the angel becomes
[1:50:40] inactive that's where many Christians
[1:50:45] are and if the Christian is not in touch
[1:50:48] with that angel just cut off they can't
[1:50:52] hear the angel like bam it's cut
[1:50:55] off the donkey has to help him Master
[1:51:00] can you see a whole Prophet needs to
[1:51:04] donkey to tell him there's an angel
[1:51:06] standing
[1:51:08] there can somebody shout
[1:51:10] hallelujah may God Resto back the link
[1:51:14] may God bring back the Holy Ghost and
[1:51:17] connect you back to your angel
[1:51:20] you believe you have an angel do you
[1:51:22] believe that do you believe that in your
[1:51:24] heart then shout hallelujah hallelujah
[1:51:28] let me see
[1:51:29] it that's why the baptism is so
[1:51:35] important it doesn't really save
[1:51:40] you Romans 8:11 says you of the same
[1:51:43] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:51:44] dwell in you it
[1:51:47] quickens it quickens that begins at the
[1:51:50] baptism a holy ghost man can feel Holy
[1:51:53] Ghost with his body he understands the
[1:51:56] Holy Ghost signal the Holy Ghost moves
[1:51:59] on him he knows when to move when to go
[1:52:02] back when to speak he feels the signal
[1:52:05] of the holy spirit because his body is
[1:52:07] tuned to that angel oh somebody shout
[1:52:10] hallelujah oh somebody shout hallelujah
[1:52:13] glory of God
[1:52:15] Amen this is to Crave your
[1:52:17] thirst for the Holy Ghost be
[1:52:22] seated
[1:52:25] hallu oh somebody say Amen so the Holy
[1:52:28] Ghost has led you this
[1:52:31] far and that angel had a
[1:52:34] purpose he want to bring you to the
[1:52:38] word that angel that's your spiritual
[1:52:41] body that's your that's your real
[1:52:46] seed because the baptism is only a
[1:52:49] temporal keft
[1:52:50] when that angel steps and fails
[1:52:53] you you don't need a baptism no more you
[1:52:57] now become the
[1:53:00] person the angel lives inside your body
[1:53:04] he controls your senses you become an
[1:53:07] the image of God on the
[1:53:09] [Applause]
[1:53:11] earth
[1:53:12] hallelujah
[1:53:14] hallelujah let be
[1:53:16] seated let be seated how understand this
[1:53:18] so far how many of you understand
[1:53:20] how many of you understand so far I
[1:53:22] think I took my time to explain this
[1:53:26] beated hallelujah praise God so the
[1:53:29] element of the baptism is so
[1:53:31] important so as I said Adam's F was
[1:53:34] always in Eden he the animals but until
[1:53:38] a breath of life came he can be a living
[1:53:41] Soul he was not alive to that
[1:53:46] presence like many of you we are not
[1:53:48] alive
[1:53:52] because our senses are
[1:53:54] dead but we are still sons of
[1:53:58] gods you come to these meetings you so
[1:54:00] dead you're so cold no anointing but the
[1:54:04] Holy Ghost is really
[1:54:07] here yeah the Holy Ghost is here man the
[1:54:10] angel is here now Manu you believe that
[1:54:13] say Amen that is here I didn't come with
[1:54:16] the angel once we are here the angel
[1:54:19] comes down
[1:54:20] because whereever two or three are
[1:54:23] gathered in My Name Lord am I in the
[1:54:25] midst of
[1:54:28] them may see that but this connection
[1:54:32] has to be
[1:54:33] made amen it has to be made
[1:54:37] church until that is made you're going
[1:54:40] to strug with your Christian
[1:54:43] life because this body needs a
[1:54:46] quickening an Awakening hallelujah
[1:54:49] hallelujah praise God I just feel the
[1:54:51] blood come of me right now I just feel
[1:54:53] the Holy Ghost drop down right now
[1:54:55] hallelujah praise God Amen the
[1:54:57] connection has to be made me and I'm
[1:54:59] trusting God today that somebody in
[1:55:01] these meetings will be connected to that
[1:55:05] angel where the angel can speak back to
[1:55:07] you you can speak back to the angel May
[1:55:10] me seated hallelujah praise God let me
[1:55:13] SE

[1:59:17] the good land
[1:59:20] in Ephesians you can ask what you will
[1:59:23] that's how good the line
[1:59:25] is in Ephesians you spoken word don't
[1:59:28] come back void when you speak it so be
[1:59:31] it when Joshua cross over he said Son

[1:59:38] AOK one land
[1:59:41] Hallelujah you get D in Ephesians in
[1:59:44] Ephesians you are an
[1:59:48] overcomer
[1:59:51] let me
[1:59:54] seated but the said your theop your
[1:59:57] glorified body is so close to you that's
[2:00:00] how close Ephesians is to
[2:00:03] you that body is not in this
[2:00:07] time you can't see it here it is over in
[2:00:11] another lande and it's a Jordan it's a
[2:00:14] small River Jordan stand between you and
[2:00:17] Ephesus hallah
[2:00:23] if you can just cross over
[2:00:25] Jordan Lord have mercy your Jordan is
[2:00:28] your
[2:00:30] death every man here today has a death
[2:00:33] to
[2:00:35] die every Minister has a death to die
[2:00:39] every young person has a death to die to
[2:00:43] cross over
[2:00:48] Jordan
[2:00:50] may be
[2:00:51] [Applause]
[2:00:52] seated be
[2:00:55] seated so Peter says by these exceeding
[2:00:58] great and precious promises we become
[2:01:04] partakers of his divine nature and we
[2:01:07] escape the corruption because in US is a
[2:01:10] corrupt nature a lustful nature lost for
[2:01:14] the things of the world that nature must
[2:01:16] be changed by a divine nature
[2:01:19] then you are free from corruption then
[2:01:23] your mind is set on things above your
[2:01:25] mind is set on things of the Eternal no
[2:01:29] more time to
[2:01:30] [Applause]
[2:01:37] Lost lust is a root of
[2:01:42] sin James says that how we all
[2:01:45] sin because we are carried
[2:01:47] away by our own lost and we enticed
[2:01:50] that's how sin
[2:01:52] comes lust is a craving desire never get
[2:01:56] satisfied it's a
[2:02:01] nature so sometimes you can cut the
[2:02:04] branches of sin but the
[2:02:07] root so prah said a man who be
[2:02:09] Sanctified the Holy Ghost he was once a
[2:02:13] drunker the lost the atmosphere once it
[2:02:16] smells alcohol the
[2:02:20] desire you see how long do you manage
[2:02:24] that once is there because the enemy
[2:02:27] tempt you on the
[2:02:30] desire he knows it's in your
[2:02:34] heart you want to have sex with that
[2:02:36] lady he knows that already so he sees a
[2:02:38] lost he sees a desire and he tempt you
[2:02:41] on that desire so until that is changed
[2:02:45] by a divine nature you keep
[2:02:47] struggling
[2:02:50] oh somebody shout hallelujah but that is
[2:02:53] going to change this morning church God
[2:02:55] can change
[2:02:59] that let me SE
[2:03:03] it so we try sometime to cut the
[2:03:06] branches stop smoking stop adultery but
[2:03:09] the lost the desire for those
[2:03:13] things that's the
[2:03:15] challenge we don't go down to the root
[2:03:21] and the maners to live his life managing
[2:03:25] lost is more lost conscious so when he
[2:03:28] comes to church he makes sure they look
[2:03:30] at women because he
[2:03:38] suffering
[2:03:40] yeah
[2:03:42] [Applause]
[2:03:47] yeah if the devil knows you you have no
[2:03:49] lost Jesus said the devil
[2:03:51] cometh of course he cometh but he has no
[2:03:54] place in me
[2:03:56] that's so Satan's coming is not the
[2:03:59] matterall but if he comes he has no
[2:04:01] place he has no deposit in
[2:04:04] me but if he has a deposit in you he
[2:04:07] come back for his
[2:04:11] account it comes and write a check
[2:04:14] because he knows in your heart he has a
[2:04:15] deposit there but today Christ will
[2:04:18] change your account and give you a
[2:04:19] Heavenly account and put new deposit
[2:04:21] there Holy Ghost deposit word deposit
[2:04:25] promises deposit sh hallelujah
[2:04:28] hallelujah let me see
[2:04:31] it so Bram said desire
[2:04:36] nothing because desire itself is
[2:04:39] painful especially when it's not on holy
[2:04:47] things let we see that
[2:04:49] say the
[2:04:51] root the
[2:04:53] snake if he Sanctified you cut off the
[2:04:55] branches but the
[2:04:57] root the thing that makes him do it is
[2:05:00] still
[2:05:03] there and what can take it out I'm
[2:05:07] clarified it's a fire
[2:05:09] baptism so what the snake understands
[2:05:12] when he sees fire he comes outside but
[2:05:16] until he sees fire he cannot leave you
[2:05:19] but today he will see fire somebody say
[2:05:23] fire fire Holy Ghost fire fire let
[2:05:28] seated when the Snak ises
[2:05:30] [Applause]
[2:05:33] fire may see it that's why you cannot be
[2:05:37] converted until the Holy Ghost
[2:05:43] comes that snake will never respond to
[2:05:47] word word word word word he wakes up and
[2:05:49] listen to you and sleeps
[2:05:50] again let him try
[2:05:53] more then you are suffer the things you
[2:05:56] hate and the things you
[2:05:59] do the things you don't like are the
[2:06:01] things you do that means you are a
[2:06:04] prisoner you are not in your freedom God
[2:06:08] did not design you like
[2:06:11] that he made a provision for you he
[2:06:14] sends fire Holy Ghost Fire Holy Holy
[2:06:16] Ghost Fire when that comes
[2:06:19] it setes the
[2:06:22] [Applause]
[2:06:26] issue
[2:06:28] see so young people that's a
[2:06:31] [Music]
[2:06:33] secret so so what choice do you make
[2:06:36] rather than having to manage lost
[2:06:39] Hallelujah managing lost doesn't make it
[2:06:46] overcome you can reform the human Spirit
[2:06:49] but you can't transform
[2:06:52] it the human Spirit has good as evil but
[2:06:57] Paul says even in the good there's evil
[2:06:59] there that's why you can't be satisfied
[2:07:02] with good
[2:07:04] self because in your best good self
[2:07:07] there's evil there as well you need a
[2:07:10] transformation God must change your
[2:07:12] spirit and give you another Spirit
[2:07:16] outside your human spirit so I will give
[2:07:19] you a new heart a new spirit than my
[2:07:23] spirit if you feel that way then shout
[2:07:25] hallelujah this
[2:07:26] [Applause]
[2:07:30] morning I'm fed up with my human
[2:07:34] spirit that tells me don't talk to this

[2:07:41] [Music]
[2:07:43] Spirit I'm fed
[2:07:46] up they rece it
[2:07:49] and most of us our human Spirits have
[2:07:51] been so
[2:07:53] reformed until we miss the Holy Ghost
[2:07:55] for the human
[2:07:57] Spirit we are so
[2:08:00] nice we appear so
[2:08:04] good we can talk so nice about people
[2:08:07] behind their
[2:08:11] back is
[2:08:14] human
[2:08:16] hallu come here this brother what what a
[2:08:19] message at your back he doesn't preach
[2:08:22] much he he has Revelation he just said
[2:08:25] what a
[2:08:27] message it Go
[2:08:29] toon that mess has no
[2:08:34] mystery is too shallow he's not deep but
[2:08:37] he just said what a
[2:08:39] message ministers we all know that
[2:08:41] that's politic get out of that stuff

[2:08:51] your hearts
[2:08:53] Hallelujah may be seated I'm tired of

[2:09:05] heart if I say I love you is in my heart
[2:09:09] I'm not hypocritical shout hallelujah
[2:09:12] that's
[2:09:13] maturity not all this fine fine talk
[2:09:16] politic talk that politician
[2:09:20] they say things you want to hear they
[2:09:22] want your vote once they get your vote
[2:09:25] they dispense
[2:09:29] you oh I'm preaching this morning bro
[2:09:32] can I go on Sir be seated where is that
[2:09:36] mat
[2:09:38] seed be
[2:09:44] seated we've got to
[2:09:46] die listen
[2:09:50] it was easier for
[2:09:51] Samson to fight other people's
[2:09:56] fight he was good at
[2:09:59] that but he failed in fighting his own
[2:10:03] fight most preachers are good at
[2:10:05] fighting other people's fight they come
[2:10:06] to church I C your devil but they are
[2:10:10] fornicators so to fight your own fight
[2:10:12] is the
[2:10:15] challenge I told God last week I said
[2:10:17] God let me don't be like
[2:10:20] Samson cast out Devils from other people
[2:10:23] I have my own Devils to fight as well I
[2:10:27] have my own temperament I have my own
[2:10:29] situation to
[2:10:31] [Applause]
[2:10:33] fight Hallelujah because the battle Sami
[2:10:36] lost was his own battle and that was
[2:10:40] dangerous for
[2:10:42] him is a human spirit is human
[2:10:47] desires that was what you call on fight
[2:10:50] many of us that's the what we
[2:10:53] lose it most times easier to see how the
[2:10:56] brother went wrong I'm going to
[2:10:58] straighten him out what is hard to see
[2:11:01] is how we are
[2:11:05] wrong so most times we are so
[2:11:08] occupied fighting other people's
[2:11:11] fight and we leave our own
[2:11:17] fight
[2:11:19] so this season I'm taking on my own
[2:11:23] fight I have fought for you for too long
[2:11:26] I have my own fight as well to do my
[2:11:30] temperament my
[2:11:34] mood just wake up in the morning you
[2:11:36] don't feel like talking to people what
[2:11:39] is wrong well I am
[2:11:45] [Applause]
[2:11:47] Moody
[2:11:49] just come to church I don't feel like
[2:11:50] greeting anybody today I want to be by
[2:11:58] myself that's an evil spirit man you got
[2:12:02] to cast it out this morning man shout
[2:12:07] hallelujah SE where is that why
[2:12:15] seed if you think that minister help go
[2:12:18] help him most times even we ministers
[2:12:21] want to help other the ministers I will
[2:12:24] straighten him
[2:12:25] out but what's your
[2:12:27] Authority you're not even adopted
[2:12:30] yet straighten who who is straighten who
[2:12:34] no fire no
[2:12:38] power it's like Moses want to go and
[2:12:40] straighten somebody else out and the Jew
[2:12:42] man say who are you you think you you
[2:12:45] you'll kill me like you kill Egyptian
[2:12:47] get out of here man
[2:12:49] the man has no
[2:12:51] [Applause]
[2:12:53] mandate can somebody shout
[2:12:56] hallelujah that was a very good Jew man
[2:12:59] did you know who the hell were you where
[2:13:01] you coming from you think we don't know
[2:13:03] your weaknesses you're a killer get off
[2:13:05] here and Moses
[2:13:08] [Applause]
[2:13:12] run that young man made Moses run he
[2:13:15] made himself an exile be there
[2:13:19] you see that you see
[2:13:25] [Applause]
[2:13:30] that baby seated where is that wiping
[2:13:35] seed that's your
[2:13:39] death it smell like Solomon they were
[2:13:41] wise in other
[2:13:43] things but the wisdom on their own
[2:13:46] situation look at most wisdom how could
[2:13:50] he have allowed himself to be fooled by
[2:13:55] women see because lust vers his
[2:13:57] challenge it's because the devil is
[2:13:59] Tweaky it makes you feel that who you
[2:14:04] are and what we try to do is to
[2:14:07] disconnect you you are not that there's
[2:14:10] a higher self in you to put a fight in
[2:14:15] you may be seated
[2:14:18] so most times you begin to compromise
[2:14:21] with the human
[2:14:22] Spirit you begin to sympathize with your
[2:14:25] Humanity with your
[2:14:26] weaknesses well I am weak I'm human to
[2:14:30] he is
[2:14:32] human to forgive his Divine so only God
[2:14:35] can forgive God understand I'm human and
[2:14:39] we find C we are
[2:14:43] negotiating and we broke a deal with our
[2:14:46] human Spirit then we are B found but I
[2:14:49] am not going to broke any deal the human
[2:14:52] Spirit has no Dey in it it has no
[2:14:56] Divinity it's a fallen angel Spirit what
[2:15:00] we need is a higher spirit it's called
[2:15:03] the Holy Ghost somebody say the Holy
[2:15:05] Ghost
[2:15:08] G that's the only spirit that can put on
[2:15:11] the control the human Spirit your brain
[2:15:15] your in can't do it at all
[2:15:22] the human spirit will only recognizes
[2:15:25] the Holy
[2:15:27] Spirit it can only accept
[2:15:30] submission to the Holy
[2:15:35] Spirit where is that riping se struck
[2:15:39] yesterday where we at
[2:15:43] now I am not a
[2:15:46] bishop
[2:15:48] when God adopts me I am a son in the
[2:15:51] making I know that Hallelujah my
[2:15:55] adoption is under making
[2:15:57] me
[2:15:59] Hallelujah that's right that's how I
[2:16:02] feel about
[2:16:05] myself and that helps me manage my
[2:16:08] behavior because that's my
[2:16:12] expectation I didn't leave my University
[2:16:15] graduate to come and preach to be a
[2:16:16] church Elder by first option because God
[2:16:19] leave room for that I would be the
[2:16:22] fful I would have set my people
[2:16:25] free it's God's choice to make me
[2:16:27] otherwise but God gave me a choice
[2:16:30] that's my first
[2:16:31] choice there are folks in my church they
[2:16:35] want to do NS I said look why can't you
[2:16:37] choose to be a
[2:16:39] doctor the medical field that's the
[2:16:41] highest
[2:16:42] one get the mindset for to for the best
[2:16:45] in life live the rest with God
[2:16:48] because we can propose God disposes but
[2:16:50] we have a choice if God give you a
[2:16:53] choice it's a
[2:16:57] choice so if I have to make a choice
[2:16:59] between an ELD and a f Minister I will
[2:17:01] choose the F Minister I will set you
[2:17:03] down for an
[2:17:08] elder if I have a choice to be rich and
[2:17:10] to be poor I would choose to be
[2:17:16] rich if I have a choice to be open the
[2:17:19] book of life he said there are two
[2:17:20] section it's your choice he said one
[2:17:23] section has regular life you can be good
[2:17:26] nice be a good person go to
[2:17:28] heaven it's a
[2:17:30] section but it says that is another
[2:17:33] section said listen said the same book
[2:17:36] it's not two books same book one your
[2:17:39] name never comes out over here you can
[2:17:41] be good but if you don't repent it comes
[2:17:45] out now why do you choose to believe
[2:17:47] your name is in the etal
[2:17:50] section how about you even Choice
[2:17:53] there
[2:17:55] good but God gave a choice between the
[2:17:58] two sections so I choose to be in the
[2:18:00] lamb section in that section my name
[2:18:03] never comes
[2:18:07] out but you can choose to be a regular
[2:18:10] church member pay your good tide don't
[2:18:13] lie don't fornicate and go to heaven
[2:18:16] still
[2:18:20] don't need no Holy Ghost no power let me
[2:18:22] just pay my ti be humble come to church
[2:18:29] you but your life has no
[2:18:32] deity no power just a form of
[2:18:38] godliness but I choose
[2:18:40] [Music]
[2:18:42] otherwise I choose the life of the Lamb
[2:18:45] I want to be like Jesus that's a choice
[2:18:48] I make is a conscious
[2:18:50] [Applause]
[2:18:52] choice you can't force it on me it's a
[2:18:55] conscious Choice the prophet opened the
[2:18:59] books and it made me see how the books
[2:19:02] stand but he gave me my choice well I
[2:19:06] made a choice I want to be like Jesus I
[2:19:10] want to have dity in my flesh I want to
[2:19:12] be God Veil I want to be a child of God
[2:19:15] that's a choice I make and that is what
[2:19:17] I'm living
[2:19:18] [Applause]
[2:19:23] for they be do this but I'm say this age
[2:19:26] is the age of choice it's a choosing
[2:19:30] day we are brought to a
[2:19:39] junction Ruth made a
[2:19:41] choice she could have gone
[2:19:44] back because Naomi gave all the reasons
[2:19:47] why they should go back said you you
[2:19:49] can't make
[2:19:50] it if I should even have a child now how
[2:19:53] long how long will you
[2:19:54] wait he gave all the reasons why they
[2:19:57] should go back but in the face of all
[2:19:59] those reasons the reasons all sounded
[2:20:02] logical they sound the true but Ruth
[2:20:05] said I'm not going what you're talking
[2:20:08] is reasoning this is intellectual I'm
[2:20:10] going with you your grave is my grave
[2:20:13] where you die I will die there was a
[2:20:16] hard choice to
[2:20:21] let
[2:20:23] seated an oper went with reasoning what
[2:20:27] sounded logical well what now said makes
[2:20:31] sense so I think it makes sense to go
[2:20:33] back that's
[2:20:34] reasoning there was no faith on the
[2:20:36] inside but rotth saw the reasoning he
[2:20:39] said you talking intellect you talking
[2:20:42] your pring I'm going down to
[2:20:46] Israel
[2:20:48] they be seated it's a choice you
[2:20:53] make be seated but but but Peter gave a
[2:20:57] quote Royal Seed of Abraham Jesus
[2:21:01] Christ I brought it down that you the
[2:21:03] Royal SE it's a choice if you sympathize
[2:21:06] with your human spirit that is no that's
[2:21:09] not that's that's not it doesn't mean
[2:21:12] that you can't be the Royal seity you
[2:21:15] are
[2:21:16] human
[2:21:19] make a
[2:21:24] choice Bram had opened the SE for all of
[2:21:27] us my
[2:21:29] brother he told me that I'm the physical
[2:21:33] manifestation of the AR that was in God
[2:21:37] is a choice to believe it ra said I'm
[2:21:40] the literal spoken seed word of God that
[2:21:43] what he
[2:21:44] said he lives room for you to believe
[2:21:49] that he said those who are possessed of
[2:21:52] the spirit they are a part of those
[2:21:53] Angelic
[2:21:55] beings that resisted the devil's lie so
[2:21:58] the Holy Ghost is in you you are a part
[2:22:02] it's a choice to believe it but he left
[2:22:05] room for you to believe
[2:22:08] it
[2:22:10] see the rooms are
[2:22:13] there a man's gift make it room yes the
[2:22:17] greatest gift is the
[2:22:19] word the word you believe makes room for
[2:22:23] you I believe in signs wonders it's not
[2:22:27] Pentecost I believe in gting our Devils
[2:22:30] that's the that's my belief I chose to
[2:22:33] believe that
[2:22:35] hallelujah
[2:22:37] hallelujah I choose to be a demon Demon
[2:22:39] Hunter cast The Devils out I choose to
[2:22:42] believe
[2:22:43] [Applause]
[2:22:46] that is a choice you must
[2:22:50] make we are all product of the choices
[2:22:52] we
[2:22:54] make all things are possible to them
[2:22:57] that
[2:23:00] believe but the brandham opened Seven
[2:23:03] Seals each seal has its own content the
[2:23:06] choice is yours hallelu I choose the
[2:23:10] seventh
[2:23:13] [Applause]
[2:23:16] one
[2:23:18] the other six seals are fine there's
[2:23:21] Redemption going on
[2:23:22] there even the six seals hold the
[2:23:24] Redemption of the
[2:23:26] Earth but I choose the seventh
[2:23:32] one and that's what I preach I make all
[2:23:36] my claims on that sale it's a choice
[2:23:38] others choose to preach the
[2:23:40] sixu and say servant is
[2:23:42] closed in the
[2:23:44] message can you imagine that
[2:23:47] they deliberately close the seven
[2:23:51] one when the prophet said it is open
[2:23:54] they said it is
[2:23:57] Clos and you think I must follow them to
[2:24:00] a close seal no to me it is
[2:24:03] opened and I see Christ in that seal I
[2:24:06] see my name in that seal my inheritance
[2:24:09] my possession that's what I see in that
[2:24:12] seal
[2:24:14] hallelujah it's a choice you make Ace
[2:24:17] I'm not finished you be seated be seated
[2:24:20] I've enjoyed myself on the word be
[2:24:22] seated may be seated now the Holy Ghost
[2:24:25] can come be
[2:24:28] seated so you can make your choice
[2:24:34] today I choose to be the word
[2:24:39] image says when this human element all
[2:24:42] goes out when we are all Lo out we are
[2:24:46] formed into his very
[2:24:50] image I choose to become
[2:24:55] that because the only image that goes in
[2:24:59] the
[2:25:00] Rapture is the word
[2:25:02] image this human spirit is hybrid is a
[2:25:05] mixed Spirit you can get the
[2:25:08] Rapture so God put a death on
[2:25:11] it it has to
[2:25:15] die
[2:25:17] make up your mind to kill that Spirit
[2:25:22] today because it's your a if you doesn't
[2:25:25] die it will kill
[2:25:27] you the human Spirit enough of that in
[2:25:31] the
[2:25:35] message we all need the Holy
[2:25:40] Ghost thank you Jesus and when God give
[2:25:43] you the Holy Ghost your battle
[2:25:45] begins between the Holy Ghost your new
[2:25:48] spirit another spirit and your human
[2:25:53] Spirit as you obey the Holy
[2:25:56] Spirit you make the human Spirit
[2:26:00] inactive then you are led by the
[2:26:06] spirit the Holy Ghost flushes out all
[2:26:08] the evil people do me they wrong people
[2:26:10] hurt me they hurt the human Spirit they
[2:26:13] don't hurt the holy spirit so if I feel
[2:26:16] Hur my human Spirit the Holy Spirit
[2:26:18] comes and flush the all
[2:26:20] out because the Holy Ghost act as a
[2:26:25] bumper so I don't really feel H heart
[2:26:28] can only stay in me for for a while for
[2:26:29] minutes it goes off
[2:26:33] again try don't understand how
[2:26:35] Christians can keep CES for weeks for
[2:26:37] months for
[2:26:41] years and they claim to have the Holy
[2:26:45] Ghost
[2:26:47] it is human to keep
[2:26:50] grudges but it is divine to let them go
[2:26:54] but the Holy Ghost must help
[2:26:55] [Applause]
[2:26:58] you
[2:27:00] hallelujah it's now time we connect the
[2:27:02] seven Revelation to the life the virtues
[2:27:06] we've got to connect it before child
[2:27:08] comes on it it canot just be
[2:27:12] talk talk talk talk I have a revelation
[2:27:15] you must connect that to the
[2:27:18] VES or else no charity comes on it you
[2:27:22] must live out the Vue of your age so if
[2:27:25] you have a revelation begin to connect
[2:27:27] it to the virtue of your age because the
[2:27:30] seven Thunders are connected to the
[2:27:32] virtues Hallelujah and once you see the
[2:27:36] season when the people begin to connect
[2:27:38] their faith with the life then charit is
[2:27:45] closed Revelation Revelation no life
[2:27:49] still back
[2:27:51] bite try to destroy this min's influence
[2:27:54] with the

[2:28:13] fight that's that my fight that's my
[2:28:17] training a brother says I have sex Pi on
[2:28:20] me it hurts me but that's my training I
[2:28:23] don't want to draw to that one because
[2:28:25] you have your own fight
[2:28:28] too because it's obvious if I tell you
[2:28:31] you would not have gone to that
[2:28:32] church because you you want to fight for

[2:28:51] create the offenses and the troubles
[2:28:53] they they don't do the fighting they are
[2:28:55] so
[2:28:57] lazy the pastor fight over to the people

[2:29:58] that
[2:30:03] war how do you win a war against your
[2:30:06] enemy on the same ground same instrument
[2:30:10] same weapons same tactic how do you win
[2:30:12] that
[2:30:15] war you must must have a different
[2:30:17] strategy different weapons so you can't
[2:30:20] overcome evil with evil because it's the
[2:30:24] same strategy is the same weapon de for
[2:30:28] TS it says overcome evil with

[2:36:14] nothing you are you you kill your
[2:36:17] ministry
[2:36:18] me many pastors have killed their
[2:36:21] Ministry the Holy Ghost has abandoned
[2:36:26] them because what they do now they don't
[2:36:29] read messages they go and SE them to
[2:36:31] hear what saying so they prepar the to
[2:36:35] react they they are
[2:36:42] warriors they become Warriors No mandate

[2:36:53] it they be seated I'm finished let be
[2:36:58] seated listen this can be a
[2:37:01] group that can change
[2:37:05] that these your friends in other
[2:37:07] churches love
[2:37:10] them I told myself I tell the folks back
[2:37:13] home I've I've tried all to live a life
[2:37:17] before you to bring you to a spot where
[2:37:21] if I am wrong but the James should be
[2:37:23] strong enough by now to say Pastor
[2:37:27] stop because you see we could have done
[2:37:30] that with the cold man we are all
[2:37:33] trained well enough to have told
[2:37:36] him brother go this
[2:37:39] way hallu I'm sure we are all trained
[2:37:42] well
[2:37:44] enough Hallelujah but we didn't do
[2:37:47] that and the same SP goes on a pastor
[2:37:50] was L here for 20 years is
[2:37:54] human but he's been used by God to lead
[2:37:56] you but you come to a spot where you can
[2:37:59] also help
[2:38:04] him she said pastor I'm sorry pastor but
[2:38:08] I think P pastor Pastor I think I think
[2:38:10] I think you're going to extreme why
[2:38:12] can't you pray about
[2:38:14] it please please Pastor I think you need
[2:38:17] to pray you know we love you I think the
[2:38:20] way you going is too
[2:38:24] extreme but we don't do that anything
[2:38:27] pastor
[2:38:29] says Pastor say Sho
[2:38:33] Sho then what has the training become
[2:38:37] how much has he influenced you he
[2:38:44] human
[2:38:48] there are mistakes I make I say say I
[2:38:50] told her don't support me like a blind
[2:38:54] wife have enough
[2:38:57] courage to tell me if I'm wrong because
[2:38:59] you can do that these members they just
[2:39:01] follow
[2:39:02] follow and when I fall they the ones who
[2:39:05] say Pastor has fallen
[2:39:09] no but if I fall you
[2:39:12] fall so don't make me fall stand in the
[2:39:15] Gap and said pastor you can't go this
[2:39:18] way I will not let you go this way that
[2:39:21] makes you a virtuous
[2:39:24] wife may be
[2:39:27] seated I said the day you miss to do
[2:39:29] that I will lose confidence in you

[2:39:41] public when lied his wife said Daddy you
[2:39:45] can't do this look at the
[2:39:47] kids what influence you will leave for
[2:39:49] Joseph then if they hear you tell a lie
[2:39:51] you are in the house you not in the
[2:39:54] house his wife challenge him on
[2:39:57] there I believe all that help the
[2:39:59] prophet to make it right
[2:40:02] hallelujah hallelujah can somebody shch
[2:40:05] hallelujah hallelujah where is that
[2:40:08] wiping

[2:40:15] husbands the husband I think you are
[2:40:17] going wrong I think we are going too far
[2:40:20] I think this issue is going
[2:40:22] overboard I mean in I mean in in your in
[2:40:24] your close
[2:40:30] moments because let me tell you
[2:40:32] something I told se you know me we have
[2:40:36] been for six years so you must always
[2:40:38] tell when I am not
[2:40:40] myself there are times when I go off
[2:40:44] gear
[2:40:46] but if I go off gear don't mind me it's
[2:40:48] not me because the pastor you married to
[2:40:51] you know that's not the
[2:40:52] pastor put me back
[2:40:55] [Applause]
[2:40:58] together everybody here has standard
[2:41:01] chance to go off gear but God gave us

[2:41:07] deacons he gave us Elders to bring us
[2:41:10] back into gar somebody shout hallelujah
[2:41:13] where is that wiping seed

[2:41:22] but most of our deons they so
[2:41:25] immature if the P I'm going to kill and
[2:41:27] so we are behind
[2:41:32] you the prophet said one word off you're
[2:41:35] my enemy draw your sword draw your
[2:41:42] sword cut him off cut him off
[2:41:46] so when they come to church they want to
[2:41:47] watch if their Pastor is talking to you
[2:41:49] if their doesn't greet they won't even
[2:41:50] greet
[2:41:52] you and if anybody does are you so
[2:41:56] insensitive don't you see the cont today
[2:42:02] why

[2:42:09] demonic this group today T is B we can
[2:42:14] change we can change that Hallelujah we
[2:42:19] can change that let's go back and change
[2:42:22] our
[2:42:26] churches
[2:42:28] listen we all have evil things you can
[2:42:31] talk about but the prophet said you must
[2:42:34] learn at least to see the nice ones
[2:42:36] because it is better off it's
[2:42:43] edifice it's a choice we must make
[2:42:50] I pray that this
[2:42:55] group
[2:42:57] countries you go there this pastor is
[2:43:00] that Pastor is that Pastor and when they
[2:43:02] meet it is so at times I'm shocked when
[2:43:05] they come back together bro hey how are
[2:43:07] you bro I'm bro your message I just
[2:43:11] heard what it said few minutes ago so
[2:43:13] I'm saying Jesus Christ
[2:43:17] I just had what he said few minute about
[2:43:20] brother brother is shallow he doesn't
[2:43:23] much just preach then when he sees him
[2:43:26] bro your tip was a
[2:43:28] blessing I watched them I say Jesus
[2:43:31] Christ is this bright is this bread
[2:43:34] Christ is coming
[2:43:39] for we can change that let's come to mat
[2:43:44] please
[2:43:47] I came today not to preach shouting
[2:43:50] message this is the last message let's
[2:43:52] change
[2:43:53] that hallu because it kills our
[2:43:57] ministry it kills our churches it kills
[2:44:00] our
[2:44:01] people and the unlanded ones the
[2:44:04] immature ones who are trying to follow
[2:44:07] somebody it just kills
[2:44:14] the praise God but God is looking for a
[2:44:18] group maybe this can be the group today
[2:44:21] under 30 or four that can find brotherly
[2:44:25] kindness that can say with their mouth
[2:44:28] what's in their hearts amen let me tell
[2:44:30] you my principle if I tell you something
[2:44:33] it hurt
[2:44:35] you no matter how right it is if you say
[2:44:37] you feel hurt I say I'm
[2:44:39] sorry I tell my folks because I don't
[2:44:41] intend doing it to actually hurt you
[2:44:44] originally
[2:44:45] maybe I didn't say it well you know I'm
[2:44:48] not a gramar
[2:44:50] student maybe sometimes I just miss say
[2:44:52] the words but if you express your Hur
[2:44:55] I'm always willing because you know why
[2:44:58] to show you my original intention was
[2:44:59] not to hurt
[2:45:02] you but I won't say no I'm
[2:45:09] right and sometimes people think you are
[2:45:12] weak you are too sorry sorry
[2:45:16] everything sorry everything sorry it's
[2:45:18] not sorry sorry it's a
[2:45:22] life you are not my
[2:45:26] enemy you don't even have to be my enemy
[2:45:29] but but but young man said if your enemy
[2:45:32] is
[2:45:33] plural you have a
[2:45:36] problem because our enemy
[2:45:38] singular the
[2:45:44] devil
[2:45:45] [Applause]
[2:45:49] have you SE that many ministers have
[2:45:51] corrected me I I don't feel
[2:45:55] obset but I I would tell them what you
[2:45:58] just
[2:46:01] don't a man become eny for life because
[2:46:05] ministers are Beyond
[2:46:08] correction if you correct them even one
[2:46:10] to one who are
[2:46:14] you
[2:46:16] they go be their P pit on their
[2:46:18] internet that black brother has no
[2:46:23] identity do it even know who he is I
[2:46:27] said so what you've done to me keep it
[2:46:29] don't BR to nobody else
[2:46:33] again but it must not be that way is a
[2:46:36] minister I am
[2:46:38] too he has a right to say bro I
[2:46:41] think you're not doing things this way
[2:46:47] because we are one another's
[2:46:51] keeper it is iron that sharpens
[2:46:56] iron somebody say Amen Church iron
[2:46:59] sharpens
[2:47:00] [Applause]
[2:47:06] iron when I first came to Ina I was
[2:47:08] preaching those years I just preach
[2:47:10] preach preach I put my first was alive
[2:47:14] then so I preached the Holy Ghost just
[2:47:16] dropped
[2:47:17] down meaning I was stop by I just went
[2:47:20] on so the anointing died down so
[2:47:25] after you don't do like
[2:47:27] that so I up
[2:47:31] straight he was not even a pastor an
[2:47:34] assistant what he say was right when
[2:47:36] you're preaching sometimes lift the Holy
[2:47:39] Ghost to meet the people you see that
[2:47:41] that me you have just left the Holy
[2:47:43] Ghost to minister you have to finish
[2:47:46] your
[2:47:46] message I said thank you sir it's not
[2:47:49] going to be with the Lord but he left
[2:47:51] that with
[2:47:53] me but plenty ministers will not take
[2:47:55] that we ask you what what what your your
[2:47:59] adversity for me to preach and you
[2:48:01] telling me what to say who are
[2:48:08] [Applause]
[2:48:09] you somebody say Amen to that church I'm
[2:48:13] looking for a group on this I'm looking
[2:48:14] for a group
[2:48:15] amen may this be the group where God can
[2:48:18] find some mature
[2:48:21] seeds you we can say I'm sorry please I
[2:48:25] don't say if I say something you are Hur
[2:48:30] I'm sorry not if I hurt you the person
[2:48:32] is already hurt you say if I hurt
[2:48:36] you I've hurt you by saying this please
[2:48:38] forgive me I'm
[2:48:39] sorry and you must find enough Grace to
[2:48:42] say I forgive you that's how that's how
[2:48:45] Sate not go back and call your
[2:48:48] people come come
[2:48:50] around call the
[2:48:52] disciples and poison their
[2:48:56] spirit and set them up against their
[2:48:59] Pastor go to Convention
[2:49:02] bro I love you what a message hallelujah
[2:49:07] what an
[2:49:09] anointing we can get you for that
[2:49:12] today before we leave the Holy Ghost put
[2:49:15] into my heart to go this
[2:49:20] way the thinking of our church let's
[2:49:22] start making them mature let's tell them
[2:49:25] because we saw the mistake in New York
[2:49:27] let's tell them we can sometimes be
[2:49:31] wrong there are times when they need our
[2:49:33] help so we must have groomed them for
[2:49:35] years and they must know we are living
[2:49:37] the life before them they must tell when
[2:49:40] we get off guard they must know this is
[2:49:43] not the only we knew but that was the we
[2:49:46] knew you must
[2:49:48] help because you've been with him for
[2:49:51] years so you must know when it
[2:49:56] change and stand by him because suppose
[2:49:59] we have done that
[2:50:01] 2011 it might not have sounded well but
[2:50:04] maybe it could have saved a
[2:50:07] situation but
[2:50:11] fear I am part of that fear group as
[2:50:13] well of course we knew it was
[2:50:17] wrong but fear so the old man's labor of
[2:50:22] bringing up a crop wasn't there we we
[2:50:26] all simply imature we were all
[2:50:32] unrival Hallelujah and if we don't
[2:50:34] change that it comes back to our
[2:50:40] churches pastors are preaching they are
[2:50:42] P preaching people in their ppit they
[2:50:44] are
[2:50:45] jumping when they are busy insting our
[2:50:47] pastors they're jumping
[2:50:51] preaching and people are scaming say

[3:51:15] on and uh and for us also individually
[3:51:18] we are all
[3:51:19] challenged and I believe that we're
[3:51:21] going to live here being round Stones
[3:51:23] that's smooth you know stay in the
[3:51:25] stones in the river they rub against
[3:51:26] each other when the water flows and they
[3:51:28] make each other smooth so that water
[3:51:31] that was flowing the stones are rubbing
[3:51:33] against each other so we're going to be
[3:51:35] smooth and all the drop the odds are
[3:51:37] being dropped and love divine is taking
[3:51:39] control God bless
