father We Are So Unworthy to stand in your presence today Father you said we were born in sin and shaped in iniquity but Lord is's a blood sacrifice that was paid for us so that when you look through this Blood father you see different from what the world sees you see different from what our experiences see and our backgrounds and the situation that we have been through I pray dear God that as We

bless Lord everything that will be said said and done in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord well it is with a great privilege great honor I stand here this evening to welcome you to our first marriage conference headstone Tabernacles first marriage conference and uh I could assure you it will not be the last I see it as the beginning of a program to really strengthen the the building block that God established in the Garden of Eden when he put Adam and Eve together as the foundation for everything that would be established I just want to read one scripture you don't have to find it it's found in the Book of Proverbs chapter 4 and it is verse 7 Proverbs 4:7 wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get on understanding and that's why we are here this evening to get understanding and it's interesting um I have good news and I'm bad news the good news is I'm not the speaker tonight that's the good news the bad news is I'll be speaking for about 10 minutes and uh I have the pleasure of introducing the speaker tonight but um the reason I'm happy that I'm not speaking is that um I haven't been married that long to really share what I could call profound or deep insight into marriage um I do not by any means consider or count myself a professional in the area of marriage but I have observed certain truths certain realities and just coming up in the car I was saying it's interesting that maturity and age are not correlated a lot of people are under the assumption that the older you get the mature you are but I that that assumption is defied every single day when I see people who are 60 70 doing stuff that 15 year olds don't want to do so I have come to the realization that we can no longer assume certain things and therein lies the foundation for why this exists today we could no longer assume that because someone is in church as a brother that they understand what it means to be a husband we could no longer assume that because some someone says they come to church for 30 years as a woman that they understand what it is to be a wife or to be a mother or to be a caregiver so we are here tonight to remove the assumptions we are here tonight to start from scratch we're here today to start from the basic building blocks of certain elements that were passed on many generations ago but as time evolved we have somehow lost these things we have somehow lost them lost l through traveling to work and lost through washing to pay the bills and rushing to do this commitment 50 years ago 100 years ago it was okay to say I'm the man of my house and my wife can stay home and do the dishes and things like that now you tell you speak about the woman's places to do the dishes you will start a revolution that you will not hear the end of CCN TV6 CNC3 will come storming up say say say that one more time just so we we can get it on Facebook the world has evolved but God has not changed and as the environment around us changed doesn't mean certain core principles are not held the same I have two more minutes before our speaker comes along but I do want to make mention of the fact that we now require a balance in life and many people inquired as to the nature of today's session and what we are trying to achieve and accomplish and who can come and I would say that I would pray that as we do more of these sessions more would come because it is not just for those who are married or those who have intention of getting married it is to empower individuals as Christians who follow the Bible First and the message of Malachi for William brandham to what we should represent as marriage what we should teach people so when somebody asks us What is marriage all about we can tell them this is what God intended for marriage to look like can somebody say Amen am so I pray that today's session would be an encouragement to you it would be an inspiration to you and it will be the seed because it is impossible to capture in one session everything that we have in our hearts to share it's impossible to capture in 15 sessions because as a friend of mine said recently there was no graduation class for marriage after you've been married for 30 years you realize you know what I just discovered something new and I'm speaking this after just about 10 months of marriage fresh out the gate and I tell you wife God bless you it is a journey that and and the reality is the Bible tells us to encourage one another to support one another and sometimes you might think that the situation you are in you are the only person on the planet going through that and then you realize when you talk to somebody you know is a similar thing is a similar thing because there are only so many permutations of human behavior that could exist but every answer to every question we could ever have is found in the Bible amen somebody say amen amen so that's enough of what I have to say that's my introduction without hesitation this evening I would like to welcome to the podium this evening the pastor of this church the Reverend theopus o Jr who has the distinct privilege of presenting tonight's word to you uh as a foundation for what marriage is for the church for this for for the group I do want to take this opportunity to wel welcome all the

where they Place their feet they want to avoid troubles and pitfalls oh God help us this evening we such a native people Inspire Us by your word inspire us and give us spiritual insight and speak to our hearts May Our Lives be changed and transformed in Jesus name I ask it before I have a seats I'd like to read a scripture the scripture you want to read is some Ephesians maybe you didn't reading your Bible but I will have to read that scripture for you and that is from ephes Ephesians chapter 5 we want to read from verse 21 I want to welcome everyone of you here today in the name of Jesus we excited and happy for you to be here today and we welcome you you're all here because there are things that you would like to know ways you'd want to improve in your relationship life and marriage man is a living changing being and we are constantly changing some days wiser some day foolish but we are changing all the same you're here to be edified enriched and to enhance and improve your relationship we would speak to you by experience inspiration and knowledge praise the Lord so you want to go to Ephesians amen somebody saying yes all right from verse 21 we read submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wies submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he's the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so that the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and give himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot a ring inle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men ought so ought men to love their wives as their own buddies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that you reference a husband may God bless his word you may be seated okay so the ties are off and all the seriousness going to go off I want you to get relaxed this evening this is something burning on my heart and uh as we say we speak to you by inspiration by experience and by knowledge question on a scale of 1 to 10 people start to laugh where one is the lowest and 10 is the highest how would you rate your relationship don't answer no answers we just want you to keep a number in your mind I'll repeat it on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is the lowest and 10 is the highest how would you rate your relationship or marriage arrive at a number in your mind you can't ask your spouse or your partner this is through your eyes you getting that number so it has to be through your eyes how is your relationship ship through your eyes and experience is it a five a four a six a nine I'm talking about you is it a four what make it a four or a five let us hear the positive of how you arrive at the Grand number of three now I don't want you to think it need three more to move to 10 I just want you to think that you say three and whoo let's talk about the Tre not talk about a short seven to make the 10 so then let's hear of how you positively arrive at two because you have to have something to make you move it to two then how can you shift from 2 to 6 or from 5 to 7 or from 8 to 10 and that's what we're here to do to shift that lever in your Mar marriage to shift that lever in your relationship now the title I have for this session is breaking the curse of a signning blame don't ask me how I got it don't ask me where I got it I just got it how God knows but this is what is upon my heart breaking the curse of assigning blame and under that of a subtopic broken homes scripture Genesis 1:27 and God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them God blessed them God said unto them be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth Genesis 311 and God said who told thee thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded that thou shouldest not eat the man said the woman whom thou givest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat the Lord God said unto woman what is this that thou has done the woman said the serpent begil me and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou are cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon thy belly shal thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enry between thee and the woman between thy SE and her seed it shall bruise thy head Thou shalt bruise his heel unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto Adam he said because thou has harkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it curse is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shall sh thou eat of it all the days of thy life I read that scripture to put a background of broken homes and ass signing blame did you come from a broken home a broken marriage a broken relationship I'm here to tell you you are not alone broken home is not new in fact the first broken home was in Genesis with Adam and Eve the marriage the union the commission to multiply and replenish was given to continue the family of God on the earth it was God's purpose or intent that marriage Union was the means by which there would be increase as you see in the scriptures because of sin blame was a sign first Adam blamed the woman now God spoke to Adam when God spoke to the Adam the woman was even wrong Eve didn't come forth yet God gave adam to work God gave adam uh uh his word and then give God get Adam a woman not the other way around he gave him word work and woman isn't that right and when sin came in when God say Adam you are responsible Adam say not me is she and Adam begin to pass the blame and the woman said not me is we wouldn't call him is a serpent okay now watch Adam blame his wife the woman blamed the serpent question who or what are you blaming for your condition or your predicament judgment was pronounced on the family the lesson from this we are individually responsible in other words I am responsible say that after me I am responsible I am respons say louder I am responsible I am responsible it is time to break the curse of excuses and assigning blame by accepting listen responsibility for your behavior action and attitudes if you are sick it is your responsibility to seek help by going to the doctor Hospital wherever and if your marriage or relationship is sick you seek all the tools all the help all to know how to get it back on track judgment struck the family because of sin and sin has consequences Genesis what we read your desire shall be for your husband and he shall rule over thee there is no place in the scripture for a bullheaded woman or a bullheaded attitude if you came from a broken home a broken family a broken relationship welcome aboard don't feel bad about yourself come and learn our parents Adam and Eve we all came from there all of us we are all from a broken home we all came from a broken family because of sin so stop assigning blame stop making excuses for how you are and look to God by his word to make you whole for broken people make broken homes just as hurting people hurt people if your marriage is intact protect it with all that is in you be aggressive in protecting it bless the Lord and pray and empathize with those whose relationship are broken and those who are on Shaky Ground you seek help and guidance that you need there is no guarantee because you are prayerful faithful true that things will work out smooth and everything would be fine that is not what we are saying we not trying to give you a pill to solve it all for example okay Proverbs are not promising they are SCS guidelines quotes that reflect on the fruit of decisions in life's journey Wikipedia describ Proverbs as a simple and concrete saying popularly created repeated that expresses a truth based on common sense or practical experience of humanity for example a proverb you can lead a horse to the water but you can't make him drink it's practical is the truth the next example Rolling Stone gathers no mors Proverbs comes as advice example Proverbs 4:5 get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom I with all I get in get understanding Proverbs 9:13 a foolish woman is clamorous she is simple and knoweth nothing that in the Amplified reads the foolish woman is is noisy she is simple open to all forms of evil she willfully and recklessly knows nothing whatever of Eternal value Proverbs 14:1 every wise woman build it a house but the foolish plucket it down with her hands Psalms 34:19 many are the Affliction of the righteous but the Lord delivered him out of them all job was doing fine his marriage was fine until things were fine until and that until becomes a point of blame things going good money coming in good everything smooth until and that until becomes a point of blame in job's case God's plan was to bring out and manif EST the faith that was resident in job a Fai Tried by fire if righteousness can be achieved by works we need the law but it is achieved by and through faith in the blood of Jesus therefore The Vow for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness on health stands no excuses really it's a covenant with the indiv viil that you walk up that a better for worse richer for poorer there is no excuse to break that vow it's a commitment and a covenant to God therefore God promised to make all things work together for good Romans 8:28 to them that love the word Lord therefore you cannot be good enough or clean enough forget about it there is none righteous no not one it is not like if somebody is more holier than you or you have to get holy like that person there is not right n righteous no not one watch therefore you cannot be bad enough that God hand is short that he cannot redeem the bottom line is do the best with what you have got with your eyes on him who holds your future God can heal Hearts how many believe that God can heal lives how many believe that yeah God can heal homes how many believe that and God can restore families and we have a testimony I'd like to share with you brother and sister uh Kristoff and um they here this today and they are Fellowship among us and this is a testimony and this is his testimony have been among us about two months about a month now officially about a month officially right now and he said my marriage was in a real damaged State my wife said she hated me there's a powerful statement there the wife and I had no chance of getting back I didn't even want it to be in the same church together there are many compiled circumstances that cause us to want to be away from each other and to lead us to us being separated and after a while I wanted my marriage to work out after hearing sermons of how we could not run from our trials I wanted another chance when I heard of a common Deliverance service I said to myself I'll get them to pray for me in it in that Deliverance service the pastor and his Minister join arms and prayed for me they told me it will work out trust in God I pledge to hold Jesus to his servant's prayer I believe it would have been done a couple of weeks later my sister and I streamed a Sunday service in which the pastor at the end of the service read a letter that teed the high calling I was immediately consumed with it I felt like the letter was all about me me I couldn't wait to search the internet to get my own copy but I could not find anything of that sort I download the Sunday service Sunday service to hear it again and I even let my sister hear it in believing Jesus healed my wife's heart towards me I would call her to check up on my son and ask her how she was doing but tasted her bitterness each time but on that particular Sunday even I did a bitter test it was bitter and I cried and said Lord I know you will do it you already you're already working on it a few hours later I called her again she said she have got something she believe I should hear she asked if I would could hear it to my surprise she read the letter teed the High Calling pretending as though it was the first time I heard it I asked her where she got it my wife said from her dad which goes to the same church I go to I Knew knew it was God for me she was different her bitterness was not dear so I believe it was my breakthrough to press forward into my answered prayer which I did and receive my now restored marriage it may still not be all it could be but it's much better than it was before thank you Jesus brother Kristoff Maller he said I hope it helps someone to trust in Jesus too and this is his wife testimony while staying in my mother's house I really believed that my marriage was over but God had a plan for me praying was the hardest thing for me why because when I pray and I really pray and hurt and pain I felt I didn't want to feel it anymore one night I kneel down to pray and ask God I said Lord I know I'm not supposed to test you but I want to test you if it is wrong I'm sorry but I would like you to let me know you are here with me and you here in my pray prayer if that is so then tomorrow let my father come and bring or say something to me and I know that you're with me knowing my father don't really come to my mother's house so this is like provoking God this is something say you know I know this doesn't happen so Lord let it happen the next day I went out when I reach home around evening time my mother said to me NOA I have something for you to read she then went inside and get it for me before she read it she said your father brought it for you to read and said his Pastor read it on Sunday for the church it was the high calling when she finished read when she finished read it I told her about about the prayer I prayed to God and asked him for I knew that his presence was with me I read it twice again and something tell me to read it to my husband so when he called I asked him if I could read something to him he said yes my husband and I were separated for months in obedience to the voice I read it to him he was quite quiet and listening I knew I was ready to accept him back into my life and stand the trials and tribulation with Jesus at my side after reading a few days past he came by my mother and we talked since then we are together till now I can really say my my God is the author and finisher or when he join you together no man can put you aund I really wish I had the High Calling to read now but I don't have it at this time now we are not trying to spiritualize marriages but you may that you may understand God can use tragedies pain and suffering to set us into our destiny example Joseph Joseph his father openly loved him favored him gave him a special C quote and I wrote here Joseph was set up to be hated open love favored love special coat all his brothers seeing what the father doing I say he was set up to be hated plus Joseph had special dreams Brothers got jealous sold him to the Egyptians it brought pain lots of pain to Joseph pain to his father pain to his family but Joseph was about to be sent out into his purpose of God for his life question what do you have to thank God for in your husband don't answer I know some of you have a whole lot what have you to thank God for in your wife somebody say I have nothing like one woman complain my husband has come late late late at least he coming home some husband don't even come home at all some husband not even there so thank you Lord he comes home okay I got it here at the high calling so I think I'll read it what motivate them to respond and so on if God has called you to be really like Jesus in all your spirit He will draw you into a life of crucifixion humility and put on you such demands of obedience that he will not allow you to follow other Christians and in many ways he will seem to let other good people do things which he will not let you do other Christians and ministers who seem very righteous and useful may push themselves pull wires work schemes to carry out their plans but you cannot do it if you attempt it you will meet with such failing and rebuke from the Lord as to make you solely penitent others can brag on themselves on their work on their success on their wenss but the holy spirit will not allow you to do such a thing if you begin it he would lead you into such deep mortification that will make you despise yourself and all your good works others will be allowed to succeed in making good SS of money or having Legacy left for them or having luxuries but God May Supply you daily because he wants you to have something far better than gold that is helpess dependence on him that he may have the privilege of providing your needs day by day out of his unseen treasury the Lord may let others be honored and put forward and keep you hid away in obscurity because he wants to produce some Choice fragrant fruit for his coming Glory which can only be produced in the shade God will let others be great keep you small he will let others do work for him and get the credit for it but he will make you work and toil on without knowing how much you are doing and then to make your work still more precious he will let others get the credit for the work which you have done and this will make your reward 10 times greater when Jesus comes the holy spirit will put a strict watching you with a jealous love will rebuke you for little words and feelings or for wasting your time which other Christians never seem distressed over some make up your mind that God is infinite Sovereign and has a right to do as he pleases with his own and he will not explain to you a thousand things which will puzzle your reason in his dealings with you God will take you at your word and if you absolutely sell yourself out to be a slave he will wrap you up in jealous love and let others say and do many things that you cannot do or say settle it forever that you are to deal directly with the holy spirit that he is to have the privilege to tying your tongue and chaining your hand closing your eyes in ways that others are not dealt with now when you are so possessed with the Living God that you are in your secret heart pleased and delighted over this peculiar personal private jealous Guardianship and management of the Holy Spirit over your life you will have found the vestibule of Heaven oh is not wonderful so as we were saying what do you have to thank God for in your husband is he a provider thank god he's a provider he's not doing as well as he ought to thank God for what he's doing well in he's a companion maybe he's not talking much we going to get him to talk just now but that's still good he's doing something is not right what is it that you don't see that you can't praise value cherish admiring him or her what is right about her him what is right about her notice I didn't say what is bad about him he look stunned by what is right about her what is right it look people strain their mind but right did I hear right am I hearing right does he really means right yes I'm talking about right what is right about him there got to be something right about him because I mean that's your husband right that's your wife right you was once excited about her right her heart make your beat skip heart beat skip one time right now it might be skipping right now might have heart pressure right now but it once upon a time it used to be your heart skip a beat once a time you open the door that's once now we tell you go around the other side used to be but there was once upon a time it was like that your whole hands walking in the pth now she walk and she walk and she walk and she walk some she in front you behind she be behind you in front but there was once upon a time there was romance once upon a time there was drama Once Upon a Time you wasn't afraid to put your hands around her once upon a time you can't tell last put your hands around her but that's going to come now because we're going to get down into it this we set in the background this going to be real Hallelujah God is real and marriage is great oh are we give a testimony [Applause] yet before you can honor praise please ensure that you're speaking the same language because this is very important if I say welcome that's French now if you understand French I catch you the words if you don't understand French they say what an earth is he talking well this happen in marriages the husband is speaking and the wife is saying what on Earth is he saying and when the husband talking what is he me so I mean I'm not getting him and he's not getting me now watch I'm not talking about talking I am talking about communicating it come like NASA have spacecraft I think one approaching Pluto right now to take pictures it was was sent about 11 or 9 years ago and they have all the systems to communicate is not they calling hello are you hearing me no no no it is communicating it's connections so communication is not words it's not talk a lot of men believe when they talk to the wife they have communicated to the my wife that's not true that's talk communication is when what you say and the meaning of what you say they get it the way you said it I'm not hearing you that's communication so the ability to get the other partner to understand clearly about what you love about life what you like what you love what you dislike what you care about the most getting to learn the language the husband speaks getting to learn the language the wife speaks then we could speak plainly we could communicate because what might be a joke to you might be a pain to to to your partner there are some people life for them is funny life for them is a bubble everything is a laugh now when they're serious they still laughing you get serious but they I am serious and the big smile in the face all the whole face smiling but they are serious laughing that's the nature there are some people they call them so bubbly when they come in a room they light up a room oo hello how you going are there some people they quiet they disappear they invisible inside the room you could pass it you don't know they were there they just shrink inside the room here's why now some say there are 16 personality types but I just pull out six personality types I want to get to you and it's important and if you want to think about it like how there 12 stars of the zodiac Pisces and Sagittarius and Capricorn now don't think I'm just just saying things now I'm getting somewhere there's a backdrop of where we want to go go this is very very important because this dealing with the relationship this dealing with different people and how they react and deal with things so this guy Holland had six personality types under realistic investigative artistic social enterprising and conventional this is ter important very important realistic likes to work with animals tools machines listen generally avoids social activities like teaching healing and informing others has good skills in working with tools mechanical electronic electrical drawings machines plants animals value practical things you can see touch like plants and animals see themselves practical mechanical realistic that's one type investigative another type likes to study solve maths and science problems generally avoids leading and selling in or persuading people so you cannot convince this person to go and sell they are not sales people everybody can't sell there are some people love to sell selling is their thing not this one this one is good in understanding science maths problems see self as precise scientific intellectuals artistic artistic like created activities like art drama craft dance music creative writing generally avoids repetitive activities they don't want to be bored has good artistic abilities in creative writing drama arts and so forth sees self as expressive original independent social social like to do things to help people they are like that they like teaching nursing giving first aid providing information generally avoid Machine Tools animals so you know what happen if a social person marry the the other one who do like tools and what you see what happening here now this one like to go out like to help like to help like to teach like to inform this one don't like to inform don't like to teach don't like to think and they walk up the eyes and B I do now it is complimentary because Opposites Attract and people don't even get it that most of the time the partner is opposite to them but opposite attract what this one is weak in this one is strong in and this one could complement in this area and that area and together forget it a dynamic team come on say Amen somebody so the social is good at teaching counseling nursing giving information values helping people solving social problems see themselves as helpful friendly and trustworthy the enterprising it's a different personality type likes to lead persuade people to sell things and ideas generally watch avoids activity that require careful observation and analytical thinking so they don't like to be under too much scrutiny they like to be on the flow on the move they sell now they have another guy he likes pound Shilling and Pence and with he scent he likes line he likes Perfection he likes lines draws and so on square and next person might say that good good 4 to8 that's that's all right that can make it the other person he is so fir he want to know what's the measurement 6 foot 3 in1 that's what he wants that's what he is now you could imagine that free person marri that other person and that measurements had to take place inside the house you see what we're talking about now this is the drama we're talking about now you could imagine the language you're talking so when one language say yeah that could work that could work another man say no six for three that will work two different languages come on say Amen somebody so I'm sharing this with you that you could understand in dealing with the personality you've got to know if you're talking the same language because you may be talking the Greek and he is talking German praise the name of the Lord and both of all you the same house trying to communicate trying to make it and you can't make it because you're not speaking the same language but when we finish today you're going to get the same language you'll be talking the same language whoa how you with me all right so the enterprising personality seees as energetic ambitious sociable last one conventional like to work with numbers records machines in a set orderly way genuinely avoids ambiguous unstructured activities so they want to know where the program the other guy we could start whenever we could have whatever let me let me go with the flow we going to wing it but this guy he have no Wing in it where are the details now you need them because these where you find the accountants the Auditors you need them so you need the detailed person you need the bubbly freeze person what are how we going to live with all these kind they make a difference if everybody like me the world would be boring you wouldn't want everybody to be like you come on you need somebody to be different somebody to be a nurse there some people can't see blood they will faint so you're not going to get them applying to do nursing some people can't hand the children they're not going to teach some people like Machinery they don't like the crowd so you grind and machine drilling whole day drilling whole day drilling whole day capping the coke whole day day c c whole day they love that amen whacking whole day by theel they're not sociable whacking whole day I'm not hitting I'm not talking about anybody they enjoy that they that you know let the crowd come and them not they disturb the heaven and there are somebody they can't work without people they need people people is their juice people is their energy people give them Vibes come on now let's do it we can do it everybody see me here I we can do it they are the life of the party they have all the attention and so on so this conventional see themselves value success in business see themselves ordinary orderly and working following a set plan now these different types respond differently to life and that is why in marriage one size don't fit all could somebody say amen amen therefore here we go you cannot take advice from someone whose husband is Artistic and your and and and your husband is not because what could work with that person with an artistic husband will not work with you with a husband who like numbers lines borders detail you cannot take advice from husband who's investigative he like to into things you see it I want to find that quot wa it is something happened across who who where where yeah I go and find out it have somebody who they not even going near they not doing our next person where where the action is that the investigative there is no perfect wife or perfect husband for you that is a myth and I want to destroy that Myth today there is no perfect husband or wife or rib or soulmate get over it you can learn to love you can grow in love and you could stay in love could we say Amen now imagine I went you all the personality type to say this I'm going to say now wo afterwards you'll dismiss all that personality thing when you finish here where we going Isaac and Rebecca did not take a personality test to sa the match she never saw Isaac before no picture on Facebook no emails no chats no messenger just a word from elazer no cour no dating yet it worked why why it worked the Bible is a Eastern book and the attitudes of wom at that time was a scriptural one in which here we go they respected the man and in return the man loved them the language of love to the man is translated as respect or respect is interpreted by the man as love from the woman marriage is a little more than finding the right person it is about you becoming the right person could somebody say amen hallelujah because it's it's bothersome when people fall in love see now that's the problem that's the easy one that's the easiest one one to fall in love as you fall in people can fall out I fall in love and guess what happened after 3 years fall out of love clean because you didn't get the opportunity to grow into love and then have that love just consumed and get both of you all glued together that nobody could come between you and your wife and you on your partner amen so watch marriage is a little more than finding the right person is about you becoming that right person and I want you to say this after me I am responsible I am responsible for becoming the right person for becoming the right person for my companion for say it again I am responsible I am responsible for becoming the right person the right for my companion all right I want to read that scripture again of Ephesians what we read but this time I want to read it from the Amplified be subject one another out of reverence for Christ the Messiah wives listen be subject be submissive and adapt yourselves to your own husband as a service to the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church as the church is subject to Christ so let the wives be subject in everything to their husbands husband love your wives as Christ loved the church and give himself up for her so that he might sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing of the water with the word that he might present uh uh the church to himself in glorious Splendor without spot a wrinkle or having such things she might be holy and faultless even so husband should love their wives being in a sense their own buddies he who loves his wife love himself for no man ever hat his own flesh but nourish it and cherish it and protect it so does Christ as the church for this reason shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak considering Christ and the church oh praise the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord all right however Let each man of you without exception love his wife being in a sense his very own self and let the wife see that she respects and reverence her husband listen that she notices him regards him honors him prefers him venerates esteems him that she defers to him Praises him loves and admires him exceedingly now you keep hearing we are promised another Ephesians right we are going back to the Fate another Ephesus another Ephesians if Ephesians holds the key to the Moder day dilemma of what ills marriages Ephesians says husband love your wives it never said wife love your husband strange isn't it it never say wife love your husband it say husband love your wives but it said wives reverence or respect your husband 1 Peter 3:1 says likewise he wives be in subject to your own husbands if any obey not the word that also May by the word be W by the conversation of the wise while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear let me read it and Amplified for you in like manner you married woman be submissive to your own husband subordinate yourselves as being secondary to dependent on them adapt yourself to them so that even if you do not obey the word of God they may be one over not by discussion but by The Godly lies of their wives when they observe the pure and modest way in which you conduct yourselves together with your reverence for your husband you are to feel for him all the reverence includes to respect defer honor esteem appreciate prize in the human sense to adore him admire praise be devoted to deeply love and enjoy your husband let not yours be merely external ad elaborate into weaving nothing of here wearing of jewelry change of clothes let it be the Inward adorning and the beauty of the Hidden person of the heart which is Incorruptible an unfaded charm of a gentle and peaceful Spirit which is not anxious or rough up but is precious in the sight of God for thus the pious woman of old who hoped in God were accustomed to beautify themselves and were submissive to their husband adapting them elves to them as themselves secondary and dependent upon them it was thus that Sarah obeyed Abraham following his guidance and acknowledging his headship over her by calling him Lord Master leader Authority and you are now true daughters if you do right and let nothing terrify you not giving away to hysterical fears of letting anxiety unnerve you in the same way you married men should live considerably with your wives with intelligent Rec nition of marriage relation honoring the woman as physically the weaker but realizing that you are joint ears of the grace of God's UNM merited favor of life yet this SP Brothers in order that your prayers may not be hindered and cut off in other words otherwise you cannot pray effectively so understand this this is very important and I'm so glad that you here because if you don't get it right your prayers will be affected as a man as a Son of God your prayer will not be effective so you have you have to have a desire by God's grace to get this right how do you respect a man you hear the word respect respect means to esteem Aspire admire think highly of hold in high regard to honor applaud praise favor so when you hear a wife say you you're looking for praise yes he's looking for praise he's not just looking for it he needs it I only hear one sister clapping that's my wife only one sister clap and that was my wife clapping there she's good she does give her man what he needs Oh Glory she's very good she's a wise woman all right all right do you praise him do you have a high opinion of him do you hold him in high regard you see your man your husband is not a woman who wear pants and your wife is not a man who does wear dress she is different and many men sometime they don't get that and many women don't get that they think the other half is one just like them who do understand them and they're trying to get them to understand what they are saying but they don't understand that I when I say that that man there is man m n your wife is not a man who we a dress many times you want your husband to think like you but he is not female male could somebody say Amen many husband want the wife to think like them but she is not male the Bible said respect the man if God said it and you do it you will get the benefit from it men are logical women are emotional I was reading and preparing this scientists have discovered that woman physically in their brain are wir different whatever the brains is as he this is and this is I'm not a scientist so I'll just generalize so recogn I'm not in that category their brains are different they are different okay I'm going to skip so men have what they call logical thinking and the moment are emotional thinking men respond to the gate of their eyes women through their ears what they hear and that is why man have fight and Tra with lust and all the advertisement you see wrong is some kind of half naked woman because they know men through the eye gate will respond and women will respond with their ears what they hear therefore here we go Brothers husbands Ms men a woman needs a man to talk to her place getting quiet Bo is there any woman in the house the men don't want to say Amen not the woman want the man to talk to her you know I didn't say want I said need because she is activated through the air and it so happen the men has get fight with that so they playing dumb and the woman can't read their mind the woman can't read their thoughts and again one word answer sometime two if you're lucky but she cannot read your mind she needs to hear your voice amen so if you are not talking to her you are messing up a man need you to be looking good yes sir to be pleasing to the eyes he wants to be proud of his wife Jesus is going to get a bride without spot without wrinkle she'll be pressed down neatly that bride will be looking good come on now is how people looking good on their way being chased man going after they looking good or when they catch them I want go there did not not looking as good as they used to look before so they operate and looking kind of what you call L so therefore that bride going to be without spot without wrinkle but listen to this part husbands here we go Brothers love your wife the wife needs love them light amen amen amen amen amen Amen brother don't they they want to say man choking like a it didn't say the wife need a new stove it didn't say the wife e a new Jo room couch or chair or new curtains needs love husband love your wives but her brothers who don't see that is a need so we going to get down into it she needs affection affection a gentle feeling of fness or likeness affection the act of affecting or influencing to produce a desired results look some look like a talking Greek I hope you're understanding my language affection is the is the expression of care it symbolizes security protection approval you are important to me I care for you I'll protect you I want you to know I'll be there when you need me so you have to learn to be more affectionate un affectionate doesn't have to cost much we don't say you have to go to the states to be affectionate sometime A Little Flower by the side of the road you could pick and bring home and Dutch and shivers you may not like to pick flowers but if the wife like that then you give her what she needs come on now don't don't get me started this is what this is about a simple hug a love you note like I like my wife come all of a sudden just so and she have a sweet name for me and if you don't have a sweet name you in trouble um she I want you to know I love you I said Thank you thank you thank you that songs good to my ear and sometime I will just walk up to her and tell her I I want you to know I'll marry you again you woman be proud that your husband choose you you could have choose somebody else you better thank God for the privilege you know I hear brother saying amen ouch I'm not going down there I'm not going down there all right so there are things you could thank God for all right so therefore holding hands taking all for dinner booket of flowers chocolate you say I'm nothing into the chocolate thing I know but she needs it you say I am not in this flower business and I talking about my experience you think I just talking K or you thought I talking on the paper no I walk up the aisles just like you I Say I Do just like you I came home just like you and asked my wife if you pray you read today I thought that is what we're supposed to be until I met her they crying she said but you don't even thank me for the meal you don't even tell me the place looking nice I say oh God I don't know that is how I supposed to do so then I have to learn how to move remember I married age 21 it had no school of marriage nobody taught me how to get married how to be in marriage how to stay married I've got there through all the Rough Side of the Mountain and Mama I made it thank you Jesus so then I learned what flowers mean what the chocolate mean and what my goodness what being affectionate means you we that amen song in there but I got I got have to have a Brother's meeting afterwards all men meeting let's get down to stuff that I I wouldn't want to say here I want to tell the brothers directly to their face they cheap on that amen what we talking about here affectionate the thing that make us feel that we alive make life worth living the man and this thing struck me and it was such a blessing today I got a phone call from my brother and he was such a blessing to me didn't know because he gave such a witness to what I wanted to say today he tell me brother over he said I want to thank you for your ministry and helping his marriage and so on and he said his wife said something to him that blew him out sometime back really blew him out she said I think about you first I fold your clothes first I see about what for you first and I said she is showing you respect he said exactly and he you know it did something for him and he treat her differently after that and you could see from what the brother is saying it mean something to him and you know what strange enough that respect is what bugs so many women so many marriages so many lives and people are robbed hear me robbed of a healthy relationship from not doing what God Said to do he didn't say husband respect your wife you hear a woman say a woman respects you're wrong you want the wrong thing you need love the man need respects one of the best references I have heard is that of a car and I love that reference a car and I want to use that reference a car needs gas to perform or to drive from point A to point B am if you don't get the gas you either go on foot or you don't go at all the car need gas if you want to use a car you need what you need a gas you may not like you may not like to smell the gas you don't drink the gas but the car needs gas so if you want the car to go you put gas in the car in the same way the car need gas the woman needs love 40% clapping 40% saying amen could we get a Le 60% let us know we pass let's push the lever the same way the car need gas the man needs respect and woman wives if you don't give that respects you're messing up men if you don't give that love and affection you are messing up I don't care much you pray you could pray whole day and go say hello love your wife and you could pray and speak in Tong and speak in tongues and you're praying whole day and you don't respect your husband God will say hello respect like your husband am so you're wasting your prayer until you do listen what needs to be done now I know I never spoken this before I never spoke like this before concerning this because I don't want your seat as I want I want you to see there a [Music] need because you know what happen when gas station closed no the person go to next gas [Music] station this is real this is serious you better keep your gas station open could somebody say [Applause] Amen so it has nothing to do with you are not into chocolates or flowers it has to do with what she needs I am not talking about sex I am talking about affection I am talking about romance I am talking about love I'm that's what I'm talking about oh could we give the god some praises [Applause] h maybe I left it back in the office if I can get it here you see deila Delila couldn't call Samson Mr Samson could you tell me while you're so strong Sams would didn't B his eye she had a sweet name for him [Applause] Samy Sam who you so strong gopel gopel one man's Day Gospel yes she could come and Mr Samson could you please tell me how you're so strong woman just just get away from me she had to have a way of influence she had to have a way that she could get him after wearing him out tell me please and sweeten him up then he could say yes you cut me ha I lose my strength look for example God talked to Abraham God say Abraham you have a son name is Isaac this is God talking to the man this is not some Arch Bishop or some president or some next door neighbor this is God himself come and talk to Abraham you know ABR going talk to Sarah and Sarah say is that right look hagga there God tell you that look have a made there you know you know Abraham listened to to his wife isn't that funny that that man just hear from God and he just put God aside and just do what that woman tell him do that's that's kind of SC yeah but what I'm saying then she had influence if you have no influence you have some work to do all right but you see now we have women who figure the you know the equal status and and the figure that's the way go you know what I mean I you know I I am you know who I am no yes I know who you are you you supposed to be helping to your husband Bible didn't say the man going be helping to the woman you have it back to front you have it wrong you supposed to be help me to the man you supposed to be his assistant you supposed to be a help meet that you could help meet his needs and if you not meet his needs problems it come like a home a home a house supposed to be a refuge for a man it's supposed to be a place where you feel safe where a man want to come home it are some men who don't want to come home they work extra and over time no not I'm not hit it over time don't don't don't hit me anybody here extra overtime I'm not accusing you of anything I'm just making a point you have men who they would stay back lying with the boys a little bit because they know home is like a war zone when the home that a duck might be in Iraq and they ducking Baghdad so you you beat out yourself and then you ease yourself at home ease yourself at home but it's not supposed to be that it's supposed to be when the man come tired and weary he can't wait to see that lady standing on that door he can't wait to see a welcome sign a welcome Spirit a welcome attitude he can't wait she knows how to welcome her man my beloved is mine and I am his oh come on say and some that's what the Solomon [Applause] said but some have it rough and some have it really tough oh my so what you going to do get this and play this back for your wife husband whatever sit down together let let let's listen to it we need this you need to hear God's plan and program because you're missing out but Shane sends some email to me I didn't get it he says a woman who's not even a Christian she decid to apply the Christian principle of subjecting to her husband and she have marital bliss she has a real breakthrough because many women don't understand the power of respect it has nothing to do with how the man is a woman a foolish woman breaks down a house with her own hands with her own mouth she telling this one about she husband telling her watch your husband husband this and he this and he that but he is still your husband and you're still in the man house but he is this and he is that oh God he not like this one you cannot compare him he's different he's unique he's special to you he is one of a kind come on sayen somebody so let's hear what's great about him what's powerful about him may have his weaknesses he have his struggle but there is something inside of him that we need to tap into to unlock what's inside of him that's what this is all about that you could unlock your man and you could unlock your woman and together forget about it you are forced to be reckoned with what God joined together let no man what God join together let no man put a ther oh give the Lord a shout of Praise come on man I want you fellas to get back excited all over again said boy this preacher is a crazy man I'm not oh Hallelujah songs of Solomon behold th had fear my love behold thou had fear thou has Dove eyes within thy locks thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear on Mong gillad thy teeth like the rock of the flock of sheep that that even sha even come up from washing where of everyone be twins and none is barring among them thy lips are like the tread of scarlet Thy Thy speech is comely thy templates are like piece of pomegranate within thy locks the man have lyrics the man have game the man have talk the man have Romance the man have class he knows what to speak Hallelujah to get an effect upon that woman oh say Amen somebody Hallelujah th neck is like the the Tower of David build it from Armory wearing they hang a thousand bucklers all Shields of Mighty Men I don't understand that they deep Mysteries she in that time will understand what you talking about we have to go different I been go in no lyrics for you that be for my wife but have lyrics for this time you have to know what you're saying to the lady you can't be dumb you can't be you don't know what you're going to say and you're watching two ear in a date or something you're just watching and she watching you what nothing going to happen how that supposed to work when I saw I tell the pastor there something about that lady that I like I didn't talk to she when I saw hot the camera me take a picture clicks picture inside of there she don't know picture inside of there and picture come nobody come between me and the picture I go let somebody come between me and a picture I just waiting my my my my I was very serious I smiling now since I meet her I smiling since I was a very serious serious guy and one day no that's no joke you know deadly serious when I shake sister hand I I shakeing so God bless you I Ain looking at no face at all I don't want nobody disturb me I don't want to be influenced by nobody I keeping myself my eyes in position I make a covenant with my eyes other day I was speaking and I laugh and me said but didn't know you could laugh the laugh is what do and I was say it I laughing [Laughter] since oh my goodness 21 you talk in may get Eng engaged in June and get married in December of the same year that was record breaking at that time 21 years old open that door and walk right in that was great times you know what it's tough to meet her mother that was tough the first time I meeting her mother is to tell her mother I'm coming to take your daughter mother cry that was bad that was that was but I didn't know I I I I was just looking to move now me and mother have no problems at all best son-in-law I believe but at that time was tough but my it was great stuff man I say you will come and live with me you wouldn't like to know where the house was we call chili B phone from the roof when you open the door you see the back door one time a piece of plyboard separating this from that side and that's the end of the house I said you could come here and she said but yes when she walk out she crazy love love love is a powerful thing you know love does make people do stuff you you forget about it when you fall in love that's a that's why you got to fall in love with Jesus you would stay with the word you would stay with the message you would stay with God one burner stove never forget that not two or three bu the pot had to finish upon next but that was part of the love package now some ministers would should your bank account before you make a move read bam life story so sad bams couldn't afford he missed the rent to pay on the installment of the the couch for $1 he couldn't pay it and day when he come home wife cooking she said go on fish and whatnot because they repossess the couch and that was the couch he used to relax on that couch that couch was Heavenly to him he used to relax and they couldn't afford it but that was part of the package God takes us through stuff that we could understand the vow for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness on health till death do us part not till complaint do us part till death do us SP could you take some more all right praise the name of the Lord she needs affection a woman needs a man to be open and honest with him with her a woman needs a man to talk to her I believe a woman shouldn't have to beg for finances for things that she needs she don't have to feel she's in a prison in your house are the mercies of what you have to give her if she have to beg for money and complain about money that you have power to give you as a man have blown it you have messed up is you have to beg and ask and fight for funds to buy the things the home needs to improve and make it better and you're in a position to do so and do not you are acting mean and you are outing the fire of her creativity to make the house a great home you see without that creative Spirit without that atmosphere is just for walls that two people living under roof that they're living under it's not a home it's a house and two people people live there and you can't understand why two of them on the edge of the bed and they facing each other they back each they facing each other back to back whether you say Amen or not doesn't matter I'm not going to ask for Amen on that one I'll let one go now now my dear sister you can't sit in the corner and say to your husband you have Jesus and Jesus is all you need because I had Jesus before I saw Anmar but when I went after Anmar I wasn't going after Jesus I had him before I was going for Anmar to have an too so I want you to understand you cannot said say that that just a kind of religious freakish kind of thing that is not going to work work you cannot say and tell your husband you have Jesus no no no no no no no that's why he marry you he marry you for a purpose and you are there for a purpose be a help me to him isn't that right Blessed Be of the Lord so we said the man home should be a hiding place a place he wants to be safe comforted feeling good about his home a man needs that he don't want to come home and meet a grumpy complaining nagging woman not not not even looking right the man want to go home there are men who dread going home because their wise make them feel like dirt like they are nothing God said to Adam there was no help me for him she the wife was made and her purpose was to be able to help meet Adam's needs not to compete with him or argue with him question are you supplying what your husband needs are you supplying what your wife needs do you love him this evening amen okay hindrances meddle in law mother-in-law and other Outlaws I invented this one medalin law do ask me where that come from it just come hindrances no forgiveness long outstanding grudges oats and I have un meddled in- laws and that's that's a powerful one when the family in-laws interfere with your marriage the Bible said for this cause shall a man leave his mother and father and cleave to his wife and they shall become one flesh husbands and wives are directed to leave their fathers and mothers it does not make it doesn't mean to ignore abandon or forsake it does not mean that you must move away from the vicinity of your parents what it means is that the husband wife relationship is priority and your relationship with your parents have to take a back seat secondary to the relationship with your spouse it means that you are more concerned about your spouse opinions ideas and so forth than your parents it means you cannot try to change your husband or wife because your parents don't like this about him or this about her and your parents feel about this because once there is in-laws Outlaws men in-laws it will affect the opportunity to blend amen because it would have the influences that affects the marriage it have some men are Mommy boys they are mommy boys I don't know if there's any here but it have people are like that it have girls who are daddy girls and mmy boys sometimes Tak an inflence from their mother from his mother so into the marriage is what the mother say and the mother say and the mother say and the wife saying something too [Music] like I always get trouble with brothers who will talk nice nice with everybody ex nice except their wife that's a problem with me Charity B is at home you had to be able to talk to her nice at home and everything else and it will reflect on the outside your husband line of respect is for somebody respect the pastor they respect the husband how how that could be your husband first and if he see you respecting somebody outside of him he feels the pressure as a man you're not supposed to tell any other woman what you haven't tell your wife as a woman you're not supposed to tell any person anything other than your husband you will just mess up you have to have their trust and confidence and let them protect you the day I worker told my a job my cologne smelling nice I said I'll tell my wife that my song Light trival Petty but you know when I come home I did that she told me it's smelling nice because she that col enough for she that's for me to smell right on the job and for my wife are you with me you I'm saying so if somebody push and move I want my wife to know there's a character there on the job all right because she is the one there to protect what if I don't say what if she start to move now and I start to respond to that and next minute there's a hidden something is not clear it's not above board and next minute I find in fault with my wife and she don't know why I edgy and irritable and irritated and you have to complain about this and complaining about that and complain about yeah because somebody is screwing up outside of day and messing things up onside there so on my job I used to value my wife I said my wife is a Mercedes-Benz don't mess with me don't bring no Beetle and no bug and whatnot this guy is different alog together and her name she's precious and ask man job how is precious how is precious a valuer a cherisher when the teacher say oh look at that dress you know they talk about other workers and so I said it would look good on my wife that's who she is right I not I not congratulate nobody about all looking no that will look good on my wife my wife is the lady I don't care who's the best cook in the country and what not she's the best cook in I tell my wife every all the other food is to block a hole when she cooks that is food that is food that is food best cook in the country and you can't challenge that that's right because she's the best cook to me and I tell her she my mama guy but that's not true it do really taste good to me I tell her when I get her soup so she said other people canot cook soup like this best soup in the country now what do you tell your wife you got to tell her the right things she need to hear from you she need to hear certain words and that does what it's supposed to do it's almost done so there's a leaving that Adam must do your father and mother help you the other the people that you owe so much in life but then the Bible call you to leave to lose forsake depart why would God say that the home nurtured you prepared you confront of um comforted you and so on and yet you're called to leave why in order you cannot cleave until you leave your mother and father because that relationship affect with your bonding God is holding you as men accountable and your responsibilities your wife and your children isn't that right blessed be the name of the Lord so friends let me say this we all come from broken homes healing is in Christ the word word amen the word is Ephesians amen for husband to love their wives for wives to respect their husband respect is to hold him in high esteem respects is to speak highly of him we must break the curse of a signing blame stop a signing blame I'm from a broken home my father wasn't a true father my mother was this my father was that my family is this way all of them is this way my mother acted this way my father acted this way you are assigning blame for your condition stop it life and marriages is about change you change from being single to be a couple you change you get a new name you take on your husband's name you change the that you cannot just make individual decisions because it affecting the partnership within the home you are committed in this relationship For Better or For Worse this is our first marriage seminar there are lots of things that I know that is outstanding and I wouldn't be able to get in today and I would share some of the things that I have written on here depleting the bank account of love romance respect kindness and Goodwill some people just draw down they only writing out checks they're taking all the benefits from off the marriage account and afterwards it's empty it's in red then when you make deposits it look so small you do something and you're looking for a praise from your wife and your wife G none and you're looking for a praise because things get so bad it's depleted how do we replenish the bank account of love and emotions love doesn't just stay love have to grow or love will die I want you to say a big Amen on that I have seen it people in

have couch she have new curtain and she crying out and if fish have ham fish have cheese and she crying out because she those things are not meeting the needs she can't talk to the H the F not answer
