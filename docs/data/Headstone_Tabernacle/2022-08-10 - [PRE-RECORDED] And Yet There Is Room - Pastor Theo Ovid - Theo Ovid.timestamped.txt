[17:19] you
[17:20] amen
[17:22] and what i've been preaching for the
[17:24] past years
[17:26] has been my core belief
[17:28] like core in terms of
[17:30] this is my inner being sovereignty of
[17:32] the local church the freedom of the
[17:34] spirit the holy ghost certain things are
[17:36] just in resonating my system not the
[17:39] system of man and the power of of
[17:42] bishoprian and and mother church and
[17:44] whatnot all these things that's not part
[17:46] of my system i have always been i feel
[17:49] that the saints should have that liberty
[17:51] of god
[17:52] i see legalism over the years trying to
[17:54] conform people and pong them and push
[17:56] them and run with it but there is
[17:58] nothing when the love of god takes your
[18:00] heart
[18:00] and you understand
[18:02] the grace and the mercy and the
[18:04] opportunity that god has given you
[18:06] some people take it for granted they
[18:08] just care for you with it but i can't be
[18:10] every day i'm grateful every day i'm
[18:12] thankful because he doesn't have to give
[18:14] me another day just think about just
[18:16] think about it now
[18:17] many people are not going to even reach
[18:19] your age
[18:20] but god gives you another day
[18:22] another year another time another season
[18:25] free i didn't come to say all of that
[18:26] this morning but such an atmosphere i
[18:28] don't want to leave

[18:56] great uh expectation for god and god has
[18:58] given me real strength i know it is
[19:00] strength of the lord
[19:02] god i've touched my kidneys touched my
[19:04] body
[19:05] i can do what i've done
[19:07] for the past two years the god didn't
[19:09] help me physically
[19:11] so i am very very grateful to god
[19:14] there was such a great need
[19:16] i remember my testimony 2010 the lord
[19:18] spoke to my heart and said i'm back on
[19:20] the fields i was in the field for many
[19:22] many years the lord spoke to me through
[19:23] my wife and standing lord told me i'm
[19:25] back in the fields there was nobody
[19:26] there was no cause there was nothing
[19:28] and 2012 the cause began to come in and
[19:31] god fulfill his word god never speaks
[19:32] something that he can't back up
[19:34] god can't lie if god speaketh if it's
[19:36] god if it's god he will vindicate it
[19:42] there's a need there's a need out there
[19:44] and now that god is opening the world to
[19:46] us in such a positive way then you
[19:48] realize that a lot of
[19:50] things say mirrors and shadows
[19:54] it's just shadows it's not the real
[19:56] thing the real thing is christ
[19:58] and you
[20:00] christ
[20:01] in you all right that's the real thing
[20:03] not the church not the organization not
[20:06] the group
[20:07] not the body
[20:08] a people but christ in you the hope of
[20:10] glory
[20:11] and when you see that you are an
[20:13] individual powerhouse you become a
[20:15] source of god you see you you come your
[20:18] own power source then
[20:20] afterwards you have to plug into nobody
[20:23] you plug into the source himself
[20:25] resource coming inside of you
[20:27] then you become a source of god
[20:29] to go out to the world to your family to

[22:41] reading from verse 16
[22:44] then he said this is and then said he
[22:47] unto him a certain man
[22:49] made a great supper and beat many
[22:51] sent his servant at suppertime to say to
[22:53] them that forbidden come for all things
[22:56] and already
[22:57] and then all with one consent
[23:00] began to make excuse the first said unto
[23:03] him i have bought a piece of ground i
[23:05] must needs go and see it i pretty have
[23:07] an excuse
[23:08] another said i have bought five yoke of
[23:10] oxen and i have to prove them i crazy
[23:13] have me excused another said i have
[23:15] married a wife and therefore i cannot
[23:17] come
[23:17] so the servants came showed his lord
[23:20] these things then the master of the
[23:22] house being angry said to himself and
[23:24] scored quickly into the streets and
[23:27] lanes
[23:28] of the city and bringing hither the poor
[23:31] and the meme
[23:32] and the halt and the blind and the
[23:34] servant said lord it is done as thou has
[23:37] commanded and yet there is room
[23:39] and the lord said unto the servant go
[23:41] out into the highways
[23:44] into the byways
[23:45] and go out into the
[23:47] highways and hedges and compel them to
[23:50] come in that my house may be filled
[23:54] for i say unto you that none of those
[23:57] men which were bidden shall taste of my
[24:00] supper
[24:02] reading from revelation chapter 18 verse
[24:04] 1 to 5. and after these things i saw
[24:07] another angel come down from heaven
[24:08] having great power and the earth was
[24:11] lightened with his glory
[24:13] he cried mightily with a strong voice
[24:15] saying babylon the greatest fallen is
[24:17] fallen and has become a habitation of
[24:19] devils and the hold of every false
[24:21] spirit
[24:22] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[24:25] bird for all nations are drunk of the
[24:28] wine of the wrath of a fornication and
[24:31] the kings of the earth have committed
[24:32] fornication with her and the merchants
[24:34] of the earth are waxed rich through the
[24:36] abundance of a delicacies and i heard
[24:39] another voice from heaven saying come
[24:40] out from her my people that she be not
[24:43] partakers of her sins and that he
[24:45] received none of our plagues for her
[24:47] sins have reached unto heaven and god
[24:49] had remembered her iniquities that's
[24:51] boris who to pray father we thank you
[24:53] for your word bless it interpret your
[24:55] hearts confirm your word with signs
[24:57] wonders and miracles and bless your
[24:59] people your needy children that are here
[25:01] looking for virtue deliverance touch
[25:04] healing from you granted father honor
[25:06] your word lord in jesus name we ask it
[25:08] amen and amen you may be seated praise
[25:10] god blessed be the name of the lord just
[25:13] give god some praises
[25:14] as you are seated
[25:28] i have a title this morning
[25:30] and yet there is room
[25:32] amen that's my title
[25:34] amen
[25:36] have an inspiration
[25:38] come out of babylon
[25:40] come out of confusion because that is
[25:43] what babylon is
[25:44] i want to bring back something we said
[25:47] two sundays are back from the seal of
[25:49] god
[25:50] but abraham was saying this the first
[25:52] church started off at the pentecost
[25:54] where the holy spirit was poured out on
[25:56] believers
[25:58] that is where the church started off
[26:00] start of where
[26:01] at pentecost
[26:03] we saw the reaction of these believers
[26:05] and how it acted upon them
[26:07] what they did and the signs and wonders
[26:09] that followed them
[26:11] now
[26:12] after
[26:13] the closing of the church age about 300
[26:15] years they sprung up a heresy among them
[26:17] called the doctrine of the nicolaitan it
[26:20] was a heresy and that word nicoletan
[26:23] means a conquer the lady it was the
[26:25] introduction of men
[26:27] ruining the church without holy ghost
[26:30] structure of men
[26:32] okay we find out it was deeds to begin
[26:34] with the next church age would become a
[26:36] doctrine and then become persecution in
[26:38] a dark age
[26:40] then
[26:41] when martin luther come out
[26:43] seeing the spirit of god lead him out
[26:46] instead of letting the people stay free
[26:48] he organized the church an image
[26:50] lightened to the beast so clearly the
[26:53] prophet revealed what the image of the
[26:54] beast is any organized
[26:57] church is image unto the beast because
[26:59] the b system is the catholic church
[27:01] which was the first organized church and
[27:03] on her relations 17 said she had
[27:05] blasphemous names and these names are
[27:07] like baptist mothers pentecostal
[27:09] witnesses all these names are names of
[27:10] blasphemy because god didn't make that
[27:13] god only making sons and daughters in
[27:15] the last days god from his sons and
[27:16] daughters methodist produced methodist
[27:18] baptist produced baptist pentecostal
[27:20] produced pentecostal but god's word
[27:22] produced sons and daughters
[27:24] so god promises an elijah the prophet to
[27:26] turn the house of the children back to
[27:28] the faith of the fathers
[27:29] so god called the mother church a
[27:32] and call it that your daughters which is
[27:34] protestant churches so podca called
[27:36] black
[27:38] because both all are filthy in god's
[27:41] sight and it's a spirit it's an
[27:43] organizational spirit and once that take
[27:45] church once that take over then the
[27:47] people don't speak as individuals they
[27:49] speak with the church voice
[27:53] and that is the be system
[27:55] when you're speaking with a church voice
[27:57] when you no longer have the voice of god
[27:59] as an individual by revelation peter
[28:02] said the christ the son of the living
[28:04] god
[28:05] peter didn't speak for nobody
[28:07] jesus said flesh and blood had not
[28:09] revealed this unto you but my father had
[28:12] revealed it unto you and i said thou art
[28:15] beaten upon this rock i will build
[28:17] my
[28:18] church and the gates of hell will never
[28:22] prevail against them
[28:37] so when martin luther come out seeing
[28:38] the spirit of god leave him out instead
[28:40] of letting the people stay free he
[28:42] organized the church and imagined the
[28:44] beast a political power likened unto it
[28:48] watch so then they organized the church
[28:51] and made an image unto the beast a
[28:52] political
[28:53] organized power
[28:55] purpose to bind the people to
[28:59] a creed
[29:00] instead of being free to worship and
[29:03] walk in the light
[29:04] [Music]
[29:06] what do you realize christian friends
[29:07] that the antichrist which is the mark of
[29:09] the beast the antichrist anyone knows
[29:10] that
[29:11] the mark is a power
[29:14] the beast is a power
[29:16] here we go are you ready there's a power
[29:18] of the catholic church there's a power
[29:20] of the methodist church there's a power
[29:23] that's that is beast power
[29:25] the baptist church the same all of them
[29:27] the pentacles are just as bad
[29:29] so the prophet prophesied
[29:31] in 1955 around the 50s that there will
[29:34] come a message among the gentiles that
[29:36] will bring the bride out
[29:42] so many are being people being marked by
[29:44] the beast system and don't even know it
[29:46] listen to what the prophet said he said
[29:48] well god bless you from seed of the
[29:50] antichrist
[29:51] he said if you want to see real
[29:53] christian genuine gifts and not
[29:55] impersonation if you want to see real
[29:56] solid christians walking and so salty
[29:58] till they eat it's tinsel we can't go
[30:01] down the street and tell what a
[30:02] christian is anymore they go down the
[30:04] street they act the same they talk the
[30:06] same all the time cracking all kind of
[30:08] jokes everything like that when god said
[30:11] you give a kung fu every idle word that
[30:13] you speak what happened because brother
[30:15] you will let the devil come in and put
[30:17] it over your eyes the first thing you
[30:19] know hear the prophecy the time will
[30:21] come when god will give a message and
[30:25] you'll be sealed in or out of the
[30:26] kingdom
[30:29] amen
[30:31] here is the prophecy
[30:32] a message will come that will produce
[30:34] the ceiling in
[30:36] or
[30:37] seal it now
[30:39] no other thing
[30:41] sealing
[30:42] or sealed out
[30:44] so therefore when god gives that message
[30:46] you are sealed in or sealed out of the
[30:48] kingdom of god isn't that right and the
[30:50] seat of god is the holy ghost the mark
[30:52] of the beast is rejecting it amen or
[30:54] unbelief in the holy ghost or turn along
[30:56] the holy ghost that is the mark of the
[30:58] beast so the holy spirit come to seal
[31:01] you into the body of christ
[31:03] not into a church
[31:05] hallelujah
[31:06] that means you could go anywhere and
[31:08] worship

[37:03] none of them who got invited
[37:05] will be
[37:06] received taste of his supper
[37:08] remind me of the two million people that
[37:10] came out
[37:11] two million people didn't go in
[37:14] they just come out
[37:15] don't be like that
[37:17] don't be satisfied to come out i'm not a
[37:19] baptist i'm not a catholic i'm not a
[37:21] pentecostal you come out but have you
[37:23] gone in
[37:24] all right
[37:26] how many messages i believe william
[37:27] branham
[37:28] that's good you come out but have you
[37:30] gone in
[37:31] because the prophet himself
[37:33] he brought a message
[37:39] to go in
[37:41] message ephesians
[37:43] oh praise god
[37:44] all right now let's go now watch
[37:47] this is from christ the mission god
[37:49] reveal here we go
[37:50] god holds the key
[37:52] to the revelation of christ
[37:54] himself
[37:56] schools of theology can never find it
[37:59] jesus said so
[38:01] scripture matthew 11
[38:03] 25 and 27
[38:05] jesus said i thank thee father
[38:08] god of heavens and earth that was hid
[38:11] these things
[38:12] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[38:16] and has revealed it to babes
[38:19] such as would learn
[38:21] jesus himself said he hide it from them
[38:23] [Applause]
[38:26] but reveal it to his elect
[38:31] so watch isaiah said you have ears you
[38:33] can't hear eyes you can't see because
[38:36] isaiah said in the spirit god has
[38:38] blinded your eyes you do like eve
[38:41] accepting the intellectual side and know
[38:44] nothing of the spirit of god
[38:47] won't they fall in the ditch both the
[38:49] leader and the blind too the leader will
[38:51] fall with the blind because he's blind
[38:53] also the leader fall he's blind leaving
[38:56] the blind they both fall
[38:58] into the ditch do you say let them alone
[39:01] let the blind lead the blind we're not
[39:04] responsible for the blind leading blind
[39:06] we're responsible to bring the word to
[39:08] the elect
[39:09] thank god god open your eyes
[39:12] that you could hear and see
[39:14] and be free
[39:16] oh hallelujah
[39:18] god alone holds the key
[39:21] he expressed the same thing in the
[39:23] previous scripture who the men said the
[39:24] son of man
[39:25] and he told peter what when peter said
[39:27] that what the christ blessed us all
[39:29] simon jonah flesh and blood has never
[39:31] revealed it to you but my father which
[39:33] is here must reveal to you
[39:35] so therefore here we go
[39:39] there is no school
[39:41] no theologians
[39:43] no teaching of the bible among any
[39:45] school that knows anything about it
[39:47] they cannot know nothing about it it's
[39:49] impossible for them to know anything
[39:51] about it god has hid the senses of
[39:53] knowing it from the very elected
[39:55] teachers
[39:58] it's a personal individual affair
[40:01] with the person
[40:03] that christ has revealed to them
[40:05] did you get that
[40:06] it's not a group thing
[40:08] it's a personal affair that christ
[40:11] has revealed himself to you
[40:13] sometimes i wonder if people have ever
[40:15] met christ
[40:17] have you met christ have you met the
[40:20] lord
[40:21] has he softened your heart
[40:24] speak to your heart
[40:28] has you shown him has he shown you his
[40:30] cross
[40:31] have you fell at his feet
[40:33] and experienced the dripping of his
[40:35] blood from off
[40:36] calvary hallelujah mercy there was great
[40:40] and grace was free
[40:41] pardon there was multiplied to me
[40:44] there my burden soul from liberty and
[40:46] cavalry had you had a calvary experience
[40:48] when you could sing at the cross at the
[40:50] cross when i first saw the light
[40:53] turn at the cross where my savior died
[40:56] hallelujah dare from cleansing from sin
[40:59] i cried
[41:00] dear to my heart was the blood of plow
[41:04] singing glory to his name
[41:06] that is a rich christian experience
[41:09] not this intellectual mumbo jumbo
[41:11] sitting in a pew saying it in the
[41:13] message no
[41:14] they got to have a heart shaking
[41:17] demon chasing
[41:19] covering holy ghost anointing gospel
[41:24] that's what's lacking
[41:33] let's go
[41:35] if you say he's revealed to me
[41:37] and then the life that christ produced
[41:39] here in the bible does that produce
[41:41] death in you you've got the wrong
[41:42] revelation
[41:44] so they're not a talk thing
[41:45] they're not a talk show it's half talk
[41:48] show and comic shoe this is not that
[41:51] this is you have to have back in
[41:53] with your testimony
[41:55] isn't that right
[41:56] every denomination will be a fruit of
[41:57] itself
[41:58] of its own life
[42:01] and if here we go that original vine
[42:04] ever put forth another shoot it with
[42:07] their grapes like it did the first time
[42:10] now this is what i like the life of
[42:12] jesus christ ever puts forth another
[42:14] body of believers it would be the fruit
[42:17] of the first one did they will write a
[42:19] book of acts behind it
[42:21] oh you should give a scream on that one
[42:24] because that is the original church that
[42:26] is what the prophet was saying back to
[42:28] in the book of acts was in church
[42:31] who was the bishop
[42:32] who was the pope
[42:34] who was the man in church who was the
[42:36] man of the hour it had none like that
[42:39] the holy ghost sent peter so the holy
[42:41] ghost and philip the holy ghost sent
[42:44] also come on give the lord a scream in
[42:46] the house
[42:47] [Applause]
[42:55] here we go save the church
[42:58] is to put forth another branch it will
[43:00] be another
[43:03] book of acts
[43:04] it will be the acts of the holy ghost
[43:07] move into the people
[43:16] god
[43:16] [Music]
[43:18] is not known by education
[43:21] that's right you want a bigger bomb i'll
[43:23] keep reading
[43:24] god he is not known by how to explain it
[43:28] [Applause]
[43:30] let us talk a little bit
[43:32] somebody want to explain to trump
[43:35] god is not known like that
[43:37] somebody want to explain
[43:38] the new name you can explain it god's
[43:41] not known by explaining it i spend the
[43:43] millennium
[43:45] explain the seven seal
[43:47] explain the seven thunders god is not
[43:48] known by explanation
[43:50] he is known watch by simplicity
[43:54] and revelation of jesus christ
[43:58] to the most illiterate person
[44:01] you don't need education to get
[44:03] revelation
[44:04] [Applause]
[44:16] moses had education
[44:18] egyptian education
[44:20] moses was qualified he had his degree
[44:21] and masters
[44:22] in egyptian arts
[44:24] but when he killed the man he ran
[44:26] with his degree
[44:28] with his masters he ran straight out in
[44:30] egypt
[44:31] and went and established himself with a
[44:33] family relaxing for 40 years
[44:38] that same man that run went fire
[44:44] when fire came upon that man he said i
[44:46] can't talk what i make more continue
[44:50] [Applause]
[44:59] let that fire come upon your life once
[45:02] when i get them peer pressure i don't
[45:04] let me know people trying to push me and
[45:06] all my friends trying to push me and
[45:08] this one trying to pull me let that fire
[45:11] come upon you once
[45:13] this one
[45:19] it may be caesar
[45:20] that fire wrecked moses intellect
[45:23] when god finishes moses and you meet his
[45:24] wife he said where you going he said i
[45:26] go in to take over
[45:28] i'm going back to egypt
[45:30] not
[45:32] going back to egypt to take over that's
[45:34] when a man met god
[45:36] nothing blocks him nothing stops him
[45:38] nothing interrupts him that man is
[45:39] focused that man don't care that man is
[45:42] unstoppable that man is invincible that
[45:44] man cannot become conquered oh glory to
[45:47] god that man is a one-man invincible
[45:49] helmet sent by god he's one cent some
[45:52] went but this one was sent come on say
[45:55] him as somebody oh glory to god we don't
[45:58] bother with who just went oh but when
[46:00] god sent that something else the whole
[46:02] heaven behind you all the angels behind
[46:05] you the fire behind you the anointing
[46:08] behind you oh glory to god what a
[46:10] revival are we going to have
[46:12] [Applause]
[46:17] so god is known by simplicity and a
[46:20] revelation of jesus christ to the most
[46:22] illiterate person not your child not
[46:24] your theology is a revelation of jesus
[46:26] christ upon this rock i'll build my
[46:28] church no the rocks accepted no other
[46:30] things accepted nor the roman rock
[46:32] protestant rock nor the school nor than
[46:34] nothing but exactly the revelation of
[46:37] jesus christ through the new birth
[46:42] you never hear jesus christ's name once
[46:48] it's astonishing
[46:49] a whole service are you not even any
[46:51] name jesus
[46:53] every other thing
[46:55] what do you do that boy
[46:57] the bible is the revelation of jesus
[47:00] john all these mysteries john's the
[47:02] revelation of jesus christ which god
[47:04] gave to him
[47:07] all these symbols have to do with jesus
[47:09] christ
[47:10] he's the mystery behind it
[47:12] john said herself whitewashed rider
[47:14] bow with no arrow red horse bailors
[47:17] that was john c but behind that had paul
[47:20] martin arenas they couldn't see all of
[47:21] that that was stars in the right hand of
[47:23] god symbolize
[47:25] [Applause]
[47:27] so wherever you see the enemy don't just
[47:29] look at the enemy alone behind that has
[47:32] something hidden there
[47:34] come on now come on
[47:38] give me a scripture preacher whenever
[47:39] the enemy coming like a flood
[47:41] [Applause]
[47:45] the spirit is always there
[47:47] the rays are standard
[47:49] so the enemy comes like a flood and
[47:50] you're feeling wrong and you're feeling
[47:51] drowning and you feel like you're
[47:53] sinking but god is here today the rays
[47:56] are standard in your life
[48:02] okay here we go
[48:07] so exactly the revelation of jesus
[48:08] christ through the new birth he he's
[48:10] born in there and listen he injects his
[48:12] own life
[48:13] your life is gone and the life of christ
[48:16] is projecting itself through you with
[48:19] the preeminences to the people and they
[48:22] see
[48:23] the very life
[48:25] and works and signs and wonders that he
[48:29] did
[48:30] is doing the same thing through you
[48:32] outside of that the rest of it is not
[48:35] even called two at all
[48:36] watch
[48:37] god's great revelation unfolding
[48:41] by lack of this revelation
[48:43] is why we have so many different
[48:45] divisions
[48:47] among us
[48:48] so much mockery
[48:50] so much divisions because the people
[48:52] like that revelation
[48:54] they lack that revelation the teachers
[48:57] he didn't say in revelation making
[48:58] divisions
[49:00] he has seen
[49:01] lack of revelation
[49:03] what revelation the lack of the
[49:04] revelation of jesus christ
[49:06] because if you understand it's the
[49:08] revelation of jesus christ then no man
[49:10] will want to rule over no other man
[49:12] come on now
[49:14] the fight for ministries that a
[49:15] permanent post is till we all come
[49:18] come on now to the unity of the faith to
[49:21] the knowledge of the son of god unto our
[49:24] perfect man
[49:25] give the lord some praises
[49:37] you take a little
[49:39] small glass of ocean water
[49:41] you have the same contents as the whole
[49:50] small piece big piece god have different
[49:52] offices and roll like elijah said when
[49:55] he passed you giggling better than
[49:57] jericho he said what do you want he said
[49:58] double portion
[49:59] he said that's a hard thing
[50:01] my god he said that's a big thing that

[1:09:38] oh hell is against that
[1:09:42] because when you come as an individual
[1:09:44] you cannot be received
[1:09:49] because you are moving
[1:09:51] by
[1:09:52] revelation
[1:09:54] say revelation

[1:10:35] the reason i spoke against the church

[1:10:39] church
[1:10:40] but abraham
[1:10:42] there's only one church and that church
[1:10:45] is the body of christ
[1:10:46] but these lodges that called church my
[1:10:49] bible tells me that they are blasphemous
[1:10:52] names all of them
[1:10:56] all organizations
[1:10:58] what they are blaspheming blasphemy is
[1:11:01] to be contrary to

[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:12:01] watch this is so powerful
[1:12:04] he said when the baptism of the spirit
[1:12:06] is force he took for a wafer in the
[1:12:08] catholic church
[1:12:10] a handshake in the protestant church
[1:12:12] in the caricature is a way for hold that
[1:12:15] potential in church take that
[1:12:18] same thing
[1:12:20] mother of wafer daughter have shake
[1:12:23] hands
[1:12:25] listen to this
[1:12:26] when the baptism of the spirit
[1:12:28] is forced she took over away from the
[1:12:30] catholic church
[1:12:31] a handshake in the protestant church
[1:12:33] emotion in the pentecostal church
[1:12:35] instead of
[1:12:37] the person of christ here we go coming
[1:12:40] in with all that pyramid building that
[1:12:43] we had
[1:12:44] after your faith virtue and so forth
[1:12:47] and godliness and purity and holiness
[1:12:50] and then you are sealed by the holy
[1:12:51] ghost
[1:12:53] so what he is saying getting into the
[1:12:55] pyramid is getting into the church
[1:12:58] that's the body of christ not this
[1:13:00] building here
[1:13:01] oh hallelujah
[1:13:03] oh glory to god
[1:13:05] what is it we're in exodus
[1:13:08] the first exodus was a natural land to
[1:13:09] natural land the second exodus from a
[1:13:12] spiritual condition into a spiritual
[1:13:13] baptismal holy ghost no he's bringing
[1:13:16] him from a spiritual back in holy ghost
[1:13:18] to the land of the millennium hallelujah
[1:13:21] this is the last quote i believe yes
[1:13:22] last quote here
[1:13:24] wow
[1:13:25] so we find out our messages today
[1:13:27] the message we have is come out of
[1:13:28] babylon and be free
[1:13:30] be filled with the spirit
[1:13:32] you're lamb streamed and clear look up
[1:13:34] your redemption draw it near
[1:13:35] and yet in the midst of all of that we
[1:13:37] don't have nothing against those people
[1:13:39] totally not national people they're all
[1:13:41] right they're fine they are associated
[1:13:43] in the gospel because jesus said no man
[1:13:45] can come except the father draws him we
[1:13:47] were only responsible for sowing seeds
[1:13:50] some fell by the wayside some fell on
[1:13:52] different grounds we just sow in seeds
[1:13:55] may the lord bless you let's stand

[1:17:20] you appreciate our pastor this morning
[1:17:23] amen amen amen you may be seated for a
[1:17:27] few minutes
[1:17:28] i'm not going to be long with you at all
[1:17:31] we do have a prayer line
[1:17:33] right after this but i do want to make
[1:17:35] some announcements once again what can
[1:17:37] we say about our pastor
[1:17:41] i really want to salute him
[1:17:43] for his burden for his labor
[1:17:45] and what can we say about brother
[1:17:47] anthony with his exhortation last week
[1:17:50] lessons from the pool of bethesda
[1:17:53] remember it spoke and left no man
[1:17:55] deceive you and it's been
[1:17:56] every service going higher and higher
[1:17:59] and higher
[1:18:00] it's good to be in the house of god in a
[1:18:02] few
[1:18:02] hours as beloved said that around 4 p.m
[1:18:05] we are supposed to be in the airport
[1:18:07] so
[1:18:08] it just keeps going higher and higher
[1:18:11] and higher and higher amen so but god is
[1:18:14] good and uh so for this week we will
[1:18:16] have service on tuesday in maraval so we
[1:18:19] encourage you to make
[1:18:20] uh the effort to be there and then this
[1:18:23] weekend we have service on friday at 5
[1:18:25] 00 pm
[1:18:26] and sunday
[1:18:28] morning at 8 00 am but the waldron and
[1:18:30] his church should be here with us as
[1:18:31] well so we earned expectations with god
[1:18:33] to do
[1:18:34] great things and you know on this
[1:18:37] palm sunday we
[1:18:38] remember when jesus ruled into jerusalem
[1:18:42] the city of peace
[1:18:44] and caused a disturbance
[1:18:48] you know he came against what was
[1:18:49] expected and there was eruption you know
[1:18:51] people woke up that morning thinking it
[1:18:53] was just like any other
[1:18:55] morning and then they had to hear all
[1:18:56] kind of noise
[1:18:58] and i don't know how many people were
[1:18:59] there when it started but the noise just
[1:19:01] started to build and build until it's
[1:19:03] had to pull out palms and
[1:19:05] i don't know if they ever did that
[1:19:06] before so it was not just that jesus
[1:19:08] came into jerusalem but people found
[1:19:09] themselves doing things they had never
[1:19:12] done before
[1:19:14] and i feel that the season we are in
[1:19:15] right now we are doing what we have
[1:19:17] never done before what happened last
[1:19:20] week sunday we never did before what's
[1:19:22] happening today we never did before why
[1:19:25] because jesus is riding into jerusalem
[1:19:28] jesus is coming to see his people he has
[1:19:31] something for you this morning and i
[1:19:34] believe that this service it's a
[1:19:36] deliverance service it's a prayer line
[1:19:38] and i believe the message has already
[1:19:40] gone forth i don't think i have to
[1:19:42] preach anything to you but i just want
[1:19:44] to encourage your fate because i believe
[1:19:46] that god is not going to leave you empty
[1:19:49] today and i believe if you came in here
[1:19:51] this morning with sickness with
[1:19:53] affliction with mind problems you came
[1:19:56] in this morning and you were back
[1:19:57] sitting you are struggling there is no
[1:19:59] reason for you to leave the same way you
[1:20:03] came this morning
[1:20:05] if you came with desperation to receive
[1:20:08] the baptism of the holy ghost there is
[1:20:10] no reason that you cannot leave with the
[1:20:14] baptism of the holy ghost because in
[1:20:17] acts 19 when paul laid hands on them
[1:20:20] they didn't know about the holy ghost
[1:20:22] but when he laid hands on them they were
[1:20:24] filled with the holy ghost so we are on
[1:20:28] the word this morning to lay hands on
[1:20:30] the sick and see them recover we are in
[1:20:33] the word this morning to lay hands on
[1:20:36] those who won the holy ghost and see the
[1:20:38] holy ghost pour out we are on the word
[1:20:40] this morning because the time is here
[1:20:43] for you to receive your promise come the
[1:20:45] church say amen
[1:20:47] so i
[1:20:49] am so excited this morning
[1:20:51] just before we read the scripture let's
[1:20:52] just sing a song and f pass me not
[1:20:55] pass

[1:26:13] amen
[1:26:15] thank you musicians
[1:26:16] can we just go to two portions of
[1:26:18] scripture reading from the book of saint
[1:26:20] luke
[1:26:21] chapter 4
[1:26:22] and reading from verse 14
[1:26:25] and reading from revelation
[1:26:27] chapter 10
[1:26:28] reading one verse there verse 7.
[1:26:44] reading sing luke
[1:26:46] chapter 4 reading verse 14
[1:26:48] and jesus returned in the power of the
[1:26:51] spirit into galilee
[1:26:53] and there went out a fame of him
[1:26:56] through all the region roundabout
[1:26:59] and he taught in their synagogues being
[1:27:01] glorified of all
[1:27:03] and he came to nazareth where he had
[1:27:05] been brought up
[1:27:07] and
[1:27:08] as his custom was he went into the
[1:27:11] synagogue
[1:27:12] on the sabbath day and stood up for to
[1:27:14] read and there was delivered unto him
[1:27:16] the book
[1:27:17] of the prophet isaiah's and when he had
[1:27:19] opened the book he found the place
[1:27:21] where it was written the spirit of the
[1:27:23] lord is upon me
[1:27:25] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:27:27] the gospel to the poor
[1:27:29] he had sent me to heal the broken
[1:27:32] hearted to preach deliverance to the
[1:27:34] captives and recovering of sight of the
[1:27:37] blind to set at liberty them that are
[1:27:40] bruised to preach
[1:27:42] the acceptable year of the lord
[1:27:44] and i want to go on to two more verses
[1:27:46] and he closed the book and he gave it
[1:27:48] again to the minister and sat down and
[1:27:51] the eyes of all them that were in the
[1:27:52] synagogue were fastened
[1:27:55] on him
[1:27:56] and he began to say unto them this day
[1:27:58] is this scripture fulfilled
[1:28:01] in your ears
[1:28:03] and reading from the book of revelation
[1:28:04] chapter 10
[1:28:06] and reading
[1:28:08] 1 verse 4 7
[1:28:10] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:28:13] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:28:15] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:28:18] finished
[1:28:19] as he had declared to his servants
[1:28:22] the prophets may the lord have a
[1:28:24] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:28:26] may be seated for a few minutes
[1:28:29] just to encourage you before the prayer
[1:28:31] line this morning
[1:28:33] so for a title this morning
[1:28:35] the mystery
[1:28:37] of god
[1:28:38] and my inspiration
[1:28:40] this day this scripture
[1:28:44] is fulfilled
[1:28:46] you remember though it would really
[1:28:47] bless me and as he was speaking he was
[1:28:50] speaking about
[1:28:51] christ and it's all about christ and in
[1:28:53] the message with the brandon preach
[1:28:55] christ is the mystery of god revealed he
[1:28:58] said now god had a purpose and a hidden
[1:29:00] mystery and that's what i want to speak
[1:29:02] on to the church this morning the hidden
[1:29:05] mystery of god that he had in his mind
[1:29:08] before the world ever began and how it's
[1:29:11] unfolding itself right down to this
[1:29:14] present hour that we're living then
[1:29:16] you'll understand clearly then
[1:29:18] i believe what is being done
[1:29:21] and but abraham goes on to say now a
[1:29:22] scholar could read the bible the word
[1:29:25] till he can just tie your mind up in any
[1:29:27] way
[1:29:29] if he wants to do it because he is smart
[1:29:31] brilliant get a catholic priest
[1:29:34] or not so much as that as a real good
[1:29:36] trained theologian in the bible brother
[1:29:38] a baptist or a presbyterian or something
[1:29:40] he'll make you think you don't know
[1:29:42] nothing
[1:29:43] when it comes to talk
[1:29:45] see because he has known him in the
[1:29:47] flesh but ibrahim said and he passed his
[1:29:49] bible but the only way you are saved is
[1:29:53] by know him by revelation
[1:29:56] but the random goes on he said i can
[1:29:58] take the presbyterian doctrine and tie
[1:30:01] you pentecostals till you won't know
[1:30:04] i can take the baptist doctrine and show
[1:30:06] you pentecostals a million things you
[1:30:09] know nothing else that's right but
[1:30:11] that's not it
[1:30:12] that's not his church that's not his
[1:30:15] church his church is himself revealed
[1:30:18] and expressed by the word
[1:30:20] now i'm going somewhere
[1:30:22] we're talking about the mystery of god
[1:30:25] now this world is full of mysteries
[1:30:28] this very world itself is a mystery to
[1:30:31] this day scientists are still trying to
[1:30:33] figure out some of the mysteries in this
[1:30:35] world
[1:30:38] everything that cannot be explained is a
[1:30:40] mystery
[1:30:41] but iran said a mystery is something
[1:30:43] that was previously hit but is now
[1:30:46] divinely revealed god was a mystery but
[1:30:49] he wanted to express himself
[1:30:52] he was bigger than everything powerful
[1:30:54] than everything he was everything itself
[1:30:57] but he had to find a way to express the
[1:31:00] magnitude of this mystery
[1:31:03] books can't write enough about it movies
[1:31:06] can be made about it you can build
[1:31:08] buildings because it's too great of a
[1:31:11] [Applause]
[1:31:15] the mystery was so big that god took
[1:31:17] centuries and centuries and piece by
[1:31:20] piece he was trying to get this mystery
[1:31:23] out to people because he didn't want to
[1:31:25] be complicated he didn't want to be
[1:31:28] misunderstood he didn't want to be
[1:31:30] unapproachable he wanted to be
[1:31:32] approached he wanted anybody to talk to
[1:31:35] him but when he was all by himself there
[1:31:37] was nobody to talk to him so he had to
[1:31:40] find a way to take this mystery
[1:31:43] the mystery of god and bring it into
[1:31:46] simplicity are you with me this morning
[1:31:49] [Applause]
[1:31:51] you may be seated
[1:31:53] brother branham said
[1:31:55] when david was living
[1:31:57] and when abraham was living and when
[1:31:59] moses was living but the branham said
[1:32:01] they had no idea
[1:32:03] what they were living out
[1:32:08] let me say that again
[1:32:10] god spoke to moses and moses went and
[1:32:12] did what he did but he still
[1:32:14] had no idea
[1:32:16] what he was doing
[1:32:18] i gotta say that again
[1:32:20] david as a shepherd god spoke to him god
[1:32:24] called him and when david died he died
[1:32:27] not even knowing what he was about
[1:32:31] because brother branham said david was
[1:32:33] just a shadow revealing the mystery so
[1:32:36] david as a shepherd he was not just a
[1:32:39] shepherd but there was a great shepherd
[1:32:41] that was coming and moses and david
[1:32:43] rather was that little mystery being
[1:32:45] spoke about just the shepherd attribute
[1:32:48] of god's nature
[1:32:50] god as a deliverer he couldn't just
[1:32:53] express all of that so he found moses
[1:32:55] and said moses you are going to express
[1:32:58] this mystery of deliverance that i have
[1:33:02] david you are going to express the
[1:33:04] shepherd that i am joshua you're going
[1:33:07] to express the warrior that i am
[1:33:10] somebody preached to me elijah you will
[1:33:13] express the prophet that i am come on
[1:33:15] now
[1:33:18] somebody with me
[1:33:19] daniel you will express the scribe that
[1:33:22] i am
[1:33:23] paul you will express the apostle that i
[1:33:26] am but everyone was expressing a part of
[1:33:30] the mystery of
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:34] god may be seated
[1:33:37] [Applause]
[1:33:38] so i want to say something
[1:33:42] there's a difference
[1:33:44] when it's part of the mystery
[1:33:46] and it's the fullness of the mystery
[1:33:49] so up until the old testament all of the
[1:33:52] scriptures compounded it was just part
[1:33:55] part part but when jesus stepped out
[1:33:58] it was not part of the mystery because
[1:34:00] jesus
[1:34:02] christ was the mystery of god revealed
[1:34:05] in his fullness
[1:34:08] [Applause]
[1:34:10] you may be seated
[1:34:11] [Applause]
[1:34:15] we are going somewhere this morning so
[1:34:18] you are here this morning
[1:34:20] and that's why
[1:34:22] sometimes young people
[1:34:24] sometimes it feels like your life is so
[1:34:26] confusing
[1:34:27] and it's so mysterious because you
[1:34:30] haven't seen the fullness of the mystery
[1:34:32] of who you are because brother branham
[1:34:34] said the mystery of who you are is also
[1:34:36] a secret because you are part of god
[1:34:39] that mystery gene you also carry that
[1:34:42] mystery dream so when you were saved
[1:34:44] that is only part of the mystery when
[1:34:47] you are here this morning that's only
[1:34:48] part of the mystery when you are filled
[1:34:50] with the holy ghost that also is part of
[1:34:53] the mystery
[1:34:54] there's come in a time when you will
[1:34:56] manifest the fullness of the mystery of
[1:34:59] who you are and when people see you it
[1:35:02] will be christ in you the hope of glory
[1:35:05] because christ is the mystery of god
[1:35:07] revealed
[1:35:08] [Applause]
[1:35:12] you may be seated oh somebody say man
[1:35:16] so what are we here to do this morning
[1:35:18] we are here to give you a snapshot into
[1:35:21] who you really are we are here for
[1:35:24] revelation because only revelation could
[1:35:27] show you who you are the pastor cannot
[1:35:29] show you who you are the minister cannot
[1:35:31] show you who you are but if you get a
[1:35:33] revelation because a mystery is
[1:35:36] something that was previously hid but
[1:35:38] now divinely revealed so we are looking
[1:35:42] for divine revelation so that when you
[1:35:45] walk through the prayer line you are
[1:35:47] just not just going through a prayer
[1:35:48] line but you are coming with divine
[1:35:51] revelation that you are an attribute son
[1:35:53] of god attribute daughter of god
[1:35:57] you may be seated
[1:36:00] you might be living in sin
[1:36:02] that's part of the mystery because you
[1:36:04] don't even know fully who you are you're
[1:36:06] not hearing me this morning you might be
[1:36:08] going through depression that's only
[1:36:10] part of the mystery because who you
[1:36:12] really are can be revealed just yet
[1:36:15] because god doesn't even want the devil
[1:36:17] to know who the bride is because he has
[1:36:19] to be a secret so all your situations
[1:36:23] all your past all your mistakes all of
[1:36:26] your ups and downs it's all a great
[1:36:28] mystery that god created to allow you to
[1:36:31] happen something on the inside that
[1:36:34] nobody could see but one of these days
[1:36:37] you will be able to see this day
[1:36:40] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:36:49] [Applause]
[1:36:54] [Applause]
[1:36:56] i'm not going to be much longer with you
[1:37:00] hallelujah
[1:37:02] when you wake up to go to work
[1:37:04] that's a part of the mystery you are
[1:37:06] living out something
[1:37:08] when you pay the bills that's just part
[1:37:10] of the mystery because you gotta have a
[1:37:12] roof over your head you gotta eat but
[1:37:14] that's not who you really are there's a
[1:37:16] mystery behind that flesh man there's a
[1:37:18] mystery behind your mind there's a
[1:37:20] mystery inside of your soul and that's
[1:37:22] why the planet said you are not even the
[1:37:24] believer but the word in you is the
[1:37:26] believer so you didn't come here this
[1:37:28] morning but the seed in you is fighting
[1:37:31] to express himself
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:36] david couldn't explain why he acted that
[1:37:38] way and we preach it a while back and
[1:37:41] after all of his mistakes god still said
[1:37:43] that's a man after my own heart because
[1:37:46] david was expressing attributes that
[1:37:48] were part of god so even in your up and
[1:37:51] down you are expressing attributes that
[1:37:53] are part of god because you are from the
[1:37:55] same genetic structure as your father
[1:37:58] and no devil in hell could stop it
[1:38:01] that's why we can see this morning you
[1:38:02] are going to be healed you are going to
[1:38:04] get the holy ghost you are going to be
[1:38:06] your top 10 you are going to be
[1:38:07] manifested sons of god
[1:38:09] [Applause]
[1:38:14] hallelujah
[1:38:15] i'm not going to be too much longer with
[1:38:17] you
[1:38:18] but the man i said what is it
[1:38:20] the mystery of god
[1:38:22] then he says it here is god in you the
[1:38:24] hope of glory
[1:38:25] shining forth the baptism of the holy
[1:38:28] ghost he said when these things take
[1:38:30] place time shall be no more so when we
[1:38:33] hear about time shall be no more god is
[1:38:36] just waiting for the manifestation of
[1:38:38] the sons of god waiting for this season
[1:38:41] when you will come to full realization
[1:38:43] of who you are
[1:38:45] [Applause]
[1:38:47] now let me drop something in there
[1:38:49] jesus is born he's growing up
[1:38:54] working with his father
[1:38:56] he's with his family they think he's all
[1:38:57] normal
[1:38:59] no wonder when jesus is going around
[1:39:01] they say is this not joseph's son
[1:39:03] because they knew joseph's son
[1:39:05] but what jesus was displaying was a
[1:39:07] little different
[1:39:09] from what joseph's son was
[1:39:11] you don't hear me this morning jesus
[1:39:13] wasn't in church that day for the first
[1:39:15] time he was in the synagogue the bible
[1:39:17] says as was his custom so he was always
[1:39:19] in church but they never really paid
[1:39:21] attention to him because he was just
[1:39:23] walking like everybody is shaking
[1:39:25] everybody's hands and doing everything
[1:39:27] else like everybody else it was his
[1:39:29] custom he was always in church but that
[1:39:32] day was different
[1:39:33] [Applause]
[1:39:35] that day was different and i believe
[1:39:37] this day is different there's somebody
[1:39:40] this morning who's going to get a
[1:39:41] revelation of who god is who they are
[1:39:44] who the devil is and realize that that
[1:39:47] demon of cancer that demon of arthritis
[1:39:50] that demon of female condition that
[1:39:52] demon of high blood pressure low blood
[1:39:54] pressure high sugar low sugar
[1:39:58] mind battle that demon has got to go
[1:40:01] because there is no legal right for that
[1:40:03] demon to be in your body that sin that
[1:40:06] condemnation that lost that unbelief
[1:40:09] that has got to go because you are
[1:40:12] realizing who you are and when the devil
[1:40:14] asks you a question you can look the
[1:40:16] devil in the face and see if this day
[1:40:19] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:40:23] [Applause]
[1:40:25] you may be seated
[1:40:27] hallelujah brother branham said it like
[1:40:29] this he said every scripture in the old
[1:40:32] testament was pointing to jesus christ
[1:40:36] and i'll give you another example when
[1:40:37] isaiah said a virgin shall conceive that
[1:40:40] was scripture that was word it was
[1:40:43] spoken but it had to wait until the body
[1:40:45] came for that scripture to be manifested
[1:40:48] so people could look at it as scripture
[1:40:50] but when god opened the book he wasn't
[1:40:53] seeing scripture he was seeing names
[1:40:57] i don't think you got me
[1:40:59] but the brandon said god is coming for
[1:41:01] the book the book of redemption he said
[1:41:03] it's a book of names
[1:41:04] [Applause]
[1:41:07] we see the book as scripture
[1:41:09] and god is seeing the book as names so
[1:41:11] when isaiah say a virgin shall conceive
[1:41:13] that's in your book in his book he see
[1:41:15] in mary
[1:41:17] it's a book of names and he's coming for
[1:41:19] the book of names
[1:41:21] when the book said a voice of one crying
[1:41:23] in the wilderness that's in your book
[1:41:26] but in his book that's john
[1:41:29] but the branham shared when the bible
[1:41:31] says the people that know their god
[1:41:33] shall do exploits that's in your book
[1:41:36] but in his book he's he and george
[1:41:38] kangali he is seeing joshua he is seeing
[1:41:41] gideon he is seeing your name and he's
[1:41:44] coming for your names
[1:41:52] hallelujah
[1:41:53] hallelujah
[1:41:54] glory to god that's a revelation to you
[1:41:57] church it's not just words it's your
[1:42:00] name the words in the book you are not
[1:42:03] the believer of the word in you as a
[1:42:05] believer you are gonna be filled you are
[1:42:07] gonna receive the holy ghost i don't
[1:42:09] care what the devil tells you he's
[1:42:12] coming for you
[1:42:15] you haven't seen it for a moment
[1:42:17] you may be seeing it for a moment
[1:42:22] hallelujah
[1:42:28] for the backsliders in here this morning
[1:42:31] the book said
[1:42:34] in joel that in the last day i'll poured
[1:42:36] my spirit
[1:42:37] upon all flesh
[1:42:40] that's the words in the book
[1:42:42] peter came and said this is that
[1:42:45] which was spoken by the prophet joel
[1:42:48] so peter what was the words in the book
[1:42:50] i want to make mention of something
[1:42:52] friends
[1:42:53] peter didn't know
[1:42:54] he was the word in the book when peter
[1:42:57] was denying christ he was still
[1:43:00] the words in the book
[1:43:03] you don't hear what i'm saying
[1:43:04] peter said he made mistakes peter said i
[1:43:07] don't know this jesus but jesus wasn't
[1:43:10] looking at that
[1:43:11] it's the word in the book it was going
[1:43:13] to take some time for peter to get a
[1:43:15] revelation a divine revelation of the
[1:43:18] mystery of who he was but what he did
[1:43:22] didn't change his name in the book
[1:43:24] [Applause]
[1:43:27] everybody should be on their feet
[1:43:29] everybody should be shouting your
[1:43:31] mistakes your past your failures what
[1:43:35] they say about you doesn't change the
[1:43:37] words in the book
[1:43:41] hallelujah so when my bible tells me
[1:43:44] there'll be a manifestation of the sons
[1:43:46] of god to god that's not words he is
[1:43:49] seeing you coming out to your condition
[1:43:52] coming out of your depression coming out
[1:43:54] of the world coming out of sin coming
[1:43:56] out of your past and being adopted being
[1:43:59] perfected can the church say man
[1:44:13] hallelujah
[1:44:15] you could be gonna play something softly
[1:44:19] as the deacons we're going to get ready
[1:44:20] for the prayer line
[1:44:24] i don't think not much more needs to be
[1:44:26] said friends
[1:44:27] god is here
[1:44:29] but it depends on yawning
[1:44:32] but the brandon said the right
[1:44:34] mental attitude
[1:44:36] towards any
[1:44:38] divine promise of god
[1:44:40] will bring it to pass
[1:44:42] what's your attitude this morning
[1:44:46] did you just come because it's a service
[1:44:48] or a special service so
[1:44:50] did you come because you realize that
[1:44:52] the needs in your life
[1:44:54] are more than
[1:44:56] you could be
[1:44:58] the needs in your life could only be
[1:45:00] fixed by god himself
[1:45:04] you have to come to that awareness you
[1:45:06] have to come to that conclusion you have
[1:45:08] to come to that position yourself
[1:45:12] i'm not talking to
[1:45:14] groups but over it made it clear it's
[1:45:16] study individual
[1:45:17] so if your brother doesn't want it your
[1:45:20] father doesn't want it your wife doesn't
[1:45:22] want it
[1:45:23] you got to know
[1:45:25] why you are coming into the prayer line
[1:45:28] today
[1:45:30] you have to know what
[1:45:32] your need is you have to know what you
[1:45:33] are struggling with and you have to come
[1:45:36] knowing that god is able
[1:45:39] to heal you
[1:45:41] to deliver you
[1:45:43] he promised to restore you he promised
[1:45:46] good health he said if my people will
[1:45:48] humble themselves and pray
[1:45:51] seek my face and turn from their wicked
[1:45:54] ways they will hear from heaven i will
[1:45:56] heal their land
[1:45:59] that scripture is just as real today as
[1:46:02] when it was first written
[1:46:05] and when god says my people that's words
[1:46:08] to people who read it on the outside but
[1:46:10] to god he is seeing you
[1:46:12] being reconciled to himself part of this
[1:46:16] great mystery of god
[1:46:20] i believe there are sons in here this
[1:46:22] morning there are daughters in here this
[1:46:23] morning you have not been living right
[1:46:25] you come through this line with
[1:46:28] true repentance
[1:46:31] with a contrite heart with a desire to
[1:46:34] not go back and do what you did before
[1:46:37] but the brandon said repentance is not
[1:46:39] just saying i'm sorry it's a turn away
[1:46:41] from
[1:46:42] what you used to do that desire must be
[1:46:46] real
[1:46:47] in your heart
[1:46:49] he promised to put a mark upon all those
[1:46:50] who sigh and cry for the abomination in
[1:46:53] the city
[1:46:57] when you come through this line this
[1:46:58] morning
[1:47:00] god give us a sigh give us a cry
[1:47:05] let it not be just for a show let it not
[1:47:08] just be just for an occasion but let it
[1:47:10] be for a reality god
[1:47:12] i cannot live anymore without a personal
[1:47:16] experience
[1:47:18] with the holy ghost itself
[1:47:20] i don't want to face tonight i don't
[1:47:22] want to face tomorrow i don't want to
[1:47:23] face my boss i don't want to face my job
[1:47:25] i don't want to face my wife i don't
[1:47:27] want to face my husband i don't want to
[1:47:28] face life without a personal
[1:47:31] experience
[1:47:33] with god
[1:47:35] i'm not talking about coming to church
[1:47:37] signing up for church i'm talking about
[1:47:39] being identified by christ in you the
[1:47:42] hope of glory revelation and experience
[1:47:46] and encounter with god
[1:47:48] fire in your soul to burn out
[1:47:52] all the sin to burn out the lust to burn
[1:47:54] out
[1:47:57] david cried out he said lord restore
[1:48:00] unto me
[1:48:01] it's a joy
[1:48:03] of my salvation
[1:48:05] i haven't lost my salvation but god i
[1:48:07] lost the joy
