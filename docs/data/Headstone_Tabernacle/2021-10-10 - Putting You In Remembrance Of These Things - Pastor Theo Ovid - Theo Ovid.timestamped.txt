[29:15] day
[29:16] where there's evil on any hand even on
[29:18] every hand
[29:20] darkness
[29:21] covering the earth
[29:22] so much of disinformation misinformation
[29:25] lies
[29:27] all kind of spiritual deception throwing
[29:29] people off track
[29:31] off the beaten path
[29:33] off of plum off of the word into the old
[29:36] human instagram judging things
[29:38] for their own selves free thinkers lord
[29:41] remnant of that cloth because you have
[29:43] your pattern and you have your mind and
[29:45] we want to connect to that mind this

[30:04] uh ii peter 1
[30:06] i want four to twelve matthew 25 we want
[30:09] to read 14 to 20 to 30.
[30:11] thank you musicians thank you by anthony
[30:14] such an inspiring song service
[30:16] second peter
[30:18] there's an echo we have here
[30:25] [Music]
[30:29] whereby i give them unto us exceeding
[30:31] great
[30:39] rabbi are given unto us exceeding great
[30:41] and precious promises that by these you
[30:44] might be partakers of the divine nature
[30:46] having escaped the corruption
[30:48] that is in the world through lust and
[30:50] besides this giving all diligence up to
[30:52] your feet virtue and devote your
[30:53] knowledge and to knowledge temperance to
[30:55] temperance patience
[30:56] to patient's godliness to godliness
[30:59] brotherly kindness and to broadly
[31:00] kindness charity
[31:02] for if these things be new on a bone
[31:04] they make you that ye shall neither be
[31:06] borrowing unfruitful in the knowledge of
[31:08] our lord jesus christ but he that luck
[31:11] at these things is blind
[31:13] cannot see a file
[31:15] and had forgotten that he was purged
[31:17] from his old sins
[31:19] wherefore the rather brethren given all
[31:21] diligence
[31:22] to make
[31:23] your calling
[31:25] an election sure
[31:26] so if you do these things
[31:28] you shall never fall
[31:30] so what's the opposite of that
[31:32] if you don't do these things
[31:34] you will fall
[31:35] we see therefore so on entrance shall be
[31:37] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[31:39] everlasting kingdom of our lord and
[31:41] savior jesus christ
[31:42] wherefore i will not be negligent
[31:45] to put you always
[31:46] in remembrance of these things though
[31:48] you know them
[31:49] and be established in
[31:51] the present truth
[31:53] second scripture from match chapter 25
[31:56] and
[31:58] this is right after the parable of the
[32:00] virgins
[32:01] jesus speaking for the kingdom of heaven
[32:04] verse 14 matthew 25 verse 14.
[32:07] for the kingdom of heaven is as a man
[32:09] traveling as a far country
[32:11] who called his own servants and
[32:13] delivered unto them his goods
[32:15] and onto one
[32:16] he gave five talents to another two to
[32:19] another one to every man according to
[32:22] his several ability straightway took his
[32:24] journey
[32:25] then he that had received the five
[32:28] talents when traded with the same and
[32:30] made them another five talents and
[32:32] likewise he that had received two he
[32:34] also gained another two but he had
[32:36] received one went and digged in the
[32:38] earth hit the lord's money after a long
[32:41] time the lord of those citizens commit
[32:44] and recognize
[32:46] reconnect with them which is to give
[32:49] them an account right made them account
[32:52] and so he that had received five talents
[32:54] came and brought other five talents in
[32:57] lord dawg has delivered unto me five
[32:59] talents behold i have gained besides
[33:01] them five talents more his lord said
[33:04] unto him well done
[33:06] though good and
[33:07] faithful sivan that has been faithful
[33:09] over a few things and i will make the

[43:21] revelation of the seven thunders as to
[43:23] how to go
[43:24] i don't know so the revelation of the
[43:26] seven thunder is to show us how to go
[43:29] there's after got to be a message to
[43:31] show us how to go
[43:33] not how to state good church members how
[43:36] to go the object of guiding us together
[43:39] is to show us how to go not to make the
[43:42] message

[43:55] i just have to state what i saw my it's
[43:58] the same end
[43:59] but
[44:00] my feet moves because my head says so
[44:02] i can't i can't move like my hand
[44:05] because it's my feet luther can't do the
[44:07] things we did neither kind of meant to
[44:09] this because they had something else the
[44:11] feet moves because the head says so and
[44:13] the head never say no feet you become
[44:15] hand is no each age god has placed these
[44:18] things into his church
[44:21] and pattern it by showing that each
[44:23] individual has to possess these
[44:25] qualities
[44:28] and this being
[44:31] when it is completed
[44:34] is the church of god

[44:47] i know you know it
[44:49] but i come to put you in remembrance of
[44:51] these things
[44:53] so that is not just a board with a
[44:55] pyramid and nice colors in it mocking
[44:57] faith and virtue and knowledge and so
[44:59] that is not for that you know
[45:01] that is an example of what's supposed to
[45:02] be in you
[45:04] because with faith you bust out unbelief
[45:07] but virtue you're gonna destroy weakness
[45:10] with knowledge you're gonna destroy
[45:11] ignorance
[45:13] all glory to god hallelujah
[45:15] with temperance your power over
[45:17] everything around you dear with that

[45:27] and the bone
[45:28] they make you that you better be barren
[45:30] they won't be burned on fruitful
[45:33] if these things
[45:35] be in you
[45:36] so your battle this morning
[45:38] your fight this day is to get these
[45:41] things
[45:42] and recognize these things have to be
[45:44] added
[45:45] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[45:48] these things have to be what
[45:50] you have to want to add those things
[45:52] oh glory to god
[45:54] amen and this being
[45:56] when it's completed
[45:58] is the church i've got noticing over
[45:59] this salmon
[46:01] when you finish preach it
[46:04] this message when if people finish
[46:06] believe it
[46:07] no this being
[46:09] when it's completed
[46:11] watch
[46:12] is what when it's completed is the
[46:15] church of god going to rapture and this
[46:17] being
[46:18] and completed is a servant of god in the
[46:22] church of god that's going to rapture
[46:24] so these virtues here is how to go
[46:31] the amen song in the light you know
[46:33] oh you're taught you're shaking pasta
[46:35] and you're going so
[46:36] no you're going back home same way
[46:38] it's not shaking past the hand the
[46:40] kingdom is preached let me hear it
[46:42] and every man
[46:44] let me hear that again
[46:45] let me hear the louder the kingdom is
[46:47] preaching every man
[46:49] what they do
[46:50] they press
[46:51] they don't sit down and stare depressed
[46:53] they don't be lazy depressed the word
[46:56] peter used was giving all diligence or
[46:59] give the lord a shout
[47:00] make it your business
[47:02] hallelujah giving all diligence apply it
[47:06] press for it
[47:07] wrestle for it push

[47:17] glory
[47:18] hallelujah
[47:21] go to burnham
[47:22] the other night
[47:23] one will not that's all god had to do
[47:26] then nothing was going to stop them
[47:28] talking about the disciples they didn't
[47:30] question and study and hem ho and worry
[47:32] like we do whether they should do this
[47:34] or that they went ahead and done it
[47:36] anyhow
[47:37] just one little nut from god done it
[47:41] how could they know it was not from god
[47:43] question
[47:44] how could they know it was not from god
[47:47] they had all these virtues in here
[47:50] all these qualifications and the first
[47:52] little nut from god compared with the
[47:54] very every bit of this
[47:56] they knowed it was the word of god and
[47:59] where where they went did not worry
[48:00] about nothing else when god spoke they
[48:02] went
[48:04] oh glory to god so how could they know
[48:06] it was the voice of god because these
[48:07] things was in them
[48:09] and these things have to be in you
[48:11] that is why there's a faithful ministry
[48:13] for the perfection of the saints or
[48:14] bringing these virtues into the people
[48:16] first by seed word and then by
[48:18] manifestation because you have to get it
[48:20] yourself

[50:29] to your faith you have to add seven
[50:31] things
[50:32] and the seventh one is the most
[50:33] dangerous one
[50:35] because the seventh one is love
[50:38] and that one can fail
[50:43] paul called charity the bund of
[50:45] perfectness
[50:47] that is the glue that's stitching all

[51:54] the devil was telling them that one of
[51:56] you could cast me out
[51:58] and jesus commissioned the cast my
[51:59] little character
[52:00] and she has no combat among
[52:01] transfiguration no comedy mountain ram
[52:04] said here come jesus he didn't have to
[52:06] say one word he said i'm devastated one
[52:09] more time he said here comes a life
[52:14] here comes a life
[52:16] he didn't even have to say one word
[52:19] and them devils was trembling
[52:21] oh hallelujah praise god they're ready
[52:24] to leave
[52:25] because here come alive that's why he
[52:27] said you'd have to say nothing about it
[52:28] it will speak
[52:30] for itself
[52:32] oh my
[52:34] what is thoughtfulness lazy
[52:36] it means not eat not easily aroused to
[52:39] activity
[52:42] did you
[52:45] not easily aroused to activity
[52:48] a disinclination to work
[52:51] or to take trouble
[52:53] any time your streets start with easy
[52:55] they want to walk down it
[52:57] easy way
[53:00] no traffic might be under wood
[53:02] it must be smooth
[53:06] bubble top is perfect and say there's a
[53:08] line in the street you can't go this
[53:09] morning
[53:11] i might get
[53:12] bite the bed feeling nice
[53:16] oversleeping
[53:18] thoughtful
[53:19] lazy
[53:21] babies he doesn't lack these things as
[53:22] blind
[53:24] can't see your fire off
[53:26] hallelujah and forgotten the sin was
[53:28] perched
[53:29] all glory to god
[53:31] to be stuffful is to be lazy
[53:34] when you're stressful you don't want to
[53:35] do any work you just want to lie around
[53:38] you ever see a it's a slow-moving
[53:41] animal
[53:43] there's a lot that will come from i
[53:45] guess not full
[53:46] but ibrahim said god don't want this to
[53:49] be slutful
[53:50] he want us to have faith
[53:53] oh my hallelujah
[53:55] in the amplified of second peter
[53:58] verse eight it says here for as these
[54:00] qualities are yours
[54:02] and increasingly among in you
[54:05] they will keep you
[54:07] from being idle or unfruitful
[54:10] unto the full personal knowledge of our
[54:13] lord jesus christ the messiah the
[54:14] anointed one
[54:16] but whosoever lacked these qualities is
[54:18] blind
[54:19] and that blind
[54:20] is spiritually short-sighted
[54:24] so he's not blind as to not seeing
[54:27] but blind has to be spiritually
[54:29] short-sighted
[54:30] seeing only what is near to him
[54:34] and has become oblivious to the fact
[54:36] that he was cleansed from his old sin
[54:39] because of this brethren
[54:41] be all the most solitary
[54:43] and eager to make sure
[54:45] which is to make your co-election sure
[54:47] to make sure or to ratify or to
[54:50] strengthen or to make steadfast
[54:53] you're calling an election
[54:56] and if you do this you will never
[54:58] stumble
[54:59] or fall
[55:01] question
[55:03] why would peter say make a call in an
[55:06] election sure
[55:07] you hear we preach you are predestinated
[55:09] you are elected god god happened you say
[55:12] i have not chosen you but
[55:14] you have not chosen me but i have chosen
[55:16] you and yet
[55:18] make your calling
[55:19] an election show
[55:21] it's something that you have to do
[55:23] in other words he said don't take things
[55:24] for granted
[55:26] like the bible said let him that take at
[55:27] this time you take heed lest he fall
[55:29] oh glory to god is that is it a
[55:31] conscience of yourself
[55:33] a watching of your walk is an
[55:35] introspection of your very life
[55:37] oh hallelujah do you want to look within
[55:39] and say you know what where am i at
[55:41] how am i standing where am i standing
[55:43] lord i want to know
[55:45] i want to know from you
[55:47] i don't want the pastor tell me i am
[55:49] standing i want god to tell me i am
[55:51] standing
[55:52] you don't need to hear from the pastor
[55:54] you need to hear from god
[55:55] [Music]
[55:56] oh god you're not a child you're a son
[55:58] and daughter of the living god
[56:01] in the age of maturity
[56:07] so here we come along to this man
[56:09] who had these talents and
[56:12] gave these sevens
[56:14] these talents five produced five
[56:18] the one where two produced two
[56:21] and
[56:22] when the master came back i said is my
[56:24] certain thing well done you upright
[56:27] honorable
[56:28] admirable fit for servant you have been
[56:30] faithful and trustworthy over little
[56:33] a lot of people want big stuff
[56:36] and they can't manage little stuff
[56:38] like you say can't manage that ten
[56:39] dollars you want ten thousand dollars
[56:44] and your attitude towards the little
[56:46] stuff
[56:47] determines how you're going to manage
[56:49] the big stuff
[56:52] i hope one of the preachers in the
[56:54] church could make better sense of that
[56:56] what i just said there
[56:57] they could make more sense than that
[56:58] than me
[57:00] god give you some things into your hand
[57:02] just to see how you deal with it
[57:05] whether it's family friends
[57:07] whatever it is he put things
[57:09] and hannah to you
[57:10] and you just have an attitude towards it
[57:13] if you have a lazy you see if you're
[57:15] lazy about things put it to you you
[57:16] believe about other things
[57:18] you know i was telling somebody you
[57:20] can't lead if you're not prepared to
[57:21] follow
[57:23] you can't be a good leader if you cannot
[57:25] be a good follower
[57:29] you have to learn to follow in order to
[57:31] lead
[57:32] a lot of people want to lead but they
[57:34] don't know how to follow
[57:38] they come like the advice you talk about
[57:39] the man say the man had a revelation he
[57:41] said i'm a man under authority i say to
[57:43] one go
[57:44] he saw jesus
[57:46] under authority
[57:47] because to have authority you ought to
[57:48] be authorized
[57:51] that's how the police of authority the
[57:53] police are authorized by the government
[57:54] so the police could stop cars do that
[57:56] whatever lock up arrest and whatnot
[57:57] because they have the authority they
[57:59] want to authorize and next manpower put
[58:01] in a pull is uniform
[58:04] he do the same thing they arrest him
[58:06] it's not the police uniform is it
[58:07] already here
[58:08] that's where you call impersonation
[58:11] unless you are qualified and and
[58:13] designated to be authorized you can't do
[58:15] it you're not supposed to do it
[58:17] and that's how the bride will be she'll
[58:18] be authorized
[58:20] by god
[58:21] to do the very works of god
[58:24] oh glory to god hallelujah that's why
[58:25] when they challenge jesus he said when
[58:27] you see me you see the father
[58:29] oh glory to god amen
[58:32] so listen listen man said i was afraid
[58:34] this baxter didn't guy here this
[58:35] thoughtful guy here i hear and hit your
[58:37] talent in the ground where you have what
[58:40] is your own so what he was confessing
[58:42] you see what you're giving me i've given
[58:43] you right back
[58:46] and that's what some people have almost
[58:48] for years no change
[58:50] they come to the lord however they are
[58:52] they still are
[58:53] they don't want change they want to be
[58:55] religious
[58:56] they want to come to church they want to
[58:57] hear specials
[58:59] they want to hear good sermons but they
[59:01] don't want to change
[59:03] some people get pain
[59:04] but the pain that god has sent some pain
[59:07] ready come to change here
[59:10] but sometimes people just take pain and
[59:11] just get pain
[59:14] they don't understand it come to change
[59:15] trials come to change to change your
[59:17] desires to change your attitude
[59:20] the trials took job to be a better man
[59:25] he had pain you know he had pressure but
[59:27] it made him a more perfect man
[59:29] a better man
[59:30] oh glory to god hallelujah when you
[59:33] complain oh god why are going through
[59:35] this and why going through that and
[59:36] you're fighting you're fighting you're
[59:37] fighting you're ready yet
[59:41] jesus told peter when you're young you
[59:43] do what you want to do but when you get
[59:44] old somebody gonna lead you to where you
[59:46] don't want to go
[59:48] oh glory to god you're young you're
[59:49] strong but as you get older one day you
[59:51] become vulnerable
[59:53] where you can't go where you want to go
[59:54] you have to be led
[59:56] oh glory to god you better take the
[59:58] leader no from the holy spirit you
[1:00:00] better take the leader now from god
[1:00:02] hallelujah praise god amen
[1:00:05] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:07] so what god is saying here
[1:00:09] then you talk to the guy you should have
[1:00:11] invested my money with the bankers and
[1:00:12] at my coming i would have received what
[1:00:14] was my own with interest
[1:00:17] so take the talent away from him and
[1:00:18] give it to the one who has ten talents
[1:00:21] for everyone who has will more be given
[1:00:24] and he will be furnished richly so that
[1:00:26] he will have an abundance but from the
[1:00:28] one who does not have even what he does
[1:00:30] have will be taken away
[1:00:32] holy the god how long will keep your
[1:00:34] selfishness how long you already see
[1:00:36] about your own how long has he about
[1:00:37] your own family circle are you limited
[1:00:40] just that that is your world you think
[1:00:41] we can live there
[1:00:45] you think god could put us in ministry
[1:00:46] and live just a family circle alone
[1:00:48] when the whole church is a family
[1:00:53] where can't you extend yourself like
[1:00:55] that
[1:00:56] knowing that living for others truly is
[1:00:58] eternal life
[1:00:59] that you could pray for your brothers
[1:01:00] pray for your sister have a concern
[1:01:02] about them lift them up in prayer
[1:01:05] we're not interested in people business
[1:01:06] no yes i've been preaching when somebody
[1:01:08] dog in the dish i don't want to hold on
[1:01:09] in which holy getting this i want you to
[1:01:11] know if you want to get out
[1:01:13] i don't want to know your business
[1:01:15] i want to know do you want to get out of
[1:01:17] that situation or you want to stay there
[1:01:20] are you a pig or sheep in trouble a pig
[1:01:22] will stay in the mud as people cry to
[1:01:24] the ghetto or give the lord some praises
[1:01:28] glory to god hallelujah
[1:01:29] [Applause]
[1:01:31] to everyone
[1:01:33] who has will be given more
[1:01:35] and he will be finished richly so that
[1:01:38] he will have an abundance but from the
[1:01:41] one who does not have even what he does
[1:01:43] have will be taken away
[1:01:45] and throw the good for nothing servant
[1:01:48] into the outer darkness where they will
[1:01:50] be weeping and grinding of teeth
[1:01:53] so god expect us to add to what we have
[1:01:56] been given
[1:01:59] ten percent say amen
[1:02:01] god expect us to add to what we have
[1:02:04] been given
[1:02:05] he don't expect us to stay where we are
[1:02:07] and how we are
[1:02:09] we got to do better
[1:02:10] we got to do more we got to apply
[1:02:13] ourselves with diligence about these
[1:02:15] things of god these things
[1:02:18] glory to god amen hallelujah
[1:02:21] praise the name of the lord
[1:02:26] brother branham
[1:02:28] we need to go back to the power of god
[1:02:31] and something can do the same thing
[1:02:34] today
[1:02:35] although in our numbers
[1:02:38] he said persecution
[1:02:40] always gives strength to the church
[1:02:43] we have had it too easy
[1:02:46] we get thoughtful we get to a place
[1:02:49] where we don't want to move on
[1:02:51] because everything has just been handed
[1:02:53] to us
[1:02:55] it takes sorrow
[1:02:57] and tears
[1:02:58] and sweat
[1:02:59] and prayer
[1:03:01] and faith
[1:03:02] and promise
[1:03:03] to move forward in the power of the holy
[1:03:05] spirit
[1:03:07] you think that word reading again
[1:03:09] do you think i want to hear that again
[1:03:10] or if you're so comfortable you want kfc
[1:03:12] this morning
[1:03:14] oh hallelujah but here would have taken
[1:03:16] it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and
[1:03:20] prayer and faith and promise to move
[1:03:23] forward in the power of the holy spirit
[1:03:25] watch that zeal and power that they had
[1:03:29] in those days had long time vanished
[1:03:31] from all assemblies i'm afraid if the
[1:03:33] windows would be shut out tonight people
[1:03:35] would run every way and never come back
[1:03:37] again
[1:03:38] i guess he was talking about when them
[1:03:40] sisters was praying in the upper room in
[1:03:42] those days and some men was finding it's
[1:03:44] too noisy they call me some buck shots
[1:03:46] and build some bullets and the bullets
[1:03:48] just hit the sisters and fall along on
[1:03:50] the ground never damage them never do
[1:03:51] nothing to them and they continue
[1:03:53] worshiping just as usual and when that
[1:03:55] testimony go out is more people coming
[1:03:58] as they run them here the fire spread in
[1:04:00] here god had them to run them here and
[1:04:02] run them there and the devil didn't know
[1:04:04] that he's spreading fire he helping god
[1:04:07] do the work
[1:04:08] oh god when they push them here and they
[1:04:09] go here a fire built here a fire built
[1:04:12] here oh glory to god that was the old
[1:04:15] time old-fashioned that was the church
[1:04:18] in the early days
[1:04:19] hallelujah saw this trail man praying
[1:04:22] woman praying grandma pain grandpa
[1:04:25] prayed everybody praying everybody on
[1:04:28] the anointing everybody under the
[1:04:30] atmosphere now people sit down and they
[1:04:32] wanna hear talk
[1:04:41] another thing
[1:04:42] it's too bad you know
[1:04:44] to think that those things happening
[1:04:46] like that and yet proves that god that
[1:04:48] was in the old days is still god today
[1:04:51] god will ever remember god reacts and he
[1:04:53] expects his people to keep their vows
[1:04:56] and their promises
[1:04:58] when we get everything so easy
[1:05:00] then we just slip along and the first
[1:05:03] thing you know
[1:05:04] we have gone out from these things
[1:05:06] losing our inheritance
[1:05:09] oh
[1:05:10] you mean you could lose your inheritance
[1:05:13] of course adam lost his
[1:05:15] he lost his right to eternal life he
[1:05:17] lost his inheritance that's what the
[1:05:19] book is all about
[1:05:20] that's what the lamb came to take the
[1:05:22] book that's what jesus died for not to
[1:05:24] be somebody on the cross and he was
[1:05:26] dying across he died to get this book
[1:05:28] this book is what the prophet caught
[1:05:30] when the mighty angel revision 10
[1:05:32] brought down the book this book had your
[1:05:34] name that's why you are sitting
[1:05:35] listening to me this morning because you
[1:05:37] can't come
[1:05:39] [Applause]
[1:05:41] the father to call you
[1:05:44] therefore you are one in a million
[1:05:47] if anybody else in china can rejoice
[1:05:49] nobody has to rejoice like you
[1:05:50] because god called you
[1:05:52] god put your
[1:05:53] your name on his book
[1:05:56] isn't that right
[1:05:58] oh my
[1:05:59] hallelujah
[1:06:01] why jesus
[1:06:03] now
[1:06:05] as in the individual
[1:06:08] these virtues and things
[1:06:11] knowledge
[1:06:12] and temperance is added to our faith
[1:06:15] then
[1:06:17] when the capstone comes prophecy
[1:06:20] then
[1:06:22] when
[1:06:23] the capstone comes
[1:06:26] the holy spirit cements it together
[1:06:29] so it's a building that god is building
[1:06:32] and when you lay bricks in the building
[1:06:33] the man come afterwards and do something
[1:06:35] called plastering
[1:06:37] where they put an and all little blocks
[1:06:40] space between the blocks is sealed up
[1:06:42] you have to plast it cement it
[1:06:45] all right
[1:06:47] there and watch and there is the baptism
[1:06:50] of the holy spirit that is why it is too
[1:06:53] short today
[1:06:54] so you say it's not just faith only of
[1:06:55] virtue or knowledge what not is all of
[1:06:57] that sealed up
[1:07:00] it's the true baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:05] that's ten percent saying amen
[1:07:10] all right remember terence
[1:07:12] now watch now coming down from the holy
[1:07:14] spirit what has come
[1:07:16] then he will give you supernatural faith
[1:07:19] so they come from the world you give
[1:07:20] your heart to jesus they get baptized in
[1:07:22] jesus name but something supernatural
[1:07:24] has to take place
[1:07:26] all right that's the operation not of
[1:07:28] man
[1:07:29] but of god
[1:07:30] so the holy spirit come now and watch he
[1:07:32] said and and and the holy spirit come
[1:07:35] and give you a supernatural faith
[1:07:37] spiritual feet and here at the bottom
[1:07:39] then that spiritual faith recognizes
[1:07:41] only the word
[1:07:42] so baptist careful your methodist fool
[1:07:44] your pentecostal catholic catholic fully
[1:07:46] because your faith the faith that god
[1:07:47] gave you only recognizes his word
[1:07:50] once you take the word and slam it and
[1:07:52] you you say that is mine
[1:07:53] my father talking there i'm hearing from
[1:07:55] mighty orphanage god is talking to me
[1:07:58] that's spiritual faith spiritual defeat
[1:08:00] arrested recognize gossip and old talk
[1:08:02] and misinformation and disinformation
[1:08:04] spiritual faith recognizes just the word
[1:08:07] only the word because god is speaking
[1:08:09] oh glory to god are you with me now
[1:08:12] hallelujah
[1:08:13] watch no matter what anybody else say it
[1:08:16] don't do no good
[1:08:18] they only knows the word if somebody
[1:08:21] said that this america is past that
[1:08:23] faith only knows the word somebody said
[1:08:25] there's no such thing as the baptismal
[1:08:26] holy ghost that friend only knows the
[1:08:28] word that is real spiritual faith
[1:08:31] do you have that
[1:08:34] do you recognize the word
[1:08:36] do you know the word well you have real
[1:08:39] spiritual faith
[1:08:40] now did that say
[1:08:42] you have to add but give the lord some
[1:08:44] praises people
[1:08:46] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:08:48] hallelujah
[1:08:49] when you have the faith that recognizes
[1:08:51] only the word
[1:08:53] not professor so-and-so
[1:08:55] not doctor so and so
[1:08:57] not president and prime minister
[1:08:58] so-and-so when that faith recognized the
[1:09:00] only word then you could begin to add
[1:09:02] now
[1:09:02] to that faith
[1:09:04] number one
[1:09:05] coming down to your mental feet right
[1:09:07] here comes the holy spirit coming down
[1:09:09] into your mental feet
[1:09:11] making it spiritual faith then the
[1:09:14] spiritual faith only recognizes the word
[1:09:17] number two then you have a spiritual now
[1:09:20] you will have the holy spirit and will
[1:09:22] seal all these things into you as the
[1:09:24] holy spirit covers this from your faith
[1:09:27] up to the holy spirit seals you in with
[1:09:30] christ
[1:09:31] oh hallelujah

[1:16:39] sit down a minute
[1:16:42] you know i say you know why they call
[1:16:43] for taxes heracle taxes

[1:19:21] we acquire that
[1:19:22] we choose to walk in that
[1:19:25] like my wife was saying something this
[1:19:26] morning she said you know

[1:20:09] they continue somebody with 10 million
[1:20:12] and when they get they tell me no they
[1:20:14] feel any porous
[1:20:15] because somebody's a billionaire and
[1:20:17] they want to know how they could get up
[1:20:18] there am i trying to finish
[1:20:20] the grave taking them
[1:20:24] they're on the way out now

[1:21:05] the church
[1:21:06] how many children people fighting for
[1:21:07] them is we and we against them like a
[1:21:09] sword fight

[1:21:22] i haven't ministered any of them they
[1:21:24] may have their own battle of the fight
[1:21:25] and every church are three cannot
[1:21:26] believers them doing like only one kind
[1:21:28] of nature they are liars if they said
[1:21:30] one kind the lion and every church had
[1:21:32] three kinds oh god that's the bride

[1:26:15] he also brought the bride to these ages
[1:26:19] so in other words the aegis was living
[1:26:21] out these virtues these revelations
[1:26:24] these seals these mysteries and god
[1:26:27] bring that from the church ages to the
[1:26:29] individual
[1:26:35] that flood it wasn't just flooding
[1:26:37] nor flood and god spoke to knowing
[1:26:39] that was it being baptized with water
[1:26:42] like the mystery behind the flood
[1:26:44] it was justified
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:49] when jesus died his blood fell on the
[1:26:50] earth it was sanctified
[1:26:53] then the prophet came in before the
[1:26:55] fiery day of the lord
[1:26:57] said earth had to get fire baptism
[1:26:59] so it's all perfect
[1:27:02] it's not just flood phenoid or the earth
[1:27:04] was justified
[1:27:06] in the day of noah
[1:27:08] showing that redemption is or work is
[1:27:09] already in effect
[1:27:13] so when god called you and justify you
[1:27:16] redemption work has begun upon you
[1:27:19] then he said grieve not the holy spirit
[1:27:22] of god whether you are sealed until the
[1:27:25] day of your redemption
[1:27:27] so god gave down payment while the rest
[1:27:29] of the revelation
[1:27:31] unfolds
[1:27:32] to bring you into complete redemption
[1:27:35] or to with the redemption of the body
[1:27:37] itself
[1:27:38] so all them sayings have gone on before
[1:27:40] going on the dust of the earth but you
[1:27:42] are one of them who are alive and remain
[1:27:48] to experience complete redemption
[1:27:52] including the change of the body
[1:27:54] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:27:56] praise god praise god
[1:27:58] do you believe that
[1:28:01] and jesus
[1:28:04] had been obedient
[1:28:06] to god
[1:28:07] and then god prayed them positionally
[1:28:09] so god didn't carry favor jesus i said
[1:28:11] you jesus no no no he went through
[1:28:13] though he was son yet he learned
[1:28:16] obedience for the things he suffered he
[1:28:18] had headaches you know that he felt
[1:28:20] tired you know
[1:28:21] you know the storm must come he wasn't
[1:28:22] even waking up he was that talk tired
[1:28:25] that would be talking about he went
[1:28:26] through processes just like what you go
[1:28:28] through he went through that too
[1:28:30] although he was a son it doesn't excuse
[1:28:33] him though he was a son you are son what
[1:28:35] do you want some through the waters some
[1:28:37] should have flood some true great trials
[1:28:40] all through the blood
[1:28:41] oh glory to god he could send you the
[1:28:42] lions then you're still god in the
[1:28:44] lion's den fiery furnace still god of
[1:28:47] the fiery furnace red sea in front of
[1:28:48] you still god of the red sea oh glory to
[1:28:51] god hallelujah watch now when the member
[1:28:54] here we go
[1:28:55] are you ready
[1:28:57] when the member is born by the holy
[1:29:00] ghost
[1:29:00] into the family of god

[1:29:06] him
[1:29:07] that god can see
[1:29:11] that
[1:29:13] god can see
[1:29:16] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[1:29:18] brotherly kindness and godliness in him
[1:29:20] then god seals him
[1:29:22] or places him and that is when you see
[1:29:25] the sons and daughters of god
[1:29:27] so you already see them yet you know
[1:29:28] you've seen men in jackson ty
[1:29:31] you see this is a long dress
[1:29:36] but when you're talking about seeing
[1:29:37] these sons and daughters of god

[1:29:47] before peter had them get deceived and
[1:29:48] jason stop

[1:31:08] you gotta talk to the storm you stomach
[1:31:09] the problem
[1:31:11] when jesus wake up so peace be still
[1:31:14] and whether
[1:31:18] no they had the fear to do that you know
[1:31:20] because peter had afraid to walk on the
[1:31:21] water you are more fit than you think
[1:31:23] you know you sit in a hearing but you
[1:31:25] have to move out one day
[1:31:27] of your comfort zone you have faith you

[1:31:38] past bless our future guide us o lord
[1:31:40] with thy mighty hand she over bless
[1:31:42] these ministers here bless all the laity
[1:31:44] all the visitors be there with us lord
[1:31:46] we are your servants we give ourselves
[1:31:47] holy to you that the power of your
[1:31:49] spirit might have the more the prayer
[1:31:51] menaces in our life
[1:31:52] forgive us and help us raise up mighty
[1:31:55] men raise up mighty wires of faith open
[1:31:57] this year lord that hidden manner that
[1:31:59] rocked me to the rock that we might see
[1:32:00] the program of god prophecy now cap off
[1:32:03] the pyramids of our life
[1:32:07] so you have to have a pyramid in your
[1:32:08] life
[1:32:09] that has to be capped off watch put the
[1:32:12] capstone christ jesus upon each and
[1:32:15] every one of us
[1:32:16] how could christ the capstone come and
[1:32:18] the prayer is not built
[1:32:20] so it has to have a word praise built
[1:32:22] inside of you
[1:32:23] that the caption could come to that
[1:32:25] is that coming to you anyway coming to
[1:32:26] the pyramid in you
[1:32:28] oh praise the name of the lord he says
[1:32:30] may his great magnificent holy blessing
[1:32:32] be upon us all may the fire of the holy
[1:32:34] ghost come upon us may the poor
[1:32:36] resurrection be manifested
[1:32:38] oh my hallelujah he said time shall be
[1:32:42] no more you know the time is over what
[1:32:43] happens could it be so no brethren
[1:32:45] seriously think if it is then the
[1:32:47] pyramid is kept by the seven thunders
[1:32:49] so the capstone is seven thunders so
[1:32:52] that means capstone seventh under
[1:32:54] revelation word seed turns to spirit
[1:32:58] that's christ
[1:33:00] so the capstone the seven thunders is
[1:33:02] jesus christ
[1:33:03] because the capstone which is the
[1:33:05] seventh and this caps the pyramid if
[1:33:07] that be so time runs out
[1:33:10] oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah
[1:33:13] those voices becomes a manifestation
[1:33:16] in your life
[1:33:17] oh bye
[1:33:18] then if that be so much you remember the
[1:33:20] prayer message it's the caption what
[1:33:21] does it do the holy spirit kept off the
[1:33:23] individual and sealed it when we added
[1:33:26] to our faith righteousness godliness so
[1:33:28] forth it kept adding until we got seven
[1:33:30] things and the seventh one was love
[1:33:32] which is god and that is how he makes
[1:33:34] the individual and caps him and see them
[1:33:36] in the holy spirit if that be so he's
[1:33:38] got seven two changes
[1:33:40] because why you look back and see that's
[1:33:41] where they had your seven ages so you
[1:33:43] have seven ages watch and then he has
[1:33:45] been had seven mysteries have been sung
[1:33:47] on the way and they fought for to bring
[1:33:49] back and the heads don't come to cap
[1:33:50] that off does it turn doesn't mean that
[1:33:52] my bedroom of course does it means just
[1:33:54] that what they fought for you come to
[1:33:56] bring back what have we become channels
[1:33:58] of god that you can say there's my
[1:34:00] spirit fallen freely your flesh man is
[1:34:02] out of the way oh glory to god
[1:34:04] hallelujah praise god and the way god is
[1:34:07] expecting us as individuals to grow the
[1:34:09] way he has brought his church in to grow
[1:34:11] every church age amen these fellows

[1:38:08] of you to get up
[1:38:10] from that slutful position
[1:38:12] yeah
[1:38:13] where you just take things for granted

[1:38:18] otherwise i'm not wishing somebody was

[1:38:31] but listen to this
[1:38:32] proverbs 21 25 as we wrap up here the
[1:38:35] desire of this thoughtful killed him
[1:38:38] for his hands refuse to labor
[1:38:41] all your desires
[1:38:43] god i want a house i want that car but
[1:38:45] he ain't working at all
[1:38:48] said killing him
[1:38:50] he had plenty ambition
[1:38:51] but his hands
[1:38:55] snoring
[1:38:56] sleeping away
[1:38:58] i went for verse 24 i went to the field
[1:39:01] of destructful and by the vineyard of a
[1:39:04] man void of understanding and lo it was
[1:39:06] all grown up with torns nettles had
[1:39:08] covered the face thereof and the stone
[1:39:10] wall thereof was broken down then i saw
[1:39:13] and considered it well i looked upon it
[1:39:15] and received instructions yet a little
[1:39:17] sleep a little slumber a little fallen
[1:39:20] of the hands to sleep so shall i poverty
[1:39:22] come as one that travel it and i want as
[1:39:24] an our man
[1:39:25] hebrew six
[1:39:26] for god is not unrighteous to forget
[1:39:28] your work and labor of love
[1:39:30] which you have shown to watch his name
[1:39:33] in that you have ministered to the
[1:39:34] saints have you ministered to the saints
[1:39:37] and do minister and we desire that every
[1:39:41] one of you do show the same diligence to
[1:39:45] the full assurance of hope under the end
[1:39:47] that you be not thoughtful but followers
[1:39:50] of them who through faith and patience
[1:39:52] inherit the promises for when god made
[1:39:55] promise to abraham because he could
[1:39:58] swear by no greater he swayed by himself
[1:40:01] saying surely i will multiply thee so
[1:40:04] after he patiently endured he obtained
[1:40:07] the promise oh my hallelujah aram says
[1:40:11] usually it takes a state of emergency to
[1:40:13] show the church into desperation it's
[1:40:15] too bad it has to do that but the human
[1:40:16] beings are so stressful in their mind it
[1:40:19] takes an emergency and it's true
[1:40:21] sometimes you just need something to
[1:40:22] spark you off
[1:40:24] oh god help us help us as a people oh my
[1:40:27] oh my in a time of death i've heard
[1:40:29] people when they know they were dying
[1:40:31] the things they would keep secret all
[1:40:33] their life in desperation they were
[1:40:34] trying to confess it and try and take
[1:40:36] this and make it right and in
[1:40:37] desperation they ought to have done that
[1:40:39] beforehand not wait for emergency
[1:40:41] desperation when the wife was about to
[1:40:43] die with cancer he knew that god would
[1:40:45] heal her and if god could heal the wife
[1:40:47] god can heal the boy and it shows you
[1:40:49] into desperation when you must come when
[1:40:52] you're desperate then god is going to
[1:40:53] listen to you and if you are just
[1:40:55] thoughtful you don't care whether he
[1:40:56] does or not well that's different see
[1:40:59] and i believe that's the reason we don't
[1:41:01] have desperation is because of lack of
[1:41:03] love you're being gonna play something
[1:41:05] god the love of god i think the love of
[1:41:07] god causes desperation
[1:41:09] oh my hallelujah he said we shall be so
[1:41:12] on fire for god we should be going day
[1:41:14] and night nothing should be able to stop
[1:41:16] us we should be so sweet so pleasant so
[1:41:20] kind so christ like in our lives it
[1:41:22] takes our everyday life friends i know
[1:41:25] you know all these things but i came
[1:41:27] this morning to put you in remembrance
[1:41:29] of these things that you make a call
[1:41:31] election show
[1:41:32] don't let somebody come and take your
[1:41:34] place
[1:41:34] don't lose your position
[1:41:36] in your kingdom the kingdom of god by
[1:41:38] being strutful by being lazy but press
[1:41:41] on just think now everybody has been
[1:41:43] affected in some way the other the
[1:41:45] school children the parents the
[1:41:48] grandparents everybody ever affected the
[1:41:50] workers the businesses across the world
[1:41:52] so in other words the playing field has
[1:41:54] been leveled
[1:41:55] everybody under the same condition and
[1:41:57] yet there's a bride on the deer that are
[1:41:59] going to push and press and strive and
[1:42:03] overcome in the name of jesus christ let
[1:42:06] us stand and just wait for the lord
[1:42:07] father god i thank you today and i pray
[1:42:09] a blessing upon your people father god

[1:42:18] something that has to be in us in them
[1:42:21] in me jesus and we are claiming it we
[1:42:24] are calling for it lord the true baptism
[1:42:26] of the holy ghost where the person of

[2:02:55] you do where would you go how would you
[2:02:58] sing what would you say because he is
[2:03:01] not just next to you but he wants to
[2:03:03] move from
[2:03:04] being conscious of you and you conscious
[2:03:06] of him to him being on the inside of you
[2:03:08] and really seated in that control tower
[2:03:10] of your heart
