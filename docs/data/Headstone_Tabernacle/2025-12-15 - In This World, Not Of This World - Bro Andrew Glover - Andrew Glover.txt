There's one thing we know. There's no body on the earth like the body of Jesus Christ. Amen. Ever joint working together and supplying. And we thank the Lord for it tonight. Just before we open the word, maybe we would just bow our hearts tonight for a word of prayer. And we want to ask the Holy Spirit to just to come by tonight and to pick up the things that he's laid upon our heart and to speak to your heart by it. Heavenly Father, Lord, as these eagles have gathered here once more, we're gathered here under a divine promise. Lord, that you said wherever the carcass is, there the eagles would be gathered together. And Father, we're not gathered here under the expectations of a man or under the expectations of a church. But Father, we've gathered here tonight under spiritual expectations of your revealed word. For Lord, your prophet has taught us that we'll get exactly what we expect. And Father, if we're expecting negative, then that's what we'll get. But Lord, if we're expecting the positive, then all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Now, Father, I pray as we endeavor to look into your word that you would open the windows of heaven tonight. Father, you would fill this place with your anointing, with your mercies and your graces. &gt;&gt; Father, if there would be one here tonight that's growing cold on you, Lord, I pray that there would come such an uncction of the Holy Ghost in their heart. &gt;&gt; Lord, that you would melt away the ice of unbelief. &gt;&gt; You would melt away the ice of doubts, oh God, and it would become like a snowball on the stove, Father. And Lord, that the realities of your presence would become so real to every heart here tonight. Lord, that when we would leave these meetings, we would be able to say, "Did not our hearts burn within us? Not as a man talk to us along the way, but as you talk to us along the way." And Father, we'll be sure to give thee all the praise, all the honor, and all the glory. For it's due thy wonderful name. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. And all the believers says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. If you have your Bibles tonight, we want to go to the book of St. John the 15th chapter. The book of St. John uh the 15th chapter and the 18th verse. St. John chapter 15 and verse number 18. Jesus here speaking. He says, "If the world hates you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you." &gt;&gt; If ye were of the world, the world would love his own. But because you are not of the world, I love one translation to that. You no longer belong to the world. &gt;&gt; Because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. &gt;&gt; Then therefore the world hateth you. &gt;&gt; Also want to look in the book of second Corinthians chapter 6. 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse number 13. 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse number 13. Paul here uh writing he says now for a recompense in the same I speak as unto my children be ye also enlarged. Now be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with bile? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God. &gt;&gt; As God hath said, I will dwell in them, and will walk in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Now, now, where is this going to happen? It's going to happen right here on this earth. Now, wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you. I love verse 18. And will be a father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. Amen. We ask the Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word. As you can have your seat here uh this afternoon, I want you by the help of the Lord to speak to you here uh from these scriptures tonight on this title uh in this world, not of this world. Amen. In this world, not of this world. And you know, I believe that as believers, I can I can say this tonight, maybe cover all of us. I believe that we are growing more weary of this world every day. How many could witness that we're growing more weary of this world every day? I love what the prophet would say. He would say, "I'm so glad that by faith we can see aar the coming of the [singing] Lord Jesus and making preparation to get out of this old world that's going to be burned sometime with unquenchable fire." Now, uh, that that really speaks to my heart that we're not, uh, making preparations to stay in this world. Amen. But we're making preparations to get out of this world. Amen. Because this world is not our home. Amen. Amen. I love what Paul said. He said, "We are pilgrims and strangers." Amen. And we are just passing through. Remember Paul said that Hebrews 11, he said, you know, they that say such things declare plainly, amen, that they seek a country. Amen. Amen. And truly if they had been mindful of that country from which they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country. Amen. That is an heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God. For he hath prepared for them a city. Now I love this. The prophet of God says, "We profess that we are pilgrims and strangers. We are not of this world because we have been called out and we have been separated by the Holy Ghost. Now, amen. We have been called out and separated by the Holy Ghost. And now we walk in a new life. Now, I love this because God's children have always, amen, been considered strangers and pilgrims, amen, upon this earth. Brother Random will identify you like he did Father Abraham. [laughter] He said, "We are like Abraham." Amen. We left the world. Ain't that something? Amen. We're still in the world, but we have left the world. Amen. We are like Abraham. We are looking for a city. Amen. Whose builder and maker is God. And we are believing that some glorious day we shall see that city. How many How many can testify by the grace of God, some glorious day, amen, we shall see that city. He said, "My whole heart's desire," Amen. is to see that glorious city. Amen. Now when I begin to think about that, amen, if God has a prepared city, amen, he then has prepared a people, amen, for that prepared city. I think of how in St. John chapter 17, uh, the Bible speaks of our Lord Jesus who prayed, Amen, the great intercessor who prayed that powerful prayer and he prayed for the church and he prayed that the church would be kept sure, amen, in the world. Isn't that something he prayed? Amen. That while the church was in the world that they would be kept pure in it. He said, "Look, I have given them thy word." &gt;&gt; And the world hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou should take them out of the world, but that thou should escape them from the evil. See, they are not of the world. Now, I don't know how you feel about yourself tonight, but it's pretty powerful. Amen. that when Jesus prayed for you, he did not leave you lesser, but he actually raised you up to himself and said, "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world." He said, "Sanctify them through thy truth." Amen. Thy word is the truth. Amen. As thou hast sent me into the world, even also I have sent them into the world, and for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. Amen. Now, I love what the prophet said. He said, "You are a predestinated seed." Amen. Just like Christ was. Amen. What did Paul say? He said, "What fellowship can light have with darkness? What agreement can he that believeth have with an infidel?" Amen. What part, Amen, hath the righteous with the unrighteous? See, amen. You are in the world, but there is something that has come upon you that has brought a separation and has brought you back to your original identification. Listen, wherever Jesus went, Amen. He brought a separation. He didn't even open his mouth in some places and he brought a separation. Amen. It was because, oh, behind that flesh, he was carrying the genes of another world. And I want to tell you tonight, there is a reason you do not fit in this world. There is a reason that wherever you go, amen, the atmosphere changes around you. Is because you have been called and sanctified by the truth of the hour. Come on, church. You're not carrying the seat of just this world. You are carrying the realities of another world. Oh, let me say it as plain as I know how. I am in this world, but I am of another world. The real me is from another world. Yes, sir. The world I'm living in, you know what they want? They want mixers. The world I'm living in, they want to mix everything together. But the prophet of God said, he said, God wants separators. &gt;&gt; Ain't that something? The world is wanting mixers, but God is wanting separators. See, God is a segregationalist. He said, "Sometimes when you meet God, it makes you act ridiculous to the outside world." He said, "You imagine Abraham went around testifying he was going to have a child." Amen. Now, come on, folks. Where did that come from? It didn't come from the local seminary. It didn't come from the local teacher. Amen. Abraham received a revelation [laughter] from another dimension. Amen. That you're going to have a son. And through the seed of that son, it's going to be the blessing of Abraham. old church. You know what the prophet said? He said Abraham's he said Sarah's milk veins were dried up [laughter] and Abraham's body was as good as dead. He said but he kept on testifying we're going to have that child. We're going to have that child. You know what happened? Brother Ram said he broke into another dimension and he saw Sarah holding the baby while her body was still in a frail condition. Listen, it don't matter what you're looking at right now. If you ever break out of this dimension into a reality where the power of God is, it'll open your eyes to an unseen world. Listen, I'm so tired of this sensebound existence. There is a reality to God. There is a presence of God that can ble &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It can take a believer from one dimension to another. When God calls a man, amen, he expects you to separate yourself from all unbelief. Amen. disassociates yourself, amen, from all things that's ungodly. Now, it's powerful. God is a segregationist, right? Amen. He called Israel out. He called his people out. He said the very word church means called out from that time 1961. God don't want his children mixed up with the world &gt;&gt; or the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Identified masterpiece of God. He is trying to separate his church from the world. But the church wants to go on with the world. But his people is still segregated. Amen. To him, who is he? The word. My who do you say this is? He said, but still a real genuine Christian has to be a segregationist. He is separating himself from the things of the world and everything. Amen. To come into one purpose. And that purpose is Jesus Christ. Amen. Now I want to say this to you and I I want you to always remember this. Okay? Amen. There is a purpose behind a separation that God brings. &gt;&gt; If God bring if God brings the separation, there is a purpose behind that separation. You got sermons like the waters of separation. You got sermons like total separation from unbelief. You know what the prophet of God will show you? He will show you that separation, amen, is going from something unto something. So when you're separated, amen, God is not doing it to be mean to you. He's not doing it to be ugly to you. Amen. But he's bringing you from something into something. Now, Brother shows you the first Adam. He said he went from the word to go with his wife. He said, now this lukewarm carnal believer, he said they go from the word to the church. He said, "But there was a second Adam that was created in the womb of a woman who was born under a Nazerite vow." Listen. And he was separated from the world to the word. The first Adam went from the word to his wife. The lukewarm church member goes from the word to the church. But there was a second Adam. And if there is a second Adam, there's got to be a second Eve. And she's not going to go from this word to the world. She's going to leave the world and she's going to follow the word because she's not come from this world. She has come from another world. My when I think of it, Amen. I can tell you tonight there is a difference. There is a huge difference in being in the world and not of the world. &gt;&gt; I did some research on it. I want to read just a bit to you. It is often used in a religious spiritual context. It speaks of how amen that a person can live within society without being completely shaped or ruled by it. Amen. Now being in the world it means you are physically existing and you are actively participating in daily life. You live in society. You have relationships. You go to work. You experience emotion. You interact with culture and politics and economy. Listen, it's the reality of human life. We're here. We're embodied and affected by our environment. Listen, an example is you go to school, you go to work, or you use technology, you you make money, you deal with social issues. Listen, you are in the world and you are engaging with it. &gt;&gt; You're in the world and you're engaging with it, but you're not of the world. Now that means that you're not adopting the values, the priorities or the mindset of the dominant culture or system. It often implies that you have a resistance and then you are resisting materialism. You are resisting ego. You are resisting superficial success. I love this one. You are resisting moral compromise. Amen. I believe there's a bride on the earth today who is in this world. But see, it's the answer to the prayer of the great intercessor when he said, "Just as you sent me into the world and you sanctified me through the truth, I send them into the world. But father, keep them the same way you kept me. I want to put on notice every devil in hell tonight. There is a bride in the last days who will not bend. She will not pow. She will not compromise. She will not give up, shut up, turn around, or sit down. She knows who she is. She knows where she come from. She knows where she's going. Listen, you can throw everything you want to on us, but you don't have enough to stop us because we come from another world. [cheering] We have come from another world. Amen. I love this. You're not letting the world's standards define you. &gt;&gt; Well, I might as well preach. You're not letting the world's standards define you. Amen. I love this. You are conscience but you're not a conformist. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are you are living with values and you're not just following trends. &gt;&gt; Come on church. You got to know who you are or every wind that blows by will try to identify you. &gt;&gt; You got to know where you stand. You got to know what you believe. &gt;&gt; Now you got to choose. You got to choose purpose over popularity. You got to choose depth over distraction. &gt;&gt; Listen, we are not brought into this world to fit in. &gt;&gt; We were brought here to stand out. You say, "Well, the religion of Jesus Christ is not popular." Brother said, "It never will be popular." He said, "Because no man can serve two masters. Either he will have the one, hate the one, and love the other, or he will hold to the one, and despise the other." Listen what he said. That's what's the matter with people today. They don't want to get shut off from the world. They You want to be in contact with who's going to be the next most popular girl in California or in Hollywood and some of them married six and seven times. And you make that an example. You turn on your television at night to see what Mary or Suzie or every what they say. Amen. And stay home from a prayer meeting and then wondering why you can't hold out. Amen. You're not dead enough. He said you can't be too living at one time. You got to be dead to the world and alive in God or either dead to God and alive to the world. Listen, I believe God separated the church and the world. I believe God did that. Amen. I believe the church, it does not belong in the world and I don't believe the world belongs in the church. Is that okay? The world don't belong in the church and the church don't belong in the world. He said the world is looking for a church. He said, "I believe that God's church is an example to the world that we can live different." Ain't that something? We can act [laughter] different, we can be different. He said, "Now listen, you get right with God and you get acquainted with the heavenly things of that spirit that comes down from heaven." He said, "Now Jesus prayed for his church that they would not be of the world." See, I don't care. You're not an American. You're not a Swedish. You're not a European. you are a Christian. &gt;&gt; Now, come on, folks. Either that's the truth or not, we are a Christian. And if you're a Christian, then your spirit is from affair. And so, it makes you live holy, want to be holy, want to act like Christ, act like God. And your whole desire is on heaven. And I am not a lukewarm, formal, intellectual, dry Christian. I am a son of God. I wasn't born in the smoke. I'll choke to death. I was born in the fire where the Holy Ghost burns. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. Amen. I know what that intellectual devil's trying to do. He's trying to crawl up out of the pits of hell and and paralyze the praise of God's people and paralyze [clears throat] the worship of God's people. [laughter] But there ain't a I might as well preach. With every bit of strength I got in my body, I can't stand that old ungodly, cold, formal devil [laughter] that robs the people of God from enjoying the realities of what they are believing. [cheering] I think it's time to kick that devil out of the house of God and let the power of God return. Let the worship of God return. I'm sorry. I don't worship like the world because I come from another world. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I don't dress like the world. I don't talk like the world. Amen. It's a spiritual dress I'm wearing. It's the wedding garment and it's already been put on you. Then let me say to you tonight, either you're going to accept the revelation or not. You are an oddball. &gt;&gt; Brother Mson, I think any born again Christian is an oddball. Amen to the world because you've been changed. [laughter] Oh, I can't I can't read that quote without faking. I was a little I was a little boy and there was a brother come by the church there where I grew up and he come in there and he got to singing. His name was Brother Morning. He got in there one day and he got to singing. I've been changed. I've been to the river and I've been baptized. I've been changed. And I'll tell you the difference in what a man knows and what a man has experienced. A man knows it can sing about it. But a man that's experienced it, when he begins to talk about it, the same reality that come upon him begins to burn again. Oh, I say to you tonight, it's time to realize that the spirit that's in you has not come from a man. It has not come from a church. It has not come from an apostle. It has come from heaven to identify you as a citizen of a better country. Now, I'm not trying to be mean here, but I got to say what the prophet said. He said, "There's something wrong. You're still too earthbound. You ought to be heavenly minded." And heaven lives by the word. &gt;&gt; Now, what does heaven live by? Heaven lives by the word. Now, I love this. Then, when this separate place is spoke of that you've been called into, Amen. Denomination is not the separate place. Brother B said denomination is a launch. He said it's not a church. Amen. Don't you associate the two together. Listen, the separate place is the word. The church is a bunch of bornagain believers that's in Christ by the Holy Ghost and they are led by the spirit of God. They're not of the world. They are out of the world. They are different from the world. That's what makes them what they are. Then I can say to you tonight as the bride of Christ, you are not going to the judgment. You have already been judged &gt;&gt; by the word. The word is the judge. It don't matter what I think or what anybody else thinks. The word is still the red light. The word is still the absolute. The word is still the one that determines your going or your staying. He said when we are judged by the word which is Christ, he said we are chassened that we should not be condemned with the world. My when when when we begin to think about this, I think of how Amen. that we are we're all the time Amen. referring to the world, aren't we? Amen. They went back to the world or they never left the world or they're still in the world. We're all the time referring to the world. But but but I want to say this to you. Amen. What is the world? &gt;&gt; Brother Ram asked that question. He says, "What is the world?" Now, what I love about it is when he asked that question, he automatically connects that question to St. John the [music] 14th chapter and the 19th verse. And he says, "Now, yet a little while and the world will see me no more, &gt;&gt; but ye shall see me because I live ye shall live also." Now, watch this. He says what is the world? It's the Greek word cosmos which means the world order. He says I will be in you. I will be with you even in you until the end of the world. Now come on saints. Amen. I will be in you. Amen. Even in you until the end of the world. Then I can tell you tonight that that there's another world that is coming to this world. And that's what separated you from the world that you're in. He said, "Now what was it?" The people who could only see with their natural sight, could understand, with their natural understanding, with their mental thinking. He said, "That is the end of Jesus forever for them until the judgment." You say, "Preacher, I ain't got nothing to be shouting about." Yes, you do. Amen. that God has allowed you, amen, to live in a world where the people have been blinded by the God of this evil age and they will not see God &gt;&gt; again until the judgment. Amen. I want to say something to you. He said, "Then what is the world?" He said, "It's the worldly minded." See? Amen. Now, who are the worldly minded people? I just got to say what Brother Bam said. He said, "It's the church members. The worldlyminded people, he says, "The church members will see me no more." Did they see him in that day? No sir. They never seen him in the light of who he was. They seen his corporal body because they had a sense of sight. those who could see. He said, "Now listen, they saw him in the light that he was a human being, but they did not see him in the light of the son of God." Cuz they said he was a devil. They said he was be elim. They said he was a fortune teller. He said, "Now what does that world represent? What is the world order?" He said, "Here it is. It's the regular routine." So the worldlyminded people are the church members who are a part of the world order. And what is the world order? It's the regular routine. Now you know what he says that is? He says go to church on Sunday, go to work on Monday, and go back next Sunday. That's the world order. The world order is people who go to church on Sunday, go to work on Monday, go back to church on Sunday. He said they shall see me no more. You say, "See me?" Yes, sir. Well, Brother Bam, I've got eyesight 2020. But you're still blind. They will see me no more. Look here. That's But listen, but there was another group of people. Amen. There was a world that was under a world order that will not [laughter] see him no more. He said, "But yet ye, ye shall see me." He said, "That's the elected church." &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. The elected church are the ones who will see him. If you were of the world, the world would love his own. But because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you. I have electtos. I have elected you. I have picked you. I have chosen you out of the world. Look at this word chosen. It is of God choosing whom he judged fit to receive his favors. Glory. When God chose you, he judged you. He He judged you qualified to receive his favors. and he's separated from the rest of mankind to be a peculiar to his own to be attended continually by his gracious oversight. Oh, I want to tell you tonight, Amen, the president of the United States is not, Amen, the safest man on the earth. Amen. Your government is not the safest people on the earth, but the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. Hey. Well, glory to God. Come on, church. I'm not talking about secret service. I'm talking about God's service. I'm talking about election. I'm talking about grace. I'm talking about God chose you and he's watching over you. Oh, [screaming] you ought to rejoice on that. That the God of heaven has chose you. And because God chose you, this world hates you. Because God chose you, this world hates you. Man's choice is a lot different from God's choice. &gt;&gt; You know that. Brother said this. He said, "Sometimes your choice is not God's choice." &gt;&gt; You know what else he said? He said, "Sometimes the church's choice is not God's choice. But if God elected you to be a Christian, you would not be a Christian if he hadn't. [laughter] It's God's choice, not yours." &gt;&gt; Well, can I get it out there? You didn't claim this message. This message claimed you. You didn't claim this grace. This grace claimed you. You did not claim this revelation. This revelation claimed you. No man seeks God at any time. It wasn't you looking for God. It wasn't you calling for God. It was God calling for you. Come on, church. I will go and prepare a place and I will return again and will receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also. &gt;&gt; Do you see it? In this world of spiritual blindness we were elected to see. &gt;&gt; Now that ought to make you put your shouting shoes on. In this world of blindness we were elected to see. You say me? Yes you. Brother said he only appears to those who believe him and love him and was elected to see him. If you have seen him in the appearing of his presence in this hour, you are the most blessed person on the island of Trinidad tonight to know that God has elected you out of the billions of people upon the face of the earth to receive him and his visitation in the generation in the hour that you're living in. &gt;&gt; Oh, you say I'm going to shout. Listen, [laughter] if you don't like my shouting, I'm sorry. I got something to shout about. If you don't like the fact I dance a little bit, I got something to dance about. I was lost. I was undone. I was on my way to hell. But God sent a message and opened my eyes and let me see him. I didn't see the pope. I didn't see a bishop. I saw Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. I see him in nature. I see him in his son. I see him in his people. I see him in his word. [cheering] Oh, I didn't see what the world sees. I see what I've been elected to see. &gt;&gt; Why didn't those Egyptians see Moses? &gt;&gt; Come on. Why didn't those Egyptians see Moses? They weren't elected. He said, "That's the reason they didn't see it." But why did those Israelites see it? &gt;&gt; They were elected to see it. &gt;&gt; And today, God is calling his elected, &gt;&gt; the spiritual seed of Abraham &gt;&gt; by the faith that he had in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you something? Tonight, Abraham's faith is not dead, saints. Brother, brother Andrew, I can stand here tonight and say it. The faith of Abraham is not dead. You say, "Preacher, how can you say that? Abraham is not in this building, but his faith is Abraham is not here in a physical body, but the same faith that was in him is in every believer by the baptism of the Holy Ghost." I'm not talking about a bunch of religion. I'm talking about the revelation that has struck this generation. It's not a bunch of mysteries. It's not a bunch of, well, you got to go dig around and find it for yourself. This is a thus sayaith the Lord revelation. This is a clear revelation. It's an identifying revelation identifying you for the rapture. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Don't you see the spiritual scene? Now, now &gt;&gt; this is brother Brandham &gt;&gt; that don't see the intellectual church. &gt;&gt; It sees the word. &gt;&gt; Now, I believe in teaching. &gt;&gt; I believe in teaching. &gt;&gt; But I believe in inspired teaching. &gt;&gt; Can I preach a little bit? I mean, I tell you, anything I can't take is somebody knocking the move of God. &gt;&gt; When a man is preaching this message, there's no music playing. There's nobody rah. Come on. Come on. And it brings a stimulation of revelation in the church. And then somebody get up and start knocking it and calling it a bunch of emotion and a bunch of bubble dancing. Now, I might as well just say it. You know, you know what we've really done around here around the message rather is we've taken every six-foot icicle that couldn't preach and called him a teacher. &gt;&gt; And they've taught the Holy Ghost right out of the church. They've taught the realities of God right out of the church. They've taught the power of God right out of the church. But if a man is a Holy Ghost called teacher, he will not be teaching against what God has restored under the voice of a seventh angel. He will be saying only what the prophet has already said. [screaming] I might as well just preach I'm here. I might as well preach I'm here. Amen. Do you realize there's two scriptures in the Bible? It's Matthew 28:19 and it's Acts the 2 chapter. You know what Matthew 28 says? Go ye into all the world. Baptize in the name of the Father, of the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. In Acts 2:38, it says, "Repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." Now, do you realize what men have done? There were no contradiction between those two scriptures until a man got involved. &gt;&gt; Oh, God, I might as well shall preach. Until a man got involved and he be to pitch or put Matthew against Acts and say, "What are you going to believe?" Amen. Now, let me bring it right on down to our message. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? We got quotes like this. I would rather have a little wildfire than no fire at all. &gt;&gt; We got quotes that says anything without emotion is dead. Come on. Amen. We got quotes like this. If you ain't what you got ain't got some emotion in it, it needs to be buried. &gt;&gt; Right. And then we got quotes like this that Mary received the Holy Ghost. Amen. without s or she brought the word without sensation. Right? Amen. We got quotes like this. We need to get out of order long enough to get say are are you seeing what I'm saying? And there was no contradiction between the quotes until a man be to try to bring a separation. And they begin to say, "Well, I'm on the emotional side and you're on the word side." Amen. That's the dumbest thing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, brother. My country ways are coming out. Amen. That's the silliest thing I've ever heard. Amen. Are you on the fire side or you on the word side? Come on. You can't even have a service. Without the spirit of God and the word of God, [cheering] &gt;&gt; when in God's name did we start separating, Amen. the spirit of God from the word of God. I'll tell you when we done it is when we replace the leadership [laughter] of the seventh angel with the ideas of a man. But I stand here tonight as an anointed Josiah. I say tear down every idol and lift up the message again until the power of the reality begins to burn in every young person in every heart. Set us on fire, Lord. Set us on fire. [screaming] Not with a bunch of wildfire, with the Holy Ghost and fire. [cheering] I'm sorry. I'm just preaching. No, you sh &gt;&gt; I'm not confused. I know what I believe. &gt;&gt; I'm not a fanatic. I'm a [screaming] Holy Ghost filled fire baptized Malachi for following dinner of fire following son of the living God. And there ain't no devil going to set me up. And there ain't no devil going to reidentify me. I know in whom I have believed. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You want some emotion? Preach the message. &gt;&gt; Now I'm I'm moving on. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of that devil. [cheering] Tired of that devil that runs around with a hand with a with a printer in his hand just printing out labels. &gt;&gt; Just a just a printer just printing out labels. Oh, well, he's this and she's that, he's this and she &gt;&gt; You ain't got no right to identify me. &gt;&gt; The word is my identification. [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, he read that quote, so he must be that. He read that quote, he must be that. I read it because I'm a message believer. &gt;&gt; I remember I I don't know. I'm I'm I'm running out of time, but I'm here. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brothers. I I was over I was over in a in a meeting one time and and there was a lady and man, every time you was preaching the word, man, she get happy. She'd jump up and she'd run up to the front of the church and shake your hand. It might be dead quiet in there and all of a sudden you just preaching the message and the power of God and that woman stand up on the front row and she say, "Amen." [screaming] &gt;&gt; And then she had a little walk, brother. She walk up there and shake your hand. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So I was with a guy. He got to talk to me about that. He said, "You know what?" He said, "That gets on my nerves." &gt;&gt; I said, "Really?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "She's just an emotionalist." &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, have have you ever went and talked to her? Well, no. I said, "Have you ever talked to her and realized that she used to not be like that? &gt;&gt; But one day she was in a car wreck and she almost lost her life and God raised her up off of the sick bed and give her back her life. And every time she hears the word, she wants to take that chance to bless the God of Abraham who restored unto her her life." Come on. I think it's time as believers we get back to identifying ourselves by the message and not what people think about us and what people say about us. [cheering] Well, somebody shout hallelujah. I am a believer because I met God. I met the God of this message. And the revelation I begin to feed on it begin to bring a separation. Now, I'm sorry. I got to move on. The prophet of God said this. He said, "What's happening?" He said, "It's being called from those big denominations into the presence of Jesus Christ." He said, "Now remember this election, this election that you've got is coming now is just not going to another nation. &gt;&gt; It's going to glory &gt;&gt; where their names are wrote on the lamb's book of life." Now, their names were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; and they're in there and they are in there elected. &gt;&gt; And when what light flashes over them like that, then denominational walls drop away from them and here they come. See, how could a thorn wake up and be official when it was predestinated to be that? How could the elected keep from seeing it? They were elected to see it. &gt;&gt; Their names were not on a church recorder, but on the lamb's book of life. [applause] They were elected to see the revelation of the age. Now, I want to say this. It's the revelation of predestination and election. Predestination. We are predestinated unto adoption. Now I want to say this to you. Predestination leads unto an adoption which is an authority. Now I want to bring it on down to you. The leotans which are Pentecostals, they cannot see it. But only the bride which has the entire Bible seed swed into her heart will be able to see the revelation. &gt;&gt; Now I pray I've got some liberty here tonight. I want to bring it on down to you. We are in Leosa, &gt;&gt; but we are not of [applause] &gt;&gt; Come on. You want to preach a bride a just preach it the way William Brandham did. We are in Leotaa. We are not of [screaming] Leotaa. Why? We are the bride. Come on church. Leotaa is not our identification. &gt;&gt; Leotaa is not my identification. [laughter] I'm going to go to the airport in the morning and fly home. Okay. I got a passport. Amen. I think my I I've got a passport. And if I take that passport up there and I hand it, [laughter] amen, to the to the to the to the immigration officer. Now listen, what's on that passport has got to match what's standing in flesh before him. &gt;&gt; Now, no matter how much me and brother Theo look alike, [laughter] &gt;&gt; I can't take his passport up there. Now, now come on, folks. If I hand them a passport and the passport says 63, that's what's got to be standing in front of them. &gt;&gt; If I hand them the passport and it says 200 and none of your business pounds, that's what's got to be on the passport. Whatever. Oh, God. Whatever is on the passport has what's got to be in flesh. [cheering] Whatever is on the passport has got to be manifested in the flesh. The passport and the flesh has got to say the same thing. Or I hear brother Brandham say it's so beautiful. He said the spirit, the prophet and the bride will be all saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said. Well, glory to God that I can say it tonight without any hesitation. Lelay Osea is not our identification. I'm not blind. [laughter] I'm not wretched. I'm not miserable. I'm not poor. I'm not wondering who I am. [screaming] I know who I am. [applause and cheering] They told me I was at home to preach. So, I'm just going to preach. &gt;&gt; Brother Ben said the Pentecostals is the way ought to see it. &gt;&gt; They're rich &gt;&gt; and have need of nothing. &gt;&gt; Turn on the light. 1964. He says the &gt;&gt; pick that devil up. It's not a good time to push. We get back to saying what Brother Brandham said and quit saying what somebody said about what he said, we'd be a lot better off. Leoa is the Pentecostal organization which all goes right straight in to the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; That's not who I am. This naked stripped off bunch of layout of sins worshiping the God of this world through ethics, education, and shrewdness. That's not who I am. So if I'm here, I've got to be a part of something. Oh, there was another voice and it said this. Babylon is fallen, but come out of [screaming] her. Come out of her, my people. Now, you know, Brother Bam said it. He said, "I'm calling you out." He said, "But if I'm taking you out, where am I going to take you?" He said, "I can't bring you into tabernacle." He said, "It's as much a mess as the rest of them." He said, "I can't take you to the Baptist. I can't take you to the Pentecostal." He said, "Oh, there is a place I can take you. in Christ who is the word. Well, take that devil. I am in Christ and there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. Where is that spirit coming from? Another world come out of her is the message of the hour. God sent a messenger and a messenger was sent from heaven to call God's people out of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Now, can you take a prophet's words? &gt;&gt; I know you can't. &gt;&gt; May they realize that this is the calling out of the bride. &gt;&gt; It's not a Pentecostal message. &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal message was to restore the gifts back in the church. But this is the calling forth of the bride. &gt;&gt; Somebody say another message &gt;&gt; that was to come just before Sodom was to be burned. &gt;&gt; Now he says this faith I believe this because it's revealed by your spirit through the word of God and has been vindicated and made manifest to the whole world. I I think it's amazing that people all of a sudden have got a problem with the picture of the cloud &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden it's wrong and it's false and and this this this theorist and this scientist. Amen. Oh god, I got to it's my first trip here. I got to behave myself. &gt;&gt; I'm trying. &gt;&gt; Hogwash &gt;&gt; nonsense. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said that light that was in the cloud is what brought you the revelation. Who is this Melzdc? Now look here. So then what you're receiving is not the mind of a man. &gt;&gt; You're receiving the unfailing body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Now look here then. The leotans are after the world order. &gt;&gt; I had a reason I wanted you to sing that song. The leotans are after the world order. Now I want you to hear a prophet's words. He says this the end of the leotans &gt;&gt; they went back to works again or Pentecostal denomination and went back to the denomination in the for seal. He says the last plague that hits the Pentecostal church is spiritual death. &gt;&gt; She is dead. That's in the name of the Lord. She is spiritually dead. He gave her a place to repent. She rejected it. Now she is dead. Will you take what he said? She will never rise again. &gt;&gt; The end of the layout of sins. She is dead. She will never rise again. He says an invisible union. He says God let it die. &gt;&gt; But folks, I'm sorry. I can't find myself in there. &gt;&gt; So he separated us. &gt;&gt; He called us out from that. So, what's he going to take us to? &gt;&gt; Oh, he says this. Now, turn in your Bibles to Hebrews 7. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; There was a world order. [clears throat] He says, "But listen, there's another order. &gt;&gt; The Leoans have an end. They're dead. She'll never rise again. But there's another order." And here's what it says. without father, without mother. Melzdc, without descent, having neither beginning of days. Are you all ready for this? Nor end of life. &gt;&gt; You can't die no more than God can. &gt;&gt; Oh [screaming] yeah, they made buried this body in the ground. They only planted it for the resurrection. Are you hearing me? Because on the inside of this 16 element body, I am carrying the revelation of Melzdc. [laughter] And the order of Melzdc is the order of which I'm a part of. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say something to you tonight. Okay? &gt;&gt; The end of Leos &gt;&gt; shall never rise again. Brother, brother Theo, he says, "But Melzdc had no end of life." &gt;&gt; I got to looking at this word end. You know what it means? It means the end. &gt;&gt; The last that by which a thing is finished, &gt;&gt; it's Oh, God. &gt;&gt; It's closed. &gt;&gt; It's done. &gt;&gt; It's ended. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, I got a question for you, okay? Are you awake? &gt;&gt; How many things has you have you been through and the devil said, "This is your end." &gt;&gt; He has said, "This is your end. &gt;&gt; You're finished. &gt;&gt; You're done for. You're over. You'll never rise again." But you're still here. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. The devil has thrown everything he's got at you and you're still standing. &gt;&gt; Can I just go ahead and tell you it's because the devil don't have enough. &gt;&gt; He don't have enough to end this pride. He don't have enough to hold this bride down. She is not after the order of Leosa. She is after the order of Melzdc. My when I think of this tonight, he said to that same Melzdc is right here alive tonight. He said he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He was made flesh. He would repeat again. I want to say something to you tonight. And and I'm I'm hurrying, but I want to deliver my heart to you. &gt;&gt; You're in this age of leosia. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you're not of it. &gt;&gt; There's a reason you're different. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham introduces us to this idea. He says, "There's two worlds." &gt;&gt; Is this okay? &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, it's a dual condition." &gt;&gt; All right. All right. &gt;&gt; He'll say it like this. You're working in two worlds. &gt;&gt; I love these quotes. You don't realize, friend, what a strain. You're living in two worlds at the same time. &gt;&gt; Another place. It's another world. You live in two worlds. There's no need of trying to explain it because you just can't explain him. You just have to believe it. Another one. Why? I'm a holy roller. Fitting title, right? You're in a dimension that the world knows nothing about. &gt;&gt; At thy word. 54. In other words, a vision causes you to be in two worlds at the same time. Jesus hold the authority of the word. He said you are living in two worlds. This is my favorite one, brother Isaac. He says you are here and then you're in another world. Are you all ready for this? And you can't help it. You're here in this world, but you're in another world, and you can't help it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I say it like this. He says, "Jesus is here. His spirit is here. Now, what just happened? I went into another world." Are you ready for this? It's an unseen world. [applause and cheering] It's an unseen world. We become so conscious of looking at one another like this. But there's an unseen world and it's greater than anything you can see. &gt;&gt; Come on church. What other revelation outside of the revelation of Melzdc unlocked to the church that there's another dimension and you're a part of that dimension. You have a dual citizenship. You're in a dual condition. You're in two [screaming] worlds at the same time. [cheering] There is no other message. There is no other revelation, brother Paul. There is no other word that can transform this bride while she's still living into another dimension to receive a grace from God but the message of the hour. Oh, I feel my strength coming on right now. I feel my strength coming on right now. I want to tell every devil in hell, I'm stronger than I've ever been before. My flesh might be weak. My spirit might be low, but I am in contact by the revelation of another world. And it's more real than anything I can see here. It's more valuable than anything I have here. It's more pure than anything Leotaa can produce. I'm not a crazy man. We're bumping into something right now. It's another dimension. &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural world. &gt;&gt; Now, can I say what a prophet said? &gt;&gt; He said, "The angels of God are gathered here." &gt;&gt; How many knows the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophets? &gt;&gt; The angels of God are here. &gt;&gt; Christ is here. Can I just say it? &gt;&gt; You've got angelic security. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You are protected by angels. Come on, folks. I'm not a fanatic. I'm a message believer. You know what the prophet said? He said, "There's an angel to bring you to your seat." Glory to God. He said, "You're bumping into something." He said, "What are you feeling? You're feeling angels." Listen. The angels of God have been dispatched into this building tonight to minister to those who are the heirs of salvation. I say, "House of hell, turn loose in the name of Jesus Christ. There is more with us than there is with them." [cheering] Hallelujah. There is more with us than there is with them. There is a host of angelic beings that have been brought into this building. Not by the music, not by singing, but by the preaching of the message of the hour. [applause] I'm not a crazy man. There's an angel influencing this meeting. You know what angel's influencing this meeting? Is the angel of the Lord. Come on, church. The angel of the Lord is influencing this meeting. You say, "Preacher, you lost your mind." Wherever this message is preached, the angel of the Lord, direct quote, accompanies the message always. Come on, church. Feast of trumpets. I'm just preaching the message to you. In the Feast of Trumpets, you know what a prophet said? You know what he said in Feast of Trumpets? He said, "Out of the river Euphrates," he said, "Come them ecumenical demon spirits." Right? He said there were 200,000 200,000,000 demons that was loosed against the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But then I read over in the book of Hebrews. You know what Paul said? He said, "We have come to Mount Zion." &gt;&gt; What is Zion? She's a type of the bride. We have come to Mount Zion. And you know what he said, brother? He said, "Where the angels are innumerable. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; The angels of God are innumerable. Come on, church. I'm in the message of the hour. Can I say it to you? We can count the demons, but we can't number the angels. We can count the demons, but we cannot number the angels. Oh, I want to say it, brother, with all my heart. There is more with us than there is with them. God is sent a prophet in this generation to open the eyes of the bride of Christ. It's not coming. It's all around you. [cheering] I'm talking about two worlds. I'm talking about where things that are seen are temporary. [cheering] Come on, church. The things that are seen are temporary. [laughter] But the things which are not seen, those things are eternal. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say this right now. I'm not trying to be a prophet. I'm not the prophet. And neither am I the son of a prophet. But I got a family member back home suffering with something in their body. I'll say this right now. There is more with you than there is with that devil that's afflicting your body. I'll say this right now. Amen. You may see the symptoms, but just remember they're temporary. I'm not a crazy man. I know what demon of fear begins to follow people when little things begin to show up on their body. But we are not here as a bunch of Pentecostal babies trying to work up an authority to overcome the devil. We are the bride of Jesus Christ. And you can see the symptoms, but they're temporary. I'm not a crazy man. I'm talking about unseen [laughter] and seen. &gt;&gt; You know what a prophet said? He said, "You got the Holy Ghost. You got something in here to believe with." &gt;&gt; When the Holy Spirit comes in the heart, he says, "Quickly, he becomes a I'm sorry, I broke into another dimension right now. I'm trying to keep myself together." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When a man [screaming] realizes he's a son of God and the revelation strikes his heart, it's not a bunch of emotion. It's authority. [screaming] [cheering] Oh, I know I'm a twofold being. I'm on this earth to die, but I'm also one of heaven to live. &gt;&gt; Listen what the prophet said. He said, "When you receive the revelation that Jesus Christ died for your sickness, it's that very hour your healing has come." When you receive from heaven that Jesus died for your sins and you have accepted it, you don't need any prayer for you. Then you've already accepted it. It's settled. &gt;&gt; Now, we can preach the word. We can explain the word. But you [laughter] have to receive the word. Are y'all ready for this? He said, "That's what sets it a fire, brother. When you receive it, when you receive the revelation, I got a question for y'all. What good is a revelation that you can't understand?" &gt;&gt; Come on, church. What good is a revelation when your babies are sick that you can't understand how to pray for them? &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just going to preach. I'm here. I think it's time to kick this illegalistic devil of works out of the house of God. And if I can pray hard enough, and if I can get good enough, then maybe God might do something for me. It's already done. [cheering] It's already done. You're already saved. I'm already healed. I've already got the Holy Ghost. My name is already on the lambs. Whom the son died for, he justified. And who he testified, he sanctified. Who he sanctified, he glorified. And read the rest of [laughter] it and has already perfected. There is a people who is not perfect by your church attendance. You are not perfected by your ability to memorize or quote. You are perfected by the word and that bleeding bloody word. &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, what's happening?" I'll tell you what's happening. revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I defy that demon of anxiety right now. &gt;&gt; I defy that demon of depression right now. &gt;&gt; I defy it in the name of Jesus. Who the son has made free is free indeed. You want you want to you want to you want to change something? Let revelation come. &gt;&gt; Let revelation come. &gt;&gt; You you know what a prophet said? Is this okay? You know what a prophet said? He said, "When you receive the revelation," he said, "then something slips out of the unseen world and comes rolling down to a mystic channel somewhere into your soul." And your soul says, "Now [screaming] I see it." Your eyes brighten. Your lips that hung down straighten up and smile. Every muscle in your body. Well, this is a bad night if you don't believe in praising God. Hallelujah. Every muscle in your body, it seems to rejoice. You know why? You know why? Because something is going to happen when your spirit becomes so hard to that outside world. When your intellectual faith comes down into the heart and becomes so charged. I'll tell you what's happening right now. I'm going to say it to you very plainly. It's a dangerous spot for the devil &gt;&gt; in an atmosphere like this. It's a dangerous spot for the devil because there is a gusher of spiritual revelation that's rolling down through the mystic channel from an unseen world and it's striking you and it's striking you and it's striking you. What is it doing? It's charging you. Hallelujah. It's charging you and every word of God is becoming a positive truth. Will somebody give him praise in the house of God? Every word, every promise, every line, every chart, [music] every title is becoming a positive revelation. the prince of the power of the air who is Satan. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said he's right here to get you fumbled up in your mind. He said, "But listen, [snorts] &gt;&gt; can you all give me that picture of the pillar of fire over brother Ramy's head if you have it quickly?" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm not going to hold you much longer, but can I finish my thought? &gt;&gt; Will you hear me tonight? &gt;&gt; Will you hear the word of the Lord? &gt;&gt; It's time to change your focus. &gt;&gt; Whatever you're focusing on, is what's influencing you. &gt;&gt; But if you can change your focus, &gt;&gt; listen what a prophet says. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's turn our cameras this morning and look on up yonder in heaven." &gt;&gt; Let's break out of this dimension &gt;&gt; and look up yonder. When things look so dreary here, there's always something going on &gt;&gt; in another world. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Now, if the pillar of fire is here, &gt;&gt; what is the pillar of fire here to do? &gt;&gt; Is it here just to excite us? &gt;&gt; Is it just a Is it just a high word? The pillar of fire is here. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Now, &gt;&gt; that very same fire, I don't know if you can get it or not. If you can't, that's okay. That very same fire that's on that picture &gt;&gt; that the mechanical eye of the camera caught &gt;&gt; is right now. &gt;&gt; It's moving between me and you. &gt;&gt; You know what he said? He [screaming] said being in another dimension &gt;&gt; or another world. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? What he said? He said I see it and you feel it. You just thought you was feeling the atmosphere of the building. Oh no. When the message is being preached, you are feeling the influence of the purifier. [music] Come on. I'm going to tell you this. I'm going to say it or I'm going to bust. I'm tired of a historical God. I'm tired of a God that was the God of this message, the God of Elijah, [screaming] the God of this Bible, the God of this message is right here in this building tonight. My God is not dead. He's alive and he's moving and he's healing. [applause] [cheering] That's it. Thank you, brother. Right there. Amen. You see that picture? Turn it around. Amen. Show it off. I am not ashamed of that picture. I am not ashamed of the picture of the pillar of fire. Go ahead, zoom in on it for me. The brothers are working hard in the back to get it. I I spring it on them real quick. Amen. Hold that in front of the camera, brother. Let Let somebody get that on the camera. That's it. Go ahead, zoom in on that. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. [panting and sighs] &gt;&gt; That same pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Now, come on, folks. Who are we to follow, folks? Come on. We got to follow somebody. [screaming] Who are we following? &gt;&gt; Can I Can Leave [laughter] it right there. Can I show y'all something? Can I show you something? We don't just have the picture of the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; We don't just have a picture, but we have a voice. There's a lot of men that would love to have their picture right there. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; But there's only one voice &gt;&gt; to the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's the voice of the seventh angel. And what he taught is what we teach. And what he said is what we say. And what he presented is what we receive. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me back that picture now. I'm not done. I'm sorry y'all forgive me. [laughter] Amen. I got a question for you. Okay. Amen. Where is the pillar of fire? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Where is it at in this picture? &gt;&gt; Now, now this is a microphone, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Okay. Where is this microphone? &gt;&gt; Is it above my head? The microphone is below my voice. &gt;&gt; So, I've got something to say, but I need a voice to say it through. &gt;&gt; Do you see who the seventh angel is? He's the only microphone to this age. [cheering] The seventh angel was a microphone for the pillar of fire. What the pillar of fire was thinking is what the seventh angel was saying. And what he was saying is what I believe because I am of another order. [applause] I'm going to say this to you. That same pillar of fire is right here in this building tonight. Brother said, "If you can believe it, then whatever he leads your soul to believe, that is yours." &gt;&gt; I want to close tonight by saying this. Every devil [laughter] is defeated. The pillar of fire is still with this church. The angel of the Lord is still with this message. What the prophet said has not expired. It's still the inspired revelation of the age we're living in. Melzdc is in this building tonight. [music] Elohim is in this building tonight. He's looking for a body. He's looking for a body. He has no eyes but yours. He has no hands but yours. He has no feet but yours. I give myself to Melzdc. I give myself to Elohim. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Turn loose of yourself right now. Turn loose of your ideas. Turn loose of your theories. Turn loose of what some man said and let Melzdc claim every ounce of your body. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; There's an angel in this building. &gt;&gt; It's the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell y'all something right now. &gt;&gt; And I want you to hear me. And I want you to hear me plainly. &gt;&gt; I don't care how long you've had it. I don't care what condition you've had. I don't care what problem you've carried. I don't care what thing has been passed down from one generation to the next. I want to say something to you tonight. In the presence of the pillar of fire, it is defeated. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; In the presence of the pillar of fire, whatever ailment is afflicting you is defeated. I'm not going to rush through this. I'm going to I'm going to bust that devil square in the face. &gt;&gt; That devil is defeated. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire brings the devil powerless before. Come on. I study Brother's message. You know what he said? He said the pillar of fire is the anointing. He said, "And when the pillar of fire comes down," Thank you. I've just got liberty to preach. I'm I'm I'm done preaching. I'm having fun now. Amen. When the pillar of fire comes down, every spirit becomes subject to it. [applause] &gt;&gt; When the pillar of fire comes, &gt;&gt; every spirit becomes subject to it. &gt;&gt; Every voice &gt;&gt; becomes subject to it. Every gift becomes subject to it. Every preacher becomes subject to it. Every every ounce of this bride body becomes subject to the headship of Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, can I say something to you? &gt;&gt; Be careful when you start talking about somebody's worship. [applause] &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's just the music doing that. &gt;&gt; What if it's the pillar of fire? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; But it's just the pillar of fire hanging over that person. &gt;&gt; And the brooding presence of God is hovering over that individual. And they're getting ready to go from sickness unto health. They're getting ready to go from bondage under liberty. They're getting ready to go from fear unto faith. They're getting ready to go from failure unto success. I'm talking about the message of the hour and is influenced by the pillar of fire. [cheering] This ain't just some little intellectual talk somewhere. This is a living message. You want a testimony? You want a testimony of it? I got a friend of mine, Brother Ed Hunter, Mushing, Indiana. Brother Ed Hunter, years ago, he was in Brother Beam's meeting and proving his word. Some of y'all may know, brother Ed, he was in brothers meeting proving his word. &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother Andrew," he said, "I come to those meetings." He said, "I had a condition in my body." He said, "It was a condition of hemorrhoids." And he said, he said, "It had been in my family in generations before me and had it." And he said, "I was looking," this is a supernatural message, folks, &gt;&gt; of the hour. &gt;&gt; He said, "I was looking to get a prayer card and get Brother Em's prayer line." And he said, "I got a prayer card." And you know what he said, brother? He started calling prayer card numbers, but he didn't call mine. &gt;&gt; And he said, "About that time, I'm going somewhere." &gt;&gt; He said, "I just kind of settled down and I said this. My grandfather had it. My father had it. So, I guess I'll just have it." &gt;&gt; He said, "If I can't get in the prayer line, then I guess I'll just have it." See, this is not about one person. It's about the anointing. &gt;&gt; It's about the pillar of fire. He said, "And just as I settled down and accepted I would always have it," you know what he said, brother Gideon? He said, "All of a sudden, something come over me." And he said, "It spoke to my heart and said, "Worship God regardless." [applause and cheering] He said, "Worship God [screaming] regardless. If you get in the prayer line, praise God. If you don't, praise God. If he prays for you, praise God. If he don't, praise God. Worship the Lord regardless. And you can go hear it on tape, okay? You can hear it for yourself. And all of a sudden, Brother B said, "Oh, big man from Texas, you finally recognized it, didn't you? You know what he said? He said, "The pillar of fire has been hanging over your head for a half an hour. It's been waiting for you to entertain. its presence. &gt;&gt; You know what he said? He said he be to worship the Lord. He be to worship. He said, "And I never had the trouble again." Brother Brandham never laid his hands on him. But he didn't [laughter] need to. The pill of fire was in attendance. I don't have to lay my hands on you tonight. I challenge you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ upon the basis of the next of the hour. Rise up on your feet and receive your healing and receive your miracle and receive your prodical son coming home. Receive that deliverance. Receive ye the Holy Ghost. The pillar of fire has come from another world. [cheering] Worship the Lord. worship. Thou demon of confusion, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You're not going to be the sons of God. I'm not a crazy man. &gt;&gt; I'm a I'm a I'm a Holy Ghost fil child of the living God. &gt;&gt; How long are you going to lay down and let the devil bind you under the chains of condemnation? &gt;&gt; It's time to get up. &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, I failed. Get up, &gt;&gt; brother. I made a mistake. &gt;&gt; Get up. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, you just don't know how bad it was. It's changed everything. I could never be a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Get up. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I got to borrow this. A dear friend of mine, Brother Wayne Lawson, I saw him use this this illustration. I'm gonna have to borrow it. Brother Brother Isaac, can I borrow you for a second? You're [panting] You're going to hate me. Can Can What? What's your name? &gt;&gt; Isaac. &gt;&gt; What's your name? &gt;&gt; Isaac. &gt;&gt; What's your last name? &gt;&gt; Oid. &gt;&gt; Who's your father? &gt;&gt; Theo. &gt;&gt; Theo. Oid. &gt;&gt; What's your name? &gt;&gt; Isaac. &gt;&gt; Who's your father? &gt;&gt; Theo. &gt;&gt; Okay. Do me a favor and just sit down there. &gt;&gt; Okay. And lay down here on this step. I'll pay the dry cleaning bill. Okay, now he's fallen. &gt;&gt; Get back up. &gt;&gt; Stand up, please. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What's your name? &gt;&gt; Isaac. &gt;&gt; Who's your father? &gt;&gt; Brother Theo. &gt;&gt; What's your name? &gt;&gt; Isaac. &gt;&gt; Who's your dad? &gt;&gt; Theo. &gt;&gt; So, the fall didn't change who you were. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; You were a son of God when you went down and you got back up a son of God because the fall don't change who you are. If you ever was a son of God, you might have fallen but get [laughter] back up. You're still a son and a daughter. Come out from among men and be ye separate, sayeth the Lord, and I will receive you and I will be a father unto you. God bless you. The pit of fire is here. entertain his presence. Worship the Lord. Worship the God of Elijah. Worship the God of Abraham. Almighty God, we worship you tonight in this building.
