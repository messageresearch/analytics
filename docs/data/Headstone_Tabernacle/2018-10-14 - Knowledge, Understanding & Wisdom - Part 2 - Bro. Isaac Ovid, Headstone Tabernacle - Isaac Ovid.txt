be in a house of the Lord this morning happy to be in his presence on Sunday morning even before we get to this service there's another praise some prayer requests I like to read giving God praise and thanks for sparing the life of Emanuel and his co-workers who were involved in a major vehicular accident thanking God for His mercy and grace towards them and that God would continue to increase him animals feet to put on his total healing during his time of recovery from sister Donna key clock any time in gone even a prayer requests brother Jabari Samuel is requesting prayer for his son who has the cool and fever and this was submitted on their behalf from buddy Stephen Oliveri and also from sister Donna key Clark for Claudine Tobias who is presently experiencing abdominal pains that God would extend mercy an increase of feet to pull down on her healing so can we bow our heads for a word of Prayer and if there's any on spoken or on written request that you want to go to the throne of God this morning you could show a raise of hands as we pray this morning our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you this morning for your blood Lord for your grace for your mercy towards us Lord and as we have come into your house once more your house of worship your house of praise your house of correction your house of healing your house of restoration your house of deliverance your house of peace your house of Lord reconnecting back to who we are in you Lord that you would touch each one this morning that's Lord both here in the building and those that are connected on the internet and Lord we see these prayer requests that have come diff your throne of God this morning we pray right now that you would touch the Barry's son in the name of Jesus Christ and you will heal him completely from this call and this fever father because that sickness in the name of Jesus Christ this morning Lord for Claudine Tobias with the abdominal pains may you heal a completely from the crown of a head to the soles of her feet and may you continue the recovery with Emanuel today no precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says Amen any man you may be seated a man so we're certainly happy to be in the house of the Lord on this Sunday morning and to be in the presence of God knowing that he promised to do more than we could ever ask or even think according to the power that worketh in US and certainly I want to welcome by the Michael Matt Mayo this morning the market is always an honor a privilege to have you with us Amen welcome welcome home welcome home god bless you and over the last few days we've actually had one elder and three deacons all have booties I didn't realize they were all around the same time so I do want to recognize but I know but Knights who had his birthday he serves as an elder in the church happy birthday brother nights amen and also three of our deacons or head Deacon but Hugh Williams also celebrated his birthday as well I want to salute him for his labor his sacrifice he is one year younger amen also better Joseph Williams I don't know where he's at but god bless you brother Joe happy birthday as well and this morning by the atrium Joseph and his poster Duty god bless you and agent may the Lord continue to bless you mightily as you serve the king and his kingdom amen silly when they welcome back but Ovid in the house is spoiling our pastor and his wife sister babe Leah took a short rest if I could see you soon myself I don't think that was quite long enough of a rest but they are back in the house this morning and beloved preached on Friday night and for those who were here we were mightily blessed and what a tremendous masterpiece and if you missed it it's on our youtube channel so I encourage you to really listen it it was read and encouraged been fight for every inch you know he said four words fight for every inch it's not gonna be easy but you have to fight for every inch so if you came this morning to fight for every engine you in the right place if you came this more to fight for every inch in the right time because nothing worth having it comes easy but if it's worth having you have to have the tenacity to drive the energy the enthusiasm the passion the zeal for whatever it is in life you have to have something that drives you to fight and that word fight is powerful because it means that you're gonna encounter resistance and it's not fight by foot or fight by yards is fight by inch so it's going to be slow moving but it's positive move in it's Oh somebody help me this morning every inch of ground and the thing of it is as you claim these inches you're not gonna give it back to the devil oh we're gonna gain and keep it we're gonna acquire and build a choir and build a choir and build all the way to the resurrection all the way to the wedding supper all the way to the rapture can the church see man hallelujah you may be seated and certainly I want to salute by the Anthony for the service last Wednesday night what a blessing you know and I really want to salute all the believers who have had to readjust their schedules and there are times to make it to the special midweek services you know the Bible says even as the day approaches we will gather more frequently so we are in the word we are in the word and it reminds us because to break out of your routine or your schedule requires decisions everything in life is about the decision it's a decision every single thing in life is about the decision everything God has done has been based on a decision that he made he thought about it he thought about you he thought about him he thought about the Sun and where he should put it in place and he decided where he's gonna put it he thought about what mountain to make the tallest mountain and he put Mount Everest in his place because that's where he wanted to see the tallest mountain in its place there's no accident with God there's nothing haphazard recorded and you decided this morning to be here in the house of God there's no accident with that decision there is no mistake there is there is no luck and there's no chance there's this is God allowing us as with freewill to make a choice and because you have chosen his foreknowledge knew what you would choose and because of that choice he has a whole storeroom of blessings for you this morning can the church say Amen so this week we'll just have services Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. make every effort to be here this Wednesday there will be no services coming Friday so just be reminded only on Wednesday and there'll be no services coming Friday and of course service continues this coming Sunday and last week I believe we had a wonderful time in the Lord speaking about knowledge understanding and wisdom how many were blessed man it's very difficult to speak about a service you preach a week before this is first time never never done that referencing but I raised it because we want to continue along that road this morning a lower place in my heart to continue part two of that message this morning and bit of it this morning ask me is there part three I see maybe there are 10 paths I'm not sure you know but when you talk about the knowledge understanding and wisdom of God it keeps unfolding and there's more and more to it and I do have so I could give you my title even before we read the scripture knowledge understanding and wisdom part two with a subject being the mind of Christ and an inspiration the intelligence so we're looking for God to do something this morning special and speak to us in a special way so if you have your Bibles thank you musicians you could turn with me to our we're gonna read from four portions of Scripture once again I want to reference the same scriptures we read last week so we can build upon it once again Isaiah 55 reading from this 8 as the f55 and verse 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts and reading Romans 12 reading verse 2 we also going to touch in Philippians and we're gonna read and proverbs 4 reading Romans 12 and verse 2 and be not conformed to this world in other words do not take the shape of this world do not twist your behavior to meet the standards of the world don't desire to be like the world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acts acceptable and perfect will of God and reading Philippians 2 and reading verse 5 Philippians 2 I read in verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus and our last reading proverbs 4 reading from 1 to 13 proverbs 4:18 here ensuring the instruction of a father and attend to no understanding for I give you good doctrine for sake he not my law for I was my father's son tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother he taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my words keep my Commandments and live get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and we're all like getting get understanding exalt her and she shall promote me she shall bring thee to honor when thou dost and Bree saw she shall give today I had an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall be she delivered to thee here all my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many I have thought be in the way of wisdom I have led V in right paths when thou goest I step shall not be straightened and when darkness thou shall not stumble take fast hole of instruction let her not go keep her for she is thy life I mean the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let us bow has one more thought once more Heavenly Father Lord any man could read the scriptures but it truly takes the Spirit of God to breathe life upon it father this morning as we endeavor in your word may you give us the knowledge understanding and the wisdom to rightly divide the word so that we could leave this house change and transform drawn closer to you we are not here for our ideas we're not here for our thinking's but Lord we are conscious that there's a higher thinking we are conscious that there's a higher power we are conscious that we are called to something greater may you walk out the pages of the Bible today and may you stir in our hearts a newness of life and a revival in the depths of our soul Lord recognizing that the hour is late recognizing that the Prophet messenger of Malachi 4 didn't come just for us to have church or gather together but to show us how to go for us to prepare to leave this place so may you connect the dots as it were in our hearts may you answer the deep questions in our souls and the areas of confusion and doubt and fear misgivings whatever it may be may you minister to us the only way that you can father me you touch the fathers and the mothers the children the officers the helps the governments those that are connected may you minister to one and all may you take me out of the wave and speak directly to your children in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says Amen any man you may be seated hallelujah can we give the Lord a hand a praise so we are speaking on knowledge understanding and wisdom and we started this topic this theme with the young people in the last few service and last Sunday and we hear again today because when you understand it and you get into the quotes but the man I made it very clear that a word is a thought expressed so before you could say anything it had to originate somewhere so he said a word when expressed is a thought that changes form it had to be a thought before it could be expressed whenever you think of something to speak or even do any type of action you rely on your mind because the mind is where the thinking takes place and in order to make a decision whether it is to speak or to act that thinking relies on what you know that thinking relies on what you understand and that thinking also applies to the wisdom that you would have acquired so it is said that age brings wisdom because the assumption is that as you get older you would have tried enough with the knowledge you have had to learn something more than you did before and over the period of time you would have learned what not to do and what to do and and as a result of this age brings wisdom but we realize when we watch certain people who are all that necessarily that doesn't always connect that is not so much at age brings wisdom but wisdom is something that has to be acquired and provides you read said get wisdom get understanding and it speaks of knowledge number the Anthony beautifully brought back to fear of the Lord as the beginning of knowledge the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom in other words if in our schools we teach as the very first lesson the fear of the Lord we would have a different type of student that comes out of school everybody with me this morning if in the church we teach the fear of the Lord as a first principle of teaching we would have a different type of behavior because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of understanding and the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom can the church same and I'm I'm just recapping a few things before we get into a few things this morning so in topic we are talking about the mind of Christ because we are promised that that mind is supposed to be in the bride and that mind is supposed to be in us so for us to get the mind of Christ it has to be a desire for our thinking to change there has to not only be a desire there must be a realization that our thinking is flawed the very best of our thinking is Florida let me say that again the very best of man's knowledge is limited the very best of man's understanding is limited the very best of man's wisdom will all we limited it what is limitless it's cause knowledge what is limitless is course understanding what is limitless is God's wisdom so Paul and speaker Z I come not to you it with enticing words and the wisdom of a man but I'm connected to something or anybody with me know anybody with me in the house is smaller no one not the Bible you see he refused to show it to the wise and prefer this show it the beam such as we learn he's not talking about the wise based on the wisdom of God is only wise in their own eyes wise in their wisdom you could spend and I have met people who have read the Bible back to front they could quote every verse they could cut every scripture they could justify how they act but it's not spiritual knowledge he could understand and that's why pork is it do I understand all mysteries there is something greater than man's understanding there is something greater than man's knowledge there's something greater than man's wisdom and that is what comes from God can the church seaman so if you approach marriage with the knowledge of men with the understanding of men with the wisdom of men then you cannot tap into the spiritual or the God side of marriage because God has his own thinking you ever see the Furman I want you to get this Court has his own thoughts on what makes a good marriage you can have your thoughts but he has his thoughts you may have your thoughts on what makes a good career for you but he has his thoughts about what's the best career for you or somebody help me this morning you could have your thoughts of how to do things in your life but he has his thoughts and all of the problems we encounter in life is when we try our way and we refuse to listen to his way and that's why we are here this morning to get connected to his way to get connected to his thoughts to get connected to his approach hallelujah you may be seated God has designed it that your thoughts your knowledge your understanding your wisdom will always lead to failure [Applause] because once you rely on your thinking about that lean not on your own understanding but when you rely on his understanding you are guaranteed to have his success you're guaranteed to have his blessing all God has desired is to be able to communicate to somebody in the same language somebody helped me this morning you may be seated [Applause] [Music] you made me see this for a minute I'm not gonna talk to you before I preach don't worry I have a hundred and three pages so we have food so I can't say that is the appetizer this morning for you to speak a language for you to communicate you must have an image for you to say the word cup there must be a cup visual in your mind sometime it doesn't happen consciously it happens too fast so your head you would say King before you talk to me because the people want to talk so fast he breathes until it catch up with the words they're trying to say it isn't but fee to speak a language with someone we just speak Spanish you have to know what you are relating to come everybody with me and when man hell God lost the ability to communicate the way he wanted to with man because man and God was no longer thinking the same way Adam was made in the image and likeness of God it's two different things image and likeness image speaks a form like this speaks of attributes I'll say one more time image of God but likeness is thinking behavior conduct so when Adam walked he was in the image of his father but he was also his father his thinking was in alignment with clutch thinking on the motto that's why I got to trust him whatever you name I'll back it up because you are thinking like me so quad has long since Adam sell to find men we would think like him because that's how he knows is it's his son because his thinking produces his words oh come on no one not the apostle to take notes part of what they said because their thoughts were his thoughts so if their words became his words no wonder we learned the prophets are the mouthpiece of God so for a prophet to be a genuine prophet he has to put his thoughts on the subject so you don't need to be his father's thoughts that is what makes him a prophet because if he interject his own words it's no longer God's thinking it becomes his thinking can the church say man ride with me this morning we haven't church this morning we in the word this morning because at the end of the tea cold wants to restore back man to image and likeness behavior an attribute of my flesh bone of my bone spirit of my spirit when they see you they see the husband when you see me you see the father it's hard to even differentiate the two because when you speak heaven responds when he speaks heaven responds if you shall say to this mountain be moved the mountain doesn't actually you the bumpty recognizes the authority that's in the son of the Living God in this bride of Jesus Christ somebody say man I'll get to the mess if I want to speak about thinking a little bit and this teaching has gone beyond the realm of Scripture it's in every area philosophy the study of philosophy the study of knowledge so from yearly Plato Socrates Aristotle for eg to tried to understand this thing called the mind I believe it's Albert Einstein said the mind is a terrible thing to waste power locked up in your thinking as a man thinketh in his heart so he is so what you think about that's what you become so if you think I'm a failure it becomes what psychologists referred to as a self-fulfilling prophecy because your thoughts become what you live out so your thinking is very important like I heard somebody say one time in the business will he said don't say that you're poor or don't think you're poor think you're broken he said it's a difference you see a poverty that's theater man he said that's why someone who is poor could win the lottery and in two years they have no money because they have always been poor boys that we have thinking but if you have no money you're broken that's temporary because if you are broken you can be restored if you're broken you can get black it's all about your thinking so when Caleb and the other ministers went into the Promised Land they didn't have a conversation with the chance but their thinking was different ten men saw the situation did the analysis did their research and submitted the report that said we cannot do it did you speak to them no did you have a conversation with them no so how did you come to this conclusion when I thought about it and when I thought about it my thinking told me based on my knowledge based on my understanding based on my wisdom that we are not a match for these gyres but Joshua and killeth went to the same place saw the same thing at the same grapes drank the same honey but their thinking was different they remembered how God took them out of Egypt they remember how to read she opened up they remembered how it was swallowed up he remembered how God made a way for them when there seemed to be no way he did not look at what the eyes saw their weddings are deep acknowledged a deeper understanding and a deeper wisdom and they also submitted a report you may receive it for a minute the report was different they are reports that we are so excited we are so happy we are so pleased to report that we have entered the land we have tasted the grapes they are planted and described they are juicier than advertised come on somebody help me this morning the honey was the sweetest honey we are ever tasted you may be seated the report continued there are some challenges to get into this land but these challenges we can handle it because when we look at the challenges we are more than able we are more than able we are more enabled and if you didn't read the last paragraph we are more enabled [Applause] you may be seated [Music] [Applause] [Music] you may be seated so it was not that the Giants had come on out palsy ten men and jacked him up in equal and not them and they had a never let's come back abuse but we got beat up it was their thinking their kids in there all conclusion I want you to get that the power of your decision that's why with a vertical because thou hast chosen you made a decision based on your thinking now the more the word you get and the more the spirit you color contact with it is impossible for your thinking to remain the same [Applause] he made me see them it is impossible and that is why it shocked me and it goes to show it's not about time and the message it's not about what church you go to people go to annoy people sat in from the Prophet and then believe think about it people were they on the platform and in belief when the man was beaten up preachers came into the tabernacle those believe in ministers if they had believed in the gift and protecting the gift they would have formed a barricade at least if it's not wanna is to see us let us all go together as a group but every man Bella kindly ran of the platform and leave a short profit and they thought he was alone [Music] but this short prophet who was alone had the knowledge that no weapon formed against me shall prosper he had to knowledge that the angel of the lord encamps around him that near him the same fear the lord this prophet angel messenger sign the right hand of God had knowledge and the understanding that he didn't need to fear the understanding he didn't need to worry the understanding and he didn't need to run I'm the wisdom to see you gonna fall over my feet somebody helped me this morning everybody feelin fine you happily been a house of the Lord this morning there's no better place to be this morning Danny leaves presents candid shirts a man with a George I forgot my watch so I'm holding you accountable to keep me on time so time is no more for me it is any problem afterwards dr. Burdick angrily in the message Christ is revealed in his own world brother Branham said see down through the edge we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground a complete seed so he said what went in the ground was the complete sheet of force then it came to the feet Luther come back out then through Wesley then into Pentecostals the tongues and the lip see now was in the eye so the Prophet is speaking about his own ministry prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is now listen he said the next is the intelligence and this wherever the random places is and this is the call it the context in the message for this theme we have no intelligence of our own so we have no knowledge of our own no understand or no wisdom of our own button brother branham goes on we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee these things he can't do it it's God himself see it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam did at the beginning come the church say man so I'm gonna place some quotes in here and we'll see what God will do in a message God in his people he said what is it God in his people God in his wood God in his servants God in his prophets God in his healing or gods here in this building tonight and I say he's here today do you believe it right now that's right it's God in his creation you believe it is that right it's gone in his word do you believe it what's gone in his son do you believe it what's caught in his people do you believe it I can just prove that he's in here now I believe that it's God the Holy Ghost flowing over this building right now that if the same and he'll every person in him God is in his people now in the upper room they were in one mind and one Accord a chord means will or purpose so they were in one way of thinking so if you came here but they're an official message you kept what you expect so you was supposed to come to church this morning with an expectation in other words whoever to be walking and thinking a certain way useful to walk into the house of God this morning thinking today is my deliverance you supposed to walk in here this morning thinking I'm gonna get the Holy Ghost you were supposed to walk in this morning thinking we are in revival I'm gonna Branham said if you get the people in one mind and one Accord in five minutes they'll maybe not one sick person inside a building this morning so the preaching of the gospel is for us to be transformed by the renewing of our minds to have a different approach to have a different talker to have a different walker to have a different life somebody say man Oh hallelujah mine is the same here every person here God is in his people I believe at night time when he calls when he calls at ticket you hear that but the man said when he calls I take it when God calls you don't miss this call when this call you take Nicole every time I heard somebody say recently the word is like trying to get God's phone number but I Brandon said it like this he said the full obedience to the entire wood entitles you to the token so I heard somebody speak and he say you know when you take a few scriptures it's like a key when you have the old-fashioned key there were certain grooves so in order for the key to work you have to have all the grooves for it to turn the lock if you have some of the grooves the door would never open likewise if you have God's phone number and it's a it's a seven digit number if you have five numbers or six numbers you can't call him if you want to cooperate or we do - no it's one eight six eight seven four one we're living in today that will finish it numbers but if you know you want to call him 741 you need to get the other four numbers correct for it to ring his phone now you could have three of the other four right and you're gonna walk around see now how do seven I have before have you one I have the next one XY and the rest missing one have him six of these seven numbers as good or as correct as it is still will not get him so when you come to church and see what I do this and I do this and I read two sounds and that's one of okay could great you have that one but you need to get all seven to be able to call and when you need to call glory you have to have the phone number you have to the present I know the number to call and that number is when the seven step is complete in your life that's how he makes a big heap that's how he makes a believer so when you call heaven you get direct access because you have all the numbers you have all the virtues you have all the characteristic you have all the would come on somebody preach back to me is this helping somebody this morning this deals with all those people who say well had a spree Anders read but you're still living this way thanks a number missing because one of the numbers they have to be the way you live one must be how you talk I'll be even nicer over when I talk to my wife I'm talking to any old house I said number two come on somebody preach back to me one number is how you behave and work so everything else is good but it work you look like a temple when you fix that number and all the numbers get in alignment when this key this key a Fiat closer to the groove and a lot of blessings that heaven has somebody help me this morning so when we cause I think it hallelujah you know you think I'm crazy that's the Prophet maybe you do but I don't think so that's how I feel this morning maybe you think I'm crazy maybe you do but I don't think so I know I'm not crazy you see I couldn't lose my mind mine of will I have the mind of Christ hallelujah he's more than life to me you may call it whatever you want to hallelujah hallelujah you can call the Holy Ghost tonight if he said if you want to but one day I was a sinner this is the prophet speaking now I'm a Christian one day I was blind but now I see one day I was all kind of one day yonder another one said by the Branham I'm sorry to leave this burden to you but you are finished somebody told the Prophet I'm sorry to leave this burden on you that's how we are trying to see it nicely sorry miss Boone Minya but you've finished he said but I said two years ago they told me you are finished and tonight I'm in the best health I ever was God is still in its people hallelujah how can I prove it to you it is it is it the truth hallelujah I remember the brown embrace it our Father God we pray now and you'll pour yourself tonight upon these people and me the everyone be healed hear my prayer Lord they are sick ohgod may your spirit come upon your poor humble servant and me sins be called me people be healed of all manner of diseases here tonight for we ask in Jesus name Amen hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord in the message witnesses but the balance of cause remember bring it back to your memory you can't have the mind of Christ and the mind of the world at the same time you can't be in your way and God's Way at the same time you have to get out of your own way to let God have his wing that's the only way you're ever gonna do anything you've got to get away from your own thoughts your own reason don't try to reason just believe can the church team maybe this will help somebody this morning where the man said what if Mary tried to reason about the Virgin but what is she trying to say no wait a minute now look I don't know no man there's never been anyone like that you see Mary couldn't use knowledge because learn knowledge or even man's knowledge at that time could not explain how a virgin could conceive and if knowledge is the foundation you can't even understand what you don't even know so nobody could have explained to Mary how it's gonna happen cause nobody understood it because there was no evidence there was no knowledge of it but it took spiritual wisdom to drop down to tell Mary the Holy Ghost will overshadow thee every prophet every Messenger of God have to go beyond human knowledge beyond human understanding beyond human wisdom when God told Noah Noah build an ark it's about to rain there was no knowledge there was no evidence to show a green was ever gonna fall but no squat hapa is it a mind of God and Noah started building he couldn't understand with his with his natural mind but he trusted the wisdom of God that it was about to happen and court let him come to church see man read through the Bible it has been over and over and over again can the church say man put a man up said Mary never waited for anything she just took God at His Word and started thanking God for the baby before she felt any life before she felt anything before one sign was given to her she's had it thank God for the baby so remember the Branham said missing limbs will be restored if you have a limb missing I don't need human understanding to try to explain to anybody I don't need human knowledge to explain to anybody but I'm thanking God waiting because he promised one day we'll understand it that's a pie and pie how do I need to know it right now I don't need to understand right now but if God's prophet said it I believe it that settles it missing limbs are going to be restored it's got to happen glocks prophet spoke it these gray hairs have to turn back black God's prophet said it I believe it Oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated I said it before I looked in the mirror yesterday that's why I keep my hair this slow and like I had to go low because I'm here something amiss here mighty often E has no missing here hallelujah hallelujah this balls what here I'm too young for this balls what the devil gone with my hair well it's got to come back if Adam didn't fall we wouldn't get old we wouldn't get sick we wouldn't get tired Satan came it's of course Eden and turn it upside down and God has restored our prime the turn it right-side up [Applause] no more sickness no more depression no more back pain no more poor head no more orange what are you talking about and you don't want to be happy brother I'm happy to know that I'm connected to a God who can reverse the effects of aging reverse come on now [Applause] you haven't seen it but a Branham said this gospel has benefits this class will ask benefits listen you may be seated we talked about the 11-hour workers case any CMP well with this cord this ask me I have benefits these walnut goes is your pain you holy ghost that's your salary but they are benefits you know you may be seated you know where to get a good job a good job then until you get health plan and pension plan and travel allowance and phone and computer and all kind of travel and special vacation Thanks we have a good job all these are benefits that are separate and apart from your salary the Holy Ghost that's your salary that's you not see anything that's a salary of the 1100 workers but on top of your salary God as a benefit will give you your children God has a benefit will heal you God as a benefit will give you the tremendous victory in the love divine God as a benefit will restore your eyesight God as a management really heal every five of your party God as a benefit will restore your joy will restore your peace where is for your victory [Applause] those are your benefits that's what he died for to release your benefits [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah [Applause] but the teller doesn't want you to know this you may be seated he doesn't want you to notice that that was also another trick you know you want you to be full of your blessings to the other side let me say that again the devil happy if you keep saying a comment it coming it coming and you live in it coming you don't have no problem that's no way see me no Fiat is believer who started trouble the waters like a weak Jesus and say I need it now I know you have promises but what did he get right now what did he get today I don't want to wait there is an active but today I'm not leaving today without something that's how the woman came with the issue of blood she decided she made up her mind I've spent all of the house but I've made up my mind that I'm going to church this morning I don't care how many people there but if I could just touch the hem of His garment I know I'll be made whole no Deacon cachapa the elegance aha the police couldn't keep her transported and kiba and she pressed away because she was not going home without getting something she decided have you decided have you made a decision to not go on the SEMA you came this morning be it unto you according to your faith this morning Florida [Applause] you may be seated I'm gonna brand I'm also said he said when you pray and they claim something you'll have to go back and claim it again it's already yours so when I don't come in your mind but Andrew he's had a tongue Gordon loader because it's already yours so when you claim your children and you claim victory it's already claimed thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord the devil see over here is thank you lord thank you lord thank you thank you for healing me thank you you may be seated we know the story the blind man came to the prophet the Prophet prayed for him he went back his way and then he you didn't see the healing he came back to the Prophet the brother said but I already pray for you the first time I prayed that was good enough but you know what he's you know Saint by his type of you begin attest live in it beginning its walk in it we cannot claim it that's the old rugged seat somewhere along the line people lot you old rugged feet if you feel that just make it a crazy you say that make yourself I could see you seen anything I could see you see what do you think I can see don't worry what I'm seeing but I could see my stripes I'm healed stripes I'm a healer I didn't wonder at the barbershop his eyes popped open and what he was speaking about came to pass you ever seen [Applause] [Music] Mary before she felt any life before she felt anything before one sign was given to her she just stood the angels would and went rejoicing and praising God and our angel messenger Malachi for seven inch or gave us oh wait and that word should be enough to be rejoicing and praising God that's why we emphasize praise and worship so much in the tabernacle because if God has revealed something to you if he has given you knowledge of his good and the understanding for what it means to you then you will get the wisdom to worship I can't understand the dead message churches because if culture is profit give you the knowledge and true cause divine intervention understanding of what this message means with it become the wisdom to worship like the tyranny of Peru you worship in with revelation and understanding that this thing has to come to pass I heard somebody you may be seated somebody said my office recently some eat is a good age to die and all of us died and I was the in the kitchen and you to go to know if you cannot groove here did I make my people straight planning retirement nothing wrong with my retirement by planning to leave here I want to be like enough one day my foot will connect to the Kings Highway I'll be walking to work walk into Church and one day I recognized wait a minute I'm not walking on I'm not walking on on this tiara anymore I'm walking the Kings Highway but if you're not unknown thereafter to your life you have no rough you to go to if you don't Unknowing the Holy Ghost in your life you have the Holy Ghost again so when Mary said be it unto me according that I would that was her anointing the word to her life anointing the word to her situation so if a word has spoken to you this morning your response should be be it unto me according to thy word if healing is what you need be it unto me according to thy word if deliverance is what you need be it unto me according to thy word if your family is what you're looking for be it unto me according to thy word and watch God bless you I [Applause] listen and this is the problem with us I'm still the same quote I'm a pitch 9 president so we goin good residence on the 10% before she felt any life I want to read it again before she felt anything before one sign was given to her she just took the Angels wood and went rejoice think I'm praising God that's not all enough listen to the rest of it and when you wonder why you're missing certain things made a word - they give you the knowledge understanding and may he give you the wisdom the plan is your life only read it one more time I want to get to something before she felt any life before she felt anything before one sign was given to her she just took the Angels wood and went rejoicing and praising God telling everybody you see the father telling everybody she was going to have a baby who have you told that you're about to have a Holy Ghost baby who have you told that you're going to be healed you see below when you begin to talk about it it creates an expectation around you even if people mock you it still creates an expectation no one's billing me up and people said that gather they said I have our parties around New York because it was a center of attraction by didn't matter because that is how God unfolds it but if you're not telling nobody it makes me one of you really believe it because if you are really kind of Vince or something didn't even have to tell people about it then I tell you for me you know I'm gonna get healed I'm gonna get heaters I'm gonna get here to Abraham I'm gonna have a son people was watching him like yeah someone have a son Abraham there is something gonna have I'm gonna have a son I'm gonna have a son because that's what God proves his would listen friends but the random total court proves his word by believers now if there is not build-up or anticipation to the miracle how people know it is a miracle I like you are depending on God to do it so when he Abram say I'm gonna have a son I'm gonna have a son you see Ibrahim boy I don't notice him worry about my son everybody who did see you know that God of Abraham is real it's 25 years no Abraham telling me this thing I'd really and truly you know have a testimony I didn't believe but now I believe because I see somebody testify all this goodness and that's what the young people need to hear some more people testify I am I'm gonna get healed I'm gonna about breakthrough and watch God do it and then able to say if he could do it for him he could do it for me that's how the early church was built [Applause] can the church say man telling everybody she was going to have a baby and listen to the Prophet God give us some more marries around Phoenix here and I want to say give us some more marries around Trinidad here that can take God at His Word and start rejoicing before anything happens that's what you need that's all for she was overshadowed by the holy goose and when the Holy Ghost truly overshadows a person they take God at His Word that settles it what the Holy Ghost said candide should say Amen in the message law or grace but a parent said and we are fear to know her heart the fear of God in our heart and can see it clay it becomes a feet and then we speak it and it comes into existence so understand this seeing it is not just a routine but when you say it that is taking the thought into wood and when wood is spoken just like your father will it's materialized so when you keep it to yourself and don't see it there's nothing to enforce the thought until it becomes a word let me save it again there is nothing to release the power of your thinking until it becomes a word if God had said thinking about the son thinking about the son thinking about his son it was a thought until he spoke at the moment he spoke it activity could take place likewise when you speaks nonsense you see intranet you speak choppiness when you speak nonsense that also materialize sort of walk in this room is where a real fear boy what's not if you normalize feel I would I feel I speak I just feel what should I look at everybody failures look at my failure I feel and when you live in their world what we expect success unless you want to be more successful failure but whenever a man speak you speak to anybody and steal a certain as a job they tell them before you leave home any morning go any mirror and see to this would be a great day there's a term we use self what self affirmation work for me they have it and it's from Scripture each other and you see you're gonna make it I'm gonna be a success today there'll be no traffic me all the road be clear and all kind of affirmation ever who booked this read it in a book different decent thing today I'm a conqueror I'm a king I'm a queen I'm a ting leave your house energized energized until a child hit them boom pull back the book again I can make it I can make it because not groaning in chorus spiritually hula goes when the BAP is a letter weak say I am strong it is not that God is ignorant of the fact that weakness exists because his strength is made perfect in weakness but only when you can say I am strong [Applause] [Music] so is he we have to understand France God has done his part you know he sent messengers he sent angels he sent prophets he sent science he sent wonders to catch your attention for you to get the knowledge of who you are who he is who the devil is and understanding of who you are who he is who the devil is and your place in this economy of God and to have the wisdom to know when to speak winter act when to move for this final knockout punch that will kick the devil straight out to this bit that's what it's all about can the church even I listen to the Prophet know I'm driving something I know some of you haven't seen it yet but I want you to get something because many of us we come to church and we go back and do the same thing and the reason is our thinking has not seen it becomes a feat and then we speak it and it comes into existence the same thing cause the mind of crisis in the man listen prophet that's what make healings and so forth when you get that perfect revelation you hear that so the healing you're waiting for is about your thinking being changed to the Magnum Christ the same thing cause the mind of crisis in the mind is in the man that's what make healings and so forth when you get that perfect revelation just what you're doing then how to walk that's it god that's the Christian walk can the church say man could he take some more in the message the fundamental foundation for faith but the Balam said now the father and his would hold on one second now if we throw ourselves completely to God now if we could throw ourself completely to God and to his will and be lost to our own thoughts now that's a big problem for us you know friends we have our own thinking about how we want to do things we have our own ambitions we have our own plans I'm half 99% in fact they probably have I'm gonna get married this age I want to have this job I want to have this car I want to have this salary that's all you're thinking that you had talked to God yet I want to be at this I want to be at that I wanted to be an actuary that was my thinking and palm tree you couldn't stop me from what he back to Mary had a song Lord prepare me I'm serious I'm not joking to be an actuary that really was a song that's what I wanted but I was my own thinking Noah to all the mathematics you need for actuarial science is serious mathematics but I was my own thinking and if you look back through your life and look through what you have gone through and all your thoughts you would recognize that how every serve I used thought about doing it didn't materialize because if God did have a hand in it it will not materialize now if we could throw ourselves completely to God after his will and we lost our own thoughts and just let the mind of Christ being us them seem operations of the Spirit who work to us just as a natural thing nurse just the same thing because we were first created for that purpose to control to rule and to praise God and to live for God now jesus said if he abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and it shall be given to you if you abide in me and my words abide in you now the father and his wood is inseparable because the father is his son in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word has made flesh and dwelt among us god and his word is inseparable you cannot have God without having his wood and when you have his wood you have God now I want to place it in the promise message so you leave with the foundation if you want to go back a little further just as far as historical you can see the wizard in the beginning was the word but what is the word a word is a thought manifested a thought spoken for God first he perceived the thought and spoke it and it became a wood and the wood became material so it's thought that is spoken and once it's spoken it could become material so God thought about you smoke you and you are the material which is the expression of the world to this bride and we're talking about represents the material or the physical expression of the thoughts of God that was spoken through his prophet to call a bride out everybody with me this morning the son is the material that was the expression of course would everybody feeling fine so everything that God has spoken his would receive into the right channel will materialize that word for whatever the purpose behind it is God will do it he's obligated to it then if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you have a corner and a wood and you and you believe the word just as you believe God because it is God and it's inseparable then if you have coarse wooden you you have caused life in you you have corn and you are whatever God's Word speaks for out of you it will have to come to pass just like it was spoke from God what are you saying brother Isaac I'm sin all these years that you familiar with description you familiar with the message until it becomes your word until it becomes your thoughts it's not your message let me say that again for it to be your message and I preaches some months ago it is for the branham's message it's God's message to his bride but the Branham is the messenger but the Branham is the one who transmitted or chants with the message I'm going to us as people but it's not your message of my message until it becomes our thoughts and our words and then we can become the living expressions of what this prophet spoke because we are walking so that's why there's no room for my interpretation of the message or your interpretation where I seen it so and how you see in it if we carry on how we see if we take any mind of Christ us trying to figure it out will not come to us solution without a minor crash you know we can spend days debating the quote with our human understanding and our human knowledge but until the wisdom of war drops down and that's why but the Branham cleared this all up I said God is his own interpreter so regrets theologians in the message who just spend more time academically stood in the message gives no greater authority on the message because what we need is the mind of Christ to show us what he wants done with the word the mind of Christ how to live as husband and wife the mind of Christ as how to live as children in appearance houses the mind of Christ of how to choose a wife the mind of Christ of how to wait for your husband the mind of Christ of what job you're supposed to get the mind of Christ of how to be an example the mind of Christ how to run your business there's a mind of Christ for every matter every situation God has a thought about everything I don't even get get it off your mind of God is only interested in the spiritual things when those men had taxes to pay go tell him to go and fish he went beyond their understanding and their knowledge because it was what you see where we had taxes at least we go eat but when they cut the fish open and it was gold to go on pity taxes so you think oh I don't want to bless you abundantly he has a thought about everything he knows what you have in your bank account you know what bills you have coming up but if you keep thinking your own way holder solvent you were never even giving him room to how to solve it he knows how to solve the problem he's the best mathematician you didn't work in only numbers cards within your budget and he recognized have a deficit he know that before you even start the calculator and his math is different you know you didn't walk out on you can work and gold say what do we have we have five loaves and two fishes we have five thousand people to feed let's have spring and start to feed it I better over preached you guys who was at Katyn fullest that's a chance we could I know they closed up in the front and say I'm not looking back i guessing it for my own portion lord thank you for the blessing and they don't realize that he foods something a multiply because when God started work God works completely and it was the only realize was a miracle when he had a clean up these scraps I recognize that it was remainder you might even butterflies so much you gotta get more but when you bring your own thinking that situation you limit it but when you stop and say Lord I handing it to you and then go ah but you know what he wants after that you worship you won't see this worship lord I handle this problem to you because he said class all of our cares upon you that scripture I preached this before as if you problem any parents is they keep giving richer in the border I'm taking a bathroom good lord I give you my children I made me repossessed take them back I'm you trying to teach them I'm changing kneeling down and kneel it on and leave it on until it kneel flat no more million but if you hanok to go say lord give them understanding give them knowledge because many of us didn't know how to raise children we didn't have the knowledge we didn't have the understanding with empty wisdom and we didn't even know from your script you to ask God to see a lot because I've ever seen if you lack wisdom Axford so before you act in any situations they're not giving you wisdom because he promised to give it to you if you ask we are so irrationally at times we quit if God was so quick to act before we get to repent you know no church nobody would be here will be the chance but go on extend mercy to give any grace so come to the altar and say Lord I'm sorry lord please forgive me give me another chance so before you act in any area of your life you say lord give me the wisdom where I lack the knowledge show me where to go how to do give me the understanding of how to say this to my wife and the way that would have the right effects my tone of voice come on but punch every me this morning it takes wisdom how do you right toward that plenty ways to say things you know you can say before there's food there's food is in horrible you can say that that's one way remember years ago a burner tool as well this meal filled total failure no no you can't tell me she don't want to cook for two weeks after that because it's you cause that you couldn't find a better way a better way to see you didn't ya next time you make it yet you really prefer wisdom man because one size don't fit all you can say the same every time cuz if there's a pattern you will recognize you don't like it I remember a couple I read a story a couple after 20-something years what you said - like this chicken you just make it this way after 22 years and she saying you know tell me there's 22 years I don't like to cook it like this but because he didn't know how to say it he suffer in penance for 22 years eating a chicken he didn't like and because she even know how to say she's suffering 22 years preparing his chicken she didn't want to cook there's a way to approach your boss you can't make your boss or like a fool by boss watch now you really want to do it so and so and so when you fire my boss barn fire meals there's a way there's a way the Centurion approached Jesus for wisdom they say I see a man under Authority when I say onto one Cody Coe I recognize one [Music] [Applause] yeah I am unworthy he was feeding a kiss say I am unworthy future coming in my house if you just see the word that'll be all Jesus was so touched by the knowledge understanding wisdom that is my news he said quote I weigh a servant as he'll [Applause] look at it one more word he who I did was vexed with a devil it's not just fair to take a chair umbrella and custody dogs we talked about it many times by company shoes with the first time and a common repair request and I asked him to pray for me I never had a dog you see this all these dog torches he's talking and after that they go on she go on her way Alber obviously express-news they carry on Facebook Instagram interim stories but the fluffy hair dogs deceived that whatever the corner but she said but but but Lord even the dogs get crumbs that was real wisdom and listen this woman didn't have the Holy Ghost in her I want you to understand she didn't have you who only goes she wasn't an apostle she wasn't preaching for years and he just City right thing that what happens this is sad you're right but the Branham was relating this story of what happened with the squirrels isn't all right and when he really hated it sister had here I say that's nothing but the truth and with a branham's of the Angels if she said the right thing and remember what they said your words are an expression of your thinking so what do you see so when and some of us can't help but search we're gonna get some I'm not done yet but a Georgia give me salami until we sell what we see in our homes in our jobs in our lives is an expression if I was headed this way out of the abundance of your heart the mouth speaks and as a man think in his hat so there's mental thinking there's also hot thinking so this whole thing about understanding knowledge and wisdom you will feel at your job without the knowledge of what it takes to work you can be an architect every day I see a recent job application in a certain job we asked him for any person applying for a job with none of these skills no skill for the job come to realize they misread the job you're applying for no you don't have the knowledge or the job the understanding of what even applying for and then you wisdom to know what we are your wrong place but on your job in your life as a child and you know cheering stock offered a certain understanding an OD some chewiness swing their parents up and down and the business world they commercialize in it so in marketing we know you put all the candy and all the toys are in Lewisham it's not the every parent as wisdom is there for the children so when we children article your parents if they see it does not track them but when he child on sit and drop to the floor in the grocery and Sirte embarrass the parents you say okay I'll take it for you I'll take it for him and children know which pure naked go to and get away with what your enemy expertly exposed in here this morning the use in wisdom it didn't know it easier to get to Danny or easy to get to mommy when I was in school there was a young man in my class who his mother told him you're not going to this thing with the other boys and he tried it he went to his father when his mother went out and he called permission from his father when he mother came back she be the father on each other [Music] the baby said be wise as a serpent and gentle as a dove so trout Scripture you see this application is this theme of understanding this theme of knowledge this team of wisdom understanding God because God is so fast so big so powerful it's difficult enough finite minds to fully comprehend his majesty comprehend oh he could see a prostitute and he could look at the prostitute and man would look at how one way but when he sees her he has a deeper understanding that her name is on the book and the outward appearance has nothing to do with his love to meet her at the well to come to fish for her soul and pull her from the clutches of not just her sin but the fact that she did not know who she was so he was there together acknowledge that you are bigger than this you are born for a purpose you are a child of God and your past does not define you your mistakes do not define you your failures do not define you the definition of who you are comes from God and what's written about you in his book somebody say man this morning [Applause] but the better piece of all message called spiritual amnesia that message is to deal with this issue of not knowing not knowing who you are because you're born in your house here grow up in wherever you are limited by what you are told you are limited whatever you would by a schoolteacher who has a dream my dad and I clashed when I was in primary school cuz I've always been I said I'm a learner another form standard five teacher named mr. right and I succumb home sir see this sir say this sir see if that Tennessee mr. right is not always right he could be wrong but the message he was preaching and pyramus crew is so profound to me that I was that was a rule that I was going on but that's the product and all of us we are the product of what we were taught in school from our parents so whether it's an abusive home or an alcoholic father or academic children are the product of their environments here is little scientific evidence to support this nature versus nurture Theory there's a lot of debate about whether brilliance is born or you acquired and therefore when you take any child but I'm in the right environment it could blossom but the Branham said if you take a chicken egg and put it on that dog it will hatch because the environment is what determines the result the atmosphere I've seen shirin who were called slower because somebody spend the time and help them help them help them help them after a while they found ways to figure it out I think Nobel Prize winner Nash the mathematician for which the book and the movie A Beautiful Mind is written speaks of a man who had a mental issue and he decided say what almost happened to rewire his mind because you recognized what was real or does not his mental condition but the challenges we are totally easy that's why Quattro trusts for many teeth on the world day and night that's the only way to change your thinking not watch the news day and night not watch morning edition of The Daily proof or whatever else it is but if you meditate on the Word of God day and night your thinking will change everybody I'm keeping going George this morning when brothers get in trouble proverbs 5 verse 1 my son attend unto my wisdom and both an heir to my understanding you think every that the words may regard discretion and that I lips me keep knowledge for the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oil but her end is bitter as wormwood sharp as a two-edged sword her feet go down to death her step her steps take all on hell no you tell me if you read out any morning and you reading that all the time and this is more real to you oh you're in trouble how you ended up in problems but this must be real to you it must be your language this is God's language you know God found a way to express all of himself in a way that you could carry around with you the word is God and goddesses would this is his voice it depart not from it keep it close to your heart we fail as Christians when we don't read this word but the balance said it was this we said God don't make half with preaches he doesn't make half a Christians but we could be halfway and God will your business he will your life he will everything to force your attention to this because you are under his law David in discovering that understanding he looked and he said but I see people prospering around me and wanted to see have you considered their end because you are under a different law you want to go and do what you want to do but you are under different covenant and the Covenant requires something from you the covenant requires a certain contact from you there's a tutor assigned to what - behavior it is a great reward that's assigned to you and because of this I expect a certain behavior and that behavior ought to be consistent consistent you may be seated consistent you see church friends not the place that is come on shorten jump it's a change or behavior so there are times it should reinforce what you're doing that's good but more importantly it should highlight the areas of our life where we need to work on a few things if you come to church and don't hear what needs a change you need to change the church because we are not here to tell you everything is all right we have to make sure that you do what is required to make it to the rapture to make it to the resurrection to make it to the wedding supper not to play politics into play church but it's Souls I am in the balance with the real devil trying to pull people to hell and a real heaven with God trying to pull them to heaven [Applause] consistent behavior you want to be a Christian or you don't want to be a Christian right is wrong right is Right wrong is wrong there's no gray area of it good sin is sin holiness his holiness righteousness his righteousness wrong is wrong what was not acceptable 500 years ago cannot now be acceptable he said I am God and I changed not you may be seated the requirements for revival a thousand years ago are still the requirements today it requires prayer it requires sacrifice it requires holiness it requires the world it requires desperation come to church see me I want to warn the chiller just warning about something this one bothers me there are many young people who have lost their way doing nonsense they love human love decent human knowledge understanding of wisdom and his godly love granny love is corrective it doesn't control foolishness so I will see this once today and hopefully also repeat it again when young people who have been in church back slid and post nonsense on social media don't endorse it and see you looking good when they wear in stupidness [Music] young lady who grew up knowing not to wear pants not to wear makeup not to wear jewelry not to go too fast take a pic in a party looking good it's not looking good it's filthy before God that's what the Bible says that's the Word of God holiness is holy there's no middle ground he said I am God and I am holy God will have a clean shirt she will have a holy church that's what Jesus died for that's what he died for that's what he paid a price for first to live like him walk like him the Bible says when you look at a woman to lust after you already committed adultery in your heart and by the pranam said it's two sides of that equation it's not just a look to lust but when you dress in a way to attract men that's filthy before going that's the Bible that's the word when sinners entice Deacon sent them but don't give them permission don't get caught in it that's the word also come to church Shaymin right knowledge right understanding this is another popular gospel it's on a popular teaching it's not what people want to hear they want to hear that you can keep reading two scriptures listen to two things and if you foresee assembling of yourself together you're wasting time because that's the word also you have six numbers you're missing seven number whatever it is in your life you search your heart it's a command for sick not that's a command a sort of suggestion is that the idea is that something being presented to a sick not the assembling of yourselves together that's why we are here because we are obedient to the heavenly words of Almighty God [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everybody feeling fine so for the young peers it's not your parrot and I give you rules or pressure or it's what God says either you want to serve God or you want to please man is it's only two forces the only two influences the influence of God and the influence of man the influence of corn and the influence of the devil those are the only two influences and our desire our call is a please God it begins with a fear of the Lord but it turns it a love of God we love cost so much we don't want to hurt him we love God so much that if we make a mistake and mistakes will happen but you want to repent we don't want to be headstrong why you tell him how about it why are you making me feel bad if you feel bad about doing something wrong thank God because a minute still of voice of conviction speaking to your heart seeing you could change you could turn around there's not this mercy yes help for you think about our thinking we to review our thinking but Abraham said in a message as I thought on my way powerful message he said it was the Prophet Jacob who had done wrong and lied to his blind daddy because of a birthright and one day his heart began to you and to go back to the homeland he must have thought all that time it was covered up but when he began to get near home he heard that Esau was coming out to meet him then he thought of his deceiving ways and he prayed all night on the other side of the river when he thought how he had deceived his brother it called him to an all-night prayer god knows that's what the church needs I remember when the church used to call for all-night prayer meeting and when the sermon went forth there wasn't a dry eye in the church everybody wept and cried out before God and today it seems like it's loose that people just go on living any way they want to and sell Syria Christians I wonder if we're not nearing home we better think on always and turn off his testimony's maybe rethink how I walk this morning maybe rethink our talk this morning it was Moses the mighty prophet and all Shepherd she put he turned out to be that was wandering back behind the mountain one day and a little old path that the sheep had made perhaps it was very familiar to him but that morning was just a little different from all the morning's yes seemed to be something around him you know Jesus said once if they hold their peace the rocks will cry out I wonder if the Angels wasn't preaching to him talking about Moses all of a sudden he began to think on his ways and I encourage it sure just wanted to think on your ways have you been praying have you been seeking have you been living rights I want you to think on your ways when people look at you can they tell that you are Christian or do they wonder what your testimony is I want you to think on your ways I want you to think on how you were last week oh you will last month hope you were last year hope you would this morning I want you to think on your ways it's not about who's next to you it's you think on your ways this morning how did you come to church this morning how did you approach God this morning what were you doing Friday night when we had church in the house of God and even if you couldn't make it you could have been connected live I want you to think on your ways and even if you missed it did you listen back to the service on Saturday and what to think on your ways this morning we really want to be a Christian or do you want to live your own way I want you to think on your ways this morning all of a sudden Moses he began to think on his ways how did he admit a feeling if any tried to find safety while his people wasn't bondage this is the Prophet god grant at the heart of every preaching here we'll get that burden how we can rest in Zion when the world is covered with sin and church members living in sin we shake this chair just morning how can we hold our peace when the churches pour to pieces by Creed's and denominations and Brotherhood is separated it has if the Prophet is standing here this morning because the condition he is speaking to in this is in 1959 it's what we live just today how can we hold our peace when the church is tore to pieces by creeds and denominations and Brotherhood is separated and the people are becoming worldly deep mysteries but worldly great understanding but worldly massive churches but worldly peanut conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind and people are becoming worried when code requires holiness or no man shall see the Lord God requires holiness holiness in the husband holiness and the wife holiness in the parent God requires holiness not your thoughts on holiness but his thoughts on holiness there's a difference and Moses began to think on his ways how that he had went off in his own schooling and training and he know that there was a call of God in his life but he tried to work it out his own way many of us preachers or believers if I could see this get in that trouble a call of God in our life and then we go off and get a schooling that tells us that the tears of miracles are past and there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Spirit mainly young people went off to school at a university on jobs and they forgot about God they allowed lecturers and professors and school friends and the desire to please and to fit in and to belong when you belong to the family of God the desire to belong somewhere you lost your way in your job in your work and you can't find yourself and you know it is a call on your life you know there's a call in your life your family anointing you'll feel that still small voice something gripped your soul you're pinning a meeting where tears stream down your eyes you've been enough others and you knew you felt the power of God but you allow your love to wax cold you allow the fervent desire to please God but disappear may you think on your ways this morning allow the desire for money the desire for popularity the desire to be a success to be a somebody to get the next qualification to get the next place to get a bigger car to fit in somewhere may we think on our way is this morning we are being weighed in the balance just warning and we're being found one cheeky God let you think on your ways as a prophet that same God wrote that would still lives and holds you responsible Twitter when you speak it's got to be perfectly kind of change also God's will we have to alter our thinking to his thinking that's a prophet we have to alter our thinking to his thinking we have accepted mediocrity because we don't want to meet his standard Simon justification and excuses because we don't want to be held to his standard and then we talk about that's not how it used to be I remember the old time this you all ten days a year but individuals want to pull down to you anointing of the old time these any man any woman who turns away from the world and calls and God and as an old-fashioned Remington we'll have all fashion results court is obligated to give you old-fashioned Holy Ghost revival to believers who live your fashion boutique or sweet he is obligated hallelujah I've heard too many testimonies of there being a race of sick being healed and the conditions have to be there and the faith must also be there and the behavior must also be there and the prayer meetings must also be there and the family altars must be there and the men taking their place in their homes must also be there and the wives taking their place must also be there and the children taking their place was also be there and the Deacons and the elders and the ministers everyone in their place that's what makes a super Church when you find your position me this week as of this morning to pull down the knowledge of God to change our behavior the understanding that the hour is late and we cannot leave and the wisdom to know that if we call upon God he is promised to answer us hallelujah glory to God he cannot change we cannot alter course would we have to alter our thinking to his thinking let the mind of Christ be in you then you think like he thinks and as he began to think on these things but around I'm continuing on Moses I can see him becoming all Torah there's no man who can come into the presence of his own past but what gets tore up about it and I pray that the Holy Spirit would bring every human being here now back to your past and look at it then turn to his testimony and as he began to think I can see that old man with the flowing white beard and he said I've ruined my life I'm 80 years old and I thought of it when I was a young man I would have done the right thing but now it's too far and the great crystal tears rolling down his white piscis and about that time when he was drinking on his way there was a crackling noise on the side of his head while he was thinking on his ways he said I'll turn aside to see what this thing God has done and I trust that God will bring that burning bush in the hearing distance of every person in here tonight that we can think in our own ways and it change Moses when he turned his feet from the path of sheep and wild animal to the path that God had led him through the Red Sea and to the promised land thinking on his ways it does us good to think on his ways friends the service is shifting over this is no longer about speaking to you this is about you pondering his word you've been around long enough to know what's right what's wrong and it's time to raise the bar it's time to raise the standard not because you have lived under it means you keep pulling it down and pulling it down and pulling it down until you the level of comfort but this is this is my Christian walk no put the bow it's supposed to be and say lord help me help me help me to meet the standard a standard Paul had the standard Peter had the standard at William Branham had the standard that was set on the day of Pentecost he said the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was on the day of Pentecost the musicians can get ready I'm not gonna be much longer trying to wind up this morning thinking always whether Brandon went on he said on the had caught three times after the crowed three times and Peter looked up in the face of the Lord Jesus he began to think on his ways and what he had done to our Lord Peter had been there he had seen it and when the test came he denied Christ but around him said that when he heard a crow he looked up and he thought about it and it tore him up how could he do that to the Lord he could be gonna play something softly and we do think on your way this morning how we have we heard the Lord how have we heard our husbands how have you heard our wives how are we heard our parents how are we heard the ministry what we hold against somebody else think on your ways and say Lord I need to think differently I need a new mind I want to be transformed by the renewing of my mind I want to know I want a new talk I want a new way of life after the Kaka crow three times and Peter looked up in the face of the Lord Jesus he began to think on his ways and what he had done to her Lord and the prophecy in the word of the Lord came into his view for he know what God had said that seemed gora told him has told us also what to do what did it do when he thought in a way is that he had treated Jesus and how God denied him before the people I know he had tried to be one of the world that's what Peter did by denying Christ he was trying to be like one of the world he tried to act like the rest of them but when he taught in his ways it drove him into the darkness and the Bible says he wept bitterly he wept bitterly but if Adam said I believe it's cock-crowing time now for the Church of the Living God to get alone with God and a weeping bitterness of tears and say God be merciful to me no doubt but there's men and women here tonight boys and girls that need that same thing all of us needed alone with God friends think on your way this morning and say Lord be merciful I need a healing in my soul and every healing in my house I'm healing for my children I'm healing for my family I'm healing in my heart I've taught that my ways and what I've made so many mistakes but your blood your blood speaks better things when I think of my ways I realized a greater need for the blood when I think of my ways I realize the need for mercy when I think of my ways I realize the need for help there's anyone this morning you're thinking on your ways this morning and you want to come to the altar this morning believe we get a time this morning to spend some time with God crowing time but a man I'm calling it you enemy prayed for you wanna spend some time on the altar there's one is anyone else you wanna change this morning you don't want to go home the same way you came today but God has spoken to your soul he's spoken to your heart and he's calling her a better walk a better talk a better life
