Corinthians chapter 7 verse 1 Romans 13 reading from 8 to 14 owe no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another had fulfilled the law for this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not be false witness Thou shalt not CET if there any be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou sh love thy neighbor as thyself amen love wickedness no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law and that knowing the time that now is it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkness not in clambering chambering and wanness not in strife and Envy in put he on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not Provisions for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof 2 Corinthians chapter 7:1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all the filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfect and Holiness in the fear of god let's pray father we thank you for your word and may your word become flesh tonight may it bring the clarity of what you require of us and what we are called to anoint and what we are called to receive and what we are called to be part of granted father in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus we love him tonight it's always a blessing to come into the house of God we wouldn't always have privileges this privilege they're going to close us down praise God so all the Ten Commandments could be summarized in two love the Lord thy go with all thy heart and love your neighbor as yourself so I have a title this morning tonight and the title I have is um the night is far spent the day is at hand the night is fast spent the day is at hand amen oh blessed be the name the night in the Amplified is far gone and the day is almost here let us just drop fling away the works and the Deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light let us live and conduct ourselves honorably and be commonly as in the open light of day not in reving carousing and drunkenness not in immorality and debauchery sensuality and Lous not in quarreling and jealousy but clothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah and make no Provisions for indulging the flesh or put a stop to thinking about the evil Cravings of your physical nature to gratify its desires and lust oh blessed be the name of the Lord so that is what this is all about this is when the tire hit the road this is where we coming into genuine Christianity praise God how God want us to be and Paul said warning and teaching every man to be perfect in Christ Jesus and his objective of the Gospel was to get Christ into the people his objective of the Gospel was to point them to Jesus Christ and that's why he said I come among you not with enticing words of man wisdom because when you come with man's Wisdom it look very impressive the man who bringing that wisdom but he said I come with you with the power of God that your faith May rest not in the wisdom of man but in the power of God when you see the power of God you know that is not Man's power that is God's power and man can't do that it's only God could do that so then you have faith in God Give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah when the man come out wise with his intellect and his knowledge and his information and his Revelation then he's very impressive he know more than any anybody else but when God come and do is shut the M of the critics and take take let let the intellectual take a seat oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Revelation 71 after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind shall not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor any tree and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God this seal is not from anybody praise God is not the post office seal there not man seal this a mortgage you put your seal on it this is the Seal of the Living God and he cried with the Lord voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea understand the Angels himself have a commission to hurt the earth and the Sea and saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of God God in their foreheads and I heard the number of them which were sealed and they were seal 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel and if the Jews have to be sealed what about the Gentiles if God going to receive the Jews by a sealing what about this bride of Jesus Christ there's got to have a ceiling there must have a ceiling oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen praise God from souls and PR prison the prophet was praying he said Lord Jesus I have done the best that I know of now now remember he had a vision of Hell God took him down through some things and he saw all the howling he saw all the behavior and everything else and the woman with the with the makeup and everything else and when he came on earth years later he saw it as a young man he saw them with this thing and it shook him up then he got it to see it hell is on the earth then he said the lid of hell has been covered and streams of demon powers did not stop him they're coming from hell it's a bottomless put down there you know and streams of demon power you can't fight that in yourself you need a higher power so if hell has been uncovered God come and send seven angels to unlock Heaven praise God and seven angels come from eternity to bring down the whole of Heaven and the Earth and Heaven consists of the word so once the word is here then Heaven is here also praise God when the enemy come like a flood the spirit of God praise the standard in every age God have somebody to fight back what the devil lose Oh Glory to God be it Eagle be it man praise God be it lion praise God be it Ox he always have a power to fight back the Beast system Oh Glory to God and God raise up an end time Pride to fight back oh give the Lord a shout don't tell me that you're weak let the weak say I am strong Give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God you were born for this hour you will raise up for this hour Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the night is fast spent is years and hours in this message the day is at hand the day of the Lord the day of Jesus Christ the day of adoption oh give the Lord I shout your day is coming arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of God will be risen upon you you talk about a rock and shaken time gross Darkness cover the Earth gross Darkness cover the people but your light going to come oh give the Lord a shout shall be light in the evening time oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah and he is praying Lord Jesus I have done the best I know how I have done all I know how Grant Lord that the mercy doors are still open of these hundreds and hundreds seeking thee at this time they were seeking God when he preaches message souls in prison take away every sinful blood Lord take them in today I plead with all my heart as we see not only somebody talking but the scripture itself bringing us to this hour that the vision of a little boy seeing those people in that condition and now think that hell itself Mercy has been blooded from the earth and now hell itself is here and the people Lord is in That Hideous condition ohmighty God on this elected church I pray God that you will pour out your blessings that they might receive a Ministry of testimony like lot had like Noah had like Jesus had unto the Eternal loss if it be there that they themselves are sealed into the kingdom of God you have to be sealed into the kingdom of God to have the testimony like lot had like Abraham had oh like Noah had oh you yourself being sealed in the kingdom of God sealed until the day of your Redemption Oh Glory sealed in where the devil

individual and elected you to this to face this hour what a blessing you should be coming here praising thanking God joy in your soul a joy in your heart to be alive in the land of the living to face 2024 Oh Glory to God knowing that the word the kingdom of God is at hand that day is at hand praise God hallelujah all right let's hit the road running tonight brother Bram he said we believe that all these great benefits that we enjoy today in this Christian economy we have was purchased at Calvary by the Son of God Jesus Christ he was wounded for transgression he was Bru all iniquities the chastisement of a peace was upon him and B CH we are healed it's all past tense it is something God has done for us at Calvary and as Christians we have a right to enjoy these blessings that he purchased for us oh God help me tonight we have a right don't tell me I can't have joy don't tell me I can't have peace don't tell me I can't have Revival don't tell me I can't have the Holy Ghost don't tell me don't tell me if the Lord I shout glory to God if your wife miserable you don't have to be miserable if your husband Cy you don't have to be cranky God purchased this thing for you it is something God has done for us at Calvary and as Christians we have the right to enjoy these blessings that he has purchased for us so therefore no man could save another it have to be so Jesus didn't have to die and when Jesus died at Calvary he settled the sin question forever and every man every creature on earth when he died was saved at that very minute the price was paid completely it was so met that God identified that it was true and the only thing we have to do is to receive this to accept it to believe it and accept it and no matter how much he died for our Salvation we must ourself accept it as our own own personal experience as our own desire praise God that's why the Bible can explicitly say haven dear for these promises let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit you can't be Godly one day and filthy next day you can't be in and out and no no no no no he has be holy for I am Holy he said cleanse yourself sanctify Yourself clean your act up oh pull yourself together pull yourself up by the bootstrap don't stay as you are come on man we born in sin shape iniquity he don't expect us to stay in iniquity and stay in sin the gospel come to wash us to purge us to cleanse us to send fire upon us that is what the gospel come to do oh give the Lord a shout I'm not worthy to un loose his shoes but he that cometh after me he's going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost on Fire Fire cast the demons out fire cast the lust out fire cast this out that out whatever you have said of you fire handles it you are here Shou in the house Tabernacle glory to God do I hear somebody saying amen all right Hallelujah we must want to be saved and believe that upon the basis of his shed blood that we are saved after we met the recomends of the Bible here we go I believe in the Bible being the full revelation of Jesus Christ nothing to add to it nothing to take away it it is the full revelation of Jesus Christ now I do believe that God can do things that are not written in the Bible because he's God but as long as we can find it in the Bible as a promise then we know it's true because the word is true always so we believe him to keep his promise now we believe he's infinite being infinite he know all things he know all things he know he will be sitting right here tonight right he is is he's he is go he or if he's not infinite he isn't God so we believe that the word this Bible is the word of God and therefore you can hang your soul upon any phase of it that's the only way you can have faith is to believe faith has to have an anchor place somewhere it must anchor on a place and nothing could be more solid than the word of God because the word is God that's what the Bible teaches remember Sunday service not your feelings not your emotions not your color not your hair not your height not your complexion the word is God not your dream not your thoughts not your ideas but the word is God as long as the word said it you could hold to it you could say God you said so you could say God you can't lie you say God you promised me the Holy Ghost oh God you promis the Deliverance if I cry out unto you you will answer and I come to you tonight oh glory to God give the Lord some Praises now because him being infinite omnipotent omnipresent he cannot be one without the other infinite omn poent omnipresent isn't that right and to be God he has to be all of it therefore being finite as we are this year we can work on something we think we got it perfect next year we have to change our mind is different we found something better because we are finite but he is infinite and and and when he says a word is forever that way he could never be improved it could never be taken back if God was calling the scene in any case and the way God acted on that scene the first time he must forever act the same way when he's calling the scene again because if he act different if he did the first time then something is wrong it would not be perfect therefore he acted wrong when he acted the first time isn't that right therefore when God made a remedy for man to be saved in the Garden of Eden they tried to improve this remedy through 6,000 years and could never touch it he made it upon the basis of the shed blood Oh Glory to God in kangali he never changed it he never tried to educate people to Christ we Tred to denominate them to Christ we try all kind of systems and it all failed we will never be all one group we will never be all one church is by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body oh give the Lord a shout glory to God give the Lord a shout in the house is only the spirit can baptize all into one body glory to God Amen there's only one place that man can meet on the common ground of worship that is under the shed blood of of Jesus Christ it's always been that way from the beginning because he cannot change it it's always the blood isn't that right and today we think that we are different from the other fellow and so forth it does not work we must still accept the basis of the shed blood and therefore when God has called on the scene to heal a man he heal a man on the basis of his feet and when he call on the scene again he will heal the man the same way or he acted wrong if God ever did heal a man because he believ the next man call calls upon the same kind of faith God is obligated to do the same thing for the next man if not he's a respector of persons and acted wrong in the first place oh glory to God you see back to the world I believe it with all my heart now we expecting God to do great things for us how many can say Amen to that I want everybody in the church but here who would hear the tape who online we have to be expecting God to do great things not come to church expect God to do great things glory to God come here H him expect God to do great things what his great things he open the Red Sea what do you want him to do for you he multiply bread and fish what does he

pancreas he could give you new body new bones whatever it is whatever you have need of he transforms Sarah he transformed Abraham we expect God to do great things elishah said a double portion of of your spirit hey Hallelujah he was asking for great things you ask a hard thing oh glory to God but if you see me go you can have it you can have it if you want it God don't want you to ask for little

manifestation of God to totir the bride it will take them seven tunders to wake up the bride he will send it not brother to you going to bring it not Pastor jul going and bring it not some man of the hour or pope of the hour going and bring it he will send it wait till he send it wait till them seven Thunders after the voices of that group that could take the and hand it there they going to slice and cut and shut the mouth of the critics oh give the Lord a shout let them laugh now now is the time to laugh let them mock now now it's time to mock but God will have a witness and God will not be mocked what a man saw he's going to reap and every man will get his own reward oh give the Lord a shout in the house we coming on to Brass now oh glory to God amen amen amen amen he's the one on obligation because he's the the one who said it amen and we're only quoting what he said he's the same yesterday today and forever that is why I express it the first time the Bible is either truth or it isn't truth therefore in when the Bible say anything you can hold on to it for God is obligated to this word so if the Bible said behold I send you Malachi for Elijah the prophet if the Bible said that that's God's word a man have to come out of that to identify as that Elijah and if God said in he he placed gifts in the body pastors teachers Prophet evangelist some men have to come and manifest that that is not just a scripture you know that is word made flesh praise God that go unveil and have a name on it oh give the Lord a shout Christ go be veiled in that fightful Ministry it will be the ministry of Jesus Christ we give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah let's go he was born St John CH chapter 1 he started the first chapter he was born we know his birth how the angel Gabriel announced it Mary's mother how she conceived by the Holy Spirit how at the age of 30 years old he was baptized by his second cousin John the Baptist immediately he was taken to the Wilderness for Temptation for 40 days then returned back in the power of the spirit in the power of the Holy Spirit he returned to his ministry you see what that phrase so he can come and Messiah explain John and explain Moses and Ezekiel and here no God make Jesus pass the RO he had to go and face Lucifer one on one no Elder no Deon no py behind him some men like to walk py you know see walk about 10 men you know 10 man plus one go to face the devil 10 + one py plus one Jesus alone and when he finish so he returned the power of the spirit yes sir he returned to his ministry now remember so but I'm tying watch this he just identified the ministry of Jesus Christ how God administered it or how God unfolded it and listen to what he says right after that and remember he forbid the disciples to preach anymore or do anything until they went in the power of the spirit is so he connected when he get to the Wilderness he came what in the power of the spirit so now brother bandam is tying it with the promise of the upper room now he said remember he forbid the disciples to preach anymore or do anything until they went in the power of the spirit wait ye in the city of Jerusalem until be do power from on high you are not to go out until it's not you but God the people can see the reflection of Jesus Christ in you so this is more detailing what this power is all about now because Peter deny Christ Peter cuss Peter cut off man ears that's brother Peter that's not Jes Jesus so whatever they was to get in the upper room was to transform that that instead of brother Peter have a reflection with his anger temper and his bad behavior Christ could [Applause] be in other words other words God didn't want Peter's eloquence eloquence and no life could talk nice eloquent speaker he want to know what life is there amen all right so let's let's let's go again let's let's dig deep here now so God watch so you are not to go out until it's not you but God the people can see the reflection of Jesus Christ in you then the people will believe then because it won't be you it will be him they had to take note that they had Jesus been with Jesus not take note P that I know I know him no no take note that been with Jesus because they start to resemble Jesus and start to do what Jesus did we say Amen tonight all right so then the people will believe then because it won't be you it will be him and all he he will call they will see it my sheep know my voice now we notice then immediately when he entered into his ministry so you see now we have to enter into this new ministry by the spirit because the prophet prophesying message of Grace the church will be rebuilt in the power of the spirit and that is how your hearts will be turned back to the Fai of the fathers so right now the church has been built by the word which is mechanics but the rebuilding of the church is by Dynamics and the ministry has to come into Dynamics for the church to be rebuilt and the ministry of the spirit is what quickens the word to the bride so right now you're still on your way to your quickening Oh Glory to God so when the ministry per comes now and and and this is what happens now when that Ministry comes you find what happened Cornelius acts 10 why Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell Holy Ghost fell not not talked fell they don't like that in the message because it's not Fallen among them but the Holy Ghost fell say fell you like water fall on you right the Holy Ghost to fall on you then a dunk a bucket had to drop on you fell you might fall with it but it Go fa it go fall on you oh give the Lord a shout in it you may fall right down on the ground with it you may roll on the floor with it you might even speak with tongues with it but it have to fall on you oh give the Lord a shout God we getting somewhere tonight Hallelujah feel old fashioned tonight oh glory to God I feel like I getting drunk up here tonight oh glory to God said drunk new wine here hallelujah you know why there do this bring stimulation you know water can't do that you know water a man standing stiff stiff stiff talking word word word word word but when it bring stimulation you get groggy sometimes you maybe me stagger sometimes you might to stand up so straight Oh Glory to God these people are not drunk as you suppose Oh Glory to God but this is new wine this is the wine of Charity this is a wine of the love of God Amen this a wine of the Dynamics to the mean there's the wine of the word turned to Spirit that is power hey glory to God hallelujah when the word turned to Spirit you know the bride is on on the march my Lord my Lord wooo Glory all right let's continue here now Matthew 25 familiar scripture then was T the kingdom of heaven like not the 10 virgins we took the lamps went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them in the message were wise five of them in the message were foolish squat in here but both in the message just making sure it get clear we don't want to take five foolish get something out there a missed no we don't want message folks five stripp message five foolish stripp however you want to say it that doesn't sound polish Bible say foolish foolish songs more elegant but it's stupid because they know he's coming they have the own interpretation he coming just now so I don't need extra oil ouch you'll hear how the bridegroom carried you see there Revelation say it happened so so so so so so so and their preparation comes with their Revelation but that is not what God coming God doesn't come to man's thinking and man's idea so let's read on they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them they have confidence they confidently foolish they not they took the vessels with no oil in there but the wi took o in the vessels with the lamps while the bridegroom tared watch that word t they all slumbered and slept so as far as we concerned always positive bre yeah we slumbering we sleeping we are lamp we are oil at midnight there was a cry made behold the bradom coming go you out to meet him then all the virgins arose trim their lamps so they had oil but they didn't have extra oil they were content with what they have they were content with their minister with the Revelation with the interpretation with the understanding they were content with what he explained them away he explain them away from the Holy Ghost so they had the word the word more word on to of word word on top of word and no Spirit to light of that word no water for the word he said Rebecca she had watered the camel and the same camel she water is what took her to Isaac and he said you water the cam water the word by your Praises so every dumb church and every church with Satan sitting down on on top the lip but can't praise and worship God you know what happening there Revelation material material there material have oil in it have spirit in it have Worship in it have atmosphere with it all those version last and the foolish said unto wise give us of your oil for our Lambs are going out the Greek says our lamps are going out what a terrible thing to know that what you have you have it's not that they have nothing in they any message they have the books they have the tapes they have Revelation they understand the trumpets and the V and the words lots of mysteries oh my God they could explain that to the pope but the oil running out you're watching your oil running out and the bridegroom not there yet you can't go out and meet the bridegroom because it going out but the wise answer not so I could see a fool say kindness wrong time said that 5 years ago the wife said not so least they're not enough for us and you I would like to give you but what I have here I had to make sure this take me through amen go rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves while they went to buy they understood then in the message that a price had to be paid to break through into the Holy Ghost they were willing now to pay the price it's just it wasn't available Brown one time the last drop in the bucket will be finished there be no more Holy Ghost so I hope this still you tonight I hope there still your desire tonight yes sir for God to fill you with his Spirit while they went to BU the bridegroom came and did that were ready shout out ready ready that's what the message come to do not get us churchy get us ready they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterwards came the other virgin saying Lord open to us and he answered said I know you not but brandom the first thing you know the time will come when God will give a message and you'll be sealed in or out of the kingdom of God that's right we need the oldfashioned gospel back in the church back to the word of God and a lot of this nonsense and foolishness cut off he said it a lot of the nonsense and foolishness cut off a seal of God is a sign of completion that's right that's when they put on the seal when the thing is completed you stamp it and you seal it you approve it a sign is completion isn't that right and you talk about the box car when the inspector comes he looks in to see if everything is tight or he won't seal it you got to tear it down and do it over again and that is what God has been doing with his church for a long time you load up you're going to heaven you're taking everything with you your card games everything you can load into the church you're trying to take it with you god condemns it you ain't ready for sealing so you have to be ready for sealing he said but when a God sees a man contrite broken Spirit sincere in heart D at the altar God closes the door the world to him and seals him in dear by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it lasts until Jesus come not from one Revival to another but until the day of your Redemption could the church say Amen could the believer say Amen so the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption without the Holy Spirit you are not sealed let me say it again without the Holy Spirit you are not sealed but the holy spirit is God sealed Oh Glory to God Hall the holy spirit is God's sealed Oh Glory what's the Holy Spirit Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness isn't that right seven perfect Spirits oh the Lord I shout and the bride will be sealed by those seven spirits seven births Oh Glory to God Seven births Hallelujah sealed with the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah the Seal of God is the birth right the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what Jacob fought for he wanted that Birthright isn't that right that's why God say I love Jacob because he want the birth right it was the Holy Ghost brother brand the mark of the beast is on today and the Seal of God is the Holy Spirit to reject it is the mark of the beast in the message whoever who sees the holy ghost that you are supposed to receive and don't do it automatically you take the mark of the beast because there are only two classes that exist all that didn't have the seed of God had the mark of the beast so to receive the seed of God is to receive the Holy Ghost to reject it is to take the mark of the beast praise God he said we ended off last night in Ezekiel the 9th chapter how many read it he said he seen six men come from the higher gate and they had slaughtering weapons remember did you notice it was designated only to Jerusalem but watch because God deal with the Gentiles as individuals now we find out before the slaughter went forth listen now don't miss this before the slaughter Slaughter when fought that word is used in the Bible Slaughter but the BR said millions will die Millions he seen a man come with dress for in white what does white represent righteousness of saints now a writer incor by his side he went through the city first Jerusalem set a seal upon those who s and cry for the Abomination and then the city that's right you Bible readers and then when the slaughter went forth he said don't spare old young children Bab babies whatever it is utterly destroy everything that doesn't have this Mark was nothing left they either received the seal or they did not have the seal and that's the reason this day we coming in we are coming right to it in a minute here in the New Testament the seed of God is the Holy Ghost and outside of that is for the slaughter amen did you hear that he said we come into that into the New Testament and the seed of God is the Holy Ghost and outside of that is the slaughter want to read Ezekiel 9 now he called this is Ezekiel 9 he cried also in my ear with the Lord voice read on Sunday cause them that have a charge over the city to draw near every man with his TR weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which Li towards the North and every man a slau a weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writers incor by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the briis alar my Lord my Lord there's not a pastor there's not a brother there's not an elder this is a man with the ink horn isn't that right watch and the glory of the god of Israel was G up from the Cherub where upon he was to the treas of the house and he called to the mantle with linen which had the righteous inor inside and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a m so let's say this way go in the message amen go through every Church in Trinidad every church around the world go to Every pastor and set a mark upon the forest of the men that s and cry for all the Abomination that turn in the midst thereof until the others he said in M air go ye after him seal comes first Slaughter after seal come first judgment after the true gets anointed first and the false get anointed after go have a clear distinction of the bright from the church go you after into the City and smite let not your eyes spear neither have you P so this is a destruction angel angel come to W through God tell the angel do my pity here who to slay and I hope this bring a burden here tonight and those who would hear it those in this church here who are slackers we talking about slack parenting poor parenting no bden whatsoever the children get away with murder all kind of crap slay utterly old and young old people in it young people in it both maids and little children little children and wom everybody covered old grandma grandpa children little children so what that means that us parents have to have a burden for them because little children can't apply it to themselves the parents have to be the token for them to get the Seal of God upon them and burden for them to get that Mark I hope everybody in the church will say Amen to that amen then they begin at the ancient men which were before the house because judgment begins in the house of God but when you see the Abomination making desolation stand in a holy place after the coming of Titus after Jesus had left the Holy Spirit was the man with the incor at his side so identify who that is the holy spirit was that man with the incor at his side and he went to Jerusalem and set a mark upon the people now I want you to notice something church member and you CL clim to have the Holy Spirit he said don't seal any of them but them that s and cry for the Abomination down the city in other words don't seal the filthy don't seal the unrighteous don't seal the ungodly don't seal the liar don't seal the disrespectful don't seal the unsanctified don't seal the sodomites don't seal the backbiters don't seal the haters in the message don't seal the bullet sisters don't seal them they that don't listen to their husband don't seal them is this the word don't seal butam now where is anybody so burdened about the world now and their condition well I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist I'm a presbyterian so what difference does it make I'm many message my pass so I go to this church what difference you have this seal is this real or not that's why any church that think that they are it is Liars The People deceive they the bride here right where stre and Believers there what you talking about Pastor cuckoo he under delusion in his head he is deceived and he de the people with it to like if they are special I a special group in that where you get that from a lion man man pit lying to the people this is the word but say I'm Methodist I'm a Baptist Presbyterian so what difference does it make they say oh not that constant burden for the loss that sweetness don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul there a key there's a key there's a major key I know people rotting and cankering on the inside because they're bitter they're hateful and angry I know people with money in this message and they're still not happy they're not happy because the caner is in their soul they have every reason to shout and praise God and not shouting and praising God I oh my goodness don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul no matter how bad anyone ever treats you or anything don't never don't be guilty of letting that thing anchor in your soul let it go let it go how much time you preach it drop it drop it drop it it affects your inner soul it affects your inner being it will affect you you will miss the Rapture for having bitterness in your soul don't be guilty of letting that thing anchor in your soul it will grieve the holy spirit away from you it certainly will to see whether this message was connected to it or not the very hour that Israel was signing as a nation is the very same hour the very same day the very same month I was at Green Mills inana when that angel appeared to me and sent me out on the field with this and he met me down on the river and told me what would take place then commission me 11 years later at the same hour that Israel was signed as a nation it's all connected together amen then he said his words see the angel of the Lord is on it now he is moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord the angel of the Lord is active and present fixing things around for the coming of the Lord you're almost finished car please 1914 the world went to war they have never been at peace constantly swinging swinging doing this very same thing holding he say oh God have mercy holding that great thing that I saw in the vision the whole thing become to D destruction holding the atomic holding the wars that they destroy that they don't destroy themselves isn't it amazing that this big Mighty power superow called Russia seem to be sted by Ukraine it is an amazing thing you know Russia have nuclear weapons Russia is a superpower and it's almost as if something is holding back Russia will conquer Ukraine it has to be not David and gol know this is one devil one country on next devil is is his principalities and powers and thing you know going on there you know want to conquer and whatnot you know because Russia will become the terror of America Russia will become God judgment Rod of America the bombs will come from Russia to bomb Rome and America nothing will stop it Gog and may go we preached that some couple of months and years ago watch the King of the North Oh Glory to God you can't stop the King of the North the King of the North is the king of the north we not talking about Putin we talking about Russia itself we know how long Putin going to laugh but Russia is Russia and God anoint Russia for a purpose and put it in their heart to do a certain thing just like he put Nebuchadnezzar hallelujah oh glory to godall holding back to Wars that they don't destroy themselves until the thing comes to destroy it until Israel returns back and get herself together and then the message will go to Israel and she'll be sealed with the seed of the Holy ghosten but before the angel could go to seal them there's a prde that has to be sealed do you see it Oh Glory to God hallelujah and if that man with the incor writer was the Holy Ghost we realize that everybody reads the Bible so is this same angel coming again with the Holy Ghost the seed of the Living God yes sir so I want to exalt you tonight time to get a burden for the family for the BR um the scriptures from second 2 Thessalonians 2 now I besee you Brethren by the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ by our gather together in him that you be not so soon shaken in mind or be ye troubled by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as of the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except they come of Fallen away first are we seeing that now we seen it now people 30 years and they falling away they just fall people just backside people just giving up they giving up Are Falling Away people who say the name of the book and and like the name lost from the book they take the name of the book I don't know but they Fallen away and the man of sin be revealed the son of pedition who opposed and exalted himself above all that is called God that is worship so that he as God s in the temple of God should himself that he is God remember ye not I I was yet with you I told you these things for the mystery of iniquity that already work only he who now let it would let until he be taken out of the way and then that Wicked will be revealed whom the Lord will consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and line wonders this is the part I want to get to verse 10 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish here why here why because they receive not the love of the truth amen that they might be saved amen they don't have a love of the truth you see America like conspiracy theories any lie anything and a bunch of people like I don't know they just following anything any any crazy any crazy thing hear this part for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie you see what not loveing the truth causes even if the truth hurts love it you must want the truth because you shall know the truth and the truth is what going to set you free so I want to encourage you get a love for truth don't want a love what you want to hear as a confirmation to your lust or your Idols in your heart that's what we read on Sunday God say I will answer them by their Idols in their heart there some people come and they have certain things in their heart and the minister say that a confirmation to inside their heart I know a brother say he always want to hear about the Trump some some brother come about Trump and he going he going he going with the Trump man because he always longing to know we what supposed to do for you Trump changing your family Trump putting Bread on your table you want to why Trump trump putting in your rampt you want know Trump you want to know about the violence want and somebody oh god oh now know what the violence is then what then what your lust get Vindicated your idol get Vindicated you get Vindication because dream about the violence and I'm preach the vience and you confirmation because you about the vience I remember years ago a man say going preach on v i i myself I let he sent to confirm this of God God he will have a son his wife was pregnant when he talk about that V I fly the church you know he had he had a daughter but at that time as a as a young believer I just wasn't prepared for a man to put vials on me and preach vials to me I just feel he was going and do some kind of thing VI I want Holy Ghost I want vience I want God I want to be like Jesus I want V keep your vs so let me say it again because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved for this cause God shall send them a strong delusion that why they say God say show them and God show them and God show them and they ly on God they they see an illusion and they believe that they should believe a lie and that they might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness because because you cannot believe the devil lie unless they reject God's truth God has present the truth first and you have to reject truth to receive a li all right let me just close up here each Church age is describe of its spiritual condition talk about the church ages each Church age can hold behold Itself by its scriptural and spiritual speaking to them as the spirit speaks each age can behold itself each age bore the True Vine of Christ I never saw this one before this particular each age bore the True Vine of Christ the wise virgin each age bore the grafted Vine the foolish virgin so the foolish virgin is grafted in to the same Vine oh give the Lord some Praises I'll close this question here brother brandham question are the five foolish versions of of Matthew 25 counted as a gentile Remnant I understand that the fivefold virgins were saved but have to go through the Great Tribulation period is this correct if so what will be their final destination could they be the Sheep which are divided from the goats in Matthew 2533 224 pretty good toosan but R says the sleeping virgin is the remnant spoke of in Revelation of the woman seed that keep the Commandments of God have the testimony of Jesus Christ a woman will take a piece of goods lay it down what has she cut in takes her pattern and lays it wherever she desires which way she going to cut that and then what she has left over is called The Remnant and she chooses to cut it from a certain place by her own free thinking what is left over is called The Remnant now if you notice there were five foolish five wise virgins all of them virgins made out of the same material but by election that's why you can Rejoice tonight God chooses bride by election before the foundation of the world put the names on the lamb Book of Life slay before the F of the world before the world ever began God in his mind being infinite so then the foolish virgins begin to play something was the one who did not have oil in their lamps that I believe that was cast into outer Darkness where there'll be weeping and willing nashing of teeth and if you compare that with your footnotes it will run right back to the Great Tribulation I think they are the ones who stays back and goes through the Great Tribulation yes so friends in the message you will see them come and said give me some of that oil you would lift to see that people actually asking for the oil yes but guess what the spirit is the word and the word is the spirit so you have to have the word in you that could turn into spirit and if the word not in you it cannot what in you can turn the way it's supposed to let's all stand and Worship the Lord father God we thank you for
