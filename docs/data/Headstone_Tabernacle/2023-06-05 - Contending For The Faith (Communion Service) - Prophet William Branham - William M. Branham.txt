to put that on I mean you may have your seats now at this time amen let's put it on God bless you amen we do not we can do anything as our ministers Ministry doesn't feature Divine Healing but we believe in Divine Healing because it's the Gospels and no man can heal anyone healing doesn't lay in the power of man healingly in the power of God and God doesn't give man power to heal God only gave Christ the the commission to come to the Earth to die in our state for our sins and our sickness the scripture said he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were were at the past tense we were healed and we believe that Upon Our confession our faith for Jesus our high priest has died and rose again to take away sin from the world and is sitting at the right hand of God the Father they are making intercessions Upon Our confession and when he died for our sins he could not die for sins without dying for sickness sickness is an attribute of sin now maybe you haven't sinned is what causes you to be sick but it was a cause of sin in the first place that brought sickness to the world before we ever had any sin we had no sickness but when sickness came in sin is an attribute and now you cannot deal with sin in any way without dealing with sickness or ever attribute that sin produced sin when we deal with sin we deal with death when we deal in sickness there is a the first stage of death when sickness takes your body in a night like this one little gathering two days notice for you people to come out and gather in the building tonight it would be hard to try to go into detail which we would and campaigns where we're lasting for weeks and weeks to explain what is thickness where does it come from there has been nothing but what there's a reason for and there's a cause and you can't find a cure until you find a Cause I was staying here not long ago if I went to a doctor I'm certainly not against doctors surgeons operations hospitals they're all God's planes but if I went to a doctor and told him I was having a persistent headache give me a aspirin say now run along Billy this will be all right that man aged me off see he the old a real doctor would diagnose lactation see what was wrong with me then he'd get to the bottom where it's at and then start working from there well now that's the way we had to work in Divine Healing or in Salvation for the soul if a man comes and says that he's Disturbed greatly about his his salvation the first thing to do you ministers do you go right down the line do you find back here or he sidestepped or what happened from there you bring it up that's the same thing it is in Divine Healing which Divine meaning is not some power that God has given to a man healing lays alone in the atonement I want to ask you something because I know there's ministers here from the different churches and how would you preach salvation for the soul the only things you could not say we say well I was converted brother Branham I was saved 10 years ago I was saved 20 years ago no that's a mistake you accepted it maybe 10 or 20 years ago but you were saved 1900 years ago when Jesus died of Calvary he settled a sin question forever there that's where he paid the Supreme prize made the great sacrifice that through his death of Calvary then we have rights of Salvation the price is paid so it isn't what you do it's what he does and your personal faith has to accept that brings your salvation and now that he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed so if I've often made this statement that you couldn't um that you could not by any means uh if a serpent or some animal had his paw in my side and was cut into my side and killing me there's no need to be trying to cut his palm just to hit him in the head kill his head he kills the whole body well that's the way it is when Jesus dealt with sickness or sin of Calvary he has to deal with the head of it which was sin and doing so he dealt with sickness with it he didn't have to cut off the call he just killed the head and take care of the rest of it so Jesus come to bring to the human race everything that Adam's race was Adam's sin destroyed and the Garden of Eden and now we have the attributes are the earnest of our Eternal salvation as we accept Christ as our savior our crisis our healer we have those earnest money of our entire Redemption when he comes we're attempting all of us are tempted all of us sin there's none without sin every day you see Paul said he had to Die daily and if we say we sin and have no sin then the Bible says we make God that's alive and we could not do that so we sin daily and it's Grace God's grace that saves us and as we confess our loans God's just to forgiven and your your confession as long as it holds Good your salvation is perfect same as it with Divine Healing it's your personal faith and a resurrected Lord Jesus so tonight I thought I would just inherit this little time of fellowship with you and in this place where all churches can this little group of people can just gather together here and the little city of Georgetown and we personally want to be thankful to the Brother Art and Wright and those who made this possible we want to thank the school board for letting us have this gym room tonight for this service and I want to thank every minister of the chair and every member of any church whether it is Protestant Catholic whether it is orthodox a Jew whatever it may be we're grateful for you to be here and want you to know that we've got no strains or no attachments on anyone's religion whatever you believe as long as you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and he's your savior you're my brother and sister and so that's the way we believe it and now we had his blessed word here before us now these any man that's able to to pull that back to his fingers could open it this way but there's no man can open the book to understanding except Christ the Bible was written by inspiration therefore shall we just our head the moment to speak to the author before we open his book Our Kind Heavenly Father we have gathered here in the name of God beloved Son the Lord Jesus who died freely for our sins and trespasses he died that he might save us from a life of sin and would take us home to Heaven some glorious day at his coming he died also that by Stripes that we might be healed of our sickness and he was wounded for our transgressions his bruised for our iniquity the chasmine of our peace was up on him and with his stripes we were healed saith the prophet now we pray thee heavenly father to be merciful to us and that we just had this one night of gathering here in this city we pray that you'll bless those who has made this possible for the Gathering and also those who have gathered with us the fellowship around the word and we pray father that you'll bless everyone that's in divine presence also and may it be a night to Long be remembered may it be a night like the apostolic Gathering of Days of Gold when people gather together little groups one night while the Saint Paul was preaching way into the night a young man we're taught fell from the epistory and his life was taken from him and Paul laid his body over the boy God gave him back his life we're thankful to have the same gospel tonight to preach to the people that God still lives and Reigns he he's sick he forgives all of our sins and father we pray tonight it's your blessed as a people and now thou has said in our humble word this if you ask the father anything in my name I'll do it he believed that what we ask we receive because it's according to his word and when we leave here tonight in different groups and going to our different homes will you visit us in such a way that we'll have a testimony in our heart and our conversation as we leave here will be like those who came from Emmaus on the first resurrection when they had met the resurrected Lord Jesus for the first time they said do not our hearts burn within us when he talked to us by the way may you talk to every heart tonight for we ask it in the name of God beloved Son the Lord Jesus amen open to the gospel of Saint Jude in the Bible which is only one book one chapter and then the third verse of this chapter I wish to read for just a little text to get a context from it for what I'd like to speak on for the next few moments then we will pray for the sake I gave all Jones are the common common to you and to exalt you that you should earnestly contend for the faith once delivered unto the Saints may the Lord add His blessings to his word this was wrote some 33 years after the day of Pentecost I said the reporting out of the Holy Spirit on the early Saints Jude calls himself a servant and brother to Jesus Christ and he wrote this book to the church and told them that they should earnestly contend the only patience sacred riding that's ever told us to contend because we're not supposed to have contentions among us but the earnestly contend for a purpose of faith that was once delivered unto the Saints and that we're not too content and we're not trying to contend but we are wanting to face this if I should ask tonight how many methodists is in the crowd how many Baptists was in the crowd how many nazarenes Pilgrim holding this Catholic to be hands growth and even this little group of people here tonight there will be many hands go up and each one of us in our different denominations would want to say our church was continuing for that faith that was once delivered to the Saints Dr Baptist Church and someone else you want to say it about the Methodist Church someone else about the Catholic church and some other about it would be that way in the little groups of people now I want to believe that we're all contending for that pain I believe that everyone is contending for the best of their knowledge to the faith but in this thing so many different denominations there's got to be something right and something wrong now that's the way I try to be my brother sister that there's you never seen a man Drop in sober at the same time you never seen a black white bird there's no such a thing and there's no right wrong mixed together it's either right or it's wrong and that's the way that I believe God if I didn't believe that he was the same God that lived in the days of Moses if he wasn't the same God to fulfill every promise that he made then I couldn't have faith to accept it now there's only that's only sensible and reasonable to think that what good would it do us tonight you're not here just to be seen you wouldn't come out this ring together in a little place like this just to be seen you're here for one purpose that's it find something good and I pray that God will give each one of you something real good that you'll never forget and each one of you Christians made me raise your joy to him to cause you to serve him better than you've ever served him and all your life now what good would it do to serve a God that served Moses a God that Moses served and if he wasn't the same God today what group would he do to serve a historical God if you know if he's powerless and gone and dead today I want to answer that question you would want to do it maybe at all if I can serve a God that's a living invite your presence to help me when I have need say what to use the serving God if he was a God but he isn't a God now or if he was a god of power he's lost his power now there's something weakening about that God isn't that right now we want to reason together there's something wrong if it isn't if he was and he is but now then there's something wrong with God if if God doesn't agree might be a warrior and battle and he was a great healer of the diseases and he was a great in all this tribute in the days gone by and then he's lost all of his power and he isn't the same today yet his word says He is the same today promise you do the very same thing through all ages until he come again it's undisputable in the Bible Hebrews did 8 13 a 13 8 whether says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's the same in principle the same in power the same and Resurrection the same and ominous the same and omnipresence the famous and and all he's just the same as he was in everything that he once was he is today the Church says that's true all things of him is the same now so if we each want to believe that but yet limited to a Creed well they say I'll go to the Baptist Church I'll say Baptist because that's the church I was already in say I uh well the Baptist over our Creed's right the methodists were still Creed right but if we live a God that Creed I have nothing against it that's all right but if we limit God to that Creed then we limit God and we try to say that you can walk this far maybe we don't have the faith to walk where Enoch did when he took a little walk with God one afternoon and went home with him without death and um and the barcel of Joshua who marched around the walls of Jericho 13 times and and shot it real loud and the walls fell down we may not have the faith to shut down walls we may not have faith to walk home with God but let's not stand in somebody's way who does have that faith if it doesn't agree with our truth and they ask Faith let's move right on and please say the Lord bless you my brother and though I don't regardless of what church he belongs to that's makes no difference as long as he's a Christian and believer and do you know Christian friends that's what the world wanted to see today I landed in Bombay India where I had the largest crowd of 500 000 people I I was the Crowder Ever preached to him at one time in my life was in Bombay one on that there here comes the bishop of the Methodist Church and many of the Great churches right from the Archbishop it's a Hindu hinduist Church there and many others are great outstanding churches they met me out there where thousands of people come to the airport and when they come and they taught me after the Taj Mahjong hotel and they met in a room similar to this with all the celebrity the city in the ray jaws and everything and the bishop of the Methodist Church he said brother random we don't accept you as a missionary he said because we don't want to hear the word missionary but because you people in the West with your Western education does not understand the scripture in the light of an oriental book and that's true with all of our theology if you ever go to Jerusalem or to the Eastern country where this Bible is written it's a brand new book to you all Western ideas are far from the Eastern ways you can't understand The Parables and so forth the teachings until you go there and see those same customs lived out today and many people would say I have nothing against seminars and students and monasteries and so forth but all of that will never know God it's only known catechism and so forth like that to know what God is to know the person Christ himself and to know him is life not to know your textbook or to know your Creed or to know your catechism isn't life it's to know Christ the person is life eternal and that's what we wish to know now this bishop Stephanie he's irrelevantage of theologist that we had the Bible a thousand seven hundred years before you as a nation that's right Saint Thomas went down in I stood in the church and preached for Saint Thomas the original church that he established in India when he went down from Jerusalem to India and established the church and he said we've had the Bible ever since then and we've had Christianity since then but it's the low end in India and he said we have heard of Dr Reed head the man that came to you which was uh the president of the great Sudan missions the greatest in the world who came to me and he said brother Branham said I've got enough degrees plaster a wall with them after a theology a bachelor's degree in all kinds of degrees since I was about eight years old they said brother Brian where is Christ in all of it he said has the teachers been wrong after the teachers hasn't been wrong sir but what it is that you'll never know Christ's sociology Christ by education you've got to know christbox personally experience for being formed again of his spirit that comes down and changes your life and makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus that's what bears the difference that's what makes the difference and obvious now that's the reason we have so many different denominations in theory they're all all right but the real thing Jesus Christ the son of God said in Saint John The Gospel of Saint John the fourth chapter or third chapter of pardon me the Nicodemus except the man be born again of water and Spirits enter into the kingdom no matter what church you go to that Jesus Christ's own words now to be born means to be delivered from now unless you are delivered by the holy spirit in your life to a new life in Christ are no good but they're good they're all right there of all teachings and so forth which help us but the real personal Christ Jesus and that's what's made the meetings wanted husband today and swept around the world is because by the grace of God to introduce the SE to Jesus right now president and he's saying power that he ever was in fact we don't have to guess at it he said Brothers we have the Bible to be success in India but that what we are interested in is not your theology so what we are interested in has God's visit you Yankees with the spirit or a gift that can make this Bible live in said we know the Bible and said I said well you just admitted we didn't know it but I don't know if you are but I know the author of real well and I said that's the main thing he said that's what we want to know have you faith in us in God to make these Divine promises that he's made for that as you faith in us to make them reality I said by the grace of God God will and that's awesome I was entertained by 17 different religions that denied Christianity some of them worshiped Matt and some of them horses and some cattle and some Buddha and mohawans and so forth and they all have their theologists very good everything was worse not what you have to do do this do that animals no great at all I hope not but notice that night it was when the Lord Jesus came on the scene that's up to Ray Charles on their pillars and so forth and it was over two hours getting into the lineup to where we could get to the speaker stands and when the Lord Jesus came up and told a man that was totally blind for 20 years seeing the vision over him and nobody's going to be here I shallow devil Autumn to come heal the man thousands and thousands of change of Christ at one time there it is it isn't whether our Creeds were working but to reproduce the Lord Jesus and his promise is to know him not your Creed now put this to our patient and I'll try to be just as quick as I possibly can and get the line started cause it's midweek and you people work now Elizabeth tonight beloved I gave all them just to write unto you are the common salvation this is Saint Jude now right into the church 33 years after Pentecost and exhausting you that you should earnestly contend for the faith not a face the face that was once delivered unto the Saints now each one of us in our churches we are fine and I want you to be with your church and support your church and help it uh for the glory of God but now let's go back and find out now there's got to be something that was once delivered to the saints that was surely some way of knowing what we face was now let's go back in the Bible I think that would be logical and proof enough to all of us if we go back and see what the Saints what what kind of Faith they had and if we were exhausted to earnestly contend for this faith we find out what kind of Faith they have where we are to continue now we'll find out we'll find out what before they were ever called Saints in the Bible there was in the New Testament John the Baptist come between the law and Christ which was a gap of the Keystone that locked the two different stations together now we'd have to begin with Christ if we're going to talk about Christian faith because he is the beginning of Christian faith John King John the Baptist preaching the Wilderness of Judea and we've never done one Miracle never done any sign but he just condemned the churches and condemned the priests and the red eyes and so forth and told him I was cunning one and as the baptism of service when he was baptizing he saw Jesus coming with the light following him and he said Behold the Lamb of God will take away the sin of the world and Jesus is baptized the Holy Spirit pays him out of heaven and The Voice come and saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell the original translation says in whom I am dwell in the world himself he was God in flesh now now let's notice what type of life that he did and I want to ask you for something you people as we're talking what he was then he should be if that's the faith that he introduced to the world that ought to be the faith that we should contend for us tonight is that right that's right it should be all right now we noticed as soon as he started off in his ministry we'll watch what kind of a Ministry he has we'll start from the first chapter of Saint Luke according it by memory you might read it when you wish to so in the first chapter it teaches that Jesus began to ruled out doing good for the people he would pray for the sick and they'd be healed now that's one of the things that he did pray for the sake and one day now listen to us now because it'll if you do not listen close to catch every word it'll be a stumbling back to you in the next 20 or 30 minutes when the prayer line starts see now listen close the first thing we find Jesus doing after he had chose two or three of his Apostles and one of his name was um and when he seen and knew that that wasn't Messiah because he saw his prayers for people and them getting well he went over around about 30 miles around behind the mountains of Judea and he found his friend whose name is Nathaniel and Nathanael is under a tree praise and he said come see who I have found Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and he said for any good thing come out of Nazareth Nathaniel said he says come see now I think that's the best answer that any persons could give at any time is before criticizing anything come and see it first look at yourself Lord in the light of the Bible no matter what it seems like and what others say the religion of Jesus Christ has never been popular because the world knows its own see and you're not of the world when you become a Christian you are a different person from the world we know that Jesus said I pray father that may not be of the world so you are not of the world the world the Bible says if you love the world are the things of the world the love of God's not even in you the scripture says that so you can't love two masters Jesus said you can't love God and Mammon the word Mammon is translated means the world and he said to either serve one and hate the other are Vice of Mercy Jesus said that's the same Matthew the fifth chapter Faith served the God and the world at the same time you've got to be one or the other and God have mercy that's what's the matter with our people it is all Christian in this this nation they're trying to live like the world and profess to be Christians and that's the reason the unbeliever outside has such a hard time to make up his mind is because he sees people that call them suspicions live no different than the rest of the world that's pretty fresh but that's truth we got to face truth there's probably many women sitting here I'll never see again until I see you at the judgment and I've got to be truthful and honest because I've got to face the judgment and meet my words again as a judgment so I have to be truthful about it now we noticed that that Philip as soon as he found Nathaniel he said come see who I have found and the same will be the righteous man a good man he said could there be any good thing come out of Nazareth Nazareth is a mean Wicked City very bad Outlaws gangsters and so forth raised up and and had outlawed bands in those days that come out of mass with very vile City Presbyterian or whatever Church it may be the first thing to do is come and find out now examine it not by your ritual not by the catechism not by one advantage or the Bible says that he's at a perfect way to add to anything that's in this book God will take his name out of The Book of Life for Revelation 21st chapter says that he will do that the 22nd chapter rather of the last book of the Bible and he'll be destroyed so we mistake exactly with what the scriptures has got to say now when he found Nathanael and he he said come see so he followed him now let's watch what kind of a man Jesus was now if we wanted to find Jesus tonight if we went if somebody told us Jesus Christ was in Georgetown Indiana what and he was in human flesh Like We Are Tonight what type of a person would we want to find now this may be shopping just like other man there's no difference in his dress for we come to find man that was um that was great forceful speakers graceful speakers no the Bible says not even be heard in the streets when we come to find a man that was a great poster of his great church until no sir the Bible spoke very different of him saying there's a man of sorrow and a queen with grief he wasn't a great fairy owner or blonde he was a humble man and he was oh he does will they find him among the rich people he never dwelt with the rich people for the design you'd find him among the poor he went down on the river and found fishermen think of the great Orthodox church with all her great priests and high priests and a great grammar and glory in that day and not one time that any Apostle or any man of God ever visited or accepted when God sent his son he sent him away from it and he certainly told him that they were in hypocrisy and told them how bad they were and everything that they said he has the devil because he don't even believe in our church see and they were the Church of the nation so you see you can't go by church you've got to go by God that's where you head and but Christ now when Nathaniel came up in the Lord I will see what he found he found a man standing there doing something contrary to what the church's teaching the church thought that the days of Miracles was passed but whoever Jesus sending that performance I don't care where you're at just raise up your hand say God for this I want you to heal me God thank you that's not just about General everywhere I'll tell you what you do I told you that Jesus Christ the son of God is here in the form of the spirit of God is that right how many Christians believe that let's see your hands that's fine and if he is sure and he's the same Lord Jesus they've been stopped his duty down to do the same thing is that right now he said he couldn't heal the father showed him and he did what the father said is that right now A standing in the line I do know this
