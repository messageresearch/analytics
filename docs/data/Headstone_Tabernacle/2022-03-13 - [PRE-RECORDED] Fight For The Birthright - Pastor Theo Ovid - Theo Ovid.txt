24-28 and sin john chapter 15 i want to read from verse one to eight welcome to the headstone tabernacle this morning welcome into his presence those even connected to us on the internet god bless you welcome i want to read it again if you want to take it down genesis 25 30-34 genesis 32 24-28 it's in john 15 1-8 this first scripture about to read is jacob coming seeing isa iso coming from the fields and he's hungry and this is verse 29 let's read verse 29 and jacob sat pottage and esau came from the field and he was faint and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that same red pottage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom and jacob said sell me this did i but right and esau said behold i am at the point to die what prophet shall this birthright do to me and jacob said swear to me this day and he sway unto him and he sold him his boot right onto jacob then jacob give esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink rose up and went his way thus esau despite despised his bitrate let's go to genesis chapter 32 you want to read from verse 24. he says jacob now you rip off everybody in a rip-off mode and he coming back no because he had to deal with his brother he saw who he he he he took the butt right from and jacob was left alone and they wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day when he saw that he prevailed not against him which is the angel didn't breathe against jacob he touched the hollow of his tie and the hollow of jacob's tie was out of joint and he wrestled with him so even with a with a with a with a foot outer joint i tie out a joint he's the wrestling he said let me call for the day breaker man is speaking and he said i will not let he go except though bless me and he said what is thy name and he said jacob and he said thy name shall no more jacob but israel for a prince has thou power with god and with men what what but for as a prince has thou power with god and with men and has prevailed on the last scripture in john 15 i am the true vine and my father is the husband man so i am not in charge of the husband man part my father is in charge of that every branch in me that bear it not fruit he take it away and every branch that beareth fruit he say it out now purchase it doesn't only bear fruit he put you every branch that don't put anything cut off if you only start to produce it's coming to purge that it may bring forth with the purpose of pushing that it may bring forth more fruit now you're clean through the word which i've spoken unto you abide in me and i knew as the branch cannot abide bear fruit of itself except you abide in the vine no more can ye accept you abide in me i am divine ye are the branches he that abides in me and i on him the same bringing forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abides not in me is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you bother me my words are bad in you you shall ask what you will it shall be done unto you hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall he be my disciples says father we thank you for your word and only you know the context and the inspiration behind these scriptures put together this morning when you come and breathe life into it and speak to hearts may no one leave it the same way they came but may there be a transformation taken place on the inside granted father in jesus name i ask it amen amen you may be seated god bless you again and welcome hallelujah by the brother last night he said minister you say you're not sitting in vain i tell him i say i'm not moving from that you say you're not going here there everywhere you're in a certain line and that line is the holy spirit that line is the power of god oh my we must have it amen okay for title fight for the boot right that's what i did this morning fight for the boot right another inspiration there are no shortcuts there are no shortcuts lots of people love shortcuts shortcut blessing shortcut test shortcut that short everything they want a shortcut but in god's program there are no shortcuts i want to nail that down this morning all you shortcut guys and shortcut girls and shortcut ladies and shortcut men and so on there are no shortcuts maybe somebody could give you a shortcut but in god's program there is none of that there is no shortcuts oh praise god revelation 2 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him who is him not christ that's the beast whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb staying from the foundation of the world so everybody is going to worship all man jacques they say going to worship hallelujah they're going to worship something worship your wife worship your money worship your house worship your car you're going to worship something oh that fellaini are going to worship the beast except those names written that means there's a bunch of people that anger worship and no beast whatever form that beast coming no worship for him oh glory to god we're talking about all them fancy actors we're talking about all the presidents the popes the potentials all of them worship and the beast we talking about who is millionaire and building here we talk about who high who low pour burn free if the name is not written to worship the beast if your name is on the book who you gonna worship jesus told the woman well we know what we worship he said he our command always we're the true worshippers not just worshippers but the true worshipers are you are true worshipper where the true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and in truth all glory to god glory to god in spirit and in truth and jesus said my word the word that i speak unto you they are spirit and their life but when the church lost the word in the early ages the spirit couldn't come up on patwood the spirit couldn't anoint that word in that way the spirit was waiting until all the truth will come together all glory to god because the word and spirit is one so god was written all along for a prophet to come on the scene to gather all the scattered words to tie up all the loose ends that the entire holy ghost could visit the church oh give the lord a shout this is what this is about this is what this is about not explanation and interpretation this is for the entire holy ghost oh glory to god to visit the church the entire holy ghost that's why that's why the pentecostal signs and wonders but william branham had the fullness of signs and wonders that's a big difference all together hallelujah they never had a revival like azusa street because rosa street was for the church but william branham was was son of man in a channel man that was jesus christ coming back to reveal himself to elect shall i hide from abraham what i'm about to do you mean god could judge his entire world and wouldn't come to reveal to us his secret and we are heirs of the earth oh give the lord a shout in the house give the lord a shout in the house via heirs of the earth that's what he said abraham i don't know what i'm today i don't know where we're gonna leave today hallelujah we don't even know i don't even know and i'm gonna continue and do and say all what god put upon my heart to say abraham no no no fridge no stove no taxi no carpet no air conditioner a tent man a wilderness man a man's agent seeking a city with maker and builder is god when you ask abraham is that jess he's in my mind just moving hallelujah i'm not moving her dress because one night i am here next day i am here because i'm looking for something i focus on something hallelujah my mind is on something and god came to that gray head man and said shall i add from abraham what i'm about to do because judgment is fixed sorrow is about to be judged they're spoilers about the judge it have not make america great again there is no nation going to be great again because daniel saw a stone cut out without the hands of men and all that kingdom talk all that scared of gold and brass and silver and whatever an iron it's coming down babylon has fallen that's what the word said parliament has fallen it's fallen it's but i see a kingdom that cannot be moved or behold there is a kingdom that cannot be moved [Music] that is why you are here to understand what is about to take place oh glory to god every kingdom was inferior starting from the kingdom of god coming to iron and clay but then he saw a stone cut out without the hands of man and william branham came to bring the fate to catch that stone it would take a faith to catch that stone not an intellectual fate but a real fate and jesus a question when the son of man cometh shall we find faith on the earth not trying to find books and tapes not funnies right people playing tapes not satisfying believers and church members but charlie find fate you have to answer that question oh glory to god so i hope this morning what we share with you would still your spirit or would revive your soul and with anoint you with a passion to know the word when i cry to get in the spirit and have further desire to please god oh give the lord some praises [Applause] for our message called conference i almost tell you i feel like a old man we never got my feeling this morning confronts with god a man said not long ago i don't want to bother i don't want to bother god you know he is awful busy but i'm saying nonsense i don't want to he said you can't exhaust his bountiful blessings could you imagine a little fish about half inch long out in the middle of the pacific ocean saying i better drink this water sparingly cause i might run out could you imagine a little mouse so big under the great counters of egypt saying i better eat russian myself this winter to just two grains a day because i might run out before the new harvest that that's ridiculous well it's twice that ridiculous and a thousand times more to think that you can exhaust the mercies of a merciful god [Applause] by 60 that is not good enough you could exhaust the mercies of a merciful god no wonder he said do your sins be a scarlet i will make it white like snow [Applause] he said how white you know light snow is trying he said why he is trying to force his way into you acts abundantly that your joy might be full there is no way to exhaust him oh glory to god and from where i think pentecostal pentecost failed he said you can never exhaust god's love and mercy to you you say well i i hate to bother you so much father he wants to be bothered that way i don't believe this you [Applause] that was my grandson nazis grandmother grandma did you hear that did you hear that he wants to be bothered that way he does don't never think that you could ever ask too much of god [Applause] the devil wants to make you dumb because if you open your mouth and begin to ask god and trouble god and bother god and keep on knocking and keep on asking and keep on seeking and keep on believing and keep on asking and keep on knocking he knows the devil knows god's going to answer the door going to open [Music] [Applause] hot calling spirit so the

hallelujah glory to god amen do you believe that then prepare for it prepare for your breakthrough prepare for your revival don't wait till something happened cause something to happen oh glory to god hallelujah you light up your corner where you are you may be seated all right let's go from the resume of the ages the false church groups will come together in the world council of churches this world council of churches is the image erected to the beast he quote the scripture from version 13 and i beheld another beast coming out of the earth you have two horns like a lamb and he speak like a dragon so don't watch the horn watch how he's speaking and he exercises all the power of the first piece before him and quarter the earth and them which dwell in the worship the first peace whose deadly wound was healed he do what great wonders so you make it fire come from heaven on the earth in the sight of men deceive them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell in the earth that they should make an image to the visa which had wound by a sword and did live and he had power here we go to give life unto the image of the beast hallelujah there's an image of the beast there's the image of god the prophet came to reveal the image of god that will be in our bride power have to come into the image of the beast for the beast to live power have to come to the image of god for that image to live that power is spirit that power is dynamic everything is written for the spirit because the spirit is going to bring up every seed because every seed must bring forth after it's kind even the beast seed oh give the lord a shout oh give the lord a shout do you understand this power that is coming is not just for you it's for every seed on the earth los angeles sinking as a seed so i have to fall on that seed for los angeles you are a seed fire the fall on you for you to produce oh give the lord i shout you are going to come forth every seed going to bring order of the sky maybe season because at all all both small and great rich and poor free unborn to receive a mark in the right hand or in their foreheads that no man might buy or sell see if he had the mark or the name of the beast or the name of his name and here's the wisdom and so on 666. now remember it was imperial pagan rome that fell by the sword but she was healed of a death stroke when she joined the nominal christian church of rome and incorporated paganism and christianity and thereby became the holy roman empire so this matching room with swords and everything else by connecting with christianity became the holy roman empire which was to endure until jesus came and destroyed her but rome is not going it alone her daughters are right with her and she will take over absolute authority by the welcomes of churches listen this may seem farfetched to some but actually it is very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling politics and at the opportune time will manifest exactly how great is that control this economical move will end up in rome at the head even though the people did not envision it that way this is so because revelation 17 36 it states that the mystery babylon is seated on the beast she is controlling the last or fought empire the roman church is doing that with the world church system under her room will be controlling and this image or church system will be the obedient to rome because rome controls the gold of the world and you know but i'm already already prophesied they will go back to the gold standard does all the people have to belong to the world church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand or head this mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine of the world system which is trinitarianism and the mark in the hand which means to do the will of the world church with this great power the church system will persecute the true bride that's a prophecy so if you think you will sit down in church and think you will go in the rapture and body change i hear people understand that now body change and i only think about before the body change are we going to be perfect are we going to have a statue of a perfect man so if you think you're going to sit down there and everything will be just work out and come to jesus everything will be all right no something to the water something in the flood something to get tried but all go go to the blood are you saying amen i hope i hope you're saying amen to this you know i know when pressure said that when he said the turner people would say i ain't signed up for this well if you stand for this is half a room you sign up to worship the be system is either this or that if god didn't send our prophet we couldn't know this all also you're still in your baptist church catholic church pentecostal church look at this church you're stealing whatever church it was in but causing a message for you to escape you are an escape one you escape room you escape the pope you escape the beast system and you can shout [Applause] [Music] [Applause] millions were lost when god called you you are one in a million you are one in a million you hear me don't wait for your wife to shout you shout by yourself don't wait for the husband to shout [Applause] your name is on that book [Applause] [Applause] with this great power the church systems will persecute the true bride the image this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching her ministers will be for forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it but around even prophesy they will shut down the churches and make them store houses know that looking far-fetched but that's going to come to pass because he has said say that because he predicted he see that because you see a vision of that but before the antichrist in person because like a great spirit at work before the antichrist in person takes over this complete world system of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the lord god will cut away his bride for the great marriage support of the lamb oh glory to god so that devil that demon will bring us to the edge hallelujah praise god i'm going to snatch that right up and then that devil will make war with the remnant of the woman's seat with his church members doors with all the oil oh glory to god did you hear that [Applause] [Music] just fellowship there there's a scripture the angel asked me if it fellowship in here you know oh glory to god i saw six angels from the north slaughtering weapons in the hand i saw another angel with an ink on writer hallelujah said go before them slaughtering angels and put a mark upon every man that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city oh glory to god and then after that when the angels he says utterly men women children children too but come not here at any man with that mark oh glory to god when moses was in egypt god told them take the blood put a mark on the door put it on the doorpost and when i see that mark when i see that blood i'm going to pass over you there is another marker that mark is an original mark it's a blood mask the blood have the life in it the blood of the spirit in it the blood of jesus have the life of jesus in it it brings the faith of jesus it brings the virtue of jesus it brings the knowledge of jesus and brings the temperance the patience the cognitive the brother that carries up jesus [Applause] [Music] hallelujah glory [Applause] my hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah my my mind some big big big shot israelite saying i i born a jew and i ain't feeling alert to put no blood and no dopos he died because it wasn't asking if you're a jew or not you're not asking if you believe brother branham or not or any messages or not you have a book or not that's not what i was asking it's when i see the blood all looking for his blood blood blood blood no blood out blood blood no blood out taking out the uncircumcised take another household with no blood oh i hope that strikes you this morning you have this special friend and you've seen it so and you see any message so forget how you're seeing it it's what god requires oh give the lord a shout [Applause] we are preaching a focus message i'm not trying to waste with nothing else from say when you see the message everything else is filler material you know what filler material is when you have a wash against somebody there's a gift you're putting in a box i'm putting the next box i'm playing the next box and put people around it and wrap it up and look at red pudding outside no is that the box they come for that is a gift what you do you open the box you open you open all the filler material the gift is on the inside [Applause] so there's a message in the message so i am not preaching filler material this is the real deal [Applause] when i see the blood not when the pastor shake your hand when i see the blood i will pass over you but i have nothing to do with that and i could prove it because he read a scripture and jacob was found alone and if god had catch you yet he gonna catch you he's going to find you come on preach back to me you are going to be found alone [Applause] hiding behind your children hiding behind your house hiding behind your father hiding behind your mother hiding behind your husband hiding gonna catch you alone yet because i always tap with this one and you had to hear this one and listen to this one and this one tell you and that one tell you you're not found alone as yet but jacob was pongalone he had hopes he had money he had wives he had children he had gold but nothing was content he couldn't offer you better house he could not vote better money no he needed a change he needed that transformation he needed something more than silver more than gold needed more to offer you can't break god for this world god you can't pay for this your castle look oh nice my house is for this this is not that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you're on your cell phone you're not alone yet you're talking to somebody get away until you call your cell phone you're on facebook but you're not on talk you're not alone yet because

in their spirits i began crying to god for new or porn such as was in the first century listen to this man what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not for the lattering can only come after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain the latter and then is the harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come and the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn the house of the children back to the pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickness of the rapture had not come let us switch over to us now elias is already come we have been

seems to be stirring them no more you know what the bible prophecy there will be a farming in the last days not not for books and dates not for preachers not for explainers but for the hearing of the

give him spirit overcome overcome keeps life in you oh glory to god you have to overcome you have to overcome something if we are if we are trying to follow the message that they are at least this part of the message we should constantly live in the life of christ because if you don't you lay wrong and know the things you're supposed to do then it's sin he that anointed to do good and do it not to him in sin then you become dirty and written when you are separating the life of god so if you don't keep yourself alive in the life of god you will become dirty that word is spelt d-o-t-y amen you know what i do you forget it would burst you forget this if you get it inside your glass with water in it you forget all kinds of things dirty you get forgetful you're a little miserable they come dirty and grumpy you're looking for faulty because because you can't see yourself so good you're fighting forward with other people what kind of dirty behavior i was fighting for this one picking on this one picking this one stop why are you picking yourself in the mirror and say you i've seen you inside of there hold your voice talk to yourself don't come and bring no teaching inside of here hallelujah bring fire it's out of here bring expectation inside of here bring our faith inside of here you see what we're preaching this morning we preaching to fire you up not to cool you dog oh glory to god i ain't a big preacher what fancy revelation of and you know what it's not getting stale because once it got once once one said commodity kind of glory the fresh the intellectual manner now the word now first justification the water that sanctified vessel into service now the holy spirit puts it in service to the holy ghost now to put him into service oh glory to god hallelujah oh my i was talking to someone the other day they were very careful even many of the holiness group not called the holy ghost holy ghost because they identify themselves with pentecostals so they don't want to say holy ghost when they do that they say holy spirit he says see keep them from saying holy ghost because the pentecostal people just call it what the bible says holy ghost which holy spirit holy ghost is the same thing but but terminology become an issue i don't want to use that term because i use that term it could look like i identify with them wow and they're very careful about it they don't want to identify with them tongue speaking people that's the holy spirit itself see what happened when the enemy that went on the signification was washed out returned back i found the house not filled with holy ghost now the status yet is joined but the league of teachers is worse and look at the loudly central church after they receive the holy ghost with the knowledge and the spirit of god within it then the works of god is denied by it and call it an evil work what about that there is where christ is put out of his own church never show them in the church until they come to laodicea when he cut law this year he had been put into it trying to get back in listen to the part i want to get to you see justification never put him in [Music] signification just cleaned the place for him but when the baptism of the holy ghost come it put him in the people you can't break that you cannot break that the baptism the holy ghost put him oh glory to god hallelujah my my mind glory hallelujah do you want him [Applause] like you have to seek him not seek blessing you're seeking him you want to know him you want to get in contact with him you want to get in contact with the power source [Applause] from see now there were the shock she gave birth what kind of boot not to the word this whole on his heart but to organizational bit there's methodists baptist pentecostals these are organizations who are you are pedicure that organization i'm a baptist that's organization all of them have a name bible called it blasphemous names names as blasphemy here is the methodist baptist pentecostal they all took the habits of their mother any ownerish woman in california can give buddha virgin girl that's why the first message come forth but when the truth was presented to luther's age he couldn't take it when the baptismal holy ghost was presented the methodists they couldn't take it now this is a big one i've never seen this one before this is one fresh this one fresh fresh this one fresh with chicken on it yeah that's good when the baptism of the holy ghost was permitted presented to the methodist they couldn't take it but now when the sea time has produced a pentecost she can't take it so but obama is prophesying that there's going to be a sea tank and that sea tank he's not talking about azusa he's talking about the pentagon's after azusa [Applause] [Music] oh hallelujah when the seating oh glory god this is a new one has produced a pentecost the message world won't be able to take it we are prophesying that the sea time is producing another pentecost associate plus oh give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah oh don't you feel like shouting this morning this is a hidden mystery didn't want any big mysteries but a punch is a big big mystery we just unlock a big mystery it's no longer hidden it's for you your pentecost is comin [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay today there's some super saiyan if that light of god that holy spirit ever strikes a predestinated seed though's name that was put in labor life function in the world the bible said that the light will shine you can preach the sun it's like water on duck back it falls off but once let it one strike that seed watch what happens why it is predestinated seated coming forward it's got to come and when that light the gospel strikes it they get it the rest of them will walk away it's not for them the bible said they were forwarding for condemnation and when that light struck little rebecca she knew something within her she never see the man like elias i asked her shall you go she said i will go take up my hearing she'll be here mother exactly but she says she's gonna go oh glory to god fate was working in rebecca listen when she knew something within her that brought her to isaac she veiled the face she wanted no more to do with her own thinking isaac was her thinking from then on so she had thinking about his sister and she mother and she caused that she brother that them had their own stories to talk about she had one person to think about that is isaac and when the pride of jesus christ get locked in you only have one person think about that's the capstone of love that's the dynamics of the mechanics that's the power of god that's the other half of the chinese ticket all glory to god is one thing you ought to talk about [Music] oh give the lord i shout oh glory to god the connection with the source you ready and the church here we go itself when it strikes that power of god that's prophecy does it have any message yet it's coming unbelievable this morning that's hanging over us come on that song tabernacle you were raised up for such a time as this we're going to hit that tape we going to win this race we not running to run we are running to win oh give the lord a shout we are not running to enter the race we are running to win [Applause] my lord the race is on oh glory to god the race is on who will cross jordan oh god the race is on who's gonna cause jordan jordan is called jordan is dead get to self who's gonna cross jordan that christ michael may be seated so let's let's recap sea time will produce another pentecost do you get that how many get i show my raise of hands amen we read hope of the man say that the power that came in as loser there they thought that was the final question they thought that but it wasn't that because they see they come yet that's my point water on the ground hallelujah there's no seed there he wasting time almost but that only prepared atmosphere for the prophet to come on the scene because he had the seed because his son is the saw solomon was veiled in him so he brought the seed we have the seed now because the secret is the word is in the brain tell somebody the word in you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and the church itself whether it strikes that power of god and he call it the baptism of the holy ghost and to identify where he's talking about he said out of the non-national churches so he is not talking about pentecostal baptism he's not talking about methodist or catholic charismatics he's not talking about that he is prophesying in this message it will be released must be released it shall be released it's being released it has been released [Applause] listen we're not guessing this is not could it be whatever it is suppose it is whatever it is because you know from what i see him this is not that all the man experienced my head lucky over 7. gambling over under lucky seven and the pelton that hoping to hit some kind of thing this is not that you know we're not pelting that this morning you know this is dusty of the lord he said when the baptism of the holy ghost watch okay holy holy holy and the church itself when it strikes that power of god the baptism of the holy ghost listen out of the nominal churches out of the catholic church wherever it is when that baptism of the holy ghost is made real to people damn that is predestinated like you people here to eternal life see it and work in it what is it it's a super sign and you possess the case of the enemy you got to see it being made real to you you got to have it i will not let you go till you bless me oh give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god [Music] tonight we're getting together there's racing up among the groups kind of comparison somebody tried to act like it live a different life and drink smoke and watch television things of the world and still call themselves pentecostals they're trying to imprison it a genuine it's never been revealed to them when it's revealed it is glorious something that takes that out of you when you walk in there moses veiled he was the living word to the people and the people that are veiled at the same thing their written epistles read of all men the word made manifest isn't that right your life shows what you are oh glory one time there was a boy he had gotten some trouble he was a good boy he went to court the judge said i find you guilty i must punish you to life in prison he said i want to try my own case i want to go upon my record he's just said you have no record your record is what condemned you and that's the way it is today the reason the church is not advanced like it should is the record it's the life we must become more dedicated we must believe every word of god we must seek watch we must seek until that word is made real to us so in other words the day for coming to church to to them make people feel they're not backstage that's finished you ain't coming to church because you know where to go this sunday morning stay home come to church because you understand your name is on the book and you're here to let the devil know whose side you're on [Music] you're looking for your breakthrough you come here for your deliverance you're coming because you're not a piggy alarm you always want alarm just type in the mud they come in they get washed they come in they get clean they come and get liver they come in and get free [Applause] [Music] i want you to notice another characteristic of moses when he came out he being a prophet being a great man he was when he came up with the word the people saw that it was changed something had happened to him watch and when he come out with the vindicated word of that hour the commandments he was a changed person and so will you be when you come from behind that human veil that would laugh at a meeting like this that man who would stumble at the divine healing and say the miracle past you have dropped from behind that human veil the traditional real and everybody will know something happened to you your testimony wouldn't be i rent a church that's not a testimony i believe the prophet that's not a testimony that's a belief even here lucifer testimony did he never believe in chapter 2 so if you're trembling the same part on pardon david tremble he believed and tremble you're not even trembling but you believe but believers are good enough because believers have come to our life you have to act upon what you believe to show your true truly belief when the doctors dismiss abraham because he doctor don't want to check him up no more abraham really believes he said doc i come for checkup he said what for checking last month to check it last year check your last 10 years like like 15 years is the same story no baby she's a chick sarah was sarah sarah even worse because god talked to she so she was just watching the doctor and she she cared she has no reference god talk to abraham put abraham get the hole up for sarah too after 25 years hey man i'm looking at me right now you see i'm feeling good i feel better than this 25 years thing give god a greater testimony he's no longer going to give god glory stand up at the promised land after 25 years when you think you're going to pack up shop and rock in a rocking chair and say oh god you forget me abraham staggered that at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith given glory to god because he was fully persuaded that what he promised he was able to perform abraham had one message isaac coming hallelujah he put it on a card he put it on his house oh give the lord a shout everyone preaching the same thing the tired message you can't produce nothing all these years are watching your life i ain't seen nothing i just see no evidence that's here i can get pregnant what you're talking about i ain't talking about mina breads i talk about what he said he told me cough the stars so shall thy seed be he told me and when i start to coat i run out of numbers so i know it's more than i could even number i don't have the numbers that congress stands he says so shall i see and i believe him i don't believe you i believe him and i believe him this morning to send dynamics to the mechanics i believe him this morning to send signs and wonders and miracles i leave him this morning to come and vindicate and confirm his [Applause] oh word to god glory to god [Applause] oh hallelujah man when the baptism of the holy ghost is real outside

you have ice scream and kick out here it doesn't work so you know that's what i'm called be pains pains jesus told his heavens you shall rejoice but your destroys have turned to sorrow a woman when jesus javed had not soul but joy a manchester is born so the bride has to go through pain we call that pain we are trying to build into a new age right now from the teaching to the preaching from the teaching see the lettering inspiration reign there has to be a transition oh glory to god a different atmosphere altogether you can't come here for the letter of the word paul said my preaching was not with enticing words but but preaching was with power that your faith may not rest in what i teach but in what god has done one soul there we go another water but god give the increase let's say it again one soul another water but god give the increase the sword is the teaching the waterer is the preaching but god oh give the lord i shout [Music] all glory to god hallelujah so don't think for one moment they could shelve the preachers the preachers are attained to water the word another quote for that you may be seated hallelujah when a church is grown in under the persecution of the outside world message world believing in the lord jesus that the promise of the holy ghost is just as real to us as it was the pentecost how they groan and cry let the entire message world laugh let them laugh we're gonna grow we're gonna try we're gonna call we've got the holy ghost just that's real what they had about there picking another day i found out i'm also i'm omega oh glory to god but the branham said when the revival strikes the sisters down wash the dishes is more than singing message songs it's more than having no more songs the sisters can't watch traditions why because holy ghost holy ghost holy ghost holy ghost poor legal this message needs it this message needs it yeah we need it oh get the lord that shock transform your life [Applause] how they groan and cry in their liver pain but when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom of god then the holy ghost are set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists ministers that they don't even know this quote they don't even know that the holy ghost after position replaced them positionally placed because we identified with the message but the message of identifying you except with us god have to say this is my son we can claim whatever you want to claim say whatever you want to say brother branham was called to do the work of an evangelist until he was placed positionally to be that elijah when he opened sex heals oh give the lord a shout when he opened six seals god vindicates his ministry as that elijah because christ is a seventh seal oh are you ready are you ready for some more do you want to put layer on top a layer that the devil have no room to move let's nail this down what the end time message is to get a bride ready and prepare for the rapture according to malachi 4 is to bring back the fate that was once delivered to the saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers the pentecostal part in the restoration time so he is prophesying that there's gonna be a pentecostal part in the time of restoration we are in that park now we are in that slot right now oh glory to god what part the pentecostal part where we sign where are we crying where are we groaning where are we moaning oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah this messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do two things according to malachi 4 he will turn hearts of the children to the fathers two he revealed the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed on the line e90 mystery truths is what would literally turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal fathers that's what the prophet said that's the word we say amen that amen to that they finally reveal mystery truths supreme supposed to produce the fate to bring down the power faith is not to say i have faith faith have a production with it he said works is faith express you can't profit you have to produce faith [Applause] give the lord a shout give the lord a shout show me your faith without words i will show you my faith by my works that's what james said that was the bible said right now watch to qualify this statement that we just read literally turn the hearts of the children to the princes of fathers so from this quote here it looked like the more talk we have the more revelations we preach the more mystery please is the more faith in the people see it looks like that that's how it looks but that's not what he's saying here to say to take this here you have to take what else he said and this is what he said here we know the scriptures say that jesus is the chief on the stone he also is a headstone now watch in a few minutes the seven church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by mind not by power but by my spirit said the lord not my organization not my denomination but by the holy spirit god will bring forth the church in the last days so this mystery truth is supposed to bring us back to rebuild the church in the power of the spirit do you believe that oh glory to god he said i'll restore it again in the last days it will be restored god shall send the holy ghost in such a way upon planted wood that it will restore so this restoration is not no intellectual taking notes thing or give the lord a shout it's the holy ghost to come upon what word in you listen church if you don't have the word in you and the firefall you are back in 1906 pentecost because god was anointed men and doing men men was drinking and smoking or cutting and selling the power of god upon them because it was upon them there was no conduit for god to really use within them so god say you know what i will bring my word now i'm going to put my word in people and my word will be the conduct of the spirit because with that word i'll give the proving grounds of character with that word i'll bring tests to see the metal in the men listen it is supremely scary to applaud the character you know let's not talk about what he say talking about party just talk about the power without character we seasoned governments receipts and prime ministers and presidents and people with these normal men you know adulterers fornicating lion men but don't talk online the next thing by itself and they in charge of people and people's lives men without heart without compassion and they're in power same thing in churches too but god wants our wit [Applause] and every test is customized your tests have your name on it you can pick somebody's paper and do the exam when god say put your name god put your name he put every test every child he know what you could go through when god put you in the capsule of his pressure he know you want to be pressurized because you are more things coming so when god dropped the lion and david god no lad it's not he's not the lion is he testing him that's just an introduction god say hold up lion and beer david had a private experience that qualified for public exposure did you get that did you get that he had his private overcoming nobody was there his brothers was terrorizing him wasn't there as far as he concerned his sheep he came out it wasn't fair for the lionel his love for the sheep tell the lord i shall give the lord our show [Applause] stop looking at you love god put all your heart with all your mind with all your soul with all your strength when you look at you you will give up when you look at you you will mess up when you look at you is not good [Music] come on now come on now come on now give the lord a shout you become you become what you behold you have to behold something greater than you when another eagle was in a barnyard and he fights up with the chickens and so on scratching like scratch corn on the front things eating with them he never saw anybody like him all

first step jump on the banana post and he said son just lift their minds higher oh glory they're going to make a bigger jump and flap it okay the lord i shout you have to see something bigger than you hard on you more powerful than you and when you see it jump [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah praise god glory to god this last great step must come into perfection that the holy spirit has to live in that church perfectly what is wrong with this quote this last great step that the holy spirit has to live in the church so perfectly it will make the head and body unite together oh let's come down to jacob now oh hallelujah so long to get to this guy oh hallelujah praise god esau and jacob brown said esau was a better gentleman in terms of treatment and behavior esau is the man of the hour without a doubt he's the man you'll bring gifts to macaroni you will do something special for him extra juice eso is the man oh he is polish i mean he's right he could cook i mean he's a hunter i mean he is the man of the hour jacob forget it you had to watch him close what's that man jacob now he's not easy he's underhand he's missed us called ugly he is mr smackman whenever he talking you have to read between the lines because he ought to get you that's jacob but god said jacob i love he so i hate what was god looking at that the purpose of god a quality election might stand hey jacob have i

list just drop chosen on them feel good about yourself hallelujah [Music] he saw he saw taking care of his blind daddy feed the cat and so forth but he despised the bird right and jacob believed it and the church and they said oh this new birth stuff holy all that stuff there's nothing to it some of them love it some of them despise it you see the flesh man can't take this worship thing you know freshman said you're pushed making noise flesh man normal man that's catholic spirit coming to the message i met the spirit committed the message god is supposed to keep quiet priests only doing there's nothing in yourself when they do these things so they feeling good because the priest do anything so oh hallelujah but the original church was always a pentecostal church the original church

shouting didn't start on earth this show thing started in heaven we shouted up there we're gonna shout down here oh glory to god let the shouts go up oh hallelujah oh my god hallelujah you may be seated look over better man esau was than jacob he didn't have the conception to know he sold his birthright cause he despised them which was far more a gentleman and a neighbor a man of works jacob's name was a planter surplus is a deceiver but esau was a gentleman in every respect oh glory to god hallelujah listen jacob had respect unto that birthright his old motive listen no matter what it cost him no matter what it cost him he wanted the birthright come on now or you want to play social media i don't want anybody to know i won the birthright [Applause] the number of vestalia let me be

hallelujah glory to god today's the day you know today is that you may be seated that's his own motive no matter what it cost him he wanted a birthright no lord watch if the church only consists if the body of christ is only controlled by intellectuals theology mental conception then we are wholly dependent upon the intellectual knowledge of man if i make that clear if the church only rests upon the intellectual how that man could set the church and build big places and plus seats and thousands of and how could preachers mess in such a way get more people to join more members then we only need the intellectual conception of man we don't need the holy spirit if the church is to be run government intellectuals educational program upon election we do not need the holy spirit if it's to be run by the holy spirit we do not need the intellectuals it is either one or the other and i am saying to you we do not need the intellectuals that are going to all kind of scripture that have no bearing on what is happening right now [Applause] all kinds of scripture that i never see it so oh is double god saying is that what it means could i get the book for that can i write that down listen

hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated oh god i'm i'm all over this morning i love that and ten commandments when people bring in gifts of silk and gold and whatnot and when moses come they say what kingdom are you from he said the kingdom of the most high god oh glory to god hallelujah that man was announcing that where you come from didn't catch it if you only catch it he might have tremble one time and talk a different talk he said what do you bring you must bring something he said bring the word just the way what word do you bring from this kingdom of god let my people go it's not a

hallelujah it's not a suggestion it is what promised god promised it a prize revival a seven thunder revival a holy ghost revival [Music] [Applause] oh glory to god one or the other oh glory to god man is drawn to christ by intellectual by theology but the holy spirit alone is god's joy and power oh glory to god what we need is not intellectual speeches but it's the baptism of the holy spirit with power and demonstrations and manifestations of the spirit is what we need to bring men to the church it's the joy junction of the holy spirit brother i know we are on the right track i know we on the right channel oh glory to god being the right thing [Applause] [Applause] was taking care of his poor old blind daddy jacob seemingly didn't care what happened to him do you hear that jacob like java heck yeah he blind he's dying he on your own there's only one thing jacob wanted that was the birthright daddy on his way out that he can't do nothing much for now but that bird twice is everything so when jacob walking talking about right boot right put it right right oh jacob what is the timing [Applause] he's all come hungry he's all complained jacob in our atmosphere he wants to catch him at the right time because we want this thing so bad my god he cook a lentils for that man he know the man like lentils with big deal in it oh my goodness oh hallelujah put some pigtail in that lentil catch eso [Applause] [Music] oh get the lord oh glory to god hallelujah let's continue praise god the bible said he despised his birthright esau and the bible said except there come a vain fornicator among you an evil person like esau who despite his birthright and sword if i messed up what is the birthright it's the right that is what i'm trying to tell you this holy spirit is your birthright [Music] fight fit [Applause] fight for the birthright come on now we know come in enjoy text hallelujah the holy spirit is your birthright [Applause] [Music] [Applause] don't you like eso he didn't care about it no people would say today i will go to church i'm just as good as the next fellow but me act like one of them holy rollers not me he said you eso see it's the same thing but if you notice jacob had one thing he wanted because according to the word the blessings and the good things laid in the bitrate [Applause] not some book not some tape not some mighty minister not some mighty preacher it's the birthright not a church it's the birthright [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so do you know what you're coming for now [Applause] so don't put it right so don't betrayed one more time birthright fight for your birthright jacob that was his only objective the only thing he had in mind was to get that birthright he saw despise it and that's the way the spiritual believer today he doesn't care how much you laugh at him oh glory to god then birthright people they don't kill your laugh if i had to shout if i had to jump i have a coach you know i hope i get to it but i'm saying if you had to stand up on your head another one brother and yes i got knocked near the tree he stopped and he said he said lord i ain't coming down to this family the holy ghost [Applause] oh glory hallelujah and the spiritual man today spiritual woman that is elected that is predestinated the countries in their life if they have to sell everything they got if you have to take your name off of every church book in the nation they still want that birthright it's the only thing that matters to them just get that birthright no matter how what level they have to come on if they have to get in at the altar if they have to cry if they have to boohoo if they have to run through the places go back make things right sell what you cut or give everything away [Applause] let me read it again in case you're missing if they have to get to the altar and cry boohoo if they have to run through the places if they have to make things right if they have to sell what they got give away everything they have and become a pilgrim and a stranger it doesn't matter they want the birthright all they're interested in the birthright now don't blame their people don't blame them they can't help it they were predestinated to that so all this noise shouting carrying on that is what reproduction is onto bullet right people oh glory to god we see our names param said the holy ghost come long as your your representation from god come down from god in the form of the holy ghost let me say it again your representation from god come down from god in the form of the holy ghost fight faith oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah a canal mind wants to bring the bird right down to their level but for me and i believe all true born christians we meet god on god's level i don't care what i have to do what i have to say how i have to act the only thing i wanted that means more than popularity that means more than my job it's been more than my mother it'd be more than my wife it's me more than my children if me more than every friend i've got let me have that birthright i don't care what i have to pay i want to meet god on his requirement whatever it requires [Applause] if i fall in the dust if i speak with tongues if it runs to the building and act like a maniac or stand on my head i don't care so long as i get it that's the main thing that is spiritual minded people they want the bird right regardless oh glory to god it brings you to a separation all glory to god and sometimes it means walking alone oh glory to god if you're really sincere and you rarely receive the birthright you don't care to walk alone if the neighbors won't invite you over to dinner if nobody will have anything to do with you what difference does it make as long as you got the birthright that's the main achievement of your life as long as you are born of the holy spirit as long as on my road to heaven what difference does it make what people say as long as walking in the spirit all that's born of the spirit of god and led by the spirit of god sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god always walking in the beauty light of holiness oh glory to god hallelujah give the lord some praises and listen we are not finished yet oh hallelujah glory to god a lot of people don't want to get the birth right because they think it's a little unpopular they don't want to get to the altar and cry a little bit or go without a few meals they don't want to do it oh glory to god hallelujah but a new birth is messy any birth is a mess if it's in a pig pen or a band or a decorative room it's a mess unless anything dies here we go oh glory to god i can't stop now unless anything dies and rocks life can't come from it unless a man dies and rocks to his own thoughts christ can't get into his heart and when you try to think of yourself if i walk to the altar and say yes lord i'm a fine fellow i take you i pay my tithes i'll do this you got to die and rock tell your thoughts let the holy ghost come and take over and do whatever you want to do with him get messy with it here i would kind of get messy with it i know that sounds horrible but the baron said i know it sounds horrible but get messy either okay there's nothing on your nose get messy you can't sit down and just slip slip sniff when they do have money they collect they're balling i want to jump in the grave and all kinds nobody's not that friend no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no you're they get desperate that i cannot cannot talk attitude jacob wasn't bothering about his father easter eggs he's a problem he said i want to help you follow your father bird right birth right birth right but i want holy ghost i want revival i want break you i want power miracles i want sign the wonders i want i thought it was dry life i want power to testify i want power to witness i never win a soul yet it's time i win somebody's on the lord lord i want power to win souls [Applause] [Music] all right let me get to the home stretch now hallelujah i don't know where i'm at there's a highway and a way of holiness brother branham says now if i was going to new york city the best thing for me is not to try geographically how i'm situated and take off note the best way is to get a map and follow the map because you know what when you're waiting you're going south and i don't see you going soon you head you get episode you ain't know where you're going you just get sick they say i go and show you a second also you don't know what salt is you have to get a map a watch if i don't i get in trouble and here we go there is no shortcuts in the kingdom of god you know we try to make shortcut we go to the end upon somewhere admired that's what we do and then we get off the old highway of god god made a part and a way when the children of israel come out of egypt they followed god's path it led them to the red sea it is strange that god would lead his part that way but his path went right through the sea and when it come time for the shooting and israel stood before the sea god part led across the sea so god looked down to the pillar of fire the sea got scared and moved back because when george john is drawing to bring them to the promised land it draws straight to the red sea they may see oh god plant this route but god planted straight to the red sea so when moses confronted the red sea the rest you have to open up because god already drew a line god draw that line already go there go into a room the red sea we going through the red sea i tell you the line to this holy ghost already drawn where are we going dead we go into it we go into it [Applause] he went right up to the wilderness into the spring of mara bitter water isn't it strange that god would lead his turn to beat the waters and them all along the road and when he was there remedy for the bitter waters moses cut down a tree and throw this in the water and the water did sweet again some through the waters some through the flood some to deep trials but all through the blood that's the way god leads his children that's god's provided way and if the children israel would have tried to bypass and go around they would got in trouble they had to follow the code of fire they had to follow the cloud and the church tonight if the church tonight will only follow the pillar of fire the holy spirit you will make canaan as sure as anything there are two ways a man can go his way or god's way and that's the right way or the wrong way and your way is always wrong god's way is always right you can't be in your way and in god's way at the same time so you got to get out of your own way so god can make history in you god makes a provided way oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah let's separate the born of the water and of the spirit he will no wise enter his kingdom no wise no matter who's methodist baptist whatever he is he will not enter until he's born of water and spirit born means to be changed he has to die before he can be born and you've got to die to yourself to be reborn in christ jesus oh glory to god hallelujah not all that say lord lord but the one that does the will of the father is not he that starts is he that finishes there are no shortcuts you are disqualified at the end of the race there is no shortcuts you must come the way the scripture said except you die to yourself and be born of the spirit of god you are lost [Applause] [Music] church we at the junction right now listen to this word except you die to yourself and be born of the spirit of god you are lost that is all there is no shortcuts oh glory to god i know by the way that doesn't save you you the preacher hand that doesn't help you there are no shortcuts everybody going to die the preacher going to die the illness going to die the deacon's going to die the lady going to die quick pen people music people all man going to die hallelujah could be here don't die on me no come on keep worshiping keep praising god [Applause] jacob he got a birthright he's feeling good now he's still tricking people yeah the bird right listen to the prophet i forgot it he thought everything was all right because he had a right he talked the thing was subtle he counted his brother when he was hungry coming from the field he swear he got the bit right he said pentecost here is where you feel you thought because you were born of the spirit the birthright that settled it but that only starts it do you remember the message him how that child after he was born in the family become a son it had rights to the birthright but it had to be proven child trained then if it did not prove out to be an obedient child to the father's will it did not get become ear it had nothing yet it was a son he had nothing if he wasn't interested in the father's work so when the holy ghost fell upon the pentecostal people and they began to restore back the gifts that was in the church they thought because they were born of the spirit that settled it but you see there's a placing of a son and after the son has proven to be a real son then he's taken to a public place jacob thought because he had the birthright everything was made hallelujah so did the pentecostal people but the fussing and pulling one another proved that the token wasn't showing malice envy strife that's where it got to chica by the same thing but in fear one night of his own life desperation took a hold of him just across that river yonder my brother is waiting to kill me not have a hot dog waiting for me he said my brother waiting to kill me birthright he had gotten was the thing that was going to cause his death and sometimes the very thing you receive as the holy spirit is it is a born-again respiratory if you don't watch that same thing will condemn you at the end very same waters that save noah condemned the world jacob knew his life was closed at the end he had a messenger come and told him his brother and 400 armed men was coming to meet him he was on his road fear take a hold of him he sent a man head with ox with cattle sheep to make peace offering with esau after that he started another group with another stuff he started another group with another stuff trying to meet the first chinese tune his rat then he got to thinking that won't stop him because he's probably richer than i am he doesn't need it then he took his wives little children send them a cross that esau will see the little children in his wife surely on his own little niece and nephew he will not slay them then he still he couldn't do it god know how to get a man jacob crossed the brook goddard on his knees jacob mean a deceiver but there was something had to happen to him in desperation when death laid before him and there may be men and women here tonight death lays right before you and the only way you will ever be able to achieve the thing you're wanting is to desperately come i must have it tonight i get it now or i am finished tomorrow is too late i must have it now and when you pray for the baptism of the holy spirit don't say i'll go up and try lord i am tired he said mercy stay in your seat don't even make an attempt if you come say i'll pass you a prayer line they put all them ahead and see if we do any good he said stay where you are until you get to that place until the whole church here we go whole church shout out whole say it again whole church open your mouth and say old church until the whole church gets to a place it's between death and life it's noah perish then god will move on the scene oh glory to god don't put the burden on the preacher don't put the burden on some elder don't put the button on somebody else to put another each and every one of us [Applause] i'm almost done jacob cried like never before desperately he called until he got a hold of god so let's start with the call he did all he could do he sent peace offering he sent people he sent his niece and nephew and everything else and then he crossed the brook and he was caught alone oh god he was so desperate his cry attracted the angel did you hear me the insider just come you know he was crying he was saying he was groaning he was in such a channel that the angel come and when he recognized the angel come he locked into the angel and said know that you are here i am letting you go until you bless me oh glory to god brother branham said desperately he called until he got a hold of god and when he did he wrestled not for 15 minutes he wrestled to keep him in his soul all night long and still he knew he didn't have the blessing think about it rolling with the angel wrestling with the angel feeling the anointing of the angel and you still know you ain't get it yet oh god all night long all night long it's breaking today now the angel want to go he said no you're not going the angel on jon just died he said you're still not going you're not going till you bless me i'm desperate today oh glory to god he wrestled until the blessing came oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah jacob in desperation he said i know i feel you you're here with me i am not going to let you go somebody sees us fine the first little sensation they get up and jump up and run over the eyes and say i've got another one i got it i got it no jacob stayed there until something happened that make him walk different made him a different person because he stayed there until something happened he held on until he was changed jacob stayed there until the blessing came and changed his name from a deceiver to a prince with god all glory to god the results was because he got desperate about this thing and the next day when he met esho he didn't need any guards he walked right out and met him he had got desperation till he got the assurance if a duck had the instinct to lead the ducks out of coldness he said what about the holy ghost in the church it ought to lead us from all formalities and creeds and things into a glorious wonderful baptism of the holy ghost it brings virtue knowledge patience godliness and the holy spirit that is what the real guy would lead because you're going to breed nothing else but the gospel oh glory to god hallelujah and the way god is expecting us as individuals to grow is the way he brought the church to grow oh glory to god he brought his church up the same way he brought the church up the same way he is bringing people up peter said seven things faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness then the love of god the holy ghost here we go christ in the person of the holy ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the holy ghost and you got all these virtues sealed into you then god lives in that tabernacle called the building the living tabernacle of the living god's dwelling place and when a man possesses these kinds of things then the holy ghost comes upon him oh glory to god so now it don't belong to no denominational spree because it's time for the uniting of men and women of every race every color every creed everything under christ by the baptism of the holy ghost and back to the word oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god and i'm close with this i'm interested what the man said oh my god oh dear i pray for the sick but in here i'm interested in one thing that's the born-again church that's what i'm interested in not by laws and deacons and orders of the church i'm interested in the baptism of the holy ghost upon the church for this day oh glory to god we and that's the fundamental part that's what we are looking for oh glory to god i'll close thank you very much for being patient with us i complete the entire message today final quote in preaching there is some people that are preachers they can pick that the word with inspiration and sway it out there in places that is water in the seeds that the teacher has taught now you've got to put some seed in first
