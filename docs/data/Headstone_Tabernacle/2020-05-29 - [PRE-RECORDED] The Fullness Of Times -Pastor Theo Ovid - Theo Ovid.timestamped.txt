[16:18] Bibles idea to the Daniels up to 12
[16:20] Walter Reed 1 to 4 want to look at first
[16:24] Corinthians chapter 10 while I read what
[16:26] 1 to 11 Ephesians chapter 1 when the
[16:29] would belong to his tree - 10 Thank You
[16:34] Volition's Wheaton's in Jesus name -
[16:38] you're welcome
[16:39] we tend to all doors connected to us on
[16:41] the internet welcome Utah Sunday morning
[16:45] worship fellowship unto God Daniel
[16:53] chapter 12 we live us 1 to 4 and at that
[16:59] time shall Michael stand up the Great
[17:02] Prince which standeth for the children
[17:05] of thy people and there shall be a time
[17:09] of trouble such as never was since there
[17:12] was a nation even to that same time and
[17:15] at that time thy people shall be
[17:18] delivered every one that shall be found
[17:21] written in the book many of them that
[17:25] sleep in the dust of the earth shall
[17:27] awake some to everlasting life and some
[17:31] to shame and everlasting contempt but
[17:37] Dena be wise shall shine as the
[17:39] brightness of the firmament and they
[17:42] that turn many to righteousness as the
[17:44] stars for ever and ever but Thou O
[17:47] Daniel shut up the words and seal the
[17:50] book even to the time of the end many
[17:54] shall run to and fro knowledge shall be
[17:57] increased we learn from 1st Corinthians
[17:59] chapter 10 when I read from verse 1
[18:05] moreover brethren I would not that ye
[18:07] should be ignorant how that all our
[18:10] fathers were under the cloud and all
[18:13] passed through the sea were all baptized
[18:17] unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea
[18:19] did all eat the same spiritual meat did
[18:22] all drink the same spiritual drink for
[18:24] the drunk of that
[18:25] rock that followed him that rock was
[18:28] Christ but with many of them God was not
[18:33] well pleased for they were overthrown in
[18:37] the wilderness now these things were our
[18:41] examples to the intent we should not
[18:46] lust after evil things as they also
[18:49] lusted neither be idolaters as were some
[18:53] of them as it is written the people sat
[18:57] down to eat and drink and rose up the
[19:01] plane neither let us commit fornication
[19:03] as some of them committed and fell in
[19:06] one day three and twenty thousand
[19:08] neither let us tempt Christ some of them
[19:12] also tempted and were destroyed of the
[19:14] Serpent's neither murmur ye as some of
[19:17] them also murmured and were destroyed of
[19:19] the destroyer now all these things
[19:24] happen unto them for example and they
[19:31] are written for our admonition upon whom
[19:35] the ends of the world come final
[19:39] scripture Ephesians chapter 3 1 we want
[19:42] to read from verse 3 blessed be the God
[19:47] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[19:49] what blessed us with all spiritual
[19:51] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[19:53] according as he had chosen us in him
[19:56] before the foundation of the world I
[19:59] wish it be wholly without blame before
[20:01] him in love having predestinated us unto
[20:04] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[20:07] to himself according to the good
[20:08] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[20:11] the glory of His grace where any
[20:13] admittance accepted in the beloved in
[20:15] whom we have redemption through his
[20:16] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[20:18] to the riches of His grace wherein he
[20:20] had a bonded towards us in all wisdom
[20:22] and prudence having made known unto us
[20:26] the mystery of his will according to his
[20:29] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[20:32] himself that in the dispensation of the
[20:35] fullness of
[20:37] he might gather together in one all
[20:39] things in Christ both which are in
[20:43] heaven and which are on earth even in
[20:47] him may God bless his word you may be
[20:50] seated

[21:10] fullness of times I said I have the
[21:13] fullness of times a novel inspiration
[21:16] waitin for the manifestation of the sons
[21:21] of God that's the inspiration waitin for
[21:24] the manifestation of the sons of God in
[21:26] this scripture this inspiration is on
[21:28] Romans 8:19 it says for the illness
[21:31] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[21:35] the manifestation of the money of the
[21:37] sons of God
[21:37] annalee amplified it says for the even
[21:40] the whole creation all nature waits
[21:43] expectantly and longs endlessly for
[21:47] God's sons to be made known it's waiting
[21:52] for the revealing or the disclosing of
[21:55] the sonship that's not talked sure that
[21:58] is sonship so the creation itself is
[22:01] waiting for the revealing or the
[22:04] unfallen of the Assumption or this is
[22:07] tremendous just imagine the whole
[22:09] creation is groaning for the
[22:11] manifestation of the sons of God when

[37:51] no and I'm an hour coming how come so
[37:59] he's gonna have a success of Elijah when
[38:01] he did God call this man listen he
[38:05] wasn't a Nocera seminary when he called
[38:08] him he was plowing a field but the yoke
[38:11] of oxen the service taking care of his
[38:14] mother and father God called him to be
[38:18] the successor of Elijah or Elijah
[38:20] perhaps many up at the school thought
[38:23] they were sure to do going to be his
[38:25] successor they weren't aware his role as
[38:28] soon as he was finished but God does the
[38:31] callin God does the chosen God does the
[38:38] electon and God does the settin in order
[38:44] [Music]
[38:46] do you love him
[38:48] God has set in the church some apostles
[38:52] some prophets some teachers some
[38:54] evangelists and pastors God does that
[38:56] himself we cannot make one hair black or
[39:00] white neither can be added wanting to
[39:03] our stature by taking thought God in His
[39:07] infinite grace and by his election and
[39:11] foreknowledge sets these things in order
[39:16] and every wheel was just right I like
[39:21] that I would be a discouragement this
[39:24] morning if I didn't believe in the
[39:26] election and calling of God if I thought
[39:30] that this world was left to the outcome
[39:33] of it by the power of man and by the
[39:36] wisdom of man and by United Nations who
[39:39] never mentioned God's name I'd be a
[39:40] discouraged person but I'm not looking
[39:43] to that for the outcome I look to the
[39:45] pages of this old book here where God
[39:48] wrote it out and everything will come
[39:50] just exactly the way he said it

[1:02:21] the progress of the entire Holy Ghost
[1:02:23] hostilities in the church that is what
[1:02:25] make look something today the son of man
[1:02:27] in a sauna man
[1:02:29] so Jesus Christ was dealing a profit
[1:02:31] which is the Holy Ghost itself and he
[1:02:34] spoke word prophetic words spirit spoken
[1:02:36] words to go and anoint a bride so when
[1:02:39] you ensure that you could be wherever
[1:02:41] the would ever find you that's why
[1:02:43] you're in church today something inside
[1:02:46] of you
[1:02:46] it's what the would connect with or give
[1:02:49] the Lord a shout in the house because
[1:02:51] it's spirit given word hallelujah
[1:02:54] that means hears that word going out it
[1:02:56] means it or not to catch you to put you
[1:02:59] in to reel you in because the word has
[1:03:02] you have to become the sons of God
[1:03:04] that's what powers given for that was
[1:03:06] the word was given for not to become a
[1:03:08] church member but for you to be a
[1:03:10] reproduction of God so church supposed
[1:03:14] to be an Avenue in which you get connect
[1:03:17] back to your God they come back and
[1:03:20] cellphone act activated she supposes
[1:03:22] please way again the activation them
[1:03:24] well you could call him for yourself not

[1:03:30] you have your own line back to your
[1:03:32] father
[1:03:33] I want saying that somebody
[1:03:35] [Applause]
[1:03:41] but this part is incredible after the
[1:03:45] doors of the Gentiles is closed
[1:03:49] God will anoint a church then what does
[1:03:55] that mean
[1:03:56] the doors of the Gentiles is closed by
[1:04:00] the call the Jews the olive tree olive
[1:04:04] branch and God cut them off to put this
[1:04:06] while olive branch in called the
[1:04:09] Gentiles and the bad let's talk about
[1:04:11] the times of the Gentiles until the
[1:04:13] fullness of the Gentiles come in so
[1:04:15] therefore the Gentiles have a specific
[1:04:17] trainer not a specific time but call it
[1:04:19] the fullness of the Gentiles until the
[1:04:21] time the Gentiles come in so it means
[1:04:23] that when that time come in not one more
[1:04:25] name person gonna be saved so don't wait
[1:04:31] for the door to shut because no hard 120
[1:04:35] years where people had opportunity to
[1:04:36] receive it
[1:04:37] do you see the message and then when go
[1:04:40] outside at Eleanor listen time up your
[1:04:42] fullness of time has come
[1:04:43] so started getting honey mothers in two
[1:04:45] by two people see that and told her that
[1:04:47] what you have enough found inside idea
[1:04:49] what that they can funnel or but
[1:04:52] afterwards God shut the door seven days
[1:04:54] into acts had preached into doomed
[1:04:57] people the acts at preaching the people
[1:05:02] who could not be saved
[1:05:04] oh yeah would that repeat again yes in
[1:05:08] church yes people have the composition
[1:05:10] here and can be saved because they were
[1:05:13] already rejected you mean those people
[1:05:15] that act was preaching to no front for
[1:05:17] now yes for seven days until the rains
[1:05:19] are the fall then people say no no I see
[1:05:23] no but the only problem is Noah didn't
[1:05:26] shut the door got it
[1:05:29] and what watch door what shut no man
[1:05:33] could over
[1:05:35] and what God don't man oh God open no

[1:10:38] commoner because whose are welcome here
[1:10:39] that no be the elected
[1:10:41] be the bride that's what you must desire

[1:10:48] random each night we want every person
[1:10:50] that's not a Christian hope something
[1:10:52] will be said or done that you become a
[1:10:54] Christian and if you're not and if you
[1:10:56] have already believed in the Lord Jesus

[1:11:11] and when the last name is added that's
[1:11:14] all of it yours might complete it let's
[1:11:21] go further are you at me when the lamb
[1:11:24] come and took the book out of the right
[1:11:25] hand of him that sat upon the throne
[1:11:27] that was the book of redemption those
[1:11:30] names was put in there before the
[1:11:33] foundation of the world and when that
[1:11:34] last name was called the book the plan
[1:11:38] everything else was revealed then the
[1:11:41] seventh seal is opened by the lamb the
[1:11:43] mystery of the whole Bible was hidden
[1:11:44] there and the last name that goes on the
[1:11:47] book then he changed a little bit or the
[1:11:51] last name that's redeemed that was put
[1:11:54] on that book that settles it he comes to
[1:11:59] claim what he has redeemed so before the
[1:12:02] rapture comes you have to be redeemed
[1:12:05] because he's coming for what he has
[1:12:07] redeemed redeemed by the blood and we

[1:29:28] some that's elected seats in life we all
[1:29:30] know that they got eaten alive and if we
[1:29:32] don't cut it short for their sake no
[1:29:33] flesh shall be saved the world met said
[1:29:36] room every two thousand years we know
[1:29:37] systems as fall apart in the days of
[1:29:39] Noah you know these are Christ and so on
[1:29:42] notice spirit the dynamics of the
[1:29:44] promised Word to drive to get into the
[1:29:48] church and drag them to cover yonder and
[1:29:50] then to the rapture so he prophesied
[1:29:53] that the Spirit will come to drive us to
[1:29:55] Calvary where we have a crucifixion with
[1:29:57] Christ isn't that right
[1:29:59] praise God now you say wait a minute
[1:30:01] know what the prophets rebuke those
[1:30:03] woman and MD is the qalam woman he turns
[1:30:05] no wait a minute you write in the
[1:30:06] scriptures know a woman that lives in
[1:30:08] worldly pleasure can't be the pleasures
[1:30:11] of God so the woman that lives in
[1:30:12] worldly pleasure is dead while she's
[1:30:14] living and that's what the prophet said
[1:30:16] sin poor the woman that lives in this
[1:30:18] worldly condition is dead while she's
[1:30:20] living and if she rejects mercy she can
[1:30:23] cross a separation line where there is
[1:30:25] no place for no more and then where is
[1:30:28] she act with a painted eyes a pot here
[1:30:30] she crossed the line with nowhere to
[1:30:32] come back he has got to be listen
[1:30:34] there's got to be a ministry preach to
[1:30:37] her but remember it's all over it is
[1:30:41] done it's just a haunting
[1:30:43] there will be a ministry that will show
[1:30:46] great signs of wonders
[1:30:47] Joey said so there will be no time for
[1:30:49] redemption it's all over the lamb done
[1:30:50] took his book his redeemed is over as
[1:30:53] Jesus first preached I was rejected and
[1:30:55] then went on haunted dolls that were the
[1:30:57] air preached to them that when prison
[1:30:59] could not repent no time for salvation
[1:31:01] that same ministry will have to repeat
[1:31:04] again what if that could be the triple
[1:31:07] threat you know lost whatever is there I
[1:31:10] hope it's not what if it is think of it
[1:31:12] in a minute now what if it is
[1:31:14] god forbid I got children but it looks
[1:31:16] pretty close Oh hallelujah
[1:31:20] Lois ministry all ministry done the same
[1:31:23] Noah preached exactly went into the ark
[1:31:26] now when he went in the ark there were
[1:31:28] seven days nothing happened and the
[1:31:30] testimony preached to the tomb not by
[1:31:33] speaking in tongues not by dancing in
[1:31:35] the spirit not by join in church not at
[1:31:38] the foot of the Spirit watch but it's
[1:31:40] the word listen dare it is if the only
[1:31:43] unlooked he was Messiah he was the
[1:31:45] Living Word made manifest you said a
[1:31:49] church they'll go right on just the same
[1:31:51] but remember all this time noise in the
[1:31:53] ark the bride commanded no the bride is
[1:31:55] sealed in with Christ
[1:31:56] the last member has been redeemed the
[1:31:59] sixth seal produced itself I mean no
[1:32:01] radical quick we know that judgment is
[1:32:03] not right the seventh seal brings up the
[1:32:06] tree is perfection the ministry comes to
[1:32:09] perfection when it's reduced Christ
[1:32:11] again in natural among human beings he
[1:32:14] did not say the mystic on the perfection
[1:32:16] when the militia capisce mysteries
[1:32:18] he said when Christ is represented like
[1:32:22] we've got to see Christ who's in on all
[1:32:25] flesh we got to see this would become
[1:32:27] flesh not talk not doctrine we had that
[1:32:30] for fifty years it has to be something
[1:32:32] more than that it has to be a life

[2:10:39] governor his ruler he's over all my
[2:10:42] heritage all I have belongs to him oh
[2:10:44] praise Allah that's the reason the
[2:10:46] coming of the seals at the finishing of
[2:10:49] the seventh seal the mystery of God
[2:10:51] should be finished to know who God is
[2:10:53] what he is how he lives his nature his
[2:10:57] being you are supposed to be all the way
[2:10:59] up there by that time to bring us into
[2:11:03] the full stature of the sons of God of
[2:11:05] God
[2:11:06] yeah you come right back to the mystery
[2:11:08] of the seventh seal on a little seven
[2:11:10] scene have seven thunders and he said we
[2:11:12] supposed to be all the way up there like
[2:11:14] that time or them thought you supposed
[2:11:16] to be in there spike that time what time
[2:11:18] the fullness of time when the fullest
[2:11:20] sense of tongue is time to see the
[2:11:22] manifestation of the sons of God we are
[2:11:25] waiting on it Oh glory to God hallelujah
[2:11:28] praise be to Jesus hallelujah seven see
[2:11:32] brother branham know for the endtime
[2:11:34] message this seal he revealed all the
[2:11:38] six seals but he don't say nothing about
[2:11:41] the seventh so the seventh seal is for
[2:11:44] the anti message
[2:11:47] first four seasons in history also 450
[2:11:51] South on the altar for seal the B system
[2:11:53] and so on six-year-old quick 7c silence
[2:11:58] it dosent nothing but a seventh seal
[2:12:01] but the end time seal when it starts
[2:12:03] will be a total secret only when it
[2:12:06] sucks but at the finishing we just read
[2:12:09] that you supposed to be weight of the
[2:12:11] road no all faith and virtue and
[2:12:13] knowledge and tempers after finishing
[2:12:14] what it is for the top of the pyramid
[2:12:16] when the pyramid comes to a stop we are
[2:12:19] at the end time the opening of the
[2:12:21] seventh seal
[2:12:22] Oh glory to God so when he made man a
[2:12:25] god he gave him a domain as a zoo domain
[2:12:27] goes from sea to sea from shore to shore
[2:12:29] he had control of it and Jesus came
[2:12:31] being the one without sin he proved it
[2:12:34] when the winds blow he said peace be
[2:12:35] still so it was more than talk he proved
[2:12:38] it by manifestation isn't that right
[2:12:40] Danny said if you just see this mum can
[2:12:42] be moved though don't you shall have
[2:12:43] what you says so go back to Genesis know
[2:12:46] the world and nature is groaning moving
[2:12:48] for what for the manifestation of the
[2:12:50] sons of God when true sons born sons
[2:12:52] fill son speak and their word is backed
[2:12:54] I believe I know I started getting bored
[2:12:56] of it now see this mountain and brother
[2:12:58] desire so and so I give it to you
[2:13:00] in the name of Jesus Christ oh praise
[2:13:03] God from future Who am I almost done now
[2:13:06] in Ephesians 1:10 he said you're putting
[2:13:08] on is called the fullness of time it's
[2:13:11] called not the seven days called the
[2:13:12] fullness of time when the fullness of
