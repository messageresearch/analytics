[5:41] [Music]
[5:43] we're tonight our title the vision is
[5:49] yet for an appointed time vision is yet
[5:54] fun appointed time I now have an
[5:56] inspiration catch the vision and cope
[6:00] with the word that's the inspiration
[6:04] that I have patched the vision and cope
[6:07] with the word now Jesus he rebuked his
[6:13] own disciples when they didn't have a
[6:17] real positive testimony when he was
[6:20] talking to them after he rose on the
[6:21] dead he actually told them all fools and
[6:25] slow of heart to believe all that the
[6:28] prophets have spoken but not Christ to
[6:31] have suffered these things and to enter
[6:33] into his glory so he was telling them I
[6:36] mean you supposed to know this stuff if
[6:38] I told you I'll be offered I told you
[6:40] all these things but he went on and did
[6:43] something to them and he the Bible says
[6:47] that these are the words this is Luke
[6:52] this is from 24:44 which I spoken to you
[6:55] while I was yet with you that all things
[6:58] must be fulfilled which was written in
[7:02] the law of Moses and in the prophets and
[7:04] in the sons concerning me then open he
[7:09] their understanding that they might
[7:13] understand the scriptures and said unto
[7:16] them thus it is written and thus it
[7:20] behooves Christ to suffer and to rise
[7:23] from the today or from the dead on the
[7:25] third day and so on and who is 49 his
[7:29] pretend is presented to them so now that
[7:31] he's opened it understand in the
[7:33] description opened the word to them he
[7:36] is pretending to them the vision of what
[7:39] they must expect and what they have to
[7:42] look forward to what was the target what
[7:45] was the endgame what was the goal and he
[7:49] said behold I
[7:50] and the promise of my father upon you
[7:53] but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until
[7:56] you be endued with power from on high
[8:00] yellow is a stay there until hey there
[8:04] until this power that I've been loosed
[8:07] by my father because I did a price
[8:10] I paid a price I just come off the cross
[8:14] I am now risen from the dead and know
[8:17] that I have done that nothing could stop
[8:19] the power from being released the power
[8:23] is on its way but be in position to
[8:27] receive it and he Jesus let them as far
[8:31] as the Bethany he lifted up his hands
[8:33] and bless them and it came to pass while
[8:36] he blessed them he was parted from them
[8:39] so Dee was leaving now nobody was crying
[8:42] nobody was depressed nobody was
[8:45] frustrated and Jesus was leaving and
[8:47] they worship him and returned to
[8:50] Jerusalem with great joy he's gone what
[8:59] didn't happen there Jesus told him if I
[9:01] don't go the comforter will not come and
[9:05] they knew he was leaving something as
[9:09] his coming will get the Lord a shout in
[9:12] the house
[9:13] Oh hallelujah and that is when and they
[9:20] were and they were continually in the
[9:22] temple praising and blessing God because
[9:25] now their mind is open up the
[9:28] understanding is open up the world has
[9:30] been Brooke to them
[9:31] praise God not to look for some man that
[9:33] interpret more words to them they don't
[9:36] have to look to some bishop somewhere or
[9:38] some man of God from somewhere or a
[9:41] certain man have to come and do this and
[9:44] this certain man didn't have to look for
[9:45] that no more they got spoken word they
[9:48] got Jesus or words they got the breath
[9:51] of God receiving the Holy Ghost they got
[9:54] the breath of God upon their life no man
[9:56] didn't we get this God spoke it and we
[10:00] are promised we have been promised a
[10:03] quality group jump in today the son of
[10:06] man would be reveal again that's not a
[10:09] son of man that's the son of man so
[10:12] decent a man was filled in that prophet
[10:15] DS Solomon was failed in William Brennan
[10:19] so the words come another prophets mouth
[10:21] wasn't William branham's words what's
[10:24] the words of the Son of Man and the
[10:27] Solomon who came to Abraham he said I
[10:31] will return unto thee according to the
[10:34] time of life appointed this vision of
[10:40] God this prophetic vision that was
[10:44] released by seven seals and seven
[10:46] thunders there's an appointed time for
[10:49] this vision to be fulfilled but this
[10:51] shall be fulfilled it shall come to pass
[10:54] God swore by himself that it going to
[10:58] come to pass or do you believe others
[11:01] even
[11:02] or glory to God hallelujah my Kojima be

[11:16] will return to be a corner time of life
[11:18] to angels went on to Sodom under
[11:21] investigative judgment isn't that right
[11:24] but one angel stays in the backside of
[11:26] the desert with Abraham
[11:27] another angel said the Lord said shall I
[11:30] hide from Abraham the thing which I
[11:32] about to do so caught at the break the
[11:35] seals on the backside of the desert to
[11:38] Abraham to reveal to Abraham judgment

[11:45] but Abram as the elect had to get the
[11:47] divine revelation and vision as Kings
[11:52] that ought to be all glory to God we
[11:55] believe that and because God brought
[11:58] that upon Abraham Abraham brick in the

[26:12] bury me with the rest of my father's
[26:14] cause he know the resurrection was
[26:16] coming or glory to God each one of them
[26:20] prophets know what the other prophets
[26:23] said so they were consulting the
[26:25] prophetic utterance or glory the call of
[26:29] those men of God that went before them
[26:31] to see what the prophecy see because all
[26:35] of them knew it was men that was moved
[26:37] by the spirit so they were not speaking
[26:42] on the intellectual level they were
[26:45] speaking from the intelligence of God
[26:47] that trap tongue into the heart to give
[26:50] them dusty at the Lord Abram said bury
[26:59] me right here with you was buried said

[27:29] they were looking for it so much that
[27:32] because they don't what did only me in
[27:33] Egypt because I'm not generally a
[27:35] football
[27:37] nineteen is only coming in a promised
[27:38] land if they stay in Egypt you can't get
[27:41] this anointing you got what I'm saying
[27:45] glory missin one time one time they were
[27:49] burying a man under hood some enemy
[27:51] coming and if that man in the grave of
[27:54] Elijah and when they just joined on this
[27:56] run when that body hit Elijah bones
[27:59] power

[28:45] in the world
[28:47] [Applause]
[29:09] LeBron said it's got to be a promise the
[29:13] intent addressed what to fear that we
[29:17] don't have a promise but we have a
[29:19] promise the promise is the enter his
[29:21] rest you may be seated

[29:45] here he said watch notice let us
[29:48] therefore fear lisa promise being left
[29:50] us a end in distress so I want you to
[29:53] remember that unless we find out unless
[29:55] God really little us here we go no
[29:58] matter how much we go to church
[29:59] that has nothing to do with it God must
[30:02] come by revelation and reveal himself to
[30:05] us and that takes all the teens of the
[30:08] world out that's not good
[30:15] I'm not hearing of amens on that that's
[30:21] not like 60% something like a 1i how to
[30:25] read it again maybe younger idea God
[30:28] must come by revelation and reveal
[30:32] himself to us and that takes all the
[30:35] world polity that will out
[30:42] because once is being being made plain
[30:45] to you you could run if you read it both
[30:49] walk your run with it

[31:17] have to end into the stress but it
[31:19] shouldn't come short of it so when you
[31:21] know you have a promise don't come short
[31:23] of it you want to be faithful to the
[31:25] promise of God you want to see it
[31:28] manifested in your life not in the
[31:30] church but in your life and then you
[31:34] could come to church with it's in your
[31:35] life you understand - revival in your
[31:38] home
[31:39] you can't start something in the church
[31:41] what you don't have in your home you
[31:43] have to get it on the inside inside now

[32:32] maybe season here's the promise here is
[32:37] what we got to feel if there's not a
[32:40] promise left us but the Prophet said but
[32:44] there is a promise and the next thing
[32:46] don't come short of it now the thought
[32:49] is if we are on our way to the rest what
[32:52] is the rest where is it it is join in
[32:54] church
[32:54] it'll being baptized us is in a way is
[32:57] it becoming remember the greatest church
[32:58] in the city where I met the clothes it
[33:00] is education is it money so we can quit
[33:02] work I'm just laid on rests the rest of
[33:04] our lives that's not it
[33:06] listening to what the Bible says it is
[33:08] let us therefore fear Lisa promise left
[33:12] us the end in turn is rest that you
[33:15] should come short of it for unto us the
[33:18] gospel was preached as well under them
[33:19] what is the gospel the good news the
[33:22] good news came to them in Egypt that
[33:24] quarter said to deliver up he's going to
[33:26] bring us out and take us to the promised
[33:28] land the good news for us now is that
[33:30] God sent a deliverer
[33:32] the Holy Ghost and we are on the road to
[33:35] the promised land and the people has
[33:37] made Cui's and denomination but God
[33:40] still remains that our rest is the Holy
[33:42] Ghost
[33:42] so this rest is the Holy Ghost we are
[33:46] pressing towards the Holy Ghost
[33:48] that's our promised land is the land of
[33:51] the Holy Ghost in that land of power in
[33:54] that line of deliverance in that land of
[33:56] freedom in that land of miracles in that
[33:59] none of anointing in that manner contact
[34:01] with the supernatural in that line of
[34:03] angels descend an angel walking back
[34:06] that's it Matlin oh it's a good man oh
[34:10] he is here tonight Oh blowing up
[34:13] gardening Alleluia
[34:16] somewhere around says here the word
[34:18] preached did not profit them not being
[34:20] mixed with faith and then I heard it
[34:23] so after was it have to go beyond your
[34:24] Shelton priests you have to be praising
[34:27] board on a planet to your own heart he
[34:29] said no no matter how much the word is
[34:30] preached how well you like the way it's
[34:32] being preached unless you yourself a
[34:34] partaker of that it won't do you one bit
[34:37] of good so you gotta say this is - man
[34:39] I'm taking it tonight my taking it back
[34:42] home to my wife
[34:43] Oh glory to God husband love your wife
[34:45] that's the word or glory they're going
[34:48] you have to express it you have to show
[34:49] it you have to live it take it back home
[34:51] hallelujah praise be to Jesus or glory
[34:55] no Gordon and hallelujah you may be
[34:58] seated
[34:58] so Genesis 1 go and let every seat
[35:02] before and after its kind and God could
[35:04] only speak that because quad know to see
[35:06] that the power to transform itself into
[35:08] whatever the seat is isn't that right
[35:11] and but a man was talking about
[35:12] transform to be mean different to what
[35:15] has been its character and everything
[35:17] has to be changed and that's the word to
[35:20] be transformed isn't that right and God
[35:23] saw chaos and darkness and God saw the
[35:25] condition but that didn't intimidate God
[35:29] darkness and chaos and confusion didn't
[35:32] intimidate God all that has to happen is
[35:35] the spirit have the moon
[35:37] I want the spirit moves it has to have a
[35:40] voice because God have to use the voice
[35:42] of his word or glory no God is not just
[35:46] a spirit move this free enough to
[35:48] connect with the voice the voice have to
[35:50] speak and the word becomes that season
[35:53] to produce the miracle Oh glory to God
[35:56] so God transform chaos into a garden in
[36:00] Eden isn't that right
[36:02] everything was perfect he commanded each
[36:05] one of those seeds of what there would
[36:06] be that they would transform themselves
[36:08] into the plant of which kind of life
[36:11] that the Word of God spoken in them
[36:14] should be if it was an oak tree it
[36:17] the bridge what an oak it was a pan was
[36:19] read what a perm
[36:20] because the creator just sent this word
[36:22] and everything under his control now
[36:25] when he put the seed in the earth
[36:27] this seed can only come forth with the
[36:29] power of life within it and that is why
[36:32] God put that seed in you when before the
[36:35] foundation of the world you are not in
[36:38] charge of that seed that's his seed or
[36:41] glory to God let me say it again
[36:43] you are not in charge of that see the
[36:47] predestinated mission who you are he's
[36:49] in charge of that is who is Tanya he
[36:52] called you have to knew you before
[36:54] that's why he called you because he knew
[36:57] the seed where they planted in Nigeria
[37:03] your ceiling whatever village whatever
[37:08] state he had to find you
[37:10] I mean know where you are
[37:13] well glory to God that mother Eagle know
[37:17] where you are
[37:18] he's a seed inside of you oh yes yeah
[37:21] fleshly habits yes you have a human
[37:23] spirit you didn't even know you had
[37:25] acceded when you were smoking and
[37:27] drinking but what was looking after you
[37:29] all the time
[37:30] because you know one day you have to
[37:31] hear that call you have to get that call
[37:34] or glory that God listen we were dead in
[37:37] sin and we heard a call and the people
[37:41] that are dead in the grave they don't
[37:43] hear a whole wonder - Oh glory to God
[37:46] God Collier the Baptist Church of
[37:48] Methodist Church
[37:49] what Collier the University of the
[37:51] drunkenness out of adultery of the
[37:53] fornication what could call you further
[37:55] and transform you into a son and
[37:59] daughter of the Living God to reproduce
[38:02] and manifest Jesus Christ do you believe
[38:06] it amen
[38:07] each one of those seeds let me go you
[38:10] may be seizing each one of those seeds
[38:13] has the power in itself I love this the
[38:20] transform itself into the species that I
[38:24] desire it to be that is what make me
[38:27] that that's what it must be because I
[38:31] have given every seed here we go
[38:34] transformed in power
[38:35] [Applause]
[38:39] to make out of itself in its potentials
[38:43] no to make out of itself exactly what I
[38:47] wanted to be God has never changed
[38:51] I'm just the same as he was then God is
[38:54] he tell me to do something nothing is
[38:56] going to stop him and he will do it
[38:59] that's why when God finished with his
[39:01] works he turned his back and rested
[39:05] because they know every secret word of
[39:07] this guy super obvious guy so what is
[39:13] rested and let the magic work and bored
[39:22] acting on this drama converse the atom
[39:26] like it would I see Adam where do we get
[39:36] a word from how out of position then
[39:45] then humans not a takeover well is the
[39:48] woman he gave me so he began the past
[39:53] epoch and possible and got him young
[39:55] kill a lamb bring this atonement
[39:58] that's very first income because that
[40:00] was required so God couldn't spear them
[40:03] he said the day you eat thereof that did
[40:06] you died and there was no gambling house
[40:08] there was no drinking homes there was
[40:11] this Adam Eve his wife and a gardener
[40:14] Eden and Mansell hip-hop it had no rock
[40:21] star and Hollywood you know man fell in
[40:24] that environment so man can fall
[40:26] anywhere
[40:27] oh I thought you wasn't born in sin and
[40:38] with iniquity I thought with me
[40:39] alone I thought all I was born in sin
[40:42] and ship iniquity understand this if God
[40:45] don't hold you you fall let's let's talk
[40:54] [Applause]
[40:57] so don't play more righteous than anyone
[41:00] inside of here if God don't hold you
[41:06] that's my damn except I look unto the
[41:10] hills from whence cometh my help Maya
[41:13] come from the Lord
[41:25] the decision
[41:27] hallelujah I like what Isaac said this
[41:31] morning about the tapestry of David's
[41:34] life on a young man the king - old man -
[41:38] died cool
[41:39] he God make sure this lifespan from
[41:41] childhood go straight up a whole big
[41:44] circle of life and God call him a man
[41:47] after my own heart you may be seated
[41:51] oh praise the name of the Lord so then
[41:54] God the power to transform and the devil
[41:57] bring up something to deform and the
[41:59] reform is to take us from its original
[42:01] state make something go wrong with it
[42:05] same seed but messed-up same seed much
[42:08] tied up hallelujah we are presently tied
[42:11] up under before sometimes it industry
[42:14] but the twisting but there is coming a
[42:18] power and it's coming a brain that can
[42:21] have revelation 22:17
[42:23] and the voice of that is not go the
[42:28] voice of that is not cut your I have not
[42:32] been with you that's not the voice of it
[42:34] the voice of it the spirit and the bride
[42:36] say come you have your ticket to glory
[42:39] you are both the board the plane you are
[42:42] saying goodbye world what you have time
[42:44] to do to be bitter with anybody or
[42:46] hateful towards anybody you are leaving
[42:49] here your ticket is County your visa is
[42:53] stamped you cannot be deported
[42:57] you came from there
[42:58] [Applause]
[43:04] did you get that you cannot be reported
[43:08] that is wet by your home you're going
[43:13] back home if I was seeking a city whose
[43:18] nature and the ladies thought maybe
[43:24] season you should see me in my home
[43:27] there's no gray headed
[43:32] you should see my house
[43:37] you should see the street leading to my
[43:39] house my god I see the wandering now at
[43:42] all I'm not talking about ensuring that
[43:44] that old house oh my god you should see
[43:49] the real one
[43:50] [Applause]
[43:59] remember season do you understand that
[44:02] God's objective was to bring back the
[44:07] original man that was supposed to be
[44:10] standing in the gadna even as if he
[44:13] never did fall that's why God introduced
[44:17] justification not just forgiveness but
[44:21] justification is you never did it we
[44:26] can't even figure that out but God could
[44:29] because only he as far as I know have a
[44:32] sea of forgetfulness everybody remember
[44:37] what you did but when God take your sins
[44:41] [Applause]
[44:42] [Music]
[44:44] I'm jumping
[44:48] you remember and remember some of the
[44:53] things I've done but Jesus with the
[44:57] special blood forgive me of everyone
[45:14] tonight under the blood of Jesus you can
[45:18] justify I said you never can you never
[45:23] did it because God said so or give the
[45:29] Lord a shout
[45:45] maybe season
[45:48] you see you need to get that because
[45:51] that will affect your confidence to
[45:54] approach the throne of grace with
[45:56] fullness you need to get that because I
[45:59] can affect you from going into the angel
[46:02] does it give me a little book because if
[46:05] you not sure of the salvation of the
[46:08] redemption and predestination
[46:10] you will need think about going to the
[46:12] angel because you were interpret that
[46:14] you're not worthy but the question
[46:16] wasn't if you're worthy Jesus died for
[46:19] you to have access to the book Satan
[46:26] don't have the password to go into the
[46:30] book access denied
[46:43] no you don't eat mustard type in a
[46:46] password you could just put your
[46:48] fingerprint he doesn't have your print
[46:51] no you don't even need a print whisper
[46:55] just show your face Lord Jesus your son
[47:00] and the book opens to you division
[47:04] bricks what the Lord is about to do
[47:12] I told them back home humid season I
[47:18] said they go outside on the street level
[47:20] you seen this street that's true that's
[47:23] true if you fight at that level you
[47:25] would lose you only seen the street I
[47:28] said if you go in a helicopter you will
[47:31] see beyond the streets you will see the
[47:33] village you go higher you see the city
[47:35] you go higher you see the state you go
[47:38] higher you see Nigeria you go higher the
[47:40] Selassie kana you start a city whole of
[47:42] Africa because you're going higher and
[47:44] higher
[47:45] got you see a bigger vision and the
[47:47] vision when you come down to that Street
[47:49] now it changes perspective because you
[47:52] see a broader picture you see the enemy
[47:54] coming on the road they will come along
[47:56] the streets are you moving on that
[47:58] Street or you know cut them off here
[47:59] because what take you up into a vision
[48:01] and when you come down from that vision
[48:03] you are invincible
[48:05] because we know the next move and that's
[48:07] what quarters to Abraham sure I have
[48:09] some Abraham what I'm about to do just
[48:11] think you are here and cause about the
[48:13] biggest seventh on the revival it's
[48:17] about to break
[48:23] it's easy boom man you be seated so
[48:28] caught up in that helicopter gives you a
[48:31] bigger vision hallelujah I had vision
[48:35] that's my father Brandon was so caught
[48:37] up beside seated right called I see she
[48:40] sealed in the king but who is it looking
[48:43] from he's talking from up dear he see
[48:45] you sealed he said Oh God so close I
[48:49] could feel it my god sons of God going
[48:53] down the streets some praise God silver
[48:56] gold have I none he said god help me
[48:58] live to see it he says it's so close I
[49:01] could see it missing limbs being
[49:05] restored the prophet prophesied missing
[49:08] limbs that's why I'm excited because we
[49:13] have a lot to look forward to
[49:17] oh there's a lot of negative plus a
[49:22] negative we could go into but we're not
[49:25] talking about that we talking about
[49:26] Bridal promises and the vision I have to
[49:28] be clear to you because windows guys got
[49:31] the vision from Jesus they were clean
[49:33] and clear about what they were about
[49:35] that's why the Whitney up Aroon and
[49:38] written in sphere it's not that they
[49:43] were they was rolling no no they were
[49:45] fearful but they know what they expected
[49:48] forward to take away that fear they were
[49:51] nervous but power control take over all
[49:53] of that this power is promised I love it
[49:57] I love it I love it
[49:58] Oh chlorine Oh God in the upper room was
[50:01] pastor and congregation apostle and
[50:04] congregation with chiffon congregation
[50:06] everybody was of me upper room the hut
[50:08] was the hideous prom because power is
[50:10] from the father or do you believe that
[50:13] tonight Oh glory to God hallelujah amen
[50:18] amen amen glory to God so before before
[50:23] the word could be manifested a seed have
[50:26] to be spoken
[50:27] let there be let there be let there be
[50:29] that's the word seed and then it's
[50:32] manifested is the real seed so gotta to
[50:35] speak you first so you are thought
[50:41] bypasses you offer me the world God send
[50:43] a prophet to connect you back with your
[50:45] world so when you hear the word preach
[50:47] you connect with it because the word is
[50:49] an expression of you the thought of what
[50:52] you are you are become a word expression
[50:55] so you have to connect with the world or
[50:57] glow in the world you can't help it this
[51:00] part of your makeup is part of your core
[51:02] it's part of the gene and your soul you
[51:05] can't help it I'm gonna be a perfect
[51:08] Melanie I'm gonna be a perfect man
[51:11] because that is my season
[51:13] [Applause]
[51:21] but if I'm talking about ministers can
[51:23] be half way go to McCaffrey preachers
[51:25] but we just could be hovering reason
[51:27] they get their own we'd messed up and an
[51:31] interrupted program over for their lives
[51:32] but God don't make a free preachers he
[51:34] makes full preachers he put something in
[51:37] since the teach preach as the preach
[51:39] isn't that right but the thing about
[51:41] them we can get mixed up and messed up
[51:43] in our own human spirit and affect the
[51:45] program of God because God wants to be
[51:47] conductors of the Spirit so we have to
[51:50] become the world isn't that right and
[51:52] once you become the word then you become
[51:54] a conductor like the speakin flow true
[51:56] difference that mashing up and doing
[51:58] that other things I give us hope to come
[52:00] out of the way if I come out of the way
[52:02] tonight who is speaking
[52:05] you said wherever gift the givers hope
[52:07] they come out of the way that the Holy
[52:09] Spirit will operate and speak to that
[52:12] gift where's a teaching give a prophetic
[52:14] if whatever gift it is it's how the cut
[52:16] out of the way and once man move out God
[52:19] moves in you hear from God and you know
[52:22] you hear from God all glory to God so
[52:25] sin John 14:12 is a season the same
[52:27] works I do shall you also send John 15:7
[52:30] is a seed if you're batting me in my
[52:32] ways I value you can ask what you will
