[1:20:56] ok let me see the guitar up here the
[1:20:58] preaches in the house or the preacher is
[1:21:01] in the house as I signed to get out the
[1:21:05] preacher says nothing's even focus okay
[1:21:09] let's go if you have met every
[1:21:11] requirement all aback a little bit in
[1:21:15] the crucial hour no doubt she checked up
[1:21:17] she said Lord I've done what I know how
[1:21:19] to do when you have done everything that
[1:21:23] you know how to do and met every
[1:21:25] requirement that God has required that
[1:21:28] is where he takes a home that is where
[1:21:32] faith comes in if you have met every
[1:21:36] choir man that God require you to do
[1:21:37] then sometimes God tests your feet to
[1:21:41] see what kind of reaction you have on an
[1:21:43] action oh he's good at that he just lets
[1:21:48] proves whether we really believe what
[1:21:51] you think you believe you know he does
[1:21:54] that many times so by accepting it only
[1:21:57] it won't only do really just by
[1:22:00] accepting it won't only do God has got
[1:22:05] to vindicate back that he has accepted
[1:22:09] you that's the thing you can accept him
[1:22:13] but then when he accepts you stay right
[1:22:17] there until he accepts you
[1:22:19] [Applause]
[1:22:22] they believe the word that's good you
[1:22:25] receive the word that's good but stadium
[1:22:27] because this is my son and pleased to
[1:22:31] dwell in except you and when he does
[1:22:34] here we go
[1:22:35] I already he seals you into his kingdom
[1:22:39] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit that
[1:22:42] is when God except you that i shaken
[1:22:45] with the pastor of the church that's
[1:22:46] when God accept you he seals you into
[1:22:49] the kingdom put his mark upon you not a
[1:22:53] church mark this man his seal and you
[1:22:58] are sealed until the day of your
[1:23:00] redemption the delicate touch it and we
[1:23:03] can't break it it is the seal of God or
[1:23:07] give the Lord a shout Oh hallelujah Amen
[1:23:12] so stay there until he accepts you and
[1:23:15] when he does he sees you into the
[1:23:17] kingdom by the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:19] Spirit and if you say you believe him
[1:23:21] and never received the Holy Ghost yet
[1:23:24] then God hasn't recognized your feet but
[1:23:27] God gave Abraham a sign of recognition
[1:23:29] of his fate by circumcision and it gives
[1:23:33] you a sign of recognition of your
[1:23:35] confessed faith in him when he gives you
[1:23:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost to seal it
[1:23:40] as a finished work isn't that right and
[1:23:43] he said this on future home he said
[1:23:46] watch the earth was baptized and it is
[1:23:49] on or underwater it was sanctified by
[1:23:51] the blood of Jesus dripping on it and a
[1:23:53] new earth to come is to have holy fire
[1:23:55] the cleaner of every devil every germ
[1:23:58] every sickness everything that it is and
[1:24:00] make a new heaven newer and then he said
[1:24:03] you and the same way God redeemed the
[1:24:05] earth he redeems the individual you
[1:24:07] become a new person not just an old
[1:24:09] patched up one by joining church and
[1:24:12] telling a new page but you are complete
[1:24:15] brand new unit God takes the old man and
[1:24:19] brings them out completely out
[1:24:21] [Applause]
[1:24:24] with what fire not mysteries fire not
[1:24:31] teaching onward fire what does the
[1:24:34] church need fire get the load of praise
[1:24:42] God takes the old man Elizabeth
[1:24:45] completely out with Hulagu boost and
[1:24:47] fire and comes himself and sends down
[1:24:50] your representation fall as Jean taught
[1:24:55] me I'm God God sends down that
[1:24:57] representation by the baptism of the
[1:25:01] Holy Ghost
[1:25:02] so whenever God sent a gift to the earth
[1:25:05] anyone who rejects it it becomes it
[1:25:08] becomes cast in a generation
[1:25:10] they never prosper they end up in
[1:25:12] judgment under the nation's as we know
[1:25:15] as Bible readers that in reason Solomon
[1:25:17] was a golden age for Israel why because
[1:25:19] all the people had one Accord rallying
[1:25:21] around that great gift that Solomon had
[1:25:23] from God I wonder what would take place
[1:25:26] tonight if all the churches in United
[1:25:29] States would rally around the gift that
[1:25:31] God has given us that is the Holy Ghost
[1:25:36] [Music]
[1:25:37] some people wish it was some mañana they
[1:25:41] all want to put some manatee picture but
[1:25:44] the gift that God gave us the Holy Ghost
[1:25:45] God's gift what if all the churches
[1:25:48] would break down their barriers and
[1:25:50] would rally or wrong the great gift of
[1:25:54] godly Bradley love and the baptism of
[1:25:57] the Holy Spirit it may be the greatest
[1:25:59] defense this Nisshin could have it will
[1:26:01] be better than all these scientists
[1:26:03] atomic bombs and so forth that we could
[1:26:05] invent oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:26:07] almost done he said this is our age 11th
[1:26:10] hour world war stopped on the eleventh
[1:26:13] month of the year the eleventh day of
[1:26:14] the month the eleventh hour of the day
[1:26:16] dilemma not an hour and the eleventh
[1:26:18] hour people might come in and receive
[1:26:20] what the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:23] that's why the quality let me turn your
[1:26:25] Gentile workers what is it
[1:26:27] the walls are struggling struggling here
[1:26:29] struggling they're struggling what for
[1:26:31] the atomic bombs and everything else are
[1:26:32] being built up but they can't do it they
[1:26:34] can't do it until the joules get a
[1:26:37] visitation of the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:39] Ghost hold it till we seal the servants
[1:26:43] and their foreheads and before they are
[1:26:46] sealed there's a bride to be sealed
[1:26:50] but the angel from the east having the
[1:26:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost final coat and

[1:32:29] morning in the precious name of Jesus
[1:32:30] Christ if you have your Bibles would you
[1:32:35] turn in me to two portions of Scripture
[1:32:38] this morning
[1:32:40] reading from Isaiah 21 and reading from
[1:32:45] Ezekiel 33 Isaiah 21 and reading verse
[1:32:53] 11 the burden of Douma he called to me
[1:32:59] out of Sarah watchman what of the night
[1:33:02] watchman what of the night the watchman
[1:33:06] said the morning commit and also the
[1:33:09] night
[1:33:09] if you will inquire inquire ye return
[1:33:13] come and read in Ezekiel 33 and reading
[1:33:18] from verse 1 Ezekiel 33 and reading from
[1:33:24] verse 1 again the word of the Lord came
[1:33:28] unto me seeing son of man speak to the
[1:33:30] children of thy people and say unto them
[1:33:34] when i bring the sword upon a land
[1:33:36] notice he said when i bring the sword
[1:33:40] upon a land if the people of the land
[1:33:43] take a man of their coasts and set him
[1:33:47] for the watchmen if when he see the
[1:33:50] sword come upon the land he blow the
[1:33:54] trumpet and warn the people then
[1:33:57] whosoever hear it the sound of the
[1:33:59] trumpet and take it not warning if the
[1:34:02] sword come and take him away his blood
[1:34:05] shall be upon his own hand he heard the
[1:34:09] sound of the trumpet and took not
[1:34:11] warning his blood shall be upon him but
[1:34:14] he that taketh warning shall deliver his
[1:34:17] soul but if the watchman see the sword
[1:34:20] come and blow not the trumpet and the
[1:34:23] people be not warned if the sword come
[1:34:27] and he
[1:34:27] any person from among them he is taken
[1:34:31] away in his iniquity but his blood will
[1:34:34] I require at the watchman's hand so thou
[1:34:38] son of man I have said thee a watchman
[1:34:41] unto the house of Israel therefore thou
[1:34:44] shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn
[1:34:47] them from me when I say unto the wicked
[1:34:51] a wicked man thou shalt surely die if
[1:34:54] dough does not speak to warn the wicked
[1:34:56] from his way that wicked man shall die
[1:34:59] in his iniquity but his blood will I
[1:35:02] require at thine hand nevertheless if
[1:35:06] thou warn the wicked of his way to turn
[1:35:08] from it if he do not turn from his way
[1:35:10] he shall die in his iniquity but thou
[1:35:14] has delivered thy soul therefore all
[1:35:18] those son of man speak unto the house of
[1:35:20] Israel thus he speaks seeing if our
[1:35:22] transgressions and our sins be upon us
[1:35:25] and we pine away in them how should we
[1:35:27] then live say unto them as I live saith
[1:35:30] the Lord God I have no pleasure in the
[1:35:32] death of the wicked but that the wicked
[1:35:35] turn from his way and live turn attorney
[1:35:39] from your evil ways for why will he die
[1:35:42] o house of Israel may the Lord and a
[1:35:45] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:35:48] may be seated
[1:35:54] everybody feeling fine so before I touch
[1:35:58] the text because it's a pretty serious
[1:36:00] text and I told Burt over it it's a it's
[1:36:05] interesting title that I have this
[1:36:06] morning but I feel persuaded that the
[1:36:10] season has changed and a cry as going
[1:36:14] out Watchmen Watchmen what of the night
[1:36:16] and with the Branham when he was
[1:36:19] speaking on this subject
[1:36:21] she was crying out to the church
[1:36:24] speaking of what was to come and on this
[1:36:27] day and on this week that's Holy Week we
[1:36:30] could vividly look back through the word
[1:36:32] of this day when Jesus interrupted
[1:36:35] Jerusalem in a way that it had never
[1:36:38] happened before and just a yes P
[1:36:41] the picture of a background that
[1:36:43] Jerusalem by definition means a city of
[1:36:45] peace but for years there was no peace
[1:36:49] from leadership to leadership from
[1:36:51] government to civilization the Jews have
[1:36:54] been run by the Romans and it was
[1:36:56] military oppression there was religious
[1:36:59] oppression there was persecution and
[1:37:01] there was no peace in the natural nor
[1:37:03] was there peace in the spiritual the
[1:37:05] Pharisees the scribes and the Sadducees
[1:37:08] and those who were entrusted with the
[1:37:10] responsibility to lead a churn of Israel
[1:37:13] so their spiritual destination had
[1:37:15] abandoned their jobs it had become
[1:37:20] commonplace they had become used to it
[1:37:22] they had become relaxed they have taken
[1:37:24] it for granted so when Jesus came he
[1:37:26] came and started to break up the system
[1:37:29] break up what was the expected norm he
[1:37:32] broke up the tradition he broke up the
[1:37:35] expectation he was disturbed by the way
[1:37:38] they took the word for granted he was
[1:37:40] disturbed by how casual they were he was
[1:37:43] disturbed by their lack of faith and in
[1:37:45] so much that when the Centurion came to
[1:37:48] him and asked for his servant to be
[1:37:50] healed Jesus could have said I'm not
[1:37:52] even seen fit like this in all of Israel
[1:37:54] because the cheran of Israel had lost
[1:37:56] their way as it was but when Jesus came
[1:37:59] he came to restore his order not an
[1:38:01] older order but he came to restore his
[1:38:04] order so there was a revolution that was
[1:38:07] taking place in Jerusalem but this
[1:38:10] revolution where the night was a quiet
[1:38:12] revolution because Jesus was not
[1:38:15] advertising himself he was not trying to
[1:38:18] build a reputation for himself the Bible
[1:38:20] says that Jesus in Matthew 12 he didn't
[1:38:24] cry nor strive nor cause his voice to be
[1:38:27] heard in the streets he wasn't screaming
[1:38:30] on the corner he wasn't trying to get
[1:38:32] everybody's attention in matthew 16 he
[1:38:35] charged his disciples to tell no man
[1:38:38] that he was Jesus the Christ in sin mark
[1:38:41] 5 after he raised gyruss daughter he
[1:38:45] told those who witness it that they
[1:38:47] should tell no man what had happened
[1:38:51] so Jesus was running an underground
[1:38:53] movement he was not looking for
[1:38:55] everybody he was looking for special
[1:38:58] people he was looking for a Peter
[1:39:00] somewhere he was looking for an Andrew
[1:39:02] somewhere he was looking for uh
[1:39:04] Nathaniel somewhere and he was bringing
[1:39:06] enough of a fan of an experience that he
[1:39:10] could be fully persuaded that this was
[1:39:12] the truth he was bringing two
[1:39:14] individuals a personal experience that
[1:39:18] they couldn't hear from somebody else
[1:39:20] but his sword for themselves that this
[1:39:23] was different that this was exceptional
[1:39:25] that this was Word made flesh up that
[1:39:28] this was scripture being fulfilled that
[1:39:30] this was a man like no other manner you
[1:39:34] don't hear me this morning when Jesus
[1:39:36] came down from Mount Transfiguration he
[1:39:39] told his disciples that this should tell
[1:39:42] no man what things they had seen him
[1:39:44] till the Son of Man was risen from the
[1:39:46] dead
[1:39:47] so those men will close into secrecy you
[1:39:50] don't hear me this morning in John 6
[1:39:52] after Jesus fed the 5,000 the Bible said
[1:39:56] when Jesus perceived from what he had
[1:40:00] done that the multitude will come and
[1:40:03] take him to make him her King Jesus
[1:40:06] departed himself into the mountain alone
[1:40:09] he took kept away from the crowd he said
[1:40:12] my always not yet come I am a king but
[1:40:15] my or is not yet come I will be in
[1:40:17] charge but my hour is not yet come and
[1:40:20] no you want me to leave but my hour is
[1:40:22] not yet come but on this day over two
[1:40:27] thousand years ago we celebrate Jesus
[1:40:29] riding into Jerusalem Jesus broke the
[1:40:33] silence of his ministry Jesus no longer
[1:40:38] told the people keep it quiet people
[1:40:41] Jesus no longer swore them to secrecy
[1:40:44] Jesus no longer acts em to keep it a
[1:40:47] secret he wanted everybody to know who
[1:40:50] he was he wanted everybody to know what
[1:40:54] he had done he wanted everybody to know
[1:40:56] about his ministry
[1:41:00] hallelujah whoo you may be seated
[1:41:04] just laying a background for a message
[1:41:06] this morning so Jesus is making his
[1:41:08] public entry and many of us we live in
[1:41:11] secrets we live secret lives
[1:41:13] nobody knows our testimony nobody knows
[1:41:16] that we're a Christian nobody knows what
[1:41:19] the Bible says every knee has got to bow
[1:41:21] and every tongue will have to confess
[1:41:23] that Jesus Christ is Lord and one of
[1:41:27] these days what's hidden will have to
[1:41:29] come out and your secret testimony must
[1:41:32] become a public testimony because God
[1:41:35] must be able to see there is my spirit
[1:41:38] up through in freely there has to be a
[1:41:41] time in your life when it's unveiled who
[1:41:44] you really are it's no longer secret
[1:41:46] it's no longer mystery it's no longer
[1:41:49] hiding in church but it's God Himself
[1:41:52] living something out somebody say man
[1:41:58] hallelujah I'm gonna strike my text
[1:42:03] similar one but just so we understand it
[1:42:06] was no longer secret because Jesus had
[1:42:10] just left Bethany we've said this before
[1:42:12] and in Bethany is where Jesus had an
[1:42:16] experience he didn't want to go there
[1:42:20] because the last time he was there he
[1:42:22] ran into some problems with the brothers
[1:42:24] but over the end Bethany is where
[1:42:26] Lazarus lived and when Lazarus was sick
[1:42:29] Jesus was weary to go there because the
[1:42:33] brothers over they had problems with his
[1:42:35] teaching and his ministry but when
[1:42:37] Lazarus died Jesus decided to go and the
[1:42:41] situation was death all around the focus
[1:42:44] had shifted from him coming to Lazarus
[1:42:46] is weak Lazarus is funeral the
[1:42:50] preparation them your arrangements for
[1:42:52] Lazarus when Jesus lifted nobody really
[1:42:55] paid Jesus any mind but when Jesus got
[1:42:58] there he asked the question where have
[1:43:00] you laid him and I could imagine people
[1:43:02] thought maybe Jesus just came to pay his
[1:43:04] respects maybe he just came to see a
[1:43:07] last look at maybe we
[1:43:08] Lazarus was resting but when Jesus came
[1:43:11] near you roll away the stone because you
[1:43:14] wanted to get access to the problem you
[1:43:16] wanted to get access to the situation he
[1:43:18] wanted to get access to what was not
[1:43:20] looking good was that smelling good was
[1:43:22] not behaving good and when he stood
[1:43:25] there and the stone was rolled away
[1:43:26] he said Lazarus come forth that was not
[1:43:29] man that was more than man jesus wept
[1:43:32] just before that but when Lazarus
[1:43:34] started coming out they realize that
[1:43:36] this was just too much they couldn't
[1:43:38] keep it secret anymore because
[1:43:40] resurrection power had made itself
[1:43:43] visible among them visible between them
[1:43:46] and I believe this morning resurrection
[1:43:49] power resurrection power power to raise
[1:43:54] you up power to get you to worship power
[1:43:57] to heal you power to set you free
[1:44:01] resurrection power in this Easter season
[1:44:05] but the Branham said there will be an
[1:44:07] Easter for the bride all these years to
[1:44:10] see that whether the ground
[1:44:12] from the Alpha Church has been pressing
[1:44:15] its way to the church ages up to a full
[1:44:18] restoration in the Omega bride of what
[1:44:21] they had in the Alpha Church up here
[1:44:23] will be an ISA for this bride and the
[1:44:26] devil is in trouble the devil is in
[1:44:29] trouble because there's nothing he can
[1:44:31] do about it
[1:44:32] the devil is in trouble because he tried
[1:44:34] before and he filled with Jesus and
[1:44:38] Jesus said the same words I do you are
[1:44:41] gonna do all so he said you are me we're
[1:44:44] gonna be one and intact here you wanna
[1:44:46] know that I am the father you and me and
[1:44:49] I in you if the devil couldn't stop
[1:44:51] Jesus up how could the devil stop you if
[1:44:54] the devil could not defeat Jesus up how
[1:44:57] could the devil defeat you
[1:45:00] you come from God you are going back to
[1:45:04] God your genetic structure is his
[1:45:07] genetic structure your genetic code is
[1:45:11] his genetic code hallelujah Oprah Liza I
[1:45:17] don't know when it's gonna happen but
[1:45:19] it's gonna happen one of these days I'm
[1:45:22] gonna be gone one of these days I'm
[1:45:24] leaving this world one of these days I'm
[1:45:26] getting out of here what day I don't
[1:45:29] know what is gonna be but we know it's
[1:45:31] gonna happen we believe it's gonna
[1:45:33] happen
[1:45:34] we receive is gonna happen hallelujah
[1:45:41] you may be seated just like Jesus can I
[1:45:44] type you this morning just like Jesus
[1:45:47] from the moment he was born
[1:45:49] he was on a journey he was not in
[1:45:52] control over where he went he was not in
[1:45:55] control of the house he grew up in them
[1:45:57] he was not in control he was walking on
[1:46:00] her journey that had been cut out for
[1:46:02] him hallelujah
[1:46:07] he was a man born with a mission he was
[1:46:10] a man on a mission and you will hear
[1:46:12] this morning you are born with a mission
[1:46:14] and you are on a mission when Jesus
[1:46:17] walked on water that was yes on the
[1:46:20] mission but that was not the mission he
[1:46:22] was on a journey he walked on water that
[1:46:25] was part of the journey
[1:46:26] He shed fed 5,000 that was part of the
[1:46:29] journey
[1:46:30] he went to gyruss house that was part of
[1:46:33] the journey he met a woman at the well
[1:46:36] that was part of the journey but he was
[1:46:39] heading somewhere he was going somewhere
[1:46:42] The Devil's trying to figure it out the
[1:46:44] devil doesn't know what's gonna happen
[1:46:45] because of the devil knew was gonna
[1:46:48] happen he was gonna stop it but God hid
[1:46:51] it gonna hit it from the devil if the
[1:46:55] devil knew that the shedding of Jesus
[1:46:58] blood was gonna cause such a big problem
[1:47:00] for his kingdom he would have given
[1:47:03] Jesus security he would have given Jesus
[1:47:05] an ambulance every
[1:47:07] he went to make sure Jesus doesn't fall
[1:47:10] down Jesus doesn't get a cut Jesus but
[1:47:15] the devil doesn't know the plans he
[1:47:17] doesn't know the solution he doesn't
[1:47:19] know what God has already written in
[1:47:21] blood that made sure there was nothing
[1:47:24] gonna stop Jesus from making it to
[1:47:26] Calvary there was nothing stopping Jesus
[1:47:30] from walking up that hill there was
[1:47:32] nothing you may be seated
[1:47:36] what's gonna stop you what's gonna stop
[1:47:40] you you may be seated
[1:47:42] [Applause]
[1:47:49] even when Jesus mother nights was going
[1:47:53] up to Calvary and he couldn't carry it
[1:47:56] across anymore God had somebody in
[1:48:02] position to carry it across with him but
[1:48:07] the mission had to be finished
[1:48:09] there was no failure to be accepted in
[1:48:12] this mission this mission had to be
[1:48:14] successful and the mission that God has
[1:48:17] written about your life has got to be
[1:48:19] successful every trial you have walked
[1:48:22] into that's part of the journey that's
[1:48:24] not the mission you picked up a house
[1:48:28] you picked up a job that's not the
[1:48:30] mission that's on the journey what
[1:48:33] you're heading to the mission don't let
[1:48:35] that stop on the journey change your
[1:48:37] focus from the mission you've got to get
[1:48:40] to the mission you have got to get to
[1:48:42] the Holy Ghost you have got to get to
[1:48:44] adoption you have got to get to
[1:48:46] perfection you have got to get to the
[1:48:48] rapture you've got to get to Calvary
[1:48:50] you've got
[1:48:55] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:49:02] Lord hallelujah and when Jesus arrived
[1:49:06] they worshiped him because he did what
[1:49:09] nobody else had done they worshiped him
[1:49:11] because they saw something and when you
[1:49:13] come to God and come to the world and
[1:49:15] come to the message it must be that you
[1:49:18] see something it must be that something
[1:49:21] triggers in your soul that takes you
[1:49:23] beyond your human relationships take you
[1:49:26] beyond your familial relationships take
[1:49:29] you beyond your family and your friend
[1:49:31] that if you are standing alone you would
[1:49:32] still stand because it's your experience
[1:49:35] it's your testimony it's not based on
[1:49:38] anybody else but it's based on your
[1:49:40] experience with God it's not this video
[1:49:43] experience with the church it's based on
[1:49:45] your experience with God if you
[1:49:48] experience it's based on the church you
[1:49:50] will feel if you experience his peace
[1:49:52] and reading a quote that will fail but
[1:49:55] if you experience his peace on an
[1:49:56] encounter with God there's no man ever
[1:49:59] met a pillar of fire and left the same
[1:50:02] way
[1:50:04] nobody ever met a pillar of fire and
[1:50:07] left the same way something happen on
[1:50:10] the inside and when God operates on you
[1:50:13] you cannot reverse the effects of his
[1:50:15] operation
[1:50:16] you cannot undo what God has done and
[1:50:19] God has elected you nobody could undo
[1:50:23] your mistakes cannot undo what God has
[1:50:27] already done there's no power strong
[1:50:29] enough to undo when God said I
[1:50:33] predestinated you there's no power
[1:50:36] there's no depression there's no
[1:50:38] situation guess no child yes no testin
[1:50:42] yes no opposition there's no confusion
[1:50:46] there's no mind battle
[1:50:51] somebody give got a soda praise you know
[1:50:55] what's happening the devil just hit the
[1:50:57] panic button the devil just hit the
[1:51:02] panic button because the brother branham
[1:51:04] said the moment the bride gets to know
[1:51:06] who she is then the rapture is gonna go
[1:51:09] the moment the bride gets to know who
[1:51:12] she is she's a mighty marching army
[1:51:15] she's an invincible marching army you
[1:51:20] may be seated if that be the case the
[1:51:25] most important thing this morning is for
[1:51:27] you to know who you are I'll see them
[1:51:36] again if that be the case then the most
[1:51:39] important revelation you can get is who
[1:51:42] you are because who you are is what
[1:51:45] gives you the key to have access if you
[1:51:48] don't know who you are
[1:51:49] then you operate a certain way but if
[1:51:51] you know who you are then you know what
[1:51:53] belongs to you you understand the rights
[1:51:56] that are yours it's something else when
[1:51:58] you see a boss's son operate in a store
[1:52:00] or you see a prince of a country operate
[1:52:03] because they understand who they are
[1:52:05] they understand the authority that they
[1:52:08] have and the devil's job is to tell you
[1:52:12] or nobody you're not gonna make it
[1:52:15] you didn't see a mistake you didn't
[1:52:17] remember what happened
[1:52:18] you don't see what he said about you you
[1:52:20] don't remember what you did and that's
[1:52:22] his job and he has his job to do we're
[1:52:24] not trying to deny him doing his job but
[1:52:26] we ever talked to do this morning to
[1:52:28] remind ourselves to encourage ourselves
[1:52:31] I come from God
[1:52:33] I'm going back to God so he's slimmy yet
[1:52:37] still I trust him yea though I walk
[1:52:39] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:52:41] death
[1:52:42] that was David encouraging himself I
[1:52:44] will fear no evil
[1:52:46] Oh toward thousand falling my right
[1:52:49] go ten thousand falling my left I shall
[1:52:52] not be moved
[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:52:57] hallelujah he may be seated
[1:53:00] Oh just to bring this to closure so when
[1:53:05] the people will worship Him because they
[1:53:07] were recognizing that they were in the
[1:53:08] presence of deity the Pharisee that the
[1:53:11] audacity to see that you are worshiping
[1:53:13] too much you are too excited
[1:53:17] there's too much expectation that's not
[1:53:20] how we normally worship there's just too
[1:53:23] much noise and the cry of honor
[1:53:25] is really a cry for help that cry of
[1:53:29] Hosanna is a word of praise that really
[1:53:31] means help so the children of rain
[1:53:35] Israel I realize that user realized that
[1:53:37] help was actually in their midst and
[1:53:42] [Applause]
[1:53:45] when they would actually went to Jesus
[1:53:47] that Jesus can you tell the people to
[1:53:49] calm down can you tell the people to
[1:53:53] lower the expectation can you tell the
[1:53:56] people that they cannot be delivered
[1:53:57] right now and Jesus responded say I
[1:54:00] can't stop them because if I tell them
[1:54:03] to hold their peace then the rocks the
[1:54:10] rocks are going to cry out nature is
[1:54:13] going to cry out in fact the whole of
[1:54:16] creation is crying out the whole of
[1:54:19] nature is revealing for the
[1:54:20] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:54:24] [Applause]
[1:54:27] hallelujah he may be seated and the
[1:54:32] disciples didn't even understand what
[1:54:35] was really taking place they didn't
[1:54:38] really understand what was going on but
[1:54:40] they was still worshiping and I say this
[1:54:45] morning friends that that same Holy
[1:54:47] Ghost the same Holy Spirit as where the
[1:54:49] random type is here to drive us all to
[1:54:53] our Calvary and then to the rapture I
[1:54:59] want to say a few things before I strike
[1:55:01] my text and but the ranima and the
[1:55:04] message the world is again falling apart
[1:55:07] he said I look for a rapture for just a
[1:55:11] handful of people that's right just a
[1:55:14] handful of people now this is very
[1:55:18] powerful but the random said next
[1:55:20] they'll never be missed in the world
[1:55:23] when they go you'll never know it's gone
[1:55:29] that's right it will come like a thief
[1:55:31] in the night but the random goal so when
[1:55:36] he said if you don't cut the work short
[1:55:37] for the elected sake if you don't got it
[1:55:44] short for their sake no flesh would be
[1:55:47] saved so where we at brother branham
[1:55:50] cries out we see nations breaking and
[1:55:53] Israel weakening the sign that is Bible
[1:55:56] for toll for this day we see the
[1:55:58] mechanical things taking place now the
[1:56:01] spirit the dynamics of that promise word
[1:56:04] to get into the church and drive them
[1:56:08] into Calvary on unto the rapture there
[1:56:13] we are and Calvary represents for us
[1:56:18] that death death to our feelings that
[1:56:23] our desires depth of our personal
[1:56:27] expectations our personal experiences
[1:56:31] our personal feelings about things on
[1:56:35] the cross is where you are mocked you
[1:56:38] will laugh that you are scoffed at you
[1:56:40] reviled and like Jesus your response
[1:56:45] must be Father forgive them for they
[1:56:49] know not what they're doing it's a
[1:56:55] journey that we all must take but it
[1:56:58] takes a power to drive us to Calvary we
[1:57:03] cannot do it in our own strength because
[1:57:06] even Jesus looking at Calvary in prayer
[1:57:09] acts were it not to happen and if Jesus
[1:57:14] who had the power at that moment in the
[1:57:18] Garden of Gethsemane with crowd Issei
[1:57:21] Lord if it is possible let this cup pass
[1:57:24] that Calvary experience was not an
[1:57:29] appealing thing it is not appealing for
[1:57:33] you to give up of yourself and to deny
[1:57:35] yourself that's what I spoke one in
[1:57:39] Diggle Martin on Tuesday if any man
[1:57:41] wants to follow me let him deny himself
[1:57:43] and take up his cross and follow me that
[1:57:50] denying of yourself means giving up the
[1:57:55] stuff that you want to do like to do
[1:57:57] things you should do because there's
[1:57:59] something more important at stake your
[1:58:04] soul is at stake and we read a scripture
[1:58:07] were warning this morning and I'm at a
[1:58:10] watchman and God is speaking and he's
[1:58:15] telling Ezekiel Ezekiel when i bring the
[1:58:17] sword of judgment it's your place to
[1:58:22] appoint a watchman and that watchman's
[1:58:25] job is to look for the uncommon threads
[1:58:29] and when the trap is seen his job is to
[1:58:32] warn the people to blow the trumpet but
[1:58:37] if the trumpet is blown and the people
[1:58:39] do not secure themselves
[1:58:42] Tenace on their heads
[1:58:45] but at the warning or the threat comes
[1:58:49] and a watchman does nothing about it
[1:58:51] even though the people are affected by
[1:58:56] it their blood is under watchman's and
[1:59:01] so I said in Daegu Martin on Tuesday
[1:59:05] night said peak preaching is a very
[1:59:07] dangerous thing it's very dangerous
[1:59:11] because if what is said from the pulpit
[1:59:14] is wrong God will hold the speaker
[1:59:19] accountable it's a dangerous thing for
[1:59:26] the preacher it's also a dangerous thing
[1:59:28] for the people because when the word
[1:59:30] goes forth in truth and he didn't act
[1:59:33] upon the word then it's on your head
[1:59:35] it's now your responsibility so can I
[1:59:40] just speak about the Watchmen a little
[1:59:42] bit so for a title this morning not on
[1:59:46] my watch
[1:59:48] and my prayer my desire is that for this
[1:59:52] week that will be your personal
[1:59:54] statement not on my watch
[1:59:57] in the natural you'll co-principal go in
[2:00:01] front of a school and tell the
[2:00:03] schoolchildren you see what's going on
[2:00:05] between these glasses not on my watch
[2:00:09] action will be taken to prevent whatever
[2:00:12] you guys are trying to do because the
[2:00:14] principal is the watchman the leader of
[2:00:18] a company is the watchman of the company
[2:00:20] and yes I take the necessary action when
[2:00:23] he is on his watch whatever happens on
[2:00:27] his watch is his responsibility because
[2:00:30] he is charged to see what others cannot
[2:00:32] see if you are head of your house you
[2:00:36] are the watchman of your house you have
[2:00:39] to accept responsibility for what takes
[2:00:41] place in your house if you are a
[2:00:43] watchman of your house
[2:00:45] [Applause]
[2:00:46] now in the world of business they always
[2:00:49] say the problem is never the people it's
[2:00:54] always the leadership and within the
[2:01:01] spiritual realm it's never the sheep
[2:01:04] it's always the shepherds because the
[2:01:08] sheep are meant to be led and from a
[2:01:12] spiritual perspective
[2:01:14] whatever warning needs to go out needs
[2:01:17] to go out to you as individuals to me as
[2:01:20] individuals so we can take action based
[2:01:23] on the warning can the church say man we
[2:01:31] live in a day of satellites and read on
[2:01:34] motion sensors and metal detectors and
[2:01:37] scanners and cameras and all of these
[2:01:39] technologies exist in part to replace
[2:01:42] the role that the watchmen had years ago
[2:01:48] years ago when you built a city or a
[2:01:50] town or a village there would be a watch
[2:01:54] tower we don't have it really anymore
[2:01:56] but in that watch tower somebody would
[2:01:59] go up in the watch tower and his job
[2:02:02] would be to look for the threats to look
[2:02:06] at the time that's why the Bible said
[2:02:08] Watchmen Watchmen one of the Knights I
[2:02:10] mean the Branham said that people would
[2:02:13] come out at night if they couldn't sleep
[2:02:15] and they would act so watch but Watchmen
[2:02:17] one of the Knights and the watchman will
[2:02:22] respond to you could you imagine coming
[2:02:23] out Watchmen watch for one of the
[2:02:25] Knights and you get no response because
[2:02:28] the watchman is sleeping I remember some
[2:02:34] time ago I drove past the security booth
[2:02:36] and and looked for the security he was
[2:02:39] out cold sleeping
[2:02:47] but the technology that we have today to
[2:02:49] detect to monitor and to track it's
[2:02:54] achieved as a threat coming to see if
[2:02:57] reinforcements are coming to see if the
[2:03:00] people who went up against food are
[2:03:01] coming back so when the watchman said
[2:03:04] the food is coming that people get
[2:03:05] excited because he is higher than they
[2:03:08] are he could see what they cannot see
[2:03:10] can the church Shaymin
[2:03:13] you cannot respond to an attack unless
[2:03:17] you know any attack is coming from so
[2:03:20] the watchman's job was to scream down
[2:03:23] there coming over that hill over there
[2:03:25] send someone men on that side there over
[2:03:28] on that side sentiment over there
[2:03:30] because a watchman in the watchtower was
[2:03:32] looking out and what's happening can the
[2:03:36] church say man I mean this place is here
[2:03:39] with a banner and a message watchman or
[2:03:41] than a knight he said and the duties of
[2:03:43] a watchman and the old Bible was a man
[2:03:45] that was selected he must be a man
[2:03:47] that's alert of the heavenly bodies he
[2:03:50] must know just exactly where the stars
[2:03:52] are hanging to tell the perfect time to
[2:03:55] the people
[2:03:55] many of the weary will go out maybe and
[2:03:58] couldn't sleep restless and would scream
[2:04:01] up at the watchman in the tower and
[2:04:03] would scream out these words watchman
[2:04:05] one of the night and he would look at
[2:04:07] the Stars and then would say it's
[2:04:09] such-and-such a time then they would go
[2:04:11] back to their bed or wherever they
[2:04:13] choose to dwell
[2:04:14] waiting for the daylight to come when
[2:04:16] the tired weary restless night will be
[2:04:19] over God have mercy I wonder if it is
[2:04:22] sometime today that we didn't call it to
[2:04:24] our great watchman one of the night and
[2:04:28] brother branham type the great watchman
[2:04:29] of the Holy Ghost that is an approaching
[2:04:32] danger coming on and the whole world
[2:04:34] seems to be shaken under its influence
[2:04:36] the watchman also had to be on duty all
[2:04:40] times there's no off duty you have to be
[2:04:45] alert all time that was his duty to
[2:04:47] watch for the approaching danger and he
[2:04:51] was up in a tower it was built much
[2:04:53] higher than the walls and this tower he
[2:04:55] had up there in it the books of
[2:04:57] astronomy and so forth
[2:04:59] watch the stars and tell the time any
[2:05:01] approaching thing of time of day he
[2:05:04] could tell it he could also see we're
[2:05:07] further than anyone on the ground he
[2:05:10] could see further than anyone in the
[2:05:11] wall because he was up higher and the
[2:05:14] higher you go the further you can see
[2:05:16] you could tell approaching dangers and
[2:05:19] so forth and I say in his day was
[2:05:21] speaking that call had made him a
[2:05:23] watchman I'm quite liking his prophets
[2:05:26] like unto Eagles they are a watchman
[2:05:31] that climb higher so they can see
[2:05:33] further off and the eyes were made
[2:05:35] spiritual so they could see the
[2:05:37] approaching dangers and God had said
[2:05:40] Isaiah to warn the people that he was
[2:05:43] approaching dangers but they wouldn't
[2:05:45] listen to him and in our day God sent a
[2:05:48] watchman like no other watchman a
[2:05:50] twentieth century prophet who was pulled
[2:05:53] up to a high tower and he was given
[2:05:57] spiritual eyes and those spiritual eyes
[2:06:02] so many things those spiritual eyes so
[2:06:05] far off those spiritual eyes saw a bride
[2:06:09] coming into power those spiritual eyes
[2:06:12] what is able to see a bride coming to
[2:06:15] perfection those spiritual eyes was able
[2:06:19] to see a super church a super race those
[2:06:24] spiritual eyes were able to see a power
[2:06:27] not just in distance but far off in time
[2:06:30] those spiritual eyes in that Watchtower
[2:06:33] was able to look into the past was able
[2:06:37] to look into the present was able to
[2:06:39] look into the now he was caught up in
[2:06:41] the high tower of the eternal realm of
[2:06:44] God
[2:06:47] he was able to see the enemy coming in
[2:06:49] he was able to warn the Church of the
[2:06:52] two spirits working in the framework of
[2:06:55] the church he was able to warn the
[2:06:58] people can the church say Amen everybody
[2:07:06] with me this morning
[2:07:07] so that watchman he was always a lit
[2:07:10] from the moment but the Branham took his
[2:07:12] place as watchman in the tower every
[2:07:16] year he stood his ground and message
[2:07:19] after message in those messages were
[2:07:22] notes of warning were notes of prophecy
[2:07:25] with notes of encouragement he would say
[2:07:27] things like sir is this the time he was
[2:07:30] shouting from the watchtower get ready
[2:07:33] get ready get ready there's a rapture
[2:07:35] coming he shouted from the watchtower I
[2:07:38] see a church called
[2:07:40] I see a church walking and step come on
[2:07:47] now come on now come on now
[2:07:50] oh are you with me this morning are you
[2:07:53] with me this morning and our watchman
[2:07:57] will get back to touch we'll get back to
[2:08:00] that in a few minutes but let's go back
[2:08:02] in the Old Testament
[2:08:03] David was a watchman so when David is
[2:08:09] looking over the Sheep he was alert and
[2:08:13] the Shepherd's in those days that's why
[2:08:15] Jesus could say I am the door because
[2:08:18] when the Sheep fool was done the
[2:08:20] entrance was left open and the Shapley
[2:08:22] and from the entrance as the door so
[2:08:26] that while he's even taking a rest if
[2:08:28] the Sheep tried to cross over him it'll
[2:08:29] wake him up but demon was alert he was a
[2:08:33] watchman in his tower so that when the
[2:08:36] beer team he saw the beer and as the
[2:08:40] watchman he took action against the beer
[2:08:42] and because he was a watchman he saw
[2:08:46] when the lion came
[2:08:48] and when the beer came is in not on my
[2:08:50] watch I'm not gonna let any beer touch
[2:08:56] the Sheep while I'm the watchman or you
[2:08:59] know hear me this morning when the lion
[2:09:02] came David was the watchman and in his
[2:09:06] heart of hearts he said not under my
[2:09:08] watch maybe if somebody else was here he
[2:09:11] might act differently but right now
[2:09:13] while I have the ability to do something
[2:09:16] about the problem while I've been given
[2:09:19] the responsibility to watch over these
[2:09:22] sheep not on my watch hallelujah you may
[2:09:32] be seated
[2:09:35] hallelujah it became personal and
[2:09:38] they're gonna find in the scripture that
[2:09:39] we are all Watchmen oh you thought I
[2:09:42] just took them in the ministry and the
[2:09:44] prophets
[2:09:44] no we are all Watchmen you're not
[2:09:47] getting away that easily
[2:09:48] you have your own watching to do we all
[2:09:51] have our own watching to do we all have
[2:09:54] an opportunity while we are on our watch
[2:09:56] to take action about the situations that
[2:10:00] come into our lives that we can respond
[2:10:03] not on my watch while I'm going to work
[2:10:05] and that temptation comes my way not on
[2:10:08] my watch I'm not falling for it
[2:10:11] I'm not falling for that music while I'm
[2:10:14] on my watch I'm not listening to that
[2:10:16] style I'm not gonna dress that way
[2:10:18] because I'm on my watch I'm on duty so I
[2:10:21] cannot go to this place because I'm on
[2:10:24] my watch
[2:10:25] can you go to me to the party nothing my
[2:10:27] words I can't go because I'm on watch
[2:10:29] I'm gonna watch for my soul I'm gonna
[2:10:32] watch for my house I'm gonna watch for
[2:10:34] revival I'm gonna watch for deliverance
[2:10:36] I'm on watch for healing and because I'm
[2:10:39] on my watch
[2:10:43] somebody help me
[2:10:45] hallelujah you may be seated so your
[2:10:48] children that are in trouble you have
[2:10:50] got to tell yourself nothing my watch
[2:10:52] I'm not gonna let them stay out of
[2:10:54] church and not do something about it not
[2:10:58] on my watch oh you don't hear me this
[2:11:01] morning your children were given to your
[2:11:03] responsibility and you oughta watch for
[2:11:06] them you ought to pray for them you

[2:11:44] come into my house not on my watch I'm
[2:11:47] I'm not gonna let nobody mess up my
[2:11:49] worship not on my watch I'm not you see
[2:11:56] if you don't take ownership for your
[2:11:58] watch you'll always blame the other
[2:12:00] person let me see it again
[2:12:04] if you don't take ownership for your
[2:12:07] watch then you could always say it's
[2:12:10] somebody else's fault but when it's your
[2:12:14] watch you've got to be a litt you've got
[2:12:19] to be full time you can watch now and
[2:12:22] not watch tomorrow you got to be
[2:12:24] watching all the time
[2:12:29] let me jump ahead a little bit we in
[2:12:33] Holy Week Jesus goes at cemani and he's
[2:12:39] tired he's weary in fact he tells this
[2:12:42] to them when Jesus comes back he went
[2:12:46] back to his own disciples and he asks a
[2:12:49] question couldn't you watch with me for
[2:12:53] one hour
[2:13:07] I wanted to sink in your soul friends
[2:13:15] this is real it's easy to blame people
[2:13:19] it's easy it's his fault that goes way
[2:13:24] back to Genesis Adam what happened it
[2:13:33] was the woman you give me Eve what
[2:13:41] happened it wasn't me it was a serpent
[2:13:48] it's easy to pass the responsibility and
[2:13:57] that's why my heart I felt compelled
[2:14:01] this morning to warn the young people
[2:14:04] today to warn the church today because
[2:14:12] if the warning goes out today then I
[2:14:16] free my soul and I could say because I'm
[2:14:23] on watch this morning I want to watch
[2:14:28] right now Lord not on my watch may the
[2:14:32] reality of the truth sink into your soul
[2:14:35] that you realize that judgment is coming
[2:14:40] once man watch spin one of the night the
[2:14:45] morning come but at night also Scripture
[2:14:48] we read but the Brenham said yes the
[2:14:50] morning coming just just before the
[2:14:51] morning is the darkest hour
[2:14:56] he said the morning comes for those who
[2:14:58] are prepared for the morning that's what
[2:15:00] what about himself but the night comes
[2:15:02] for those who are not prepared for the
[2:15:03] morning the morning star this is not
[2:15:11] about coming to church is that about
[2:15:12] shouting and jumping right now it's
[2:15:14] about Lord my soul
[2:15:17] I'm on watch for my soil my watch for my
[2:15:22] marriage I'm on watch for the young
[2:15:23] people we have become so casual that we
[2:15:27] have not even seen it there's something
[2:15:29] we can do about what somebody else is
[2:15:31] going through because David had the
[2:15:35] experience of watching for his sheep and
[2:15:37] as watchman for his sheep he understood
[2:15:40] what it meant and felt like when the
[2:15:42] lion chemo and the beer came so when he
[2:15:45] went to his brothers
[2:15:47] and he was walking away and he heard
[2:15:49] Goliath he was like not on my watch
[2:15:53] who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[2:15:57] that has oppressed my brothers David was
[2:16:01] the under oppression from Goliath he has
[2:16:03] not heard about the situation until he
[2:16:06] was walking away he had not been there
[2:16:08] for days you didn't know their struggles
[2:16:10] he didn't know their pains but once he
[2:16:12] heard it he was like I got to do
[2:16:14] something about it not on my watch and
[2:16:21] many times we have people who are
[2:16:23] struggling who are tired who are weary
[2:16:25] who want to give up and we see them and
[2:16:30] we don't see anything we see them and we
[2:16:32] don't pray we see them and we don't act
[2:16:34] when all of us are watch for one another
[2:16:39] we are on watch to make sure that we can
[2:16:42] make it
[2:16:43] [Applause]
[2:16:43] [Music]
[2:16:48] in the Army in certain special units
[2:16:52] they have certain codes not one shall be
[2:16:55] left behind we don't leave a man in
[2:16:58] enemy territory they are built like that
[2:17:01] they would go black under gunfire to
[2:17:04] pull out one man because of the cordon
[2:17:06] their lives and go to war and watch one
[2:17:10] another where you I'd rather where you
[2:17:12] are Charlie where you are alpha they're
[2:17:15] gonna make sure they know everybody's
[2:17:17] that because we are in this thing
[2:17:18] together the watchman was nothing the
[2:17:21] tower for himself he was in the tower
[2:17:24] for everybody and as watchman in the
[2:17:29] house of God we are on watch for
[2:17:31] everybody you don't have to like
[2:17:34] everybody but we've got to watch for
[2:17:37] everybody
[2:17:39] [Applause]
[2:17:49] encourage one another until love and
[2:17:52] goodwill sees a seeming like seeing a
[2:17:54] watch for one another because what
[2:17:59] you're going through somebody else is
[2:18:01] going through it you're peeing on your
[2:18:03] struggling somebody else going through
[2:18:05] it this is our house this is our church
[2:18:10] this is our we have to watch because
[2:18:15] judgment is around us marriages and
[2:18:20] trouble homes in trouble young people in
[2:18:22] trouble what are you gonna do about it
[2:18:26] when were you seeing not on my watch let
[2:18:30] me pray more than I'm free before
[2:18:32] couldn't you watch with me for one hour
[2:18:36] couldn't you take times of watch for one
[2:18:40] hour you couldn't take you can make time
[2:18:44] to pray or for one hour who oh god help
[2:18:47] us this morning I'm not gonna be too
[2:18:49] much longer with you but I want this to
[2:18:51] sink in a bit this morning husbands are
[2:18:56] Watchmen fathers how much mothers are
[2:19:01] watch woman if you want to say that but
[2:19:03] we are all on watch Habakkuk 2 and verse
[2:19:09] 1 I will stand upon my watch and set me
[2:19:13] upon the tower and I will watch to see
[2:19:15] what he will see unto me what I shall
[2:19:17] answer when I am reproved Matthew 24 and
[2:19:23] 42 watch therefore for ye know not what
[2:19:27] hour your Lord had come what are you
[2:19:30] looking at this morning
[2:19:31] what are you watching for are you
[2:19:36] looking for the spiritual things are you
[2:19:38] looking for the natural the Bible says
[2:19:43] what does it profit a man to gain the
[2:19:44] whole world and lose his soul
[2:19:48] it sounds simple but how many us in the
[2:19:50] message are losing our souls because we
[2:19:54] are not watching I want to read the
[2:20:00] scripture because I really want this to
[2:20:01] sink in this week Matthew 26 then cometh
[2:20:05] Jesus unto them unto a place called
[2:20:07] Gethsemane and see it under disciples
[2:20:09] sit ye here while I go and pray on them
[2:20:13] and he took with him Peter and the two
[2:20:16] sons of Zebedee and began to be very
[2:20:18] sorrowful and very heavy Jesus was very
[2:20:26] sorrowful and very heavy I wonder how
[2:20:32] many people in here this morning are
[2:20:33] sorrowful very heavy heavy with life
[2:20:39] heavy heavy with regrets on pains and
[2:20:45] heavy with worry and confusion and heavy
[2:20:48] with pork eyes are different kinds of
[2:20:51] heaviness listen to Jesus then said he
[2:20:58] to them my soul is exceeding sorrowful
[2:21:00] even unto death tarry ye here and watch
[2:21:05] with me is there anybody here this
[2:21:09] morning is willing to watch with me
[2:21:12] while I go through my sorrow while I go
[2:21:17] through my pain there are people in pain
[2:21:19] here this morning is anybody willing to
[2:21:24] watch with me while I'm in my agony
[2:21:28] while I'm going through my stuff here we
[2:21:34] find Jesus going through his hardest
[2:21:38] moment he began to be sorrowful and very
[2:21:44] heavy and he said it to them he didn't
[2:21:47] keep it to himself he said to them my
[2:21:50] soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto
[2:21:54] death please tarry here and watch with
[2:21:58] me
[2:22:00] and he went a little further down fell
[2:22:02] in his face and prayed saying O my
[2:22:03] father if it be possible let this cup
[2:22:07] pass nevertheless not as I will but as
[2:22:11] thou wilt
[2:22:17] but the Branham said that's where Jesus
[2:22:19] overcame in the Garden of Gethsemane on
[2:22:23] our journey to overcoming there's penis
[2:22:27] there's sorrow does God allows it to be
[2:22:31] that way but I ask a question is
[2:22:33] wondering if Jesus reach out to somebody
[2:22:39] to watch with me I'm not embarrassed I'm
[2:22:49] not ashamed to say I need help I'm not
[2:22:52] afraid to call some money say what do
[2:22:54] you pray for me I don't know how I'm
[2:22:56] gonna make it this week I don't know how
[2:23:00] I'm going to survive what's coming in
[2:23:08] your darkest moment that's when you need
[2:23:10] your brother that's when you need your
[2:23:12] sister if you can talk to somebody in
[2:23:18] the house of God who you're going to
[2:23:21] talk to I want you to make up
[2:23:26] understanding because they're people who
[2:23:28] come to church and they say well I don't
[2:23:30] want to talk to nobody I don't wanna I
[2:23:31] just come in and I want to get the wood
[2:23:33] and go home Jesus was going to pray to
[2:23:35] God his father and he still asked his
[2:23:38] brothers to watch with me some of us are
[2:23:45] way too selfish and when your time comes
[2:23:49] in your sorrow
[2:23:51] you don't even got friends to say could
[2:23:53] you watch with me and the people you
[2:23:58] call your friends in the world they
[2:24:00] don't even know what it means to watch
[2:24:04] with me pray with me
[2:24:09] I hope this hits home because this kills
[2:24:20] the self-righteousness of people who
[2:24:22] don't need anybody if Jesus himself
[2:24:25] could reach out this I want you to
[2:24:27] understand it so who would make more
[2:24:39] mistakes Jesus reached out to Peter and
[2:24:43] said Peter what do you watch with me I'm
[2:24:47] in sorrow I'm in pain god help us to
[2:24:52] enter into each other's sufferings and
[2:24:57] to go beyond just seeing God bless you
[2:25:00] and people say I'm praying for you if
[2:25:04] you need support I've got you I've got
[2:25:08] your back I'll watch with you
[2:25:10] I'll pray through with you god help us
[2:25:29] and he commits under his disciples and
[2:25:30] findeth them asleep say it on the pizza
[2:25:33] what what could you not watch with me
[2:25:38] one hour and Jesus says watch and pray
[2:25:44] that he enter not into temptation the
[2:25:48] spirit indeed is willing but the flesh
[2:25:52] is weak God is not trying to get to the
[2:25:58] act like a superhero God wants you to be
[2:26:05] real he wants it to be authentic that's
[2:26:10] what I love about pizza when Peter
[2:26:12] walked in the water and he came to the
[2:26:14] realization listen I'm thinking pizza
[2:26:21] was real but overall his preaches that
[2:26:24] Pizza was a fisherman him you are a fish
[2:26:26] Peter kind of swarm back and but he said
[2:26:30] Lord I'm sinking help me maybe there's
[2:26:35] somebody this morning wants the church
[2:26:37] to watch with them I know I do
[2:26:45] he said only perfect love will enter
[2:26:48] there he didn't say the courts will take
[2:26:53] you there is it perfect love it's not
[2:26:58] knowledge do I have all knowledge so I
[2:27:00] know all mysteries oh I see the poor do
[2:27:02] I give my body to be burned if I don't
[2:27:05] have charity perfect love I'm nothing
[2:27:09] the purpose of this gospel is to bring
[2:27:12] us to death but that we are totally
[2:27:15] dependent on him and because we are
[2:27:17] totally dependent upon him our
[2:27:19] relationship with our brothers and
[2:27:21] sisters become different because we are
[2:27:24] all part of that same body because by
[2:27:26] one's spirit we are baptized into that
[2:27:29] party
[2:27:31] your pain becomes my pain your victory
[2:27:34] becomes my victory your success becomes
[2:27:37] my success we need one another because
[2:27:41] we are one party we are one family
[2:27:46] that's why not church can hold the Holy
[2:27:49] Ghost only the body can hold the Holy
[2:27:51] Ghost you can't cut off anybody because
[2:27:55] God to deal with everybody he could deal
[2:27:58] with anybody we need more love we need
[2:28:02] more forgiveness we need more patience
[2:28:07] but today I declare my independence not
[2:28:12] on my watch I'm not gonna sit back and
[2:28:15] see the young people being punched
[2:28:17] around by the devil anymore not on my
[2:28:20] watch give me some men who would stand
[2:28:25] with me that would see nothing on my
[2:28:26] watch
[2:28:27] that's for me and my house we will serve
[2:28:29] the Lord
[2:28:31] give me some praying mothers who would
[2:28:34] say not on my watch I'm gonna pray until
[2:28:37] my son is delivered until my door turns
[2:28:41] in the liver
[2:28:41] until that marriage is resolved until we
[2:28:44] see revival until we see seven living
[2:28:48] voices
[2:28:49] [Applause]
[2:29:05] it pained the profit young people and I
[2:29:09] see young people in here and some of you
[2:29:12] I don't even have to discern that you're
[2:29:15] struggling your social media profiles
[2:29:18] Selma you're struggling the Bible speaks
[2:29:26] about God knows the their very thoughts
[2:29:29] your own thoughts and that'll be used as
[2:29:32] your judgments so may you know your
[2:29:36] thoughts you make it visible where you
[2:29:39] stand what you believe the Bible says
[2:29:44] rebuke openly that people will fear in
[2:29:52] other words whatever you have to do
[2:29:54] because your soul is more important than
[2:29:56] your flesh more important than your
[2:29:59] spirit we are try on being but one of
[2:30:03] these days this flesh but not much
[2:30:08] anymore we won the salvation of our
[2:30:12] souls the deliverance of our soul the
[2:30:14] redemption of our soul because here's
[2:30:16] another body that's waiting for us but
[2:30:21] the time has come to strip ourselves
[2:30:24] away and have our own Calvary experience
[2:30:32] and if we need somebody to pray with us
[2:30:34] we'll be it so be it
[2:30:36] I said a few more and I'm gonna be done
[2:30:39] in sister book I've seen mark 13 and
[2:30:42] verse 30 the Bible says verily I say
[2:30:45] unto you that this generation shall not
[2:30:48] pass till all these things be done
[2:30:50] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[2:30:53] words shall not pass away but of that
[2:30:57] day and that hour knoweth no man no not
[2:31:02] the angels which are in heaven neither
[2:31:04] the son but the
[2:31:05] take heed watch and pray for you know
[2:31:10] not when the time is for the son of man
[2:31:21] is as a man taking a far journey listen
