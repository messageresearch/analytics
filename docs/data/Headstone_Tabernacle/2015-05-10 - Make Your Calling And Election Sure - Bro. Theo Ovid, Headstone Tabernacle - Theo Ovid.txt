morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah first thing when you come to the church is to worship God hallelujah before even pray that you bless his name you give him glory because he is good hallelujah hallelujah he is good M the trials he is still good Hallelujah am miss the test he is great he is wonderful he is God hallelujah he loves to see his people worship him when you worship Him you make him your God because God is the object of worship so the first thing you come here to do is to worship not to watch the preacher to worship hallu not to see each other cloth to worship not to meet this one and that one to worship praise God that's what you come to do Jesus told that woman well a powerful thing he said woman the hour come and now is where the true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and in truth to worship the father you have to know you're a son to worship the father you have to know that he is your father it means you have to have a revelation of who you are to correctly worship you're not worshiping because you're hoping to make it you know you're going to make who son are you now Hall Oh Glory to God your mother this way your father this way but who son are you now when that spoken word come inside of you who son are you now you are born again by the word who son are you now when Jesus said you must be born again you had natural parents but we not talking about that we talking about born again we talking about a new birth all together we talking about a new identification all together we talking about a new power all together we talking about a new name a new you all together you must be born again your parents could do so much and no more but this parent this heavenly father oh he want you to know that you are son this morning you are daughter this morning the devil will never tell you you are a son of God or don't expect the devil to tell you that come on now the devil will never tell you that the gates of hell will come against you but we have a word from the Lord the gates of H shall never Prevail against The Rock of Revelation that God going to reveal to his people oh glory to God Amen do you believe that the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail so this morning I have a title make a call in an election show that's the title this morning make you calling an election show yes come to church yes we are believers but there's a word that we bringing to you this morning amen a word that you have to make to make is to do make your calling an election sure that's a simple thing to make is to do you got to make your calling an election sure you you got to do it you you can't send your husband to do it for you you can't instruct your wife can you make my call in election show no this is something you got to do for yourself I'm sorry your children can help you on this one I'm sorry your wife can help you on this one I'm sorry the pastor can help you on this one you must make your calling an election short we have an inspiration from s John 15:16 ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you see as well I had to shout the service out this morning right now I got scripture that that's that's enough to shout out the rest of the service that's enough to keep shouting shouting shouting shouting Oh Glory I'm not hearing enough shouts this morning I I'll read that inspiration again ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you oh glory to God and something brother Anthony struck Martin where Jesus told disciples he needs Pastor Samaria he got the pastor Samar because you have to find a woman not the woman wasn't looking for him she was just ordinary living she had an ordinary life nothing new nothing new Under the Sun same old dry business same old going to work going back home going at the well drawing water but Jesus said I need pass by that well I want to find somebody it's wonderful when God had to find you he wasn't even seeking him but he found that woman he come knocking on the door he said woman give me some water to drink he said we not supposed to be talking to each other he said if you know who talking to you you're going to ask me for the for water to drink what a conversation and you know what happened Jesus come and unveil to that woman her name was in that book that woman got in the spirit and eventually said I that speak unto you I'm he oh it's something when God find you it's something when God hunt you it's something when God go after you you have not chosen me but I have chosen you that mean you are elected Oh Glory to God hallelujah that's enough to give a scream in the house [Applause] Glory Glory Glory in other words you have been handpicked glory to God you didn't just drift with the crowd it just it didn't just move in because everybody move in no you a handpick Jesus said no man can come to me except I am not hearing the the worshippers in the house this morning no man no man you can't can even come if you want to wo Glory something got to pull you got to be a third P it's got to be a power Hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord you may be seated oh Hallelujah so we are in the word and we're in the spirit and Paul in Romans 9 speak speak about Israel who to pertain the adoption and the glory and the Covenant whose are the fathers of whom considering the flesh Christ came though not as though the word of God had taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are Israel everybody is not bride it have make believer unbeliever True Believer it have longstanding church member but it have something called bright material is not any cloth God cutting his bright dress out of it's bright material it have other material and bright material oh could we give the Lord some Praises this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God the bride going to be wearing a special material special kind of dress wear when you walk everybody know that's bride when you talk everybody know that's bride when you live everybody know as Pride they wouldn't miake you for a Believer they wouldn't miake you for unbeliever because you're going to be walking like him you're going to be talking like him because she going to be just like him flesh of his flesh bone of his bone Spirit of his Spirit could somebody say Amen oh Hallelujah neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is which are of the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of Promise accounted for seedall oh you heard that the children of promise and Peter said by these promises we become partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in this world through lust so there going to be a bunch of people that they can't wait to hear promises they say give it to me preacher speak it to me preacher don't speak your dreams don't speak your thoughts and ideas but lay those promises on me because by these promises is there a shout in the house you could be dead but Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life by these promises is there a shout in the house you can be sick but by his stripes I am healed by these promises you could be bed this morning but he came to set the captive free he came to open up the prison pass the anointing come to break the Yoke by these [Applause] promises Glory Glory you may be seated so you can understand now why Jesus could go to Peter and say come amen follow me that's right amen and I'll make you fishes of men and Peter couldn't you help him so he just drop his Nets and keep you can understand why now because you have not chosen me I have chosen you and all that the father had given me past T have given me will come will come at the appointed time you got to come the Devil Couldn't keep you back in that bar that adultery couldn't stop it couldn't continue you couldn't continue fornicating you couldn't continue drinking all that the father had given me will come Hallelujah Glory so you are not a mistake you are not an accident you are not even here by accident this morning so we know that all things work together for good to them that love the Lord to them who are de called according to his purpose so you got to make your calling and your election sure when you do that no devil could move you that's why David said don't 10,000 fall my right hand I shall not be moved because David knew if I make my bed in hell he is there he knew who he was he knew who his father was no devil could tell him oh that's why David said restore unto me the joy of my salvation he knew he was saved but he lost the joy oh give the Lord a shout of praise might be going to preach you out to hell this [Applause] [Music] morning hallelujah hallelujah glory to God oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God I hear shout I'm hearing a scream I'm hearing a Hallelujah I'm in a glory I'm in a worship on King lamb oh [Applause] Hallelujah the children of Promise accounted for the seed for this amen is the Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son I want you to think about it amen it say promise manifested it said children of promise you actually are holding a promise and God let the people laugh at it they let them mock it because you are claiming a promise that I'm going to have a son I have his name already his name is Isaac they say you're old that has nothing to do with it who told you said God and if God tell me he's big enough to bring it to pass because God is not a man that would lie oh somebody give a shout in the house if God said to you that there's going to come Deliverance I don't care if the devil is standing out your house I don't care if you your roof Deliverance is coming shout because the god going to take you out from that house of [Applause] bondage notice what God told Joshua tell the people when I be you to shout then you shout they wasn't waiting watching the walls to fall down and then you're going to shout they were shouting before the walls fell down Paul was in prison at that midnight Paul begin to worship he was still in prison but he be to worship prison didn't B him prison didn't stop his lips prison didn't change his attitude prison arrested him but that didn't stop in his Spirit he was always a son he knew he had a call in election he saw he was an elect of God and he begin to worship he let the devil know this prison can't hinder me you can't buy a man that already bound to the love of God you cannot arrest a man that have been arrested by God himself you have to destroy that ticket you can't serve that ticket oh give the Lord some Praises people and when Saul begin to praise God the bars open up the prison bars begin to open up the chain begin to break loose because he was breaking loose before the Chain break loose Paul had to break loose out of the human [Applause] realm of what your eyes see see another man going to that same prison and he complaining wonderful wonderful the bed hard amen do like the food pray for me oh God this pressure and it testimony so heavy if you need s him in prison Hallelujah and God not see sorry for him because mature God want to write me and only place to write them is the to in prison all that greenness will go out all that IM will burn out Loose him in prison God want to arrest some of you this morning I come with some keys here God want to hold you down this morning praise God you're going to kind out the kind of love God have God no jokey love he no grandpy love he no daddy daddy love he

when we get to it give the Lord some praise His People you're going to make your call and election short why we want to naeil it down so much the devil can't have a place to move in your life in your mind in your spirit if you fall down you'll get back up if you're sick you're going to say I'm Healed if you're B you're going to become on free nothing going to hold you back your testimony will be positive I can do all things through Christ we are well aable we are more than able I'm not tired I'm not frustrated I'm not depressed I am not stressed out I will stress the devil out come on again oh glory to God help me Jesus Oh Hallelujah you be seated I throw that statement out my vocabulary I'm stressed out I'm not saying that I am not stressed out I was placed here to handle stress I'm not hearing you somebody help me preach that's what I'm placed here for that's why I'm a minister of the gospel because I can handle the pressure I can handle all types I can handle all [Applause] types Hallelujah hallu glor [Applause] so a mountain is in front of you there are two things three things you climb over it you board through it you go around it or you move it but the mountain can't stay there that's how Joshua handled Jericho walls a big wall wall City you know is that a fence City it's a wall City it take time to build up it had protection cement whatever Mt whatever it is it build it up to be strong against armies and men but this the armies of the Living God def Army that could defend against man Amy but when God Amy on the match you have to read about in Ezekiel you have to go in Daniel to find out how that Amy do move got to go in Joel to see what's before them and what's is behind them when that Army start to move you see the prophet God said this Bri going to be invin Invincible Army you understand what I [Applause] [Music] mean Invincible means Invincible means cannot cannot be [Applause] defeated some people going to fight say Amen on that I ain't talking about you you you defeated that's you but this Army that you want to join this morning we want to give you some boots some weapons of warfare helmet of salvation sword of the spirit sheld of Faith praise God Amen this Army that we in this morning cannot what did Peter said if you do these things you shall never fall make make you're [Applause] [Music] calling how many are free inside of here you may be seated some people raise their hands and they say nothing amen I ain't say how many want to raise their hands I say how many are free inside of here and if you're free you say Amen if you're not free you will be free so you say Amen too because you're on your way you are going to be free because once the son of man set anybody free you don't make him a liar if the son of man set you free you are free indeed come on now glory to God God bless all those connected to us trust that God blessing you you and the connection that God will set you free Oh Glory to God there the intellectual age people using their mind lost the Fai why you think God in a prophet to turn on back to books and ties no to turn our heart back to the faith of the fathers God know the in ag people can read and WR read and WR and arithmetic only they know that and people lost the only believe because in the beginning was only believe God tell Adam whatever you name it you name the Animals Adam had to name animals and whatever the name was the name their all say mountain move Mountain have to obey Adam is it God you sure this could happen it wasn't questioning was just believing mountain move lion come and like if it's a little dog you try you try that now and see you cannot try that don't think about it but Adam could handle that because he was authorized because God said man have power have dominion over so man was Fearless you say little child what a child afraid of nothing you ever noticed that child would run out in the road they're Fearless they don't know what fear is they feel the world as a whole disc every place the Plenty things to see plenty things to go plenty things to do oh my if God have finished what you tell the devil you have places to go you have people to meet you have things to see so that death and that hook you coming with take it back take it back Jesus one time said my hour is not yet come because I have places to go I have people to heal I have places to preach man man and when this time come he said my hour has come but our hour come yet so give the Lord some Praises because we are about to get you [Applause] started where was I all right huh for not only this but when Rebecca also conceived by one even our father here we go for the children being not yet born neither have done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger for it is written Jacob have I love and Esau have I hated amen oh Hallelujah ujah what shall we said then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he said to Moses I will have mercy and whom I will have mercy I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not him that willth or him that run but God that showeth Mercy For What the scripture sayith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose I have raised thee up that I might show my power in thee that my name might declare all the Earth so Pharaoh didn't raise himself up God raised up pharaoh to be pharaoh to bring him down to show his power and His glory so we serve a mighty God he raised up Kings he put down Kings he raise up kingdoms he thr on Kingdom but I see a stone cut out without the hands of man coming to strike the image Oh Glory to God a kingdom is about to be established a rocking is about to take place everything that can be shaken will be shaken could we give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah had not the power the pot of power over the clay or the of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor Oh Praise name even to us whom he had called not the Jews also the Gentiles he also said in O I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them you're not my people there shall they be called the children of God Isaiah CRI concerning Israel doubt though the number of the children of Israel be at the S of the sea a Remnant shall be saved and we know that Remnant is 144,000 isn't that right and he will listen and he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth oh blessed be the name of of the Lord amen so God have elected people on the Earth do you believe that and that elected people going to come into knowledge of who she is hallelujah what they call to do what they call on to and nobody that why Jesus said nobody could take your joy my joy I give nobody going to take that Joy from you isn't that right oh blessed be the name of the Lord okay [Music] wowl Hallelujah Hall are you ready that was the curtain wonderful you know about to get inside Martin Luther had mechanics and Dynamics in his day John Wesley had them in his day Pentecost what about our day this is another time the church should be fully grown now ready to meet Christ with the manifestation of Every Blessing he promised in the Bible operating in that great body amen where he promised he would meet the people and be woried amen so then when the Dynamics fell on the elected Lutheran Church It produced a manifestation of justification could they hear am on that when the Dynamics fell on wesan it produced a manifestation of sanctification when the Dynamics fell on Pentecostals because each age had mechanics and dnam and Dynamics but when the Dynamics fell the Pentecostal it produce the gifts with signs and wonders here we go but not the life which goes onto adoption and Perfection because the life come by the word am and the word comes to a prophet yes and the Pentecostal rejected the prophet so they are stuck with the money gospel with signs and one of the Miracles but they couldn't go on with the life so that is why God sent a prophet to bring the word because in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God in him was life and the life was the light of men so if you want life you have to get the word but because we come to the church ages all people know is church so it's a battle to get people out of church thinking into word thinking that's the battle Hallelujah that you are not a church member you are moving into bright material you have a choice to stay here move through easy and hit the tribulation amen hallelujah because church members just have to sa through know they just have to make an appearance but the bride she fights the Bible call her the elected Jesus gave a parable about the unjust judge and a woman harassing that judge he said shall not go avenge his elect who cry day and night yet she's elected she know she's elected she make a call election show and because she is elected she don't sit down and said I'm elected no she cries she sigh she grows she press because that's the word Hallelujah H you does only go for water when you're thirsty Jesus said the water I will give you you will never TST again this water this natural water this temporary water you have to come back for it but the one I have you to come back for that you're going to be sealed until your day of redemption out of your belly shall float rivers of Living Water there's a power friends there's a power coming Hallelujah there is power that is here right now glory to [Applause] God the Dynamics is here right now this morning the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost is here in the form of the spirit of Prophecy because the Bible said thou must prophesy again there's a prophecy that we will prophesy again which will be the same prophecy that the prophet brought will be recycled going to be re-echoed to give the world one more time to criticize and laugh that God could judge [Applause] them oh Hallelujah so you really think God will let the world go Spear and get away you really think God going raise up sod Andor and apologize to them you think God will take on what the governments want to do with all these gay rights and stuff and apologize no no no no no that same God every country Every Nation every Kingdom where Greek and Romans wherever it is they fell because of internal stuff and when we rotten and bad and perverted and God judged them for that the Bible said the the cup of the iniquity of the amorites is not filled up yet once it's filled God ready to pour the Wrath and judgment America's already finished it's waiting for the Judgment of God to be loosed a but before that happen a ceiling must go forth a bride must know who she is a pride must be sealed into the kingdom of God and a seal shows on both sides you are seal on the inside seal on the outside devil can't do you no h come on say Amen somebody glory to God hallu you understand what I'm saying I am preaching mother the people that going to be bulletproof right Death Proof bomb proof hell proof you not hearing me Glory they the first time the Grim re Reaper meet his match to the extent of a bunch of people on the Earth because Jesus died you know but this bride will not see death man praise God people not getting excited oh glory to God now getting excited we are not from here you know sit down a minute hallelu oh yeah we not from here you know Hall you thought we from here hallelujah we are not just the dust man is from here but where we come from we going back to where we come from we come from where we going oh we going where we come from Jus I come from God and going back to God oh God we come from fire we going back to fire devil don't know who we are the devil don't know who we are because he only came in the beginning but we were before the beginning are you hearing me are you hearing me this morning the devil only came in the beginning so all he could know it's in the beginning but we were before the beginning glory to God glory to God Amen so election looks back to for knowledge and predestination look back to look down to Destiny so when you're talking about election you have to go back in the full knowledge of God that's why you have to be in his thinking you have to be in his thoughts because when you express his word you were part of that expression that's why when the word is preached to you something [Applause] connect you know like have a wireless computer wireless instrument and whatnot and when you go and there's a wireless signal you could connect sometime you're not connecting right well God put a building thing inside of you a signal a gene a germ so when the word is preached something had to do so w whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so you might be among chickens but when you whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa is the mother eagle flying over you say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that song like me that song Like Me Mommy come on say somebody that sound like somebody just like me I only in the B but I feel to fly but them chickens are flying I feeling to fly come on say Amen somebody I'm feeling to break out I feeling the shout where was down when I lay the foundation of the earth and the mon sang together and the sons of God shout it for Joy man I feel the shout but I ain't delivered yet still shout come on now Hallelujah on Thursday night we said something about David I could bring that back to youall Saul messing up God tell Samuel forget about sa now I enough for he mourn him he have no anointing upon he just there in position he just did killing time forget that I'm a king I a king go to Jess house oh blessed be the name of the Lord devil want to fight but we'll fight right back praise God praise God they want to fight but we will fight right back why because the devil don't want you to hear this part when Samuel went with the Horner oil to look for one of the sons that God said to anoint he never tell him who it was when the first one come Samuel said surely this is he thought he had easy job that day first man d man God said no I don't operate like that I don't look what man does look at I don't see jacket and tie on the external I look on the inside inside so I want you to understand from here on out stop looking at outside stop looking at complexion High color hair skin tone forget all all that praise God look look look beyond that so Samuel now will yield himself to the spirit and tell his sons pass by and only pass him by you a feeling not no witness you have to have a witness of the spirit this is a spirit business Spirit business man passing this one passing nothing happening and all of a sudden the line stop this all because who passed by I ain't get no sign they said we have one more he ain't got chance to B yet he still smelly like the Sheep little fell named David now watch this here's the part David wasn't ready yet to be king but God was still going to anoint him you don't have to be ready but you have to make your calling an election make it sure so when David come God said this is he oh give the Lord some Praises [Music] people praise the Lord amen blessed be the name of the Lord are you with me so God didn't wait for David to say when D become a old man and he and he get some beard get big chest and tall and different things go understand that go said that is my king there pour the oil on him David take the oil and went back to see about the Sheep David come and say where's my throne you know he doomed if he come with that you know he's finished right there and then because you see character power without character is trouble big time I saying it in the way I could understand it are you with me now so God had to know what he going to take David through to qualify him for throne he had to go and learn some music because it could take music to give a door opening to get into the palace to see where you will walk where you will sit where you will talk it take a musician to do that because when David got anointed the evil spirit came same time same hour same day upon Saul as as as the spirit anoint David the devil anointed Saul at the same time he get troubled and David anointed he is in Horrors and David just feeling appointed oh come on on say Amen somebody the very same hour the anointing upon David is the very same hour demons falling upon Soul then some wise men around say you know what it takes some music to change the atmosphere we know somebody amen who is very skillful his name is David stand for David Hallelujah David come as king he come to play violent he come to play the heart he come just to Sue that Spirit upon soul but David had to walk where Saul Walk David have to walk through the palace lat did David know he's going to be sitting right there it's only a matter of time and that devil walking where you supposed to walk is only a matter of time every place you put your foot going to be yours don't let

we're going to preach it we going to expect it we going to fight until we produce it God want results not all talk oh give the Lord some Praises people hallelujah hallelujah amen Oh Glory Hallelujah for without money without price W what I heard out there beloved pastor but Neville make a remark I just can't forget it I quoted a friend and after taken watch after the taken away of the Holy Spirit out of the earth that formal Church religion will go right on not knowing the difference do you have you heard that wasn't that astounding they don't know the Holy Spirit amen so they won't know when it is gone true they will just be going right on just the same when here we go the last one is sealed into the body of Christ they will still be going on trying to bring converts to it because they don't know what it is their former religions will continue on just like they were now it may not sink into you like it did to me but that was an astounding statement that will be so far away just religious rituals until they will not miss the holy spirit because they don't know what it is to begin with amen oh Hallelujah that spirit that brings conviction that spirit that convict you when you're wrong and make you feel bad that's you don't want to lose that you really don't want to lose that you don't want where the spirit speaking you don't even know the spirit speaking you want to be under the conviction of the Holy Ghost you want to know that God could tell you make this tell somebody forgive me I'm wrong I'm sorry you want to know that is still working with you praise God David did things David was wrong but David went and repent before God and ask God to restore the joy of Salvation ask God for breakthrough and whatnot when David said oh God I in trouble and know they run my enemies around me would seek the Lord and God will bless him you could do the same also could we give Lord some Praises people amen God have mercy on us brother I'd like to live this life is my desire till I if even the late least bit of his grieving I'll know it in my heart this is butam if I should do something that would grieve him I'll be able to feel it in a moment let alone his absence I don't want to be here when he's not here I want to be gone then there'll be no blood on the mercy seat it'll be dark Smoky and black the sanctuary will have no lawyer there to plead your case you know the scripture said the sanctuary is Smoky there's no blood on The Mercy Seat oh praise God there are so many entertaining things how day so much things to entice the people called pleasures the enticement for young people the modern dance rock and roll and I don't care how good a home a child has been brought up in how it has been taught to do right if that child listen hasn't accepted the experience of the new birth rock and roll music catches his attention just as quick as he hears it because in him is born in him by Nature a carnal Spirit and the power of the devil is so great today till it catches that Spirit of that little one amen how much more will it do to the old that rejected the New Birth because only here we go are you listening only as your life is changed and you have been converted and born a new into the kingdom of God your nature will still be of the things of the world so somebody could wear dress as long till they could sweep the street with the dress Don't Wear No Makeup Don't Wear No earring and whatnot and whatever it is and clean face and whatnot unless they are born again unless their life is changed the world will always be an attraction because of your carnal nature and spirit isn't that right now watch this here now watch no matter how religious you are unless that has been changed in you you could worship and be religious and still that will be some kind of joint power to you because the old man of sin and his desires is not dead yet oh Hallelujah so you may have he said watch Paul said when he he said in a bunch of so-called Holy Rollers one night I found what I wanted that money could not buy in a bunch of illiterate uneducated poorly dressed people Negroes to begin with out yonder in a little old converted Saloon on the floor I found a price a jewel when that old Dy look in my face and said have you receed the Holy Ghost since you believed am it was something that I wanted and I didn't expect to find it among those people but they had what I needed am the UN today United Nations today they wouldn't accept what we got but that's what they need Cru all the rest of them need Christ in the baptism of the Holy Ghost it will change the disposition it will make men who they hate become brothers so the Holy Ghost don't push away Brethren the Holy Ghost will make people who hate become brothers it will take the greed away the malice the strife and put love joy peace goodness and mercy yes in an unexpected Place sometimes is where you find what you're looking for amen today people are so deceived am they think they can go and say their prayers here we go pay some priest to say a few prayers for them pay their way through they want to go on living in lust and have somebody else pray for them pray for me Hallelujah pray for me your whole testimonies pray for me pray for me pray for me you lazy Rascal why you to pray for yourself you think I expect an amen for that for that of course not nobody want to say Amen to that you expect God to come with a broom to clean up your life what about you and your broom your broom dirty clean your broom first and then start to sweep let your neighbors see you sweeping let the dust come flying out your house you begin to clean up hallelujah hallelujah understand this on the journey to the promised land God let Mana fall Mana Fallen every day they pick it up eating Mana

that in the gospel that's the word now Paul amen taking to get out of that what we know is as he h come your head back as he SW come your sword back but Jesus say my kingdom is not of this world hallah you see Jesus did didn't have Horrors because he knew who he was he could tell them I always not come he could tell them tell that Rascal today I cast out Devils tomorrow he can let them have it he can keep silent and don't even answer them he could tell p get behind me Satan without even blinking his eyes and study how Peter feeling would be affected by that harsh statement of saying the devil is upon him and how the rest of the who heard it would see him Jesus was not catering for the humanistic realm he was so good at what he did that they didn't even know Judas was the man that was to betray him they thought Judas went to get some more bread or something and Jesus what do quickly Jesus was a class all by himself would you like to beat him [Applause] Hallelujah I mean he's good man then guys come up to him I said should we pay taxes to Caesar he said he said whose coin is it whose inscription is in that coin they say Caesar he said well give Caesar where Cesar but give God what is God try to TI me up with taxes and all kind don't come that Jesus know to handle every situation man oh glory to God that's the God we serve if you can handle that he can handle it and he can teach you how to handle it stop complaining and start praising Oh Glory okay now watch sardan age under the fifth seal they were crying out with a loud voice how long oh Lord holy and true thst thou judge an Avenger of blood that dwell on the earth and white robes are given unto them it was said unto them they should not rest yet for season until the fellow servants also the Brethren should be killed as they should be killed note particularly that none of these under the altar were killed for the testimony to Jesus they were not like Antipas who were slain for holding fast his name they were not born again ones with eternal life as their possession they come up in the resurrection receive life because of their stand on the word notice how these are crying out of Vengeance they cannot be bride material amen so it's two places butam used that term bright material isolated with faith and this part here he said the bride turns the cheek and cries for forgive them Father for they know not what they do these are Jews so the bride don't call for vengeance oh Hallelujah that's bride material want to hit back and get back and you want to do back that's not bride material so we have to come into bride material now that God could cut from that material a wife of Christ could we give the Lord some Praises now the Lord Almighty says I know he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution question does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block that is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them amen how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watch his people suffer question Malachi 1 1-3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you sayeth the Lord yet you say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayeth the Lord yet I love Jacob I hated Esau and laid his mountains and Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness you see here we go are you ready you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering 10% say amen that's that's all right that 10% must be deected you know I know Believers the Believers believe the word oh hallelujah look like I get 15% let's go now let's let let the percentage keep increasing oh Hallelujah they thought that love meant no suffering amen that's like 40 they thought that love meant no suffering that's sing better they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said his love was elective love and the proof of his love is [Applause] election are you elected God love you my God this this ought to make a man who tires fat in his car begin to walk to walk home just to think you didn't study anymore you just had to walk prise God because I'm elected I'm elected I'm elected you have not chosen me you have not chosen me but I have chosen you I have elected you oh h Hallelujah Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory to God the proof God thank you Jesus the proof of God's love it's not everything nice and have a nice fence and the house and the front of the garage and you have thish here and the kitchen real nice and everything clean and nice and the children nice and the wife Nice and the husband nice and the money nice everything just nice and you just lie down nice that is not the proof bright Skies is not God's approval Dark Skies doesn't mean God disapproved his approval is in the Beloved his approval is in Christ his approval is in the election Rejoice because your name is in the [Applause] book do you understand now you be SE the depth of why when the disciples came to Jesus excited about the devil's subject unto them because of anointing plac on them not because they had character because they was given temporary power that got them so excited about demons running from them Jesus told them don't Rejoice because the devils are subject to you rejoice because your name is in [Applause] heaven because the devil receive all with temporary power no power Bond free slave non-slave except those who names written in Lamb book of life therefore something have to reveal and unfold to identify and make sure your name in The Lamb Book of Life and when you see your name your husband can knock it out listen try to boil John on the AIS of Patmos it couldn't boil out his name John survived boiling the Hebrew boys survive fire Daniel surviv Lions then they can't touch it the devil Can't Touch This election of [Applause] God how much do you try pass through stuff and he thought he would kill you I go dead I go dead yeah you s life T you couldn't handle it and you pass it with flying colors it's not behind you you pass through Hell and Hell can hold you you don't belong to hell you're walking hell is on the earth and you're walking to hell but hell Can't Hold You Hell couldn't hold Jesus when try to hold him hell had to give up they couldn't hold his character Jesus took our sins and CH and the devil and Hell couldn't hold him so he rose from the grave triumphant to bring that triumphant Spirit back upon his church back upon his people and he said because I live you shall live also could we give the Lord some worship this morning could we give the Lord some Praises this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah are you with me this morning oh glory to God Amen God's love elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God had chosen you through salvation through the santifico [Music] here we go take this soberly now he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffer as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign it is all with a purpose and if you did not have a purpose then he will be the auor of frustration and not of Peace so God is not trying to frustrate you you are frustrated because you are in conflict with the will of God for your life [Music] [Applause] I will see it again because you are in conflict with God's will in your life you are fed up stressed out and frustrated and the holidays doesn't matter doesn't make a difference because you're wasting your money wasting your time you're wasting your trip because the battle is still here even though you're on holidays so you're not really taking a holiday anyhow if you only come to church and get it correct you would be rejoicing right where you are and when you take the holidays it'll be a real holiday oh Hallelujah it'll be a Thanksgiving holiday thanking God for delivering you from them crazy thing in your head and your mind because the devil job is to rough you up slap you up tap you up mess you up tie you up grung you up that's the Devil he's a net snarer you like to snare Nets when you fall it you say catch it him but greater is he greater is he right now in you and he in the world amen glory so watch his purpose are we ready his purpose is after we have suffered a while we should be made perfect be established and strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in US you see here we go he himself suffered yes he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered Hebrews 58 and9 though he was son yet learn he obedience by the things which he suffered hallu and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation to them that obey him then Paul said I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which are be reveal in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him amen you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character there we go remember talking about character patience trials character development but listen to this one again because character simply is never made without suffering we have eight amens there that's okay it's still the word is still the truth character can't simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't re because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule so you can understand now why the Pentecostals run out with the gifts and so forth the Pentecostals run with the gifts with signs and ons and miracles with character am that's why they fail they have big churches 20,000 30,000 whatever it is but they fail because they didn't take the word that will bring them into this position into the place of trying bring them into a position where you even though your son have to make a call in an election show Peter knew about failure because he know he failed amen he fell but he know if you're at this life you don't have to fall if you make connection sure wait a minute I'm a son also I'm a worshipper so you can't come here and not worship because that's what the devil want there's two things God want from you a Sanctified life and worship if you're in sin you can't worship as you ought to worship but you live a Sanctified like you don't even have to have the Holy Ghost just be Sanctified just come clean and Worship the Lord that's all Worship the Lord when you worship you create an atmosphere hallelujah hallelujah you heard what I said when you worship you create the atmosphere you determine the atmosphere you want to live in by your worship to God oh hallelujah hallelujah okay A Man Without character can Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule what we need is to get back to the word get back to the real word and that will bring forth a brigh to Christ back to the true word now watch God is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises outside of them promises he can't meet you because you cut yourself off from him so your connection to God is based upon his promises are you with me oh blessed be the name of the Lord so therefore you are Sons and Daughters even before there was a moon or Star you are Sons and Daughters of God you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that you are in God in the beginning isn't that right therefore you are Gene therefore as sure as your Gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual Gene had to be in God because you are an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world there is no other way around it I want you to understand this election there is no other way around it you can't hope to be in it you have to be a thought before you could be a word before you can come into expression you have to be a gene back there oh hallelujah praise God Amen so what and through our Creed here we go we have disassociated to The Fellowship of the holy spirit this is powerful here what Creed does through Creeds we have disassociated the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit to anoint the word of God that is laced out for this generation we have separated the People by denomination that they cannot have a chance to see it see what the word for your generation amen not just that but your word because once you see your word your is your name if joh Jones inside of here and said John Jones he would say stand up stand up John Jones he stands up because he heard his name that's his name John Jones isn't that right when you hear the word that's your name your name is in the word isn't that right so you come to get connected to the reality of who you are now you bypass the word you came from thought to flesh to be tempted [Applause] a lot of times you only had taught to flesh but not the purpose taught to flesh to be tempted to be [Applause] tested so stop complaining about your Temptations that's what you are here [Applause] for some people will in through this is not SK this [Applause] morning Hallelujah you see here we go here I get to the attribute sons of his Spirit yes have not yet entered into the word form body we came from thought to flesh bypass did he offer the word body we have to connect back to that to be a real manifested son thought to flesh bypass the word but a word is a thought expressed so the word coming to you is your expression coming to you you are connecting with your expression so Jesus was clear when he said all that the father hath given me will come what he saying all the thought will become expressed I'm not hearing you when Jesus said my word will not written void that's [Music] true there is power in what we are preaching right now God don't need help to bring his word to pass he speaks and it is [Applause] so all he ask for us is to believe it amen look at ABR and Sarah God wait till the udge is awful Sarah passed bearing time Abraham is old and God come and tell Abraham you have a son Hallelujah and in your seed Nation can be blessed and then Abraham start to act little kind of funny God say playing Fresh come outside and look at this Stars count them count he said take change your name of that to let your name be change from Abraham to Abraham meaning High father he walking with a father with no children you talk about mockery you talk about laughing he making laugh stuck God set it up like that he walk with that father title walk with father of Nations and you have no children that's the God we serve make the critics criticize make the muckers muck and scuff give a testimony and prophesy Isaac is [Applause] coming how long 25 years oh Hallelujah and the Bible said Abraham a son Abraham as attribute of God believe God and not at the promise at the promise I'm not hearing you your feelings should be thrown on the building he didn't come and say feest thou this he said believest thou [Applause] [Music] this stop feeling sorry for yourself stop going over your path some people regate do that you knowbody bring back out and it again Jesus some people going and chew over the thing it have no virtue in your past as a man say his food are so bright he had a w Shad to look at it Hallelujah that's how you are begin to see your F so bright you can't use your normal glasses you to wear shades to see where your future going because your future is in God why think Pharaoh say cut them child and K kill all them children because you only hear a King born among them and them pharaohs don't want to hear no King around other than them Hallelujah but God said the people that know their God shall be strong huj and do great exploits I told you over and over the devil cannot get stronger the devil is the devil we were born in sin we were shap iniquity we coming from lightweight to middle weight now we join the heavyweight Oh Glory to God oh Hallelujah job was in the heavyweight division Moses heavyweight division Joshua in heavyweight division all them Prophet all heavyweight division God wait for a special bunch of people to qualify them for the heavyweight division this is Championship time This is war between good and evil light and darkness sons of God Called to manifest God in the hour to bring the invisible visible oh Hallelujah we can't be idle about this by these promises we become partakers of his divine nature and with his nature have authority with his nature have power with his nature have authority and [Applause] power you know what we heading to come on come onise God people could judge you you know that's okay they could judge you you know what they do they sentence you I'm you should be screaming on that one they could judge you I find your faults I find your this I find they could judge you but they got sentence you when God ready he go sentence you I sentence you to adoption come on now oh Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God glory to God this is my beloved Son yeah [Applause] him you may be seated say amen hallelujah take this message to heart this morning amen now what the difference between him and you Jesus and you as a son he was at the beginning of the word yes he came in morphe bu he came and lived in that in the person of mzc praise God don't we never heard about mezc because he became Jesus Christ Hallelujah mezc was a high priest that became Jesus Christ amen but now you bypass that because in that form he Jesus know all things and you have never been able to know that yet yet you come like Adam amen like me you come from attribute to flesh to be tempted amen but when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one so we not guessing if T over drop down dead in the morning he going on to another body that body in the box is not him that's another thing Al together that's the one with gray hair getting whole and back pain and tired and whatnot no more weary no more pain but he in a different body better ears Better Eyes forget about it that's the word

Amen come on you can make it it's a Theon upon you oh hallelujah hallelujah oh praise the Lord could you take some more now watch that is where we go that is the word now we don't understand understand it we have never become the word we have just become flesh man not the word but you see in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass your theophany you had to come down here in the flesh to be tempted by sin so we going to prove to Satan that we really not from here we are not from in the beginning we came from before the beginning so bring it on come on now say Amen somebody oh could we give the Lord I shout your praise you can't miss it you are going to make [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it I know you struggle with desires struggle with life struggle with things that's how life is is a struggle that's what it's all about Hallelujah a struggle like a chicken in an egg it struggles to get out it had to pip its way out God put that nature in the chick the P way inside the egg you can't find me you know I feel I'm feeling crackish I feel the crack it Jesus you're not frying the egg you're not boil the chicken is inside the deal Hallelujah God have a way and buil in way and

issue she had money but her money ran out see that's why sometime God to do sometimes make your money run out then you had to trust the Lord because your money run out of course you have to trust the Lord because your money not run out and when your money run out you got to do something more you got to press your way this woman told herself oh she told herself if I could just touch the H of His

write a book of Acts but say when the Pentecostal caught fire they begin to run them out amen and people say oh God every time I have fire here they run them here they run them here but you know God was letting them run them out persecution persecution they were persecuting the Pentecost you know what God is doing spread spreading the fire oh God why we had to move why we to go here God set fire here fire there fire there and spreading the fire devil confused devil didn't know what you're doing he running fire running fire running fire but this time this is bright fire boy holy ghost seven tunders gathered the bright together seven T how to repair a real Revival listen some powerful say there's a dynamic outpouring of the Holy Ghost God about to outpour his in a mighty mighty way but you have to have the seed inside of you the seed must be original it have scientist tampering making all kind of crazy seed genetic kind of thing that put it on the on the leaf on on the paper now that is Gen genetically modified all kind of thing they rejecting American chicken and all man have a cartoon have a pump like a bicc pump a chicken that's supposed to take 8 weeks two weeks and you have a chicken it pump up Jes but the devil kind of pumping up overnight people could just jump in Miss they criticize you and lie on you just they get pump up by the devil they have no history no testimony no character no trials nothing at all and they loosen them out devil just pump them up Pump them up somebody tell them something in the ears and they believe it and receive it devil pump them up Pump them up and you waiting 30 40 years for your placing and positioning and now this morning God say make it call elction short there's a f for Ministry yet because it take Dynamics to position place a f for Ministry it take Dynamics a position place a bride and we are waiting on it and I am not going to lose [Applause] [Music] focus so then when watch then you become subject okay now watch like you woman climing you got the Holy Ghost I going out here wearing shorts how could the spirit of God be in you ever do such a thing you can't he's not a filthy Spirit he's a Holy Spirit and when you become subject to that Spirit it CHS your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing here we go that Spirit are you ready that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened Hallelujah Made Alive do you understand why the foolish virgin will never receive the oil amen because they never receed the seed it was too late he said the spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest so when you come to church you come to church to get these promises because these promises are the word seeds going inside of you and when your time come the spirit will Quicken what's inside of you because my words a spirit and life so the word will turn into Spirit the mechanic Enoch reflected became Dynamics by the spirit and God took him so the word inside of you will turn into Spirit that's why the Bible when they say Lo here is Christ you know what that means L here is the man you're welcoming you say believe it not I like how the word say you know do not believe you know make it easy believe it not amen do not believe say look a man's man he's a man look every look for believe it not behold the kingdom is within [Music] you so when the revelation of God shows that you are pregnant with God Mary Mary ask right question how shall these things be he said the Holy Ghost shall over he said be it done unto me according to Thy word when you are pregnant with God Amen then you could Rejoice notice what Mary did when she received the word from the angel she ran to Elizabeth to testify of the Fulfillment of Prophecy in her life Christ is not yet manifest but she's witnessing the Angel's testimony because the scripture said a virgin shall conceive Mary know that's her name she know that's her the angel came as a witness of the scripture the angel have to come according to the word Hail Mary the Lord is with thee thou highly favored Oh Glory to God Mary you don't know that the Lord was always with her because she was a gene Tau in the mind of God but a 9-year-old can't produce no baby so why would the angel come and talk to Mary when she's nine has to be the right time oh so when she's ready what about you now oh Hallelujah why would God drop down signs and wonders to prove what we are right others are wrong what what where is the character where is the life it has to have a testimony of a life so when they have a testimony of a life and signs come nobody could question that and say that would be some unrighteous partaken of the Holy Ghost because he's a rascal that get anointed it can't be that it has to be a testimony first that's why we need thousand of voices devil could say whatever he want he go about with sweetness and Holiness and kindness say anything a real Christian that's what lacking now real Christian we have real church members we not talking about those guys Hallelujah we talking about real Christians that's the Thunder that shakes the devil Oh Glory to God real Christians real you can't lay a thinger on their life say anything to them Hallelujah I just feel away say anything to them what a test some of you so hot wrong your skin you can't say anything you know you had to watch your peas and D your eyes and so you could just flare up blood close to your skin you can't pass that test yet so you have to come to test where God could serve you say anything and go have somebody to serve you bam say fish when he open his mouth the hook hook but some people get caught because they open the mouth some keep them allou closed say anything to him just a sweet say nice know why silent ni when you open your mouth say something nice say something good if you don't know what to say just smile let the whole world smile with you oh hallelujah hallelujah sweet Christian genuine Christian isn't that right okay can keep you holding Hallelujah I have 17 pages and I reach page eight so you know that that means if I reach page 17 that next two hours all right but today is not that day one day I'll take it next two hours but today is not that day I have the anointing to do it you know Oh Glory Hallelujah oh here what I want to get think I going to wrap up here okay 2 Corinthians 51 if there Earth tacle be dissolved we have another one we we have bypassed that to come straight from God the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did but when testing of his word was over then we are taken up in this body that prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word dear that we skipped to come right down here to be tempted and tested and if we have come through that we'll have there'll be no temptation we would know all things so if we came to a theophany we'd have known all things that's the reason Jesus know all things because he was word before he was flesh and then we become the word the other part I get close with this here right here on Earth are we ready ask come up please here we are formed to the word [Applause] [Music] image to be a partaker of the word to feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah oh Hallelujah so here through the trials through the testing through the tribulation we are formed into the word image and that is what the Pentecostal missed they missed the word that could transform them into the statue of a perfect man amen character is not a gift is a victory and we are here to be tested and tempted and get mind battles and get Horrors and get pressed in order to be formed into the word of let's all stand praise God and just Worship the Lord thank you Lord [Applause] jesusall Jesus keeps
