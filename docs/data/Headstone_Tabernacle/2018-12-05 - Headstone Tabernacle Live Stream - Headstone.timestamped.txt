[17:53] afterwards in the New Testament but from
[17:59] Isaiah 6 I want to read from Busan one
[18:03] familiar script yeah but it says in a
[18:06] year that King Uzziah died I saw also
[18:08] the Lord sitting upon a throne high and
[18:12] lifted up and his train filled the
[18:16] temple above it stood the Seraphim each
[18:19] one had six wings with twain he covered
[18:23] his face and with twain he covered his
[18:26] feet and his Twain he did fly a man and
[18:30] one cried unto another and said holy
[18:33] holy is the Lord of hosts the whole
[18:36] earth is
[18:37] full of his glory and the posts of the
[18:40] door moved are the voice of him that
[18:43] cried and a house was filled with smoke
[18:46] then said I whoa is me for I am undone
[18:50] because I am a man of unclean lips and I
[18:54] dwell in the midst of a people of
[18:56] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[18:59] king the Lord of hosts a man the real
[19:03] king amen
[19:05] then flew one of the seraphim's unto me
[19:07] having a live coal in his hand which he
[19:10] had taken with the tongs from off the
[19:12] altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[19:14] said lo this had touched my lips
[19:17] and thine iniquity is taken away and I
[19:20] seen his purge also I heard a voice of
[19:23] the Lord saying whom shall I send and
[19:26] who will go for us then said I here am I
[19:29] send me
[19:30] and he said go and tell his people a man
[19:35] well he said go and tell his people here
[19:37] indeed but understand not and see indeed
[19:40] but receive not a man now let's turn
[19:42] over to book of st. John amen
[19:46] chapter 14 and I read from 16 also see
[19:53] in John 14 and reading from verse 15
[20:00] just to touch on something here 14 st.
[20:04] John 14 and verse 15 it says if you love
[20:07] me keep my Commandments and I will pray
[20:10] the father and he will give you another
[20:12] comforter and he may abide with you
[20:15] forever even the Spirit of Truth whom
[20:18] the world cannot receive because it
[20:21] seemed is cioth him not neither knoweth
[20:23] him but you know him for he dwelleth
[20:26] with you and shall be in you a man I
[20:31] will not leave you comfortless I will

[21:18] bear them now howbeit when he the spirit
[21:21] of truth is come he will guide you into
[21:24] all truth for he shall not speak of
[21:26] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[21:29] that shall he speak and he will show you
[21:33] things to come may go on our blessing -
[21:36] ring of his ruin him and his bow heads
[21:37] one more time father me Lord we've just

[22:41] amen and amen and amen glory to God you
[22:44] loved him tonight a many man well it's
[22:47] good to be in a house of God tonight
[22:48] the man were here to receive faith from
[22:50] God faith come by hearing the word
[22:54] hearing the Word of God that's what the
[22:56] prophets said amen not by hearing a
[22:59] voice of man or the voice of politics or
[23:02] the voice of this Bible prophet said
[23:05] there's so many voices in the world
[23:07] today but what we need tonight is to
[23:10] hear the voice of God amen because if
[23:13] the voice of God speak to us something
[23:16] different will take place something
[23:18] different will happen a lot of people
[23:21] not hearing the voice of God but they
[23:24] haven't other voices other influences
[23:27] other things happening around us and
[23:29] there's so much of it now there's so
[23:32] much of influences now and there's so
[23:35] much of turmoil that is very easily or
[23:39] very easy to get destructive
[23:41] isn't it right very easy to get pulled
[23:44] away so much happening in politics over
[23:47] the world today and with Trump and the
[23:49] president he says this and he does that
[23:52] and goes back on this treaty and and
[23:54] these things and all these things are
[23:56] perplexed cities great distress of
[23:58] nations of Bible says Amen and these
[24:01] things are not strange to us but yet
[24:03] we're in the midst of it where we're not
[24:06] off the world but where in the world a
[24:08] man is now right and there's challenges
[24:11] there's things that we have to face a
[24:13] man but what I feel a world wants to
[24:16] speak to us tonight that there's a
[24:18] spirit of truth that Jesus keep talking
[24:22] about now this spirit of truth and he
[24:25] said that yet a little while the world
[24:27] will see me no long and that's that
[24:32] speaks of a condition a condition that
[24:35] Jesus standing in that present that time
[24:38] there in the past but he was looking way
[24:40] down off into the future where we are
[24:42] and he was actually seeing a time where
[24:47] the world was no longer going to see
[24:49] Jesus are you understanding what I'm
[24:52] saying tonight
[24:54] we're talking about our condition the
[24:55] world were coming to where they were no
[24:58] longer see God where they're gonna no
[25:01] longer hear from God where people would
[25:05] no longer be influenced by positive and
[25:08] by the Spirit of God the Spirit of Truth
[25:10] and the spirit of honesty and
[25:12] uprightness and and holiness and purity
[25:15] and righteousness
[25:17] it's almost stripped almost away from
[25:20] the denominations and we look at how the
[25:24] condition of the world is going today
[25:26] even the religious realm even the
[25:29] political realm on whatever you look at
[25:31] it it there's a slow and steady decay
[25:34] and there's a slow and steady decline
[25:37] email is there a darkness coming upon
[25:41] the face of the earth cross darkness
[25:44] comment upon the people or court
[25:46] promised yet a little while even the
[25:49] will will see me no no but you are going

[26:16] hear a voice of call the Prophet said
[26:19] once more this way will hear pilot from
[26:22] car hallelujah just like they're tearing
[26:26] that from the days of the Apostles when
[26:28] Peter came out of the upper room who do

[26:44] afraid to go out in the street and so on
[26:45] he said teri in Jerusalem until you be
[26:48] endued with power from on high
[26:49] these were wanted men a man because
[26:53] Holland is now right Jesus was gone from
[26:54] them and hallelujah they prophesied to
[26:56] be part of a rebel group and there they
[26:59] were hiding

[27:02] what are we waiting for waiting on the
[27:04] power of God God brought a situation

[31:13] for new he call and really justified and
[31:16] we already clarified tonight you have
[31:20] what it takes to face the devil wherever
[31:24] you are tonight or somebody say man amen
[31:28] you've got what it takes or harder to
[31:31] pray more to seek the Lord more to go
[31:34] further the way to go harder until we
[31:40] get past the sump area and then nothing
[31:43] gonna hold us back oh I know this

[31:48] smack most people hold us back
[31:50] hallelujah praise amen amen
[31:53] am i shocked hallelujah hallelujah
[31:58] hallelujah that's what we're meant for
[32:02] meant to saw meant to fly but the bottom
[32:08] said he'd one time thing he went to a
[32:10] zoo I know a place or whatever that had
[32:13] a bird there we go and it was caged up
[32:17] isn't that right he was looking at it
[32:19] and he said a big bird caught up and he
[32:21] mounted up and he ran to us up he was
[32:24] beating himself against the cage war
[32:26] just tried to get out prophet said he
[32:30] said that bird wasn't meant to be like
[32:31] that it's all right people might have
[32:34] been there taking pictures and looking
[32:36] at
[32:36] up close maybe it's something it won't
[32:38] be able to see up close like that
[32:40] because they're always so far up on
[32:42] highway but here was one captured in a
[32:45] cave got caged a man and he couldn't get
[32:48] out the Prophet said it was he wasn't
[32:50] meant to be caged up like that that bird
[32:53] was meant to saw that bird was meant to
[32:56] fly and sometimes that's how we get when
[33:00] the enemy ties us up and gotten all tied
[33:02] up in all kind of cares of life and
[33:04] things of the world and sometimes
[33:07] legitimate things creep over creeping
[33:10] things and begin to creep into a prayer
[33:13] life and creep into our family life and
[33:16] creep into what we are a man what we
[33:19] ought to be in Christ it's also crippled
[33:21] or slowly and we may not notice it at
[33:24] first but slowly the enemy playing
[33:26] tricks and the enemy doing things to try
[33:29] to manipulate and try to to deconstruct
[33:32] and try to destroy our Christian walk a
[33:36] man but tonight by the Spirit of God
[33:38] amen we're here to cut them loose
[33:40] tonight I'll let you go I'll let you
[33:44] know that you ought not to be caged up
[33:46] like that but you are an eagle tonight
[33:49] you are born to soar into the heavenlies
[33:53] to scream out I catch the wind or holla
[33:57] fearless oh how the eye of a magnet
[34:00] prays calling or a magnifying glass a
[34:03] man you could see far off into the
[34:05] distance you could see your promises
[34:08] hollow you could see your prey down the
[34:10] road that's who you are tonight that's
[34:16] what God wants us to be tonight and the
[34:18] enemy's job is to try to confuse us to
[34:21] try to bind us to things to try to bind
[34:24] us to temporal things and they're
[34:26] legitimate things sometimes it's
[34:28] work-related sometimes it's whatever you
[34:30] know you have your plans and so on but
[34:32] yet the Prophet said plan for the next
[34:34] 20 years but live like he's coming
[34:37] tomorrow we got to live every moment
[34:39] like he's coming to know because you
[34:43] don't know
[34:43] the hour or the moment when he's going
