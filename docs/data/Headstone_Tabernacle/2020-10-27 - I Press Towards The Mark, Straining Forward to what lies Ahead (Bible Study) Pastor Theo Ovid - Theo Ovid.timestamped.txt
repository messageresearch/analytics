[9:08] save in greece granted lord and jesus
[9:10] may ask it
[9:11] amen and amen god bless you church
[9:14] and it's good to be here and tonight
[9:17] i'll be
[9:17] sharing something with you and i trust
[9:20] it would
[9:21] be an encouragement and help to you i
[9:23] trust that you
[9:24] were encouraged by sunday's service
[9:27] uh marked by god or marked
[9:30] by the beast goddess about isaac you
[9:33] made it in
[9:35] he had a hectic day today and we're
[9:37] looking forward to hearing from him
[9:39] sharing
[9:40] more of that great stuff that he shares
[9:43] and um you know it's
[9:46] an amazing time that we're living in a
[9:48] very stressful time
[9:50] a great time uh the bible talk about a
[9:53] time of trouble that is yet to come
[9:55] and we have our own troubles to deal
[9:57] with our own challenges that you deal
[9:59] with
[10:00] so in time like these the scriptures and
[10:02] the word of god becomes a great
[10:04] encouragement
[10:05] because we don't belong to this modern
[10:08] society where
[10:10] anything goes we have our
[10:13] solid foundation on the scriptures and
[10:16] that is where our feet is based on
[10:18] you know as america head towards this
[10:20] critical election
[10:22] and i want to share with you that god is
[10:26] neither democrat or republican
[10:29] god is the word so it's a matter of
[10:33] which is unless of two evils but this it
[10:36] is what it is
[10:37] and we know america is moving into its
[10:40] place in prophecy
[10:42] and if america is moving into its place
[10:44] in prophecy
[10:46] where the bible speaks about it was it
[10:49] it was born as a lamb and which speaks
[10:51] like a dragon
[10:52] the whole tone and and way that we know
[10:57] of america will change
[10:58] it has to change and it's amazing
[11:02] how the church world is so caught up in
[11:04] politics
[11:06] in america and this is also prophesied
[11:09] this is all have to be because at the
[11:11] behind everything
[11:13] there's a roman spirit we talk about
[11:15] spirit now
[11:17] spirit is a roman spirit that is
[11:20] the behind the scenes then so whatever
[11:23] you see in front
[11:24] behind that is the spirit of rome that
[11:27] mother hallett
[11:28] that god one day say that she will
[11:31] destroy
[11:32] so i want you to know tonight that we
[11:35] are
[11:35] going headlong into prophecy
[11:38] we'll be fools and we'll be like going
[11:42] on in a basement and saying there is no
[11:43] light
[11:44] if we try to blind our eyes on the
[11:46] reality that we are living in the times
[11:50] or the clues and times of the gentiles
[11:52] and it's up to each one of us
[11:54] to make our call in an election show
[11:57] it's up to each one of us
[11:58] to really take time out to seek the lord
[12:02] and ask god
[12:03] for your portion ask for your
[12:05] inheritance ask god for your word
[12:08] and i trust tonight that what we share
[12:10] would would help you
[12:12] and encourage you that is not just uh
[12:15] uh uh other like an easy floating thing
[12:18] back it's not it's not gonna be like
[12:19] that
[12:20] we're gonna find out from the wood
[12:21] tonight so tonight each of your bibles
[12:23] i'd like you to turn
[12:24] to two portion scriptures tonight
[12:27] one from a familiar one luke 16
[12:30] 16 and
[12:38] philippians chapter 3 verse 7 to 14.
[12:41] that is the
[12:41] two scriptures we read tonight luke 16
[12:44] 16
[12:45] and it reads the law and the prophets
[12:48] wanted john
[12:49] since that time the kingdom of god is
[12:53] preached
[12:54] and every man presses into it
[12:57] and philippians 3 7-14
[13:01] this is paul but what things were gained
[13:04] to me those i counted those i counted
[13:08] lost for christ
[13:09] ye doubtless and i count all things but
[13:12] lost for the excellency of the knowledge
[13:15] of christ jesus my lord
[13:17] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[13:19] things and do condemn but dawn
[13:22] that i may gain christ and be found in
[13:25] him
[13:26] not having my own righteousness which is
[13:28] of the law
[13:29] but that which is true the fate of
[13:31] christ
[13:32] the righteousness which is of god by
[13:35] faith
[13:36] that i may know him and the power of his
[13:39] resurrection
[13:40] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[13:43] being made conformable
[13:44] unto his death if by any means i might
[13:47] attain unto the resurrection of the dead
[13:49] not as though i had already attained
[13:52] either will already perfect but i follow
[13:55] after
[13:56] if that i may apprehend that for which
[13:59] also i'm apprehended of christ jesus
[14:02] brethren i can't not myself to have
[14:05] apprehended
[14:06] but this one thing i do forgetting those
[14:09] things which are behind
[14:11] and reaching forth unto those things
[14:14] which are before
[14:15] i press towards the mark for the price
[14:20] of the high calling of god in christ
[14:22] jesus this boy has one more time father
[14:24] we thank you for your word
[14:25] we have read it lord and then you
[14:26] inspire the this whole
[14:29] teaching and what we share tonight that
[14:31] our lives i'm having children
[14:33] in jesus name i asked amen god bless you
[14:38] praise god and this scripture
[14:41] i want to get down to this verse here in
[14:42] the amplified
[14:44] and paul was saying in verse 12 this is
[14:46] amplified
[14:47] not that i have not attained
[14:51] this ideal or have already been made
[14:53] perfect
[14:54] but i press on only hold of
[14:58] grasp and make my own
[15:02] that for which christ jesus the messiah
[15:04] has laid hold of me
[15:06] and made me his own i do not consider
[15:09] brethren
[15:10] that i have captured and make it my own
[15:13] yet but one thing i do
[15:16] it is my one aspiration forgetting
[15:20] what lies behind and straining
[15:24] forward to what lies ahead i
[15:27] press on towards the goal to win
[15:30] the supreme and heavenly prize to which
[15:33] god in christ jesus
[15:35] is calling us upward so tonight i have a
[15:39] title i like to give it
[15:40] i press towards the mark straining
[15:44] forward
[15:45] to what lies ahead now nobody like to
[15:48] stream
[15:49] people like to it things will work out
[15:52] you have your certain expectation and
[15:55] and because of your expectation
[15:56] when it doesn't work out according to
[15:58] your expectation you get disappointed
[16:01] a disappointment and your disappointment
[16:04] is a difference between
[16:05] what is your expectation and what is the
[16:07] manifestation
[16:09] and sometimes you have to ask yourself
[16:11] do you ask yourself
[16:12] what is god's expectation you know when
[16:15] we know
[16:16] that if it doesn't work out as we expect
[16:19] that
[16:20] god will work all things for good to
[16:22] them that love him
[16:23] and if we love him he could just want
[16:26] he's just going to work things out
[16:28] no i don't want the songs scattered
[16:32] scattered tonight
[16:33] but there's some things that upon my
[16:34] heart and i will say like isaac we'll
[16:37] have a conversation tonight
[16:39] something that i don't get to do i'll be
[16:41] honest
[16:42] preaching and everything else but we
[16:43] could have a conversation tonight
[16:45] because i was thinking tonight
[16:46] uh what to share with you and i was
[16:49] thinking about
[16:51] the bible talk about that god bless and
[16:53] elijah
[16:55] and until the restitution of all things
[16:56] in other words he lies the last spirit
[16:58] will come
[16:59] and there'll be a restoration of all
[17:01] things
[17:02] so the prophecy hanging over us is to
[17:05] literally see
[17:06] a restoration of what they had in the
[17:08] beginning which is that book of acts
[17:11] which is that they are pentecost that we
[17:12] spoke about that
[17:14] is our target our goal that is our mark
[17:18] that we have to get back to and um we
[17:21] have to be able to say
[17:22] this this scripture is fulfilled that is
[17:24] what prophesied of the prophet's
[17:26] message that our hearts will be turned
[17:28] back literally
[17:30] back to the feet of the fathers so all
[17:32] this church thing
[17:34] this is not the promise then the promise
[17:37] is not the church the church
[17:38] building uh the arrangement of the
[17:40] church church
[17:42] the real church is a mystery that real
[17:46] church is a mystery and that mystery
[17:48] really is the body of christ
[17:50] what we have is fellowship a building
[17:53] a place where we gather together shake
[17:55] one of our hands well not no
[17:57] not no that was before this is pandemic
[18:00] but the
[18:00] the thing about it the real church is
[18:02] the body of christ
[18:04] and that body of christ is a mystery and
[18:06] to get into that body
[18:08] you have to be baptized with the holy
[18:11] ghost
[18:12] this is what this is all about being
[18:15] baptized into the body
[18:17] and in that body have access to all the
[18:20] other blessings that god have in store
[18:22] for
[18:22] his people but be it as it is me
[18:25] where we are at right now go send a
[18:28] prophet to reveal the old plan of god
[18:30] the first thing that god has to deal
[18:32] with is the sin question
[18:34] the question of your past the question
[18:35] of your behavior of your attitude
[18:38] and one thing was striking me it cannot
[18:41] be by works
[18:43] that we get blessed it has to be by
[18:45] faith
[18:46] by grace this is how god set it up
[18:49] and it ties in with the jubilee that the
[18:52] jubilee was only because
[18:54] somebody couldn't pay themselves they
[18:55] couldn't redeem themselves and god put
[18:58] that
[18:58] that space inside the deer to make a
[19:01] provision for deliverance
[19:03] and favoritism and you have to accept
[19:07] what god say about you the problem today
[19:10] is
[19:11] we are hearing but we are not saying
[19:13] like paul
[19:14] we want we want it to be as our own
[19:17] we want this bible to be as our own we
[19:20] want the word spoken to be as our own
[19:22] we have to claim it as our very own
[19:26] i forget the things that are passed and
[19:28] if you could get that right tonight
[19:30] forget your past you come through so
[19:31] much of stuff and sometimes your mind is
[19:33] twisted
[19:34] your spirit is twisted and messed up and
[19:36] the only thing he could
[19:38] rest back on really is what god has said
[19:41] because you yourself will find yourself
[19:43] as a failure
[19:44] failure as a father as a brother as a
[19:47] mother
[19:48] as a wife as a husband you have not come
[19:51] up to mark
[19:52] not because you're a bad person there's
[19:55] no school
[19:56] of parenting there was no school of
[19:59] how to be a great husband not to be a
[20:01] great wife we
[20:03] do the best that we can and we we press
[20:04] on in god but the reality is
[20:07] uh we have more to learn and paul was
[20:10] saying
[20:11] i have no righteousness on my own and
[20:14] yet
[20:14] he was a pharisee and yet he was a big
[20:17] serious person a righteous man
[20:20] and he come to allah there's nothing
[20:22] because he wants to learn christ
[20:24] and the thing of it is many times
[20:28] we want something but we don't want to
[20:30] let go the past
[20:31] we want what's ahead but we don't want
[20:34] to
[20:35] give up what we have and and i'm afraid
[20:38] it can't work that way you can't have a
[20:40] good ways
[20:41] if you want to move forward you have to
[20:44] leave what is behind you but more than
[20:48] that
[20:48] i don't just be pressing as a
[20:50] terminology i press it are you going a
[20:51] long time people ask you oh you're going
[20:52] suppress it
[20:54] no no i want to see press in a different
[20:57] way tonight
[20:58] a wonderc press as has been able to go
[21:00] beyond
[21:02] and strain towards this is what i'm
[21:05] trying to get to you
[21:06] you see with all this training with all
[21:09] the pushing
[21:11] you're just dear you know you know
[21:13] you're supposed to go
[21:14] forward but there is no active
[21:19] participation and you know
[21:23] lord thank you for your blessing but
[21:25] there's no person really there's
[21:27] there is um a kind of liturgy
[21:30] a sluggishness a laziness if i could be
[21:34] roughing it up tonight
[21:36] this is the past any house tonight
[21:37] having a conversation
[21:39] but when when it comes to
[21:43] strain into what is before like the
[21:44] title we give tonight
[21:46] straining to what let me see together
[21:49] tonight
[21:50] i pressed was the marks training forward
[21:53] towards lies ahead
[21:55] that is why i'm so troubled when people
[21:57] see this past already and that pass
[21:59] already
[21:59] and like if we adopted and everything is
[22:02] fine we're just waiting on
[22:03] on uh when he press come down to what
[22:04] she took building i don't want the price
[22:06] to come down to washington told them
[22:08] i want to know what i have now i want
[22:11] when goliath come
[22:12] i am eat no beer i am meat no lion
[22:15] faith comes by experience not just by
[22:18] revelation
[22:19] you have to have an experience to have
[22:22] faith you know it come like if you never
[22:24] sell something before you never say
[22:26] you want to buy you never sell something
[22:28] before the first they try to sell
[22:30] something you have so much
[22:31] a news and everything else because you
[22:32] don't you don't have the experience
[22:34] but when when you sell one item two
[22:36] items three items ten items
[22:38] you're are salesman you know to talk to
[22:41] people
[22:42] because you have the experience so this
[22:44] is the whole thing about it
[22:46] church we have been sitting in services
[22:49] for many years we are about to get some
[22:53] experiences
[22:55] hallelujah you are about to get some
[22:58] experiences
[22:59] i could tell you think it's not strange
[23:01] and you know the rest of the scripture
[23:03] of the fiery trials take it that's
[23:05] strange that the hopes are hell is
[23:06] against you
[23:07] listen listen the devil have all
[23:10] all all all all dwell on you take any
[23:13] immaculate
[23:13] except those who names already and if
[23:15] your name is written
[23:17] hallelujah if your name is written
[23:20] you you have to press you can't help it
[23:23] it's a behavior inside of you there is
[23:26] no
[23:27] giving up there is no letting go one of
[23:30] the things you have to press past for
[23:32] sure is frustration
[23:33] because frustration when you're
[23:34] frustrated you can't see the right
[23:35] pictures
[23:36] because you your mind dizzy your your
[23:39] days
[23:40] you're frustrated you're fed up you
[23:42] can't take it no more
[23:43] you can't talk like that we're having a
[23:45] conversation i
[23:47] i the bible teacher come in don't worry
[23:50] next you can get some goodbye with
[23:52] teaching stuff but um we have a
[23:54] conversation tonight i have things to
[23:55] share with you and i want to share with
[23:57] you
[23:57] because i want you to see i pressure was
[24:01] the mark
[24:02] not just in the context of the scripture
[24:04] written here but i want to see a person
[24:06] towards the mark of god
[24:08] i want you to see yourself present
[24:10] towards a mark as a goal
[24:12] i want you to see the presence was a
[24:13] mark of achievement and you should have
[24:15] goals and have markers
[24:18] and have ambition and have where you
[24:22] want to be and where you want to go just
[24:23] like the prophet said
[24:24] live like jesus christ coming tomorrow
[24:26] but the
[24:28] plan like if you come in uh like plan
[24:30] you make your plans 20 years
[24:32] 10 years you make your plans and the
[24:34] reason i'm seeing that
[24:36] is that without marks without goals
[24:39] without targets we just go into the
[24:42] motion
[24:43] what a mark does a mark could identify
[24:47] how you have progressed this is what mac
[24:50] does
[24:51] this is what achievement does and just
[24:53] as in the phone world that flip phone
[24:55] that have all them things are making
[24:56] circle
[24:57] stand up and phone boot you don't see
[24:59] those things no more
[25:00] when you stop in full moon and put your
[25:02] coin because somebody said this can't
[25:04] work this car continues like that
[25:06] nobody stands in front of any boot to
[25:07] put in any coin that's cell phone
[25:10] and after cell phone now he was just
[25:11] calling and whatnot
[25:13] then they say no we need more we need a
[25:15] glass we need
[25:16] we need to see we need video we need
[25:18] that communication thing
[25:20] what are they doing they keep improving
[25:22] they keep adding
[25:23] and this is why we could do what we do
[25:25] right now in this virtual room because
[25:27] somebody
[25:28] is thinking ahead they're going forward
[25:30] in the spiritual realm
[25:32] we have to move forward in the same
[25:35] manner
[25:36] with steps goals

[26:02] building
[26:03] this how companies make profits this is

[26:14] failure doesn't mean to stop if you're
[26:16] feeling you feel forward
[26:17] don't feel backward feel moving forward

[26:30] on pause you're going to push the press
[26:33] push to achieve we want to achieve a
[26:36] revival
[26:37] we know revival means that kind of being
[26:38] a revival the people have living a
[26:40] revival
[26:41] but but you yourself have to see
[26:43] yourself worthy of this revival

[26:48] this revival
[26:49] and buddha made the prayer lord make me
[26:52] a revival
[26:53] create the revival in me i want you
[26:55] tonight
[26:56] to be able to say these words i press
[26:59] towards the mark strain into what is a
[27:02] hell
[27:03] i want you to be able to speak for
[27:05] yourself what you pressing on to
[27:07] what you're pushing onto and don't look
[27:10] to the left or look to the right
[27:14] get into the word get into this study
[27:16] your brain
[27:17] talk about elijah and jehu and
[27:20] and one of the lessons that really
[27:21] touched me a lot was the jehu uh
[27:23] teaching
[27:24] because it shows the judgment of god
[27:27] when that begins to ride nothing will
[27:29] stop it whatever god said will happen
[27:32] when brother branham saw the vision of
[27:34] america being destroyed under the
[27:36] structure
[27:37] that is already passed and let me as i
[27:41] said has already passed
[27:42] let me read the scripture for you
[27:44] centrist in scripture is from
[27:45] ecclesiastes chapter 3 and it's verse 13
[27:49] to 14.
[27:50] if you want to find it or you want to
[27:51] take a note of it ecliesis
[27:53] chapter 3 verse 13 to 14 and it says and
[27:56] also
[27:57] that every man should eat
[28:00] and drink well let me find that i wanted
[28:03] this whole one second
[28:04] praise the lord
[28:14] declares
[28:16] chapter 3
[28:21] okay who is 14 and 15 right not 18 14.
[28:24] i know that whatsoever god do it it
[28:27] shall be forever
[28:29] nothing can be put to it no anything
[28:32] taken from it
[28:33] and god do it that men should fear
[28:36] before him that which had been
[28:39] is now that which is to be
[28:43] had already been and god
[28:46] required that which is passed and
[28:49] amplified said that which is now already
[28:51] has been
[28:52] that which is to be already has been and
[28:54] god seeks that which has passed by
[28:57] so that history repeats itself
[29:01] and you know what god said about this
[29:04] message
[29:05] okay i mean
[29:09] what god required of us is pentecost
[29:11] that already passed
[29:12] they already got the holy ghost he
[29:14] already were adopted a doctor's
[29:16] adoption of nothing is nothing foreign
[29:18] is because both
[29:19] and the angel met him and because the
[29:21] angel met him 1946
[29:23] he introduced the age of adoption
[29:26] because we had the long period of
[29:28] pentecost
[29:29] and god has to climax that with the
[29:31] manifestation of the reveal of the son
[29:32] of man
[29:33] and the son of man is the manifestation
[29:36] that brings seed
[29:38] let me say it again the son of man is
[29:40] who brings seed he's his soul
[29:42] and every time you son of man come you
[29:44] have to look for a manifestation of
[29:45] spirit after son of man because after
[29:47] son of man you see son of god
[29:49] this is what happened in jesus name he
[29:51] came son of man as the god prophet
[29:53] himself
[29:54] and he brought seed and he keeps seeding
[29:56] on these
[29:57] men who were frail who were backslidden
[30:01] who was in conditions
[30:02] who was in different situations carnal
[30:04] men natural men
[30:05] and he had to tell them and teach them
[30:08] and share with them
[30:09] things of this kingdom they were not
[30:11] aware of that
[30:12] they were born just like you and i in
[30:14] sin shaping iniquity just like you and i
[30:16] struggling men fish are men that's
[30:18] collector and so on
[30:19] and he call these men and began to share
[30:22] with them seeds
[30:23] and with sharing seeds which is
[30:24] prophecies over them
[30:26] he began to demonstrate the powers of
[30:28] the kingdom
[30:29] that they were going into they don't
[30:31] know about his kingdom he gave them an
[30:33] anointing they went
[30:34] and do works in that anointing but he
[30:37] was showing them
[30:38] that the kingdom i am from it has power
[30:41] it has demonstration it have healing it
[30:44] casts all devils and they say most i do
[30:46] you shall do also all these things was
[30:48] at the intellectual level to these men
[30:51] he appeared among them encouraged them
[30:53] peter went fishing
[30:54] peter in the backswing after he rose
[30:56] from the dead he can't find peter peter
[30:58] got a virgin and have his own little
[31:00] fellowship
[31:00] and peter going fishing what they used
[31:02] to do three and a half years ago peter
[31:04] in a condition
[31:05] jesus still come after them because
[31:06] these are the men god gave him
[31:08] and he called them they get settled
[31:11] stand up in the upper room
[31:12] until they get poor from on high no the
[31:15] church is about to be
[31:17] built this is the the church in action
[31:20] this is the original church
[31:21] this is the church that called longed
[31:23] for proud of this church that's when
[31:25] they started up
[31:26] they get licks they get blows because
[31:29] they was manifest in god
[31:31] we have no licks to get and manifest
[31:33] unless we start to manifest god
[31:35] when god is manifested the devil is
[31:37] angry
[31:38] when they stagger in the upper room
[31:40] barramundi the devil just turned over
[31:41] and he didn't bother with them because
[31:43] he finally just having a fanatical time
[31:45] they only have a whoopee hello your
[31:47] glory are rolling the floor and whatnot
[31:48] right you never got impressed with her
[31:50] see it and then moving with that
[31:52] when the life is being made manifest
[31:55] that's a different thing altogether now
[31:58] how did they give me the upper room
[31:59] i am worried i have feeling with him i
[32:01] think no that wasn't that i wasn't the
[32:03] talk
[32:04] they received what was spoken to them
[32:07] mary magdalene was there mary
[32:10] the mother of jesus was dear the andrew
[32:13] was there apostle was there
[32:14] prophet was there pastor was there
[32:16] teacher was there congregation was there
[32:18] everybody was there waiting
[32:21] on a promise that god has made
[32:25] so i i don't understand this big me
[32:27] little you and who higher who are more
[32:29] revelation and whatnot
[32:30] i don't even understand those things
[32:31] those are mysteries to me those are
[32:32] serious myths recently
[32:34] what i understand is that the grace of
[32:35] god has come to us open our eyes
[32:38] save us how thankful we should be every
[32:42] single day you should be grateful every
[32:44] single day should be thankful

[32:47] you have some place to sleep
[32:49] you have you still eaten you're still
[32:51] moving on
[32:52] yes you might not have all what you
[32:54] would want or but god given you what you
[32:56] need
[32:57] and that's and to that end you should be
[32:59] grateful
[33:00] you know you're moving into vision you
[33:03] john had a vision
[33:04] all these seals and breaking our seals
[33:05] and white was from there's vision
[33:07] that's not the reality of it think about
[33:09] it now so we have been talking a lot
[33:12] but it's more in vision when
[33:15] you begin to walk in the reality of the
[33:18] vision that's a different story
[33:20] right i visit my home i have a little
[33:21] party i was walking today and i was
[33:23] thinking
[33:24] i said but you know something if 1975
[33:29] when i was maybe 17 years old god had
[33:31] told me you'll be living
[33:32] 36 chestnut avenue opposite you'll have
[33:35] a park
[33:36] and you will have your grandchildren
[33:38] running there
[33:39] i said my that is something
[33:42] think about it he could have told me
[33:45] that when i was 17
[33:46] and i was going to just wonder how can
[33:49] this be
[33:50] and the same god that know the end from
[33:53] the beginning know your house your house
[33:55] number
[33:55] nudikaya driving nowhere you go to work
[33:58] know
[33:58] everything about you he could take care
[34:00] of you
[34:02] he could help you he could intervene on
[34:04] your behalf
[34:06] he could restore you he could heal you
[34:09] he'd know every ache in your body he
[34:11] knew every condition he knew his sigh in
[34:13] your heart
[34:13] you know when you're crying you know
[34:15] when you're done you know where you
[34:17] press and guess what he cares for you he
[34:20] genuinely cares for you he's not up in
[34:21] the mountains somewhere hiding and he
[34:23] don't want to care
[34:24] and whatnot no no he cares he genuinely
[34:27] cares for you
[34:28] and he want that word to have that
[34:29] preeminences in your life
[34:32] or could you give me some praises
[34:33] tonight all right
[34:36] let's go now
[34:40] this is to encourage you tonight this is
[34:41] something from the prophet and i want to
[34:43] read it here for you tonight
[34:44] now jesus crossing the boat crossing the
[34:47] sea i could just imagine how
[34:49] that was he preached all day
[34:52] and the night a big storm come up on the
[34:54] sea and like to sunk the little boat
[34:57] wary and tired but never afraid
[35:01] i like that jesus didn't have to go out
[35:05] and fast all day
[35:06] and pray all day and then say no i
[35:10] wonder
[35:11] if i have faith enough to do this he was
[35:14] here we go he was unconscious of the
[35:17] faith that he had
[35:19] and any men or woman that ever make real
[35:22] warriors
[35:23] in the kingdom of god is perfectly
[35:28] unconscious to their feet
[35:31] you keep trying to test your feet i
[35:32] wonder if i have enough faith enough to
[35:34] do this
[35:34] have i got enough it don't test
[35:38] your feet god said so do it
[35:41] anyhow god churchill have you ever
[35:44] tested your feet whether you have enough
[35:45] feet to come to
[35:46] the meeting or not tonight did you test
[35:48] your feet to see if you had enough feet
[35:50] to eat your supper tonight
[35:52] do you think you have enough to fast a
[35:54] while and then test your feet
[35:55] to see if you have enough feet to drive
[35:56] your car home certainly not
[35:58] it's just automatically you believe and
[36:01] that's
[36:02] the way you believe healing believe
[36:04] anything
[36:05] god said just don't fight at it and
[36:08] shake at it and rebuke the devil every
[36:10] minute just accept it
[36:12] and go on that's it and there's nothing
[36:15] to be alarmed about
[36:17] god said so and that's settle it
[36:20] oh my so friends i hope this encourages
[36:23] you tonight
[36:24] about this feet it's an unconscious feet
[36:28] you already have it it's inside of you
[36:31] god sent a message to activate that fate
[36:34] just before i came on
[36:36] uh my son gideon called me and he told
[36:37] me i was driving his car
[36:39] and he got a flat tire and then he
[36:42] changed his style he got one thing and
[36:43] then he started to think about he said
[36:45] he was just telling me he said he has
[36:47] four nuts hole in this tire
[36:50] he said people has wanted not to have
[36:52] faith
[36:53] they have faith to drive the car and as
[36:55] he says
[36:56] four little nuts you know four little
[36:58] nuts and he turned in nothing
[37:00] and and he like you get a revelation
[37:03] of faith at work four knots
[37:06] holding an attire and you busting it
[37:09] down the road not even thinking
[37:10] twice it's just four knots not 24
[37:13] 4. that's what we're talking about well
[37:16] i want you and i
[37:18] we have to live that kind of way where
[37:20] it's not a matter do i have enough feet
[37:22] and take a deep breath rule out and then
[37:24] if you come out no no no you're just
[37:26] going to pray for the sick
[37:28] you're going to pray for your bread over
[37:29] your bread you're going to pray for your
[37:31] breakthrough
[37:32] you're going to pray for your healing
[37:33] and have confidence that god
[37:35] who made a promise he's going to bring
[37:37] that promise to pass do you love him
[37:38] tonight
[37:39] i trust this would help you in some way
[37:41] tonight amen so therefore the kingdom of
[37:43] god
[37:44] doesn't come without trials men press
[37:47] their way into it
[37:49] oh the kingdom of god doesn't come back
[37:51] by observation
[37:53] so friends i want to encourage you
[37:55] tonight
[37:56] because this ephesians church we're
[37:58] going back to and we have to go back
[38:00] that is god's gold standard that is
[38:03] called gold standard
[38:05] not galatians not hebrews
[38:08] not corinthians even though it have
[38:10] those types
[38:12] the target or the mark
[38:15] or the goal is to touch down to
[38:17] ephesians
[38:19] that is where we had ended ephesians
[38:22] paul had no issues
[38:23] paul just dropped the bomb on them and
[38:26] let them know
[38:27] that he had chosen us in him before the
[38:30] foundation of the world
[38:32] and predestinated us under adoption and
[38:35] this
[38:35] is a great high calling in christ jesus
[38:39] it is the it is the greatest thing that
[38:41] you could
[38:43] that you could see as a goal as an
[38:45] achievement a very
[38:46] high calling called into this position
[38:49] to be adopted into the kingdom of god
[38:52] so your desire tonight shouldn't be
[38:55] i want to be in a church or i want to
[38:58] join a church
[38:59] your desire is to conform to that spot
[39:03] where you're responding to the high
[39:04] calling in god in other words
[39:06] the olympics they get the very best
[39:09] every country will just speak up people
[39:10] hey you feel
[39:11] if you look at run they run let me see
[39:13] okay you're looking like you're running
[39:14] fast
[39:15] that's not always work that's not hot
[39:17] you have qualifiers
[39:19] everybody have to get the test you're
[39:21] running this race you're in that race
[39:23] good you want tree out to the best tree
[39:25] then them you know when you line them up
[39:27] and you run when they get the very best
[39:29] then they send them to the olympics
[39:31] because they have a price together it
[39:33] might sound like a small price base a
[39:34] big gold medal or whatnot
[39:36] one person win that and the whole
[39:38] country hey every whole country you know
[39:40] up row
[39:41] get house they get money manchester
[39:43] united are javelin and he get a whole
[39:45] set of things for president javelin
[39:46] afterwards everybody's had a pelt
[39:48] looking to build something
[39:49] but the point about it is this you
[39:52] cannot
[39:53] you cannot you're not trained and expect
[39:56] to be in the olympics
[39:57] so if god ever of a bunch of people that
[39:59] he predestinated
[40:01] you could have been born in neutral age
[40:03] work at a predestinating wesley age
[40:05] and all you you're dressed right up here
[40:07] awesome buggy on those so you're waiting
[40:09] to write
[40:09] oh i'll cut you're hitting your horse
[40:12] and buggy to go home
[40:14] and god choose to bless you to go beyond
[40:16] that
[40:17] and bring you in this age for a purpose
[40:20] a special purpose you have passed two
[40:23] different groups
[40:24] different pastors different ministers
[40:26] and preachers because you're struggling
[40:28] you're fighting you you're looking for
[40:30] something you're looking to get a word
[40:32] from the lord you find yourself in this
[40:35] circle of fellowship because this is
[40:36] what this is
[40:37] is fellowship and in this fellowship now
[40:39] god could help you and present you with
[40:41] a vision
[40:42] and this vision is to give you access
[40:45] rights that you could be effectively
[40:48] empowered as an individual not dependent
[40:52] let me say that again i'll just say this
[40:57] we are not here to downgrade you
[41:01] to um like
[41:05] so the catholic church have bishops at
[41:08] bishops
[41:10] cardinals and and eventually there are
[41:12] poops like i don't know all he ran
[41:14] something but there's really plenty
[41:15] names
[41:16] candy titles because you have to move up
[41:18] the ranks
[41:22] beautifully just have sons and daughters
[41:24] have some other daughters
[41:25] and his sons and daughters uh have to be
[41:28] assisted
[41:29] in being perfected by five offices
[41:33] that's what he set up which is pastor
[41:36] teacher prophet evangelist
[41:37] an apostle these gifts are not to be
[41:40] glorified
[41:42] men but these gifts are to for the
[41:44] saints
[41:45] let me say that so these guys are to be
[41:47] used
[41:49] for the same sport buster that means
[41:51] they asked to serve
[41:53] the saints not the saints of them i
[41:56] think i think sometimes
[41:57] people are they cannot back the front
[41:59] the objective
[42:00] is is for these guys to be channels of
[42:04] god
[42:05] that they could get the people into a
[42:07] relationship with god
[42:09] that the people could have direct access
[42:12] to presence and power
[42:15] because the levitical priesthood has
[42:17] been cancelled
[42:18] sorry hallelujah and there's a new uh
[42:21] priesthood after the order of manchester
[42:23] united
[42:24] forgets it i i i will that's why i will
[42:26] go together
[42:27] hallelujah a new order
[42:30] has been has been ordained of god
[42:32] because when god canceled
[42:34] the old priesthood when jesus came the
[42:36] veil was read from the top to the bottom
[42:39] to give direct access so this
[42:42] this special priesthood thing that only
[42:44] this man could go in
[42:46] god cancel all of that and make a way
[42:49] that
[42:49] you the people could come right in
[42:52] and that is why it has always been about
[42:55] his people my people shall
[42:59] never be ashamed this is what this is
[43:01] about
[43:02] and you can understand god's burden
[43:06] when the church begin to fall away
[43:09] let me say it again you could understand
[43:12] why god could say
[43:13] this is one thing that you have that you
[43:17] hate the deeds of the liquor later
[43:20] which i also hate he identify
[43:24] the rulership of man over his people the
[43:28] spirit of man
[43:29] has something to hate and whatever god
[43:32] hate
[43:33] we have to hit whatever god love
[43:36] we have to love god is desirous
[43:40] of reconciling his sons back into
[43:44] a relationship with him hallelujah
[43:48] not a relationship true men
[43:52] not a relationship truly pastor bishop
[43:55] pope or whatever mary or any
[43:59] accessory or any other assistance or
[44:01] whatever it is
[44:02] what the burden that god has sent forth
[44:05] is to
[44:06] it's the true the ministry is to get men
[44:09] right back to god
[44:11] so when it's all over let's let's slide
[44:14] a little down in ephesians
[44:16] till we all come into the unity of the
[44:19] faith all
[44:20] come knowledge of the son of god unto
[44:23] the statue of the measure of the
[44:26] fullness of christ
[44:28] so in other words at the end of it all
[44:29] we become one we become
[44:33] in christ we come we have the each one
[44:35] have our
[44:36] measure in christ they have no big you
[44:38] and little knees have great swivels
[44:40] it has small servants or whatever it is
[44:42] it doesn't have that
[44:43] it have us one in christ jesus i could
[44:46] even go deeper there's neither male or
[44:49] but all one in christ jesus and you
[44:51] could you could push that dog inside
[44:53] that ear
[44:53] that's how deep it comes there is
[44:55] neither june or gentile
[44:56] because the cross reconciled boat
[44:59] hallelujah so even though the jews were
[45:00] once
[45:01] the people of god the the cross make a
[45:03] bridge you know to join together
[45:05] because we they only we only get access
[45:08] because they were blinded
[45:09] it's not because we were righteous it's
[45:11] not because we were so special it's only
[45:12] because they were blinded to give us
[45:14] opportunity
[45:15] so that is why they will be effectively
[45:17] grafted back in
[45:18] when they call come so we as gentiles
[45:21] have a
[45:21] right to give god praise for his grace
[45:24] and to worship him
[45:25] and i think i will get that just now to
[45:27] show you when god too in a way
[45:29] from the jews to the gentiles in the
[45:31] book of acts and we're going to get to
[45:33] that
[45:34] so i trust tonight that this was helpful
[45:36] to you as i said
[45:37] you're having a conversation and um i
[45:39] what i could
[45:40] say here now and and um you know i might
[45:43] be able to preach
[45:44] a pulpit but i could talk it with you as
[45:46] such so when
[45:48] god started to write about the church of
[45:49] ephesus and begin to tell them in
[45:51] chapter 2 of revelation these things
[45:53] said he that who let
[45:54] the seven stars in his right hand who
[45:56] walk it in the midst of the seventh rule
[45:57] and candle six
[45:58] verse two reverse chapter two i know
[46:01] that works
[46:02] and i labor and my patience maybe if
[46:04] everybody can find it generous
[46:06] revelations up to two we just want to
[46:08] read that quickly uh we're gonna read
[46:10] from
[46:10] verse two here i know thy works and thy
[46:13] labor
[46:14] and thy patience and how though cannot
[46:17] bear them which are evil and those tried
[46:20] them which see their apostles and
[46:23] are not and has found them liars
[46:26] and as born and as patients
[46:29] and for my name's sake i have labored
[46:31] and has not fainted nevertheless
[46:33] i have someone against thee because thou
[46:35] has left
[46:36] thy first love remember therefore from
[46:39] whence thou had fallen
[46:40] and repent and do the first works
[46:43] or else i would come into the quickly
[46:46] and remove the
[46:47] candlestick out of his place except or
[46:49] repent but this
[46:51] dollhouse that hates the deeds of of the
[46:54] nicolaitans
[46:55] which i also hate either an ear
[46:58] that i'm here or spiritually in churches
[47:00] now
[47:01] now now i want you to notice that they
[47:03] had labor they had patience that works
[47:06] they tried them who said they were
[47:07] apostles and brother branham said
[47:09] that how they manage that they were
[47:10] saying that you're not seeing what
[47:13] paul said that's how you're managing
[47:15] that
[47:16] yeah yeah you're preaching yeah yeah
[47:18] you're being pulpit you have any
[47:20] congregation but you're not staying with
[47:21] policy
[47:21] that your own doctrine by your own
[47:23] teaching we call paul
[47:25] and we said it last time he said take
[47:27] heed to yourselves and to all the flock
[47:29] over which the holy ghost had made you
[47:30] overseers defeat the church of god
[47:33] which had purchased with his own blood
[47:35] this is from second timothy 4
[47:37] and he was saying to them for i know
[47:40] this that after my departing
[47:42] shall grievous wolves entering among you
[47:45] now these grievous wills
[47:46] have suit and tire they do have hairy
[47:50] and
[47:50] scary-looking mulch and suffer this
[47:52] grievous rules
[47:53] is men hood and bible grievous worlds
[47:56] entering among you
[47:57] not sparingly flock also of your own
[48:01] selves to rise outside people
[48:02] but among your own people shall men
[48:04] arise speaking for perverse things
[48:07] to draw object to draw away disciples
[48:10] after them
[48:12] and then we read the scripture from 2nd
[48:14] corinthians 3 5
[48:15] examine yourself whether he be in the
[48:18] fate
[48:19] prove your own self so it's not a matter
[48:22] of coming to church now
[48:23] it's a matter taking your word as a
[48:24] applied mirror to examine yourself
[48:27] and the amplified says examine and test
[48:30] and evaluate your own selves to see
[48:33] whether you're holding to your feet
[48:35] and showing the proper fruits by it
[48:39] so it's not a matter of i'm in church no
[48:42] what kind of fruit are you buried
[48:43] i'm in church what kind of life are you
[48:45] living i'm in church
[48:46] or you acting how are you operating so
[48:49] it's a little more than
[48:51] i'm in church that is not even i'm not
[48:53] imagining
[48:54] it's not imaginary these innovation
[48:56] groups and churches are what
[48:57] they intend to stay here they're not
[48:59] they haven't for them is down here
[49:01] we go into a place we have a high
[49:02] calling to leave here
[49:05] you you follow i'm saying and that is
[49:06] why we are called to this
[49:08] rapture and faith so let's continue now
[49:11] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[49:12] hallelujah
[49:14] okay so
[49:18] we know exactly from the word which was
[49:21] recorded by the holy spirit from the
[49:23] first
[49:23] original church was founded and how god
[49:26] manifested himself in her
[49:28] the word can't change or be changed
[49:31] because the word is god
[49:33] and if there's one thing that the
[49:35] lessons and the bible studies have
[49:36] brought
[49:37] is that the word is god the church
[49:40] really is the devil and
[49:41] the church really is something that is a
[49:43] perversion
[49:44] but the word is god the word
[49:48] from elijah was god
[49:51] so whatever elijah speak it has to come
[49:53] to pass i want you to see
[49:55] the weight of prophetic utterance and
[49:57] why we are so blessed
[49:59] to have a 20th century prophet that god
[50:02] sentenced last year
[50:03] to turn our hearts back to the fate of
[50:04] defense we are tremendously blessed
[50:07] i i mean i wouldn't want the ministry if
[50:10] i didn't have a prophet message
[50:12] it doesn't make sense to me because the
[50:14] bible is a seed book
[50:16] he'll come in and the book being
[50:18] unsealed
[50:19] give us access rights understand this
[50:23] the code or the fingerprint or the fate
[50:26] to access the rights of god is only for
[50:30] that bride
[50:32] the nominations and the rest of the
[50:34] church can't access it
[50:36] because only the mighty angel came
[50:37] nobody book open to reveal the names
[50:40] that's how we get called bringing a call
[50:42] from baptists on mesut
[50:43] we get called from the angel with the
[50:45] open book
[50:46] is the open book message that called you
[50:49] and i
[50:50] and that's why we are brethren we are
[50:52] called by our message
[50:53] you will be tired you may be wary you
[50:56] may belong to benjamin tribe
[50:57] or or or some other tribe is uh
[51:01] julia tribe whoever try to belong to but
[51:03] we are family
[51:05] family of god that's what it's about god
[51:08] want to have a restored church
[51:10] somebody say restored back there restore
[51:13] church
[51:14] don't restore church you have to restore
[51:15] you because the church is he called out
[51:18] so you who make up the church he has to
[51:20] restore you he's not trying to replace
[51:22] you
[51:23] i might get that he's going to correct
[51:25] you
[51:27] however you are you could be contrary as
[51:29] ever and some of you
[51:30] you know yourself i'd rather call you
[51:32] your problems
[51:34] but i'm saying he called you and that's
[51:37] that enjoy understand he called
[51:40] philip he called andrew he called the
[51:42] tax collector
[51:44] hey tax collector you know it's too good
[51:46] too cheap where they got
[51:48] one call bring your taxes and different
[51:50] things like that cass collector wasn't a
[51:52] nice man
[51:53] but guess what he he deliberately called
[51:55] one because one of them was a
[51:56] name in the book and that fellow wasn't
[51:58] making jokes in taxi
[52:00] next minute he's in church he's brethren
[52:02] and you know he squeezed it last week
[52:04] i know this week in church and he had to
[52:07] turn around and shake his hands god
[52:08] bless you my brother
[52:09] did jesus arrange all of that that issue
[52:11] is among themselves because they were
[52:12] human just like us
[52:14] we have issues in families issues and
[52:16] marriages issues and homes issues in
[52:18] business issues all wrong that's all it
[52:20] is it is what it is
[52:22] hallelujah but guess what a change was
[52:25] coming
[52:26] and that change has come from the inside
[52:28] as human beings we see it in america
[52:30] we see the management we see them you
[52:31] know people deal with things and deal
[52:33] with issues
[52:34] there's problems in america because
[52:37] there's
[52:37] issues in leadership and character in
[52:40] america
[52:40] and around the world there are issues in
[52:42] churches their issues and homes and
[52:44] lives and marriages and everything else
[52:45] not issues
[52:46] but part of that have to do with
[52:48] internal stuff and the internal stuff
[52:50] reflect
[52:51] on how we manage or we deal with
[52:53] challenges or we deal with issues
[52:55] and that where jesus was so great he
[52:58] knew judas was judas
[52:59] the first time judas come in the church
[53:01] and say hallelujah glory i want to get
[53:03] baptized
[53:04] jesus knew who he was from he started
[53:06] jesus didn't know get information about
[53:08] judas
[53:08] he knew him and guess what he treats him
[53:10] like brethren
[53:12] even when he was a betrayed he said
[53:14] whatever don't do is do quickly
[53:15] all them brothers talk he gonna get more
[53:17] bread he called for he going for some
[53:19] more wine or something like
[53:21] jesus never and that's the maturity that
[53:23] was there
[53:24] because that's the man to betray him who
[53:26] is he gonna use peter
[53:28] peter hardly named but there's a man to
[53:30] be trained
[53:31] so that man was part of the package that
[53:33] god already
[53:34] and this is life so you can't go and say
[53:37] judas
[53:38] and you're that in the country no leave
[53:40] you that's alone had his part to play
[53:42] peter have his part to pray and guess
[53:43] what everybody have a part
[53:45] what your burden should be lord what is
[53:48] my part
[53:49] the pastor talked about revival if i
[53:51] haven't had to stop me oh
[53:52] oh god cleanse my heart lord push me
[53:55] cleanse me
[53:56] rearrange me inspire me this is what you
[53:59] have to see what is my call
[54:01] you get a burden every service has been
[54:04] responsibility
[54:05] every permitting is a responsibility
[54:07] every bible study is a responsibility
[54:09] you think it's not just easy for but
[54:11] he's like to come and just share stuff
[54:12] like that
[54:13] it's a commitment it's a responsibility
[54:15] it's a burden to pack
[54:17] to share and this is more even more
[54:19] difficult because we're not really
[54:21] seeing you in reality we see you yes
[54:23] here but you know we know your dear
[54:25] and all that connection and social uh
[54:28] thing like that
[54:28] is not dear so it makes it even more
[54:30] difficult and we have to go on
[54:32] here it is i'm preaching on sunday
[54:34] morning as 10 people there
[54:37] ten people there and i want to run out
[54:38] of church five ten people
[54:41] and sometimes it sounds like it's crazy
[54:43] like i see but anthony's singing
[54:45] about he's cutting the music i'm
[54:46] thinking like
[54:49] i say lord have mercy see this man
[54:52] caught up
[54:53] caught up as if the people right there
[54:55] but guess what
[54:56] angels are already there hallelujah
[55:00] we have we have heavenly hosts all
[55:02] around but i'm saying
[55:04] this is what makes it so real it's a joy
[55:07] it's a joy to serve the lord it's a joy
[55:09] to be and it's always a joy for me to
[55:11] look back and see
[55:12] like what brought us from and where we
[55:14] are now and where are we going on to
[55:16] the challenge i'm seeing now is how much
[55:18] we're going to press
[55:20] and strain towards what is before us
[55:24] not just press but strain people do like
[55:26] to stream
[55:27] they want to reach their hand and they
[55:29] get it right there right there they wish
[55:31] to plum the apples everything right
[55:32] there
[55:33] and fake everything that's right let's
[55:34] let's pick it right they should come
[55:36] down to them
[55:37] like i said when people go price smart
[55:39] if they give them a chance to drive
[55:40] straight into the price of the car
[55:42] they want the drive straight in the
[55:43] private car they don't want the park and
[55:45] walk
[55:46] everything must come easy everything
[55:48] will become smooth
[55:50] this this is how life is but that is not
[55:53] how
[55:53] it really is when you see what you're
[55:56] supposed to possess
[55:58] you press i know the
[56:02] something that i read someday but the
[56:03] brahman says
[56:05] when the spirit falls the mark of the
[56:08] beast
[56:09] comes out also that is a confirmation
[56:11] his spirit must fall
[56:13] if you have a mark that the beast it
[56:14] must have a marking of god
[56:16] how could god send down the mark and the
[56:19] the mark of the beast and there's no
[56:21] mark of god even the
[56:23] the income writer was said mark them
[56:26] first
[56:27] before you take the rest so i am saying
[56:30] to you
[56:31] the spirit fallen that that other
[56:33] problem you know is what is falling on
[56:37] so so don't worry about the spirit
[56:38] falling you're going unfold
[56:40] and you're going to flip things upside
[56:41] down into her and around the world his
[56:44] spirit
[56:44] will not do that remember we're in
[56:46] charge of that
[56:47] not me not the church it's god
[56:51] when the day of pentecost was fully come
[56:54] oh glory to god
[56:55] they win one mind and one accord and
[56:58] then something broke
[56:59] so man is not in charge of the spirit
[57:01] god is a man in charge of delivering the
[57:03] word
[57:04] delivering message given a word man can
[57:07] do
[57:08] that but the operation of the spirit
[57:10] that belongs to god
[57:12] and that is what we are here for tonight
[57:14] to get the conductor of the word
[57:16] to get it inside your heart inside your
[57:18] life that when that spirit come
[57:20] that touch don't hit you it could flow
[57:22] through you
[57:23] no hindrance nothing stop on the floor
[57:25] of god in your life
[57:26] no sin no unbelief no negativity
[57:30] just just a flow of god flow into your
[57:32] life this is what that is about
[57:34] oh blessed be the name of the lord let's
[57:36] continue oh praise god
[57:39] so watch
[57:42] thus the church that was at pentecost is
[57:44] the standard
[57:46] that is the pattern there is no
[57:49] other pattern no matter what the
[57:52] scholars say
[57:53] god has not changed that pattern
[57:57] what god did at pentecost he has to keep
[58:00] on doing
[58:01] until the church each close as long as
[58:05] men are being called and sent forth with
[58:08] the word of life
[58:09] there is a there is an apostolic age
[58:12] going on
[58:13] secondly they refer to an age of
[58:15] manifested holy ghost power
[58:17] as being over since the bible has been
[58:19] completed that is untrue there is not
[58:22] even one scripture that suggests
[58:25] but may conclusively state otherwise
[58:27] here is our proof
[58:29] acts 2 38 then peter said unto them
[58:31] repent and be baptized every one of you
[58:33] in the name of jesus christ for
[58:34] remission of your sins
[58:35] and you shall receive the gift of the
[58:37] holy ghost from as the promises unto you
[58:40] and to your children and to them that
[58:42] are far off
[58:43] even as many as the lord our god shall
[58:45] call
[58:46] the promise of power here we go which
[58:49] with which the
[58:50] apostles were endued at pentecost is to
[58:53] you
[58:53] the jews and to your children the jews
[58:57] and to all that are far off the gentiles
[59:00] and to as many
[59:01] as the lord our god shall call o jew
[59:04] and gentile until he stops calling
[59:08] the pentecostal message and power
[59:11] will not cease oh glory to god
[59:14] what the church had at pentecost here we
[59:16] go listen it's a
[59:18] inalienable right originally
[59:21] she had the pure word of god she had the
[59:23] power of the spirit
[59:25] manifested in diverse gifts and wonders
[59:28] and gift of the holy ghost so what they
[59:30] had at pentecost
[59:32] was the rights of the believers the
[59:35] rights so here is
[59:38] if you must say it differently
[59:42] you must crush that sin barrier or that
[59:46] one belief
[59:46] or that lack of fit i will see that lack
[59:49] of faith
[59:50] in order to see this as your right
[59:55] we feel we fail we you know we did all
[59:57] kind of stuff and things like that
[59:59] and then if you don't get that corrected
[1:00:02] or get it right repent and get the blood
[1:00:05] to cleanse you and everything else
[1:00:07] you'll find yourself short on the fee to
[1:00:09] believe this is yours
[1:00:11] so you know it's right you know that
[1:00:13] we're supposed to have but the fate
[1:00:15] because you remember
[1:00:16] the currency of god's fate not
[1:00:19] your tears not not your old not your
[1:00:23] agree here
[1:00:23] and you're feeling what feasts are you
[1:00:25] feminine you know if you're sorry you
[1:00:26] look like look
[1:00:27] you know no no it doesn't work so the
[1:00:30] realm that
[1:00:31] that the spirit is in to operate it
[1:00:33] responds to
[1:00:34] faith and you don't even have to be a
[1:00:37] christian to have their feet
[1:00:38] because these are people who came to the
[1:00:40] banner meetings and it was even
[1:00:42] christians
[1:00:42] they just believe they come for the
[1:00:44] daughter they come for the healing
[1:00:46] the woman who came to jesus and said my
[1:00:47] daughter is vex the devil she wasn't a
[1:00:49] christian she wasn't a believer the men
[1:00:51] would tear up the roof and
[1:00:52] let down the friend with the policy and
[1:00:54] whatnot he wasn't believers they just
[1:00:56] came because they had a need
[1:00:58] in need the woman with the blood issue
[1:01:00] she came not because she was a believer
[1:01:02] she came because she had a need
[1:01:03] and she had faith to believe that if she
[1:01:05] touched the hem of his garment she could
[1:01:07] be made whole
[1:01:08] so the thing about it you could be a
[1:01:10] sinner here tonight you could be
[1:01:11] in an accident tonight you could be
[1:01:13] whatever condition you're in tonight and
[1:01:15] have a need
[1:01:16] and because you have a need god could
[1:01:17] come and listen to your need because you
[1:01:19] have faith
[1:01:20] in asking for the
[1:01:23] supply your needs and god can come and
[1:01:25] honor that fate
[1:01:26] that is what is all about when the woman
[1:01:28] had the dead baby and they asked her is
[1:01:30] all well
[1:01:30] she hustling hustling hustling speeding
[1:01:32] down the track and she said oh all his
[1:01:34] wealth man with that smile all his men
[1:01:36] aren't she going onto elijah because she
[1:01:38] tell herself this man
[1:01:40] would tell me this i haven't had a child
[1:01:41] i couldn't have children she blessed me
[1:01:43] and whatnot this man had to have
[1:01:44] resolution for that i'm going back to
[1:01:45] this house
[1:01:46] he sourced any blessing he saw us when
[1:01:48] he stopped all this thing he that begin
[1:01:50] he could work and you is able to
[1:01:51] complete it
[1:01:52] into the end you're going back to this
[1:01:53] house so when when you see it like that
[1:01:57] then you could push them the confidence
[1:01:59] you have in god
[1:02:00] the confidence you have any word and
[1:02:02] then you could get what you have
[1:02:03] you know this is what this is about
[1:02:05] applied christianity husband love your
[1:02:07] wife we aren't reaching there yet
[1:02:09] but i'm saying in ephesians itself the
[1:02:11] target the goal
[1:02:12] have applied christianity mystery
[1:02:14] between christ for this course shall a
[1:02:16] man leave his mother and father
[1:02:17] cleave on to his wife husband of your
[1:02:19] wife wife will be your husband
[1:02:21] children will be your parents and so on
[1:02:23] put on your armor of god
[1:02:24] get get get get blowed up and so on like
[1:02:27] that all of that is in ephesians
[1:02:28] apply christianity not just before the
[1:02:30] function of the world not just your seal
[1:02:32] the day of promise and whatever the
[1:02:34] promise of the holy ghost all these
[1:02:35] things inside of there
[1:02:36] and this is where we had to get to not
[1:02:38] the informational part
[1:02:40] but the applied part i am concerned
[1:02:42] about the applied path
[1:02:44] that we present towards the mark
[1:02:46] yesterday back home
[1:02:47] and you know um and just letting things
[1:02:49] go and

[1:03:31] show these signs shall follow them i
[1:03:33] believe not even the ministers

[1:03:41] that you don't need money for that when

[1:03:44] you have no money without money without
[1:03:45] price the salvation
[1:03:47] is free it's the blood of jesus by
[1:03:49] giving the opportunity to have access
[1:03:51] right
[1:03:51] your sanctification glory is evidence
[1:03:54] that your name is on the book
[1:03:55] on you tonight glory let me jump up one
[1:03:58] more year tonight
[1:03:59] it's not your intuition your
[1:04:02] sanctification

[1:04:06] book
[1:04:06] if your name is in the book more than
[1:04:09] jordan even hallelujah you'll be
[1:04:10] sanctified because sanctification is the
[1:04:12] groundwork
[1:04:14] and and and for the revival to break oh
[1:04:16] glory to god
[1:04:17] in this evil age yes you choose a bride
[1:04:20] that's going to be
[1:04:21] cleansed and washed by the washing of
[1:04:23] water by the wood
[1:04:24] why because you have a high college
[1:04:27] shout out high calling
[1:04:28] hallelujah listen you call her any prime
[1:04:30] minister
[1:04:32] think about it they're just like
[1:04:33] election and they stand up there and
[1:04:34] they'll go and talk and talk
[1:04:36] and get votes and whatnot you can't
[1:04:37] handle that you have a
[1:04:39] high call in christ jesus think about it
[1:04:42] a high call
[1:04:44] you say prime minister to get escorts
[1:04:46] and police courts and blue lights and
[1:04:47] everything else
[1:04:48] in front of him and everything else
[1:04:49] right because of your high calling
[1:04:52] you have been under protection you have
[1:04:55] angelic assistance
[1:04:57] you have all you have had them around
[1:04:58] you you're not seeing them
[1:05:00] you're not conscious of them but they
[1:05:02] are there because of who you are
[1:05:04] do you think anything in the very mary
[1:05:06] some big big cat coming down
[1:05:08] some barrel rule of some some some
[1:05:10] chariot and come and
[1:05:11] tree don't hit mary and married her
[1:05:13] messiah forget it
[1:05:15] that brother stopped before then shut
[1:05:17] down nothing could stop mary
[1:05:20] nothing couldn't stop him listening
[1:05:22] somehow to stop zechariah because
[1:05:23] unbelief make him make him get dumb
[1:05:26] because god tell him
[1:05:27] is why god have a son and everything
[1:05:28] else but unbelief taken
[1:05:30] god said what you need gabriel tell him
[1:05:33] you will be dumb until this thing
[1:05:34] manifests
[1:05:34] then you go speak oh hallelujah
[1:05:38] so god some people might just have to be
[1:05:39] done until the manifestation come
[1:05:41] because god's saying all these things
[1:05:42] that is prophesied
[1:05:44] it can't fail oh hallelujah i feel this
[1:05:46] heart tonight feel good tonight
[1:05:48] oh praise the name of the lord but isaac
[1:05:51] had to help me finish him
[1:05:52] oh glory hallelujah please
[1:05:56] you see there's different things that we
[1:05:58] have to be doing so but imam was saying
[1:06:00] here now you read the script of hebrews
[1:06:01] 2 wonderful and this is serious
[1:06:05] therefore therefore we ought to give
[1:06:08] the more earnest heed to the things
[1:06:12] which we have heard least at any time
[1:06:15] we should let them slip so just thinking
[1:06:18] about the sharpness
[1:06:20] and your ability to listen with a keen
[1:06:23] air because you don't want to slip on
[1:06:25] these things for if the word spoken by
[1:06:27] angel was steadfast
[1:06:29] and every transgression and disobedience
[1:06:33] to the word
[1:06:34] receive a just recompense of reward
[1:06:37] how shall we escape if we neglect so
[1:06:40] great salvation
[1:06:42] which at the first began to be spoken by
[1:06:43] the lord
[1:06:45] and was confirmed unto us by them that
[1:06:47] heard him
[1:06:48] god bearing them witness both with signs
[1:06:51] and wonders
[1:06:52] and with diverse miracles and gifts of
[1:06:54] the holy ghost according to his own will
[1:06:56] that original church was not organized
[1:07:00] by men it was led by the holy ghost
[1:07:03] it wasn't very big it was hated and
[1:07:06] despised
[1:07:07] it was oppressed it was persecuted unto
[1:07:10] death
[1:07:11] but it was true to god it stayed
[1:07:14] with the original wood pattern that
[1:07:18] is the original church it's steered
[1:07:21] with the wood pattern no
[1:07:24] um we we sometimes think okay we're
[1:07:27] living in modern times
[1:07:29] modern times but but listen to these
[1:07:32] words in luke 17
[1:07:33] as it was in days and noah so shall it
[1:07:35] be in the days
[1:07:36] of the son of man so it's not just me
[1:07:40] living in modern times
[1:07:42] the spirit that was back there is the
[1:07:44] same spirit
[1:07:46] that is now here at the spirit level
[1:07:49] is the same spirit the same spirit that
[1:07:52] was in sodom settlement and burn and so
[1:07:54] on but you see the spirits that was in
[1:07:56] southern is what come back here now
[1:07:58] and like we're talking about um the
[1:08:01] whole
[1:08:02] spirit of the coming of the lord the
[1:08:03] spirit of judgment all of that have to
[1:08:05] come upon the people
[1:08:06] ready for the atomic ready for judgement
[1:08:10] and another the spirit of god they call
[1:08:12] upon you and i ready for revival
[1:08:14] ready for your pouring ready for
[1:08:16] breakthrough
[1:08:17] his wife had made herself ready his wife
[1:08:21] had made his head let us think it his
[1:08:23] wife had made herself ready
[1:08:25] do you know that this whole corner virus
[1:08:29] will bring the bride of christ around
[1:08:31] the world closer to god and closer in
[1:08:33] his word
[1:08:34] do you know god had arranged this that
[1:08:36] we could have this bible session
[1:08:38] this bible session this was not going to
[1:08:40] be outside of this situation
[1:08:42] almighty god designed all of this not
[1:08:45] for us to backslide
[1:08:46] and for us to get weaker and for us to
[1:08:48] get lackadaisical
[1:08:50] also get thoughtful for us to strain and
[1:08:52] press
[1:08:53] to see the promises is just as real and
[1:08:55] this is a rehearsal of what is to come
[1:08:58] at the demonic level at the political
[1:09:00] level
[1:09:01] what we talk about the threefold court
[1:09:03] of satan political
[1:09:04] religious and demonic a three-fold chord
[1:09:08] to come against the church let me say it
[1:09:10] again
[1:09:11] the threefold chord that will come on
[1:09:13] against the church
[1:09:14] political religious and demonic
[1:09:18] this is a small sample of that with the
[1:09:20] government
[1:09:21] giving instructions as to what to do and
[1:09:23] how long to do it
[1:09:25] so the government say one hour service
[1:09:27] and we can tell the government no
[1:09:29] because that's his instructions you
[1:09:31] follow what i'm saying
[1:09:32] no they can't tell us what to preach
[1:09:34] that that coming is not only
[1:09:36] they put pressure on the system right
[1:09:38] now they can't say nothing much
[1:09:39] you see when you power come let me let
[1:09:42] me share this with you now
[1:09:43] if the power of god struck the church of
[1:09:44] god and and and quran
[1:09:47] disappear yeah just blue
[1:09:51] that's crazy right but you know what
[1:09:53] going on
[1:09:55] they will say the power is in church and
[1:09:57] sickness have not no sickness because
[1:09:59] italian
[1:10:00] walking blind seeing that that's
[1:10:02] a holy thing
[1:10:04] that is where the satan gets mad because
[1:10:06] he doesn't want
[1:10:08] a reproduction of the original green
[1:10:11] that is what brother baron came to me a
[1:10:14] reproduction of you no no modern thing
[1:10:16] well
[1:10:16] you know saints you know by us this is
[1:10:18] how we just operate
[1:10:20] and um we've seen it so you see what
[1:10:22] does this talk
[1:10:23] is all that talk i'm not talking about
[1:10:25] that because we have plenty of that
[1:10:27] you know well bypass i've seen it so you
[1:10:29] know we see very different yeah you can
[1:10:30] see with whatever glass is using
[1:10:32] you see this would be made manifest is
[1:10:35] i've heard
[1:10:36] but now i see this is the confirmation
[1:10:38] or the vindication
[1:10:39] or the manifestation is i know we see it
[1:10:42] so i just text
[1:10:43] and information like greek and fooling
[1:10:46] with romans and stuff something like
[1:10:47] that
[1:10:47] this is not that we're talking about
[1:10:49] this is the sons of god coming forth no
[1:10:51] but i'm using terminology the word born
[1:10:55] into manifestation that means
[1:10:59] there will be a fossil a second pole and
[1:11:01] a turple
[1:11:02] or let's say this way there'll be a lion
[1:11:04] there'll be a beer
[1:11:06] and there'll be a goliath the goliath
[1:11:08] will be the rule concentrations
[1:11:10] you go that will be when they press come
[1:11:12] down that goliath
[1:11:13] but we have to deal with the biannual
[1:11:14] island before the amigo line
[1:11:16] so there must be experiences that god
[1:11:18] has predestinated
[1:11:19] and ordained even now that will make you
[1:11:22] press
[1:11:23] that will make you push you know i'm
[1:11:26] seeing this
[1:11:27] precious virgin out there lovely saints
[1:11:29] out there
[1:11:30] nice believers over there but you know
[1:11:32] what they are covered by a wrong spirit
[1:11:36] they are naughty but evil spirits
[1:11:38] hateful jealous
[1:11:39] envy all kind of cuckoo things that
[1:11:42] pastors and ministers put on them
[1:11:44] i'm telling you the truth is spirits
[1:11:47] pour them in the way of dogs
[1:11:49] be aware of this beauty of that we are
[1:11:50] all kind of characters people preaching
[1:11:52] for contention and whatnot
[1:11:54] because this message is a message to
[1:11:55] bring us the love i'm going to wrap up
[1:11:59] this rebuke that god gave the ephesus
[1:12:01] group to church
[1:12:02] he said i i love your works i love this
[1:12:04] but one thing i i
[1:12:06] i rebuke i want to rebuke you for is if
[1:12:09] you love
[1:12:10] the left the love the performing the
[1:12:13] working
[1:12:14] the achieving the exposing them when
[1:12:16] error
[1:12:17] spirit of error false apostles false
[1:12:20] teachers
[1:12:21] message popes being busted but guess
[1:12:24] what
[1:12:25] this mark the first church had they had
[1:12:28] love
[1:12:29] they had love they had the bond of
[1:12:31] perfectness
[1:12:32] always in love with different not like
[1:12:35] not liking plenty
[1:12:36] like my brethren not that they had love
[1:12:39] genuine love we have to get back here
[1:12:44] to access that broadly kindness is just
[1:12:47] before that love love
[1:12:49] to access that you have to be able to
[1:12:51] forgive
[1:12:53] and i want to bring it tonight a little
[1:12:54] different not just forgive your brothers
[1:12:57] but to forgive yourself you have
[1:13:01] to be able to forgive to forgive even
[1:13:04] yourself
[1:13:05] because growing blood atones for you
[1:13:08] forgive for you you you you you talk
[1:13:11] about forgive this one i forgive that
[1:13:13] one have you forgiven yourself
[1:13:15] why are you still fighting up with your
[1:13:17] own self-condemnation
[1:13:18] because of your past let your past be
[1:13:21] your past tonight
[1:13:23] take the scriptures we read tonight
[1:13:24] forgetting the things that have passed
[1:13:26] i press to watch them
[1:13:30] listen righteousness is getting less and
[1:13:32] less paramount
[1:13:34] saw the moon blacked out and you put a
[1:13:35] little sliver of life to represent the
[1:13:37] bride
[1:13:38] it is getting darker and darker because
[1:13:40] isaiah prophesied gross darkness covered
[1:13:42] here
[1:13:44] even if you have what is it i can't
[1:13:47] light and and and and cover up like that
[1:13:51] soon
[1:13:51] yours is a little light you still have
[1:13:53] light
[1:13:54] i don't care how small your light is
[1:13:56] tonight it's still a light
[1:13:59] a light that could shine for your loved
[1:14:00] ones for your family
[1:14:03] for your neighbor whoever you meet the
[1:14:06] world is in gross darkness
[1:14:09] the world is deceived democracy
[1:14:13] america is a failed republic of field
[1:14:16] democracy
[1:14:17] democracy has failed communism has
[1:14:20] failed
[1:14:21] the the rulers of the it has failed
[1:14:25] this is what is showing up right now a
[1:14:27] failure all around
[1:14:28] and god brought it to that kingdom of
[1:14:31] the kingdom
[1:14:32] everyone coming inferior look at america
[1:14:36] look at the condition of america not
[1:14:38] even african-american not even any other
[1:14:40] condition
[1:14:41] look at the condition americans
[1:14:44] could that be so you know when the bomb
[1:14:47] said rome the bible said all will wander
[1:14:49] after you know
[1:14:50] they will wander after that and
[1:14:53] the bible talk about in her was the
[1:14:54] blood of the
[1:14:55] matters of jesus 68 million
[1:14:58] christians died during the dark ages let
[1:15:01] me repeat that again
[1:15:03] italia killed six million jews but 68
[1:15:08] million christians died during dark ages
[1:15:12] and these people was killing christians
[1:15:15] thinking between goddess service
[1:15:17] and if they go back in the bible jesus
[1:15:19] said he all will come when they will
[1:15:20] kill you
[1:15:21] thinking they're doing good
[1:15:24] i we should be grateful tonight
[1:15:28] for the love that he have expressed to
[1:15:29] us by sending us our message
[1:15:32] not because we have the message but
[1:15:34] because we see the need now to apply the
[1:15:36] message
[1:15:38] god will keep his word you have heard me
[1:15:40] say as i close
[1:15:42] many times the message world has not
[1:15:44] seen god's judgment
[1:15:47] they love the prophet they love the
[1:15:49] books they love the tapes they want to
[1:15:51] argue and fight
[1:15:52] and carry on but i've never seen the
[1:15:55] wrath of god
[1:15:56] the judgment of god when moses was told
[1:16:00] to speak to the rock and he took the rod
[1:16:03] and smite the rock
[1:16:05] water came out him because it was god's
[1:16:08] people
[1:16:10] god told moses specific instructions
[1:16:13] speak to the rock it'll bring forth
[1:16:15] water it's his people
[1:16:16] people need water moses was upset
[1:16:20] moses was angry and he smoked wrong
[1:16:23] god had pulled moses aside and talked to
[1:16:25] him about that
[1:16:26] he said you didn't glorify me apply for
[1:16:28] yourself now that's a different level
[1:16:30] together
[1:16:31] you don't go in that business between
[1:16:33] father and son
[1:16:34] god and prophet you know go inside of
[1:16:36] the air and argue on debate with that
[1:16:38] this is all god deal with this man when
[1:16:40] god talked about the brain and be more
[1:16:42] sincere
[1:16:43] we can't go and argue with that from our
[1:16:46] standpoint
[1:16:46] he's a prophet he's fine he's preaching
[1:16:48] word you have something that won his
[1:16:50] miracles
[1:16:50] from the father standpoint from god's
[1:16:52] standpoint
[1:16:53] he needs to be more sincere i think

[1:21:50] it was a
[1:21:51] really true true genuine blessing i
[1:21:53] really appreciate
[1:21:55] the word tonight he appreciate our
[1:21:56] pastor this evening
[1:21:58] amen and sharing from his heart is he
[1:22:01] he's a man of few words he's a preacher
[1:22:03] with few words so
[1:22:04] it's it's it's tough for those of you
[1:22:07] who've had the pleasure of
[1:22:08] getting to talk to him on the phone i
[1:22:11] always tell the church that um
[1:22:13] i've said it before sometimes that much
[1:22:15] recently as about a week or so ago
[1:22:18] i called him money he hung up on me
[1:22:20] before i get to
[1:22:26] you know so um but uh truly a blessing
[1:22:30] tonight and
[1:22:30] a real encouragement on that strain and
[1:22:33] i like the conversation about his train
[1:22:36] and um i would have said it before that
[1:22:39] most people underestimate the effort
[1:22:42] it takes to achieve anything you know
[1:22:46] we take it for granted um we
[1:22:50] we look at the situation and you know we
[1:22:53] say well it will be this amount of
[1:22:55] effort to get it done
[1:22:57] and many times i don't know if you ever
[1:22:58] found yourself you realize that you
[1:23:00] didn't factor certain things into the
[1:23:02] equation
[1:23:03] you know and then you end up recognizing
[1:23:05] well you know it'll be half an hour to
[1:23:07] get there and then you realize half an
[1:23:08] hour pass and you're not there
[1:23:09] whoever there is it's because you're
[1:23:11] underestimated
[1:23:13] what is the traffic you're
[1:23:14] underestimated a situation you didn't
[1:23:16] think about and and then
[1:23:18] when you confront the reality of it you
[1:23:20] recognize that if you are given a little
[1:23:22] more if you had done a little more
[1:23:24] if you had put more in place if you had
[1:23:27] more
[1:23:27] preparation in there it would have
[1:23:30] increased the
[1:23:31] probability the possibility of the final
[1:23:33] outcome
[1:23:34] you know and so too in the spiritual
[1:23:36] realm we find that
[1:23:38] most people underestimate you know what
[1:23:41] effort they have to do in their prayer
[1:23:42] life
[1:23:43] and to see you know they would come and
[1:23:45] speak about that strain that push
[1:23:48] um you know that that that the kingdom
[1:23:51] is preached and every man have to press
[1:23:53] into it
[1:23:53] and the reality is and you look at your
[1:23:55] room tonight you look at
[1:23:56] you know everyone connected tonight the
[1:23:58] kingdom is preached and every man press
[1:24:01] the reality is you know there there are
[1:24:04] quite a number of people here tonight
[1:24:05] and
[1:24:05] and there are people pressing on
[1:24:07] different levels you know
[1:24:09] and and i remember preaching the message
[1:24:12] have we done enough
[1:24:13] and it was sort of trying to put a line
[1:24:16] the sun so to speak
[1:24:17] that if the past mark is is 90
[1:24:22] you getting 89 percent is not enough
[1:24:25] so nobody is saying you're not pressing
[1:24:27] nobody is saying you're not doing
[1:24:29] but he just missed it by one mark
[1:24:31] because he passed mark was 90
[1:24:33] and in this great commission this great
[1:24:35] call that we are called to
[1:24:37] where the blood has to be on your door
[1:24:39] post
[1:24:41] you cannot have it you need to have it
[1:24:43] you know and and it's as a reminder and
[1:24:45] a challenge for us to go
[1:24:47] all the way so i really appreciate it
[1:24:48] tonight and i want to encourage the
[1:24:50] church to go all the way
[1:24:52] i want to challenge you know you to
[1:24:54] double your efforts
[1:24:55] you know there's there's there's
[1:24:57] something to be said about doing more
[1:24:59] there's something
[1:24:59] to be said about you know not taking it
[1:25:02] for granted
[1:25:03] there's something to be said about
[1:25:05] pushing
[1:25:06] to the limits you know um and
[1:25:09] that is what overcoming is because
[1:25:10] overcoming is is being able to go
[1:25:13] over whatever it is to be able to to go
[1:25:15] beyond
[1:25:16] the pressures because the pressures come
[1:25:18] the pressures will come
[1:25:19] and there's no promise in scripture that
[1:25:21] speaks of depression not coming
[1:25:23] and the pressure just disappearing you
[1:25:25] know the pressures are designed
[1:25:27] they have been selected for us they have
[1:25:29] been designed for us
[1:25:30] the trials have our name written on it
[1:25:34] whether you consider it fortunate or
[1:25:35] unfortunate you can't send these things
[1:25:37] back
[1:25:38] because they are for our perfection and
[1:25:40] it's the it's the bring out the best in
[1:25:41] us so
[1:25:42] and god knows exactly what aspect of our
[1:25:45] lives he need to put
[1:25:47] the right pressure on for us to change
[1:25:50] understand that what god is doing is for
[1:25:51] us to change
[1:25:52] um so if he sees some tempo in us that
[1:25:55] needs to be addressed
[1:25:57] he will send situations in us until we
[1:25:59] could pass that temper test he will send
[1:26:01] situations for us until we can
[1:26:03] pass the patient's test you know what
[1:26:05] said and and he said it tonight there's
[1:26:07] no
[1:26:08] school of of parenting there's no school
[1:26:11] of
[1:26:11] marriage there's no school there's no
[1:26:13] finish in school and
[1:26:15] you could study for this thing and and
[1:26:17] and the reality is life will still give
[1:26:19] you a curveball
[1:26:20] you know as prepared as you think you
[1:26:22] are in whatever situation
[1:26:24] you would see is is that is how life is
[1:26:27] but there are people who no matter what
[1:26:30] comes their way
[1:26:31] and i realize more than the knowledge
[1:26:34] more than ability is really about the
[1:26:36] attitude you know because if
[1:26:38] your attitude and you can see why the
[1:26:39] prophet would say the right mental
[1:26:41] attitude
[1:26:42] to any divine promise of god want to
[1:26:44] bring it to pass
[1:26:45] because there are people who don't have
[1:26:47] all the knowledge but because they have
[1:26:48] the right attitude to how they approach
[1:26:50] life they are successful there are
[1:26:52] people who don't have the
[1:26:54] they didn't grow up in the best home you
[1:26:55] know and you have people who grew up in
[1:26:57] a nice home
[1:26:57] and the attitude horrible you have
[1:26:59] people who who
[1:27:00] who have money and attitude horrible and
[1:27:03] when you see the
[1:27:04] end you see why god will say to david
[1:27:06] have you considered the
[1:27:07] end when you see the end of it you look
[1:27:10] and say but wait now was it all worth it
[1:27:11] so i want to challenge us tonight
[1:27:13] through this whole experience that has
[1:27:15] forced such a reflection
[1:27:17] in our way in our walk in our talk in
[1:27:19] our life in our deliberations
[1:27:21] and i would have said it months ago
[1:27:23] since as early as march
[1:27:24] and april and these earlier months this
[1:27:27] this this
[1:27:28] pseudo lockdown that we are still partly
[1:27:30] in and trying to come out of
[1:27:32] has been a great opportunity for you to
[1:27:35] make deposits into the bank of your life
[1:27:38] it is a great opportunity
[1:27:40] for you to to sharpen your skills
[1:27:42] sharpen your prayer life
[1:27:43] sharpen your your knowledge sharpen your
[1:27:46] experience take a time so that when you
[1:27:48] come out to this thing
[1:27:50] you'll come out strong we're not
[1:27:52] supposed to come on to this thing we
[1:27:53] can't know friends we're not supposed to
[1:27:54] come out of this thing
[1:27:55] wondering who we are this is a time for
[1:27:57] us to
[1:27:58] reflect and learn and study and say you
[1:28:00] know what i am a
[1:28:01] child of the king as brother of it said
[1:28:03] the catholic church have already
[1:28:04] hierarchies but in god's kingdom
[1:28:07] is just sons and daughters and these
[1:28:09] sons and daughters take up their
[1:28:10] spiritual ranks
[1:28:11] kings and priests dominion you know so
[1:28:14] i'm speaking
[1:28:15] to royalty tonight i'm encouraging
[1:28:17] royalty tonight and
[1:28:18] i want to encourage you that
[1:28:20] christianity
[1:28:21] christianity which is to be christ-like
[1:28:23] we're not talking about church here but
[1:28:25] christ like
[1:28:25] is really living for others you know and
[1:28:28] and most of us we are
[1:28:29] we are so we end up sometimes so selfish
[1:28:32] that we don't see that
[1:28:34] when jesus came it was not about him it
[1:28:36] was about others so i want to challenge
[1:28:38] you as well to extend yourself
[1:28:40] um as we are preparing to go back into
[1:28:43] the tabernacle
[1:28:44] for a restricted time so to speak this
[1:28:46] coming sunday
[1:28:47] um make it all come come on time come
[1:28:49] early make a
[1:28:50] just one hour service so make our effort
[1:28:53] come in time
[1:28:54] sanitize go through the process so that
[1:28:56] you know when we when
[1:28:57] when we come there we have the right
[1:28:58] attitude to get the most value but
[1:29:00] everyone was preaching last sunday
[1:29:02] and i'm sure you would have heard it we
[1:29:03] don't need a three-hour service we need
[1:29:05] a four-hour service
[1:29:06] we we take in the opportunity we get and
[1:29:09] we understand that the prophet said it
[1:29:10] takes
[1:29:11] five minutes in the presence of god to
[1:29:13] see the angel of the lord you need the
[1:29:16] the spiritual begin to work and heal and
[1:29:18] touch and seal and deliver and break
[1:29:20] chains so stay on your firing line let's
[1:29:22] just bow our heads
[1:29:23] for a word of prayer tonight well
[1:29:25] gracious heavenly father we thank you
[1:29:27] for your love for your mercy
[1:29:28] for your grace that is truly sufficient
[1:29:31] lord
[1:29:32] when we look back at the months and look
[1:29:35] back at
[1:29:36] there are so many different stories and
[1:29:38] different situations and
[1:29:39] there are so many things that we can
[1:29:41] hear and see there's so many
[1:29:43] so much negativity in there lord that
[1:29:45] when we could look at how you are taking
[1:29:47] us
[1:29:47] through we can truly say it's been you
[1:29:50] it's been you or
[1:29:51] guiding you directing you preserving us
[1:29:54] lord and
[1:29:55] lord we we are we are walking in your
[1:29:57] playbook as it were
[1:29:59] lord to see that you have ordered these
[1:30:01] steps as bit of it said
[1:30:03] had it not been for this situation as it
[1:30:05] were we wouldn't even be meeting like
[1:30:07] this on a tuesday night
[1:30:08] how you orchestrated this in such a way
[1:30:11] that you could
[1:30:12] bring reconciliation of your children
[1:30:15] back to
[1:30:15] the house of god as the father of the
[1:30:18] prodigal son was looking out
[1:30:20] to see when his son would come home
[1:30:22] because he had walked away
[1:30:23] thinking he had it all together not
[1:30:25] realizing that
[1:30:26] he was missing so much and when he was
[1:30:29] found himself in a place where he
[1:30:31] shouldn't be in he he
[1:30:33] he came to his senses as it were and
[1:30:34] began the journey back home and
[1:30:36] all of that was to bring healing to him
[1:30:38] bring healing to his father
[1:30:40] and to even bring help to to that older
[1:30:42] brother who didn't know what was locked
[1:30:44] up in him until the situation came to
[1:30:46] expose it
[1:30:47] and how we see this whole situation has
[1:30:49] created an uh
[1:30:50] a new normal in the natural but more
[1:30:52] than that a new normal in the spiritual
[1:30:54] and we thank you
[1:30:55] for this opportunity to have a
[1:30:57] conversation around your word to
[1:30:59] have a sharing of the heart and to have
[1:31:00] our pastor tonight to speak to us
[1:31:03] lord from the word of god from the
[1:31:05] scriptures from the
[1:31:06] the the ministry of this great elijah
[1:31:08] prophet that
[1:31:10] lord without this prophetic ministry we
[1:31:11] wouldn't even know how to go how to move
[1:31:13] how to operate but we could speak from
[1:31:14] an
[1:31:15] open book tonight and have clarity
[1:31:17] clarity of purpose clarity of
[1:31:19] direction clarity of how to move and how
