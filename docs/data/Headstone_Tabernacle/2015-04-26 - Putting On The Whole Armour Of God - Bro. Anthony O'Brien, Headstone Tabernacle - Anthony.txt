and sin require one penalty death small sin big sin mediumsized sin growing sin no sin sin sin and One requirement was required was debt and Jesus died to pay that price that you could go free everybody in here supposed to be able to go [Music] free Hallelujah all right you may be seated you sit down a minute I want to read the scripture for you say a few words and you're going to hear Minister come and preach you this morning Amen brother Anthony going to be ministering to you this morning bless brother Anthony we appreciate him amen Matthew 24 reads and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and the disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily i s to you there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat in the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us what shall these things be and what shall be a sign of thy coming and of the end of the world end of the world people live here like bosses like rulers like dictators and presidents and popes and pontiffs they live here as if they're here forever they live here as if are in charge but there was a major earthquake in Nepal and so far over 2,000 people are dead was huge it was big and you wouldn't want to be in that scenario where they are at right now they're not singing right now they can't go to church right now it's a disaster let me read on and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ shall deceive many first thing Jesus addressed was deception and he shall hear of wars and rumors of wars so what he saying here don't look for some man to come and say I am this and I that forget that am Wars rumors of wars see that he be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet na shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom there shall be famines pestilences earthquakes in diverse places all these things are the beginning of Sorrows Daniel talk about a time that never was since the world began all these things are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted kill you shall be hated of all nations from my name take and then many shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another so hate is a promise in this last day of behavior and attitude many false prophets shall arise shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and verse 14 verse 14 is where this thing is so potent and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world and then the end shall come may God bless his word could we give the Lord a shout of [Applause] Praise Hallelujah headstone Tabernacle headstone tab Facebook page two powerful quotes I want to bring back and if you haven't checked it out for a while check it out every day there's stuff there every day to you inspire your heart amen without any exceptions this is Brother brandham every son that cometh to God must first be tested tried child trained without exceptions so stop complaining every son that cometh to God must first be tested tried child trained amen next one you press in because there's coming a time when you will scream and cry to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it will be shut off from you press in so there is nothing really to tell us lay back stay back uh keep easy uh uh it will work out there is nothing easy is speaking that it says the kingdom is preached and Every Man Press their wing into it just two more from one in a million anyone who can explain anything you don't have to accept it anymore by faith it things that we cannot explain that we have to accept by faith we cannot explain God no man can explain God he is Sovereign he is Great and Mighty we just accept it because we know he is there and then by our faith and accepting it he brings the response back to us the baptism of the holy spirit so in response to your faith in God God give a response his answer is the Holy Ghost upon your life do you believe that do you receive that do you accept that and finally from the second com of the Lord he said let's pray blessed Heavenly Father tonight at the beginning of this revival as our time has

Bibles we'd like to turn um a portion of scriptures certain you want to greet the internet this morning and all those that may be hooked up on our online community bring greetings to you this morning in the name of Jesus Amen in whom we preach Ephesians chapter 6 we want to read from this is where we'll be getting our text this morning Ephesians chapter 6 reading from verse 10 familiar scripture but praying the Lord would uh blessed this morning in a special way you can also find from Mark 1 Peter 5 and um Romans chapter 13 okay but we'll read first from Ephesians chapter 6 Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 which says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that he may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins G about with truth having on the the breastplate of righteousness and your feet sh with the preparation uh with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all of the fiery uh all the fiery DTS of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God now reading down uh going down to 1 Peter chapter 8 now we'll read that scripture um 1 Peter chapter 5 sorry and verse 8 1 Peter 5 and verse 8 amen just that one scripture there it says be sober 1 Peter 5 chapter 8 uh chapter 5 and verse 8 sorry says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour and now turning over to ro Romans chapter 12 um we'll just read Romans chapter 13 sorry we'll read from 12 to the end before we pray amen Romans 13 from verse 12 uh uh from verse 12 says the night is far spent and the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wanness not in strife and envying but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof God a blessing's word let's bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we thank you this morning for the privilege to be gathered in your name father to be called your people and to be chosen by you it's such an honor this morning to walk into your courts Lord to give you praise and glory Lord father for what you have done for what you are doing this morning and for what you're about to do for us Lord there's no amount of words that we could say oh Lord father to give you praise this morning but from our hearts we say thank you Lord thank you for what you're doing this morning Father we pray your Holy Spirit Come for your people come before this message Lord father I pray go before me Lord I pray take every word father from from from my mouth Lord father Lord

the third phase granted almighty God we pray this special blessing this morning have your pray Eminence in Jesus name amen and amen you may have your seats hallelujah hallelujah praise God oh how many love the Lord this morning amen amen how many appreciate the Lord this morning amen amen hallelujah how many thank God for his presence in his presence we are strong in his presence we can overcome in his presence we could soak up Hallelujah all of the anointing and all of the strength that is needed in this battle in this war that we are in this morning hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah praise God so for my title uh I just have a title this morning it's everything it's my inspiration it's my subject it's my motivation this morning and that is putting on the whole armor of God Amen GL praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and I just wanted to highlight also um uh series of messages brother been preaching uh uh coming down to this even unto this day and uh such an inspiration they appreciate for over this morning amen hallelujah and um last week I believe he was speaking about Mo uh Moses yeah with the sculpture I think that's right and um it was such an inspiration to me and I'm an artist so I just see things a certain way and when he started to bring out that thought um it was just mindblowing to me what I began to think on it and he was talking about the sculpture and how God was cutting you down to the word only is that right and it opened up to me that what God was doing was really really something is really fine-tuning because a sculpture if he's doing a artist if he's doing a sculpture there are two different types of sculpturing there's one which is like additive sculpturing or like there's something called constructive sculpturing which is like using clay so you could take clay and put it together in that process if you something breaks off you could easily take clay put it back mold it and continue working but what the prophet was talking about with the sculpture that Michelangelo is working on is something called deconstructive sculpturing which is even harder because if a piece comes off that's not supposed to come off the entire thing is messed up and another thing is that your vision cannot change say Amen somebody am you can't wake up one morning with one vision and then after a year you say I think you should change this you know it's too late for that it done already started working the vision has to remain constant is that right and God has a way of being constant he don't change like we change God changes not so when he speaks something is perfect every time and when he has a vision for your life say Amen somebody it is perfect every time oh Hallelujah glory to God glory to God Amen so I just loved when begin to think about it because the first stage of the sculpture is when um you'll see if you're looking at the artist and he's now started he's got the rock it's all big and ugly and weird looking it has trees and dirt and everything on it so he has to cut out everything so he starts cutting crazy there's stuff flying all over the place you don't even know what's happening and but he has a vision he knows what's supposed to happen next right so this first part is all crazy it's wild there's things flying all over dust dirt everything the whole place is covered in everything that is not Moses isn't that right but then the second part come down to the fine tuning that is the part when it comes down to the honing now that's the part when the artist begins to take his time to bring out the vision oh Hal I believe you're getting it this morning sometimes you look at it for an hour two hours you think he's crazy and then he'll take his chisel his hammer run up ching ching ching stop and come back then 2 hours pass again then he goes up to ching ching ching comes back again what's he doing honing it shaping it a certain way because he can't afford to miss oh hallelujah hallelujah so what are you saying brother Anthony you are so precious you are so unique you are such a peculiar treasure to God that he can't afford to miss so he's taking his time this morning oh with this masterpiece because it's got to come out right oh Hallelujah and when God finish with us we are going to come out right oh remember this one thing Perfection takes time amen amen if you're looking to do uh once over sure you know 5 minutes that's fine you know do a little thing you know they'll be happy with that but when you're going for perfection when you're going for the horning the shaping the real nitty-gritty that takes time and sometimes we want God to do things for us right away we want God to start it right away start the work and he God standing for an hour two hours and when in moment you at least think not he runs up chisel chisel chisel then runs back oh hallelujah hallelujah but he's shaping you oh Hallelujah be confident this morning it's going to come out right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen it's God that's doing the work and it's going to come out right amen so we just trusting in the Lord this morning so I just appreciated that thought I just thought i' preface the message with that this morning amen but praise God I have a thought in my heart putting on the whole armor of God is that right so let's begin this morning so we in a war this morning is not and in this church and our inspiration we are Waring against inertia we are Waring against the normal beat of things we are no Waring against the hum drum Dr we are Waring against coming to church and going back home and doing the same old same old and expecting a Revival because that can't work amen if you're looking for Revival you can't come the way you've been coming you have to change change the way you move you have to change the way you operate you have to change the way you do things isn't that right and we are in a war this morning Hallelujah believe it or not we are in a war amen we have already had casualties of this war but we are pressing on this morning because we are looking for Perfection and the devil is not going to give you an inch you have to fight for every inch that you say you stand on you have to fight for it this morning if you claim anything in here this morning the devil is waiting for you on Monday morning to see if you're going to stand or if you're going to fall but I know my Bible tells me that when the enemy raises up like a flood the spirit of God will raise up a standard against him oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh the Lord is on our side this morning so don't you be ashamed don't you be dismayed because the same God that brought you out is the same God that's going to take you through oh Hallelujah we not putting our confidence in a man where there is no help but my Bible tells me we look to the hills from whence cometh our help our help come from the Lord the Lord which make heaven and earth oh hallelujah hallelujah he will not suffer thaty F to be moved oh oh Hallelujah is that right is that right the Lord that keepeth thee he will not Slumber he is not asleep this morning he is very much awake and he is looking at your attitude seeing whether you will fall or whether you will take your stand oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah GL I remember one time I was looking at I don't know if it's was a documentary or film or something it was about a football team and the football team was accustomed to a certain coach a certain level of training a certain way of doing things they had their own beat right and this one coach was hired for the job apparently the other one was demoted and there was some conflict because during that time it was racial segregation in the US and America and this African American coach came to take over the team and stuff like that so the other co uh coach who obviously was a white man he was very much um vexed of what transpired and there was little conflicts and so on but this African-American coach he came out and he began to tell the team listen the way you accustom doing things we're going to change that the way you're accustom training we're going to change that the way you normally approach the game we're going to change that you're going to change the way you run change the way you block change change the way you tackle change the way you think change the way you train change the way you run change the way you talk to me change the way you talk to your friends we're going to change the way we do things around here and he started to shake up the team he started to shake up the way they were doing things because they were accustomed with the white supremacy and he started to bring along a Brotherhood between black and white and after a while they were they were vexed with it but after a while they they started to come come into the training they started to come into their own they started to come into what he was trying to bring to them he had a vision of what this team was supposed to be like and little by little they began to form camaraderie they began to form bonds between one another so much so that they became unbreakable so much so that they became Unstoppable in that football season they won every single match that they ever set their foot on the field on oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and I'm saying this morning if we going to go for a 7th tunder Revival if we are going for Perfection we have to change the way we praise God we have to change the way we worship change the way you approach your service change the way you come change the way you dress forget about yourself concentrate on him and begin to worship him oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah change the way you approach this service this morning this is not an ordinary service God wants to speak to you this morning we are breaking out of inertia this morning we are breaking out of inactivity this morning get on fire this morning get on fire for God oh Hallelujah H Samson the Philistines are upon you hallelujah hallelujah amen amen hallelu we in a war this morning amen it's hard thought that's right come on now it's not for the faint of heart that's right if you want to go back home now is the chance to do it but once virtal power drops down we get into it there's no turning back hallelujah hallelujah there'll be one group that'll overcome and there'll be another group that won't overcome amen I don't about you this morning but I feel like overcoming Hallelujah because I didn't come all this way this morning to sit down in a Pew and just occupy space and just stick around in inertia no no no no no the word of God is here to propel us forward to motivate Us in the direction that God wants us to be in oh oh hallelujah hallelujah oh so welcome to PO camp this morning strap up your shoes this morning we're going for a run this morning this is not for the faint of Hearts oh hallelujah hallelujah they that wait upon the Lord shalling you their strength oh hallelujah hallelujah they that wait upon the Lord shall you KN their strength now don't get confused yes we have to wait on the Lord but in that waiting we're not lying around and say well where we waiting on God you know are you waiting on God yes are just going to hang around here and just wait no that's not the waiting we're talking about the waiting we're talking about on God is in expectation the waiting on God is in preparation because you can't get nothing from God unless you in the atmosphere for it unless you are prepared to receive what God has for you is that right is that right Abraham was under expectation for a son that's right he didn't just stick around and say well God going to give me a son he's going to give me a son wonderful it's a sun it's a bright and Morning Sun no that wasn't the expectation it was every morning Sarah how you feeling this morning hallu you feeling childish this morning you feeling like bringing forth a child this morning cuz it's going to happen you know he had that kind of talk he had that kind of atmosphere God even changed his name so every time he wake up in the morning and he say his own name his own name remind him of the promise every morning the father of Nations the father of children oh Hallelujah the father of the sons of God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah every time he say the name Abraham every time Sarah say the name Abraham to him she don't even know she anointing his own promise and every time a Abraham say Sarah she he don't even know he anointed her that promise to her they just speak in words but they being anointed being anointed and the devil might think we just speaking words this morning but no no no no no we are speaking your name this morning and we are anointing your promise anointing your seventh under promise to you you are going to bring forth praise God in your hour in your season oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah so we're in a battle this morning that battle is Raging this morning it's heavy this morning 200 100 million devils are waiting for you on Monday to see if you're going to make it oh Hallelujah Hal to see if you're going to stand to see if you're going to do what you said you was going to do on Sunday morning they're waiting to challenge you they are not playing games the devil does not want to hurt you understand this the devil does not want want to give you a cut or a sprain anchor that would be wonderful but the devil is not out to hurt you the devil wants to kill you he wants you dead that's right isn't that right he is killing with intent with malicious intent to cut you off your life support Hallelujah isn't that right amen not just physically dead but spiritually dead he wants you cut off Hallelujah isn't that right so that you can access the promises he want cut off he wants to break the atmosphere off of you he wants to get you in the natural so that you can't have faith for your son so that you can't have faith for your family so that you can't have faith for your daughter faith for your children faith for your house faith for your promises but the devil is a liar this morning because we are coming against him this morning with all that we've got this morning and what we've got is enough to destroy the Devil what we've got is the word of God this morning to Smite the enemy praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we're slowly building this morning in a war you cannot move as normal you cannot act as normal it is not business as usual in a war I think during the World War I or World War II uh time back there back in the 1930s and 40s people will go to the cinema and just before they would show the movies they would have this infomercial that comes up that says now remember now if you see a bomb duck roll and cover they were in a war they had to let the people know that it wasn't business as usual even though they were going to to the work and going to businesses and doing what they had to do during the day there was war situation going on Germany fighting England fighting America fighting this one fighting that one it was war they had to be reminded every day Hallelujah that if something was to take place it could change the state of things Al together Hallelujah anytime the Nazis could just be running in praise God and just start killing and sloting and maming and murdering people that's a war situation well this morning we are in a war situation we are in a spiritual war situation right now in this atmosphere in this church because the devil is not out there this morning the devil doesn't want those people out there he already got them but the devil this morning has on a shirt he has on a tie Hallelujah he's all dressed up and he is in church this morning he wants to destroy you this morning he wants to cut you off this morning from receiving your promises from God he wants to come into your mind and try to mess you up he has access to your mind but one thing the devil cannot interfere with the devil can not interfere with what is in your soul what is in your heart oh is is that right there's a seed of predestination in there there's a seed of adoption in there that the devil cannot interfere with so try as he may he can't touch your soul this morning try as he may he cannot destroy you this morning what is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ is getting ready to drop down the intelligence to show you what to do with the word [Applause] oh you're going to take the word and hand it there amen is that right do you need an example let's look at Job the Bible says that the sons of God came to offer sacrifice in the temple and who came along with them the devil as as I said he's in church so he came in church that morning and the holy God begin to have a conversation with the devil seeing as how he decided to come along and he asked the devil he said what are you doing here so Lucifer answered and said well I've been about tossing to and fro looking for mischief to cause looking for people to interfere with looking for families to distress looking for lives to destroy so God said well if that is the order of the day then have you considered this man so God open his pamphlet of of of names and begin to show Satan a certain somebody who Hallelujah who was alive at that time and his name was job he said have you considered this my servant job and the devil said listen I I I I looked at him sure I had my eyes on him I was thinking about him but the reason why I couldn't touch him now don't get don't miss this now this is great the reason why I couldn't touch him is because you have a hedge around him amen the reason why I couldn't touch him is because you have a protection barrier around him the reason why I couldn't touch him at all is because you have a fence around him you see when you stand for God he'll stand for you when you are God's child a nothing can touch you the devil has to ask for permission oh Hallelujah I'll say it again because you didn't get that that went over your head the devil has to ask for permission to interfere with Jo because of who Jo [Applause] was do you know who you are this morning you are the sons of God this morning ain't no devil going to hurt you ain't no devil going to touch you Jesus told his disciples not a hair on your head will be interfered with oh the Lord will go with you wherever confirming in the word signs wonders and [Music] miracles [Applause] Hallelujah devil said you have a hedge around him I can't get to him every time I go by the house Angel barrier can't touch you every time I go by the house it's blood all over the door post blood all over yeah you think job know that job just going about his daily routine worshiping in the temple praising God he don't even know how much Angels around the house around his children around his family oh Hallelujah we are in a war ladies and gentlemen God ain't taking no Chances with his children oh [Applause] Hallelujah amen amen hallelujah the Lord encamped round about them that fear Him that's the word amen amen so God said here what I'm going to do see as how I've got a hedge I know I've got a hedge it's a pretty big hedge all right fine we'll move the Hedge I'm going to put job on the test Hallelujah I'm going to put job on a special exam because he's my son and I know what I put inside of him you see because the devil was looking at all of the Hedge and thinking that that is what have job so special so he tell God he say listen this is a challenge this is a battle here's what's going to happen we're going to have a special contest I am going to try him and we're going to see if we can make him curse you to your face that was a challenge isn't that right so God said fine go ahead I'm taking down the hedge hedge gone yeah devil get his chance now God called back his Angel he say come come come we're going to do something special today this is a different day Al together today my son gets adoption trial today my son is going to another place today my son is going to be elevated to another level he doesn't know it yet he's just going about the daily routine doing what he thinks is normal and then all of a sudden here come the devil this happened that happened all at once the amount of things happened to job all at once it was crazy I don't even know if if I could survive that kind of trial you know his children dead one time and then his flux and this and that and it's just crazy one servant came and said this happened another servant came and said this happened said this happened said this happened all at once it almost like that day his car broke down his house burned down this one died just think about it it's like a trial multiply by 10 and what did job do shave his head and begin to worship God already the attitude in Jo begin to display God's attributes God begin to smile devil say all right round one let's see what happened now and God and the trials begin to increase isn't that right and this begin to happen that begin to happen this begin to happen after a while he got boils on his flesh after a while the skin worms are starting to eat off his flesh look like he was in a Deathly Hallow even his so-called predin men of the cloth came by his house and when they saw his condition they see job I mean what's going on with you who's Sin you know I mean what's going on you need to make some things right or maybe you need to do some self-examination they didn't even know how to start praying for the condition but job begin to declare Hallelujah to his wife and even his wife got frustrated with him his wife was accustomed to driving Mercedes bz but I guess they had to sell it she was accustomed to using a world pool microwave but I guess they had to sell that too she got so frustrated and out of the spirit and she said why did you just Curse God and die I'm sure she didn't shout it it was subtle remember the devil is subtle you know this was a this was a peak this was a climax of all the devil had to throw at him when his wife came and said why don't you curse God and die why you just you know why you just give up she said he said no you speak like a foolish woman I'm not going to do that isn't that right Hallelujah and there he sat in the as sheep scraping his balls there in the muck they in the M Hallelujah isn't that right when his human Spirit fail when his greatness fell when his education fell when his when his anointing fell when this fell through and when that fell through in his finances and his home and his children and his family and his life when everything fell apart something in him rose up God began to speak to job in a whirlwind and said where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth and when the morning Stars sang together where were you job oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah all of a sudden job had a flashback J about a flashback oh Hallelujah he felt like how Adam had felt when he was called in the Garden of Eden he said Adam Adam where are thou it was that same voice that was speaking to job said job where are you job job answer me like a man job good up your loins Job answer me where was thou when I lay the foundation of the earth Joe began to declare though the skim worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall seek God oh hallelujah amen and job got a double blessing isn't that right yes sir more than he had before Hallelujah isn't that right praise God and when you give when you're ready to give up all that you have God will give you so much more than that God owns a cattle on a thousand hills but he's waiting for you to surrender to him this morning oh Hallelujah but there's something in you to overcome there's something in you to stand a trial there's something in you to stand a test or you would not be here this morning oh Hallelujah think of it there's many people heard the gospel and they walked away many people heard the good news and they walked away but you came think about that real carefully why did you come you had a choice you could have walked away you didn't have to be here this morning but it was something in you keeping you in the trial it was something in you keeping you in the test yes that's not you that is God inside of you pressing his way through oh Hallelujah that is God inside of you this [Applause] morning amen first Peter 58 be sober be vigilant in other words be on your watch at all times be on your guard at all times because your adversary the devil is as a roaring lion walk it about seeking whom he may devour he don't want to bite off your hand you see I think I think when people are surfing I think Surfers in the water and so forth they have shark attacks sometimes right so in nature they say that the shark normally goes up and he nibbles on the thing to see if it's food but the devil ain't nibbling the devil devouring he eating your hole without salt so don't even think for a second that the devil is your friend he is your enemy he is your enemy and he wants to kill you this morning you have an adversary this morning the devil and the only reason why he has not taken you off this morning it because God has a purpose for your life and that purpose must be accomplished it's not your purpose it's God's purpose and if God before us then who can stand against us oh Hallelujah yeah I say to you no weapon formed against you shall prosper there's no bomb no gun no knife no sword that God could make in this world or a world to come that could ever separate you from the love of God no weapon formed against you shall prosper oh Hallelujah no weapon no weapon against your family no weapon against your children no weapon against you no weapon against anything can ever separate you from the love of God oh hallelujah hallelujah oh who son are you this morning be strong and of a good courage oh put on the whole armor of [Applause] [Music] God oh hallelujah hallelujah so the devil is not playing games this is a Warfare it is war and Wars are fought for principle isn't that right but Isaac brought us such a tremendous message down in De M uh Wednesday Wednesday night he talking about Waring against the enemy isn't that right such a wonderful message and I love what he said there he said the principle that we are fighting for he said Wars are fought for principle and he said the principle that we are fighting for is the word of God nothing less than the word not 99 and 910 why because God can only anoint his word hallelujah hallelujah and we are looking for God's anointing and we know that God's anointed can only anoint the word so if we preach anything else to you other than the word how can God anoint that he cannot anoint our thoughts he cannot anoint our ideas he cannot anoint what we think he can only anoint his word he says my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not my your ways my word is not your word man's word will fail but God's word will stand forever Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away so we are standing on the word of God this morning and the devil is trying to get us off the word this morning but the devil is a liar this morning he's a liar this morning every time he opens his mouth he is a liar oh hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hey say Amen somebody Hallelujah trying to get you off the word CU as soon as he got you off the word he has you he got Eve off the word that's how he got her to shake and then he slipped in something else that was not the word a hybrid thought and threw the whole creation out of K the whole just think of it the world was in harmony at one point and then with one word the entire situation collapsed amen yes isn't that right all nature got messed up whole thing got messed up the whole picture that's right that's why God said Adam Adam where out thou because the old picture all of a sudden was light and it became Darkness amen all of a sudden just like that one word see so we can't afford to come on the Devil's Playground isn't that right we got to stand on the word of God because on the word of God hallelujah has all the promises for you on the word of God hallelujah is short forever and ever heaven and not will pass away but the world will never pass away so no matter what thought the devil brings we are standing on the word this morning we are standing on Holy Ground this morning we are standing on our place in Christ this morning oh Hallelujah Hal we are pressing praise God we are striving we are contending for the same word praise God the word of Malachi for thought and labor to bring oh Hallelujah Through Blood Sweat and Tears he lost his wife he lost his family he lost this he lost that but he stayed with the word don't he SL me yet I trust TR him there stood Malachi 4 and

offering hallu all right let me hurry along here now so this is not so this is not a fight I'm trying to emphasize this fight now because you got to understand the gravity of this situation this is not a fight until you are tired somebody said this once this is a fight until you win amen you're not fighting until I feel messed up no you can't afford to get tired you got to you got to dig deep you got to find the strength because your enemy if he gets one thing over you that's it he going to try to cut you off forever oh H you can't afford to get tired you can't afford to get weary they that wait upon the Lord shalling you their strength you do some waiting begin to soak out the promises of God drop yourself back into the word when you feel yourself going out too much begin to drop

its way for you this morning to positionally place you in the age of the Overcomer this bright age is an age for Overcomers this is not for the weary this is not for the faint of Hearts this is for them that can endure to the [Applause] yeah Hallelujah this is not justification come on now this is not sanctification there's lot of baptism Holy Ghost and the gifts we gone way past that God is

Perfection and nothing will stop that seed it's a one-way ticket to Glory it's a oneway ticket to the [Music] promises [Applause] amen Hallelujah Prophet preacher message called the greatest battle ever fought isn't that right and there were many wars fought in the Bible the Bible talks about many battles the Bible talks about many confrontations the Bible talks about many showdowns many things that took place where the enemy's powers are tested where God's powers are tested and as we know throughout each story God's Powers always prevailed over Satan am H isn't that right he's never lost a battle he is our five star general Jus he got five stars over his chest he is going be for us this morning move with that cloud this morning that cloud would not fail you that cloud would not leave you that cloud will go with you with you to the trial with you to the test it is a holy spirit that led Jesus in the wilderness it'll be the holy spirit that lead the bride through her third place

of [Applause] God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen the word of God your most vital piece of equipment in this battle but we're going to get it amen I'm taking my time so there are a lot of wars in the in the Bible isn't that right many battles were fought and always think back to the first war that was in Revelation 12: 7 says Michael and his angels fought and the dragon and his angels fought against the enemy Hallelujah they are fighting against each other isn't that right in heaven because the dragon thought that he could get some worship too he thought why could God have all the worship Lucifer was an esteemed person in heaven but he let it get to his head he let it get over him he let it get to Sweet in the mouth hallelujah hallelujah begin to talk about himself a little more he begin to brag about himself a little bit he begin to tell a lie and then he needed another lie to cover up that lie and the more lies he told is the more of a hole he began to sink himself deeper in and he said I'm not going by myself I have to go with some other people so he got some church members some ones who didn't know why they wasn't Church they just showed up and Devils come and Whisper to the air silly women leading with diverse lust begin to whisper in the air and they went along with him they were laid captive but there were some sons of God who W afraid to stand against the devil and his angels oh I believe we're speaking to that people this morning you are not afraid of the devil you are not afraid of the enemy hallelujah hallelujah all the time Heaven going all right the devil is is thousands of years he doing this all the time Heaven all right one word from the devil and he turned Heaven upside down all of a sudden there a Waring faction sword and stone and and shield and disc going back and forth dragon fighting Michael fighting sons of God fighting the sons of the devil fighting isn't that right conflict back and forth Hallelujah but the Bible says that the Michael and his angels Prevail over the devil and what do you think happened as soon as they Prevail Hallelujah the Bible said they lifted up their hands to heaven and began to praise the name of the Lord Our God and swear by him that liveth forever and ever oh H they begin to praise God what do you think begin to happen they begin to have a Revival they begin to dance and Shout where were you and the sons of God kick Satan Out of Heaven oh hallelujah hallelujah listen brother when you begin to kick the devil out of your life you watch the real Revival begin to set in when you kick Lucifer out of your home when you kick him out of your life when you kick him out of your family you watch yourself have a jumping time you have a real Revival then brother watch your shouting watch the praising of God brother you come to church early nobody have to tell you what to do you kneel before the altar of God lift your hands up to him that's that liveth forever and ever and praise the name of your God because Dynamics is coming because the holy spirit is coming because the Revival is coming and you are being made ready by Revelation oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory Hallelujah hallu no place found for the dragon I love that I just can't get off that there's no place for his foolishness anymore there's no place for his greed no place for his selfishness no place for his words oh we don't want to hear what the devil have to say this Bible has all that we need this Bible have all the answers we need every answer you need is written in this book young man young woman you don't have to ask no boy you don't have to ask no girl for the answer this has the answer this is what we're standing on this is what we're fighting for this is what we're contending for because when the World falls down when this falls down when all the systems come apse this world will stand [Applause] forever this is where we come from my name is in this book your name is in this book and when we preach this book we preach your name hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah amen glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory Hallelujah so this heavenly battle amen the devil come down like lightning upon the Earth is that right Hallelujah and that battle begin to continue on the earth isn't that right right Hallelujah now there's a difference between a war and a battle a war is a continuous thing it's made up of different battles H there's this battle and that battle and this battle so this first battle in heaven ended Hallelujah when Michael kicked Satan out of heavenly places and T him down on the earth that was only the first battle am there were many other battles to follow after that isn't that right where the devil is fighting against God's people God's people fighting against the forces of the devil Hallelujah isn't that right life been separated from darkness and since that day there was separation separation separation isn't that right going on down the line and the Battle of angels become the Battle of men isn't that right Bible said we were born in sin we were shaped in iniquity we come in the world speaking lies isn't that right we didn't know our place we didn't know who we were because of Adam and the fall so we had to find our way back to God and God had to find his way to get to us to reveal himself to us isn't that right so through what seemed like the foolishness of preacher through what seemed like just a preacher on the street somebody spoke a word to us somebody witness back to us this blessed holy word of God hallelujah and something in our hearts begin to connect back to our Eternal promise to an eternal property that was veiling your heart since before the foundation of the world the devil tried to keep you from it but God found his way to you this morning so Hallelujah God found his way to you this morning somehow he found his way look at you now you didn't think you would make it you didn't think you come this far but when you look back down the long road it was God that took us through it was God that took us through the trial it was God that took us through the test it was God that put the fight in us to overcome this trial to overcome this test to overcome this persecution hallelujah oh you couldn't save yourself it was God that save you so put your confidence in God and put on the whole armor of God that you make be able to stand in the evil day having done all to [Applause] standen amen amen hallelujah so we are not in control we like to think we have control but we don't cuz we are being influenced by two waren factions that are on this Earth this morning that are right here Among Us this morning fighting against you from receiving the Holy Ghost fighting against you from receiving your portion your promise fighting against you Waring against you and the devil will use anybody to do it sometimes you'll use the person closest to you to do it oh H to try to cut you off but where are you before the foundation where were you hallelujah praise God you were there and if you took your stand back there with Michael you will take your stand here tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so the word of God come to us what it come to do show us who you are show us who God is show us who the devil is give us a revelation to open our eyes to see that the real battle that is taking place in this place this morning to open our eyes to see what it is that's really been going on all this while Hallelujah to open our eyes to see the real enemy it's not your brother it's not your sister it's not this church it's not that church it's not this group versus that group no it's only God versus Satan oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right so we were born in imperfection so somehow God has to find a way to bridge a gap between Perfection and imperfection Hallelujah and He sent Jesus Christ the son of God to bridge a gap Hallelujah with the blood Hal atonement Hallelujah to make you join HS with him Hallelujah PCH you through the blood oh Hallelujah he claim you as his own oh isn't that right redeemed through the blood of Jesus Christ he bought you at a price and not only that when he ascended into heaven he went and he took the book of names oh huah in that book I was in that book but there was nobody to take that book and to redeem the names I was in that book to redeem the soldiers to redeem his special forces that will coming forth in 2015 to fight the enemy in this last round Hallelujah he needed some soldiers so Jesus Christ went on the cross said I die for them soldiers I pay a price for them soldiers so that when them soldiers come out they come through the water they come through the power but they'll come through the blood oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallah hallelujah oh Hallelujah and in age God had Soldiers god had solders in Luther's day he had so in W's day he had so this in the Pentecostal Church oh they were fighting for the truth fighting for the word of God fighting for the dip of the anointing that God had revealing that day

Hallelujah isn't that right for the greatest battle ever fought he said the greatest battle ever fought that was ever going to be fought is about to take place right now hallelujah hallelujah let me read it here the greatest battle of a for here's a prophet he said and so an Army first in getting ready for a battle first there's got to be a select some soldiers they've got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting oh oh Hallelujah some select soldiers not just anybody no no no but somebody who has the representation by predestination in them because only those could endure unto the end it is only those who could hold to the word and nothing else God put a thirst in them to follow after Jesus to follow after 100% the word oh Hallelujah is that who you are this morning oh listen now you are more than a match for Satan you are more than a match for the enemy the devil has 6,000 years to do his work right now the devil reaches climax right now he max out

to give glory to God but when your life is a testimony when it is preaching a life Hallelujah thundering out in humility thundering out in sweetness when your life is a thunder that is what hurts the devil oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh that's what hurts the devil most when you begin to live for this word when you begin to fight by this word we fight by the word we die by the word but we going to stand by the word praise God hallelujah hallelujah doesn't matter what comes our way it is written it is written it is written Devil bow right in the kiss oh Hallelujah okay okay hallu hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen you see the devil hates you yes cuz every time he look at you you represent all that he could have been yes if he didn't forfeit This Promise he you represent everything that he could have been but he forfeit it he gave it up that's not our fault oh Hallelujah so don't put that on me devil I got a promise in God get out of my way he has no promise of the Holy Ghost he has no promise of adoption Hallelujah I have nothing to do with that he took his t a long time ago now let me take my St now let me tell the devil in my generation where to get off the bus this bus is going to Glory Hallelujah praise God hold the door open bus [Applause] driver hallelujah how many feel Victorious this morning amen amen amen we are more than conquerors through Christ that loved us Amen Let me hurry along here now so now before any battle can be put in a AR they have to first choose a meeting ground or a place where the battle is to be fought a selected place isn't that right in the first world war it was so placed as no man's land and places where they fought and they've got to be a place selected isn't that right there has to be a Place selected and they say as there's a mutual ground no man's land okay they fight near this place he said they don't just fight here they don't just fight over there fight down there he said there's a Battlefront where they meet and test their powers where each Army tests its strength against the other Army a mutual meeting place he said now don't miss this here the said the prophet he said when this gratt started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for battle to rage and that Battleground begins in the human mind isn't that right he said there's where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it begin and it's because that decisions are made from the mind the head and now they say they they they they never started it from some organization they never started it from some mechanical Affair the grounds never started there therefore that organization could never do the work of God because the Battlegrounds is where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you isn't that right you said decisions are made in the mind and in the head that's where Satan meets you and the decisions are because that God made a man that way isn't that right that's why God told the prophet because thou has chosen the narrow way the harder way there be a huge portion of Heaven awaiting you isn't that right you have to make a choice young man young woman oh whoever you are you've got to make a choice whether you serve God or serve the devil there's no in between you can't mess with in between you can't be sitting on the fence you're either for God or for the Devil the fence is a very dangerous place to be at because as I told you we in a war and the devil is looking for any opportunity and if you are sitting on the fence it is easy for the devil to reach up on the fence and grab you and pull you down on the other side don't sit on the fence get over to God where the promises are come on now get over in the word get over where you should be stay down the middle of the road not over on the left not over on the right but stay down the middle of that road that road is headed to Glory that road is headed to your promise that road is headed to your portion oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen oh isn't that right isn't that right Hallelujah so this battle we about to face Hallelujah the uh Prophet call it the greatest battle that's ever been fought oh think about it many sages and Prophets wish they could have been here to see what was going to go on and what was going to take place they knew it would be a final showdown they knew it would be the final climax of all the powers that was in God that he had poured into Christ oh they that all the powers that was in Christ was about to be poured into the church in this last day because God knew that we would need all the power of God to fight all the power of Satan oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen not some of the power all of the Power that's why you need to put on the whole armor of God not some of the armor oh not just your feet not just your belt good to Lord no no no not just your breastplate of righteousness not just the helmet not just the shield but you need the sword of the spirit listen you can have the armor but if you don't have the sword you are not in attack mode even up to the shield you might just be able to defend yourself but if you really want to do some damage if you really want to hurt the enemy if you really want to slice and cut if you really want to shut the heavens and open it up you need the word of of God to be able to hand it there because the most you could do with the shield is just hide behind the shield hide behind your Revelation hide behind your Vindication isn't that right hide behind the fiery dots of the enemy the enemy ha you so much he's shooting fiery darts hallelujah hallelujah it means that if he even if he don't hit you the fire is supposed to land somewhere and wreak havoc H you have to be jumping here and jumping there and hiding from the enemy but when the sword of the word goes into your hand you can raise up flip your sword run into the enemy Hallelujah hand it there hand it there the word of God sharper and a two-edged sword cutting beyond the bone cutting beyond the [Music] marrow oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah isn't that right oh we getting ready to do battle this morning morning we're getting ready to fight the enemy this morning I don't want to just damage the enemy I want to do him away forever after what he's done to all the saints in the ages after what he's done hallelujah praise God he don't deserve to live oh but we got the word of the sword of word of the Lord this morning to slice the enemy as listen in Roman military tactics the sword that they were using is not a long SW sword amen it's not a Broad Sword hallelujah it's just a small sword amen and I love how Paul I described the Army he didn't talk about a Speare a spare is a different kind of weapon Hallelujah with a spare you can shoot from afar and hope to hit the target you're shooting from far and you're hoping to hit the enemy but the word of God is not something that Miss and hit it's not a perhaps is not a maybe so the sword was designed short keep it close to you and when on shees you go up to the enemy face to face because that's where the battle is we not shooting from far and hope you're going to make it and think you're going to make it no it's a short sword cor up to the enemy run up to the enemy stab him praise God turn it inside of him make sure he's dead hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's a close range battle H huj up close and personal like but said you can't be in The News Room reporting news well this brother just dead and this one dying and 1500 casualties and the hospital overloaded no you are in the battle you are fighting the enemy you are chopping aside all the lust all the fils all the things of the world cutting it down to the word only to the word only hallelujah oh amen praise God Amen you understand that this morning that's what the battle is at hallelujah it's in your mind sometimes you are Your Own Worst Enemy Hallelujah you have to cut the Devils away from you take every High touch into captivity put on your helmet of salvation the same God that save you take confidence in your salvation experience you don't do those things no more you don't think those way no more when the enemy come like a flood the spirit of God is promised to raise up a stand how does he raise a standard by taking the same word of God I'm making it more positive every time you are going to be filled you are going to be sealed then the spirit of God anoints the word that is inside of you make it more positive make it more real bang bang bang bang hallelujah hallelujah okay Amen Let me hurry up here now amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen so once you sign up for the Army this is what you sign up for you sign up for wars and rumors of wars you're signning for battles you're sign up for confrontation you can't run from confrontation expect to be perfected doesn't work that way there needs to be a confrontation there needs to be conflict there needs to be Hallelujah some kind of a showdown to prove what is inside of you why did God bring out a bride in this evil age he brought her out to try her to see what's inside of her because he knows the test is the best thing that could happen to you inside of here so don't think it not strange concerning the fire trial that is to trial you as though it is some strange thing it is not a strange thing it is you putting on the armor of God it is you fighting the good fight of Fai it is you proving the devil proving The Works of God in your age amen amen hallelujah hallelujah overcoming devil in your home in your life in your workplace wherever you are overcoming overcoming praise God hallelujah and to the Overcomer will I give the ministry of the Morning Star what is the Morning Star Jesus Christ he said I am the root and ofspring of David he said I am the bright and Morning Star to him that overcome it the prophet said you can't say you overcome you can't go through some pipe and then God pull you through and say blessed is he that overcome it you didn't do nothing God just put you through a pipe and he pull you through the other end you didn't work for it God love his people to fight and to strive the kingdom of God is preached and every man press his way press his way press his way into it oh isn't that right the kingdom of God suffered violence and the violent take it by force oh Hallelujah violence violence against Satan violence against the enemy violence against demon power violence against anything that is not the [Applause] word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so you are representing the kingdom here this morning we are Kingdom people we are fighting for a kingdom that cannot be seen with natural hands no no no this Kingdom that we're talking about is an eternal Kingdom and the kingdom comes into you when the word of God turns into power and spirit in your life then you can exercise the kingdom then you can enforce the powers of the kingdom and say little fishy I give you your life then you can enforce the powers of the Kingdom oh Hallelujah and say Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give idea rise up and walk that is exercising the powers of the Kingdom Hallelujah Healing The Sick raising the dead but how does it come through overcoming Hallelujah isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah so you have to be prepared for fighting you have to be prepared for the challenge to meet the challenge of the hour and there's a promise in the word for us that virtue powerful service is the outlet for the guide to take you all the way from fa Faith all the way up to charity isn't that right hallelujah it's going to empower you Hallelujah Hal your spiritual dress to begin to add the life of of Christ to begin to war against the enemy to deny yourself and take up your cross and follow after Jesus hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right I'm closing quickly look at David David went down there and he saw Goliath isn't that right big tall guy but he wasn't intimidated because he had an experience on the back side of the desert with a real God with a real lion with a real bear wasn't no taxad lion it was a real lion hallel not talking about stuff toys praise God it was the real stuff Hallelujah and he conquered the lion he conquered a bear and he had a testimony that the god that overcome the lion the god that me overcome the bear is the same God that's going to overcome this Goliath but listen David was prepared David didn't say wow look at that D look at that look at that GL look at that giant I'm going to take him out let me go home first and get ready no that wasn't David David always had his sling on him David didn't have to go back home and say well I need this and I need that no David tell himself while I am on the way to carry food for my brethren if anything happened to me I could handle myself I could handle my own stuff I can handle my own trials I can handle my own tests and that's how you need to be in the so this season you need to be sober you need to be vigilant you need to be watching Always way in prayer and supplication looking for the enemy to see where he's at so you can overcome hallelujah hallelujah amen amen you need to be prepared to fight isn't that right Jacob was watching waiting for the angel Hallelujah isn't that right musician could come he was looking alwayss Hallelujah isn't that right waiting waiting waiting for something to happen waiting for something to break and all of a sudden here come the angel appear before him isn't that right so when the angel appeared Joshua's response was not wow look the angel boy look at let me take a selfie yes Brothers Brothers come quick come on come on look at this the time he is taken to do that the angel don't if that was an enemy he had already had enough time to chop off his head kill him run back to the tent say he overcome and all kind of things you you can't be unprepared you can't be caught off your G so because somebody rise up with a gift or because somebody rise up with some kind of interpretation we supposed to just take that just like that we supposed to just jump up and down just like that no try it the Bible said try the spirits Joshua pull out his sword he said are you for us or are you against us are you for this word or are you not for this word don't just take any gift like that come on now somebody say a certain thing this man claim a certain thing the prophet said try it see if it's right try that Spirit are you for us or are you against us are you for the word are you not for the word oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah isn't that right oh Hallelujah we can't fall for the same mistake twice no no no no no we got to draw our swords we got to pull our swords out try every gift by the word try everything by the spirit hallelujah hallelujah amen amen see see if it's right amen isn't that right we have to be trained to know how to win this battle

to you you got to be in the spirit you got to be in the anointing you got to be in the word you got to be sharp on it you got to be Raaz a edge you got to know whether it's false or whether it's not false whether it's 99 and 910 you got to be a church train on on the word of God so that you will not fall Hallelujah so that you will not amen falter isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah I think in health and safety amen isn't that right sometimes they uh they will tell you that you have to wear hard hat you have to wear boots you have to wear gloves you have to be dressed a certain way to go out there or you'll get damaged or you'll get hit isn't that right well that's what the bride needs to do in this hour she needs to put on the full dress of the word of God isn't that right Hallelujah to be able to stand the test Hallelujah isn't that right praise God Amen and amen amen hallelujah so I'm closing finally my brethren Hallelujah this is what Paul says in other words finally if it's

strong in the Lord and in the power of His might amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's not your strength that's going to do it it's not by might it's not by power but it is by his spirit that this mountain is going to be moved in your life it is by his spirit that that Hallelujah that trial that that testing that you're going to overcome it is by his Spirit not in any strength of your own we don't have no strength but when our strength is gone his strength is perfect in our weakness his strength is how we will [Applause] [Music] overcome hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah put

move and in every move Hallelujah say I know you're going to come I know you're coming this way praise God and could block then you could attack then you could move forward then you could overcome then you could take this portion and take this portion take this portion and take this portion isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah God didn't tell them to take all the land one time no it was
