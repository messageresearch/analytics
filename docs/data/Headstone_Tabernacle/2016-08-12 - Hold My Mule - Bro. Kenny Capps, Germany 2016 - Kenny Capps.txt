thank you Jesus [Music] good morning church yeah when I came in and I looked upon this picture here in front the question came to me what is the attraction on the mountain amen amen when the Lord Jesus entered into Jerusalem sitting on and an ass the people recognized that scripture being fulfilled here before their eyes before their ears and they started to cry they started to call upon him and they say hosana blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosana oh Lord have mercy amen and here we are this morning and calling upon him that's right yeah I greet you you may be seated for I'm not going to preach but I'm just want to speak a few words before we enter into prayer and before we are sitting down and going to listen to the word brother zigma asked me to introduce the the preaching of the word and I don't know the the preacher personally I only heard about his name but we want to believe that when he is going to speak in the name of the Lord that the preacher will be the Holy Spirit and amen yeah I greet you all we just returned from a small missionary journey into Eastern Europe the Lord called me to do missionary work and we have tried to be faithful to our calling uh up until this time and uh we ask all we pray and we ask the Lord that he will keep us faithful until the end but um we bring greetings from the Believers in Poland in the Czech Republic when we left them they and we told them that we were going to see you here in conference in convention in uh the south of Germany they they asked us to pass on greetings to you and there is some meaning in that it's not just saying hello or saying uh how are you but when we pass on greetings as Believers then we pass on blessings we that's why we greet one another in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so I trust that you will receive those This Love This few words of love and these few words of greeting uh in your heart brother Sigma also asked me to pray to have these prayer requests and to pray and before we are going to pray before we are going to call upon the Lord I want to remember you of the word of God that is speaking in for instance in First Corinthians U the 10th chapter uh here it's spoken that they all did drink of that spiritual Rock and that rock was following them and that rock that was Christ Christ the Rock that followed them and I remember the message and that was became also my inspiration during this last journey the ever present water of The Rock and there the prophet was speaking about Christ the Rock that follow them Christ the Rock once paten for all but when that rock followed them when they wanted to see this life that was coming from this rock flowing again they were asked or they were called by the Lord to speak to that rock to that same original Rock but not to beat That Rock a second time because that rock was beaten once and for all but from now they should call upon that rock and that rock followed them that rock stayed with them that rock never went out of visible distance or hearing distance or calling distance and so this morning I I want to know how to speak to that rock another time together with you here present but also in my individual walk with the Lord and because the scripture says in Romans 10 the righteousness of Faith speaketh this way do not say um in your heart who shall bring Christ down from heaven do not speak in your heart who shall bring Christ up from grave or from dead but the righteousness of faith speaketh this way near is the word near is Christ the anointed word it's in your heart and it's in your mouth the word the anointed word that we preached that we preach Christ the word that follow them I remember that in the time brother bandam visited South Africa and was having encounter with men that we all know from name because we've we find that throughout the message there was a man Sydney Jackson he came came from Pentecostal uh background and after hearing brother Brandon preaching about the Oneness of God and um all these uh truth after hearing he him being a true trinitarian uh believer preacher then he said to brother Ram brother R after hearing your preach I'm a little confused before I didn't know how to pray how to call upon the Lord I called upon the Lord as father and I called upon him in the name of the son and I called upon him through the holy spirit so I went that way to call upon him but now I do not know how to pray what to say how what to speak and the brother said to him brother Jackson brother Sydney I don't know how how he called him he said brother sney you speak you pray today that God that lives in You by his holy spirit amen so here a prayer requests here are few believers they want the church to pray to speak to the Lord to

meetings I believe God Almighty organized this convention now he used our precious brother and his family and many friends and people in the church no doubt but I believe this convention was organized from the foundation of the world now I can't speak for you this morning but I take everything from God in a personal manner amen this convention was for me well I'm glad that you could come and be blessed but it was for me I've enjoyed myself thoroughly I've prayed I've sang I've shouted I've cried I've danced you see when we come to church we don't come to church just to come to church oh yes come on brother we come to church Church to have [Music] church I come to this convention to have church I don't know about everything that's going on and what this person believes and what that person believes that's fine and good but I came to have church I believe God has already met us in this convention but it's not over yet you if you have not received the blessing yet I believe you can receive it this morning amen we do thank brother colen brener and I must say I thank every Minister and every message that I've heard here I can take something good from every message I can take something good from every minist Minister and I'm going to tell you Minister Brothers something that have preached every one of you has said something that I'm going to [Applause] steal I'll be using it in the days and months and years to come because I believe it was God ordaining what happens in this meeting well we could go on and on uh this morning now listen I'm a little different some people say strange but I'm just a little different and uh God has given me a great rapport with the young people in this message probably like brother Ron Spencer I've done many many many many youth camps and uh most of the messages that he gives me I believe have been geared to the youth but then I got to thinking this morning you know we're all closer to 21 than we've ever been before so if you're here this morning and you're young or if you're young at heart I believe this message is for you this morning my subject is the power of praise [Applause] and you know like I said I'm Different my title this morning y'all put your seat belts on my title is hold my my mule hold my mule I know it's a strange title but I believe God has something for us this morning let's go ahead and get into the word of God stand with me if you will and I'll be reading from Psalms 149 and 150 Psalms 149 says praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King let them praise His name in the dance Hallelujah let them sing praises unto him with the timberl and the harp for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand to execute vengeance upon the Heathen and punishments upon the people to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with feeds of iron to execute upon them the Judgment written this honor have you his Saints praise ye the Lord Psalms 150 praise ye the Lord praise God in his Sanctuary Praise Him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts Praise Him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the sulter in the harp praise him with the timal and the dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs Praise Him upon the loud symbols Praise Him upon the high sounding symbols let everything that hath breath praise the Lord Praise ye the Lord let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you this morning Lord that you've made way Lord for this this convention to come about Lord we believe it was organized of the Holy Ghost Lord we believe there's people here Lord that have gotten help Lord we believe that there's people here that have yet to get help God we're praying this morning that just one person may receive from Heaven this morning Lord the glory of God may come down Lord that one person it'll all be worth it all if one person can receive from Heaven this morning Lord we pray that you'd have your way Lord I pray that you'd move me aside Lord Lord you speak to your people through the word today have your way Lord bless your people in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated that's fine now I've ask our brother from our church to help me this morning back home and sometimes there's there's a little debate I know Brothers if you go to preach for them if you're going to preach for me you got to preach out of the Bible put the Bible on the pull pit Don't Preach with an iPad Don't Preach with a laptop you have to preach out of the Bible I said why is that said we need to preach then other preachers they'll let you come preach with your iPad preach with your computer and I find that distracting we all claim to believe the same thing right so I asked these brothers I said why why why do you uh why do you let these brothers use iPads and computers they say oh it's just a tool it's just a tool to help the people receive and I agree with that some of them use PowerPoint nothing wrong with that it's just a tool well I'm a little different I like I'm going to use the organ as a tool to help the people receive this morning brother Brian Wallace from our church in Living Word Tabernacle in Gastonia North Carolina he's with us today and he's going to help us out just a little bit now he's he's a man he's a gentleman he's not a wild man he's not a man who's going to get out of order so I just trust that you'll receive him in the same Spirit you've received me this morning I want to begin to uh this morning by quoting from the prophet of God in a message called God revealing himself to his people brother brandham said this he said the word is a seed is that right he says that a SE SED in the ground and every seed will bring forth of its kind if you need salvation the seeds here if you need healing here's the seed in the word of God the word of God is a seed put it in your heart he says don't dig it up every morning to see if it's sprouted put it in your heart leave it there it's God's business to bring forth the Harvest you just leave it there water it by faith and praise God every day thanking him for it he said is that all right and maybe to just help us understand a little bit what the prophet of God said I want to tell a story this morning I want to tell a story of a man by the name of John Ryan many of you know now in the message we find two John Ryan probably brother George made reference to one yesterday it's an old man with a white beard behind the curtains and brother brandom said that was part of the success to his meetings that John Ryan the old man with a white beard would pray for his meetings but there was another John Ryan in the message this John Ryan was a blind man he couldn't see and brother brandom was having a meeting and he had a prayer line and John Ryan came up in the prayer line brother brandham said John Ryan what would you have from the Lord this morning John Ryan said brother brandham he said you know he said I'm blind I can't see he said I would that God would give me my ey eyesight now I may be dramatizing just a little bit but not much true story brother brandom looked at him didn't even pray for him he said John Ryan go from this place and confess that God has given your eyesight and you shall [Music] see John Ryan left now John Ryan was a newspaper man and he would stand out on the corner as an old blind man and he would sell newspapers and he would stand out there on the corner and he would say extra extra read all about it and he would give the headlines of the day and people would buy his newspapers extra extra every day extra extra read all about it sometime later he came through brother branham's prayer line again brother brandham saidj John Ryan why are you here he said brother brandham you said God would heal my eyes he said I'm still blind I can't see brother random said John Ryan I told you to go from this place and confess your healing and praise God for your healing and he said you'll receive your eyesight John Ryan finally got a revelation the next day on the street corner he went out there and he said extra extra read all about it man who was once blind can now see he was still blind is a bat next day extra extra Read All About It God has healed a blind man man every day he started praising God for giving him his eyesight out in public on the street corner one day John Ryan walked into a barber shop to get his haircut he walked in that barber shop he sat down in that barber chair the barber began talking to him you Brothers know how it is Barbara put that apron up around him started talking to him he said John Ryan he said we've known you for years in this community he said people are starting to call you a crazy man he said you're standing out here on this street corner and you're confessing and praising God for healing you and we know you're a blind as a bat he he said people are starting to talk John Ryan he said you're a crazy man about that time the spirit of God Came Upon John Ryan God opened his eyes John Ryan jumped up out of that barber chair he threw down that apron he ran out of that barber shop I can see I can see I can see church we need some more John ryes around the message it's time you start confessing and start it's time you start believing God we've heard it preached for 60 years we've heard what the prophet of God said for 60 years why are we still in the condition we're [Applause] in we need some more John Ryan [Applause] [Music] brother brandom says the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass in your life our bodies are made up of 16 elements of earth we are the Earth the word of God is a seed in this seed is everything we have need of and we know that every seed will bring forth of its own kind now this morning do you need salvation the seed is there do you need healing the seed is there do you need the Holy Ghost the seed is there maybe young person you need a Godly husband or a wife it applies to you too the seed of there whatever you have need of in your life the seed is in the word of God if you can believe God's word you can receive everything that you have need of the word is a seed Church the revealed word is a seed put it in your heart don't dig it up ever so often to see if it's growing just put it in your heart and leave it there you planted it now it's God's business to bring forth the Harvest it's not your business now we've got some Farmers here I know you don't plant a natural seed then go out and dig it up in the Earth every few days to check on it but we have a tendency to do that with spiritual seeds want your brothers be seated I I I I I know what it's like to sit there and want to see the man of God and somebody standing in front of you all the time there's nothing wrong with it just we need to consider others also we have a tendency to want to dig up this spiritual seed sometimes we think you know I just wonder if I really did get sack saved I don't feel saved well listen church I got news for you I don't feel saved most of the time I don't feel saved most of the time I don't feel like a human being but that has nothing to do with it we go by the word of God we don't go by our feelings or maybe we think well I know I I prayed and I know the pastor prayed that I would be healed of this sickness but it seems like it's just not happening I still feel sick church that's the devil trying to talk you out of what God has already done for you at Calvary the prophet of God said there is nothing negative about the Holy Ghost did you know he said that he said there is nothing negative about the Holy Ghost he said everything about the Holy Ghost is positive I didn't say it he said it I'm just telling you what he said if you have the seed of God down inside you you just need to cultivate that seed you need to water it with your praise to make it grow brother random gave us the formula how do we water that spiritual word seed he said we water it by Our Praise now I want you to get this part because if you get if you miss this part you'll miss the rest of the sermon it's so very important that we learn to praise God Psalms 22 and3 says God inhabits the Praises of his people now listen to me church I'm not here this morning promoting a bunch of worked up jumped up pumped up emotion that's not what we're talking about I'm just talking about praising God in your own way some may shout some may run some may dance some may cry but just praise God in your own way some just stand still and A Tear trickles down their face but when we praise him it gets us into the spirit What Spirit the Holy Spirit we need to be in the spirit we need to live in the spirit we need to go to school in the spirit we need to go to work in the spirit we need to come to church in the spirit we got too many people well I guess I'll go to church I hope they say something that'll get me in the spirit I just feel so bad as old brother juel says woy wowy woy me I'm so down and out I sure hope that they can do something to help me this morning well how about you getting on your knees and praising God before you come to church get your mind off yourself and get your mind on God's work and help somebody else I was recent recently traveling to Arkansas for a convention it's about a 12-hour trip from my house and I like to listen to different preachers on the radio as I drive Arkansas is in the South North Carolina where I where I live is in the South and you can always find a lot of preaching and a lot of uh uh uh gospel singing in on the radio in the South I heard a preacher say something that has stuck with me it really it really struck me he said in Israel there's two Seas he says there's the Sea of Galilee and there's the Dead Sea he said now both of these seas are fed by the River Jordan and we know the River Jordan is a symbol of death but the water in the River Jordan is a symbol of life he said now he said I look at the Sea of Galilee fed by the River Jordan and he said there's 27 different kinds of fish life in the Sea of Galilee he said on the shores of the Galilee he says there's beautiful vegetation hundreds of different kinds of flowers and plants he said it's a beautiful place he said but then you go to the Dead Sea and there's nothing but stagnation and bitterness and there's nothing of beauty there's nothing of life he said what's the difference he said I'll tell you the difference he said the Sea of Galilee it takes that water in at one point and it releases that water out at another point he said the Dead Sea is it takes that water in but it keeps it there and it doesn't flow out and it becomes stagnant he said I believe we've got two different kind of seas in our churches he said we've got those and they'll take it in and they'll give it out and he said those are the happiest people in the world but he says those who want to take it in and just do nothing with it he said they become stagnant I don't know what kind of preacher he was but he made a lot of sense in what he said there the word of God is as a seed and we water that seed with our praise I'm talking this morning about the holy spirit it's a spirit that produces praise it's a spirit that produces worship whatever little portion of that seed of the revealed word we can get down into our heart and our soul our Earth we should want to make it grow do you agree we should strive to make it grow now I'm getting to be an old man I don't feel old I I still feel like a young person but when I look in the mirror I realize I'm not but I've learned that I've learned a few things in my life I've learned that the word of God is right I've learned that the message of the hour is right I have learned that Elijah is right I've learned that if I praise the Lord I will grow in faith I will grow in Grace I will grow in Mercy I will grow into the stature of a perfect man and I have learned that I can grow into a mansion in my father's house it's amazing the older you get the more you learn now this little message I've got a lot of quotes is that all right y'all like is that all right if anybody if anyone's got a problem with me reading quotes I want you to stand up this morning make your make yourself known and when you do I'm going to tell all these other people to throw you [Applause] out and the message the resurrection of Lazarus preached in Cleveland Ohio brother brandom says this is your prophet he said that's what's the matter with the church today we need a Revival we don't need a new Seminary we don't need new preachers we don't need new church build buildings we need a Revival in what we already got he said that's what we need we need a stirring up and our brother Isaac quoted the other day I thought he was going to jump all over my message he said that's what the world needs today is an oldfashioned God sent sky blue sin killing religion he said we need an old St Paul's Revival and we need the Bible Holy Ghost back in the church oh church if we could just get a revelation of a few simple things then we can get a revelation of the deeper things if we could just get a revelation of Revival in the message if we could just get a revelation of truth if we could just get a revelation of who we are you have to know who you are all it seems like all the preachers are preaching you have to know who you are you have to know who you are it's not good enough that mommy knows who you are or daddy knows who you are or the pastor knows who you are you got to know who you are and who you are is Mrs Jesus Christ if we could just get a revelation of Praise I wonder where we would be today oh my another little simple Revelation if we could just get a revelation of who our pastor is we don't we have people around they don't even have any idea who their Pastor is but the prophet of God said you need a pastor P that's what he said you need a pastor if we had if we had people who could get a revelation of who their Pastor is we probably wouldn't have so many Church hoers man y'all getting quiet Church HPP they like grasshoppers you ever seen grasshoppers they always hopping hopping here hopping there am I speaking to somebody this morning I know the PE I know people in North Carolina they have hopped to every Church in the area and we've got 40 churches in the area and a lot of them are on their second time or third time [Music] around the brother said we need to get satisfied always hopping no Revelation and this morning I'm kind of like brother random in the message he preached believe us now this he said that's what's the matter in all these countries now he didn't say in us or Canada he said that's what's the matter in all these countries now and all around the world we got too many cold formal churches having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof what we need today this is your Prophet what we need today is get a little starch out of the church and that goes for message churches [Applause] too he said we've got too many churches they're afraid of this they're afraid of that they're afraid of the other thing he said when you forget this when you forget that when you forget about the other thing and when you get in Christ yes sir he said the Holy Ghost can have the right of away am amen church I didn't say it your Prophet said it if you got a problem with it take it up with him when you get over there if you get over there this is the Malachi 45 Prophet this is the Revelation 107 Prophet this is the St Luke 17:30 Prophet hallu I don't know if I should go on or not Church it gets worse it gets worse or if you're like me it gets better all right sounds like somebody wants it here's what he says the same message he said you are going to call me a Holy Roller anyhow so I might just as well let loose that's right God's spirit will make you loose he said maybe I am a Holy Roller if I am I am the happiest Holy Roller you've ever seen Hallelujah Glory I believe he was our example I'm one of the happiest holy rers you'll ever see and I and I'm not ashamed of [Applause] it now before before we go any further I need to tell you a little story I need to tell you a little story about a man named shouting John and probably if you're not from the south of the United States you don't know the story but there's a story about an old man and they called him shouting John and he would go to church church every service he would stand and Shout he would praise God he would run the aisle he would dance down the aisle and he got the nickname shouting John and one day the church he went to the pastor died just a few members there so they closed the church what was Shelton John going to do he checked around seemed like they wasn't too many churches so finally he just settled for what he could find so one day John decided to join a dead [Laughter] church and he joined that dead Church and the organist was playing Amazing Grace John was sitting in his Pew and they began to sing Amazing Grace he just couldn't sit still any longer he got up and he began to praise God he began to shout he did this service after service and one day the deacons came to him said brother John we need to have a word with you they took him in the back room I've been in that back [Laughter] room they took him in the back room and they said now brother John says we have a dignified church here said we have doctors and lawyers and such in our church said now listen brother John said we love you and we love you coming to our church but we just can't have that behavior in our church if you're going to keep coming to our church you're going to to have to be a good boy John was a real true Christian he believed in headship and he remarked within himself I'm going to do better saw a few Services John was he was a good boy but after a few Services he's sitting in his pew and they was playing what a mighty God we serve and John was wanting to be a good boy and he sat there and his feet began to move next thing you know he began to Pat his [Applause] leg after a while he just couldn't stand it any longer he stood up and he shouted I serve a mighty God and he began to shout and he began to run down the aisle thank you [Applause] brother nown lived on the side of a mountain and every day John had an old one mule plow and every day he would get on that farm and he would get behind that old mule and that old plow and he'd plow around the mountain side oh he'd sing and praise God he'd plow around that mountain Oh How I Love Jesus and he that was his life so one day shouting John he's out there plowing in his field around that mountain and he saw a big fine automobile come up the side of the mountain he saw I don't know what y'all have may maybe mer he saw a big fine Mercedes driving up to his place on the country road and he just kept plowing finally that big fine automobile got to about where he was at and he directed the old mule over there and he got there and they started getting out of the car the deacons and the trustees there were six of them and they walked up to John I said brother John we've come to have a conference with you said uh we want to tell you something said we want to tell you that you can't come to our church anymore you carry on like some poor ignorant animal when you come to our church you act crazy we can't have that in our church said the mayor of the city goes to our church and he doesn't want to be associated with a church that has people that act like you do should I say it or should I not well let's let's say it and see what happens that's a lot like some of our message churches you can like it or you can not like it but it's the truth [Music] anyhow said brother John said you can't come to our church anymore shouting John looked at him he said Brethren I want to say something to you today he said I want you to look around this mountain he said God gave me this mountain as far as the eye could see he said God gave me this property he said God gave me four wonderful children never one time have I had to go to the courthouse to get him out of trouble never one time have I had to go to the jail housee to get him out of jail he said God has been good to me Brethren he said God gave me all this land God gave me Rams and Lambs he gave me dogs and Hogs he gave me Greens and Beans he gave me potatoes and tomatoes he gave me wheat and he gave me meat he said what you say is just fine he said but I want to tell you something else if I can't praise God in your church I'll just praise him right here he said here amen hold my mule while I praise God and he begin to D he begin toout he said I'll Just Praise my God right here we need some more shouting Johns around the [Applause] message well this morning if you'll just hold my mule for about 30 minutes I'm going to praise my God I'm going to have myself a time I can't speak for you this morning but I can speak for this guy I believe in praising [Applause] God so just hold my mule I'm going to praise God you can do what you want now this part this part is some of the quotes I've read to you before they were all before 1963 and I've had people say those quotes you're reading are all before [Applause] 1963 and that's true they were but this part is for you after 63 boys in the message invisible Union of the Bride November 65 30 days before his death brother Brandon was speaking on these modern-day Christians on these modern-day women not wanting a bunch of kids around them come on you've read it he said neither does this modernday church one any of those screaming shouting yelling tongu speaking acts 238 children around them 1965 oh brother Kenny you're surely not surely he didn't no surely he didn't say that yeah you people that bring your tablets to check up the preacher on his quotes look it up right now [Applause] he said the modern day Church doesn't want those noisy hooping crying shouting screaming Christians in their [Applause] Church you got something special for that brother Brian he said this is your Prophet the modern day Church says why do you let such stuff as that go on in your church he said now and I don't need to tell y'all this in the 60s when he was talking about denominations he was also talking about the denominational spirits that would be in this message in this [Applause] day he said the denominations would put that church member out real fast I say even some message churches would throw them out real fast he said the church does not want them loud shouting children of God cause they would embarrass her hallah hallu I've preached in many many many message churches in the US and there's just a few of them I just get one shot I got one shot and they're going to hear it in that one shot I say it's a shame your Prophet said in the same message invisible Union if you want to look it up paragraph 263 people said in churches and say what will the Joneses think if I go to shouting and crying and speaking in tongues what would they think what would that my neighbor say if I shout and run and get baptized IED in Jesus name brother random said what nonsense he said what will God think if you don't do that look it up get your little tablet going turn your little iPad on and look it up he said it look it up when you get home your Prophet said it after 16 [Applause] 3 what will God think if you don't do those things now we're still in 1965 still in the invisible Union of the pride Brother P I want to ask you a question are you married to the Joneses your neighbors are you married to Christ are you married to the church are you married to the revealed [Applause] [Music] word are you married to your local assembly or are you married to Jesus Christ you sisters are you married to your pride in your long hair and your long skirts and your long tongues are you married to to God boy he said some crude things didn't he he said some crude things am yes sir he said one time he said if you're out on the street and you see a lady with all that makeup on he said you just sell her good morning Mrs dog meat a prophet of God the holiest office in the kingdom of God hallelujah say stuff like that I don't I don't know if I could follow a prophet like that I'm a I'm a real Christian I'm a real message

this is Brother Kenny I don't find anywhere in the Bible where Judas praised God I don't find anybody anywhere in the Bible where the devil praise God in the message to whom would we go oh I don't know if y'all can take this or not n are you sure can you take it if the prophet said it yes sir you can take it right he said yes sir we pay so much money and so much attention to the Undertaker how about let's give some thought let's give some money to the upper taker he's the one that's going to take us up one day said he is the only translator he is the only one that can bring us from the grave he's the only one that can pre present us before the father without a fault without a spot without a wrinkle I'm sorry Church it just keeps getting worse and worse call him BR if you want your deacons to carry me out now that's fine come on brother come on brother all right here we go brother random said Hallelujah sure I shout anybody that's got good religion shout hallelujah anybody that's got good religion shouts because they got something to shout about Glory Hallelujah hallah church I'm not making this stuff [Applause] up this is your Prophet they got something to shout about I want to ask you a question this morning have you got good religion anybody that's got good religion shouts I think we have the best religion that has ever been on the face of the Earth we got something to shout about give him praise Church give him praise you people sitting in your chairs like a knot on a log what I'm telling you is the truth if you believe the prophet of God you ought to be on your feet you ought to be hanging from the rafters you are going to be praising God this morning thank you Jesus we love you Lord the name of Jesus let Has Lifted us up many times we want to be found lifting up the name of Jesus [Applause] [Music] now if you've noticed I've not I've not mentioned one Doctrine I don't have any doctrines I've not mentioned one colletive Revelation I don't believe in Collective Revelations I've not mentioned one particular church I'm just talking about Jesus and what the prophet of God said about him [Applause] Church the day of man-made Doctrine is over the day of great Personalities in the message is over there's no great on Among Us the prophet of God said we're all the same in the Kingdom in the economy of God he says there's no big eyes and little use I don't care who you are I don't care who your pastor is I don't care what church you go [Applause] to there is no great ones Among [Music] Us don't tell me I have to listen to some personality don't tell me there's somebody greater than I am and don't tell me that I'm greater than somebody my Prophet said we're all the same I could I could mention some names of some great personalities and leaders of Doctrine in this message when I started preaching they'd send somebody around I'll be quite quite Frank there was some that came from New York yeah and they came to me and they said said brother Kenny we really like your preaching would you consider be coming and being one of us no I'm not considering being one of you because I'm one of them and they came from other places too I believe in individuals I believe that the prophet of God brought a brought a message a revelation to the bride of Christ and I believe that we as individuals have to receive that message and that Revelation as individuals God is not dealing with groups no God is not dealing with Collective revelation yes God is dealing with individuals church I can only be me these other preachers can only be who they are the prophet of God said when you're trying to be something you're not you've got a Hollywood Spirit sure brother you ask anybody that knows me for the past 40 Years brother this is me I don't care what church I preach in I don't care who your pastor is I'm G to be me come on hallu you know people always take that Hollywood Spirit they always take that to mean that if you're quiet and Mild mannered and you get happy and Shout that you're trying to be something you're not not but it works two ways sometimes those who are allowed like me we can't be something we're not we don't want a Hollywood spirit either all right let's get back to the message church is this all right this morning you've got some real good Christian gentlemanly preachers in this audience and if you know if this is not what you want I'll step down right now and you can call one of them up to finish this message but I can only be me the prophet of God tells this story he said one one day an old colored man that lived down the lane from me he used to come and talk to me all the time he came down one time and he said by the way for you people with iPads this is from the message to whom would we go preached in chiaka Ohio he said old man came to me one day the old colored man and he said you believe in that shouting kind of religion don't you Billy brother random said yes sir I sure do he said this old colored man was about 90 years old next morning he come by again he said I want to tell you something Billy I said all right what is it Reb he said well I'll tell you he said you know Billy you can take an old rooster you can put him in a box you can tie his feet down you can nail him down to that box you can do anything any way you want to but he says when it gets daylight that old rooster is going to turn over and crow that old rooster is going to stand up and go look at them translators back there trying to translate that yes sir brother when it gets to be daylight that old [Music] [Applause] rooster a listen I know I'm embarrassing some of you I'm May embarrassing my wife I don't know but I'm having myself a Time he said that old rooster is going to get up and Crow brother vandham said he said I said that's right Reb then brother vom said then I got excited the old colored man said what makes that rooster do that Billy brother brandom said he's a rooster it's breaking day that's his nature his nature is to Crow when the light comes on and he said when a man is born of the spirit of God and when he has eternal life down inside him when the Holy Ghost comes he's got to scream out he's got to Crow something like that old rooster when you get the Holy Ghost now it may come in different forms but when you get to Holy Ghost we're going to hear you going hallu sometimes I wonder how many people in the message really have the Holy Ghost he said there's a nature inside of you that makes you scream out I didn't say it Church don't look hey don't blame me there's a man that asked me to come right there blame him [Applause] now I've told you about two John's this morning I want to tell you about another John now we're talking about the power of praise amen and what it'll bring you to amen you can read it in Revelation 1-10 this one is John the Revelator we're told that John was in the spirit on the Lord's day now church I don't know what your Revelation is but the Lord's day is this day John was transported over to this day this age we are living in the Lord's day we are living in the Lord's age we are living in the bride age we are living in the Rapture age we're living in the Judgment age we're living in the coming of the Lord age and this is the day that John would transported over to amen this day is the bride's day this is the day that all the great men in the Bible and all the great Patriarchs and Prophets of old long to see the prophet of God said if you would give those old Patriarchs their choice of what age they would live in they would choose this age because this is the age of the greatest overcoming did you know the Bible says they overcame by their testimony by their blood of the lamb and their testimony church if there's an area of your life that you're not overcoming there's nothing wrong with the blood it must be your testimony thank you God bless you you need a testimony amen if you're going to be an overcomer am you need a testimony amen John was transported over to this day the Bible says now John was in the spirit brother brandom says the first thing to do church is to get in the spirit that's what we're preaching about today he said how is revelation going to come if we don't ever get into the spirit how are you going to get the Holy Ghost if you don't get into the spirit Hallelujah church as I said before we don't come to church just to come to church we come to church to have church some of the black people down in North Carolina and South Carolina they say it like this we come having chch is that right brother Brian we having Chet I I I just never did understand that but but they're happy you know in the message patmas Vision I love quotes don't you the message Fatma Vision preached in Jeffersonville now listen I don't know yeah brother Ram says when you was a sinner and you went to a dance you got in the spirit of that dance he said oh my you started Clapping Your Hands you started patting your feet and you started started Shin digging and throwing your hat on the floor and going around and around and acting silly that's what the prophet said he said you was in the spirit of the dance amen he said could you imagine a fella going to a dance just sitting down on all the time and saying well looks like you all are having a pretty good time he said his friends would say hey buddy get out of here that's right you're just an old Wallflower or he said you go to a ball game and somebody knocks a home run in the baseball game or we could say kick a goal in the soccer game and you sit down and you say that's pretty good he said no no you wouldn't be a real sports fan that's right because when somebody hits a home run or some kicks a goal you're going to stand up you're going to jump and you're going to holler hooray Whoopi hallu he said you're going to jump and you're going to knock somebody's hat off their head brother and he said you know the funny thing is when you do that nobody says a word to you William Marian brandom said these things but he said then you go to church and when somebody raises up and jumps up and runs down the aisle and says Glory Hallelujah praise the Lord he said somebody will turn around and say you Holy Roller you're just an old Holy Roller Oh my he said I'm going to ask you a question If We Are Holy Rollers because we do that he said then them other people speaking against us they must be Unholy rollers life is full of choices brother Tim you can choose to be a Holy Roller Glory or you can choose to be an Unholy roller I'm a Holy Roller I'm not an Unholy [Applause] [Music] [Applause] roller God bless you Brothers brother random said now John was in the spirit on the aisle of patmas he said he got in the spirit now we're talking about the power of praise and where it'll lead you he said John got in the spirit then things began to take place when John got in there he heard a trumpet sound brother brand says now trumpet always announces the approaching of something or somebody important like when a king is approaching they'll always sound your trumpet when King Jesus comes he'll sound a trumpet is that right he says when Joseph went forth they sounded the trumpet and now something's coming is that right John got in the spirit and he heard a trumpet he heard a trumpet and he turned to look to see what was behind him but he heard the trumpet after he got in the spirit church I'm trying to take you someplace this morning some of you don't want to go there that's okay he said I believe John was dancing and jumping and running all around that Island he said there was nothing there but Cactus and sand and snakes and scorpions but he says John was having a good time he was in the spirit he was having a good time in the St Spirit he was just praising God because that's exactly what happened when the spirit fell on them on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell on them they staggered like drunk men and women and they acted like they were drunk and they were jabbering and they were carrying on till the people said these people are full of new wine oh here comes a hard here comes a hard part he said those people are full of new wine he said if that's the way they acted the First Time come on now come on when the spirit come comes again he'll probably act the same way he said there's nothing new about this message he says this is an oldtime religion [Applause] I by the way are you still holding my mule this morning still in the patmas vision brother said John was in the spirit on the Lord's day he was transferred transferred from the aisle in the spirit over into the Lord's day as soon as he got over to the Lord's day he heard a trumpet it's somebody approaching a great one is approaching let me just stop there and give you a little test have your seats brother few years ago I was invited to go to a pro-life seminar in a big denominational church and this whole seminar was speakers all day of course speaking against abortion and speaking for life of the babies and I heard many different speeches and and a little uh lessons that day but one thing stuck with me one speaker was speaking she says you know it's amazing here in the US she says when Moses was a baby the Pharaoh represented the government of that day right and she said the Pharaoh ordered that all the babies be killed now why did he do that he did did that BEC because he heard there was a king coming there was somebody coming to usurp his throne so he ordered all the babies to be killed he said in the days of Jesus when he was a baby he said Herod represented the government and said Herod heard that there was a king going to be born so he ordered that all the babies be killed he said I think our US government is afraid because they know that there's a king coming and he said through the government they're sponsoring the abortions of millions and millions of baby in our country every year he said I believe our government is fearful that somebody's going to come and put them out of a job you know I believe there's some truth to that they don't know what they're doing millions of babies being aborted every year brother random says the greatest of all Revelations is the deity the Supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ he said you can't get to first base until you believe the greatest of all Revelations the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ he said now let's get back to John he said be careful John you've entered into the spirit something's going to be revealed to you what is it a trumpet sounding the first thing I'm Alpha and Omega the first of all Revelations brother bam stops and says oh sinner bow repent now before the time is too late in the middle of his sermon I think it's good advice for this morning if you're here this morning don't wait till the end of the service bow right now and repent it's a late hour who is this that's approaching this is King Jesus this is King God this is King Holy Ghost he said I'm all of it from A to Z I'm the beginning and the ending I'm the alpha and the Omega I am the immortal Eternal one still brother brandom he says all right the first of all Revelations is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ you must know who he is when you hear that voice and it's that same voice that sounded on Mount Sinai the same voice that sounded on Mount Transfiguration the same one like un to the son of man he said repent now before it's too late brother random said I have come not to tell you that he is coming but I have come to tell you that he is here now church he is here this morning he's here in this congregation but he's here in this age he's here in this bright age the last of of all ages it's what brother brandham talked about it's not an eighth age but it's that age within an age and you and I are privileged to believe and to be living in that age within an age you know there was a big deal one time made about uh made about what brother brandom said it'll all be over 19 he said I predict it'll be all over by 1977 and you know we've looked at that and as preachers we've studied that and we've debated that and talked about that and discussed that but a few years ago I got a little bit different revelation of it now he said I predict it'll all be over he didn't say exactly what would be over but I went out to brother George's place out in Tucson there the the den where they where they have brother randoms den and they had one of brother bbes brother Brandon's Bibles laying on a table there and in the fly leaf of his Bible you'll find this interesting in the fly leaf of his Bible he had written Le Odyssey in church age 1906 to 1977 so when he said it'll all be I predict it'll all be over what was he talking about could he have been talking about the leay oysan church age church I don't know about you now we know that the world is still in the leodys and church age but I believe there's a group of people they are no longer in Le oia they are in the bride age I believe that the bride age had to start somewhere around 1977 I'm not making it a Doctrine I'm just saying it could be yes amen but we know yes the prophet of God didn't make any mistakes if he said it something he he had to mean something by it church and my time is drawing short but church we just be praising God he is worthy to be praised and I said as I said at this I'm not look I'm not promoting a bunch of worked up emotion or pumped up and I don't even believe in that I don't believe in that at all I'm just talking about you as an individual praising God and everybody has a different personality and everybody can praise God differently everybody don't act crazy like I do and I can I know people I know sisters little sisters little humble sisters in the church and they'll stand and they'll praise God and they'll never make a sound they'll have tears running down their eyes some brother will be standing there he won't say a word he'll just have his hands up in the air crying weeping that's his praising God don't mistake this this morning amen I'm not after a bunch of noise I I'm not promoting a bunch of uh emotion no now the way I delivered is the way I have to deliver because I'm very emotional that's right but some of these brothers they're not that emot they can deliver the same thing that's right and never have all this drama that I have amen but this is me this is how I choose to praise God if I'm in a church service and I get happy I'm gonna shout if I'm in a church service and they sing a song that strikes my heart I'm gonna [Music] [Applause] dance and if I feel like running in church I'm going to run but everybody's not like me thank God they're not we'd have chaos in our churches and when you're doing it to be a part of a collective group because you want to be one of the group you're wrong you're just as wrong as you're going to be but if you're doing it because the spirit of God has moved on your heart then I say go ahead and do it I think sometimes s when we come to church we ought to hand hand all of our mules over to the deacons at the front door let them hold them so we can be free to praise [Music] God better yet just tie your mules up on the outside so the deacons can praise God too now in St John the 2 chapter the 1st through 11 verses we know that Jesus's real Ministry started with its first miracle in turning the water into the wine now he said I am the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end see we all know this message this message this message it's just the continuation of this message it's not a different message the same Ministry that saw the alpha portion of it and the Lord Jesus is day is the same Ministry with the Omega part of it today is that right the son of man ministry that's started with a wedding in canaa in that day ends with a wedding in this day it's the marriage of the bridegroom and the bride and church contrary to what you may have been taught the marriage happens on this side of the Rapture that's right right right it starts with you receiving the Holy Ghost it starts with you receiving the new birth and what is the New Birth the prophet said the new birth is receiving the revealed word for your day that's the new birth and it finishes at the wedding supper of the Lamb on the other side of the Rapture the same God that turned the water into wine in canaa in that day today is the same God who turns the water of the written word into the wine of re Revelation today are you with me this morning so are you drinking the wine this morning amen praise the Lord keep drinking my sister keep drinking my brother for the Rapture is just a revelation let's all get so drunk on the revelation of the word that it'll be revealed to us that we are at the wedding Feast let's just keep praising God the message to home would we go brother random said I believe that that good old time heartfelt salvation brings tears of joy and happiness and peace that passes all understanding he says I just can't praise him enough and say enough about him and what he means to me it's a nature in you when you are born of the spirit of God you've got a nature to make you scream out like that old rooster see the picture message same message brother brandom says now listen this is what he says you can look it up he said Jesus was riding into town one time on a mule that's right now the Bible says he was riding into town on an ass but brother brandom said he was riding into town one time on a mule the people were all hollering and shouting making noise and said there were some old Pharisees that were walking with Jesus and one of them turned toward Jesus and said these people shouting and yelling like that said that's terrible so that makes cold chills run up and down my spine he said those are your people why don't you make them hold their peace this is brother Brandon he said the old Pharisees said why don't you make him shut up he said Jesus turned to that old Pharisee and said if the hold their peace my God God the Rocks would immediately cry out what were those people doing they were praising God and watering their seed I believe there are some rocks here today I believe you've come into the message I believe that you have walked in these doors and you have stayed because someone that was sitting here previously they did not praise God they did not shout out they did not water their seed and their seed withered and died hallu let the musicians come back I've held you long enough the message to whom would we go brother brandom said an old colored sister here not long ago was giv a testimony and many of you have heard it and they'd been making fun of her and they would say oh you ain't nothing she said you know she said that might be true but there's one thing I want to say said I ain't what I ought to be and I hate what I want to be but there's one thing I know that I hate what I used to be and brother B said I think that's a good thing when we get to the point where we can see where we hate what we used to be that's where each and every one of us ought to be what was that old sister doing she was standing up to give praise for what God had done for her why don't we all stand up this morning why don't we give God praise in your own way saying if there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins just for a couple minutes in your own way you don't have to say a word you don't have to shout you don't have to run you don't have to dance but if you want to you can but just praise God in your own [Applause] way Lord with thank you tonight God I thank you for this group of people here Lord in this little Campground Lord in Germany Lord I believe you foreordained it from the foundation of the world Lord I Thank you for each and every saint in this place I thank you Lord for every Minister every man of God Lord I Thank you for every song that's sung Lord for every word that's spoken I thank you for your people I thank you Lord that you've allowed us to come and be a part of what you've ordained from

it's the name of Jesus that lifts us up when life tears us down lord we love you this morning we praise your name this morning hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah church this is the most glorious gospel that's ever been known we need to praise God in our own way everybody's different you may not show any anything on the outside that's okay some may jump some may shout some may just stand and cry important thing your heart has melted and you want to praise God for [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it [Music] H [Music] H one more little quote I want you to listen brother brandom said now listen I want you young people to listen to this when I was a little boy we didn't have many clothes and we used to dare each other who would be the last one to jump in the hole of water in the Old Pond we'd all run back out to the old swimming hole and he said I can tell you something he said I'll tell you one thing he said I was I was always the first one in the old water hole because I had the least clothes to take off he said all I own was a pair of overalls and it had an old fod string with a nail in it to hold it up he said that's all I had he said yes sir he said I'd run we'd all be running each of them had to take off their shoes and their socks and their shirts and their undershirts but he said I didn't have those things I didn't have to fool with those things he said I would just run as hard as I could and then I'd pull the nail in that old string and those old overalls would drop off and he said I jump in the old swimming pool he said I always beat my friends I was always the first one in and he said it got to the point where they would all depend on me to find out how the water was I think we're still dependent on him to find out how the water is don't you think so this [Applause] morning he said I jump in that water and he [Music] said he said if I held up one finger that meant it was cold don't come in yet boys take your time but he said if I held up two fingers that meant that the water was fine come on in boys and he said then the clothes would start flying off them boys and he said they would be jumping in the old swimming hole from everywhere and I want to tell you young people here today if you are here and you've never received the new birth if you've never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm holding up two fingers the water of the word is fine this morning come on in I invite you to jump in the old swimming hole this morning the old swimming hole of the Holy Ghost it won't hurt you it'll do you good it'll give you strength it'll give you power and that Holy Ghost is like your own personal radar and when you get offline a little bit in your life it'll pull you back on [Music] track two fingers now you don't have to come to this altar you can do it in your heart right where you stand but if you have a some some sort of a little seed of the word of God down inside you water that seed with your praise and watch how God will work in your life watch how fast that seed can grow maybe many of you here many of you young people here you've been to youth's camps you've been to youth Banquets you've been to youth meetings you've been to youth pizza parties and somewhere along the line you've got a little bit of a seed down inside you and all you need to do is to make that seed grow I'm telling you young people if you learn to praise God that seed will grow you know I grew up and we're going to we're going to take the next session maybe and talk about a few of the testimonies I knew or experienced growing up in the random Tabernacle but you know even though I grew up there it was a few years later when I really met the Lord and I can remember when the Lord started dealing with my heart brother random was done gone he was done off the scene and I'd go to a message church and I'd sit there and they'd be singing be praying they'd be shouting and I was pretty quiet but I'd go back a few more services and I'd go back a few more services and I noticed one day [Music] oh I've been studying the message I've been reading the books of the things that I had seen when I was there and I'd read something in those books or listen to those tapes and I'd go to church and the preacher would say the same thing and I found myself praise God real quiet you know real quiet praise God you know and after a few more services I found myself praise God and after a few more services Hallelujah and after a few more services I'd stand up and say hallelujah Church in no time at all my seed began to grow and now as they say down in South America where I preached a lot Kenny Caps or Mano Kenny he's local for kristo crazy for Christ but I'm just telling you young people you've got a seed down inside you listen God put you in the home and God put you in the family that you was ordained to grow up in don't take it lightly he put you in that family for a reason and that reason is because you're an elected seat of God Amen and you can come hard or you can come easy God has never lost a one I encourage you young people in your own way when you go back to your churches find a way to praise God don't just sit there find a way to praise God if it's nothing else just raise your hand God will use that if it's nothing else just shake the hand of the pastor as you go out God will use that whatever you feel to do and whatever God puts on your heart amen well we could say many more things come on brother Paul let's [Music] sing right here sing Jesus
