[39:22] down to worship before the feet of the
[39:24] angel which showed me these things then
[39:28] saith he unto me see thou do it not
[39:31] for i am thy fellow servant one and of

[40:13] the end the first and the last blessed
[40:15] are they that do his commandments that
[40:18] they may have right to the tree of life
[40:21] and may enter in through the gates of
[40:23] the city for without or for outside are
[40:26] dogs and sorcerers and hormones and
[40:29] murderers and idolaters and whosoever
[40:32] loveth and maketh a lie
[40:34] i jesus have sent mine angel to testify
[40:38] unto you these things in the churches i
[40:41] am the root and the offspring of david

[40:53] whosoever will let him take the water of
[40:55] life freely may the lord have a blessing
[40:57] to the reading of his word you may be
[40:59] seated this morning
[41:01] blessed be the name of the lord thank
[41:03] you those who made it out this morning's
[41:06] weather last night i told my wife i
[41:08] looked up to make sure the roof was
[41:09] still there the rains and the wind and
[41:12] we know what what it is it's not the
[41:14] storm it's not the weather forecast you
[41:15] know what is it it's the whole creation
[41:17] groaning
[41:18] the whole of nature groaning and
[41:20] travailing because the the the groaning
[41:23] for sons to come back into position
[41:26] so the whole of nature the trees the
[41:28] animals the winds they know that
[41:31] something is not right and man coming
[41:33] back into position is what will make it
[41:35] right so if you are not crying out for a
[41:37] restoration of the sons of god the trees
[41:40] are crying out and the winds are crying
[41:43] out nature knows better than our
[41:45] politicians hallelujah the winds no
[41:48] better than the scientists because they
[41:49] know that when a man of god is in
[41:52] position then things are in order the
[41:54] devil loves disorder and chaos but when
[41:56] sons of god are in position then all is
[41:59] well can the church say amen and this
[42:01] great mystery this great message this
[42:04] great scripture we read is all about
[42:06] getting us back into position to get us
[42:08] back into order to take us from
[42:10] misunderstanding and not understanding
[42:13] and darkness and ignorance and not
[42:15] knowing to a place where you know that
[42:17] you know that you know that your
[42:19] confidence and your faith does not rest
[42:21] in man but your confidence and faith
[42:23] rest in the word of the living god
[42:26] because heaven and earth will pass away
[42:28] but this word that we preach this word
[42:30] that we believe this word that we hold

[44:30] heed and takes to heart and remembers oh
[44:33] hallelujah so every service we come to
[44:36] it's to help us keep
[44:38] the sayings of this book
[44:40] not my sayings not brother over chains
[44:43] not anybody's sayings but the sayings of
[44:46] the book because a saint of the book
[44:48] will withstand time and break you into
[44:50] eternity the sayings of this book will
[44:53] reach you in the hospital room the
[44:56] sayings of this book it is because of
[44:58] this book and the sayings of this book
[45:01] we could have faith this morning to call
[45:03] for a revival it is because of this book
[45:06] and the sayings of this book
[45:09] god said so i believe it and that
[45:12] settles it can the church see amen
[45:16] many people keep all kinds of stuff they
[45:18] keep something that their father told
[45:20] them they keep something their grandma
[45:22] told them they keep something the
[45:24] politician said they keep something they
[45:26] read in a book somewhere where
[45:27] shakespeare said this and this is what
[45:29] he said in his book but what about this
[45:31] book i'm speaking about this morning
[45:33] because this book says things
[45:37] and notice
[45:39] and this is so relevant to us it is not
[45:42] blessed is he that keeping the writings
[45:44] of this book
[45:47] so it's not the letter of the thing it's
[45:49] the sayings of the book so it has to
[45:52] move from the written
[45:53] to being expressed or anybody with me
[45:56] this morning you remember when that man
[45:58] came to the prophet and he was blind
[46:01] and when he got prayed for he went back
[46:03] home
[46:04] and he said my eyes didn't open so he
[46:06] came back to the prophet what did the
[46:08] prophet say to him i prayed for you
[46:09] already you already healed but your
[46:12] faith hasn't connected to the sayings of
[46:14] the book because the book has a saying
[46:17] that covers your situation so i need to
[46:19] connect your situation to a saying in
[46:22] the book we've got to find something to
[46:25] connect to in the book if we cannot
[46:27] connect to a saying in the book you're
[46:29] not going to get your healing so i want
[46:31] you to leave church today and say by
[46:33] stripes i'm healed because that's a
[46:35] saying anybody with me this morning
[46:37] that's in the book and that man he went
[46:40] to work oh he went to work and he said
[46:43] by stripes i'm healed by stripes i'm
[46:45] healed up and he started to do what he
[46:47] didn't realize he was doing but he was
[46:50] keeping the saiyans of the book
[46:52] and a blessing followed him because he
[46:55] was keeping the saints of the book and
[46:58] one day by stripes i'm healed by stripes
[47:00] i'm healed by stripes i'm healed by
[47:02] stripes i'm healed one day his eyes pop
[47:05] open he was blessed because he kept the
[47:08] saiyans off the book
[47:11] anybody with me this morning
[47:13] hallelujah
[47:15] anybody with me this morning what are
[47:17] the sayings you are keeping what sayings
[47:20] are you holding on to is it the word of
[47:23] your neighbor is it the word of the
[47:24] doctor is it the word of something you
[47:26] read or is it the same of the book
[47:29] because it's a blessing
[47:33] [Applause]
[47:36] simple message this morning a bible
[47:39] study this morning an encouragement this
[47:41] morning but i believe this morning i'm
[47:43] speaking to keepers
[47:45] defenders
[47:47] protectors
[47:48] guardians of the scenes of this book i
[47:51] don't want it flavored differently i
[47:54] want to keep the scenes of the book the
[47:56] way the book says oh come on somebody
[47:58] help me this morning i don't want a
[48:00] watered down version of the scenes of
[48:02] the book i don't want your
[48:04] interpretation of the sayings of the
[48:06] book i'm a keeper
[48:08] of the sayings of this book oh that's my
[48:10] testimony that's my walk that's my talk
[48:14] if this book says i'm gonna have a
[48:16] revival i'm keeping that same if this
[48:19] book says my sons and my daughters all
[48:22] gonna be delivered they're gonna
[48:23] prophesy i'll pour my spirit go take
[48:27] this gospel into the whole world
[48:31] it is for you and for your children
[48:34] that's a saying in the book i i don't
[48:36] want to leave it written in the book i
[48:38] want to say it so my children got to
[48:40] come my children got to come there's a
[48:43] saying in the book says be there for
[48:44] perfect as your father in heaven is
[48:47] perfect i don't want to leave it as a
[48:49] writing in the book i want to be a sayer
[48:52] of what is in the book
[48:57] somebody gave god a shout out praise
[49:00] [Applause]
[49:11] behold
[49:12] i come quickly
[49:14] blessed is he that keepeth the scenes of
[49:17] the prophecy of this book people hold on
[49:20] to all kinds of stuff
[49:23] their interpretation their idea their
[49:27] vision their perspective their opinion
[49:33] the amount of things we say that's not
[49:35] in the bible that we call to be in the
[49:36] bible
[49:45] hallelujah and it's so subtle
[49:50] we sing the song let the week say i am
[49:52] strongly under poor say i am rich
[49:54] where's the poor i'm rich part that part
[49:58] i'm not saying that the poor can't say
[50:00] original
[50:01] but when we get down into the science
[50:04] of seeing what the tape says
[50:06] into the science of saying what the
[50:08] bible says and finding what god says
[50:11] concerning you because even jesus had to
[50:13] keep the sayings of the book
[50:15] when jesus started to get into his
[50:17] ministry he had to go back to the book
[50:20] to find the writing and he has to now
[50:22] make it into a saying by saying the
[50:24] spirit of the lord is upon me he was not
[50:26] reading or writing he was beginning to
[50:28] express the writing as a saying the
[50:31] spirit of the lord is upon me they
[50:33] thought he was reading and writing but
[50:35] he was actually making a declaration
[50:38] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[50:41] for he has anointed me and listen
[50:44] to his they totally reading but he
[50:45] making a saying and then this day this
[50:48] scripture is fulfilled it's no longer
[50:50] writing it is now a saying it is now a
[50:53] declaration i have found where it is
[50:56] written concerning me and because i have
[50:58] found it i could stand firmly on the
[51:01] promise of god and no devil no demon no
[51:04] doubt no spirit no principality no
[51:08] sickness nothing could stop these
[51:10] saiyans these saiyans have defeated the
[51:12] devil every time
[51:14] every place under any condition
[51:24] it's more important to keep the sails
[51:27] than to keep your job
[51:29] it's more important to keep the saiyans
[51:32] than to keep your friends
[51:34] it's more important to keep these
[51:36] saiyans than to keep your reputation
[51:39] it's more important to keep these
[51:41] sayings that they keep your phone and to
[51:43] keep your bank card because these saints
[51:45] could put food on your table i've never
[51:48] seen the righteous peg bread i have
[51:50] never these saiyans could put food on
[51:52] your table these shears could take you
[51:55] through when you're in a storm
[52:03] are you accessing the blessings
[52:06] of the sayings of this book
[52:10] what words are coming out of your mouth
[52:11] what are the sayings that people know
[52:13] you for
[52:16] when people say one thing brother
[52:18] so-and-so says is x y and z what are the
[52:20] sayings that are always the first thing
[52:22] that you see
[52:29] we are connecting back to words and the
[52:31] power of words but more than that
[52:34] what good is it to be in the message
[52:36] what good is it to be a christian and
[52:38] you're not keeping the sayings
[52:41] of the book
[52:42] because the whole point of the book is
[52:44] to bring us into an understanding and a
[52:47] realization of who god is and his
[52:49] thoughts and intents and how he
[52:50] expressed it in a word form so that it
[52:54] could pass through the test of time and
[52:56] reach to us in 2021 that these words
[52:59] country now transform back to spoken
[53:02] word
[53:03] these written words can once more become
[53:05] saiyans
[53:07] become prophecy
[53:09] because the testimony of jesus is the
[53:11] spirit of prophecy can the church see
[53:14] amen
[53:15] [Music]
[53:16] behold i come quickly we are still here
[53:18] in the scripture we'll see how far we
[53:20] get to this morning blessed is he that
[53:22] keep it the scenes of the prophecy of
[53:24] this book i'm not trying to keep church
[53:27] i'm not trying to keep membership i'm
[53:29] not trying to keep my no no no no no no
[53:31] we are fighting this is earnestly
[53:33] contending right here
[53:35] hallelujah for the saiyans
[53:38] of the prophecy of this book that's why
[53:40] brother said last week i listened back
[53:42] to the message that's why he said listen
[53:44] if you preach i'm messing and there's no
[53:45] promise
[53:46] no promise of revival no promise of
[53:48] deliverance no promise of manifestation
[53:50] of the sons of god these promises are
[53:52] prophecy and these prophecies are
[53:54] promises
[53:57] that give us access to the divine nature
[53:59] of god that deed by these precious
[54:01] promises not by what so-and-so said
[54:06] we need to kill our ideas
[54:09] and focus on the sayings
[54:11] of the book
[54:14] but abraham had to find a saying amen
[54:18] malachi 4 516. if that wasn't there the
[54:20] prophet doesn't have a platform
[54:24] to keep the saiyans you have to know the
[54:27] sayings
[54:28] you can't keep what you don't know
[54:31] imagine you are you are a security guard
[54:32] and anywhere you're working tomorrow and
[54:35] and report for 9am and nobody tells you
[54:37] where you have to keep
[54:39] your recent work and you know what to do
[54:41] you don't know nobody's to give you your
[54:43] assignment
[54:46] well what am i supposed to god i don't
[54:48] know yet
[54:49] you have nothing to guard
[54:51] but if you have to keep the saying then
[54:52] the sayings to you must become more
[54:54] precious than anything else
[54:58] so the challenge for us now in this age
[55:01] where knowledge has increased
[55:04] and people finding time to pursue all
[55:06] kind of extracurricular knowledge
[55:08] acquisition
[55:10] they want to learn about this the one
[55:12] they find it was that's the age we're
[55:14] living in you know
[55:16] how this work and why this is so and
[55:17] what is happening with this and you know
[55:19] you read this you read this but they
[55:21] can't give you sayings
[55:24] they don't know what the book says
[55:28] and because they don't even know what
[55:30] the book says they can't keep the
[55:32] saiyans of the prophecy of this book
[55:36] anybody with me
[55:37] this is the key the key to unlock you
[55:41] not backsliding
[55:44] because you can be living in the sayings
[55:46] and working to keep it and find yourself
[55:48] doing foolishness
[55:51] because when you start to connect to the
[55:53] sayings and see all that god has
[55:55] expressed in his word that we are
[55:56] supposed to live now and you now make it
[55:59] your business to keep it
[56:03] you're making your business to pray
[56:04] because prayer is in the word
[56:06] and you're keeping the sayings of the
[56:09] book
[56:11] so you can't live a day without praying
[56:13] you can't when god told joshua this book
[56:16] of the lord shall not depart from you
[56:19] but meditate on this thing day and night
[56:21] so you could have good success
[56:23] all through scripture it has been about
[56:25] keeping
[56:26] the saiyans
[56:28] of the book
[56:34] can the church say man i don't know just
[56:36] helping anybody this morning but
[56:38] how are you fought if how do you keep
[56:40] something
[56:41] how do you keep us saying alive
[56:44] hallelujah are you practicing the saying
[56:46] are you exercising these muscles of fate
[56:49] to keep saying what you're supposed to
[56:51] say
[56:52] do you if you if you are ceasing this
[56:54] mountain move have you have you tried to
[56:55] speak to situations
[56:58] look at david david said goliath i'll
[56:59] cop you cut your head off
[57:02] because david understood what he was
[57:04] standing on
[57:05] he understood the promises that were
[57:07] given that wherever you put your foot is
[57:09] yours he could rest on saying
[57:14] when jesus was there in the wilderness
[57:16] being tested
[57:19] the devil come and attack him
[57:21] take this tuna cassidy into into bread
[57:24] what did jesus say he went and pulled us
[57:26] in
[57:28] he said it is written
[57:31] swing
[57:33] the devil come again it is also written
[57:37] what was he doing keeping the scenes of
[57:40] the book
[57:41] because he knows that if he keeps the
[57:43] saints of the book the devil himself
[57:44] have to back up
[57:46] jesus could have used power he could
[57:48] have god could have sent angels but this
[57:49] was to demonstrate to you the power of
[57:52] the word
[57:53] and the power of you applying the
[57:55] sayings of this book to your life to
[57:58] your situation not what your mama said
[58:00] not what your wife said not what the
[58:02] doctor says not what the neighbor says
[58:04] not what anybody says but the sayings of
[58:06] the book
[58:07] is what will bring back your children
[58:09] your faith connected to the scene of the
[58:11] book is what will give you the baptism
[58:13] of the holy ghost because the promise is
[58:15] unto you and to your children and to
[58:18] them that are foul do you know that
[58:20] saying are you keeping that saying
[58:23] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[58:25] lord oh blessed be in the name of the
[58:28] lord i feel good this morning
[58:31] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[58:36] hallelujah oh hallelujah arise shine for
[58:40] thy light has come oh and his glory will
[58:43] be seen upon thee do you know that
[58:45] saying are you keeping that saying is
[58:48] your light shining hallelujah blessed
[58:51] peter name of the lord when david said i
[58:53] was glad when they said unto me let us
[58:55] go into the house of the lord that
[58:57] became a saying it was a declaration is
[58:59] that your saying are you keeping that
[59:01] same when last have you said i was glad
[59:04] when they said unto me let us go into
[59:06] the house of the lord you know if you
[59:07] wake up feeling cranky and the first
[59:09] thing you say on a sunday morning is i
[59:11] was glad when they said unto me let us
[59:14] go to the house of the lord you know
[59:15] your cells and your molecules and the
[59:18] fibers in your body begin to line up
[59:20] right because you're saying it was the
[59:23] word that put the earth in place it was
[59:26] the word that put the sun in place it
[59:28] was the word that put animals here do
[59:30] you know the power of your words do you
[59:32] understand why this is not what is
[59:35] written but what is spoken what are you
[59:37] declaring this morning what is your
[59:40] declaration this morning
[59:43] i know who i am oh hallelujah
[59:48] oh blessed be the name of the lord oh
[59:50] hallelujah
[59:55] so we have a couple things in there just
[59:57] to share with you encourage you this
[59:58] morning
[59:59] yeah people who don't know the sayings
[1:00:02] that's one problem
[1:00:03] then you have people who know the same
[1:00:05] but they don't keep it
[1:00:10] and the two have to come together
[1:00:13] you need to know your promises
[1:00:16] and you have to guard it
[1:00:17] what did they say thy word have i hid
[1:00:21] hid in my heart
[1:00:23] that i might sin not
[1:00:26] are you guarding this world in your
[1:00:27] heart are you are you making sure and
[1:00:29] you protect it from all kind of attack
[1:00:31] and negative thoughts and the worldly
[1:00:33] music and distraction and envy and lust
[1:00:36] and laziness you know laziness is is
[1:00:39] actually a sin
[1:00:42] i need to do a bible study on that
[1:00:46] laziness is the synonym
[1:00:48] anybody say look at the ant look at the
[1:00:50] animal look at the insects who gets in
[1:00:52] up and working
[1:01:06] oh good let me just turn back and finish
[1:01:08] sleep and hope when i wake up you go on
[1:01:11] and what is it it is not a literal
[1:01:12] figure like
[1:01:14] it's situations that could hinder you
[1:01:16] that you allowing you're making excuses
[1:01:21] you're making an excuse for inaction why
[1:01:24] didn't you pray this morning
[1:01:27] why didn't you pray yesterday did you
[1:01:29] meditate on the word yesterday morning
[1:01:31] and night
[1:01:32] as god instructed joshua meditate on the
[1:01:34] word day and night so you could have
[1:01:36] good success so don't come to me and
[1:01:38] talk to me about you're not successful
[1:01:40] if you're not doing what he said to do
[1:01:41] to be successful anybody with me
[1:01:44] you want the key to success meditate on
[1:01:46] the word day and night and you'll have
[1:01:48] success that's the one formula oh you
[1:01:51] don't hear me this morning you want
[1:01:53] spiritual success meditate on the word
[1:01:56] day and night once you do that you can't
[1:01:58] ever come to church feeling down
[1:02:01] you can't come to church feeling well i
[1:02:03] feel pressure i feel like i fight i feel
[1:02:05] like no no no no no because the word is
[1:02:07] your source the word is your sustenance
[1:02:09] and you are a keeper of the saiyans of
[1:02:12] this book
[1:02:20] and i john when verse 8 saw these things
[1:02:23] and heard them this scripture is very
[1:02:25] telling because what john is
[1:02:27] experiencing and he's articulating and
[1:02:29] explaining his mind is blown we already
[1:02:32] know it's john
[1:02:34] because john has introduced himself to
[1:02:36] earlier in the same book
[1:02:39] but he's making it clear to you this is
[1:02:41] not hearsay
[1:02:42] i john i didn't hear it from somebody
[1:02:45] else listen he said i saw these things
[1:02:48] and heard them
[1:02:50] so i just see it from a distant but i
[1:02:52] saw it i saw it first person i saw it
[1:02:55] and i heard it and when i had heard and
[1:02:58] seen you know how i am with scripture
[1:03:00] where these things are when i heard and
[1:03:02] saw
[1:03:03] so there's no question in my mind i'm
[1:03:05] not taking somebody's explanation of my
[1:03:08] conviction
[1:03:10] i'm not trusting nobody with my
[1:03:12] experience john is saying i saw this
[1:03:14] thing for myself
[1:03:16] i understand that there's a blessing
[1:03:20] for those who keep these things
[1:03:23] and when i heard and seen
[1:03:25] he is so blown away
[1:03:28] by what the angel had shown him and
[1:03:30] allowed him to hear anybody with me this
[1:03:32] morning
[1:03:33] when i had heard unseen i fell down to
[1:03:36] worship
[1:03:40] you see
[1:03:41] what the default position of when
[1:03:44] something happens in spiritually in life
[1:03:46] what the default is
[1:03:48] john didn't say i fell down and i sat to
[1:03:50] the right notes
[1:03:53] i fell down and a message came to me i
[1:03:56] fell long and a court came to me i fell
[1:03:59] down when i saw these things listen he
[1:04:01] saw and heard and his default
[1:04:05] i was sharing in a youth service a week
[1:04:07] ago i had the opportunity to speak for
[1:04:09] brother peter chandler's young people
[1:04:11] and i said listen what made david unique
[1:04:14] is whenever anything went wrong he went
[1:04:16] back to default settings
[1:04:18] you know when something goes wrong with
[1:04:19] your phone when you install things on
[1:04:21] your phone or a new app and your phone
[1:04:23] get all corrupted there's an option to
[1:04:25] re to reset the phone to default setting
[1:04:28] and default setting takes everything
[1:04:30] that you do and messed up bring it back
[1:04:32] to factory settings
[1:04:33] david's factory settings was a believer
[1:04:36] david's factory setting was his heart
[1:04:39] was leading to god
[1:04:40] and look at john john's factory setting
[1:04:43] was what worship
[1:04:46] what he heard and saw drove him to
[1:04:48] worship
[1:04:51] are you driven to worship do you find do
[1:04:52] you find reasons to worship god
[1:04:55] do you realize worship is not just about
[1:04:57] hearing the word and worship but when
[1:04:59] you see the wonders notice when i see
[1:05:02] the stars and
[1:05:03] then saying it's my soul i'm not a
[1:05:06] singer but you know the song
[1:05:07] when you wake up and yes you can look at
[1:05:09] the negativity look at the news but when
[1:05:11] you see the sun get up and nobody push
[1:05:13] it up there
[1:05:16] you know how much trouble you when if
[1:05:17] you wake up and the sun any sight to get
[1:05:19] up
[1:05:20] who put his son up this morning but a
[1:05:22] more than you imagine you wake up in the
[1:05:24] morning and the sun just decide today
[1:05:25] i'm not getting up
[1:05:28] but you don't have to do nothing with
[1:05:29] that and you walk and you can't find a
[1:05:32] reason to worship god
[1:05:38] i was by but a punch some some time ago
[1:05:40] i was talking about the vehicle on the
[1:05:42] car and different things and i say look
[1:05:44] at look at this thing here
[1:05:46] no matter how good people make
[1:05:49] after time you have to service it you
[1:05:51] have to tune it up you have to change
[1:05:52] your engine you have to change that
[1:05:54] alternator you have to change the
[1:05:55] battery and look how god could create a
[1:05:57] human body
[1:06:00] but appointed you have to come back in
[1:06:02] three months of service
[1:06:05] and to think that
[1:06:06] god gave a man time on this earth
[1:06:08] 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 70 years and and
[1:06:13] and you're not the one
[1:06:15] take your heart out you take on your
[1:06:16] chest you take out your lungs and every
[1:06:18] two months you have to go and service it
[1:06:20] man can't make a device yet that can
[1:06:22] last that long
[1:06:26] and god
[1:06:27] wake you up this morning you then wake
[1:06:30] yourself up and you can't worship god i
[1:06:32] don't care what went wrong in your life
[1:06:34] you want to tell me you don't have a
[1:06:36] reason to worship god
[1:06:39] that's why i can't understand people who
[1:06:40] claim to believe this message and they
[1:06:43] sit down want to process information
[1:06:45] without a revelation and john had all
[1:06:47] the revelation because it was seen to
[1:06:50] him and he went to worship oh give us
[1:06:52] some worshippers
[1:06:54] [Applause]
[1:06:56] the magnitude
[1:07:01] how blessed john was to see what he saw
[1:07:04] think of it
[1:07:06] to see and hear you have a many of us
[1:07:08] are a fraction of what god allowed john
[1:07:10] to see
[1:07:12] firsthand testimony and all john could
[1:07:15] do is just worship
[1:07:17] all john could do is worship blessing
[1:07:20] anonymity power oh dominion holy holy
[1:07:24] holy is the lord lord god
[1:07:26] almighty
[1:07:28] people want to sit in a messy with
[1:07:29] revelation and no worship you're going
[1:07:32] nowhere with that understanding and no
[1:07:34] worship you have nowhere to go
[1:07:36] information and no worship get out of
[1:07:38] here i would overturn last week you
[1:07:40] might as well get used to worship yeah
[1:07:42] you might as well get used to making
[1:07:44] noise here
[1:07:45] [Applause]
[1:07:47] because when john saw his name
[1:07:50] he said all in heaven all on the earth
[1:07:52] all under the earth heard me shouting
[1:07:55] heard me worshiping heard me praising
[1:07:58] god
[1:08:03] worship god this morning i don't care in
[1:08:06] your living room if you're in the
[1:08:07] kitchen if you're here in the house of
[1:08:09] god if you're watching this on the
[1:08:11] replay worship god
[1:08:13] worship god
[1:08:15] worship god worship god that's what
[1:08:19] makes him god he's the object of worship
[1:08:23] revelation drives you to worship.
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:34] i wanted deeper i wanted deeper
[1:08:37] and no worship keep and no testimony
[1:08:39] information and it's not sayings you
[1:08:41] have it you know it you know it but your
[1:08:42] life
[1:08:43] still envy still jealousy but when you
[1:08:46] said you just worship god you take it
[1:08:47] and just worship god worship takes away
[1:08:50] your thinking you know because worship
[1:08:52] has nothing to do with you
[1:08:54] worship has nothing to do with you
[1:08:57] worship to have got to do with your bank
[1:08:58] account the doctor your body your
[1:09:01] situation is just you talking about god
[1:09:04] it's not even talking about you it's
[1:09:06] lord you are worthy you are king of
[1:09:09] kings you are holy you are mighty and
[1:09:12] when god feels that from you when god
[1:09:16] senses that from you he can now pour out
[1:09:20] grace to you grace to your situation
[1:09:23] [Music]
[1:09:29] [Applause]
[1:09:40] we need to understand friends you may be
[1:09:42] seated
[1:09:43] i can't be too much longer we need to
[1:09:44] understand the distinction
[1:09:46] and the clear separation
[1:09:48] between who god is
[1:09:51] what he is and his attributes
[1:09:54] there is a difference
[1:09:56] because he was god before he expressed
[1:09:58] his attributes
[1:10:00] oh you don't hear me this morning what a
[1:10:02] friend we have in jesus is secondary to
[1:10:04] the fact that he is god
[1:10:07] oh you don't hear me this morning the
[1:10:09] fact that he's a healer is secondary to
[1:10:11] the fact that he is god because as god
[1:10:14] he had attributes he wanted to express
[1:10:17] he could not express them all at once it
[1:10:19] took the unfolding of time for the full
[1:10:22] expression of his attributes but he
[1:10:24] always was god
[1:10:27] [Applause]
[1:10:32] before he was a father he was god before
[1:10:34] he was a healer he was god or you never
[1:10:37] heard that like that before
[1:10:51] self-existing one
[1:10:53] he was god when the angels worshiped him
[1:10:56] he was god before he made man
[1:11:00] object of worship makes him god
[1:11:05] that is what the devil hated not his
[1:11:08] relationship as father or healer
[1:11:11] or we maker or his torah because there
[1:11:14] was nothing to restore yet
[1:11:17] but the fact that he was god and in fact
[1:11:19] he was getting worship when lucifer saw
[1:11:21] it and he saw what was happening because
[1:11:24] of worship to god he could tell us
[1:11:26] let's make the devil jealous this
[1:11:28] morning
[1:11:29] let us make the devil jealous this
[1:11:32] morning by worshiping god
[1:11:34] [Music]
[1:11:39] one of the biggest assaults you can
[1:11:41] launch against the enemy is just to
[1:11:43] worship god
[1:11:45] [Music]
[1:11:47] the biggest issue the devil has is when
[1:11:50] you worship god
[1:12:02] i'm in the message you're not in no
[1:12:03] message if you can worship god because
[1:12:06] it's god's message hallelujah oh come on
[1:12:10] now somebody preach back to me
[1:12:12] we are the worshippers
[1:12:14] jesus said the hour cometh and now is up
[1:12:17] where the true worshipers will worship
[1:12:20] the father in spirit and in truth
[1:12:31] [Applause]
[1:12:38] hallelujah
[1:12:40] no more excuses
[1:12:41] no more excuses
[1:12:43] he deserves a worship
[1:12:45] no more excuses he deserves the worship
[1:12:49] he deserves the worst shepherd he
[1:12:51] deserves the worst shepherd he deserves
[1:12:53] the worshiper
[1:13:00] i'm not going to be too much longer
[1:13:06] and i john saw these things
[1:13:09] and heard them
[1:13:14] have you seen have you not seen enough
[1:13:17] have you not heard enough
[1:13:19] over the years for you to be a worshiper
[1:13:22] have you not seen enough
[1:13:24] have you not heard enough for you not to
[1:13:26] be a worshiper because you cannot get
[1:13:29] nothing from the preacher if you are not
[1:13:31] here worshiping
[1:13:33] because worship puts you in the spirit
[1:13:36] you want to get into the spirit make it
[1:13:38] about god not about you brother said
[1:13:40] last week yes your flesh what did i have
[1:13:43] to do with it
[1:13:47] have nothing to do with it make it about
[1:13:49] god when it ever comes you say don't
[1:13:51] look at me you know worship god
[1:13:53] it's about him
[1:13:55] his grace is keeping me his love is
[1:13:57] keeping me i can't keep myself
[1:14:00] i'm worshiping god watch the devil get
[1:14:02] confused because he wants to make it
[1:14:05] about you and we want to make it about
[1:14:07] god let god make it about you by saying
[1:14:10] this is my beloved son i want god to
[1:14:13] speak not the pastor not somebody else
[1:14:16] god will make it about you when you are
[1:14:19] approved when you have stood the test
[1:14:28] keepers of the sayings of this book
[1:14:31] i'm not going to be too much longer
[1:14:38] hallelujah
[1:14:41] and when i had heard unseen i fell down
[1:14:44] to worship
[1:14:46] but listen to john
[1:14:48] and this is so important
[1:14:50] as spiritual as john was
[1:14:56] this is the last book of revelation
[1:14:58] we're reading from
[1:15:00] john would have seen so many symbols so
[1:15:03] many mysteries
[1:15:05] seeing what we wish we could see and
[1:15:08] want to see and in time get to see
[1:15:11] john was so blown away brother clarence
[1:15:15] that despite the anointing and the
[1:15:17] atmosphere he was in
[1:15:19] john made a mistake
[1:15:26] he made a mistake that so many in the
[1:15:29] message i'm making this morning
[1:15:33] he had the right idea but the wrong
[1:15:35] direction
[1:15:39] he said i
[1:15:41] fell down to worship
[1:15:43] [Music]
[1:15:46] before the feet
[1:15:49] of the angel
[1:15:51] which showed me these things
[1:15:56] it is so easy to get impressed
[1:16:01] by an angel in operation
[1:16:05] this was not a fallen angel
[1:16:08] this was not the deceiving angel
[1:16:14] so it is logical
[1:16:17] it is not
[1:16:19] impossible
[1:16:22] for john to be overwhelmed with the
[1:16:24] magnitude of the anointing
[1:16:27] and the words
[1:16:29] like so many of us get caught up with
[1:16:31] this man of god and this apostle of god
[1:16:35] and this pastor my pastor and and what
[1:16:39] is it it's a form of
[1:16:41] worship
[1:16:46] how many make it clear
[1:16:48] like this angel did
[1:16:51] then said he unto me see thou do it not
[1:16:57] don't worship me remember the time when
[1:16:59] the bran was on the field
[1:17:00] and he heard that they were baptizing in
[1:17:03] his name
[1:17:08] but ibrahim didn't say i'm in the middle
[1:17:10] of a campaign
[1:17:11] let me finish the campaign
[1:17:14] and when i get back home i will deal
[1:17:16] with it
[1:17:19] he stopped the convention
[1:17:21] and said brothers i'm out
[1:17:24] before you could do that how you will
[1:17:26] leave the meeting we sponsor the meeting
[1:17:29] we set up the convention people travel
[1:17:31] here people set up your hotel don't pay
[1:17:33] for in advance
[1:17:35] you see that have nothing to do with me
[1:17:37] because
[1:17:38] there's some worship
[1:17:40] that is misplaced that i need to go on a
[1:17:43] dress
[1:17:44] and any true servant of god will quickly
[1:17:46] address misplaced worship
[1:17:49] or you don't hear me this morning
[1:17:57] because anything that takes the place of
[1:17:59] worship to god is misplaced worship
[1:18:02] so but amanda made it clear that
[1:18:04] anything could be your god you can make
[1:18:05] your car your god he can make your
[1:18:07] business your god he can make your house
[1:18:08] your god it can make your wife your god
[1:18:09] it can make your phone your god
[1:18:12] and most of us get that
[1:18:16] let's get
[1:18:17] the spiritual people who we may gods
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:24] because your pastor is a man
[1:18:27] a prophet is also a man
[1:18:29] and this was not this is our angel
[1:18:34] but at the end of it worship belongs to
[1:18:36] only one place
[1:18:39] [Applause]
[1:18:42] i hope this gets deep into your heart
[1:18:46] because i hear people speak about the
[1:18:48] church and the pastor like it's
[1:18:49] infallible
[1:18:52] and make statements and declarations
[1:18:53] that are so not scriptural it is
[1:18:55] horrific it is a horror story
[1:18:59] and that's why god when anything like
[1:19:02] that happens god god breaks it up he
[1:19:05] take a sledgehammer and mash it up
[1:19:10] because you'll have no other gods before
[1:19:12] me even if it's one of my
[1:19:13] representatives that should not be a god
[1:19:14] before me
[1:19:18] i hope this gets into your heart welter
[1:19:22] john sorry and when i heard unseen i
[1:19:24] fell down to worship before the feet of
[1:19:27] the angel which showed me these things
[1:19:30] then saith he unto me like any true
[1:19:32] angel any true man of god see thou do it
[1:19:36] not for i am thy one i read this and
[1:19:39] read it thy fellow servant in other
[1:19:40] words i'm i'm just like you i'm a
[1:19:42] servant just like
[1:19:48] you that's that's all that's powerful
[1:19:51] enough
[1:19:54] enough that i bred join the prophets
[1:19:57] so i'm a servant
[1:20:00] but i give it in my office now
[1:20:03] because all offices are servants
[1:20:08] so it's not no big me and little you
[1:20:10] we are all servants well parents we are
[1:20:14] all servants but my office
[1:20:16] might be pastor might be teacher it
[1:20:18] might be usher it might be deacon it
[1:20:20] might be host wife it might be we all
[1:20:22] have different but a man said god will
[1:20:23] adopt housewives
[1:20:29] an adopted housewife will trip up a
[1:20:31] pentecostal pastor with 50 000 people
[1:20:33] like that
[1:20:34] why because she's adopted and in her
[1:20:36] office oh come on come on you you don't
[1:20:38] hear me this morning an adopted
[1:20:40] housewife will walk in the hospital room
[1:20:43] not have a degree in medicine and walk
[1:20:45] in today and say my son come on the bed
[1:20:48] oh you don't hear me this morning
[1:20:53] do you understand where god is trying to
[1:20:55] take you
[1:20:57] that's why i see it and ministers would
[1:20:59] like to hear this but by the equal if it
[1:21:00] is true the fightful ministry is a it's
[1:21:02] a it's a limited ministry you know
[1:21:06] it's till we all come
[1:21:08] so when we reach the points above all
[1:21:10] coming into the unity of the fate and
[1:21:12] until when our work we uncontract on
[1:21:15] them
[1:21:17] and the contract will come to an end
[1:21:18] once everybody comes to their position
[1:21:21] because god has nobody between father
[1:21:23] and son father and daughter all god
[1:21:25] longs for is that relationship between
[1:21:28] father and son father and daughter
[1:21:30] direct one-on-one
[1:21:38] you may be seated
[1:21:39] now once god has a man on the earth
[1:21:42] and people are still being brought into
[1:21:44] the position he will go to the man
[1:21:47] because that's god's system
[1:21:49] but when you are in your position
[1:21:51] and we come into the fullness of our
[1:21:53] possession and the fullness of rightness
[1:21:56] when the hot july sun peaked through and
[1:21:58] all the greenness all the old ways and
[1:22:01] the little things you're still
[1:22:02] struggling with get dried out and the
[1:22:05] church is seasoned out by birth pains oh
[1:22:08] my my my mind they get tremendous
[1:22:10] sometimes but
[1:22:15] anybody with me this morning
[1:22:19] i hope this helps somebody let me try to
[1:22:21] wrap up
[1:22:22] almost done the music could get ready
[1:22:26] for i am thy fellow servant my god
[1:22:30] so don't make no mistake we all servant
[1:22:33] we serve in god
[1:22:34] and we are serving each other
[1:22:41] we have become so messed up here but i
[1:22:43] believe i respect the cabbage man
[1:22:47] i respect the name i respect the sinner
[1:22:50] people in the message are you talking to
[1:22:51] hina
[1:22:55] i have a revelation of this message he
[1:22:57] doesn't know the message so he is
[1:23:00] shock squad
[1:23:02] not just shock
[1:23:05] serpent seed you who could you how could
[1:23:07] you speak like that
[1:23:11] you
[1:23:12] you you find the message
[1:23:18] you find the message or the message
[1:23:20] found you
[1:23:23] because my understanding is the message
[1:23:25] finds us in them
[1:23:27] you will be hunting you're searching you
[1:23:29] don't know what to search for you listen
[1:23:31] to the testimony that people are
[1:23:32] searching they read this book they read
[1:23:34] that book they went to this church they
[1:23:35] went to this church they went through
[1:23:36] the baptism actually they read this book
[1:23:38] they meditate they went to the mountain
[1:23:40] upside down organic and then all of a
[1:23:42] sudden somebody come and say check this
[1:23:43] book out
[1:23:45] i said when he opened the book
[1:23:47] and they read a few words to reckon that
[1:23:49] this was different they never seen
[1:23:51] nothing like this before or they heard a
[1:23:52] tape and they never ever but but it
[1:23:54] found you you're going to be walking
[1:23:56] down the street and and somebody
[1:23:58] preaching by the corner and you're here
[1:23:59] to say wait time without talking about
[1:24:00] me i didn't know my name was was
[1:24:02] adoption and perfection and this thing
[1:24:04] started to ring a little i know it had
[1:24:06] to be more than salvation i know god had
[1:24:08] just saved me to save me but he saved me
[1:24:10] for a purpose
[1:24:11] he redeemed me backed her position
[1:24:13] taking me back to eden so i could have
[1:24:15] spoken with power
[1:24:17] anybody could relate to that this
[1:24:19] morning
[1:24:20] and you young people like me
[1:24:23] who grew up in this message
[1:24:27] it is not an automatic thing that
[1:24:29] because you're born in this thing you'll
[1:24:30] appreciate this thing
[1:24:33] you grew up in church you're hearing it
[1:24:35] you're hearing it in it if this thing
[1:24:37] don't come and meet you individually you
[1:24:39] get look up to you
[1:24:43] parents do their very best
[1:24:46] i would like to think parents do their
[1:24:48] very best
[1:24:49] the best they know how to do
[1:24:53] young people hear me and hear me well
[1:24:55] parents do the very best
[1:24:57] they may not do everything right they
[1:24:59] may not do all the answers
[1:25:01] but they try their very best
[1:25:03] to give you the best they could
[1:25:06] financially intellectually spiritually
[1:25:09] their ex don't abort
[1:25:12] could they do better perhaps could they
[1:25:15] do better sometimes maybe
[1:25:17] but in their heart they try their best
[1:25:20] to show you the right way not to trap
[1:25:23] you not to mess you up not to ruin your
[1:25:25] life
[1:25:28] count yourself blessed if they pointed
[1:25:31] you to this message
[1:25:33] because their journey to this message
[1:25:35] was harder than yours
[1:25:37] but you still need a personal experience
[1:25:39] for yourself for this message to be
[1:25:41] identified with you
[1:25:44] and that could never come with your
[1:25:46] father or never come from your mother it
[1:25:48] has to be between you and god and you
[1:25:50] catching a revelation that these sayings
[1:25:52] are true
[1:25:55] and you want to become a keeper
[1:25:58] of these things
[1:26:02] i'm trying to
[1:26:04] find a place to close off here
[1:26:07] see thou doeth not for i am thy fellow
[1:26:10] servant one and of thy prejudice
[1:26:12] prophets too and this is the part
[1:26:15] that captures all of us
[1:26:17] and of them
[1:26:20] which keep the sayings
[1:26:23] of this book
[1:26:26] that is the true common bond of a
[1:26:28] believer
[1:26:30] not i am in the message
[1:26:32] but i am of them which keep the sayings
[1:26:35] of this book
[1:26:37] now the statement say what the tape says
[1:26:40] has a whole new meaning
[1:26:42] because it makes you a keeper
[1:26:44] of the sayings
[1:26:46] of this book
[1:26:47] because the tapes is a spoken word the
[1:26:49] revealed form of the written word
[1:26:53] that brings us closer into being keepers
[1:26:57] of the sayings
[1:26:58] of this book
[1:27:01] and that angel closed that sentence with
[1:27:04] worship god
[1:27:09] so servants of the lord
[1:27:11] worship god
[1:27:13] of thy prejudice the prophet of thy
[1:27:15] bridging pastors of thy virgin deacon
[1:27:18] whatever you are worship god
[1:27:21] and of them which keep the sayings of
[1:27:23] this book worship god
[1:27:28] we just finished reading this scripture
[1:27:30] i didn't get any quotes this morning but
[1:27:32] i trust you're blessed
[1:27:33] this morning and you know i'm preaching
[1:27:35] the quotes
[1:27:36] and he said unto me seal not the sayings
[1:27:39] of the prophecy of this book in other
[1:27:41] words it's not the time to keep it
[1:27:42] wrapped up
[1:27:44] this is not the time to play around with
[1:27:45] this thing
[1:27:47] because for the time is at hand
[1:27:50] the time is at hand for what
[1:27:52] what is the time at hand for it's not
[1:27:54] just a time at hand because on the track
[1:27:56] time the time is at hand what is it in
[1:27:58] relation to
[1:28:00] what does his time being at the hand
[1:28:02] mean for us as believers
[1:28:04] and this is the warning and the blessing
[1:28:08] he that is unjust
[1:28:10] let him be unjust still
[1:28:13] he was just filthy let him be filthy
[1:28:16] still
[1:28:17] he that is righteous let him be
[1:28:19] righteous still
[1:28:21] and he that is holy let him be holy
[1:28:23] still
[1:28:24] and behold i come quickly
[1:28:27] and my reward is with me
[1:28:30] he's walking with his reward
[1:28:33] oh church he's walking on the reward for
[1:28:36] the keepers of these things
[1:28:38] to give every man according as his work
[1:28:42] shall
[1:28:44] be
[1:28:47] in the amplified it says to give each
[1:28:49] one according to the merit of his deeds
[1:28:51] early works and faithfulness
[1:28:54] faithfulness
[1:28:56] have you been faithful
[1:28:59] have you been faithful to this book
[1:29:02] have you been faithful to the scriptures
[1:29:05] have you been faithful to this great
[1:29:06] message
[1:29:07] i'm not dealing with faithfulness of
[1:29:09] church or pastor
[1:29:11] or conviction or belief but faithfulness
[1:29:13] to this word of god amen
[1:29:16] i come quickly and my reward is with me
[1:29:19] to give every man according as his work
[1:29:21] shall be i am
[1:29:23] alpha and omega the beginning and the
[1:29:26] end the first and the last blessed are
[1:29:28] they that do his commandments
[1:29:32] that they may have right
[1:29:35] a right means nobody can stop you
[1:29:41] listen to where he writes come in
[1:29:43] blessed are they that do his
[1:29:44] commandments
[1:29:46] are you doing his commandments
[1:29:49] can you testify you're doing his
[1:29:51] commandments friends when i'm preaching
[1:29:53] i'm not preaching to church and i'm
[1:29:54] preaching to me
[1:29:55] so don't take a direction at you because
[1:29:57] i want to make this
[1:30:00] i want to be the requirement for myself
[1:30:03] i can stand and say as for me and my
[1:30:05] house we are keepers of the sayings of
[1:30:07] this book and we are doing his
[1:30:10] commandments
[1:30:11] because this is the same thing the
[1:30:12] prophet said with full obedience to the
[1:30:14] entire word of god entitles you to the
[1:30:17] token it's the same thing there's no
[1:30:19] difference here
[1:30:21] blessed are they that do his
[1:30:23] commandments so not only are you blessed
[1:30:25] there's a blessing by just doing his
[1:30:27] commandments
[1:30:29] but it goes beyond just a blessing it
[1:30:31] says that they may have right to the
[1:30:34] tree of life
[1:30:37] and may enter in through the gates into
[1:30:40] the city
[1:30:41] through the gates means they could enter
[1:30:43] in without having to jump over the wall
[1:30:46] creek creep through the back
[1:30:49] that you can walk in knowing i have a
[1:30:51] right to be here who are you who are you
[1:30:53] i'm a son of the king
