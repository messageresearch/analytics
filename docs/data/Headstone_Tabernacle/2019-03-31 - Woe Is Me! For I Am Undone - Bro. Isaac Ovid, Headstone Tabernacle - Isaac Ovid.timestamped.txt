[1:06:45] thank you but Anthony thank you
[1:06:47] musicians would you turn with me to one
[1:06:49] portion of scripture reading Isaiah six
[1:06:52] reading from verse one to eight
[1:06:55] inclusive Isaiah 6 and verse one and
[1:07:03] Isaiah 6 verse one in the year that King
[1:07:06] Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting
[1:07:10] upon a throne high and lifted up and his
[1:07:13] train filled the temple above its to the
[1:07:17] seraphim's
[1:07:18] each one had six wings with twain he
[1:07:21] covered his face and with twain he
[1:07:23] covered his feet and with twain he did
[1:07:25] fly and one cried and saw another and
[1:07:28] said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts
[1:07:31] o a whole earth is full of his glory and
[1:07:35] the posts of the door moved at the voice
[1:07:38] of him that crying and the house was
[1:07:40] filled with smoke then said I was me for
[1:07:44] I am undone because I am a man of
[1:07:46] unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of
[1:07:49] a people of unclean lips for mine eyes
[1:07:52] have seen the king the Lord of hosts
[1:07:54] then flew one of the seraphim's unto me
[1:07:57] having a live coal in his hand which he
[1:08:00] had taken with the tongues from off the
[1:08:02] altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[1:08:05] said Lord this had touched our lips and
[1:08:07] then iniquity is taken away and I sin
[1:08:10] purged
[1:08:11] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[1:08:13] saying whom shall I send and who will go
[1:08:16] for us then said I here I am send me me
[1:08:21] the Lord and a blessing to the reading
[1:08:23] of his word you may be seated this
[1:08:25] morning in the presence of the Lord and
[1:08:27] it's certainly a great privilege to be
[1:08:29] in the house of the Lord this morning to
[1:08:32] take time away from what's not important
[1:08:35] to spend time doing what is most
[1:08:37] important because we appreciate as sons
[1:08:40] and daughters of God that we are here
[1:08:42] temporarily temporarily to prove to the
[1:08:45] devil that even
[1:08:46] this is Satan's Eden that this bride
[1:08:49] will not be deceived will not be like
[1:08:52] even in the midst of the sin in the
[1:08:55] midst of the evil in the myths of the
[1:08:57] adultery and fornication and spiritual
[1:09:00] wickedness in high places that God is
[1:09:03] pulling out a bride out of Satan's Eden
[1:09:06] God is pulling out a people for his
[1:09:09] name's sake and he is more than able to
[1:09:12] do it he has done it before and he can
[1:09:14] do it again in every age and every
[1:09:17] dispensation and every season God has
[1:09:20] always had a witness he has always had
[1:09:23] somebody who he could send forth whether
[1:09:25] reluctantly or willingly he has had
[1:09:28] somebody and he could send forth when
[1:09:30] was here Moses was somewhat reluctant he
[1:09:33] said I can talk I can speak but but he
[1:09:36] still went fought because he was sent
[1:09:39] for a purpose Gideon had his own
[1:09:41] complexes but God will always have a
[1:09:43] witness so rather willing or unwilling
[1:09:46] whether reluctant or push like Jonah he
[1:09:50] had a ministry and he ran away from it
[1:09:53] he was the unwilling prophet but if God
[1:09:55] has called you for something whether you
[1:09:57] are willing or unwilling whether you are
[1:09:59] prepared or unprepared whether you feel
[1:10:02] like it or don't he like it when God
[1:10:05] puts his hand upon you there is nothing
[1:10:07] that you could do about it up because he
[1:10:09] calls based on his foreknowledge and his
[1:10:12] foreknowledge allows him to see what you
[1:10:15] cannot see his foreknowledge allows him
[1:10:17] to understand what you don't yet
[1:10:20] understand because his ability is to see
[1:10:23] your future his ability to see your past
[1:10:25] your present his ability is to know what
[1:10:28] you dreamt last night that you can't
[1:10:30] even remember because he knows
[1:10:31] everything about you he is concerned
[1:10:34] about the animals he is concerned about
[1:10:36] who's in government he is concerned
[1:10:38] about where you work he is concerned
[1:10:40] about where you live
[1:10:42] he is concerned about what you ate up he
[1:10:44] is concerned what happens tomorrow and
[1:10:47] he is able to factor every single thing
[1:10:50] into his plan and he is able to make all
[1:10:52] things work together for good to them
[1:10:55] that love God to them who are the called
[1:10:57] according to his purpose and the love
[1:10:59] took order you couldn't even put it in
[1:11:02] your heart because you could never
[1:11:04] understand love because he is love it
[1:11:06] takes a while to reach the kind of love
[1:11:09] that he had when you didn't even know
[1:11:11] him he still loves you when you had not
[1:11:13] met him he still loved you before you
[1:11:16] were born and you could even come to
[1:11:18] consciousness of who you were his love
[1:11:21] left glory and sent his son to die for
[1:11:24] you when you could not even appreciate
[1:11:27] it he died for you when you could not
[1:11:29] say thank you he died for you when you
[1:11:32] couldn't write your name up he died for
[1:11:35] you when you didn't even know yourself
[1:11:39] somebody say man hallelujah so don't let
[1:11:44] the suffering of this present time weigh
[1:11:46] you down for you to stay in spiritual
[1:11:50] amnesia it's one thing to have spiritual
[1:11:53] amnesia it's another thing to stay in
[1:11:55] spiritual amnesia we were born in
[1:11:59] spiritual amnesia we were born not
[1:12:01] knowing who we were we were poor not
[1:12:03] knowing who our Father is up we were
[1:12:05] born not knowing that we were royalty we
[1:12:08] were born not knowing how we were sons
[1:12:10] of the king we were born not knowing
[1:12:12] that royalty was flew into our veins up
[1:12:15] we were born could not appreciate who
[1:12:18] our heritage was and understand that
[1:12:21] even on Joshua
[1:12:22] and everyone who went before wish they
[1:12:24] could have been here we were born not
[1:12:26] understanding that up because we forgot
[1:12:29] where we were we forgot where we came
[1:12:31] from and the same way God had to remind
[1:12:34] a jobber where was our when I lay the
[1:12:37] foundation of the eternal morning stars
[1:12:39] sang together we are here this morning
[1:12:42] to be reminded of where we come from
[1:12:44] reminder of where we are going
[1:12:47] reminded of
[1:12:48] what's for us that's greater than what's
[1:12:50] against us that there's a power in you
[1:12:53] that your situation cannot stop there's
[1:12:56] a power in you that your past cannot
[1:12:58] stop there's a power in you that your
[1:13:01] mistakes cannot stop there's a power in
[1:13:03] you if your children cannot stop there's
[1:13:06] a power in you that your bank account
[1:13:08] cannot stop there's a power in you then
[1:13:11] your boss cannot stop there's a power in
[1:13:13] you
[1:13:14] that hypocrisy cannot stop there's a
[1:13:16] power in you that your sin cannot stop
[1:13:19] because the sin that you have in your
[1:13:21] members was already conquered by the
[1:13:23] mighty Conqueror and he said because I
[1:13:26] live not because you live but because I
[1:13:28] live you will live also you add the
[1:13:32] results of his life you are the results
[1:13:35] of his ministry you add a result of his
[1:13:38] victory you add a result of his
[1:13:40] overcoming and because he overcame you
[1:13:43] could overcome because he is victorious
[1:13:45] you could have the victory because Oh
[1:13:49] somebody help me this morning
[1:13:51] [Applause]
[1:14:03] hallelujah so don't look next to you
[1:14:07] don't look who's around you that's
[1:14:08] totally unimportant this morning don't
[1:14:14] look back what don't look forward don't
[1:14:16] look left or right I want you to look up
[1:14:19] look up because that's my Redemption
[1:14:22] coming from your redemption is not
[1:14:24] coming from the pulpit your redemption
[1:14:25] come from God God will move every prop
[1:14:28] around your life he will move everything
[1:14:30] you're leading on until you could only
[1:14:32] trust him
[1:14:33] he is not compromising his trust he's
[1:14:37] not compromising his love because this
[1:14:39] is bright time because it's bright time
[1:14:42] it means it's an understanding of his
[1:14:44] husband time also because bride and
[1:14:46] husband have to become one can the
[1:14:48] church same and everybody feeling fine
[1:14:52] so I promise you today I'll not be too
[1:14:55] long with you I have a sunday-school
[1:14:58] message this morning just to our hearts
[1:15:01] to remembrance and to make us conscious
[1:15:05] of not only the battle that we face but
[1:15:08] the gravity of the situation that we are
[1:15:11] in this morning and I believe it's a
[1:15:13] crossroads for us how many appreciate
[1:15:15] but over this morning and services for
[1:15:18] the last few services every service a
[1:15:21] masterpiece and I share with him what my
[1:15:26] thought was gonna be this morning so I
[1:15:29] want to take title this morning woe is
[1:15:33] me for I am undone reading from Isaiah 6
[1:15:40] verse 5 and we understand that and we
[1:15:44] have heard it and I'll just talk for a
[1:15:47] bit that it is impossible for your walk
[1:15:51] with God to be one that's really genuine
[1:15:56] until you have an experience with God
[1:15:59] you can read about God you could know
[1:16:02] about God and until you have your own
[1:16:05] individual experience with God it's just
[1:16:08] here see it is just here see you are
[1:16:15] rejoicing perhaps on what somebody else
[1:16:18] went through and you hear what Peter
[1:16:21] went through and what Moses went through
[1:16:23] and how deep it had an experience and
[1:16:25] Moses has an experience and Joshua had
[1:16:28] an experience and brother Branham had an
[1:16:30] experience and the experience is over
[1:16:32] the years since the Prophet left and yes
[1:16:34] they are an encouragement to us but all
[1:16:37] of that until it becomes an experience
[1:16:41] with us and God it's just hearsay but a
[1:16:45] Branham said ladies say you cannot be
[1:16:47] worn by a painted fire so knowing what
[1:16:51] happened over the years is great
[1:16:53] information it has a great understanding
[1:16:57] and there are those who have specialized
[1:16:59] and gotten their PhDs and church history
[1:17:01] but church history without a personal
[1:17:04] experience with God is just that church
[1:17:06] history and our whole desire is to have
[1:17:09] an experience with God Moses had an
[1:17:14] understanding that that he was one of
[1:17:16] them are doubles and he made his limited
[1:17:19] attempt to bring some kind of relief and
[1:17:21] he ended up killing one man and ran away
[1:17:24] and he had basically given up on his
[1:17:28] ministry giving up on his objective
[1:17:30] given up on his burden because his human
[1:17:33] effort have filled but when he had an
[1:17:35] experience with God via meeting the
[1:17:38] burning bush there was a transformation
[1:17:40] that he could not undo and you cannot
[1:17:44] undo an experience with God you kind of
[1:17:47] reset an experience with God it will
[1:17:49] change you forever
[1:17:50] so if you find yourself struggling
[1:17:52] trying to make sense of what's going on
[1:17:55] in your life you need an experience and
[1:17:57] and if you have had one experience there
[1:18:00] is room for another experience and
[1:18:02] another experience and and this room to
[1:18:05] be filled and his room to be refilled
[1:18:07] and and and refill them and refill them
[1:18:10] and the room filled once more can with
[1:18:12] the present and the Spirit of God can
[1:18:15] the church Shaymin Moses had an
[1:18:18] experience Joshua had an ex fears before
[1:18:22] he could go and deal with Jericho yeah
[1:18:24] in his alone time he has nobody around
[1:18:27] him
[1:18:27] meditating wondering how to take it he
[1:18:30] is trying to figure it out because it's
[1:18:32] human nature to try to figure it out
[1:18:34] every time we wake up in the day we kind
[1:18:37] of figure out how to live how to make it
[1:18:39] how to make ends meet how to pay the
[1:18:41] bills it it's in our nature to figure
[1:18:43] stuff out how to get marriage to work
[1:18:45] how to save more money how to fix the
[1:18:48] car how to make it through the traffic
[1:18:50] how to buy food how to cook everything
[1:18:53] is about figuring it out and Josh Shaw
[1:18:55] was there trying to figure it out he
[1:18:57] didn't have an experience but all of a
[1:18:59] sudden the captain or the chief captain
[1:19:02] came by to give him an encounter with
[1:19:05] God of hosts and and just was any
[1:19:10] vigilance Olli will do through his sword
[1:19:13] and challenge one time because he wants
[1:19:16] to make sure that he's not being
[1:19:17] deceived he wants to make sure that
[1:19:19] nothing slips him so he asked the
[1:19:21] question are you for us or are you
[1:19:23] against us are you for our purpose are
[1:19:26] you follower plan because I want you to
[1:19:28] know we're about to take over Jericho if
[1:19:30] you don't know it I'm here meditating
[1:19:32] and how to keep these people to the land
[1:19:35] that was promised so are you for that or
[1:19:38] are you against that because if you are
[1:19:40] against the rapture and the resurrection
[1:19:42] and you are against perfection and
[1:19:44] adoption you are against the
[1:19:46] manifestation of the sons of God then we
[1:19:48] have means and ways to deal with it up
[1:19:51] but if you are trying to make it to
[1:19:53] Keenan's land and you are trying to
[1:19:55] overcome and separate yourselves from
[1:19:57] the world and you will be seated and the
[1:20:06] angel of the Lord is punished and the
[1:20:07] chief captain I'm the one with the pan
[1:20:10] I'm no one who already has the tape of
[1:20:12] what already took place so I'm coming to
[1:20:15] just rewind the tape for you so you
[1:20:17] could know how to approach it we already
[1:20:20] know what you need to do we already know
[1:20:23] how you need to approach it so you don't
[1:20:25] have to worry anymore because I've come
[1:20:27] to give you a set plan on how to
[1:20:29] overcome this situation that you are
[1:20:31] trying to figure out on your job I'm
[1:20:33] come to give you plans from the world on
[1:20:35] how to deal with this situation if
[1:20:37] you're trying to figure out in your
[1:20:39] family
[1:20:40] this mountain that's in front of you
[1:20:42] this wall that's in front of you this
[1:20:44] barrier that in front of you this
[1:20:46] Jericho in your life and the angel gave
[1:20:49] him what he needed to do and experience
[1:20:53] with God Gideon had an experience with
[1:20:56] God now mighty man of Valor he didn't
[1:20:59] believe it just like many people come to
[1:21:01] service this morning and no matter what
[1:21:03] we see or what we preach it is all on an
[1:21:06] intellectual level until Killian see
[1:21:11] well listen if you show me something get
[1:21:13] my same human experience give me
[1:21:14] something that I could rest my feet on
[1:21:18] coz he after some of the rest of it on
[1:21:20] that is between you and God alone nobody
[1:21:23] else has to know this is this is you and
[1:21:25] God and your confidence some of the you
[1:21:28] rest your feet on because if your feet
[1:21:29] is on the pasta and something happens in
[1:21:32] a pasta then your feet will feel if your
[1:21:34] feet is on your mother your father then
[1:21:37] if they are not there then your feet
[1:21:38] will feel that's why people backslide
[1:21:40] because their feet was on something that
[1:21:42] could not last but if your faith is on
[1:21:44] an experience a personal experience with
[1:21:47] God whether the pastor calls whatever it
[1:21:49] takes
[1:21:52] hallelujah hallelujah lets it be the
[1:21:55] name of the Lord with a Franciscan I get
[1:21:58] a little bit more in the monitors thank
[1:22:00] you Paul had an experience that was so
[1:22:07] powerful to him he actually kept it a
[1:22:09] secret for 14 years until the
[1:22:12] Corinthians dragged it out of him so
[1:22:15] personal so unbelievable that he never
[1:22:18] said anything about it it was an
[1:22:21] experience when he was caught up in
[1:22:22] heaven to the paradise of God where he
[1:22:25] heard divine secrets that was almost
[1:22:27] beyond the capability of man to utter
[1:22:29] and even when he started to express it
[1:22:32] he shared it as if he was somebody else
[1:22:35] he was talking about he said I know a
[1:22:37] man in Christ who 14 years ago was
[1:22:40] caught up in the third heaven and the
[1:22:42] way he was talking about it they could
[1:22:44] have thought that he was talking about
[1:22:45] somebody else it was only after a while
[1:22:48] they're realizing he was shared
[1:22:50] experience that he had what experience
[1:22:54] have you had and the church same and
[1:23:07] keep your motto salmon I'm not gonna be
[1:23:10] too long with you but we're going
[1:23:12] somewhere this morning hallelujah
[1:23:15] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:23:17] hallelujah hallelujah if you have your
[1:23:25] Bibles let's read it said this little
[1:23:27] sunday-school cry I'm gonna get to my
[1:23:29] tech shortly 2nd Corinthians 12 and
[1:23:33] verse 1 2nd Corinthians 12 verse 1 it is
[1:23:41] not expedient for me doubtless to glory
[1:23:43] I will come to visions and revelations
[1:23:45] of the Lord I knew a man in Christ above
[1:23:48] fourteen years ago whether in body I
[1:23:51] cannot tell or whether out of body I
[1:23:53] cannot tell God knoweth such and one
[1:23:55] caught up in the till heaven something
[1:23:58] happened to Paul and he's sharing it and
[1:24:01] I knew such a manner where in the body
[1:24:03] or out of the body I cannot tell God
[1:24:04] knoweth how that he was caught up into
[1:24:07] paradise and heard unspeakable words
[1:24:09] which it is not lawful for a man to
[1:24:11] utter of such an one when I glorify yet
[1:24:14] of myself I will not glory but in my
[1:24:17] name limit ease but to our desire to
[1:24:20] glory I shall not be a fool for I will
[1:24:22] say the truth but now I forbear lest any
[1:24:26] man should think of me above that which
[1:24:28] you see at me so Paul was saying I've
[1:24:30] been keeping this thing to myself
[1:24:31] because I don't want no glory I don't
[1:24:33] want you to see me picking on that I am
[1:24:35] I don't want you to have no no forth
[1:24:37] understanding of my ministry and Paul
[1:24:42] goes on and on in this scripture so you
[1:24:44] read it as your homework but Paul an
[1:24:46] experience and it took him 14 years
[1:24:49] before he was willing to share it with
[1:24:51] the people that he was ministering to
[1:24:54] and these are the experiences that shape
[1:24:59] us these experiences these encounters is
[1:25:02] what makes us having a walk with God so
[1:25:05] different that you could weather the
[1:25:07] storm of time because you're not leading
[1:25:09] than anybody can the church same so can
[1:25:17] we talk about Isaiah a little bit this
[1:25:19] morning Isaiah the prophet said is one
[1:25:25] of the greatest prophecies in the Bible
[1:25:27] in the message in his presence there are
[1:25:29] 66 books of the Bible there are 66
[1:25:31] chapters in Isaiah Isaiah starts off in
[1:25:34] Genesis the middle of Isaiah he brings
[1:25:36] in the New Testament at the end of
[1:25:39] Isaiah he brings in the Millennium Jess
[1:25:41] exactly Genesis the New Testament and
[1:25:43] Revelation perfect Isaiah was one of the
[1:25:46] major prophets those are the prophets
[1:25:49] wood and he is meditating in the courts
[1:25:53] of the Temple in Jerusalem trying to
[1:25:56] gain some perspective and what had just
[1:25:59] transpired the recent death of King
[1:26:02] Uzziah dangers and threats from foreign
[1:26:07] empires when all of a sudden he is
[1:26:09] caught up in his own experience and the
[1:26:13] Bible says in the year that King Uzziah
[1:26:15] died I also saw the Lord sitting upon a
[1:26:18] throne high and lifted up and his train
[1:26:21] filled the temple what it is to see the
[1:26:24] Lord friends that's why we came here
[1:26:26] this morning not to see the preacher or
[1:26:28] to see one another but to see the Lord
[1:26:30] and if you ever get an encounter to see
[1:26:33] the Lord suddenly your world changes it
[1:26:36] will never be the same again but to
[1:26:39] understand the context of this build up
[1:26:45] the book of 2nd chronicles tells us that
[1:26:47] eyes that Uzziah was 16 years old when
[1:26:50] he took the throne and he would reign in
[1:26:53] Jerusalem for 52 years under his
[1:26:57] leadership the nation rose to incredible
[1:26:59] Heights of power military power
[1:27:02] financial power and as long as you say I
[1:27:05] saw the Lord the kingdom
[1:27:07] but the people had flourished the
[1:27:10] kingdom was strong but King Uzziah but
[1:27:14] about him said that he went above his
[1:27:15] estate he went above his station and and
[1:27:17] the King did something that the priest
[1:27:20] is supposed to do and he went into the
[1:27:22] temple and he offered incense and over
[1:27:24] 80 priests warned them King if you do
[1:27:27] that you'll be violating the way we
[1:27:29] operate and I want us to understand our
[1:27:32] history from the beginning of time God
[1:27:37] had ruled from the days of Moses onwards
[1:27:40] and and trod by the prophets it had
[1:27:43] never been caught planned to have a king
[1:27:44] over his people that was a manly King it
[1:27:48] was just before the dawn of the age of
[1:27:52] David at the the cheering of Israel had
[1:27:54] looked outside of themselves as is often
[1:27:56] the case looked at the kingdoms around
[1:27:59] them and said why don't we have a king
[1:28:01] like the Philistines do why don't we do
[1:28:03] things the way the world is doing it why
[1:28:05] are we why are we restricting ourselves
[1:28:07] to hearing from the prophets and Samuel
[1:28:11] who was the Prophet at the time felt so
[1:28:14] bad about it God had to comfort his
[1:28:16] prophet and since Samuel they have not
[1:28:19] rejected you they have rejected me it
[1:28:24] had been God's plan to give them a king
[1:28:27] but that thing was gonna be king Jesus
[1:28:30] that had been his plan to give him a
[1:28:32] king and his name is gonna be Jesus but
[1:28:38] the choice of the people they want a man
[1:28:39] they want a man they want a man to leave
[1:28:41] him and that's how we end up with King
[1:28:45] Saul and then we know all the king so by
[1:28:47] the time King Uzziah is there these
[1:28:49] kings and the prophets suppose we work
[1:28:51] in hand-in-hand for different roles
[1:28:54] different responsibilities what the King
[1:28:57] is supposed to do is not for the priests
[1:28:59] to do what the priests and the prophets
[1:29:00] supposed to do is not for the king to do
[1:29:02] God has an order the kingdom has our
[1:29:04] aura but Uzziah went outside of the
[1:29:07] order and because you were no saddlery
[1:29:09] order the Bible said leprosy came upon
[1:29:11] him but a Branham brought out that
[1:29:14] Isaiah you saline on you sire
[1:29:18] rely on his ayahs counsel rely on his
[1:29:21] ayahs advice because for the most part
[1:29:23] he was a great man the Prophet said he
[1:29:26] was a great man until he got too big for
[1:29:28] himself and once you get too big for
[1:29:31] yourself caught us a wheel off stripping
[1:29:33] you down and I want you to understand
[1:29:41] this is Isaiah the prophet
[1:29:42] these are prophet but gifts and callings
[1:29:45] are without repentance so this prophet
[1:29:48] as a call is Prophet as a gift but the
[1:29:51] gift and the call comes without
[1:29:53] repentance I see I didn't realize what
[1:29:56] was happening in his life as a prophet
[1:29:59] this is not a church member this is not
[1:30:01] somebody in Israel or Judah or tribe
[1:30:04] this is a prophet a major Prophet the
[1:30:08] Prophet would say yes later he would
[1:30:11] speak about a virgin shall conceive and
[1:30:13] yes this is not that time this is in the
[1:30:17] year that King Uzziah died Isaiah's
[1:30:19] trouble because his uncle as it were his
[1:30:22] support system as it were where he went
[1:30:24] for advice as it were weight when he
[1:30:27] feeling down you want to talk to
[1:30:28] somebody that person who according to
[1:30:31] his she was also family to him God had
[1:30:34] removed what he was leaning on God had
[1:30:39] removed that structure the force Isaiah
[1:30:41] to be alone just like Jacob had to be
[1:30:46] left alone just as Moses had to be left
[1:30:49] alone just as Paul had to be left alone
[1:30:52] just Esther to be left alone go through
[1:30:56] the Bible God is a core of the
[1:31:00] individual he doesn't look at the group
[1:31:02] he doesn't even look at your family he's
[1:31:05] a good of the individual and wants an
[1:31:07] individual relationship can the church
[1:31:11] hey man is this helping anybody this
[1:31:14] morning - sure to what extent God is
[1:31:19] about the individual in acts
[1:31:21] five with Ananias and Sapphira even
[1:31:25] though Ananias lied and died his wife
[1:31:28] wasn't judged because of him she was
[1:31:31] given the opportunity as an individual
[1:31:33] to represent her position to stand
[1:31:36] before the throne that was in Peters
[1:31:39] heart and she also lied and got judge
[1:31:42] her on the merits of her actions and
[1:31:48] caller-id wanted a deal when I say
[1:31:50] justice he wants to deal with every one
[1:31:52] of us hears individuals up but I see had
[1:31:55] been hiding behind Uzziah he had been
[1:31:57] leaning on Uzziah he had been depending
[1:31:59] on his ire if you sire him call I don't
[1:32:02] know how he felt if he was troubled and
[1:32:04] God stripped away everybody with me
[1:32:12] Sunday school this morning
[1:32:15] we're not getting into too much of the
[1:32:17] deep things this morning but we are
[1:32:18] coming to your home we're coming to you
[1:32:21] in your bedroom we're coming to you and
[1:32:23] nobody else is there to you being alone
[1:32:26] with God and many times things block our
[1:32:29] vision of God somehow we leave in our
[1:32:32] jobs we lean on the comfort of our home
[1:32:35] we we lean on a leader we lean on
[1:32:38] somebody we know God we love God we
[1:32:42] trust God but we are not really
[1:32:44] depending upon him many times God has to
[1:32:47] remove our props allow us to become ill
[1:32:51] allow us to lose a job allow the leader
[1:32:53] to die a locust to happen to see how
[1:32:57] we're gonna do it and I see it did what
[1:32:59] was the best thing to do is found
[1:33:01] himself in the temple and in the temple
[1:33:04] something happened he said I saw the
[1:33:07] Lord can the church same era and the
[1:33:10] Lourdes was sitting on the throne
[1:33:13] hallelujah this was not any throne this
[1:33:16] is this room this is the throne above
[1:33:18] every other throne this is this is not
[1:33:20] justice room but God was on the throne
[1:33:22] and once he's on the throne he's judge
[1:33:25] once he's on the throne he's the king of
[1:33:27] kings
[1:33:27] he is the presiding judge on the turn
[1:33:30] and Isaiah stood there
[1:33:33] everybody with me this morning we make
[1:33:39] decisions and our decisions our
[1:33:42] judgments when a judge makes a decision
[1:33:46] it's called a judgement your choices
[1:33:52] your decisions with what you do when the
[1:33:54] day comes and who your friends are these
[1:33:56] are your judgments based on the
[1:33:58] information that's presented to you you
[1:34:01] make a decision this is going to be my
[1:34:02] friend and that's a judgment but as I
[1:34:06] say a stood there in front the Lord and
[1:34:14] he saw the Lord sitting on the throne
[1:34:16] and the throne was not empty God is on
[1:34:22] the throne he's in control in the
[1:34:26] presence of the Lord
[1:34:28] Isiah started to feel uncomfortable as
[1:34:35] the I started to feel naked as yes I
[1:34:38] didn't feel what he didn't realize all
[1:34:41] along and he screamed that woe is me in
[1:34:48] other words I'm in trouble before he
[1:34:51] sort of no he didn't realize that he was
[1:34:53] in trouble
[1:34:55] woe is me
[1:34:57] I am undone it was only in the presence
[1:35:02] of the Lord that he realized that he was
[1:35:05] undone many people come to church and
[1:35:10] they don't realize that they are undone
[1:35:11] that word undone means unfinished
[1:35:16] unwarned incomplete is like your
[1:35:19] shoelace is untied he thought everything
[1:35:22] was okay going through the routine in
[1:35:26] the absence of King Uzziah but in the
[1:35:28] presence of the Lord and here was the
[1:35:31] Bible said he he Caesar to seraphim's
[1:35:36] two wings over their faces in reverence
[1:35:42] two wings over their feet in humility
[1:35:45] and two wings they are flying the eye in
[1:35:48] action and that's attributes of true
[1:35:50] worship and they are saying holy holy

[1:36:10] their feet with wings phenazine desire

[1:36:35] presence of God he was in the same
[1:36:37] temple not a different temple it was the
[1:36:41] same temple but then he saw something
[1:36:43] and he hadn't seen before
[1:36:45] may God uncover your eyes this morning
[1:36:48] to see what you have not seen before to
[1:36:51] seek God upon his throne to see what's
[1:36:54] happening around us to see the signs of
[1:36:57] the time to see that no matter what you

[1:37:02] something that you need to do to be
[1:37:03] complete Oh hallelujah hallelujah

[1:37:27] message list but when he got there in
[1:37:28] the temple that day and he seeing those
[1:37:31] cherubims waving these wings back and
[1:37:33] forth and realize that these angels
[1:37:36] ministered in the face of god and them

[1:40:12] us weaker in his holiness it shows who

[1:40:30] throne hallelujah and one cried another
[1:40:42] said holy holy is the Lord of hosts and
[1:40:45] he whole earth is full of his glory
[1:40:47] Church ft angels who don't know what sin
[1:40:51] is
[1:40:51] which spend all of their time seeing
[1:40:54] holy holy holy holy is the Lord holy
[1:40:57] holy holy holy is the Lord and they
[1:40:59] don't know what sinners didn't make a
[1:41:01] mistake yesterday but they'll live their
[1:41:03] life saying holy holy holy is the Lord
[1:41:05] God Almighty they didn't lie last week
[1:41:08] but this time they are saying holy holy
[1:41:10] holy is the Lord God Almighty they
[1:41:13] didn't have an argument with their
[1:41:14] spouse this morning but they are saying
[1:41:17] holy holy holy is the Lord God on my
[1:41:19] team how can you come into the presence
[1:41:22] of God and not be reverent and not be
[1:41:25] saying holy holy holy is the Lord
[1:41:27] Almighty I know
[1:41:29] trouble but that doesn't change the fact
[1:41:30] not holy holy holy is the Lord God
[1:41:33] Almighty I know you are tired but that
[1:41:36] doesn't change the fact of not holy holy
[1:41:38] holy is the Lord God Almighty you should
[1:41:41] be walking every day holy holy holy is
[1:41:43] the Lord Almighty holy holy holy is the
[1:41:47] Lord God Almighty there's none like him
[1:41:49] there's none like him in all the earth
[1:41:51] holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty
[1:41:54] holy holy holy is the Lord God on my
[1:41:57] team it's reverence its worship it's
[1:42:00] acknowledging God and that creates an
[1:42:03] atmosphere it's not trying to work the
[1:42:05] people up it's a revelation that he is
[1:42:08] holy and if angels who didn't make
[1:42:11] mistakes of sing praises unto him what
[1:42:15] about us who were created the worship
[1:42:17] and with a different gratefulness up we
[1:42:20] could see worship that the Angels cannot
[1:42:22] even say he is holy he is holy he is
[1:42:48] holy he is holy because he is holy
[1:42:53] that's why you dress reverently to come
[1:42:55] into the house of God because he is holy
[1:42:58] it's why you speak a certain way when
[1:43:00] you come around the tabernacle because
[1:43:02] he is holy and you realize that he sits
[1:43:05] on his throne it's why you even in your
[1:43:07] house you operate a certain way it's
[1:43:09] because he is holy because he is holy
[1:43:12] it's why the Prophet was serious clothes
[1:43:14] you're not supposed even where in your
[1:43:16] house you figure that out up but he was
[1:43:18] speaking about the consciousness of the
[1:43:20] holiness of God the consciousness about
[1:43:23] the throne of God the holiness of God
[1:43:33] His Holiness has nothing to do with your
[1:43:37] condition His Holiness has nothing to do
[1:43:40] with your mistakes His Holiness has
[1:43:43] nothing to do with how long in the
[1:43:44] message or how long in church he is just
[1:43:46] holy he is just holy so you have no
[1:43:50] excuse this morning to not worship what
[1:43:53] is your excuse to not worship this
[1:43:55] morning what is your excuse what stress
[1:43:59] you have that you cannot see holy is the
[1:44:01] Lord what problem you have that you
[1:44:04] cannot worship and give God praise this
[1:44:06] morning
[1:44:07] you have no excuse this morning you have
[1:44:10] no excuse I'm not talking about you this
[1:44:12] morning I'm talking about him because
[1:44:15] that's what Isaiah saw when he when he
[1:44:19] saw the Lord and he saw the angels and
[1:44:23] he sort of seraphim sup he was so moved
[1:44:25] when he sort of building beginners shake
[1:44:28] the Bible said the pulse of the door
[1:44:30] moved at the voice of him that cried and
[1:44:33] the house was filled with smoke the
[1:44:35] incense of worship the house was filled
[1:44:38] up it was milky white because praise was
[1:44:42] an attack
[1:44:43] it was milky white you may be seated
[1:44:48] it's a sunday-school message the smoke
[1:44:55] and the worship and the praise didn't
[1:44:58] mean that sin was not there because the
[1:45:01] smoke and the worship and the praise
[1:45:02] uncovered uncovered the cynic was there
[1:45:07] because it was a smoke and the moving of
[1:45:10] the Pope's and the angels that were
[1:45:12] swear was where were flying around and
[1:45:15] the Lord being present at that that was
[1:45:17] Isaiah to stop looking around him the
[1:45:23] atmosphere had changed so much that
[1:45:25] Isaiah stop looking at the throne he
[1:45:29] stopped looking at the angels he had
[1:45:31] forgotten about King Uzziah and all of a
[1:45:34] sudden he started to look at himself he
[1:45:36] was so overwhelmed with what he felt he
[1:45:40] was so overwhelmed with what he saw he
[1:45:42] was so overwhelmed
[1:45:45] he was so overwhelmed look around him
[1:45:51] and he looked at himself and when he
[1:45:56] looked at himself in that presence when
[1:45:58] he looked at himself in that anointing
[1:46:00] when he looked at himself in the
[1:46:02] presence of the King on the throne in
[1:46:05] the throne room and the seraphim's and
[1:46:07] he angels around and he said woe is me I
[1:46:10] didn't realize I was in trouble I
[1:46:12] thought I was okey I thought I'm in the
[1:46:16] message for time I worship I thought I'm
[1:46:19] a believer woe is me I'm in trouble I
[1:46:22] didn't realize that I mean here in the
[1:46:24] temple he wasn't in a bar he wasn't on
[1:46:27] the street he wasn't with a prostitute
[1:46:29] he was in the temple and the temple
[1:46:32] uncovered the sin and the shame the
[1:46:35] temple uncovered the filth that was in
[1:46:38] his mouth
[1:46:39] the temple
[1:46:40] [Applause]
[1:46:46] the random said one year we have a
[1:46:49] church where sim cannot stay in the
[1:46:51] church because the King on his throne
[1:46:55] will uncover will expose will lift up
[1:47:00] what's going on in your life
[1:47:02] lift up your situation you see in that
[1:47:04] presence I see I couldn't blame anybody
[1:47:07] people still talk about well it have
[1:47:10] hypocrites and this one do this and this
[1:47:12] one do that and I don't know how he live
[1:47:14] it and he Deacon did this and he did
[1:47:16] that and the Minnesota dish and this
[1:47:18] person see this but in the presence of
[1:47:23] God it was not about anybody else I say
[1:47:28] looked at Jess himself not his child his
[1:47:32] wife his cousin his brother his neighbor
[1:47:34] nothing is here Lord
[1:47:35] boys me I didn't realize it I didn't
[1:47:40] think I was in this much trouble I
[1:47:41] thought I was all right I'm a spiritual
[1:47:45] man this is a prophet a major prophet
[1:47:49] who found that there was silliness
[1:47:52] members a prophet who found it and he
[1:47:58] was in trouble and didn't realize it it
[1:48:01] was not that he didn't know the word I
[1:48:02] didn't know the Lord didn't know the
[1:48:04] Scriptures he has what's called for this
[1:48:06] purpose he was born with his purpose
[1:48:09] cannot judge him then said I what is me
[1:48:21] for I am undone he came to acknowledge
[1:48:26] his problem
[1:48:30] God didn't say this is your problem it
[1:48:33] wasn't the pastor saying this you know
[1:48:35] what your problem is here this morning
[1:48:36] you don't need a pastor to tell you what
[1:48:41] your problem is the world opens up what
[1:48:44] your problem is
[1:48:46] he said I am undone and he came to his
[1:48:51] problem he said because I am a man of
[1:48:55] unclean lips he identified what was his
[1:49:04] problem can you identify your problem in
[1:49:07] the presence of God what you need help
[1:49:10] with what you want change in your life
[1:49:13] can you identify your struggle that you
[1:49:16] know has been there but this morning the
[1:49:19] presence of God is lifting off the
[1:49:21] covers so bring you directly to confront
[1:49:24] who you are when everybody else because
[1:49:26] nobody had a reason the point that
[1:49:28] Isaiah the question his life is
[1:49:30] integrity this was you science prophet
[1:49:34] this was an anointed man of God but in
[1:49:37] the presence of God there's a
[1:49:38] conversation taking place that nobody
[1:49:42] else is around for and my desire this
[1:49:44] morning for me as an individual it's
[1:49:46] Lord show me show me where I am undone
[1:49:49] this morning show me what I lack this
[1:49:53] morning show me what I need this morning
[1:49:56] I didn't realize that I was this empty I
[1:49:58] didn't realize that I was just needy
[1:50:01] I didn't even know what I need but in
[1:50:02] your presence I'm a man of unclean lips
[1:50:05] I'm I'm a man struggling with whatever
[1:50:08] it is this morning oh god oh god oh god
[1:50:14] and Isaiah the prophet said the Prophet
[1:50:19] said he's tatted to confess what was his
[1:50:24] problem he started to confess what was
[1:50:28] his need he started to admit what he was
[1:50:32] doing he started to confess where he had
[1:50:35] gone wrong he said I am undone because I
[1:50:39] am a man of unclean lips so he was not
[1:50:42] just cereal pray for me
[1:50:48] he was Nessie remember me in prayer this
[1:50:51] was this was not that
[1:50:53] he had come to confront the reality say
[1:50:55] I am a man of unclean lips I'm not
[1:50:58] afraid to admit it I'm not afraid to
[1:51:00] confess it because I can't get help if I
[1:51:02] keep it hidden any longer but a Branham
[1:51:04] spends a lot of time preaching about
[1:51:05] unconfessed sin but when you confess the
[1:51:08] devil cannot hold it on you anymore woe
[1:51:20] is me so I am undone because I'm a man
[1:51:27] of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst
[1:51:31] of a people of unclean lips and any
[1:51:37] please do this in the context for mine
[1:51:39] eyes have seen the king the Lord of
[1:51:41] hosts so when people are hiding what's
[1:51:45] going on in their lives it's because
[1:51:47] they have yet to see the king the Lord
[1:51:51] of hosts because once you see the king
[1:51:55] the Lord of hosts it means you have
[1:51:56] stopped looking at man there are no more
[1:51:59] use iers in your life and all I'd left
[1:52:02] to see that could help you along your
[1:52:04] journey to the rapture is to see the
[1:52:06] king
[1:52:06] because only in the presence of the king
[1:52:09] can you get the help that you need so my
[1:52:12] simple objective this morning is to
[1:52:15] point you to the king and to remind you
[1:52:18] that he is here and to remind you that
[1:52:20] he is on his throne and to remind you to
[1:52:23] check yourself because I'm trying to
[1:52:26] check myself this morning I can't check
[1:52:29] you too oh let me say that one more time
[1:52:35] I'm not here this morning to tell you
[1:52:37] what you're doing wrong I'm trying to
[1:52:39] solve my problem this morning just like
[1:52:42] Isaiah I'm trying to come to terms in
[1:52:45] the presence of God what I need to do
[1:52:48] [Music]
[1:53:00] I'm losing my I'm losing my voice a
[1:53:03] little bit because the devil doesn't
[1:53:08] like to get exposed whether Branham said
[1:53:14] switch on the light and all the insects
[1:53:16] ants of course scampering we are here a
[1:53:19] small to switch on the light in your
[1:53:21] life because he is the light in the true
[1:53:26] room it's like they're smokers in census
[1:53:29] worship there's praises and frames don't
[1:53:34] be afraid of it don't be afraid of it
[1:53:38] it's like telling a child take the
[1:53:41] bitter medicine it might burn now but
[1:53:45] you're gonna get better if you don't
[1:53:47] take if you're gonna stay in trouble if
[1:53:50] you don't take it you're gonna steal in
[1:53:52] pain but if you take the treatment this
[1:53:54] morning from the master surgeon who's on
[1:53:57] the throne from the doctor on the throne
[1:54:00] this morning you'll be all right can we
[1:54:06] take a little more war is me I'm in
[1:54:10] trouble if a prophet could be in trouble
[1:54:19] don't you think preachers get in trouble
[1:54:23] if a prophet get in trouble don't you
[1:54:27] think ministers get in trouble if a
[1:54:30] prophet you get in trouble don't you
[1:54:31] think Ellis and get in trouble if a
[1:54:34] prophet I get in trouble do you think
[1:54:36] deacons I get in trouble evening a
[1:54:38] prophet to get in trouble you think I
[1:54:40] should get in trouble there are young
[1:54:45] people who look at their parents and
[1:54:47] they know that something is not right
[1:54:49] and instead of praying that God help
[1:54:53] them they disrespect them not knowing
[1:54:57] that their parent needs an experience
[1:54:59] just as the young person needs an
[1:55:01] spirits with God the attitude changes
[1:55:10] when you get the picture that every
[1:55:13] single person in this room is not here
[1:55:15] to show but here to get an encounter
[1:55:18] with God I'm the first to say I'm undone
[1:55:26] can you admit it when the Prophet spoke
[1:55:32] about he said I'm undone
[1:55:33] woe is me this strips the self-righteous
[1:55:40] skirt to the floor feeling like nobody
[1:55:43] knows the trouble you see in and deep
[1:55:46] down inside you being eaten up because
[1:55:50] you have been leaning on other stuff and
[1:55:56] God is systematically breaking all the
[1:55:59] stuff around you until you have nothing
[1:56:02] a lead on until nobody else when you
[1:56:05] look around you there's nobody there
[1:56:10] left alone I'm undone I am unfinished I
[1:56:20] am incomplete I am NOT okey
[1:56:31] all scriptures have to be taken in its
[1:56:33] correct context when Moses was about to
[1:56:39] open up the Red Sea stand still and see
[1:56:41] the salvation of the Lord that was
[1:56:44] appropriate then when Potiphar's wife
[1:56:47] was coming to Joseph Jews his stand
[1:56:52] still and see the salvation of the Lord
[1:56:58] but as you see by quoting scripture
[1:57:00] isn't that what wrong Scripture there's
[1:57:07] a time to say let the weak say I am
[1:57:09] strong that has his context but is it
[1:57:14] trying to say Lord who is me I'm undone
[1:57:17] I need help America I'm here this
[1:57:20] morning because I need deliverance I'm
[1:57:28] not trying to impress anybody I'm not
[1:57:31] trying to people to think I'm I'm
[1:57:33] because I'm shooting I'm shooting that
[1:57:35] everything is all right Lord woe is me
[1:57:37] because I'm in your presence this
[1:57:39] morning and I cannot afford to go home
[1:57:42] the same way that I came
[1:57:44] [Applause]
[1:57:48] [Music]
[1:57:57] said it's a sunday-school class this
[1:57:59] morning very simple I wanna make sure
[1:58:02] that's Neal this down so you get it a
[1:58:05] picture of that scenario that scene a
[1:58:08] vision of what took place not just to
[1:58:10] see it externally but to put yourself in
[1:58:13] that same place I say I was a religious
[1:58:22] man spiritual man living in a religious
[1:58:26] nation spiritual nation God's nation
[1:58:29] God's people there had been no switched
[1:58:32] from the Jewish dispensation to the
[1:58:34] Gentile dispensation to that time they
[1:58:37] were still thoughts people he had
[1:58:39] responsibility with the holy things of
[1:58:42] God yet until that moment he had never
[1:58:44] fully seen the holiness of God he had
[1:58:48] been operating in his ministry and had
[1:58:51] never seen the Lord miss it one more
[1:59:00] time Isaiah had been operated in his
[1:59:03] ministry and had never seen the Lord
[1:59:06] have you seen the Lord have you had that

[1:59:27] the Lord he understood that all of our
[1:59:30] human righteousness is as filthy rags he
[1:59:36] understood it has nothing that we can do
[1:59:38] of our own accord there's no sacrifice
[1:59:40] that we can make no good thing we could
[1:59:42] produce nothing I will ever give us the
[1:59:45] right to even stand in the presence of
[1:59:48] God he didn't even activate the presence
[1:59:51] of God God chose to show himself to
[1:59:54] Isaiah like he has come to show himself

[2:02:39] wanting I'm nothing and I pray that the
[2:02:42] angel will take the coals
[2:02:44] with the tongs and place it upon my lips
[2:02:47] i Stern Lord I'm still reading a prayer
[2:02:59] from the Prophet and asked for cleansing

[2:03:08] would want for Lord Jesus I'm a man of
[2:03:11] unclean lips as Isaiah cried dwelling
[2:03:14] with people of unclean lips and war as
[2:03:17] me for I see the revelation now he's
[2:03:20] placing it in context for us in the
[2:03:22] message for I see the revelation of God
[2:03:25] being made manifest as Isaiah saw the
[2:03:28] angel in the temple I see the endtime
[2:03:31] Lord and war is me and my family woe is
[2:03:34] me and my people or eternal God have
[2:03:38] mercy upon us I plead for myself and the
[2:03:41] people let us not perish with those who
[2:03:44] believe not but may we live with the
[2:03:47] believers

[2:03:56] hallelujah hallelujah the musician get
[2:03:59] rid get ready I'm not gonna be too much
[2:04:00] longer then flew one of the seraphim's
[2:04:03] unto me having a light cold in his hand
[2:04:07] which he had taken from the tongues with
[2:04:10] the tongue some of the altar and he
[2:04:12] leaned it upon my mouth and said lo this
[2:04:15] has touched her lips and an iniquity is
[2:04:18] taken
[2:04:19] we and I sin perched in other words
[2:04:23] beyond Isiah recognising his own
[2:04:26] uncleanness and that of the people Isiah
[2:04:29] actually saw the willingness of God to
[2:04:32] forgive anyone who would turn back to
[2:04:34] him anyone who would confess to him or
[2:04:37] God was looking for from Isiah was a
[2:04:40] confession a confession of the desire to
[2:04:45] be changed a confession of what you know
[2:04:48] to be wrong a confession of your need
[2:04:50] Isiah enough to plead for it he didn't
[2:04:53] have to beg for it mercy came and
[2:04:55] touched him and he became aware that it
[2:04:59] was the delight of God to forgive and to
[2:05:02] cleanse in a message God's power to
[2:05:05] transform but around said Isaiah lips he
[2:05:07] was just an ordinary man of unclean lips
[2:05:10] he said Lord I'm among unclean people
[2:05:13] and I got unclean lips boys me because
[2:05:15] I've seen the Lord and an angel came
[2:05:18] down cut the fire wooley fire off of
[2:05:21] God's altar and transform his lips from
[2:05:26] the lips of a wandering man to the lips
[2:05:28] of a prophet with thus saith the Lord
[2:05:31] courts transforming power hallelujah
[2:05:36] thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah Oh
[2:05:42] blessed be the name of the Lord in a
[2:05:46] message influenced better bound said
[2:05:49] then what you could mean to pay
[2:05:50] something softly when he confess his
[2:05:52] sins then come the cleansing or you
[2:05:56] cannot become you cannot be clean from
[2:05:58] your sin until you confess it's sin till
[2:06:01] you recognize it sin then come the
[2:06:03] cleansing as soon as he said woe is me
[2:06:06] for my eyes have seen the vindication of
[2:06:09] a great God the Angels the burners the
[2:06:13] sacrifices I hear and the posts is
[2:06:16] moving at their voice and here they are
[2:06:18] in this vision flying back and forth he
[2:06:22] had saw something real a vision or come
[2:06:24] down
[2:06:25] he said I'm a man of unclean lips and I
[2:06:27] dwell among unclean people said he cried
[2:06:29] out for mercy and
[2:06:31] himself a sinner then what happened one
[2:06:33] of the cherubims went over to the old
[2:06:35] tongue and took the tongue he could be
[2:06:37] in a play take me into the Holy of
[2:06:39] Holies one more time and took the
[2:06:41] tongues and pick up a live coal and
[2:06:43] picked it on his hand not carried in a
[2:06:46] tongue now picked up the coal put it in
[2:06:48] his hand and come and laid it upon the
[2:06:50] prophet's lips and said that anything
[2:06:53] could you what is iniquity but the
[2:06:56] Branham said iniquity is something that
[2:06:58] you know it's wrong and still holding on
[2:07:01] to it we know your creature on all your
[2:07:04] behavior is wrong and still hold on to
[2:07:06] it
[2:07:06] he said that's iniquity but when he
[2:07:09] confessed that he was wrong there was a
[2:07:11] cleansing power he took a call of fire
[2:07:14] we see how God sets his servants in
[2:07:18] order and what he fixed him with her
[2:07:20] weaker being humble reverent and put his
[2:07:24] self in action watch when he cleanse a
