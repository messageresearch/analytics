I remember as a young Christian I saw [music] where the Bible telling me young men shall utterly fall and fail but they that [music] wait upon the Lord shall be left and my heart I pray God make me a young man that will wait upon you. You can't ever go wrong waiting upon God. The [music] right answer will come true.

So this morning is a special service we have for you this morning. We're going to go to Lagos, Nigeria. It's a message that I never preach here, but I preach across there. Rooted and grounded, [music] and it will speak for itself. Just enjoy it. We're going to go straight into it. Brother Brother Shane, this is the message that I felt led to preach in Legos, Nigeria.

Let your Holy Spirit let your spirit [music] every situation [music] every situation [music] all my [singing] [music] Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Father's [music] father. Hallelujah. [music] Glory to God. Oh, [music] [music] heat, [music] heat. Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my [music] god. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; that control [music] my you [music] [music] Yeah. Heat. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Can I give you praise [music] beless? [music] Hallelujah. [music] Hallelujah. Yes. Yes. Yes. Thank you, [music] Jesus. Glory. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. And amen. [music] God richly bless you and good morning. God bless you. God bless you. It's great to see We are still in thanksgiving mode. That's what we should be. God, entice us with praise and thanksgiving, letting the devil know on which side you are on. On whose side you are on. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Before you sit down, let me just read to you from 1 Corinthians chapter 13 and I'll read verses 1-13. 1 Corinthians 13 and verse one um through verse 13. It reads on these wise. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, &gt;&gt; and become a sounding barazzle, a tingling symbol. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. &gt;&gt; And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profited me nothing. Charity suffereth long and is kind. Charity envied not. Charity vaunted not itself. Is not puffed up. Does not behave itself unseemly. Seketh not her own. Is not easily provoked. Thinkketh no evil. Rejustth not in iniquity, but rejusted in the truth. &gt;&gt; Be beareth all things. Believeth all things. Hopeeth all things. Endureth all things. Charity never failth. &gt;&gt; But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail. &gt;&gt; Whether there be tongues, they shall cease. &gt;&gt; Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. &gt;&gt; For we know in path, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in path shall be done away. &gt;&gt; When I was a child, I spoke as a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child, but when I began, I put away childish things. For now, we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in path, but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abide in faith, hope, charity, these three, but the greatest of these is charity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add his blessing of his holy words. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Please be seated. Good morning. One more time. God bless. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Um all right. So this morning as my not a little late uh but but this morning brother the oid is speaking for us live. Amen. Brother Theo came into town um for brother of Isaac's meeting in Neway last weekend. totally an outstanding you know series of services and he he he spoke two messages there uh and of some have compassion and to brotherly the second one was and to brotherly charity totally outstanding message of the chaps for those of you who saw them I know you would know exactly what I mean and I would encourage those who haven't seen them to try and you know get find the time to listen to those messages is I'm sure you it will impact your life very greatly &gt;&gt; and and um um for this morning Theo is here he's going to speak for us but we know years [applause] &gt;&gt; brother Isaac was speaking about the 93 convention and the impact you know brother Roto they were but all of us were but little boys at the time &gt;&gt; and I've known brother theo from way back in the early ' 80s, 81, 82, 83, and we go talking about that during the week.

I've been together ever since by the grace of God &gt;&gt; and um after all the events of the early two 2020 2010s and uh brother the church in Trina you know started having the convention in Trina 2015 and they've been a massive blessing to all of us &gt;&gt; and so brother theo you know him you know his ministry you know the blessing he's been to all of us not just nature but all over the world down through the Yes. [applause] Amen. And for those younger folks who don't know, that's brother Isaac OI's dad. For the younger folks whom I think he shares the same last name with brother Isaac, but I know brother Isaac is a favorite with many of you young folks. So, but brother Isaac, I mean, brother Theo is here this morning and he's coming right into this Thanksgiving mode. What a time we're going to have this morning. Amen. [cheering] [applause] So, without much further ado, I want you to stand to your feet and let's give brother Oid a real welcome as he comes to bring the word of the Lord this morning to us. [applause] [music] [applause] [music] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Theo was asking me about the songs that they like African Nigerian. So, I say, "Yeah." So, so let's let's get a Nigerian song to welcome him. So, [music] Isaac says he's like he's evil. So, maybe we'll find a track for brother Obi before he goes also. And Isaac says he's tricky maker. So, [laughter] so um so these Nigerian songs might be foreign to brother Theo, but we'll we'll brother Theo we'll work on that. Okay. So, let's get a Nigerian song.

[music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. One more [music] chance. Hallelujah. Glory. [music] [music] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. [music] Hallelujah. Glory. [music] The shout of the king is in the camp. HALLELUJAH. GOD IS NOT DEAD. HE IS STILL ALIVE. HALLELUJAH. OH, praise the name of the Lord. God bless you. Welcome to LCL Legos. [music] Oh, it's good to be here. God bless you. May be seated. I'm not much of a talker before the word, [laughter] but I want to bring greetings from the headstone table of Trinidad. We are happy to be identified with you all. &gt;&gt; I've known brother Ulu since 1981. We have been friends ever since. &gt;&gt; And it's a great blessing to be associated with you all. He preached a powerful message in Neri and he took the text, the scripture, uh the thought from what God told brother Brham, if you could get the people to believe you, &gt;&gt; not even cancer will stand in your way. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's very very powerful because that's not if the people hear you preach or teach, but if the people could see what kind of life you're living &gt;&gt; and believe you to be that kind of son or servant, &gt;&gt; that means God must trust that man &gt;&gt; and then you could trust that man &gt;&gt; because God trusts that man. &gt;&gt; How could you not trust somebody that God trusts? Oh, praise the name of the Lord. So for years we have been identified with this message. But now what you're about to see is the message identify itself with the sons and daughters of God where God can say this is my beloved son. Regardless of what the ministers say, regardless what the message popes, preachers, teachers, INTELLECTUAL GIANTS SAY. THIS IS MY BELOVED son in whom I'm well pleased. or you may be seated. God is not adopting the position the man has. God is not adopting because you're an engineer or a doctor or a pastor or teacher. God adopting the man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Saul failed, he said, "I found a better man." &gt;&gt; He found David. He wasn't READY YET, BUT HE GOD FOUND HIM. HE WASN'T READY YET, BUT GOD ANOINTED HIM. HE WASN'T READY YET, BUT GOD WAS WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. NOT BECAUSE IT DON'T SEEM HE'S NOT THERE. SOMETIME HE JUST STAY SILENT. THEN HE UNVEILS HIMSELF. THEN HE reveals himself. THEN HE SHOWS HIMSELF. GOD IS ALIVE THIS MORNING. HALLELUJAH. So this morning, there's something upon my heart. I like to share with you. If you have your Bibles, I like to turn to Colossians chapter 2. Want to read from verse 5 to 7? &gt;&gt; Ephesians 3 from 14-21. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6 from 10-17. &gt;&gt; Want to read Colossians 2. But my got the Bible. Thank you. When I saw this Bible, he have it all big writing. Got these eyes, you know, these fine print and so on like that. You had to almost get a magnifying glass to read some of these things. So, Colossians chapter 2, reading from verse 5. And though I be absent in the flesh, &gt;&gt; yet am I with you in the spirit, &gt;&gt; joining and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. &gt;&gt; As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as he have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. And then Ephesians 3, reading from verse 14, Paul speaks, above all things, above all these things, put on charity, which is the bond of the perfectness. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye are uh you you you are uh called into one body and be thankful. Let the word of God dwell in you richly in all wisdom. Something right here. Just minute. &gt;&gt; Glor some. All right. I can't blame this new Bible, you know. But let's let's go to Ephesians 6. I want to get I want to get um rooted and grounded. Huh? &gt;&gt; It's three. What? Oh no. I'm still looking in Colossians. I'm so sorry. I am still looking in Colossians. So I want to know where is this scripture? Glory. Do you have it? Ephesians. You read it first. Yeah. Okay. All right. Ephesians chapter 3 13 to &gt;&gt; 14. &gt;&gt; 14 to 21. Okay. All right. For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant unto you according to his riches to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that workketh in us. Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. And on Ephesians chapter 6 reading from verse 10. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and the power of his might. put on the whole armor of God that he may able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, rulers of darkness, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand in the evil with stand in the evil day, and having done all to stand, stand therefore, having your loins good about with truth, having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shut with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Above all, taking the shield of faith wherein he shall be able to quench all the fiery dust of the wicked and taking the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God. Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank you for your word and father, you know the needs of the people here. Father, I pray take me out of the way and may you be glorified in our midst. Confirm your word with signs, wonders, miracles, and healings. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen. You may be seated. As I sit down, we will give the Lord some praises. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; We'll have a title this morning, rooted and grounded. &gt;&gt; I didn't want to type that rooted and grounded in love. I just say rooted and grounded because it have people rooted and grounded in foolishness. It have people rooted and grounded in nonsense, in false doctrine, false teachings, and false revelations. So, I just want to say rooted and grounded. Everybody going to be rooted and grounded in something. &gt;&gt; But you, the bride, will be rooted and grounded in love. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have a subject. Having all done all to stand, stand. &gt;&gt; Having done all to stand. You have to know you have done all &gt;&gt; then you could stand. &gt;&gt; And have an inspiration. Hold the line. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. We're going to get to that. Hold the line. But Brandham in Titarian age, he was talking about the depths of Satan. He said it seems this verse has been left out by the commentators for they were not able to figure out what doctrine or what experience are meant by this phrase. Actually it is simple to know what is meant. What you have to experience or know is the depth of God and the opposite will be the depth of Satan. &gt;&gt; So then he read Ephesians 3, same chapter we read that Christ will dwell in you to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge. and that he might be filled with all the fullness of God. &gt;&gt; Now in these verses, when a man experience the depth of God in his life, it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of God indwelling him and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and the knowledge of God through the word. &gt;&gt; But the depth of Satan will be in that he will attempt to destroy this. He will attempt to make a substitute for this reality of God. How will he do it? He will take away the knowledge of the truth of God, destroy the word by putting his own. Yay had God said he will then substitute the personal Christ in our spirits. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the depths of Satan had been entered into that age. and the fruit of the depth of Satan are lies, murders, and horrible crimes that come from it. Did you ever think that those men who ever do anything for the kingdom of God stand alone? Did you ever think you have to stand by yourself? Jesus stood alone. All through the ages, he had to stand. They had to stand alone. And if you can only see, it is God's will to do these things for you. It is God's will to save you all. It is God's will to heal you all and he will literally lead you into deeper depths and higher heights. Don't be satisfied with your fire built here last night. Let us build a little further up the road tonight. Never build it in the same place. You can't stand still. You're either backsliding or going forward. Oh, glory to God. Praise God. So, you have to choose this morning. He said Moses choose the affliction and disgrace. Lot had to make his choice. 5 years from today, you may be a missionary. 5 years from today, you may be around Christians. Or 5 years from today, you may be in hell because you made a wrong decision. So God still put it on us to make the right decisions. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Daniel 10:1. In the 30 of Cyrus, king of Persia, a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Beltic Shaza, and the thing was true. But the time upon it was long. But he understood the thing and understand the vision. When the thing is true and the TIME IS LONG, YOU HAVE TO HANG IN THERE. YOU HAVE TO HOLD ON. YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE LINE BECAUSE THIS PROPHECY IS TRUE. The thing is true. BUT THE TIME IS LONG. OKAY. THE LORD A SHOUT. I CAME TO THIS MESSAGE WHEN I WAS 17 YEARS OLD. NOW I'M 67. THIS IS 50 YEARS. BUT THE THING IS STILL TRUE. OH, GLORY TO GOD. IT WAS TRUE WHEN I WAS 17. IT IS TRUE RIGHT NOW. COME ON, YOUNG PEOPLE. HALLELUJAH. GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. A THING WAS REVEALED TO DANIEL. THE THING WAS TRUE, BUT THE time was long. You may be seated. Daniel was in Babylon for 68 years. 68 years he kept the victory and was undefiled before God without the baptism of the Holy Ghost without THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE. He stood the test in the land of his captivity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. I Daniel by books understand the words of the prophet Jeremiah what was about TO BE ACCOMPLISHED. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Praise God. In the MIDST OF ALL OF THAT, DANIEL HELD ON TO WHAT JEREMIAH SAID. IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS TIME, WE HELD ON TO WHAT THAT PROPHET William Maria Brandham said. MAN SAID THIS, MAN SAID THAT. WE SAID, "SHUT UP." WE KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET said because the spirit, THE PROPHET, AND THE BRIDE THE SAME THING. OKAY. THE LORD HAS SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. HALLELUJAH. I HAVE NO NEW MESSAGE. I DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE. I AM PREACHING ANOTHER MAN'S MESSAGE. GOD SENT A PROPHET, ONE MAN, &gt;&gt; ONE MESSAGE TO GET THAT BRIDE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering] You may be seated. Daniel, no church to go to, nobody to fellowship with. Everybody went to heathen temples, NO CHRISTIAN SONGS, NOBODY BELIEVE THE SAME THING HE DID IN 68 YEARS FROM A YOUNG MAN FROM 12, 14 YEARS old when he was taken there. BUT HE HELD TRUE AND UNDERSTOOD BY JEREMIAH'S PROPHET THAT THE DAYS were almost accomplished. AND HALLELUJAH. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT the days ARE ALMOST ACCOMPLISHED. RUSSIA GETTING IN POSITION. HALLELUJAH. THE FACT GETTING IN POSITION. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. CHINA GET INTO POSITION. And America IS A FALLEN EMPIRE FALLING IN SLOW MOTION. OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. HALLELUJAH. BLESSED BE the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He made himself sack. I almost skipped that. How can we spend waste less time gambling swimming holes on Sundays? No time for the Lord. When the pastor speak something you don't like, you get up and go out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He went to prayer to find out about it. Hallelujah. The perplexed handwriting on the wall and everything else. How can we sit slotfully? How can we just run over on top of it? Time we are checking up, watching for this great hour approaching. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus give it very simply, you know. He said they build they given in marriage they sold but the day [sighs] l come out &gt;&gt; fire fell. &gt;&gt; So what he saying normal living &gt;&gt; no signs of the time of the hour. You can't look outside to see the signs is prosperity is is all kind of fancy car house land everything making it work easy technology and what not. You have to look to the word &gt;&gt; to see what is prophesy &gt;&gt; because someday something going to happen. Someday something going to change. &gt;&gt; It could be today. &gt;&gt; It could be now. &gt;&gt; It could be here. &gt;&gt; It could be with you. &gt;&gt; Everywhere I GO, I LOOK FOR IT. &gt;&gt; That love will drop down and take all the EVIL OUT. EVERYWHERE I LOOK, BECAUSE IT HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE, [cheering] &gt;&gt; BROTHER. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'll skip that. You talk about thus says the Lord, land shall be desolate. Prophesy. I prophesy that this whole nation shall become desolate. How about America? God shall punish this nation for her sin. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Something I keep saying over and over, this message world has not seen God's judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have not seen God's wrath. &gt;&gt; Understand this. The same God that brought out 2 million people, killed them. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; See, get quiet. &gt;&gt; The same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are Jehovah. Hallelujah. They dance at the bank of the river. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THE DANCE COMING OUT, THE SHOUTING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND GOD wasn't seeing them, you know. He was seeing all who getting pregnant. He was seeing the babies that was coming &gt;&gt; because he know that generation was going to fail. &gt;&gt; So he was looking to the next generation &gt;&gt; to [laughter] take them into the promised LAND &gt;&gt; because he's a God of his promise. &gt;&gt; He's a God of his word. &gt;&gt; TO BE GOD, HE HAS TO KEEP HIS WORD. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You know what happened? THE MINISTERS FAILED THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; You don't never see that before. &gt;&gt; No. I'm seeing it here. NOW, THE MINISTERS FAILED THE PEOPLE BECAUSE HE TOLD THEM, "GO BACK &gt;&gt; INTO THE land and bring evidence &gt;&gt; to my people. &gt;&gt; I'm a good God. I'm a great God. I'm a favor God. I'M A COVENANT KEEPING GOD." &gt;&gt; AND THEY WENT INTO THE LAND. &gt;&gt; 12 MINISTERS WENT INTO THE LAND. &gt;&gt; There's a whole association by itself. &gt;&gt; 10 of THEM COME BACK QUICKLY. [laughter] And they brought the Bible call it a evil report. &gt;&gt; It brought an atmosphere in the congregation of negativity, &gt;&gt; of darkness and gloom and lack of faith. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to go here, but I'm [laughter] inside of here already. I can't come out yet. I'm still inside OF HERE. &gt;&gt; WHEN it when uh uh Joshua and Caleb came back, they came back late. They had white coats and they the coat pink and it's grape juice. You know &gt;&gt; them guys enjoying theself. &gt;&gt; Them guys saw giants and they didn't bother. They on grapes. SEE &gt;&gt; THE OTHER GUYS GOD SAW GIANTS AND COME BACK ABOUT GIANTS. NO SIGNS AND WONDERS. GIANTS NO HOLY GHOST. GIANTS NO NO NO NO NO DYNAMICS MECHANICS. GIANTS NO thunders &gt;&gt; giants. THAT WHY WE CAN'T PREACH IT. GIANTS. [screaming] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T SAY IT. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Question. Question. Did the giant see you? No. &gt;&gt; You mean the giants didn't see you and you run back? You see in our eyes, you see that when it thinks real bad. When you see yourself small, you're real small. IN OUR EYES, WE WERE LIKE GRASSHOPPERS. Don't let the devil TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE SOME GRASSHOPPERS. [screaming] WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE ARE WARRIORS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN JOSHUA AND CALEB COME BACK, THEY COUNT NEGATIVE. Count negative. &gt;&gt; You know what Caleb did? You know what Bible say? He was the shortest man. &gt;&gt; He take a box to stand upon. &gt;&gt; I tell you, &gt;&gt; HE STAND UP ON THE BOX. CALL them shorty for now. &gt;&gt; Shorty on the BOX &gt;&gt; TELLING A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WE ARE MORE THAN ABLE &gt;&gt; TO TAKE THEM CHANCE OUT. &gt;&gt; Who you going to believe? &gt;&gt; WHO DO YOU BELIEVE? &gt;&gt; SHORTY OR THOSE OTHER EIGHT MINISTERS IN THE MESSAGE TALKING THE NEGATIVITY TALKING ABOUT WE CAN'T MAKE IT TALKING ABOUT WE NOTING THE BRIDE. OH GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. [cheering] CALEB SAID WE ARE WELL ABLE. AND I SAY TODAY WHEN THE PROBLEM IS GONE, BUT WE ARE WELL ABLE. 60 YEARS PASS, BUT WE ARE WELL ABLE. WE COMING UP TO 2026, BUT WE ARE WELL ABLE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Let be seated. [applause] [cheering] Daniel read the same books. we are reading this morning. Daniel read the same Bible, same punctuations, same sentences, the same thing that I'm reading. &gt;&gt; He set himself to order. And then he said, I understand, you may be seated, there'll be scuffers in the last days. I understand that there will be nations against nations. I understand there'll be tidal waves in the last days. There'll be fearful sights. I understand the women will bump their head. I understand they'll wear short high heel shoes. I understand the morow. Here we go. I understand that the preachers will be false shepherds in the last days that will compromise. I will not feed the people of God. If those eight ministers came back to the people and said, "Boy, our God is a good God. We the land is able." Everybody was in the land. &gt;&gt; But the people believed them wanted to Joshua and Caleb. God had enough. He said, "There's my red line. &gt;&gt; I bring you to Egypt, out of Egypt. You complain. I give you meat. I give you food. I give you water. I GIVE YOU MANA. I GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEEDED. But when you come to this borderline here, &gt;&gt; when we about to hit dynamics, when we about to hit the miracles, when we are about to hit the supernatural, when the dynamics of this church will come in and hallelujah, he said, then you worshiping the living Christ, HIM MOVING IN AND OUT. WHEN WE ALMOST THERE AND YOU TALK NEGATIVE, DON'T TALK NEGATIVE INSIDE OF HERE. HOLD THE LINE. &gt;&gt; HOLD THE LINE. WE ARE UNDER ATTACK, BUT HOLD THE LINE. &gt;&gt; Tell somebody, "Hold the line." &gt;&gt; Oh, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "HOLD THE LINE." IT'S A IT'S A ARMY TERM. WHEN THE ENEMY IS GREAT, WHEN THE ENEMY IS ATTACKING, WHEN THE ENEMY THINK THAT WE GOING TO STOP BACK AND GO BACK, IT MEANS DON'T MOVE [screaming] BACK. HOLD THE LINE. DON'T GIVE THEM AN INCH. Don't give them no room. WE ARE GOING TO HOLD [screaming] THE LINE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So Daniel Hallelujah &gt;&gt; took his stand. &gt;&gt; There are three realms that man live by. Be seated. The humanistic divine revelation and vision. [gasps] The realm of the mind and the realm of the heart are two different things. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Having done all to stand. &gt;&gt; Have you done all to stand? &gt;&gt; You have to stop going shady places. &gt;&gt; You have to fight the good fight of faith. &gt;&gt; You have to come into full obedience. You have to bring yourself into the order of the spirit. &gt;&gt; There's some people who just like to be contrary. Everybody saying yes, yes, yes. And they feel they have to say no. &gt;&gt; They don't want to be in harmony. &gt;&gt; They don't want to come in the order of the spirit. But there's something called the order of the spirit. You have to bring yourself in the orderly spirit. You have to be intentional to fulfill or accomplish the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; You have to purge yourself. Paul said it this way. I do not fight like the air. He said, "I run that I may obtain." &gt;&gt; You have to put away the works of darkness. &gt;&gt; But Brandon says, "You may have the biggest church in the country. You may have more money than you got, but God, that can have one thing to do with it. God wants a clean heart and a clean hands. He want a clean up church that he can show himself. Like the little woman with a pure heart and a defiled body and the Pharisee with a pure body and a defiled heart. It condemned one and say this is sweet. This is sweet. He called the woman having a pure heart &gt;&gt; but she had five and one. She wasn't her own husbands but she called her pure heart. A body defiled but her heart is pure. That's why Jesus could ask her the right question. Go call your husband. He didn't dictate or he didn't come to address what she was doing or how she was living. You know, he came to address who she was because her name was in the book and he was the book. So, he knew her. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Do you get that? DO YOU GET THAT? DO YOU GET THAT? HE DIDN'T COME TO TALK ABOUT HOW SHE WHAT SHE DOING AND WHAT NOT. HE CAME TO CALL HER OUT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Jeremiah 17:9, the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Who can know it? I the Lord search the heart. I try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to do the fruit of his doings. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Praise God. Moses tried to work it his own way, &gt;&gt; but there's a way for of God. It will never work. We must meet God's program word, letter by letter. There's where the Holy Spirit works. Make you do the things that you didn't think you would ever do. It make you repent and go back and shake hands, make up with the people. You could join church and still call yourself a Christian and hate down in your heart. &gt;&gt; And we have experienced it. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. One of the greatest challenges for me in one things that give me a a problem in believing is when Baram talk about unbelievers in his message. &gt;&gt; I understand the believers understand the believers but the unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Now I know &gt;&gt; ministers who preach a message they don't believe the message &gt;&gt; because they see what Baram's saying and they not they don't believe that &gt;&gt; I'll give an example. There is no such thing as a holy church. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost can be preached in it but in it you find good, &gt;&gt; bad, and everything else. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Under everything else is everything else. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's outside of good and bad. Then &gt;&gt; everything else &gt;&gt; in the church. So when a man show that his church is superior than &gt;&gt; above than higher than &gt;&gt; other churches, he doesn't believe what the prophet said &gt;&gt; because in every church have three kinds &gt;&gt; because the prophet said that. &gt;&gt; Do you get that now? So we don't want to DECEIVE YOU AND TELL YOU UP THERE SOMEWHERE. NO, you have to down there by the by the cross. &gt;&gt; Not up there yet. &gt;&gt; You got to hit the cross first. &gt;&gt; But Abraham talk about you could join church and sell call of a Christian and hate down in your heart. But you can't be led by the Holy Spirit and do that. You can't cheat. You can't lie. You can't pull shady deeds. It's got to be out of board. &gt;&gt; Okay, you may be seated. All right, let's go to the title now. &gt;&gt; Rooted and grounded. This word rooted is a Greek word named rizo. I don't even the pronunction might be right but it means to take root to become firmly planted fixed like a plant to be rooted for nourishment and stability. That is what rooted means. The grounded is another word pronounced timo. It's a verb to lay a foundation to make stable to establish on something solid. So Paul used these imagery of root and ground. Root as to identify the source or the nourishment or how deep you can go. So when the trials come, it give you deeper roots that you get a source from the source of life to draw into you. Isn't that right? A root system that you cannot be uprooted. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It makes you stable. continuous drawing from the life of Christ. Hallelujah. A tree joining its nutrients. Foundation gives stability. Foundation is stable like a building. So the root alive like a tree. Foundation stable like a building. Firmness in doctrine. Stability in character. Not given by deception. Not easily moved by the slay of hands of man. Isn't that right? So being rooted is where you draw your LIFE FROM. BEING GROUNDED IS WHAT YOU stand on. So God want you rooted and grounded &gt;&gt; in the love of God. So our direction is heading towards love because it will take love to enter deal. Do you get it now? NOT TO BE IN CHURCH BUT TO BE ANCHORED TO BE ROOTED LIKE PSALMS 1. BLESSED IS THE MAN THAT WALKETH NOT IN THE COUNSEL OF THE UNGODLY, NOR STAND IN THE WAY OF SINNERS, NOR SIT IN THE SEAT OF THE SCORNFUL, BUT HIS DELIGHT IS in the law of the Lord, AND IN HIS LAW, THAT HE MEDITATE DAY AND NIGHT. HE SHALL BE LIKE A TREE PLANTED. HALLELUJAH. NOT JUST REST THERE, BUT PLANTED. HALLELUJAH. WHERE? BY THE RIVERS of water, whatever he do going to prosper. Oh, praise the Lord. Some shouts in the house. Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's how God want us. Grounded, &gt;&gt; rooted, joined from the source. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your source is not Hollywood. Your source is not the world. Your source is not friends. Your source is not Tik Tok or social media. That's not your source. Your source is the word. That's where you want to draw from. Everything you have need of is in the word. And the devil of everything right now to give like shiny things in your front to face to shake you off the source. But God want you to get rooted. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. How let your roots go deeper. HEADING TOWARDS CHARITY, THE BOND OF PERFECTNESS, the love that passeth all knowledge. Praise God. Amen. So know how to stand. Abraham had to stand. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego have to stand. And the time will come when you have to stand on God's word and to stand alone. There's got to be a time when you separate yourself between your feelings and your faith. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord A SHAMAN READING. THERE'S GOT TO come a time when you're separate from your feelings AND YOUR FAITH. YOUR FEELINGS WANT TO STAY HOME, BUT YOUR FAITH WANT TO GO TO CHURCH. YOUR FEELING DON'T WANT TO PRAISE GOD, BUT YOUR FAITH, I HAVE TO PRAISE HIM. OH, glory to God. BECAUSE ABRAHAM STOOD AND HE STAGGERED OUT OF THE PROMISE OF GOD through unbelief. What was strong and faith-giving. GLORY TO GOD. GOD DID NOT SPEAK TO SARAH. GOD SPOKE TO ABRAHAM. ABRAHAM HAD THE REVELATION. SARAH DID NOT. HE HAD TO BELIEVE FOR HIMSELF AND FOR HIS WIFE. GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU WALK WITH Christ as an individual walk or you stand alone. &gt;&gt; Not you and the pastor. You and God alone. Not you and the deacon. Sometimes you and your wife or you and your husband, you and God alone. You stand alone on your convictions. Salvation is not a church affair. It's an individual affair. Church is a gathering place. You become in one common bong and worship God. But salvation is personal, &gt;&gt; isn't that right? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. You be seated. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. God brings tension into the church. &gt;&gt; See? Amen. Go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Still reading. You believe this prophet. &gt;&gt; Brother see this prophet. God brings tension into the church. For every son that cometh to God must be tried, proven, tested. &gt;&gt; He let sickness strike you. &gt;&gt; You don't have to say amen. Just tell the word. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching to your feelings. I'm preaching to your faith. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Nobody want sickness. &gt;&gt; I don't want sickness, but sickness could come. &gt;&gt; Last night, I heard some big big thunders. &gt;&gt; I had thunders. I don't even breathe him or what. I didn't look outside. I didn't ask for thunders. &gt;&gt; But the thunders had a crack. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you may be seated. He said the bright skies approve another not a sign of God's approval. &gt;&gt; The dark skies are not a sign of God disapproval. &gt;&gt; God's approval is in the beloved. You in the beloved. &gt;&gt; He can send you through the waters, through the flood, through the fire, through trials, through testings. &gt;&gt; It's his prerogative to do that. He said, "How shall we know we love God? By conducting ourselves with joy. am trials, he in his wisdom sends our way. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. How do we prove and show our love to God? By conducting ourselves. This a quote, you know. &gt;&gt; I know it by heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you press me, I will play. Let me [laughter] how do HOW HOW DO we know the love of God? How do we show God his love? By conducting yourself with joy amidst the trials he in his wisdom sends our way. &gt;&gt; He let diseases come on you to test you and to prove you to show the world that you are truly the seed of Abraham. He permits it by his own will. He permits disasters. HE PERMITS THE FRIENDS TO TURN against you. HE PERMIT ALL THESE THINGS AND TURN the devil loose to tempt you. HE WILL DO IT BUT TAKE YOUR LIFE. Oh give the Lord a praise and offering having done all to stand. WE STAND. SICKNESS OR NO SICKNESS. BOYFRIEND OR NO BOYFRIEND. GIRLFRIEND OR NO GIRLFRIEND. WIFE OR NO WIFE. HALLELUJAH. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT. [cheering] Having an order to stand. Stand. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He could throw you in a bed of affliction. He could turn your neighbors against you. He could turn the church against you. He can do anything. &gt;&gt; I I trust I'm preaching to the right group this morning. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not frightening you this morning. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I know Pastor lay down, you know. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. All right. Now, what about Abraham and Isaac on the mountain? One promise was given &gt;&gt; by his loyalty and his knowing, his faith in Jehovah. Watch. He said there was no greater he could swear. He saw by himself. Then he let Abraham be tested to the final point. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Now you see a minute. &gt;&gt; Now you could say I'm waiting for the ram in the ticket. God offer your son only son. But the ram is up there &gt;&gt; where the altar is at. You can't see the ram by the man say I waited but if the people of God hallelujah glory but God tell him I will offer up Isaac on the mountain I will show you not not he tell him no because he tell him he might take a Uber and pass straight &gt;&gt; so he didn't want to tell him he said I will tell you so he's riding go say here then Abraham said I in the lab we're going up and we coming back down &gt;&gt; he know God can't kill that child [cheering] &gt;&gt; if God brought him out and not bring him back That's the faith Abraham had. &gt;&gt; Abraham was so confident he laid Isaac on the Isaac was a smart guy. Wasn't foolish. He said, "Daddy, &gt;&gt; I see the wood." But when he sacrifice was no foolish guy, you know, father tie him up. A good thing wasn't a rebellious son. You want to fight? No. time up there. Come along with the knife. Go say I am hold your hand. Look at there. Look there. I am Jehovah Gyra. I could provide for you. Make that step forward. Take your stand. OBEY GOD. DO WHAT GOD TELL YOU. DO WHAT GOD SAY TO YOU. GOD IS SPEAKING TO YOU THIS MORNING. WHATEVER GOD SAY, YOU GOT TO DO. OKAY. THE LORD I SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He tested Abraham to the final point. HE'S GOT TO TEST you and me to that final moment, that time of decision when everything is away from you, you have to stand alone there. &gt;&gt; And so me and my house will serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. Though there be tactless coming to the church, though there be twisters, though there be all kind of false prophets, everything else in the church, among the people, in the neighborhood, everything. But for me and my house, we're going to serve the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; My Lord, a real Christian fight for his position. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Are we Christian? &gt;&gt; Shout out fight. &gt;&gt; Are we Christian? Fight for his position. &gt;&gt; You have a position in Christ. And in that position, the devil can't move you. &gt;&gt; The devil can't cancel you. &gt;&gt; David was anointed to be king over Israel. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE RAN FROM SAUL. HE PLAYED CRAZY. DAVID WENT THROUGH ALL KIND OF TRIALS, BUT HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE KING. &gt;&gt; Do you know you ordained to be in the rapture? Do you know you don't ordain to receive power? Oh, glory to God. A real Christian fights for his position. He has to stand alone. Him and God, he fights every inch. You don't have to baby them around. Hallelujah. So, after you prayed, you may be seated. After you obeyed, after you resisted, &gt;&gt; after you trusted, &gt;&gt; after you fought and used every spiritual weapon, stand your ground. &gt;&gt; Hold the line. Hold your position. &gt;&gt; Hold your testimony. &gt;&gt; Standing. Standing means you're not running. &gt;&gt; Standing means you're not retreating. &gt;&gt; Standing means you're NOT SURRENDERING. STANDING MEANS it is NOT A PASSIVE POSITION. &gt;&gt; STANDING DOESN'T MEAN PASSIVE. YOU KNOW, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; STANDING IS FIRM. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE GROUNDED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE LIKE A LIGHTHOUSE. &gt;&gt; WELL, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THE LIGHTHOUSE. [screaming] DON'T ARGUE WITH THE STORM. &gt;&gt; THE LIGHTHOUSE. DON'T ARGUE WITH THE SHIP, THE LIGHTHOUSE. DON'T ARGUE WITH THE DARKNESS. THE LIGHT WILL JUST STAND THERE AND GIVING LIGHT TO THE SAILORS, TO THE SHIP. THAT IS LEGOS. GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. LEGOS HAVE TO STAND LIKE A LIGHTHOUSE. UNMOVABLE, UNSHAKABLE, UNSTOPPABLE. HOLD the line. Hold the line. Hold the line. Hallelujah. You &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; may be seated. &gt;&gt; So when the thing is true and the time of one is long, it requires endurance. &gt;&gt; It requires fortitude. It requires resilience. It requires resistance. Resistance against slotfulness, resistance against apathy, resistance against hopelessness, resistance against the world and the things of the world. It means trusting God when the battle is long. You may be seated. Oh, give the Lord some shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Faith that cannot be tested cannot be trusted. &gt;&gt; That's why WHEN GOD GIVE YOU FAITH, YOU HAVE to &gt;&gt; tested faith. It's trusted faith. &gt;&gt; When God could test your faith, he could trust you. &gt;&gt; Trust in God when the battle is long. Ephesians 6. Watch. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord. in the Lord, not your strength and in the power of his might, not your might. You're being strong in the Lord and the power of his might. The enemy's job is to try to break you, break your faith, break you down, break you to a point where you want to give up. God's purpose AND GOD'S DESIRE IS THAT YOU REMAIN STANDING LIKE the tree planted by the rivers of water. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Psalms 125:1, THEY THAT TRUST IN THE LORD SHALL BE AS MOUNT ZION, WHICH CANNOT BE REMOVED, BUT ABIDETH FOREVER. OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. GLORY TO GOD. [screaming] STANDING IS A POWERFUL TESTIMONY. THE FACT YOU DIDN'T QUIT, THE FACT YOU DIDN'T RUN, THE FACT YOU DIDN'T HIDE. WHEN YOU FELL, YOU CUT BACK UP. YOU STOOD AS A YOUNG MAN, YOU STOOD IN A MIDDLE AGE, YOU'RE STILL STANDING AS YOU GET OLDER. [screaming] YOU HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. WHERE ARE THE CALEBS IN THE HOUSE? [cheering] &gt;&gt; You become like a time testing moral shining light to others. &gt;&gt; My God, I like that the lighthouse doesn't argue with the storm. &gt;&gt; Why you so stormy? &gt;&gt; Why so dark? No, it just stands and shine. &gt;&gt; Notice God didn't argue with the darkness. as darkness cover the earth. God's darkness cover [laughter] the people. God say, "How how long you so dark?" No, God didn't talk darkness. No, he just said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; GOD DID NOT JUST SEE DARKNESS. God spoke for light. &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. &gt;&gt; DON'T BOTHER ABOUT THE DARKNESS. LET THERE BE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Matthew 7:24 to25. You may be seated. Jesus speaks. Therefore, whosoever he hearth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I would liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock, and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, because it was founded upon a rock. And then he made the contrast, and everyone that he hearth not these things of mines, and doeth them not, not just hearing, but doeth them not. Watch shall lighten unto a man a foolish man, build his house upon sand. And the rain descended and floods came blew and great was the fall of it. When Jesus ended the scene, people were astonished. They said he took them not as as one having authority. Never a man speak like THAT MAN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE MAN WHO HOUSE is on the sand. &gt;&gt; Six bedrooms. &gt;&gt; Nice roof. &gt;&gt; The storm may come yet. &gt;&gt; You have guests. Nice garage, fancy car. The storm may come yet. &gt;&gt; The storm is coming. So that is why you have to be founded upon a rock. &gt;&gt; JESUS SAY UPON THIS ROCK &gt;&gt; I WILL BUILD &gt;&gt; HIS CHURCH UPON SAND. YOU BELIEVE TODAY YOU BELIEVE [screaming] TOMORROW YOU'RE SEEN IT NOW YOU'RE NOT SEEING IT AGAIN. YOU'RE ONCE IN A MESSAGE. YOU WALK OUT A MESSAGE. YOU HAVE NO [screaming] REVELATION. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Founded upon a rock &gt;&gt; and the rock is when this you hear from heaven. &gt;&gt; We could preach but then heaven have to reveal it. &gt;&gt; And when heaven reveal it to you, it's on your rock &gt;&gt; inside your heart. &gt;&gt; I like Abraham. Abraham had Isaac in the heart. He can't show Shar Abraham. Serious say where's Abra? Where's Isaac? She's revealed to me and go have a son. Check the doctor. Dr. T see him. Don't see him. You know it's a gimmick. After a few years, doctor said don't come back. Don't come back here. Old man go come back here. Go and drink some kind of coffee or something. Don't come back here. Doctor doctor give up on him. &gt;&gt; But the Bible said HE STACKED NOT. &gt;&gt; WHERE'S THE evidence of HIM STACKING NOT? BUT WAS STRONG in faith giving &gt;&gt; praises to God. EVERY &gt;&gt; EVERY SERVICE HALLELUJAH every praise HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH BELONGS TO GOD EVERY SERVICE THAT ARE COMING WITH YOUR PRAISES REGARD WHAT HAPPENING IN THE CHURCH YOU'RE COMING TO HOLD THE LINE BY YOUR PRAISES BY YOUR SHOUTS BY GIVING GOD'S GLORY BY THE PRAYER MEETINGS BY YOU BEING FERVENT IN GOD FERVENT IN PRAYER FERVENT IN PRAISE &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; The contrast must be made between the rock and the sand. Every man work will be tried. I'm reading this. This is I have here. There's a reason I title this message rooted and grounded. The bride will be rooted and grounded in love. But there will be others will be rooting and grounding in foolishness, in cult leaders, in false teachings, in false revelation, in false interpretations. Some on the way to the tribulation and some on the way to hell. You can't change that. We didn't make that. &gt;&gt; You can't move that. God help them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. 2 Samuel 23. Are we going good? &gt;&gt; 2 Samuel 23:8. These be the names of the mighty men whom David had. The Tashmonite that sat in the seat of chief among the captains. The same was Addio the Esnite. He lifted up his spear against 800 &gt;&gt; whom he slew at one time. &gt;&gt; One man, 800. &gt;&gt; After him was Eleazar, the son of Dodo, the Ahite, one of the three mighty men with David. And they defied the Philistines that were gathered together to battle. And the men of Israel was going away. He arose and spoke the Philistine until his hand was weary. His hand clave unto the sword AND THE LORD WROUGHT A GREAT victory that day. And the people returned after him only till the spoil. After him was Shama, the son of Agi the Harite and the Philistine were gathered together in a troop. THERE WERE A PIECE OF GROUND FULL OF LENTILS AND THE PEOPLE FLED FROM THE PHILISTINES. BUT HE STOOD &gt;&gt; IN THE MIDST OF THE GROUND AND DEFENDED IT. THIS MAN SHAMA, OH GLORY TO GOD. HE THE PEOPLE FLED FROM HIM AND HE STOOD IN HIS LENTIL FIELD AND SAID, "NOT TODAY. NOT TODAY." AND I AM [screaming] TELLING YOU, HOLD THE LINE. WE NOT GOING TO GIVE ONE INCH TO THE PHILISTINES. [screaming] HOLD THE LINE. [cheering] He stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the Philistines and the Lord wrought a great victory. SHAMA STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD AND REFUSED to run. Refuse to give up. IF YOU RUN, YOU CAN'T FIGHT. IF YOU RUN, YOU CAN'T GET THE VICTORY. YOU CAN'T RUN. YOU HAVE TO STAND. [cheering] God give us seven seas and seven thunders. &gt;&gt; God give us this Holy Ghost line of promise. &gt;&gt; We're not going to run from it. &gt;&gt; We're not going to let anybody chase us from it. &gt;&gt; Psalms 91 verse one. He that dwelleth in a secret place, note the location. &gt;&gt; Not he that dwells in Lagos or Trinidad. No. No. Know the location of this place. If you send this in Google, you had to find this location. Secret place. I don't think Google picked this up. He that dwell in the secret place of the most HIGH SHALL ABIDE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE MIGHTY. HEY. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. I WILL SAY OF THE LORD, HE IS MY REFUGE AND MY FORTRESS, MY GOD. IN HIM WILL I TRUST. SURELY HE SHALL DELIVER THEE FROM THE STATE OF THE FOWL, FROM THE NOISE AND PESTILENCE. HE SHALL COVER THEE WITH HIS FEATHERS. UNDER HIS WINGS SHALL DOUBT. [cheering] [cheering] But hear the bomb in verse 9. Because &gt;&gt; thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation. YOU HAVE TO MAKE GOD YOUR HABITATION. YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE HIS HABITATION. WHERE YOU'RE DWELLING [screaming] UNDER THE SHADOWS OF THE MM MIGHTY. YOU'RE WALKING ANOINTED. YOU ARE APPOINTED. YOU ARE INSPIRED. YOU ARE ELECTED. YOU ARE PREDESTINATED. YOU HAVE CHOSEN THE LORD. [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; The phrase hold the line. It's a military phrase. It means not to yield ground. &gt;&gt; Any ground. It means maintain your defensive positions and not retreat from an enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a TESTAMENT TO THE ENDURING human need for resilience in the face of overwhelming odds. 200,000,000 DEVILS LOOSE AGAINST THE BRIDE, LOOSE AGAINST YOUR FAMILY, LOOSE AGAINST YOUR MARRIAGE, AGAINST YOUR CHILDREN, AGAINST YOUR JOB, AGAINST YOUR MONEY, AGAINST YOUR BUSINESS. LOOSE AGAINST YOUR WHOLE LINE. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Why you say that, Mo? &gt;&gt; Because Joel said, "Blow a trumpet in Zion, sung an alarm in my holy mountain." He said, "I'm talking about a people now." Talk about you, a fire devoured upon them, before them, before them, behind them, a flame of fire. The appearance of them is like the appearance of horses, like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains. Shall they leap before their faces? The people shall be much pain. They shall run like mighty men, &gt;&gt; not weak men. &gt;&gt; I call you young men because you're weak. &gt;&gt; I know Bible for that. You know, &gt;&gt; I call you young men because you're strong. &gt;&gt; You have young, you have youth, you have energy. God can give you a vision to fulfill the vision BECAUSE YOU HAVE ENERGY FOR THAT. THE OLD MEN GO CONTINUE DREAMING DREAMS. BUT YOU, OH, THE LORD SHALL FULFILL THE vision [cheering] that the old man dreaming. THE LORD SHALL UTTER HIS VOICE BEFORE HIS ARMY. This camp is very great for he is strong [laughter] that executed his word. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham said, "You may be seated. This angel come didn't come from the earth. He come from heaven." He said, "The mysteries is all finished. Time shall be no more. Seven thunders throw their voices out. Will we run and leap over walls?" That's what Joel said. You know, we're going to leap and run over walls, right? Is there something fixing to happen that these old my violent bodies going to be changed? &gt;&gt; Time shall be no more. Then seriously think if it is then the pyramid is capped by the seven thunders. So the same thunders they rejected becomes the capstone &gt;&gt; become the head stone become the cap that rejected and therefore that they were going to come up the bride which is charity the bund of perfectness. When I come upon you the church world will reject you before the government squeeze us. You see how king tariff, president tariff want to come there and invade Nigeria and do work in Nigeria before the press comes the bride have to comfort be on display. &gt;&gt; What happened in Jesus time? Jesus you may be seated. You may be seated on this. &gt;&gt; In Jesus time he he was a child of that day. It had the old fire scar sees traditional people seeing this is how it was and the message 80 years and and so like that is the old folks and so like that but Jesus he came present tense bringing prophecy bringing miracles and signs and wonders and so on. What did they do? They rejected him. Who should we choose? Barabus or Jesus GIVE US BARABUS. &gt;&gt; WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH JESUS CALLED THE CHRIST? &gt;&gt; CRUCIFY HIM. &gt;&gt; So do you think the bride will just get away like that? &gt;&gt; No. same church folk. &gt;&gt; It will come against the bride &gt;&gt; because you're going to be the capstone rejected. &gt;&gt; You're going to be Joseph rejected. &gt;&gt; You will be the word manifested rejected. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Brandon, is this the mystery of the thunders that will bring back the headstone? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there is things in the thunders to do something because to leave here, we have to be kept. &gt;&gt; To leave here, we have to have power. &gt;&gt; Man don't have power. Power belongs to God. Hallelujah. I want to repeat that. Man don't have power. &gt;&gt; Power belongs TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. A minister can't bring a revival. The people have to bring it. &gt;&gt; You have to see something. &gt;&gt; And then you could run and produce it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Joel tree. Okay, we going good. &gt;&gt; That's what page I'm on. I have 20 pages on page 15. So don't worry. Going good. Joel 3:10. Beat your plowshares into swords &gt;&gt; and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weak say &gt;&gt; I am strong. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE IS TELLING THEM TAKE YOUR GARDENING TOOLS, YOUR GARDENING, your plers, your this. He said beat it into swords. &gt;&gt; Beat it INTO SPEARS. &gt;&gt; WHAT FOR? TO FIGHT. &gt;&gt; Prepare for war. &gt;&gt; WAR IS COMING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ATTACKS IS COMING, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND YOURSELF ROOTED &gt;&gt; AND GROUNDED &gt;&gt; IN THE LOVE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. He said, "Wait till them seven thunders to the voice, that group who can take the word and hand it to you, it will slice and cut. He will be slayed by the word of God." Hallelujah. Praise God. Whatever they say going to happen because it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God. It is his word but he always uses man to work it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You may be seated. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the type is rooted where you draw your source. Where you draw your inspiration where you draw your strength from. Roots is what going it looking for water. It looking for substance to draw. Because the more you draw is the more you grow. The more you draw is the more the leaves come out. The old leaves and your life will fall off. New leaves will come in because you're drawing from the source. And then you switch gears to be steady, to be stable, like a mountain, like a rock. H LIKE A PILLAR. OH, GLORY TO GOD. You cannot be moved. Praise God. But the brand himself said, "He that overcome it will make a pillar in the temple of God. A pillar, a foundation." Praise God. Hallelujah. These are those that took the word which they heard and went back to the foundation. And then he read Ephesians 2:19. Paul talk about we are built upon the foundations of the apostles and prophets. He let's go back to the foundation. Therefore, you're no more strangers or foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and the household of God that are built upon the foundation. Watch are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. What will I give him? I'll put him the doctrine of the apostles and prophets at the beginning. Isn't that right? And this is where he said, "I'll give you the new name." Praise God. I'll make you a pillar and I'll write upon you my new name. Go give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. So, you going to make you a temple. A pillar in the temple OF GOD. WHAT IS THAT? IF HE'S A PILLAR, he is not going out anymore. He is the bride. Oh, give the LORD A SHOUT. GOD SAID YOU ARE THE BRIDE THAT HE GOING TO MAKE A PILLAR. A PILLAR IS what the building is on. PRAISE GOD. TO STAND AS PART OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE BUILDING. THEY CAN'T DO WITHOUT YOU. THEY CAN'T MOVE WITHOUT YOU. YOU ARE PART OF THIS THING. THE DEVIL CAN'T MOVE YOU. OKAY, THE LORD HAS SHOUT. [screaming] YOU'RE ROOTED. YOU'RE GROUNDED. YOU'RE STANDING. [cheering] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, I come quickly. Hold fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown. He that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God. He shall go out no more. I'll write upon him the name of my God, the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down from heaven. And my God, I'll write upon him my new name. Praise God. It's to hold fast, to persevere. Don't give up reading. Put on the whole armor of God. Use every weapon he HAS GIVEN US. USE EVERY GIFT at our disposal. LOOK AHEAD WITH JOY BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO CROWN BY him who is king of kings and lord of lords. He is not only given crowns but he says that there IN THE BRIDE WILL BE MADE PILLARS IN the temple of god. SO THIS ANCHOR THIS ROCK THIS BUILDING THIS STANDING IS NOT JUST FAIRY TALE. YOU ARE GOING TO BE A PILLAR. GOD BY THE holy ghost within us he's going to make and overcome our pillar in the temple. What is the pillar? A pillar is actually part of the foundation. It hold up the super structure. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And brother talk about Revelation 7:14. Almost done. I heard the number of them which were sealed and 144,000 of tribe of Zabelon and so on. After this I beheld and a great multitude which no man could number all the nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before him before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in the hand saying salvation to our God which sited upon the throne. All the angels stood. That's the bride. &gt;&gt; He said and they said so uh who are these? and so on. Praise God. They will hunger no more. They will thirst no more. For the lamb shall wipe away their tears. Jesus come. He sealed 144,000. But there is another group that doesn't belong to 144,000 that we seen in verse 9 to 18. Who are they? They are the bride taken from among the Gentiles. They are before his throne day and night. They serve him in his temple. They are special care of the Lord. They are his bride. The bride goes wherever the bridegroom is. She will never be left by him. She will never leave his side. She will share the throne with him. She will be crowned with glory and honor. I will write upon him the NAME OF MY GOD, THE NAME OF THE CITY OF MY GOD. WHAT'S THE NAME OF GOD? OH, EMMANUEL, I CALL MY FATHER'S NAME. THEREFORE, THE NAME OF GOD IS JESUS. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WHAT NAME DOES A WOMAN TAKE WHEN SHE MARRIES THE MAN? SHE TAKES HIS NAME. [cheering] All right, &gt;&gt; I think the mission is going to come. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, our God, we come to the spring praying in the name of thy beloved son who has bid us to come. I ask ask the father anything in my name, I'll do it. So we come in Jesus name to first repent of our own sin and our shortcoming to ask you to cleanse us from all our iniquity and to purge our thinking that we will think upon the things that are right that pertain to the kingdom of God. We pray father to cleanse our hands, pile our hearts, wash us in the waters of separation from the things of the world by the word. And may through the word that was said, you are clean through the word. And we pray that the word will search deep into our hearts tonight and will cleanse us from all unbelief that may our heart be renewed by the Holy Spirit. And oh God, in this dark, treacherous are we living in as we look ahead for the world crisis, we only see darkness ahead. and you who promised our redemption time and John and the Isaac must pray, even so come Lord Jesus. And we pray that you will grant these things to us tonight and heal all that are sick and afflicted and comfort the saints, call sinners to repentance, RENEW US ALL THAT WE WOULD GO from here, tightening up on the armor of God to go for our shoulders, prepare for the battle that lays before us in Jesus name.

I love him. I love him because he first love me. [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; As an army, when the battle is hot and heavy, &gt;&gt; we have to hold the line. &gt;&gt; As a church, &gt;&gt; as a people, if the devil get a chance, he will destroy this church. &gt;&gt; He can't &gt;&gt; because the blood is over this church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and [music] burn to smile.

What was God trying to tell you? Hold the line. &gt;&gt; Hold the line. Brother Theo has no idea. All that happened that week, he has not one speck of an idea. You might think I'm spiritualizing something. This is what I'm taking from this service here. I'm thanking God who even when I don't say it out, he knows the needs in my heart and sent his servant here to tell you ROOTED AND GROUNDED. HOLD THE LINE IN THE FACE OF EVERY DEVIL. HOLD the line in THE FACE OF EVERY DARKNESS. LET THERE BE LIGHT. HOLD THE LINE. CAN SOMEBODY SAY HALLELUJAH? [music] The very next week that three Sundays ago, we were ALL OVER HERE REJOICING AND PRAISING GOD. HALLELUJAH. We saw the Red Sea OF DESTRUCTION. WE SAW VICTORY DANCE. And the devil said, "You think that's how it's going to be? You think that's how it's going to be? If you're not rooted and grounded, that next week you are GOING TO BE WIPED OUT." And that's WHAT THE DEVIL WANTED TO DO. But the Holy Spirit come here and told you supernatural interventions. WHAT IS THIS MORNING HERE? A SUPERNATURAL INTERVENTION BY the way of a message. Hold the line. OH HALLELUJAH. Brother I am so excited. Brother Theo has no idea what the Holy Spirit USED HIM TO DO THIS MORNING.

[music] [music] Oh, one more dancing town. [music] [music] One more time. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; You bring something. I'm I'm excited beyond words. But there's no excitement. This is rooted and grounded in the love of God from deep [music] within my soul. Do you understand what this message this morning means? As you go out of here, whatever the devil says, whatever he does, you are going to stand flatfooted, rooted and grow in law, you are going to hold your line. [music] If if you are sick and God has spoken to your heart that you are well. He has healed you on Calvar's mountain. The enemy is going to come [music] going to bring the symptoms worse. But what are you going to do? YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD THE LINE. You are GOING TO HOLD THE LINE. [music] The enemy is banging with a habit and you are crying for deliverance and you ARE CRYING OUT TODAY and you are saying thank you Lord for deliverance. The enemy is going to come tomorrow with A FIERCE, MORE FIERCE ATTACK. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? HOLD the line. Hold the line. Listen to brother Bham tell you this this morning. Amen. [music] It said his seat shall possess every gate of the enemy. Now the city is not battered at the gate. He will conquer and take every gate. He will possess it. And I say after the prophet in the judge of the living God this morning, lays the power to heal all sickness. What do you say to that? Amen. Do you believe that the devil WILL MAKE THE SYMPTOMS WORSE, BUT I STAND my ground rooted and grounded. I am not moving. Hallelujah. I have MADE THE LORD MY HABITATION. I live in him. LET THE DEVIL COME AGAINST THAT HOUSE. ALL THE line in the church of the living God LESS POWER TO OVERCOME ALL TEMPTATION. WHEN the devil comes and knocking, [music] tempting you this way, that way, THEY'LL THINK YOU OVERCAME THAT DEMON, that sin, that habit, WHAT DO YOU DO? HOLD THE LINE. Because in the church of THE LIVING GOD THIS MORNING, LET'S THE POWER TO CHANGE SIN AND THROW IT AWAY and receive the person of the Holy Ghost in the church of Jesus Christ. Whatsoever you desire, ask in my name and it shall be given to you. A little while and the word, the originated se will see me no more, but you will see me for I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the world. What the royal seed, the work that I do shall you do also. I VERIFY MYSELF THAT I AM WITH YOU. WHY? BECAUSE YOU ARE A CANDIDATE FOR ASSOCIATION WITH ANGELIC BEINGS AND THE SUPERNATURAL. Look all around you. Another supernatural event this Sunday morning. Hallelujah. He shall possess the the seed of the enemy. He shall possess, he shall possess the gate of his enemy. No matter what the gate is, if it's sickness, if it's temptations, if it's sin, WHATEVER GATE IT IS, IT is already conquered. And the seed of Abraham possesses it. Aren't you happy this morning to know that we stand now more than a conqueror? I'm reading more than a conqueror. Oh, there's nothing to fight about. Nothing to fight about. The fight is over. The whistle has blowed. The flag has rose. And in the midst of every sin path in the midst of every sick room is the old rugged cross planted by the blood of Jesus Christ, a conqueror. Only thing we do is believe. Look, and live. I'll be with you. I'll prove. People come in the last day and say, "Oh, well that was, but I'll be with you." And the very things I did here on earth, I'll have been you [music and singing] doing the very same thing. Then they will know. They'll see me. My people will see me. He's telling you, you will see me. You'll see me tomorrow on your job. You'll see me when the direction [music] going to break you down. You will see me when it seems like there's no way out. When it seems like I just can't go on no more, you will see me. Hallelujah. And the world will not see me, but you will see me. Open your open eyes. The people will see me. The seed of Abraham will see me. They will recognize me. They will call me. The others will come in behind your eyes. You'll see me for I'll be with [music] you even to the end of the world. the very same things that I do, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall lead to also. Same kind of work. And today, the church of the living God has the privilege of standing and seeing the [music] conquering resurrected Jesus Christ, the son of the living God, [music] standing present, living in his church, doing the same thing he did then. then we possess the g of every enemy. [music] And as I leave you here this morning, hear the words of the prophet. If you've got an enemy this morning, [music] then my brother, my sister, there's only one. If you are a seed of Abraham, after hearing this this message this morning, there's not enough devils in hell that can KEEP THAT GATE BEFORE YOU. If you don't believe it, it won't happen for you. But if you believe it, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DEVILS to keep that gate before you. I don't care what it is. Walk up there as a promise seed and say, "I claim this for mine. This is mine because God swore that he will raise up Jesus and through Jesus, I'll conquer it. And I conquer it in the name of Jesus Christ." Step back and pressing through. Hallelujah. It shall possess the gate of the enemy. Then stand up there with your shoulders back with a holy boldness. Did you hear me? A holy boldness. [music] A boldness to declare the word of God. It shall be because it already was. Because Jesus died to save you from [music] sin, sickness, and bondage. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Then stand up there with your shoulders back and your shield are shining covered by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ with your plow shears into swords. The enemy will recognize it. If you have need this morning, talk to him now while we pray. you in here this morning while you have your heads bowed and all you that have a need will you just raise your hand towards Jesus and just speak it in your heart in your heart and say Lord you know my need now I've heard this morning and that's the Bible shall possess the gate of the enemy I'm coming to possess the gate maybe I have a temper maybe I need the Holy Ghost sin has bound me down I have a need but but I'm coming to the gate now I'm coming to I'm going to take it this Morning. [music] My gate should give away. I'm coming through. Hallelujah. [music] Clap your hands. [music] Go out of here today with boldness. Boldness to declare the word. Boldness to defy the devil. [music] Boldness to all those things that people not thought they were. honest not your brother, not your sister, [music] you boldness in the Lord.
