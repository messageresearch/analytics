Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this great opportunity that you've given unto us that we could gather together in this virtual room. And I pray your hand be upon your people in Jamaica that has suffered great loss from this hurricane that just passed by. And I pray, oh God, for your people here in Trinidad, even under what we have as a war oncoming war that is coming. I pray give your people faith and great courage to stand this hour Lord because we have been sitting in this message for quite a long time but Lord you're calling us to maturity you're calling us to deal with what's ahead and the challenges that lays ahead be with us be with us tonight as we approach your word remember those that are sick among us may touch brother in a special way tonight and any person sick mean a special touch on you may your presence go by your word and heal them and touch them and deliver I commit their lives into your hands, this session into your hands in Jesus name. Amen and amen. God bless you. So, God bless you. It's good to be back home uh from this trip and I want to thank you all for your prayer. God did bless and um you'll be hearing more more of it. But right now um the atmosphere in the country long line by gas stations, people line up in groceries to stock up for this war that's supposed to be on its way. and America has um placed all air forces and and aircraft carriers. What a time to be in the Caribbean and um understand that some of Russia stuff is in Venezuela also um China. So we don't know what this would pivot to. Of course they're heading for the oil. It's all about the oil and the bride of Jesus Christ have to head for the oil. is all about the oil. And I want to share something with you today that came to me about war. And the title of what I have to share with you tonight, I have it here. The battle of angels has become the battle of men. So I think I'll read a scripture first and then we'll share what we have to share. I want to read from Ephesians 6 uh verse 10 to 19. Make your Bibles. We have another scripture to read. So the title is the battle of angels. has become the battle of men. You know what? Let's read Revelation 12 first. Revelation 12 7-11. Then we go to Ephesians 4. Revelation 12:7. There was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon fought on his angels and prevailed not, neither was their place found anymore in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, all the devil and Satan which deceived by the whole world. He was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying in heaven, "Now is come salvation and strength, the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ. For the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death. And we go to Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may to stand in the evil day, and having done all to stand, stand. Then it went on to talk about uh uh I'll continue read it to stand therefore having your law good about with truth. One having the breath of righteousness. Two your feet sh with the preparation of the gospel. Three above all taking the shield of faith. Four able to quench all the fiery dust of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation. Five and the sword of the spirit. Six which is the word of God. praying always with all prayer and supplications in the spirit and watching there unto all perseverance and supplication of all saints and for me that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel. Now we know America is phrased under Revelation chapter 13. The Bible talking about the beast. And the beast I saw was like a leopard. In Revelation 13, I saw one of his heads were wounded to death. His wounded deadly wound was healed. And verse four, familiar scripture. And they worship the dragon which give power unto the beast. And they worship the beast said, "Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him?" And verse seven of that scripture says, "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them, and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations. and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. So I want to share with you tonight that we all have to get away from this natural carnal humanistic realm to catch the purpose of God. This beast system has been given power over nations. That is why the Bible say who can make war with the beast. It's a system. It's a power. You cannot talk like this is disadvantage and advantage and the American forces coming down and little things real and you can't talk that. The battle is against not flesh and blood but ruling spirits. spirits that fell from him. I want you to think about it. War is not new. War is old because war started in heaven. Not only that, the reality is we are up against we are not up against flesh and blood and too many of us are caught up in flesh and blood. And if you think about it, if the battle is not flesh and blood, then listen, our human efforts, money, position, office, wealth, nothing of this earth or in this world of this world could fight that battle because your battle, our battle is not with humans but with spirits working through humans. Hence the battle of angels has become the battle of men. How many see that tonight? I wish so uh and I hope and I want to encourage you to put on your video put on the camera. I could see you. I would love that very very much. But how many understand tonight that this battle okay so we are triune being body spirit and soul. We have to eat. We have to sleep. We have to go to the washroom. We have to go to work. You have to whatever. See about family and everything that is at one level. But understand this. Don't ever forget this. We are spirit being and we are in a war with demons and devils and things that you cannot see with your naked eye. But they are deal. And we could see how they work and how they operate. Now, if you notice, America didn't just come say they're going down to war uh with Venezuela. They ain't come like that yet. They come and say um little narcotics want to stop the drugs and whatnot and one boat, two boat, big aircraft carrier and whatnot. They not It takes so much of millions of dollars to position forces in a particular area. It takes so much to do that that they not wasting time in it already planned plot it how you will execute it and I'm watching the drama unfold. I'm watching how our present prime minister take a certain stand and because of her stand we have uh the country is under certain stress of what is about to take place which is normal and it goes to show the choices a leader makes could affect an entire country. Same thing as a pastor could infect entire church. Same thing as a father in in in affect entire house, a home or a job or a business, whatever it is. Leadership is very important. And God call each one of you here in this room tonight to be leaders, not to be followers, to be leaders. That is why the Bible exhort us to be strong in the Lord and the power of the might. Now, American forces, they pick up people on the street and say, "Let me go to Venezuela. Um, you have a you have a gun." No, it doesn't work that way. The guys who going down there, they are trained. They are trained to know what weapons they have, how to use it, the mindset of war. Now, you will see by going tonight because we have to have we have to go into what I call spiritual warfare. We have to understand the weapons that God has given us and we have to understand how we are to use that. Now, if you are novice or uh a new scripted person, it is a bit difficult because you're getting to know and you're getting familiar familiar with the territory. But the reality is we are in a battle. And I hope tonight that this little exhortation will sort of wake up some of you all to cut the foolishness out as if this is just a flesh and blood thing. you know, you go home, you drop your children to school, you go to the job, you wash your car, you do this, you buy groceries, and I hope this kind of knock that out because it's like you see it, everybody's scrambling. I see so much cars lining up by the gas station, so much people at the groceries, they're stocking up. And when I think about it, where is the soul stuck up? Where is the spirit stuck up? Where is the heart? You know, Lord, I want something more. This is what the wise version doing. They were stocking up on oil. The foolish virgin, their oil ran out. And we have to think like true soldiers. Then we have to think that we are now about getting ready for the war. We come into service, you get an exhortation, you get an instruction, you're getting manual and everything else. But right now, we about to face into action. And that's why some time ago I read the scripture, beat your plowshares into swords. In other words, stop being on the defensive and begin to think that you have to become on the offensive. It's a difference. You're blocking, you're parrying, you're taking blows, you're taking blows, you're taking blows, but you're not doing anything. You're not claiming anything. You're not fighting for anything. You are going to church and then you're going back home. That is not a battle. There's a trip. So God don't want us on trips. God want us to understand why God sent a prophet. Why he take him off the scene knowing that somebody, some group, some people, some individual somewhere on planet Earth will pick up the prophet's prophecy and make it live. Who can make war with the beast? Not me. I can't make no war with the beast. But the Bible said they overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony. You have to have a testimony. You can't be caught up with them people running to the grocery. No, I'm not saying you can't go to the grocery and thinking. I'm saying you can't be caught up in mindset as the people out there who don't know better because we know better. This has been prophesied. These are things that are to be. But what about the bride? What shape is the bride supposed to be in? What consciousness are we supposed to have? And this is the challenge that is before us. So war is not new. War is old. And the battle of angels has now become the battle of men. Listen. So you your battle is not with humans but with spirits working through humans. The battle for territory, battle for land. The battle throughout all the ages have to do with principalities and powers. Now in Luke 10 verse 17, listen to this. This was an amazing piece of scripture and I'm sure if Isaac will dig into it, he would see a lot of stuff inside of here. But verse 17, and the 70 return with joy. This is Jesus guys, Jesus ministers. They're happy saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. So these guys have an anointing. These guys sharing in the inspiration with Jesus. They're not converted yet, but they're sharing with Jesus ministry. Listen to Jesus now. And he said unto them, this is amazing. They are rejoicing. They are happy. And Jesus said in the first words come out Jesus, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. So these guys are seeing manifestations of devils in subject to them. So they know they have broken into a realm of the spirit. But Jesus is seeing something and sharing it with I beheld Satan as a lightning pole from heaven. Next words, behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you. So what he did, Jesus saw the vision of Satan, fallen spirits and yet he released to them this promise of power over serpent, scorpions, over the enemy, nothing shall enemies hurt you. And then he dropped down to this. Now not withstanding in this, rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven. And here we have in the book of revelation, all that dwell on the earth shall worship the beast except those whose names are written. Now if by revelation or inspiration God show you or open up to you your name in that book, you have to be somebody that is praising and worshiping God amidst your condition, amidst your trials, amidst your situation because you are here but we have not faced a hurricane 5. So Jamaica just faced that serious problems, serious issues. Someday our time will come. Whether it's hurricane, whether it's earthquake, whatever it is, that is just the law of life, the law of nature is whether or not we will take to heart our trust and our confidence in God. So I want this to be an encouragement to you tonight to have faith in God. So Jesus said, notwithstanding in this, rejoice. In other words, don't we judge because preach unto you, but rejoice because your name is written in heaven. And in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said, "I thank thee, oh father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes, even so, father, it seems so good in thy sight." Okay, so let me share something with brother Brandham. Here what he said here. This great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven. When Mike and as the angel fought, Lucifer as angel and it first started, the first battle was in heaven. So sin did not originate on earth. [clears throat] It originate in heaven. And then here we go. It was thrown down from heaven, cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings. Then the battle from angels become human battles. Do you see it tonight? And Satan come to God to destroy God's creation. What God had created for himself. Satan come to destroy this. That was his purpose was to destroy it. Then the battle begin here on earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since. So the battle of angels have become the battle of men in truest sense. Now I don't know if people take Satan as an idol spirit or idol being. He is not. Jesus is the person that identify that Satan has a kingdom. A kingdom means he has structure. He has order. He has assignments. He has an army of spirits loosed to do mischief, to do destruction, to steal, to rob, to destroy. And we have to understand that our lives have to come into order, structure. Our lives have to come to be determined. Listen to this and I'll read this almost finished. Let me read this here for you. Matthew 12. Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil. Talking about Jesus, blind and dumb. And he healed him in so much that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. And all the people were amazed and said, "Is not this the son of David?" And when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "This fellow do not cast out devils, but by beab, the prince of devils." And Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them, these are the words I want to get to you. Jesus speaking of every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. Every city or house divided against itself shall not stand. So what Jesus is identifying here is a principle when things are divided problems. Things are divided a house divided problems. A city divided it will fall. So then he went in verse 26 and said if Satan cast out Satan then he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom [snorts] stand. It's a question. So Jesus is the one who identify Satan's kingdom that is structured that is ordered. So when the Bible said we wrestled against flesh and blood but against principalities, powers, spiritual wickedness is identify a structure and order. And just as as that all kingdoms have it, God's kingdom has it also structure. Order. And that's how God want our lives to get into order. And when people break the order, there are problems. When in the divisions, you have problems. And that's why the Bible don't want schism in the body. We want to know every joint is supplying what is supposed to supply to the body. This is not church. Now, this is the body of Christ. So, in closing, let me just say these few words. If you are not prepared to fight, you are finished. This is not a picnic. And I am are quite aware that all of you here in this room tonight would be aware of the atmosphere that's in Trinidad right now. I'm sure it is disturbing. It is troublesome. It is annoying. Whatever. But it's an atmosphere. It's something that we know is pending and there's uncertainty. I heard the army is called up. All the policemen is called to come out on duty and whatnot. They expect something. They're looking for something. And what about us? What must we expect? We cannot be just sitting back and just hoping and wondering. No, we have to be prepared to fight. If you have to fight, these are words I put here. You have to acquire weapons of warfare to know how to use them and be trained for the great hour of battle. This is not a game. So America is about to start a war to get the Venezuelan oil. Here Paul in 2 Corinthians 10 3 to 5. For though we walk in the flesh, here we go. We do not war after the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. So this is a discipline and I'll close with these words from the Ban. He says this, the great hour of charge is at hand. Soldiers with armor is gleaming, color streaming, faith and doubt is setting yourself in array in this tabernacle. This morning, doubt on one side, faith in the other side. Soldiers stand at your post of duty. Our captain, the morning star leads on. He never goes back. He doesn't know the word retreat. We don't have a retreat. The greatest battle ever fought, she is going on right in here now. between life and death, between sickness and health, between faith and doubt, between liberty and bondage. The battle is on. Shiniest soldiers polish up the armor. God is getting his soldiers ready. God anoints his army. America dresses their soldiers in the best that they have to dress with steel helmets, armors, whatever they got, armor tanks, whatever they go in. God dresses his army. What kind of equipment? the spirit, the sword, the word, the word of God, to believe his word. That's the way God arms. That's what he gave Eve to arm herself with. But she broke her armor down. How did she do it? By opening up her mind to reason. You don't reason with God's word. It has no reason. It's God's word. There's no doubt about it. There's no reason to it. You see what I mean, honey? He's talking to somebody there. God word promise it. They said to Abraham, "Oh, you know, you're going to have a baby." See, God said so. That's settling. Well, why you ain't got it? I don't know, but I'm going to get it. But I'm going to get it. God said so. That won't stop me. Why don't you go back to your home where you come from? I'm to be a pilgrim stranger. God give the promise. God will give the baby right in this land. He sent me. God will heal you right in this atmosphere of the Holy Ghost where he sent you. God will give it to you. Just believe it. Amen. Open up them flues of the soul, body, senses and conscience and just let God's word penetrate first. Take that mind. There is a battleground. Not say, "Well, if I could feel it, if I could feel the glory of God falling, that has nothing to do with it." Another thing, open up that mind. That's the battleground. There's where the battle sits in the right there in the front line, your mind. I doubt I doubt my doubts. I'm doubting my doubts now. and believe in God's word. Here I come, Satan. Something's going to take place. Sure, it will. And that's the end of my exhortation to you tonight. The battle of angels have became the battle of men. And when you mistake this this spirit thing for human, you find yourself fighting up at the humanistic level. This one don't like me. This one this and that one that. And that time is spirits working. And if it's pray spoken on your children, on your wife, on your husband, your mother, your father, your brother, your sister, your uncle, or your boss or your neighbor or your coworker, you are still not wrestling against flesh and blood. And that's why you have to pray. You have to pray for protection. You have to pray for guidance. You have to pray for covering. You have to pray for God's leadership. That's what we have to ask of him. Because the tools of our wealth warfare, we can't pelt money and pay off a demon. You can't take muscles and build muscles and say, "Well, you go fight a physical fight with the spirits." It not not working. So, the tools we need is from God. The power we need is from God. I'll close with these words. I want to close, but things keep coming. Samson with the anointing upon him covenanted by seven. After a while, it comes so normal in his strength that he thought he was the superman. When the Laya, the spirit behind him. So, so you're looking nice woman, nice shape, tall, whatever, whatever, whatever. He like her, he in love with her. She's been used, she's been influenced by a higher power. She's being influenced by heavy demons to get the secret of Samson seven locks to break him. And Samson, you could see a level of his ignorance when she did get the secret. And when she cut his locks, the Bible said he shake himself like before, but he was like any other man. Friends, we cannot go back there. We can't afford to be like any other man. That's what the world has. We are called to be a covenanted people and our God is a great God. He is a way maker. He want you to be able to acknowledge that he's a way maker. So you're not trying to make a way for yourself. You're trying to let him lead you. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight trying to exalt your people and it has been coming to me for quite a while. War is coming and war is almost right upon us. But Lord, the battle is not against flesh and blood. Prepare our hearts Lord because things is about to get started. Prepare our hearts because the bride your prophet taught us will be a haunted persecuted group. Prepare our hearts because we we were not called to sit on warm church benches and then go home in the rapture. Oh glory. No, we are called to higher calling than that. to manifest and to reproduce your original grain, even Jesus Christ back on the earth. There'll be one more ride. May the people get a burden tonight. A burden of this spiritual warfare that starts in prayer that starts with the understanding is not flesh and blood. It's a whole spiritual realm and we need reinforcement. When Daniel was praying and the angel Gabriel was busting and fighting through that was detained because of the raging warfare in the realm of the spirit. Your prophet taught us that if Daniel had stopped praying, the angel had to stop coming. Oh God, dispatch your angels tonight to every home, every family, every life. And as they pray, God tonight, may the angels come closer and closer and closer. Angel of deliverance, angel of healing, whatever they have need of, may you minister and meet their every need in Jesus name I ask. Amen and amen. God bless you. I trust then that this would help you. As we look to God and cry out unto him and to think that he's not finished with you yet, there's much more to be done. There's much more for God to accomplish through all that. And just as these demon spirits need a physical body to work through, the Holy Ghost needs a physical body to work through. Let that body be you. I want to repeat that. Just as those demons, spirits, entities without bodies, God put man in the earth in these spirits was kicked out from him and they're looking to enter into bodies to influence lives, to influence countries and nations. That's why he offered Jesus all these nations are mine including Trinidad. Just remember that all these countries, all these nations are mine. So, however he is being ruled, every country is under that anointing of the devil. But we are called out to be under the anointing of God. So, may God bless you as we get down in prayer.
