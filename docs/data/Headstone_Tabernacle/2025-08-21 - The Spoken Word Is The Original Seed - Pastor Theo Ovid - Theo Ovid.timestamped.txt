[17:37] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this evening.
[17:41] Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Let's just give
[17:43] the Lord a hand of praise.
[17:51] If you have your Bibles, like to just
[17:52] turn with me to
[17:55] just a couple verses in Psalms, the
[17:59] 92nd chapter, Psalms 92.
[18:09] Amen.
[18:10] And it says, "It is a good thing to give
[18:12] thanks unto the Lord, and to sing
[18:14] praises unto his name, oh most high, to
[18:17] show forth thy loving kindness in the
[18:19] morning, and thy faithfulness every
[18:20] night, upon an instrument of 10 strings,
[18:24] and upon the sulttery, upon the harp
[18:25] with a solemn sound, for thou, oh Lord,
[18:28] has made me glad through thy work. I
[18:30] will triumph in the works of thy hands.
[18:33] Oh Lord, how great are thy works, and
[18:35] thy thoughts are very deep." May just
[18:37] bow our heads as we opening a word of
[18:39] prayer.
[18:45] Oh heavenly father, we love you so much,
[18:48] Lord. Lord, we're so grateful and
[18:50] thankful and appreciative of this
[18:52] opportunity tonight. Lord, there are so
[18:55] many other places that we could have
[18:56] been, but you predestinated that we be
[18:58] here tonight, Lord. Lord, and we've come
[19:00] together under expectation, Lord, to
[19:03] hear from you, to have communion with
[19:06] you, Lord, to have such an encounter
[19:08] with you tonight, Lord, as was never
[19:11] seen before. Lord, we pray that you will
[19:13] anoint the words that will be spoken,
[19:15] Lord, that you would anoint them. And
[19:18] may they find good ground in our hearts
[19:20] to rest, Lord. Lord, I pray that you
[19:22] will inspire us, Lord. That you'll raise
[19:23] us up, Lord. Lord, that you will give
[19:26] strength to the weary. Lord, that you'll
[19:28] restore those that may be down tonight.
[19:31] That you'll heal the sick and afflicted,
[19:33] those that may have challenges. Lord, I
[19:35] pray that you would meet the needs of
[19:37] your people tonight. That you'll address
[19:39] everyone, Lord. Whether they're
[19:41] upstairs, downstairs, whether they're on
[19:43] their way, or they might be home,
[19:44] wherever they will interact with this
[19:45] content, Lord. Lord, I pray that their
[19:48] lives be changed and no one will leave
[19:50] this place or see this service and and
[19:53] be the same. Lord, Lord, I pray that you
[19:56] anoint musicians with songs that will be
[19:58] sung. Every word, Lord, every word
[20:01] spoken, every worship, every praise. I
[20:03] pray that you will inhabit the praises
[20:05] of your people, Lord. The worship that
[20:07] will go forth, Lord. Lord, I pray that
[20:09] you will anoint every word, every
[20:12] message that is spoken tonight, Lord.
[20:14] Lord, that it will be so meaningful and
[20:16] impactful. Lord, have your way
[20:18] throughout this service for the rest of
[20:20] the evening. In Jesus name we pray.

[34:56] that matters. Have your way. I pray in
[34:59] Jesus I ask it. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[35:02] Let the king be lifted up tonight. Amen.
[35:05] So, God bless you. If have your Bibles,
[35:07] I'd like you to turn to Genesis 1 and
[35:09] St. John 1 for a scripture reading
[35:12] tonight.
[35:15] Genesis 1.
[35:18] In the beginning, God created heaven and
[35:20] the earth, and the earth was without
[35:22] form and void. Darkness was upon the
[35:25] face of the deep, and the spirit of God
[35:27] move upon the face of the waters. And
[35:29] God said, "Let there be light." And
[35:30] there was light. And God saw the light,
[35:33] which was good. God divided the life
[35:36] from the darkness. And God called the
[35:38] light day. The darkness he called night,
[35:43] and the evening and the morning were the
[35:46] first day.
[35:47] And God said, "Let us therefore there be
[35:50] a firmament in the midst of the waters.
[35:52] Let it divide the waters from the
[35:54] waters." And God made the firmament,
[35:57] divided the waters which were under the
[35:59] firmament from the waters which were
[36:00] above the firmament. And it was so. And
[36:03] God called the firmament heaven. And the
[36:05] evening and the morning were the second
[36:08] day. And God said, "Let the waters under
[36:11] the heaven be gathered together into one
[36:12] place." But the dry land appear, it was
[36:16] so. When God called the dry land earth,
[36:19] and the gathering that g the waters
[36:21] called, he sees, God saw that it was
[36:25] good. And God said, "Let the earth bring
[36:28] forth grass, herb yielding seed, and the
[36:31] fruit tree yielding fruit after its
[36:35] kind, whose seed was in itself upon the
[36:39] earth, and it was so. And the earth
[36:41] brought forth grass and herbing seed
[36:44] after his kind. And the tree yielding
[36:47] fruit whose seed was in itself after its
[36:49] kind. And God saw it was good. And the
[36:52] evening and the morning were the third
[36:55] day. And from St. John 1 verse one verse
[36:57] verse one
[37:00] says in the beginning was the word and
[37:03] the word was with God and the word was
[37:06] God. May God bless his word. You may be
[37:07] seated.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Oh we are blessed privileged to be here
[37:15] tonight
[37:16] &gt;&gt; and I pray that God will speak to you
[37:19] because God will only speak by his word.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; The word is his tools. The word is the
[37:25] means in which he get the message across
[37:28] to the people.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; God himself subject himself to his own
[37:33] word.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; So I have a title tonight. The spoken
[37:36] word is your original seed.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Now I know brother preach a message on
[37:39] that but we're not uh but we'll see
[37:41] where the Lord will take us tonight. I
[37:43] have an inspiration. The transformation
[37:46] of his own seed word. Now words are
[37:50] powerful and words are seeds. Sometime
[37:54] parents tell the children the wrong
[37:55] thing. They don't even realize it's a
[37:58] seed that they're speaking to their
[38:00] children.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; A seed they're speaking to this one or
[38:03] that one. Sometime pastors may tell the
[38:04] congregation the wrong things or the
[38:06] negative things. But God uses his own
[38:09] word.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; We see it in the beginning in Genesis,
[38:12] God said, "Let there be light."
[38:13] &gt;&gt; And there was light.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; In other words, there's no other way for
[38:17] God to bring thing into being outside of
[38:19] his word.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Because in the beginning was the word.
[38:22] The word was with God and the word was
[38:24] God.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; So God have to speak it
[38:26] &gt;&gt; before it happens.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; He has to speak it. And brother Anthony
[38:30] tremendously brought out on Sunday how
[38:32] God took the waters and have to use the
[38:33] waters as a womb
[38:35] &gt;&gt; to get the fishes and everything else.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; He had to use an environment.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He couldn't bypass that.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; So he set it up that way
[38:42] &gt;&gt; because he put the built-in the fish to
[38:45] swim.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; He put that inside the fish.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; But you can't put the fish to swim on
[38:49] earth. You have to have seas for it.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; So God makes sure there are seas before
[38:54] he get the fish.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? He makes sure there's
[38:58] the earth before he get the beast of the
[38:59] field and make man because he for man
[39:01] out of the dust of the earth.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; He didn't fall man out of the sea. He
[39:04] for man of the dust of the earth.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[39:07] &gt;&gt; So God himself subject himself to the
[39:10] laws or principles of the kingdom.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he subject himself. He
[39:15] can't help it.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; The sun and the rain fall on the just
[39:18] and the unjust. He can't help it. The
[39:20] sun just shines. The rain just fall. But
[39:23] you have to fall on something.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; And that where the seed come.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So in the beginning, God had
[39:29] to speak a word for you.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Before he was God, he was
[39:35] Elohim. We know that self-existent by
[39:37] himself. But he had thoughts.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; And his thought is just as real as his
[39:41] word
[39:42] &gt;&gt; or his expression.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; So even though you were silent or hidden
[39:45] or sealed in his thinking, he had to
[39:48] bring you forth. And he had to create
[39:50] the environment for you to come forth.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Now, in the original, Adam was supposed
[39:56] to speak for you,
[39:57] &gt;&gt; but Adam fell.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; So, God had to not not redo his plan,
[40:01] but just reorganize how this thing
[40:03] supposed to unfold.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Because there were many attributes in
[40:06] him, he couldn't express if Adam come
[40:08] true. But because Adam fell, there was
[40:10] an opportunity for him to come with all
[40:13] the attributes of being a redeemer, of
[40:15] being a savior, of being a comforter, of
[40:17] being a healer, of being a whatever you
[40:19] want him to be. He was the I am that I
[40:22] am. He couldn't be the I am that I am if
[40:24] Adam did not fall. But because Adam
[40:26] fell, he a position now to become the I
[40:29] am whatever you have need me to be. And
[40:31] whatever you have need of him tonight,
[40:33] he could be that tonight. But he cannot
[40:35] come out silent his spoken word to
[40:37] produce that for you. He sent his word
[40:39] and you believe it and you're going to
[40:41] see the miracle
[40:42] &gt;&gt; after you receive his word. He don't
[40:44] give it a miracle first. He give it a
[40:45] word first to see if you will believe
[40:47] what he said.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; He's speaking about this. Let it bring
[40:54] forth of its kind. Whatever it was, it
[40:56] must be brought up of its kind. Now this
[40:58] word of God is eternal.
[41:01] God being infinite cannot speak one
[41:04] thing and then later change it to
[41:06] something else
[41:07] &gt;&gt; to a better decision because every
[41:10] decision of God is perfect.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; He cannot once his word is once spoken
[41:16] it can never die.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; It lives on and on and on and can never
[41:21] die because it is God.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; His word can no more die that he can
[41:25] die. And that's why Baraban pray for
[41:28] somebody and I can't remember what was
[41:29] the condition and the person come and
[41:31] complain and said they'll be you know
[41:32] they doubt and question. He said what
[41:33] did he say? She said he said thus say
[41:35] the Lord said whether you believe it or
[41:37] don't believe it coming to pass.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I do thus say the Lord.
[41:40] That's that's not my opinion. That is
[41:42] say the Lord. If God say the Lord, you
[41:44] going to be delivered. Nothing going to
[41:45] stop the deliverance. I don't care what
[41:47] your father, mother, brother, sister,
[41:49] neighbor, uncle, aunt, mother, doesn't
[41:51] matter who say what you are going to be
[41:52] delivered because it is thus sayeth the
[41:54] Lord. Thus say the Lord cannot fail. Oh,
[41:57] praise the name of the Lord. Do you
[41:58] believe that?
[41:59] &gt;&gt; So once his word is spoken, it will
[42:01] never die. And that's the reason. And
[42:03] then he quote this in St. John the first
[42:04] chapter. In the beginning was the word.
[42:06] The word was with God and the word was
[42:09] God. And the word was made flesh. The
[42:12] same word that was spoken in the
[42:14] beginning with his eternal purpose came
[42:16] on over and was made flesh and dwelt
[42:19] among us. God's word. Could we give the
[42:21] Lord some praises?
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right, let's go. Jesus
[42:27] was the fullness of God manifested.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; He was the fullness of the Godhead
[42:31] bodly. Therefore, when he came to the
[42:33] earth, he was manifested in flesh. You
[42:36] were here in him then
[42:39] &gt;&gt; because he was the word.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. The word
[42:42] was with God. The word was God. The word
[42:44] was made flesh as well among us. The
[42:45] word was made flesh. Therefore, you
[42:47] walked with him
[42:49] &gt;&gt; when you were in him.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he was on earth, you suffered
[42:52] with him
[42:53] &gt;&gt; and you died with him. You was buried
[42:56] with him and now you are risen with him.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Manifested attributes of God setting in
[43:02] heavenly places already raised,
[43:05] resurrected to a new life, setting in
[43:08] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That
[43:10] means so much to us to see ourselves
[43:13] positionally placed in Jesus Christ.
[43:15] Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; So at some point in time this have to
[43:18] become a reality that you could see
[43:20] yourself not just as an ordinary walking
[43:23] human on the earth but called to be in
[43:25] Christ Jesus placed in Christ Jesus.
[43:28] Isn't that right?
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now if we are those
[43:33] attributes of God if if we cannot live
[43:36] by creeds
[43:38] &gt;&gt; we cannot live by denomination. We must
[43:41] live by the word because the bride is
[43:43] part of the bridegroom. You can't live
[43:45] by Facebook. You can't live by WhatsApp.
[43:48] You can't live by what your neighbors
[43:49] say, your wife say, your husband say.
[43:51] You have to live by what God said.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can't live by your
[43:54] dreams is what God said.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Oh god. And God can't lie.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Everything God say, it's got to come to
[44:00] pass.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; And you know inside there I was just
[44:07] thinking when the Lord spoke to my heart
[44:08] when he was in Carwell that we me
[44:09] standing. I was just thinking about that
[44:11] and a brother came up to me a day and
[44:13] say nobody believe that you know I said
[44:16] it doesn't matter
[44:16] &gt;&gt; yes
[44:17] &gt;&gt; I said if God said it
[44:19] &gt;&gt; it will materialize
[44:20] &gt;&gt; it was a total impossibility I know that
[44:23] it's five senses seeing cocoa trees and
[44:24] see all them thing around or something
[44:26] like that didn't
[44:27] &gt;&gt; you understand in the bush
[44:28] &gt;&gt; but God said
[44:30] &gt;&gt; that we'll be here
[44:31] &gt;&gt; right where we are right now
[44:33] &gt;&gt; hallelujah and if he said that it has to
[44:35] materialize
[44:36] &gt;&gt; and everything God said that come out
[44:38] his must materialize
[44:40] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; So therefore, if we are the attributes
[44:44] of God,
[44:45] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Not your mother, child, and your who's
[44:48] your father and who's your mother.
[44:49] Attributes of
[44:51] &gt;&gt; God. And God is a spirit.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; That mean you are attributes son of your
[44:54] spirit.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; And the devil want you to wash your
[44:56] flesh. But you are attributes
[44:58] &gt;&gt; son of his
[45:00] &gt;&gt; spirit.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the attribute son of his
[45:03] spirit. Have to live by the word.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; You have to live by something. Man shall
[45:07] not have bread alone but I every word
[45:09] that proceed out of the mouth of God.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we are fighting for the
[45:14] words that came out the mouth of God.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; And the mouth of God at his are his
[45:19] prophets.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was not a false prophet.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; He was a true prophet. He's a true
[45:27] prophet and he got the word of God.
[45:29] That's why we are here. We were
[45:30] prophesied to be here. And he that
[45:33] Elijah shall turn the hearts of the
[45:35] children back to the faith of the
[45:36] fathers. The devil is in trouble tonight
[45:39] because the bride come back to the faith
[45:40] of the fathers. Regardless of what you
[45:42] feel have nothing to do with your
[45:43] feelings. It have to do with the faith
[45:45] of the fathers. And the faith of the
[45:47] fathers is God's own faith in the
[45:50] fathers. Oh give the Lord a shout in the
[45:52] house. Let me say it good. The faith of
[45:55] the fathers is God's faith in the
[45:58] fathers. That is the faith of the
[46:00] fathers. He is that faith and that faith
[46:03] is going to come inside of you. It's
[46:04] going to be manifested because works
[46:07] without faith is dead. Oh, give the Lord
[46:09] a shout. It's not a talking faith. It's
[46:12] a walking faith. It's a living faith.
[46:14] It's a manifesting faith. Is a faith
[46:16] that you believe
[46:18] &gt;&gt; and you are justified by that faith.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; What is that word bride?
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Like any wife is part of a husband.
[46:28] Therefore, we must be that word brine.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Now, listen to this description. He's
[46:33] not talking about this tabernacle and
[46:35] our fellowship. He's not talking about
[46:36] that.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; You have to be a word bride.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[46:42] &gt;&gt; And hear this. Now, watch. Good.
[46:45] Therefore, we must be that word bride.
[46:46] And what is that word bride? Question.
[46:49] Question. Where's the answer?
[46:51] &gt;&gt; The manifestation of this hour.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So when a man talk about he
[46:58] tabernacle and this tabernacle like if
[46:59] you see a one kind of believer he's a
[47:00] liar
[47:03] &gt;&gt; the churches have three kinds
[47:04] &gt;&gt; good bad indifferent ugly whatever
[47:08] &gt;&gt; you understand
[47:10] &gt;&gt; nobody could say this is the Holy Ghost
[47:12] tabernacle
[47:13] &gt;&gt; he said the Holy Ghost could be preached
[47:15] in it
[47:16] &gt;&gt; but this is a tabernacle people come in
[47:18] fellowship in
[47:18] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is poured out on
[47:20] individuals. Now when you see that I
[47:23] remember at the time I was young about
[47:25] 18 or so and I found a quote right
[47:27] bottom say one is a majority in God
[47:30] &gt;&gt; and I remember dropping on my knees and
[47:31] say Lord I'm a majority
[47:34] &gt;&gt; I got so excited I said I am a majority
[47:36] I don't need two just one
[47:38] &gt;&gt; is a majority in God
[47:39] &gt;&gt; I felt I had direct access as an
[47:41] individual to whatever God promised
[47:44] &gt;&gt; and that is what we have to come to that
[47:46] spot
[47:47] &gt;&gt; to recognize the devil is against us not
[47:49] your brother not your sister not your
[47:51] husband husband, not your wife, no
[47:52] enemy, but flesh and blood. The devil is
[47:54] against us. All hell is against us and
[47:56] we have to fight back. Not your brother,
[47:59] you're fighting, not your sister. You're
[48:00] fighting not to fight another church,
[48:02] but you are fighting that devil. He come
[48:04] to steal, to rob and to destroy. He come
[48:07] to wreck your faith. He come to
[48:09] frustrate you, depress you, upset you,
[48:11] and get you out of the spirit. But he
[48:13] come that you might have life, Jesus,
[48:15] that have it more abundantly. Oh glory
[48:17] to God, we come you tonight to get in
[48:18] the spirit. Oh, glory to God. You're
[48:20] fighting devils all week, but when you
[48:21] come here Wednesday night, you come for
[48:23] a sill. You come for a pause. You come
[48:25] to shaft mark your sword. You come to
[48:27] get your womb sponged. Oh God, your womb
[48:30] sponged. Give the Lord a shout. Pastor
[48:32] on your soul. Oh, glory to God. Med for
[48:35] your head, for your heart, for your
[48:37] mind. You're going to get a fresh touch
[48:39] from heaven. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[48:41] When they come on a Wednesday night,
[48:42] they come at the hospital, they get a
[48:44] blood transfusion. Oh, glory to God.
[48:46] Some plasma from the word of God to give
[48:48] you a spunk. They give you a spark. All
[48:51] your energy gone, but you come back to
[48:53] get some energy from the life of God,
[48:55] from the power of God, from the spirit
[48:58] of God. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[49:02] [Applause]
[49:04] There are some people like spiritual
[49:06] vampires. They suck you dry. You talk to
[49:08] them, they dry up. Praise God. They're
[49:10] like bllightes. You don't want to talk
[49:12] to them because they just drain you. You
[49:13] don't want that kind of thing. You want
[49:15] your cup to refill. Praise God. You want
[49:17] to get back some strength. Oh, glory to
[49:19] God. You know, somebody some vampire
[49:21] every time you come to me sucking you.
[49:22] Suck when you see them. So,
[49:24] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; You ever get a mosquito flying? Oh, God.
[49:28] And you're doing something. You're doing
[49:29] so. And they looking for blood. You
[49:31] know,
[49:32] &gt;&gt; that mosquito trying to They're not
[49:34] trying to get talk to your ears. It's
[49:36] blood they're looking for.
[49:40] I know.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; So what is the word bride?
[49:46] &gt;&gt; The manifestation of this hour.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; The bride not a creed.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Or a denomination but a living oracle of
[49:55] God.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; A living attribute of God displaying to
[50:00] the world the attributes of God in the
[50:04] formation of the bride that is to be
[50:06] expressed in this hour that we are now
[50:09] living. Amen.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; So this bride is not people sit down in
[50:12] church
[50:12] &gt;&gt; saying I am in the message because
[50:14] you're wearing a long dress and you have
[50:15] a tie.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; No this bride will be the word
[50:18] manifested.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; But when you hear that you have to
[50:21] believe you are going to become that.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; And God can't put a requirement in us
[50:25] that we can fulfill.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Every time God say that we have to come
[50:29] up to this standard it means he have to
[50:31] make a way for it.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; When God told Moses bring the people to
[50:35] this mountain he knew the Red Sea was
[50:36] going to be in front of them. That was
[50:38] nothing. Oops. Oh, shocks. I never I
[50:40] forget the focus. The Red Sea. But how
[50:43] we how we how we handling this? God
[50:45] never had that problem. How we handling
[50:46] this? His problem was was was with Moses
[50:49] because Moses was the one was
[50:50] complaining and come crying and sighing.
[50:53] Moses was the one that was in out the
[50:55] spirit. He said, "Why cry unto me?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; You supposed to speak
[50:59] &gt;&gt; and move forward because the spoken word
[51:02] &gt;&gt; is the original seed.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And to move forward, you have to speak.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. Give the Lord a shout.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Don't just say it in your head. You have
[51:10] to speak.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he spoke to the Red Sea.
[51:14] And the Red Sea have to open up because
[51:16] the word came out the mouth of God.
[51:19] Moses mouth was God's mouth. Oh, give
[51:21] the Lord a shout. And your mouth going
[51:24] to be God's mouth. And the word that
[51:26] come out your mouth shall not return
[51:28] void.
[51:31] Give the Lord a shout. Glory. You can't
[51:34] think it. You have to speak it. Oh, give
[51:36] the Lord a shout. I say you can't just
[51:38] think it. You have to speak it. Don't
[51:40] think you're going to be healed. Say
[51:41] you're going to be healed. Don't think
[51:43] you'll be delivered. Say, "I am going to
[51:45] be delivered." Let it come out your
[51:46] mouth.
[51:49] [Applause]
[51:49] [Music]
[51:53] [Applause]
[51:55] [Music]
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Those dead churches, they can't water
[52:00] the word in their mind.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; He say you water the word with the
[52:03] praises. I know years ago people sleep
[52:06] in the church and the preacher talking
[52:06] about the going on your subconscious. He
[52:09] preaching to people totally out of it.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; And he going ahead. He going ahead with
[52:15] the word.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; He bringing the word and he say going in
[52:18] the subconscious with the Bible for that
[52:21] &gt;&gt; with the scripture for that. The first
[52:23] parable Jesus give is the word is the
[52:25] seed
[52:26] &gt;&gt; that a ser went to sew.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Some fell on the way side.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Some fell here. Some fell there from
[52:31] there.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Then he explained
[52:34] Hallelujah.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Those that fell on the way side, the the
[52:36] crow come and take it. People hear it
[52:39] and enemy come and take it out their
[52:40] mind
[52:41] &gt;&gt; that they wouldn't be converted. They
[52:42] wouldn't jump in their heart.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; And next person hear it, they jump,
[52:45] jump, jump, jump, jump. They excited
[52:46] bad. Afterwards, they jumping out
[52:48] &gt;&gt; because of no roots.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; They have wayside.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Rocky
[52:56] &gt;&gt; and then have the Ties.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; They start to grow.

[53:40] for them.

[54:39] word. Come on now. Choke the cry to get
[54:41] in your spirit. Choke the passion to
[54:43] please God.
[54:47] [Music]
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Martin Luther could not express the
[54:50] attributes that we express because that
[54:52] was in the beginning the resurrection
[54:54] like the corner wheat. You see the whole
[54:56] program of the church is built upon
[54:58] divine revelation.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And the revelation of
[55:01] Jesus Christ in this hour not was what
[55:03] he was in another hour. What he was now
[55:06] the Bible expresses it is growing in the
[55:09] bride to the full stature.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; So he is saying this stature of the
[55:13] perfect man has to grow in a bride.
[55:15] [Music]
[55:20] Now when the when the mango push out
[55:23] flowers
[55:24] &gt;&gt; and the fruit start to come,
[55:26] &gt;&gt; the fruit is not matured yet.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; It's a young pick it yet.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; It's young. It's green. It's coming.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Afterwards it get mature. Afterward it
[55:34] have no more growth.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; It come to the peak of its growth.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Then the mango begin to turn color.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; It getting ripe. Because if the growth
[55:44] period is is finished,
[55:46] &gt;&gt; you can't grow no more.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; You have to ripen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; He said, I believe intellectually the
[55:52] church is hearing a message, but their
[55:54] faith isn't ripe enough.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; So the faith could grow,
[55:59] &gt;&gt; mature, and then get ripened.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; And he said to get ripen, you have to
[56:03] lay in presence.
[56:06] So presence have to be introduced to the
[56:09] church that you could rock back in that
[56:12] &gt;&gt; that you could live in that. It can't be
[56:14] you come to church like this is where
[56:16] the the the pipes is at and only when
[56:18] you come to church you access that. No,
[56:20] you have to access it every day.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; It is yours to access. The veil of the
[56:24] temple was rent from the top to the
[56:26] bottom to give you direct access rights.
[56:29] The devil can't access that. Hallelujah.
[56:32] Password wrong password. He don't have
[56:35] access denied. He can't access that. But
[56:38] you, little lady Jesus, you can access
[56:40] that tonight. Oh, give the Lord some
[56:42] praises.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; So, here it is. Therefore, the bride in
[56:46] the rapture will come forth and it is
[56:49] all pre-planned by God.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; It's all backed up. He know every man,
[56:53] every place who would set all about it.
[56:55] It's all pre-planned. God knew it would
[56:56] be here. He's going to be prepare a
[56:58] place for us. When we get there, it's
[56:59] all to be prepared. Just like even this
[57:01] night is prepared. This hour is
[57:04] prepared. His great forn knowledge tells
[57:06] him all these things. Here we go. He's
[57:08] he's omnipresent because he's omnisient.
[57:12] Omniscient means he knows all things.
[57:14] He's not in the bar by by the man who
[57:17] hit in his vat 19 and is wrong. He's not
[57:19] sitting down with any man there, but he
[57:20] knows what going inside of there. Isn't
[57:22] that right?
[57:22] &gt;&gt; He can just be like the wind over the
[57:25] earth.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; No. Oh, sorry. I I read that wrong. He
[57:29] can't be just like the wind
[57:31] &gt;&gt; over the earth
[57:32] &gt;&gt; because he's a being.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; He isn't a myth.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; He is a being.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; He dwells.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; He even dwells in a house.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; He dwells in a place called heaven.
[57:43] Therefore, by his omnipresent being
[57:46] omnisient, knows in all things, then he
[57:48] is omnipresent because he knows all
[57:50] things.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Here we go. Here I want to get to now.
[57:52] Now you grew from your birth. When you
[57:56] were born and presented into this world,
[57:59] God knew that you were going to be here
[58:01] on this earth
[58:03] &gt;&gt; and you growed from birth to maturity.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; And things that seem so strange to you
[58:10] in your young womanhood, young boyhood
[58:13] as children now seem very real.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; You couldn't understand it when you was
[58:19] a child. But now you become an adult.
[58:22] You begin to understand and find out
[58:25] that everything was just set just right.
[58:28] It is really means something to you now.
[58:32] So it is in your spiritual birth. You do
[58:35] things that you don't understand when
[58:36] you were a little baby. Come to the
[58:38] altar. You give your life to Christ. You
[58:40] do strange things. You wonder why you
[58:42] did it. But after a while, when you
[58:44] mature as matured Christians, then you
[58:48] understand it.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; There is something picks up. You see why
[58:52] you had to do it? Your spiritual birth.
[58:54] Your natural type bird type. You're
[58:57] spiritual.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; It is fitting in your life as you grew.
[59:00] Fitted right in because you were made
[59:02] for that. Wasn't it a strange thing the
[59:04] night you staggered into the mission
[59:05] tent meeting a church and there
[59:07] somewhere in the corner. See, God knew
[59:10] before the foundation of the world. It
[59:12] seems strange to you, but why you did it
[59:14] then? But now you understand. You know
[59:17] what happened.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; It is so fitting to your life. I don't
[59:20] believe that person just happened to be
[59:22] here by chance. Now just think when you
[59:24] come into this world everything have to
[59:25] be for prepared for you
[59:27] &gt;&gt; or pre-prepared rather. I don't hardly
[59:30] understand how we could think that God
[59:32] could prepare all these good things for
[59:34] us and he could not put trust and we
[59:36] could not put trust in him.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. That if he brought us
[59:40] into this chaos that we in now and
[59:42] prepare the good things of life for us,
[59:44] how much more we could trust him
[59:46] &gt;&gt; to prepare the things that is to come.
[59:48] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Come on, trust him. He was good for you
[59:53] when you're young.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; When you're old, he's still good.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; That's why David said, "Now that I'm
[59:58] old, forsake me not." Oh, give the Lord
[1:00:00] some praises.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; When you're young, you're strong. You
[1:00:05] have energy. As you get older, you don't
[1:00:07] have the energy. I was young.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; You think God don't understand that?
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go quickly now.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; So, here's the predestinated plan in
[1:00:16] plain view.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just as others seed,
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; the word of God is a seed
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; and must have the ground prepared
[1:00:24] beforehand.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; If you sow seed, just throw it out in
[1:00:27] the ground. It would do no good.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; The birds will pick it up. Jesus spoke a
[1:00:31] parable on that, right? So the ground
[1:00:33] had to be first.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; So God, here we go. You ready?
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; In sovereign grace
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; prepares the heart first. And he
[1:00:44] prepared you
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; to receive him in this age.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; He forneew you by his fornowledge
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; and ordained you to eternal life.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; He knew you.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Therefore he prepared you.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Now you understand the scripture. Who he
[1:01:03] forneew?
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; He called.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Who he called? He justified. Who he
[1:01:08] justified. He had already glorified. And
[1:01:11] if God be before us,
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; who can be against us? It is God that
[1:01:17] justify it. Let the dogs back this
[1:01:21] caravan moving on. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:01:24] shout. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:01:27] The dogs back in, but the chain moving
[1:01:29] on.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; It is God that justify it. Not man that
[1:01:35] justify it. Like the song said, you may
[1:01:37] remember. You remember all the things
[1:01:40] I've done, but Jesus with your special
[1:01:43] blood forgive me of everyone. He picked
[1:01:46] me up. He turned me around. Oh God, give
[1:01:49] me a brand new song. But Jesus dropped
[1:01:51] the charges. Now I'm free. Oh, glory to
[1:01:55] God. Hallelujah. He dropped the charges
[1:01:58] even though I was wrong. Oh, glory to
[1:02:00] God. He dropped the charges. Show me
[1:02:02] right from wrong. He dropped the
[1:02:05] charges. And at Calvary, case dismissed.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Case dismissed.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Case dismissed.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Bring up my case, but my case is
[1:02:14] dismissed.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; But Abraham said,
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; it go surprise people who are cross.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:02:33] It go surprise a lot of people here.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; I didn't know you was going to make it.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; So watch God in sovereign grace prepared
[1:02:42] the heart first.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; So he prepared you before the foundation
[1:02:46] of the world to receive him in this age.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; He forneew you by his fornowledge and
[1:02:52] ordain you to eternal life. He knew you.
[1:02:55] Therefore he prepared you.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; That's the reason you staggered out of
[1:02:59] these things and staggered into what you
[1:03:01] have now. It was God leading you to a
[1:03:05] place that he ordained for you.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; If this ground isn't prepared
[1:03:10] beforehand, hear the bomb, it can't
[1:03:13] grow.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; So maybe that is why we are so much a
[1:03:18] when you say shorties, so much has
[1:03:20] stunted Christians.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; People that they come and you recognize,
[1:03:24] well,
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; all they have is years on them. They're
[1:03:28] not growing.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Something kind of wrong. Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Watch.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; That's the reason the seed of faith
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; when you are preaching faith. I'll skip
[1:03:36] that. All right. All right. Let's get to
[1:03:38] the seed word now. Jesus is the word of
[1:03:40] God.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; And he was busted open that life.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; The life is inside the seed.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; So this spoken word
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; son,
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; second son,
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; He had the life inside of him.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; And God had to bust him open.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; So Calvary wasn't just he died for me.
[1:03:59] Calvary was about open up the seed.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; The seed son which is the son with the
[1:04:05] germ
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; to release life
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; which is the water
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; to the seed.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; God have to work with his word.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; The water have to come to water the
[1:04:15] seed.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; He know the seed is on the earth.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; The devil don't understand that because
[1:04:19] your forn knowledge is your gene germ
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; inside of you. Whether you're smoking,
[1:04:25] drinking, carrying in the world, it is
[1:04:27] something inside of you that he can say
[1:04:29] come, come, come. You can't explain it.
[1:04:32] That's why you stall out of what you're
[1:04:34] in into what you're in now because of
[1:04:37] what inside of you. But he had to bust
[1:04:39] open that seed word to release the life
[1:04:42] to hunt you. The spirit life have to go
[1:04:46] after you. Give the Lord a shout. You
[1:04:49] just come. The father had us to send a
[1:04:51] spirit. Seven spirits
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; throughout the whole earth
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; to find you and he has found you. Oh,
[1:04:58] that's a reason to shout tonight. That's
[1:05:01] a reason to praise God tonight.
[1:05:03] Hallelujah.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Let's put a B and present it here now
[1:05:06] for us.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; The life is inside the seed.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; This life which is spirit water flowing
[1:05:15] over the spirit over the seed of God
[1:05:18] will bring forth the life of the seed.
[1:05:21] Let every seed
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; bring forth
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; after its kind.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; You don't know what kind it is. Let
[1:05:28] every seed
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; bring forth
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; after its kind.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; We don't know what kind it is. But when
[1:05:34] the spirit fall, when the water fall and
[1:05:36] that sea begin to break out, it will
[1:05:38] reveal itself. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:05:41] shout. If that's the son of God, it will
[1:05:43] produce a son of God. If that's the seed
[1:05:46] of God, it will produce a reality of
[1:05:48] God. Oh, give the Lord a shout. In the
[1:05:50] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:05:52] with God and the word was God. In the
[1:05:55] beginning was the seed. Oh glory. And
[1:05:57] you are that seed now.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; See of prophecy.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 was a seed.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Behold Elijah.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Nobody knew that who that was. Nobody
[1:06:09] could say who that was. You had people
[1:06:11] who before brother man was playing
[1:06:12] Elijah. All kind of people were playing
[1:06:14] that. But when William Brandon came, he
[1:06:16] connected that word.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; That become his word. because he was
[1:06:20] that seed. And when the water fell on
[1:06:22] him, he knew he was that Elijah. He knew
[1:06:25] he was anointed and commissioned to get
[1:06:27] a people that going to turn the hearts
[1:06:29] back to the faith of the fathers. He
[1:06:30] knew he had to bring the entire message.
[1:06:32] So he had to connect with Revelation
[1:06:33] 10:7, 7th angel message. He had to
[1:06:36] connect with Luke 17:30 to reveal the
[1:06:38] son of man. He had to connect with a
[1:06:40] bride word. And Holy Spirit told him,
[1:06:42] "Pick up your pen and write. In the last
[1:06:44] days, the true bride will come to the
[1:06:47] headstone. She'll be a super race. All
[1:06:49] these are words from the mouth of God.
[1:06:52] She'll be a super race, a super church
[1:06:54] as she nears the headstone, not a weak
[1:06:57] church, not an intellectual church, not
[1:06:59] a dead set church. No, not that kind of
[1:07:01] church at all. But the original planting
[1:07:04] has been restored. The original planting
[1:07:06] was on the day of Pentecost. And if that
[1:07:09] original branch comes forth again, it
[1:07:11] will produce another book of acts. Not
[1:07:13] book of talk, book of acts, not a book
[1:07:15] of mysteries, book of acts. Oh, give the
[1:07:18] Lord a shout. The acts of the Holy
[1:07:20] Ghost. Oh, glory to God. I am looking
[1:07:22] for it. Looking for what? Another book
[1:07:24] of Acts. It has to be the acts of the
[1:07:26] Holy Ghost. No. No. Acts a man.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; I was telling I was telling my wife
[1:07:42] about churches and men who want to
[1:07:44] expose and expose and expose. They think
[1:07:46] they have the ministry of exposing
[1:07:47] affairs. But that whole exposing thing
[1:07:49] is already tell the people what they're
[1:07:51] not telling the people. There are people
[1:07:52] who preach and the people hearing what
[1:07:53] they're not saying. When you say this
[1:07:55] one false, this one falls, this one
[1:07:56] falls, this one falls, this one falls.
[1:07:57] What you actually saying is I am right.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; So the people comforting everybody else
[1:08:04] we alone.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Deceived.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Dumb and deceived.
[1:08:15] deceived.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; So we are not here and we see but God is
[1:08:19] not into craft.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; God is not crafty.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Bible talk about twisting the word and
[1:08:27] so on. God is wisdom
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; not craft.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; He don't say we had to say he don't go
[1:08:33] wrong and wrong and you have to you know
[1:08:35] you're getting this here and no he don't
[1:08:36] talk that kind of way.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; He said let there be light
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; and he separate light from the darkness
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; and he name it. He called the darkness
[1:08:43] day night and the day. He called it the
[1:08:45] light. He called it day.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; He just named it.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; He He named the bride revival too.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; He just said revival. Any revival? He
[1:08:57] says there no revival yet to wake up the
[1:08:59] bride. It will take them seven thunders.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; And I can't say that. I'm not supposed
[1:09:03] to say that. I didn't get permission to
[1:09:05] say that. Who are supposed to ask to say
[1:09:07] that? Which bishop I supposed to ask to
[1:09:09] say that? He will send it. He promised
[1:09:12] it. The seventh turn is to wake up the
[1:09:15] bride. Like Anthony say, not dead, but
[1:09:17] they're sleeping. He said the bride had
[1:09:19] not revival yet.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; You know what revival does? It set a
[1:09:22] charge in your
[1:09:25] [Applause]
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; All that blues are leaving.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; He said, sisters, can you wash the
[1:09:30] dishes?
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; A revival in tongue.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This
[1:09:38] message will need a revival.
[1:09:41] I ain't saying that to exclude us. We
[1:09:43] need a revival.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; The whole thing need a revival.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; It's 40 plus years. Chugalog. Chugalog.
[1:09:50] Chugalog. Chugalog.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; This war between Russia and Putin.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Russia. Look what Putin supposed to be
[1:10:04] some big bad thing and and and and
[1:10:06] Ukraine keep innovating.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Ukraine and Russia. sending all them
[1:10:11] drones and whatnot. The whole warfare,
[1:10:13] the whole thing about warfare different
[1:10:16] Ukraine don't have the the numbers of
[1:10:18] men to fight Russia.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; But they send in drones like story. No,
[1:10:21] the other day they had a robot
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; robot shooting gun
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; and and have a voice in robot saying
[1:10:26] surrender.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; I couldn't believe it. I said and we
[1:10:31] look at this here.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; A robot
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; shooting gun like man about surrender.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Give up.
[1:10:41] man surrendering to drone.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Somebody far away looking and and
[1:10:47] sending and sending miss
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; remote control from a distance.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; When Peter was in prison, some believers
[1:10:56] far away was praying for Peter.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Angel stepping.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Open up the door. Let the chains fall
[1:11:02] over Peter. Walk out.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; When Peter come by the door and knock,
[1:11:06] they said, "Nah, that can't be Peter.
[1:11:07] The angel
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; God answer prayer and they
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; they don't even want to open the door to
[1:11:13] the prayer that God answered.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Peter says me. Yes. All you have to eat.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Go jail food now right here.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm talking about church?
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; B said we haven't seen power yet.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; There's a power coming in the church and
[1:11:30] now it's coming in
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; where men will speak the word
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; and it will flash like lightning.
[1:11:38] see power yet.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's power yet. And we have to
[1:11:42] Hallelujah. We have to have a rehearsal.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; We can't just walk into power.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; You can't just walk into this thing. You
[1:11:50] have to have stage one, stage two, stage
[1:11:52] three. That's what the bear and the lion
[1:11:54] was about because Golth was coming.
[1:11:57] Golth was always coming. But who could
[1:12:00] deal with Goliath? Who could fight with
[1:12:02] Golth? A man had to handle the bear
[1:12:04] first, the lion after. And he was
[1:12:06] prepared and ready
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; beforehand.
[1:12:11] Hallelujah.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Do y'all shout in the house?
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; God didn't tell David David y with the
[1:12:17] land and rub gad come you. No. God
[1:12:19] didn't say that. Hallelujah.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; He just give him the test.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; He give him the experiences. If David
[1:12:25] the first bear David take up like a
[1:12:26] bullet and say sheep in you. David how
[1:12:29] you car looking like you're driving
[1:12:30] straight ahead.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; He can't face Golad. God had David part
[1:12:36] two,
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; David Junior, David assistant or
[1:12:39] something. So like that. So God knew
[1:12:41] what experience is yet down the road.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; So let me tell you plain. Stop
[1:12:46] complaining.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Quit griping.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Because you may see nothing yet.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Dreadful times still lay ahead.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; People hearing me tonight and they
[1:12:59] saying amen on that.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; I didn't say that. That's in the
[1:13:04] message.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Dreadful times lay ahead right now. We
[1:13:08] in the best times right now we could
[1:13:09] have
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Mr. Tariff tariffing all over the world.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; So what up with prices and and life and
[1:13:24] quality of life with Mr. tariff
[1:13:26] tariffing?
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; America in the greed. America with all
[1:13:30] the the debt and whatnot. But say they
[1:13:32] broke long time you know
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; they have no money you know
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; they living off of money to come you
[1:13:38] know
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; so anytime the whole thing could crash
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; and everybody going in the whole you
[1:13:46] know Brazil India Russia South America
[1:13:49] the bricks and everybody going into the
[1:13:51] alignment
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; because of what is to come
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; peace system is on its way
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; but not on its way it's here already
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; it's Is the pressure come to us yet?
[1:14:02] Because they have none the press for
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; y Bible. Everybody have Bible
[1:14:10] Bible.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; So that they not the press for Bible
[1:14:13] spoken word books on the earth years for
[1:14:16] 40 50 years. Does that not the issue?
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; The issue will be the manifested word.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; He said they're going to hate you
[1:14:23] because you are Joseph. The word he can
[1:14:26] work through rejected.
[1:14:30] If you think the manifested word will be
[1:14:32] loved in this message, you are dead
[1:14:33] wrong.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; After all that hatred and jealousy, the
[1:14:37] fighting the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:14:39] through them seven seas and seven
[1:14:41] thunders. When that word become
[1:14:42] manifested, you think they will tell the
[1:14:44] believers, "Oh, glory to God.
[1:14:45] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus." Not a bit
[1:14:47] of it at all.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; When that word became manifested and the
[1:14:51] showdown came,
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; they say, "We have Judas here."
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Not Judas. Um, Barabas.
[1:14:59] Which one you want? Somebody say, "Give
[1:15:01] us
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Barabus."
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; He wasn't the messenger, you know.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the messenger, you know.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; What shall we do with Jesus
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; called the Christ? Crucify him.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Let me sting you a little bit. You may
[1:15:20] be seated. So the bride
[1:15:23] which will be the word manifested
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; would be rejected first in this message.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Then the government will come down.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; The bride
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; which will be
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; not this tabernacle.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; We not talking about this church.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about that. This bride
[1:15:43] is universal.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; This bride is around the world. Nobody
[1:15:47] have the bride hold the bride and only
[1:15:48] the bride here. That is foolishness.
[1:15:50] This bride is belong to the body of
[1:15:52] Christ. And by one spirit you get inside
[1:15:54] that body. When you're in that body,
[1:15:56] nobody can put you out. Nobody can put
[1:15:58] you in and they can't take you out. This
[1:16:00] bride baptized by the Holy Ghost into
[1:16:03] the body of Christ. Manifesting the word
[1:16:06] for the hour will be rejected.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Upon that rejection, judgment comes.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; But the bride will have the power
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; to face it in that hour. Oh, give the
[1:16:19] Lord some praises.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The government couldn't
[1:16:24] come down unless they rejected Jesus.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Who rejected him? The priest
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; dare. Who there? The most holy people
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; in the most holy place rejected the
[1:16:34] Christ.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; What shall I do with Jesus called the
[1:16:36] Christ? What shall I do with them seven
[1:16:38] thunders
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; living in the people?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; What did the prophet said? What we see
[1:16:44] should make a church that people
[1:16:46] refining and say the seven thunders is
[1:16:50] being manifested. Oh give the Lord a
[1:16:52] shout not explain nor talk manifested
[1:16:57] [Applause]
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; two things.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; What the thunders is and what the
[1:17:03] thunders does.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Seven thunder revelation.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Seven thunder manifestation. He say if
[1:17:10] that be so then the seven thunders cap
[1:17:12] the pyramid.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; So he put the seven thunders in the holy
[1:17:17] spirit slot
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; which is the spirit of Christ coming
[1:17:20] into the church to manifest them
[1:17:22] virtues.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Oh give the lord a shout manifest those
[1:17:26] virtues and Satan
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; have to know it's there.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; He said you you don't have to show off
[1:17:32] like that. He all them thing have to be
[1:17:34] tested in you. Tested what? What? faith,
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; virtue,
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; knowledge,
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; temperance,
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; patience.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Man blowing the top without a test.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; It's just the plain old trinity temper.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Man, man acting rowdy without even a
[1:17:50] test coming. Daddy test. Your wife is
[1:17:52] your test. What is your test?
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; The church is a test. The passing the
[1:17:55] test. Elder is a test.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Sickness is a test.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; You want to cuss because you're sick.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; The test already come yet.
[1:18:07] Because the faith of God was in Job.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; God could call out God could call out to
[1:18:12] Satan
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; and say, "Have you considered my servant
[1:18:14] Job?"
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; So So Satan start to explain, "Well, the
[1:18:18] way I see him, I see him like a hedge
[1:18:20] around him.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; You're a special protection around that
[1:18:22] man. So why you ain't going nearby
[1:18:23] there? I ain't touching because you have
[1:18:25] a big hedge."
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; God says, "No, that no no no, not so
[1:18:28] what you seeing."
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; So Satan, he ask me a crack now. He's
[1:18:33] not backing down yet.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; He know God have a hedge around him.
[1:18:36] He's seeing protection. He's seeing
[1:18:37] blessings. But Satan backing down. Give
[1:18:39] him a crack. Said take a crack, but
[1:18:41] don't touch his life. Protection. He's
[1:18:43] seeing blessings.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Take a crack, but don't touch his life.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; And he hit Job where it hurts the most.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Hit his children, hit his flocks, hit
[1:18:54] his family. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him.
[1:18:56] Hit him
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; until he hit his health.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when your health get hit a big
[1:19:02] hit

[1:19:04] you know
[1:19:06] your swimming pool come you know

[1:19:43] I buy fish and stove. You know, you know
[1:19:46] talking.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't go down that road.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Why are you going down that road? and
[1:19:53] you even had job test and you open your
[1:19:54] mouth and saying all kind
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; keep quiet.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Try to catch what God want to reveal to
[1:20:03] you.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Keep quiet.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Hush a little bit. Stop being so
[1:20:08] talkative. Just hold your peace.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; And that man with virtue.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; So you speak like a foolish woman.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; He only could say that because he had
[1:20:18] virtue. Yes,
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; he had something in him that brought it
[1:20:21] out with kindness.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; There are many when he test come you
[1:20:24] under pressure. Charity is kind not
[1:20:27] itself is not puffed up. It's not easily
[1:20:30] provoked. It think no evil. It rejoices
[1:20:33] not iniquity but rejoices in the truth.
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; That's a character.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; That's a lie. That's not a text to
[1:20:42] preach on.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; That is what shakes the devil. Amen.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; That's the thunder that shakes the
[1:20:51] devil.

[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Let me see wrap up here. I don't know
[1:20:58] how to wrap up here.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; But if the spirit of God comes forth to
[1:21:05] water the seed, if it is the seed it is
[1:21:09] watering, it will produce the life of
[1:21:11] the seed. It will produce the life of
[1:21:13] the seed because that is what it is
[1:21:15] given for. Amen.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; So the water release is the water for

[1:21:28] big engine the bride have in it and
[1:21:29] trying to start. It can't tumble.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; You might get the horn make a peep but
[1:21:33] that car turn no engine.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; You need the right kind of battery for
[1:21:36] that.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; You need the right kind of life for
[1:21:38] that.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; When you put that so the whole thing
[1:21:41] rumble
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; and the devil know you're on your way.
[1:21:44] That's why I say leave you with smoke in
[1:21:46] the devil face.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You don't want
[1:21:51] to be standing by your car. Oh, God. You
[1:21:53] see the rims, you see the You see the
[1:21:55] color, you see the paint, you see the
[1:21:57] texture, you see how it blending and
[1:21:58] whatnot, but the car can start.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; A tricycle passing you
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; and you have a nice long car that cannot
[1:22:04] start
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; because you full of mechanics and
[1:22:07] torque.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; But somebody pass you with mechanic and
[1:22:10] dynamic the foot moving so on the wheel.
[1:22:13] a bicycle.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; But this bride will have mechanics
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; and dynamics, word and spirit,
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; power and demonstration. Oh, I will
[1:22:23] never stop preaching this who vexed
[1:22:25] loss.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Who upset that is the
[1:22:28] business? But this is what Peter had.
[1:22:31] And we ought to get nothing less than
[1:22:33] that because seed in Pentecost was the
[1:22:35] original planting. That was the original
[1:22:38] seed. They give the Lord a shout. Jesus
[1:22:42] tell them you shall receive power not
[1:22:45] revelations power
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost come upon you.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; All the revelations and mysteries he
[1:22:56] opened their understanding. He opened
[1:22:58] the word to them. They had revelation.
[1:23:00] They had mysteries. They had
[1:23:02] understanding open to them. But what
[1:23:04] they need was power. Power is the water.
[1:23:07] Power is the spirit. Power is the
[1:23:09] anointing. Power is what breaks the
[1:23:11] yoke. Jesus himself said, "The spirit is
[1:23:14] upon me because he has anointed me." He
[1:23:17] couldn't say it if it wasn't so. He said
[1:23:19] it because it was real. He said it
[1:23:21] because it was present tense. He said
[1:23:23] this day the scripture is fulfilled.
[1:23:27] [Applause]
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; The Bible descript Jesus described Jesus
[1:23:32] and a man that God anointed with power.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:41] John the Baptist
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; didn't have any power
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; because his purpose was to introduce
[1:23:46] Messiah.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Repent.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Just words coming out of his mouth.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; And convictions hit in the heart. And
[1:23:55] when he se
[1:23:59] you know
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; you go here dry say come wet one.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Don't just come in water fruit
[1:24:06] here.
[1:24:09] I don't come to church again. Go.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; That was John the Baptist.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; And he was so anointed on the mechanics
[1:24:20] of preparing away for Messiah that the
[1:24:23] scribe and Pharisee are you the one?
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Or should we look for another?
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Who tell them to tell John that
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; now? If another man hear that, you know
[1:24:34] who I am.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Not Jonah. No sir. Just say me, you have
[1:24:39] to be kidding.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; The one coming after me.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not even waiting to open. I I can't
[1:24:44] even look like his shoes.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; That one that coming,
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; he going to baptize. He said, "I baptize
[1:24:50] with water."
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; But that one is fire, man.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Fire.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; There's not an apostle coming, not a
[1:24:57] prophet coming. That is the Lord himself
[1:24:59] coming. Give the Lord a shout. That's
[1:25:01] the Lord himself. and he
[1:25:05] will baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:09] The same Holy Ghost they reject in the
[1:25:10] message. The same Holy Ghost they don't
[1:25:12] want in the message.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; The same Holy Ghost Esau despised
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; that that Holy Ghost
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; power
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; I supposed to expect it?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; If I don't preach it how you expect it.
[1:25:32] If I tell you why I dream last night, I
[1:25:33] didn't dream last night by the way, so I
[1:25:34] can't tell you that one.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; But if I tell you why I dreamed last
[1:25:37] night,
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; what you expect?
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Nice thoughts.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; I dream a flowery bed. I dream adoption
[1:25:43] and I was up in the air. No, I ain't
[1:25:46] dream that. I just see nothing.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; What you do with that? The pastor dream
[1:25:51] is up in the air. We have a good pastor.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Are you crazy?
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; That's the word.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Yeah.
[1:26:00] Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what somebody dream
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; or what somebody thinks.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; The spoken word
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; is the original seed.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; And for the word to be manifest, it have
[1:26:10] to come to seed.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Seed is spoken.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Seed is expressed.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; My daughter is going to be delivered.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; My son is going to be delivered.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Where we have to speak it. We are going
[1:26:24] to have a revival. You are going to be
[1:26:27] delivered from your fears, from your
[1:26:29] past, from your history.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:35] Lord, help me.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Wishes were Sunday, but it's a Wednesday
[1:26:38] night.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; All right. Where am I at Brown?
[1:26:44] Jesus, he was the seed that Eve should
[1:26:47] have produced.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Do you get it?
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; But she hybrid by disbelieving God's
[1:26:54] word. So he was that seed and the only
[1:26:58] way life could be in the reproduction of
[1:27:01] life, life had to come through that seed
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; and that seed had to die. Here we go.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; In order to spread out the life.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; That is why the water was given.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; The water is to water the seed.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit that was in the garden
[1:27:21] of Eden
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; was to water the seed.
[1:27:25] Man wasn't made to die. He was made to
[1:27:28] live.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; But high breathing brought death.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; But God had a germ of life.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; That germ of life come from the real
[1:27:38] seed
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; and God proved it was his seed because
[1:27:42] he rose him up again.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; So Jesus said, "Destroy this body
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; and in three days
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; I will raise it up
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; myself."
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Because he know that teeth have power in
[1:27:53] it.
[1:27:55] They have power. Resurrection power
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; set on a timer. It looked like he was
[1:27:59] dead, brother Anthony. But he was not
[1:28:01] dead.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; When they thought he was dead, he was
[1:28:03] not dead. He was active and alive. He
[1:28:06] went down to the halls of hell and went
[1:28:09] and opened the door. And when they were
[1:28:11] toasting their champagne that he is dead
[1:28:13] on the cross, he knocked on the door and
[1:28:15] they said, "It cannot be anybody else
[1:28:17] because everybody is here." And they saw
[1:28:19] the mighty conqueror. And he took the
[1:28:21] keys of death and hell from Satan as
[1:28:23] have cut the keys. They couldn't believe
[1:28:25] it was Jesus, but it was Jesus. And he
[1:28:28] rose from the dead. And he's alive
[1:28:30] tonight to confirm his word. He's alive
[1:28:33] tonight to vindicate his word. He's
[1:28:35] alive tonight to prove he's the same
[1:28:37] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Watch. He prove he was seed. He rose him
[1:28:50] up again.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; That through that life that was going
[1:28:53] over the original seed like it was given
[1:28:55] to Eve or his real church is bringing
[1:28:57] forth life again
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; through the birth
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; through the womb of his bride.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; So the bride now becomes a womb
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; to bring forth children.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; He say it is rich. It is glorious.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; He said he was that seed that was
[1:29:13] produced by the word that say be it done
[1:29:16] unto me
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; according to thy word. That is the seed.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus, here we go, is the word made
[1:29:24] manifest.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; So the word made manifest is Jesus.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; St. John 1:1,
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; in the beginning was the word with God
[1:29:31] was God and the word became flesh.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; It is still God.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; It's the word manifested.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And that makes the Messiah.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:29:42] That's the reason that God manifested
[1:29:45] himself so perfectly in Jesus because he
[1:29:47] was the seed word,
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; the germ word,
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; look, look how specific the words are.
[1:29:54] He's speaking the germ that was inside
[1:29:58] the seed that the life in the seed. Do
[1:30:01] you get it? He talking about Christ was
[1:30:03] the germ word of God.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; He's going deeper. The germ is the
[1:30:08] spirit.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; He's going deeper. The germ is the
[1:30:12] water.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Fight that.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Let them fight that. Brother Clarence,
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; the germ is the spirit.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; The germ is the water.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Which one you want?
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; The words that I speak unto you.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said they are spirit.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; And they are life. So the word spoken
[1:30:32] word
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; coming out the mouth of God.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; He said he that believeth on me as the
[1:30:39] scripture had said
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; out of his belly
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; shall flow
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; rivers of living water.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; This spake he
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; of the spirit
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; that was not yet released
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; because Jesus didn't die yet. He was
[1:30:53] prophesying that something going to
[1:30:55] break inside of you
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; and you going to have it abundantly
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; more abundantly.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; It going to flow.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; That river going to flow.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; You are going to be like that man in
[1:31:06] Psalms one
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; planted by the waters.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Are you ready now?
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; had to be broken open
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; in order for that seed to let forth its
[1:31:20] life.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to water other seed that was
[1:31:24] coming.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Did you get it now?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; So his life was busted open
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; to release a spirit
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; because other seeds is coming
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; and other seeds need that water
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; or that spirit
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; to come aliveise.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Now God have to find you know
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; in the dirt.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Watch here. Watch. They are going to get
[1:31:50] that word. That's and stay right with
[1:31:51] it. I'm sending forth the spirit to
[1:31:53] water it. It will produce miracles. It
[1:31:56] will produce the power of God. And
[1:31:58] that's why it'll be very comic, not
[1:32:00] really comical. When every time you talk
[1:32:02] about power and whatnot, people have a
[1:32:04] problem with that.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; They don't like to talk about power,
[1:32:07] miracles, speaking in tongues, they go
[1:32:08] so Pentecostal,
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; like that Pentecostal church, that
[1:32:11] Pentecostal group.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Well, here
[1:32:17] watch. God is taking you now to reveal
[1:32:21] himself again
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; through his church.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; The resurrected body of the Lord Jesus
[1:32:27] Christ. Resurrected out of churchianity.
[1:32:30] Resurrected out of cold formal churches.
[1:32:33] Resurrected out of fanaticism. God is
[1:32:36] bringing forth a bunch of bones and
[1:32:38] putting skin on it in the power of the
[1:32:41] Holy Ghost that will bring the gospel in
[1:32:43] this last day with signs and wonders to
[1:32:46] the end of the world. They will teach
[1:32:49] the Bible. They will stand by it. They
[1:32:53] will live by it. They will not
[1:32:55] compromise right or left. They will
[1:32:58] stand right on the word and move on. And
[1:33:01] God will be with them daily
[1:33:04] confirming the word with signs and
[1:33:07] wonders following. Or could we hear a
[1:33:10] shout in the house?
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; That is the prophecy hanging over you.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will be with them daily
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; confirming the word with signs
[1:33:20] following. All right.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Cast up now in the middle.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; The plane about to take off now.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Now Eve,
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Received the wrong seed word.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Listen
[1:33:32] close.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what Satan tried. She
[1:33:38] shook him away. Mary shook him away. Um
[1:33:40] Mary said the and the holy the angel
[1:33:42] told Mary the Holy Ghost shall
[1:33:44] overshadow you. It's the word of God.
[1:33:46] She said be it unto me
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; right up in Judea. Mary. So so Eve get
[1:33:52] and receive a wrong seed word.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; I know it produce a life.
[1:34:00] So it's not only God's seed that's
[1:34:02] produce life, you know.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Wrong seeds produce
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; alive.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Wrong seek to produce angry church
[1:34:10] members,
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; heady, high-minded, arrogant, looking
[1:34:14] for fight.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Really untrue. Looking for a nice K in
[1:34:17] spirit.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Looking for wrestler. Instead of winning
[1:34:23] souls, they're looking to fight brethren
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; who not looking so fightish,
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; looking humble, looking like you. All
[1:34:30] right.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; So when that word hit Mary, Mary went
[1:34:35] straight, you know, I'm going to have a
[1:34:36] baby. Hear your difference. Now this is
[1:34:37] seed hit Mary, right?
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Before she felt anything because the
[1:34:41] word was already set there.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; She didn't have to go through the prayer
[1:34:45] line a second time.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; She believed it. She didn't have any
[1:34:49] sign of life. She never had no sign of
[1:34:51] pregnancy. She felt nothing.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; That is I like this one here. Punch this
[1:34:58] for the feelers inside of here. We're
[1:34:59] not talking about here tonight have
[1:35:00] feelings inside tonight. But about the
[1:35:01] whole church then only want to feel
[1:35:03] something because she heard a word. She
[1:35:06] took it.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Had to feel nothing.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Feeling God with me now. I want you feel
[1:35:11] nothing. God not with me. See that can't
[1:35:14] work.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Devil will play you like a fiddle.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Devil will play your feeling like a
[1:35:18] fiddle. Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; But when you could take God at his word,
[1:35:22] devil have nothing to play. You know,
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; all you devil, God said so. God said so.
[1:35:26] It is written. It is written. It is also
[1:35:28] written. God said so. Devil can't stop
[1:35:31] you. Then he know if you're going or
[1:35:33] coming. He know if you're sick or you're
[1:35:35] not sick. He know if you're up or down.
[1:35:37] You're depressed. You're frustrated. The
[1:35:38] devil doesn't know because all your
[1:35:40] confession is what God have said.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; She felt nothing. Listen to this now.
[1:35:48] When you realize
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; that God has revealed to you the truth
[1:35:52] of the thing,
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; there is nothing in the world is going
[1:35:56] to defeat you in it.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; You are absolutely undefeable.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Not you, but God in you.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Oh people, God bless you. Hear me.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; But say, hear me.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; I can't believe nothing but God's word.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; I want it to be my life.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Everything that I am, I want you to do
[1:36:14] the same. Let your walks, your talks,
[1:36:17] your moves, everything to be in the word
[1:36:18] of God. Let the mind of Christ come into
[1:36:21] you and that will pregnant you
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; with the word.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; If you let the mind of the denomination
[1:36:29] come in, you'll be denominationally
[1:36:30] pregnantated.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; So you see what happened to the groups
[1:36:33] now.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; If they're not preaching the word,
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; they get their own baby
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; from the pastor.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; You know who the father that child is?
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] If you let the mind of Christ come into
[1:36:46] you, he can't deny his own word.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; This is what I want to get to now.
[1:36:51] Christ
[1:36:53] is now taking himself a bride
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; to be pregnantated with his own seed
[1:36:59] word
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; in her womb,
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; the spirit womb in her mind.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; That won't mix with any national trash
[1:37:08] with it.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Could you take some more? Yes,
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; God knowing in this last day
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; there will come a intellectual giants
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; that will come everything intellectual
[1:37:21] all kind of enemy with reasoning powers
[1:37:24] to try to prove to the church that the
[1:37:26] days of miracle is passed
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; God packed in the baptism of the Holy
[1:37:30] Ghost
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; with what speaking in tongues
[1:37:33] interpretation
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; prophecies all kind of things that may
[1:37:37] seem hard in training but brother on the
[1:37:40] battlefront everyone One of them think
[1:37:42] got to be used.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Who said that?
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Every one of them got to be used
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; God equips his soldiers on what take it
[1:37:55] takes what to use.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; You stay there till God equips you with
[1:38:01] the baptism of the spirit.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Then everything you got need of in this
[1:38:06] world or the world to come lives right
[1:38:08] in you. Hallelujah.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; The all- wise God knowing how to equip
[1:38:12] his army. He equipped it with the
[1:38:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; He knew, here we go. When people would
[1:38:19] reason
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; would go to reading this word when it
[1:38:22] come out here,
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; what would happen?
[1:38:28] So Lucifer, old Lucy,
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; he was waiting for it to come into book
[1:38:32] form
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; and print form
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; where people could study it
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; and reason with it.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; And today we find people saying, "Where
[1:38:41] where's the God of history? Where is the
[1:38:42] God across the Red Sea? Where's the God
[1:38:44] that heal the sick?" And they try to go
[1:38:45] back. What good does it do to give your
[1:38:47] Canary bird vitamins and make him strong
[1:38:49] winds and keep him in a cage? You are
[1:38:52] penned up in some little thing down
[1:38:53] there. It's a lie. Christ is the same
[1:38:56] yesterday and forever. God know. Here we
[1:38:58] go. It will take the baptism of the Holy
[1:39:01] Ghost
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; to prove his latter day signs.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Now you see, here we go.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Almost done.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; No, I shouldn't say that on page 74 14
[1:39:16] pages. We were supposed to get through
[1:39:17] quickly tonight, but this is now you
[1:39:19] see. Here we go.
[1:39:21] That's the seed word cannot grow in the
[1:39:25] atmosphere of knowledge.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; So all them who sitting down with the
[1:39:32] itching ears looking for more teachers
[1:39:34] to come to hit them a four hours and a
[1:39:36] five hours and a six hour sermon
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; of information. The word can't grow
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; in the atmosphere of
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; knowledge. Faith only grows in one
[1:39:46] vitamin.
[1:39:48] Faith only grows in one vitamin. That's
[1:39:50] the word. The only thing that faith can
[1:39:52] grow in is the word. And the only way it
[1:39:55] can grow is because it believes the
[1:39:57] word. It has to take all the word and
[1:39:58] believe it. Faith vitamin is spelled in
[1:40:02] little four-letter word L I F E. Life.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Vitamin L.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Life.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Wisdom has vitamin P.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; R pleasure and reason. That's wisdom.
[1:40:18] pleasure and reason.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; But faith only have one thing, life.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Thy word is life.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Thy word is truth.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; So the seed word of life can't grow in
[1:40:29] the kind of atmosphere of wisdom.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Almost. Yeah. Oh god, skip down. The
[1:40:35] life that come out of the original seed.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Oh god. Here we go.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Come through different processes
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; and turn back to its original condition.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; So Luther, Wesley, Pentecost was just
[1:40:45] part of the processes. But when it come
[1:40:47] to the top, Luther, Wesley, Pentecost,
[1:40:51] top, it come back to the original, alpha
[1:40:54] and omega.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Paul and brother Brandham and then the
[1:40:58] bride.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. So God set up
[1:41:01] Paul as the original messenger. Set up
[1:41:03] brother Brham as the end time messenger
[1:41:05] and set the bride behind that. With Paul
[1:41:07] had the early church, the bride and with
[1:41:09] brother Brandham have the last day
[1:41:11] church the bride. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:41:13] shout in the house. which will be
[1:41:15] original word which will be original
[1:41:18] seed. That is why the prophecy say what
[1:41:20] the tape say because it's not me saying
[1:41:22] it. It's he that is saying it. Oh give
[1:41:25] the Lord a shout.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; The secret is what the word is in the
[1:41:28] bride. How did the word get inside of
[1:41:30] you? Because it's promise after promise
[1:41:32] after promise. What did Peter said? By
[1:41:34] these promises you become a partaker of
[1:41:37] his divine nature.
[1:41:39] All right let's go.
[1:41:42] The life that was in the stalk went one
[1:41:43] went to make another. Justification made
[1:41:45] a way for sanctification. Sanctification
[1:41:47] made a way for the bapt Holy Ghost. And
[1:41:49] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way
[1:41:51] for the Holy Ghost itself to come down
[1:41:53] in perfection. When they organized the
[1:41:56] life move right out of it,
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; the life is traveling on.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; So churches have testimonies. People
[1:42:01] have testimonies of the life of what God
[1:42:03] did for them and what God for them years
[1:42:05] ago and what not. But if you're
[1:42:06] organized, life move on.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; And all you have is a history
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; of a testimony.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The life leaves the stalk to make
[1:42:15] the tassel.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Leaves
[1:42:18] from the tassel. It makes the husk. From
[1:42:21] the husk, it goes into the original
[1:42:23] grain. Notice never again to be useful
[1:42:25] to him.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Because the processes dries up.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; And the seed stands original.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; What's that seed? Original seed.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; What's that seed? The spoken word.
[1:42:35] Hallelujah.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; It comes back to that
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; the original seed went down through
[1:42:39] processes seven church ages come back up
[1:42:42] again
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; as original seed
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; to be you
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; the bride.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we can't be less than the
[1:42:49] original.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; We cannot be less than the word
[1:42:53] manifested.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; That is our gene,
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; our gym. That's our seed.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Notice the seed is coming up.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; The life is coming up. It is not going
[1:43:04] back. and hear the bum. And when the
[1:43:07] seed word begins to grow, music come,
[1:43:10] please. When the seed word begins to
[1:43:12] grow, the husk put it from itself.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; That's rejection right there.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; The husk in the message that can't take
[1:43:18] you no more.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; The life leave all the others
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; to follow it.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; That's the true believers.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; What the true? They follow the life
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; wherever the life goes.
[1:43:32] What happened to the church once carrier
[1:43:34] is alive? The spirit passed through.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; No more useful to God.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; The spirit passed through her. It's
[1:43:40] true. But she will not be air with the
[1:43:43] vindicated seed word.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; She will not be in the rapture. She'll
[1:43:47] be a church member come up in the second
[1:43:49] resurrection. Ah, praise God.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Like you woman claiming you
[1:43:55] got the Holy Ghost out here wearing
[1:43:56] shorts and things. You see, he's not a
[1:43:58] filthy spirit. He's a Holy Spirit. And
[1:44:00] when you become subject to that spirit,
[1:44:02] it throws your whole being subject to
[1:44:05] that spirit. I'm about to close.
[1:44:06] Skipping here. And that spirit,
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; are you ready?
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Is nothing in the world but the seed
[1:44:13] word made manifest.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; So this kingdom of God,
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; the spirit is the seed word in you
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; made manifest,
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; quickened alive or made alive.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my. This body is subject to the
[1:44:29] spirit. Have not yet entered into the
[1:44:31] word form.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; We are still in flesh form
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; but subject to the word.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to close. He that heareth
[1:44:38] you heareth me. He that despiseth you
[1:44:41] despiseth me.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; He that despiseth me despiseth him that
[1:44:44] sent me. That proves he speaks his
[1:44:47] message through his servants. Now the
[1:44:49] power of the believing church. Christ
[1:44:51] has all power in heaven. Do you believe
[1:44:53] that? What if he's in you? Has Christ
[1:44:55] got all power? He is the seedword in his
[1:45:00] body. He in us become the seedword in
[1:45:04] us.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Now watch the law of reproduction.
[1:45:08] Everything after its kind.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; And then he said these words here. Now
[1:45:11] the seed of Christ must m u s t must
[1:45:16] come through his body.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Not through a denomination but through a
[1:45:22] bornagain.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Seed of the word. We coming back to
[1:45:24] this. Amen.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Seed is through the body.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; How does my seed come? Through the body.
[1:45:30] How does apple seed seed come? Through
[1:45:32] the body.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; And the church is the body of Christ.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Now watch. He said now watch this. Now
[1:45:38] watch the seed church here. Now he's
[1:45:40] given example with the true sperm. The
[1:45:44] Enoch unoch remember God never committed
[1:45:46] his preaching to an angel. He said God
[1:45:50] came down below angels and committed to
[1:45:52] man. Although an angel directed
[1:45:54] Philillip to him, but the germ of life
[1:45:56] had to come from the body.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Philillip.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Brother, are we on the line now?
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Where did the germ come from? Through
[1:46:03] the angel.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; No, the angel show him where to go. An
[1:46:08] angel is a messenger. Here is a son.
[1:46:11] Philip had the germ, the message, the
[1:46:14] word.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; You see what he bring?
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; This is the message here. Now,
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; this is what we have to get to. Philip
[1:46:21] had the message,
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; the word,
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; the germ. That is how a child can be
[1:46:27] born.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Philip laid his hands upon him. Philip
[1:46:30] baptized him in Jesus Christ and there
[1:46:33] come the spirit of God. Now the gym had
[1:46:35] to come from the body. What body?
[1:46:37] Christ's body
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; and Philip was a member of that body.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; And then he went on about Cornelius
[1:46:43] while Peter speak these word and I'll
[1:46:44] close with this last quote here.
[1:46:47] Two more. All done.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; What is the transformation? How do we
[1:46:53] get it? What does the transformation?
[1:46:55] God does it by the spirit of his word.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; He plants his seed
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; and throws his spirit on it
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; and it brings forth the product.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; His holy spirit transform the seed word
[1:47:09] to be vindicated of its kind.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit transformed the seeds
[1:47:13] that's on the inside of it. No matter
[1:47:15] what kind of seed it is, it will
[1:47:17] transform it.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; If it's evil, it will bring forth evil.
[1:47:20] If it's hypocrite, it bring forth
[1:47:21] hypocrite. If it's genuine word of God,
[1:47:23] it will bring forth genuine sons of God.
[1:47:25] And this is the final quote.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; We are waiting for that something that's
[1:47:29] going to take the faith.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; And restore the faith of the children
[1:47:33] back to the fathers.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; He said, I'll restore again in last
[1:47:37] days. It will be restored. God shall
[1:47:41] send the Holy Ghost in such a way upon
[1:47:45] planted word
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; and that will restore.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; The word of God is a seed that a soul
[1:47:51] went for. So let's all stand and praise
[1:47:52] God. Father God, we thank you tonight.
[1:47:54] We praise you tonight. We thank you for
[1:47:55] your spirit. We thank you for your
[1:47:57] presence and power. Have the
[1:47:58] preeminences, Lord. Have the oversight.
[1:48:00] And may your people give it revelation
[1:48:02] inspiration knowing that the spoken word
[1:48:04] is original seed and you have sent forth
[1:48:07] your spirit to throw that rain that
[1:48:09] water upon that seed to make it
[1:48:11] manifest. I commit them into your hands
[1:48:13] in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. God bless
[1:48:14] you. Thanks again for being here.
[1:48:19] [Music]
[1:48:23] [Applause]
[1:48:26] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:48:30] I love the Lord tonight.

[1:56:30] Lord. The enemy is raging. He come to
[1:56:32] steal, to rub, to destroy, to bring
[1:56:34] frustration, depression, and everything
[1:56:35] else. But Lord, we ask for a complete
[1:56:38] and total deliverance for the life of
[1:56:39] this child in the name of Jesus. And for
[1:56:41] Johnson Pope with his high blood
[1:56:43] pressure and for salvation of his soul
[1:56:44] from brother Popwell, Father, we pray
[1:56:46] that your Holy Spirit would minister and
[1:56:48] meet the need of this person. Father
[1:56:50] God, may the pressure come back normal
[1:56:52] and we come to the saving knowledge of
[1:56:54] Jesus Christ. And anybody here needing a
[1:56:55] special touch from you, may they be
[1:56:57] refreshed by your presence as they go to
[1:56:59] their homes and different places. Be
[1:57:01] them in a special way. I ask in Jesus
[1:57:03] name. Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:57:05] Amen.
