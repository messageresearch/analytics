[17:19] commanded them
[17:21] that they should not depart from

[17:49] the seasons which the father put in his
[17:50] own power

[17:56] you and it shall be witnesses unto me
[17:58] both in jerusalem in all judea in

[18:58] dense honeys then love sticks to the
[19:01] honey
[19:02] forgiveness then love
[19:05] sticks to the honey another thought
[19:08] virtue power to witness
[19:10] so we'll see how it goes from there
[19:13] today is 33 years since a revelation of
[19:16] brotherly kindness broke upon this
[19:18] church
[19:19] it was 33 years ago
[19:22] 1981 uh it was august 31st just like
[19:26] this sunday 1981
[19:29] uh
[19:30] we up in kaiwal and uh
[19:32] i remember
[19:35] those days had no
[19:37] electricity we had
[19:39] gas lamp to pump and so on
[19:41] and the lord
[19:42] led me to that quote when the church
[19:44] finds israeli love whole distance he
[19:46] placed in christ
[19:48] and i told them the little group that
[19:49] was there this must be revealed this is
[19:51] a revelation i told him we can't go no
[19:54] further until it be revealed
[19:56] and we stayed there until god broke upon
[19:58] us that revelation and poured his spirit
[20:02] right after that and when the spirit
[20:04] began to pour out 981 it was a new thing
[20:06] to us we never saw that before but it
[20:08] was really really something at that time
[20:11] but he has a witness and the other
[20:13] witnesses may be here at that time
[20:15] and we went out saying come rejoice with
[20:17] us of course people thought we were
[20:18] joking
[20:20] but we were prophesying
[20:22] because god gave us a revelation our
[20:24] revelation came stimulation
[20:26] and we testify about it in paris 1982
[20:29] give witness to what god has revealed
[20:32] now i said something a while and i'm
[20:34] keep saying it that you could change
[20:36] pastors preachers beliefs doctrines but
[20:38] you cannot change revelation
[20:40] revelation is when god has revealed
[20:43] something to you
[20:46] hallelujah
[20:47] even contrary to your senses is still a
[20:49] revelation
[20:50] example isaiah said the visions are
[20:52] conceived it was a revelation and look
[20:54] on church at that time there was a
[20:56] revelation
[20:57] now when talking about a little bit
[20:59] world issues the jihadists what do they
[21:02] call them
[21:03] in iraq and syria and so on i heard the
[21:06] prime minister of
[21:08] britain
[21:10] he made a statement he said we know what
[21:11] the problem is
[21:13] the problem is the
[21:14] theology it's not food
[21:18] it's not the people poor and they need
[21:20] food they need some mercedes-benz they
[21:22] need some cable tv they need some
[21:24] western uh kentucky fried chicken and
[21:26] mcdonald's it's not that
[21:28] it's a matter of a belief
[21:31] that's right convert or die is a matter
[21:33] of a belief
[21:34] it's a teaching it's a theology it's
[21:36] something that they're looking for to go
[21:38] beyond uh to go into the life beyond
[21:42] and uh i was talking in marvel about uh
[21:45] saw this girl from england going you
[21:47] know

[21:55] she want to fight and and she want all
[21:57] the mother girls in england to come over
[21:58] to and someone like that they fight for
[22:00] the cause and so on like that these

[30:11] elijah that's scripture but when god
[30:13] sees that he sees william marion branham
[30:16] that scripture becomes a life
[30:19] that scripture that word becomes a voice
[30:24] that word comes alive
[30:28] and you sit here
[30:30] today
[30:31] scripture sitting
[30:34] scripture shocked him
[30:41] glory to god no wonder no wonder john
[30:44] shouted no when when the lamb took the
[30:47] book no wonder john saw his name no no
[30:50] wonder he praises god and if you begin
[30:53] to see who you are if the word begins to
[30:56] open up to you the more the words open
[30:59] up to you is the more you worship
[31:04] why culture this morning
[31:10] the more the world opened up to you
[31:13] is the more you worship because the more
[31:16] you begin to see he is worthy he took
[31:20] the book
[31:21] he paid my price he redeemed me
[31:24] he delivered me
[31:25] he restored me
[31:27] he took my charges he dismissed my case
[31:34] [Applause]
[31:40] let me see that
[31:42] you see
[31:44] you see you have to understand who is
[31:45] greater
[31:47] who is more powerful
[31:48] you always swear by someone's greater
[31:51] and god end up swaying by himself
[31:53] because there was no more greater than
[31:54] him
[31:55] so he saw by himself i kind of like that
[31:58] that's when you're very big
[32:00] when you're bigger than big when there
[32:02] is nobody else bigger than you
[32:04] you could sign it yourself you could
[32:06] stamp it yourself you are god by
[32:09] yourself
[32:10] you don't need help to be who you are
[32:13] you they need somebody to reveal who you
[32:15] are you you know who you are
[32:18] or give the lord some praises
[32:20] oh hallelujah

[32:41] his people
[32:42] [Applause]
[32:51] no

[32:54] what does that have to do with what
[32:56] happened last night
[32:58] yesterday
[33:00] since when you so righteous
[33:02] uh

[33:06] a virgin where you were born and
[33:08] righteous bring your scripture and i
[33:10] bring my scripture for all have sinned

[33:22] morning to testify about
[33:24] or to boast about
[33:26] but his righteousness has become my
[33:30] righteousness
[33:31] i hope you're hearing me
[33:33] he took my place that i can take his
[33:37] place
[33:38] you're making me feel the preach this
[33:40] morning

[34:05] [Music]
[34:08] [Applause]
[34:19] was moving on to the second part of his
[34:21] ministry
[34:24] because the lord told him
[34:26] it shall come to pass
[34:28] that you shall know the secrets
[34:31] of the people's heart
[34:34] he didn't just step into it
[34:37] he grew into it
[34:39] i'll say it that way
[34:41] first time he hold the hands and begin
[34:42] to tell them certain things but then god
[34:44] was going to bring him to something
[34:45] higher
[34:47] god don't drop us to the top
[34:50] he dropped us to the bottom
[34:53] and say climb
[34:55] fight
[34:57] press
[35:00] overcome victory over the enemy
[35:05] god could have sent jesus full-grown man
[35:08] from the corners of heaven
[35:10] with chariots of angels and fire
[35:12] just as elijah went up jesus could have
[35:14] come down
[35:15] but god's a holder baby
[35:16] [Music]
[35:17] [Applause]
[35:21] you wanted jesus to be a teenager
[35:24] to know what the teenager go through
[35:28] he wanted jesus to be a young man
[35:31] to know what young men go through
[35:34] so he could be touched
[35:37] by what you feel
[35:44] you you heard what i said
[35:47] so when you're feeling lonely
[35:49] he knows it
[35:51] when you're feeling down
[35:53] he knows it
[35:54] when you're feeling tired
[35:57] he knows it
[35:58] when you feel like nobody cares
[36:01] he knows that
[36:03] he can be touched
[36:05] by the feelings
[36:07] by the feelings by what to go through
[36:12] what nobody understands he can be
[36:15] touched
[36:16] if the lord can praise these people
[36:19] [Applause]
[36:33] into that second phase of his ministry
[36:36] the lord spoke to him some words that i
[36:39] want to bring back to you this morning
[36:42] these are the words
[36:44] if you'll be sincere
[36:48] and will get the people to believe you
[36:52] not even cancer
[36:54] shall stand before your prayer
[36:57] [Applause]
[36:57] [Music]
[37:00] note
[37:01] the start
[37:03] he did not say get the people to believe
[37:05] you
[37:06] that's the first step
[37:08] he said if you
[37:10] be more
[37:12] sincere
[37:16] then if you could get the people to
[37:17] believe you
[37:19] not even
[37:20] cancer going to stand before your prayer
[37:25] now at that time cancer was sung in us
[37:28] ebola songs today
[37:30] within a week or less you're dead
[37:33] after getting contact with
[37:34] ebola no cure at present they're still
[37:37] struggling
[37:39] and it so happened that one time brother
[37:41] branham was in a meeting i think about
[37:42] 10 000 people
[37:44] woman came up on the platform
[37:47] and she came up there and began to talk
[37:48] to her he says something is happening
[37:50] all of a sudden he began to see a
[37:53] middle-aged woman he'd been gonna see
[37:54] her like 12 years old in a classroom
[37:56] begin to see a pen
[37:58] sticker in her eye
[38:00] and he began to say i see her 12 years
[38:02] the classroom she said yes brother
[38:05] brandon when i was 12 years old i penn
[38:06] state my eye and that's why i'm blind in
[38:08] one eye
[38:10] and then begin to tell her something
[38:11] more the woman fainted and when she got
[38:12] back up from the painting her eyes was
[38:14] normal
[38:17] and right there and then
[38:19] things change
[38:20] from the first to the second
[38:23] just like that
[38:26] it wasn't a sermon
[38:28] it was not testimony
[38:30] it was a manifestation
[38:32] [Applause]
[38:38] so
[38:41] so when jesus said you shall receive
[38:43] power
[38:44] that's not a human thought
[38:46] that is not a teaching to express well
[38:48] you know
[38:49] shall we see power no no no no you shall
[38:52] receive
[38:53] power
[38:54] oh give the lord a shout
[38:57] that is
[38:59] your promise
[39:00] [Applause]
[39:06] you didn't come
[39:08] to hear a theology about receiving power
[39:11] you didn't come to hear the greek
[39:13] understanding
[39:14] of how there is no you want the power
[39:18] that the scripture declares
[39:21] that you have to receive
[39:23] [Applause]
[39:29] you have to receive pay
[39:32] you're going for your salary off your
[39:33] pay and a man come and tell the boss
[39:35] come and say you were going to receive
[39:36] your pay
[39:37] you said i will come here
[39:40] the man
[39:44] i work for that
[39:45] i come for the real thing
[39:48] you write on a paper you will receive
[39:49] your pay i didn't come for that
[39:51] that's still words
[39:53] i want dollars i want to see the dollar
[39:55] sign
[39:58] a hundred twenty fifty i wanna see those
[40:01] notes
[40:02] because that is what i work for
[40:05] you are crook
[40:07] [Applause]
[40:10] you ordered as a man as a crook
[40:12] you work for him you're waiting for your
[40:13] pay and you might say you shall easy pay
[40:15] yeah i heard that last month
[40:18] i come for the pay
[40:19] [Applause]
[40:21] you understand it now
[40:23] when you shall receive power
[40:24] [Applause]
[40:33] i want to adjust your thinking
[40:36] but there's some coming to hear it
[40:39] coming for it
[40:41] [Applause]
[40:44] that's a different thing all together
[40:47] if you're coming forward you're making
[40:49] preparation for it
[40:51] how you get the power
[40:52] and that demon allah standing there are
[40:55] you getting the power and you're
[40:56] unsanctified are you getting the power
[40:59] and you have jealousy and envy
[41:02] then you have to set limbs up get out
[41:03] get out get up get out
[41:05] [Applause]
[41:09] then you
[41:10] make preparation
[41:12] because you have expectation
[41:14] for the manifestation
[41:16] because you have revelation
[41:19] oh give the lord praise those people
[41:22] okay sit down amen
[41:24] all right
[41:27] if
[41:28] amen you will be sincere
[41:32] i will get the people to believe you
[41:35] not even cancer shall stand before your
[41:37] prayer
[41:39] let's isolate that word
[41:42] sincere
[41:45] sincere is free from pretense
[41:48] or deceit
[41:51] proceeding from genuine feelings
[41:55] you see it's better you tell me you hate
[41:56] me genuinely
[41:58] than to say you love me
[42:01] [Applause]
[42:10] so i prefer somebody genuinely say you
[42:12] know i mean i know i'm not a christian i
[42:13] go to church
[42:15] because christians are supposed to act
[42:16] like that i understand that because i've
[42:19] recently discovered a lot of people that
[42:20] i thought were christians they are not
[42:23] and they are in this message going to
[42:25] church
[42:27] but they are not
[42:28] because to be a christian is to be
[42:30] christ-like
[42:32] [Applause]
[42:34] not church like
[42:37] that's a different kind of like
[42:39] christ-like and church like christ don't
[42:41] resemble church
[42:43] christ is one thing church is another
[42:47] now listen if you were going by eyes
[42:51] in the days of the scribe and pharisees
[42:53] many people would have chooses crying
[42:54] pharisees they were looking good
[42:59] got some real nights
[43:02] hats
[43:04] guns
[43:06] scrolls
[43:08] buildings
[43:09] order
[43:24] so fancy and he was ripping into them
[43:27] you call that he was in ripping form
[43:30] [Applause]
[43:31] because for 400 years nobody touched
[43:34] them
[43:35] they were too big in the system
[43:37] they were too bad to be challenged
[43:40] they were on and here come this man so
[43:43] different
[43:45] smoking them out
[43:47] blowing them out
[43:49] shaking them up
[43:54] [Applause]
[43:56] and his disciples were contrary to the
[43:58] traditions
[44:00] so one time they said how come you
[44:01] decided to wash hands
[44:03] how come your disciples just eat thing
[44:04] on the sabbath day and do this
[44:07] oh come your disciples moving
[44:09] and jesus are getting the word
[44:11] of the word
[44:12] then you say which one are you all they
[44:14] talk about
[44:15] if a donkey falls in sabbath you will
[44:17] take him out
[44:19] they ain't gonna leave that don't get
[44:20] down the whole damn unless somebody else
[44:22] smarter than them take it out you say
[44:24] you will take it out on the sabbath day
[44:26] i thought you were supposed to work
[44:27] busting them left right and center they
[44:29] tried to trick jesus into taxes he said
[44:32] who inscriptions is on that caesar give
[44:35] caesar away caesar but give god what is
[44:38] god
[44:38] what what what what you're trying to try
[44:40] to time up you can't tie up the word
[44:42] the word is god
[44:44] you could never tie up the word
[44:46] come on say my somebody
[44:48] so jesus
[44:50] was handling
[44:52] challenges and listen he started that
[44:55] since he was 12.
[44:57] [Applause]
[44:58] when mary made a mistake and said your
[45:00] father i was looking
[45:03] for you i know somebody must have a
[45:05] record there who are the video camera
[45:06] hearing that they put on the papers
[45:08] jewels over jesus father jesus said
[45:10] jesus said no you not i'm about my
[45:12] father's business
[45:14] you know what jesus was saying joseph is
[45:16] not my father but he did it with classes
[45:20] he could have said to him father you
[45:21] know no he didn't do that he said i
[45:23] bought my father's business
[45:25] mine
[45:26] at this class as a class bus
[45:29] bus
[45:31] so so so so
[45:33] sincere
[45:35] means free from pretense
[45:40] heartfelt
[45:42] wholehearted
[45:44] profound deep genuine
[45:47] real
[45:48] honest
[45:49] watch having or showing true feelings
[45:52] that are expressed in an
[45:54] honest way
[45:55] genuine or real
[45:57] not false
[45:59] fake or pretended
[46:01] that is why
[46:02] give
[46:03] you know
[46:04] say what you want about jacob jacob was
[46:06] honest
[46:07] when he said i am jacob
[46:09] i'm no good woman at the well it didn't
[46:12] justify her life and the behavior but
[46:13] she was honest and that's why jesus said
[46:16] you speak the truth
[46:17] hallelujah the one you're living with is
[46:19] not yours you had five before that she
[46:21] was honest
[46:22] honest doesn't mean somebody uh not
[46:24] right uh justified but they're truthful
[46:26] from inside
[46:28] they are they are in other words they
[46:31] own up and accept responsibility for
[46:33] their actions and attitude what makes
[46:35] somebody dishonest when they want to
[46:36] blame
[46:38] a lot of people blame the easy to blame
[46:40] they blame this one you blame that one
[46:42] you blame that one you blame because
[46:44] you're not honest to accept
[46:46] responsibility that you made that
[46:48] decision
[46:50] you choose your action you could choose
[46:52] to forgive you could choose to hold out
[46:54] you could choose to do it whatever you
[46:56] want to choose people do what they want
[46:58] to do
[46:59] isn't that right they might find stay on
[47:01] their knees too long but going someplace
[47:03] they have no problem with that
[47:05] but you got to be honest and when they
[47:07] start to be honest you get to be sincere
[47:10] sincere with your husband since they're
[47:11] with your wife since you're with your
[47:13] children since you're with god and i'll
[47:15] say it this way if you cannot be sincere
[47:17] with somebody who you see how could you
[47:19] be sincere with god who you cannot see
[47:23] give the lord some praise as people
[47:25] that is why we have to be honest
[47:28] with each other
[47:30] in order to be honest with god
[47:32] [Music]
[47:34] oh give the lord some praises people
[47:37] that's why you can't claim to love god
[47:39] and you can't love your brother and
[47:41] sister
[47:41] [Applause]
[47:46] forgiving somebody doesn't mean that
[47:48] they are right you know
[47:52] it doesn't vindicate them you know
[47:55] it free you from prison
[48:00] because when you do not forgive you
[48:03] imprison yourself
[48:08] [Applause]
[48:09] [Music]
[48:09] [Applause]
[48:19] being redone
[48:23] now he'll just keep flicking over him
[48:25] because yeah
[48:27] remember the story jesus gave about the
[48:28] man was forgiven
[48:30] and in prison
[48:31] and the man come and ask her partner
[48:32] forgiveness and he was owned a lot of
[48:34] money and he had somebody with another
[48:36] five a small thing and he come to lock
[48:38] this my neck and somebody carry report
[48:40] they say bang that man
[48:41] back to prison for him lock him up so
[48:44] you as a christian want to carry your
[48:45] oaths and grudges buying you you went up
[48:48] it up you end up in the prison yourself
[48:50] and the person who do you something they
[48:52] free as ever and you lock up
[48:54] you lock up
[48:56] because they do you
[48:58] and you have a fight
[48:59] and you can't even smile with them come
[49:01] shake their hand you have a fight
[49:03] no you buying it up because you can
[49:04] shake
[49:05] you bang because you can't talk you burn
[49:07] because you cut that one off you bang
[49:10] because you say god can't bless that
[49:11] muslim and god looking at you and god no
[49:13] he can't bless you because lord law
[49:15] doesn't allow it when god points
[49:16] blessing upon you boxing off and falling
[49:18] off
[49:19] because oughts cut it off
[49:23] you can't get your healing
[49:24] because you have thoughts
[49:27] my emails
[49:28] that's right that's right because faith
[49:32] is based upon forgiveness
[49:34] and your healing comes by faith
[49:36] and if the faith is not right you can't
[49:39] get your healing
[49:41] hallelujah healing doesn't come by
[49:42] coming to church thy faith that makes
[49:45] you whole
[49:47] come on give the lord praise those
[49:48] people
[49:49] so if you want to be healed
[49:51] today
[49:52] you have to know that there's no oughts
[49:54] in your heart
[49:55] i'm not talking about physical heal only
[49:57] i'm talking about spiritually healed
[49:59] healing mind heal and soul
[50:02] heal from your past
[50:03] heal from your fears heal from your
[50:06] heart
[50:08] [Applause]
[50:12] [Music]
[50:16] and do you know as i said the other
[50:18] night people better check up on our
[50:19] experience
[50:20] for the holy ghost is only going to
[50:22] anoint in the last days
[50:24] those who sigh and cry
[50:26] for the abomination that did in the city
[50:29] oh holland no that's a that's a shaken
[50:31] one i'm not going to stay there i'm
[50:32] going to move on
[50:33] if i stay there i will just keep shaking
[50:35] like that
[50:36] there's a shaking one not those who are
[50:38] books and tapes sorry i mean sorry you
[50:41] know you see that's why we're going back
[50:42] to the word now not those that read the
[50:44] bible unless people reading that even
[50:46] theologically not to argue what right
[50:48] and what's wrong
[50:49] so it's not that it's those that sigh
[50:53] where is coming from you don't sign from
[50:54] your head
[50:57] you sign from your heart
[50:59] that's why god tell them it will be more
[51:01] sincere start with the heart first
[51:04] are you with me
[51:06] when i say amen or not i still preaching
[51:09] if you feel i'm dependent upon your aim
[51:11] and to preach this i'm not depend upon
[51:12] your amen and still the heart has to be
[51:14] first
[51:16] all right here we go
[51:18] today we can shout
[51:20] we can scream we can speak with tongues
[51:23] have signs and things
[51:25] but where
[51:26] is that sincerity
[51:29] of so sincere about the word of god
[51:33] and the church of god until it grieves
[51:35] our heart to see the sin going on
[51:38] no i don't want to you sincerity like
[51:40] people say it could be sincere and um
[51:42] you know sincerely protect is
[51:44] uncertainly wrong we're not talking
[51:46] about that kind of sincerity i'm not
[51:47] talking about sincerity in a negative
[51:49] way
[51:50] i'm talking about sincerity as a growth
[51:53] in god
[51:55] for god to approve for you to go to the
[51:57] next
[52:02] level i'll say this now
[52:06] but obama was told you have been given
[52:08] power to bind a mamba
[52:12] the mamba couldn't affect him
[52:14] it was affecting other brethren
[52:17] he was told you listen to the words have

[52:23] but be more sincere
[52:25] [Music]

[52:29] god didn't tell him if you'll be more
[52:30] sincere you get the power he said i'll

[52:34] but then going forward
[52:36] i want something more
[52:38] from you
[52:41] where are the amens on that one
[52:44] this is how god speaks

[53:10] he said go tell my servant david
[53:13] i brought you out from among sheep go
[53:16] tell him that he told the prophet go and
[53:18] tell my servant david it didn't make
[53:21] david lester of a servant he said tell
[53:23] him
[53:24] and god sent me to tell you this morning
[53:27] what i have to say
[53:29] what he once said

[53:39] it's up to you to anoint it it's up to
[53:41] you to walk in it is up to you
[53:44] [Applause]
[53:51] when he called israel together elijah
[53:53] and challenge them let the god
[53:56] that is supernatural let him that can
[53:58] show himself alive let him be god
[54:00] if all of your theologians he was
[54:02] speaking to them if balaam is a god if
[54:04] he can answer let him answer
[54:06] let the god answers let the god that
[54:09] keeps his word be god and isn't that a
[54:12] challenge tonight
[54:13] let the god that keeps his word
[54:16] from being unafraid you know my ministry
[54:18] is a little slump now
[54:22] license licensee
[54:25] but if i'm saying that
[54:26] my ministry is a little slump now
[54:29] because it's changing in america from
[54:32] one to another
[54:34] if you notice it
[54:35] the first was a sign that the people
[54:38] look at
[54:41] his hands
[54:42] the second here we go was a sign
[54:46] that only god himself could do
[54:52] no on this third ministry whatever you
[54:54] call it to it phase two administry
[54:57] it lays right straight back in the lap
[55:00] of the people
[55:02] if they will come with that sincerity so
[55:05] now for the third step
[55:07] he is saying it goes back to the people
[55:10] no i'm going somewhere with this keep
[55:12] keep keeping me now
[55:14] keep with me now
[55:15] it goes back if they will come
[55:18] with that sincerity watch the holy
[55:21] spirit
[55:22] they
[55:23] will operate it itself
[55:25] [Applause]
[55:30] it comes up on me and tell them just
[55:33] exactly and it heals right there
[55:36] but they has got to come
[55:39] not with an emotional fate but with a
[55:41] solid fate to believe it's the truth and
[55:44] as god puts it right back to the
[55:46] individual up again because it has to be
[55:48] don't it has to be that way hey why
[55:51] because there is no power in man to heal
[55:55] i know that just ahead of me now lays a
[55:58] greater ministry
[55:59] than what i have
[56:01] but it will take the people just a
[56:04] little bit
[56:09] so but i'm talking about the greater
[56:10] ministry and you're also talking about
[56:12] the people let's go a little further
[56:14] when they go
[56:16] to get them faith in it it will start
[56:19] working
[56:20] how do i see visions out of the audience
[56:22] oh is it because you yourself are doing
[56:24] it
[56:25] i don't do that you do it
[56:31] oh
[56:32] hallelujah
[56:34] could be going deeper now
[56:36] now watch a minister cannot be a revival
[56:39] there's no preacher can bring a revival
[56:41] he doesn't pack it with him the only
[56:44] thing he can do is to be loyal to god
[56:45] and to the word the revival has to come
[56:48] by the people
[56:53] my
[56:54] my my my mind
[56:56] in their home in their life
[56:59] oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that
[57:01] right
[57:02] blessed be the name of the lord praise
[57:04] his wonderful name

[57:16] that god has appointed you
[57:18] to bring a revival
[57:20] you have something to bring
[57:22] [Applause]
[57:25] but abraham said god is waiting for his
[57:27] people
[57:28] to go to calling on god
[57:30] to get his servants into action
[57:35] whenever you're ready god ready

[58:56] if you're not only wounded you'll see
[58:57] that piece that drive myself
[58:58] [Music]
[59:02] fundamentally fundamentally he was right
[59:05] but there's more goes with it besides
[59:07] that
[59:08] you can be ever so fundamentally right
[59:11] yet the promises of god is based upon a
[59:14] condition
[59:16] they can be ever so fundamentally right

[59:20] they were keeping their sacrifices as
[59:23] reverend as they could doing what the
[59:24] lord told them
[59:25] aha

[59:27] without the sincerity behind it
[59:31] i'm reading something about sincere just
[59:32] to get a backdrop here
[59:34] he was saying they were doing the things
[59:36] they were coming irreverent but no
[59:38] sincerity
[59:40] behind it

[1:02:06] and he was identified by the pillar of
[1:02:08] fire
[1:02:09] but just as the purifier identified that

[1:05:18] word is only talk
[1:05:20] look on scriptures deep things
[1:05:23] deep deep deep
[1:05:24] but god also revealed himself
[1:05:27] by manifesting himself
[1:05:30] for example christ
[1:05:32] is the mystery of god
[1:05:34] revealed
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:37] no christ is the word right
[1:05:39] when we preach the word we preach in
[1:05:41] christ

[1:05:46] mystery revealed
[1:05:48] [Applause]
[1:05:50] now he shall turn the heart of the
[1:05:51] children back to the faith of the
[1:05:52] fathers half of the children that's you
[1:05:54] right
[1:05:55] that's a scripture but until you come
[1:05:58] into manifestation it's a scripture
[1:06:00] but that has to be revealed
[1:06:02] and that revelation had to be a
[1:06:03] manifestation
[1:06:05] your heart turned back to the faith of
[1:06:07] the fathers
[1:06:08] and if your heart is turned back you do
[1:06:10] what they did
[1:06:14] that is not talking your heart turn back
[1:06:17] because the bible said my heart turned
[1:06:18] back turn back where

[1:06:49] think should be booking the box
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:06:52] [Music]

[1:06:56] to leave the world
[1:06:58] praying and getting healed
[1:07:00] praying and getting god answering their
[1:07:02] prayer
[1:07:03] god had no limit with age and healing
[1:07:06] not because your old god can heal you
[1:07:09] [Applause]
[1:07:13] god has nothing with time
[1:07:16] age
[1:07:17] height
[1:07:18] distant

[1:07:53] by manifesting it and vindicating it
[1:07:58] showing it's his word
[1:08:00] being brought to pass in the day that
[1:08:03] it's promised
[1:08:05] now jesus said
[1:08:08] if you can't believe me
[1:08:10] [Music]

[1:08:15] jesus didn't say if you can't believe me
[1:08:17] come for some more books and tapes
[1:08:21] no
[1:08:22] he said believe the works
[1:08:24] i have works to demonstrate
[1:08:27] beyond the words
[1:08:30] [Applause]
[1:08:32] hallelujah
[1:08:33] oh that's good
[1:08:35] that's very good you see describing
[1:08:37] fantasy was talking for years
[1:08:40] their only words were ceremonies
[1:08:42] their only words were spots and pants
[1:08:45] their only words was every song on him
[1:08:47] they're saying different things that was
[1:08:49] their only works but jesus he was a
[1:08:51] little different
[1:08:52] besides bossing them and chopping them
[1:08:54] and cutting them and so on he was
[1:08:56] healing the sick he was raising the dead
[1:08:58] he was cast no devil he was preaching
[1:09:01] the father's word
[1:09:07] one time they come and say what
[1:09:08] authority do you do these things
[1:09:11] yes
[1:09:15] he said what power is doing all your
[1:09:17] business with
[1:09:32] cast the devil's out
[1:09:34] finger just the finger of the cast
[1:09:36] not the hand don't use the hanger just
[1:09:38] the finger god just got finger casting
[1:09:41] devils out
[1:09:42] finger of god cast
[1:09:45] finger
[1:09:46] just just touch his finger
[1:09:49] casting the devil's eye caster by the
[1:09:51] finger of god
[1:09:52] oh hell no wonder those demons cried out
[1:09:57] get their sword a finger
[1:09:59] and they knew the power in the finger
[1:10:03] oh
[1:10:05] oh we're gonna cast all that out
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:12] somebody going free today
[1:10:14] somebody will deliver today
[1:10:17] yeah somebody will be healed today
[1:10:19] i'm expecting it today
[1:10:22] because no faith is
[1:10:26] [Applause]
[1:10:27] okay
[1:10:28] now watch
[1:10:31] it's so strange that the people didn't
[1:10:32] want to believe him
[1:10:34] he being a man
[1:10:36] make himself god
[1:10:37] and no man can do these books without
[1:10:39] god being with him we know nicodemus
[1:10:41] said that
[1:10:42] so this is council then knew that
[1:10:44] and now we know that the word watch they
[1:10:48] would have known the word he said if you
[1:10:49] had known moses you would have known me
[1:10:52] because moses wrote of me now we look if
[1:10:54] they had looked back in the scripture to
[1:10:56] see here we go what the messiah is
[1:10:59] supposed to do
[1:11:00] then they would have known him by the
[1:11:02] vindication god
[1:11:05] through christ was reconciling the world
[1:11:06] to himself
[1:11:08] and yes by the love bringing to pass
[1:11:11] all the promises that was for the
[1:11:13] messiah
[1:11:14] he jesus born record of the word making
[1:11:17] that word live for that day
[1:11:21] so there are scriptures but there are
[1:11:23] scriptures to make live
[1:11:25] and people have to come on the scene to
[1:11:27] make the world live
[1:11:30] why some just talking it others going to
[1:11:33] walk in
[1:11:34] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:11:37] this world is going to live
[1:11:39] so the dynamics
[1:11:41] going to begin to bring your seed to
[1:11:43] life

[1:34:20] and i'm now on page three
[1:34:22] just 13 pages
[1:34:24] oh hallelujah
[1:34:26] oh blessed be name of the lord
[1:34:29] oh my so they missed him the living word
[1:34:31] manifested in the flesh by the word that
[1:34:33] is promised
[1:34:34] watch
[1:34:35] she held on to her transition our
[1:34:36] tradition
[1:34:37] she held onto the substitute blood
[1:34:39] instead of the real blood
[1:34:41] when he was manifested caused their
[1:34:43] traditions jesus
[1:34:45] the manifested word said to the hebrew
[1:34:47] bride because
[1:34:49] you hold to your traditions
[1:34:52] you make the word of god without any
[1:34:55] effect to you
[1:34:57] this is the problem today in this
[1:34:59] message they have had it for so long
[1:35:02] that it has become traditional
[1:35:04] it becomes what we do on a sunday what
[1:35:06] what we believe and so on it becomes
[1:35:08] christianity comes to what people
[1:35:10] believe
[1:35:11] and teachings and doctrines and that
[1:35:13] make them a christian by their belief
[1:35:15] not by the life
[1:35:17] it's no longer the thunder that shakes
[1:35:18] the devil what we need is tons of live
[1:35:21] voices
[1:35:22] our life the thunder
[1:35:24] oh hallelujah we said in a funeral a
[1:35:26] song when you sing it makes it a song
[1:35:31] it gives meaning when you sing it
[1:35:33] life gets mean and when you live it
[1:35:36] not when you talk it life gets mean and
[1:35:38] when you live it
[1:35:40] we have to live something friends now
[1:35:42] watch that's the reason today that the
[1:35:44] revival is supposed to have we have the
[1:35:46] nominational revivals we haven't had a
[1:35:48] real steering no no no no sir don't
[1:35:51] think we have got revivers we haven't
[1:35:53] they got millions and millions of church
[1:35:54] members but not a revival nowhere

[1:36:06] members but now we switch from that
[1:36:08] we're going to leave right now the bride
[1:36:11] hasn't had a revival yet
[1:36:13] [Applause]
[1:36:17] there has been no revival there
[1:36:20] no here we go
[1:36:22] manifestation of god
[1:36:24] to steal the bride
[1:36:26] not
[1:36:27] a new message
[1:36:30] not more teachings
[1:36:32] and more mysteries
[1:36:35] and a set of foolishness coming out on
[1:36:37] the hidden mysteries i know the mystery
[1:36:39] is foolishness
[1:36:41] have nothing to do with the word of god
[1:36:45] hallelujah but i ain't ready to deal
[1:36:46] with them things yet
[1:36:48] time will come
[1:36:50] hallelujah praise god will challenge
[1:36:52] falsehood

[1:41:06] here and say um
[1:41:08] claire's truth brethren

[1:41:44] beating people boy

[1:41:50] house had eaten me up in other words
[1:41:53] they got him real mad max
[1:41:56] he was upset he was angry that that is
[1:42:00] the condition that the message came to
[1:42:04] ah
[1:42:05] he was willing to break the rules
[1:42:09] break the norm
[1:42:11] something had to be done it just was
[1:42:14] that business as usual because messiah
[1:42:17] is on earth now
[1:42:19] [Applause]

[1:42:47] those devils have to leave
[1:42:50] you see you don't have power we know
[1:42:51] that

[1:42:53] but you have something that i think you
[1:42:55] need to understand that you have you
[1:42:57] have authority
[1:42:59] authority and power is that the same
[1:43:01] thing
[1:43:02] the police have authority to stop the
[1:43:03] car with his hands
[1:43:06] he doesn't have power to physically stop
[1:43:08] the car but he has authority to do so

[1:44:42] really weak boy
[1:44:44] that's not the word
[1:44:45] the word said that the weak say

[1:44:53] to win this vote challenge fifty percent

[1:45:04] let the week say i am strong
[1:45:07] let the poor say i'm rich
[1:45:10] what god is trying to tell the people
[1:45:16] i'll give you the word
[1:45:17] you kept hearing back to the word back
[1:45:19] to the word listen to this
[1:45:21] therefore
[1:45:22] i say unto you
[1:45:24] whatsoever you desire
[1:45:27] when you pray
[1:45:29] believe that you receive them
[1:45:32] and you shall have them
[1:45:34] you have to believe you got it before
[1:45:35] you get it
[1:45:36] [Applause]
[1:45:40] that is in red
[1:45:44] i just read fear isn't red
[1:45:46] it means jesus said it
[1:45:48] there's not a quote from that all of it
[1:45:50] jesus said what you pray for believe you
[1:45:53] got it
[1:45:56] and you shall get it
[1:45:57] [Applause]
[1:46:01] you have to get it before you get it
[1:46:03] do you get it
[1:46:05] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:46:08] that is why if you get it before you get
[1:46:10] it you have to praise him to show that
[1:46:12] you get it
[1:46:13] because here is the substance of what
[1:46:16] you're hoping for
[1:46:18] [Applause]
[1:46:24] my god my god
[1:46:26] you maybe see that you have no revival
[1:46:29] no manifestation of god to stir the
[1:46:30] bride yet we are looking for it it will
[1:46:33] take those servants
[1:46:34] back there to wake her up again
[1:46:37] he will send it
[1:46:39] not a man going to bring it
[1:46:41] he will send it he promised it no he had
[1:46:44] a key come on here now
[1:46:46] if the churches
[1:46:47] will forget their creeds
[1:46:49] forget their dogmas just take the bible
[1:46:53] and plead the promise
[1:46:54] then it will become effective to them
[1:46:58] but they don't want to do that
[1:47:00] oh hallelujah
[1:47:02] so i remember on the inspiration i
[1:47:04] dropped the exact words here on the
[1:47:06] inspiration 1981 i was saying the holy
[1:47:09] spirit is ready to see the whole thing
[1:47:11] but where's the honey
[1:47:13] where's the brotherly kindness the
[1:47:15] spirit was crying out for the honey
[1:47:18] 1981
[1:47:19] i knew that anointing was prophetic i
[1:47:22] knew it was sometime in the future to
[1:47:23] come
[1:47:24] because what the condition is right now
[1:47:26] there's no honey right now
[1:47:27] honey as a teaching or abduction of
[1:47:29] thought but look at the church's city
[1:47:30] and the conditions
[1:47:32] bridging not fellowshipping people
[1:47:33] getting cut off there's no honey oh yes
[1:47:36] honey become a reference point of what
[1:47:38] it used to be on the world kind of thing
[1:47:40] like that but there's not no real honey
[1:47:41] really because here's why but ram says
[1:47:44] when the church
[1:47:45] finds
[1:47:47] is brotherly love
[1:47:48] holy this is a place in christ it will
[1:47:50] call
[1:47:51] you'll have to call
[1:47:52] the church have to have a voice
[1:47:54] come and rejoice with us
[1:47:56] hello
[1:47:57] how you can rejoice with us if you don't
[1:47:58] like us
[1:48:00] hit us
[1:48:01] against us
[1:48:02] fighting us you can't rejoice you say
[1:48:04] you just on your on your own
[1:48:07] but it can't work that way
[1:48:09] you see and if we believe that we are
[1:48:11] right and all of that wrong it can't
[1:48:12] work that way either
[1:48:13] so it has to be an understanding by
[1:48:16] revelation that the honey has to be
[1:48:18] displayed
[1:48:19] [Applause]
[1:48:21] so in reality this rock box confession
[1:48:24] is your faith
[1:48:25] but honey have to be added to the fate
[1:48:28] for the faith to be effective in other
[1:48:30] words honey caps the fate off
[1:48:33] because love could only connect to honey
[1:48:37] [Applause]
[1:48:39] so all who looking for love to connect
[1:48:41] their faith they have something coming
[1:48:44] because that's how it is brotherly
[1:48:46] kindness gives you the window
[1:48:49] to the holy spirit's slot
[1:48:51] so brody can't become the key
[1:48:53] to your blessing when you're ready to
[1:48:55] forgive god ready to seal you
[1:48:57] when you're ready to forgive god ready
[1:48:58] to forgive you and there are people in
[1:49:01] your life that you know you have not
[1:49:02] forgiven
[1:49:03] no i'm not asking anybody to raise their
[1:49:05] hands to confirm that
[1:49:06] you will have to know
[1:49:08] what's going on in your heart
[1:49:10] what is going on
[1:49:12] therefore the virtue for this age in the
[1:49:14] pyramid must be displayed isn't that
[1:49:17] right and when that is displayed it
[1:49:19] proves your
[1:49:21] rightness
[1:49:22] or your maturity
[1:49:24] because that oughts and grudge and
[1:49:26] whatnot it's like little children
[1:49:28] carrying a bunch of foolishness and
[1:49:30] brother branham says you know when the
[1:49:32] brown arms had a fight they fight in the
[1:49:33] backyard
[1:49:35] and then
[1:49:36] when they come to the front they defeat
[1:49:38] they come together as a team isn't that
[1:49:40] right but in the backyard the brothers
[1:49:42] fight
[1:49:43] now as long as the devil
[1:49:46] could keep the brethren fighting
[1:49:48] the world constitutions could stay where
[1:49:50] they are
[1:49:51] they are ready to move yet
[1:49:53] because the devil recognized things that
[1:49:55] happened
[1:49:56] them fighting you don't have to fight
[1:49:58] he said fight one another
[1:50:00] hold that and fight one another
[1:50:03] hold on
[1:50:04] hold that grudge continue that one keep
[1:50:06] on hating keep on going
[1:50:08] don't miss service now
[1:50:11] don't miss service now stay with your
[1:50:12] head but don't miss it
[1:50:14] amen don't forgive your wife but don't
[1:50:15] miss service now keep on coming to
[1:50:17] service
[1:50:18] and people get set in that now they
[1:50:19] forget that his church
[1:50:21] but as soon
[1:50:23] as the honey
[1:50:25] begins to move this is prophetic now
[1:50:28] once the spirit of brotherly kindness
[1:50:30] begin to move by revelation inspiration
[1:50:33] the war will be over
[1:50:36] and then
[1:50:37] when the devil realized
[1:50:39] he cannot get one heart
[1:50:42] to have an art
[1:50:44] or grudge
[1:50:46] on the bride
[1:50:47] then he will get his forces on the
[1:50:48] outside
[1:50:50] and when the press come down
[1:50:52] you're going to see the two people there
[1:50:56] as long
[1:50:57] as there are internal wars and wars
[1:51:00] among brethren the devil have it easy
[1:51:04] but it's the prophecy that the honey
[1:51:06] will stick
[1:51:08] i don't care what it looks like
[1:51:10] god said so
[1:51:13] there's a prophecy that love will
[1:51:15] conquer all
[1:51:18] god said so
[1:51:20] there's a prophecy
[1:51:22] that one day
[1:51:23] we'll be standing talking and love will
[1:51:26] drop down
[1:51:28] and all the evil will be taken out
[1:51:30] god set you
[1:51:39] [Applause]
[1:51:43] yes
[1:51:45] yes
[1:51:46] you have to forgive you mean you really
[1:51:48] can't go without self-righteous spirit
[1:51:50] no
[1:51:51] no god will burst that there's a
[1:51:53] religious spirit or waiting for them to
[1:51:55] get confiction
[1:51:57] is that right
[1:51:59] you it
[1:52:08] all of that is religious business
[1:52:10] when you get rid of all of that
[1:52:12] and you recognize god's blood
[1:52:14] for them is the blood
[1:52:17] for you
[1:52:18] well let me switch it over god's blood
[1:52:21] for you is the same blood
[1:52:23] for them and as god show you mercy
[1:52:26] you have to show them mercy
[1:52:29] as god show you grace
[1:52:31] so you show them grace
[1:52:33] oh give the lord praise his people
[1:52:36] you've got to go beyond
[1:52:38] hallelujah be on your camp
[1:52:40] hallelujah be on your stand you've got
[1:52:43] to go beyond your family you've got to
[1:52:45] be on your doctrine and teaching

[1:52:55] baptist i don't care if your method is i
[1:52:57] don't give you a pentecostal he didn't
[1:52:59] say all are we in the inspiration he
[1:53:01] didn't say that
[1:53:03] come on tell me somebody
[1:53:05] that means our righteousness must exceed
[1:53:07] that of the scribe and the pharisees
[1:53:09] because they love their own
[1:53:12] [Music]
[1:53:16] am i preaching the word on earth
[1:53:19] but say amen
[1:53:23] jesus blessed his own disciples
[1:53:25] love their own loving states confess
[1:53:26] they love their own too
[1:53:28] amen
[1:53:30] so you love your own you love your own
[1:53:32] everybody love their own
[1:53:33] but i am saying christianity demands you
[1:53:36] go beyond that
[1:53:38] [Music]
[1:53:40] it means you serve anyone anywhere any
[1:53:42] race any kind any people because it's
[1:53:44] christ and you the hope of glory
[1:53:47] christ didn't pick and choose
[1:53:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:53:51] he came onto his own his own received
[1:53:52] receiver not but as many have received
[1:53:55] him to damn he gave power
[1:54:00] my god
[1:54:02] hallelujah
[1:54:04] i found the coin
[1:54:06] when forgiveness is found
[1:54:08] and the churches could be invited and
[1:54:10] gathered i don't know who it is they
[1:54:12] don't believe in
[1:54:13] the seventh seal open they don't believe
[1:54:14] this doesn't matter rejoice with us
[1:54:17] i didn't say come and believe my
[1:54:18] doctrine
[1:54:19] i said something happened to my life i
[1:54:22] get a revelation that their blood
[1:54:24] atonement is up added to my faith
[1:54:26] and now i am under the blood i have
[1:54:28] direct access to his presence
[1:54:32] my sins are forgiven
[1:54:34] i am justified as if i never did it
[1:54:37] i am free
[1:54:39] and i want you to know i am free
[1:54:41] come and rejoice with me
[1:54:47] [Applause]
[1:54:52] so then brotherly kindness
[1:54:54] open up a channel
[1:54:56] for the power to come back
[1:54:58] there will be no power outside of the
[1:54:59] order of god
[1:55:01] there have been no power outside of the
[1:55:02] anointed faith that comes only through
[1:55:04] forgiveness
[1:55:06] faith is based on forgiveness there's no
[1:55:07] power coming there's no power coming to
[1:55:09] no church no ministers and saying we are
[1:55:10] right all day wrong god is not honoring
[1:55:12] that
[1:55:13] hallelujah hallelujah people are
[1:55:15] deceived thinking god honor their
[1:55:17] meanness
[1:55:19] they envy their jealousy the attitude no
[1:55:21] god's not going to honor that we're
[1:55:22] going to honor his word
[1:55:25] notice god not understood this group me
[1:55:28] no his word
[1:55:30] you have to be on the word isn't that
[1:55:32] right if you're on the word if i am on
[1:55:34] the word if there's churches on the
[1:55:35] world god will honor his word
[1:55:37] if you are on the word call will honor
[1:55:38] the word in your life
[1:55:40] i cannot stop god from on his word in
[1:55:42] you
[1:55:43] he has to say this is my son this is my
[1:55:44] daughter i can't say lord don't bless
[1:55:47] her don't bless him no he will bless who
[1:55:49] you want to bless
[1:55:50] he said in blessing i will bless thee
[1:55:53] oh give the lord praises people
[1:55:55] could we take a little more
[1:55:57] oh my god
[1:55:59] [Music]
[1:56:02] is based upon forgiveness
[1:56:08] he said if you do not forgive neither
[1:56:10] will your father must forgive you is not
[1:56:11] right
[1:56:13] and
[1:56:15] this message rapture and faith will only
[1:56:17] be revealed to those who forgive their
[1:56:18] brothers
[1:56:21] teaching on moses if we have one ought
[1:56:23] among us we stand
[1:56:25] in damnation of hell's fire
[1:56:28] so when the words see the new as
[1:56:29] individuals begin to take on life
[1:56:32] what is that
[1:56:33] this here we point to faith and virtual
[1:56:36] knowledge this is a picture
[1:56:38] it's colored
[1:56:39] it have words in it and that's just what
[1:56:41] that is
[1:56:43] that cardboard thing there is not inside
[1:56:45] of you
[1:56:46] that's the cardboard with woods on it
[1:56:48] but when your seed
[1:56:50] grows to take your own life
[1:56:52] it means it comes at a living faith
[1:56:54] a living virtue i live in knowledge how
[1:56:57] many understand that now
[1:56:58] in other words it's no longer something
[1:57:00] on the board
[1:57:01] if there's something in you
[1:57:03] coming to life
[1:57:05] [Applause]
[1:57:08] so how user gets scared and fighting
[1:57:09] when it's happening a living faith
[1:57:11] coming inside of you takes away the fear
[1:57:14] and you'll find yourself believing all
[1:57:15] things
[1:57:16] hoping all things you're believing for
[1:57:18] your children you're building a family
[1:57:20] and you want to get the tests you'll
[1:57:21] come with a mini skirt they'll come over
[1:57:22] their parents they come over there
[1:57:23] smoking come up with drugs whatnot and
[1:57:25] god will test you to see if you would
[1:57:27] use your eyes
[1:57:28] or you would use your face
[1:57:32] whenever you come to the spot where you
[1:57:34] get disconnected from your emotions
[1:57:37] when you no longer use your five senses
[1:57:40] the devil will be frustrated
[1:57:42] that what your eyes see no longer
[1:57:44] intimidates you
[1:57:46] because you'll recognize your faith
[1:57:48] declare your world
[1:57:50] and your world is what god said in his
[1:57:51] word
[1:57:53] you refuse what the devil have to offer
[1:57:56] you refuse sarah's body condition
[1:57:59] and you consider the things that are not
[1:58:00] as though they were
[1:58:02] and you stack another promise of god
[1:58:05] through unbelief but you're going to be
[1:58:07] strong in faith
[1:58:08] giving glory to god knowing that he is
[1:58:11] able to perform what he promised
[1:58:14] and knowing that god can't lie
[1:58:16] yes your situation is bad but god could
[1:58:19] work things out
[1:58:21] [Applause]
[1:58:23] glory
[1:58:25] hallelujah
[1:58:26] and as your faith get inspired the word
[1:58:29] began to give you wings
[1:58:31] that you could soar and fly to believe
[1:58:34] all things are possible
[1:58:36] right though some of you ground there
[1:58:38] but i am believing god i'm gonna begin
[1:58:40] to anoint you and the word i'm gonna
[1:58:42] give you start to give you some wings
[1:58:44] that you can make your sign fly and soar
[1:58:47] to believe that all things are possible
[1:58:50] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:58:52] do you believe that
[1:58:54] william branham a charity do you believe
[1:58:56] that
[1:58:57] william branham had the love of god upon
[1:58:59] him do you believe that it was
[1:59:01] manifested and vindicated it wasn't just
[1:59:04] a topic
[1:59:06] something happened to him
[1:59:07] he said i wish it happened all the time
[1:59:10] that's what stopped the bull
[1:59:12] that's what stopped the bees that's what
[1:59:14] spoke to his wife or his wife
[1:59:16] oh praise his name
[1:59:18] he prophesied that we're going to get
[1:59:20] inside of there also
[1:59:22] oh blessed be name of the lord so
[1:59:24] therefore god must see that seven age
[1:59:27] virtue
[1:59:28] he must see that forgiveness that
[1:59:30] forgiveness will identify your rightness
[1:59:33] when you're arguing first with your wife
[1:59:35] i confess with your husband you're not
[1:59:36] right yet
[1:59:37] you have to go beyond argument you have
[1:59:40] to understand god's program and god's
[1:59:42] will
[1:59:43] hallelujah isn't that right
[1:59:45] isn't that right praise the name of the
[1:59:46] lord so when that brotherly kind is
[1:59:48] beginning to move again
[1:59:50] by revelation and manifestation then
[1:59:53] you're going to see the power of god
[1:59:54] begin to move god gave us a sign 32
[1:59:56] years ago i was a catholic i wasn't a
[1:59:59] pentecostal i would kingdom catholic
[2:00:01] catholic jump and scream and shout and
[2:00:03] think i don't know that

[2:00:07] give me experience with his presence and
[2:00:08] so on and i begin to call the minister's

[2:00:18] people were there on the floor the power
[2:00:20] of god hitting them in kyogre
[2:00:22] it was something that we were shocked at
[2:00:24] it was something that came suddenly
[2:00:26] it was fire coming to vindicate
[2:00:28] revelation
[2:00:30] oh harlow there was no doubt in our
[2:00:31] hearts or minds what god did
[2:00:33] and i know something took place that
[2:00:35] then
[2:00:36] it was a sign of what is to come so i
[2:00:38] always knew it was prophetic in other
[2:00:40] words it was a sign a sign means just
[2:00:43] that a sign a sign is not the thing
[2:00:46] yeah bro keep saying i'm a sign there's
