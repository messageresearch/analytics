[0:00] [Music]
[0:05] and he spake a parable unto them to this
[0:08] end that men ought always to pray and
[0:11] not to faint saying there wasn't a city
[0:15] a judge which feared not God neither
[0:17] regarded man
[0:19] and there was a widow in that City and
[0:21] she came unto him saying avenge me of
[0:23] mine adversary and he would not for a
[0:26] while but after what he said within
[0:27] himself though I fear not God nor regard
[0:31] man
[0:32] yet because this Widow troubleth me
[0:35] I will Adventure lest by her continual
[0:38] coming she weary me
[0:40] and the Lord said hear what the unjust
[0:43] judge said
[0:45] [Music]
[0:50] and shall not God avenge his only lect
[0:52] which cried day and night unto him
[0:54] though he bear along with them
[0:56] I tell you that he will avenge them
[0:58] speedily
[1:00] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:02] shall he find faith on the Earth
[1:05] Jesus never questioned when he came back
[1:09] would he find respects
[1:12] he never questioned whether he had find
[1:15] Saints
[1:16] he never questioned whether he had found
[1:18] righteousness
[1:20] but what Jesus questioned whether he had
[1:23] fined or not is what I'm trying to
[1:24] uphold will I find faith when I'm coming
[1:28] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[1:30] write unto you of the common salvation
[1:33] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:34] and exhort you that ye should earnestly
[1:37] contend for the faith which was once
[1:38] delivered unto the Saints
[1:40] what is faith
[1:43] faith is something that's revealed to
[1:45] you
[1:46] that is not yet but you believe it will
[1:49] be
[1:50] faith is the revelation of the will of
[1:53] God
[1:55] now the only way that we're going to
[1:57] ever know what if we can only find out
[2:00] what the faith is
[2:03] then we can earnestly contend for that
[2:06] faith is that right
[2:08] [Music]
[2:10] that was once delivered to the Saints
[2:13] now if we'll go back to where they were
[2:16] first called Saints and find out what
[2:19] kind of face they had then we'll know
[2:22] or more or less
[2:24] uh what they can get what to contend for
[2:27] he was talking about when the first
[2:29] church was set in order
[2:31] was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost
[2:34] and now we'll notice what kind of faith
[2:37] that they had they had a face in a
[2:40] resurrection living Christ
[2:44] someone who rose from the dead and was
[2:47] living among them just as same as he was
[2:49] before he ever died
[2:52] now that see they wasn't contending for
[2:55] some historical Affair but they were
[2:57] contending for
[2:59] a living Christ a resurrected one who
[3:03] was in their midst
[3:13] [Music]
[3:39] thank you
[3:44] foreign
[3:57] [Music]
