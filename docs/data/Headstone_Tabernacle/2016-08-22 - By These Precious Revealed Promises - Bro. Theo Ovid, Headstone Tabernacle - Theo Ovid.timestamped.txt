[10:05] Michael Blackman. Please pray for one of
[10:07] my staff members, uh, Gina Batis, who is

[10:16] She also has two cancerous nodes on her
[10:18] liver. The operation is scheduled for
[10:21] Monday and there are some complications.
[10:23] I've ministered to her faith and told
[10:25] her her told her of this prayer request
[10:29] which her hope and faith is resting on
[10:32] asking God for a perfect work. And if
[10:35] there's any unspoken or unwritten
[10:37] requests you want to show by raise of
[10:38] hands as we approach the throne of grace
[10:41] this
[10:42] morning. Heavenly Father, Lord, we see
[10:44] every hand that's raised in the house of
[10:46] God this morning. And we thank you for
[10:48] your presence. We thank you for the
[10:50] angel of the Lord that's already in this
[10:52] house. Father, now we know from your
[10:55] word that healing is a children's bread.
[10:57] May you drop down this morning and
[10:59] minister to every son, every daughter,
[11:02] Lord, everyone that's connected on the
[11:04] internet this morning and for these
[11:05] prayer requests, Lord, that your
[11:07] children have sent to you, Father, for
[11:10] Lord, Sister Margaret Timothy this
[11:11] morning, Lord, for her strength. Lord,
[11:14] she's feeling weak and Lord, she needs a

[11:22] May Lord, she be completely healed and
[11:25] delivered. Lord, may this request become
[11:27] a note of praise, Lord, for Maria

[12:02] And may she be completely healed from
[12:05] the crown of her head to the soles of
[12:08] her feet. Father God, may you bless your
[12:11] people, Lord. May you bless his service
[12:12] this morning, Lord. May you bless our
[12:15] pastor as he comes to minister the word,
[12:17] Lord, this morning. May you touch him in
[12:19] body, Lord. He's tired. He's weary, but
[12:21] Lord, may the Holy Ghost, Lord, use him
[12:23] as never before. May he be an instrument
[12:26] that you could speak to your hungry
[12:28] children this morning. Father, may you
[12:30] bless your people in the precious name
[12:32] of Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[12:34] "Amen and amen." You may be seated for a
[12:37] few minutes.
[12:39] We have a visitor this morning. We want
[12:41] to welcome Beverly
[12:43] Joseph. Uh is she at Beverly
[12:47] Joseph? Welcome. Welcome to Headstone
[12:49] Tabernacle invited by Brother
[12:52] Gerald. Amen. Amen. Amen. Well,
[12:55] greetings in the precious name of Jesus
[12:58] Christ. But would ask me just to say a
[13:00] few words of greetings before he gets
[13:02] ready to come to the pullpit after we
[13:05] had a wonderful time in the summer
[13:07] international convention in Germany. And
[13:10] um I know some of you were connected
[13:13] online and I believe all of the services
[13:16] now are available on the website
[13:19] Christianfellowship.net. So I invite you
[13:22] uh during this week if you have not
[13:23] already seen the services uh to take
[13:26] some time to watch the services. It was
[13:28] really a tremendous blessing to be there
[13:31] to be among believers of like precious
[13:34] faith you know and as many of the
[13:36] brothers who ministered echoed there
[13:39] will be no divisions in heaven. There
[13:42] will be no this group on this side and
[13:43] this group and this side. So if on the
[13:46] other side we'll all be one family. We
[13:48] need to start to act like it from here.
[13:51] Hallelujah. It'll only be perfect love
[13:53] over there. So we have to start to
[13:55] display perfect love over here. It'll
[13:58] only be a a a family of God sharing the
[14:02] testimonies of how we made it
[14:05] over because we all have our trials. We
[14:08] all have our testings. We all have our
[14:09] situation and it was so precious. Um it
[14:12] was a first time for me to meet so many
[14:15] believers from around the world. There
[14:17] were about 35 or 36 countries uh that
[14:20] were represented there and certain
[14:23] precious believers uh really took up
[14:26] their time to travel many many miles and
[14:28] and and plane flights to get there.
[14:31] Namely, brother Ed Biscll who was one of
[14:34] brother Brandham's friends. He used to
[14:36] drive the prophet and his wife used to
[14:39] play keyboard at the tabernacle and at
[14:41] different uh meetings that brother
[14:43] Brandon would go to. And it was such a
[14:45] blessing to hear Sister Biscll speak to
[14:47] the young children about when she was
[14:48] about 5 years old around there when she
[14:51] met brother Random and and she was
[14:53] hiding and how brother Random spoke with
[14:54] her and how those words stayed with her
[14:56] for her entire life. And there were some
[14:58] other ministers there, brother Kenny
[15:00] Caps who grew up in Brandham Tabernacle,
[15:02] Brother George Smith, Brother Brandham's
[15:04] son-in-law, he was there and he spoke.
[15:06] These brothers all spoke and it was such
[15:08] a precious thing to hear not just the
[15:11] prophecies and the words of the prophet
[15:13] but to see how that prophet lived
[15:16] and how that prophet would as one of the
[15:19] brothers shared you would stand almost
[15:21] naked in his presence you know because
[15:23] the holy spirit the discerner of the
[15:25] thoughts and the heart would see right
[15:26] through you so brother Kenny caps I mean
[15:29] it was so much that was said it's
[15:30] impossible it was about 15 services in
[15:33] in six days so I mean, it was service
[15:36] after service, but at the end of it,
[15:38] Brother Clark, we didn't even feel tired
[15:41] because it was just basking in the
[15:42] presence of God, and it was such
[15:45] wonderful fellowship. And it was not
[15:47] just hearing the promises, but hearing
[15:49] the the softer side of the prophet as
[15:51] well, how he lived in his everyday life.
[15:53] And um, Brother Kenny shared a testimony
[15:56] of how brother Random's daughter
[15:58] expressed interest in him as a young
[16:00] boy. And when he heard this, he was
[16:03] like, "Why would she like me?" And
[16:05] brother Brandham's nephew said, "Well,
[16:07] if you have to go out with her, you have
[16:09] to go and speak to Uncle Bill." He said,
[16:12] "When he heard he had to speak to Uncle
[16:14] Bill," he said, "No, I'm not going to
[16:15] talk to her." He said because he knew
[16:18] that Brother Brandham would see through
[16:20] your life. And he was young, maybe 12,
[16:22] 13 years old or whatever. And he said he
[16:25] knew that he would take his money from
[16:27] school and buy comic books. And he
[16:29] didn't want Brother Brandham to know
[16:31] that he would read comic books on his
[16:33] way home from school. and he would take
[16:35] his little money and try to little
[16:37] gamble with his friends and everything
[16:38] and he didn't want but they ran him to
[16:40] see how he was living and it was such a
[16:44] precious thing to see the reverence and
[16:46] the respect of how the people who had
[16:49] the privilege the opportunity to meet
[16:51] brother Brandham how their lives were
[16:53] forever changed and the same brother
[16:55] Kenny Caps and he is speaking he's about
[16:57] 66 years old now and he's saying young
[16:59] people don't you ever leave this message
[17:03] because as a heavy price to pay. He said
[17:06] when he reached about 18 19 years old
[17:08] and you can listen it for yourself. He
[17:10] said he reached a point even after he
[17:12] had seen brother Brham and the ministry.
[17:14] He reached a point where he felt like he
[17:16] didn't need God anymore. And he said he
[17:19] decided to go and try to experience the
[17:21] world. And he married a girl who was not
[17:24] from church and ended up with two sons.
[17:26] And then one day living his own life he
[17:30] got a knock on his door and a police
[17:33] officer is out there. See how you Mr.
[17:35] Caps? He said, "Your wife was just in an
[17:38] accident and she died." And he say,
[17:41] "There he was with two boys, I think 2
[17:44] years old and four years old, and he
[17:46] couldn't even know how to respond." But
[17:49] he said, "Whether God does it or whether
[17:52] God does it in a gentle way or in a hard
[17:54] way, he will find a way to get you back
[17:57] to him."
[17:58] [Music]
[18:00] And all of us this
[18:01] morning, this might be the hard way. It
[18:04] might be the easy way, but we are here
[18:06] this morning in the presence of the Lord
[18:08] that he can minister to us. Some through
[18:12] the fire, some through the flood, but
[18:14] all through the blood. And it puts us in
[18:17] a unique position where when you have
[18:19] this revelation, you can't look down at
[18:22] anybody. You can't criticize anybody
[18:25] because we are all contending for the
[18:27] faith. We are all contending because we
[18:29] want to make it. I don't believe there's
[18:30] anybody in here this morning who doesn't
[18:32] want to make it. We want to be a
[18:36] Christians. We want that living reality,
[18:38] that pillar of fire to be veiled in us.
[18:42] And it was such a it was such a joy to
[18:44] hear the brothers minister from around
[18:46] the world. One brother, brother brother
[18:47] Timuit, he preached a powerful message
[18:50] on giving an account. And it's something
[18:52] that I believe every believer should
[18:54] listen to. And he spoke about how we all
[18:57] have to give an account in whatever role
[19:01] we are. As a husband, we have to give an
[19:03] account. As a father, we have to give an
[19:05] account. As a young person, you have to
[19:07] give an account for your time. You have
[19:10] to give an account for your influence.
[19:12] You have to give an account for the
[19:14] opportunities you had to share a word to
[19:17] somebody, but you didn't do it. Because
[19:20] we have to give an account. We can't
[19:23] depend on anybody else's account. But we
[19:25] have a responsibility for the time that
[19:27] we have for for what we have been given.
[19:29] We have to give an account for this
[19:31] message that came to us dripping with
[19:33] blood. Through all the church ages, we
[19:36] have received a precious jewel and and
[19:39] what have we done with it? It was such a
[19:42] joy to hear brother Edis speak about how
[19:45] brother Brandon would be ministering and
[19:47] a prayer request would come up and
[19:48] somebody would say, "No, he's in this
[19:50] place." He said, "No, no, no. He's is in
[19:52] this other place." And found out that
[19:54] very morning he moved house to somebody
[19:55] else and moved and lived somewhere else.
[19:57] And the Holy Spirit already discerned
[19:59] that that morning he's in a different
[20:00] house to see the angel of the Lord just
[20:03] operate. And you have to hear it for
[20:05] yourself. So I really encourage you to
[20:08] really spend time in the word,
[20:11] friends, now more than ever. And I heard
[20:14] one brother say, "Don't let brother
[20:16] Brandham's voice be a stranger in your
[20:18] house."
[20:19] Amen. Amen. That's a powerful statement.
[20:22] Don't let the voice of the prophet be a
[20:26] stranger in your home. Your children
[20:29] must be able to recognize that voice.
[20:32] Your neighbors must be able to recognize
[20:34] that voice. Let them ask the question,
[20:36] who is that preacher? Because we have
[20:38] received a message and a messenger. And
[20:41] we have a responsibility to sweep this
[20:43] message on to the coming of the Lord.
[20:46] Because rapture and faith is laying in
[20:48] this message. Promises of adoption is
[20:51] laying in this message. A superchurch is
[20:53] laying in this message. A church without
[20:56] spot or wrinkle is laying in this
[20:58] message. Healing is laying in this
[21:00] message. The power of God is laying in
[21:03] this message. It's not in word only, but
[21:06] it's the power of God unto salvation.
[21:08] Can the church say amen? Yeah. You know,
[21:12] so it was really really such a great
[21:14] privilege and a blessing and to see the
[21:16] young people respond and to see the
[21:19] altar call and to see the angel of the
[21:20] Lord really deal with
[21:24] individuals and brother Edis spoke a
[21:27] message of he came to me when I couldn't
[21:31] go to
[21:32] him. He came to me when I couldn't reach
[21:37] out to him. He came to me when I was the
[21:42] end of my road. He came to me. Is that
[21:45] anybody's testimony here this morning?
[21:49] This has nothing to do with your
[21:50] neighbor. It has nothing to do with your
[21:52] family. It has nothing to do with what
[21:54] happened last year or last month. But
[21:56] when you are at the end of your road and
[21:57] you thought of giving up, he came
[22:01] to me. Because if he didn't come to you,
[22:04] you couldn't be here this morning. But
[22:07] he came
[22:11] to me.
[22:14] So I want to challenge you
[22:16] church, be more sincere.
[22:20] Realize that we are at the closing
[22:23] minutes of this world. Any day now we
[22:27] could be
[22:29] gone. It's it's real. It's it's a
[22:32] reality. It's a reality.
[22:35] [Music]
[22:36] Can we all stand to our feet? Let's just
[22:39] sing the songus. Where would I
[22:46] be?
[22:49] God. May the Lord bless you.
[22:58] [Music]
[23:08] Oh, an empty
[23:12] space. Oh, if not. Oh, hallelujah. Oh,
[23:17] you really singing this morning with a
[23:19] revelation. Where would I
[23:23] be? Oh, God.
[23:28] Oh yes.
[23:32] I'm
[23:53] seeing for grace. Amazing grace.
[23:59] Amazing
[24:01] gra. Oh, how sweet the sound. Oh yes,
[24:08] Lord. I was lost.
[24:13] Oh my
[24:28] [Laughter]
[24:41] god. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[25:00] So empty
[25:02] space and empty
[25:06] space.
[25:09] Oh for
[25:11] grace. So give him praise this morning.
[25:14] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus. Glory
[25:17] be to God. Oh hallelujah.
[25:46] Praise the
[25:47] Lord. Let's bow hands with a prayer.
[25:51] Almighty God, truly where would we
[25:54] be but for your grace. Lord, we thank
[25:56] you for your love. We thank you for your
[25:59] comfort. We thank you for your blood. We
[26:02] thank you for extending mercy to us,
[26:04] grace to us, your love to us. And so,
[26:07] Lord, we want to be able to extend to
[26:08] others. Father, may come in a special
[26:11] way and speak to our hearts. We wait on
[26:13] you, Lord. God. We are needy people and
[26:17] we are desperate and hungry for you.
[26:19] Amen. We are thirsty for you, Lord. We
[26:21] want to be changed. We want to be
[26:24] transformed. We want to be made ready.
[26:27] What's the use of coming to church if
[26:29] we're not going to be ready? Help us and
[26:31] prepare us this morning. In Jesus name
[26:33] we ask it. Amen. And why don't you turn
[26:36] around and greet somebody in Jesus name.
[26:40] Glad you
[26:43] see
[26:44] through life.
[26:49] [Music]
[27:00] in for
[27:04] grace. You may be seated. Praise God.
[27:08] It's great to be back home.
[27:12] [Applause]
[27:15] And I guess one of these days when we
[27:18] get back when we get back to where we
[27:20] came from, we would say it's good to be
[27:22] back home.
[27:24] And I could see the heavenly father
[27:26] saying, "Welcome home, my children." Oh,
[27:28] what a de I'm going to do
[27:33] uh greetings from Germany and we had a
[27:36] tremendous time, a wonderful time in the
[27:38] Lord. Uh I was able to meet ministers
[27:42] I've never met before, believers I never
[27:44] met met before. Uh there were brother Ed
[27:47] Biscll, brother John Conte, brother
[27:50] Isaac, brother Kenny Caps, brother Kelly
[27:52] Hinderbrandt, brother Tim Puit, Brother
[27:55] Raymond Thompson, brother Ron Spencer,
[27:58] Brother George Smith and myself. We were
[28:01] there and the saints we had a wonderful
[28:04] time. Amen. And um you know it was very
[28:08] moving to have testimonies of people who
[28:11] were eyewitnesses of brother Brandham's
[28:13] life and
[28:16] uh it it was a particular service that
[28:18] really moved me and it was testimony by
[28:21] brother Ed Biscal and you know he was
[28:23] very close to brother Brian Arm Hunting
[28:25] and a lot of experience with him but
[28:28] what somebody said this and it struck me
[28:30] really deep there is no way out except
[28:35] up.
[28:37] What this world has to face, what what
[28:42] we have to face, there is no way out.
[28:46] Wealth can't take you out. That's right.
[28:48] Digging an underground bunker can't save
[28:50] you out. In a earthquake proof socalled
[28:54] building that
[28:56] can take you
[28:58] out. There's only one way that is up.
[29:02] Glory.
[29:04] And when I when that struck me, it it
[29:07] bring the reality how real God is. Amen.
[29:12] This message is and why God send and
[29:15] that say that there going to be a
[29:16] rapture. Amen.
[29:18] So no stocking up of food going to going
[29:22] to save you from what's coming. Amen.
[29:25] The Bible describe it as the beginning
[29:27] of sorrows. Amen. The Bible continued to
[29:30] speak about it as a time of trouble such
[29:32] as never was
[29:35] since the beginning of time.
[29:39] There is an eternity friends. Amen. And
[29:42] all of us going to have to give an
[29:43] account
[29:45] to God. Amen. For our
[29:48] thoughts, for our
[29:50] words, and our actions.
[29:54] I really want to thank brother Steve
[29:56] [Applause]
[29:59] Malveri for standing in the gap to
[30:02] exhort you for two
[30:06] weeks and I thank you for being here to
[30:09] give that support.
[30:14] [Music]
[30:16] I want to thank God for him for his
[30:17] dedication to God as a Christian. God
[30:21] bless you.
[30:27] So what was in Germany meeting was a
[30:29] whole new crop of believers and
[30:31] ministers and to see and experience such
[30:35] fine Christian spirit.
[30:39] Now I I believe in my
[30:41] heart that many people have gotten away
[30:46] from this Christian
[30:48] moorings and
[30:50] spirit. Somewhere along the
[30:53] line it has become so arrogant and
[30:56] puffed up. And I will say this to
[31:00] you and those who may hear this
[31:03] message. If you are up there, wherever
[31:06] up there
[31:07] is, or you are higher than I, wherever
[31:11] higher than I is, or you are tall and
[31:14] powerful and
[31:15] mighty, the question is, how did you get
[31:19] up
[31:21] there? How did you get up there? Now, if
[31:25] God's
[31:26] grace put you up there, what right or
[31:30] authority do you have to kick somebody
[31:34] in their face who is down there or below
[31:38] where you are?
[31:40] So, I want you to know we are where we
[31:43] are and we are what we are by the grace
[31:48] of God.
[31:54] [Applause]
[31:57] Hallelujah.
[31:59] You know what Ran says? God is looking
[32:02] for somebody, anybody that the more he
[32:06] blesses is the more humble it becomes.
[32:11] Because
[32:12] usually that that's the
[32:15] norm. Usually when people get blessed,
[32:19] they get puffed up. Amen. I say no. So
[32:22] it's very rare to see somebody where God
[32:25] pouring it on them and they become like
[32:27] a channel of God's blessing. They're not
[32:29] stingy. They're not mean. They're not
[32:31] clogged up. They're like a vessel that
[32:33] God could just and serve others and
[32:37] bless others and anoint others and help
[32:39] others and pull us up others and
[32:41] encourage others. That's what God is
[32:44] looking for. Amen.
[32:48] So my God, so truly I believe in all my
[32:50] heart that God has men everywhere and I
[32:53] was really blessed to hear the
[32:56] testimonies but Brandham's son-in-law,
[32:58] brother George was there and he give
[33:00] testimony how he first caught Brandham's
[33:03] daughter and the whole experience of
[33:04] brother Brandham everything else. It was
[33:05] really it's something you got to see.
[33:08] But I want to wrap this up
[33:11] with saying this that brother Brandon
[33:15] didn't only preach a message but he
[33:18] lived a message.
[33:22] It it was no game thing. Amen.
[33:25] Brother Ed Biscll is I think the last of
[33:28] the preaching preachers who was in
[33:30] brother Bram. I think so. One was
[33:33] brother Perry Green. He has gone on to
[33:35] be with the Lord. The other was brother
[33:37] Joseph Coleman gone on to be with the
[33:38] Lord and just brother Edis is around
[33:42] he's 81 years of
[33:44] age
[33:45] and I spoke to him after he he preached
[33:48] his last
[33:49] service and
[33:53] um he came off the platform and was
[33:56] walking and talking giving about an
[33:59] experience and I didn't know where he
[34:01] was going with it but he was just
[34:02] talking and sharing himself and I'm
[34:05] going to realize when you reach a
[34:06] certain age, what matters is
[34:09] memories, is legacies, it's your
[34:13] experiences. You pass the stage of
[34:15] looking for house, car, land, wife,
[34:17] husband. You're now tapering off
[34:21] life.
[34:23] And he was speaking
[34:25] about a German woman on the
[34:29] platform and brother Brandham discerning
[34:32] that she was praying for her husband or
[34:34] something like that. I didn't be very
[34:36] pointed and and and accurate right now
[34:38] on it, but that's the gist of
[34:40] it. That he was sick with
[34:43] cancer. He didn't say he was healed. He
[34:46] didn't say he was going to be well. He
[34:47] was sick with cancer. And he went
[34:49] on. After a while or two days or so
[34:52] later, they were driving through a
[34:53] desert place far and wide and whatnot.
[34:58] And there was a house he was passing and
[35:00] he was telling brother Ed Biskell you
[35:02] see that man that woman I was speaking
[35:04] to about her husband sick with cancer he
[35:07] lives
[35:08] there. So brother Ed driving say but he
[35:11] know the man there but he don't know he
[35:13] had cancer. So I guess my doubts must
[35:15] have come in but Abraham did not rebuke
[35:18] him and he would know you can't hide
[35:21] from the
[35:21] prophet. You can't hide from him. after
[35:25] driving many many miles to meet somebody
[35:28] else and when brother Ed tell him about
[35:30] the man living there he said yes and the
[35:32] man of cancer so he got the confirmation
[35:35] the discernment without brother saying a
[35:38] word but he went on and begin to
[35:40] describe how for miles and miles not a
[35:44] human being in sight how rugged this
[35:46] prophet was and they came to this edge
[35:48] of this place where it was a valley had
[35:51] beautiful flowers and everything else
[35:54] And brother Bram sat there with brother
[35:56] Ed Biscll and telling brother Ed this is
[36:00] how it's going to be like this beautiful
[36:02] lush valley with flowers and so
[36:05] on. And this is what stirred my spirit.
[36:08] He said when you cross
[36:10] over you just have to walk down that
[36:13] valley there and you're going to find me
[36:16] on that valley.
[36:24] And I was I was gone. And he sense then
[36:27] that this is real.
[36:31] You're not going to be here forever.
[36:37] Keep pressing on, friends.
[36:40] [Applause]
[36:48] And you know when you hear things like
[36:51] that you would see the gravity of what
[36:55] came to us in this 20th century. Amen.
[36:58] Amen. The politics is crazy right now in
[37:00] the world today.
[37:02] There are wars and there going to be
[37:03] more wars and more not just rumors of
[37:05] wars. Things will begin to take place.
[37:08] It going to get
[37:09] worse and worse. Yes.
[37:13] While you are in
[37:14] church, cherish the time.
[37:19] Take hold of the moment.
[37:22] Let your faith rise to to to believe God
[37:25] for all things.
[37:28] It will take more than sitting in church
[37:30] to get out of here. It will take the
[37:33] supernatural.
[37:36] Not natural. Amen. Supernatural.
[37:39] And that is what we coming into this
[37:41] morning into the supernatural.
[37:44] So could we stand at this time as we
[37:47] want to sing I love him. I love him
[37:48] because he first loved me.
[37:57] [Music]
[38:06] He
[38:09] call he
[38:12] first love me.
[38:17] Thank you
[38:19] Jesus and
[38:24] pray
[38:28] my
[38:41] child told me he said he said the
[38:44] atmosphere was right. He said things he
[38:46] said he can't say again. It was just a
[38:48] right atmosphere to say those things. It
[38:50] take the right atmosphere for things to
[38:52] really come out. One thing we do know
[38:55] the walls are going to come down. The
[38:59] walls that ministers build,
[39:01] interpretation builds, men ideas build,
[39:04] they're going to come down. But the
[39:06] Brandham said God people will gather
[39:08] together.
[39:09] Hallelujah. It may take
[39:11] persecution. It may take pressure. But
[39:14] they will gather together. Oh
[39:16] hallelujah. Praise God. There'll be one
[39:18] more ride and the Holy Ghost himself is
[39:21] going to be in charge of that ride. So
[39:23] this morning, thank you musicians. We
[39:26] have three portion of scriptures we like
[39:27] to look at. Joshua 13 1 verse verse 1.
[39:32] Ephesians
[39:35] 1:3-5 and 2 Peter 1 verse 1-12.
[39:43] The title of the message this morning is
[39:45] by these precious revealed promises.
[39:49] Amen. The subject is partakers of his
[39:52] divine nature and the inspiration is
[39:54] possessing your individual inheritance.
[39:57] And I do have a context scripture from
[39:59] Joshua 14. We'll sit down after and
[40:01] you'll read. But let's turn to Joshua
[40:03] chapter 13 and we want to read verse one
[40:06] there. Now Joshua was old and stricken
[40:10] in years. And the Lord said unto him,
[40:13] "Thou art old and stricken years, and
[40:17] there remainth yet very much land to be
[40:21] possessed." Ephesians
[40:27] 1:3-5. Blessed be the God and father of
[40:30] our Lord Jesus Christ, who had blessed
[40:31] us with all spiritual blessings in
[40:33] heavenly places in Christ, according as
[40:36] you have chosen us in him before the
[40:38] foundation of the world, that we should
[40:40] be holy and without blame before him in
[40:43] love, having predestinated us unto the
[40:47] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[40:49] himself, according to the good pleasure
[40:52] of his will. I'll read in second Peter,
[40:55] reading verse 1 to 12. Simon Peter, a
[40:59] servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to
[41:01] them that have obtained like precious
[41:04] faith with us through the righteousness
[41:06] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ.
[41:09] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[41:12] through the knowledge of God and of
[41:13] Jesus our Lord, according as his divine
[41:17] power. Here we go. had given unto us all
[41:20] things that pertain unto life and
[41:23] godliness through the knowledge of him
[41:26] that had called us to glory and virtue
[41:29] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[41:33] let's read verse four together whereby
[41:36] are given unto us exceeding great and
[41:40] precious
[41:41] promises that by these ye might be
[41:44] partakers of the divine nature Having
[41:48] escaped the corruption that is in this
[41:50] world through lust. And besides this
[41:52] given all diligence, add to your faith
[41:54] virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to
[41:56] knowledge temperance, and to temperance
[41:58] patience, and to patience godliness, and
[42:00] to godliness brotherly kindness, and to
[42:02] brotherly kindness charity. For if these
[42:04] things be in you, and abound, then make
[42:07] you that ye shall neither be barren nor
[42:09] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[42:11] Jesus Christ. But he that lackth these
[42:14] things is blind, cannot see a far off,
[42:16] and had forgotten that he was purged
[42:18] from his old sins. Wherefore, the
[42:20] rather, brethren, give diligence to make
[42:22] your calling and election sure. For if
[42:25] you do these things, he shall never
[42:27] fall. For so an entrance shall be
[42:30] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[42:32] everlasting kingdom of our Lord Savior
[42:35] Jesus Christ. Wherefore I will not be
[42:38] negligent to put you always in
[42:41] remembrance of these things though you
[42:42] know them and he established in the
[42:45] present truth. Let's pray one more time.
[42:46] Father we thank you for your word
[42:48] interpreted to our heart. May the pillar
[42:51] of fire come Lord and rest on my
[42:53] shoulder and speak out to your people.
[42:55] May they hear direct from God this
[42:57] morning in Jesus name we ask it. Amen
[42:59] and amen. You may be seated. Praise God.
[43:03] And we say the title is by these
[43:04] precious promises. Amen. And the subject
[43:07] partakers of his divine nature and
[43:10] inspiration possessing your individual
[43:13] inheritance. Now for that I have the
[43:16] context scripture of Joshua chapter 14.
[43:19] I want to read from verse 6 to 14.
[43:28] Then the children of Judah came to
[43:30] Joshua in Gigal, and Caleb the son of
[43:32] Jeff the Kesanite, said unto him, Thou
[43:36] knowest the thing that the Lord said
[43:38] unto Moses, the man of God concerning me
[43:40] and thee in Kenesh
[43:42] Bania. 40 years old was I when Moses, a
[43:45] servant of the Lord, sent me from Kenesh
[43:47] Bania to espou the land, and I brought
[43:50] him word again as it was in my heart. It
[43:53] has to be in your heart, not your head.
[43:56] It's got to be in your heart to bring a
[43:59] word.
[44:01] Nevertheless, my
[44:03] brethren, and that went up with me made
[44:07] the heart of the people melt, but I
[44:10] wholly followed the Lord my God. And
[44:12] Moses swear on that day, saying, Surely
[44:15] the land whereon thy feet have trodden
[44:18] shall be thine inheritance and thy
[44:20] childrens forever, because thou has
[44:22] wholly followed the Lord my God. And now
[44:24] behold, the Lord had kept me
[44:27] alive. These 40 and 5 years, even since
[44:30] the Lord spake his word unto Moses,
[44:32] while the children of Israel warned in
[44:34] the wilderness, and now lo, I am this
[44:36] day four score and 5 years old. As yet,
[44:39] I am strong this day, as I was in the
[44:42] day that Moses sent me. As my strength
[44:45] was then, so is my strength now, for
[44:48] war, both to go out and to come in. Now
[44:51] therefore, give me this mountain whereof
[44:55] the Lord spake in that day. For thou
[44:57] heardest in that day, how the Anakans
[44:59] were there, the cities were great and
[45:01] fenced. If so be the Lord be with me, I
[45:04] shall be able to drive them out as the
[45:07] Lord said. And the Joshua blessed him
[45:10] and give unto Caleb the son of Jeffon
[45:12] Hebron for an inheritance. He therefore
[45:16] became the inheritance of Caleb the son
[45:18] of Jeffonire the Kesanite unto this day
[45:20] because he wholly followed the Lord God
[45:24] of Israel. May God bless his holy word.
[45:27] Oh, praise God. May we give the Lord
[45:29] some praising. Hallelujah.
[45:34] [Applause]
[45:38] I would like to be no other age than
[45:40] this age.
[45:42] This is the closing age. Yes, sir. This
[45:44] is the closing of time. We are honored
[45:47] to be in this age. Many wise men and
[45:49] prophets would have longed to be in this
[45:51] age. This have this age have the
[45:53] pressure and all the thunder you have to
[45:56] face. All the pressures you have to
[45:57] face. This is his age. All the
[45:58] temptations, all the trials, all what
[46:00] the devil could put out, this is his
[46:02] Eden. We are in Satan's Eden. Oh,
[46:06] hallelujah. And God promised to take a
[46:08] bride out of Satan's Eden. Oh, he will
[46:11] go to the corner of the earth to find
[46:12] you. He will go to your street and knock
[46:15] on your door to find you. You cannot
[46:17] escape. Hallelujah. You're not seeking
[46:20] him. He is seeking you out. Praise God.
[46:22] After this service, your life will not
[46:24] be the same. Glory to God. Something
[46:27] going to take place in your life. Let me
[46:30] prophesy over you this morning. Glory to
[46:32] God. This is not a normal service. This
[46:35] an unusual service. This a life changing
[46:38] service. You are going to be a partaker
[46:40] of his divine nature. Glory. You're
[46:42] going to eat out of it. You're going to
[46:44] receive it. You're going to apply it. It
[46:47] will be part of your system. Oh, give
[46:50] the Lord some praise, people.
[46:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. You may
[46:55] be seated. The Bible said, "If any man
[46:56] be in Christ, he's a new creator." Oh,
[46:59] glory to God. You're singing the same
[47:00] old body, same old face, same old eye,
[47:04] but a brand new you. Because there's a
[47:06] inside man inside that man. Come on, say
[47:09] amen, somebody. There's a man inside
[47:12] that man. Oh, hallelujah.
[47:15] Glory to God. 2 Timothy 16. 2 Timothy
[47:19] 3:16 says, "All scripture is given by
[47:23] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[47:28] doctrine, for reproof, for correction,
[47:32] for instruction in righteousness." Amen.
[47:35] And the amplified of that scripture
[47:37] says, "Every scripture is God breathed."
[47:40] Amen. It is given by his inspiration
[47:44] and profitable for instruction, for
[47:47] reproof, for conviction of sin, for
[47:50] correction of error and discipline in
[47:52] obedience,
[47:54] and for training in righteousness,
[47:57] in holy living, in conformity to God's
[48:01] will in thought, purpose, and action.
[48:05] Hallelujah. All scripture is God
[48:08] breathe. God breathe upon it.
[48:11] Hallelujah. That's why you can say my
[48:13] word shall not return unto me void
[48:16] because the breath of God is on every
[48:19] scripture. Holy men moved by the Holy
[48:22] Ghost. Holy men moved by the Holy Ghost.
[48:26] Holy men moved by the spirit of the
[48:28] living God.
[48:31] Oh hallelujah.
[48:33] We're not here to entertain you. We're
[48:35] here to bring you a word from the Lord.
[48:38] Oh, glory to God.
[48:41] Oh my. I certainly enjoyed by the George
[48:43] Smith testimony. He came and put a level
[48:46] on top the
[48:47] P and he had a whistle at this
[48:50] side. He said the level is to keep
[48:52] things level and the whistle is to blow
[48:55] when people falling asleep.
[48:59] And he used it. See you there.
[49:05] So I think I'll get a whistle.
[49:11] They can't believe we have the level.
[49:16] Okay.
[49:18] Now the Bible talk about I write in you
[49:20] children. I write to you young men and I
[49:22] write unto you fathers. Amen.
[49:25] God's objective
[49:28] is to get us to Christian maturity
[49:32] where we can handle God's stuff.
[49:36] You can't give an inheritance to a
[49:38] child. The Bible said if the child is
[49:41] the heir, even if the child is a heir,
[49:43] he has to be under tutors and governors
[49:46] until the time appointed
[49:49] by the father.
[49:51] Hallelujah.
[49:53] You know who the guy Bolt Bolt the guy
[49:55] who win the the the race thing. I heard
[49:58] something from him and he said the race
[50:01] is the easiest part.
[50:03] That's the easiest part to run the race.
[50:05] That's the easiest part. Come on now. He
[50:06] said the part that is hard is the
[50:09] training
[50:11] that he has to go through every day.
[50:14] Hallelujah.
[50:16] Every day. To run for 9 something
[50:19] seconds.
[50:22] Hallelujah. And we have a race to run.
[50:26] And we have a way to run. And we have to
[50:29] run this with patience.
[50:32] this
[50:34] race that is set before us. Hallelujah.
[50:39] Keep on running, brother. It's not a
[50:42] sprint. It's a long distance race. It's
[50:46] not those who start. It's those who
[50:50] finish. It's he that endure to the end.
[50:54] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[50:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[51:00] Glory.
[51:03] So therefore, God's objective
[51:07] is to bring you into a place of trying,
[51:11] that is your behavior,
[51:13] your chastisement,
[51:15] your ripening, your maturing, you ain't
[51:19] getting ripening listening to preachers
[51:21] preaching in church. My Lord, you get
[51:23] ripened by your test. Amen. By your
[51:25] upsets, by your disappointments,
[51:29] by your pray all night, you weep all
[51:32] night by the pain you got in the belly.
[51:36] That's what you That's what does
[51:37] something to you. God took away the
[51:40] prophet's wife, took away the prophet's
[51:42] daughter, and he was just testing him.
[51:46] Hallelujah. Because it is your behavior
[51:50] that sets you out to adoption.
[51:53] Everybody claim to be Christians.
[51:55] Everybody claim to be born again and to
[51:57] be God's children. But the Bible say try
[52:00] the spirits
[52:02] to see if it is of God.
[52:05] Hallelujah.
[52:07] Try them by what? By virtue. By
[52:09] knowledge, by temperance, by patience,
[52:13] by godliness, by brotherly kindness.
[52:16] It's not I trying you. The spirit's
[52:18] going to try you because what's inside
[52:21] of you is going to speak for itself.
[52:24] Oh, hallelujah.
[52:27] Glory.
[52:28] Hallelujah. So when the pillar of fire,
[52:31] the dove came upon Jesus, he got power.
[52:36] Amen. But God couldn't say he him yet.
[52:40] God give him power and he had to prove
[52:43] himself. So the spirit led Jesus into
[52:47] the wilderness to overcome the lust of
[52:50] the eyes, to overcome the lust of the
[52:52] flesh, to overcome the pride of life.
[52:55] And he told that old devil, it's
[52:58] written, it's written, it is also
[53:01] written. And Jesus overcome by the word.
[53:08] So that first anointing or power or
[53:12] presence came to position him as a son.
[53:16] But then he had to be tested.
[53:19] And then afterwards God take him aside
[53:21] onto a mountain. Hallelujah. Isn't that
[53:23] right? He had to be tried. Isn't that
[53:26] right? Because God can't give you power
[53:28] yet. He had to test it first. Can't give
[53:32] you full power. Give you a little taste
[53:34] and pull it off. You have to be able to
[53:36] climb up the ladder. You have to be able
[53:38] to add to your faith, virtue, and
[53:39] knowledge because power without
[53:41] character is satanic. And character is
[53:43] not a gift. Character is a victory. A
[53:47] lot of people don't know that character
[53:49] is when you leave here and you deal with
[53:51] your issues. When you leave here and you
[53:54] deal with your Philistines, your
[53:57] Goliath, your problems, and you handle
[54:01] it and you overcome, then character will
[54:05] be formed in you. Then God will do
[54:07] something with you because you're not
[54:09] sitting on the premises. You are
[54:11] standing on the promises. These precious
[54:14] revealed
[54:15] promises. Oh, give the Lord some
[54:18] praises, people. Do you believe these
[54:21] this word now? Hallelujah.
[54:26] Hallelujah. So in 1946, angel appeared
[54:29] to Brandon. All right. Empower him. All
[54:31] right. But the God didn't only empower
[54:33] him. It had others like all Roberts
[54:36] until different ones. They all had
[54:39] power. They all were doing signs and
[54:41] wonders. But guess what? Only one was
[54:44] adopted. Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[54:47] the house. Give the Lord a shout. All
[54:49] our signs and wonders and all that are
[54:51] at walking, dead raising, demons casting
[54:55] out. But when come to adoption time,
[54:58] when come to hear him, one man stood
[55:01] out. One man was different. One man had
[55:04] character. One man God said here
[55:09] [Applause]
[55:11] he Oh, give the Lord some praises
[55:13] people.
[55:17] [Applause]
[55:21] from hearing him, brother. Amen. Now,
[55:25] Jesus, here we go. Had proven to God
[55:30] that he's been the right kind of a son.
[55:34] Amen.
[55:36] I'm a son. I'm a son of God. I'm a
[55:39] daughter of God, you know.
[55:41] I have people backsliding years. I'm I'm
[55:43] a son, you know, and they backsliding as
[55:44] ever. I like God owe them.
[55:49] They're on the way to hell. I'm talking
[55:51] about their son. They are son.
[55:54] A son where
[55:58] God call you out to put you in. That's
[56:00] right. It's not good to come out of
[56:03] Baptist Methodist of religions. It's not
[56:05] good to come out only. You got to go in.
[56:08] This is to put you in.
[56:11] There's not I believe brother Brian I
[56:13] believe the message of the not this is
[56:14] not that. Amen. We had that for 50
[56:17] years.
[56:18] This is if you want to be changed.
[56:21] If you want to be listen if you want to
[56:24] be a partaker of his divine nature.
[56:28] Then then what he has become yours.
[56:33] Did you hear that? Then what he has
[56:36] become yours. So cusp Peter denying
[56:41] Peter. Peter said, "I don't know that
[56:43] man." When that divine nature became his
[56:47] own, he said silver and gold. I don't
[56:52] have but such as I have, I give. I give
[56:58] because I got it to give it. Give the
[57:01] Lord a praise.
[57:05] [Applause]
[57:10] Hallelujah.
[57:13] Now this is not mystery preaching. You
[57:14] know some people make the message so
[57:17] mysterious. There's that mystery mystery
[57:20] preaching you know. No this is the
[57:22] mystery. This is yet Christ is the
[57:26] mystery of God revealed. Every time the
[57:30] mystery come out it reduces produces
[57:32] Christ. Christ in the minister. Christ
[57:34] in the elder. Christ in the deacon,
[57:38] Christ in the usher, Christ in the
[57:40] church member. You're living a Christian
[57:42] life, not a mean, evil, wicked spirited
[57:47] life. No, not in your carnal life. No,
[57:53] not your natural life, but a spiritgiven
[57:57] life.
[58:01] [Applause]
[58:05] Jesus, God took him up the mountain,
[58:08] brought witnesses out there, heavenly
[58:10] witnesses, and he was clothed with
[58:12] immortality. My God, and they looked up
[58:14] and said, "His garment shine like the
[58:16] sun. A supernatural something take
[58:18] place. Was no book. Was no read that
[58:21] tape and it sounds good." And the Lord
[58:24] showed me. It wasn't that something took
[58:27] place. Hallelujah.
[58:29] A supernatural something took place and
[58:32] his garment glistened and God placed on
[58:34] him the robe of immortality showing that
[58:37] he had received them. Are you ready?
[58:41] Let's go. That's the thing that God will
[58:44] do to his sons here on earth someday.
[58:48] He will call you aside, church, if you
[58:51] will only obey him and stay on the word
[58:55] and believe it. He will place into the
[58:59] church before the coming of Jesus. All
[59:03] the powers
[59:05] that Christ had in him. Amen. Will be in
[59:09] the church. Hallelujah. Could I hear a
[59:12] shout on that? Not some of his powers.
[59:16] Hallelujah. Shout and say all. All. A
[59:18] bigger one. All. All. One more time.
[59:21] All. All the powers that Christ has.
[59:27] Oh God, we tired of sick people staying
[59:30] sick. Oh yes, we tired. We tired. Tired
[59:33] of sick people. Oh, glory to God. The
[59:36] sick's got to be
[59:37] [Applause]
[59:47] healed. Brother says, "We pray for them
[59:50] now. When that time come, we'll command
[59:52] it. We pray for some. Some get healed,
[59:54] some don't get healed. But when that
[59:56] time come, all getting
[59:58] healed. Did you hear what I just
[1:00:01] said? All the power that Christ had
[1:00:05] would be in the church. All going to be
[1:00:08] healed. Not even
[1:00:11] cancer. Not even cancer going to stand
[1:00:15] before the power that's going to be in
[1:00:17] the
[1:00:21] church. Do you feel it? You sons of God,
[1:00:25] do you sense it? You sons of God,
[1:00:28] you daughters of God, you may be seated.
[1:00:31] Notice the Bible said, "These signs
[1:00:32] shall follow ministers that believe." It
[1:00:35] said, "These signs shall follow them."
[1:00:38] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:00:41] Are you one of them?
[1:00:43] Come on now. Are you one of
[1:00:45] them? These signs shall follow them. Are
[1:00:49] you one of them? Give the Lord a shout
[1:00:51] on that.
[1:00:53] I say you are one of them.
[1:01:01] [Applause]
[1:01:04] All that God was, he poured into Jesus.
[1:01:08] All that Jesus was, he paused into the
[1:01:10] church. God wanting his work done, he
[1:01:14] sent it into his son. My Lord, the son
[1:01:16] want his work done, sent it into the
[1:01:18] church. Lord, at that day, you will
[1:01:21] know. that I am in the father, the
[1:01:24] father in me, I in you and you in me at
[1:01:30] that day because the same power that was
[1:01:33] in Jehovah God rest in Jesus Christ and
[1:01:37] the same power that rest in Jesus Christ
[1:01:40] rest in placed
[1:01:44] sons. Did you hear that? There is no
[1:01:47] mistake about that. Not
[1:01:49] sons. Please.
[1:01:54] [Applause]
[1:02:10] When Moses died,
[1:02:13] God didn't waste time and had a morning
[1:02:15] ceremony for Moses. He h out Joshua. He
[1:02:19] said, "Joshua, Moses, my servant, is
[1:02:21] dead. Now rise up. Cross them over. Take
[1:02:26] them across
[1:02:28] Jordan. Divide for them. An
[1:02:31] inheritance." Oh, you're not hearing me
[1:02:33] this morning. You're not hearing me this
[1:02:36] morning. The church is marching on. The
[1:02:40] truth is marching on.
[1:02:44] [Applause]
[1:02:49] You may be seated.
[1:02:51] When they were in Egypt, God, they were
[1:02:54] the people of God. That's right. When
[1:02:56] they were called out, they become the
[1:02:58] church of God. God objective wasn't to
[1:03:02] keep them in Egypt. No. Egypt was
[1:03:04] bondage. That's right. God objective
[1:03:07] wasn't to reign man on them along the
[1:03:09] wilderness journey. The wilderness was
[1:03:11] just a journey. The destination was
[1:03:13] Canaan. The destination was the promise.
[1:03:16] It was a promised land. By these
[1:03:19] promises, by these promises, precious
[1:03:23] promises, God said, "I'm a good God. I
[1:03:26] have a land flowing with milk and honey.
[1:03:30] It have faith in it. It have virtue in
[1:03:32] it. It have knowledge in it. It have
[1:03:35] godliness in it. It have brotherly
[1:03:36] kindness in it. There's a good land. I
[1:03:39] want you to partake of this land.
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:04:02] Oh, glory. He is bringing you out. He is
[1:04:06] bringing you out.
[1:04:08] [Applause]
[1:04:15] Let me see that. Let me caution you one
[1:04:18] time. When you feel the world of the
[1:04:21] spirit of God around you, respond.
[1:04:25] React. Do something.
[1:04:28] Shake. Raise your hands. Shake your
[1:04:30] head. Do a spin around. Stand up and sit
[1:04:34] back down. But don't just look. People
[1:04:37] miss the healing. People miss the
[1:04:39] blessing by not responding. We are not
[1:04:43] come to read a magazine for you. We come
[1:04:45] to bring dust, sayeth the
[1:04:47] Lord. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:04:51] [Applause]
[1:05:00] [Applause]
[1:05:06] When the angel come and stir the water,
[1:05:08] jump in.
[1:05:10] [Applause]
[1:05:12] Say like, say like Esther, if I perish,
[1:05:14] I perish. But I'm going in. I'm going in
[1:05:18] this morning. Got to go in this morning.
[1:05:22] [Applause]
[1:05:34] Hallelujah.
[1:05:36] Listen, when you're pointed in the right
[1:05:39] direction, the prophet say you to be
[1:05:41] reckless. Let your faith get reckless.
[1:05:44] Man can help you. Forget about that.
[1:05:46] Forget who in front of you. Forget who
[1:05:48] behind you. They can help you. If God
[1:05:51] could help
[1:05:52] [Applause]
[1:05:58] you, my God, if I feel to sit down on
[1:06:01] the platform, I'm going to sit down.
[1:06:03] Praise God. It's God to help me. It's
[1:06:06] God to help us. It's God to help
[1:06:10] you. We need him.
[1:06:19] [Applause]
[1:06:28] glory.
[1:06:30] Oh, oh,
[1:06:35] hallelujah. We feel his presence this
[1:06:37] morning.
[1:06:40] So therefore the power will rest in
[1:06:43] place sons because the disciples were
[1:06:45] given power and that was a temporary
[1:06:48] power that wasn't resident power that
[1:06:50] Matthew 10 power behold I send you power
[1:06:53] they were associated with Jesus and
[1:06:54] therefore they had the power of Jesus
[1:06:57] it's like you know somebody high up in
[1:06:59] the government and because you know you
[1:07:00] are rank
[1:07:02] because you know the prime minister you
[1:07:04] know this one you could go up to them
[1:07:06] because you partners will Jesus part
[1:07:09] they share in Jesus blessing. Yes. But
[1:07:11] when Jesus went off the mountain, them
[1:07:12] had no power to cast out no epileptic
[1:07:14] spirit.
[1:07:15] Because Jesus come off the mountain now.
[1:07:18] Hallelujah. But hear him upon him. Those
[1:07:21] guys was trying to cast out. The devil
[1:07:22] saying look at you.
[1:07:27] Jesus told you to cast out and not you
[1:07:29] could do it.
[1:07:31] My God. But Jesus coming down the
[1:07:34] mountain. Here come faith,
[1:07:37] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:07:42] godliness, brotherly kindness, charity,
[1:07:46] a sealed unit. That devil know he was
[1:07:48] trembling. Jesus Jesus is to open his
[1:07:51] mouth yet and the devil want to know
[1:07:53] when to get out. Oh, glory to God. It
[1:07:55] will speak for
[1:07:57] itself. Did you hear what I said?
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:03] Them devils said, "Paul, I
[1:08:05] know, Peter, I know, but who are you?"
[1:08:09] Those devils seeing something on the
[1:08:12] inside. Oh, it was more than a man. If
[1:08:15] you look at the man, you will say,
[1:08:16] "Peter deny Christ." If you look at the
[1:08:18] man, you will say, "Peter cursed." That
[1:08:20] had nothing to
[1:08:22] do with the plan and program of God for
[1:08:25] that man life. Your failures is nothing.
[1:08:29] Your failures, let me say it. Good.
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:34] That's what the blood is for. That's
[1:08:36] what the blood is for. The blood is for
[1:08:39] your failures. The blood is for your
[1:08:41] mistakes. The blood is for your sins.
[1:08:44] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:08:49] [Applause]
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:08:54] Hallelujah.
[1:08:56] Glory.
[1:08:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:01] Hallelujah.
[1:09:03] Glory to God. So, Brother Brandham, you
[1:09:06] will be seated. He was born a prophet.
[1:09:08] Born a prophet.
[1:09:11] But God told him, "Do the work of
[1:09:12] evangelist."
[1:09:14] To do what? To grow. That's right. To
[1:09:17] mature. Amen. To ripen. Amen. To be
[1:09:20] tested. And when he lose his wife and
[1:09:22] his child, every say, "Look at you. You
[1:09:23] preaching all these years and you're
[1:09:25] serving the Lord. If the Lord wouldn't
[1:09:26] answer your prayer, your daughter would
[1:09:28] not die, too.
[1:09:30] And he was almost giving in to say it's
[1:09:33] true devil. All of a sudden something in
[1:09:35] him not here. Something inside of here.
[1:09:39] Say the Lord give the Lord take it away.
[1:09:42] Blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[1:09:46] Lord give. The Lord take it away.
[1:09:47] Blessed be the name of the Lord. And
[1:09:49] what are you crying about? What trial
[1:09:51] have you been through? What? What?
[1:09:53] What's so hard? Get next to yourself.
[1:09:56] This is for no baby. This is for men to
[1:09:59] be boys to become men. Oh, glory to God.
[1:10:02] This is this is championship time.
[1:10:05] Glory. You don't go to Olympics because
[1:10:07] you just take a run around the block.
[1:10:09] No, you go there because you qualify to
[1:10:12] enter into races and enter into this and
[1:10:14] that because he's the best in the world
[1:10:16] of
[1:10:17] God. Call me now. Oh God, feeling good
[1:10:19] right
[1:10:20] now. So the devil has climax into his
[1:10:23] very best. So God promised to get his
[1:10:25] very best.
[1:10:29] You are here a shout in the house. Now
[1:10:32] you're beginning to know who you are.
[1:10:34] When God call you, he see you as his
[1:10:37] very best. I know you don't feel like
[1:10:40] it. I know you don't feel like it, but
[1:10:43] that does not change it.
[1:10:48] [Applause]
[1:11:08] So brother went through processes went
[1:11:10] through test and trial and character
[1:11:12] formation until God dropped into him the
[1:11:14] king's sword and positionally placed him
[1:11:17] as a son of God. Now he was placed in
[1:11:21] his position as that Elijah to open six
[1:11:24] seals because Christ is the seventh seal
[1:11:28] that was sea inside of him because he
[1:11:31] was sent with a message to introduce
[1:11:32] Elijah.
[1:11:34] So not only did he operate as Moses to
[1:11:36] bring the people out but he got the
[1:11:38] Joshua commission with the hand of God.
[1:11:41] Open the Bible and point from Joshua 1
[1:11:42] to9
[1:11:45] August the 7th 1957
[1:11:50] and God reconfirmed that to him the 20th
[1:11:52] of September
[1:11:54] 1965. So William Brham had the Joshua
[1:11:57] commission. A lot of people get mixed up
[1:11:59] with that because looking for a physical
[1:12:00] man to come and say let me go work the
[1:12:02] land.
[1:12:04] But your father what that's all about.
[1:12:07] God couldn't give you spirit when you
[1:12:09] have no seed word. If God give you a
[1:12:11] spirit without seed, you end up by
[1:12:13] Pentecostals speaking on the chandelier,
[1:12:15] speaking in tongues and going nowhere.
[1:12:19] Dynamics struck the Pentecostals. They
[1:12:22] had signs, wonders, they still do.
[1:12:24] Miracles, speaking in tongues and
[1:12:26] whatnot, but no character. So there was
[1:12:28] no adoption.
[1:12:30] So all they hear is scandal after
[1:12:32] scandal after scandal with those pastors
[1:12:34] because there was no life. So God said,
[1:12:36] "I'm going to reboot. I'm going to put
[1:12:37] my word in the people and use my word in
[1:12:40] them."
[1:12:44] And the word comes to a prophet. So when
[1:12:47] they reject the prophet, they reject the
[1:12:49] word. And the word is the channel of the
[1:12:51] spirit.
[1:12:55] The word is the conductor of the spirit.
[1:12:57] So if you want to see the spirit flow,
[1:12:59] put the word
[1:12:59] [Applause]
[1:13:02] in. Because in this season and time, God
[1:13:05] is using his own word. That is why the
[1:13:08] bride cannot
[1:13:09] [Applause]
[1:13:12] fail. Did you get that? Did you get
[1:13:15] that? This bride will not be like
[1:13:18] [Applause]
[1:13:23] [Music]
[1:13:26] Eve. Eve, you said sit down a minute,
[1:13:29] please. Eve was supposed to stay behind
[1:13:31] the word and she came off from the word
[1:13:34] and the devil knocked her down. But
[1:13:36] despite will be the word.
[1:13:38] No false prophet, no false teacher, no
[1:13:41] false whatever could throw her off the
[1:13:43] word because God sent a prophet and
[1:13:48] a seven angel messenger. Hallelujah. who
[1:13:52] who went up in the in in in the mind of
[1:13:54] God and brought down the mystery of God
[1:13:57] as the word of God and reveal all the
[1:13:59] promises of God. So we were here to
[1:14:02] preach promises to you. I'm not here yet
[1:14:05] to preach my dream. I'm here to bring
[1:14:07] promises to shake your flesh up, to
[1:14:10] shake your spirit up, to rock your soul
[1:14:14] to the very word of God.
[1:14:18] [Applause]
[1:14:21] I didn't make the promise. God made the
[1:14:24] promise. And if God made a promise, he's
[1:14:27] able to keep it. You may be seated.
[1:14:29] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:14:32] Placing a son, take him out to a certain
[1:14:35] place, have a ceremony before angels,
[1:14:38] place him positionally what he is in the
[1:14:40] body of Christ, then that person has the
[1:14:45] authority.
[1:14:46] Let me say this.
[1:14:48] If you count me for a fanatic from this
[1:14:50] night on, that very same thing that I'm
[1:14:55] speaking of will be done. Amen. There
[1:14:59] will be a power put into the church. And
[1:15:04] now it's coming in that the Holy Spirit
[1:15:08] will so anoint the people
[1:15:11] will speak the word and it will create
[1:15:14] itself right there. We haven't seen
[1:15:17] power coming in the church. Now I know
[1:15:20] it for a fact. Say it to this mountain.
[1:15:22] Be moving. No doubt in your heart. You
[1:15:24] can have it what you says. The placing
[1:15:27] of the church in position.
[1:15:30] Are you ready? Where the
[1:15:32] fullness of the Holy Ghost or the power
[1:15:35] of Holy Ghost comes into the church then
[1:15:37] the criticism will be shut. It will be a
[1:15:39] short time. Jesus come right off the
[1:15:42] mountain and went straight to Calvary.
[1:15:45] So the critic's mouth will be only shut
[1:15:48] by power,
[1:15:51] not by quotes.
[1:15:54] So let them pray.
[1:15:57] Hallelujah. But we have a promise on
[1:16:00] page 304. Wait till them seven thunders
[1:16:05] utter their voices to that group that
[1:16:08] could take the
[1:16:10] word. Hand it there.
[1:16:13] Oh, hallelujah. They could face and cut,
[1:16:16] not talk and talk. Fice and cut. Shut
[1:16:20] the heavens. Open the heavens. Do
[1:16:23] whatever you want to do. We want a
[1:16:25] revival today. We going to have it.
[1:16:28] That's what we talking
[1:16:30] about. Whatever you want to do. Old
[1:16:33] fashion, sin killing, demon chasing,
[1:16:38] Holy Ghost revival.
[1:16:42] Hallelujah. Oh
[1:16:44] glory.
[1:16:47] Hallelujah.
[1:16:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:16:51] Oh, give the Lord some praises,
[1:16:53] [Applause]
[1:16:59] people. You be seated. So, Brother
[1:17:02] Abraham came from 1963 to 65 with a
[1:17:06] seven seal, seven thunder prophecy
[1:17:08] message. Amen. He had three pulls. First
[1:17:11] pull, second pull. But the third pull
[1:17:15] was to catch that bride.
[1:17:18] Hallelujah. Other people got fed with
[1:17:20] the first two pull. But that third pull
[1:17:22] was the opening of the word which is
[1:17:25] every written and hidden mystery. He was
[1:17:28] to reveal every mystery. So no man can't
[1:17:30] come now and say revealing a mystery the
[1:17:32] prophet didn't reveal. That is
[1:17:34] foolishness. That not working with the
[1:17:36] bride. That could work with church
[1:17:38] members. who have eaten ears for new
[1:17:41] stuff, but that ain't working with the
[1:17:43] bride. That rugged gutsy bride who's
[1:17:46] standing on the words of Malachi 4.
[1:17:49] Every mystery has been
[1:17:53] revealed. Hallelujah. You know what
[1:17:55] you're called for. You're called to be a
[1:17:57] partaker of his divine nature. I always
[1:18:01] believe any man that got the key to
[1:18:04] unlock the pyramid, that's the key to
[1:18:06] the rapture. because he said
[1:18:08] this is the message that ties the man
[1:18:13] that's going to be redeemed. Hallelujah.
[1:18:15] That's the message. The perfect man
[1:18:17] message. How to get in the pyramid. Not
[1:18:20] how to get into church. You could walk
[1:18:22] upstairs here and sit here. That's easy.
[1:18:24] But that pyramid
[1:18:26] press, the kingdom of God is preached
[1:18:30] and every man press. Say press. Say it
[1:18:33] again. Say press. Every man got to
[1:18:36] press. Oh give the Lord a
[1:18:39] shout in
[1:18:40] [Applause]
[1:18:44] the be seated. The prophet say the hawk
[1:18:48] used to be brother to the eagle. He
[1:18:51] wants you to fly and soar but the hawk
[1:18:55] get so lazy. He'll sit on telephone pole
[1:18:59] waiting for cat and knock down rabbit
[1:19:01] and knock down dog and knock down this
[1:19:04] and knock down that. He once used to fly
[1:19:07] and hunt for his food. They're so lazy.
[1:19:10] The guy can make a prayer meeting.
[1:19:12] They're so lazy. They can't pass 10
[1:19:15] minutes of prayer. They're lazy. That's
[1:19:18] the hulk. But the eagle is still a
[1:19:21] eagle. He does hunt. He does fly. He
[1:19:25] does rip. He just steer. He just go
[1:19:28] where he want to go. No ministers
[1:19:31] association stopping him. Oh, glory to
[1:19:34] God. I feel like flying this morning.
[1:19:37] Oh, glory to God. Lord, lift me up where
[1:19:40] I belong.
[1:19:42] [Applause]
[1:19:47] [Music]
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:19:54] These brothers that I met, they get
[1:19:57] pressure from their circle for coming
[1:19:59] among us and we getting blows for going
[1:20:02] by them. But who cares? As long as God
[1:20:07] get glory and honor, that's all I can
[1:20:10] and led by the spirit of God. I will go
[1:20:12] wherever the spirit lead me. I will go
[1:20:14] wherever. Six seal, no seal, half seal,
[1:20:17] quarter seal, Baptist, Methodist, if a
[1:20:19] Pentecostal church inviting, I'm going.
[1:20:22] I'll preach to the Pope. I'll preach to
[1:20:24] Obama. I'll preach anywhere, anytime.
[1:20:27] I'm standing on a rock, a rock of
[1:20:30] revelation. Paul is with me. I is with
[1:20:34] me. Columbus
[1:20:36] Luther. Oh, glory to God.
[1:20:42] [Applause]
[1:20:49] Glory to God. Amen.
[1:20:52] You may be seated. I'm not an ambassador
[1:20:54] of man. Ambassador of the throne.
[1:20:58] Hallelujah. Man didn't call me. Man
[1:21:01] didn't anoint me. They can't unanoint
[1:21:03] me. They got uncall me. They can't de
[1:21:06] minister me. They can't delist me.
[1:21:09] That's foolishness. Hallelujah. All who
[1:21:12] he found you, he called. Hallelujah.
[1:21:16] Praise God. Hallelujah. There no man,
[1:21:19] there no song leader become pastor
[1:21:21] because the preacher fall you know. This
[1:21:22] is not that you know.
[1:21:26] This no deacon came pastor because the
[1:21:28] pastor backslide. This is not that you
[1:21:29] know. No no no. This is not that at all.
[1:21:32] Oh hallelujah. The devil is in trouble.
[1:21:36] He lost this battle. Brother, we know
[1:21:39] where we come from. We know where we
[1:21:41] going. We know God have a purpose for
[1:21:43] our
[1:21:44] lives. And that purpose for our life,
[1:21:47] the devil can upset, interrupt, it's got
[1:21:49] to be
[1:21:50] [Applause]
[1:21:56] fulfilled. You may be seated. Amen.
[1:22:01] Amen. So after brother Bham give his
[1:22:04] prophecy 6365 76 something under the
[1:22:07] prophecy cuz when he preached think
[1:22:09] Christ the mission of God revealed we
[1:22:11] thought the third pull was on he said
[1:22:13] look at the clock it's 2 p.m. Second
[1:22:15] pull finish. Third pull at hand because
[1:22:18] Christ was going to come to unveil the
[1:22:20] unveiling of the mighty God which is a
[1:22:22] hidden mystery where God will begin to
[1:22:24] unveil stuff. Who is Melzdc? Said that
[1:22:27] big mysteries the future home of the
[1:22:28] bride and groom. Said mysteries go start
[1:22:30] to reveal and unfold soon as God take
[1:22:32] the prophet off the scene. Confusion
[1:22:35] interpretation men stepping forward.
[1:22:39] Who say there's eight messenger, seven
[1:22:41] and a half
[1:22:42] messenger. Yeah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:22:47] Finish yet. He didn't finish Joshua
[1:22:49] commission. Sometime
[1:22:51] Joshua kind of idea.
[1:22:58] Hallelujah.
[1:22:59] So was commissioned to take us into the
[1:23:01] land. Yes. Isn't that right? Which is
[1:23:04] the Holy Ghost in word form. Amen.
[1:23:12] And he did. Yes. Amen. Isn't that right?
[1:23:16] So Joshua is the Holy Ghost that was
[1:23:19] veiling that prophet. Isn't that right?
[1:23:22] So Joshua, the Holy Ghost spoke spirit
[1:23:24] spoken words came out the prophet mouth
[1:23:27] and put it on books and tapes. Isn't
[1:23:29] that right? The land already divided on
[1:23:32] books and tapes. He said rapture in
[1:23:34] faith is laying in the messages. It is
[1:23:35] right there. All you have need of inside
[1:23:37] of there. It just wait for somebody to
[1:23:38] anoint them to pull it out. Pull it out.
[1:23:41] Pull it out. And that brings us to that
[1:23:43] little inspiration. Possessing your
[1:23:46] individual
[1:23:48] inheritance. You see, we like to know
[1:23:50] the group doing this and the church
[1:23:51] doing this. But look at Caleb. Caleb
[1:23:55] after they cross the land. Three things.
[1:23:57] Cross the land, conquer the land, and
[1:24:00] then divide the land. You must conquer
[1:24:02] the land. Amen. You can't have land and
[1:24:04] you're trying to plant and then the
[1:24:05] enemy pelting bone arrow at you. That
[1:24:08] that can't work. You have to conquer
[1:24:09] that. Isn't that right? So after they do
[1:24:11] the conquering, Caleb come up to Joshua.
[1:24:14] Joshua, you you know what Moses spoke
[1:24:16] concerning me and you? Yes.
[1:24:19] 40 years longer and half all them
[1:24:21] brothers die out. Hallelujah.
[1:24:24] I want you to know I asking for help.
[1:24:26] Amen.
[1:24:28] Because I just as strong as when I first
[1:24:30] started.
[1:24:32] You're not hearing me. You're not
[1:24:34] hearing me. I ain't asking for bishop
[1:24:37] prayer and elder prayer and deacon
[1:24:39] prayer. He said, "I'm just as strong.
[1:24:41] And if the Lord be with me, I'm not
[1:24:44] hearing it this morning." Oh, give the
[1:24:46] Lord a scream. Give the Lord a shout in
[1:24:49] the
[1:24:50] [Applause]
[1:24:55] house. I know some of you tired. Not
[1:24:58] physically, but mentally and emotionally
[1:25:01] and spiritually. I feel tired and where
[1:25:03] is a long journey. I mean, going along
[1:25:05] since 1975, looking for all these
[1:25:07] promises to become a reality. Amen. This
[1:25:09] is 40 plus years. Oh, but I'm just as
[1:25:12] strong as when I I first started off. My
[1:25:15] God. I started a long time ago, but I'm
[1:25:17] just as strong. Every place I put my
[1:25:19] foot. Every place I feel like stamping
[1:25:21] tonight. I feel like jumping. Every
[1:25:23] place I put my foot is I put my foot on
[1:25:25] signs and wonders. Put my foot in the
[1:25:27] power of God. Put my foot on miracles.
[1:25:30] Hallelujah. Every place you put your
[1:25:32] footage on.
[1:25:39] Maybe season notice. Hallelujah. What
[1:25:42] Caleb said, um Joshua, you think, excuse
[1:25:45] me, um you think I could get my
[1:25:48] mountain. You think looking around, oh
[1:25:51] gosh, I bet they say nothing because
[1:25:52] nobody asking for it.
[1:25:55] You don't know if the rest of them back.
[1:25:58] You you you don't know if them have no
[1:26:00] faith whatsoever because it take faith
[1:26:02] to take the sword. It take faith to make
[1:26:03] a claim. It take faith to climb up the
[1:26:05] mountain. All things that you're going
[1:26:07] to get is by faith. You can't sit and
[1:26:09] expect faith to come on your lap. You
[1:26:11] got to do something. He said, "Give me
[1:26:13] my mountain."
[1:26:16] No. No. Therefore, give me my mountain.
[1:26:20] He said, "Take
[1:26:22] it." Bible said he expelled the sons of
[1:26:25] Anoch.
[1:26:27] Oh, glory. Give the Lord a shout in the
[1:26:30] house. Caleb kicked them out.
[1:26:38] We got some expelling to do.
[1:26:45] My God, we transitioning, you know. We
[1:26:48] changing over from natural to
[1:26:50] supernatural. From normal to
[1:26:52] supernormal. Hallelujah. That's what
[1:26:54] signs and what will be normal to you.
[1:26:56] Praying for the sick is normal to you.
[1:26:58] You don't care what condition they're
[1:27:00] in. It doesn't matter. You didn't make
[1:27:01] the promise. God did.
[1:27:03] You are part of God. You are part of
[1:27:06] him. You are part of Elohim. Oh, glory
[1:27:09] to God. You are part of him. Oh,
[1:27:12] hallelujah. Praise God. And Jesus said,
[1:27:14] "The same works I do.
[1:27:19] Shall you do also shall you do?" Oh,
[1:27:23] glory to God. Hallelujah. He healed the
[1:27:25] sick. We healed the sick. He raised the
[1:27:28] dead. We raised the dead. He cast out
[1:27:31] devils. He cast out devils. He confront
[1:27:34] the Pharisees. He confront the
[1:27:36] Pharisees. Oh, glory to God. He
[1:27:38] overcome. He overcome. Same works he
[1:27:41] did, we going to do also. How many
[1:27:43] believe that? How many receive that? Oh,
[1:27:46] glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:48] Praise God. Blessed be the name of the
[1:27:51] Lord. So, praise God.
[1:27:55] Question.
[1:27:56] Who divided the land in the upper room?
[1:28:01] Which one of the brethren,
[1:28:03] which one of the fellow ministers
[1:28:06] came down and said, "Brethren, you know
[1:28:08] I am the man. I am the one.
[1:28:12] I am coming to break that bread to you."
[1:28:16] Holy Ghost.
[1:28:18] Solomon.
[1:28:20] Jesus.
[1:28:21] Open the understanding of the scripture.
[1:28:24] Solomon Jesus. Amen. Breathe upon them.
[1:28:28] Receive you the Holy Ghost. Son of man,
[1:28:31] Jesus, he said, "Behold, I send the
[1:28:34] promise of my father upon you, but tar
[1:28:36] in the seat of Jerusalem until Joshua
[1:28:38] come from on high."
[1:28:43] We give the Lord a shout.
[1:28:45] Hallelujah.
[1:28:47] So in that context, Jesus as Solomon was
[1:28:51] Moses ministry bringing him up to the
[1:28:54] promised land. He said, "If I don't go,
[1:28:57] comforter will not come. I am going.
[1:29:00] That spirit will come. I am going. That
[1:29:03] comforter will come. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:29:06] Said don't go Jesus. You have got to go
[1:29:08] because what you got can't take you
[1:29:10] through. You need power. Power in your
[1:29:13] life, power in prayer, power in your
[1:29:16] soul, power in your spirit, power in
[1:29:20] your
[1:29:20] [Applause]
[1:29:22] body. Do I hear shout in the
[1:29:25] house? Listen.
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:35] Listen. That Matthew 10 temporary power
[1:29:39] that Peter had when they come in know
[1:29:41] Peter draw sword and and take out
[1:29:43] manairs.
[1:29:45] Get courage to cut off a man ears. Peter
[1:29:46] doing sword play. Jesus had to take out
[1:29:49] the man ears and put it back on. Instant
[1:29:52] surgery.
[1:29:54] instant restoration of a man air who
[1:29:56] wasn't a believer or a saint.
[1:30:00] But Peter had no right taking off the
[1:30:02] man air and Jesus corrected it. Bam.
[1:30:07] Say
[1:30:08] God could instantly heal her air. What
[1:30:12] about your kidneys? What about diabetes?
[1:30:13] What about uritis? What about cancer?
[1:30:16] What about tumor? What about sickness in
[1:30:18] your
[1:30:22] I'm not hearing a good amen for that
[1:30:24] one.
[1:30:30] That one disease and more coming. You
[1:30:31] know you think you're finished with Zika
[1:30:33] is more coming say we are striving to
[1:30:37] enter the kingdom of God before these
[1:30:41] plagues strike. So the plagues are
[1:30:44] coming and sons of God coming and
[1:30:47] someday we going to confront plagues
[1:30:49] versus sons of God and they're going to
[1:30:51] back up cancer. They're going to push
[1:30:53] back to they're going to push back the
[1:30:55] plague sons of
[1:30:57] God. That's what the creation is growing
[1:31:00] [Applause]
[1:31:04] for. Hallelujah.
[1:31:08] The creation is not growing for more
[1:31:09] mysteries.
[1:31:13] more teachings,
[1:31:15] more unfoldings of revelations.
[1:31:17] [Applause]
[1:31:19] We had that
[1:31:21] for 50 years.
[1:31:26] But the creation is grown in four
[1:31:29] is the manifestation
[1:31:31] of the sons of God. When God's sons come
[1:31:34] and take back from the devil,
[1:31:37] what he took from
[1:31:39] us, that is what the creation is
[1:31:42] drowning for. Oh, hallelujah. We going
[1:31:46] back. We going back. We getting back. My
[1:31:51] God. I preached a message across the
[1:31:53] restitution of all things.
[1:31:55] And I was convinced after that message,
[1:31:58] God will restore all things. Because the
[1:32:00] Bible said, why say the scribe, Elias
[1:32:03] must first come and restore all things.
[1:32:05] Hallelujah. Amen. He said, Elas must
[1:32:07] first truly come and restore all things.
[1:32:09] All things must be restored. Jesus is up
[1:32:13] there whom the heaven must receive until
[1:32:15] the restitution of all things. Jesus had
[1:32:18] to stay up there until everything is
[1:32:19] restored. Perfect church, season church,
[1:32:22] Holy Ghost church, fil church, anointed
[1:32:26] church. God can't go back to the Jews
[1:32:28] until the Gentiles is baptized with
[1:32:31] fire. Them Jews have to wait. Those Jews
[1:32:35] have to wait. You not hearing what I'm
[1:32:37] saying?
[1:32:39] [Applause]
[1:32:45] Israel has got time peace but God have a
[1:32:47] bright peace among the Gentiles that
[1:32:51] have to be sealed with Christ.
[1:32:53] Amen. When God finished with this bride
[1:32:56] then he took across to the Jews. Oh
[1:32:58] hallelujah.
[1:33:00] Glory to God.
[1:33:02] Brother Brandham
[1:33:05] in
[1:33:05] paradox. Hear what he's saying here.
[1:33:09] Amen. years ago when I seen the Bible
[1:33:13] come down. I got it wrote here. Come
[1:33:14] down and a hand came from heaven and
[1:33:17] pointed down to Joshua. Read the first
[1:33:20] nine verses and stopped there. That is
[1:33:23] Joshua when he near Jordan. God called
[1:33:25] him out and said, "This day I'll begin
[1:33:28] to magnify you before the people." Then
[1:33:30] he took the children across Jordan to
[1:33:31] the land and divided to them the
[1:33:35] promised land. Let's go a little
[1:33:37] further. Amen. Now you see what coming
[1:33:39] to the Jordan meant. We are down here
[1:33:41] now. All right. Let's cross over. Let's
[1:33:45] quit playing. Hallelujah. Let's cross
[1:33:47] the other side now cuz it all belongs to
[1:33:50] us. Amen. It's all ours. Them visions
[1:33:54] have never failed. They can't fail
[1:33:57] because they come from God. I believe it
[1:34:00] with all that is within me. We are not
[1:34:02] the Harland that will run back to the
[1:34:04] wilderness. We we will cross Jordan.
[1:34:06] Hallelujah. We will cross Jordan. We
[1:34:09] will cross Jordan. You want to hear a
[1:34:11] bigger amen than that? Your promise is
[1:34:14] not before Jordan. Your promise is
[1:34:16] across Jordan. Then hear the prophet,
[1:34:19] God, break to us the seals on the back
[1:34:23] of the book. Amen. Let us enter into
[1:34:27] this great place now for Joshua divided
[1:34:33] to the people the inheritance that God
[1:34:35] left for him. So he put the seven
[1:34:38] thunders which is on the back of the
[1:34:40] book as the land of promise to be
[1:34:43] divided he said we're going to cross
[1:34:47] take us back there that we could see our
[1:34:50] inheritance. So when the lamb took the
[1:34:52] broke the seventh seal, there was
[1:34:55] silence. The devil don't have a clue
[1:34:58] what's happening there. But seven
[1:35:01] thunder was banging. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.
[1:35:06] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:35:09] Hallelujah. On the death is where your
[1:35:12] inheritance lay. Oh, blessed be the name
[1:35:15] of the Lord. Now watch this land of
[1:35:17] promise. Yes. He said now one stage
[1:35:20] leaving Egypt, next stage wilderness,
[1:35:23] third stage Canaan. Now Canaan does not
[1:35:25] represent the age of the millennium. It
[1:35:28] represent the age of the overcomer.
[1:35:29] Amen. Because in Canaan they killed,
[1:35:31] burned, took cities. There be no debt in
[1:35:34] the millennium. Now what is the land of
[1:35:36] promise to the New Testament believer?
[1:35:38] The promise is the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:35:40] For it shall come to pass in the last
[1:35:42] days. Joel 2:28, I'll pour out my
[1:35:45] spirit. Isn't that right? Amen. That is
[1:35:48] the promise. The promise is the baptism
[1:35:51] of the spirit which is promised in all
[1:35:53] the old testament and new too. That is
[1:35:56] the promise. Here we go. The promised
[1:35:58] land is to live in this land of the holy
[1:36:02] spirit.
[1:36:04] So, so you could give up jealousy, envy,
[1:36:07] malice, strife. You could lay down
[1:36:10] anger. You could lay down lust. You
[1:36:12] could do it. God put that built inside
[1:36:14] of you. But you got to give up. You got
[1:36:17] to lay it down. Yeah. You got to want to
[1:36:20] be coached. I was telling somebody all
[1:36:22] those athletes have to be coached. You
[1:36:25] got yourself feeling feeling led to
[1:36:27] move. So
[1:36:29] you feeling led to not even reach the
[1:36:31] Olympics. That's right.
[1:36:38] Because you had to be able to take
[1:36:39] discipline.
[1:36:41] That's why disciple come from a
[1:36:42] disciplined one. Amen.
[1:36:46] One that could be corrected, instructed,
[1:36:49] directed, guided. Not a bullhead.
[1:36:52] Amen. No, no, no. Bullet spirit not of
[1:36:54] God. Hallelujah. Not arrogance. Arrogant
[1:36:57] spirit not of God. You guarantee
[1:36:58] arrogance not of God. Somebody humble
[1:37:01] willing because there's always more to
[1:37:03] learn.
[1:37:08] You can't say old because Eli was old.
[1:37:12] That's right. And he was blind to what
[1:37:14] his sons was doing. Isn't that right?
[1:37:17] And God raised up little Samuel to bring
[1:37:20] Samuel forward to bust the whole thing.
[1:37:23] God will use anybody, you know. Amen. Oh
[1:37:25] yes. He could find a young life and he
[1:37:27] going to use them. Praise God. So this
[1:37:29] promised land is the land of the Holy
[1:37:32] Spirit. That's God promised for the
[1:37:33] church is to live in the power of the
[1:37:35] spirit. It's another world. It's another
[1:37:37] land. You have to come out of the
[1:37:38] conditions you've been in to come out
[1:37:40] and live in this promised land to
[1:37:42] receive the promise. Remember that you
[1:37:43] shall receive promise from on high after
[1:37:45] the Holy Ghost has come upon you. Okay.
[1:37:49] From paradox we
[1:37:51] continue. Don't you see in shadows? Stop
[1:37:53] you a minute. There's got to be a place
[1:37:56] prepared for the word to be made
[1:37:58] manifest. Amen. And we are now living by
[1:38:02] the evidence of the new land. Amen. The
[1:38:05] son of man. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:38:08] Glory.
[1:38:09] So in other words, Malachi 4, that
[1:38:13] Elijah prophet could only open six
[1:38:16] seals. Christ, the son of man is the
[1:38:20] seventh seal. But you see, you see if
[1:38:23] brother Brandham and Christ, if there
[1:38:25] was a different man, a physical to say,
[1:38:28] well, this is Christ here, it might have
[1:38:30] be easier. But you see, he veiled the
[1:38:32] son of man. He was a son of man
[1:38:36] revealing the son of son of man. So he
[1:38:39] said we are living now by the evidence
[1:38:42] of the new land. The son of man. We are
[1:38:45] still living by the evidence.
[1:38:47] [Applause]
[1:38:50] The son of man was the evidence of the
[1:38:52] new land. Every mystery being revealed,
[1:38:55] we are living by it. Every promise being
[1:38:58] spoken, we are living by it. every
[1:39:01] promise being
[1:39:03] spoken and by these promises these
[1:39:06] precious revealed promises not just
[1:39:10] promises but revealed.
[1:39:13] Oh hallelujah. Every mystery has been
[1:39:15] revealed. Oh glory. Now we can be
[1:39:18] partakers of his divine nature. Oh glory
[1:39:21] to God. So now I believe it's time to
[1:39:24] take the land. Yes sir. Not just say his
[1:39:26] promises. It revealed this land is my
[1:39:28] land and that's land. No, no, no. Like
[1:39:30] like Caleb right now. There's Hebron.
[1:39:32] Hebron, you have to possess it now. You
[1:39:33] have to get aggressive. Hallelujah. You
[1:39:36] have to get militant and aggressive to
[1:39:38] possess your land, not to fight other
[1:39:40] brethren. That's foolishness. That them
[1:39:42] can't take your land. They taking away
[1:39:43] your time. They taking away your
[1:39:45] thoughts and your mind. So you don't go
[1:39:47] in a church war. Forget that. That that
[1:39:49] will take up too much of your time. You
[1:39:51] want land war.
[1:39:53] [Applause]
[1:39:54] Your battle is with your Philistines.
[1:39:57] You're battling with your personal
[1:39:59] demons. Come on, give the Lord a shout
[1:40:01] in the house. I'm about to get started.
[1:40:03] I'm a feeling I'm about to get started.
[1:40:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:40:08] You're battling with this brother and
[1:40:10] this sister and this one and that one.
[1:40:11] If your battle is that, you in trouble
[1:40:13] cuz you in flesh, flesh, and blood. You
[1:40:15] don't like me. She don't shake my hand.
[1:40:16] This one say this, this one do that.
[1:40:18] This one do that. And you in a natural
[1:40:20] battle.
[1:40:22] And when the devil see that, he say,
[1:40:24] "Good, good. Keep it. Keep it up. Keep
[1:40:26] it up. I'm supporting you in that. Keep
[1:40:28] it. Keep it going. This one fighting
[1:40:30] this one. This one training with this
[1:40:32] one. And javelin belt in here.
[1:40:36] David duck in here.
[1:40:41] David still
[1:40:45] come. Still deep with the javelin throw.
[1:40:47] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Oh, you
[1:40:50] talking about a Christian spirit. You
[1:40:51] have to have it.
[1:40:53] Come on now. Come on now. I want to hear
[1:40:55] bigger. Amen.
[1:40:59] Glory. Glory. From world fall apart. God
[1:41:03] is obligated to meet you on the basis of
[1:41:07] them promises.
[1:41:09] Outside of them promises. He can't meet
[1:41:12] you because you don't cut yourself off
[1:41:15] from him. God is obligated to meet you
[1:41:19] on the basis of them promises. So when
[1:41:22] you see them brothers start to pray the
[1:41:24] God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob who
[1:41:27] promised to bring us out and you said
[1:41:29] thy seed shall possess the
[1:41:33] G. Let them start to praise to heaven
[1:41:36] the shake because they cannot be
[1:41:40] [Applause]
[1:41:41] denied. Your blessings could be delayed
[1:41:44] but they cannot be denied.
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:50] Give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:41:54] [Applause]
[1:42:00] I read that one again. God is obligated
[1:42:01] to meet you on the basis of them
[1:42:03] promises outside them promises he can't
[1:42:06] meet you because you don't cut yourself
[1:42:09] off. Isn't that right? So therefore
[1:42:12] until you speak it only when you speak
[1:42:14] it become a promise. If it just leave
[1:42:17] right there it's just a thought of God.
[1:42:19] But when it's spoken, it's the word of
[1:42:20] God. Isn't that right? As long as it's
[1:42:23] not spoken is a thought. So you want to
[1:42:26] be healed and you see say nothing but
[1:42:27] you want to be healed. You ain't
[1:42:29] claiming nothing. You are to say I'm
[1:42:31] going to be healed by the fact I was
[1:42:32] healed. Healing his mind. Now the devil
[1:42:35] in trouble cuz your face had to light up
[1:42:38] and your face had to roll back the
[1:42:39] sickness. The tumors had to try to
[1:42:41] shrink. The virus had to shrink in your
[1:42:43] body because you have to claim the
[1:42:45] anointing. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:42:51] Do you understand what we're talking
[1:42:52] about? A woman came up on the platform
[1:42:54] with no eyes.
[1:42:58] No eyes in a socket. Amen. Came up. All
[1:43:01] right. And Baron spoke for the eyes and
[1:43:05] a light come and begin to create the
[1:43:06] eyes amidst the middle of creation. He
[1:43:09] said, "I forget to ask you what color
[1:43:10] you wanted."
[1:43:12] What color you wanted?
[1:43:15] Oh, glory. Yeah, blue is a nice color.
[1:43:18] She hard. That's the God we talking
[1:43:20] about. He create new kidneys, pancreas,
[1:43:24] new
[1:43:26] womb, new
[1:43:29] jawbone, new
[1:43:31] backbone.
[1:43:32] Hallelujah. A new
[1:43:35] heart, new
[1:43:37] spirit. Come on. Yes. Yes. You could
[1:43:41] change. But you have to want to change.
[1:43:44] You have to see the need to change.
[1:43:48] [Applause]
[1:43:58] Oh hallelujah.
[1:44:02] So Jesus had to speak his words to the
[1:44:05] disciples. He had to give them a promise
[1:44:08] not many days hence. He had to tell them
[1:44:10] you shall receive power from on high. He
[1:44:12] had to unlock Joel 2:28. Amen. It shall
[1:44:15] come to pass, I'll pour my spirit. He
[1:44:17] had to unlock Isaiah 28 with stammer and
[1:44:20] another tongue. He had unlock the
[1:44:22] scriptures, the Old Testament to them.
[1:44:24] Isn't that right? And give them a
[1:44:26] positive vibes and a quickening to go in
[1:44:30] the upper room. Hallelujah. It wasn't
[1:44:31] easy. They were under pressure. Amen.
[1:44:34] They went up there and feared the Jews.
[1:44:36] They shut the doors. It wasn't easy
[1:44:39] waiting on a promise of God, but it was
[1:44:41] a promise of God. Man didn't make the
[1:44:44] promise. God made the promise. And if
[1:44:47] God made it, we could wait for it. If
[1:44:50] God made it, we could wait on it. I will
[1:44:55] wait till my change come. Oh, give the
[1:44:58] Lord a shout in the
[1:45:00] [Applause]
[1:45:02] house.
[1:45:04] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:45:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:45:09] Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So then
[1:45:12] they received the word first. My God.
[1:45:14] Then the spirit came. All right. And the
[1:45:16] son of man come. Yes. Seven seal took
[1:45:19] the written word. Took the promises of
[1:45:21] God. And these divine promises that
[1:45:24] ministers don't want to preach because
[1:45:26] they find it boring. They find it
[1:45:28] doesn't tell the story they want to
[1:45:30] tell. But these are spirit-given words.
[1:45:32] Yes. That's why the prophecy say what
[1:45:34] the tape say because them tapes have
[1:45:36] something in it. It's not he that say
[1:45:38] it. It's God that say it. The spirit the
[1:45:41] scripture is God breathed. Holy men
[1:45:44] moved by God. Man shall not by bread
[1:45:48] alone but by every word that proceed out
[1:45:51] of the mouth of God. And the mouth of
[1:45:53] God is his prophets. So when William
[1:45:55] Brandham spoke that was the mouth of God
[1:45:58] speaking spirit spoken word. Are you
[1:46:01] hearing what I'm saying? Therefore, the
[1:46:03] word has to come inside of you. That's
[1:46:06] what the minister was supposed to do.
[1:46:08] The secret is the
[1:46:11] word is in the bread. Oh, give the Lord
[1:46:14] a
[1:46:17] [Applause]
[1:46:20] shout. See, that's why that's why you
[1:46:24] could never understand how Jesus could
[1:46:26] find way to find this woman of the
[1:46:28] world. time find time to find out this
[1:46:30] woman and and go to look for this woman
[1:46:32] and wait for this woman. Oh, because got
[1:46:34] something inside of her that she doesn't
[1:46:36] know inside of her. She have a secret
[1:46:38] she doesn't even know. People seeing her
[1:46:40] flesh and her spirit and behavior and
[1:46:41] all that, but she has something deep on
[1:46:42] the inside that he want to unlock. He
[1:46:45] want to unravel and he did it and she
[1:46:48] went free. Oh God, let's God unlock you
[1:46:50] today. How many want to be unlocked? God
[1:46:52] unlock you. Whatever hinding you,
[1:46:55] whatever complex, whatever issues in
[1:46:57] your system, People are so much complex.
[1:47:00] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. I'm too
[1:47:02] tall. I too thin. I too fat. I too this
[1:47:05] p and my mother. I didn't have a good
[1:47:07] education and I can't write and I can't
[1:47:09] read and I can't speak and I I'm afraid
[1:47:10] and I'm too timid and this and that.
[1:47:12] Forget all of that. You are sons and
[1:47:14] daughters of God. God call you. God
[1:47:16] going to fix you just right. God going
[1:47:18] to rearrange your life. You don't have
[1:47:20] to be like nobody else. You want to be
[1:47:23] authentic. You want to be original you.
[1:47:26] God love you as you are. Would they like
[1:47:28] you to be somebody else? God love you.
[1:47:30] That's why he called you. He chose you.
[1:47:33] He said, "You have not chosen me, but I
[1:47:34] have chosen you. I have ordained you to
[1:47:36] bring forth fruit.
[1:47:44] [Applause]
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:48:01] Hallelujah.
[1:48:02] Hallelujah.
[1:48:04] So, how could God send dynamics on me in
[1:48:07] 1975 when I wasn't even married yet?
[1:48:11] And my sons locked up inside of me. They
[1:48:14] are seeds of God. They have to comfort
[1:48:16] in their season. Amen.
[1:48:20] So if I say Lord, Lord, rapture me now.
[1:48:24] Go to Gideon Andrea.
[1:48:32] Hallelujah.
[1:48:35] Praise God. Amen. Now,
[1:48:40] [Applause]
[1:48:42] Danielle, I I had to wait even more. I
[1:48:46] had to pray more.
[1:48:48] Oh my. Every name on that book going to
[1:48:52] be expressed. Hallelujah. Hear the
[1:48:54] shaka. All the ages are already taken
[1:48:57] up.
[1:48:58] The life already suck up its people. We
[1:49:01] can't go back.
[1:49:03] Ahead is tribulation or rapture.
[1:49:10] [Applause]
[1:49:11] Could I have a bigger amen than that?
[1:49:16] You could keep all the car, all the
[1:49:17] land, all the money. You could buy
[1:49:20] plane, hotel, spacecraft.
[1:49:23] Airship. You can go out of space and
[1:49:25] wait for a while. You're still coming
[1:49:26] now. Heaven going to burn with a fervent
[1:49:29] heat. All the atmosphere going to burn.
[1:49:33] Fire, fire, fire.
[1:49:35] Oh, glory to God. But there's going to
[1:49:37] be a rapture. We shall not all sleep,
[1:49:41] but we shall be changed. In a moment, in
[1:49:44] the twinkle of an eye, at the last
[1:49:46] trumpet, the trumpet of the Lord shall
[1:49:48] [Applause]
[1:49:51] sound. Oh, and this mortal will put on
[1:49:56] immortality. Oh, and this corruption
[1:49:58] going to put on
[1:50:00] [Applause]
[1:50:03] interruption.
[1:50:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:50:08] Oh, give the Lord a
[1:50:10] shout. We are getting out of here.
[1:50:16] [Applause]
[1:50:21] So the same prophet this Malachi 4
[1:50:25] prophet prophesy the ministry of the
[1:50:28] spirit. Amen. To come to quicken the
[1:50:30] word to you. Amen. Because he said
[1:50:32] intellectually we hear in the message he
[1:50:34] knew all things of of in prophecy. He
[1:50:37] prophesied intellectually where you're
[1:50:39] hearing the message but it has to come
[1:50:41] tender and bay down in your heart. It
[1:50:44] has to come up head to heart where the
[1:50:46] message start of ooze inside of you
[1:50:48] because that invisible God want to
[1:50:50] become visible. This is what it's all
[1:50:52] about. Isn't that right? So therefore
[1:50:55] this capstone spirit have to come to a
[1:50:58] capstone word. So God put that word
[1:51:01] inside of you. Isn't that right? So
[1:51:04] Malachi come to restore back the faith.
[1:51:08] The virtue the knowledge that he come to
[1:51:10] resto back all them virtues. That is
[1:51:12] what the holy church had. They had seven
[1:51:15] virtues that was thundering out that the
[1:51:18] devil couldn't handle. People were
[1:51:21] healed Peter's shadow because the image
[1:51:23] of God was standing in Peter. Oh
[1:51:27] hallelujah.
[1:51:28] When you come under Peter's shadow, he
[1:51:30] was healed. The power was so much in
[1:51:32] Paul. That when they touch clo garments
[1:51:36] was anointed. That when they take that
[1:51:39] the people were healed. Everything you
[1:51:41] touch whatever you touch your hands
[1:51:44] anointed. Your foot anointed the words
[1:51:48] anointed.
[1:51:50] anointed with God.
[1:51:53] [Applause]
[1:52:02] Brother, he say if God give a duck, come
[1:52:06] on, enough sense to know how to dodge
[1:52:09] the coldness, how ought he have to give
[1:52:12] the church. If a duck can do that by
[1:52:14] instinct, what about the Holy Ghost in
[1:52:17] the church? It ought to bring us out of
[1:52:21] old formalities and creeds into a
[1:52:24] glorious,
[1:52:25] wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost. It
[1:52:29] brings virtue, it brings knowledge, it
[1:52:32] brings patience, it brings godliness and
[1:52:35] the Holy Spirit and that was under the
[1:52:38] guide. So what the pre was saying from
[1:52:41] 1966, this guide of the Holy Ghost was
[1:52:45] supposed to lead the church into virtue
[1:52:49] and knowledge and temperance and
[1:52:52] patience. Whatever you preach, whatever
[1:52:54] you teach, it's supposed to bring you to
[1:52:57] godliness, to brotherly kindness, to
[1:53:00] charity that you could be a
[1:53:03] partaker of his divine nature.
[1:53:11] This thing going to live. It have to
[1:53:14] live. I want it. I want it to live in
[1:53:17] me. I want it to live through me. My
[1:53:20] wife have to see it. My children have to
[1:53:22] see it. You have to see it. I've got to
[1:53:25] see it. Others have to see it. The
[1:53:28] critics have to see it. The liars, they
[1:53:30] going to see it, too. The haters, they
[1:53:32] got to see it. Hallelujah. Everybody
[1:53:35] going to see it. It will speak for
[1:53:37] itself. But a Bible say he will let it
[1:53:40] be made known among men. You can't even
[1:53:42] hide it. The pillar of fire will hang
[1:53:45] over you and say, "Look here. This is my
[1:53:48] beloved son. Look another one here. You
[1:53:51] can't hide. Look at daughter of mine's
[1:53:53] here. Oh, give the Lord a shout. You
[1:53:56] can't hide. He's going to identify you."
[1:54:05] Oh, I'm not ashamed
[1:54:07] of the son of man. Know his words. Oh,
[1:54:11] glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:15] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:54:18] Hallelujah.
[1:54:20] Oh, glory to God. So, the dynamics
[1:54:23] descended as a shout in word form. My
[1:54:27] words are spirit and life. That's the
[1:54:29] secret. Amen. You know why the foolish
[1:54:31] virgins can't get the oil? They don't
[1:54:32] have the word in them. Because your oil
[1:54:35] is the word turned to spirit. Could you
[1:54:37] imagine you filled with oil right now in
[1:54:39] word form? Could you imagine you have a
[1:54:41] pyramid in you now in mechanic form and
[1:54:44] you walking with the rapture? Rapture is
[1:54:46] already inside of you. When people
[1:54:48] looking for thing outside here, low
[1:54:51] here, go here, go here. Here have the
[1:54:54] angel here to have the angel. Here is
[1:54:57] this and here is that. Jesus say,
[1:54:58] "Forget about it." The kingdom is within
[1:55:01] you. You've got to know where the
[1:55:02] kingdom is at. Come on, preach back to
[1:55:04] me, somebody. Oh, glory to God. That
[1:55:06] divine nature, faith, a power, virtue of
[1:55:10] power, knowledge. These are not natural
[1:55:11] things. It's not natural patience. It's
[1:55:13] not is the patience of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:15] It's the temperance of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:17] It's the faith of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:22] Are we preaching the word this
[1:55:25] morning? Amenise
[1:55:30] from such a perfect man Peter said
[1:55:33] because you have escaped the corruption
[1:55:35] that is the world through lust
[1:55:38] for money lust for big time lust for
[1:55:41] pleasure all right everything your eyes
[1:55:43] see you want somebody see something new
[1:55:46] and your eyes go your eye go twice the
[1:55:48] size cuz you wanted two
[1:55:54] small advice Live below your means.
[1:55:59] You don't hear that, right?
[1:56:02] You don't ever hear that. That's my
[1:56:05] moto.
[1:56:07] Okay. Simon Peter, a servant and a
[1:56:09] person of Jesus Christ. He read my
[1:56:11] script of grace multiplied to you and so
[1:56:13] whereby I give him exceeding great oh
[1:56:17] God and precious promises. Some people
[1:56:20] like gold. Some people like gold their
[1:56:21] eyes just blink. Gold, gold chain, gold
[1:56:24] ring, gold this, gold this, gold this.
[1:56:27] Some people like cars, every car. Some
[1:56:29] people like dress. Some like shoes.
[1:56:32] Shoes is flip them. If they give a
[1:56:34] chance, they have a thousand shoes.
[1:56:36] Have all kind of people like handbags.
[1:56:39] Sister side.
[1:56:42] On the brother's side. Some people like
[1:56:43] ties. I go there.
[1:56:48] But whatever it is, don't let that throw
[1:56:49] you off.
[1:56:51] [Music]
[1:56:54] Lust for money. There we go. Lust for
[1:56:57] big things. Amen. Lust for popularity.
[1:56:59] These things are dead to the believer.
[1:57:03] [Applause]
[1:57:04] How God can test a debt to you? He got
[1:57:06] to present it to you.
[1:57:08] Amen. So, so let the amen come.
[1:57:12] Amen.
[1:57:13] Amen. You got a big bag of money, but to
[1:57:15] break your principles, God see say,
[1:57:17] "Well,
[1:57:18] okay. Put put behind me first."
[1:57:23] No, you have to stand for the word. You
[1:57:27] have to stand for the what's right. You
[1:57:29] have to stand for what's principle.
[1:57:31] Because you see, it's not man you're
[1:57:32] looking to please. It's God's approval
[1:57:35] you're looking for.
[1:57:38] You need him when you have to pray for
[1:57:39] your children. Amen. You need him. When
[1:57:41] you're pay for a blessed husband, you
[1:57:43] need him.
[1:57:45] [Music]
[1:57:48] When you need your prayer answered, you
[1:57:50] need him. When you're on your sick bed,
[1:57:52] you need him.
[1:57:57] [Music]
[1:57:58] Listen to this. Lust for money, lust for
[1:58:01] big things, lust for popularity. These
[1:58:04] things are dead to the believer. We
[1:58:05] don't care. Tent or cottage, why should
[1:58:07] I care? Live or die, sink or drunk,
[1:58:10] tentage
[1:58:12] or cottage.

[1:58:18] cottage. You don't want to live in a
[1:58:20] tent. Place it into cottage. Small
[1:58:22] house, big house, square house, wrong
[1:58:24] house, in the attic. It doesn't matter.

[1:58:35] young son and daughter and thing and

[1:59:04] They have no bottom. And when I remember
[1:59:07] my sins going to the
[1:59:10] bottomless, I couldn't help but shout."
[1:59:14] When you have God in you, you will see
[1:59:16] God everywhere.
[1:59:20] [Applause]
[1:59:29] [Applause]
[1:59:32] Why should I care? Live or die. Sink or
[1:59:34] drown? This is the thing I'm interested
[1:59:37] in, the kingdom of God. Whether I
[1:59:40] maintain my home, whether I maintain my
[1:59:42] family, whether I maintain whatever it
[1:59:45] is, let me maintain Christ.
[1:59:48] So you can maintain your lawn in front
[1:59:50] of your house. That's good. I salute
[1:59:52] you. But pray this prayer. Make sure you
[1:59:56] maintain Christ.
[2:00:00] Your flowers perfect, the broom perfect,
[2:00:03] and this perfect, and that perfect, but
[2:00:05] make sure you maintain Christ. At the
[2:00:08] end of the day, it's Christ you would
[2:00:09] need.
[2:00:13] Feel like running through a troop this
[2:00:14] morning. Oh, glory to God. I catch him.
[2:00:18] Satan is trapped. Catch him. Oh,
[2:00:21] hallelujah. Oh, glory.
[2:00:25] Woo. Oh, glory to God. So, think about
[2:00:29] being purged. Yes. Yes. being tried,
[2:00:33] being tuned and and so on like that
[2:00:35] until the devil there's no nothing
[2:00:37] there's no there's nothing could you
[2:00:39] can't respond to his offers
[2:00:42] oh hallelujah a man he got touch oh hal
[2:00:48] oh glory to God then bum said build me
[2:00:51] up oh Lord into this let Christ be my
[2:00:54] head not some man in America be my head
[2:01:00] not some message pope, not some bishop.
[2:01:03] What you looking for?
[2:01:07] Let Christ this all our prayer. Amen.
[2:01:09] Amen. Let Christ be my head working
[2:01:12] through me on my foundation, my faith
[2:01:15] that's in him. Let virtue, knowledge,
[2:01:18] temperance, patience, godliness,
[2:01:21] brotherly kindness work in me. Oh Lord
[2:01:23] is my prayer. I don't care live or die,
[2:01:26] sink or drunk, denomination or no
[2:01:28] denomination, friend or no friend. Let
[2:01:32] that work in me. Let Christ virtue, his
[2:01:35] knowledge flow out that I that's for the
[2:01:38] ministry might be able to teach. So we
[2:01:41] could only effectively teach with power
[2:01:44] and knowledge because knowledge is given
[2:01:47] to the minister to feed the people and
[2:01:50] God have to put power in it. That power
[2:01:52] could come into you. Amen. With the
[2:01:54] knowledge of the son of God. Hallelujah.
[2:01:58] Glory to God. For God has set in the
[2:02:00] church. Set. God has. Yes. Yes. Not
[2:02:02] convention. And ministers say you are
[2:02:04] fivefold. You're not any fold and holy
[2:02:06] fold. All right. No. God has set in the
[2:02:08] church. Apostles and prophets and
[2:02:10] teachers, evangelists for what? For the
[2:02:12] perfecting and bringing all these
[2:02:14] virtues into it. That's the purpose of
[2:02:17] the ministry. God had put the pastors
[2:02:19] and teachers for the pastor's
[2:02:20] glorification. for the pastor to be lift
[2:02:22] up on high and say, "Oh, our lovely
[2:02:24] pastor." That's not the purpose of that.
[2:02:26] God's purpose,
[2:02:28] is for the virtues to come into you.
[2:02:31] God's purpose is for you to get a
[2:02:33] revelation that you have to be a
[2:02:35] partaker of his divine nature. And Peter
[2:02:39] identified by these promises.
[2:02:44] [Applause]
[2:02:45] [Music]
[2:02:46] These promise are precious.
[2:02:49] Just some people Amen. Ain't it so long?
[2:02:52] Yes. Afterwards, it get about a man in
[2:02:54] the sea and the man talking about a man
[2:02:56] is seeing God in the sea. A man tell
[2:02:58] him, "I don't see no God." I here for
[2:03:01] how much years I only seen is
[2:03:05] water, salt, man. Grumpy. He did so
[2:03:09] long. He seen the sunset. He see the
[2:03:11] beauty of nature. He seen sea and salt
[2:03:14] and water. And he makes him angry.
[2:03:17] He need God in him.
[2:03:20] Yes. When you have God in you, you see
[2:03:22] nature. You You see the beauty of the
[2:03:24] Amen. the birds flying. You You feel
[2:03:27] good. You see the birds flying and they
[2:03:28] they're flying free. They have a
[2:03:30] conference. Should I fly? So permission
[2:03:33] please to fly sole.
[2:03:37] The birds free. God want his children
[2:03:40] free. Free to serve him. Free to
[2:03:43] worship. Nothing must bind you. Must
[2:03:46] must hinder you. Oh, glory to God.
[2:03:50] Notice, notice all those people in the
[2:03:52] Bible that got the preach were radicals.
[2:03:54] You know, one more the blood. So, she
[2:03:55] was a radical person. She say, "If I
[2:03:57] could just touch, she just give yourself
[2:03:58] a promise." If I could just touch the
[2:04:00] hem of his garment, I'll be made whole.
[2:04:02] Hallelujah. She bleeding, bleeding. If I
[2:04:04] could just touch the hem of she if I
[2:04:06] could touch hem of his garment, I'll be
[2:04:07] made whole. She told herself that and
[2:04:09] come to see Jesus surrounded by all
[2:04:10] these different people. I'll be serious.
[2:04:12] She belt your handbag under the leg and
[2:04:13] see that I want her
[2:04:15] handbag and she push and she press and
[2:04:17] she she was just trying to get to Jesus.
[2:04:20] Hallelujah. You can't fault her for
[2:04:22] belting her handbag. That's my handbag
[2:04:24] there. Excuse me. Excuse me. I have to
[2:04:26] get my handbag.
[2:04:28] Whatever she did, she had to get to it.
[2:04:30] Once she get to Jesus, she touches. Who
[2:04:32] touched me? Who touched my clothes?
[2:04:40] [Applause]
[2:04:41] I said, "I felt a power come out of me.
[2:04:43] I felt virtue come out of me. I felt
[2:04:45] power. I felt virtue. I felt power. I
[2:04:47] felt virtue. He had it in him. That was
[2:04:50] resident power. That was permanent
[2:04:53] power. That was dynamic power. That was
[2:04:55] a dynamo inside of him. They couldn't
[2:04:58] turn it off and they couldn't turn it
[2:05:01] out. Oh, help me Jesus. Help me. Preach
[2:05:04] somebody. Help me. Preach somebody. They
[2:05:07] couldn't turn it off and they couldn't
[2:05:09] turn it out. And when God put that power
[2:05:12] inside of you, Jesus said it this way,
[2:05:14] he that believeth on me, out of his
[2:05:16] belly shall flow rivers of living water.
[2:05:20] Oh, you're not hearing me this morning.
[2:05:22] My God, I I feel a revival in the camp.
[2:05:25] I feel the Holy Spirit in the building
[2:05:28] this morning. Oh, glory to God. He that
[2:05:30] believeth on me, out of his belly shall
[2:05:33] rivers is artisian well. It keep
[2:05:36] bubbling up, bubbling up and bubbling up
[2:05:37] in your soul. This is Holy Ghost time.
[2:05:40] This is revival time. This is demon
[2:05:43] chasing time. This is possessing your
[2:05:45] mountain time. This is you giving your
[2:05:47] individual inheritance. You pressing
[2:05:49] towards the mark of the high calling.
[2:05:51] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise
[2:05:54] God. Escape the corruption. You escape
[2:05:56] the tattoos. You escape all them brain
[2:05:59] and all them praise God them makeup.
[2:06:01] Hallelujah. Escape hell. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[2:06:04] Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Hallelujah. Glory to
[2:06:08] God. You escape the ministr, the hot
[2:06:10] pants, the tight shorts, the mini dress.
[2:06:13] You escape all of that. They no fight no
[2:06:16] more. You overcome them. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:06:22] [Applause]
[2:06:34] You may be seated. Hallelujah. My Jesus.
[2:06:39] Praise God. My Lord, there are so many
[2:06:41] different types, different ways they
[2:06:43] claim to Christ Jesus. They said if you
[2:06:45] join the church, some say if you
[2:06:47] believe, some say one thing another,
[2:06:49] some take it by baptism, some take it by
[2:06:52] fellowship. But 1 Corinthians 12 say by
[2:06:54] one spirit. We're all baptized into one
[2:06:56] body. Amen. Which is the body of Christ,
[2:06:59] the body of believers by what? Not by
[2:07:01] one handshake, not by one mode of
[2:07:04] baptism, not by one feeling, but by one
[2:07:07] spirit. Not by one teaching. And if you
[2:07:09] don't believe my teaching, you're out of
[2:07:10] it. You don't believe what I out of it.
[2:07:12] That's foolishness. Keep your teaching.
[2:07:15] Keep what you believe. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:07:17] The church of God is free, not by
[2:07:18] teachings. It's more than that. It's by
[2:07:21] one spirit. You are baptized into the
[2:07:23] body. So if you are baptized into the
[2:07:25] body and you meet somebody from China
[2:07:29] baptized into the body, that's your
[2:07:31] brother.
[2:07:33] You don't have to ask the Chinese
[2:07:35] brother, oh you believe tick, you
[2:07:37] believe that tick, you believe that tick
[2:07:39] and you have a list of ticks.
[2:07:42] And when you finish to take off the
[2:07:43] tick, that's a brother. Let me shake
[2:07:44] your hand.
[2:07:46] Put away that paper. If you don't have
[2:07:48] discernment, that is a brother. you in
[2:07:50] trouble because you have to have
[2:07:52] discernment. When the brother came up on
[2:07:54] the platform, Baram says, "You're not
[2:07:56] sick. You're a Christian. I feel that
[2:07:58] spirit vibration off of you. You here
[2:08:00] for revival. You a minister of the
[2:08:02] gospel." How many here want a revival?
[2:08:04] Oh, glory to God. Brother Brandham said
[2:08:07] in 5 minutes I could tell you somebody's
[2:08:09] a Christian. Give
[2:08:11] [Music]
[2:08:15] me how much doctrine will talk in 5
[2:08:17] minutes.
[2:08:23] Hallelujah. He was bruised, tore open
[2:08:26] beside Roman spear. In order, yes, by
[2:08:31] the Holy Spirit, we could be baptized
[2:08:33] into his body and become partakers of
[2:08:36] his divine nature. You get it? Then you
[2:08:39] become a partaker after coming into his
[2:08:42] body. A partaker of his divine nature.
[2:08:46] Christ nature in you. Hallelujah. How
[2:08:49] can you cheat, steal, lie, backslide,
[2:08:54] proite and everything else with divine
[2:08:57] nature of Christ in you, it's
[2:08:59] impossible. That's why he said after you
[2:09:02] add these things, charity have to seal
[2:09:05] it because things will leak out. Virtue
[2:09:08] leaking out, knowledge leaking out, this
[2:09:10] leaking out, but virtue the bund of
[2:09:13] perfectness like Elmo's glue.
[2:09:17] [Applause]
[2:09:19] When it glue everything down, then you
[2:09:21] are sealed unit of the Lord God and you
[2:09:25] are sealed until the day of your
[2:09:27] redemption. Tell can't touch. He can
[2:09:30] only watch but he can't touch a sealed
[2:09:34] unit of the Lord God. Then you see
[2:09:37] vindicated sons, vindicated daughters
[2:09:40] with a living faith, living virtue,
[2:09:43] living knowledge, living temperance,
[2:09:46] living in patience, living in godliness,
[2:09:49] living in brotherly
[2:09:53] kindness. I ministers explain brotherly
[2:09:56] kindness and they have no life on
[2:09:58] kindness at all. It's just a
[2:10:00] teaching kind put in a place on the
[2:10:03] matter.
[2:10:05] But they not put matter. All right.
[2:10:08] That's what they say. All right. Cuz
[2:10:10] that's what the word say. All right. So
[2:10:12] you say it too.
[2:10:14] The honey sticks. That's a phrase.
[2:10:17] The honey had a stick. You had to go
[2:10:19] like somebody get sticky with. Amen.
[2:10:22] Amen. Every any honey stick and you
[2:10:24] staying far. Where you sticking to?
[2:10:27] Hallelujah. What kind of honey? That
[2:10:30] that private honey.
[2:10:32] Oh, hallelujah. It look like it won't
[2:10:35] stick, but the honey
[2:10:41] I feeling sticky this morning.
[2:10:47] [Applause]
[2:10:48] The honey sticks. Oh my. You got Holy
[2:10:51] Holy Ghost. You got Holy Holy Ghost, but
[2:10:53] you can hold brotherly kindness. Yeah,
[2:10:54] you can forgive your brother. You can
[2:10:56] forgive your sister. You could let
[2:10:57] things go. You can or you can mine it.
[2:10:59] You know, you can mine your
[2:11:02] and even get a bonnet for
[2:11:05] it and put it on your
[2:11:09] head. You can even feed
[2:11:12] your and say you really mean it. And you
[2:11:16] keeping it, you know, then your os are
[2:11:17] to grow. They can't get bigger than you,
[2:11:20] you know.
[2:11:24] But when you see it the need for
[2:11:26] charity, when you begin to see you need
[2:11:30] perfect love to get out of there, then
[2:11:32] you could understand when Jesus said
[2:11:33] when he said when you stand praying
[2:11:36] for charity for the love of God, for
[2:11:39] this third power for spirit, for
[2:11:43] dynamics, drop your if you have it
[2:11:45] against any. The our father prayer.
[2:11:48] Forgive us as we forgive
[2:11:50] those that trespass against us. And
[2:11:53] faith is based on forgiveness.
[2:11:55] Forgiveness. So how could they have real
[2:11:58] faith when there is no real forgiveness?
[2:12:00] Forgiveness means not that the person do
[2:12:02] it, but you drop it. And you could hug
[2:12:04] your brother and hug your sister. You
[2:12:06] can't hug them over the phone. You know,
[2:12:10] you can hug them over WhatsApp, you
[2:12:11] know, and send a hug. I don't know if I
[2:12:13] have that. I don't have that them little
[2:12:15] icon thing. Wait, what you call it?
[2:12:18] Emoji.
[2:12:19] I don't have a hugging emoji. And they
[2:12:22] send it across and say I I love you.
[2:12:24] That can't work. You know, love have to
[2:12:26] show it. You know, God didn't send an
[2:12:29] emoji. When he wanted to send out the
[2:12:30] world, you know them rascal down there
[2:12:32] going send an emoji for them. God so
[2:12:34] loved the world, he sent an emoji. No,
[2:12:37] he didn't do that. God so love the
[2:12:39] world, he sent his only begotten son.
[2:12:41] He come down and handle me a little baby
[2:12:44] name Jesus. Hallelujah. Grow up to pay
[2:12:47] the price of our redemption. Pay the
[2:12:49] price that we get partakers of his
[2:12:51] divine nature. Okay. So watch. If you be
[2:12:54] a partaker of Christ, then you become a
[2:12:57] new creature. Old things have passed
[2:12:59] away. All things become new. All your
[2:13:01] warings and fussings and stewings and
[2:13:05] arguings and tempers. All these things
[2:13:08] pass away. You see it. What is the fruit
[2:13:11] of the spirit? We have planted it on
[2:13:13] church membership upon shouting
[2:13:15] demonstration. But the fruit of the
[2:13:17] spirit is love. Love who? That is when
[2:13:20] you love those who unlovable.
[2:13:23] The fruit of the spirit is love. You
[2:13:25] love your family. You love your friends.
[2:13:27] You love them who love you. Bring cake
[2:13:29] for you. Who bring something nice for
[2:13:31] you. Them is the easiest one to love.
[2:13:35] Got to bring a chocolate for you and you
[2:13:36] bring back a chocolate for them. I love
[2:13:38] you. You love me. But that's not the
[2:13:41] love we talking about here. You know,
[2:13:42] this love is the love of the unlovable.
[2:13:45] When you're looking to test your love,
[2:13:48] you're looking for opportunity to
[2:13:49] release this love inside of you. When
[2:13:52] you when you let it out, then you get
[2:13:55] opportunity, you get enemy. And God seen
[2:13:57] how you
[2:13:59] enjoy and come out. Oh, how I love
[2:14:03] Jesus. And Jesus said, look, look.
[2:14:08] Glory. How you going to love me and you
[2:14:10] can't love him? You have to love one
[2:14:12] another because you are my disciples.
[2:14:15] All men will know that when that love
[2:14:17] begin to flow. So you have to have an
[2:14:19] interest in being active and pursuing
[2:14:22] after love.
[2:14:24] Pursuing after kindness. Somebody
[2:14:26] answering wrath and anger. You could
[2:14:28] answer them back in anger. You can. But
[2:14:30] you choose to defer that and answer back
[2:14:33] in kindness and deflate the the whatever
[2:14:36] they have the big airbag of anger. Put
[2:14:38] the pin
[2:14:42] and but when that when that airbag of
[2:14:44] anger come up and you start to bring
[2:14:45] your airbag then they and there's a big
[2:14:48] set of bag blowing
[2:14:50] up next the neighbor here and and and
[2:14:53] peace peace pipe had to come between
[2:14:55] you. You don't need all of that. You
[2:14:57] just need to apply virtue and knowledge
[2:15:00] and wisdom. I call the Bible said
[2:15:02] brothers to dwell with your wife with
[2:15:04] wisdom.
[2:15:06] It's quiet in here, boys. Am I good?
[2:15:09] Sometime wisdom is a distant thing, you
[2:15:11] know. And the Bible said, let me just
[2:15:12] tip tip you off. He have lack wisdom.
[2:15:14] Ask God.
[2:15:17] So sometime you're short on it. Ask God.
[2:15:20] But don't ask a wavering.
[2:15:23] Ask in faith believing. Hallelujah. That
[2:15:25] God want to give you that wisdom. Isn't
[2:15:27] that right? The fruit of the spirit is
[2:15:28] love. When you love those unlovable,
[2:15:30] that's the spirit of Christ. Wow. Love,
[2:15:32] joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness,
[2:15:35] meekness, gentleness, patience, there's
[2:15:36] the fruit of the spirit. So no matter
[2:15:38] what the church you belong to, what you
[2:15:40] have done, you can't say, "Brother
[2:15:41] Brandham, I tell you I do this, I do
[2:15:42] that." Yet I I know that that I've got
[2:15:45] it because I can pray for the sick and
[2:15:46] they can be healed. Brother Brandham,
[2:15:48] God just revealed the word to me like
[2:15:50] this and that and the other. I have a
[2:15:52] knowledge of the word. You're wrong. I
[2:15:54] heal the sick. I speak with tongues. I
[2:15:56] do these things. I cast out devils.
[2:16:00] Hallelujah. Isn't that what he said? But
[2:16:02] said it right in the word. Listen to his
[2:16:04] reply to that. Jesus said, "Many will
[2:16:07] come to me in that day with the same
[2:16:09] story." Lord, I haven't I cast out
[2:16:11] devils in your name. Haven't I
[2:16:12] prophesied in your name? He said,
[2:16:13] "Depart from me, you workers of
[2:16:16] iniquity. I don't even know you." That
[2:16:18] kind of changes the picture, doesn't it,
[2:16:19] brother? You say, "But Abraham, I know a
[2:16:21] man." He does this. Don't never look at
[2:16:24] a man by what he can do in signs of
[2:16:28] works. That is where he is nothing. He
[2:16:31] might heal the sick. He might have gift
[2:16:33] of prophecy. He might understand all
[2:16:35] knowledge. Paul said, "Though I speak
[2:16:36] with tongs of men and angels, though I
[2:16:38] understand all mysteries, I have faith
[2:16:40] to mountains, but have not charity, I am
[2:16:42] nothing. I can understand the mysteries
[2:16:45] of God. Though I have prophecy and can
[2:16:47] prophesy in the tongues of men. All
[2:16:48] those things I am nothing except first
[2:16:51] God who loves, lives in my heart and
[2:16:53] brings forth the fruits of the spirit.
[2:16:58] In other words, the divine nature have
[2:17:01] to come out.
[2:17:03] It have to be expressed. Isn't that
[2:17:05] right? Prophesying is good. Speaking in
[2:17:08] tongues is right. Interpretation is
[2:17:10] right. But that's not the fruit of the
[2:17:12] spirit. That's the gift of the spirit.
[2:17:14] Oh, praise God. Be careful. The fruit of
[2:17:17] the spirit is love. What is God? Love.
[2:17:20] If you can't love your enemy, no matter
[2:17:22] what he says about you, no matter what
[2:17:25] what
[2:17:27] he says about you. I want to say it
[2:17:29] again. No matter what he says about you,
[2:17:31] your neighbor, no matter what he says
[2:17:33] about you, praise God. Hallelujah. If
[2:17:37] from your heart, Isn't that beautiful?
[2:17:39] Amen.
[2:17:42] Amen. Amen. Glory Phil here.
[2:17:48] Amen. Amen. Dead and don't know it.
[2:17:54] If from your heart, not with your lips
[2:17:56] now, not with your knowledge that you
[2:17:59] should be doing it as a Christian.
[2:18:00] Hallelujah. But something in your heart
[2:18:02] makes you love them anyway, regardless
[2:18:04] of what you say, it's time to come to
[2:18:06] the altar again. I hate to say that. It
[2:18:10] hurt me to know there are people right
[2:18:12] here that that that living with me. I
[2:18:14] said this morning, if I was hungry,
[2:18:15] maybe you're living out there a few
[2:18:17] biscuit, but but I don't do it to be
[2:18:19] indifferent. I do it because it's the
[2:18:22] truth. And watch and you loving me and
[2:18:24] me knowing that what's the truth and
[2:18:26] seeing a danger line and don't warn you
[2:18:29] of it, I become a false shepherd and not
[2:18:31] a real sheeperd of Christ. I think I'm
[2:18:34] going to wrap up here actually. Let me
[2:18:37] see. Okay, I now reach half the message
[2:18:40] actually. So if we go for the next half,
[2:18:42] it will take a next next two hours. You
[2:18:45] have 21 pages now reach page 10. But
[2:18:47] listen to this part. I'll close. I think
[2:18:48] I'll close with this.
[2:18:50] Yeah. And then we watch a little bit.
[2:18:53] Listen to this prayer. Dear Jesus, our
[2:18:57] man from the presence of the Lord. Help
[2:18:59] us tonight now in these few words as we
[2:19:01] wait upon thee. And we pray that your
[2:19:04] grace and mercy will be with us. Lord,
[2:19:06] tend our hearts. Move back all the
[2:19:08] shocks, the thorns, the tissles. Let the
[2:19:09] blessed sunshine of God fall in upon the
[2:19:12] word Lord. And may we have such a great
[2:19:14] meeting till there'll not be an unsafe
[2:19:16] person among us. All the children will
[2:19:18] be in the kingdom of God. Those who know
[2:19:20] the baptism of the spirit may receive
[2:19:22] it. Father, may all here we go. May all
[2:19:25] the great mysteries that we are supposed
[2:19:27] to know at this age, Lord, be unveiled
[2:19:30] to us that we might see the plainness of
[2:19:34] God so that we will know how to behave
[2:19:38] ourselves and act correcting ourselves
[2:19:41] and bringing the members of our body
[2:19:44] into discipline to the word. Amen. That
[2:19:46] we might know how to live in this
[2:19:48] present day at the approaching of our
[2:19:50] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Come on,
[2:19:52] please. Amen. Listen, he is saying that
[2:19:55] the
[2:19:56] mysteries to be unveiled to us purpose
[2:20:00] to see the plainness of God. What for?
[2:20:04] That we might know how to behave
[2:20:06] ourselves and act correcting ourselves
[2:20:10] and bringing the members of our body
[2:20:13] into the discipline of his word. Oh,
[2:20:16] praise the name of the Lord. Blessed be
[2:20:18] the name of the Lord. So brother Bham
[2:20:21] spoke original seed. Now let us stand
[2:20:23] like Joshua and
[2:20:25] Caleb as this is going to have a
[2:20:28] spiritual background. Let us stand as
[2:20:30] Joshua and Caleb as we see the promised
[2:20:33] land coming in sight. It's nearing the
[2:20:35] time to be given Joshua in Hebrew means
[2:20:38] savior and represent listen the promised
[2:20:41] end time leader. Hallelujah. To take the
[2:20:44] church over. Caleb represent the true
[2:20:47] believer. Amen. Joshua represent who?
[2:20:51] The end time leader to take the church
[2:20:53] over. Who's the end time leader? The
[2:20:56] Holy Ghost that was in that prophet.
[2:20:59] He's the end time leader. He has crossed
[2:21:01] us over into the land by promise, by
[2:21:04] prophecy. He released the word for us to
[2:21:06] take. And now God is about to release
[2:21:08] the spirit. Hallelujah. Caleb represent
[2:21:10] the true believer who stayed with
[2:21:12] Joshua, who stayed with the message, who
[2:21:15] stayed with the prophetic utterance, who
[2:21:16] stayed with all what the prophet said.
[2:21:18] Amen. Caleb represent the true believer
[2:21:20] who stayed with Joshua, the Holy Ghost
[2:21:22] spirit spoken word that was spoken
[2:21:24] through that prophet. Now
[2:21:26] watch, God did not move Israel until his
[2:21:30] own appointed time. Now listen, this is
[2:21:32] going to mean something. Joshua waited
[2:21:34] for that time. No matter how much people
[2:21:36] might have said, God, give us the land,
[2:21:38] the promise. Let's go and take it. They
[2:21:39] might have said, Joshua, you lost your
[2:21:41] commission. You're washed up. Why are
[2:21:42] you not going to do something? You used
[2:21:44] to know thus said the Lord in a moment.
[2:21:46] That was the will of God. But this wise,
[2:21:48] God-son prophet knew the promise of God,
[2:21:51] but also knew to wait for that promise.
[2:21:53] A clear-cut decision from God for his
[2:21:55] time. God give it to Joshua, who had
[2:21:58] stayed with him by the word. For he
[2:22:00] could not trust others, he could trust
[2:22:02] Joshua. So will it repeat. So now he
[2:22:06] said, we press into opposition to a
[2:22:09] promise of the baptism of the Holy
[2:22:11] Ghost. For Peter said, "This promise
[2:22:13] unto you, and as many as our Lord our
[2:22:15] God shall call." Oh, blessed be the name
[2:22:18] of the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise be to
[2:22:20] Jesus. Amen. I will close, brother
[2:22:22] Anthony. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name
[2:22:26] of the Lord. Praise God. So what are we
[2:22:28] waiting for? We are waiting for
[2:22:30] manifestation of Ephesians.
[2:22:33] Hallelujah. Because Ephesians is the
[2:22:36] promised land that God promised. The
[2:22:39] back of the book bring releases another
[2:22:40] Ephesians. Ephesians is where you will
[2:22:43] get your inheritance. Ephesians is where
[2:22:45] husband love their wives, children and
[2:22:47] obey their parents. Ephesians is where
[2:22:49] you are sealed under their redemption.
[2:22:50] Ephesians is where your predestinant
[2:22:52] adoption. Ephesians have all these
[2:22:53] promises in it. Ephesians have a
[2:22:55] five-fold ministry. So Ephesians is what
[2:22:57] we're waiting for. And in Ephesians
[2:22:59] individual is going to say give me my
[2:23:01] mountain. Oh my. Hallelujah. You're
[2:23:04] coming into your own position. You're
[2:23:06] coming into your own sunship. Let's all
[2:23:07] stand and begin to worship the Lord.
[2:23:09] Father, we thank you for your presence.
[2:23:11] Lord, we thank you for your spirit today
[2:23:13] upon your word. God, unveil the
[2:23:16] mysteries to the people that they could
[2:23:18] see the plainness of God, the word that
[2:23:20] they have to press their way into faith
[2:23:22] and virtue and knowledge and temperance.
[2:23:24] God, the word is lighting up this divine
[2:23:27] nature that must be expressed. The word
[2:23:30] becoming flesh in our hearts and our
[2:23:31] lives. Bless them we pray. We commit
[2:23:33] their lives today. In Jesus name we ask
[2:23:35] it.
[2:23:38] Amen. Live in
[2:23:41] me. Live in
[2:23:44] me. Here's my
[2:23:47] heart. Let it
[2:23:51] be.
[2:23:53] Consecrate Lord to
[2:23:57] thee. Take my life Lord and live in me.
[2:24:03] Oh
[2:24:09] living is my
[2:24:16] [Music]
[2:24:19] life to
[2:24:21] thee. Take my life alone and live in me.
[2:24:27] Oh hallelujah.
[2:24:31] I am
[2:24:33] free. Christ has
[2:24:39] gi the
[2:24:42] seven is the
[2:24:45] king. Oh
[2:24:47] hallelujah. Oh Christ
[2:24:52] in me and
[2:24:55] sing me. Here's my heart. Here's my
[2:24:59] heart.
[2:25:02] [Music]
[2:25:04] consecutive.
[2:25:13] [Music]
[2:25:14] [Laughter]
[2:25:25] [Laughter]
[2:25:28] [Music]
[2:25:30] Lord to
[2:25:33] thee. Take my
[2:25:36] life. Oh, give the Lord some praises
[2:25:38] this morning. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[2:25:41] Jesus.
