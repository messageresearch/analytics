1 2 4 and also 31 to 46 and we also want to read revelation 13:1 for CFUs eat and the title tonight is 4 groups which one I know it's not complete but you could figure out how to fit in which one which one you in which one you belong which one you want to be in which wasn't in your part of you would fill in the blanks for groups which one Daniel chapter 7 we want to reform for his name and I beheld till the thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head was like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame its wheels as burning fire fiery stream issued came forth from him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousands thank ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened matches up to 25 we read one two four and then we go down to his 31 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps went forth to meet the burglar five of them were wise five of foolish they that were foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them but wise took oil in the lamps with their with their vessels with their lamps we go over the verse 31 of that same chapter when the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the tune of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats he shall set the sheep on his right hand the goats on the left then shall the King say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was a hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty you gave me drink I was a stranger you took me in naked and he clothed me I was sick you visited me I was in prison you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty or give thee drink when so he a stranger and took him and naked and clothed thee or when saw we sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall Hanson see entered them verily I say unto you and as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me then shall ye see unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels if I was hungered and you give me no meat I was to steal you give me no drink I was a stranger you took me not in naked you clothed me not sick and in prison you visited me not then shall this answered and said Lord when saw we thee an hunger and strange and naked sick when prison did not minister in the deep then shadi answered saying verily I sent to you in as much as you did it not to one of these least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous under life it our script final scripture revolution chapter 13 verse 8 and all dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world may God bless his word you may be seated praise the Lord I really wish I wishes on my Sunday I don't know why I'm bricks nice tonight but this is really feel like a Sunday message this is not heavy but with what brainer so this is the title for groups which one do you ready identifying for groups so I want you to coffee huge mask you're not in headstone turbinado take off your message mask yeah no no message your believer the cup holder will be just mastic take it off and just come and see what they would say tonight and receive what you would see tonight so it's not groups it's not it's not churches is not any message anybody but a brand I know is not that is what God said in this our yellow remember the kingdom of heaven is like none to these virgins 500 wise five were foolish which group you in the wise got oil the foolish did not get oil what cooked in what group you want to be because some point two times somebody had to get people I get desperate the most want to know that they line up with the scriptures the people either say what side you're on what good hooped you in what church you in this is not this is different now little bit different now he said you know if we live in the end time is the age that the churches are going to come together and as even now controlling wolf things they will soon control the finances of the world then if you don't belong to the World Organization of Churches you won't be able to buy or to sell you would lose all now these are weighted words tonight they say you would lose all those who stay true to God and keep their garments clean from the file Mentalist 'm of church orders will be physically bereft there will be presented to them a great temptation to give him preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the Antichrist B's system they will give in to the flatteries and the blandishments of the hierarchy but the people will follow these false shepherds right into the slaughter but in the Judgment Day they will be found naked they will not be given microbes neither will they walk with him you can't walk in spotted garments of the world holding their hands with the devil here and then expect to be with God it is time to wake up and hear the voice of God crying come out of her organisation religion and my people that you be not partakers of her sins God is speaking shun the religions of this world like a shunned a plague leave off walking with the world and make a garments white by repentance and the better than do it no for tomorrow might be too late Oh glory to God he that overcometh I will not blot out his name out of the book of life hallelujah let's continue the possibility of the removal of a name from the records of God deserves more than a casual study for up until now more students have nearly drawn a conclusion that God places the names of those born again within the Lamb's Book of Life at the time of the rebirth and if for any reason that name must be removed this is on-the-record will simply be blank as it was before Neymar be pleased there this is 100% opposite to what the wood actually teaches at the very start of our study let it be known that there is not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names this was all done before the foundation of the world after we pointed out shortly it's not a question of simply involving ourselves with two groups of people both of whom had the opportunity to receive it in a life where when one group received it and had their names placed on record and the others who refused it didn't have their name so placed we will actually show by scripture that multi-tools were not even born again will point it in a life aha that's a big one multitudes will go on that are not even born again and get eternal life what is a big thing tonight this is not screaming tonight right we will also show that there's a group of people whose me haven't been placed on that record before the phone in the world cannot under any circumstances have those name removed [Applause] and we will also show that another group whose names are on that record before the foundation will have their name removed to begin with there's no basis for the claim that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the book of life the book of life might be called the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's book of life or even died book or the book of the living only names are written on it and the scripture he says quote revelation 13:8 all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him the Beast whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world revelation 20:12 the 15 I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which are written in the according to their works under sea gave up the Dead which were in it and death and he'll but delivered up the Dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and he'll were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death many people don't even know there's a second death the first that is easy but every man that has died will be resurrected to be judged Oh hallelujah oh yeah tango tonight for the blood you thank God for Jesus pin and accepting your judgment and my judgment and upon himself dying on the cross that we could go free tonight that's why you should worship Him that's why you should give him praise that's why you should never come in the hopes of God with herself but the frong with any bad attitude or glory to God hallelujah you can see that door there are other books mentioned there is always the reference to one book container names it has caused the Lamb book of life or the book of life then where is this book located scripture Luke 10 17 to 24 hundred centimeters with joy sin Lord even the Devils are subject unto us should I name he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding and this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your name are written in heaven or glory the Gordon that always Jesus rejoice in the spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that I was hid these things from the wise and the prudent and as we filled them unto babes such as well Alleluia even so father it seemed good in thy sight oh there's a lot of shout hallelujah so this book of life is located in heaven and will appear the white throne judgment in these verses jesus said the names were written in heaven they were written in the book though rejoice because they were subject unto you but rejoice because your name is in heaven that's why if you know your name is in heaven if you know your name is written every service should be rejoicing just to have the opportunity do not worship in the beasts you're not worshiping some false prophet you're not worship in this world system or give the Lord a shout no wonder he said random seven thunders come forth then you'll be worshiping the Living Christ moving in and out among us but are we are fighting for every promise that God promised in this hour all glory to God amen hallelujah praise God hallelujah praise God praise God no notice hallelujah Childress was one of those who were cast no Devils in Jesus name and we know that he was a devil son of perdition and Jesus said he that watcheth need not wash his feet but his clean every whit but you are crema not all but you who would betray him therefore he said you're not all clean I speak not of you all I know whom I have chosen and the study scripture may be fulfilled these are it had bread with me I lifted up his heel heel against me now if language means anything we must admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus yet he was not clean Oh glory to God hallelujah Judas was also given to Jesus by the father hallelujah notice that given is the exact parallel as the illustration of Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau the eastern Pharaoh Abbas for known they were predestinated a rat both will reproduce and elect even to them but stumble at the word being disobedient Judas was numbered with the twelve and actually had a pact with them in the ministry previous the Pentecost or glory to God so those faithful ministry fight to be the bride come on give the Lord a show get the Lord on show this everybody should be caught up about that the faithful ministry tried to be prophetess bride because the Ancient of Days haul them posters ten thousand thousand like the bride Oh glory to God with the demon forget the loss now Jesus and his prey or glory to God let's continue my ox 117 men on bridge in descriptive as needed fulfilled which the holy would by the most of the image speak and he was numbered with us and an obtained part of this ministry the part that Judas obtained among the twelve and then lost was neither inferior to the ministry of the other level no was it a devilish foreign ministry interjected among the ministry of the others so he was anointed and commissioned or give the Lord I shall do you feel like moving on tonight that he may take part in this ministry and Apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place Judas had ever lost a court given Holy Ghost ministry and kill themselves and went his own place his name was even in the book of life his name was blotted out there are four groups all glory to God you have to be identified with one you have to be connected at one there's a word pride that is revised version or glory to God as the foolish virgins second resurrection for that there are the people that are good that will get it to the life at the white throne judgment Oh glory to God and there are those names who was never in the book okay the Lord a show or glory of God you have to belong to one org or even gotten if your name is on that book here no puttin it in yes even left to put it in tonight that name was put there I will get a lot of shock before the foundation of the world before you had a problem before a condition before your felon soon before you fail me you all right to shout right to sing God hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah hallelujah the see him up there dead I saw the dead small and great stand before God think about it now my you unholy gongs tonight you are privileged tonight all them people who never stand a chance on when I'm gone some of them wish they can reboot and pick and get out the hell and take a seat and church to say give him one more chance just one more chance give me another chance [Applause] [Music] [Applause] just continue there will be both the righteous and the unrighteous in this judgment these righteous will not be the bride for the bride system and judgment [Music] stop rewind but over the mean the brain will be part of the judgment yes he have a script a faith first corinthians 6:2 two and three do you know the scenes adjust the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters know you not that you shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life not a scripture relation 3:21 taemin overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame an Isetta what my father his strong see the bride is written in a strong and she is to judge the world she was to be sitting in judgment that's what Daniel saw Oh glory to God hallelujah and he caught descriptively red I beheld until the trauma cast down and the engines of these did sit whose garment was white as snow Oh glory to God hallelujah so you are a big statement to make now only the bride alone qualifies for the first resurrection or glory of God bless her that day that comfort in the first resurrection only the bride all the bride electors go along in the ground they come into the first resurrection everybody has have to wait for the second resurrection but there's to be elected bride coming forth in the first resurrection he's not excited tonight is another exciting tonight it's going to be a resurrection I want to be when the same school or give the Lord a shout when the saints go marching in hallelujah hallelujah was continued the question arises why are these righteous ones in judgment there is no other place they can come in for they are not - they are just for two resurrections and since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come in the second resurrection unto judgment so the second resurrection is a resurrection of the judgment not the first one because the bride already judged in Christ Jesus the bride will not be judged the bride cannot be judge she will be with the judge okay the Lord has shown the bridles justified [Applause] did you hear that the bride is justified as if she never did it in the first [Applause] hallelujah study Muslim abyss and resurrection the ones who qualify for the first resurrection is the bride and I'm not in judgment and he could have scripted for at the back adoption John 5:24 fairy lights unto you he that heareth my will that believe on him that sent me hath everlasting life which is a believer a recipient of eternal life he is a possession of it right now and shall not come into judgment hallelujah but is passed from death unto life so Jesus must have yet another in mind a certain resurrection will receive eternal life they will receive it at that resurrection not having previously as a member of the bride and to prove that he ever scripture for that John 5:22 29 marvel at this for the hour is coming this is Jesus in which all data in the graves shall hear his voice all all and shall come forth neither have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation but all could hear that voice and to thankful to God tonight that you hearing the voice of God in the last years or glory of God you hear in his voice no you hearing a word of the Spirit no God speaking to you know because the ability to hear I read from Clarke give the Lord a shout [Applause] you as he left have the ability from God or glory to God you are hearing from God tonight because God is the word [Applause] understand receive the word you came from God that's the ability that God put in the leg hallelujah we all know that John 5:22 29 is not the rapture I just hope you just read for only the dead in Christ shall arise on the graves at the time along with the Living bride who still sits on the earth let's see about the scripture we just read Marvel not that this for the always come in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come for dinner of good or the resurrection of life they'll have done evil unto the resident our nation that nothing rapture there's not a rupture the rapture is 1st Thessalonians 4 for the Lord Himself shuts in for me with a shout and the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air or there's a lot of shock hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah let me get a lot of shots again because you wanna be caught up to meet him you are gonna be changed in a moment in a pickle of an eye I believe that I'm gonna preach that oh praise God praise God hallelujah you may be seated we now face the question as to why this should be given eternal life at the judgment since the epistles seem to conclusively point out that one must possess the Spirit of Christ or perish though it seemed us we must not discredit the words of Jesus who most pointedly sets forth that there are some found in the book of life who will either receive eternal life before the general resurrection or after it Paul does not evade this truth for he clearly says in Philippians 3 level is by any means I might attain the resurrection of the dead now this statement is very peculiar we all know and we are all going to be in a resurrection whether we want to be or not all will be resurrected so Paul could hardly be seen is by any means I might attain a resurrection of the dead the truth of the matter is he's not seeing that the literal realness if by any means I might attain to the out resurrection from among the dead this is not the attaining to the general or seven second resurrection but attend to the first resurrection and which he said blessed and holy is he who had passed in the first resurrection on such the second death no power or glory to God hallelujah praise God don't you feel inspired tonight all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah oh praise God let's continue he said no but he shall be like priests of God and Christ shall reign with him a thousand years the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second left that is at the end of a thousand years when all the rest of the Dead live again and in that day there will be those who come forward to eternal life and those others who are caught in the second death no we do not need to guess about those who are in the second resurrection are given life we are told it is given to them on the grounds that they are being kind and good to the Brethren this is something worthwhile noting a long time I've heard this but this is some type something with Van Noten we are told it is given to them on the grounds they are being kind and good to the Brethren those who are raised and cast a lake of fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the bedroom or everybody [Applause] never heard that before just a minute now Oh glory to God amen hallelujah since this is the word of the Lord we simply accepted there is no argument here just a simple statement of fact we read the scripture when Jesus fasted eternal life he said when I was hungry you feed me when I was naked you clothed me and they say but when we do that he said when you do they literally Lisa them UT system to me Oh hallelujah or glory to God hallelujah praise God the rest was the direct opposite let's continue the further clarify notice specifically go on alike that porn the words as Matthew 25:31 246 which is what you read it does not see that a shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a shepherd dividing sheep from goats these are not sheep in this particular area of time y2 and judgment the sheep are already in his fold they heard his voice they followed him they already have eternal life and he are not come into judgment but these do not have it in life they are in judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon what grounds to the enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have this life as does the bride but they receive it because it was time to his brethren they are not his brethren that will make them join us with Jesus they are not asked to anything but life they share not role except over him their names must have been in the book of life and not removed but because of the love of the people of God they are recognized and saved oh man so no you know who you are I know you know people gonna treat you based upon who you are I will be saved and receive eternal life because of who you are okay the Lord a shout it's the death know who you are you better know who you are tonight Oh glory to God you are mrs. Jesus Christ I'll give the Lord a show scallywag sinner somewhere he put your name on the book he said mark I thought to call you out let's continue cause of their love of the people of God they are recognized and save no doubt these save that help the chin of God perhaps like Nicodemus and Gamaliel they stood for the cheer in a time of trouble it's this seem smack of restoration watch carefully now for the wicked and not restored but turn into the lake of fire the names of many of those destroyed were in the book of life also but they were blotted out because they fail to honor the people of God who are the Living manifested word living epistle for their day oh you mean the bride could be the living manifested for this day your meal is not walking wrong with the book and escape and say what you believe but it has to be the individual oh my god I believe that you know or you have except the other group if you don't want to accept that you have to become the Word made flesh then you have to find the next group you never said I know my group keeps spinning and see if you find a group it's only for it not 24 you know just for so you could pick which one that's what they want now what type it so which one now let's be clear here these are not Nations being judged and going to the Millenium because they have harbored and at the Jews this is very clear because of the conclusion of these verses that these do wicked shall go into everlasting punishment but the righteous into everlasting life there is no record of two judgments set whether wicked a cast on a lake of fire only the beast and the false prophet at the judge at the end of the Great Tribulation this is the white throne judgment and they are judged according to what's written in the book in the second recollection that's the souls under the altar that's in the fifth seal them coming second resurrection the carbonyl Lord voice how long Lord how long does not judge and avenge our blood these Jews under this altar we know that note particularly that none of these under the altar were killed for the testimony of Jesus they were not like Antipas who was slain for holding his fascist name these are not born again one with its in life as their possession they come in the resurrection and receive life because of their stand on the word notice how these are crying for vengeance they cannot be bright material that speaks volume they then choose cannon for vengeance he said dynapac material so any person in this message I never vengeance you know we're on it you know equipped in rank then not in this bright group because the bride don't call for vengeance is mine saith the Lord I will repair the break your contract the bride will turn the other cheek give the Lord a show [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the bright the bright turn-the-other-cheek they have to because they are they have to watch so these Jews and born of the Spirit they don't even believe that Jesus is Messiah but they were blinded by God for the Gentiles seek God give them eternal life on the grounds that though they could not come to him they were truly faithful to all the world the new and died under Stalin and Hitler and yet they will die it is the second resurrection where in the five foolish virgins to come up oh my goodness this five foolish virgins mmm incision they not denomination let's continue they they did not have the Holy Spirit so they miss being in the bride while the five wise who had oil became a part of that bride but these people being separated God loving people trying to abide in the world according to what they knew of it and I help in the work of the Lord will come at the end of time they will miss the millennium which you we can begin to see by these truths is more important and wonderful than we ever thought or belief know that ahead at this all I want to miss it that come like have a big banquet downstairs and you go at home to drink water and Dom says have all seven course menu layout here and you're going to drink water tribulation and water and a thesis dear it have a wedding supper you know and a millennium honeymoon yeah this is my wonderful he said then we could think or imagine you don't want to miss it which group are in there or give the Lord a shout them out hallelujah hallelujah don't be afraid hallelujah glory to God you could imagine know when you hit that scripture his wife at bitters already when you come into the church nobody could touch you no more because you in an atmosphere all by yourself because you know who your husband is you know who you worship your know by your worship oh my let's continue Oh glory to God hallelujah listen all these people are their names in the book of life and their names remain but whose names did not remain those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be tools whose names are removed that is who will lose out they will be cast into the lake of fire so let's go to another step he said let's review our case thus far let's review these four groups one first of all we know assuredly that the purpose of God stands an election it was purposed in himself it was God's purpose the prefect of people icon themselves that would be a word bright so that break a missive for nothing because God purpose it that is God intent to have a word bright no Bishop could stop it no conjugal stop it no Prime Minister no president no message Pope or Roman Pope it has brought hallelujah not only Pope's any message or alter the message could stop this world pressure coming for no false anointed no unwanted not that preacher no lying preacher nothing gonna stop this bride oh I feel good tonight God swore he's far by himself seven thunders total voices oh go get that bride going to break the silence over your life like he broke the silence off the Seventh Seal Oh Gloria I've got a man let's continue hallelujah she was chosen this bride before the foundation of the world in him she was for known and beloved before she was ever brought forth to many ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into control over here just now if I continue so I will cast a problem I won't leave the country to preach in this thing this thing's sweet tonight did you hear what he just said here did you hear that or give the Lord a shout hear what the Spirit is speaking tonight he said she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the judgement because sin cannot be imputed unto her [Applause] hallelujah where's the scripture for that Romans 4 it blessed is the man to whom God the Lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of our members was written in the search of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that's group number one that's you that's the word bride Rosalyn him before the forgive the world before your smoking first cigarette before your tell you first life before you commit adultery and fornication before your backside before all that put your name on the love life or get the Lord a show that's why I found you just like it find you're not bad in a rum shop anybody could find you pick you up what's the truth living before much man and what not that you when you see when he see don't wanna be wealthy he passing some area he's no her name is on the book he had to call she out and Annie fine huh he sent his disciples away I mean for that woman or Cory she I even know she is being wasted on she's waiting for her to come her name Oh glory to God before she even reach here right yes yeah yes glory to God he talked about the voice of God the last days there are people with Gloria caught the voice of cause like the wrong once more I read from God God will speak God is speaking God has spoken hallelujah hallelujah I feel her going free tonight I feel I see a higher kryptonite I see a see higher order tonight or glory to God there are girls whose names are in the book at all that's not you get a lot a show that's why we could rejoice o Hollywood us continue hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's the group you want to be identified in that's the coop you wanna be part of that's a group gonna have your Shoten well as though and the morning satsangh together and the sons of god destroy that's that group that's for sure hallelujah gonna be ceases hallelujah let's look at the second group another class their names were also in the book of life but they will come in the second resurrection such as the foolish virgins and the righteous are spoken Matthew 25 in this class those who do not worship the beasts or become involve an antichrist system but die for their faith even though they're not not in the bride Oh hallelujah Oh God having been born again they will come in the second resurrection unto eternal life thirdly there are the borderline Christians such that we saw Israel carbonyl Egypt these had their names in the book of life and their works written in the books these haven't field to obey God being void of the Spirit - even the signs and wonders among them will have their names removed from the book of life among the coop you'll find us entirely void of the Spirit religious will have manifestation in their lives although the books were not elected in him such as Balaam will be in that group and the thought will finally boys whose things have never been or never will ever be written in the book or give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus hallelujah oh my let's hit the home stretch now you did very well I'm amazed how we get to it Oh glory look caught you can imagine RIT ascenders volodya anointing ho jaaye and like Crick's biscuit you have to take it on try and put some water behind it but when the Shekinah is upon this but this will just come alive so smooth it will

make the difference the anointed Prince the yoke the Spirit is just a big revelation to you which group [Music] hallelujah hallelujah so all the more awesome grudges will be pissing in hallelujah

real Jesus that I my name by Jesus Oh hallelujah maybe by Jesus mother Jesus Oh hallelujah praise God so his spirit let's continue let's conditions took two good hallelujah yes a little more since this portion of the word is hard for the human matter grass all this profit is good oh my goodness is this this is good it must be accepted and believed by feet someone be offended by what I have set for it because it feel to understand the sovereignty of God which sets forth that God is God and because He is God one cannot defeat his concerts or thwart his will and purpose but he being omnipotent is ruling in all our fears and is doing whatever he will with all his creation because all were created for his good pleasure therefore Paul said if God should take one lump of clay and make that seem love one vessel unto honor and another vessel unto dishonour who can be offended and cry against him that he has the right to do on the grounds of creation alone we cannot deny he hath he went even further according to Roman's 14 Sam 9 we have the irrefutable proof that Jesus paid the purchase price of the whole world therefore you can do as you will with his own and none of us liveth to himself Norman died himself but wherever we live we live unto the Lord whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lord's oh there's a Lord I show you are being purchased you are being bought with a price do you get that tonight you are not your own he paid for you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this end Christ both tied and rose and revived but he might be the Lord both of the Dead and the living yes revolution here he said ownership not relationship is meant here he is Lord over the river and the dead not relationship relationship with his bride but honest overall that's why when he speak every man-jack coming up all go be raised from the dead to be judged what poopin you will be in hallelujah hallelujah I'm almost done quote Ephesians that's in the dispensation of the fullness of times he by cards together in one all things in Christ both which have them even him in whom we are obtained inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will thus if God so designed that there are those whose names are pleased in the section of the book of life that cannot be raised for the other names of his bride then we must accept it also states that there are those whose names are placed in the record but in the foreknowledge of God they were to fail and have those name removed we must accept that and if there are those who name up there was those who names was never placed on the reckon all of life we must accept that also Oh hallelujah or glory to God my God my God let's continue to understand this subject raise a cup of it I'm gonna close even more clearly it will be wise to approach it from the standpoint of the church through the ages remember sometime I'll talk about conversion and people don't want to convert and digest again things are literally if you go to Mexico you can't use TT dollars the other converted to pieces so if you want to build the house the materials called building materials but around call them virtues building materials if you want to go into the King's presence they become steps you're not building materials gwandma the king you have seven steps to go up to the king because he's only seven step isn't that right if you want to see to the edges you need eyes so all of a sudden you have seven eyes everyone changes here one seven horns so is the currency of the conversion to what effect that you want now you can't preach spirit to preach the word and it would tell in the spirit now there are three Bibles the zodiac this physical Bible and the pyramid but you're capricious or yuck you cap which pyramid but you can preach the word and if this will come into you you have the premiere you you have to buy or glory no God so brother Branham taking the book of life now and he bringing a different reference and a point to bring clarity to all what I said of these four groups are you ready just a little more again or another finish let's go that's what yeah what is he now to understand this now we want to consider not even Fisher now but the groups represented in the church to do this we would like the church to the aegis tall wheat plant a grain of wheat is planted to the end that a single grain of wheat will reproduce on by itself you are sitting process I'm during a certain period of time that single seed will die and in time the light that was in it will come up into a plant which in turn will be the Bureau or the carry of that life which is to come back to originality in multiplatform Jesus the great warrior seed died the massless one who is the life of the church stands in the myths of the Church of all seven Church ages given his life to the church the carrier or the bearer to the end that this very life will be represent buddies like unto his in the resurrection it is at the resurrection that the Royall seed will see many royal seeds icon to himself so this is not already it the real glory will be ready at the resurrection where we shall see him like he is and we shall be like him okay the Lord I show this miserable fresh body like him we put on interruption and be a change all glories of God let's continue we shall be like him no that is what John the Baptist was referring to that Jesus will gather the wheat into his gonna that was the resurrection where the redeemed who had been elected into life came in know the record of this wheat plant here we go whose end is to reproduce the original seed in multiplied form is the book of life so he is converting it the whole wheat plant Gideon are you guessing it is the book of life are you with me I repeat the history all record of this wheat plant is the book of life on which a path of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life this is convincingly seen by examining the wheat plant a seed is sown soon our play this scene that is not to beat yet it grows into a stock that is not a week yet life is there but not to reach then at the end of the store is a little spike that's another tassel still are we plant but no bit yet then the plant is pollen eyes we see the chest grow it looks mighty and the weak but has not yet seed then forms a wheat in the husk it is now back to what is all original II know the right man read is harvested Jesus died almost finish so bear with me anybody sleeping just give a big shock there's just no sleeping right now we almost done all right so Jesus Christ died you give his life that life was to come back upon the church here we go and bring many sons like unto himself unto the glory in the resurrection but as the wheat seed had to have a carrier to bring forth multiplied with seed even so it had to be a church which would be a carrier of the life of Christ the blade stop Hasselhoff were the carriers for the seed but not to see the self so the church cooperate through the ages had been a carrier of the true seed though not the seed itself that is why we can say the book of life is the whole wheat plant okay the Lord a shock do you catch it tonight let's go over it again here is the original seed that was planted it produces a bleed that wasn't it if it is a store not it either he had come husk we to form the tassel appears then the pollen falls on something on those pistols part of that plant is quickened something of the original seed came to the rest of the plant turns in the seed why didn't the whole pan go into seed because it was created to that end just part of that plant can go back to being seed because that part of the wheat plant is eternal life wheat [Applause] do you see it all the other processes carriers but that part come back to eat is the original grid that's the bad old glory to God he sent the Prophet the thymus bath original faith the original seed the original life all let's finish off here now all glory to God he said you have a perfect type Israel even Egypt they came out two million strong all escape the sacrificial blood all about ties on the Red Sea all came out of the water and join Holy Spirit manifestation all angel food all drunk of the rock yeah except for few they were not but carriers all Israel is not Israel all but a tiny minority and their names were blotted out of the book of life we have the same thing right in the church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names Roberto the book of the eternal life for that is another record that contained in the book this is the record God had given us eternal life and that life is in his son he's a factor son had the life oh my breaking he could come oh my you're being a tremendous audience tonight you applaud my mind I thought this might be too much for tonight but praise God praise God praise God hallelujah in conclusion in conclusion lists for this time let me further statement that armies in the beginning when I said that not one scripture spoke the Lord presently compiled in a record of names that is in deep soul Oh hallelujah oh my talk about a roll call he said the rapture is not the only roll call the rapture will be a roll call Oh glory to God are waitin to hear that voice Oh glory when he speaks you can take their advice about glory goddamn in my mind mind mind the rapture is not the only world called there's a second resurrection of the white one judgment we'll names be confessed before the fallen angels and I've been told by those who know that the sweetest song to a human ear it's a song of that person's name how people love to have their names before the public how they love a clean but no little voice will ever song your name as sweetly as well the voice of God if your name is in the book of life and remains there to be revealed before these holy angels what a day that will be when we are Jesus a father they confess my name before men in the days of the earthly pilgrimage no I will confess their names before thee and all the heavenly angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches once more the spirit had spoken once again we have reviewed a record of what the Spirit set another age and we have found the record correct another age has gone by it must fulfill exactly as he said it would be what a consolation that is to us who hope to be in the last day bright for it causes our hearts to leap for joy that he is faithful and will perform every promise if he was faithful and true the doors in his audition age then he will be just as true in our age if there by His grace and power will receive the commandment by EM so will we let us go therefore to perfection and meet the Lord in the air and we forever be with him let's all stand and worship the Lord tonight [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I can hear my Sita [Music] I can have my savior [Music] my face I can hear myself take my cross and follow me Jesus where he leaves me put
