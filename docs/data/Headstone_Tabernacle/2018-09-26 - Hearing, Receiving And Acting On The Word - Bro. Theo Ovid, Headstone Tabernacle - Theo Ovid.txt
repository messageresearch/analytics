to be here tonight it's good to be in his presence tonight so the night moon eternal by Buster tree portion scripture in Genesis chapter 25 mark chapter 4 2nd Timothy chapter 4 when I read Genesis 25 was 21 and 34 one remark for verse 23 to 29 2nd Timothy 4 wonderful reading Genesis 25 freedom from booze 21 an Isaac entreated the world the Lord for his wife because she was barren and the Lord was entreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy powerless and the one people shall be stronger than the other people on the elder shall serve the younger when a day is to be delivered with fulfill behold they were twins in a woman the first came out red all over like a hairy garment they call his name Esau and after that came his brother out and his hand to : Esau healed and his name was called Jacob and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them the boys grew he's always a cunning hunter man out of the field Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and he saw Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but Rebecca loved Jacob Jacob sought partisan Esau came with the field and he was faint Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee without seeing him read pottage for I am faint deer for was his name called Edom and Jacob said sell me this data boy tried Esau said behold I am at the point to die and what profit shall dispute right do to me Jacob said swear to me this day and he swelled to him and he sold his birthright unto Jacob then Jacob give Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat drink rose up and went his way thus he saw despised his birthright Mark chapter four we want to read from verse 23 Jesus speak him if any man have ears to hear let him hear and he said unto them take heed what you hear with what measure you met it shall be measured to you and unto you that here shall more be given for he that hat to him shall be given and he that had not from him shall be taken even that which he hath so is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up and he know it not how for the earth bring it forth fruit of itself first the blade then the ear and after that the full corn in the ear when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put it in his sickle because the harvest has come alas scriptures from 2nd Timothy 4 we want to read from verse 1 2 for I charged ddr4 before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preached the word the instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not end your song doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away from the ears from the truth and shall turn into fables now let's pray father we thank you for your word may you interpret your water hearts as we wait on you tonight we wait upon your spirit to come and confirm your word in Jesus and we ask it email you may be seated praise the name of the Lord or what a blessing it to be here tonight the presence of God glad I see all of you out here tonight I believe there'll be doors connected to us god bless you our title tonight here in receiving an actin on the word here in receiving an actin the word mystery parts people could hear but that doesn't mean they receive we could claim to receive and don't even act upon what they have it but you want to act upon what you hear I have an inspiration the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you here that's my the measure and thought and study you give to the truth you hear and I was a warning I didn't put that dong be careful what you hear I've a context scripture and is from second Timothy 3:16 but I want to really amplified of that it says every scripture all Scripture is profitable for doctrine and so on L all Scripture is god-breathed it is given by inspiration and is profitable for instruction for reproof and conviction of sin for correction of error and discipline and obedience and for training and righteousness in holy living in conformity to God's will in thought purpose and action now understand this when God began to reveal himself to his people his people had was to listen to his words to get his thoughts of how he presented himself on how he wants to be worship all what Moses gifted the people was given by God so you need to hear the word and give thought to the word an amazing word to catch the mind of God that you could please God because somebody could live a normal successful life on it with money with wealth and everything else die and go to hell normal normal normal good people and it has nothing to do with God's program here this this is scripture that you have to receive in your heart and in your spirit isn't that right Oh blessed be the lord of measure and thought and study you give and that inspiration comes from that same script we read in mark chapter 4 and you know we read it he said unto them and this is the amplified be careful what you are hearing the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear will be the measure of virtue and knowledge that comes back to you and more besides will be given to you who here Sophia coming here in the world so tonight you come to hear the word to be empowered and the scripture itself has strengthened it no they'd ever don't want you to know that that's why he doesn't want you to read your Bible don't you want to reduce what boss doesn't want you to listen to a tape or listen to any word you just go into life because you know every Scripture is God breathed the breath of God is upon the word so if you give that thought and measure and study to the word you'll be empowered because it will teach you to wait upon the Lord instead of pushing yourself forward to do your own thing because you prefer to be in the will of God hallelujah believe that tonight oh praise God so we under tension tonight praise God for the a revival for apostolic blessing for signs and wonders and miracles that's our right to expect that we got next make it next week we can expect it tonight every service I come and I'm come and expect in it because I don't know when he will come suddenly into his temple I don't know when the Holy Spirit will dropped on us out of here with a measure of power praise God give you'd all glory to God is that right hallelujah hallelujah if you are not crying the ceiling you is crying that's see crying for perfection that seed crying for life or something inside you is what pushing you is what driving you you you can't even help it or glory to God because God put that seed in you and that's you have to work its way out okay there are some praises when a farmer put a seed into the ground that's enough to push his way out my fate the farmer put that seed in the ground by fate the family expecting rain and Sun and my faith the life in the sea begins to push Oh glory to God on tonight there's a life in your seed go ahead and give your dead seed go until you are predestinated seeded it's our game seed God give you or glory their God we believe that hallelujah that seed is what caused you to hear a word let's see what calls you receive the word but you have to act upon the word also or glow in a God when I say receive I'm not talking about outwardly and formally but inwardly and willingly you want the will of God you want to receive the word inwardly and willingly not formally and outwardly when I know I should do it no not that you want to do it you want to please God or every Sun that acted on the Word of God was blessed oh my hallelujah oh praise the name of the Lord be careful what you are hearing the measure of taught and study a gift of the truth will be the measure of virtue and knowledge that comes back to you Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus do you believe that tonight hallelujah so God wants you to come into conformity to his will in thought in purpose and action you know some people say prayers see novena say thing and say little thing and thing like that that's a ritual that has nothing to do with God's intent and purpose that brings an effect upon your life this gospel comes having an effect of upon your life that drives you into action not talk you see people right now sitting on in church only take and talk because he passed a preaching on the minister preacher and they love the pasta and it passes in a passenger capacity era but court not on death before them cheering was born he said Jacob I love he so I hate before there was even born because he know the life inside him will for a certain way so when Rebecca had a challenges got to let two nations in your womb go to see two sons and two nations two people and right now there are two people in the church there's bright spirit and church spirit and you have to know where you belong one thing one thing about Jacob even the fate for the built rank or glory of God and that is what you here for tonight not to be goody two-shoes because Isaac loved Esau but God loved Jacob oh he's a good cook Isaac could cook good Jacob good cook good good thing you could cook catchy brother anybody hungry now Jacob whether DC where he was a scampi was this he was that but gotta love him because it will try to represent the holy spirit and that is your birthright you're right of authority or right to inheritance that is to put the one to bad you want the power of God in your life you didn't want to come to church and go back home you want power in your life how many can say amen to that tonight so we are looking for dynamics to the mechanics you looking for another Ephesians and the faith is to produce that succour tense and well my no - no - no it's back to the faith of the fathers and that faith will reproduce and not Ephesians which is purely supernatural because Ephesians was the Alpha Satan don't know what Ephesians back here again you know all Satan readin is loud easier and he forgave India but you see I am Alpha and Omega so he brought the profit to the end allowed Isha to tow us back to the faith to pull Ephesians right out of the ground the politicians back in this hour here or glory the gods of the seven seas seventh on the message is to release another Ephesians which brings a faithful ministry which brings on the perfection of the saints the work of the ministry the fan of the body till we all come into the unit if it all this foolishness and Church separation that will be busted when the flood of the Holy Ghost began to pour out and go inside to flood them churches I'll flood them at the Holy Ghost so believers will have fellowship and all them pastors cutting this one off and once again cut off because it's not mine my power but by my spirit or glory to God and the church have been built for 40 plus years on the mechanics and all can intellectual stuff but God promised that the church will be rebuilt by the power of the Spirit so we are waiting for the rebuilders the rebuilding anointing not by might not by power but by my spirit share the Lord it wouldn't be the work of a man it's may be the work of the Holy Ghost oh I what are you hearing tonight what hair is dull right of Jesus Christ Oh God Oh glory to God hallelujah what a Brandon prophesied Illinois did not he say I'm only building they always close at hand when they want to see some things happen when something is going to take place and all this background has been laying a foundation for a short quick message that would the whole nations or glory I'm missing I'm gonna shake the whole nation then he's away to let me seventh unless after the voices of that group they're gonna do whatever they wanna do praise God hallelujah hallelujah he said what we she said make a revival that preacher people find them everywhere saying the

entire word and prophesy or give the Lord a shout once you take that word you could prophesy give measure and thought to what we preach in tonight give measure and thought to the word tonight that

temporary eating but what about the padding this young man for me Elijah always certainly say stay here young man do even though it's being tested how much time you stay right where you are because your mother tell us did your father tell yesterday somebody outside tell you damn bunch a hypocrite still and the true the words are the brush everybody with a broad brush as if that is so that's not so and you still and short a self of the vision I know people who dreams got cut off of hearing what other people see and they was never supposed to listen to that be careful what you hear and sometimes I did be careful what they speak some let me speak the vision to the wrong person and they twist it and it make it show off of it that's why the vision have to come from God and envision have to come directly to you I mean after know what you're hearing don't let nobody to you're off track I have a vision God give me a vision I'm not going to loan my sight from that vision people will come people go that's their joy choice I am here who God God please me to keep the vision straight for the vision is from appointed time the Baptist that they could hold on long enough to see it fulfilled we have seen enough to believe God could unfold visions revelations because it churches spirit on Revelation not on feelings not on human beings it wasn't built upon pizza he was gonna fail it's built up under of Revelation that's the anchor inside your soul that's why you're the prey for God forgive you revelation revelation is prevalent power revelation is revealing power how you could get revelation and you're not reading the word how you can get revelation you're not meditating on the word how you can get revelation you're not in the spirit of the word or give the Lord some praise these people measure and thought and study that again and God reward you with revelation and your prevalent power on a man who just kernel and natural have nothing you're just going to church no change in their life no change in their thinking because what the word does it changes your mind God said my trust is not your thoughts so how will you get the thoughts of God if you don't get the will of God to impact upon your thoughts because you see impossibilities you see hurdles you see hindrances you see red sea you see all kind of things because you are thinking at the natural level but when you toss a god drop down you are being recognized all things are possible he wasn't talking that way before but now you begin to talk different because he's thinking different from not possible to all things are possible so your feet begin to expand you start to exercise the Fate muscles because I start to see supernatural sight [Music] what if Samson accepted his eyes out what if Samson

I my brethren mistake me when I see that I'm not referring to spirit film men who stand as shepherds and feed the flock of God that's what Dean by the Holy goes to do so I am talking about common believers like like today Tristan today I think don't president America talk to the United Nations he's talking about you know make America full and said respect for sovereignty we're not telling

religiously inclined he had his religion and most of the people they got a religion of some sort whether attend church or not isn't that right Jacob is twin brother by election yes which was predestination by foreknowledge came into the world was a spiritual man to represent a spiritual people so let's call it the two natures now you have a Jacob nature and Israel nature in Israel I don't

brother sister don't know who you are but you are disguised God cover you up and do it put the seed inside of you that's see this to be transformed because Jacob not gonna stay Jacob all night long Jacob will be transformed with that angel experience and when God finished with him he have a new walk you have a new talk and a new name or give the Lord some praise his people do you understand what I'm saying that same Jacob is no transform his new name is no Israel then he had 12 sons and then come to 12 tribes of Israel and that's come the people of Israel or give the Lord some praises people the man was transformed is not hallelujah Jacob was transformed and you will be true because God put the seed inside you that's it is crying for transformation okay the Lord a shout that ceylon us crying for transformation tonight Jacob his twin brother by-election which was my predestination my foreknowledge came into the world spiritual man represented spiritual people and he had spiritual discernment of what was right and what was wrong and you will understand that the entire church is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ that's when she just asked Peter who do men say I am because men don't know who I am who do you Sam they didn't know I'm Peter said ah what the christ is the flesh and blood didn't reveal that to you nobody else entered with text on whatsapp you was revealed to you by revelation and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell can prevail against it and that reveal means the rest on overcome so you won't get battles your height but the can overcome let's set and Lucius missiles you can't overcome oh yes let them arrest us and shake us but we are not gonna still standing God Alleluia home get rock marriage get rock job gets rough but you're still standing oh by the grace of God I was reading my brother branham his people think $25 a week o 20,000 a month or whatever it is and they had some bills to pay and they were short $10
