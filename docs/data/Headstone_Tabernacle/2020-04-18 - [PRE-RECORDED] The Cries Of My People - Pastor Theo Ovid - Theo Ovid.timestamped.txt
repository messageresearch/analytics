[3:03] chapter 3 read in verse 1 now Moses kept
[3:07] the flock of Jethro his father-in-law
[3:08] the priest of Midian and he led the
[3:11] flock to the backside of the desert and
[3:12] came to the mountain of God even to
[3:16] Horeb
[3:16] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[3:19] Him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[3:21] of a bush he looked and behold a Bush
[3:24] bull with fire and the bush was not
[3:26] consumed and Moses said I will know our
[3:29] paternal side and see this great sight
[3:31] why the bush is not burnt when the Lord
[3:36] saw that he turn aside to see God called
[3:40] unto him out of the midst of the bush
[3:42] and said Moses Moses and he said here am
[3:46] I he said draw not hither put off thy
[3:50] shoes from of thy feet for the place
[3:51] whereon thou standest is holy ground
[3:54] moreover he said I am I am the God of
[3:57] thy father the God of Abraham the god of
[4:01] Isaac the God of Jacob and Moses hid his
[4:05] face and he was afraid to look upon God
[4:07] and the Lord said I have surely seen the
[4:11] affliction of my people which I in Egypt
[4:14] and have heard their cry by reason of
[4:17] their taskmasters find no dis Horrors
[4:21] and I am come down to deliver them out
[4:24] of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[4:26] bring them up out of that man onto a
[4:29] good land a large and land floor and
[4:32] milk and honey unto the place of the
[4:35] killer' nights and the Hittites and
[4:37] amirite son the parasites and the
[4:40] Hittites and the jebusites may God bless
[4:42] the novice world you may be seated
[4:43] oh praise the name of the Lord thank you
[4:47] lord
[4:48] well a small exhortation today maybe 10
[4:52] minutes 8 minutes there's a few minutes
[4:55] the cries of my people that's the exact
[4:59] Tichenor how a user this evening the
[5:01] cries of my people and the prophet said
[5:04] from a message why now to you people
[5:07] that wanted to renew the joy of the
[5:09] salvation
[5:09] somebody lost joy Tim back what you did
[5:13] did you neglect parameter neglect within
[5:16] your Bible neglected praying at your
[5:19] home asking the blessing at the table it
[5:24] may look like little stuff but all these
[5:27] little
[5:28] Adso that's right oh my that is so be
[5:32] uncommon of Christian no matter where
[5:35] you are
[5:35] bow your head and pray don't be a shame
[5:39] of him pray anywhere if ever they left
[5:43] that joy
[5:45] whatever weeded out not a root of
[5:48] bitterness remember when a man gets
[5:50] saved here we go when a man gets saved
[5:52] there's this button here becomes
[5:54] eternalized in your heart that is God as
[5:57] you are able
[5:59] here we go to push out all the roots of
[6:01] bitterness then God begins to spread in
[6:05] you then you become a son of God a man
[6:09] was made to be God small G and to be a
[6:13] God did you know that he's in the image
[6:16] of God he's a son of God he is like him
[6:19] he was given my domain Genesis 1:26
[6:22] dominion over the earth that's right he
[6:24] ruled the earth
[6:24] here the animal kingdom all the other
[6:26] king number the kingdom of God above he
[6:29] was God an amateur God because he was
[6:31] image image of God what happened because
[6:34] he disbelieved God's Word it sent him
[6:36] back out of shift for himself no God
[6:39] here we go is trying to get him back and
[6:41] when you have faith and accept him my
[6:44] brother just let that doesn't like begin
[6:46] to grow out and take all the roots of
[6:48] doubts and bitterness yield yourself to
[6:50] the spirit then you become a son of God
[6:53] a daughter of God you begin to grow in
[6:55] the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins
[6:57] the bill is kingdom within you so that's
[7:00] why the Prophet could say make yourself
[7:02] a Christian don't assume you're
[7:05] Christian because it come to church but
[7:06] make yourself a Christian isn't that
[7:09] right so you say brother branham wise is
[7:11] that we do not do the things or then we
[7:14] should do how is it that our gifts and
[7:16] things in a church does not come to its
[7:17] color where we should be how is it our
[7:20] church does lift up into the spot where
[7:22] it should be the people in the testing
[7:25] time drops away like Israel did they
[7:28] think God has left them
[7:30] oh my but remember the rock never left
[7:33] Israel Israel left the rock it forgot
[7:36] about a rock being with them all the
[7:38] time
[7:38] was right there to the end of the road
[7:41] it followed them and that rock is
[7:43] following you
[7:44] not even Gideon knew that God was with
[7:47] him because the people was just beating
[7:50] them out and taking the crops but the
[7:51] Lord came down on television the Lord is
[7:53] with you the Lord is with you then
[7:56] Gideon challenged God if you could be
[7:58] with us where the miracles praise let's
[8:00] have a discussion
[8:01] go glory to God I don't wanna get caught
[8:03] is with me port is with me I want to see
[8:06] the power I want the seed of vindication
[8:08] I want to see the healing power I want
[8:10] to see the liver in power or glory to
[8:13] God and prophets that dealing with a
[8:14] structural man healer scriptural man he
[8:17] said if God is here they talk to the
[8:19] miracles
[8:20] if God is here it cut the how
[8:22] supernatural if God is here they cut to
[8:25] be a manifested reality or give the Lord
[8:28] a shout glory to God yet coming to sit
[8:32] up on your food your coming together God
[8:34] praise and worship Oh hallelujah no
[8:39] glory to God hallelujah hallelujah but
[8:43] remember the rock never left Israel if I
[8:45] left the rock it followed him it wasn't
[8:47] out of speaking distance it wasn't out
[8:50] of here in distance it wasn't out of
[8:52] seeing distance and neither is Christ in
[8:54] the church today some of you have back
[8:57] slid and done thing which is wrong you
[9:00] lost that joy your water is dried up he
[9:02] is still in speaking distance of you he
[9:07] follows you he knows every move you make
[9:11] he was longing to hear you call him on
[9:15] the scene
[9:16] [Applause]
[9:18] he's waitin on you what for he had the
[9:22] cries of my people
[9:26] Libby season do we have done wrong he
[9:30] said this pentecostal moved today God is
[9:31] waiting for you to call him under scene
[9:33] he is waiting for you to get fed up with
[9:36] yourself fed up at your effort set up at
[9:38] yourself determination and your effort
[9:41] in your mind and you're putting on line
[9:42] to do this and that set up and when you
[9:45] get set up for that you can say god I
[9:47] can't do it by myself I will fail again
[9:51] I fail before I will fail again come to
[9:56] cry out unto you O glory to God
[9:59] hallelujah glory to God you let me see
[10:03] that bridge go yellow see you said like
[10:04] a failure but successor like a failure

[10:16] not my power but it's by my spirit and
[10:18] going out to please back to you is that
[10:20] by your money is that by your pocket is

[10:52] or give the Lord a shout in the house
[10:54] that angel only want to see blood but on
[10:57] blood pop them out take them out or move
[11:01] them out but when I see the blood praise
[11:03] what is that blood I can't call it true
[11:06] that blood I have to go all of that
[11:08] blood but even back with ham the blood
[11:11] wash ones Oh God lord have mercy what a
