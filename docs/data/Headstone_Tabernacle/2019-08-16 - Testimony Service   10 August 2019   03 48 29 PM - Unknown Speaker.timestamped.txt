[48:14] you've already don't leave the janitor
[48:17] Oliver likes to invite your reading
[48:19] attention to Genesis chapter 1 verse 8
[48:48] I'm already here anyway chapter 1 verse
[48:59] 26 and God saw that it was good and God
[49:05] said let us make man in our own image in
[49:10] our own likeness and may he have
[49:13] dominion about the fish body birds in
[49:18] the Capitol little katsu and over the
[49:21] entire land and every animal across from
[49:26] the only face of the earth chapter 1
[49:30] verse 8 but you shall receive power the
[49:39] Holy Ghost falling upon you and you
[49:42] shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and
[49:45] all the Judea Samaria and to the
[49:49] uttermost parts of the world
[49:53] may the Lord are his blessings to the
[49:54] reading of his word you may be seated if
[49:58] you will I am precisely here to help the
[50:05] convention and share my testimony we
[50:11] regard the convention with your
[50:14] permission I'd like to say but it was
[50:18] since 2013 I have been building a
[50:21] testimony with regard to the conventions
[50:23] here in Nigeria I have never missed a
[50:26] convention this is special grace from
[50:30] God for me it has not been an easy way
[50:33] an easy way but through God's grace God
[50:38] has given me the privilege to attain
[50:41] every single convention and it is not
[50:45] every time that we can come here
[50:48] that we understand or we make sense out
[50:50] of everything that is being British but
[50:52] whenever I'm here I know I am connected
[50:57] to the burden that I expect in the
[50:59] dynamics may God therefore bless you
[51:04] when I come here it's not based on what
[51:07] I'm going to hear but I just want to be
[51:11] connected to the move of the Spirit it's
[51:14] like yesterday when Pastor channels were
[51:17] ministering I didn't make sense of
[51:21] anything he was saying but I was too
[51:24] blatant with the words it was at the end
[51:29] of the meeting someone called me from
[51:31] Cameroon and interpreted it for me I do
[51:35] believe but that God does not speak
[51:38] English he does not speak French God
[51:42] speaks the language of the heart and it
[51:47] is that Landry that we need to fathoms
[51:48] and it is because of that that we are
[51:51] here to give testimony that God has
[51:54] brought us together for the language of
[51:57] the heart let me give it a topic for the
[52:02] 10 minutes that are ahead of me I'm
[52:04] allowed and I would like to speak or
[52:08] getting and out with power
[52:11] there is no Dominion without being
[52:14] filled or endowed with the power God
[52:19] told Adam you has to have dominion which
[52:26] means he has entrusted the power into
[52:28] the hands of freedom without power it is
[52:31] impossible to have dominion
[52:34] if the pride is ever going to have
[52:37] dominion
[52:38] it means the bride husband and down
[52:40] power virus inspiration of the seven
[52:44] thunders may God bless you abundantly
[52:48] Jesus Christ
[52:52] did not want to leave his church Felina
[52:55] in an orphanage I shall give you power I

[53:11] church I want to tell you tonight that
[53:13] for Jesus Christ
[53:15] did no one to leave his church all the
[53:23] morning forces therefore he said he says
[53:26] bury until you so love the power and God
[53:33] Jesus Christ we saw that there is no
[53:36] power results no other power character
[53:39] and because pow pow vidonne kurata is a
[53:42] panic so he cries himself which are the
[53:58] seven lead voices and so on am i
[54:02] communicating anyway can I have your
[54:05] Lotus amen may I be brushed listen well

[55:11] capstone coming now a man Church before
[55:17] he departed he didn't want to leave the
[55:21] church without power
[55:23] just like Jesus Christ did no one to
[55:27] leave the church powerless a man
[55:29] therefore Jesus Christ
[55:33] he took the power and he and he put it
[55:40] above the bride in the form of promise
[55:45] the promise is for you a man Church and
[55:59] when the Prophet was on the scene with
[56:02] the same vision he didn't want to leave
[56:04] the church without power from a bomb
[56:08] site suggest where 4702 make their
[56:13] voices heard and then my group when that

[1:20:38] missionary to the Madagascar for 23
[1:20:40] years now and I preached in French
[1:20:43] everywhere they will let me get you my
[1:20:47] testimony first you know who I Who am I
[1:20:57] I was I was never a Christian I never
[1:21:02] read the Bible in my life I was born a
[1:21:05] Hindu a Hindu we pray to many gods
[1:21:10] we had many gods and I was born with
[1:21:13] asthma from the 8th from the age of
[1:21:16] three months
[1:21:17] therefore till the age of sixteen and my
[1:21:21] asthma got chronic and I thought I would
[1:21:25] die because I've seen people dying with
[1:21:27] asthma and the age of 16 I turned sour
[1:21:31] against God say there's no God I began
[1:21:35] to read books on atheism French books
[1:21:38] French philosophers and I said there is
[1:21:41] no God and then one day some young
[1:21:43] people came and testifying to my father
[1:21:45] but about Christ I was 16 years old and
[1:21:49] I was coming from school
[1:21:51] I want you listen closely I was coming
[1:21:54] from school palpitating gasping for
[1:21:57] breath and I have and I had a high fever
[1:22:00] and my dad told me that date was 16 May
[1:22:05] 1975 it told me will you go to church
[1:22:07] you know what in my religion I made a
[1:22:10] three oh wow to the gods to be healed of
[1:22:13] asthma and the way that we serve our God
[1:22:17] let me tell you be shocked we walk in
[1:22:19] fire on fire it's blazing hot fire we
[1:22:23] walk barefooted on fire that's how we
[1:22:27] hold our vows to God and we pierce our
[1:22:31] tongue with metal and our body we put
[1:22:35] hooks of metal hang all over with lemons
[1:22:39] hanging and we will walk and barefooted
[1:22:43] on the streets carrying our God instead
[1:22:45] of God carrying me I was carrying God
[1:22:49] I was carrying my god and we we we walk
[1:22:55] on we walk we have to walk on a ladder
[1:23:00] the ladder the rungs of the ladder of
[1:23:02] made of sharpened knives and it was
[1:23:07] devil worship we don't know we thought
[1:23:10] it was it was God
[1:23:11] we had many guards plenty of guards with
[1:23:14] many heads with many hands with ones
[1:23:17] even drinking blood you can see the
[1:23:20] blood coming on because what kind of
[1:23:22] girls are out praying but that day at
[1:23:25] 16th May 1975 when I came home from a
[1:23:28] school night that's it
[1:23:29] will you go to church and say which
[1:23:30] church I said to that church that the
[1:23:33] those young people told talk to us I
[1:23:36] said ok let's go I went there for the
[1:23:38] first time and I was sitting on the
[1:23:39] tenth pew with a short on me I came from
[1:23:42] a school you know 16 years old first
[1:23:45] time introduced to the Bible and the man
[1:23:49] was picking on the prodigal son and I
[1:23:52] was weeping I was crying right there on
[1:23:56] the tenth view I was saying to myself
[1:23:59] which is the book he's reading from
[1:24:01] extracting tears from my eyes and after
[1:24:06] the meeting he called for a prayer line
[1:24:07] I came in front I said when I came my
[1:24:11] turn said young man do you believe in
[1:24:13] mark 16 I looked at him I said mark 16
[1:24:18] I've never read the Bible in my life
[1:24:21] what is mark 60 then he told me they
[1:24:24] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:24:26] shall recover
[1:24:30] he said we said do you believe that I
[1:24:34] remember with this childlike faith
[1:24:36] I never reason I was so against God but
[1:24:40] within a childlike faith I said yes and
[1:24:43] he laid hands on me with a nothing
[1:24:48] stopped right there instantaneously
[1:24:55] and and 44 years later I never got a fit
[1:25:01] of asthma in my leg no never I never
[1:25:08] heard of a testimony of a healing
[1:25:11] I am the testimony for healing myself
[1:25:14] nobody can get an alarm I'm Jesus Christ
[1:25:17] he's today I believe that cuz he healed
[1:25:22] me now listen from that time I began to
[1:25:30] testify our Jesus Christ and I was the
[1:25:34] semi of God may be seated
[1:25:35] o Assembly of God I was a Trinitarian
[1:25:38] and for four years
[1:25:40] listen I want to give must give me that
[1:25:43] time I've taken I've taken I've taken
[1:25:50] three flights to come here now listen to
[1:25:54] her Bridget I don't want to take much of
[1:25:55] your time but please listen to that then
[1:25:57] when I came to the Assembly of God it's
[1:26:00] a four years I got the Holy Ghost
[1:26:01] baptism with the speaking in tongues but
[1:26:04] after four years I felt like something
[1:26:06] is lacking in my life because alone the
[1:26:09] Bible said when the Holy Ghost shall
[1:26:10] come you shall I lead you into all the
[1:26:13] truth but yet that then I knew that our
[1:26:16] I got only the gift not the person of
[1:26:20] the holidays only the gift the need for
[1:26:24] more truth was in my heart I didn't know
[1:26:28] then that it was a deep calling to the
[1:26:30] deeper a little about that and after
[1:26:33] four years
[1:26:35] I left the Assembly of God I went on a
[1:26:39] mountain listen to my testimony I went
[1:26:41] on a mountain for one month but I would
[1:26:44] come down every every night I was
[1:26:46] working in an insurance company I would
[1:26:49] walk down every night about midnight
[1:26:51] come home after one month of Prayer
[1:26:53] listen to me
[1:26:54] November 1978 where the Fox Allah pika
[1:26:57] who knew refika those French people know
[1:27:01] him he is the one who did the
[1:27:03] translation in French he came from
[1:27:05] Switzerland and he Britt and he brought
[1:27:06] the message but I was now and left there
[1:27:09] 70 Oh God I was now sour
[1:27:12] I said ways the truth now some young
[1:27:16] people went to the meeting over the
[1:27:18] Francois Latika he was playing the 8
[1:27:20] millimeter film of the Prophet in black
[1:27:22] and white
[1:27:23] then those young people came he said you
[1:27:26] know what we have only been baptized the
[1:27:30] true baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:27:31] Jesus Christ and as a prophet who came
[1:27:34] to this world there's only one God
[1:27:36] because I was a Trinitarian I bet I do
[1:27:39] what listen to them let's go and look I
[1:27:42] said I don't want to go you because I
[1:27:44] refuse the message of the hour somebody
[1:27:48] came from India he's from South Africa
[1:27:51] Durban Durban natal he was travelling
[1:27:55] from India to go back to his country
[1:27:57] city felt led by God to stop over in
[1:28:00] Mauritius and the strange thing about 75
[1:28:06] churches of the Assembly of God he came
[1:28:09] to where I was look how God when he came
[1:28:14] to me we have were setting one night he
[1:28:18] said I'm looking for young people who
[1:28:20] like to play guitar and go and preach on
[1:28:22] the streets that what I was doing
[1:28:24] I'm a guitar player for 25 years old to
[1:28:27] play violin I play guitar I go on the
[1:28:29] street and I play where they are taking
[1:28:32] marijuana they are putting hearing in
[1:28:36] the blood I will be praying for them
[1:28:39] while while they are taking hearing in
[1:28:41] the blood pudding
[1:28:42] the blood pudding in the hearing I was
[1:28:46] there praying for them if the police
[1:28:47] will come there I will be locked in
[1:28:49] prison but how bold I was to deceive him
[1:28:53] now when he said when you met with us
[1:28:57] though young who went to see the film of
[1:29:00] the Prophet they just nudge me like I
[1:29:02] said ask him about the baptism in the
[1:29:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I seem
[1:29:06] about the Prophet asked him about one
[1:29:08] God I said let me alone then because
[1:29:11] they were insisting I asked the man his
[1:29:14] name is AD judgment he's a colored
[1:29:18] brother from South Africa I said can you
[1:29:20] tell me about the baptism in the name
[1:29:22] Lord Jesus Christ about one God he
[1:29:25] jumped from his J he said I came here
[1:29:29] for that but but but I was afraid
[1:29:33] chabela I was afraid to introduce this
[1:29:36] machine when your what happened because
[1:29:38] I turned my back on the message that
[1:29:40] many true Jews me to the UPC the
[1:29:44] Pentecost the oneness Pentecostal church
[1:29:46] and our I pastored that this this church
[1:29:49] for nine years I was a superintendent of
[1:29:53] the Pentecostal church for nine years I
[1:29:56] had four churches and I went in the boat
[1:30:00] and I did the missions work in in the
[1:30:04] island of Rodrigues where I put a church
[1:30:06] there and I went to Madagascar and the
[1:30:08] eighth in 1982 my son was two days old
[1:30:13] first September if Friday I left my son
[1:30:16] two days all I went to Madagascar you
[1:30:19] know why to preach against the message
[1:30:21] for nine years I thought the message
[1:30:25] because the message was a threat to me
[1:30:27] because in the UPC where I was
[1:30:30] we were preaching holiness we were
[1:30:33] preaching
[1:30:33] sisters will have long dresses not TV in
[1:30:37] the homes we were preaching about you
[1:30:40] know one God but I didn't know about the
[1:30:42] way about baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:30:45] Christ we were preaching all that they
[1:30:48] were I talk about elliptical I said you
[1:30:50] have come here for nothing what about
[1:30:52] the superlative you know what I did I
[1:30:54] - a man in Canada his name is aw post he

[1:31:01] fiction
[1:31:02] I got that my quantities I would give it
[1:31:05] to the people just to fight the message
[1:31:07] and I pulled people out of the message I
[1:31:10] pulled my own wife out of the message I
[1:31:13] pull pastors out of the message that's
[1:31:16] what I did for nine years fighting the
[1:31:19] message and let me tell you nobody can
[1:31:22] fight this message this message is not
[1:31:29] from man is from God
[1:31:32] it's a God sent message they were one
[1:31:38] when I thought the message I got
[1:31:41] schizophrenia one of the worst cases of
[1:31:44] depression I went through three times
[1:31:47] out of six times electroshock therapy
[1:31:50] and my brother who works in psychiatry
[1:31:54] in London he told me that they had been
[1:31:57] banished from from from from UK because
[1:32:00] one of it might make you crazy forever
[1:32:02] and you make six times six times therapy

[1:34:49] who can change your life less there is a
[1:34:53] message book I don't know how it is in
[1:34:55] English a message book from this time

[1:35:26] how important it is it's not coming here
[1:35:29] to meet with one another that's fine and
[1:35:32] dandy but we are here for one purpose to
[1:35:34] be with him and that would be the change
[1:35:37] in fact I met with him and it changed my
[1:35:41] life my life was changing it when I came

[1:42:57] going to end the meeting I want you to
[1:43:00] listen carefully to the coat problems
[1:43:03] here that when you went to the sensor
[1:43:08] mounted we said the angel when they came
[1:43:11] and they opened the Bible see the Bible
[1:43:14] became a new Bible paragraph 43 of feast
[1:43:20] of the trumpets he said the Bible became
[1:43:23] a new Bible from that time because I was
[1:43:26] doing so much wrong to the people of
[1:43:29] other message God showed me in the
[1:43:32] scripture people would tell me away the
[1:43:35] name of a Branham in the scripture but
[1:43:37] this is not my turn to do that now I can
[1:43:41] bring you to many scriptures and fill
[1:43:43] the name of William Branham in the
[1:43:45] scripture
[1:43:45] I began God began to open my mind and
[1:43:49] I've seen many stories in the Acts of
[1:43:52] the Apostles acts 12 acts 27 acts 8
[1:43:57] there is a story of brother Branham
[1:43:59] writing in those chapters in many places
[1:44:04] God like brought me to my mind with I
[1:44:08] was a fighter against that message how
[1:44:11] God has to kind of ground my face with
[1:44:17] truths from the Bible that this message
[1:44:21] has its imprint in the whole Bible from
[1:44:25] Genesis to Revelation they will listen
[1:44:29] to one of them I'm closing with that the
[1:44:35] battle became a new book my wife used to
[1:44:38] teach Sunday School they were he will
[1:44:40] get this story about Christ multiplying
[1:44:45] two fishes and five laws he will do some
[1:44:48] flannelgraph
[1:44:49] with the children and six months after
[1:44:53] if she does the same teaching he will
[1:44:56] come up with the same stone
[1:44:58] Jesus Christ to fire laws and fire bread
[1:45:01] and two fishes you know and then one two
[1:45:03] years later if she had to relive the
[1:45:05] same story she will come up with the
[1:45:07] same thing again Jesus Christ to farm
[1:45:09] laws and two fishes but who is the
[1:45:11] message of the hour the vine will have
[1:45:14] become a new Bible when I was reading
[1:45:18] the same story now in the light of the
[1:45:21] message of the hour
[1:45:22] I saw something that hit my mind Christ
[1:45:26] told him go and get some food we said oh
[1:45:29] how can we procure bread in a desert say
[1:45:33] no no they have been with me for three
[1:45:35] days
[1:45:35] they won't be able to get back home it
[1:45:39] strength they will lack strength on
[1:45:40] their way home they won't be able to get
[1:45:43] back home they have been with me for
[1:45:45] three days and then I saw from there
[1:45:48] that the message of Lucia of Wesley of
[1:45:53] Pentecost those three days won't be able
[1:45:56] to bring yourself back home we need
[1:46:00] another type of bread we need bread from
[1:46:04] the Masters him he had to break the
[1:46:07] bread the seals had to be opened the
[1:46:10] bringing of the season that no ensure
[1:46:13] our way back home with the message of
[1:46:16] Luther Wesley and Pentecost we could all
[1:46:19] get back home we would have been fallen
[1:46:22] along the way with God through the hands
[1:46:25] of the master the hands of Christ the
[1:46:28] book was in his right hand and you
[1:46:31] appendices we the book open with a bread
[1:46:33] being broken from the hands of the
[1:46:35] master now we can be sure that we can
[1:46:39] reach home with the open book now the
[1:46:44] Bible has become a new book if it went
[1:46:48] Christ we read about the story of Christ
[1:46:51] walking on the sea when I read the
[1:46:53] message I begin to look for every time
[1:46:55] where bronto about he walks on the sea
[1:46:57] he said but he told them to go and he
[1:47:01] went is it you went on the mountains and
[1:47:03] began to pray can you know some English
[1:47:07] and he began to pray on the mountain one
[1:47:09] said he one day look what his head in
[1:47:13] the ramparts of glory said he was
[1:47:16] interceding for the church that was
[1:47:19] going through the sea it was the church
[1:47:22] going through seven Church ages it
[1:47:25] reached a point where it were ten
[1:47:27] thousand devils swore to drown them it
[1:47:31] was the age of Laodicea it was total
[1:47:34] darkness on the sea then he left glory
[1:47:40] he knew not he had to live glory he he
[1:47:44] left there and he came with supernatural
[1:47:47] sign he walked on the sea when he walked
[1:47:50] on to see in the dark Laodicea where ten
[1:47:54] thousand ever saw to drown them he came
[1:47:57] in the fourth wake of the night because
[1:48:01] it's in the fourth seal that the Eagle
[1:48:04] anointing came the folks he represent
[1:48:07] the church out loud this year they knew
[1:48:09] that the Foxes the shuttle yuneisia
[1:48:11] that's where God sent the Eagle
[1:48:15] anointing to fight that pale horse the
[1:48:18] cost never had a name before but in the
[1:48:20] fourth seal in the seventh church age
[1:48:22] where God will get to send the Eagle
[1:48:25] anointing to the prophet of the hour
[1:48:28] then he was called death like those ten
[1:48:32] thousand Iblis who swore to kill the man
[1:48:35] Christ had to come from the ramparts of
[1:48:37] glory walked on the sea and when they
[1:48:41] saw now the lightning striking he was
[1:48:44] the same Jesus but in another fall the
[1:48:48] sand Jesus but and more faith they were
[1:48:52] a friendship he's of course he said no
[1:48:55] I'm ready cuz I am he like today we I
[1:48:59] was afraid o
[1:49:01] the message of the hour yet God sent
[1:49:03] brother branham get sent this message to
[1:49:07] sell my life from the time of Laodicea
[1:49:10] he was coming Gino is not a ghost
[1:49:13] it is I
[1:49:15] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:49:17] that's them that's how I saw that the
[1:49:20] Bible became a new book in the light of
[1:49:25] the message of the hour
[1:49:27] even when Christ was 12 years old my mum
[1:49:30] said he one day and the father and the
[1:49:32] mother left him for three days
[1:49:35] the one problem said those three days
[1:49:37] represent the days of Luther Wesley and
[1:49:39] the Pentecost they had to go back to
[1:49:43] Christ he said he was it was God in his
[1:49:47] humanity he had took they have to go bad
[1:49:51] God in his humanity and that's what
[1:49:54] happened in God has appeared on the
[1:49:56] scene again I don't want to hurt you but
[1:50:01] I believe that William Branham is not
[1:50:04] God I don't believe in the deity
[1:50:07] doctrine I don't believe in that but I
[1:50:10] believe that he was prepared from the
[1:50:13] youth from the age of seven don't smoke
[1:50:17] don't drink don't define your body I've
[1:50:20] got a great work to do I believe that he
[1:50:23] came at the time in his ministry where
[1:50:27] Ellen wasn't ashamed to come and inhabit
[1:50:31] that veil the trying to turn his back to
[1:50:35] the paper it was held him in flesh it
[1:50:38] was God in human form again it will God
[1:50:43] behind the screams again the winner
[1:50:47] that's the power of this message and I
[1:50:51] promise I read a quote a hen over to my
[1:50:55] posture but listen to the court I'm
[1:50:59] reading the court to bless someone if
[1:51:03] someone can be blessed by the call it's
[1:51:06] fine and dandy with me because that
[1:51:08] message is full of promises if you're
[1:51:12] sick there's no need for you to go back
[1:51:14] home sick there's enough power enough
[1:51:19] healing power healing anointing in that
[1:51:22] word of the hour he said there's a
[1:51:26] scripture of the Bible she won't read at
[1:51:28] home Tom said we have had the speed of
[1:51:32] power sound mind I learned when I was
[1:51:40] Pentecost when I read this stirred a
[1:51:42] spirit of fear but of power I will say
[1:51:46] hallelujah
[1:51:47] but the scripture continues he said be
[1:51:50] down therefore because of the speed of
[1:51:54] power a wisdom of sound mind now I give
[1:51:59] the reason why God gave you that be down
[1:52:02] under for ashamed to give testimony to
[1:52:07] the Lord but the verse continues neither
[1:52:11] of me therefore we have had the spirit
[1:52:15] of power of some mind to testify of
[1:52:19] Jesus Christ Paul was not trying to
[1:52:22] downgrade Jesus he said to testify about
[1:52:25] him but also of me his prisoner he knew
[1:52:30] that the gospel is reaching the word he
[1:52:33] was preaching didn't come from him
[1:52:35] delicious 1:11 he caught it by
[1:52:38] revelation whatever I was preaching not
[1:52:40] from a man not from a school of theology
[1:52:43] it came from God but it do not be
[1:52:45] ashamed to testify a Christ but neither
[1:52:49] of me Paul and I feel tonight
[1:52:52] I lost Paul were the first messenger
[1:52:56] prophet of the Omega Brian of the Alpha
[1:52:59] brain
[1:53:00] I believe that the Prophet he was the
[1:53:02] one chosen for the Omega bride and as
[1:53:05] Paul will tell them don't be ashamed to
[1:53:08] justify of me I will tell you don't be
[1:53:12] ashamed to justify or William running
[1:53:15] and I'll show you why
[1:53:17] I'll show you why I read the quote a
[1:53:21] lady in my church it's enough I'm
[1:53:24] closing she would never listen to me
[1:53:26] just now and said to me he said a lady
[1:53:29] in my church brother Bill or mrs. Webber
[1:53:33] she was dying with TV she was in the
[1:53:38] sanatorium

[1:53:42] stages they sent her home to die say
[1:53:48] this nothing could be done for her mrs.

[1:53:56] just beyond the tabernacle and she had a
[1:53:59] God five or six little children so so

[1:54:08] night and said go tell mrs. Weber and
[1:54:14] tell mr. Weber rather to get things

[2:08:15] as you leave here I would like you to
[2:08:18] just make your way straight to catch
[2:08:20] some food and because we lost one hour
[2:08:26] we went to give back the hour again so
[2:08:29] the door we opened by instead of six
[2:08:33] o'clock it will be by 6:30 and service
[2:08:35] Vista by seven o'clock praise to remain
[2:08:39] I mean there's an effort that's been
[2:08:43] made by our brother here and this is the
[2:08:47] only belief very beautiful hymn book
[2:08:53] that we out there
[2:08:55] praise God Amin and and here is also a
[2:09:01] kind of like an almanac with all the
[2:09:06] whole picture not an expression but of
[2:09:11] all the whatever and I was giving this
[2:09:16] brotherly testimony of how God he did
[2:09:19] this many years ago as a we're of
[2:09:22] evangelism and there is something I
[2:09:25] spoke to him he didn't know about it
[2:09:27] I didn't ask him to bring this but I
[2:09:30] believe that this can really be
[2:09:32] something and I can really tune you on
[2:09:35] to the Lord and I remember my mother if
[2:09:40] you can give me two minutes
[2:09:41] my mother was so sick so sick to death
[2:09:45] and I was praying to God I will drive
[2:09:48] along the way I will talk and I will
[2:09:50] start to cry to God don't you hear the
[2:09:53] cry of my mother and torchon healer and
[2:09:56] God gave me a sign and then and I asked
[2:10:01] God again I said if really you are real
[2:10:05] as my mother would go
[2:10:08] I would like you to use - that is let us
[2:10:12] her go and be an encouragement to me and
[2:10:15] one day we came back from Sunday's from
[2:10:18] from from church on a Sunday and my
[2:10:21] mother was so sick and God healed her
[2:10:24] she got well again
[2:10:27] praise God a man but that was not enough
[2:10:32] after about you know some months after
[2:10:37] her healing and God showed me a dream
[2:10:41] and I saw her just moving and she was
[2:10:44] looking more like a teen you know twenty
[2:10:49] years or lady and I prayed a prayer I
[2:10:54] said lord if you want to take my mother
[2:10:57] home
[2:10:57] let her be an encouragement to me it
[2:11:01] sure has something that she will speak
[2:11:04] to me that will encourage me in this
[2:11:06] message and then there is one of these
[2:11:09] that I left it was only the stutter of
[2:11:11] the perfect man and that was in her room
[2:11:15] so when we came back that Sunday she
[2:11:18] called me and my wife and then she she
[2:11:22] said she pointing at the start of a
[2:11:24] perfect man I said son I want to thank
[2:11:27] you so much for bringing this message to
