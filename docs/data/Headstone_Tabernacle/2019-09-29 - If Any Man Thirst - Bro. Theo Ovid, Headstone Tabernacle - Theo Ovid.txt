to come as the psalmist David said was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord and last week's Sunday we had no service the storm on something and something came to me this morning you know sometimes something something's come up unexpected that interrupts your life interruption program it always happens and you have to be prepared you have to be ready that's what they come to service for to have that confidence in God and trust in God and you trust him not when things going smooth and he's been fine you trust him when things seem to had went wrong that is where this fray of trust to go a lot I trust you I told understand what's happening but I trust you hallelu have confidence that you can make it to work right that's how we must have it this morning amen

God a merry a man blessed be the name of Lord it feels so good in here this morning it's such a blessing to be here you know I feel like today's our specialty and it has nothing to do with me because he said we're the tools and trees are gathered together in his name there he is in the midst of life and you are here and God is here and I believe we'll be tremendously blessed this morning okay if you have your Bibles I'd like you to turn with me it's a simple scripture a simple thought I have some words that I hope could be put together by Holy Spirit this morning so we could be blessed and the scriptures Hebrews 11 verse 6 when you find it you could see him and he found it but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him may bar heads over the FIR Oh Heavenly Father this morning we so grateful for your love Lord we so thankful for your grace and your mercy towards us slowly thank you for this opportunity to be gathered together in this way Lord Lord I pray that today be a special service lord I pray that we've come and expectation and our expectations will be met Lord Lord I pray that you strengthen the weak among us Lord Lord I pray that she would be with everyone that would hear this service lord over the internet connected to us right now who may see it afterwards Lord Lord this sick and afflicted a prayer to be healed I played don't try to be lifted up and raise up Lord Lord I pray those that have a doubtful and backslidden lore that would restore them Lord restore their joy Lord restore their peace Lord restore the strength and courage I pray that you be with me this morning Lord anoint my lips Lord Lord I pray that you take full control over everything that I would say everything that is spoken here this morning Lord and for the remaining of this service Lord Lord you know these thoughts on my heart Lord Lord you know the feeling that I have I pray that you will match it together like a puzzle Lord Lord that it will be a blessing it will not just be good words and and and and lower just was strong together Lord but it could be meaningful and sincere Lord I pray that we could act upon it Lord and take it to heart I prayed I could find good ground so to just be made into a manifestation Lord in Jesus name we pray amen give the Lord a hand of praise you may have your seats if you don't know by now this is probably most nervous I've ever been in my life but honest thank God anyhow and I want to thank but Oviatt for the faith that he has to ask me to share a couple words this morning so with that in mind I want to read a quote from the Prophet and it's not so much a title but the thought is this faith is a word but to have faith requires work it requires that we do something that we act right and if I were to have an inspiration it would be what is your excuse or there should be no excuses for lack of action right so I take my reference from a message is your life worthy of the gospel and in their reading from 37 he says when God sent Noah this event and Meeta we have of an escape for all the people who wanted to be saved but the people only laughed and scorned that Noah but God made the way but they had an excuse it wasn't according to their mother thinking it didn't it wasn't the way they wanted it so they made excuses in the day of Noah they made excuses in the day of Moses they made excuses an idea of Elijah they made excuses in the day of Christ and they make excuses today now if Israel 2,000 years ago would accept the invitation that He will give him there wouldn't be as they are today 2,000 years ago Israel tuned on the invitation to come to the wedding supper they turned it down and went into judgment but as Jesus said they stone and kill the prophets that was sent to them by making excuses now the excuses that he made in each day and said Jesus was trying to tell them that the excuses was what kill the prophets and what kill the righteous are come they accepted their Creed's that men had given them instead of taking the word of God and by doing so had would have got of no effect now in the day of Noah as we could recall God spoke to Noah he didn't speak to everybody he didn't speak to the people he spoke to Noah and give Noah a promise direct direct to Noah Noah this is what is required of you I want you to do XY and Z I want you to warn the people preach to the people build an ark I want you to use this type of wood these are the dimensions I want you to listen to me now Noah had to have a lot of faith because if you're reading the scripture rain had never fallen before so this was an unusual phenomenon this is something you had to believe that this is God speaking to you so I can act upon it amen in this case he had to be so convinced right because he may have been seen and thought of as a madman to be preaching year after year soon when after Silman week after week month after month that this thing that had never been done before was about to take place but further to that he has a requirement to build a boat now this was not cruise ship this was not yacht this was not pair up this was an efficient boot but it sealed a specific purpose and he had to listen to God's Word in order to bring that into fruition in doing so he took the most porous wood he could find gopher wood correct and he pictured inside and outside I'm not telling anything strange you know all these things already but it's just a bulletin in my heart so sharing it again adventures for such a time as this and somebody would be blessed now in this case when he did that that we might say that is a great manifestation of his faith not only is he saying it but he's doing something about it but there's something else that happened very significant even after he built the boats he had to take the animals inside so it's one thing to say I'm preaching here 1 year 2 year 3 snow manifestation yeah hundred yeah 115 might have feel tired at that point but you still after building the ark had to put the animals inside now the point of significance was when going to shut the door now at that point it makes the whole story and you whole journey almost irrelevant to the people because they had a hundred and twenty years to come into action to do something about the message he had heard to do something about these seeds that were planted in their hearts they had this window to come a hundred and twenty years to come along with the message that Noah had making no excuses and coming inside and God shut the door and they would have been fine brother branham said even left a window at the top in case no I wanted to change his mind in cases sure and wanted to change their mind in case they wanted to look back like like Lot's wife and walk back away now can you just imagine for a second I just want you to think in your mind right now if you were one of no one's children so you heard the message he preached it to you you worked alone you've seen what was happening you saw he built the boot you're probably assisted in building the boots you're reaching point where you saw the animals come in and for some reason you decided on that particular day you know what I feel so tired now I feel so disappointed that I have been here I have one of our monitor founding members when no one started his ministry 120 years ago I was there I listened to every message he had I perhaps fellowship with him we ate together but at this time I feeling so tired I think I stay at home I think I go in by my cousin I think I'm going to work I think I've got to do something else that listen to this is more important than sticking by faith to the promise that was left by God now you tell me how would you have felt when you looked at this door and you said Noah open unto me this door we could long time I am one of the ancient men I'm one of your good friends I am one of those who started the journey together with you in that case there's nothing Noah could do for you there's nothing you would of God could have done for you at that point no matter how much prayer and fast no matter how much you sacrifice your turn only part no matter what you tried at that point your opportunity was gone forever now in looking at the scripture I realized there there's different types of faith as you know you know brother Branham one time he referenced dingy feet logical fate when the lepers decided to go out I'm not going to stick on that one but I'm looking at there was a man who had a special need he needed to be healed anybody needs to be healed this morning he needed to be healed and there was a time in which the angel would come and strongly waters right still he waters up and he had no man to put him in for 38 years year after year he would come I could well imagine he wouldn't take a bus and reach he might have journeyed every year knowing that at this particular time the angel was gonna trouble the water no this to me is paradoxical because he could not go in himself yet he had faith knowing based on experience seeing year after year this is something I was seeking please he had sufficient faith to go yes after you can you imagine the year that Jesus walked by Jesus what wasn't walking by the pool you know he was working on another Street so far that that man was told Jesus can't hear you know when he said o son of David have mercy on me Jesus could mean he aim physically from where he was but he had such a faith they said and the scripture said he cried all the more so he cried as loud as he could as he physically could because he was desperate enough and had sufficient faith to know that God keeps his promises all the time in this case can you just imagine I want you imagine with me for a second if this is the year he decided you know what is a long time I do in this year perhaps I need to try something else perhaps I need to go somewhere else perhaps I need to stay home and pray perhaps I need to stay and fast I need to do something different I need to do something else and he after 37 years decided to stay home oh he decided you know what does every year coming and every year hi again true so you know what I just go in half way at least they will say a pass through no the first person to enter is a person that would get the blessing where they have to be healed delivered sealed whatever it was was the first right so that that's the trouble with a lot of us today we know the promises we know what the Prophet said we know what he would said and we say we have faith and I probably wouldn't get to it now but Vera Bram said you know 99% of people say they have people what you have is hope the hope that it will be healed hope that they'll be delivered they'll hold out that they'll be set free so they come sometimes within the presence of the Lord where anything is possible and the miraculous could take place and still defeat fail a little bit because they wonder if today is really my day I want to give you one more example before I close and it's the way that Jesus operates you know we see many many examples throughout the Bible and one of the things he does he gives us examples and tests and trials and challenges and training because he's leading us to something or he want us to pass a particular test so disciples one time he stood with their money said you know what Philip these pictures of water and the water was turned into wine well now he said what do you have to eat five loaves to fish sprint blessed it give it now all the while they were walking with him they saw miracles they sought the miraculous take place Peter when he saw Jesus on the water he said if you bit me come out come you know what I walk with you long enough to know that this is not a test this is reality and I have faith enough to respond to your call and if you were to tell me come he could have tried to convey he said if you bid me come I will come and he went out so they had enough examples and if enough experience to believe that if God seemed to do this do it right so Jesus he came to that man he said listen I want you to hurry in Jerusalem until you be endued apart even tell tell'em I want you go to a convention or want you to go and pray and fast for three days of our weekend no you see I want you to Terry Terry is not a quick thing and I'll given it that definition now but but it's not a touch-and-go thing you don't sorry for a minute and Terry for five minutes Terry suggests that you have a strong desire to be patient and we'd pull in fast to the promise that was given to you and in that case the scripture would say that they tarried and after 50 days so can you imagine the instruction was to Terry and after one month you say hey we're going on brothers I understand he - let's hurry and we we appreciate your ministry but we have notes that could've happened you know but can you imagine on the 40th year Terry and I realize like there was a man one time Jesus could be parable you say there was a king who a son about to be married and he sent some invitations out I do it me and he said he give the invitations and one by one one of them said hey you know what here my excuse is a good one I bought a new piece of land overlooking the ocean right and I really want to see what happening with it because it had a storm watch last week so I want to make sure it's still in order right now as his excuse another one say you know I bought some livestock some capital and stuff and from what I hear the economy oil not working too good at this stage it look like somebody else they can you in fact finery so I want to diversify and invest in capital I want to check it out to make sure I don't know I know everybody seems have excuses and you know what Jesus said you say the king will not have his wedding supper empty he knows that if you don't accept it he will find people willing unable to accept it the invitation is to whosoever will he can take the drunkard the backslidden the smoker the adulterer before Nikita whoever he choose because he wants his table to be filled so in that time they made excuses and what it was unable to be real recipients of the blessings of God so coming back to the Upper Room can you imagine after month on almost half your terrian you pray in your fasting is singing and worshiping you're just thanking God very promise because Jesus left such a awesome promise and you saw and he passed what he was able to do so you believe in his word and you believe in his promise yet you feel weary and tired you feel like a disco I feel halfway you just want to stroll into church any old time you want to stroll into church annual attitude no matter what song you sing in half we you want to dress and you allow no respects you want to answer back the deacons and the ushers I want to operate your own way because you feel oh gosh you know how all how long I hear you can't tell me anything and it becomes so average it becomes so normal you show up only on a Sunday morning Wednesday night it just seems so far but you could make it on Sun Leia you could make it to cricket down in the state stadium wherever it is you could make it to the cousin who having to get together in Tobago or wherever you want to go it just shows priority right so the same way I know we don't like to say it like that we don't like to admit it like like that but really what you're really doing is is making other things priority and in plain and simple terms what you're doing is making excuses now for minute I also want you to think if God were to see in secret that this morning I want to trouble the water right and you see those people who come out this morning under expectation to be filled and healed and delivered he want to grant them the desire of their heart what would your attitude be getting ready this morning how the John's will you come to service what will be probably saw in your heart we heard better Raymond Thompson a few weeks ago preacher we should enter the sanctuary and we should come to show how much more those of us who he promises and know he promises like like Noah year after year months after months week after week day after day we know what I said we know what is promised we know he promised a revival and we know the preacher can't bring a revival but we not initiate and revival at whom we not initiate and revival in the car where we are we still satisfy to quarrel with our brother and sister and to get back Sun upset we're still unforgiving we still hall & oates know what would your attitude be if you realize that right now within the next five minutes he will grant any desire of your heart how much more desperate you will become knowing that it didn't matter what you did last night or watching it last week or last month's but you delimit you now to be and you can receive anything you want today that's what faith does but faith is just a world if we don't put it into action if we don't act upon it and if he don't see like the scripture said he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him so when it's harried in the upper room they were diligently seeking him seeking his space seeking his voice not seeking his kingdom you know just recently has talked interpret and he say you know God give a solution for everything you say if you want a new car what you have to do if you want misalign you want a new house you want to raise the pay on the promotion you say seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all things all things shall be added so what that tells me is when I decide and we heard a preacher of a million times I'm gonna stay home this week oh no because I have an exam coming up I'm going to stay home this week because and you City because I want you to think for a minute I told her brother recently and he laughs and I said I say I didn't see a intentional you say boy and you started and say hold up don't tell me the excuse don't get me the excuse you have to tell me tell at the divorce tell me boss I was flannery and I don't know and a rich woman I thought whatever the excuses you tell him and if it's good enough for him it's good enough for me you don't want to tell me you're with me that's the way God operates he rewards them that diligently seek Him you see he knows the thoughts and intents of your so he knows if you want to be there you will be there yeah let me give you your last one before I go because I'm making myself in trouble you know I often say we do what we want people do what they want if I were to tell you here's what going on I want two persons a buying a plane ticket to them for for them to anyway in the world as a matter of fact the tickets are paid for all I want you to do is pack your bags and reach the airport by hairy challenge the flight is 6:00 a.m. you need to reach three hours before it's because a transatlantic flight right so any to reach 3 a.m. you board and you go have a have a good vacation the question is how much people will reach it the garage 3:00 a.m. you went to one o'clock you understand why because the place priority and believe it's important for them to do it now think fast second that's a trip that will come and go that's a trip here you might enjoy these sites but it's temporary imagine you have a father who is king that makes me royalty right that makes you royalty right so your father who is king say listen hear what I send these instructions because I want you to qualify to pass my tests you know I don't think any father wants a children to fail so you send them to school Bible say under tutors and governors so they can be prepared to graduate right so God wants you to be prepared to graduate because how could we sit and say you know we want to have Raptor and fate we want to go to the rapture and the prophetess but but you could barely a feed for divine healing remember you want your pass so in order to pass you have to give your steps he gave David a bear and a lion because Goliath was coming here with me he go

of my tribe but here what if you be God meet the sweat if you be God knoweth no adhirata but adventure dies by chance of coincidence make a dragon and it will and because he's see he could believe that when God say and was just over 300 just go at 300 I have the victory already right so that does do where we are when we look back and we see Vietnam that Isis I heard you right two boys because she said the right thing okay look look fish epic life wait a minute these are examples before us we know that was a real test these are examples before us because the real test is coming I am here to say the real test is coming and the real testers are words as a fit test to see if after 120 years if after 38 years if after 15 years just still believed enough to have the attitude and desperation and urgency to stick to the promise without making excuses and then you will see the Word of God manifested in your life that's how success and victory and deliverance and healing and Ceylon could come into your life god bless you all three the Lord in Oh hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah my son [Music] leave me know I all of you have gone [Music] [Applause]

one two three as the heart panted after the water Brooks so panted my soul of the day Oh God my soul twisted for God for the Living God when shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually see unto me where is thy God sin John 7 verse 37 in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the Spirit which they should believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified revelation 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come let him that heareth say come let him desert is come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely let us pray father we thank you for your word today and I pray that you which circumcise our hearts to receive your word circumcise my lips to speak your word take me out of the way and their presence coming on your world and minister to your people in Jesus I ask it amen you may be seated praise God other title If any man test I have a question for you our utility well Julie Williams called me after a service last week and he was trying to remind me of a dream that he had his dream I think was over 30 years ago and I turn right to me and that season was Pope must been preached and in the dream there was two passenger buses that was about to leave Cairo so this is about in the early eighties also in between decreases for at that time we were worship in at that location and there was a serious feast bus conductor this is a dream now more serious than than angry who came in checking for tickets this board about her solemnity among the passengers so at that time the inspiration was fishing buddy token and this Ana dream was two buses and the conductor was looking for tickets and this brought about a solemnity among the passengers again I remember the seriousness of his expression I can't remember the passengers of tickets or not I myself had something in my hand but I was not sure it was a ticket a sister who was closely because by examine exclaimed to me that I had it when she saw what was in my hand however when the conductor reached to my seat still serious-looking he told me tell ability on this scripture who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place he'd have had clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity sworn deceitfully tell him that and he was telling me don't forget that I will never forget the seriousness of that conductor and also does some Lemna t upon the people it reminds of what a very poor testimony of witness in the image of the Lord when his father woke him up to see which left an indelible mark on his life that's the dream but over thus best I can remember may God bless you and so on like that isn't that something and there was no stranger I got a message who shall ascend unto the hill of the Lord and it's it's really something it's my book like to some people but really I'm surely it didn't sink we'll go to church maybe who would see the need that they have to go and meet the Lord and climb and be blessed and be cluded and be anointed amen if any man tis okay let's go Hosea 4:6 says my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because there was rejected knowledge I will also reject thee and thou shalt be no priest to me seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God I will also forget that children Deuteronomy 29:29 the secret thing belongs and the law over God but those things that are revealed belonging to us and taught children that we may do the words of his law forever knowledge is important knowledge is vital now the job you have to have some knowledge that is why the employer lawyers are lawyers because you are paying them for the knowledge that they have if you know what they know then you could t try your own case you could manage your own Keys so what a lawyer hire a lawyer you hire them because of the knowledge that they have and before you know about God you have to get the knowledge of God you have to know what he is what he stands for what he unfolds so knowledge is important it's not right to be successful you have to have knowledge hallelujah a fool can have much success because the fool doesn't know and the problem with people that they they don't know what they don't know so a lot of people know but they don't know what they don't know and what you don't know is more important than you know so you need to know and you want to know so Jesus money came he say learn of me and always you have to be taught because you don't know you have heard in times past it the enemy but I see unto you I'm bringing a new knowledge to you I'm bringing a new understanding to you and bringing a new word to you you need to know this because you don't know this oh you're thirteen times past you are 13 times past but I say unto you so he brought the I see unto you and the I see unto you is what you don't know because what you have birth is what we had in times past but you meet or know what do you say now or committing the Lord appraised offering hallelujah glory to God Amen so when people don't study and they don't learn and they don't grow because the learn is the really girl The Crow is to learn they get and I want to think about it something like that knowledge knowledge based upon ignorance knowledge based upon ESC only pink and what people feel it's a level of ignorance on the subject or the topic or what you're talking about so then people who are married talking to people not married for advice and counsel the personal marriage can only get that knowledge they don't have they do have the experience they'll have the qualification somebody who have doing my bank account when they give advice and money they don't even buy bank I didn't have a credit cat they know he has a comp open but it cannot tell you about money a priesthood on Mary when I give concerts on married people what kind of knowledge the given it's not the correct knowledge so you have to have the channel to bring the right knowledge or right information or glory love god somebody like gossip they like they gossip and and Nibiru love the gossip so if you like to hear the snippets have always are people written to offload they bring the garbage truck and the press back rivers and the whole thing just raise up like that and they drop it on you because the Lord would stuff smelly stuff stinky stuff all stuff stuff about other people are not the word because I forget the word you're saying one that go off Lord take that dump somewhere else that gossip somewhere else get that all talks somewhere else Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God no there's a reason I'm saying this little I'm gonna say mr. signature of thing y'know peanut not shootin admit there's a reason for this you know becoming under something you wanna completely foolish visions or Chloe Dakota you will be a foolish person will not come back to them because they don't know what they don't know before this presents a foolish and I foolish they think they're smart they thought they were all right yes the thing the smart but they know is it not hallelujah what they don't know it become the downfall so you want to know let's let's continue hallelujah knowledge is information understanding is Crespin and so on and comprehending that information and wisdom is knowing what to do with that knowledge so if wisdom is the principal thing you have to start by knowledge the trans wisdom you know nothing Oh glory to God hallelujah or glory knowledge is that wisdom knowledge is wisdom is hope to use knowledge or glory the part and with knowledge and wisdom you should be blessed ignorance o'clock a bless that when products Solomon what you want Solomon said give me wisdom and knowledge to govern these people and control Solomon because of the natural riches because it in answered this and a host of eternal man I will bless you so much - Oh hallelujah because you're asked for wisdom and knowledge knowledge and wisdom you need it you need to know [Applause] after all the singing of the song service and you feel happy and nice you want to hear you're in competition for song service your competition for the music you come to church because I want to know what you don't know because this knowledge is what will empower you because this reveals the will of God for your life knowledge I prefer say wisdom is the principal thing get wisdom but before your poor chili dog whistle yell devotion to have knowledge but revelation here we go no supersedes knowledge because revelation is more than information revelation is knowing to know what you can't explain like how exact solution shall conceive he just knows it hallelujah hallelujah like all Abraham know even of a son named Isaac with his wife Sarah who can't have children that's not knowledge that's revelation that's knowing [Applause] you open the door in the clothes you open the door is closed you open the door in his clothes and something tell you for now that door will open and every devil say but your lifts and times under clothes that has nothing to do with now unless you hold the door opens because you are knowing that's revelation little man say I am some say of this some say that I'm Peter said that what the Christ he said flesh and blood hath not revealed this to you but my father has revealed this to you knowing Abram said aren't allowed we go up got an even more for my sake he's an analyte bigger and I are we gonna knock down that is knowing he doesn't know how this man gonna come true but he knows I stop putting up with him and I sacrum back down if quite other reason from the dead kögel risen from the dead but I'm going to sacrifice Isaac but coming back down all glory to God so what you're hearing preach as information or knowledge has to be revealed so that's why the devil fight you get it in the spirit because the Spirit is what brings revelation if the Spiritist are here we have a lecture hall we have an information center we have things that you never hear before but if you get in the spirit then the spirit to take a whole on the words being spoken and when it's revealed to you listen if your husband next to you if the white next to you if a brother next to you is a sensor next to you that has nothing to do you an external a direct channel of divine revelation I think I read this in a meeting Friday without tremendous permit in Friday if you're miss Wednesday you should miss Friday you know we have wet Wednesday service on Friday is the engine room finally is one unlocking the anointing here on Sunday Fridays the pieces of the church being lifted up in spirit because somebody is praying prayers lifting it's not talking at me anybody come behind here gonna be

because in one way mechanics come like wind and Tex and scripture but this is a different kind of mechanics and let the inspiration drop in and then nothing can change your mind you go out outside of that you do no good and that's what the Prophet said he could be standing here and preach until is here fall out if it's not inspired to you you receive condition certain form anthem and pastor the pastor to a change in who you are you just change in churches but if you come to a knowledge and understanding and get a revelation of your name in that book then it changes all together it doesn't

continue he was a great man do you not know Bible reason that day he only went my inspiration he was a prophet to whom the Lord comes to and he only had to be inspired because he knowed his position that he was caught the Prophet and the only thing I had to happen was for inspiration to strike him then he knowed whatever it would happen because it was inspiration and here we go are you ready that's the church if it is an order second order it got the mechanics ready it only need the dynamics tonight if we will get the mechanics ready and you know what he said get our hats right [Applause] people talk so much about doctrine doctrine doctrine tick tick you believe that it would be that thick you believe that I believe that too thick you believe that no I do believe that noting that is mechanics and what form when Jesus wanted he talked about a man had a work to do and I be left sixth hour last holiday he come and see some fellows linemen and say all I want to work they say yes he said same pay same penny last hour how much thing in people's head bigger pump somebody just come any message last week last how much to move a pump for him last 50 years I'm telling you seasons upon us way it was - no no mechanics no punches at our knowledge at in your head all your needles a key to unlock the dynamics and that key cop inside your heart Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God my God hallelujah glory to God Jesus cornea listen he had two tears and then - now see as a ministry powerful ministry Mary Magdalene all ancestors who get the Holy Ghost that wasn't with him a long long time it wasn't ten years - walking with Jesus and when they get a holy horse and ride it and become preachers they become anointed Kooks anointed drives anointed mother's anointed father's blessed blessed blessed blessed blessed omigod let me drop this bomb on you God want you to be happy lemons nice Christian you know God wanted that joy what wanted to add joy joy is LT you know it spends before your spirit my mayor's ago and me time I covered up with a particular brother every time I Hadi joy he says to me something shadowed it like he had a ministry to OD joy but no when I look back I recognized he was getting a fight because he had that joy so you trying to wheel me into his thing you come at a big smile and let me see something deeper on your smile all these miles why for movies know that brother you don't want the fellowship with him after 102 I that doable by him because he's speaking something not not in your atmosphere but around put somebody in the sky and he said him and spoke a blue streak and break the anointing over him I said if he was very careful to put inside this car we come back emoticon speak the wrong thing I'm spirit coming over to your words on your mouth [Applause] or glory deploy you want to speak the right thing you want to say the right thing Oh hallelujah glory to God that's what they come to church for now yet a spoken word that you could know what to speak the word got the mechanics ready if it only needs the dynamics tonight if we were getting mechanics ready what get our hearts right the things that we can do that's what we're the Gideon was talking about what you can do not what you can hear what you can do after what you're here for them on every word follow men baptism from every order that he told us to do get watch get ready every mechanic ready and stand there then we are ready for the dams in little and only quad can do that so it not only court cuts left of the dynamics yes and that is the faith that says I am NOT healed then that don't make any difference what circumstances is you are healed any now because if I fit your heel so that Centurion and Kindle children says my servant is sick just send the word Speak the word only and my servant shall be healed just a good I way that's all he had a fee he just believe what Jesus said and when he went down and before you reach it off he said what time was he here he just know Oh glory to God he just know it's unknowing hallelujah it's inspired to him i know i know that i know that i know i know that i know that i know that i know that i'll be free today I know I'm gonna get a preacher I know this is the special there's something in your spirit something sense that's why you're come they come because something pull you something drawer or glory to God hallelujah feel that corporately for you today today is your tales just know it Oh glory to God that's what you have to come with I know in a consciousness and awareness or either God hallelujah maybe seated oh praise God hallelujah version 2 for nevertheless I have somewhat against it because I was left I feel of to understand this you must realize the Spirit is not speaking to the original scenes of episodes alone this message is to the entire age with last 120 years its message them is to all generations in that span long history keep repeating itself in a generation of Israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires phasing in the next in the timid generation embers may be growing slightly in the fourth there's no vestige whatsoever of the original flame then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural built anymore isn't it true to a Pacific succession it isn't anyway you start out with a truly born again believer next generation comes along they will no longer just plain Christians they have taken on denominational names and no Baptist Methodist etc they are not Christians they have to be born again of the will of God not by the will of man to be saved and these folks are all coming together no by the will of man I don't see that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute but the original fire has died down they are not the same anymore here we go the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for regional in the spirit begins to feed and instead of the church feed on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and become former diagur the excuses from formality or glory to God I like to put it this way the passion to know the world they cry to get in the spirit and the fufun desire to please God you want to have a person don't know what God said in his word if you have that passion a date a pass and you don't read something in that word because you want to know you want to have God's knowledge yes you want to be in the scripture he said whole time we know he's in my sire when to be not constantly in the wood you have to be constantly in the world to know who the Messiah is because today he is rain tomorrow he is blood today he is test tomorrow is that according to what is promised for the Aged so you have to be in the world to know what he has promised he said I will leave you not comfort us so now is the comforter next minute even spirit of truth next minute he's disguised as mechanics net mirror these dynamics or cattle or - oh who do you see themselves or plural of choreographer understanding hallelujah and to be in the word to know who the Messiah is Oh glory to God hallelujah that was beginning to have an emphasis they were getting former the abandonment of God was dying out and people weren't too careful about what God thought of them they begin to

virgins now didn't have all the lamps they had everything else they were clean they believed Christ they preach the word they're in a mission what they preach the second comment is sacrifice the

were left went to the tribulation and give their lives for a testimony of Jesus when he returns from the Gentiles the Jews and the other long question and so on but a Branham please explain because you said there will be a small number go in the rapture what about the people that believe in the Lord and don't believe it the way we preach this endtime message will let me save this assign a name

Gentile church now the Gentile church will go to the tribulation that is people any message with all the oil let's call them tribulation scenes see the bride is the elected they caught you nothing by

you to cry on to him because you want to show that God you want to display that God you are not going to show up Oh glory of God when Moses try stealing these people and kill the man around for forty

back here God come back quad-cam nonconformist willin to bring his vindication booth to bring the people out there is your God I think David and right in this Sam must have been in distress and it usually take the stress to bring the best thought of a man when we get down we fast many times to get ourselves in a position to get ourselves out of the way and I think when David got these places he began to meditate on the Lord and to think on these things meditating is not reading meditates is not your head in a book on your studying or your internet anyway an amazing you know when you're thinking over when you're spending time how am I going what kind of life I'm living then you're looking inside is this what I want is this how I want to live I don't want that for my life Lord I want something better you see some people don't take time for that they don't take that see yourself they seen others they might not appeal resist but they can't see for themselves yes the figure they smacked don't smarten everybody the couch might God so David use a meditate think about the Lord and as I think like this last I was natesan thinking and colorfully message my mind and it come to me

execute that Christians when they try to do something good good while you go to the effort to do something good then your final there is a devil on every hunter and upset you hallelujah praise God but let us look at the taste and let's see actually it is a natural thing Oh glory of God hallelujah as long as they are human there is something in them that have a test calling for coordinate devil job

that the pasta mark I'll play mark you hope any mock bus to hope anemic winds that is big lump sum no they can grow an achievement and see if it you know a big sacrifice angle Islam Samina but they want a shortcut but then courts program there is no shortcuts [Applause] some people wonder what the righteous shortcut right Church we have that every church are treating this church to even if it lost hey man I say miss hello I still say there's a no even if you don't say man I still say you know every church that we can I believe I don't know true believers make believers and unbelievers you know you don't have to say it - tell the truth I don't know who is who so I had a preacher so all I custody to sell you you you you that purse so let me let me continue the test is like an alarm clock the soul sets off an alarm clock a little buzzer that tells you that is looking 9 if you don't get the pretty water soon you'll die it's get load unload till you putting it off you will die I'm timid describe it on the sound as the hot pant after the water broke so my soul after this and so on he said the wild dog grabbed this deer by the flanks it missed the throat he will grab him a second time at the Frank another - try enough and quick enough he can shake the dog off that there is much faster the talk stalks him when he's not looking and when he's upwind from him he pulled not that dog is near and when the wild dog grabs him he's really quick he can throw it off but when the talks come out or the Frank he has got a whole mouthful of deer flesh he grabs at the neck sometimes he cut the jugular and miss it and she had him shaken he pull a whole chunk of meat off to the DA's truth and the blood begins to run then the dog will come right on the trail of blood after the deer as the life of the dirac instead mental as the blood which is the live stream of the body begins to Twinner down the DA gets weaker and the dog or the wolf is right behind a deer if that deer can find water know what has something in it drinks the water it stops the bleeding but if you don't get the water to cool off keeps flowing faster and faster because he's running why are you running from the enemy now that their nose unless he finds water he's gone he just can't live I have trapped them many times been wounded and when he hits a stream of water he was crossing and get a drink and up goes the hill come back don't get a drink of water and go up you will never catch with him as long as he follows that stream but once he leaves that stream if he can't find another book of water oh god you look at him right away oh my hallelujah and that is all David could say as to half panted after the water broke he wasn't right - no intellectual song this was a reality no he was dying he's only got to get a drink of water and the last day of the feast Jesus passed Oh glory to God if any man passed then I'm coming to me and drink out of his belly shall flow rivers and I see this morning how you to see if anybody tests you this morning you could go to any group any church that is fine when the church is nice when we know they'll talking but with the church I'm talking about thirsty just in for life system for the Living God just entire reality all Korena God not destined they're gonna call my campaign my god testing for God to see him to seem appear or glory to God as a hot pant after the water broken so my suit is after thee O God unless I can find you Lord how perish when a man or a boy or girl get that kind of taste something gonna happen you can't come in halfway Oh glory to God there it is for success so many people today yeah Coons foresters there's a twist for fellowship you want the fellowship and they weren't passed to try to cut the people off and put them in little pastor pens and chicken pens not Eagles Eagles you got chicken egos no fellowship these are two squad protectors for fellowship II supposed to have fellowship is only push-ups and M&A message keeping people from fellowship but the sheep a sheep sheep was given trouble by sheep a sheep the sheep one fellowship but put around prophesy one day that ring gonna fall it will fall so hard under water with the rise rise above them walls and the doctoral fellowship all this crazy stuff the rainbow correct there's a thirst for love hallelujah the test for young man a young woman to love one another is a thirst for love and it's an unnatural it's a natural thing we find many woman it's a thirst for beauty is a natural thing for a woman to be justice to be pretty it's not wrong I want to be pretty this should be the truth a woman should have will be taught boredom settle modest apparel Thomas christ-like spirit you're just on your side there just let me answer did you get what I said before I put up on the outside you make sure your pooch on the inside okay the Lord I show you God wants you to be pretty Oh Gloria got inside and outside Oh glory that God did the Lord I show hallelujah hallelujah glory know God gives up avoided a don't skip that hallelujah my core today there are perfusion to is for God that is for to be putting all these T's for water they turn it into satisfying without a drink and the test with joy everybody wants not joy this for fellowship all these great things that God put them to us they'll be my kiss after him God me to the test after and we tried to satisfy that with some kind of test Oh Gloria Decorah do this do that do that and then after what the record is not working for you God won't shoot a test for him that's the hot part of the work I'm gonna try to close it mean the key bits along oh my but if that da was panting for that water broke well what if somebody come along and say another buddy dear come along see see it well I'll tell you what to do I know that there is a model down there but they wouldn't want that model there's nothing can satisfy that - is in the human being until God comes in he must have it or die oh plurid have got nothing on the quench the thirst for the world glory have got no sex no money no nothing out there with us quench the thirst without living there's a great danger if you don't watch it if you're testing for God make sure it's caught you find if it's your test satisfied if Satan has been able to prove it you from these natural appetites you try to make you sell you satisfied Oh glory to God if you won't get that twist in the right place in your life until after the things that God provide anticipate I'm gonna skip oh my hallelujah this'll fellowship genuine fellowship to meet one another Oh glory to God in the church tonight there might be different denominational views and so forth but when it comes to that to this we can meet and common ground one ground some might believe in sprinkling someone in water baptism we come on neutral grounds because he's artists for him and fellowship Oh glory to God hallelujah not join in church quoting a Creed something like that it's nothing but the very presence and feeling of caught himself in your life that will satisfy that to know him his life are they gonna skip down quickly oh praise the name of the Lord Wow we have so much stuff here praise God thank you lord Oh watch there we go the danger of neglect is you say I have a hole it is but I'm not guilty but a Branum or just go to Jordan Church see the neglect appears if you neglect the salad of water food you will die say no what naturally if you don't drink if you don't eat you will die and if you get a test and you forgot you which spiritually die you're physically in church but you're dead on the inside you call for revivals you wait for your church to have a revival that in revival for you the revival ought to begin right in you when you begin to test for thought there might not be another member of the church one day that revival if it bridge off in you it will break out in other places the revival is stopping you and I'm hoping and start today that's why the bonds are very fabric of the sisters that watch the dishes because the spirit of prayers upon the sisters they kind of under God almost done here I remember the Word of God is what the Holy Spirit feeds on it don't fees on enthusiasm it dole feeds on education it doesn't feed on coach church-going it doesn't feed on theologies what kind of tears could we think of upon us tonight oh so the bride
