local church in ghana in tema from my wife and the entire church we want to salute the hearthstone technical for your love for the lord and for always putting this together for us to be uh partakers of this um meetings amen so before i say anything i just picked a scripture from inspiration that brother theo gave for the meetings from the book of ephesians chapter 6 verse 12 amen therefore we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places these are the things that we are wrestling against and we thank god that before our enemy was became our enemy god had made a way for us and we are going to face this battle and win this battle because this battle was worn for us before the foundation of the world no matter how the day i will try to come against a believer i tell you god already made a way for us amen was saying something in the message here the conflict between god and satan our prophet said he said now what is the word of god and the word of god would defeat satan anywhere at any time at any place when rama said what is the word of god so the word of god is god himself so god gave the believer himself one scream amen is that as god himself he gave the believer to attack the enemy by in other words he is the father and the word is god and the word is our father so god gave you his word to attack the enemy at any time at anywhere at any place before the coming of the lord the world is in a great condition it's not terrible conditions in a sodom condition but we have a promise of the holy ghost that by this promise of the holy ghost we are going to win this battle we can attack the devil anywhere at any place at any time amen oh praise god hallelujah so there is no need to fear friends brothers and sisters there is no need to fear we have the word which can defeat the devil at any place at any time in the message here the evening time messenger ram said here we are we are at the end time the red light is down it's flashing the coming of the lord is at hand wars rumors of war earthquakes nations are breaking the coming of the lord is a time said yes sir listen the end time message which is the word should meet the end time conditions there is not going to be a battle lost we are going to win those battles the end time president should meet the end time condition where they got off the message or to bring it back oh my all the ones that we lost god is going to bring it back he's going to replenish he's going to bring it back so always the end time message meets the end time condition all the way through the scripture i was in the scripture there was a wall of jericho and there was a word to overcome the wall of the walls of jericho praise god there was a sodom and there was a word he came down to confirm the promise to abraham there was a red sea and there was a word to meet the condition at the time so this battle that is on the earth now it's not physical it's spiritual we are going to win this battle in the mighty name of jesus amen oh praise god we are going to this battle not as though we know the tactics but we are going in by the word knowing that he himself warned for us before the battle started god we should bless you god bless the convention god bless brother theo and the headstone tabernacle team brother isaac over god bless you we salute you and god bless all the ministers that will be speaking from all over the world all the ministers that will testify may god bless you and

our speaker for this today's service amen amen all the way from ghana amen and we certainly thank god for him and his ministry and we know that god has placed upon the heart of his servant a message from the lord so we just enter in now and just receive from god today amen get in the spirit praise god worship amen and i'm sure that god will touch you and speak to you in a special way god let you bless you as he comes in jesus name amen and amen amen you love him so as we go straight to the word the book of revelations chapter 12 verse 7 to 12 and then second peter 2 1-6 amen he said and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anywhere in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil this and satan which deceived the whole world and he was cast in out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i had a loud voice saying in heaven now is salvation come and strained in the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accuses them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb praise god so you've got to overcome now by the blood of the lamb not by might not by power not by revelation but by the blood of the lamb praise god and by the word of their testimony so i am the bride i will never fall the word is sure by the word of your testimony praise god and they love not their lives unto death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the seal for the devil is and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knew it that he had but a short time praise god amen and the second peter 2 verse 1 but there was false but there were false prophets among the people even as there were false teachers among you who probably bring damnable heresies even denying the lord that brought them that bought them and bring upon themselves with destruction and many shall follow their penitus ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of and though and true convertedness shall they with vain words make merchandise view whose judgment now of a long time lingered not and their damnation slumbered not for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into the chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment and spared not the old world but saved noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly and turning their cities the cities of sudam and gomura into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that are that after should live ungodly may the lord add a blessing to the reign of his word amen you may be seated so i just want to take this opportunity to greet you this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ amen for another opportunity another year is upon us amen but we thank god that we are still in the battle we're still fighting the battle because we are being fortified by the word to fight this battle until the victory is wrong so praise god we thank god that we are still standing today so we want to salute the headstone top knuckle this morning our precious brother ovied and amen his wife and the ministry and the church we salute you in the name of the lord jesus christ for the opportunity to speak to god's people this weekend amen we want to also salute brother isaac and the team and the technicians for putting the tips together may the lord richly bless you all as we press on the battle amen for the coming of the lord and i want to salute all my ministering brethren that have gone before me that will go before me after me and all those that will greet and all the specials and the musicians the deacons everybody everywhere may the lord bless you as we feast over the world this weekend amen you may be seated so the inspiration of the meetings is preparation for the battle ah man we are preparing for the battle and the prophet said what is the battle the browser the battle is the coming of the lord that's why we are fighting that's what we are pressing that's what we are pushing brother that we can overcome because he that overcome it praise god shall sit with me on my father's throne so we've got to fight to overcome glory be to the name of the lord so we thank god that amen god has never left the world without a witness and the witness is his word and how does he leave a witness is to vindicate that word so the word must be vindicated praise god to the church of laodicea right to him that overcome it praise god and we are taking the written word we have taken that word that was written that was spoken by the mouth of that angel praise god and we are overcoming we are fighting we are pressing oh it is not my might now it's not my power but it's by my spirit save the lord amen you may be seated so we thank god and we trust that you know the enemy is still fighting hallelujah striking everywhere with coronavirus but we have the victory praise god we pulled out of that demon praise god and we are standing here today and across the world the bride is overcoming praise god because the greater is he that is in you than the demon powers trying to stop you oh glory be the name of the lord you may be seated so we are preparing for the battle amen i sent i sent the invitation to a fellow ministry brother and he sent back a question is there any battle to fight the lord jesus has already fought everything what are we fighting for i said go read conflict between god and satan go read the greatest battle ever fought praise god amen but the promise that the war started in heaven is that but it will be finished on the earth glory to god and we are not ashamed to fight oh come on put on the bread spirit of salvation stand there praise god hallelujah and fight the good fight of faith hallelujah so we trust that the lord will bless us today amen you may be seated so for a title today is get in the spirit of your prophecy you've got to get into the spirit of your prophecy and for a subject the word bride wins the battle hallelujah oh the red bride will win that battle not a church system not organization the red bride because the message of malachi 4 is to produce a red bride that will be word of his word spirit of the spirit power of his power the word is the only thing that can be vindicated outside of that word it cannot be vindicated systems cannot be vindicated church system cannot be vindicated men's ideas will never be vindicated but the word is the only thing that god vindicated oh glory be to the name of the living god that is why when they came with denominational spirits god could not vindicate that hallelujah protestant spirit could not be vindicated but the word was always vindicated because he's the same yesterday he's the same today he's the same forever and the word came to call out a bride not a church now a bride that will vindicate that word oh blessed be the name of the living god amen you may be seated hallelujah let's ride into the message this morning so get in the spirit of your prophecy what is your prophecy there shall be a bride hallelujah there shall be an overcomer bride that's your prophecy now but you must get into the spirit of being the bride that will overcome glory be to the living god oh are you with me this morning i remember in joshua chapter 15 hallelujah from the verse 10 you remember when moses gave the promise unto caleb of that mountain praise god when they got into the promised land caleb had to get into the spirit of his prophecy hallelujah and he reminded joshua i am this day are strong i'm not all now i am this day as strong even as the day moses made that promise oh he got into the spirit he wasn't looking at the demons he wasn't looking at the position he was looking at the promise it was a prophecy over caleb my hero stefan in faith give me this day now there for my mountain oh hallelujah and that is our promise we are standing today give me this day that capstone give me this day the headstone give me this day the dynamic because that is the only thing that will give you power to overcome the enemy oh blessed be the name of a living god hallelujah so caleb got into the spirit of his prophecy you get it now and the bride must get into the promise you must get into the spirit of your prophecy oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah so joshua 14 10 and jesus caleb speaking now and now behold the lord had kept me alive come on now he was all he was weak he was tired but he knew the promise would never fail the lord has kept me alive because there was a prophecy over caleb that that mountain belongs to you and to your children and to your tribe caleb held on to the promise he was fighting not just to get anywhere but to get to that inheritance and we have an inheritance oh glory be to the living god we have an inheritance we have a promise we have a prophecy over our life we are not just here to walk up and down and come to church we are pressing for our inheritance oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah and now behold the lord has kept me alive as he said for 45 years even since the lord spake this word unto moses hallelujah the lord spake the word unto moses so whatever the prophet has spoken about you is not william braham it is god that saved the lord over the bride oh come on now we shall overcome that's a promise that's a prophecy the lord has spoken that over you oh glory be to the living god hallelujah while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo i am this day four score and five years old and yet as yet i am as strong come on young people hallelujah our lord is not delaying his coming we are this day are strong because the greatest weapon he gave us to fight is the word come on now and the world will defeat the enemy anywhere under any circumstance i don't care if you're backsliding today the seed of promise is over your life i don't care if the enemy is telling you that there's no power in this gospel brother the word is sure i don't care if you are thinking about sliding and going back to the world i have good news for you the world can never fail he never failed he never felt kill him he never failed him that is sure and god will not freely today oh come on hold on the battle pull out your sword pull out your sword tell the enemy i am this day standing on the promises of god that can never fail oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah glory we feel praise god it's not your might it's not your power god put a faith seed in there and he is watching over that faith said you have nothing to do with the promise mary had nothing to do with the promise but she got into the spirit of the prophecy come on elizabeth i got a visitation from the angel i'm going to bring forth christ his name shall be called jesus and john the baptist brought witness that that name there was power in that name there's resurrection in that name there's deliverance in that name there's no other name on the earth praise god whereby we might be saved by the name of jesus christ oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah oh glory to god as yet i am as strong this day as i was in that day that moses sent me and my strength was 10. huh i are you giving the same testimony today praise god are you getting into the spirit of your prophecy today and my strength well as my strength was then so is my strength now come on now that's why my fire never dies down i don't care how it looks like let everybody walk away and disbelieve but i know god sent me elijah the prophet because that promise is all to me i don't know about you but it's all to me praise god and that elijah the prophet will turn my heart back to the faith of the fathers turn my heart back to the original word original seed original life that is what god will vindicate oh glory be to the name of the living god even so is my strength down ah for war my strength is for what for war i'm not going to compromise on that word for war both to go out and to come in now therefore come on now come on caleb come on old timers come on young people now therefore give me this mountain the mountain of the holy ghost the mountain of perfection the mountain of adoption the mountain of the holy ghost itself now therefore give me this mountain come on now oh glory be to the living god now therefore give me this mountain where of the lord speak in that day for thou headers in that day how the anakins were there so this mountain before you get to that mountain you've got to fight through these anakins gonna fight to these principalities gonna fight through praise god it's not just an easy ride amen you've got to be knocked here and there but you know the right cannot fail because god promised it god decreed it god declared it and it shall not fail oh glory hallelujah for thou hades in that day how the anakins were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be with me oh i love that it is not by your head knowledge is so be that the lord will be with me oh then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said and joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of zephune hebron for an inheritance abram therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of zebu ne the kennesai unto this day because he wholly followed the lord god of israel oh god is waiting at the end of it all to give you the reward if you can holy follow the lord god of israel holy follow the lord god of malachi 4. holy follow the lord that called you that chose you that place you in this day oh hallelujah but we've got to get into the spirit of our prophecy praise be the name of a living god amen you believe that today you may be seated hallelujah and in luke chapter 4 verse 18 hallelujah jesus himself amen hallelujah when he came on the earth it was time to find his place in the scripture you get it now because there was a prophecy hanging over him glory so he walked into the temple he had to get into the spirit of his prophecy church are you following this morning if the bride knows who she is if the bride can get into the spirit of a prophecy or you will be a powerhouse you will be an overcomer you can create a world and go live in it you can walk through it through praise god if you know who you are if you get into the spirit of your prophecy to god amen hallelujah and jesus said in verse 18 the spirit of the lord is upon me i was reading the scripture he was reading the word that prophesied about him but he had to get into the spirit of that prophecy are you following me now the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance unto the captives to the and recovering of the sight to the blind to set and liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord when he had finished verse 20 and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of them that were in the synagogue were fasting on him and he began to say unto them this day this day oh this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears where jesus walked he walked right into the spirit of his prophecy this coming day you will say this day the prophecy of malachi 4 is fulfilled on my life just did not believe feigning amen cannon favored fabled devices of men but we believe the word and that word cannot fail oh you believe that now hallelujah oh you've got to get into the spirit of your prophecy for today hallelujah blessed be the name of the living god and you know jesus led into the into the wilderness to be tempted hallelujah so we need to be led by the spirit in order to be able to fight because remember our warfare is not canal you maybe see that this battle is not a physical battle this battle is a spiritual battle is a battle against principalities a battle against powers is not your brother it's not your sister it's not a battle against this church and that church is a battle for the world it's a battle to stay true to the world it's a battle to stay in line it's a battle to stay in position it's a battle to stay true to the commanding officer oh and christ is the chief commanding officer oh you believe that today hallelujah so paul tells us here in romans 8 he said for if we live after the flesh you shall die so if you fight this battle is my brother is my sister you are dead no revelation because our warfare is not canada praise be the name of the living god all glory be to the living god but if you to the spirit do modify the deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god oh you are the sons of god as long as you are led by the spirit you get me now as long as you are led by the spirit for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear ah we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear we know that we are called out we know that we are predestinated we are once shaking but today we know who we are no more fear no more staggering no more doubt no more can i make it will i make it i have already made it i'm getting into my place i'm get into my position as a son as a daughter called to perfection call to the rapture call to the resurrection praise god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whether we cry our father for the spirit is a bearers witness with our spirit that we are the children of god oh the spirit itself faith will bear witness faith you bear witness knowledge will bear witness because it is not your life is the life of jesus christ or reflecting out of you as the original seed that was planted by the spoken word of god and you are here in your day to be manifested that you came from god and you are going back to god oh blessed be the name of the living god glory to god you may be seated so you got to understand now you must get into the spirit of your prophecy so the prophet remember we are not on a picnic we are not here to eat and drink and you know no we are not on a picnic it's between life and death praise god is not about your brother your sister is between life and death is between you and christ is between you standing through to the world i've got to make it i've got to press on i've got to make it praise be the name of the living god because i am recruited in the army of god to fight i must fight if i must reign glory to god so we are not on a picnic but we are in a battlefield and the president many people just think that when they become a christian that's all they need to do that settles it forever as they are christian and everything is going to come easy you don't go to school to sleep without studying and come up with good colors no you've got to study you've got to sacrifice you've got to go hungry you've got to read the books glory hallelujah and so are we today you want to be a christian you've got to read the bible the word every day of your life and pray [Applause] because that is your weapon the word is your weapon you don't read the word no weapon praise god the enemy can shoot at you any time but you've got to stand there praise god reading that word of god every day oh blessed be the name of the living god oh people think that that's always forever as they are a christian and everything is going to come easy don't ever get that in your head for i become a christian to fight i become a christian to fight it is written it is written it is written it is also written it is also written satan cannot say it is also written he can only say it is written but when you catch him off guard it is also written the devil get confused there now and that is the greatest weapon god gave to you the word of revelation to say it is also written oh give him praise oh hallelujah glory be to the living god he said i become a christian to fight fight the good fight of fame i become a christian to get in battle lines ah so we are in the battle lines today praise be the name of the living god the trumpet has been sounded i've responded to my regiment come on seven thunderbride of jesus christ you've got to respond because the prophecy is over you that you are the army of the lord i'm a soldier in the army of the lord or when a soldier falls down he will rise up again in the army of the lord don't care what you have done don't care where you are being you have been enlisted in that army you've still got your place in the army stand up there and fight the good fight of faith praise be the name of the living god hallelujah oh i become a christian to get in battle lines we are christian soldiers and we've got to be trained and brought up praise god we know all the techniques of the enemy and to know how to fortify how to fight the fight we can only do that as the holy spirit will reveal it to us you get it now we cannot take what some other nation tells us when we go to war so we can't take any other thing we've got to take what the word said pray we've got to take what the prophet said he sent us elijah the prophet to restore our hearts back and every mystery has been revealed but that elijah the prophet no man is coming with nothing nothing present nothing past is coming god has called out the pride and sent you that prophet praise god oh glory be to the living god and that prophet said there's going to be a pride and when he was living he said look on this look on that and as he was going some begin to turn their eyes to see who was standing some saw where he was going but there were some faithful servants that stayed true and they were looking on what the prophet said to look on [Applause] [Music] every other claim will be proved by the word it is only the word bride that wins the battle oh you get it now oh glory be to the living god oh the holy spirit will reveal it to us we cannot take what some other nation tells us when we go to war some of their ideas but we've got to take our own ideas the way the holy spirit will direct us and what ideas he would give us because he is the commandeering officer of the army of the christians so we take what the sea of the lord is are you getting me now we take what does save the lord is glory be to the living god are you following me now glory be to the living god hey amen and the prophet so now we know we are in the army you may be seated and we are not to take any idea of any other nation but we have to take the ideas the commanding instructions for he give the orders and we packed up the orders so the prophet said in the greatest battle ever fall and saw the army first in getting ready for a battle there's got to be a select some soldiers oh you are ready this morning that god by his grace found you ready to select you into the army the bride of jesus christ the army of the living god you were found worthy not by might not by power but by the predestination of god's election found you worthy to select you into the army oh they've got to be dressed for fighting ah after selecting you you've got to be what dressed for fighting and we know what we are dressed by because when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth shall he find the faith of righteousness a virtue of the of jesus christ knowledge of jesus christ temperance of jesus christ patience of jesus christ godliness of jesus christ brotherly kindness of jesus christ charity of jesus christ he's not looking for interpretation of the headstone there's one headstone praise god that is jesus christ he is the one praise god that must happily you he said i go away but i come back again yet a little while the world will not see me but you will see me it needs no interpretation and when the day of pentecost was fully come peter stood up and said this is that this is that because the prophet joel had put in it in the written word and peter could identify with a written word and said this is that that was spoken by the prophet joel it didn't need no interpretation the holy ghost needs no interpretation is christ in you the hope of glory it will make you love your brother it will make you forgive it will make you drop your heart it will make you come into the unity of the faith it will make you build up the body of christ oh glory be the name of a living god the same holy spirit is the same yesterday today and forever there's no two holy ghost it's christ in you the hope of glory that's what it is today the life of jesus christ in the believer oh they've got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting and i believe the greatest battle that was ever fought is now ready to go in action and i believe god has been selecting the soldiers i believe he is dressing them huh every day you come praise god there's exaltation there's a rebuke to bring you to be dressed as a soldier of god hallelujah because our warfare is not canada we are being trained up by the world oh when the bride when the bride when the bride when the bride finds his brother in love when the bride finds his holy decency when the bride finds their place in christ she will call out to the other brothers call her to the other denominational chickens come and rejoice with me it's not going to be a time i got it you don't have it no come and rejoice that is the attitude that's when you know you got the holy ghost that's when you know you've got the holy spirit the battle is in front now the battle front is now set getting ready to start because we have been dressed for the battle train for the battle now we are lined up ready to fight now ready to sit down and when you get to the battle you better shoot and kill that's what a soldier is trained for you can have sympathy on that philistine you can have sympathy on false doctrine you can have sympathy or men's ideas you got to shoot them by the word the prophet said so it is written it is written praise be the name of the living god oh you babysit it and the prophet said now and this first battle was ever fought it began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels you get it now it didn't start here but the prophet said it will be finished here now if michael and his angels cast them down okay when we must take over the relay ah when you are running that relay you are looking for victory you don't care who is in the team i might not like the next person i'm handing it over to but that is the selection of the coach based on the ability of the team [Music] you can tell god who to choose god chooses who he wants to choose [Music] mal's choosing is not god's choosing [Applause] [Music] the only thing god wants to achieve is to have overcomers at the end of it come on now you have overcome well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joy of your rest praise god [Music] i get it now and the problem there's only one setting sound i got him here now so the army will only hear one setting sound praise god but abraham was a vindicated prophet listen now there's only one setting sound that is the gospel prepare for the battle remember one battle the coming of the lord oh glory the coming of the lord is the battle so there are things to keep you away from the coming of the lord and you cannot come to the coming of the lord until these things be in you when i see the blood when i see that blood i will pass over you the talking must be displayed you get it now prepare yourself for the battle now against evil what are we fighting against evil against evil when evil is besetting the people on every hand everything is going wrong home life is going wrong the u.n is failing nations are breaking everything going wrong praise god atomic bombs around homes are splitting up why are these things there because satan has been cast down so all the divisions and the separations by revelations here and revelations there is all satan is not god god is not the author of confusion i follow me now because he has been cast down to divide the body that's his aim but thank god god has got the word in that bride that bride will have the spirit of god to discern [Music] you understand now atomic bombs around homes are splitting up motherhood is going low immorals among the people distrust among one another all denominations fasting is to win that's satan satan manifesting his nature denominations fasting and stewing what do you want to do brother say be certain in the midst of that be certain god sent me elijah the prophet he told me not to go to the right don't be extreme to the right extreme to the left stay in the middle of the road with your eyes set on the finish line oh brother braham talked about the story one time there was a bicycle race praise god and he had all these professionals that came ah they could ride the bicycles with all kind of antics but he was a novice never went into the competition it was his first time praise god but he had a vision he had a certain target he had an objective that i'm going to win the race so when they got there on the track brother he wasn't looking to the left he wasn't looking to who was cheering him his focus was the middle of the road we got on that bicycle they were riding and they were cheering this one they will leave their hands and respond and fall off and he was going this guy was looking straight praise god and when he came to the finish line he made it hallelujah when they asked him what was your secret he said i didn't care about the sidelines i didn't care who was cheering me up i didn't care who was lifting me up all i was interested was in the finish line and that is our secret today praise god and he made it by the grace of god brother said be certain that's all we want to do be certain prepare yourself for the battle abraham then said the greatest battle ever what is going on right now here between life and death between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt oh my between liberty and bondage ah you combined yourself thinking you are doing all the service ah but it's time to break free because we have not received a spirit of bonding again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father our father it's me again lord it's me again lord it's me again father hallelujah praise god the battle is between faith and doubt between liberty and bondage the battle is on shine your spear soldiers polish up the armor god is getting his soldiers ready amen that's what god is getting ready now hallelujah now the greatest battle you may be seeing the prophet then goes on to take on the whole arm of god is it in his army he presents his army in the form of five offices [Music] god praise god presents his army in the form of what five offices first is apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that is his army that is his soldiers that is his commanding officers all with the baptism of the holy ghost [Music] so the apostle will never dictate to the pastor the pastor will not dictate to the teacher oh praise god with the baptism of the holy ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon god is the one that says in the church not man set in the church that is why you see the battle today between monsters in the church and god said in the church all filled with the holy spirit but man said in the church becomes the holy ghost man's holy ghost but god said in the church all filled with the holy spirit that's the battle today that is the battle today but we are going to fight we're not going to give up we are going to fight until these spirits are defeated in the name of jesus christ and god's children will be liberated why because god word cannot fail and we are in the spirit of our prophecy oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah the brother said his army his soldiers his commanding officers all with the baptism of the holy ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he come on to meet the enemy with the word that word must be spoken by that prophet because what that bride will say the prophet will say and what that prophet said the bride will say and what they will say would have been said in the world not an interpretation of what they think it is what he said oh come on church traveling on the right road there is one way to the city of god don't be afraid stand still praise god and see the salvation of your god fight that good fight of faith oh hallelujah what does he do a member abraham said each one backing one another up so listen listen listen there is no scripture sit down there is no scripture in the bible or the prophet that says there's always going to be a man of the hour we have to look up to that's a lie from the beat of hell [Music] are you hearing me now because they will be backing one another up on the world so no man is going to be giving inspiration to the whole world the holy spirit praise god will give action to the people it will be the same spirit same spirit here same spirit there the holy ghost wants something done in the church speaks to the local elder that is still the order of the holy spirit the fifo ministry does not replace the local ministry put the back one another up on the word and each one backing one another up with the word the chief captain not out there in front of them up above them back behind them but in them i in you in you in you the holy ghost in the fightful ministry not they become the holy ghost hallelujah did you hear me that not they become the holy ghost but the holy ghost in them that is the army that is the army vindicating vindicating what his resurrection by the proof of his word oh thank god for the word thank god for the word oh hallelujah now who is the enemy i'm done praise god are you are you with me today are you fortified now that's why you've got to look out for the gift that's why you've got to respect every ministry but brother when it comes to compromising on the world you better pull your sword don't care who he is where he comes from what it looks like praise god we are standing here fortified with the word we don't need no man's glory no man's pattern on the back i do what pleases the father that is what i do praise god oh as hallelujah as my heavenly father sent me so sent are you sent by the same spirit same power same anointing same auction of the holy spirit hallelujah so the prophet said now we know our enemy you may see that we know the enemy hallelujah who is the enemy we know our enemy because the enemy runs and now brethren i have to let away from doctrine you see around here but i've got to say this and any enemy that reasons against or any person so if my wife reasons against the way that is my enemy right there i will rebuke that spirit get behind me satan when peter stood there and said cry i will not allow you to go praise god to the cross i will fight jesus said get behind me satan because all the devils speaking right there because christ came to redeem the pride restore the bride back shed the blood it had to take the blood and anything that stopped the blood from being shed was satan was the devil because he didn't want redemption to be restored back in completeness oh but it was time for redemption it was time for the blood to be shed oh hallelujah glory be to the living god so the prophet any enemy that reasons against or any person any church any organization any individual that reasons against one punctuation of god's word is your enemy that is thus save the prophet that is that sea of the lord that is why praise god but our warfare is not khanna you are not to fight oh you're my enemy i don't talk to you no you've got to be a christian hallelujah after you have received after you are believed represent stand there and make yourself a christian oh you gotta make yourself a christian [Music] you love him now i love this old time singing shouting i love the old time way oh yes i love the old time singing shouting preaching praying i love the old time way we've got to love the old-time way man let me take that again any person any church any organization any individual that reasons against one punctuation of god's word is your enemy and how do you fight that enemy it takes the word to defeat the enemy so he said it is not so i will not be deceived i will not bow i will stand there let me be just be one man there was one righteous lot whose righteous soul was fixed in sodom but lord knew praise god that what was going on in sodom was not right it was ungodly god sent down the angel to get lord out of that place stand there with the word don't never deviate from the word stand there praise god hallelujah oh let me just finish now so the prophet said in the fourth seal you maybe see that he said now the battle started in heaven it will be finished on the end it started to be finished here so michael detected the light of satan and kicked him out his angels were kicked out prayed but they still got some angels to believe they are alive and they were cast down from heaven and the brother said that war will finish on the earth but brother i am one of them that will finish that battle i'm one of them that has got my soul thrown out i'm one of them friend or no friend the nomination of no denomination praise god whether i maintain my family or not let me maintain christ the word oh glory be to the living god hallelujah it will be finished on the earth in the form of the armageddon now let's watch and see it unfold and maybe we can unfold it if the lord help us right now to do this now watch it unfold abraham said the mystery rider watch him now what does he do now or post refuse to repent and go back to the original blood world that's all i got it right now that mysterious rider refused to repent pride and arrogance can't take correction about everybody but god made us one the same by one's spirit we are all baptized into the body satan cannot repent satan cannot repent so he refused to repent and go back to the original word the world became blood and fleshy he refused to go back to it is the antichrist the true white bride he is opposed to the true wet bride you see that this spirit is opposed to the true wet bride and that is the contention of the battle but thank god no man puts you in the pride and no man takes no man out of the pride god called his bride elected the bride put the word seat there and you will stand there oh unshakeable unmovable praise god hallelujah glory to god amen oh glory to god amen opposed refused to repent and go back to the original blood word the word become blood and flesh see he refused to go back to is antichrist the true white bride he is opposed to the true white bride takes his own bride this antichrist spirit takes his own bride he opposes the true bride too he takes his own bride and brings it to him in the form of religion called chris and dogma [Music] what the prophet didn't say they can't find so they say even the prophet could not reveal this but there is no body that the word comes to than the prophets [Music] so read those spoken word books [Music] don't you ever praise god substitute the spoken word books for no man read them because every gun has a front and a back side praise god but the gun without the bullet is useless no matter how powerful that gun looks like whenever the bullet is useless the gun is the word the prophet's message is that bullet that brings the fire praise god oh the backside connecting with the front side exposes the enemy fires the enemy defeats the enemy bring the enemy down praise god oh don't never let down the books say what the prophet said hold on to that prophet's word praise god because one day we are going to line up behind that prophet hallelujah oh here comes the pride we are going to line behind our prophet we're going to lie behind william branham we are not ashamed of him we will declare it will declare the word that god gave william braham praise god that the apostle will pick the evangelists will pick the teachers will pick the pastors will pick they will come through by the prophet's word they will not bring a new thing now it will be the same thing praise god jesus christ the same yesterday the same today the same forever all by this holy spirit refused to recognize the true word pride takes his own bride he opposes the true bride too and takes his own bride and brings it to him in the form of cretes and dogma see and now seeing the holy bride he is against her he forms his own bride called the antichrist by antichrist teaching one word he fell short of the glory of the world one word so you better have your eyes on the world don't take reasoning now take the word as it is written praise god satan don't care about oratory and pick this mystery here join that to this one bring this one here sealed one and reveal one and join it together satan don't fear that that don't produce power in the believer god in simplicity but abraham prayed that message hiding and revealing himself in simplicity are you following me now we've got to get in the spirit of our prophecy glory let's get out of here praise god but he forms his own bride called the antichrist by what antichrist teaching how does he form his bride by antichrist teaching antichrist don't mean that you reject the prophet it doesn't mean you reject the word but it is injecting your own ideas to what the prophet did not say or trying to get a higher revelation of what the prophet said he means what he says and the prophet every apostles doctrine is have you received the holy ghost since you believed [Music] we heard of some adoptions two three years ago and can't forgive odds can't drop out can't talk to one another what kind of adoption is that that's evil spirit upon men oh church of the living god bride of christ around the world you can deceive yourself stand still and see the salvation of your god [Music] praise god he is against her but he forms his own bride called the antichrist by antichrist teaching which is contrary to christ see how shrewd he is and now instead of having a unity of love controlling worship under the blood he's got a denomination the prophet is a man sent from god with the sea of the lord these things are taking place today run for your life stay with that vindicated word [Music] praise god uh instead of having a unity of love controlling worship under the blood he's got a denomination instead of having the word he took chris dogmas and so forth that's the enemy praise god who was the dragon the congregation says satan says satan what nation did he represent congregations is wrong and he had angels said didn't the bible say that in the last days that the ministering spirits of the devil would be like flaming angels is the life behind the name my brother if you're gonna preach me a same one leave me a sermon power without character is what see technique so you preach all the mysteries can't live the life of the word satanic you get it now don't be out don't be i am preaching don't be afraid now you rejoice at the world leave the battle for me because i i pray because i got my i got my uniform a long time ago i was giving my rifle a long time ago and i'm not afraid to shoot the i'm not afraid rather i'm not afraid to fire satan at the head and pop up his brains pray i'm not afraid if you're afraid don't worry i'm leading the battle praise god i've got the i've got the word still the word oh glory glory hallelujah since i lay my burdens down i laid them down a long time ago picked on my cross praise god marching over to jerusalem and no devil better stay my way get out of my way praise god because i am in the spirit of my prophecy nothing will stop me pray i'm headed to perfection i'm headed for adoption i'm headed for the holy ghost itself [Applause] glory let's expose this enemy and get out of here praise god hallelujah what nation did he represent rome and he had angels during the bible say that in the last days the municipal spirits of the devil would be like flaming angels but if they speak not according to this [Music] but if they speak not according to this let them alone from such turn away listen the life of the prophet he said you couldn't tell his enemy from his friend but the brown will not call somebody a devil even if god showed him around us to show him the best of love because god is love today we can call fellow ministers black members and think he's okay that's demon powers if you see your brother in the wrong yours is to pray let your heart reach out do everything you can to reconcile your brother that is in the wrong way i gotta be now oh glory oh but listen hell now but if they speak not according to this let them alone the devil will transform his messengers into angel of light and organize right back just like exactly rome did brother sister i don't see where you could find a loophole in that you can't find a loophole in what he said if he doesn't speak according to the word if you divide the body that's not of christ any revelation that divides the body of christ is from the beat of hell all right oh are you getting me now wherever i said god has just got it all walled up there right here in his word and there it is he said he did it now see michael the archangel the great one that stands in the presence of god and his angels fought against satan and his angels the red dragon and that was christ that is that's lead by the holy spirit and his angels of god fought against the organization so anything that is organization fight against it don't ever be yoked with organization nothing that ever organized god moved with it god rejected it right there god is calling out a word bride that will fight the good fight of faith to take a stand don't reject it don't despise but god is with that little pride [Music] see the prophet said now amen fought against the organization and his angels and ministers of light these things have to be manifested or else the prophet will not put it there so once it is there you better watch out for that spirit is a spirit now that has got to be manifested so don't be afraid when you hear all these funny doctrines flying here and there stay with the wind then goes on see how perfect if they are speaking not of something up into glory speaking of spiritual peace in rome it is not speaking of some spiritual peace in glory not speaking of some angels in heaven he's speaking about men on the earth with that organizational spirit see oh and they prevail not amen is it and the great dragon was cast down that serpent called the devil satan we deceived the whole end that roman power going into every nation that city that rules over all the air he deceived it many churches organizing just like him many churches in the message organizing like rome don't talk to this one i've nothing to this one they have rejected the man with the angel no man is with no angel on the earth the angel of the lord is with the bride fixing things for the coming of the lord but abram had the angel praise god but that angel stood there is here today at that day shall michael the great priest stand for his people not standing with no man christ in his people no man is with no angel he might be with a fallen angel that i'm not i don't know but to be with an angel of god never be afraid of this semantics and gimmicks and resistances around the world forget about it god can't vindicate that you get it now the roman power is going into every nation the roman word power is going into every nation that city that rules over all the earth he deceived many churches organizing just like him see making an image onto the beasts but thank god god has got a bride i got in it now so let us go on god gave his children what the word that's your weapon that's your defense that's your authority by what authority do you do what you do by the authority of jesus christ of nazareth whom you crucified it is by him that we do what we do [Music] don't mention his name again oh we cannot help but speak of the things we have heard and seen we cannot help us speak of what malachi 4 has said we're going to help us speak of the promises that is left for the pride we go outside of the promises you have done cut yourself off from god god will meet you on the basis of them promises oh church praise god amen let's close out here now praise god musicians get ready he said and we find out that god gave his children the best so god gave you the best oh that he said to elijah the prophet the best to tie up every loose end oh come on church god gave you the best all the hanging loose as he tied it up in the middle of the prophet malachi 4 and called you our praise god you know the mystery of rome you know the mystery praise god of this dragon this antichrist spirit you know the mystery tied up every loose end and gave you the best the spoken word is the original seed to call out a bride now we found out that god gave his children the best and therefore he didn't have to improve it willie abraham's grammar we don't need to improve it if he said when for come i will say wait you can mark my grammar wrong that's what the prophet said i am not in a position to correct the prophet it means this he meant that no he means what he has said and i believe he's just the same way and he's working for me the same come on now he didn't have to improve it he never changes he hasn't changed one bit since the first time he gave his children protection i get in it there is war in heaven remember there is one in heaven he had to kick out satan then he came down on the head and fortified his children with the word so he just didn't kick the devil down he came down himself and fortified you at night with the word that we can have a defense we can have our protection we can stand there and tell the devil we are children of the original word we are the spoken word original bride the word is in the bride and that bride will stand there praise god undefeated glory oh glory be to the living god but i want to ask you something eve did not while she was standing in that great fortress of his word now satan was on the outside trying to use some kind of technique to get her out there i got him you know trying to use some technique you know the prophet even didn't reveal this then people with itching ears want to hear what the prophet didn't reveal but in the days of the voice oh of that sabbath angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as i declare to his seven the prophet i am staying here i am staying here with malachi 4 [Music] satan was on the outside trying to use some kind of technique to get her out here for as long as she stayed behind the world everything was fine young people as long as you stay behind the world oh everything is gonna be all right everything is gonna be fine you get it now hallelujah oh that's where we make our mistake we make our mistake when we get from behind the world so i believe all the bible believers think it that way we get from the world then we are in trouble as long as we keep the world ahead of us don't get ahead of the word let the word get ahead of you see you just let it go first and you just leave behind right behind it it plows the ditch you just walk in it and that is the way it goes i get it me now brown said now in them he said in them two today is in the womb of the church there's a great big system trying to be formed called the world council of churches and from the womb of the church is coming for two children from the womb of the message it's coming for two children you get it now brother say you just mark my way our prophet is speaking oh god of mercy i'm reading from beth pins paragraph 177 now is that amen he said from the womb and from the womb of the church is coming for two children you just mark my word but the good news is the word must deliver the word bright church the word must deliver the word bright church the church has got to be delivered out of here our pride for christ then that fell asleep in all ages will make up that pride that come up on the word that they come out of like from the feet coming to the head amen the greater and more you have to have and so forth as the body grows up so does the body of christ grow up and then the finally the head will come to it the head of it will come now if we notice cause he's linked to the head he's all linked to the head the head does the turning and pulling paul and cool the bride will all come and they cannot be complete without you they overcame by the word so must you overcome by the way to make the head part praise god we are making up the headstone glory be to the living god the head part of the body if the overcame by the word we must overcome by the way the prophet said now but these systems will not grow out of that because it's a system it cannot bring forth systems cannot bring forth it were to go by men's revelations who have left this world a long time ago all the mathematical calculations of what is going to be we are still here but the bride the world must produce a wet pride stay with that bread systems will not grow out of that because it's a system it cannot bring forth you see but they are both in the same field you said a cocoa bear cannot bring forth a bunch of wheat but they are both in the same field watered by the same water ah by the same sunlight one is the world and the other is not the world and two of them are fighting they've been fighting since the first reformation and they are still fighting so if you don't want to fight you are already defeated ah oh take a stand i'm done now you get it now are you enjoying it today praise god are you enjoying it on tape praise god may the lord give you a revelation to take a stand don't ever be afraid to declare billy paul was given a testimony about the son who went fishing and the lady recognized and said i know that boy your father was a minister he said no my father is not a minister he said what's your name he said david billy brown say yeah i know your father was a minister he said no so then your grandfather was he said my grandfather was not a minister he was a prophet don't be ashamed to say god sent me malachi for the prophet [Music] you get it now praise god amen oh watered by the same sunlight but one is the word and one is not the word and two of them are fighting so it's a fight and we are prepared for the battle we are prepared to fight this battle to the last till the last enemy is chopped off you get it now oh glory to god amen so brother brown said well you've got the same choice today she's fixing to bring forth the perfect weight back there the word is coming for the bright red bride ah as a woman is part of the man taking from her so the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of the bible not systems status of a perfect man put it there you don't have triple triple four capsules and headstones is one heads too and to be crying grease grease grease today heads too i don't want to know how this pyramid transforms and transforms i know he said add your faith between you very knowledge that's it if these things be in you it will produce a living that being that being when it is complete it is that man that is going into the rapture [Music] are you following me now okay the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of the bible no system dogmas or nothing added to it it will have to be an unadulterated pure virgin word are you following now and we are done are we done praise god okay we're doing good i'm done praise god remember how contrary is denomination to god's word denomination is contrary to the word that is why i go everywhere with you but we know where we stand once i am invited i will honor the invitation after you have believed you still have to stand there and make yourself a what a christian be like the prophet but be bold stand on the word don't compromise that word how contrary is denomination to god's word he never had one never dealt in one never dealt with one are you getting it god never dealt any denomination and never dealt with a denomination i want some historian to show me where god ever a prophet ever come out of the church show me where god ever blessed a church after it was organized god will never so see the prophet we don't care the claims still here but the bride is fighting every wall of jericho is coming down you are not like this you are not what you you are not what you used to be what has changed the world has washed you stripped you praise god dress you right and here you stand victorious oh my show me where god ever blessed a church after it was organized she went on the shelf tied with intellectual wisdom from the devil by their leaders and refused the word of god as he grown up into the perfect stature of christ now is at that head how contrary separate from that i'm believing if you children of the evening light separate from that unbelieving if you children of the evening life satan god of this age by his knowledge getting the people to eat from his mixed tree of good and evil notice satan by his knowledge causing the people of this evil age to eat from the tree from history of good and evil he said that he is building a greater christian civilization by his knowledge of good and evil and greater christian civilization but christ's little virgin wet flock bright don't care for the knowledge i get in it you don't care for satan's what knowledge oh she keeps him free from him huh the church the pride the flock you keep yourself away from the knowledge of satan's religion now let's go up ahead a minute now wait he said she wait for her lord and his millennium honeymoon right with the word groom as she is the word bride knowledge and civilization and true christianity has nothing in common what i tell you now don't come and tell me that you are a young man now the fascinating you have a spirit on you and everywhere now is your every young man want to carry a beard and you think you can come nobody can tell me what to do you have a spirit on you that's the fashion of the world if you love the world and the things of the world the love of god is not even in you the word bride wins the battle i guarantee now civilization and true christianity has no one thing in common right what caused death in the garden knowledge but god but can be of god it's of the devil i follow me now so lean not to your own understanding oh i'm done can you take one minute i'm done praise god oh hallelujah don't you love the lord don't you love the word oh it is food to the soul we can stay all day praise god but we are done my brother now notice christ's word bride is heading up huh christ's wet bright is where heading up and we see the antichrist is heading we see where the antichrist is heading begin back there and now coming to a head economical council will put it into an economical head and the little check that's come along also christ's word right come down to the age is coming to a head course she's going to be united back to his mate always just like the church and everything else is going to work unite the wheat everything else comes right back to his head where he started from kane and abel went bright heading up in the passing of the word of god made manifest in this evil age that we are living in see where it is heading out we are heading back to the west bend where it means what martini fest all that the prophet left the prophecies over you but you must get into the spirit of your promised prophecy there's gonna be a pride without spot or without wrinkle oh that is my pro that's my portion that's what i stand for that's what i believe that's where i am going glory oh you believe that hallelujah oh you must get into the spirit of your prophecy jacob and are close to jacob the scripture says jacob have i loved esau have i hated no matter how esau had revelation he was out of the picture no matter how a deceiver jacob was god loved it this to help young people that you think that you have gone too far you can't come back no god loves you jacob was a deceiver it's a planter but it was written by predestination jacob having loved esau have i hated jacob knew that so he fooled around but he knew he had to return home he couldn't stay in that state or in that condition so he needed a time with god he needed an experience with god and so do we need an experience with god because we are going back home we are heading back to our mate we are heading back to the groom we've got to change get back to the original world because he's able to transform jacob knew i can't go back with this deceiving attitude i can't go back with this trickster came alive i've got to wrestle with the angel he got into the spirit of his prophecy god loved him god predestinated him but jacob had to get back to the spirit of his promise the love of god had to find jacob to bring him down on his knees abraham said now so the new beth is very important jacob could not brag on his trickster nature he couldn't brag on his his subplantar nature he had to come back to have an experience with god in the bible when he had the experience with god his work changed ah jacob walked funny but he was restored back to the love that god loved him before he was even born in his mother's world praise god your work must change by the word the prophet said and i'm done praise god oh notice it was by his believers listen closely now as we close up it was by his believers that he proved his way by so this word is not just to lay there god has to prove the word by you it was by his believers that he proved his word by he can only prove his word not by unbelievers it is only by the believer that he can prove his word no matter how much the rest of them claim to be [Music] i am the holy ghost that's not my problem my problem lord fill me with the holy ghost it's only by the believers that he can prove his way no matter how much the rest of them claim to be oh i believe brother see if you do god will prove it so simple rather i want you to notice he does it the same way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers you want a manifestation of the word you've got to believe mind shall not live by bread alone but by every word and this side shall follow them that believe believe what the word and then in the other in order to have believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age so you are predestinated to this age to be the word bride in order for you to be a believer you see it now he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of that age say did you get it now did you feel it now did you see it do you understand it that is what is happening today he predestinated it to this by his foreknowledge when he predestinated the malachi 4 is going to happen glory malachi 4 was predestinated is god to happen ephesians 4 11 is predestinated it's got to happen you see that when he predestinated malachi for it's going to happen when he come over and pray there's nothing anything to happen in his word he had to prove his way to be so when he predicted anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a pride she is going to be there he predestinated the bride and we must get into the spirit of our prophecy he predestinated the pride she is going to be there she's going to be there going to be a rapture she's going to be there he predestinated by finally see there is nothing going to stop it nothing will stop your rapture nothing will stop your perfection nothing will stop you going away nothing will stop you overcome it nothing will ever stop will stop you praise god from becoming that virtuous bride of jesus christ so the prophet said truly predestinated believers stay with the world they won't pervert it they can't it can't be perverted oh sons and daughters of god why can we have this great fellowship that we ought to have with all those sons and daughters of god we should have it but they just won't do it that's all because they are not truly sons and daughters from there i guarantee now but truly predestinated believers will stay with the world oh verb then goes now and i'm done musicians play something is it transformed from the church you are going to be transformed because you are the word bride brother transformed from the church and the world into sons and daughters of god notice this in closing and now oh how the one reasons of god wandering out there in the world in some of this denomination from denomination denomination like one ring starts never stable like live on the water in the autumn we used to see leo back in the east there see the leaf would blow down on it and every little wind blew it from here this side to the other side but god wants us to be stabled anchored in jesus the stumps of life i will pray and god and jesus are fear no winner with see whatever it is many of you remember praise be the name of a living god god wants us to be uncle how are we uncle ephesians 6 verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord be strong in the lord and in the power of his mind put on the whole armor of god that he might be able to stand against the walls of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities powers and against the rulers of the darkness of this world against the spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and haven't done all to stand stand there for having your loins get about with
