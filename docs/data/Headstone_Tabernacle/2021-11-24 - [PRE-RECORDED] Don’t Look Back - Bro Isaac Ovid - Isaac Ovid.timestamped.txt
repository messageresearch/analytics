[0:17] deliver thee from the snail of the
[0:19] fowler and from the noisome pestilence
[0:22] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[0:25] and under his wings shalt thou trust
[0:28] his truth shall be thy shield and
[0:30] buckler
[0:32] thou shall not be afraid for the terror
[0:34] by night
[0:35] nor for the arrow that flieth by day
[0:38] nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[0:40] darkness

[0:43] noon day
[0:45] a thousand shall fall at thy sign and

[27:13] we'll be having a prayer line after the
[27:15] service father lord and me as the word
[27:17] continues to go forth lord even before
[27:20] the prayer line made testimonies begin
[27:22] to break forth with the people catching
[27:24] a faith from the word lord to catch the
[27:27] vision lord that it's already done it's
[27:29] already finished you lord who started
[27:32] the work lord is able to complete it and
[27:34] you died on the cross and you already
[27:37] paid the price you don't have to pay it
[27:38] again it's already paid for
[27:40] father god may you touch your people
[27:42] touch me and may you bless the word and
[27:45] the reading of it and the opening of an
[27:47] talent to your scriptures lord for the
[27:49] next few moments in the precious name of
[27:50] jesus christ and the church says
[27:53] amen and amen i just want to read one
[27:55] portion of scripture
[27:57] before we get ready for the prayer line
[27:59] saint luke 17
[28:00] and verse 26
[28:02] this scripture and this
[28:04] subject has been burning in my heart for
[28:07] a few weeks now i can't shake it so i
[28:09] know there's something in there for us
[28:11] this morning
[28:12] see in luke 17 and verse 26
[28:15] and as it was in the days of noah so
[28:18] shall it be also in the days of the son
[28:20] of man
[28:21] they did eat they drank they married
[28:23] wives they were given in marriage
[28:26] until the day that noah entered into the
[28:28] ark and the flood came and destroyed
[28:31] them all
[28:32] likewise also as it was in the days of
[28:34] lot did it eat they drank they bought
[28:37] they sold they planted they build it but
[28:39] the same day that lot went out of sodom
[28:42] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[28:44] and destroyed them all even thus
[28:47] in other words so shall it be
[28:50] shall it be in the day when the son of
[28:52] man is revealed in that day he which
[28:54] shall be upon the housetop and his stuff
[28:57] in the house let him not come down to
[29:00] take it away and he that is in the field
[29:03] let him likewise not return back
[29:06] remember lot's wife may the lord
[29:09] had a blessing to the reading of his
[29:10] word you may be seated in the presence
[29:13] of the lord this morning
[29:14] and i feel like we are in a hospital
[29:17] room this morning
[29:19] i don't know how
[29:20] recently my wife had to visit a doctor
[29:22] and she went early 5 30 6 in the morning
[29:26] around 8 o'clock i checked in she said
[29:28] she's still waiting nine o'clock checked
[29:29] in she's still waiting 9 30 is checked
[29:32] in she's still waiting because when you
[29:34] go by the doctor you can tell the doctor
[29:36] right now right now the doctor sometimes
[29:38] comes when he's ready to come he knows
[29:40] the different matters he has to deal
[29:41] with and when we come into the house of
[29:44] the lord it's in it's a hospital room
[29:47] jesus when he was he said they that are
[29:49] well have no need of a physician
[29:51] but he came as the great physician so
[29:54] he's in the building this morning to
[29:56] deal with different situations to deal
[29:58] with different conditions and he is a
[30:00] deliverer but for the deliverer to
[30:03] operate he has to be activated
[30:06] because god is very clear in his laws
[30:08] with jurisdiction he is god of heaven
[30:10] and he gave dominion to man on the earth
[30:12] so when we pray what we actually do is
[30:15] open the door to allow god to move it's
[30:18] reason god has to find somebody to
[30:20] operate through because if it was not
[30:22] that principle he would operate without
[30:25] humans and then we would understand god
[30:27] in that context so that's why he would
[30:28] use prophets and they become his
[30:30] mouthpiece because when god came down
[30:32] and spoke he said let moses speak
[30:34] because when you speak we can deal with
[30:36] it so god always uses a man and he
[30:38] always uses prayers access into this
[30:41] realm and into this jurisdiction you
[30:42] believe that this morning so we are here
[30:44] this morning for a special deliverance
[30:46] service because
[30:48] man needs to be delivered and that
[30:50] deliverance and the need for deliverance
[30:52] dates back to genesis when man fell from
[30:55] his condition he fell from his position
[30:57] he fell from where god left him and when
[31:00] god asked the question adam where daw he
[31:02] was not asking for his physical location
[31:04] he was asking about his spiritual
[31:06] condition god knows exactly where you
[31:08] are physically he knows that but his
[31:11] question to adam was where are you
[31:12] because i left you in a certain position
[31:14] as a believer i left you in a position
[31:16] of authority but you are no longer there
[31:18] what happened what went wrong and it was
[31:20] that adam had disobeyed an instruction
[31:23] that god gave to him and that
[31:24] disobedience as brother branham said
[31:27] drinking smoking fornication adultery
[31:29] carousing pornography whatever it is
[31:32] that's not sin that is the attributes or
[31:34] the behaviors that come out of sin sin
[31:37] is unbelief
[31:39] and if you really believe god it'll make
[31:41] you behave a certain way if you really
[31:42] be leave god it'll make you act a
[31:44] certain way if you really believe god it
[31:46] will make you do things that are
[31:47] contrary to your training if you believe
[31:50] god it'll make you do things that are
[31:51] contrary to maybe what your parents said
[31:54] to you if you believe god it'll make you
[31:56] go against what your teacher told you
[31:57] because when you hear from god god
[32:00] speaks in a way to us that doesn't make
[32:02] sense all the time and it's not supposed
[32:04] to make sense because the bible said my
[32:06] thoughts are higher than your thoughts
[32:07] the fact that his thoughts are higher
[32:09] than our thoughts means it doesn't have
[32:11] to make sense to us all the time but he
[32:13] promised to reveal certain things to us
[32:15] and those things which are revealed they
[32:16] can now belong to us because it's within
[32:18] our comprehension outside of that we
[32:21] have to trust god for the journeys that
[32:23] he takes us through to bring us to
[32:25] perfection the journey that he takes us
[32:27] true to bring us to a realization so the
[32:30] trials and the ups and the downs and
[32:32] over the speaking about you may have
[32:33] been spoken drinking whatever it was in
[32:35] the past the journeys that we have gone
[32:37] through to be here this morning there is
[32:39] no accident in it
[32:41] there is no mistake in it
[32:44] because god i say this all the time it's
[32:46] either god is in control or he's not in
[32:48] control he can be
[32:50] in the middle somewhere
[32:52] it is either god is in control or god is
[32:54] not in control if god is in control it
[32:57] means he's in control of where you are
[32:59] today he's in control of the job you
[33:01] have he's in control of the house you're
[33:03] living in whether you like it or you
[33:05] don't like it you have to accept the
[33:07] fact that he is in control if he's not
[33:09] in control and that's a whole different
[33:10] story but i believe he's in control
[33:13] because he is omnipotent he is
[33:15] omniscient he is all-powerful there's
[33:17] nothing he cannot do there's nothing he
[33:19] cannot fix he could move governments he
[33:21] did it when jesus had to be born he
[33:24] could produce money he put gold in the
[33:26] fish and when the fish they found it
[33:27] there is no situation that he's not
[33:29] capable of able to and has the ability
[33:32] to change to twist to turn so we have no
[33:35] excuse this morning but to give god
[33:38] worship
[33:41] and to give god praise and to give him
[33:43] thanks in the midst of the trial that he
[33:46] and his wisdom carefully sat down and
[33:48] planned out for us for our benefit our
[33:51] trials are for our benefit our problems
[33:54] are for our benefit our failures are for
[33:56] our benefit because he promised to work
[33:59] it out
[34:00] can the church say man but the problem
[34:03] said missing limbs will be restored can
[34:05] i have a volunteer this morning to have
[34:07] your limb removed so we can restore it
[34:10] nobody wants a volunteer to be blind but
[34:13] blind eyes have to be opened nobody
[34:15] wants a volunteer to be deaf but the
[34:17] deaf ears have to hear so god in his
[34:20] wisdom allowed things to happen to you
[34:23] allow things to happen to your family
[34:25] and like job you could stand there and
[34:28] say do the skin worm destroy my body yet
[34:31] in my flesh i will see god
[34:33] [Music]
[34:34] [Applause]
[34:35] nothing could happen to you
[34:37] nothing could happen to your family
[34:39] unless god allows it to happen and if he
[34:42] allowed it to happen it's a greater
[34:44] purpose behind this and we have to
[34:47] accept that and that gives us a reason
[34:49] to thank god that in the midst of the
[34:51] lord give the lord take it away blessed
[34:54] be the name of the lord
[34:56] can the church say amen
[34:58] [Applause]
[35:00] hallelujah hallelujah
[35:03] so i have a thought this morning for a
[35:05] few minutes you already had the message
[35:07] but i have to get this out i'm pregnant
[35:09] with this this morning
[35:11] don't look back
[35:13] don't look back that's the title this
[35:14] morning don't look back
[35:16] if you came here this morning don't look
[35:18] back
[35:19] if you want to walk with god don't look
[35:21] back we sing the song when we get
[35:23] baptized i have decided to follow jesus
[35:26] no turning back
[35:28] no turning back so i want to remind the
[35:30] church this morning about don't look
[35:32] back
[35:33] don't look back to your always
[35:35] don't look back to your old friends
[35:37] don't look back to where god took you
[35:39] from even peter before he got the holy
[35:42] ghost when jesus died he looked back not
[35:45] only did he look back he went right back
[35:47] to his former employment that jesus
[35:49] pulled him from god didn't pull him from
[35:52] fishing for him to go back fishing but
[35:54] when he lost something he went back to
[35:57] where he was before and for somebody to
[35:59] be backslidden it means they are not
[36:02] where they were pulled to they went back
[36:04] to where they were before because if god
[36:06] pulled you out of something and you stay
[36:08] out of that something then you cannot be
[36:11] backslidden but the reason we have
[36:13] deliverance services is because somebody
[36:15] steps back from where god placed them
[36:18] and the different reasons why we step
[36:20] back the lust of the eyes or lusts of
[36:22] the flesh the pride of life the cares of
[36:24] life our jobs our families conflict
[36:28] marital problems financial problems all
[36:31] of these things are designed and they
[36:33] come at us and we have a choice to make
[36:36] every day we have a choice do i stand my
[36:39] ground do i go back do i go forward and
[36:42] for anybody who found themselves
[36:44] stepping back it's because you decided
[36:47] nobody forced you to do it you decided
[36:49] to not pray you decided to not come to
[36:52] church you decided to talk to your
[36:54] friend before talking to god
[36:58] black sliding is not an immediate
[37:00] happening
[37:01] it is a process
[37:03] it is a slow process
[37:05] it's a slow process of losing your joy
[37:08] it's a slow process of losing your feet
[37:10] it's a slow process
[37:13] [Music]
[37:14] [Applause]
[37:16] but thank god and restoration doesn't
[37:18] have to be a slow process
[37:20] thank god that when jesus was at that
[37:23] wedding and they ran out of wine he said
[37:26] bring some water and with the branham
[37:28] said that jesus bypassed the picking of
[37:30] the grapes jesus bypassed the fermenting
[37:33] of the grapes jesus bypass all of that
[37:37] and in as they were pouring he said how
[37:39] they keep this wine for last
[37:41] the best wine
[37:43] jesus not just turn the water into wine
[37:45] he aged the wine because the quality of
[37:48] wine is age so it means that god
[37:51] bypassed time to restore what they
[37:54] needed so i don't care how long you've
[37:55] been back sitting this morning god could
[37:58] restore your family he could restore
[38:00] your house he could restore your health
[38:02] he could restore your children and not
[38:04] just could he wants to he wants to
[38:07] restore your children he wants to
[38:09] restore your joy not just wants to he
[38:12] will restore your children he will
[38:14] restore not just will he must restore he
[38:18] has to restore he's obligated to restore
[38:22] he can't help himself his heart is
[38:25] beating fast this morning because
[38:27] somebody is crying out to him it doesn't
[38:29] leave that tough to be your voice
[38:32] [Applause]
[38:35] you may be seated
[38:36] for a few minutes
[38:38] there's a cry from within
[38:40] that you can't even put into words the
[38:42] seed in us cries out the seed in your
[38:45] soul cries out because the word is the
[38:47] believer you are not even the believer
[38:49] but the word in you is crying out for
[38:51] something you try to drown the cry with
[38:54] alcohol you try to drown the cry with
[38:56] your word problems but that cry is still
[38:59] there and he is able this morning to
[39:01] answer the cry he's able this morning to
[39:04] break the chains that i've held you have
[39:06] held you all these years some people in
[39:09] church and chained up people out of
[39:11] church unchained up but this morning
[39:13] don't look back the egyptians you see
[39:15] today you will see them no more forever
[39:18] today is a new day it's a new season
[39:21] it's a new hour god himself has come
[39:24] down you may be seated
[39:28] can i talk to you a little bit
[39:34] it's interesting
[39:36] that out of every age
[39:39] that god compared the end to
[39:41] he didn't compare to the age of moses
[39:43] or the golden age of david or the great
[39:46] prophetic age of elijah you see as it
[39:48] was in the days of noah as it was in the
[39:50] days of lot
[39:52] those are the ages those are the eras
[39:55] the times the dispensations the epochs
[39:57] that he compares our day to
[39:59] and he brought the similarities and he
[40:01] sat out a church they built it they
[40:04] planted they married they had wives and
[40:06] he brought the similarities of what it
[40:09] was which was normal living people want
[40:11] to get married they want to build their
[40:13] house they want to go to work they want
[40:15] to have a job they want to get a nice
[40:17] car they want to survive they want to be
[40:19] safe these are natural things
[40:24] and jesus is painting the picture that
[40:26] the issue for many people is not even
[40:29] the spiritual because the natural does
[40:31] impact the spirit
[40:34] the case of this life
[40:36] is what leads to the decay in the
[40:38] spiritual realm
[40:39] and that is why we have to remember
[40:41] lot's wife
[40:43] and i said on wednesday night you can't
[40:45] talk about lot's wife we don't know her
[40:46] name we don't know how old she was we
[40:48] don't know how tall how we don't know
[40:50] her identification is locked lot's wife
[40:52] that's how she is known to us
[40:54] that's all we know about her in terms of
[40:56] describing her but we know her behavior
[40:59] we know what happened to her and when we
[41:00] go back to genesis we can't talk about
[41:03] lord's wife unless we talk about a lot
[41:05] and lot is
[41:07] of no mention if it's not for abraham
[41:10] because it's because of abraham we know
[41:12] a lot
[41:14] if god didn't call abraham we are
[41:15] children of abraham and we know these
[41:17] things if god didn't call abraham who is
[41:18] lot
[41:20] but the bible tells us abraham had two
[41:22] brothers
[41:23] and one of his brothers died
[41:25] and that was lord's father
[41:27] and for some reason i don't know what it
[41:29] was it attracted a lot to abraham but
[41:31] when god spoke to abraham lot say i'm
[41:34] coming with you
[41:37] something in lot was attracted to
[41:39] something in abraham
[41:41] that attraction had to be real because
[41:43] abraham didn't even know where he was
[41:45] going
[41:47] so it had to be something about
[41:48] abraham's approach
[41:50] something about abraham's attitude that
[41:52] attracted lot to follow him in the first
[41:54] place
[41:56] abraham the bible said was seeking a
[41:58] city whose builder and maker was god he
[42:00] wasn't looking for a big bank account or
[42:03] a platinum visa credit card or a nice
[42:05] house he was looking for a builder a
[42:07] city made by god
[42:10] he was not about the natural things he
[42:12] was not about natural wealth he wasn't
[42:14] about natural ambition
[42:19] are you with me this morning
[42:21] don't look back
[42:22] i'm not taking too long with you but i
[42:23] want you to get this because many of us
[42:26] we find ourselves caught in this
[42:27] position
[42:29] lot is under abraham's leadership
[42:33] he's a part of abraham's house
[42:37] his family worships at abraham's altar
[42:43] and the bible said that it was conflict
[42:46] there was strife
[42:48] between the houses
[42:51] now i want to draw clearly to the church
[42:53] this morning the issue was not spiritual
[42:55] it was not doctrine
[42:57] it was not quotes
[42:59] it was not scripture it was the natural
[43:02] things
[43:02] you park your car here i don't normally
[43:04] park here
[43:06] the bible said they didn't have enough
[43:07] room
[43:10] so the natural things
[43:12] i need i want to expand my house
[43:15] but this person too close to me so i try
[43:16] to expand and he tell me my offense
[43:18] bigger than
[43:19] natural things
[43:21] so i want to make the point that it was
[43:22] a natural problem
[43:25] a material problem
[43:27] a business problem that led to
[43:30] the conflict
[43:33] it was not that lot did not believe
[43:36] it was not that lot's wife did not
[43:38] believe
[43:39] it was to create peace
[43:42] within the family that abraham as the
[43:45] senior said to the junior
[43:48] you choose for the sake of peace
[43:51] we are too good for us to have our
[43:53] people fighting like this
[43:55] it was a natural situation
[43:59] and many times in our homes and our
[44:01] families we have natural arguments
[44:04] there are people who come to church
[44:06] upset not because of a spiritual issue
[44:08] in the house but an argument in the
[44:10] house is there anybody in the house this
[44:12] morning
[44:15] an argument between husband and wife son
[44:17] and daughter oh you don't want me to
[44:18] come to your house this morning huh
[44:23] husband and wife and house and neighbor
[44:25] you on your way to church in this
[44:26] argument with your neighbor
[44:30] argument over who did breakfast and who
[44:31] washes the dishes
[44:33] natural problems and it throws the
[44:36] spiritual perspective out of line
[44:39] and under the pressure of the natural
[44:42] problem lot i want you to picture a lot
[44:44] now
[44:45] he has to make a decision abraham is not
[44:48] choosing for him
[44:49] abraham is not making a recommendation
[44:52] to him lot has to choose for himself
[44:55] and every one of us in this room this
[44:57] morning we have to choose for ourselves
[45:01] because that's how god organized it that
[45:04] you have a choice to worship or not to
[45:06] worship you have a choice to pray or not
[45:09] to pray you have a choice to believe or
[45:11] not to believe you have a choice to
[45:13] accept or not to accept you have a
[45:15] choice to come to church or not come to
[45:17] church you have a choice to pay your
[45:19] tithe or not pay your tithe you have a
[45:21] choice to pray or not to pray
[45:23] [Applause]
[45:24] you have a choice to cheat on your wife
[45:26] or not to cheat on your wife that's a
[45:28] choice
[45:29] you have a choice to save or not to save
[45:31] or you could spend your money stop it
[45:32] that's a choice
[45:37] life is about choices we're going to
[45:38] have a prayer line today and you have a
[45:40] choice how you approach the prayer line
[45:45] if you are here today because you're
[45:46] looking for a blessing or you want to
[45:48] choose life
[45:49] and choose eternity and choose
[45:51] redemption and choose not going back
[45:53] from where you came and choose real
[45:56] deliverance because repentance is not
[45:58] just saying i'm sorry it's a change of
[46:00] behavior
[46:03] are there any bible believers in the
[46:04] house this morning
[46:06] [Applause]
[46:08] i'm not going to be too long with you
[46:10] but
[46:11] we're waiting on the doctor right now
[46:13] i'm operating as a nurse right now
[46:15] because the great physician is here to
[46:16] operate
[46:17] i'm checking the blood pressure i'm
[46:20] checking your bmi i'm doing a urine
[46:22] sample this morning checking your blood
[46:24] sugar level before the doctor could
[46:26] operate making sure that the test
[46:28] results are in
[46:30] that your heart is right that your heart
[46:32] is open up so that he can operate
[46:34] without without reservation that your
[46:36] door is open because he said i stand at
[46:38] the door and knock and if any man open
[46:41] up i'm going to come in and stop with
[46:43] him
[46:43] [Applause]
[46:46] [Music]
[46:47] you may be seated
[46:48] [Applause]
[46:49] [Music]
[46:50] i saw something yesterday
[46:52] until people want to be delivered you
[46:56] will anoint them with oil and have
[46:57] greasy demons
[47:06] i say it one more time
[47:07] until people want to be delivered
[47:10] you can anoint them with oil as much as
[47:12] you want you'll have greasy demons
[47:14] the man who was beating up preachers
[47:16] when he came into the house where the
[47:18] branham was and the ministers left the
[47:20] platform and he challenged the prophet
[47:22] the prophet as a short man stood right
[47:25] there when all the other ministers ran
[47:26] for their lives when that man came up to
[47:29] the prophet the prophet said you're
[47:31] going to fall over my feet because you
[47:33] have challenged the lord he didn't
[47:35] challenge god he didn't challenge the
[47:36] prophet he challenged god because i was
[47:37] god's man
[47:43] when the police came because the police
[47:45] the law got involved see will this man
[47:46] be alright he said no
[47:49] because he worshipped the spirit that's
[47:51] upon him
[47:52] he wants to be that way
[47:55] he wants to be that way
[47:59] you have to want to be delivered i am
[48:01] tired
[48:03] of having services you talk to people
[48:05] the branham said it hurt him when he
[48:08] preached certain things and he had to
[48:09] say it over and over and over again and
[48:12] the people did not respond it wears down
[48:15] the preacher
[48:22] it's the same frustration a teacher
[48:23] would have in a school
[48:25] you stand in front of a classroom and
[48:26] you teach and you tell them you have to
[48:28] make something about yourself and they
[48:30] spend all this time the good teachers
[48:31] they do
[48:32] it and it hurts them when they see
[48:35] children with potential waste
[48:39] waste their potential
[48:49] so there is abraham
[48:51] he's waiting
[48:52] for a lot to tell him
[48:55] where he wants to go
[48:57] and the bible said that a lot
[48:59] made a decision
[49:02] he did not decide to backslide
[49:04] he didn't decide to leave the church
[49:07] he didn't decide to take his family out
[49:09] of church
[49:12] lot made a decision believing
[49:15] that it would work out
[49:20] lot made a decision believing that his
[49:22] family would maintain the values
[49:26] that they were raised up under
[49:28] lot made a decision
[49:30] at that time that he thought was the
[49:33] best decision he could make
[49:37] he made a decision not to go into sodom
[49:41] but to move close to sodom
[49:44] the baby said he pitched his tent
[49:47] towards
[49:49] he leaned in a direction
[49:52] and i shared on wednesday and i shared
[49:53] in another place i said listen what you
[49:56] may be able to handle speaking to the
[49:58] fathers in the house
[50:00] your family may not be able to handle
[50:03] because lot
[50:05] was able to survive
[50:07] this whole story as we know about
[50:10] but he lost children in the process
[50:12] he lost his wife in the process
[50:15] so weigh your decisions prayerfully
[50:18] before doing anything
[50:20] can the church say amen
[50:22] so what the bible says and
[50:25] black sliding
[50:27] i can imagine mrs lot
[50:30] gets close to sodom
[50:33] that's a look at the clothes
[50:35] look at the styles
[50:37] look at
[50:39] lot the fashion
[50:39] man of prestige he thought he made a
[50:41] good decision for his family because by
[50:43] moving close to sodom he had more
[50:45] customers
[50:47] he moved to the city
[50:49] i'm preaching it because
[50:51] they build it they planted they married
[50:55] a lot of people say a lot had two
[50:57] daughters read the bible he had more
[50:58] than two daughters because he had
[51:00] daughters who were married and they were
[51:02] sons-in-laws in scripture
[51:04] two left with him but he lost daughters
[51:06] so he had daughters who married
[51:09] lot would have built it he was a
[51:10] businessman
[51:12] he was a wealthy man because it was
[51:14] wealth that created the problem
[51:16] abraham's prosperity and lots prosperity
[51:18] grew to the point that they could not
[51:19] coexist the bible said lot was found at
[51:22] the gate of sodom the gate of sodom is
[51:25] the commercial center of the city so he
[51:28] was at the business center when these
[51:30] two angels came and he bowed down to
[51:32] them
[51:33] i said on wednesday night that god was
[51:36] finishing up with abraham and the bible
[51:37] said the angels were getting up and
[51:39] walking and the bible said abraham was
[51:41] leading them along the way when god said
[51:43] to abraham by the way shall i hide from
[51:46] you it was almost in passing that he
[51:49] stayed since that since the conversation
[51:51] he had went so well and i told him i'm
[51:53] going to return according to the time of
[51:54] life let me just share something with
[51:55] you while i'm why are we walking
[51:58] why are we walking
[52:00] i'm about to go i've heard a cry in
[52:02] sodom and i want to investigate to see
[52:04] if this thing is as bad as i'm hearing
[52:06] because if it's as bad as i'm hearing
[52:07] judgment is coming
[52:09] and i can imagine the the level that
[52:11] abraham had to have to almost hold god's
[52:14] hand if it were and say hold up hold up
[52:15] hold up
[52:18] it can be your way
[52:20] for you to just judge everybody like
[52:22] that that's not how you do things
[52:23] i'm paraphrasing now
[52:25] that's not how you operate
[52:27] you are a feared judge if there be fifty
[52:30] would you not spare them
[52:32] and god say okay i'll spare them and the
[52:34] bible said abraham started to plead he
[52:36] said i am but dust i am nobody i am
[52:38] nothing forgive me if i push it myself
[52:41] but if it's five less than 50 would he
[52:43] destroy it and we know this we
[52:45] understand this and
[52:47] abraham pleaded down to 10 and two
[52:49] angels went into sodom
[52:53] for one reason and one reason only
[52:55] deliverance
[52:57] this is a deliverance service
[52:59] one reason and one reason only
[53:01] deliverance
[53:02] because with deliverance is always
[53:04] judgment
[53:06] but as pertains to believers it's
[53:07] deliverance
[53:09] judgment is to the world so with
[53:11] deliverance is judgment
[53:14] hallelujah
[53:15] and the angels get there and we know the
[53:16] story lot brings them in the men of the
[53:19] city try to get them
[53:21] lot offers his two daughters who had not
[53:24] known men virgins
[53:26] to the men and they said we don't want
[53:27] them we want the men that came into the
[53:28] house
[53:30] when lot said no you can't have them
[53:33] the men of the city say who lotting he
[53:35] is
[53:36] you are outsider trying to fit in here
[53:37] that's i'm paraphrasing how you become a
[53:40] judge over our lifestyle
[53:42] read the bible
[53:44] and at that point the bible says that
[53:46] the angels pulled lot in
[53:48] blinded the men
[53:50] and the bible said it was only
[53:52] exhaustion
[53:54] that stopped those men in their blinded
[53:55] conditions trying to find the door
[53:58] because there was spirits upon them
[54:03] spirits upon them
[54:06] are we dealing with spiritual warfare
[54:10] lot's wife would have been seeing all of
[54:12] this interaction
[54:14] so she knows how the people live
[54:18] now many times we look at lot
[54:22] as a compromiser and in part we could
[54:24] say yes he ended up in sodom but i want
[54:27] to read one scripture for you
[54:31] to see
[54:32] how peter justified lot
[54:36] in second peter two and
[54:39] verse
[54:40] four
[54:42] ii peter two verse four for if god
[54:45] spared not the angels that sin but cast
[54:47] them down to hell and deliver them into
[54:50] chains of darkness
[54:52] to be reserved unto judgment
[54:54] and spared not the old world but save
[54:56] noah the eighth person a preacher of
[54:58] righteousness bringing in the flood upon
[55:01] the world of the ungodly
[55:03] until in the cities of sodom and
[55:04] gomorrah into ashes condemn them with an
[55:07] overthrow making them an example listen
[55:09] what sodom and gomorrah is an example
[55:12] unto those that after should live
[55:15] ungodly
[55:17] so for all
[55:19] gomorrah is a memorial to those that
[55:22] would live ungodly
[55:24] against god's way as a reminder to you
[55:26] of the consequence
[55:30] and delivered the bible goes on just lot
[55:33] so peter justified a lot
[55:35] just lot
[55:36] vexed listened a lot vexed with the
[55:39] filthy conversation of the wicked
[55:42] now there are people here this morning
[55:43] who say they want to be delivered
[55:46] are you vexed with the conversation of
[55:48] the wicked
[55:49] are you all up in the conversation
[55:55] does the conversation of the wicked
[55:56] bother you or it has have you accepted
[55:59] it and you tolerate it
[56:02] and people know that they could talk
[56:04] that way around you because you never
[56:06] fight it it never vex you have you been
[56:09] vexed
[56:10] because lot was in a messed up condition
[56:13] but the bible says he was still vexed
[56:17] with the filthy conversation of the
[56:19] wicket
[56:21] anybody with me
[56:22] have you become tolerant
[56:28] have you lowered your guard so much that
[56:30] you just allow any kind of conversation
[56:32] around you
[56:33] you know the branham said there are
[56:34] certain things he said he didn't let
[56:36] certain people into his car
[56:37] because he said one time a man came in
[56:39] the car and spoke a blue streak
[56:42] what he said had a color
[56:45] read the message
[56:47] words have power
[56:48] so lot in his condition although he was
[56:51] in a backslidden condition as it were
[56:55] found himself in sodom he was still
[56:58] vexed with the conversation we're not
[57:00] where his behavior yet
[57:03] we have rich conduct and attitude and
[57:05] the homosexuality and that's not we
[57:08] reached that party it's just a
[57:09] conversation
[57:11] it's an embarrassment when christians
[57:13] are involved in foolish conversation
[57:16] because life and death is in the power
[57:18] of the tongue and your lips your mouth
[57:20] is reserved for spoken word
[57:24] spoken word that's why you are temples
[57:27] of the holy ghost so the spoken word
[57:31] god to use you as a vessel
[57:36] let's go further
[57:38] for that righteous man so peter called
[57:40] lot a righteous man you call him
[57:42] something else now
[57:46] because the angels went into sodom to
[57:48] get the righteous
[57:50] so it was lots righteousness that
[57:53] covered his family it was lots
[57:55] righteousness that made a way for
[57:58] his family to even hear the message
[58:02] oh come on
[58:04] and you young people who want to be
[58:06] disrespectful to your parents
[58:08] it is their righteousness
[58:10] they may have false but god sees them as
[58:13] righteousness because he sees through
[58:16] the blood how dare you disrespect your
[58:19] parents
[58:20] [Applause]
[58:26] yes lot had his problems but there's
[58:28] blood for problems oh come on somebody
[58:31] help me this morning yet look messed up
[58:34] but there's blood from messing up
[58:37] oh come on somebody come on somebody
[58:41] anybody in the house this morning
[58:43] [Applause]
[58:48] so we dealt with i want to read it
[58:50] carefully because i know many of you
[58:52] have not read this scripture
[58:54] and delivered just a lot
[58:56] so peter in his ministry
[58:59] had to come in the new testament to
[59:01] justify the perception of lot
[59:05] just like who we didn't know until peter
[59:08] made it clear because if you read
[59:09] genesis alone you will see lot as this
[59:12] backslider and if it wasn't for abraham
[59:14] that had no chance
[59:16] but peter brings another perspective
[59:19] yes lock messed up yes abraham pleaded
[59:21] for him but we didn't know about the
[59:23] sighing and the crying
[59:25] that lot was going through
[59:27] the travail of a father the travail of a
[59:30] husband the travail of maybe a
[59:32] grandfather we don't know but a lot was
[59:34] there he wasn't captive but he was in
[59:37] travail
[59:39] he was in trouble but he was in travail
[59:41] of spirit travail of soul he knew he was
[59:45] not where he was supposed to be he
[59:47] didn't have the strength to deliver
[59:49] himself he needed deliverance but it was
[59:51] a travail in his spirit he was crying
[59:54] out for something
[1:00:00] anybody in the house this morning
[1:00:02] i want to read a scripture carefully
[1:00:05] and deliver just lot
[1:00:08] vexed
[1:00:10] with the filthy conversation of the
[1:00:12] wicked so the two things i want you to
[1:00:14] understand that
[1:00:15] because we had
[1:00:17] put a mark upon those who sigh and cry
[1:00:20] for the abomination in the city but what
[1:00:22] does that really mean
[1:00:25] this is it here
[1:00:27] he is vexed with the filthy conversation
[1:00:28] of the wicked
[1:00:30] sighing and crying he's burdened
[1:00:31] bothered by it and the bible goes on for
[1:00:33] that righteous man
[1:00:35] dwelling among them
[1:00:37] in seeing and hearing
[1:00:40] now we come into actions not just words
[1:00:43] in seeing
[1:00:45] and hearing
[1:00:47] vexed his righteous soul
[1:00:49] from day to day with their unlawful
[1:00:52] deeds
[1:00:54] now we're dealing with the behavior
[1:00:56] so lot is there at the gate of sodom
[1:00:59] and he's dying within himself
[1:01:02] he's dying watching his wife feed from
[1:01:04] him because she is now different from
[1:01:06] when they came to this house
[1:01:09] her behavior has changed his children
[1:01:12] who he had an expectation of the bible
[1:01:14] said that they went and found worldly
[1:01:16] men and married them and
[1:01:20] that's the bible
[1:01:24] can we go on
[1:01:26] so the angels are there with a lot to
[1:01:28] say a lot
[1:01:29] is there anybody else
[1:01:31] that you care about
[1:01:33] i want to ask this morning is there
[1:01:34] anybody else that you care about
[1:01:36] who should be delivered because we came
[1:01:38] to let you know that we have come to
[1:01:40] judge
[1:01:41] this whole city is going to be destroyed
[1:01:43] so i would advise you get your whole
[1:01:45] family
[1:01:47] get them in to hear this message
[1:01:51] the angel is specific you have
[1:01:52] son-in-law do you have any other
[1:01:53] daughters he goes down in genesis 19.
[1:01:58] and the bible says about two verses or
[1:02:00] so later
[1:02:01] lord goes to his son's in law
[1:02:04] and the bible said the in law
[1:02:06] mocked him
[1:02:09] and the bible said that lot lingered
[1:02:14] let me read it
[1:02:16] i'm almost done
[1:02:25] don't look back
[1:02:29] friends i find in genesis three kinds of
[1:02:31] believers
[1:02:36] lot sons and law
[1:02:37] were clearly unbelievers
[1:02:41] they did not believe they mocked him
[1:02:44] let me get it
[1:02:48] and lot went out and speak under his
[1:02:50] sons-in-law which married his daughters
[1:02:52] plural
[1:02:54] and said up get you out of this place
[1:02:56] for the lord will destroy the city
[1:02:58] but he seemed as one that mocked under
[1:03:00] his sons-in-laws
[1:03:02] they didn't accept it
[1:03:06] and when the morning arose at the angels
[1:03:08] he is not seeing arise
[1:03:11] take thy wife
[1:03:13] and thy two daughters which are here we
[1:03:16] don't know where the other daughters are
[1:03:17] but these that are here
[1:03:19] lest they be consumed in the iniquity of
[1:03:21] the city
[1:03:23] and i could imagine lot that my son
[1:03:26] while he lingered
[1:03:28] you know what it is as a parent to stand
[1:03:30] there
[1:03:31] and you don't know what's going on with
[1:03:32] your other daughters
[1:03:34] your son's in law
[1:03:36] you know your wife in a condition
[1:03:38] and these two daughters who have stayed
[1:03:40] with you the bible said they have not
[1:03:41] known any man they are the ones who at
[1:03:42] least try to behave
[1:03:47] so lot is lingering we don't know why
[1:03:49] he's lingering but maybe he lingered
[1:03:50] because he's hoping
[1:03:52] the other daughters come to their senses
[1:03:55] maybe he's hoping the sons and laws
[1:03:57] decide
[1:03:58] at least let me take the risk and go out
[1:04:01] what could go wrong
[1:04:03] if you write us alive if he wrong i'll
[1:04:06] come back
[1:04:08] but these young men were so
[1:04:10] delusional that didn't even take the
[1:04:13] calculated risk
[1:04:15] i want you to think about it friends
[1:04:18] i don't think you've ever heard this
[1:04:18] presented like this
[1:04:23] while he lingered the angels now are
[1:04:25] forced to take action the bible says the
[1:04:27] men laid hole upon his hand
[1:04:30] and upon the hand of his wife and upon
[1:04:32] the hand of his two daughters in other
[1:04:33] words the angels are now physically
[1:04:35] removing them
[1:04:37] they are no longer depending on words to
[1:04:39] move them brother pop well they are
[1:04:41] physically extracting them they are
[1:04:43] kidnapping them they are arresting them
[1:04:46] physically taking them out because the
[1:04:50] words were not enough lot was still
[1:04:52] lingering
[1:04:53] the air to physically take them out
[1:04:57] i want you to understand now two
[1:04:59] dimensions of this one is
[1:05:04] god is serious about deliverance
[1:05:06] so serious about deliverance that he
[1:05:08] will not just use word alone to get you
[1:05:11] he has to use force if necessary to get
[1:05:14] you
[1:05:15] [Music]
[1:05:18] he is so serious
[1:05:20] about deliverance
[1:05:21] and his promise to deliver he made a
[1:05:24] promise to abraham to get his family
[1:05:28] and god cannot break his promise
[1:05:30] so god had to have the angels them
[1:05:33] angels had their pieces on they said all
[1:05:34] the deacons are earpieces pull them out
[1:05:36] extract them now
[1:05:38] move them out now no more waiting
[1:05:40] time is gone no time left take them out
[1:05:44] put them unconscious if you have to but
[1:05:46] get them out knock them out if you have
[1:05:48] to but take them out
[1:05:50] break their foot if you have to but get
[1:05:52] them out because judgment is coming but
[1:05:55] there's a promise over them they cannot
[1:05:57] die with the rest
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:01] they must be delivered
[1:06:03] [Music]
[1:06:06] god will do whatever it takes
[1:06:08] to break you out of evil break you out
[1:06:11] of sin to break you out of the world you
[1:06:13] better believe it
[1:06:16] [Applause]
[1:06:22] can you take a little more
[1:06:24] almost done soon we finished the
[1:06:25] scripture with that
[1:06:27] and while he lingered
[1:06:29] the men laid hole upon his hand and upon
[1:06:31] the hand of his wife and upon the hand
[1:06:33] of his two daughters the lord being
[1:06:35] merciful unto him so this force this
[1:06:38] kidnapping this extraction was mercy
[1:06:43] it's like a father pulling a child
[1:06:45] roughly from a fire because a child
[1:06:47] don't know what's going to happen and
[1:06:48] the child cry because you pull them and
[1:06:51] they feel bad about being pulled but
[1:06:53] that's mercy
[1:06:55] [Applause]
[1:06:59] when the word comes to you in a way that
[1:07:00] makes you feel uncomfortable because
[1:07:02] you're not living right that's mercy
[1:07:05] because it's a judgment seat and it's
[1:07:08] just blood on the judgment seat that
[1:07:10] makes it a mercy seat
[1:07:16] the lord being merciful unto him and
[1:07:18] they brought him forth and set him
[1:07:20] without the city or outside the city
[1:07:24] and it came to pass
[1:07:26] when they had brought them fought abroad
[1:07:29] that he said escape for thy life
[1:07:31] now that to me is self-explanatory
[1:07:37] if somebody says to you brother joe
[1:07:39] run for your life that way
[1:07:41] what what what would you do
[1:07:49] escape for your life
[1:07:52] look not behind in other words don't
[1:07:53] look back
[1:07:54] neither stay at all in all the plane and
[1:07:56] then we'll do around here
[1:07:58] there's nothing more for you here
[1:08:03] less though be consumed
[1:08:08] and i'll stop reading there
[1:08:10] and work to bring this to close
[1:08:11] musicians and get ready
[1:08:26] they are challenged to move quickly
[1:08:29] but the branham in doing prayer lines
[1:08:30] and in doing ministry he would say
[1:08:34] the angel is here receive him quickly
[1:08:35] stand up right
[1:08:36] away because if you don't respond right
[1:08:39] away he said he'll move on
[1:08:43] respond quickly
[1:08:50] lot's wife would have grown up under
[1:08:52] abraham
[1:08:55] would have had the decline
[1:08:57] while she was in sodom
[1:08:59] would no doubt had known that these are
[1:09:01] angels that would have come
[1:09:03] would have seen the manifestation the
[1:09:04] blinded eyes would have heard lot repeat
[1:09:07] the message
[1:09:09] would have been told by the angels
[1:09:11] escape don't look back
[1:09:14] they start to move out
[1:09:17] it's only when they were all judgment
[1:09:19] strike so when judgment struck they were
[1:09:21] already out
[1:09:23] there was something to go back to
[1:09:24] because judgmental was already striking
[1:09:28] deeper than that
[1:09:30] in that custom lot would have been in
[1:09:32] front
[1:09:34] leading his family out
[1:09:37] friends
[1:09:38] i don't know when lot found out what
[1:09:40] happened to his wife
[1:09:44] because he couldn't look back
[1:09:46] so he is walking running moving
[1:09:49] trying to get to safety and somewhere
[1:09:51] along the journey
[1:09:54] his wife has turned to salt but he's
[1:09:55] still going
[1:09:56] maybe he was talking to them saying how
[1:09:59] are you going to be back there how are
[1:09:59] you going to be back there and then
[1:10:00] after a while he gets no response
[1:10:06] this is real friends this is not church
[1:10:11] why is he there
[1:10:13] he can't stop moving because he's a
[1:10:14] believer
[1:10:18] because god can only prove his word by
[1:10:19] believers so as a believer he has to
[1:10:21] keep moving because if he stops moving
[1:10:23] he is not a believer
[1:10:26] what if you're there yes i'm here yes
[1:10:28] i'm here wife is there wife wife
[1:10:35] no response
[1:10:38] sons and laws they were unbelievers they
[1:10:40] stayed back they were judged
[1:10:42] up until lot's wife turned around
[1:10:46] we didn't know what she was
[1:10:49] she acted like a believer
[1:10:51] she walked like a believer
[1:10:53] she talked like a believer
[1:10:55] but when she looked back she sure who
[1:10:57] she was she was a make-believer
[1:11:01] because while she was in sodom she
[1:11:02] didn't realize sodom came into her
[1:11:06] friends whatever is in your heart will
[1:11:08] come out
[1:11:11] everything as it is in darkness that you
[1:11:13] want to keep covered up is going to come
[1:11:15] out
[1:11:17] there's no secret you know you're not
[1:11:18] hiding nothing anymore
[1:11:26] i want you to wonder i'm you you can
[1:11:28] make that place something softly
[1:11:31] that's why if she's walking out she
[1:11:32] hears it she
[1:11:34] she believes
[1:11:35] she's hearing the cries she's hearing
[1:11:37] the judgment she's seeing a lot moving
[1:11:40] the daughters may be behind her and
[1:11:43] something is eating her up
[1:11:46] because they were telling her to come
[1:11:47] out of sodom but nobody had taken what
[1:11:49] was in her out of here
[1:11:54] lot couldn't deliver himself
