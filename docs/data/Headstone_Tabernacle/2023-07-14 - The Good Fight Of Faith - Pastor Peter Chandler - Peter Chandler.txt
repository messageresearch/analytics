Germany God bless you and his wife here God bless blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah so before we get into the service just want to read a scripture you don't have to understand this note is from second Timothy there's no also that in the last days perilous time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own self Covetous boosters proud blasphemers disobedient parents I'm thankful and holy without natural affection through speakers false accusers incontinent fears to spices of those are the good treat us minded lovers of Pleasures with our lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power of the Earth from such turn away for of this short a day which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women living with sins the letter we were divers lost ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of Truth No as Jonathan Chambers which took Moses so these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for the Folly shall be made manifest also unto all men as theirs also was but we know the inspiration we have contending for the fit and yet there's a prophecy that says here as Jonathan Chambers which said Moses so these resist the truth men of corrupt mice now we're not talking about people outside the message this is a message now and this whole list that is listed here is church folks that's not unbelievable church folks heading high-minded love of his presence but their doors that will be fighting for defeat that was once delivered to the Saints praise God but a Branham in a message called uh anointing was at the end time he was talking about ever learning never able to come to know the truth and here's the shocking here's a shocking part listen to this and he read the scripture here as Janice and jambased with sir Moses so these also reaches the truths men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning defeat which has wanted for the sins of course considering the faith and he shall turn the faith the children back to the feet of the fathers they're very objective of God send a prophet was not to argument and debate and church and who know was eternal Hearts back to the faith of the father that was the motive that was the intent of God that we turned right back to what they had back there isn't that right praise God no reprim with considering the faith if you've got a school field Bible here it says apostasy apostasy is what abandonment of principle on principal people now watch he says now watch I want then after he read that he read Luke 18 about the parable of the city of a judge with fear that God we know the scripture and we don't say avenge me and then he closed off with saying I tell you he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and then brother branham's got to go down into it now he said no that's the question here is the way I want to get to in Revelation 10 he said in the days of the message of the seventh Angels the mystery of God ought to be finished here is the question if you will follow in that line in this hour will it be finished will I find faith will Malachi 4 be fulfilled at this time restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers the original word praise God reprobates Johnson jambres you're talking about having a form of godliness anointed ones you see the anointed ones Matthew 24 24 these are the Church of anointed ones second Timothy edian minded and there is a spirit of Christ which is found in second Peter 1 4-7 which is fate and virtual knowledge that is Christ's spirit and upon that you have Ephesians for a genuine faithful Ministry who praise God do you get that tonight praise God there's a genuine faithful ministry under that praise God the Holy Spirit praise God anointed man of God and I believe in my heart that God won't inspire you anointed you because we have anointed Sons inspired Sons do you believe that nobody Madam says here no go back reprogates concerning not reprobate in living they are fine cultured men so not living part is the faith part oh praise be to Jesus so he had to fight for that fate oh blessed be the name of the day and today I want to salute brother Peter Chandler you appreciate him this morning I want to salute with a Peter Chandler a humble servant of God went through hell but biters heaters all man of spirits but survive and he survived the test of time and with all their taxis still smelling sweet as a rose praise God Amen and what I love about him and appreciate him about him is his sincerity and love for the Lord and love for God's people not just people in this church but for wherever he is he has a true Shepherd's Heart praise God but before he comes to us and and brother Peter is what I call a time-tested memorial before he comes to us we have another time-tested Memorial one who have stood the test of time I'm not a humble Soul recently lost his precious wife going on to be with the Lord and his brother Shem Ali and he's going to come and bring greetings for us [Applause] come to us tested over time you know what reprimand is people changing Doctrine changing they believe they no longer believe there's the they no longer believe the prophet they change what they had conviction years ago they no longer have it they have a new teacher new new Mysteries that God did not reveal but we thank God for his grace and mercy one thing I like about Hashem I call him a man of class they have some people do things classy but he is such a mama and I like that God bless you my brother has there been greetings to the Bride of Jesus Christ God is Sir goodness [Music] yes oh God he's so good to me God answers [Music] foreign [Music] and

horse pasture Butterfield could you just be seated also the associate ministers who serve together with him right here at headstone Tabernacle and of course my heartfelt gratitude to all the Servants of God who have journeyed him from various countries around the world to be part of these meetings your participation in the staging of these meetings is very much in keeping with the scriptures in Revelation chapter 5 verse 9 where it says that Christ had redeemed us to Gordon by his blood out of every kind Jordan and tone on people and Nation and so friends it is my great joy that I stand this afternoon to greet this wonderful Gathering amen of the multi-membered mystical body of our Lord Jesus Christ in paragraph 29 of the message ten virgins and 144 thousand the product the prophet of God made this remark now the first three chapters of Revelation deals with the church the Gentiles Jewish Ethiopian Africans every type of people in the world goes to the Gentiles to make up this body black White Brown everything it's a bouquet of flowers and that's right that God puts on his altar and that's made up of all Nations kindreds tongues and people then in a message super signed 1962 the prophet tells us that's the way we can do harmonize in different opinions we still harmonize because we are God's people all marching together with one great purpose to win souls of Christ and may it ever be that way made his great bouquet of God's Gathering Together here be an everlasting bookie until he comes to take us home so as we come together this afternoon special mention was again be made of many International visitors who have come to support these meetings those who have made great sacrifices and have traveled long distances to be in attendance May O Lord Jesus Christ richly reward you for your efforts and may your time of Fellowship together prove to be brought to meaningful and memorable even at the Soviet David once declared behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity after being asked to make this small contribution I immediately begun to reflect upon the team chosen for this year's convention earnestly contending for defeat once delivered inspired words recorded in the book of Judah and friend this afternoon amen as I give careful taught amen the Jews opening remarks I decided to consult the prophet as I always do in a message contending for the faith 53 paragraph 11. now how marvelous earnestly contending for defeat there was once delivered to the Saints and that word marvelous struck me Prophet says how marvelous amen and the word marvelous means of how exciting amen how wonderful how extremely good unpleasing to be partaken amen of the miraculous condensed can tendon for defeat 54-24 Now what is to contend Prophet asks a question consent contend is a just stand there and hold fast on your conviction earnestly contending for defeat not aphid defeat amen praise His name the word also contended means also amen that you fight strenuously for the defense of the feet which was once amen for all handed down to the Saints so important was the message to the Saints of Daddy and even today amen when you look very carefully at the scripture again you realize that it speaks specifically of treatings earnestly amen contending and faith amen earnestly saints of God and it has to do with a greater extent amen more intensely more intensely than before seriously and sincere in our intentions whatever we do for the kingdom of God we must do it with zeal [Music] and with a certain degree of enthusiasm [Applause] and that is a reason amen why that's wider spiritual inspired you to to use the word earnestly it also means to pursue when sincere an intense convictions amen it is said that Earnest people are said to be very serious in the way they approach every task that is entrusted to them and most certainly friends and amen this is the kind of attitude that we must all have When approaching our god-given responsibility using the Wilderness earnestly Jesus and Gethsemane prayed more earnestly Luke 22 44 and this was when he was facing the greatest challenge institutely Ministry Elijah prayed earnestly that it might not rain James 5 17. for three and a half years not one drop of reinfelted Youth and even as it relates to to the changing of our bodies the Apostle Paul tells us second Corinthians 5 and 2 that we must earnestly desired Amen to be clothed upon with our house so which is from above amen the scripture said we said earnestly contend amen and upon here in them this word Contender it reminds it reminded amen of the factors amen that our stand for the message will not go on a post amen because at no time just the enemies stand heilbacher amen while we walk in the planning prophecy which God had ordained for us according to what Paul writes in Ephesians 6 and 12 were wrestling against flesh and blood but again principalities and again Powers against the rulers of of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places amen so important with this message you sorry amen so real is the opposition chasing us to be friends amen that we I know like those who in the days of the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem with some water Block in one hand and a sword in the other fighting all the critics of and the Skeptics and the false accusers even though we press towards them the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus to contend also means to have a amen saints of God amen of Faith Saints that was once delivered unto this the Saints not twice delivered but once delivered once delivered them unto the Saints amen those who have to received the truth must contend for it and must be bold and courageous in doing it this evening amen this is the truth around which we are all gathered this evening amen the body of revealed true to to which we all believe amen and is what gives us the basis for Fellowship is what gives us the basis for Fellowship not regardless of the little differences of opinion which may sometimes attempt to keep us divided yet we all won in Christ Jesus for by one spiritual we all baptize into one body which makes us all Heirs of of the common salvation according to Ephesians 4 amen there is one body one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and the father of all who is above all and through all in you own I conclude God bless you richly may the great Holy Spirit so anointed servants over the course of these meetings that brought to believe in presence and those across the season with experience more than a weekend of just good preaching but the Apostle Paul said First Corinthians 2 and 4. my speech on my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and Power and may also bring greater spiritual insight an illumination an Enlightenment and understanding amen and agree to a

to the scripture where you go into this tremendous uh scripture called Proverbs eight if you want a blessing go home and read that it deals with the person of wisdom such a point that it even says uh doth not wisdom cry death and understanding put forth her voice they contend their wisdom is not uh afraid intimidated wisdom is not a compromiser if you ever see an ego compromise that is wisdom a weird content wisdom is not afraid to talk and to say so in fact wisdom goes very deep and says if you hate wisdom you love death read that tonight you will be blessed by Proverbs 8 Matthew 11 continues to say from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of Heaven's suffereth violence and the violent take it by force let's touch on Matthew 19 he said unto him okay because of the hardness of your heart he suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning the original thing from the beginning it was not so the original faith and where are we Philippians 3 14 I individually press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus Timothy says take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save yourself and them that hear thee my title Timothy 6 1 Timothy 6 fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life we're unto Thou Art also called and professed a good profession watch out people are watching a good profession before many witnesses and finally Jude beloved when I gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write to you and exhort you that you should earnestly what's that word contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints let us pray amen Lord Jesus we approach unto you thank you for the real honor to be speaking what the prophet has already bought to say what he said and to live what he lived we thank you Lord that we are contending for the faith because love is corrective and we are therefore contending for this original faith that has fallen into our hands through your Vindicated Prophet Malachi 4. bless every hearer both locally and online we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you may take your seat amen with the permission of the pastor I'm just going to remove my jacket thank you Hallelujah can we shall Glory Hallelujah fight the good fight of faith I'm moving quickly because I can feel something pulling hallelujah it's so good to see you oh I will take the whole hour just just saying how I feel seeing you all it says we believe this Faith let's let's say what it is we believe in an Apostolic Church would you know and believe that all of the signs and the Wonders that was spoken by our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany his church until he returned no wonder Pastor has called this inspiration we've got to contend for that and not let it slip amen we believe in those things you see that acts there it doesn't say Acts of the Apostles it's the acts of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and it goes away believe in those things and that they are to be set in order contended for praise be to God as we go over to the next slide this is a word I'm interested in interest praise God I'm interested he says brother Branham goes on to say now all I'm interested in friends what are out there pray for the sick okay fine but in here I'm interested in one thing and that is God's Born Again Church that's right that's what I'm interested in anyhow I'm not interested in you know by laws deacons what's it uh orders of churches I'm interested in the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon the church for this day Hallelujah that we are living in that's the fundamental part that is the fundamental of the mechanics and the Dynamics there is the mechanics Aquila and Priscilla they they corrected Apollos they said come on Apollos it's not the baptism of John we can we are contending there's more come come let's talk that was the mechanics you've got your content for the mechanics but pastor we have to contend for the Dynamics as well because they work as they come together Hallelujah shout them in somebody I'm interested in making the Rapture I'm interested in having rapturing faith I'm interested in the bride Gathering Together I'm interested in knowing how to prepare I'm interested hey man in all these things I'm interested Amen in being adopted are you interested are you interested I'm interested Hallelujah I'm interested glory in the Gathering of the Bride together I'm interested Hallelujah I'm interested in that I'm not interested in Hollywood and all those things I have interest in these things praise be to God the true bride will be interested in these things no matter what the devil tries to do stay interested in the Rapture Hallelujah glory to God can we shout Glory Hallelujah we can go over Brothers the wise virgins be seated if you like the wise virgins were interested in oil five were not interested they let their lamps go out but five were interested in having enough oil he said now one you can't say you know sanctify oh they were all sanctified every one of them Sanctified but five was wise wisdom the person of wisdom Hallelujah wisdom amen is not afraid to speak wisdom will will contend for the faith that was once delivered for what the apostles had Hallelujah five was wise enough to have the wisdom of Revelation to catch that door see and to be filled with the spirit Hallelujah they had oil in their lamps the others had no oil they had a lot of politics and everything look fight the good fight let's not fight the political fight hey man let's not fight the church fights let's fight a good fight Hallelujah Satan knows it was a good fight we've got to fight a good fight we've got to love our enemies fight a good fight praise be to God Amen Oil in their lamps and when they were awakened the other said give us of your order there's no oil left praise be to God we've got to be interested it's not just being uh fundamental and saying well yeah I believe that God is real it goes beyond that let's let's say another wise person his name was Abel the message is earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints oh I can see Abel's hands become bloody I see the white wool bleeding bleeding I see Abel's hands become bloody I see the white wolf you say and then hanging that little lamb bloody God looked down said that's it that's it a bleeding lamb brother animal rights we wouldn't like this this quotation oh you're so cruel to animals but God said that's it you've got it there is God's provided sacrifice there is the faith that was once delivered to the Saints who was Abel's lamb Abel had the wisdom of he was interested in blood Kane was interested in nice things his achievements but Abel was interested in blood hanging bleeding bleeding dying the Abel's lamb that's it that's it the faith that was once delivered to the Saints can we have a big Amen on that let's go over brothers let's go over to Cain now let's make a big statement this is powerful if all you have to do is just believe that is God you kneel down and worship if that's all you do Cain was justified if that's all you have to do is just believe and you'll kneel down and it came was justified it goes beyond that cane he said the Bible said that even the devil believes that's the truth and the devil publicly confessed Jesus Christ to be the Son of God that didn't save them brother we'd better get that straightened out one of these days gonna be a mistake made there's gonna be a mistake one of these days because somebody is right and somebody is wrong you better take what the Bible said this was a fight this in fact it cost able his life it cost him his life because just for having that Revelation can kill him it cost him his life brother it's a fight the good fight of faith when I would do good evil is present you'd better make up your mind I'm gonna fight a good fight for the Lord I'm going back to the apostolic Hallelujah I'm gonna have what they had because my Prophet is Malachi for Hallelujah shall I give you some examples okay let's have about four see how we go brothers let's go across to another wise woman amen she came into the room everybody was just carrying on like business as usual while Jesus came humbly sat in the corner Simon the host he said oh welcome Jesus Oh welcome you welcome you just just like another man but this woman was contending [Applause] this is not just another man this is the mighty Son of God here she kneeled down at his feet she wasn't doing it for politics she was contending that Jesus needed to be worshiped Hallelujah you must worship the Son of God hallelujah can we shout a big Hallelujah and then Simon [Applause] if he was a prophet if he was a prophet here comes the fight if he was a prophet he would know what kind of woman she is and he was being he had a perspective and he was telling him that he should have known what kind of woman this was but he turned he says listen Simon I've got something to say to you I've got something to say to you hey man I've got something to say you never kissed me welcome you never tell me I was welcome to come in to your house but this woman this woman has has continually kissed my feet oh he he says he says he looked at her hair hanging down she was a bad girl but he said he says her tears stringing down listen to what he says to her your sins which were many are all forgiven Hallelujah Hallelujah can be shot a big amen hallelujah all your sins what a fight that was you know what it's like sometime when you want to worship God you sometimes have to fight to shout you have to fight to raise those hands you have to fight to say hallelujah you have to fight to lift him up but don't worry he will forgive you and he will bless you Hallelujah be seated we go to another fight Bartimaeus amen bought a mess he wanted reality he wanted all the man wanted was reality he wasn't there just to be seen he didn't have a nice time and just come to church he wanted a reality he says they went out of Jericho and a great number of people son of Timaeus stopped begging and when he heard it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry and to say Jesus the son of David have mercy on me brother it wasn't his physical voice but he had the faith to stop the Sun Bartimaeus stopped the sun the sun was walking and Bartimaeus stopped the sun Hallelujah son stands Terror he had that Faith to stop the sun hallelujah hallelujah he stopped the Sun amen but as soon as you have that faith the fight starts many charged him saying hold your peace man oh but what did he do he am I right he cried a great deal more he turned up the volume tell me to keep quiet he turned up the volume hallelujah amen what can we say turn up the volume my brother if you're fighting a fight turn up the volume turn up the volume you will win you will win Jesus is the winner man Hallelujah I feel good I feel good sorry glory to God he turned up the volume Hallelujah son of David even louder have mercy on me it's a fight it's a fight it's a good fight of Faith but turn up the volume turn up the volume Hallelujah can we shall Glory Hallelujah glory to God I feel so happy thank you Brothers here's another fight these people he said when he came he came into Jerusalem you can't be seated for a moment he said he he he wasn't The Taste they wanted so the fight is starting already he wasn't there he said who's this fella what's all this racket about but a bunch of peasants I'm glad I'm a peasant down at the gate breaking off palms and making a noise tell them to hold their peace just like you told bottom is shut up you tell them to hold their peace he said they make us nervous they're screaming screaming Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna let me tell you what he says if they hold their peace that rocks will cry out the Son of God must be worshiped he must be worshiped Hallelujah he must be worshiped fight the good fight of faith I don't care what's happened praise the Lord I don't care what happened yesterday praise the Lord glory to God hallelujah anyhow praise the Lord their hearts baby watch this one oh this this blows my mind but always he says he came upon a little white mule are you ready it was a type of his second coming [Music] the second time from Heaven riding on a white mule coming over the hill nobody paid but those that were looking for him they cut down branches they run screaming Hosanna Hosanna son of David they were thrilled above measure they was expecting him they were saying don't you know who this is amen wisdom was crying out wake up this is the Son of God here let's worship him he's in the room today let's worship him let's lift him up hallelujah hallelujah glory to God I feel so good I feel so glad that we know who he is recognizing your day and his message let's go Brothers now let's come to another repeat because these things you know when he came to Jerusalem everything repeated the Hypocrites were there the religious were there the unbelievers were there everybody but the Believers were there and the Believers are all shouting and saying praise be to God he says it reminds me of the Revival of these coming days he says God in his Revival every age every time and in every place has done the same thing Hallelujah in the days of Moab hallelujah look at that that was a powerful all they wanted to do is pass through he said no no Holy Ghost no no holy rule is coming through here he said he said Israel was coming out of Egypt Israel was a group of people lived in tents they come they come out of Egypt on their road to the promised land there was Moab there he would not let them he put up it was embargo something you're not coming through here you Holy Rollers you're not coming through there and they're Moab he would not let them pass through they didn't want them bunch of holy rollers in their country they wouldn't have it Moab was stopping them when you're a Holy Roller there's gonna be a fight there's gonna be a fight somebody's gonna say you ain't coming here with that holy ghost stuff but he was fighting a losing battle he was fighting a losing battle it became a fight it became a fight the angel of God got involved a donkey got involved God got involved a prophet got involved this was a fight this was a fight ah let's go get Balaam tell him you come here and you prophesy prophesy against these people they love you say what we tell you God got so crossed with Baylor I tell you God got soaked he sent an angel down there hallelujah amen he sent an angel down there to to to to block him to stop him he was so angry with with with Balaam for even thinking that he's going along on the donkey the donkeys start to see more than even than the right is seeing the donkey he start to push this way himself start to beat him the donkey said I'm going this way he start to beat the donkey again then he beat the donkey till the donkey started to say why you beat me three times a donkey can count you know one two three why you beat me three times why you beat me three times that donkey was contending [Music] he was contending Hallelujah he had more sense than the rider [Applause] am I not your donkey look is this like me I've carried you all this time pay it up said okay okay that's true then I could say some things I tell you I could say some things then he saw what the donkey saw and he fell on his face and the angel said listen guy you you I would have spared the Donkey and killed you but because you've done this you better stop listen Balaam said the angel say what he said [Applause] say what he said don't invent say what he said went down let's read this he says it truly Pastor this is just too this is just too much so there was a big fight in in the land of Moab he says that and he here's the you could just be seated because this is mind-blowing he said that bunch of Israelites it was true they had done every dirty thing that was on the counter to do they they weren't you know they had they had done it he says but when God spoke through Balaam he said listen guys I've got to say what God tells me I can't I can't get into politics I've got to say what God told me when God spoke through Balaam he said I have not beheld him by the utmost parts I beheld him from the hilltop [Applause] Hallelujah I have not conceived iniquity in Jacob I'll be one of them in a few minutes I've not seen any iniquity in Jacob shall I read you what he said oh man somebody shall Glory [Applause] he hath not be held iniquity in Jacob sorry Moab sorry balak he hath not be held iniquity in Jacob neither have he seen perverseness in Israel the Lord God the Lord is with him and the shout of a king is among them hallelujah hallelujah who can shout Amen to these things [Applause] sorry Balaam that's what God Said God was for Israel all these critics have better shut their mouths because there's something amongst us that they don't understand but we are contending for this Faith you can be seated Saints let me just press on the carry on Brothers nice look here's the problem this Holy Ghost bunch this Holy Ghost Bunch people don't want the reality of the Holy Spirit they don't want to act any different to than what they always act but when you become a Christian you are a peculiar person you are a royal priesthood you are a strange Nation uh odd people do odd things strange things and becoming to the world and when you're in the world you're Unbecoming to God one is vice versa to the other your problem is even you're in Heavenly places that's your problem he says one makes you act like they do in heaven my precious brother Hallelujah If my people go in those people will go in what makes you act like you're on Earth you get when you have have Jesus you have Heavenly interest [Applause] if you're Earthly you have Earthly interests if you're heavily you have Heavenly wisdom if you're Earthly you have Earthly wisdom he says he says one makes you act and if people want to act like they do on Earth and then say they're going to heaven what a disappointment that's going to be what a disappointment that's going to be praise be to God hallelujah what can we say to these things amen amen amen we are talking now about being a contender Paul contended for the faith for the unadulterated interpretation of God's word he blasted can we all say blasted every one of those synagogues it cost him his life it cost Abel his life you see how we could go down to iranius the messenger of the next Church age Martin these people contended for the faith they blasted that age where are we Saint Martin blasted his age then Luther he blasted his age he said this is not the literal body and he threw the community on the floor wisdom crying out in every Church age he blasted that Catholic Church let's move on to the next one Brothers it continues John Wesley he stood up with a message of the second work of Grace sanctification and he blasted the Anglican Church with the gospel Trump would prepare for war fight the good fight uh where are we now laodicean age again they have denominated Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Luther Pentecostals and we are looking for a prophet somebody shout Glory to blast this age and to turn them back from their iniquity now if that's been the trend that's the regular strike all the way going down will God change his trend for this day he can't change it he will never change it there's gonna be a blasting with this message and we're gonna say what he said let's clap those hands God bless you Hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord oh my brother I love this one I love this one brother Bosworth was a faith contender I love this he had a debate was it what was it a gathering it was a big thing to talk to Mr best and he said missed Mr buzzworth I just want to ask Mr best what was he doing contending for healing is that right contending that healing is correct I just want to ask Mr best one question was the Redemptive names of Jehovah apply to Christ one question if you just answer it that's all Mr best didn't know what to say because Mr Bosworth wiped him out with one scripture he was Jehovah Rapha he was Jehovah man I said if he wasn't we look for another another messenger I love this Bosworth contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints let's move on Brothers brother Branham was a contender as well I love this brother Branham was contending against the trinity and this woman to say they tell me you're a preacher he said I am said well what do you think about this brother Branham contending for the Faith said it's the devil told him straight just tell the truth never mind the consequences just tell the truth [Music] how'd you say it's the devil he said well you've got so much power knock it down then he said I don't have any power I don't have any power Hallelujah but I'm here representing one I said Lord Jesus you said in Mark 16 in my name in my they shall cast out devils now that your servant may know as the battle lays before me the good fight of faith I said I command that table to fall down in the name of the holy church nothing happened it stayed right there I said I command that table to fall down there in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost nothing happened it stayed right there I said I command that table to fall down in the name of Jesus Christ and it fell so hard it broke all the legs man let's cut those Hands for Jesus Hallelujah contending for the faith praise be to God father son Holy Ghost won't work if anybody here is baptized in those titles it won't work that's why I've been so zealous for the seed because you can't just say this should work it won't work it won't work he said the head said the works that I do you shall do the body so the head says the body will do the same works as the head amen he said he says why I have been so zealous contending for the seed because not every idea will work not every motivator online will work it's got to be the seed it's got to be the seed of God we'll possess the gates of the enemy it's got to have seed to fall on church this is very serious we must contend for the seed because the seed will possess every gate that's where the power is I've been so zealous of being contending for the seed let's go Brothers we're moving along nicely he said now last Sunday I preached on the key if the key is not right the door won't open it's got to be right he said and the key is faith let's talk about faith let's finish off with that so Faith takes the little hinges of scripture and unlocks the glories and the good of God out to his people so if Faith holds the key that unlocks Christ to the people and locks it reveals it so today today we're gonna take that same key thank God for that same key to un where are we to to to unlock the way to become a virtuous Christian in the Statue of God and be a living Tabernacle for a living God to dwell in Hallelujah there's only one key amen when God opens no man can shut it blessed be the name of the Lord many shall run to and fro it won't work but they that know their God shall do exploits in that day God's Revelations to his church sit still a little flock positionally stay where you are Keep Holding On don't worry God is waiting God is trying pressing press contending pushing to get the mystery to his church that is what's holding back the rapture yeah that's what's holding back the coming of Christ and the great Millennium this great power that lays dormant in the church praise be to God that they that know their God church say they shout to exploits you've got to know your God you've got to know what works and what doesn't work you can't just guess it's not a time for guesswork listen I believe that through these Thunders will be revealed in the last days to get the bride together for rapturing Faith because brother what we've got right now what does it say what we it wouldn't be able to do it with something we've got to step further we can't have enough faithful Divine Healing but we've got to have enough faith brother we are contending for that faith to be changed in a moment and swept up out of this Earth and after a while we'll find where it's written it's not a game friends we've got a content for this faith we've got to look for what the apostles had we're going to talk about that a bit more before we close let's just move on Brothers we've got a a very important thing faith is unconscious many people say if only I had faith faith it doesn't mean long drawn out prayer meetings it doesn't mean long fast faith is an unconscious thing you've got it and you don't know you've got it brother there's such faith in this place Pastor such faith is here I wonder if we realize how much faith is in here you watch these meetings Hallelujah faith is unconscious your real faith that's what we're contending for you don't know the faith you've got yeah it's an unconscious matter with you can you imagine Jesus wondering oh can I raise Lazarus he had already seen the vision he never questioned his faith now before we can have faith we've got to have some Foundation you see the title of fundamental Foundation of Faith we've got to have a foundation there's got to be something behind it and we've got a content for that not I'm trying to believe that won't work listen to The Prophet deep caused the Deep and then I've got the picture there but it's in the message why we're not a denomination you remember what he said he says let your faith run out to its end your faith I believe I believe I think I will let that run out let that run out till you begin to believe then let your subconscious go to acting then the faith the faith of God will back it up and you'll go right on out because your faith won't do much I'm trying to believe I'm trying hard to really hold on that won't do much but your subconscious has to move in the direction that your faith is moving then God's faith God's faith Moves In now is not your faith it is God's faith ah the faith of the son of God is now in you your faith it won't do much trying oh I I think I believe look that won't do much we are contending for a bigger stronger more powerful subconscious faith introduced by Malachi 4. Hallelujah then your faith won't do much God's faith Moves In if it's your faith you say oh I've got it and your subconscious is saying I wonder if it'll work on me so brother Brown the faith that he gave us is an unconscious face shall I explain some more let's go here it's like the captain of a ship the captain gives the order but it's the man in the engine room that carries it out the captain El Capitano he says Full Speed Ahead and nothing happens because the engine man hasn't put to the fire on the engine to make it no matter how much it Full Speed Ahead it will only happen if the Angelman does his job because mental faith is not and today what we will have let there be squirrels and there's no squirrels because they has to agree with the engine man Hallelujah can somebody shall Glory [Applause] [Music] here's your first conscience the faith that is contended for here's your subconscious now this conscious subconscious is what I'm trying with the Holy Spirit to work on that's what I'm doing and he proved that he said a prophet they're both together a prophet anyway he says this first conscious I might ask this man do you believe and he'll say oh yes sir I believe remember that little sister with the bracelet and the prophet said you don't believe sister you you don't you think you believe you don't believe amen and the prophet demonstrated this is real something's about to happen this message has such a power [Music] but what we're dealing with Pastor here what I love what you said earlier is unfeigned faith which means unpretended faith you've got to Faith is something you know you can't pretend it the devil's no but when you know that you know that you know it's different then the subconscious is what I'm talking about oh you believe he says this man down here he's the one that runs the ship not the man in the PowerHouse is the man in the engine room contending for the faith praise be to God this is where my climax here he says that's what it takes the perfect Faith to ignite the power of the Holy Ghost which we have now since he's come upon us whoa to ignite see the faith something that presents it to you with a heart full of joy you walk in the sacrum knowing what you've got to say you walk in there and you know what's going to happen you know just trying to believe you know it and brother I can boldly say today I know there's going to be a rapture I know my family is going to be saved praise God something presents it to you watch over here I'm a musician you can make your way I'm finishing now he said earnestly contending for the faith you know when when Saul was converted it was a very Supernatural day it was a supernatural day because soul I don't mean to say but it was almost comparable to Moab he was against the Holy Rollers but the angel got involved you see when Osborne tackle Mr best the angel got invoked and they took a photo that Mr best could see it was the angel it was not just Bosworth it was the angel over the prophet contending for the faith let me just bring this out earnestly containing for the faith he said ananas when Paul this was okay my closing thought musicians is the faith that the apostles had watch what happened here Paul he got converted for a start he was doing the wrong thing he meant well but he was going to attack God's people so the angel got involved so so who are you I'm Jesus you're persecuting Jesus come on Saul come on and then so so who he was next thing here's the faith he said ananias came down and he saw what the vision told him so something's going on Christ is among the apostles he saw the vision he went down to the street called straight how did he know by by a vision he walked in laid his hand said brother Saul the Lord appeared to you this way this way he sent me to lay hands on you but you might receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost are you ready for this if that isn't the faith that was once delivered to the Saints I don't know what is that's when Christ is among his people let's clap those hands we're finishing off now when Ann and asked could take over just pick it up off the flyer tremendous flyer there they had faith in a Resurrected living Christ someone who rose from the dead and was living amongst them the same as he was before he died that's what we're contending for see they were condemning enough for some historical Affair but a living Christ a resurrected one who was in their minds let's go to because the next slide follows perfectly watch this he said in the days of the seals which is these days the mystery of God will be finished in other words God would be known to his church not as three people that won't work he says but as one person the mystery of God will be revealed because that was completely revealed then the seven Mysteries were open to the church because in there the church would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out in and out in and out showing his signs of being alive he's going to move in and out of these meetings it will be Jesus the resurrected Jesus he's gonna move in and out and in because we're living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit being alive then we're worshiping the living Christ that's amongst us let's clap those hands we've got just one more I think yeah this is my last slide there look let's summarize everything when you're ready I'm sure you've got the right song brother Anthony amen when the battle's over we shall wear a crown Hallelujah what's my title the good fight off hey let's close off now it's all love it's all that's what our message is that's the faith of God it's all love everything is real brother everything is real sister over there is not just Oh Heaven he said that's what I'm striving for do you hear that word striving can I say contending that's what I'm striving for that's what I'm placing for I said oh Lord that's what I'm here at church for I'm trying to set the church in order I'm telling you brother sister there's only one thing that can ever enter there is divine love let's clap those hands well I just tell a story [Applause] Hallelujah all right yeah the inspiration today church as I close and brother Anthony prepares a song this message is so real you know it's it's a it can't fail he couldn't trust it with an Angel it had to be a prophet it had to happen something's going on Church there was an experiment our um inspiration contending for the faith some scientists they got a bird the bird name was a wren w-r-e-n a red bird rent w-r-e-n translators w-r-e-n and they they took this poor bird and they kept it for years generation after generation after generation they said this bird will forget how to build a nest and they kept this bird for for years and Next Generation in a box next Generation in a box Next Generation in a box Next Generation in a box and they were convinced they were fighting to prove this bird will forget how to build a nest generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of a box till it came to the day I love this inspiration until they had to prove if their theory was right and after all those years they took this poor bird that had been in a box for years and all his children grandchildren been in a box and they said now they threw the bird up and you know the first thing it did it build a nest Hallelujah contending for the faith that was delivered to the Saints over the Raymond Hallelujah contending glory to God hallelujah what can we say to these things [Applause] something in the bird couldn't be eliminated and Satan has tried Church age after church age after church age after churches they will forget the original faith but we've got news for them
