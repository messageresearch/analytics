[13:05] Kell I read it there over this afternoon
[13:08] while picking up my guitar from the
[13:09] repair
[13:10] shop uh the Lucia asked me what I was
[13:15] doing
[13:16] tonight when I told him we had prayer
[13:18] meeting he grew very serious and asked
[13:22] if he would remember him in
[13:24] prayer in talking to him I found him to
[13:28] be a man very much hungering and
[13:29] thirsting for
[13:31] righteousness I shared my testimony with
[13:33] him and he said wo it sounds like you
[13:37] were delivered he said yes and shared
[13:41] about the Holy Spirit coming into to do
[13:43] the work and Acts 2:38 as the promise I
[13:47] don't know who was more affected myself
[13:49] or him upon my leave and he tanked me
[13:52] his name is Henry Lewis if he would
[13:55] please remember him in prayer so let's
[13:57] bhead
[13:59] as you want to
[14:00] pray Heavenly Father we thank you for
[14:03] tonight and we thank you for guiding us
[14:06] together and I pray that you would visit
[14:08] us Lord by the little word of exaltation
[14:12] and by your presence coming down upon
[14:14] every life in every home everyone who
[14:17] choose to join here that you would visit
[14:19] them and bless them in a powerful way
[14:23] father we bring Mr Henry Lewis before
[14:26] you and I pray you would deliver him
[14:29] and touch his life we use brother Kelly
[14:33] to win that soul and bring that Soul
[14:36] into this glorious Kingdom Grant Lord
[14:40] that if he's sick and body whatever the
[14:42] condition is that you will touch him and
[14:45] visit him deliver him and save him in
[14:48] Jesus name I ask it and as we get here
[14:51] now into our session I pray you visit us
[14:55] by your spirit and by Your Word in Jesus
[14:57] name I ask it amen
[15:00] and other script like to read from
[15:02] Matthew Chapter
[15:05] 13 familiar scripture
[15:08] 3-9 Matthew Chap 13:
[15:11] 3-9 and he spake many things unto them
[15:14] in Parable saying Behold a s went forth
[15:17] to swow and when he swed some seeds fell
[15:21] by the way side the fs came and devoured
[15:24] them some fell upon Stony places where
[15:29] they had not much Earth and forward they
[15:31] sprung up because they had no deepness
[15:36] of the
[15:37] earth and when the sun was up they were
[15:40] scorched because they had no root they
[15:42] wither away some fell among thorns and
[15:46] the torn sprung up and choked them but
[15:49] other fell upon under good ground and
[15:51] brought for fruit some 100f some 64 some
[15:56] 34 what iss to hear him here
[15:59] may God bless his word
[16:02] now but Bram always said that God told
[16:06] him this if you will get the people to
[16:09] believe
[16:10] you and be sincere when you pray nothing
[16:14] will stand before the
[16:17] prayer now that's the thing be sincere
[16:21] when I pray and get the people to
[16:25] believe so let's just zoom in on that a
[16:28] minute
[16:29] minute what this also tells us is that
[16:33] you can
[16:34] pray without being
[16:37] sincere
[16:39] note God did not tell him because you
[16:41] are Prophet or you are gifted or you a
[16:44] minister or preacher or whatever I will
[16:47] answer your
[16:48] prayer he said one you get the people to
[16:51] believe you and two this is up to you
[16:56] now that you will be sincere
[16:59] When you
[17:00] pray so the condition of his heart is to
[17:03] be
[17:05] sincere to be sincere is to be
[17:08] authentic to be
[17:10] genuine to be open no
[17:14] Fe to be
[17:16] honest to show what you really
[17:19] feel to be sincere means that you are
[17:22] free from
[17:24] pretense or
[17:26] deceit so this is a hard
[17:30] condition not church not joining church
[17:34] or going to church or going back home
[17:37] this is your own heart now now the
[17:39] parable we
[17:41] read note that the seed is the
[17:46] constant the atmosphere is variable
[17:50] Wayside Stony thorny
[17:53] good but the
[17:55] seed which is the word is Con
[18:01] Wayside atmosphere
[18:03] variable on the
[18:05] edge you're hearing more unbelievers
[18:07] than
[18:08] Believers you are hearing worldly stuff
[18:11] than word
[18:13] stuff the Stony atmosphere variable
[18:17] that's why I calling it hard
[18:20] attitudes no depth surface
[18:24] Christianity going to church is about
[18:26] enough nothing is Tak
[18:30] seriously the thy atmosphere
[18:34] varable love the cares love the
[18:37] responsibilities of Job and Family it
[18:39] brings excuses as to why you can't do
[18:42] this or that the cares of life keep you
[18:45] away from making time for
[18:49] God the good atmosphere
[18:52] variable living in God's
[18:55] Pavilion living in God's presence
[18:59] conscious of
[19:02] presence so friends
[19:04] tonight you create that atmosphere for
[19:08] prayer or the atmosphere for prayer have
[19:11] to be
[19:12] created remember he said if you get the
[19:15] people to believe you be sincere when
[19:18] you pray nothing will stand before your
[19:22] prayer so now I want to go to Mark 11
[19:25] from
[19:26] scripture and there after Jesus cursif
[19:29] vict tree verse 22 said Jesus answered
[19:31] said unto them have faith in
[19:33] G verse 23 for verily I say unto you
[19:38] that whosoever shall say unto this
[19:40] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[19:43] cast into the sea and th shall not doubt
[19:45] in his heart but shall believe that
[19:48] those things which he sayth shall come
[19:49] to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[19:52] seeth but this is the verse I want to
[19:54] get to verse
[19:56] 24 We Struck it before
[19:59] and I fa to bring it again tonight
[20:01] therefore I say unto you what things
[20:04] soever you
[20:06] desire When you
[20:08] pray believe that you receive them and
[20:12] you shall have them now in the light of
[20:15] talking about
[20:16] sincerity this particular verse carries
[20:20] a lot of weight because you cannot be
[20:22] hypocritical and believe that you're
[20:24] going to receive them you have to be
[20:27] sincere that the the prayer that you're
[20:29] going to offer to God will be received
[20:32] and verse 25 says when you stand praying
[20:35] forgive if you have ought against any so
[20:37] it's conditional that your father also
[20:41] which is in heaven May forgive you your
[20:43] trespasses so SE thir tonight if you
[20:45] have a ought or you know have a grudge
[20:47] or you have some issues with somebody
[20:49] you want to clear that out first you
[20:52] want to go ask God to help you to get
[20:54] rid of that that you could get that what
[20:57] he says here when you stand praying
[20:59] forgive in other words don't stand
[21:02] praying with hate don't stand praying
[21:04] with malice don't stand praying with
[21:07] heart issues that affect your knocking
[21:10] on God's door and if you do not forgive
[21:12] neither will your father which to
[21:15] forgive your trespasses that means you
[21:17] stand as a sinner and then God will not
[21:20] hear sinners unless you pray a sinner
[21:22] prayer okay so let's
[21:26] go so he referred to this under the
[21:29] ministry
[21:30] explain what's the order of the word you
[21:34] shall receive it you shall have it first
[21:39] you believe you got it then it will be
[21:43] given to you and when you come make your
[21:48] confession believe God believe that he
[21:52] will do it and he is under obligation to
[21:56] do it God is worth no more than his word
[22:00] is no man is worth any more than his
[22:03] word and God is infallible he cannot ly
[22:07] his word is true and we just accept him
[22:10] by his word and believe it and it's got
[22:14] to happen is it that simple but over yes
[22:18] it is that simple Jesus had all the fine
[22:22] qualities of God in him do you believe
[22:24] it he had powers upon powers and when he
[22:27] met Satan he never uses power he gave an
[22:31] example for the weakest of Christians
[22:33] when he met Satan he said it is written
[22:36] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[22:39] every word that proceed out of the mouth
[22:40] of God the weakest Christian can take
[22:46] that stand hold it sure God is the word
[22:51] now he said it is written why it is
[22:54] written it is written yeah it is and he
[22:57] quot the scripture whatsoever things you
[23:00] desire When you pray so you could
[23:02] actually say to God Lord this is what
[23:07] your word says whatsoever things you
[23:09] desire When you pray believe you receive
[23:12] them watch the order of the word believe
[23:15] now present tense you receive it and you
[23:19] shall have it it will be given to you
[23:22] later but believe it now and then he
[23:26] went into this before before you can get
[23:29] your crop you got to plant the seed
[23:33] water it believe it don't dig it up
[23:37] every morning to see every time you dig
[23:41] it up you'll delay it that much more it
[23:43] will never grow if you keep digging it
[23:46] up when you settle in your heart that
[23:50] God has healed you sister you little boy
[23:53] you brother any of you settle it in your
[23:56] heart and believe take go at his word
[24:00] and start testifying about it give it
[24:03] plenty of water fertilize it watch what
[24:06] take place the word of God will produce
[24:10] just exactly what it says an amen Amen
[24:13] to that so he said he cannot heal you
[24:16] until first you confess it and I want to
[24:18] bring back something that we had that we
[24:21] struck on Wednesday he said when you are
[24:24] converted to Christ almost done I love
[24:28] to Christ when you accumulate a faith in
[24:31] Christ like you would to your wife or to
[24:33] your husband you accumulate a faith and
[24:37] you walk in that fate so he's showing
[24:40] how love produces an accumulation of
[24:42] Fate now watch this if you can believe
[24:46] in the Lord Jesus not only for salvation
[24:48] for yourself or for your loved ones and
[24:50] you know if you desire something that
[24:52] wasn't right you wouldn't have faith
[24:53] enough to ask God in the first place
[24:55] because you know it ain't right if you
[24:57] are sinc
[24:59] and know that it is right and you ask
[25:02] God with a clean heart knowing it's no
[25:04] selfish object motive and your objective
[25:07] and motive exactly right then ask God
[25:10] like a child believe you get it and you
[25:12] get it I know that and this is the part
[25:15] I want to get here I have come to Christ
[25:18] and I guess about 20 years since 20
[25:19] years when 20 years old and I can
[25:22] sincerely see that I have never asked
[25:26] Christ sincerely for anything now that
[25:30] is really
[25:31] sincerely ask him anything that was for
[25:34] right but what he give it to me or told
[25:38] me why he couldn't do it and then later
[25:43] on I found out it was a good thing that
[25:47] I didn't get it so he's saying very
[25:49] plainly whatever he sincerely asked the
[25:52] Lord he got it and if he couldn't do it
[25:55] he will show him why he couldn't get it
[25:59] he said now
[26:00] remember when you believe on him and
[26:02] have faith in him and trust him yeah SP
[26:06] Saints don't try to show yourself to do
[26:10] it just stay with him don't the Lord now
[26:13] and reason it out so he's showing
[26:17] you a prayer approach and I want to
[26:20] share that with you
[26:22] tonight this is the example IDE like if
[26:25] I was coming to brother Welsh here to
[26:27] borrow a
[26:29] ,000 I guess I couldn't get it because
[26:33] he may not have it but if he had it and
[26:37] I could get it now and I come and try to
[26:40] lay the case down I come and say Welsh
[26:43] give me a
[26:44] thousand so watch the approach now that
[26:48] is no way to do it and that is no way to
[26:53] ask
[26:54] God I'll come up I will say to brother
[26:57] Welch could I speak to you a few minutes
[26:59] brother Welch sure brother BR go over to
[27:03] one side and sit down I say brother
[27:05] Welch the first thing I want to ask you
[27:08] do you have $1,000 that you could get a
[27:10] hold of for
[27:11] me well we are
[27:14] friends he'll be asking me or me him one
[27:17] of you Brethren it will be the
[27:18] same now that is what I want I lay down
[27:22] and show him I said brother Welch I'm
[27:25] over here in a meeting I'm absolutely up
[27:27] against it I've got to leave the town
[27:30] I'm $1,000 in debt I just got to have
