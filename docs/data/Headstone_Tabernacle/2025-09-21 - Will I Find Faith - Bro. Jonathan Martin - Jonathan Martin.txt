You may be seated for a few minutes. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord today? Amen. There's no place that we'd rather be. So on behalf of our pastor, we'd like to greet one and all on this wonderful day. Sort of a break of the routine. If you had asked me a month ago if we'd be here on a Saturday service like this, I would have told you we didn't have one. But God in his grace and his mercy already saw us here because he there's no accident with God. There's no mistake with God. There's nothing that surprises God. So in the back part of God's mind, this service already finished. &gt;&gt; This service you're already shouting and worshiping because God already know the end from the beginning. And we are happy for what God is doing in our midst. Amen. and certainly to welcome one and all all of the churches that are gathered here, the believers. We love you. We appreciate you. And we are happy that we could be together in fellowship by the grace of God. I want to acknowledge the ministers who are here with us tonight. Uh brother Norris Cummings, your app or precious, brother Norris. God bless you, brother Norris. Certainly wonderful to have you with us tonight. Brother Yadel, God bless you. Certainly wonderful to see you here. Glory. I see brother Uwell is here as well. God bless you, brother Uwell and your wife is here also. God bless you. We happy to have you here with us in fellowship. And we see brother Roland here as well. God bless you and your wife as well. How many appreciate the ministers? How many appreciate the specials? What anointed singing. Amen. and to see that the message of the hour is very much alive. And uh I don't want to take one more minute that is necessary to be behind the sacred desk tonight because I believe God has something special for us. And I had the privilege just about two weeks ago to be in a convention in Uganda and I had the honor to minister along with uh precious brother Jonathan Martin. And when as he was ministering there in the convention um I just knew that we had to have him here in Trinidad. &gt;&gt; Something just thundered when he was ministering and I said this brother needs to come to Trinidad. So uh I quickly put a phone call in. I say brother Oid I've heard something that really blessed me and I believe it's going to be a blessing and by the grace of God he is here with us in Trinidad for the very first time in Trinidad. for the very first time in the Caribbean. So, we want to give him a warm welcome to Trinidad and Tobago. And it's one thing that he says that is something that we connected on. He said, "Brother Isaac, I love this message." And I believe in Trinidad and Tobago, we have sons and daughters of God who love this message. This message is what we stand on. is the foundation of what we believe. We see it as the word of the living God for this hour. We know that in this message is rapturing faith. In this message is the power to change our bodies. In this message is food for the journey. It has brought us here and it will take us to where we need to go. We have confidence in the message and in the messenger who brought the message. The son of man veiled in a son of man. So I am privileged and honored to welcome to the platform precious brother Jonathan Martin from Ohio from True Word Tabernacle. I believe him to be a true servant of the Lord. And just before he comes there's just one quote that I want to read from a man running from the presence of the Lord and it was a prayer and this is my prayer and desire. This service is really dedicated to young people and brother Martin will be preaching uh tonight, tomorrow and tomorrow afternoon. But to said to to today is really special for the young people because we know the young people are under attack and a it's a different kind of attack. &gt;&gt; The enemy is doing everything he can do subtly, covertly, publicly this way to break faith, break confidence, break love. The wax for the love of many have just waxed cold. People are going through the motions and deep down there's still a thirst. There's still a desire for more. &gt;&gt; And I believe that we are among believers here and those who are connected online who are looking for more. Looking for a reality. As a preacher, I say I'm tired of church. I want a reality. I want the God of the Bible. I want the living present tense move of the spirit of heal what they felt to know that you know that nothing could move you. to him that overcometh will I will I will I make the stand firm in the temple of God and he shall go no more out that's the kind of faith we need because talk is not going to do it'll take the reality of the living God to anchor in your soul and do something for you so I just have one quote before he comes and it's from the message of man running from the presence of the Lord and may we have such a great meeting till there not be an unsaved person among us all the children will be in the kingdom of God those without the baptism of the spirit, may they receive it, Father. May all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age, Lord, be unveiled to us and we'll see the plainness of God so that we'll know how to behave ourselves and act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into discipline to the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching of the Lord Jesus. And that prayer from the prophet is my prayer today as well. And I'm under expectation for God to speak to us. It's not a man speaking, but God has men in this hour. And we are under great expectation. So as he come, let's stand to our feet one more time. And as we sing this song in your prayer, sons, that's where I'm from. In your prayer, peasants. Oh Lord my God come. Oh, in your presence, brother John [Music] touching your grace [Music] in the cliff of the cross. In your presence, oh Lord. Sing it again. in your presence. That's where I [Music] [Applause] Oh Lord my God, in your presence that's where I seeking your face. touching your grave [Music] in the cliff of the rock in your presence. Oh Lord, [Music] we're so appreciative of his presence. So glad that God has been manifest among us in this age. We serve a living resurrected savior. &gt;&gt; And the very answer that we need is found in the message of this hour. &gt;&gt; God has not left us alone &gt;&gt; because he's promised that that he's a very present help in the time of need. And we have found him faithful &gt;&gt; through every storm, through every obstacle, through through many great valleys and mountains that we've climbed and obstacles, everything. We have found that God is faithful &gt;&gt; and he's faithful to his word. &gt;&gt; He's faithful to his oath. &gt;&gt; And I believe that we're the seed of Abraham by the Holy Ghost. We are his royal seed. And the same vow, the same oath that he gave Abraham applies to his spiritual seed. And I believe that he's an unchangeable God. I believe his promises are true. I believe that God is here to make manifest every word, every promise, and bring a reality. And uh we just want to say that we uh just uh appreciate the invite and uh it's true. We've never been to this uh this part of the world before and uh you know there's one thing that I have found. It's hot. Uh it it is hot and uh and uh but you know uh we're just glad to be able to fellowship with God's people &gt;&gt; and uh I'm looking forward to uh spending eternity uh with God's children and uh I believe that this message is going to get us there. I I believe that God has given us the power that that we need and all we've got to do is just keep watering it and watering it with our faith, watering it with our praises. And uh you know, I I just uh appreciate the the invite and the opportunity to minister what I believe is the greatest message that has ever come upon this earth. And uh as our brother Isaac said, it is it is rapturing faith. And uh God has given us a faith to believe in his rapturing grace because it's not by our might and it's not by our power but it's by his spirit. It's by his grace upon our lives. And uh so I just want to uh just say God richly bless you. God bless brother oid. And uh we just uh appreciate the invite. And uh if you have your Bibles uh we'll turn to Luke the 18th chapter. We'll begin reading from verse one. And uh the Lord got a hold of my life when I was just a young boy. and it just begin to uh show me what this message was about when I was just a youth. And uh you know, I I had a lot of zeal back then. I can honestly say that I'm I'm still zealous about this message &gt;&gt; and uh I I I have dedicated my life to it. I believe that every Christian has dedicated their life to this message. And uh if you haven't uh then I will just say this, the message is Christ &gt;&gt; and and he is the man that we are following &gt;&gt; and he is leading us to our body change and but you've got to have a personal experience with Christ. &gt;&gt; You've got to know him and the power of his resurrection. your life has got to be changed and transformed and and uh we believe we just pray that that is exactly what can take place. If you've not had that real personal experience with him then by this service uh the the end of this service you can have your own experience with him and uh because God is a reality. So, Luke the 18th chapter beginning at verse one. And he spake a parable unto them at uh unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint, saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man. And there was a widow in that city, and she came unto him, saying, "Avenge me of mine adversary." And he would not for a while. But afterward he said within himself, "Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me." And the Lord said, uh, hear what the unjust judge saith, and shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth. Now, Hebrews the 6th chapter and verse 12, that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. Don't be slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. I would like to just take for a text. Will I find faith? Now, may God add his blessings to the reading of the word, you can have your seats. It's a very simple subject and yet it's a very uh powerful subject and a very powerful revelation and that is faith. And I I would like to just speak on it. It may be very simple to us, but I believe that God hides himself in simplicity and he and he reveals himself in the same. And I believe that God has given a special grace upon this age. I I as we're speaking uh specifically to young people tonight, uh God has given us a a real special grace to this generation. I I believe that we're living in an hour that God already knew what would take place upon the earth. He He knew he already prophesied, foretold that there would be gross darkness and much deception and and this lid of hell would be lifted uh off off in this age. But at the same time uh all of heaven would come down. So as all of hell is coming and pouring out upon the earth and we see that uh the the fourth dimension, the the the fifth dimension, hell has come through the the fourth dimension and has even come into our very dimensions that we live in uh space, time and matter. And we see the demonic forces of hell and the war that is raging all around us. But at the same time, the prophet would let us know that deity is not in heaven. Deity is upon the earth. And and then very specifically, he would say that deity is in you because you are the tabernacle, the the dwelling place, the temple of almighty God. And so there has been a special grace that has re moved upon the elect in this hour because this is an age that we must be stabilized. This is an age that all of the mysteries that that has been probed at through throughout the ages has now become a revelation unto us. Things that were unknown are now made known. And it's for one specific purpose, and that is to give a rapturing faith to to to to give us something to stabilize us to to put our feet upon a solid rock. And when the winds come and the storms begin to blow and and crash against amen against our lives, we're we're we're not just moving about with shifting sands, but we're stabilized. Amen. a generation that is not getting weaker and weaker with the knowledge that is being released upon this age. But this is a generation that knows God and and and and has an understanding of God and the power of God to to to stand there and withstand the evil forces of this age. Amen. I I believe that I'm speaking to a chosen generation. Amen. A royal priesthood. that that God has placed a call and ability within us to not just go into the outer courts and not just say, "Well, the sun is shining and thank God for the sh sun," but then the night begins to fall and and then we get discouraged and fearful and wondering and disillusioned and and it's even greater than just going into the holy place where where there is man-made light and seven candles and and the priest has got to keep the oil and got to keep the the light burning and and then we know that in the holy place it can still get smoked up. And but you see there's a greater calling than that there is beyond the veil into the holiest of holies where the shakina light of God. Amen. where there is mercy, there's blood upon the mercy seat, and there is grace and the favor of God. And and we find that's where life is. That's where fruit is. That's where you young people, your life for the glory of God. I tell you, there is a grace. There's a call. It's a holy calling. Amen. To go beyond just man-made religion. go beyond the traditions, go beyond just man-made leadership and go into the presence of almighty God. And I believe that this message is what prepared the way. It's dissolved all unbelief. It's taken the doom and the gloom out of our lives that we can come boldly into beyond the veil. not timid, not cowardly, not beggars, uh, but a generation that God has put a courage within your heart to come into divine presence and blossom. It's not just for the preacher. It's not just for the prophet, but it's for a chosen people, a called out people that God has called for his name's sake. Go beyond the creed. Go beyond the delusions. Go beyond just man-made ideas and go and find God for yourself. Find God in the power of his resurrection. And let and when you meet that God, he's going to give you a faith, a faith to be an overcomer, a faith to cast down every weapon that would come against you. Cast down imagination, cast down reasoning, cast down your senses, amen, that are always warning against you. You see, when the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord will raise a standard against him. You see, there's always a special anointing for the time and for the season to combat the Antichrist spirits and the teachings and the doctrines that are trying to trying to weaken your faith and and get you off of the path and get you away from the direction. Amen. You see, it's a Holy Ghost power to defeat that Antichrist spirit. Amen. You see the Holy Ghost, Amen, is what makes this word live because the word and the Holy Ghost are the same thing. Amen. So the Holy Ghost is what brings a power of revelation that'll defeat the devil in your life. It'll cast down discouragement. It'll cast down reasoning. It'll cast down disillusionment. It's an anointing, a man, that comes upon the elect. You see, down through the ages, there's been a a lion anointing and an ox anointing and a man anointing. But you see, the anointing that has been released for this day, it's a flying eagle. Amen. It's a prophetic anointing. You see, it's the it's the anointing to restore the children back to the original faith again of the fathers. It's an eagle age. You see, the other anointings were earthbound creatures, but this is a heavenly bird. This is a flying eagle. It's not just perch somewhere. It's flying. There's an anointing that has been released upon this generation. Amen. To put you into fight, to place you positionally in heavenly places. That's what the message came to you to do. To get you out of these earthbound atmospheres and to place you into the heavenlies that you could put your faith into action and call those things that be not as though they already are. I'm not talk &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about just mamas and and daddies and thank you. Amen. And the preachers. Amen. I'm talking about young people catching the vision. A fresh vision. It's not just 60 years ago. Amen. It's not just 20 years ago. But what are you going to do with this vision? Without the vision, the people perish. So God, send an eagle anointing to give you a word in season. Uh, amen. To get you into heavenly places, uh, that you can begin to soar. Soar in this rapturing faith, soar in this grace that says you never did it in the first place. Uh, you're the redeemed, the bloodbought, predestinated before the foundation of the world. to give you a faith to accept who you are, to accept the grace that's been released upon you, to know that you're sons and daughters of God. And you are not made for tribulation. You are made for the marriage supper of the lamb. You are made for the millennium. You see, it's an eagle age. Amen. And it's Revelations 10 1:7 where all the mysteries of God would be revealed. It's the eagle. You see, don't forget this church. I'm quoting the prophet in the fifth seal. Don't forget this church. I just want to remind you, don't forget this church. &gt;&gt; And you brethren on tape, I want you to examine this. How could men do anything else besides the power of God that had been released to them? &gt;&gt; Well, if it was true at the opening of the seals is the true right now. Amen. There is a power, an anointing upon our lives that is making us act a certain way. &gt;&gt; It's making us believe a certain way. &gt;&gt; It's making us to walk in a certain direction. I'm tired of the wilderness. I'm tired of someone saying, "Go this direction and and go that direction and you don't know who to believe." Uh, but God sent a prophet to point us in the right direction and say, "This is how you get out of this wilderness. This is how you get out of man-made denominations. This is how you get out of those denominational spirits of cold, lukewarm, dead religion. This is how you inherit the promises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what you're called to do. Inherit the promises. When inheritance is given to you, you don't have to beg for it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to gravel for it. It's yours by grace. It's inheritance. And as the royal seed of Abraham, we are possessors of all things. all things. And the idea that we've got to beg for it, the idea that we've got to we've got to crawl on our knees and and try to find some favor with God, that's the old order. This is a new order. It's the order of Melzdc. It's the order of the word himself. It's a ministry that is sprinkled blood upon your life, saying you never did it. You never sin in the first place. All you've got to do is accept it by grace. Believe the promise. Accept who you are. Accept the Holy Ghost. Accept your healing. Accept your deliverance. Hallelujah. You see, all the scriptures have been proved, vindicated. The presence of the Lord so made manifest in this hour. And it's for one purpose. To anoint our faith &gt;&gt; to let us know that God is here. &gt;&gt; Every sign, every vindication, &gt;&gt; every proof, &gt;&gt; whether it's in the heavens, whether it's on the earth, whether it's through a gift, whatever it is, God is trying to prove to you that there is a faith that's being released in this age. He's wanting to get to you that the pro that the time, the fulfillment of all things is now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, Jesus never asked, "Will I find a good person?" &gt;&gt; You listen to me, young people. &gt;&gt; He never asked, "Will I find someone that's righteous?" &gt;&gt; He never asked if he would find a good Christian. He never asked if he would find saints or respects or or or a good tithe payer. Amen. And I'm just going to inject this for myself. Amen. He never asked, "Will will I find someone that believes that God sent a prophet?" [Music] &gt;&gt; Being a good person is good. Being a righteous is a must. Being a good Christian is a must. Amen. All of these things and and believing God sent a profit. It's a must for this age. But what God is looking for is a faith &gt;&gt; to accept his finished work at Calvary. And when you accept that, it makes you righteous. It makes you holy. It makes you blameless. It gives you Holy Ghost courage. &gt;&gt; Will I find faith? &gt;&gt; Will I find someone that can take me at my word? Well, I should find somebody who will stand at my word and say every word's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not scared whether this one says so or that says so or nothing. I believe in God and I'm accepting it and standing right there on it. That's what he's looking for. &gt;&gt; Someone that'll take their stand upon thus sayeth the Lord. You see, Satan is after our faith. &gt;&gt; That's what he was after in the garden. &gt;&gt; Satan has every trick &gt;&gt; to discourage the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; He's got every scarecrow around this message. &gt;&gt; He's got enticing spirits to distract from the real. &gt;&gt; Amen. Enticing spirits. You got to do this and you got to do this and if you don't do this, Amen. then then you're not a Christian. You're not going to make the rapture. Amen. Enticing spirits. Amen. Centered around the message that if you don't do a certain thing, then it brings a discouragement. &gt;&gt; You see, it's enticing spirits just to keep you in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Get you so locked up in fear, doubt, spooks. &gt;&gt; You see, he's trying to paralyze your faith. Amen. Got faith but you it's paralyzed. &gt;&gt; And that is an example of Lot. &gt;&gt; He got paralyzed by Sodom. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew it was wrong &gt;&gt; but but his faith become paralyzed because he sympathized with it. &gt;&gt; Let me just say something young people. Don't sympathize with Leosa. Don't sympathize with cold, lukewarm, neodyia, blind, miserable, wretched spirits. Don't sympathize. Amen. With this direction, that direction. Stay with this message. Believe this message. It's Christ. It's the man Christ Jesus. He's the one who died and paid for your sins. He He died to take away your high breeding. Stay with Christ. It's Christ that is asking, "Will I find faith?" It's Christ that has been made manifest in the revealing of the son of man, saying, "Just believe me. Just accept who I am. Just accept my unchanging, vindicated revelation of who I am." [Applause] You see, when a man &gt;&gt; once catches that vision of the invisible God &gt;&gt; and know that he's always present. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's something about that. He's always present. &gt;&gt; Young people, if you can just catch the vision of the invisible God. You say, "Well, h how do I catch the image of the invisible God?" When you've seen his word made manifest, that is his presence being made known. &gt;&gt; And we have seen God vindicate his presence. We have seen this word become so material and manifest. Amen. We've seen the lame walk. We've seen the cancers healed. We've seen the blind see. We have seen drug addicts made whole. We have seen lukewarm Christians on fire. We have seen the manifestation of God's working among us, declaring his presence is here. &gt;&gt; And when a man catches that vision of the invisible God and know that he's always presence, there is something that stabilizes that man's thinking. &gt;&gt; It stabilizes his actions. And in the time of distress and trouble, it'll still make him look up upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the unseen yet by promise. &gt;&gt; You see, amen. Moses caught a vision of Christ and he forsook the world. Lot seen the world and it paralyzed his faith. But Moses caught a vision of Christ and he forsook the world and it anointed his faith and it put him into action &gt;&gt; and his faith paralyzed the world. &gt;&gt; And either your faith will paralyze glamour or either the glamour will paralyze your faith. &gt;&gt; You can't have it both ways. &gt;&gt; It's going to be one or the other. &gt;&gt; You've got to make your choice. Now, I I'm just going to say it like the prophet of God said it. Amen. That God has already made his choice. &gt;&gt; But it's your time to make your choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see that deep calling unto the deep, that thirst that is within your soul, and you're longing for reality, you're thirsting for a living God. I tell you what it is. It's God that has already fornew you. And he already knew that you were predestinated to life. So he's knocking on your heart's door. And he's saying, "Whosoever would open their heart, I will come in and I will shut with them and I'll break the bread of life." I tell you friends, you can run. You can try to hide. You can try to drown out that voice. But there is something about God. He knew you before the foundation of the world. And he chose you into Christ. And he's never going to give up on you. He's never going to let you go. I'm thankful for that kind of a grace. A grace that is a keeping. A grace that you can go so far in sin and stooped in sin and yet the hand of God will reach down there and he'll pick you up and he'll bring you out of the miry clay and set you up on a rock. This is not like any other age. This is a grace where he has swore by himself that he'll not lose one. &gt;&gt; He'll not lose one. And I tell you young people, he's not going to lose you. He's going to keep you, preserve you. He's going to fill you. He's going to rapture you. &gt;&gt; But you got to catch the vision. You got to see it for yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, Hebrews the 11th chapter &gt;&gt; verses 1 and 2 says, "Now faith is the substance &gt;&gt; of things hoped for." &gt;&gt; The evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; For by it the elders obtained a good report, &gt;&gt; and by this faith the worlds were framed. You see, Isaiah would ask a very good question. To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? &gt;&gt; And who will believe the report? &gt;&gt; Who will believe the report? &gt;&gt; And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? And you see the prophet of God in the opening of the seals would say if you believe the word, the arm, the strength of the Lord will be revealed. &gt;&gt; Believe the report and the power of God will be released to your life to make manifest what he promised. So the importance of your faith and accepting what God has done for you in this hour, believe it &gt;&gt; and it'll release an anointing upon your life. &gt;&gt; Now that's what the elders, &gt;&gt; you see, it's saying for by it the elders obtained a good report. But you see, there was a group of elders that refused to go on into the land, &gt;&gt; and they produced scarecrows. &gt;&gt; They produced a whole bunch of lukewarm spirits. &gt;&gt; They produced a whole bunch of question marks on the message. &gt;&gt; You see, and the people got their eyes off of a vindicated word that said, "It's your land." &gt;&gt; Got their eyes off of the evidence. It's a good land. You see, the prophet of God says we're living off of the evidence &gt;&gt; of that other world. &gt;&gt; It's the son of man. &gt;&gt; The word made manifest is the evidence of what is in the unseen realm. &gt;&gt; Healing is yours. Deliverance is yours. Joy is yours. &gt;&gt; And the word made manifest has declared what is in the unseen realm. But you accept it by faith. You see, they &gt;&gt; they they they talked two million people &gt;&gt; into staying in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; But there come another group of elders. &gt;&gt; There come another generation. &gt;&gt; There come a Joshua generation. There come a a believer that that was identified with that Joshua anointing &gt;&gt; that said, "I'm more than able to possess that land." &gt;&gt; And they begin to tell that generation that was coming up. &gt;&gt; It's for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They begin to go to that five and sixyear-old, that sevenyear-old, and say, "Honey, it's for you. &gt;&gt; This word is for you. This message came for you. &gt;&gt; You're a chosen daughter. You're a chosen son. Begin to take that 10year-old and say, "Honey, you got to realize who you are. You're a predestinated son. God loves you with an everlasting love. He's never going to lose you. He's ne he's going to always watch over you. Begin to take growing them up, raising them up in the fear of the Lord." And the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord. to fear the word, to fear the report, to fear what God has given us in this age and say, "Oh God, I don't want to be contrary to this word. I don't want to sidestep this revelation, but I want to believe it. I want to come under it. I want to say, "Yes, it's my property. Yes, it's my possession. Yes, it's my inheritance." I say, "You've been hearing it. You've been hearing it. You've been hearing it, but now it's time to possess it. &gt;&gt; Now it's time to put your faith in action. &gt;&gt; Now it's time to quit looking at mama. Quit looking at daddy. Quit looking at the preachers and realize that you're a chosen generation. That you're the Joshua generation. That you have been called to go into the holies of holies and entertain the presence of Almighty God and go in there as a possessor, a conqueror. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, all things are possible if you believe. &gt;&gt; And without faith, it is impossible to please God. &gt;&gt; With faith, all things are possible. Without faith, it is impossible to please God. So Enoch, your type, &gt;&gt; had a testimony &gt;&gt; that he pleased God &gt;&gt; because he possessed the land. &gt;&gt; He walked it out. He walked with God &gt;&gt; from justification, sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then he began to get caught up, &gt;&gt; the quickening power, &gt;&gt; becoming so real in his heart and his life. And he's just walking with God. &gt;&gt; He just wakes up on Monday walking with God. He wakes up on Tuesday walking with God. He wakes up on Wednesday walking with God. But all of a sudden, there was something, a gravitation, a pull that was catching him. Come up higher. Come up high. There's an open door. Come up higher. And El just another day. Just another time going to work. Just another time coming to church. just another time going through another trial, another situation, another valley, another mountain you're trying to climb, just another day. But all the sudden, &gt;&gt; Enoch was not for God took him &gt;&gt; because all things are possible if you believe it. And that's the testimony that a that Enoch left us &gt;&gt; that he pleased God. &gt;&gt; He was in such harmony with word the word of God. &gt;&gt; That he knew how to walk. &gt;&gt; He knew what pleased God. &gt;&gt; And that was just simply Lord I believe you. &gt;&gt; Lord I believe your word. &gt;&gt; Coming in line, coming in contact, &gt;&gt; getting in direct contact with that word and saying &gt;&gt; that's me. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my promise. &gt;&gt; That's my inheritance. [Music] &gt;&gt; You see, it's faith &gt;&gt; that unlocks the promises of God to us. &gt;&gt; And God has to have believers. &gt;&gt; He can't work through make believers. &gt;&gt; He can't just work through some random person. &gt;&gt; He's got to have believers. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, in order to have believers to meet the challenge of the age, he had to predestinate believers. &gt;&gt; You see, I I I I know the devil's been trying to tell you that that that you're just going to fall away. And &gt;&gt; don't even know it's if it's for you. &gt;&gt; But I just want to say what a prophet said about you. &gt;&gt; He predestinated believers. [Applause] You see, when he predestinated in Malachi 4, it's got to happen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You see, when Jesus was saying, when the son of man comes, will he find faith? &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 had already been written. &gt;&gt; Jesus was not looking at that, you know, in ignorance and, well, I really don't know. Oh, I don't know if there's going to be an elect. I don't I don't know if anyone can believe the age is going to be so dark and but he already looked back to the scripture and he knew that Malachi 4:5 and 6 was for that last generation when he was saying, "Will I find that kind of a faith?" He knew it was already predestinated that there would be an elect with a special grace upon your life to believe the word. &gt;&gt; But you see, let me just put it like this. You are sealed up. &gt;&gt; You are still a part of the mystery. &gt;&gt; Your name was still sealed up. But it was at the time that the son of man is going to be revealed &gt;&gt; that the lamb steps forth that he had been in the eternities. John didn't even see but he stepped from the eternities. He had been interceding upon the ignorance of the people through seven church ages. But now the day of ignorance is over because the lamb is coming to take the book. The people that the devil has been beating up and telling you. See, you can't believe it's not for you. You can just fall away. Now, the revelation is being made long. Now, he's being bringing you out of the ignorance. &gt;&gt; And he's bringing you to an understanding, &gt;&gt; a revelation of who you are. That when the lamb takes the book, the word is now revealed and your name is a part of the revelation. And it begins to speak that you are an overcomer. You are my bride. You are the one that I've chosen to defeat Satan in his old Eden. &gt;&gt; The age of ignorance is over. &gt;&gt; Because the word has been revealed. &gt;&gt; So he predestinated &gt;&gt; in Malachi 4. It's got to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he come over and predestinates anything to happen in his word, he had to prove his word to be so. &gt;&gt; When he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen, he knows that seed will be there just at that time. He predestinated a bride. She's going to be there. Going to be a rapture. She's going to be there. He predestinates it by his fornowledge. There's nothing going to stop it. The religious, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, they they tried to stop him &gt;&gt; because he come as the God prophet. &gt;&gt; He come as the revealing of the son of man in his first coming. &gt;&gt; Son of man is a prophet. &gt;&gt; And so he's coming and he's and he's taking the word and he's saying, "This day, this scripture is fulfilled." Do they love him for it? No. They tried to throw him over a heel. &gt;&gt; They wanted him out of their churches. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what is repeated in this last day. The son of man has come, the word, and they've hated the word. &gt;&gt; And Christ has been kicked out of the churches because they don't want that kind of a presence in their midst. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, but then he said, I have needs to go by Samaria. I believe that he has needs to come by &gt;&gt; Headstone Tabernacle &gt;&gt; this afternoon. &gt;&gt; You see, he wasn't just going aimlessly, half-hazardly &gt;&gt; because he knew that there was some place that there was a predestinated seat &gt;&gt; that he would fight faith. [Applause] She couldn't go with the rest of the women &gt;&gt; because she was a prostitute. &gt;&gt; What was it? Six husbands and the one she was living with wasn't her husband. &gt;&gt; But there goes Jesus. &gt;&gt; The disciples go into town to get some food. And Jesus stays behind because he's got an appointment. because God by his fornowledge knew that there was going to be some faith &gt;&gt; and he wanted to have a believer &gt;&gt; to anoint him with that faith. &gt;&gt; He wanted to hear someone say, "You're the Messiah." &gt;&gt; He was tired of hearing be elab. &gt;&gt; He was tired of hearing, "Get out of our midst. Get up out of our church. Get out of our circle." &gt;&gt; He was ready to find some faith. I'm feeling good. &gt;&gt; He was ready to make his journey. &gt;&gt; He couldn't find it down there in the city. &gt;&gt; He was unwelcome in the city, &gt;&gt; but he had to come at a certain time. &gt;&gt; It was a predestinated hour. No one else wanted the woman, but Jesus wanted to come in contact with that woman. She had to come out of the camp. She had to be just be considered an outcast. But when Jesus came, he didn't see a prostitute. He saw faith. I tell you young people, it's not popular standing on this message. It's not popular to say this day, this scripture is fulfilled. We're not looking for Messiah. Messiah is here now. It's the promise of his word. But he's looking for someone to anoint him with faith and make this Messiah live. [Music] He lived in the days of William Brandham. &gt;&gt; He lived in the days of the revealing. &gt;&gt; But now it's your turn. &gt;&gt; Now it's your turn &gt;&gt; to suffer without the gate. &gt;&gt; To suffer without the camp, &gt;&gt; to suffer the reproach of standing for this message. Now it's your time to say you're Messiah. You're the living, anointed, vindicated Christ. And anoint him with your faith and say, "I know you're my healer. I know you'll fill me with the Holy Ghost. I know you'll change my life." the old scripture mixed with the old scripture, the old prophecy of what Messiah would be. And the present tense experience that Jesus was giving that woman, it made the Messiah to her. I tell you friends, the old scripture, I will restore, saith the Lord. The old scripture, Elias shall come and restore the faith. The old scripture, so shall it be at the revealing of the son of man. The old scripture mixed with the experience that God has given us that he's a living reality. It brings Messiah among us. &gt;&gt; It brings him out of the word. &gt;&gt; He begins to walk the aisles. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a real Messiah. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of impersonations of Messiah, but we've got a real Messiah. &gt;&gt; We got a Messiah that knows your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we we got a Messiah that knows your name. &gt;&gt; We got a Messiah that can change situations. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's a real Messiah. He hears your prayer. &gt;&gt; It's not just a man preaching. But the prophet of God pointed us to a real Messiah, &gt;&gt; a real vindicated message that still deserves the thoughts and intents of the heart. &gt;&gt; I may know not I may not know what's in your heart, but this word does. &gt;&gt; Your pastor may not know what's in your heart, but this word does. And this word is not a dead letter. This word is logos. &gt;&gt; This word is a pillar of fire. And the pillar of fire accompanies the message jo. And the pillar of fire is what is convicting your heart. The pillar of fire is what say, "Hey, all you've got to do is believe me. All you've got to do is accept my grace. I'll be a living God to you. I'll change your life. I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost. I'll give you the grace to inherit all things. &gt;&gt; I'll walk with you. I'll be God in your skin. Hallelujah. It's a real Messiah. &gt;&gt; You see, every promise is laying right here in this Bible. &gt;&gt; And it's just as good as the day he spoke it. &gt;&gt; But it takes faith to ignite it. &gt;&gt; Some of you hunters may know what I'm talking about, &gt;&gt; but if you've got a rifle, you've got a shell, &gt;&gt; that bullet has the power. It's got the It's got the powder within it. &gt;&gt; It's got the bullet. &gt;&gt; It It It It's got the primer in it. &gt;&gt; But you still got to squeeze the trigger. &gt;&gt; You got to put it in the chamber. &gt;&gt; You got to point it at the right direction. &gt;&gt; That is thus sayeth the Lord. The direction, &gt;&gt; the prophet, the messenger, the vindication of his word is the direction. Not three gods, one God. Not a dead tradition, a living reality. Not a hope so religion, a no so revelation, the power of God in your life. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now you got to have faith. Don't hesitate. You put that devil right in your right right in your crosshairs. You put pornography right in your crosshairs. You put all unbelief right in your crosshairs. You put sickness right in your crosshairs. You put this tormenting spirit right in your crosshairs. You take those spirits that say you're going to the tribulation, put them in your crosshairs. And now you got to have the faith to pull the trigger and say, "Satan, I'm through with you. I'm through with your lies. I'm through with your torment. I'm through with Leosa. [Music] Put your faith in action. &gt;&gt; Ignite it. &gt;&gt; Make this word lit. &gt;&gt; Ignite it with faith. &gt;&gt; Change your confession. He's the high priest of your confession. &gt;&gt; Change your confession. Change it upon the basis of it's written. It is written, I am his righteousness. It is written, I am pure, virtuous, sinless. &gt;&gt; It is written, I am not man-handled, &gt;&gt; but I am the virgin. &gt;&gt; I am a virgin of his word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's time to put away the scars. &gt;&gt; It's time to put away the past. &gt;&gt; It's time to put away the regrets. What's keeping you from pulling the trigger? Put it in the black. Put in the sea of forgetfulness. Get back to the message. Get back to believing for all things. Get back to claiming your children. Get back to believing the promises for you and your children. Get back to it. The simplicity of saying, "God, I believe it's for me. When you say that, &gt;&gt; you've got a high priest that is interceding upon your confession. &gt;&gt; But if you won't confess it, &gt;&gt; then he can't intercede. &gt;&gt; Because he's the high priest of your confession. &gt;&gt; He's already put the word here. &gt;&gt; He's already vindicated it. &gt;&gt; He's already shown you that he's here. He's already proved his presence is among us to vindicate this word again and again and again and again because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; But you've got to believe it and confess it and stand upon it. &gt;&gt; And then he is making good before the father and saying, "I died for him. I died for his victory. I died that he can have the Holy Ghost." [Applause] You see, faith comes by the word. &gt;&gt; Faith comes by hearing &gt;&gt; hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God would say that this is the word age. &gt;&gt; He would actually say it's his age. We've had we've had a lot of ages, &gt;&gt; but this is his age. &gt;&gt; This this is when we've moved beyond the carrier stages. &gt;&gt; We've went beyond just an emotion and a sensation. &gt;&gt; We've we've we've went beyond. We believe in all that. We believe in the shouting. We believe in the rejoicing. We we believe that there's stimulation of revelation, but our experience moves beyond that. Because when you don't feel like shouting, &gt;&gt; the word is still here. [Music] &gt;&gt; When you're not on top of the mountain &gt;&gt; and you're down in the valley, he's still here. The lily of the valley. &gt;&gt; When you wake up some days and you don't feel like you're a Christian and you don't feel like you've got the Holy Ghost and you don't feel like you're going to make the rapture, he's still the word. Come out of camps. &gt;&gt; Come out of the ages. &gt;&gt; Come into the reality &gt;&gt; that he's here. &gt;&gt; His word is here. And &gt;&gt; his word is what we're feeding on. &gt;&gt; It's giving us faith. &gt;&gt; When not when not everything's going right, we still got faith. &gt;&gt; When things are happening and our children are wandering off, we still got faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young people, when it looks like the revival has left your home, you've still got faith &gt;&gt; because your revival is not dependent upon mom and dad. It's not dependent upon your pastor. It's not depending upon it's depending upon your faith. &gt;&gt; It's depending upon the revelation of who Christ is and who you are in Christ. &gt;&gt; You're going to have good days. You're going to have bad days. You're going to feel like you're about to make the rapture. Then you're going to feel like, "Oh, God, I don't know if I'm going to make it." &gt;&gt; But it doesn't change &gt;&gt; anything because you've got a revelation. &gt;&gt; And the revelation is what anchors you. &gt;&gt; So God knew that you would be in the worst of all the ages. [Music] &gt;&gt; So he said, "I'm going to restore the faith &gt;&gt; that was once delivered to the saints. And that faith was given by the word himself. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Peter that gave us the faith. It wasn't Paul that gave us the faith. &gt;&gt; It was the revealing of the son of man that gave us the faith. &gt;&gt; For in the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; And this is the faith &gt;&gt; that the church was built upon. And this is the faith that has been revealed in the last days &gt;&gt; that in between the son of god dispensation through the seven church ages and the son of David dispensation there's another turning of the corner &gt;&gt; and that is when the son of man himself is revealed again to restore his faith &gt;&gt; not a man faith not a tradition faith Not a denominational faith, &gt;&gt; not a Baptist faith, &gt;&gt; Presbyterian faith, Pentecostal faith, and not a message faith. &gt;&gt; This is the Son of Man himself. Will I find faith? When the Son of Man comes, when I come, will I find faith? He's looking for a certain kind of a faith. A mountain moving faith. A supernatural faith. A faith that can speak the word. A faith that knows that as long as you're speaking what this mighty angel has given us is thus sayeth the Lord. You can say I'm healed without any evidence and say I am healed by his stripes. My children is going to be saved by the finished work of Calvary. It's because you've been restored back to his faith. Before there's one evidence, before there's one grain of sand moving, the mountain is already moving. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a creative faith. &gt;&gt; We look so much and praise God for it. Amen. The prophet of God would say that this is this is this faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. that can speak swirls into existence. &gt;&gt; And there was no squirrels. &gt;&gt; He said when Joshua said, "Son, stand still," &gt;&gt; he said the sun was there. &gt;&gt; But when I said, "Let there be a squirrel." There wasn't a squirrel. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then the prophet of God says, "We are creators." &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, we do not need, we don't need swirls. [Music] If we all sat around saying, "Let there be a squirrel. Let there be a squirrel. Let there be a squirrel." What's the good for a swirl? We don't have faith for a squirrel. &gt;&gt; But I tell you what we need, what we have faith for. We have the faith for an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Because it takes atmosphere for the supernatural God to be made manifest. If you want healing, create an atmosphere. You want the Holy Ghost, create an atmosphere. You want a rapture create an atmosphere. We are creators because we believe not just for swirls. We believe for all things. We believe for our body change. We believe for our children. We believe for the the millennium to come. We believe from deliverance from all things. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; An atmosphere. an atmosphere that can read the word and just say, "Lord, I believe it." &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out. Don't try to explain it. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Lord, I believe it." &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm I'm I'm going through some great trials." I'll tell you why you're going through through some great trials. Because God has put you in this age to prove to Satan that you are not like Eve. &gt;&gt; Eve got confused on one promise trying to reason with the devil. And that one promise was Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. She can see where he was. He was God yesterday. The promise was true yesterday. But to believe it for today and for tomorrow, she couldn't do it. But there's a bride upon the earth &gt;&gt; that is placed here in the worst of all the ages &gt;&gt; to prove to Satan, you are not a hybrid. &gt;&gt; You're not a hot bed plant. &gt;&gt; You are not someone that is being shifted around with every wind of doctrine. Your feet are stable upon the rock of ages plant for me. Let me hide myself in. You are drinking from the water from the rock. Your strength of revelation is in your soul and you're standing there saying, "I will believe every word. I believe it." Whether I feel like it or not, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Whether I feel saved or not, I believe I am. &gt;&gt; Whether I feel like the millennium's forming or not, I believe it is. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's the faith. the faith. We're contending &gt;&gt; for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints &gt;&gt; by Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; The saints is the called out ones. &gt;&gt; Separated from all unbelief. And the son of man, Jesus Christ, is revealed in this age to restore that same kind of faith. &gt;&gt; A super faith, &gt;&gt; a super race, &gt;&gt; my word shall bring forth of its kind, a super race, &gt;&gt; justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost. But now back to the grain. My word shall bring forth of its kind. &gt;&gt; That word seed will not return into God void. &gt;&gt; That word will not return unto God and say, "Well, we tried. &gt;&gt; We tried, &gt;&gt; but we're not going to have a harvest. &gt;&gt; We tried, but there is no sons of God ripening to a perfect faith. We tried, but the father says, "I'm looking for that kind of a faith that my word will not return to me void. For when I send the word forth out of my mouth, it goes as a seed. And I predestinated a bride in the last days that has washed her garments from all the impurities of unbelief." And she will put her shoulders back and stand there with one foot on land, one foot on sea. every power under her feet and say, "Satan, you're under me. Satan, you have no place in my life. You have no place in my confession. You have no authority in my life." &gt;&gt; Standing there shoulders back saying, "I am a possessor. &gt;&gt; I stand upon this word. &gt;&gt; I am him. [Applause] You got to have that kind of a faith &gt;&gt; to be able to say when you see me. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Got to look at that mirror of the word &gt;&gt; because you're not seeing yourself after the flesh. you're seeing by revelation, what you're hiding, &gt;&gt; watch your tabernacling. &gt;&gt; And you're looking at that word and you're put looking in there and you you see your faults. You see your mistakes. You see everything. But you're standing there with a revelation and saying, "But I am him. &gt;&gt; I am his righteousness. I am his holiness. &gt;&gt; I am his perfection. That's the faith. &gt;&gt; That we are contending for in this last days. &gt;&gt; Do I have a little bit more time? &gt;&gt; I don't even know what time I've been got up here. &gt;&gt; There's thousands of voices &gt;&gt; vying for influence over us. We're in an age of influencers. &gt;&gt; Influencers everywhere. &gt;&gt; Someone can wake up and &gt;&gt; go get a bowl of cereal and &gt;&gt; turn on their &gt;&gt; whatever. &gt;&gt; Don't even know what thing's called. &gt;&gt; Begin to and begin to eat your bowl of cereal if you want to and try to influence thousands that &gt;&gt; this is what you need to do. That's right. &gt;&gt; You say that's silly. And yet people's doing it. &gt;&gt; Young people, it's your generation. &gt;&gt; The thousands are trying to influence your life. &gt;&gt; Political voices trying to influence you. &gt;&gt; Religious voices trying to influence you. Yes. &gt;&gt; Carnal voices. Your own flesh and humanity trying to influence you. &gt;&gt; So much confusion on what's truth that this age said that there would be gross darkness &gt;&gt; would cover the earth &gt;&gt; to anoint us with unbelief. You see, it's it's these voices that deadens the voice of the supernatural. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; That God can be speaking &gt;&gt; and you won't even hear it. &gt;&gt; But you see, the prophet of God says end time message should meet end time conditions. &gt;&gt; Where they got off, the message ought to bring it back. Always end time message meets end time conditions. A call back to the original word. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet of God would say that it was uninspired leadership. &gt;&gt; That when Jesus came, the word incarnate Elohim, &gt;&gt; incarnate in flesh, &gt;&gt; uninspired leadership is the one that was blinding the eyes of the people &gt;&gt; from seeing him. &gt;&gt; If you believe that, you're going to be in a cult. If you believe that, you're going to be crazy. If you believe that, you're you're you're you're going to be a holy roller. &gt;&gt; You're going to be a Jesusite. &gt;&gt; You see, uninspired leadership, leading the people into all kinds of traditions &gt;&gt; and turning the traditions into the into the doctrines of man and making the word of God of none effect. That's right. and all the while saying they believe the scripture. &gt;&gt; And the whole time they're pointing the people to history &gt;&gt; and then saying, "Someday it's coming. Someday Messiah is coming." And all the time reading what Moses said that the Lord thy God shall raise up a prophet like unto me. And everyone knew it was going to be the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Everyone knew. Every religious leader knew the Messiah was going to be born in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; And yet here comes some wise men following the direction of the pillar of fire, that star. &gt;&gt; And they could say, "Yeah, it's supposed to be born in Bethlehem, but we can't believe it." &gt;&gt; And instead of going to worship him, they tried to kill him. &gt;&gt; That just by chance, it really truly is the king. We want to kill its influence. &gt;&gt; Uninspired leadership. &gt;&gt; Killing the influence of the word. &gt;&gt; Uninspired leadership. Always pointing backwards and always pointing in the future, but cannot stand there and voice the words of a vindicated prophet. This day, this scripture is fulfilled. uninspired leadership instead of leading the people to say what a prophet says that she is him. &gt;&gt; I didn't say it. &gt;&gt; The prophet said it. &gt;&gt; The word that God sent to this generation said this bride is him. &gt;&gt; This bride is the final voice to the final age under her messenger. In the sermon leadership, I believe the last sermon outside of communion, brother Brennham preached, he would again bring up the young man that come to Jesus and said, "What must I do to have eternal life?" And &gt;&gt; we we know the story, but we find out that Jesus told him, "Go sell all that you have and follow me." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's inspired leadership. Amen. &gt;&gt; Take up your cross, young people. &gt;&gt; Take up the reproach &gt;&gt; of what God has vindicated &gt;&gt; to be his grace in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; What God has proven when he has healed the sick and he's raised the dead and he delivered the oppressed and he's brought jubilee and he's turned our mourning into joy and he's taken our ashes and turned it into beauty. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And when we can see all around us judgment is upon this earth, gross darkness upon this earth. And yet God has given us his light. But all Jesus is saying, "Come follow me." &gt;&gt; You see, I I'll lead you to eternal life. &gt;&gt; I And as you're following him, he's leading you not to just another stage, but he's leading you, changing you from glory to glory &gt;&gt; until you're his image. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's not your righteousness. It's his righteousness. &gt;&gt; It's not your holiness. He's led you to a faith to realize it's his holiness. &gt;&gt; You're still going to make mistakes. You're going to make mistakes as long as you're in this human body. But there's something about a faith &gt;&gt; that can realize you are made perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ. a faith that it can accept that kind of a grace &gt;&gt; because friends, it's only going to be by his grace that we make the rapture. &gt;&gt; You see, you got to you got to follow him. What does it mean to take up your cross and follow him? Well, you got to follow him outside the camp of just religious limitations. &gt;&gt; Limitations. You can only go so far. You can only believe so much. &gt;&gt; Well, you can't believe that's for you. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe so in the future. The bride's revival is coming in the future. &gt;&gt; But to be able to take the scripture and believe that it's for this day and right now in the present tense and say this is my generation. &gt;&gt; I've been ordained for this time. &gt;&gt; Always putting limitations. But you see the prophet of God says the limitations are taken off with God &gt;&gt; because we have moved from one power to a greater power to a greater power. &gt;&gt; Just as man went from science went from horse and buggy to an automobile which is just only you know one p one horse to 20 horses. &gt;&gt; And then it went from that to a an an airplane &gt;&gt; which was just greater horsepower. But then it went to an astronaut age. &gt;&gt; It's just Holy Ghost upon Holy Ghost upon Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's just word upon word upon word upon words. &gt;&gt; But now we've got unlimited power. &gt;&gt; Not just to make it to the moon, &gt;&gt; but to make it to the supernatural realms &gt;&gt; of that heavenly dimension &gt;&gt; where there's angels where his presence is, &gt;&gt; where the supernatural is made manifest, &gt;&gt; a power pushing us. &gt;&gt; We can't be satisfied with lay out a sea of lukewarmness. But this message is the flame of the hour and it's the flame of my heart and we're desiring the power of the Holy Ghost to move among us. &gt;&gt; Young people, we've got to have the Holy Ghost. We've we've moved beyond just a stage. &gt;&gt; We move beyond just going to church. &gt;&gt; We move beyond just just going through the traditions of the message. &gt;&gt; But we moved into the realms of unlimited power &gt;&gt; to believe for all things. We've been restored back to the supernatural &gt;&gt; where God can change habits and God can take things over your life that the devil's been holding you captive and it can be God in the moment. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's where we're at. &gt;&gt; Unlimited. &gt;&gt; Believe for all things. &gt;&gt; Don't put a limit on it. &gt;&gt; The rapture could take place. Amen. We're not saying it's days away. It could take place right now. It could take place in the morning. &gt;&gt; We can be changed in a moment of the twinkling of an eye. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The way that this world is going. No longer is just we listening to a message. The world is falling apart. Everyone knows the world's falling apart. &gt;&gt; Whether they believe the message or not, &gt;&gt; they know that this world is doomed. Amen. &gt;&gt; People don't like to hear it, but I I dare to say that we're already in third in in World War II. &gt;&gt; Things are moving. &gt;&gt; But that's not fear trying to bring us to God. &gt;&gt; You don't bring people to the kingdom of God through fear. &gt;&gt; But I'm saying that to anoint your faith &gt;&gt; that God sent a prophet to warn us. that we are living in the time that the ancient of days &gt;&gt; has been made manifest. &gt;&gt; Daniel saw him and said, "It's the ancient of days." &gt;&gt; John saw him and said that he has white hair. But when the prophet of God saw him, &gt;&gt; he said, "I'll tell you who that ancient of days is. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you who John saw." It's like the judges &gt;&gt; that when they would sit upon there in the old time in the England and I think maybe they still do it. I don't I don't know. But but but when they were sitting on that that seat to represent their authority, they would take a white wig and put it on them and and it was symbolizing the authority they had as a judge. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God told us who it was. But then he began to tell us that there's a there's a there's a second climax to my ministry. &gt;&gt; There's something that's about to take place. &gt;&gt; These others has just been preparation. &gt;&gt; It's been preparing your hearts to let you know that God is here. God's doing something. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You begin to tell us what's it all about, sir. What time is it? &gt;&gt; Begin to tell us, is this what it is? The Is this the those seven thunders? Is is this the mystery of the seven seals? What what is it? &gt;&gt; But then God told him, you go to Tucson? &gt;&gt; He didn't know exactly what it was about. But for one time, he thought it was going to be the end of his life. But then he found out it was the furtherance of his ministry. He was the third pull. &gt;&gt; And there he was there in Sabino Canyon. He's got his hands up and he's praising God. He's just praying and all the sudden something struck his hand and he's looking at it. It's so real. And he's he's looking at it. He's said, "My, that's so beautiful." &gt;&gt; He said, "I remember the kings used to have something like this." And he said, "I've always been kind of afraid of it, but all of a sudden the voice spoke and said, "It's the king sword." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would tell us in the seventh seal that he was the third pole. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The opening of the word &gt;&gt; and he would tell us that's what those consolation of angels was about. &gt;&gt; Seven angels &gt;&gt; that he told us it's coming. &gt;&gt; But then he would tell us and what's this? What's the attraction of the mountain? He would say it was prophecy. Now it's fulfillment. [Applause] &gt;&gt; What was it all about? The prophet of God would say, "A man says,"Those seven angels was the third pole of my ministry coming back to unveil, unfold the mysteries of the entire Bible." &gt;&gt; It was God speaking. &gt;&gt; It was God saying, "Time is no more." The judge standing forth, Christ standing with the with the open book, one for the land, one for the sea, declaring time is no more. &gt;&gt; I tell you what that means. What this message means for you and I. Time is no more. &gt;&gt; Time for those denominational system is no more. &gt;&gt; Time for cold creeds is no more. &gt;&gt; Cold for lukewarmness is no more. &gt;&gt; Cold. Amen. The time to be bound in sin and trespasses is no more. &gt;&gt; The time to wonder if you're going to make the rapture, no more. &gt;&gt; The time to just be a beggar and wandering around with a low self-esteem and a low confession. No more. &gt;&gt; But now is bride time. &gt;&gt; Now is the bride age. Now is the time to see who you are and say, "That's me." &gt;&gt; Stand upon the promises of God. &gt;&gt; I'm getting somewhere. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet of God &gt;&gt; would say, "Now, we've been looking at it the wrong way." He would say everyone looking at the clouds &gt;&gt; trying to figure out the angels and was it is it this one or is it that one? And &gt;&gt; but then the Lord, the angel came to brother Brandham and said, "You've got to turn it to the right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You're looking at it wrong. You got to look at it right." He thought, "Well, I thought I was looking at it right." He said, "No, you got to turn it to the right." And when he turned it, &gt;&gt; there was what Daniel saw as the ancient of days. &gt;&gt; There was what John saw as the revealing of the son of man, the judge. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And now the prophet is looking at that picture and saying, "I'll tell you who that is. It's my Lord up there." [Applause] Now, it brings us to our scripture reading. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because there's a widow woman, she's not under a husband. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Her headship has died. &gt;&gt; But she's got a need. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And she's going before a judge. &gt;&gt; But this judge is unrighteous. He's unholy. He's He's unjust. He doesn't fear God. &gt;&gt; But she because she's got a need &gt;&gt; begins to knock. And the judge is already in bed. &gt;&gt; He don't want to get up. He don't want to get out of bed. &gt;&gt; It's night time. But that woman keeps knocking. &gt;&gt; She's got a need. She knows that it's the judge that can help her. &gt;&gt; She's not running from the judge. She's not scared of the judge. She understands that the only one that can help her in her situation is someone with that kind of authority. &gt;&gt; It's more than a preacher. It's more than just a Pharisee. It's more than just a Sadducee. It's more than just a good man. It's going to take someone with authority. So she keeps knocking &gt;&gt; and the judge says, "Unless she weary me, &gt;&gt; I've got to get up. &gt;&gt; I don't want to, but I've got to get up. I don't fear man, and I don't fear God, but I fear that woman. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I fear her persistence. &gt;&gt; I fear that she's not going to give up. &gt;&gt; I fear that she's going to stay here all night if she has to. I fear that she understands my authority and my position and she's going to re and she's going to stay there until I release to her what she has need of. &gt;&gt; So she he opens the door and gives her her petition. Now fast forward because Jesus said, "Will I find that kind of faith?" &gt;&gt; Will I come when the son of man is revealed? Will I find that kind of faith? &gt;&gt; Will I find a little bride that is no longer under the headship of denominations? Will I find a little bride that has died out to hurt all the other authorities? Will I find a bride that will realize that I'm her answer? I'm supreme authority. I am the judge. I can give mercy. I can give healing. I can give deliverance. I can grant to her her petition. Will I find that kind of a faith that that little bride is persistent? &gt;&gt; Persistent means tenacious. You promised it. &gt;&gt; We're not standing before an unjust judge. We're standing before a righteous, holy God who said, "If you'll ask it, I'll give it to you. If you seek for it, I'll let you find it. I will not withhold any good thing from you." Young people, you're promised the Holy Ghost. You're promised you if you'll ask for it, he'll fill you. He promised that you he would give you faith. Not to just make it from Monday to Tuesday, from Sunday to Monday, but he's going to give you a faith that'll rapture you out of here. &gt;&gt; We're not scared of the judge. &gt;&gt; Judgment has already been pronounced. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "I don't pray for America anymore." She's already lo She's already in judgment. She's missed her day of visitation. &gt;&gt; But I've got a predestinated bride. &gt;&gt; I have predestinated believers. &gt;&gt; And it's 2025. And I promise I'll never leave her. I'll never forsake her, but I'll grant to her her petition. Ask that your joy may be filled. Ask that you can receive the promises that I said you can have. [Applause] You see, that's why the pillar of fire accompanies the message always. &gt;&gt; It's because it's the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; that companies the word &gt;&gt; to make it manifest. &gt;&gt; Not a dead letter, not a tradition, &gt;&gt; but something that's got life. &gt;&gt; What is the pillar of fire doing? Looking for believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. the prophet of God after the seven seals. Remember, I I'm closing. Oh, you forgive me. I probably been really long-winded. &gt;&gt; I just want to show you something. &gt;&gt; Remember after the seals and brother Brandham is in Albuquerque and he's preaching God hiding himself in simplicity in Albuquerque, New Mexico. And at the end of that service, he's talking about seeing the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And there's believers that are searching for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham just begins to say, "Now surrender." &gt;&gt; You see, remember, Brother Brandham preached, I believe it was three services, what is the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; what is it given for, and how to receive it. &gt;&gt; But he didn't record how to receive it. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; But God in his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the way in 1963 in Albuquerque, brother Brandham or God allows a recording where the prophet of God just begins to say, "Now just surrender. &gt;&gt; Just surrender." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm looking right at it. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at the pillar of fire. I'm looking at the Holy Ghost. He's searching for someone that he can feel. I see it. Just surrender. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just sir, what is he doing? He's teaching you how to receive it. You don't have to beg. &gt;&gt; You don't have to repent and so much and say, "I don't know if I'm worthy." No. Repent. &gt;&gt; Get it under the blood. &gt;&gt; But then say, "Oh, God, you promised it. &gt;&gt; God, I surrender my life to you. You promised me the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and the same pillar of fire that the prophet said, I'm looking right at it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he would tell Deus Shakarian and say, "Come here. Come here, brother Deus." Say, "Right there. Right there. Right." See, it's going to it. He He says, "It's right over that lady." And you can hear on the tape scream. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; What is he showing? It's your promise. &gt;&gt; You've got a right to this. &gt;&gt; But it's not how much you're good enough to earn it. It's not how holy you are. It's not how righteous you are. It's not how much money you burn. It's it's not how much tithe you give. It's the faith that you've got &gt;&gt; to realize that there's a deep calling into the deep and there's a thirst for it. And if there's a thirst, then that means it's for you. &gt;&gt; It's the same for healing. It's the same for deliverance. It's the same for anything that you would have need of. All you got to do is open your heart and say, "Lord, I surrender." Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, you got to say it like this. I I don't have the quote in front of me, but I believe the prophet of God said it like this. Said, you've got to be like that little widow woman and say, "Lord, I'm on your hands. &gt;&gt; I'm not giving up. &gt;&gt; I'm not turning away." &gt;&gt; You know what persistence means? &gt;&gt; Tenacious. &gt;&gt; Tenacious. In other words, stubborn. &gt;&gt; In other words, I ain't going anywhere. &gt;&gt; I need it and you promised it. &gt;&gt; And it mean and that means it's mine. &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, I'm going to stay right here &gt;&gt; and I'm going to begin to quote your own word and say, "It's your promise. &gt;&gt; It's your promise, &gt;&gt; Lord. Fill my cup, &gt;&gt; Lord. Change my life." as the musicians just begin to play that. &gt;&gt; Y'all know that song, I need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord, &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; Oh, I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. I lift my hands. I bow my knees. I worship at your throne. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. Could you just bow your heads? Just close your eyes. Would there be any young person that would begin to just from their heart say, "I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now." This is between you and God right now. &gt;&gt; Not you and the pastor, not you and mom and dad, not you and your friend, &gt;&gt; but you're the individual. It's not to a group. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a personal revelation. Yes, sir. of Jesus Christ to your life. [Music] Is there something is there a longing something in you that would begin to say, "Lord, I need you." Maybe no one knows about the situation that you're going through. No one knows maybe what's happening on the internet, but I just want you to know that there's plenty of blood. There's plenty of grace. There's plenty of mercy. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All it takes is an honest heart. Say, "Lord, fill me. Oh Lord, change me." Young people, you're not the generation of tomorrow. You're the generation of today. I know a lot of times we've said, "You're the generation of tomorrow." But I I I think that we should maybe change it and say you're the generation of today. I'm I'm looking at prayer warriors. I I'm looking at overcomers. I I'm looking at men and young men and young ladies that has the power to take the sword within your hand of faith and cut out every divine promise of God because it's for you. Oh, I need you, Lord.
