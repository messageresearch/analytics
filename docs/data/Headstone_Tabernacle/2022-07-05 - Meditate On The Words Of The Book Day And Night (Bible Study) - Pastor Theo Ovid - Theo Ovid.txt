room the bible study and i trust them that um you get excited about this this bible this book called the bible and why we study the bible why we study the word what it means to us what it does for us and tonight i have something upon my heart that i'd like to share with you and i trust that will be a blessing to you so we want to go straight into the word and if you have your bibles i'd like to return to the second timothy 3 um keep your bibles nearby you because we're going to run into a couple of scriptures as well tonight second timothy 3 16 in joshua 1 8 and the 2nd timothy 3 16 says all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness joshua chapter 1 8 is a familiar scripture it says this book of the lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but those shall meditate during the night that damian's observed to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make that way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success let me read that chapter part again this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate during day and night the dao means observe to do so this book will release the knowledge and i want to use it with accurate knowledge tonight as part of this knowledge based upon what is written dearing and you shall make your way prosperous and you will have good success so this is the uh platform in which we're going to base what we're going to share tonight and i'll have a title meditate on the words of the book day and night meditate on the words of the book dear night i trust this be a special bible study to you that it will inspire you by the scriptures by what has been shared by the thoughts of god that has been expressed by the word we wanted to know bible jeremiah 36 and i discovered this this chapter 36 a very interesting story and i want you to pay close attention i know sometimes we don't get put much into the old testament characters in this way but i want you to look at jeremiah 36 you want to read from verse 1. okay so god bless you jeremiah 36 one and it came to pass in the fortier of joachim the son of josiah king of judah that the word came unto jeremiah from the lord's seeing so this is jeremiah get an instruction from god take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the words that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah and against all the nations from the day i speak unto thee from the day of josiah even to this day it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which i purpose to do unto them so let's just go back again go should take a book a rule of the book i begin to write write the words and the words that i'm seeing and to use against israel it's against judah it's against all the nations and god is saying that when the host of judah will hear all the evil i purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way so god is saying i want you to put this judgment call in written form and get it spoken to these people and his objective the objective of god is for these people to return every man from his evil way that i may forgive their iniquity and their sin so it is not that god would just want to judge for judging sake god is even presenting a word a written word in order that they will repent in order that they will turn around let's go to verse 4. then jeremiah called barack the son of niraya and barak wrote from the mount of jeremiah all the words of the lord so barack would have been like described the writer right which he had spoken unto him upon a rule of a book and jeremiah commanded barak saying i am shut up i cannot go into the house of the lord therefore for six go down and read in the role which thou has written from my mouth the words of the lord in the ears of the people in the lord's hopes upon the fasting day and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all judah that come out of the cities nobody we know amos 3 7 surely the lord god will do nothing but reveal the secrets and distribute the prophets so here it is god have to speak to the people this channel is the prophet the prophet at that time was jeremiah jeremiah got the word of the lord he got barak to write all what he had to say from god and he himself under a commandment of god he said i'm shut up i kind of go in the house but you go and read this to the people so therefore it verse it may be they will present their supplication before the lord and will return everyone from his evil way for great is the anger and the fury that the lord has pronounced against his people we see it and barak the son of nirah did according to all the jeremiah the prophet commanded him reading in the book the words of the lord in the lord's house and it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of jose king of judah in the ninth month that they proclaim a fast before the lord to all the people in jerusalem and to all the people that came from the cities of judah unto jerusalem then read barack in the book the words of jeremiah in the house of the lord in the chamber of jeremiah the son of shaphan described in the higher court at the entry of the new gate of the lord's house in the ears of all the people when maita the son of jamar the son of chapan had heard out of the book all the words of the lord then he went down to the king's house onto the scribe's chamber although all the princes sat there even elijah described the liar the son of shimaya he will undertand the son of akbar and jimariah the son of shafan and zedika the son of hannah and all the princes then my child declared unto them all the words that he had heard then barack read the book in the ears of the people therefore all the princes sent judea jehudi the son of nathaniel the son of shillinia the son of kushi and the barak saying take in thy hand the unto them they said unto him sit down now read it in our ears so barak read it in their ears now it came to pass when they had heard all the words they were afraid about one and another other ascensible we will surely tell the king of all these words they asked barack saying tell us now how does though write all these words at his mouth then barack answered them he pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth and i wrote them with ink in the book then said the princess and the barack go high d darwin jeremiah let no man know where he be and they went in under the king onto the court they laid up the rule in the chamber of illasama described and told all the words in the ears of the king so the king sent dehudi to fetch the rule he took it out of elisha the scribe's chamber and jihoody read it in the ears of the king so the king gets it both ways hear it first from somebody and then out to the rule and then get it spoken to him and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king now the king sat in the winter house in the night month and there was a fire on the hood burning before him and it came to pass that when jihudi had read three or four leaves he cut it with a pen knife and cast it into the fire that was on the earth until all the rule was consumed in the fire that was in the head yet they were not afraid nor read the garments neither the king nor any of his servants that heard all these words nevertheless el nathan and eliae and jamal had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the rule but he would not hear him but the king commanded gerard neal the son of hamales and syria the son of azrael and shalinia the son of abdil to take barack described and jammed a prophet but the lord hid them then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah after the king had burned the rule and the words which barack wrote at the motor drama are saying take thee again this is god speaking another role right in it so that scroll or that rule that was written was burned by the king god telling jeremiah take another rule write in it all the the former words which were in the first rule which joha joachim the king of judah burned and those shall say to king king of judah thus faith the lord there was burnt this rule saying why has thou written therein seeing the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land and shall cause to cease from dense man and beast therefore thus saith the lord of jeopard king of judah he shall have none to sit upon the tune of david and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost and i will punish him and his seed and his servants for the iniquity i will bring upon them upon the inhabitants of jerusalem upon the men of judah all the evil that i have pronounced against them but they had not then took jeremiah another role give it to barack described the son of nira who wrote therein from the mount of jeremiah all the words of the book were joking king of judah burning the fire and they were added besides them many like words may god bless this word what are inspired reading tonight from the scripture and to show you the power that all scripture is given by inspiration and these men these men of god wasn't figuring out things and reasoning they were genuinely motivated inspired and directed by god and all the books and all the words and all the mysteries that god wanted that is in the book is in the book god could take care of his own words could we give the lord a shout on that god could cover from the end to the beginning there is not one punctuation there is not one comma there is not one full step that is all the order god knows every punctuation every line it is perfectly in order and god knows every punctuation and every line of your life prayer is the name of the lord so he could direct and he could guide and you could see how he could really make all things to work together for your good according to romans 8 48 all blessed be the name of the lord so i want you to see this book and these words look at something dead this is not like a novel you put down no one again and you take a read and you know you read something no this book is a life it's the word of god look at jesus in luke 4. look for and verse 16 this is jesus now this is new testament he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went on the sabbath on the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read so jesus is going and get this scroll this book and it was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaac and when he had opened the book he found the place where it is whether it was written now friends if you don't know the word if you don't meditate on the word if you don't go into the word how could you find the place where it is written jesus found the place where it is written scripture he was quoting isaac 61 the spirit of the law is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel of the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted the pre-deliverance of the captives to recover in his fight after the blind that set up liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord he closed the book he gave it against the minister sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this d is this scripture fulfilled in your ears i want to challenge you tonight not you know like the bible says the word of the lord is sharper than to its sword i've got scripture written don't let it ever make you feel the word is about tonight don't let it ever make you feel the word have no value the word doesn't carry the strength the word has value the scripture has strength notice is no problem reading the article in facebook there's no problem reading an article a newspaper there's no problem reading and listening to some inspired speaker or some inspired lecturer or whatever it is but it seems there's a problem reading the word there's a problem going to the bible maybe it might look stale maybe it doesn't look like it's old-fashioned me i don't know but it seems like the devil himself trying to ensure and you know when you think about it when the bible was the book had i know the bible become an app to me it even more i wouldn't say difficult even though they have it on their phone if if the effort if how should i say it uh barramundi may pray in a habit if it doesn't come into a discipline and i had it then you could miss it so i saw brother had this phone and it had an alarm and the lamp went on i said what is it about he said that is reminding him to read the scripture i thought it was so good right that was to remind him for scripture reading something so i guess maybe he has to go to a scripture i find that is very very great because with this technology and so on it could get you away from turning the pages reading the words of the book getting your daily word yourself that you could find your scripture find your word a word from the lord so i want to encourage you you have to read your word mention your word and don't limit what that word can do for you descript yourself now first thessalonians 2. and this is paul speaking and paul very sincerely was shane himself and his approach um paul wasn't arrogant paul went to his own stuff that made him what he was and he said for yourselves veteran knew our entrance in unto you that he was not in vain but even after that we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated as you know at philippi we were bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel with much contention for our exaltation was not of deceit nor of uncleanness no in guy this is beautiful so he said we didn't exhort all your with deceit or on penis but but as we were allowed of god here we go to be put in trust with the gospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but god we tried our hearts and neither at any time use we flattering words as you know no a cloak of covetousness god is a witness nor of men sought we glory neither of you not yet of others which we might have been burdensome as the apostles of christ but we were gentle among you and hear this comparison even as a nurse cherished our children then paul switches here be so being affectionately desirous of you we were willing to have imparted unto you not the gospel only but also our own souls because you were dear unto us but ye brethren remember brethren our labor and travial for laboring knight and b and paul they had selling and they were doing their own business and so on because verse 9 we would not be chargeable unto any of you we preach unto you the gospel of god we are witnesses and god also how holy and justly and unbelievably we believe ourselves among you that believe as you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father that his children that you should walk worthy of god what calls you into his kingdom and glory and this is the verse i want to get for this cause also thank me god without ceasing because when you receive the word of god which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectively work it also in you that believe this verse here is a powerful verse paul is seeing he's thanking god we don't see sin because of how these people received the word from them the word that came out of their mouth he said you didn't receive it as a word of men all right so and so i said no you receive it in truth the word of god which here we go which effective effectually wicked also in you that believe so what this tells you the word cannot effectively work in people that do not believe paul went on to say first convergence and okay so this is the amplified all right okay let's continue here right this is our chapter two verse one this is so we continue and i brethren when i came onto you came not with excellency of speech or wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god i determine not to know anything among you save jesus christ and i'm crucified i was with you in weakness and in fear in much trembling and my speech does that sound like um uh this manner speak your word and you know carry on no no that doesn't sound like that right paul i was with you in weakness and fear and much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power reason was fine give the reason that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god so he's saying if the preaching switches to wisdom to knowledge then the fate of the people will be in the wisdom of men but he said my preaching is not in that my preaching is with the demonstration of spirit and power what that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect that will perfect this mature yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to north but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew had they known it they would have not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written i had not seen or they have heard neither have it entered in the heart of man the things which god had prepared for them that love him but god had revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit switches all things he the deep things of god for what man what the things of a man see the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of god know it no man but the spirit of god and here's what i want to get to now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us by god which things we speak or note what he's saying after this allah back up a bit right he is saying god released us by his spirit right he's saying that the things of man is known by the spirit of man right then he says the things of god is known by the spirit of god and then he went on to say we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit is of god that we might know the things that are feeling enough of god no watch he's saying here in our way things we speak watch the words now not in the words which man's wisdom teacher but which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual so he's identifying that the words are let's say this way spirit spoken words or spirit given words that comes from the holy ghost what he is also saying and not seeing is that words can be spoken that is not spirit given or not spirit released and that is why brother branham could say say what the tapes say see he could say it's dear everything is there on the tape so when you get from the tape or the message the word because he came to reveal the word itself is the revealed word you get in spirit given words words that was given to him to speak he said which thing also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teach it but which the holy ghost teacher oh my so then those that believe or let's say this way receive and believe inwardly and willingly you find an effective working in their life hebrews 4 2 explains and shared with us that israel all who heard the word for unto us was the gospel preached as well unto them comparison but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so even though everybody hears the gospel or the word or the message or malachi 4 teachings or whatever it is not everybody has this effective working in their lives because it's not being mixed with feet to them not hearing so this same gospel could become a debt trap almost without faith because unbelief will screw up things and method things that's why jesus took the people out of the room and only want believers around him those with faith because of much unbelief he couldn't do much miracles because of unbelief okay for under us was the gospel preached as well unto them oh this is scary this is scary because people could be hearing and not hearing seeing i'm not seeing this is scary hebrews 4 if we go down to verse 12 and 13 and this is a key part tonight for the word of god this is the bible word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than retweet sword piercing even to dividing the son of soul and spirit of joint and marrow and is a designer of the torch and intents of the heart so even as we read the word as someone said the word is reading us oh my do you get that tonight how in here how can you see that tonight that as you study the word the word itself reads you so if you're not in order and you start to read the word about getting your heart right get yourself in order that word begin to bring conviction on you because that word is given from the mount of the prophets so now you can understand the depth what jesus told the devil man channeled by bread alone and jesus is hungry man charlie my bread alone and jesus was fasting 40 days man shout out alone and jesus could turn stone into bread but every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god or give the lord some praise in life man shall live by these words that are written in the book and when you understand that god's manual or god's instructions or god's law or god's plan for your life is wrap up in this book it's not wrap up in some university lecturer is that wrap up in a prime minister or government or something like that or your mother or father your purpose the purpose of your life is wrap up in this book so you have to have a burden a if that is so then then it has to be the enemy that is keeping me away from this book it has to be the enemy that making me feel like if this book is is not not what it's supposed to be but i just heard a word for hebrews 4 12 this book is sharp this word is sharp it is powerful it is a life in other words this bible is a living word it is god in print or give the lord some praise tonight this is god's truth it is sharp it is alive it is the sun it is the word of god do you believe that tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord so watch and um neither are there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do now when he amplified it says this here for the word of god speaks is a life and full of power making it active operative energizing and effective it is sharper than any two-edged sword penetrating to the dividing line of the breath of life soul and the immortal spirit as i say that you know some people in the head go on cuckoo when i say coconut nuts but they they kind of fight and they under depression and then they go to a psychiatrist or psychologist or whatever it is and they set them in a chair and they let them talk and they talk it out and they feel better they talk about the problem they talk like situation and then of course they pay their money and they get a receipt and so on they signed and all the person almost there to do is to listen to your talk talk it out and whatnot no the word of god is better than all them people all them sort of head shrinkers or psychiatrists and whatnot because this this could discern between the bone and the mouth the soul is spirit to see what's going on on the inside of you and could bring a deliverance so it is energizing is effective the word penetrating to the dividing line of the breath of the life soul and the immortal spirit of the joints and marrow of the deepest parts of our nature exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purpose of the heart or give the lord some praises and we go to ephesians 4 familiar scripture 11-16 and we know it but let's look at it again he gives some apostles some prophets some evangelists from pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints woke up the ministry they defined the body of christ till we all come into the unity of the faith one not of the son of god to perfect man tree unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ purpose verse 14 of that that we henceforth be no more children first one through carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slayer of men and calling craftiness but by the lying way to deceive so paul is saying men who wearing ministry clothing okay and they understand they are have an anointing to lie and wait to deceive not this fight for ministry here now he said this purpose of coming to this maturity is to escape these guys but who's fifth 15 says but speaking the truth in love not speaking lovely the truth speak in the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fit to join together and compact it by that which every joint is applied according to the effectual working in the measure of every part see that it would effectually come there again make an increase of the body or the eddy find yourself in love now the amplified verse 13 says his intention this wealth was the perfection and the fully cryptin of the things his consecrated people that they should do the work of ministering towards building up christ's body's church it was fitting that it might develop until we attain oneness in the fate and in comprehension of the full and accurate knowledge of the son of god that's the power i want to get on the line there accurate knowledge that we might arrive at really mature manhood the completeness of personality which is nothing less than the standard height of christ's own perfection the measure of the structure of the fullness of christ and the completeness found in him so we may no longer be like children tossed like ships to and fro between trans gusts of teaching and wavering with every changing wind of doctrine the prey of cunning and cleverness of unscrupulous men gamblers engaged in every shifting form of trickery in inventing errors to mislead but here is another part of respectfully rather let our lives lovingly express truth in all things speaking truly dealing truly living truly and fold it in love let us grow up in every way in all things into him whose head even christ oh my isn't that wonderful tonight so just think about it for because of him the whole body the church in all his various parts closely joined and firmly knit together by the joints and the ligaments which is supply when each part with power adapted to its need is working properly in all its functions grows to full maturity building itself up in love i just love that tonight it shows that this is not like you know your order can occupy chicken three parts three pieces or two pieces with fries and they get it almost instant this is not this is building up this is growing this is like a child and a child a baby and then six months and then two years and then the child walk talk and they try to add in knowledge and understanding and child growth from babies to young child to young man to maturity this is god's church upon this rock i will build it doesn't say instant i will build layer upon layer line up online block up and block we trying to get things fast we try to get it now we try to understand everything now he said you know in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with so therefore you could see god himself is interested in his growth process now adam didn't have that adam had let there be and adam was in god's image and like this and that imagined and righteousness fell when he got in flesh okay he fell when he got into flesh no this is the part i want to get to know in that um the mind is the travel to the heart that is why we have to hear the word that is why we have to meditate on the world and i want you to see this tonight there is one thing attached on it going to catch this the mind gets the word you hear the word and then the heart is where you almost regret it and you meditate and you think on these things and then this word has to be reflected in and through our bodies this is so important if you see this tonight you see something really powerful so it doesn't end upon a confession or profession it doesn't end on what you believe it really comes to fruition when it start to have an effect where it's expressed in the natural give the lord some praises i'm saying to you that this gospel cannot be something we talk about and just express and just speak it has to be something that begins to ooze out of our very being in other words this word has to become flesh in your flesh in my flesh this is god's plan this is god's objective this is god's motive as god was in christ reveal himself through christ christ coming to us revealing himself through us to the world so when peter got this power out of him to tell the man rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ and then tell the man it's not by our righteousness or holiness this might have been all but by faith in jesus christ he was expressing god to the world and the only way we can express god to the world correctly is not just by hanging out a book or giving another tape or something somebody you're teaching but to let that word be manifested in us through us by us could we give good lord a shout this this takes you all to church all together this is not just member thing church members like confessions they like to know what they believe and they're going to turn through the passages and so on they're not church thing now this is back to eating business this is actually trying to get you into a position where you see yourself as a son and daughter of god not a church member belonging to some group or to some organization but you are son of god who is actually fighting your way back upstream back into your place back into a position that you have to be a success for god that you have to do something that will glorify god failures doesn't glorify god defeat doesn't glorify god depression doesn't glorify god you in the dumps doesn't glorify god you're struggling that doesn't work like god it doesn't know if god does not gratified but god would be glorified in your success could we email somebody that i told joshua merited on the word can you feel like no they are night they have good success in other words the word give you the powerful thought insight into my mind and upon the word that you are drawn from from the words in the book i could release my spirit to bring back things i remember i could use my spirit to bring back point reference in my word to you that will activate a bigger faith in you because faith doesn't only come by hearing the word as the prophet said faith also come by experience so these things are written oh glory to god hallelujah these things are written for all examples to whom the end of the will have come so we have both positive and negative the positive things to draw us into faith to god the negative thing to see the effect of disobedience rebellion and plain evil and wickedness and the effect of those things because we have come to a spot where the decisions we make have fruits we consequences and actions sometimes seen and unseen known and unknown and this is where we are at so let's continue i trust tonight this is helping you in some way god and have this with me on display in and through our body through the channel of your mind and spirit and soul in receiving the word the word the full accurate knowledge of god coming down to our mind with the meditation of the word in our heart right now i have this written tender until it be done he says coming into presence so much so that it shows in our flesh just think god on display in and through our flesh display to the world this is more than a confessional profession this is more than i believe this or believe that this word will become flesh in your flesh in my flesh okay let's see if we could hold anything now first corinthians 6 15 i want to find the scripture first corinthians 6 we want to look at verse 15 to 20. it says this know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of a hallett god forbid what know you not that he which is joined on harlot is one body for the two states he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit free fornication every sin that a man do it is without the body but he that commit fornication sinners against his own body what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and you are not your own for you are bought with a price and it doesn't want to get to you know therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods so honor god and bring glory to him in your body but you know i didn't realize i didn't see that i have to glorify god in my body yes because what you are what you are receiving by way of the word by his thoughts that would come into you by you meditating but you are hearing read the words after the book and you have to hear the words in the book that's supposed to actually work an effective way till the strike and hit your body first corinthians 10 31 is a great scripture and all young people should get this scripture and make it on this particular one first corinthians 10 31 and share it with the other young people friends when therefore you eat or drink whatsoever you do do all to the glory of god the amplified so then whether you drink or eat whatever you may do do all for the unknown glory of god so if it cannot be done for the honor and glory of god then what don't do it don't do it isaiah 43 interested in scripture verse 5 isaiah 43 fear not i am with thee i will bring thy seat from the east and gather thee from the west i resisted to not give up until the salt keep my back to bring my sons from fire by doctors from the ends of the earth even everyone that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him i have made him what creatures for for his glory for the brown or if people could only realize that's why i come to this morning and ask you to remember me as i go overseas and all things pray someone come the other day and said brother branham do you think it is wrong to do a certain thing i said why do you question why do you question an about if there's a question in your mind leave it alone don't do it at all just stay with that when you start to do anything if it's a question whether it is right or wrong stay away from it don't go into it at all then you know you're right now all things ought to be considered prayerfully so that's why i said if it's not going to work for the glory of god don't do it all things will be considered pressly first seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these other things shall be added and this is what i want to get to i am positive sure this morning listen to this one if men and women could only get into a position to weigh their soul their thinking their attitude will be perfect in the sight of god that would be one of the most powerful teachers ever existed oh my you hear that i am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position so what if everybody inside this room tonight begins to receive this word as god just the scriptures believe this is what god wants you to hear this is what god wants you to know and you hear brother branham says that if people can get their attitude and their soul and their mind it will be one the most powerful church don't you want to ask god lord get me in that order give me a right attitude give me a healthy attitude you know attitude that pleases god then your you you know god could freshly anoint you and bring you into the place you want you to be let me just wrap up here the home stretch first peter 1 22-23 peter speaketh seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfake love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart certainly purify your souls in obeying the truth purify your souls and obeying the truth so the truth comes for you to not only hear he told joshua meditate on the word day and night that you're able to do all that is written so the meditation of the word or you getting into the scriptures you know my wife tell me something she was listening to she said you don't want to be hearing and not applying that is great because you are hearing stuff and if you hear stuff it sounds good i like it before but that is not the purpose of it you know it's not the sweet and remote part it's very going to be effective sweeten him up is part of this book where you enjoy hearing you enjoy taste and you enjoy participating you enjoy seeing even in glory but you have to digest it it has to go down you have to act upon it you know i mean like i said angela coming to sweep your house to get your house stripped so clean you have to clean that you have to get empowerment your car is god's turning around and joining us i need a cleaner to be no no you have to get empowerment and you have to take up the broom and you have to do this sweeping yourself you can ask god for strength to get the cleaning done all right so watch brother brown let's give the scriptures first peter 22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit under fake love of veteran that you love one another with a pure heart favoritely being born again not of corruptable seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which live it and bite it forever so the born again or the holy ghost experienced or the new birth does not disconnect you from the word it's not just a spirit thing the only spirit and you don't care what does it say no this bird is by the incorruptible seed of the word this bird is the word turn into the spirit because you said my words are spirit and my life so i'm showing you that you cannot bypass the word you're almost through you belong tonight romans nine if you have the bible switch to romans nine you wanna go for verse twenty two this is a beautiful scripture just love it who's trying to tell you to i'll be your go down for a minister what if god willing to show his wrath and make his power known endured with much long suffering the vessels of rat fitted to destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had before prepared unto glory even us whom he had called not of the jews only but also the gentiles so paul is saying this this glory this vessels of mercy it's not just jews only but also the gentiles he went on to quote scripture in verse 25 as he said in oc i will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved verse 26 it shall come to pass that in that place when it was said unto them you are not like people there shall they be called the children of the living god is also cried considering israel though though the number of the children israel be as the son of the sea a remnant shall be saved for he would finish the work and cut his shot in righteousness because a short work will the lord make upon the earth and so isaiah said before for note how paul is locked in to quoting the scripture from exams as a basis for presenting this revelation and as i said before except the lord has fabot has left us a seed we have been as sodom as we may like unto gomorrah what shall we say then that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness over hallelujah even the righteousness which is of faith so paul bringing out this great revelation here that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith but israel which follow after the law of righteousness had not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore because they sorted not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for this stumbled at this tumbling stone for it is written and paul lay in scripture again he's going he quotes in psalms 18 as written behold i lean inside a stumbling block a stumbling stone a rock of offense whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed continuing to romans 10 he continues brethren my heart is zion prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved for i bear them record that they have a zeal of bored but not according to knowledge so you mean you can have zeal but don't have the accurate knowledge to back up that's to you have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of god's righteousness are going about to establish your own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believes it for moses describes the righteousness of the law that the man which do it these things shall live by them but the righteousness here we go witches of faith speaks on this wise see nothing like that who shall ascend to heaven that is to bring christ from from above or who shall ascend to the deep that is to bring christ up again from the dead but what see at it here we go saints the word is 90 where is it even in thy mouth where is it in thy heart that is the word of faith that we preach that thou shalt confess with my mouth the lord jesus shall believe in thine heart that god has risen from the dead though shall be saved for what saith the scripture who am i for if i shall confess right for okay and we are for god raising from the dead and thou shalt be saved for what for with the heart man delivers unto righteousness but with the mouth confession is made under salvation for the scripture said whoever believes in him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between jew and greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all them that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved here we go then how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without that preacher and how shall they preach without being sent are just written or beautiful at the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things so that's reversed the whole day sent preacher to preach that they might hear the word that they might believe that they could call upon him so then fate come by hearing but for okay for they have not all obeyed the gospel for isaiah said lord who i believe or report so then faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of god could you give god some praise speak up my hearing and hearing by the word of the lord so the more you listen to the word hear the word study the word measured in the word is the more faithfulness begin to grow and take a hole in your heart in your life and in your mind that is why the prophetic sort is to try to read the bible and pray every day and you get closer to god it sounds simple it's some child like it sounds so easy what is it read the bible and pray every day read your bible as a key your bible is what's going to start you read your is what you're connected to your your your your heavenly language your your cell phone above before you use your physical cell phone you have a you have a cell phone to connect heaven you have a fleet line going to profit to connect us to the feet of the fathers that we can have access to get the god's blessing so we're almost true praise the lord amen all right so [Music] so then feet come a hearing hearing by the word of first of all god 23 12 5 23 says and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your holy spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the common beloved jesus christ so note paul here did not leave all the body part so this is not an esoteric and a philosophical and an intellectual whether kind of mind game thing and hearing things that were not no it has to do spirit soul and body second timothy 2 and i was talking and mentioning sister isaac today how is interesting how like in ephesians paul referred to like soldier talked you know and i was still like that that i realized you cannot just throw ammo on somebody and throw gun and and so on instead of the battle they will get killed there's a training procedure there's actually no using gun i i'm not never click on i hear when you when you hold a gun in your shooting and recoil them different things that you might be prepared for that all that is possibly packaging and training and and everything else discipline shine your boots making up your bed getting an order the bluegill the song the trumpet the certain song and they called to retreat the call to go forward although for the meals whatever it is the training that is there to become a soldier and this is what paul is saying here to timothy in timothy ii timothy 2 is his doubt therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus notice all what we see in here is not paul having a bunch of babies and stuff something like that solid christian solid encouragement doubt therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou the faithful men who shall be able to teach others also so paul saying please pass on this teaching what you heard what you see what your witness let faithful men carry about and teach others thou therefore endure hardness as the good soldier of jesus christ i guess a lot of christians don't do wouldn't like that scripture at all that scripture yeah jump over that one no paul's told timothy endure what hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that wore it entangled himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier and if a man also strives for masteries the next level yet he is not crowned except he strives lawfully the husband man must and that labor must be put was the first particulars of the fruits and this last verse here is very interesting and i guess you know how paul would say these words consider what i see and the lord give the understanding in all things in the amplify it says these words here think over these things i am singing understand them and grasp their application for the lord will grant you full insight and understanding in everyday wow so is almost as if paul is saying hear this i'm giving you ingredients and god will give you the understanding to put them together to mike to get a nice meal think on these things think on the what i'm presenting to you in other words don't ignore them i want to pay careful attention to what i'm presenting to you and god will grant you insight and understanding because what i'm given to you is given by the spirit that is paul is presenting about giving you things that is given by the spirit and the spirit will further reveal it or unfold it do you catch that tonight because you see the things that of god and i i just say it this way what god give brother branham is spirit given words the spoken word is originally seen why would he say that not just words it have different philosophers have played two one confucius and what now they're not originally i talk in people in the market please and share a nice torch and and so on like that all that is good it's very philosophical and it's logical and whatnot that's not original seed that is man's energies that is man philosophizing and meditating on the world and the things of the world and to yourself be true maybe i don't know quote that or what not dynamite but you know this is all kind of quotation and stuff right it sounds good someday sometimes it's good but that's not original seeded the original seed is what comes from the mouth of god the original seed is what come from the everyone sees what's in the bible so that's why i want to encourage you tonight to meditate on this word day and night we're going to close second timothy 2 12 and 16 lower down 12 to 16 if we suffer we shall also read with him if we deny him he'll also deny us if we believe not yet he abides faithfully he cannot ignite himself all these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about with words to no prophet but to the subverting of the years study to show thyself approve unto god a workman that needed not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and being babbling for they would increase on the more ungodliness and that last part it says reminded people the amplified of these facts and solemnly charge them in the presence of the lord to avoid petty controversies over words which does no good but upsets and undermines the fate of the hearers study and the eager to do your utmost to present yourself to god approve tested by trial a workman who has no cause to be ashamed correctly analyzing and accurately dividing rightly handling and skillfully teaching skillfully teaching the word of god but avoid all empty vein useless idol talk for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness and it's so good when you could pull yourself aside and talk to the lord pull yourself aside and make it from the word of god and ask god for strength ask god for good health ask god for your ability to do your best in the short time we have young hood he will cut the work short in righteousness when he first started out we had all black hair and everything else all our energy and strength no we agreeing are we seeing a whole new crop regional and every generation gets almost like weaker but we believe in our hearts that before they call the lord there will be a strong bunch of people that will be here to witness christ they will understand by revelation that the church that jesus built he said punishment i've been my church which is the faith foundation that church is coming to a head a camp that will be the omega bride of jesus christ the capstone church on the earth this church is supposed to be glorious this church going to glorify god he said this bribe will form the headstone that he could come into it so this will be the capstone bride this will be the eve that will not feel the eve that will not fall this bride will be the very word itself in other words the word made flesh this bride will continue the scripture that he is left out because he stopped in the middle of that statement the spirit is upon me for this day the scripture is fulfilled he actually stopped in the middle of a scripture not by chance but by design and the prophet revealed to us that the bride who will have the ministry of christ will pick up the rest of that scripture to declare that they are vengeance of all god we can't declare vengeance we can't declare judgment because we are sinners saved by grace but the ministry of christ can do that that same ministry is promising written the evidence of that ministry is not just you know talk that ministry would be emanated to the flesh of men god will take men as his agency once again a channel of god and channels of god to show god and in showing god we glorify god that is how we grow if i go to the world he said you you take a light and hide it under a bush you take a light and put it in the lampstand there's a bit of light and that is he said the men that men may see your good works and glorify the father in heaven men will see what your good words know give us words and give us works and people will glorify god when they see the word and the works let us borrow it heavenly father i thank you tonight it was so exciting to come here to share this word lord to see the call to meditate to wait to think on these things to hold on to the scriptures for life to know that this word is alive it's not dead it's a living word father may the scriptures come real to the people when the fields open the prophet said the bible becomes a new became a new bible father may the bible become a new bible may it be a real excitement about bible studies may come real may come where you declare yourself and confirm your word with signs one of the miracles and right now even as we close off in prayer that your virtue go out to anyone who is not feeling well anyone need a special touch anyone in depression frustration whatever they may be going through and the jobs in the family in their homes in the relationships father god may your vote you go to them they may have a witness of your presence of your spirit of your power bless the service that will be streamed tomorrow bless the promisingness coming friday the service on sunday and god may be magnified and glorified and all that we see and do god we read the scripture and i said the young people should take a note of it whatever we do we should do it to glorify god if it cannot glorify god may we stop doing it not do it finish with it father may our lives may be recognized that our lives are called for your glory bless your sisters tonight your sons
