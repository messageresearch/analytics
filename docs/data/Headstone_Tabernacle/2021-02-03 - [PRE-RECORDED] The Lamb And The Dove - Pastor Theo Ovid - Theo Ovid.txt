grace upon every soul here tonight and those that would hear this message speak to our hearts and transform our lives we say yes to your word to your truth in these difficult times guide us by your word great jehovah may the fire of god go before us the dove come and lead the eagles this evening in gsm we ask it amen and amen we have one scripture this evening from sin john chapter 1 from verse 29 to 33 we want to go straight to the word of god this evening so in john chapter 1 verse 29 we read the next day john see jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which take away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me commit a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore i might come baptizing with water and john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abored upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptize it with the holy ghost may god a bless the blessing of the reign of his word father we pray that you would take this word and take like an arrow and drive it straight into our hearts we ask in jesus name amen you may be seated i like that description that john harvey in verse 33 upon whom thou shall see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptized it with the holy ghost so what he's also seeing the spirit could descend and not remain but you want the spirit to descend and remain so this evening i have a title the lamb and the dove i'll have an inspiration dove leading eagle oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god give the lord some praising [Applause] hallelujah the dove to lead the eagles not some man to leave the eagles the dove to lead the eagles god promised eagles in the last days hallelujah eagles that could gather together eagles that could soar isn't that right eager to have built-in things in them to overcome to fly into this storm so i want to share some things from the message of the same title lama and dove and and i read the scripture this morning remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure and i love that that god could declare the end from the beginning so he doesn't have to wait for everything to unfold he could speak a word and that word is yet to be but you believe it and that's fate it's the substance of what you're hoping for he could speak a word of your life ten years from now to come and that can't fail because whatever god said got to come to pass it gotta it's truth isn't that right it can't fail like i think one time in the prayer line or disagreement uh but obama must call on a woman and say i live in such and such a place in such a simple place and her friend was nearby but she's not living there i know and whatnot and she was doubting and afterwards when he wouldn't get exposed she said hey i forget to tell you i move out last week praise god she taught me woman was lying it wasn't true but god would can feel god knows all things so you are challenged to lift your feet up and trust god and watch the devil and laugh in his face because god counsel will stand i'm not hearing you this evening glory to god he said my counsel shall stand and i shall do all my pleasure oh glory please god to pour his spirit upon you that's why he said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased to dwell in oh glory to god john didn't know who it was all he know god tell him a sign the one upon whom you see the spirit descending and remaining that's the one to identify oh glory to god that me the spirit have to come down nobody could stop it because the spirit is promised in the last days it shall come to pass afterwards i will pour out my spirit young men shall see visions old men shall dream dreams upon my handmaidens i will pour out my spirit in the last days no demon could stop it the little hell has been uncovered and that can't even stop it filthy demons can't stop it i don't care what the devil put out there god's purpose and counsel must stand we letting the devil know that today i don't care what happened in your life in the times past he has declared the end from the beginning oh give the lord a shout praise god where was thou when i lay the foundation of the earth and the mornings i sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy you didn't have depression back there you wasn't struggling to pay your bills back there no you were having a great time when you saw the cap coming on the pyramid isn't that right you were shouting you were praising god you wasn't teary-eyed and depressed and fed up and wanted to give up and you can't take it no more he wasn't talking like that you were shouting and praising god because you were packed here before we're here to remind you where you come from we're here to tell you where you go in and the devil have no part with you because he came in the beginning but you were before the beginning that's why we are here this evening that's why the spirit had to find jesus because jesus was a son he was a born son he was a predestinated son and the spirit had to find him at the appointed time when his time came nothing could stop it the pharisees couldn't stop it the sadducees couldn't stop it the spirit of god descended upon him and john saw it he said the spirit jesus is upon me because he had anointed me and if jesus had to be anointed you have got to be anointed give the lord a shout of praise therefore you are here to dare to receive the anointing of the holy ghost oh hallelujah amen for glory to god fight for it press for it aim and claim it act upon it you are here to receive something from the lord oh glory to god do you understand what is happening the spirit has to come upon you it has to come and remain it has to come and stare it has to come and abide it can't come on a wolf it can't come on a snake it can't come on bad behavior but the dog will come to the land it's the job and the lamb oh glory to god give the lord a shout of praise [Applause] let me be seated oh hallelujah do i know all mysteries seven thunder seven seals mystery inside out on the back side front side left side right side all the sides in half hidden unhidden all kind of mysteries trumpet fires black wolves whatever new name played your four seven thunder seven seas any mystery you could think about do i know all of that and have no charity still nothing still wasting time zero naught nada nothing oh glory to god do i give my body to be burned still naught now they're nothing charity suffered long i said can it's already faulted of itself it's not easily proposed it buried all things it believed in all things it opened all things it enjoyed all things charity never feel it oh glory to god hallelujah we want that robe of love we want that power that the devil cannot touch he can impersonate every gift but he cannot impersonate the love of god how ritual pure how measureless and strong it shall forever more endure the sins an angel saw or give the lord a shout to praise nothing could stop it nothing could hinder it nothing could conquer it it can't fail it never fail it oh give the lord some praises upon whom you see your spirit descending hallelujah i'm remaining [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i call this applied christianity i'm not talking about the regular come to church christianity i'm talking about what you could apply to attract that dove to come to you because it's what you do going to bring that death to you it's your behavior will determine whether that dove will be abstracted to you you and that dove must lock eyes you almost don't have sweet eye that doesn't have to cool that does have the blood that doesn't have to come and hold up when they cross this my darkness was upon the people and the spirit of god move upon the face of the water the spirit of god was like a dove that was brooding over the troubled waters and when the spirit began to move then god said let there be light when the spirit begins to move you can look out for the voice of god we are here to create atmosphere we are here to create an atmosphere our atmosphere is already here lord upon whom you see the spirit descending and remaining that's the one that gonna baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire or give the lord a shout oh i feel energized this evening i feel empowered deceive them [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh glory oh glory glory man my god my mind [Applause] you will be caesar look at the drama four hundred years saturdays these scenes scribes hanging all the tracks i know their books playing their tapes this one of this doctrine that one of that doctrine humans natural people none of them hearing from god the under rituals historical rituals they're under the tradition of the elders who was there for donkey years all they know is what the elders did and what the elders did before that the first man to interrupt them was a word message from john the baptist a rugged man with the name eliezer or ezekiel or any kind of strange name his name was john a wilderness man called aside by god eating wild oak locusts and honey come on the wilderness because he had to pick up the scripture the voice of one crying wilderness not no manifestation just a voice a voice no signs no wonders no miracles just a ministry of the word just a voice saying fire is coming power is coming dynamics is coming just the spirit of prophecy upon john the baptist oh hallelujah no miracles no signs no declaration of power and he said there was one standing among you whom you know not he is going to do something special he's going to burn fire going to come out his mouth fire gonna come out fire that's what we're here for that's what we're here for this evening for the fire of god oh hallelujah oh glory to god oh hallelujah blessed be name of the lord this counts are going to stand god declare the end from the beginning see if god declare your adoption who's going to stop it god told joshua that land is to be conquered now watch joshua go to the process yet but god tell him the end from the beginning he said all the land from gesuri to hear all of that shall be your coast no man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life he's given him the end he's giving him the target he's giving me what he's going after don't short yourself you are going to be a christian come on now don't short yourself the enemy trying to take my voice but forget about it you try to shot yourself we come out to go in you may be seated i come out to go in we're going to get fight with the world of course the world will give us a fight the devil must fight you you're gonna get fight with lust of the eyes you'll get fight with lust in the flesh you'll get fight with the pride of life you must get fight if you're not getting fight something is wrong with you it means you get beat up already it means you have no more licks to get it means you on the floor but if you're fighting keep on fighting it's got to be a fight come on see him and somebody oh glory to god if the devil is not troubling you he have you [Applause] i'm not hearing you if the devil is not troubling you he have you in his prison he's hanging out with food again but if the devil is troubling you he's worried about you because you don't know who you are he don't know whose you are he don't know where you come from and he don't know where you're going but you come from god and you are going back to god oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the fire is in the building yeah the power is in the building oh yes oh yes oh yes the spirit is here for deliverance the spirit is here for the breakthrough oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god the spirit of god is here all glory to god deliverance time is now oh yes yes pray two times now victory time is now [Applause] hallelujah glory glory glory open him up and shout open him out and praise your god open the mouth and worship [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you may be seated so listen to this all of a sudden people getting convicted by the voice of the word to john all right he said repent he said bring forth fruit meet unto repentance and all you've seen is a natural progression of humans being baptized in water but this day was different this day john didn't see a human this day john saw a dove he saw the spirit descending they never saw that before this was the first time they saw the spirit descending as a dove upon the lamb oh glory to god hallelujah that's why john could say behold the lamb of god oh hallelujah for glory to god and once the dove comes among us and come to lead ammonia and as many as are led by the spirit they are glory as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of god oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god so all these years oh my jesus those seven virtues were supposed to make bring us to be lamb-like all the virtues was to teach us how to get out of the way all those virtues was to bring us to a place where our spirit is broken where we lost our own will our own choices and our own way where we surrender totally and completely that we can be led by the spirit into the wilderness where he leads me there i'm going to follow oh glory to god hallelujah the dove can't come on arrogance you may be seated the dove can't come on pride the dove can't come on hostile ministers evil people angry hateful people there is a requirement for the dr lan the dove could hover over but he's not going to rest until oh my god i wish i had the voice that the dove he is flying over but he want to rest he wanted to descend and remain [Applause] amen hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah i heard somebody say fame and fortune could get you to the front door but it's character to keep you on the stage yes personality and superfluity and all your ways can get you to meet people and greet people and see people but if you don't care have character they're [Music] is looking to land all over the world that da is flying across this message all over the world they could believe this they could believe that it doesn't matter what they believe is whether or not the runway is prepared for the landing of the dove and if the dove has seen no place to land he has not landed praise god this is not air force one this is the one this is the same death that that came upon jesus must come upon sons to be born in the last days jesus was our example seed son and if the spirit came upon him that spirit come upon you also notice notice let me read the thing here you will be seated oh hallelujah oh glory to god it's a short service this evening but i know it will be inspiring to you you will understand all the mysteries you heard me read it already but i prayed a prayer that the mysteries be revealed that women know how to conduct ourselves and behave ourselves what is he talking about all the mysteries you see divine revelation makes you humble because you didn't give yourself it you didn't study it it's the lord himself flesh and blood had not revealed it unto you but my father in heaven when you understand the grace and sovereignty of god has revealed his love to you you can't boast you can brag you can feel you better than somebody else it's the grace of god that you are who you are that you have the ability to hear direct from god just to hear oh you could shout about that many people would love to hear the voice of god but you heard it we are hearing it we heard it in the last days the voice of god and it has the ability to make us act upon what we hear you see if you don't act you haven't heard it but when you hear it you got to act upon it a man i've never heard the voice of god and not act on it once you hear god's voice something got to move you something got to stir you something got to fire you daniel said those prophets said it like fire lock up in my pose oh hallelujah oh hallelujah oh glory to god how many looking for a transformation how many looking for a change you coming like a pig and you're gonna walk out here a lamb give the lord a shout of praise you hear what i said you come here like a pig but you're gonna leave your alarm that is what the gospel was given for oh hallelujah oh glory oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah my god my god oh glory let me read something brother branham you may be seated it's a strange thing to think that when god chose to represent the son on it he represents him in a creature called a lamb and many times we might wonder why he was called a lamb a lamb is the meekest of all creatures of the earth there is nothing more mika than a lamb and the orthodox church knew they had to offer up a lamb as a substitute for sin knowing that god had passed the penalty of death and something must die and the life was in the blood and the life was in jesus christ and he was the lamb of god and the virgin mary was overshadowed by the holy spirit and god created in a womb a blood cell that brought forth the messiah jesus christ it was the blood cell of god that when he died and the bloodshed was broken the spirit was released to call and bring forth other sons of god you heard what i said when he died at calvary and his blood cell was broken the spirit was released in every age and not one of them missed it because god purpose must stand he has declared the end from the beginning in other words he see it here and come back here and work it out right here you not hear what i am saying he sees the end he come back to the beginning and start from here we are going to where we come from and we come from where we are going give the lord a shout in the house this evening [Applause] now watch oh glory to god therefore my the innocent lovely lamb is a great creature god likeness the lambs the lamb is an animal that cannot make his own way we find out we can't make our own way we have to lean upon his arm upon his guidance notice the makers of birds is the dove and many times it represents the holy spirit and notice the dove is a sign of peace wonderful peace the dove is one bird the crow is a scavenger another bird he can't eat the diet of a scavenger because his makeup is different he has no gall he has no bitterness he has no god he has no bitterness he can't digest the things of the world he can only eat clean and pure things he's the type of the christian that packs the dove in his heart no call of bitterness no root of bitterness they do you this or what they do you that so what they do the other so what god purpose must stand they lie on you so what they hate you so what they gave up on you so what the purpose of god must stand i shall do my pleasure oh hallelujah oh glory to god are you with me are you with me sister you're gonna be blessed brother you will be blessed you stay with the world you've got to be blessed that there is a liar he is angry he can't enjoy this supernatural presence he was kicked out of heavenly places he don't want this he can't have this this belongs to us this belongs this is our home we belong in here [Applause] what sin it is christ that justify it oh glory to god what sin could that devil accuse you of you are free come on johnny crew you are free come on now we cut the course this morning we broke the chains this morning you are free to jump you are free to shout you are free to praise god you are free [Applause] what complex kill that it's not complex the only complexity of his fate virtue knowledge temperance patience you have no inferiority complex you have no you're too small you're too big you're too tall you don't have the education forget that oh he's on you he called all he called he justified all he justified he had glory glory throw me the cut [Applause] not some he for you may be seated to for new you is to know you before so i could say all those he knew before he had justified the word justify means you never did it the democrat come and point your finger i will tell him go back with your finger and your hand don't come and point no finger oh he for you we are justified today as if we never did it my god i feel like coming over here and saying amen preacher preacher praise god in it [Applause] give me [Applause] you ever gone in a place setting up samples when price matter wanted that sample yes to please we selling something we hear it we play it the woman guilty as charged stone that woman name is in the book she doesn't know it that woman is free she doesn't know it she's in tears but she is free she is forgiven but she is broken she doesn't know it yet yet yet her accusers are ready but god purpose must stand because he declared the end from the [Applause] beginning jesus said a simple word which one of you without sin cast the first stone when they could see the elder in the camera he no remember he had to pay some bills and they could see the deacon in the camp he was scrambling because he forget he had to pick up the groceries for his wife all of them dropped the stones i don't have excuse and jesus gave them time out you turn this back to them he give them thai note for they to look at themselves and let the conscience bother them and trouble them because all they want to condemn on the high horses have things in their closet all hidden up so she just wanted to bust them and expose them before you're ripping to this woman before you condemn this woman before you point all your fingers at this woman there's some fingers pointed back at you and they all left and when jesus broke the silence he said woman let's call this trial let's quote the call case the court case woman stand forward witnesses come forward none if there are no witnesses you have to dismiss the kids jesus said where are the witnesses not my lord neither do i condemn me now go and sin no more no more no more what what's that woman do my god i was gonna dance in the street oh glory to god i was gonna shout like i never shouted before because [Applause] come on glory love god you see you see you may be seasoned you see if you leave egypt and you're not sure how free you are the devil like pharaoh could see you as a runaway slave so he want to get you back as far as he concerned you leave his territory as far as he is concerned you belong to the devil but we are saying no satan no satan we don't belong to you we are not run away we are a liberated people we are people set free by the blood of the lamb i know the blood is not preached much but the blood prevails despite what the people say despite what the devil say all the blood prevails no matter what the devil say thank god thank god the blood prevails to show you how powerful this thing is you may be seated brother branham said if the power is to come among a people it wouldn't even be their prayer it will be the grace of god praying doesn't mean power it's still the grace of god grace is suffering grace is from a sovereign one is from a sovereign king he give to whomsoever he will he redeem whoever he will he redeeming the foreknown the elected the predestinated the word bride you want to tell me that god sees me as a world bride and i am dead and depressed no devil every day i'm getting stronger every day the devil gets nervous because the people that know their god shall be strong under great exploits the devil is having a nervous time this evening because he thought after food you will be dead he taught after this morning service you would come in here we had to crank you up but he has something coming we not have to have to crank you up you are fired up ready to go go god hallelujah you are fired and ready to go we're gonna burn out the meat we're gonna burn all the food this evening we're going to shout like we never shouted before because we see our names in the lamb's book of life and we know who the son of man set free is free indeed for hallelujah for glory to god glory to god glory to god my my my my my my my my my hallelujah hallelujah friends meekness it's not weakness meekness is power in control oh hallelujah not because the man looking meek that does not mean he is weak come on same and somebody what man called great god called foolish and what god called foolish what man called foolish god called great you may be seated oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory oh my my my i feel the mighty movement of his spirit i feel the breath of god upon you he breathed upon him receiving the holy ghost i feel the breath of god upon you deceiving we are moving into the supernatural we are moving into the dove descending and remaining we are moving and the people that know their god oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah in every age the heart of a people that god must anoint but listen to this why did he choose the lamb and the dove it's because the dove could not abide in nothing else but a lamb the natures are the same let me drop this in here all these ministers impersonating ranking the self criminal self himself pretending himself playing himself and the beef on display but abram said it takes a humble heart dedicated to god to bring jesus christ in the present tense so after a while all he talked where get exposed you know all the male champions all who are only voicing and talking and yapping and they're not leaving anything and they have nothing to show god all that can get exposure because it takes a humble heart dedicated to god so when jesus took his belt and beat them out the temple that was humble heart wrecking the show and telling them my father's house shall be called a house of prayer don't miss the take mistake for arrogance or bad behavior no no he was angry [Applause] you ever see a man angry with a smile what kind of anger is there he was angry he was angry because he was corrupting the house of god with money changes and selling of doves and birds and he beat them up and showed them over the tables and whatnot he was angry say my father's the zeal of my father's house had eaten me up this passion for the father's house and that's what god bringing inside of here certain things we have tolerated we will no longer tolerate we will smoke you up or smoke you out or you will choose your way out but this church is not going to be the same we're going to take some fire bombs and just throw it praise god that's what the trainers are going to do my god after you cross a border you'll blow up the bridge behind you no turning back don't need no old man and husband to go backward don't know your old fornication unclean able to go back with burn it blow it up praise god break it down you're only moving forward everything make a step blow the bridge behind you you have nothing to fall back on oh hallelujah hallelujah like that man who went across in south america when he reached the conquer the land when he reached what he told them he said burn the boat they say you've got to be kidding. he wanted them to get desperate that's right and some of them saying but this is what had to take us back he said no we have to take their boats we're gonna burn ours so we're not going back on ours he forced them to fight he forced them to press he forced them to say you know what my bird bone i've got to get the boats that they have and to get them you have to fight they're not giving you their boats they're not selling you their bulls the devil not stupid the devil not giving you an offer for you just to take it what he took from you you got to take it back and the kingdom suffer violence and the violent take it by force tell somebody take it by false tell somebody that [Applause] this what we are standing for is non-negotiable we're not negotiating this we're not negotiating signs wonders miracles revival spirit overcoming power of god supernatural omnipotence speaking the word miraculous we are not negotiating that we are declaring action time [Applause] do you understand remember the spirit that is numb upon you is against the evil spirits that is in your home [Music] or attacking your home when you go home you are walking with an anointing with a light with a lamp with the power with an unction you got to believe it you gotta have faith in it you got to know it when you walk in the devil walk out when you come to the front door to take the back door he wants to know if it's abiding he's walking around the house because he's not sure if that's going to stay if there's going to remain you see you got to act right you got to talk right you got to live right for this doctor abide it's going to abide somebody's going to get the abiding that's why maybe she said i'm almost done that's why i call it applied christianity because this is things you could apply to be sweet to your wife to getting temper spasm and temper spells because when they temper they double he's going further and further and he wants to come because your son but your behavior and the landing pad it's not good enough for the doctor land when he tried to land he said who not not now not know the kind of temper he's in not know i i i check him back a little later see that wife and she rude mountain so not not now no no see how she moat little peppery and so on like a whip and so on not no not now i got hung outside and then she cooled down and when it kind of cooled down the drops are the cool lord god forgive me all the dove loves that oh god i repent the dove loves that lord i'm going to make things right the dove loves that i'm humbling myself loves that oh these things the dog just love and dove keeps coming and coming hallelujah comes and lands like right now it's upon you i know it's upon you i feel it and know it say it's upon you right now the devil is not upon you the dove is upon you i'm saying it right to your face the dove is upon you right now whether you keep him it's a different thing [Applause] i'm not preaching the devil and the wolf i'm preaching the dove and the lamb hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god glory to god glory hallelujah hallelujah mark the perfect man he can bridle his tongue amen mark the imperfect man his tongue is loose mark the church who in between so you see in terms of temperance and patience god must set it up for something to happen all these thunders and all these mysteries and virtues you really expect to sit on a church bench him that overcome it to him that god said to him that said amen if he says to him say amen shall i grant to sit on my throne is thousands sitting in australia jesus said amen i don't know and you get through man but jesus to him that overcome it as i overcome wait stop you mean jesus had to overcome yes overcome what lust of the eyes lust in the flesh god and put your good wings on him and say fly away oh glory jesus didn't come like that when lazarus were dead and he committed everybody cried he cried too he's not like this freak this hypocritical freak boy he wiped dead and here cry as if that's a spiritual something my wife died i cried what kind of nonsense is that is my wife all these years and i cried as a man i cried what jesus was jesus christ but after he finished crying you see where have you laid him there was tears over that's emotional time i had a time for that but noah fixed that fix up already i cried where they pay are you later [Music] then jesus grown in the spirit he come out a human crying and grown in the spirit where have you lit him he kind of grown in the spirit wasn't happening there anointing said to come voice voice angel oh voice of the archangel then jesus gave a big promise he aimed if you're sick you'll get healed the man dead he's a heater believe it on me man you know he said he said i am the resurrection and the life he was giving him a promise that he didn't have before understand is the man dead that's in the human remembrance yes we got awake i am the resurrection so people have to connect to that promise to activate it that promise was the sim card to put in the phone to activate jason's resurrection i am the resurrection and the life that healing sim card can work the phone angle ring but when she putting that inside the car even now lord whatsoever you shall ask oh let's call on the line lazarus comfort lazarus heard it because this this cell phone thing here working different that voice does travel the only impersonating what we already have that voice passed through the regions of the laws to reaches of the dead that voice was sounding lazarus last year come forth come forward come forward and when that voice god purpose gonna stand when that voice begin to ricochet in this church in this island across the world nothing going to stop it the graves gonna hear it glory that god the dead gonna come forth [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] him this is right that's his privilege keep on trying devil that we're going to stop what we're going to have this evening i'm almost done hallelujah
