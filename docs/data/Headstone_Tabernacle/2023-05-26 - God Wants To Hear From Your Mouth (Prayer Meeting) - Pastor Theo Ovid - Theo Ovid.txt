comfort knowing that this is not the only world and there's truly a land beyond the river father God we thank you for life and the opportunity that you have given us to serve you and to serve each other bless this time of prayer tonight bless the exhortation and fuels that will be spoken in Jesus I ask it amen and amen God bless you and each of your Bibles I'd like you to tune with me to Romans chapter 10. reading from verse 4 Romans chapter 10. reading from verse 4. Romans chapter 10. for Christ is the end of the law or righteousness to everyone that believeth for Moses described it the righteousness which is of the law that the man which do it those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of Faith speaks on this wise synonym heart who shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall Ascend into the deep that is to bring Christ up again from the dead but what see at it the word is 90 even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach for or if for if Thou shalt confess with thy among the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God had risen from the dead though shall be seen foreign on the Salvation or last scripture we're going to read us from Genesis chapter 24. you want to read from verse 54 to 60. and this is after Elisa are found Rebecca and came to a home with gifts speaking to the parents and so on because he was seeking our pride for Isaac and this is from verse 54 and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him carried all night the rules up in the morning he said send me a wing unto my master and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us for a few days add at least 10. after that she shall go so they wanted extension of Rebecca State at a home but he said unto them as a 56 here let me not seeing the Lord had prospered my way send me away that I may go to my master and they said we will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth and they call Rebecca and said unto her will thou go with this man and he said and she said I will go and they sent away Rebecca the assistant and her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men without a mother of thousands of millions are led by seed possess the Gate of those which hit them may God bless his word I trust the Lord that you are doing fine and as I said sometime I'm back or after Wednesday night service how do we show God that we love him by conducting ourselves with joy amidst the trials he in his wisdom sense are we so tonight I have a word for you and it's God wants to hear from your mouth God wants to hear from your mouth like your mother mouth your sister mouth your brother-in-law your father mode your mouth you know there are people that say pray for me pray for me they're not praying for the self and if you begin to pray they well yes Lord yes Lord yes or they're not praying or not they're backing up your prayer godo want you to just be a prayer backer which is fine there's nothing wrong with that but he wants to hear from you your own mode now the scripture we read in and Romans I want to read a portion of it in the Amplified from verse 8. it says but what does it see the word God's message in Christ is near you on your lips and in your heart that is the word the message the basis and object of our faith which we preach because this name if you acknowledge and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in your heart believe adhere to trust in and rely on the truth that God reason from the dead you will be saved this is what I want to come to was 10 for with the heart a person believes adheres to trust in and relies on Christ and so is Justified declared righteous are acceptable to God and with the mouth the demote he confesses declares openly and speaks out freely his face and confirms his salvation so God wants to hear from your mouth and your mold or what your confession is supposed to be what's in your heart if you're speaking one thing on your heart saying something else like hypocrisy because that is what the Holy Spirit picks up the Holy Spirit picks up what's in the heart what is in your heart and it comes out by the confession of your mouth well Hebrews 3 1 is a scripture about a band referred to quite a lot wherefore holy Brethren particles of the heaven we call him consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus and he explained that this word profession is confession the high priest of our confession well let's read a few things I'll see what the Lord do tonight he speaks Hebrews 3 1 the Bible said he is a high priest of our confession is that right it's profess and confesses the same word there you know he can't do one thing for us till we accept it and say that we have accepted it and believe it and testify of it is that right so you have to accept it and see it you can't hear the word and say some kind of nonsense or say something negative you have to accept it and so you believe it testify of it he can't do nothing no matter what yes you've got to accept it first by faith and believe it and confess that it is right and he before God makes it right in your stead as a high priest a high priest is to make intercessions is that right he touched by the feeling of our affirmities now as far as I know to be the truth and God knows that and if you're here tonight every one of you would accept Jesus right now as your healer and say Lord this settle it right here I don't care if I eat twice as bad if I am three times a sick five times as lean if I can't do no more than wiggle my finger I'm going to wiggle my finger and give you praise amen you healed me and as far as I know the scripture is to be true God is under obligation if your heart is pure and clean to make you well then we say Amen tonight oh blessed be the name of the Lord now the gospel friends as clear as I know it it's the individual now USC well what's the use in preaching that's what a minister is for God send preachers to preach the word when you hear it search it seize the truth accept it no the preacher doesn't save you his message doesn't save you your personal fate in a Risen Lord Jesus is what saves you no matter how much you cry how loud you want to holler how much you want to take on it will never save you until you believe it with your heart stand up and confess it for he is the high priest of our confession or Hebrews 3 or we confess he's the high priest to make a decision upon what we confess is the truth any team there we go that was included in the atonement in the is the personal property of every believer this statement would repeated anything that was included in the atonement in the personal prop is the personal property of everybody no your obedient challenge tonight to go past your own feelings failures fears shortcomings weaknesses struggles to see what God has said and whether you believe what God Said by the word when a man gets saved for a woman boy or girl God gives them a checkbook as it was when Jesus name at the bottom of every check for anything redempted blessing that Jesus died for it's your personal property think about it is that a change business it's not a church of fear it's your personal property don't be afraid to fill it out the bank of heaven will recognize it Jesus said well watch how he connects the scripture together with this Jesus said whatever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it what you ask the father in my name that will I do the unlimited unsuitable Riches of Jesus Christ so you know what he says whatsoever thing to desire When you pray believe you have received it and you shall receive it so yeah almost you believe in before you actually have it let's continue he cannot do nothing for us until first we confess that he has done it and act upon it whatever things you desire When you pray believe you receive a that's the order you believe it no and you receive it and it shall be given unto you he cannot hear you until fools you confess he has but if you would accept no what he has done for you okay now in other words he cannot save you by the Merit of your prayer he cannot save you by the merits of your enthusiasm or your good books he saves you by the merits of your faith and your confession and they bring you right back to brother Kelly so testimony where you say he was at his lowest wondering how are we going to get out of this hole out of this and sometimes we find ourselves in spots in spots of depression frustration anguish loneliness tiredness weariness and just almost like lost in our own world bubble and we crash and it looks like all is gone All Is Lost and all of a sudden you could come to the speech and say Lord this is me I'm weak I'm struggling I'm needy of you and I come to put my trust in you and get strength from you all of a sudden that strength comes on in listen to this again he cannot save you by the marriage of your prayer he cannot save you by the merits of your enthusiasm or your good works he saves you by the merits of your feet and your confession for if you would confess me before men him will I confess before my father will be angel there's no need of arguing of it whether it's in the atonement if it's any word God is Sovereign and has to fulfill his word God said so God is no more than his word and if his word is no good then he is no good I if I can't control confidence in what you say you are no good but you are just as good as you would and God is just as good as his word is as a Christian believer here we go I believe this Bible is inspired and it is written by the Holy Spirit and it is the infallible word of God and God is under obligation to his word to the believer that will accept this word and any word is a seed if you accept it in your heart by faith believe it and confess it God will bring it to pass this tonight can't feel the word is a seed you receive it you accept it you confess it you act upon it and it will materialize okay listen close you will never live above your confession Jesus is the high piece of a confession is that right no I'm not safe tonight because I get happy and shocked that isn't it I cannot see because my gift of God works through me I am saved because I have met the conditions that Jesus Christ acquired from me I am saved according to the Bible is that right here we go this is above and this has affected people see we see these type people get problems with this not because I feel like I am saved Satan can whip you around the stump on your feelings but he can't when it is Dusty at the Lord see he can't do that he can't wait across that that defeating so that is why you can't go by your emotions by your feelings by what you see with your eyes and your sight you can't go by that as a son you have to use the eye of Faith because that was God that that's what God did and he expresses sons and Prophets to be the same now when you believe you will see sitting in your seat out wherever you accepted it I begin to confess and tell people you receive you kept on saying I'm saved the people say football Ram is drilling down ain't no difference in you but you believe their words is that right and you kept on with your confession and after a while it worked righteousness I sure especially you all the ones remember when they gave your heart to the Lord and started to testify to your family and friends of course people mock you laugh at you but with a red joy to give a testimony I am saved Jesus saved me I got baptized in Jesus name the feeling good you will be the word of God for Peters have repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of your sins and you feel all your sins just wash away if you clean you feel pure you feel cool you feel ready by God you feel it doubles around you and the more you talk about it it's the more and give your juice and give you energy Your Enthusiasm I remember I was feeling low in my early Christian walk and my brother who I looked up to he I met him I started talking about him the backside and I was so shocked and I didn't think twice I didn't testify him I said you could talk about backslide and when I said oh goodness to him and talk about the goodness of God all of a sudden my Blues my dong that left I got strength and I got energized because I want to know oh come a senior brother or older brother like that talking about backsliding and I'm a new convert I'm fresh on the Block and I'm going to my battles and stuff and here it is over going backside I said no way oh you could do that we could think about that that is something although my more give my testimony out of my mouth came something to share and that encouraged him and he saw the political okay the people say there ain't no difference in you you believe their wives and you kept with your confession and after a while it worked righteousness and all your neighbors and everybody knows you are saved now because you believe it you confess it what happened what changed you is the high priest of your confession sit in the right hand of the father making good what you are confessing and then he switches now to say the same thing is in by healing you accept him as your healer renounce your feelings see I'm feeling sick I'm feeling more sick I feel terrible no renounce your feelings it is not by feelings it's by faith say you are healed believe you are healed act like you are healed associate with those who believe in healing and God will bring you right out to perfect sowness of Health it will not fail oh Blessed Be can we give God some presents right here now God have been testing the patriarch because he had given my promise Hallelujah only those who have a promise him and when God makes a promise he wants to be sure that this person is worthy of the promise before he fulfills what he said or what he promises so Abraham had been promised that through his seed the whole world will be blessed and he will have a son and the son out of him should come forth a seed at the Blessed whole earth and Abraham when the promise was given to him was 75 years old see where his wife 65 years old but the Bible tells us that Abraham staggered not that the promises gone too unreleased he was strong given praise to God and God Time After Time tested him but he had come in to that final test before the blessings was going to happen brother Ovid you mean there's a final test yes all the test is not continuous continuous as a final test when that test is before the blessing was going to happen discontinue and that's the way it is with all the sins of Abraham God gave us that final test just before he gives the promise and if it is possible I like to say something here personally but I will hold that that final test to see how you would react upon it your reaction and when he had give Abraham is this test he found Abraham was just as true as he was when he started what a blessing it would be this morning if we who take his promise of healing would stand just as true as we did when we stood here and accepted it no matter what the doctor said stand just is true and when he did this never would tell his only son but was about to punch his knife into Isaac's bosom to destroy his testimony yet testify over the world to know it that he was acquainted with that he was going to have this son and when this son came he was asked to double back and to destroy the only hope that he had for his testimony to be fulfilled and when God seen that he was loyal to that fit that he had in God God looked out of the heavens and said I have sworn by myself that I bless you and multiply you and your seed shall possess the Gate of the enemy what a promise let me finish the Rebecca the description we read tonight and Rebecca which was to be the mother of this noted promise awaited son when she was called to the final test of a strange man that he'd never seen before only she seen the working of the Holy Spirit and when her parents could not fully decide whether she should go with a stranger or not to be wife of a man she had never seen she was brought to the final test we will get the damsel and let us speak we will hear from her mouth whether she will go yes or no and this is where I get this question for the night parameter and that is the way it is brought to all the seed of God it's got to be your mount God wants to hear from you this is not speaking to your wife or speaking to your children or speaking to your boss or your neighbor or your family or your relatives this is speaking to God God want to hear from you question if Jesus is to come in your home tonight and ask will you be made whole what would be your response there are some people they are content to be as they are if Jesus comes to land and say do you want to be changed do you want a Transformer life do you want to be healed do you want to be delivered there's some people they're not ready yet for deliverance because they don't want to give up is sin they don't want to give up the way how they live they choose themselves over the word so they choose their own pleasure there's a scripture they're talking about he that is strong uh help those that are weak or infirmed or such like that and not to please themselves there are so many Christians stay on the side of dependency where they're looking for somebody to pray for them somebody to encourage them somebody to bless them they bless no one they encourage no one they don't charge anyone or push anyone they are always in sick mood or independency mode or in depression mode they cannot even rise to confess I am healed I'm delivered and free or looking for the opportunity to share testimony and encourage someone you want to tell me God save you and you cannot get a testament and courage a soul a heart a life you probably talk about that man it's not as bright man on my right mind until you see Jesus Christ something is wrong he said that's the way it's brought to all the seed of God has got to be your mouth God wants to hear from you so when she was put to the test she never hesitated and she said I will go let me make up my mind she didn't say let me live in my mind let me start it over she was fully persuaded and that's the people that God can use when you're fully persuaded what could keep his promise all right I'm closing well the brand name was in a prayer line and he was talking to the people I just want to go through this mountain just pointing something to you let's say thanks be to God are you believing do you believe in all your heart does he do all things well his name yesterday do you believe it all your heart so he's Minister into the people there then I'm gonna ask you to do something put your hands over on another for just a minute I will show you the glory of God don't doubt have faith I I'm not beside myself but I'm getting awful week I must stop just alone I trust that God has confirmed what I've told me the truth nothing in me believe him it doesn't matter whether you touch me or touch me now he will prove it now you lay your hands on each other that's the scripture these signs are from their belief over in the Overflow lay your hands on each other if you are sick and needy I'm going to pray for you if you believe in my prayer you are fit now as you bow your head or listen to what godivans see at this point I want to put I want to put in your mouth the words that will defeat the Devil right now as you bow your head I want you to I want to put in your mouth the words that will defeat the Devil right now you just pray them as I repeat them with your head spout and then he begins almighty God creator of Heaven is on Earth author of everlasting life give of every good gift have mercy upon me I guess the people is repeated that I am in need of that Grace and of thy healing power healing O Lord and heal the person I have my hands on be merciful to them Lord I sympathize with them for they are suffering too I now believe that you are risen Christ showing Among Us the Great sign and wonders that you promise you will do be merciful to me and I will serve you with all my heart as long as I live and by your grace this night I accept you because you promised I believe I am now healed I believe I accept it I shall not listen to Satan anymore I will praise God for my healing for by Jesus Stripes I am not human just keep closed in keep closing Reverend you have prayed you said the right words just in your heart feel his goodness coming down feel them Keys Turn the drawing dear and that faith that you once wanted is no coming unless something telling you that something here by me something is making me well my headache is gone my stomach trouble is vanished I feel different in my limbs my arms new life is coming in keep that on your mind though but I ask the devil in Jesus name to depart from you that's the devil that would make you doubted at any time then he said Lord God Creed of Heaven on Earth I come to the in the name of the Lord Jesus asking you to be merciful and pardon our unbelief just one more I'll be close he said Do You Believe does everybody believe is
