Father, we thank you for your presence. We thank you for your word. We thank you for [music] this season and time that you'll bring us into this holy time of God. Father, we pray that you would visit the people this morning. Speak to their hearts, transform [music] their minds and their lives. Father, we know the lid of hell has been uncovered and [music] streams of demon powers loosed upon the earth. And people walk light and carefree without thinking of the heavy demonic activity loosed against their lives, their homes, their families. Lord, we're not living in normal times. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; We're living in challenging and difficult times. And as hell have enlarged its mouth and streams of demon powers have been loosed on the earth.

We are enlightened, Lord, and we're delighted to know that you have kept your promise &gt;&gt; and you would keep your promise &gt;&gt; and you would never fail the royal seeds of Abraham &gt;&gt; because you told your servant Abraham that thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy. And father, the gates of sickness, the gates of disease, the gates of of struggles and and prison and whatever it is, we have a promise in that word to possess the gates of the enemy. Father, you even promise in your word to raise a standard against the enemy. &gt;&gt; You can't back down from that. Not when the floods is all around us, Lord. You've got to raise a standard according to your promised word. You even said your word can't return void. And you send your prophet to speak spoken word to circle the whole earth to be activated in a season and time. And we feel that you're about to activate that word that produces the manifestation of the sons of God. We feel that you're here to activate the word that Jesus is among us to confirm with signs and wonders and miracles. Come among us, Lord. Set every captive free. Restore the backsliding heart. heal the sick in our midst and break a revival fire among your people. Father, be glorified in our midst in Jesus name we ask it. Amen and amen. Before you have your seats, just turn around and greet somebody in Jesus name. Praise God. And tell them welcome. Tell them it's good to be here. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. [music] Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that chorus. We'll walk in the light. &gt;&gt; We walk in the light. Such a beauty [music] for light comes where the de drops. [music] Your mercies shine bright. Shine all around us by day and [music] by night. It is Jesus. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. We'll walk in the light. We walk in. Hallelujah. Beauty. [music] Oh, glory. Hallelujah. Oh yes, Lord Jesus.

So, God bless you. If your Bibles, I like you to turn to Daniel chapter 12. Want to read 1:4. Want to look at 1 Corinthians chapter 10. Want to read 1-1. Ephesians chapter 1. I want to word read from verse 3 to 10. Thank you musicians. Greetings in Jesus name to you all. Welcome. Greeting to all those connected to us on the internet. Welcome you to our Sunday morning worship fellowship unto God. Daniel chapter 12 reading verse 1 to4 and at that time shall Michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and that there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone one that shall be found written in the book. Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. But they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever. But thou, oh Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro. Knowledge shall be increased. Reading from 1 Corinthians chapter 10, want to read from verse one. Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant. How that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea. Were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea. Did all eat the same spiritual meat. Did they all drink the same spiritual drink? For they drank of that spiritual rock that follow them. That rock was Christ. But with many of them, God was not well pleased. For they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted. Neither be idolattors as were some of them. As it is written, the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play. Neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and 20,000. Neither let us tempt Christ. Some of them also tempted and were destroyed of the serpents. Neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer. Now all these things happen unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come. Final scripture Ephesians chapter 3 1 we want to read from verse three. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he had abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he had purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, earth even in him. May God bless his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; It's always good to to come into the house of God. It's always good to come and hear the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So, this is our convention week. There'll be no service on Thursday. Looking forward for a great time beginning Friday 10:00 and Friday evening and for the 3 days 10 and 4. Looking for a great time in the Lord. A great transformation time. &gt;&gt; We are promised great things and we ought to be under great expectation. &gt;&gt; Must be under great expectation. &gt;&gt; We have a title this morning. The title is the fullness of times. &gt;&gt; That's the title. The fullness of times. I have an inspiration waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the inspiration. Waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. And this scripture, this inspiration is from Romans 8:19. It says, "For the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the man of the sons of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the amplified it says for the even the whole creation all nature waits expectantly and longs earnestly for God's sons to be made known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's waiting for the revealing or the disclosing of their sunship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's not talkship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is sunship. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So the creation itself is waiting for the revealing or the unfolding of their sunship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, this is tremendous. &gt;&gt; Just imagine the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God. When God will pull the veil off of his sons. Now, these are sons of God. &gt;&gt; Not humans, not just natural people. Sons of God. &gt;&gt; And sons of God express God. &gt;&gt; Bible said he came unto his own, his own receive him not. But as many as receive him, to them he give power to become the sons of God. Amen. Not Baptist, &gt;&gt; not Methodist, not Pentecostal, not Jehovah Witness, not Catholic. Power to become not a church member. &gt;&gt; Power to become &gt;&gt; the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Sons of God talk a certain way. They act a certain way. They dress a certain way. They live a certain way. Sons of God. THEY ARE DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE SONS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE NOT SONS of men natural. THEY ARE SONS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; They have God's gene inside of them. THEY HAVE GOD'S GERM INSIDE of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They are the sons of God that God pick out from the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right in the face of the devil. &gt;&gt; God chose you RIGHT IN SATAN FACE. He pick you up right in your condition. He chose you BECAUSE WHO HE FOUND YOU. HE CALLED WHO HE CALLED SONS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HE called them for a purpose. He called you onto something. HE JUST DOESN'T JUST CALL YOU. He call YOU ONTO A PURPOSE. DON'T EVER LET THE DEVIL TAKE that out of your mind. YOU'RE NOT CALLED TO EXIST. YOU'RE NOT CALLED TO BEARING AND YOU'RE BEARING AND YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE CALLED FOR. YOU'RE CALLED FOR A PURPOSE. THAT PURPOSE MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Your life is no mishap. &gt;&gt; YOUR LIFE IS NO MISTAKE. WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH IS NOT BY CHANCE. BECAUSE WE KNOW IF THE DEVIL DON'T KNOW, WE KNOW SOMETHING THAT THE DEVIL DON'T KNOW. IF THE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW, WE KNOW SOMETHING. IF YOUR FAMILY KNOW, WE KNOW SOMETHING. WE KNOW ROMANS 8:28 THAT ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD TO THEM. WE KNOW THAT. &gt;&gt; IF NOBODY [screaming] ELSE KNOWS THAT, WE KNOW that [cheering] this happened, THAT HAPPENED. SO WHAT? WHERE'S THE BIG DEAL? WHERE'S THE BIG THING? GOD IS IN CHARGE. HE BROUGHT YOU ALL THE MARCLLAY. HE SET YOUR FEET ON A ROCK TO STAY. HE KEPT YOU ALL THESE YEARS. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN DEAD A LONG TIME AGO. YOU COULD BE A UP. YOU COULD BE BACKSTABBING. YOU COULD BE IN HELL A LONG TIME AGO. BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS. But the blood of Jesus this morning. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Are you going to love God and go in the bar? &gt;&gt; Your love for God will take you higher than the bar, higher than the cigarette, higher than parties and dance. Higher and fat, higher than fooling with women, higher than flirting. The love of God will take you above all of that is the love of God you're talking about. You you you can't pay for that. [cheering] &gt;&gt; What you're going to pay for the love of God, what you're going to pay for the blood of Jesus, God by his grace released his son. He came in the fullness of time. &gt;&gt; BORN OF A WOMAN, BORN UNDER THE LAW TO REDEEM them who WERE UNDER THE LAW. HE CAME JUST LIKE YOU TO FEEL FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH TO PUT ON YOUR SHOES AND WEAR YOUR CLOTHES TO REACH DOWN TO PICK YOU UP. &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN SERVE him with all your heart, mind, life, and soul. HERE, OH ISRAEL, THE LORD THY GOD IS ONE GOD. YOU LOVE HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART, MIND, AND SOUL. AND YOU can walk away from the things of the world. [applause] AMEN.

LOSING YOUR ROOF, LOSING YOUR CAR, WHATEVER. IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT CAN SEPARATE ME FROM THE LOVE OF GOD THAT'S IN CHRIST JESUS? [applause] One of the songwriter have a song. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. &gt;&gt; And you wasn't easy. &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy for Christ, but it was really worth it. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; For even the whole creation waits expectantly and longs earnestly for God's sons to be made known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's sons to be made known. The creation has grown for that. &gt;&gt; And God's sons couldn't be made known until we come down to the fullness of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's when the time promised &gt;&gt; for God's sons to be manifested. &gt;&gt; So you have seven church ages. But coming down now to the fullness of time, God promised to release a message that would bring the sons of God into position &gt;&gt; that he could adopt them and place them on the earth to give the whole devil one last death blow. &gt;&gt; Smoke in the devil face before we leave here. &gt;&gt; Going to lose this battle. You know, &gt;&gt; this battle already won. Are we going through the motion? God is not going to lose this battle. You know, it's almost 6,000 years he waiting for this showdown. It's going to be a showdown. A back to Eden showdown. We had one in Eden and this is Satan Eden. That was God's Eden and man fell in God's Eden and God bringing back a bride in Satan's Eden. This is the big showdown big time. This is the heavyweight championship. This is good versus evil. Light versus darkness. SONS OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. THE BRIDE of Christ versus praise God for whatever the devil have to offer. Oh, hallelujah. And and and and Daniel said, "The people that know their God shall be strong." &gt;&gt; And do great exploit. &gt;&gt; We couldn't know God in all the ages in that kind of a way because the mystery wasn't fully revealed. He was only UNFOLDING PART OF HIMSELF. BUT IN THIS LAST DAY, THE FULL THING IS COMING TO VIEW. &gt;&gt; THE FULL THING IS UNFOLDED. NOW WE KNOW WHO HE IS. NOW WE KNOW HIS NATURE. NOW WE KNOW HIS BEING. What he once accomplished. Oh, give the Lord praise his people. &gt;&gt; You don't NEED SOMEBODY SPOON FEEDING YOU ALL ALONG. YOU DON'T NEED THAT. PRAISE GOD. YOU GOT TO BE STRONG. THIS IS HARVEST TIME. PRAISE GOD. FEAST OF TABERNACLES, FEAST OF IN GATHERING. THIS IS A HARVEST OF WHAT YOU LABORED FOR, WHAT YOU PRESSED FOR SINCE ALL THESE YEARS. 7475. AND YOU'RE LOOKING TOWARDS GOD FOR A HARVEST OF THE SEEDS THAT YOUR SOUL THAT YOUR FAMILY WILL BE DELIVERED THAT YOUR LOVED ONES GOING TO COME FREE. WELL, THIS IS THE TIME.

Give God your highest praise. Especially amidst your trying circumstance, you got to demonstrate your faith is in him. &gt;&gt; My God. Your Red Sea in front of you, but your faith is in him because he's able to open up the Red Sea. Mountains on both sides, but your faith is in him. Don't want to budge and move and release the people, but your faith is in him. So, you're going to stay there till something happened. You will stay there until he say call for flies. You're going to stay there until he say call for frogs. You're going to stay there UNTIL HE CALLS FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAD TO CALL FOR. UNTIL they break the grips of fear. Pharaoh hands off God's people. And I'm telling you, I'm going to break the break the binding of Satan's hand upon your children, upon your loved ones, upon your family. That devil had to let them go. I don't care how b they are this morning. Praise God. They have to be loosed. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; So, PRAISE GOD. NOBODY TEARS AND CRYING. FORGET YOUR KITTENS. FORGET CRYING ABOUT IT. WE'RE going to speak and it going to happen just as God spoke it because God word can't return void. Whatever God said it must COME TO PASS. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? [applause] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE CAUGHT LIKE THOSE PHARISEES AND SCRIBES READING SCRIPTURE AND WHEN JESUS COME they couldn't handle it. Amen. &gt;&gt; YEARS IN THE BIBLE, YEARS IN A MESSAGE, AND WHEN THE SEASON CHANGED, WHEN THE SEASON TURNED AND IT WAS MANIFESTATION TIME, THEY COULDN'T DEAL WITH IT. &gt;&gt; THEY WANTED TO SIT DOWN THERE QUOTE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY ALL KNEW MESSIAH IS PROMISED. THEY ALL KNEW SEVEN THUNDER REVIVAL IS PROMISED. THEY ALL KNOW ABOUT BRIDE REVIVAL. THEY ALL KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET SAID THAT THERE WILL BE A MANIFESTATION OF THE SEVEN THUNDERS THAT PEOPLE WILL FLY FROM EVERYWHERE SAYING THE SEVEN THUNDERS WILL BE MANIFESTED. &gt;&gt; NOT TALKED, not taught but manifested. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.

HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; America is struggling with with a man in power and a position where they the question his character to hold office. &gt;&gt; How did he get there? &gt;&gt; God will not have that. &gt;&gt; God will not have a bunch of jokers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why the throne have gods. &gt;&gt; FIRE ALL AROUND THE THRONE. SARAH AROUND THE THRONE. THAT'S WHY HE SAID NO SCALING COULD JUST GO AND SIT ON THAT THRONE OR TAKE FROM THAT THRONE. YOU HAVE TO BE PRESENTED. FIRE HAVE TO COME OFFERING BY FIRE. FIRE HAVE TO TAKE A MAN INSIDE OF JAIL. FIRE HAVE TO TAKE A WOMAN INSIDE OF JAIL. [cheering] &gt;&gt; TALK IS TALK. BUT APPROACHING THAT THRONE, THAT'S DIFFERENT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The cleansers, the burners, the seraphs are there to cleanse the worshipper. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come to bring offering to God. &gt;&gt; You want to offer something to God. He said before you could even offer it. Go to your brother and make it right. &gt;&gt; Don't come and play offering. Offering and doing what? &gt;&gt; And you have against your say brother, what you doing with that ought? &gt;&gt; It's faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, and the top brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of forgiveness. That's the fullness. the seven steps. &gt;&gt; That's as far as you can go because the spirit is God himself to come down upon you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The spirit of God descending like a dove. &gt;&gt; You can't operate that. God does. &gt;&gt; But you could get up on the seventh step. &gt;&gt; And that seventh step is forgiveness. &gt;&gt; That seventh step is when you could drop yours and the whole grudge and EXCUSES AND BLAME SOMEBODY AND SOMEBODY AND SOMEBODY YOU'RE STILL AMEN down somewhere inside of there. You have to get OUT OF THAT. &gt;&gt; GET in the real spirit of forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Look at Jesus. He said, "Father, forgive them. They know not what they do. &gt;&gt; And they want to crucify him. Crucify him." But he was hard on that. &gt;&gt; He had cursed them. He had swear against them. He stood there and said, "Forgive them." &gt;&gt; They don't even know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; They don't know what they're killing. They don't know what they unfolding inside of there. Satan don't even know if Satan only understood. He was going to leave Jesus alone. But when he died, he shed his blood. He released a spirit. NOW WE ARE HERE. AND SATAN CAN HOLD US BACK. NOTHING, NOTHING, nothing but to stop the sons of God from coming forth in this hour. This is what the whole creation is groaning for. Not to have a nice church and NICE CHURCH MEMBERS AND SO ON AND SUIT AND TIE. THAT'S NOT WHAT THE CREATION GROANING FOR. OH, HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WE'RE GOING TO RIP THE VEIL OFF OF WHO HE IS. YOU'RE GOING TO see who he is. AND AS YOU'LL BEHOLD HIM, YOU'RE GOING TO become [applause] seated. One second. And the robe God seeing for seeing Elijah's day were numbered. He had so long he could stay here on earth so long as everybody has. &gt;&gt; God put boundaries you can't pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't worry. God know where to find everybody. &gt;&gt; That's a good one. &gt;&gt; Amen. go there knock on door. You know where he wants to live. &gt;&gt; No, when a man overcome his overcome. &gt;&gt; So he was going to have a success of Elijah. But when he did, God called this man. Listen, he wasn't in no se seminary when he called him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was plowing a field with a yolk of ox doing the service, taking care of his mother and father. God called him to be the successor of Elisha or Elijah. Perhaps many up at the school thought they were short to do, going to be his successor. They were going to wear his robe as soon as he was finished. But God does the calling. &gt;&gt; God does the choosing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God does the electing &gt;&gt; and God does the setting in order. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; God has set in the church some apostles, some prophets, some teachers, some evangelists and pastors. God does that himself. &gt;&gt; We cannot make one hair black or white. &gt;&gt; Neither can we add one thing to our stature by taking thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. God in his infinite grace and by his election and fornowledge sets these things in order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And every wheel works just right. &gt;&gt; I like that. I would be a discouraged man this morning if I didn't believe in the election and calling of God. IF I THOUGHT THAT THIS world was left to the outcome of it by the power of man and by the wisdom of man and by the United Nations who never even mentioned God's name, I'll be a discouraged person. But I'm not looking to that for the outcome. I look to the pages of this old book here &gt;&gt; where God wrote it out and everything will come just exactly the way he said it. &gt;&gt; So you're not looking for man for your outcome. You're not looking for uncle and auntie and tanty and this bishop and THIS MINISTER ASSOCIATION. YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR THAT FOR YOUR OUTCOME. YOU'RE LOOKING TO THE word &gt;&gt; for your outcome. &gt;&gt; Because once that word IS SPOKEN OVER YOU, nothing going to stop it. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus had to find that woman of the well. He had to find Batimus. HE HAD TO FIND PETER AND JOHN AND JAMES AND ALL OF THEM. HE HAD TO FIND THEM BECAUSE THEIR names was in that book. &gt;&gt; And every name on the book shall be, must be, have to be delivered. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Praise God. God not asking about your hair, your complexion, your height, your color, your race, where your country COME FROM, OR THE LANGUAGE YOU SPEAK. ALL YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE NAMES ON THE BOOK. THAT TIME, MICHAEL SHALL STAND UP AND EVERY NAME FOUND WRITTEN IN THAT BOOK. That's why the mighty angel came out with the book open in Revelation 10 TO CALL YOUR NAME. THE SEVEN THUNDERS IS WHAT CALLED YOUR NAME. THAT WAS CHRIST, YOUR HUSBAND. THAT WAS CHRIST YOUR HUSBAND. THAT'S YOUR HUSBAND. [cheering] &gt;&gt; REVELATION 10:1 IS YOUR HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; REVELATION 10:7 IS YOUR MESSENGER. &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. YOUR HUSBAND DROPPED DOWN IN REVELATION 10 TO CALL YOU WITH A SHOUT. IT WAS THE COVENANT ANGEL BECAUSE HE SWORE BY HIMSELF. WHAT DID HE SWEAR? THAT TIME SHALL BE NO LONGER. EVEN TIME ITSELF RUNS OUT. SO WE COME INTO THE fullness of time. WHEN TIME ITSELF RUNS OUT, THAT MEAN WE BREAKING INTO ETERNITY, breaking into the eighth day, BREAKING INTO A HOLY CONVOCATION. OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES, PEOPLE. TIME ITSELF IS ABOUT TO RUN OUT. &gt;&gt; SO, what are YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE? &gt;&gt; TIME is about to run out. &gt;&gt; Remember, it's only what you do for the kingdom is what counts. &gt;&gt; Not your selfish living. Living for your own self, your own pleasure. That ain't counting for nothing. That's your stinking rotten selfish being. We're not TALKING ABOUT THAT. PERFECT ETERNAL LIFE IS LIVING FOR OTHERS. &gt;&gt; NOT YOU SITTING ON YOUR rotten flesh living FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND THAT'S ALL. NO, YOU GOT TO GO HARDER THAN THAT. OH, GLORY to God. JESUS DIED FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD, KNOWING THAT SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET IT, that you're going to work it out, THAT YOU'RE GOING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS CALLING IS. &gt;&gt; I feel excited this morning. Don't wonder why Peter said, "Make your calling and election sure." Make a call sure. Make it sure God call me. God elected me. What the devil want to land on me? What the devil doing resting on me? What the devil doing binding on me. I have a calling of God. This what Samson understood. THAT'S WHY YOU could pray ONE SMALL ORDER. THIS WHAT DANIEL UNDERSTOOD. THAT'S WHY YOU COULD GO IN THE LION'S DEN. THIS WHAT THE HEBREW BOYS UNDERSTOOD. THEY HAD A CALLING OF GOD. AND IF THE AND SEED SHALL POSSESS THE KIDS OF THE ENEMY, THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT. SO THEY FACED THE LION AND LION. TO FACE THE FIERY FURNACE. Come on now. WHAT ARE YOU FACING? COME ON, MAN UP THIS MORNING. HALLELU UP THIS MORNING. WHAT ARE YOU CONFRONTING THIS MORNING? WHAT IS THAT GOLIATH [screaming] IN YOUR LIFE THIS MORNING? CONFRONT IT. [applause] &gt;&gt; GLORY. [applause] Catholic church they say prayersh &gt;&gt; but here you pray &gt;&gt; they're different some man write a prayer and you have to repeat that &gt;&gt; they choose the words to say &gt;&gt; and people saying that every morning &gt;&gt; and there's a pill want to hear is from your soul &gt;&gt; from your heart &gt;&gt; from your spirit &gt;&gt; have mercy upon me I'm not even worthy &gt;&gt; to be in that Oh God, deliver me. Oh God, set me free. Oh God, do something. I don't want to leave you the same way. I live with me long enough. I know me, Lord. I know me. I know me. I know me.

People back him up and people say, "You looking nice and looking good, but your soul not nice. Your spirit not nice. Your behavior not nice. Your front might be nice. Your face might be LOOKING NICE. YOUR DRESS MIGHT BE NICE. YOUR TIE MIGHT BE NICE, BUT YOU'RE NOT NICE. [applause] YOU MAY BE IN CHURCH AND YOU'RE ROTTEN AND YOU'RE DYING AND ALL THE THING THAT HAPPENED TO THE PAST FATHERS HAPPENED FOR OUR EXAMPLES UPON WHOM THE ENDS of the world are come and the ends OF THE WORLD ARE COME. &gt;&gt; IT IS NOW UPON US. &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES PEOPLE.

But when that fullness of time come, &gt;&gt; GOD TOLD NOAH, &gt;&gt; TAKE YOUR FAMILY &gt;&gt; INTO THE ARK. &gt;&gt; TAKE THE ANIMALS &gt;&gt; TWO BY TWO. MAYBE ANIMALS ARE SIGN OF WITNESS. THEY SEEN ANIMALS TREK INTO THE ARK TWO BY TWO. THEY HAD TO KNOW SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING. THEY GOT TO KNOW SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING THAT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; God get so vexed with man with his evil sodomite and and filthy ways. God regret he made man and everything else with the filthy living and everything else. But the Bible said Noah found grace &gt;&gt; in the eyes of the Lord. Not because he was taller, not because he was handsome, not because he was special, not because he had a degree, but he was elected. He was chosen of God. And if you understand that, you'll rejoice tonight just to know no man could come except the father draw him. Praise God. YOU LOST THIS. YOU LOST THAT. BUT YOU mustn't lose your God. Come on now.

YOUR BLESSINGS COULD BE DELAYED BUT NOT DENIED. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. IT COULD BE DELAYED BUT NOT DENIED. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU BELONG TO GOD, &gt;&gt; NOT SOME MAN. YOU BELONG TO GOD. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Your real mother and father is God.

But God put you through here through tear, what kind of struggle and poverty and what kind of struggle and the Bible say the poor have the gospel preached unto them. So you don't know why you're struggling. God struggling but but you but you are heir of the earth. You are heir of all things things seen and unseen. You just don't know who you are yet.

[applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; I don't know how I'm preaching this tonight. &gt;&gt; Are you reaching over yet? &gt;&gt; So, you're not looking for man for the outcome. are looking on the page of this old book where God wrote it out. Everything will come exactly the way he said it. And that's all. So the only thing we need to do is to line up with them, but not line up with them, but line up with Calvary. &gt;&gt; Line up with God. &gt;&gt; Line up with his word. Stay with his word. &gt;&gt; No matter how much it looks like it's going to be that way, it's going to be the way God intends it to be. &gt;&gt; It can't be nothing else. For him being infinite, know the end from the beginning. And he makes everything come to his praises. Everything come to give God praise &gt;&gt; and honor. My if that wouldn't take make the courage in a Christian, nothing can go wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's 10% saying amen. I heard you. &gt;&gt; I heard your silence &gt;&gt; on that one day. I heard it. I heard the silence. I didn't hear amen. You not hear the silence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing can go wrong. After all, it's not our Bible. It's his. It's not our wisdom. It is his. And the only one thing we have to do is to put our faith and trust there and sit still and see the glory of God and see how it moves around to its place and every wheel move in it. It may be scattered from side to side. It will move right into its place. When God speaks the word, he knew the end from the beginning. He knew who who he was going to choose. He knew Elisha would take Elijah place before the world was ever formed. Everything had to work exactly right. And we are worried about our loved ones and so forth. Will they ever come in? Their names, if they were written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world, they will work right in there. That's the only thing you could do. &gt;&gt; So that should free you from bing about your loved ones and understand if their name is there, Michael coming to deliver them. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises people. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The serpent grab Paul. &gt;&gt; I thought snakes not supposed to bite preachers. &gt;&gt; Serpent grab Paul. Now watch. Paul didn't fear because Jesus said they take up serpents. It shall not harm them. So he walked over here and shake him off in the fire. &gt;&gt; Turns out walk get some sticks and put back in the fire. &gt;&gt; He turned around, warm his back, turn around, warm his hands. The native said, "Why don't he die?" &gt;&gt; Why don't that man die? Because that particular snake when it bit you is some seconds and you're gone. &gt;&gt; So they watching him and they see him man dead proof. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Paul, here we go, WAS SO FULL of the Holy Ghost.

They put JOHN ON THE AISLE OF PATMOS IN a pot OF OIL AND HOT IT AND HE TRIED TO BOIL it out of HIM AND THEY STILL COULDN'T BOIL IT. WHEN THE FIRE WENT OUT AND THEY HAD NO MORE KNOW WHAT TO PUT. JOHN, STEP OUT THE OIL. YOU CAN'T BOIL OUT THE HOLY GHOST. You [screaming] can't roast the Holy Ghost. YOU CAN'T TOAST THE HOLY GHOST. YOU CAN'T BURN THE HOLY GHOST. YOU CAN'T KILL the Holy Ghost. YOU CAN'T OUT THE HOLY GHOST. YOU CAN'T POISON THE HOLY GHOST. FORGET THE LORD. AND THIS IS YOUR PROMISE. YOU [screaming] SHALL RECEIVE POWER &gt;&gt; AFTER THE Holy Ghost come upon you. Let's press for it. LET'S PRAY FOR IT. LET'S ASK FOR IT. LET'S BELIEVE FOR IT. [applause] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU READY &gt;&gt; FOR A PROMISE? &gt;&gt; ARE YOU READY &gt;&gt; FOR A PROPHECY? &gt;&gt; OH BROTHER, [screaming] &gt;&gt; GIVE ME A CHURCH &gt;&gt; FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST. GOD WILL DO IN ONE YEAR &gt;&gt; WHAT ALL THEOLOGY IS FAILED TO DO IN 2,000 YEARS. &gt;&gt; YOU WAIT TILL THE ANOINTING OF THE CHURCH STRIKE HOME &gt;&gt; TO THAT FAITHFUL LITTLE REMNANT. &gt;&gt; AFTER THE DOORS OF THE GENTILES IS CLOSED, &gt;&gt; GOD WILL ANOINT THE CHURCH. THEN &gt;&gt; A CHURCH FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST. PETER FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST. ANDREW FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST. STEVEN FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST. LISTEN, [applause] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; you may be seated. &gt;&gt; Paul had no car, you know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Paul had no Maxi or no taxi. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; No motorbike. &gt;&gt; Paul didn't a cold water. &gt;&gt; Paul had no Pepsi or Coke &gt;&gt; Sprite. &gt;&gt; He had no fast food. Kentucky. &gt;&gt; But he was full of &gt;&gt; ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus full of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Take take five loaves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Two fishes. &gt;&gt; Full of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Bless it. &gt;&gt; Tell the disciples, share it. &gt;&gt; And something happened. &gt;&gt; That was miraculous. &gt;&gt; You can't explain that. &gt;&gt; That's a paradox. &gt;&gt; Incredible, but true. It feed 5,000 people and had bread remaining. &gt;&gt; You you you didn't hear what your man say. &gt;&gt; Jesus full OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; WINE RUN OUT IN THE WEDDING. &gt;&gt; They come and ask him &gt;&gt; and tell him why out &gt;&gt; as if he he sell wine. &gt;&gt; And Jesus tell them go and draw water. &gt;&gt; Draw water. &gt;&gt; Not not go and get grapes. &gt;&gt; No. Go draw water. &gt;&gt; He don't need the grapes. &gt;&gt; HE BYPASSED THE PROCESS &gt;&gt; AND TURN THE WATER into wine. &gt;&gt; That's what we talking about. My God. My God. If this don't lift your faith, I don't know what is. &gt;&gt; If this don't raise up your faith, I don't know what is. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Full of THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; FULL OF THE Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Full of the Holy Ghost. Like a like a stuck inside here. You're going to be full of the Holy Ghost. Full. You can't overcome this. You're going to be full of the Holy Ghost. My God. You're going to beat THAT DEVIL AROUND AND FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST. PAUL, I KNOW. PETER, I KNOW YOU. I KNOW THE BRIDE. I KNOW BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST. [cheering] &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Now, this word was scattered through seven ages. &gt;&gt; And God had to send a message, &gt;&gt; seven angels &gt;&gt; to gather the scattered word &gt;&gt; to tie it back into the word &gt;&gt; to bring the entire Holy Ghost. And the prophet said the entire Holy Ghost has visited the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is what make Luke 17:30 &gt;&gt; the son of man &gt;&gt; in a son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ was veiling a prophet &gt;&gt; which is the Holy Ghost itself &gt;&gt; and he spoke out prophetic words, spirit spoken words to go and anoint a bride. &gt;&gt; So when you in Trinidad, YOU COULD BE WHEREVER THE WORD HAD TO FIND YOU. &gt;&gt; That's why you're in church today. &gt;&gt; Something inside of you is what the word connect with. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house &gt;&gt; because it's spirit given word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That means if that word going out, it means it going out to catch you &gt;&gt; to pull you in, &gt;&gt; to wheel you in. &gt;&gt; Because the word has you have to become the sons of God. &gt;&gt; That's what power was given for. That was the word was given for not to become a church member, &gt;&gt; but for you to be a reproduction of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So church supposed to be an avenue in which you get connect back to your God. &gt;&gt; It come like your cell phone activated. Church supposed to be a place where you get the activation then &gt;&gt; where you could CALL HIM FOR YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; NOT THROUGH some priest, &gt;&gt; not through some bishop, BUT YOU HAVE YOUR OWN LINE &gt;&gt; BACK TO YOUR FATHER. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SAY AMEN SOMEBODY. [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; But this part is incredible. &gt;&gt; After the doors of the Gentiles is closed, God will anoint a church. Then &gt;&gt; what does that mean? The doors of the Gentiles is closed. The Bible call the Jews the olive tree, olive branch. And God cut them off [snorts] to put this wild olive branch in &gt;&gt; called the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; And the Bible talk about the times of the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until the fullness of the Gentiles come in. &gt;&gt; So therefore, the Gentiles have a specific time. &gt;&gt; Not a specific time, but call it the fullness of the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Until the time of the Gentiles come in. So it means that when that time come in, not one more name person going to be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So don't wait for the door to shut &gt;&gt; because Noah had 120 years where people had an opportunity to receive it &gt;&gt; to receive the message. And then when God started to tell Noah, listen, time up. Your fullness of time has come. &gt;&gt; So start to get the animals in two by two. People see that and thought well you having a farm inside of there and whatnot. Making fun of Noah. &gt;&gt; But afterwards God shut the door. Amen. &gt;&gt; Seven days a sat &gt;&gt; preaching to doomed people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ark sat preaching to people who could not be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Would that repeat again? Yes. &gt;&gt; In church. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People have to come to church and hear it and can't be saved. &gt;&gt; Because they already reject it. &gt;&gt; You mean those people that act was preaching to know for no? Yes. For seven days &gt;&gt; until the rain start to fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. THEN PEOPLE SAY, "NOAH, NOAH, I I SEE IT NOW." &gt;&gt; But the only problem is Noah didn't shut the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God did. &gt;&gt; And what God door, God shut, &gt;&gt; no man &gt;&gt; could open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what God door man God opened, no man could shut. &gt;&gt; So when God shut the door, the door is shut. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. So while you have a chance to make things right, while you have a chance to be reconciled to God, &gt;&gt; please do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I couldn't wait for my family to serve the Lord. You know, &gt;&gt; that was a personal choice. &gt;&gt; That's I choose that. &gt;&gt; I choose this is the harder way. This is our way. Easy to smoke and drink and run around. But it this is the harder way. &gt;&gt; This is Christian soldier. &gt;&gt; This is not natural soldier. This is Christian soldier &gt;&gt; where your your life is bare before all. A Christian life is a public life, you know. &gt;&gt; Oh, it was a private life. No, it's a public life. &gt;&gt; It's a public life. It's a public testimony. Not you living private. You're a Christian. I want everybody to know him. &gt;&gt; You're not a Christian. &gt;&gt; You might be impersonating. A Christian is a public servant. &gt;&gt; That's why God say take the blood and put it in your door post. &gt;&gt; Don't put it behind the door. Well, I ain't like how it looking. The color not blending. No, it don't have that. You know, detach will take you out. &gt;&gt; Put it on your doorpost &gt;&gt; because you want to see it. &gt;&gt; Your neighbors could see it. Anybody walk and see blood, blood, no blood, no blood, no blood, blood, blood, blood. Everybody could see it. &gt;&gt; That's how God want your testimony &gt;&gt; on your job, your brokers to see it. [applause] &gt;&gt; After the doors of the Gentiles closed, God will anoint the church. He who is filthy be filthy still. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's righteous, righteous still. &gt;&gt; He is holy. Let him be holy still. God will anoint the church with the power of God and things will be taking place. &gt;&gt; Not only then, that's prophecy. He's doing it now. That was William Brham &gt;&gt; recognizing his message. But Abraham says now the church has not recognized a day like Israel back in her home Palestine. She's going to be forced into work out the churches. Why? She didn't recognize her hour. He said, "Let him that filthy be filthy still. Let him that holy be holy still." Now, above a woman, she can't be. Because God said, "Woman, don't cut your hair." &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; He said, "Above your woman, she can't be." Now, that sounds very flat. That's the scripture. The Bible says she dishonor her head. Her head is a husband. His head is Christ. So, she dishonors Christ. How can she be dishonorable and not be filthy? Let that got bo here, let her keep it. So in other words, when that time come, it sets your condition. &gt;&gt; It's like a snapshot that snaps you and that's your picture. &gt;&gt; You can't change it. &gt;&gt; That's what that means. &gt;&gt; So the time for change is now. [applause] &gt;&gt; You must want change. &gt;&gt; You must desire transformation. &gt;&gt; You must hate yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; You must want God's will. &gt;&gt; You have to ask God. You want a revelation of his will for your life. &gt;&gt; You can't JUST GO TO A DRIFT, YOU KNOW, &gt;&gt; like a driftwood. Let the stream of life just take you. The current carrier wherever it hit, wherever it bounce, just a stream of life and you go in with life. Everybody's doing that. But that same driftwood could be carved out into a boat and put a power of an engine to power it, to guide it, to direct it. &gt;&gt; This is what you want, &gt;&gt; you don't want to be drifting &gt;&gt; because if you drift, you'll head towards the falls. &gt;&gt; I want to say if you drift, you will head towards the falls. &gt;&gt; Don't drift. Let your wife be guided. &gt;&gt; Let your life be directed by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. She that wear shorts, &gt;&gt; keep on wearing them. &gt;&gt; Let he that denies the word keep on denying it. You cannot change. Fixed condition, you will not be able to change. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. But let him that holy be holy still. &gt;&gt; Let him that righteous be righteous still. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Like Israel back in the homeland, national force put Israel in the home, national force put Israel in the homeland. National force will put the work of the churches. But the power of God will put the people in the bride. &gt;&gt; That's why I love that song, oh Lord, send the power just now. &gt;&gt; Baptize everyone. &gt;&gt; Many people ask, "Will the bride, will this, will this?" What the bride is the elected of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Period. &gt;&gt; So nobody could own the bride and said, "Oh, what church have the bride?" &gt;&gt; That's not the word. &gt;&gt; The bride is the &gt;&gt; elected of God. &gt;&gt; Elected of God. The church goes through. That's the one who says whosoever will let him come. &gt;&gt; But the bride is elected of God. &gt;&gt; So you don't want to be part of whosoever will. Why come? Because whosoever will come. I hear that. No. Be the elected. &gt;&gt; Be the bride. That's what you must desire to be. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Watch. There are five. Oh, let's skip that. Praise God. But each night we want every person that's not a Christian hope something will be said or done that you'll become a Christian. And if you're not and if you have already believed in the Lord Jesus and accepted him and been baptized and you haven't received the Holy Ghost as yet, don't let this get by. Let this be your night. Remember, here we go. Remember, there will be just so many names on that book. And when the last name is added, that's all of it. Yours might complete it. &gt;&gt; Let's go a little further. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. When the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne, that was the book of redemption. &gt;&gt; Those names was put in there before the foundation of the world. And when that last name was called the book, the plan, everything else was revealed. Then the seven seals was opened by the lamb. The mystery of the whole Bible was hidden there. And the last name that goes on the book, then he changes a little bit. or the last name that's redeemed that was put on that book.
