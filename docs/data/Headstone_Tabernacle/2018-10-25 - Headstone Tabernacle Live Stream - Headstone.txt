people touch this country Lord and minister to Lord a different situation and the needs Lord no matter Lord what state the people are in it is not a good thing to see it's a sad thing to see so we pray that you would touch each one and Lord may you be with each one and through this time a people begin to search for you as I've never searched before mainly begins a hunger and thirst after righteousness me something in their soul stood that Lord a job cannot give them and money cannot give them and the comfort of what we are used to cannot give but maybe holes are your changing hands being conscious that you are the anchor Lord in the midst of the storm father may you be with each one in the precious name of Jesus Christ from the church says a man any man I greet you tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ if you have your Bibles would you tell it me so just one portion of scripture reading from 2nd Peter 1 and reading from this is one to 10 second Peter 1 reading from verses 1 to 10 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and I was Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power have given unto us His divine power half is past tense given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by V Z may be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this given all diligence add to your feet which and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things he shall never for me the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated tonight and the precious name of the Lord it's certainly a great privilege and honor to be in the house of the Lord tonight and it was tragic that we could not be here last Sunday because of the flood and you know the Prophet said one day you know there'll be a last service you know if you're asked us a week before if we miss service last Sunday it will not be on our calendars or expectations for most of us we would have expected to be in church and just like that overnight situations could change overnight what you expect could change and you know leading up to those days I remember Thursday the weather started a change and the waters level starting to rise and some companies were already sending people home early and then you know I remember being in a conversation because the evening saying you know if this if this read continues by tomorrow we're looking like we in some trouble by Friday true to form what would normally take ten minutes of driving was 45 minutes but nobody expected to see the highway covered to see Trinity impossible II mean really impossible and then Karen E Brooke it's bankin and to see what happened and and I mean it is such a sad thing that there were people who did not even make it home and they then come the days afterwards and see what was left of their home you know and it's something else when you hear the stories it's one thing to work look for years to get something and to see overnight as it will you don't have much to show anymore because nature has has taken its course and then we realize that all of our efforts are subject to at times what nature does our nature you know I've seen many people from gangsters to you name it when the quakes and floods come and all of a sudden it's not about that anymore you know because it's a realization that's that you can stop the flood you know when the water comes you can just push it back when the earthquake comes it is it is doing what nature does the Bible says the whole creation is groaning and shifting and moving and crying out for the manifestation of the sons of God so it's a reminder that this world is do for change it's a reminder to us that this place we call home is it's not our home until fire strikes is lit and where the random speaks of fire I will take out the atmosphere and every devil every team on every power to give us a new earth to give us a new place that we can now walk on as the sons of God redeemed that is this is do for redemption our bodies do for redemption nature is do for redemption can the church say Amen so we are grateful tonight to be in the house of praise to being a house of worship where we can gather looking for the demon will leave this place we are not gathering in church just to have church but we are gathering to prepare to leave this place we are gathering to prepare to leave this world to go to meet our brothers and sisters who have gone on before who are cheering us on seeing you got to make it these do those who have gone before without us cannot be made perfect so brother Branham is waiting on you and I everyone who has gone before is waiting on you and I to come to perfection to bring on the resurrection so fear not little flock it is the father's pleasure to give you the kingdom so I salute your feet tonight to be here tonight doors that are connected on the internet I salute you as well may the same anointing that said tonight minister to you in your homes and may God richly bless you so I have a little thought tonight and it's around that - it's two natures I want to speak about two natures this morning this evening rather and I was this thought came to me a little while back and originally I was thinking about two men in one body I said that might just be too much tightly two men in one body so I spoke up the two nature's because I was thinking I'm by the ground spoke about it you see when you if you look at me now and you look at how I was here so cool somebody could see this is a different person but it's the same body but it's a different person so I said if there are two men is one body you still seeing dr. Michael Williams but the mic already seen now he's not acting like the one who was here two years ago 10 years ago 15 years ago so it's like somebody else is the same body right now but there's somebody else living in that buddy hallelujah the person I used to know I don't see him no more the person was silently pestered and want you to go on dream to get their troubles away it's the same body but he doesn't need that alcohol hormone he doesn't need to party no more it's like another person that same buddy it's two men in one body but we want to speak about two nature's that's how the Prophet puts it the two nature's kind of cheats amen I'm brother branham said you've got to chew aside your senses god never gave you those senses to trust him with God give you his spirit to trust in your senses or two contacts ETS feel smell on here but you yourself is that spirit that lives in you and when that's been regenerated old man died so there comes a point where the old man in this same body has got to die and there's a new man in this body with a different appetite the old man has a certain kind of appetite but when the new man comes alive this new man wants to eat a different kind of food it's the old man used to enjoy a certain fooled by the new man he has a new appetite the old man you say enjoy going certain places but when that old man is dead and the new man comes alive it looks like the same person you might use the same tone of voice I like the old person but the words are bit different somebody say man and when that's been regenerated and the old man tired and the new man born again that is a part of kardam then you become a son of God and offspring of the Creator then you can't believe the impossible things so until that old man is dead and dying it's impossible for you to believe you possible things but when that old man is dead know all things are possible to them that believe and people cannot understand it because the thing you're talking to you but I'm not talking to you there's a change that takes place a different nature has taken hold of you the things that troubled you before you don't trouble you no more and people can't understand it why you worship but it's a change that has taken place and a change is taking place and when that change gets a hole in your soul because it is a process it's not an immediate overnight transformation but it's a war of two natures that's going on inside of you because when Ibrahim said you were born and sin and you're born with a certain nature but as you come to church and as you get the word up and as you feel the anointing but the Branham said it this means it is a spark inside of you now when you were born you didn't realize that you had that spark in there but when you come into contact with the Holy Spirit and you come in contact with one another there's an anointing that begins to speak to you and you realize there's something else in there when you were in the world there was always something else in there when you were doing what you were doing it was something else in there another nature and God sent His Prophet he send the scripture and he sent messengers and he sent features and he has services and somebody invited you out up because it was a nature in you a deep call into a deep but the pound said is like that mama eager and that mama ego call when that ego called something in your heart spoke to you that's why even when you fall now and you make mistakes now when you come to the house of God there's a party you don't know that you know that you know that no weapon formed against you no mistake no child no formal up second nothing past nothing present nothing to come nor demon of condemnation nor demon up town you can lose everything but you're not gonna lose your joy because in your soul is a serum that you did not put here you did not plant it here you're not responsible for it and you not even know want to keep it up because that Sheila says one and he has obligated to keep his word his word can avail his word penalize his word must come to pass to the seed in your soul has got to come to pass that nature that is a part of God could only produce itself the carnal nature could only produce itself but the seed of the world could only produce itself and when that word is watered by the Spirit of God in the atmosphere of God that she'll cut only upon that seed of a top you add to your faith virtue and you add to virtue knowledge of and you add to knowledge temperance and patience and colonist and brotherly kindness and charity itself by these precious promises we become partakers of His divine nature we become partakers of the fullness of his nature because all that God was up he poured into Christ and all that Christ was that is He pours into the church in the form of his holy spirit up to bring to pass that which was spoken throughout all the Scriptures come the church teaming two men one body two natures I'm everyday when you struggle in your up and down right up up well what's really going on is the two nature's at war when you get inside an argument when you get the best situation when you get frustrated there's a war going on up because you know you have your ups and downs you know you're not in the mountain all the time you know things aren't peachy all the time and when you have your valleys and you have your mountains it's a war that's going on and sometimes one nature wins over and sometimes the other nature wins over it's a temporary transition it's a business of permanence of nature but one of these days one of these days the other nature the new nature will take complete control and by the Pelham says that all man dies take the old man off of the resuscitator take the old man off of life support tonight take the old man off of life support tonight we want the old man today we want the old man to disappear we want to bury the old man we want to bury the lion we want to bury the backbiting we want to bury the jealousy we want to bury the envy you want to bury the gossip in we want to bury the backslide and we want to bury the demon of lust I listen if it's dead and buried they can never come back [Music] hallelujah hallelujah but a shaker to give me back some more volume hallelujah if it's dead it could never come back you could never raise it back up that cannot be resurrected but the seed of the would in you that seed could never die and he says because I live you are gonna live also come to church him before we had Abraham we had Abram same buddy his height didn't change the way his shoulders looked didn't change his facial features didn't change his walk didn't change they called him Abram all his life but when he met God by the Tarrance God gave him a change of nature a change of perspective he left his home he left his way of life he left his family and God confirmed his change by saying don't call yourself Abram anymore call yourself Abraham people who grew up with him seeing why you're moving different why you're talking different why you're acting different but it's the same you that's what the world sees it's a seam you it looks like to CMU but it's a different nature there's a different controller all of a sudden your attitude is different can the church say man we said it before Jacob all his life everybody call him Jacob but inside of Jacob was Israel he didn't even know that inside of him was Israel he lived his whole life thinking he was going to remain Jacob he lived his whole life thinking the way he was born was the way he was gonna die he lived his whole life thinking the name that he was called when he started was the name he was gonna be called when he finished but when he met the angel of the Lord and he was in the mean something came over him and the Bible said he wrestled all night long and a mortal man held an angel until the injured let me go please and this man called Jacob said I'm not gonna let you go until you bless me and the Bible said that angel had to give him something to go and the Bible said he enjoyed touch the hollow of his type it's not right and that man called cheek I've had a new walk still look like Jacob here and a new talk still looks like Jacob he but he now had a new name and we said it before you cannot charge that man with the offence of the other man if you have a warrant out for Jacob's arrest Jacob no longer exists because he's now Israel and when God gives you a change of nature the devil cannot hold you accountable for the sins of the old man [Applause] you may be seated I think in the Lord has something called double jeopardy if you convict a man or something you can come and charge somebody else for the same thing because somebody already could beat if anything I'm at the lawyer but if you charge Israel ready charge and Israel no longer dare to take if it's at Jacob rather will you charge and the charges on Jacob when is your coming a car charging did you charge Jacob my name is aja and when God calls you by name because you are promised a new name unto Him and over comment the devil come in looking for you all you and no I have something on him you say I don't know who you're talking about but that's the old me go look for him if you find him you could charge him but the person inside of this house is a different person the drunken you looking for if they can find him that's all right but still as far as I know he's dead but if you can find it that's right but it's a new man inside this house and brother Branham said when this new man comes this is the spirit man there's a new body also that's waited to receive this new spirit that's in this body because the soul is the nature of the spirit and there's a new body weight you that's why sickness should never depress you tiredness should never depress you because there's a new body waiting for you but there has to be a change of your nature there has to be a change of your Walker there has to be a change of your talk can the same for all of his life he was Simon the old man was the fisherman the old man was the casa the old man was all kind of stuff but I want you to understand something even when he got a revelation and Jesus had to walk Peter when his nature was only finally changed in the upper room but when his nature was changed in the upper room the fear he had in the old man disappeared before the change of his nature this same man if you saw him he was gonna look frightened he was afraid to testify but he found said they were scared but when his nature change where the handi he walked out right into the streets where the Branum said i said these men are not drunk as you suppose but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel and the last is appalled by spirit upon all flesh think it not strange they looked at Jesus he is not this Joseph's son but we watch him grow up it's not this Joseph's son so what do you think the world is saying what do you think the devil is saying that's what he never knew about Jesus little that's why his if thou be because he tried to figure him out and through your daily world if they were trying to figure you out if don't be but the same way Jesus was on the mystery and he did not reveal who he was to him because he was the devil no explanation you'd have to explain why you worship the devil you don't have to explain why you're in church to the devil you don't have to explain why you believe here you have no explanation to the devil because you are confident in who you are you are confident in your purpose you are confident in the words seen in your soul so you walk boldly to the throne of grace and every time the devil shows something at you you shake it off and you walk forward because it's a nature in you that knows where it comes from that knows where it's going that knows these things can the church same look at Saul he persecuted the Christian this is a hard one because the Bible says when Saul became poor that the believers it wasn't easy women could imagine Berlin as a brother who was pleased to get a nice easy one who kills even but it had to take note that that is not the same man he might look the same he might smile the same he might walk the same with a different nature and when there's a different niche in there you have to look beyond the physical because as a change taking place but there Branham said every time you come to Childress a change taking place that is invisible to the naked eye and as you don't know what God is doing in someone's life so you can't judge anybody because you don't know what God is doing on the inside oh can the church say man I remember by the mic even by the mic he first came the church can I talk about you brother remember the mic he first came is just my Musa you can't even remember remember the mic he had as his dreadlocks and stuff and I remember preaching I was a young boy then see him but Mike he's coming to service and he's just coming and he's listening and he's watching and without anybody having to tell him anything one day he came and he didn't even recognize him anymore because he cut his here because something it was not somebody said this is the rule but the would begin to speak to a nature that he didn't know but it was pulling all at pulling all the time pulling and then he broke ours and when you broke up you cannot put a bullet back in my egg when in brick so it kind of anymore the fact that it broke out of the egg meant it got too big it got uncomfortable and that closed way of living and when you born in sin and iniquity it's a closed way of living it's a lot of pressure when you're living in sin it's a lotta pressure when you're doing who you are but when you begin to know who you are and know that there's joy unspeakable and full of glory hallelujah my brother here spoke to the young people a couple of weeks ago and he says somebody I'd say more Tonica ticket he said I want to know what time it got taken he said he all time tronic you see a cop Biden stomach in this store this time I have real joy this tonic have real peace and when you get this tonic it makes you feel young it makes you smile it makes you laugh it makes you happy whenever don't move me to take more of this tonic but you know you could get more and there's more and there's more it's an inexhaustible fountain this supply is everlasting and you do need to pay for it because it belongs to you can the church shame and so what are we talking about when I talk about dying to the old nature dying to the old man you see it would listen to the Prophet he said it would have been natural to me to drink my daddy drank it would have been natural for me to use tobacco my daddy did my generation behind me some said why didn't you never smoke or drink he said when I was a lad before I started in today the Holies heard him down and said don't you do it he said there is the conversion you see in the beginning and went way back before that the morning I was born but about I'm going back to how the nature in him that he didn't even know was there oh he said I was born into a family I could have been just like them but something got ahold of me something arrested me something locked me up can the church say man I want to talk about Moses a little bit but I'm animus speaking he said when he walked up reverently took off his shoes go out told him said I've seen the affliction of my people I've heard their groans and moans and I'm coming down to deliver them and I want you the one that made a failure 40 years ago I want you to go right back hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord grab back and backtrack yourself I'm selling you right on all Moses said I can't talk very good Lord said I'm kind of slowest Peter just can't do it he said who made the Mount of man and he began to really cool coal Moses don't and that's the way God does brother he shakes you down to have to build up again and that's the way the people that they you don't like to get broke up that's why I said take the old man off of the resuscitator take him off of life support on a week in my company cuz once the old man is accessible that's what Peter did Jesus died Peter said let me go back fishing went back straight back fine back his body that he had left another way any boat because the last time we saw a pizza and the boat and efficient is when he got him Donets broke and he jesus said come follow me he left it it was fishes there was body and he abandoned the ship soon Jesus then he went back and find whatever he had abandoned and many times with us the moment things go wrong we go back to the old nature you can understand back but when Peter maybe up Aroon the old man died there was nothing to go back to and I was sharing with someone the a few days ago about when he panniers entered into Mexico many ships had left from Europe to come into the Americas and everyone had filled you know the story and forgot his name now anybody remember Cortes when Cortez landed on the shore of Mexico without telling everybody he told him when the men go to sleep burn the ships this was his secret strategy see under ships and around if it's 2:00 in the morning the ship start building and everybody run out stream and he even Cortez alone come by they escaped many ships by baby ships moving but that morning after the dust settles Cortez truly man you see what fellas we can't go back we can't go back there's no turning back we have to go forward and be able to rebuild a ship but to rebuild his ship we need to take the land and those men closed off the back door of going back into their past and you see when you have a back-up plan in your mind you never give a hundred percent effort to go in forward that's why having a fallback is a problem for a lot of people because you fall back restricts your ability to put a hundred percent of your effort I'm going forward so when you have a fallback I see whether this is still my friend you know that person is trouble but you know when I can find my brother I'll call back this friend that's what truly people delete the numbers and block the numbers because if you go back there you're you you cannot get in trouble if you leave them alone but when you cut off that nature cutter I said listen I'm not going back to speed I have to go forward I'm not going back in your world you could take the whole world but give me Jesus I'm not going back there you have to make up your mind you're not going back there can the church say man that's the way the people eat eat all I think it broke up you got to be broke up before you can be remade the Prophet went down to the potter's house to get broke up to get in the wheel and spun out something different if you're a sinner get on the wheel God will break you up mold you different shape your life up different shape your home life different can the church name him and notice that I'm Musa said Lord I can go but God was determined that he was going and God is he tell me tonight that you are gonna make it and he said Moses you must go and he said show me your glory Lord and notice God told Moses was that in your hand he said it's a stick of a rug just an old dry stick of the desert where he had walked along with this in his hand that maybe all that he had was his stick and maybe you haven't got that much this is the profit speaking but whatever you got give it to God look what he did with that sick and that was the same kind of a pole at the serpent it was made out here was made in a wilderness representing Christ he true it down and return it to sneak Judgment already passed judgment the serpent from the Garden of Eden already judged picked it up by the tail and had become again a stick put his hand in his bosom to leprosy took it out put it back and again and it was clean when he took it out again then surely he had wanted to seek God's glory divine healing is included in the glory of God heal them another thing showing that the heart is deceitful full of leprosy and the hand that sways the power God's power rod has to be clean me divinely clean and he put his hand in his bosom it was healed with leprosy took it out and he could heal that stick of it again then he's seen his glory after he's seen his glory he didn't care how many critics or anything else he was on his way to Egypt and any man or any woman not standing all from a critical condition but will accept the unadulterated Word of God and believe it in your heart all the devils out of hell can't upset you then certainly not can the church say man Oh hallelujah Oh glory glory and glory I'm Arab and I went to see Moses with a changed man not with all of his education his money give him not with all the education the military geniuses that he has a pharaoh have trained him to be and Moses took a great choice Moses said and steam the reproach of Christ greater treasures than that of Egypt can the church say man what you need today is the come face to face with the fact and be born again with an old-time Holy Ghost experience like they had back in the Bible days again and accept Jesus Christ as they did then a vision of that will change your whole being my brother my sis make you a different person be born again see the vision of the Lord where God appears the signs of God a change man he got a new vision keep him out of Egypt you couldn't do it if you had to but if enemy said he was scared before the encounter he was scared of all the Egyptians because he was wanted for murder but now try to stop him he got close to God he'd seen an angel a vision had come before him he had a warmed up to the fire of God he got his hot warm when he was standing there he had seen some miracles and supernatural things the people was going to disbelieve him but God had been with him oh you might be a little coward grocery man or a doctor or a lawyer whatever you was set back in the corner joining some church or something I'm thinking you all right but you get into the presence of Almighty God someday where the power and fire of quarters are falling you'll be a different person you'll tell your doctor friends that Jesus Christ lives and reigns of you will tell every person that comes into your grocery you will tell your clients as a lawyer or whatever it is that Jesus Christ is raised from the dead and he's the same yesterday today and forever but you can't do it standing looking at it you have got to get into it give it yourself personally notice he's a new man how he goes know how the world will could decide you when you do this don't expect a flower bed of either God so the Moses who left Egypt who left scared that's not the Moses who went back he look the same way and I made this look a bit more tired but when you spoke to Pharaoh Hiro recognize this is a little different manner what he did in front of here or Cairo recognized something at changing his life and one of these days a change is gonna come over you a chain that your family will see a change your co-workers will see a change that your boss will see a change that your neighbor will see and when that change take place the devil can ever he could never twist you around anymore because it's a change on the inside instead of outside that I put on it's not a show is that you trying to be nice up but it's from the heart so you can't help but sweet good things you can't help but live like Christ because Christ is living inside of you Oh blessed be the name of the Lord everybody feeling fine and I was seeing is the proper to speak in here this isn't a message communion this is December the 12th 1965 this is a few days brother kangri before the prophet leaves December the 12th 1965 so brother Branham is reflecting he said I was seeing this tinging for myself so the problem is pondering like he was gonna say William Branham well 40 years ago the William Branham isn't the same one tonight if somebody back there would say William Branham he was a Wrangler rascal see because I was born of Charles and Ella Branham in their nature I was a sinner I come to the world a liar and all the habits of the world lead right in me but down in there too was another nature present prophet it was that he was born that he was born wholly no he said I was born a ransom I was born to a normal family I was born to Hakeem into the world a lie and all the habits but down India - it was another nature present and that's the nuclear weapon that the devil has to watch out for because inside of every one of you tonight there's another nature oh I'm friends you don't even know how powerful it is you don't even know that even how powerful it is friends see but down in there was another meteor present see predestinated wasn't there by God in his same body see two nature's in their place in the world he said well I only cater to one as it grew die good as a baby panda this is the first thing you know I become a liar become everything else as a sinner because I was raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of life all the time whenever I said you see room as a little boy sharing some little not good before he leaves I hope I'm not hauling you too long this is the prophet speaking sitting on the creek back in that city and look around at night time pop and mom they've gone on now today arrest and them days they were sinners there was no Christianity in our homes at all I want you to listen young people it's not a brother branham grew up in a Christian home with her with a pray altar but a band said there was no Christianity in our homes at all all my drinking and parties and carrying and on it made me sick so that nature it was a merry or the media was getting disturbed by it he said I take my lantern and my dog and go to the woods to stay all night so that nature in him was taking him away from the parties his family was having at the house can the church say Amen it made me sick he said in the wintertime had haunted the party was over so the Prophet this is where it starts took up hunting with a cannula to get away from the party in the house maybe daylight in the morning come home wouldn't be over idly on top of a shed and sleep waiting for daylight to bring us a little boy can the church shame him and then I think of how that time that being out there in the summer time get my sticks and put them down for the little windbreak where if it rained lately and have the pools taking underwater fishing my old dog laying there I said look here you know the last winter come true here one night I built a fire right here when I was waiting for my old dog here to tree and I had a fire there it froze five inches deep in the ground but little floor where did you come from see well where did you come out from who come out here and planted you and what hothouse did they bring you out of or what about it where you come from see the little flower at see why I was froze and everything and I built a fire on top here besides the freezing element there was a heat element so the property's beginning the type right this we seen it's frozen over there should be no life who put the tree there but he said beside the freezing element they had to be some heat element to keep this tree alive to keep this flow alive and he's tapping it in the midst of the nature of your life there's a heat element in the midst of the winter of your life there's a heat element that's burning and no matter how you cover it up that heat element is still burning your child might be in trouble right now but there's another nature that's there that's still burning don't give up on your children tonight what was it there was another William Branham see that's a prophet see a little spot of eternal life down there the genes of God the Word of God I was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things see it's working can't you say man I mean all at once I looked and I said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham there's something calling like my little eager I'm not a chicken there's something I'll be honest somewhere or great Jehovah whoever you are open up I want to come home there's something in me calling then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow know that all life was forgiven put in the sea of forgetfulness to never be remembering and no more ceased and justified as though we never had sinned in the presence of God can the church say man oh I'm about finished tonight there's a short exhortation of these two natures may God bless you and open your eyes to keep that all nature TYIN we need to kill that all nature and let the newness of life he promised to give us a new heart to give us a new spirit and to put his spirit in there to take complete control of the
