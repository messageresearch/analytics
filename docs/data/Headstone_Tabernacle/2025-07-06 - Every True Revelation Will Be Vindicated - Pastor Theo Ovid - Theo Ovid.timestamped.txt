[48:42] and not pain. Oh, teach me Lord.
[48:48] Oh, teach me Lord
[48:51] to wait. Now give him praise while the
[48:55] music plays this morning.
[48:59] I'm here to wait on you, Lord.

[49:06] Wait on his presence this morning.
[49:09] Wait on his goodness. Wait on his mercy.

[51:22] me to be.
[51:25] Oh, he that wait my Lord, my Lord,

[51:58] Hallelujah. Run and not f my Lord. Teach
[52:04] me Lord.
[52:06] Teach me Lord
[52:09] to me.
[52:12] Father, we thank you this morning. We
[52:14] thank you for your presence. We worship
[52:16] you, Father. We glorify your wonderful
[52:18] name. Have your own way in our midst. In
[52:21] Jesus name, I ask. Let's bow our heads
[52:22] with a prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank
[52:24] you for your divine presence and the
[52:26] uncction that you've released among us
[52:27] tonight. That Lord, you could have the
[52:29] preeminence. We invite you to have the
[52:31] oversight and lead us and guide us as we
[52:34] wait upon you and look to you. In Jesus
[52:37] name I ask it. Amen. And amen. God bless
[52:40] you. Uh
[52:42] before you take a seat, I'd like you to
[52:45] turn your Bibles to three portion of
[52:47] scripture.
[52:52] Genesis chapter 1, we want to read verse
[52:53] 26 and 27.
[52:57] John chapter 17 8-11
[53:00] and Revelation 10 1-4.
[53:03] Read in Genesis 1 verse 26. And God
[53:06] said, "Let us make man in our image,
[53:08] after all likeness. Let them have
[53:10] dominion over the fish of the sea, over
[53:12] the fowl of the air, over the cattle,
[53:14] over all the earth, and over every
[53:16] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[53:18] earth." So God created man in his own
[53:20] image, in the image of God created he
[53:23] him, male and female created he them.
[53:26] From St. John chapter 17, Jesus speaks
[53:30] from verse eight. For I have given unto
[53:33] them the words which thou givest me, and
[53:37] they have received them, and have known
[53:39] surely that I came out from thee, and
[53:42] they have believed that thou did sent
[53:44] me. I pray for them. I pray not for the
[53:48] world, but for them which thou has given
[53:50] me, for they are dine, and all mine are
[53:54] dine, and thine are mine, and I am
[53:57] glorified in them. And now I am no more
[54:01] in the world, but these are in the
[54:03] world. I come to thee, holy father, keep
[54:06] through thy own name those whom thou has
[54:10] given me that they may be one as we are.
[54:15] I read from Revelation 10:1. It reads, I
[54:18] saw another mighty angel come down from
[54:19] heaven, clothe a cloud, a rainbow upon
[54:22] his head, his face as the word is sun,
[54:24] his feet as spilled as a fire. He had in
[54:26] his hand a little book open. He set his
[54:28] right foot upon the sea, his left foot
[54:31] upon the earth, cry with a loud voice as
[54:33] when the land roared. And when he had
[54:35] cried, seven thunders uttered their
[54:37] voices. And when the seven thunders
[54:39] uttered their voices, I was about to
[54:41] write and I heard a voice from heaven
[54:43] saying to me, seed up those things which
[54:44] the seven thunders uttered and write
[54:46] them not. Let us pray. Father, we thank
[54:48] you for your word. Any man could read
[54:50] scriptures, but it take the Holy Spirit
[54:51] to come and breathe life into it and
[54:53] most importantly to bring life to the
[54:55] people. We are such a needy people this
[54:57] morning. We are dependent upon you. We
[54:59] are looking to you. Come father even
[55:01] come in our midst. You promised Lord
[55:03] that you would slipping him moving in
[55:05] and out. May you move in tonight. Move
[55:08] in today. In Jesus name may we ask it.
[55:10] Amen and amen. You may be seated. God
[55:12] bless you and welcome to you. Come
[55:14] father even come in our midst. You
[55:16] promised Lord that you would slip in him
[55:18] moving in and out. May you move in
[55:20] tonight. Move in today. In Jesus name we
[55:22] ask it. Amen.
[55:25] God bless you and welcome
[55:29] praises and prayer request
[55:33] the Lord will do this morning.
[55:43] Brother Brown, he's talking about the
[55:46] scripture by saying unto you, Elas has
[55:49] come already and he knew him not but
[55:51] have done unto him what they listed. The
[55:53] reason John Elijah was called Elijah was
[55:58] because the spirit that was upon Elijah
[56:00] had come upon John even as that spirit
[56:03] had come back upon Elijah. So God have a
[56:06] certain anointing that he could transfer
[56:08] from man to man.
[56:11] Are you are you getting me now? So yes,
[56:14] so watch that spirit come up Elisha
[56:15] after the reign of Kinghab. Now once
[56:17] again,
[56:19] that spirit will come upon another man
[56:22] just before Jesus comes. He will be a
[56:26] prophet. He will be vindicated as such
[56:30] by God. Since Jesus himself in the flesh
[56:33] won't be here yet to vindicate him as he
[56:35] did John, it will be done by the Holy
[56:38] Spirit. So that this prophet's ministry
[56:42] will be attended by great and wonderful
[56:45] manifestation.
[56:46] As a prophet, every revelation will be
[56:50] vindicated. For every revelation will
[56:52] come to pass. Wonderful acts of power
[56:56] will be performed at his command in
[56:58] faith. Then will be brought forth the
[57:01] message that God has given him in the
[57:05] word to turn the people back to the
[57:07] truth. Amen. and the true power of God.
[57:11] Some would listen, but the majority will
[57:13] run true to form and reject him. So this
[57:17] end time messenger is to bring a
[57:18] message. Before that message, he's to be
[57:21] vindicated with signs, wonders, and
[57:23] miracles. Amen. But the message is the
[57:26] word. The message comes from the word.
[57:29] And the message is to turn our hearts
[57:30] back to the faith of the fathers because
[57:32] they who are the fathers had the
[57:35] original faith. So we are going and pick
[57:38] up the faith that they had in order to
[57:40] go forward. So tonight I have a title.
[57:43] Every true revelation will be
[57:45] vindicated. Amen. That's the title I
[57:47] have this morning. Every true revelation
[57:50] will be vindicated. Now Wednesday night
[57:54] we shared some things in Ailia to bring
[57:55] back some things on Wednesday night. And
[57:57] the prophet was talking about is
[57:59] something when the Lord Jesus come and
[58:00] do something. Everybody wants to
[58:02] testify. Everybody wants to say
[58:04] something. You can have a revival at
[58:06] your church. Your pastor can speak a
[58:08] marvelous message that and and and and
[58:10] but when something take place. So we're
[58:13] not talking about speaking now or
[58:14] sharing the word now or exhorting or
[58:17] teaching or revealing. We're not
[58:19] speaking about that. We're talking about
[58:20] when something takes place something in
[58:24] the neighborhood. Someone was healed.
[58:26] The neighbors get together and talk
[58:27] about it. How marvelous. Were you there?
[58:29] You should have seen it. It was the most
[58:31] outstanding thing. There is something
[58:33] about the works of God that thrills the
[58:36] heart of man more than anything else
[58:38] that happened. So it's good to hear the
[58:40] word and whatn not. But when God start
[58:41] to work, when God start to perform, when
[58:44] God start to do, that's a different
[58:46] thing all together. It's not you walking
[58:47] in and walking out and walking in and
[58:49] walking out. No, this is God Almighty
[58:52] coming down and doing works among us.
[58:53] Isn't that right? It's just an
[58:55] unforgettable experience when we come in
[58:57] contact with the Lord Jesus and see the
[58:59] things that he does. is so great and
[59:01] marvelous. Now we have witnessed one of
[59:03] the greatest revivals I believe that the
[59:04] world has ever seen in the last 10-15
[59:06] years. It's been a worldwide revival
[59:08] sweeping around the world. Great healing
[59:10] services, great revivals, fire burnt on
[59:13] practically every hill. Right now in
[59:15] Africa, China, Japan, the gospel being
[59:17] preached. That's his time talking about.
[59:19] Then he said these words here. Now in
[59:21] the last few years, it is quiet down.
[59:25] You don't notice the enthusiasm in the
[59:28] people that used to be. I remember
[59:31] having the privilege, here we go, by the
[59:33] Holy Spirit to spearhead that revival
[59:36] that started when that angel of the Lord
[59:39] appeared on the river and said about
[59:42] many years ago and see it happen and see
[59:45] it set minister's heart on fire. So
[59:48] experience generate other experiences.
[59:50] Experience that actually generate a
[59:52] fire. It is contagious. It is effective.
[59:57] It is energizing.
[59:59] Something has happened and my life has
[1:00:01] been changed. Isn't that right? He said,
[1:00:04] "Listeners, why?" You could simply walk
[1:00:07] into a building and the people just get
[1:00:10] out of their cuts and stretches and walk
[1:00:12] away healed. You didn't even have to say
[1:00:15] one word. It was just there. It had just
[1:00:18] taken place. Walk into their building.
[1:00:21] The anointing filled the whole camp.
[1:00:23] People blind seeing, deaf hearing, dumb
[1:00:26] speaking, not a word spoken, just the
[1:00:29] spirit present. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:00:32] praises. Now we going deeper. I remember
[1:00:35] one night in Vanelia, Illinois.
[1:00:38] I walked into the meeting and had no
[1:00:40] more been there in the meeting over 5
[1:00:42] minutes and there wasn't a feeble person
[1:00:45] around the place anywhere.
[1:00:48] wheelchairs pushed out and piled up.
[1:00:50] Blind was seeing, deaf and dumb was
[1:00:53] speaking. It was simply the spirit of
[1:00:56] the Lord was present. Well, give the
[1:00:58] Lord some praises. It was simply the
[1:01:01] spirit of the Lord was present. No
[1:01:03] explanation needed, no information
[1:01:06] needed, no advertisement needed. You
[1:01:09] know when the spirit come upon you, you
[1:01:11] know when the spirit is present. You
[1:01:13] know when God confirming his word, God
[1:01:16] is a confirmer of his word. God
[1:01:18] vindicates his word. God manifest his
[1:01:21] word. He not only come in the learning
[1:01:22] of the word, but he manifest that word.
[1:01:25] God has put fire in the word. God will
[1:01:27] put fire upon you as you become the
[1:01:29] word. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:01:32] Jesus was God mechanic and the father
[1:01:34] was the dynamics. Jesus was the word and
[1:01:37] the fire was the spirit in him. He said
[1:01:39] when you see me, you see the father.
[1:01:41] Well, give the Lord some praises and
[1:01:43] that same thing going to come back.
[1:01:45] Every true revelation will be
[1:01:47] vindicated. You glory of God. Jesus was
[1:01:51] the revelation of God. You will be a
[1:01:53] revelation of Jesus. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:01:55] shout in the house. Give the Lord some
[1:01:57] praises tonight.
[1:02:01] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:02:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I feel I'm
[1:02:07] talking to believers this morning.
[1:02:09] Hallelujah. I feel the church spirit is
[1:02:12] out. I feel that you're catching what we
[1:02:14] are saying. You have to make this your
[1:02:16] personal property. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:02:19] shout. Glory to God. You're not sitting
[1:02:22] this thing. You're not dread chewing
[1:02:23] gum. This is belongs to you. Take the
[1:02:26] book and eat the book. Give the Lord a
[1:02:30] shout in the house.
[1:02:36] [Applause]
[1:02:39] The reason the church fell is because
[1:02:41] they take the anointing of the people
[1:02:42] and put it on a man. The man become to
[1:02:45] and conquer the leoty and instead of God
[1:02:48] being the god of the audience, they put
[1:02:49] it on a man. Eventually, that man become
[1:02:51] a pope.
[1:02:55] In other words, the spirit of man begin
[1:02:57] to rule over the church. Whereas before
[1:02:59] the pillar of fire was ruling the
[1:03:01] church. Men will went when the the
[1:03:04] spirit lead them. It let Peter, it led
[1:03:06] Paul, it led Andrew. It led this one. It
[1:03:08] have to lead you. As many as are led by
[1:03:11] the spirit of God, they are the sons of
[1:03:13] God. There's not joining church. This
[1:03:15] has been led by the spirit. God led you
[1:03:18] to be here this morning. We're going to
[1:03:20] shout in the house. You can be home. You
[1:03:22] can go anywhere you want to go. But God
[1:03:24] led you to be here this morning. And if
[1:03:26] God led you here, there's a message here
[1:03:28] for you. There is a word for you.
[1:03:30] There's a prophecy for you.
[1:03:35] [Applause]
[1:03:39] Catch this.
[1:03:42] This morning have churches all over
[1:03:43] around the world, ministers preaching,
[1:03:45] sharing the word and whatnot. But
[1:03:47] understand this.
[1:03:49] When God begin to speak, I'm not talking
[1:03:52] about man exalted. Now, that is God
[1:03:54] speaking. You know whether the people
[1:03:57] ready for it or not, whether they
[1:03:59] understand it or not, that is God
[1:04:00] speaking. You know, God bought a 20th
[1:04:02] century prophet and spoke to that man.
[1:04:04] He was rejected. But that didn't cancel
[1:04:06] what God said. God word can't lie. He
[1:04:08] said, "My word shall return to me void."
[1:04:11] Anytime the word go out his mouth, it's
[1:04:13] circling, hanging. It's looking to
[1:04:15] fulfillment. It's looking for
[1:04:16] confirmation. It's looking for a
[1:04:18] vindication. The same God that said a
[1:04:20] virgin shall conceive, it was looking
[1:04:22] for Mary for 400 years. 400 years that
[1:04:26] word is spinning all around the world
[1:04:27] looking for that body, looking for that
[1:04:30] woman. And I am telling you there is a
[1:04:32] word looking for you. Oh dear Lord, I
[1:04:35] shout you yourself will be a vindication
[1:04:38] of what God said. He shall turn the
[1:04:40] house of the children back to the faith
[1:04:42] of the fathers. You are one of them
[1:04:44] children that God come for in this hour.
[1:04:46] You are one of them sons that God come
[1:04:49] for. You can't miss it for nothing. Oh,
[1:04:51] give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:04:58] [Applause]
[1:05:04] Hallelujah.
[1:05:06] [Music]
[1:05:07] You say you walk into the meeting in 5
[1:05:09] minutes. Wasn't a feeble person around
[1:05:11] anywhere. Wheelchairs pulled out, piled
[1:05:14] up, blind was seeing, deaf dumb
[1:05:15] speaking. The spirit of the Lord was
[1:05:17] present and he just healed the whole
[1:05:20] group of them. Now, now listen. Now,
[1:05:24] that is when you can do something.
[1:05:29] When revival is going, that is when you
[1:05:32] could do something. But let that revival
[1:05:35] fire die down. The people are still
[1:05:38] Christians, but they're not revived into
[1:05:41] that spirit, that great atmosphere that
[1:05:44] does something. So, you have a choice
[1:05:47] this morning. Amen. You could come to
[1:05:48] sit down to hear what the preacher going
[1:05:50] to say or what is the new thought or the
[1:05:53] message or the title or whatever it is.
[1:05:54] You could come here and you could come
[1:05:55] on expectation for God to do something
[1:05:58] for you. Whether to heal you, deliver
[1:06:00] you, free you, forgive you, cleanse you,
[1:06:02] baptize you, restore you. It doesn't
[1:06:04] matter what it is. Help you, strengthen
[1:06:07] you, encourage you. It doesn't matter.
[1:06:10] But you have to have an expectation. And
[1:06:13] then God could come and meet your
[1:06:14] expectation and move that man to say
[1:06:17] what you need to hear. Move that man for
[1:06:20] to reveal what you need to know. How you
[1:06:23] be have to act. How you have to live. Is
[1:06:26] that the man speaking? Is God speaking?
[1:06:28] Ministering spirits dropping down.
[1:06:30] Giving the man uncction to function to
[1:06:33] speak to express the word. The word
[1:06:36] coming up with power because the man
[1:06:38] under a fire. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:06:41] praises. Glory to God. And God begin to
[1:06:43] energize you right in your seat. God
[1:06:46] begin to charge your faith. Then you
[1:06:48] feel encouraged. Then you feel boosted.
[1:06:51] Then you come out your depression mode,
[1:06:52] your frustration mode, your negative
[1:06:55] mode, your unbelief mode. You can't make
[1:06:57] it mode. You go backside mode. You come
[1:07:00] out all of that.
[1:07:05] [Applause]
[1:07:09] [Music]
[1:07:11] The people are still Christians,
[1:07:14] but they they are not revived
[1:07:17] into that spirit. And I'm saying that
[1:07:21] spirit is that great atmosphere
[1:07:24] that does something. Hallelujah. Like a
[1:07:27] forge in a blacksmith shop. You got to
[1:07:29] get the iron hot before you go to pound
[1:07:31] it in the anvil. You got to put the iron
[1:07:33] there and pound it to burn it. Pong.
[1:07:34] Then it pong it. It ping nowhere. When
[1:07:37] you put fire on it, start to glow.
[1:07:42] Not not not not a hot anvil, you know.
[1:07:45] You see it's glowing. And when it's
[1:07:47] glowing, so bang bang. You could burn it
[1:07:51] when the fire is on it. The Bible said
[1:07:53] you're hot or cold. But this lukewarm
[1:07:56] thing can't work. This partial praising,
[1:07:58] that's partial. Amen. That partial
[1:08:00] attitude that can't work. It's either
[1:08:02] you're hot. If I know your heart, your
[1:08:03] heart, you're on fire. If you call,
[1:08:05] you're dead. We going to bury you. But
[1:08:07] this lukewarm thing ain't good at all.
[1:08:09] That's the church member spirit. Reject
[1:08:11] it. Hate it. Amen. Give the Lord a shout
[1:08:15] in the house. Let me say it again. Good.
[1:08:17] He said, "I rather you're hot or you're
[1:08:18] cold."
[1:08:21] [Applause]
[1:08:25] If you're hot, you could tell your
[1:08:26] friends about Jesus. If you're hot, you
[1:08:28] could tell your friends about your
[1:08:29] enemies about Jesus. If you're hot, you
[1:08:31] could dress right and talk right and act
[1:08:33] right because you're hot. You're on fire
[1:08:34] for God. You ever see a Muslim walk in
[1:08:36] the street
[1:08:38] on the hottest day in Trinidad? They all
[1:08:41] black up to here. Black, black, black,
[1:08:43] black. The socks black, the foot black,
[1:08:45] the whole wearing black. They said
[1:08:46] brother with his son because they
[1:08:48] believe what they believe or they acting
[1:08:49] up what they believe. What about the
[1:08:51] Christian? When they going to act up
[1:08:53] what you believe? They believe what they
[1:08:54] believe. What do you believe? Who are
[1:08:56] you? Okay. The Lord I shout in the
[1:08:58] house. You a lukewarm member. You're a
[1:09:00] church member. Who are you? You're a
[1:09:02] cushion. A little stick is spinning you.
[1:09:04] Who are you? Or you are soldier of the
[1:09:07] cross by faith Enoch. By faith Abraham.
[1:09:10] By faith Joshua. By faith Samson. By
[1:09:12] faith Moses. Give the Lord a shout.
[1:09:14] Shout out by faith.
[1:09:17] Shouted by faith. By faith. Shout out by
[1:09:19] faith. By faith. You have to praise by
[1:09:21] faith. Stand by faith. Worship by faith.
[1:09:24] Believe by faith. Walk by faith. The
[1:09:27] just shall live by faith.
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:46] You talk to Mr. son Isaac. He said,
[1:09:48] "Daddy, I can't afford to be depressed."
[1:09:53] I like that. You can't afford That's too
[1:09:56] expensive.
[1:09:59] Depression is too costly.
[1:10:01] I can't afford to be depressed. I can't
[1:10:04] afford to give up and be fed up. I can't
[1:10:06] stand it no more. And this Christian
[1:10:07] thing and you want to do your own thing,
[1:10:09] go and do your own thing.
[1:10:12] God called Abraham. He bring his family
[1:10:15] along. Lot, he didn't have to do it.
[1:10:17] Say, "Son, God bless him. Come, come,
[1:10:19] come." Lot came out. The blessing was so
[1:10:22] much on Abraham, it fell on Lot. Fell on
[1:10:24] Lot family. on his horses, on his
[1:10:26] cattle, and everything else. They begin
[1:10:28] to prosper until they start to fight
[1:10:30] with Abraham. People
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:33] imagine you get so blessed he had to
[1:10:35] fight.
[1:10:37] It's terrible. That's too much of
[1:10:38] blessing.
[1:10:40] Abraham, son of God, elected, called. He
[1:10:44] said, "Lot, this is not Christianity
[1:10:46] going on here now between our two sides.
[1:10:51] Go left, go right, choose."
[1:10:54] Abraham didn't say God called me. You
[1:10:55] know not know some people like that.
[1:10:57] It's me God called you know.
[1:11:01] You know how you get blessed.
[1:11:03] I want to let you know. Let me give me a
[1:11:05] testimony.
[1:11:08] Abraham wasn't in that power mode and
[1:11:12] that oneup mode and that boasting pride
[1:11:14] mode. He was in that. You know he said
[1:11:16] let you choose pick. Let we are
[1:11:19] brethren. No need to be in this stupid
[1:11:21] church fight. It have a lot of
[1:11:24] Secondary consequences of church wars.
[1:11:28] People has die.
[1:11:30] People's backslide. People has give up.
[1:11:34] Lot look with his eyes. Look around. You
[1:11:37] see desert. So desert. So when you see
[1:11:40] Sodom, so you say, "Oo, look at the
[1:11:42] coconut trees. It's like a beach down
[1:11:44] there, boy. I could put a nice barbecue
[1:11:47] pit.
[1:11:50] The tend to watch salam.
[1:11:53] We end up in Sodom. So wherever you're
[1:11:56] leaning, that's where you'll fall.
[1:11:59] Wherever you're pitching your tent, that
[1:12:00] is where you're heading.
[1:12:02] You know me, pardon my brethren. I ain't
[1:12:05] going to party. You ain't going to party
[1:12:07] yet. But you're leaning. He end up in
[1:12:11] Sodom.
[1:12:12] His family is there. His wife is there.
[1:12:14] His children is there. He have
[1:12:15] son-in-law and daughter-in-law and every
[1:12:17] law is inside of there.
[1:12:21] And I could imagine that day they say
[1:12:24] tomorrow we going and collect pay going
[1:12:26] to the bank. Some going to a new job
[1:12:29] some fixing to tie and polishing the
[1:12:31] fixing to here for the interview. There
[1:12:33] have no fire going on judge.
[1:12:36] Because Jesus said they eat, they drank,
[1:12:38] they build it, they sold normal living.
[1:12:41] But in the supernatural realm something
[1:12:43] was taking place. So don't put your head
[1:12:45] in the sand like if nothing take place.
[1:12:46] You're idiot. You're a fool. You looking
[1:12:49] and see what's happening. You see a
[1:12:51] prophet stand up and said one day they
[1:12:53] going to take a man from America and put
[1:12:54] him in the Vatican. You see that fly
[1:12:57] across there like if it's nothing that's
[1:12:59] not nothing you know that's a
[1:13:00] vindication of what that prophet said.
[1:13:01] You know every true revelation will be
[1:13:03] vindicated.
[1:13:05] That was since the 50s. He talk about
[1:13:07] that and you watching and you're staring
[1:13:09] as if this message doesn't have the
[1:13:11] power that it's supposed to have. Amen.
[1:13:13] We are here under prophecy.
[1:13:16] You are here under prophecy. Amen.
[1:13:19] This church is here under prophecy.
[1:13:22] Oh, the Lord I shall feel fire and all
[1:13:24] that.
[1:13:27] [Music]
[1:13:31] When the angel came to get out Lot and
[1:13:35] to show you Abraham right spirit, the
[1:13:37] angel came to Abraham first. Shall I
[1:13:39] hide from Abraham what about to do? I'm
[1:13:41] going to judge this place. And Abraham
[1:13:44] had to beg if there's 50 righteous. He
[1:13:46] said no. 40 30 20 it didn't have 20
[1:13:54] it didn't add 10 God said I had to go
[1:13:57] down and get him out he dispass angel
[1:14:00] they not your cousin aunt tant or some
[1:14:02] principal or some executive or some CEO
[1:14:04] coming out angels came to them and them
[1:14:07] filthy sodomites in Sodom wanted to go
[1:14:11] with the angels they banging the door
[1:14:16] lot offer them his daughters. They don't
[1:14:18] want that. They want angels. Angels
[1:14:20] smite them blind and they still fighting
[1:14:22] to get in.
[1:14:24] And the word to Lot and his family was
[1:14:26] keep walking.
[1:14:28] I know you failed God. I know you was
[1:14:31] backing. I know you did that and the
[1:14:33] other, but this time just keep walking.
[1:14:37] Just one word. Don't look back. Don't
[1:14:40] look back. And when Jesus was preaching,
[1:14:43] that's the only thing he referred to.
[1:14:45] Remember Lot's wife.
[1:14:47] Don't look back. You come too far to
[1:14:49] turn back now. You come too far to let
[1:14:51] go now. You come too far to let some boy
[1:14:54] throw you off, some man throw you off,
[1:14:56] some woman throw you off. You come too
[1:14:58] far to turn back now. Give the Lord a
[1:15:01] shout in the house.
[1:15:06] Jesus said, "Remember lost wife."
[1:15:12] They walking.
[1:15:15] They walking and they can't look back.
[1:15:18] Abraham in front.
[1:15:20] Lot in front rather. Wife was behind,
[1:15:23] daughter behind.
[1:15:25] She wanted one last look. You know, I
[1:15:28] seen a dress in the magazine. But gosh,
[1:15:30] a big slit in it with some
[1:15:33] frame. By the way, I see a vagrant the
[1:15:34] other day with the cutter pants.
[1:15:37] Me, I see a vigant. I see them vigorant
[1:15:39] was looking at say but all like is we
[1:15:47] No it's true you laughing it's true I
[1:15:48] saw a vagrant and the vegan was in style
[1:15:51] or put this way the people stand the
[1:15:53] vagrant
[1:15:55] because the vegan ped in that a long
[1:15:56] time
[1:15:58] when that woman turned into salt nobody
[1:16:00] could look back in mommy gone keep
[1:16:04] walking you know if you if you on the
[1:16:07] fields mother you turn like a dead you
[1:16:09] know salt for you you know man gone lot
[1:16:13] can't even look back to help his wife
[1:16:15] are you there
[1:16:18] and when there's no answer she gone you
[1:16:20] know what what what what killed her
[1:16:24] heart
[1:16:25] what was in her heart you know what what
[1:16:28] survived with with lot with Joshua and
[1:16:30] kale he I brought word as it was in my
[1:16:32] heart you have to know what in your
[1:16:34] heart
[1:16:36] you have to know what in your heart do
[1:16:38] you know what's in your heart. Some
[1:16:40] people don't know what's in your heart.
[1:16:41] You know, is the test and the trial and
[1:16:43] the tribulation is what brings out
[1:16:44] what's inside your heart. Let me
[1:16:46] continue. Oh, praise God. That was a
[1:16:47] whole thing by itself. Give the Lord
[1:16:49] some praises this morning. We are in the
[1:16:52] word now.
[1:16:55] So many people are trying to explain the
[1:16:57] mechanics when you don't know it. I'm
[1:17:00] not a mechanic, but a punch is he know a
[1:17:03] lot of stuff. Engine, carb, all kind.
[1:17:07] All I want to know is the car could
[1:17:08] start. When the car going bad, I drop it
[1:17:11] by him. I don't ask him you you push
[1:17:13] this, how how much pliers you use, how
[1:17:15] much screws you use, use that jack, you
[1:17:18] use a this. I don't ask no questions or
[1:17:19] no. Is when he finish, he call me it
[1:17:22] done. I just want to tumble. That's all.
[1:17:26] I want to be an engine tumbler.
[1:17:29] [Music]
[1:17:31] Not an engine inspector. Hey, you spark
[1:17:33] plug. You put that there and I watching.
[1:17:35] I'm not a mechanic. That is foolishness.
[1:17:37] Leave that for the mechanics. So what
[1:17:39] the prophet said, you don't have to know
[1:17:41] the mechanics. Just know the dynamics.
[1:17:44] The thing that pulsated when they asked
[1:17:47] to see Jesus, they said not have him
[1:17:49] explained. He said today with great
[1:17:52] intellectual messages we can explain it
[1:17:54] till you can see the picture. That's not
[1:17:57] what we are looking for tonight. We are
[1:17:59] not looking for the mechanics. We are
[1:18:02] looking for the dynamics of it. We don't
[1:18:04] need somebody to explain it more taking
[1:18:07] 10 hours to explain it more for us. We
[1:18:09] need to see the dynamics. We want to see
[1:18:11] Jesus, right? We find out we don't find
[1:18:13] him in fine lecturers. We There are some
[1:18:16] people who can stand up and can explain
[1:18:18] the word in such a way it is
[1:18:19] breathtaking.
[1:18:21] But it's still just a lecture.
[1:18:23] Just a lecture. It's a mechanics. We
[1:18:25] find entertainers who can go through the
[1:18:27] actions, but it still isn't it. We are
[1:18:29] looking for the person of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:32] Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Quicken. He said,
[1:18:36] "There's the gate of worship. Worshiing
[1:18:38] in spirit and in truth, mechanics and
[1:18:41] dynamics together." So I want to I don't
[1:18:44] know if I emphasized this on Wednesday
[1:18:46] night, but this I want to get to. Spirit
[1:18:48] and truth, mechanics and dynamics
[1:18:50] together. So this is a guarantee that
[1:18:53] dynamics will pour out because this is
[1:18:55] the only way we could have the correct
[1:18:57] worship that God wants in spirit and in
[1:19:00] truth in mechanics and dynamics. William
[1:19:03] Brandon brought the mechanics. He had
[1:19:04] the dynamics. The dynamics would open
[1:19:06] the seals and reveal all the mysteries.
[1:19:08] But there's a dynamics to come to the
[1:19:09] power as as Joel said, it shall come to
[1:19:12] pass afterwards. I not man will pour out
[1:19:15] my spirit upon all flesh. Young men
[1:19:18] shall see visions.
[1:19:21] Old men shall dream dreams. Young men
[1:19:22] shall dream visions. And upon my
[1:19:24] handmaidaidens I will pour out my
[1:19:27] spirit. And that word handmaidaidens is
[1:19:29] you he talking about. Oh, give the Lord
[1:19:31] some shouts in the house. It's you. He
[1:19:32] talking about. Give the Lord some
[1:19:34] praises. So you are under prophecy of
[1:19:37] this dynamic outpouring of the Holy
[1:19:39] Ghost. Don't let nobody take it out of
[1:19:41] your heart. Don't let nobody take it out
[1:19:43] of your mind. Don't let nobody cancel
[1:19:45] that expectation of this dynamic power.
[1:19:48] Wait till them seven thunders alter
[1:19:50] their voices to that group who can take
[1:19:53] the word and hand it there. Oh, give the
[1:19:56] Lord a shout. They will slice and cut.
[1:19:58] They could shut the heavens. They could
[1:19:59] do whatever they want to do because it's
[1:20:01] the word of God coming forth from the
[1:20:02] mouth of God.
[1:20:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:20:10] All right, let's go.
[1:20:12] Hallelujah. All right, let's start.
[1:20:14] Hallelujah. When God gives a revelation,
[1:20:20] that revelation is to produce a
[1:20:22] manifestation.
[1:20:26] Abraham's revelation of a son in his old
[1:20:28] age produced Isaac. He went through the
[1:20:31] reproach. He went through the
[1:20:33] embarrassment or people say he's a old
[1:20:35] man. The doctors tell him don't come
[1:20:36] again. I don't know the story. Anybody
[1:20:38] mocking him and laughing in a village 25
[1:20:40] years but it produced what God said it
[1:20:45] was vindicated. Isn't that right? Noah's
[1:20:48] revelation of building the ark on dry
[1:20:51] land produced the rain the flood to save
[1:20:56] Noah and his house. Peter's revelation
[1:20:59] of his sunship
[1:21:02] produced silver and gold have I none but
[1:21:05] such as I have I give it unto thee rise
[1:21:09] up and walked and the man walked isn't
[1:21:12] that right and the seventh under
[1:21:15] revelation is given to bring forth a
[1:21:19] seventh revival or a seventh
[1:21:21] manifestation that is the purpose of it
[1:21:24] not to say I have revelation and you
[1:21:26] don't That's not the purpose to argue
[1:21:29] and to debate and to fuss. But what it
[1:21:31] is is to do is to produce a
[1:21:33] manifestation. That's why he said what
[1:21:35] we see should make a church that would
[1:21:37] make a revival that they will say the
[1:21:39] seven thunders is being manifested. It
[1:21:42] will be manifested. It will be
[1:21:44] vindicated because every true revelation
[1:21:47] will be vindicated. Give the Lord a
[1:21:50] shout. Give the Lord a shout. Hear it
[1:21:52] Trinidad. Hallelujah. Every true
[1:21:54] revelation will be vindicated because
[1:21:57] God can't lie. God is not a man that
[1:22:01] would lie. If God said we haven't
[1:22:04] revival yet, he will send it. He
[1:22:07] promised it. Maybe this morning, I don't
[1:22:10] know, but he promised it. He will send
[1:22:12] it. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the
[1:22:14] house. Oh, glory to God. Send it.
[1:22:20] Yes.
[1:22:23] Glory.
[1:22:25] Hallelujah.
[1:22:27] Hallelujah.
[1:22:29] John the Baptist was God revelation in
[1:22:31] the earth. Amen. To introduce Messiah.
[1:22:34] When John come, he shake up the whole
[1:22:36] place. He said repent like a wild man
[1:22:39] for the kingdom of God is and they start
[1:22:42] to come down. Conviction start to take
[1:22:44] them but black man. And they start to
[1:22:46] baptize them. He said bring forth fruit
[1:22:47] me to repentance. You know, yes, I bring
[1:22:49] in Kentucky fried chicken for you, you
[1:22:50] know, and a nice drink after that. You
[1:22:52] know, he wasn't telling that, you know,
[1:22:53] he said the access to the root. Could
[1:22:56] imagine getting baptized access to the
[1:22:58] root.
[1:22:59] Hallelujah. G you just come and get you
[1:23:03] going now a wet s a dry sinner and come
[1:23:06] a wet one. Same sinner. No, he said
[1:23:08] change your attitude. Change your
[1:23:10] mindset. Change your ways. Then one day
[1:23:13] John said there was one standing among
[1:23:15] you. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. All
[1:23:17] right. Hundreds of years they prophesy
[1:23:19] about Messiah coming. And all of a
[1:23:21] sudden, John was inspired. He said there
[1:23:23] was one. He had to be here. I was sent
[1:23:25] to introduce him. My revelation is to
[1:23:28] forun the coming of the Messiah. So if
[1:23:30] I'm here now, he had to be here too. He
[1:23:33] said there is one standing among you.
[1:23:35] And Jesus just listening because Jesus
[1:23:38] can move before time. He had to be led
[1:23:40] by the spirit. John is preaching but
[1:23:43] he's looking. John is preaching but he's
[1:23:45] under an expectation. John is preaching
[1:23:48] but you know he's going to come into a
[1:23:49] manifestation. John is preaching but you
[1:23:51] know what he's preaching will be
[1:23:52] vindicated. John is under great
[1:23:54] expectation. And one day with the line
[1:23:56] of people getting to get baptized. Here
[1:23:58] come Jesus. He is just one of them. Oh
[1:24:01] give the Lord a sh. I'm so glad that I
[1:24:03] can say oh glory to God. Jesus was one
[1:24:06] of them
[1:24:08] waiting to be baptized. He baptized this
[1:24:10] one. He baptized that one. He baptized
[1:24:13] the other one and here come Jesus their
[1:24:15] eyes locked. The dove come and rest upon
[1:24:18] Jesus. But God told John the one that
[1:24:21] can see the dove resting upon that is
[1:24:24] the one. It have dove rest and take off
[1:24:26] because a wolf inside of there. It have
[1:24:28] dove rest and go out because of a tiger.
[1:24:31] Everything but a lamb inside of there.
[1:24:33] But when that dove rested upon Jesus,
[1:24:35] John knew that was the Messiah. This was
[1:24:38] the fulfillment of all the prophecy. He
[1:24:41] can say this day this scripture is
[1:24:44] fulfilled. Oh, and one of these days the
[1:24:46] revelation that God put in your heart,
[1:24:48] the revelation that God put in your
[1:24:50] soul, one of these days you will say
[1:24:52] this day.
[1:25:00] Hallelujah.
[1:25:04] Do you have a revelation? If not, ask
[1:25:06] God for one. Revelation has put you on
[1:25:09] expectation. Revelation is not
[1:25:11] information. A lot of people sitting in
[1:25:12] the message with information. That's why
[1:25:14] they are dead. They have no expectation
[1:25:16] because revelation is something revealed
[1:25:18] to you that you cannot explain. It's the
[1:25:20] substance of what you're hoping for.
[1:25:22] It's evidence of things not seen. I come
[1:25:24] here by faith this morning under great
[1:25:26] expectation for God to confirm and
[1:25:28] vindicate his word. That the backsliders
[1:25:30] will be restored. That the young men
[1:25:32] will get charged up. That the old people
[1:25:34] will get revived. Oh, glory to God. Take
[1:25:37] out your blues. Oh, glory. They got all
[1:25:39] them drunk people, half drunk people.
[1:25:40] Then I take me bar. That way all them
[1:25:42] sports bars keep be popping up
[1:25:43] everywhere. They start to drink and all
[1:25:45] the all they getting all this so thing
[1:25:47] and they talking to the men and they
[1:25:48] drinking and trying to drink away with
[1:25:49] the woes and the booze and all kind of
[1:25:51] thing. We not in that foolishness. We
[1:25:53] drinking something different. We
[1:25:54] drinking new wine this morning. We have
[1:25:56] stimulation of revelation. We have joy
[1:25:58] with it. Speak unspeakable full of
[1:26:01] glory. Give the Lord some praises. I
[1:26:04] knew I was different when I hear the
[1:26:06] eagle call. I am not a chicken.
[1:26:09] Hallelujah. I am not a chicken. I'm a
[1:26:11] eagle. I marry a eagle, too. Sister
[1:26:14] Angry is not a chicken. She's an eagle,
[1:26:15] too. This is two eagles. Hallelujah.
[1:26:18] Give the Lord some praises. Glory to
[1:26:21] God. We not following man. We following
[1:26:22] God. We not believe in some man. We
[1:26:24] believe in God. Hallelujah. God holds
[1:26:27] our future. God hold your future. Do you
[1:26:31] know you are eagle? Why you fool around
[1:26:33] with chickens when you know you're
[1:26:35] eagle?
[1:26:39] [Applause]
[1:26:42] A revival produces four things. Number
[1:26:46] one, it win lost souls for Christ. Two,
[1:26:50] it revives the church into a spiritual
[1:26:54] condition to where you have close
[1:26:56] communion with God. Three, it brings
[1:27:00] fellowship among the churches.
[1:27:02] Four, pray for the sick. These four
[1:27:05] things what a revival produced. And this
[1:27:08] is where the prophet said it here. He
[1:27:09] said, "Now watch." So the great thing
[1:27:11] that we are after for any revival is to
[1:27:14] bring lost souls to Christ. First,
[1:27:16] revive the church back into a spiritual
[1:27:17] decision to where it should be a close
[1:27:19] communion with God. Bring fellowship
[1:27:21] among the churches. Third, fourth, pray
[1:27:24] for the sick. That's our aim to try to
[1:27:26] win sinners first, then fellowship to
[1:27:29] the churches. a close walk and with the
[1:27:31] church of God and then pray for the
[1:27:32] sick. Now when Adam lost his life, he
[1:27:35] lost his inheritance in life because he
[1:27:38] sold out to his wife's reasoning. He
[1:27:40] said he lost inheritance in life because
[1:27:42] he had completely he had completely
[1:27:45] supreme control of the earth. He was a
[1:27:48] god of the earth. God is a god of the
[1:27:50] universe everywhere. But his son had
[1:27:52] this earth under his control. He could
[1:27:55] speak, he could name, he could say, he
[1:27:58] could stop nature. He could do anything
[1:28:00] he wanted to. But when he did that, he
[1:28:03] lost his inheritance. Isn't that right?
[1:28:06] Adam could say, "Let the mountain be
[1:28:07] moved. It will do it. Let this tree be
[1:28:09] plucked up and plant over." He could do
[1:28:10] it because he had supreme control under
[1:28:13] God. The Bible said, "Let us make man in
[1:28:16] our image and likeness." That's the key
[1:28:18] there. Image and likeness. And let that
[1:28:19] man in that image and likeness. Let that
[1:28:22] man have dominion. Not a man out of my
[1:28:25] image. A man in my image. So once the
[1:28:28] image are restored, what's the image?
[1:28:30] Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[1:28:34] patience, godliness, brotherly kindness,
[1:28:36] charity. That image come back in the
[1:28:38] man. That's a man going to walk in
[1:28:39] dominion. That's a man that will speak.
[1:28:42] And you said when omnipotent speak, the
[1:28:44] miraculous take place. Are we going to
[1:28:47] get back that kind of man? Yes. God
[1:28:49] promised that. God promised sons of God
[1:28:52] to come back on the earth in the end
[1:28:54] time right in Satan's Eden. God, the
[1:28:57] devil went in God's Eden and turned
[1:28:59] things upside down. Now God waited for
[1:29:01] Satan Eden. He has some sons, some born
[1:29:04] sons, some anointed sons, some filled
[1:29:07] sons, some inspired sons. He going to
[1:29:09] have some adopted sons. Men are going to
[1:29:11] speak the word and will create itself
[1:29:13] just like that. God called man. God man
[1:29:16] on the earth. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:29:19] When they walk, devils scatter. When
[1:29:21] they talk, demons scream. God called
[1:29:24] man. God empowered man, God inspired
[1:29:28] man. That's the kind of man that God is
[1:29:30] bringing back on the earth. No devil
[1:29:32] could stop it. Putin can't stop it.
[1:29:35] America can't stop it. No government
[1:29:37] could stop it. No press could stop it.
[1:29:39] Whatever bring we will deal with it. Oh
[1:29:41] give the Lord a shout. When Moses went
[1:29:44] to Pharaoh, which was the superpower at
[1:29:46] that time, Moses had one message. Let my
[1:29:48] people go.
[1:29:50] [Applause]
[1:29:57] Okay, let's go.
[1:30:01] My
[1:30:02] the first human being dysfellowship
[1:30:05] themselves from believing God by
[1:30:08] disbelieving his word and listening to
[1:30:10] the lie of the devil.
[1:30:14] The devil is a liar. How do we know?
[1:30:17] Every time he opened his mouth,
[1:30:24] So if you hearing something other than
[1:30:25] the word, is the devil talking to you?
[1:30:28] And if you had talk back to him and tell
[1:30:30] him where to get off, he will keep
[1:30:32] talking to you. He's a talker. Oh, he's
[1:30:36] a sweet talker. He is a sweet talker.
[1:30:39] When he came to Eve, Adam wasn't home
[1:30:40] and I was working because there was no
[1:30:42] man to tell the soil. Adam was telling
[1:30:43] some soil. Eve was home. She was
[1:30:45] supposed to be cooking. Knock knock
[1:30:47] knock on the door. Who is that?
[1:30:53] Serpent was not a snake. Handsome guy.
[1:30:57] Nice talk.
[1:30:59] You on Instagram.
[1:31:03] Send Eva text.
[1:31:06] Send Eva picture. Say your husband home.
[1:31:09] He not home. She say he's not home. Come
[1:31:11] back when he come.
[1:31:13] I'm not I'm not entertaining you. But he
[1:31:16] had a talk. You say what? What? What did
[1:31:19] God tell her? God talking to me. You
[1:31:20] know, I ain't hearing nothing from me.
[1:31:23] Then she said to say, but she she
[1:31:25] excited to testify.
[1:31:27] She said God said we get rid of all the
[1:31:30] trees. But she admits uh don't touch it.
[1:31:32] Now she didn't hear that herself. She
[1:31:35] get from her husband. So the husband
[1:31:37] will have the details of that. The
[1:31:38] husband had revelation of that. She only
[1:31:40] saying back what the husband say that
[1:31:42] God said if you touch a tree surely die.
[1:31:46] Oh, come on now. God, no. You shall not
[1:31:48] surely die. The reason God said that is
[1:31:51] because you won't be wise.
[1:31:55] The attraction was wisdom.
[1:31:58] The attraction was something you don't
[1:32:00] know. And I want to reveal it to you.
[1:32:05] Hallelujah. You talk about a sick devil.
[1:32:11] He said the minute that the church
[1:32:13] disbelieves any one word of God's Bible
[1:32:16] and places it somewhere else, then they
[1:32:19] break off that wonderful fellowship that
[1:32:22] is offered to them.
[1:32:24] God is obligated to meet you on the
[1:32:26] basis of them promises. Outside of them
[1:32:30] promises, he can't meet you. That's a
[1:32:33] big one. You know, in other words,
[1:32:34] that's why we here to preach you
[1:32:36] promises. Isn't that what Jesus did?
[1:32:39] Jesus tell them the same works I do
[1:32:40] shall you do also them fellas backing
[1:32:42] them fell all kind of creeps inside of
[1:32:43] there you know people go deny him or
[1:32:45] what not you know but he's not holding
[1:32:46] back the promises he said the same works
[1:32:49] I do shall you do also if you believe in
[1:32:52] me my word abide in you shall ask what
[1:32:54] you will it shall be given unto you he
[1:32:56] told him people that not converted yet
[1:32:58] if you shall say to the mountain be
[1:33:00] moved and don't talk in your heart you
[1:33:02] can have what you say he's not waiting
[1:33:04] for them to be ready he's telling them
[1:33:06] before they're ready oh the Lord I shout
[1:33:08] out. Come on, preach back to me.
[1:33:10] Somebody say amen. He wasn't waiting for
[1:33:13] them to be ready. He was telling them
[1:33:15] what they are to become.
[1:33:22] How much time you hear me preach? The
[1:33:23] devil is not afraid of you as you are.
[1:33:25] What the devil is afraid of is what you
[1:33:27] could become. To become in part is
[1:33:29] trouble. Hallelujah. To become in part
[1:33:32] is trouble. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You
[1:33:34] see, God see you as a mighty warrior
[1:33:36] like Gideon. Gideon didn't see himself
[1:33:37] right.
[1:33:40] God said, "Oh, mighty man of valor."
[1:33:41] Gideon looking around.
[1:33:43] Who? Who? Who you talking to? Not me.
[1:33:46] Hallelujah. Because when Gard had to
[1:33:49] talk, he said, "I'm the least. I am the
[1:33:51] least. I am the least. I'm the least.
[1:33:52] I'm the least." God says, "You are
[1:33:53] talking about."
[1:33:56] Hallelujah. And God so bold.
[1:33:59] He said, "Put your name in it. Say the
[1:34:02] son of the Lord and of Gideon and and no
[1:34:04] spoil, you know.
[1:34:07] They just have a lamp and a picture and
[1:34:09] say break it and say those words.
[1:34:14] Could you imagine even have the kind of
[1:34:16] argumentative spirits have now? So wait
[1:34:21] where your sword with that picture and
[1:34:23] that light um how you moving. So we
[1:34:26] don't need that around here. We need
[1:34:28] people to obey. We need to please to
[1:34:31] follow through with what God said. He
[1:34:33] said, "Break the picture and say the s
[1:34:34] of the Lord in Gideon." When they did
[1:34:36] that, them fellas had to fight one
[1:34:37] another, cut one another and Gideon just
[1:34:40] went back and all the pizza he ordered,
[1:34:42] them brothers just sit down and share
[1:34:44] the slices of pizza to one another and
[1:34:46] they fighting and fighting one another.
[1:34:47] Ging know the Lord fought for them. Them
[1:34:50] fight one another. Do you understand
[1:34:52] what I'm saying? God want to give you
[1:34:54] rest, you know, but you have to fight. I
[1:34:56] love want rest, but you're lazy. I hope
[1:34:59] that don't offend nobody, but I'm coming
[1:35:00] again with it. You want rest, but you're
[1:35:02] lazy. You have to fight. And when you
[1:35:04] fight, then you could rest.
[1:35:08] Give the Lord some praises.
[1:35:11] I saying 60%. I will hit them again. You
[1:35:13] know, Joshua had a commission to do
[1:35:15] three things. Cross over, fight, and
[1:35:18] then divide the land. You cannot defy.
[1:35:20] You cannot divide no land when you have
[1:35:21] a peace.
[1:35:24] You understand I'm saying it? You You
[1:35:26] get land is yours. You you get so and
[1:35:29] you're pulling back easy because you
[1:35:30] want to take that spot right there.
[1:35:32] You're a looking to fight at all. As far
[1:35:33] as you're concerned, you want this bon
[1:35:34] for your family and you're just th
[1:35:36] little fencing around your thing. You're
[1:35:38] fighting for that. When you're sleeping
[1:35:40] on a tent, some some arrow come and hit
[1:35:43] you because the enemy still around. You
[1:35:45] get lick up. God even tell them little
[1:35:48] by little you go possess the land. You
[1:35:50] can't go and cut grass. You cut 10 acres
[1:35:52] of grass and you only could plant a lot
[1:35:55] and you're watching the grass grow back
[1:35:56] in front of your face.
[1:35:58] Because you taking land and you're
[1:35:59] feeling takish. Amen. You feel you want
[1:36:01] to possess what? Yes. But you have to
[1:36:03] manage what you possess. Possess, clean,
[1:36:06] maintain, plan, grow, add, and then
[1:36:09] continue like that little by little. You
[1:36:11] con come one lot, your two lots, three
[1:36:12] lots, you hit an acre, you're going to
[1:36:13] hit two acres, three acres, four acres,
[1:36:15] then afterwards 5 acres is nothing to
[1:36:17] you. You're looking for 20 acres, but
[1:36:18] you have the crops coming on
[1:36:21] and you're not wetting timari and old
[1:36:23] old old grass all around. You're not
[1:36:25] doing that. You have crops to wet. You
[1:36:28] have crops to water.
[1:36:34] Outside of them promises, he can't meet
[1:36:36] you because you don't cut yourself off
[1:36:38] from him. Hallelujah.
[1:36:41] That's right. That's the reason the
[1:36:42] world is falling apart. Now, as soon as
[1:36:45] Eve questioned that word, debt set in
[1:36:48] her mortal beings. Not only her mortal,
[1:36:51] but her spiritual being. She broke off
[1:36:53] relationship with God the minute she
[1:36:55] disbelieved. And then he made this
[1:36:57] statement. No man, no woman can believe
[1:37:01] the devil's lie until they have
[1:37:03] disbelieved God's truth. So sin really
[1:37:06] is unbelief. And people are finding out
[1:37:09] that they're not really believing what
[1:37:11] they think they believe. They see that
[1:37:13] with their mouth, but their heart saying
[1:37:14] something else. He said, "You cannot
[1:37:15] believe the devil's lie until you reject
[1:37:17] God's truth." So God truth is the issue
[1:37:20] facing you this morning. Amen. Husband,
[1:37:22] love your wife. That's the truth. That's
[1:37:24] the wife, subjective to your husband.
[1:37:26] Respect your husband. That's the truth.
[1:37:28] That's the word. You have to confront
[1:37:29] with that.
[1:37:31] Children, obey your parents. Respect
[1:37:32] your parents. You have to be confronted
[1:37:34] with that or you want to go in rebellion
[1:37:36] mode. Are you with me now? Seriously,
[1:37:38] think.
[1:37:42] Think seriously because we will never be
[1:37:44] able to think anymore after this. After
[1:37:47] this mortal life is over, your thinking
[1:37:49] is now. You cannot choose after this.
[1:37:52] You must choose now. This is the day of
[1:37:55] choosing. Eve one word, not a whole
[1:37:58] decal. One word. She questioned because
[1:38:02] God because it was presented to her in
[1:38:04] that light that the word was
[1:38:06] questionable. God's word cannot be
[1:38:09] questioned. He meant just what he says.
[1:38:12] He watches over his word. You say,
[1:38:15] "Well, my church don't believe it that
[1:38:16] way." Then you do not believe it's God's
[1:38:19] word. And you walk away under the same
[1:38:21] condemnation that Eve went away. Some
[1:38:24] people love the pastor. They love the
[1:38:25] church. They love the organization and
[1:38:27] their children. The Bible says so. They
[1:38:28] reject that. They believe their church.
[1:38:31] They believe the man behind the pulpit
[1:38:33] that talking lies to them. They believe
[1:38:35] that because when the word is presented,
[1:38:38] all of us have to be confronted with the
[1:38:39] word. I I was a Catholic. I was
[1:38:41] confronted with the word and I take
[1:38:43] throw that off and believe the word
[1:38:44] because the word is the word. The word
[1:38:46] is God. Are you with me? So watch now.
[1:38:49] Watch here this now. If God had a few
[1:38:52] words where people would obey and in
[1:38:55] them few words one of them was missing
[1:38:57] represented cause debt. Look at the
[1:39:00] words we got today. We must receive
[1:39:02] every one of them and hold onto them and
[1:39:05] enter into them as promises of God. What
[1:39:08] was the first thing that Eve to
[1:39:09] disbelieve God's word? It was because
[1:39:11] Satan promised her more wisdom. She
[1:39:13] thought here we go. Because it was
[1:39:16] presented to her, it looked so real.
[1:39:18] Don't fail to get this. It looks so
[1:39:20] real. Something that could be added to
[1:39:22] what God said. It looked like she have
[1:39:25] something that God hadn't told her. And
[1:39:28] a lot of these pastors and ministers
[1:39:29] want to bring revelation that is not in
[1:39:31] the Bible. That's not in the word. But
[1:39:33] the figure there
[1:39:35] that's something to show. And people
[1:39:36] say, "Woo, never see it." So don't go
[1:39:39] like that. You know, never see it. So
[1:39:41] you know what you want is what God said.
[1:39:43] What you want more than that is what God
[1:39:44] said on your behalf because you want to
[1:39:46] apply it to your life and to your
[1:39:48] family. Do you get it now? You don't
[1:39:50] want to be a hearer of the word only.
[1:39:53] You want to be a doer. But the word has
[1:39:55] to be made clear that you could know
[1:39:58] what you have to do. It must be more
[1:40:00] than information. It has to become a
[1:40:02] revelation.
[1:40:04] Oh, glory to God. Are you with me?
[1:40:06] Hallelujah. Simeon got a revelation. He
[1:40:09] will not see death and see the Lord's
[1:40:11] Christ. He's a old man. death buzzing
[1:40:12] all around him, the grim reaper waving
[1:40:14] his thing unto him and what not. But he
[1:40:16] know he have revelation. He cannot die
[1:40:18] until he see the Lord's Christ. The
[1:40:20] death angel can stop next to him. He can
[1:40:22] say, "Listen, you got to hold on. You
[1:40:23] know, you got to take your time in. You
[1:40:26] had to wait because I'm waiting for
[1:40:27] Messiah." Simeon knew Messiah to come to
[1:40:30] his house. Messiah had to come to the
[1:40:32] temple. So Simeon knew his business was
[1:40:34] to get yourself to the temple. Whether
[1:40:36] you walk with a cookst stick, whether
[1:40:38] somebody had to drag him and pull him,
[1:40:39] he had to get himself there because that
[1:40:42] is where Messiah going to come. Whoever
[1:40:45] have to be brought to be offered up one
[1:40:48] day. Simeon at the beginning of the
[1:40:50] temple there sitting down just hammering
[1:40:52] around. How many some Christian song all
[1:40:54] of a sudden Mary pass him with a baby
[1:40:57] other woman passing through, you know,
[1:40:58] there was a whole set of them passing
[1:41:00] through and when he when Mary passed him
[1:41:02] so the spirit come upon him. Hallelujah.
[1:41:05] He felt different. He knew different. He
[1:41:07] knew the spirit is upon him. Something
[1:41:08] move him. The Messiah is there now. Oh,
[1:41:11] glory now. Get the Lord some praises.
[1:41:13] The Messiah is there now. He passed this
[1:41:16] woman. He passed this baby. He passed
[1:41:18] this baby. What he's looking for? He
[1:41:20] looking for the witness because every
[1:41:22] true revelation must be vindicated. It
[1:41:25] was revealed to him that he will not see
[1:41:27] death and see the Lord Christ. He passed
[1:41:29] this church, pastor church, passes
[1:41:30] church. And when he reached Mary, he
[1:41:32] said, "Now Lord, thy Lord, let silver
[1:41:34] depart in peace, for my eyes have seen
[1:41:36] the glory. Oh glor," right in front of
[1:41:38] him, he held the manifestation. He held
[1:41:41] the confirmation. He held the
[1:41:42] vindication of the revelation that God
[1:41:45] gave him. Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[1:41:47] the house. And you must have a
[1:41:49] revelation in your heart that when you
[1:41:51] come to church, you're holding that
[1:41:52] Messiah. You're holding that promise.
[1:41:55] You're holding what God promised you. He
[1:41:57] promised to heal you. He promised to
[1:41:58] seal you. He promised to baptize you. He
[1:42:01] promised to restore you. He promised to
[1:42:03] amen revive you. And God can't lie. And
[1:42:06] you're under expectation. Oh God.
[1:42:08] Sometime you don't know how to pray.
[1:42:09] Sometime you don't know what to pray.
[1:42:11] But you know God something's in store
[1:42:13] for you. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:42:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:42:19] Hallelujah. Give the Lord some praises.
[1:42:26] The only way to stay in divine
[1:42:28] fellowship is to keep the word. Now I
[1:42:31] want you to think about this. This one
[1:42:34] word Eve broke because she did that made
[1:42:38] every hungry child that was ever in the
[1:42:40] world. Every pain of debt, every sorrow,
[1:42:43] every heartache, she did it right there.
[1:42:45] What a horrible thing to disbelieve
[1:42:46] God's word. Every person that groans in
[1:42:48] pains of every debt that ever was or
[1:42:51] ever will be, she did it right there.
[1:42:53] Every little unwed child, she did it
[1:42:55] right there. Every child born out of
[1:42:57] wedlock, every sin that was ever
[1:42:59] committed, she caused it right there by
[1:43:02] keeping every word right down just one
[1:43:04] little place. She reasoned.
[1:43:08] There's no better class of people in the
[1:43:09] world than those who keep God's word.
[1:43:15] Now, keep those things in mind.
[1:43:17] The church must believe every word,
[1:43:21] every promise, every iota. This is the
[1:43:24] important part here. And claim it for
[1:43:27] themselves.
[1:43:28] One, and exercise themselves in it.
[1:43:34] Hallelujah. 3% say amen. All watching
[1:43:38] me, you know, stop watching me, you
[1:43:39] know. Close your eyes. Stop seeing me.
[1:43:41] And when you hear the word, say amen.
[1:43:42] Glory. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:43:45] You got to watch me.
[1:43:51] The church, God help me. Sometimes, some
[1:43:55] I don't know how to say it, you know.
[1:43:57] I've been trying to get it across and
[1:43:58] I'm hoping they catch it. The church
[1:44:01] must believe every word, every promise,
[1:44:06] every iota and claim it for themselves
[1:44:10] and exercise themselves in it.
[1:44:13] You have to say this is mine.
[1:44:16] But when you look at you,
[1:44:20] you're passing this through you. That's
[1:44:23] not what God ask. When God say a virgin
[1:44:25] shall conceive, Isaiah say oops Yeshua.
[1:44:29] If Isaiah tell God, Yeshua, ask God,
[1:44:32] Yeshua, you want me to say that? God
[1:44:34] bypass his intellect, his mind, drop
[1:44:37] into his heart and he said a virgin
[1:44:40] shall conceive. Hallelujah. He has no
[1:44:42] interpretation or adding to it. He spoke
[1:44:44] what God said. It mightn't be logical to
[1:44:47] man or science or whatever. He has
[1:44:49] nothing to do with that. Hallelujah.
[1:44:52] When Joshua told those Levites, three
[1:44:55] days we crossing over, take the ark and
[1:44:57] go forward. Those guys, they question
[1:44:59] nothing. They put the ark upon their
[1:45:01] shoulder and they went straight down to
[1:45:03] Jordan River. And when the foot touched
[1:45:05] the Jordan River, the river open up.
[1:45:10] Unbelief would be means you waiting for
[1:45:12] it to open up or you am moving. Your
[1:45:15] testimony is I am moving. Hallelujah.
[1:45:17] Until I see Jordan open up. Jordan will
[1:45:19] remain close to you and your land of
[1:45:22] promise is beyond Jordan. So you better
[1:45:24] get your foot in that water. Jordan
[1:45:26] River cold, but your better foot. Give
[1:45:28] the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Are
[1:45:31] you ready to claim this for yourself?
[1:45:34] Are you ready to exercise yourself in
[1:45:35] it? Not only must you claim it. If you
[1:45:38] claim these signs shall fall in the
[1:45:40] belief, your child get sick, your
[1:45:41] neighbor get sick, you could lay us upon
[1:45:43] the sick and they shall recover. That's
[1:45:45] how you exercise it. Give the Lord some
[1:45:47] praises because you believe that you are
[1:45:49] believer. Come on now. I know I'm not
[1:45:51] hearing you. You believe you are a
[1:45:53] believer and the Bible said these signs
[1:45:55] shall follow them that believe. They
[1:45:58] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:46:01] shall recover.
[1:46:03] You have every right to pray for your
[1:46:05] sick son or sick daughter. You have
[1:46:07] every right to lay your hands on
[1:46:09] yourself and said devil come out.
[1:46:13] Hallelujah. Praise God. You have every
[1:46:14] right to do that. Give the Lord a shout
[1:46:17] in the house. He can attack your body.
[1:46:20] He can attack your spirit. But you have
[1:46:22] a right to respond to his attacks.
[1:46:26] [Music]
[1:46:29] Hallelujah.
[1:46:31] Hallelujah. So you say if I'm engaged
[1:46:34] and to a girl and I give her engagement
[1:46:36] ring and she doesn't want to wear it,
[1:46:37] she doesn't believe me. And if God send
[1:46:39] gifts among us and we don't receive it,
[1:46:41] we are believe it. Praise God. So no
[1:46:43] church will clean your soul. No creed
[1:46:46] can clean your soul. Only the blood of
[1:46:49] Jesus Christ can clean your soul. Satan
[1:46:53] will make all kind of promises but he
[1:46:55] has nothing to give you because he don't
[1:46:57] have enhancing. He don't have no
[1:46:59] salvation. What is Satan? Here we go.
[1:47:01] You want what is Satan? What is Satan?
[1:47:04] Anything contrary to the word. He
[1:47:07] doesn't have salvation. He doesn't have
[1:47:08] light. His kingdom is darkness. The end
[1:47:10] thereof is death. Darkness and death is
[1:47:12] Satan's kingdom. He said, "What is
[1:47:15] Satan's kingdom?" Anything contrary to
[1:47:19] the word of God. Anything contrary to
[1:47:21] the precepts of God, the word of God is
[1:47:24] not God. What is it? Sin is
[1:47:27] righteousness perverted. What is death?
[1:47:29] life perverted. What is the kingdom of
[1:47:32] Satan? Anything set in something that
[1:47:34] will take place of the word, any
[1:47:36] teaching, one word, just one word. You
[1:47:38] might believe every bit like Eve. That
[1:47:40] one word is all you need to disbelieve.
[1:47:42] Hallelujah. Praise God. Think of it.
[1:47:45] Let's go. One word to disbelieve God
[1:47:48] through a promise of the devil or his
[1:47:50] machinery. One word sends you into
[1:47:52] torment. That's the way it started. And
[1:47:54] if God, here we go, in his mercy as he
[1:47:57] is, would send this mass of hell upon
[1:48:00] the earth and cause little hungry
[1:48:02] children, all kind of affliction,
[1:48:04] starving people, death in the earth
[1:48:06] because one word at the beginning, could
[1:48:08] not he have looked it over and kept from
[1:48:12] having all this mass of suffering? Could
[1:48:14] he not have done it then? If he didn't
[1:48:16] excuse one word then knowing that this
[1:48:19] would be the results, how much more will
[1:48:22] he not excuse one word there? When the
[1:48:26] individual is going to be the sufferer
[1:48:28] alone.
[1:48:29] Think about it. Amen. It's a tremendous
[1:48:32] thing. I'm still reading. When Adam and
[1:48:34] Eve listened to the lie of the devil,
[1:48:37] here we go. The holy image of God left
[1:48:40] them. Their fellowship was broken with
[1:48:43] God. their fellowship of oneness with
[1:48:46] God was broken, the very minute they
[1:48:48] listen to the lie of the devil, that
[1:48:50] broke their fellowship. And the very
[1:48:52] minute that you listen to the lie of the
[1:48:55] devil, it will break your fellowship.
[1:48:57] That's the very minute you go out from
[1:49:00] the presence of God. Look at Samson. God
[1:49:03] tell him seven locks. God gave him a
[1:49:06] covenant. Don't cut it. He's fooling
[1:49:08] around with a Philistine girl, Delilah.
[1:49:10] He's fooling around. He not even
[1:49:11] studying the girls in his own camp. He's
[1:49:14] fooling around with her. He begin to lie
[1:49:16] to her. She wants to know what is the
[1:49:19] secret of his strength.
[1:49:21] She work on him with her mouth with her
[1:49:24] words until she give in. And every time
[1:49:26] he lie to her, he made the covenant but
[1:49:29] he going backwards. One lie, two lie,
[1:49:32] you know, still feeling blessed, still
[1:49:34] feeling anointed or whatnot. But he is
[1:49:36] going
[1:49:38] backwards. And one day when she he
[1:49:41] revealed to her his whole heart, she
[1:49:43] knew it. It clicked. She get the money
[1:49:47] from her supporters and her backers and
[1:49:50] the spirits that's behind her. Cuz
[1:49:52] that's what you don't see. The spirit
[1:49:54] behind her, the spirit behind him,
[1:49:59] the spirit behind them, you're only
[1:50:01] seeing them and her and him, but you're
[1:50:03] not seeing the spirit behind that.
[1:50:04] Behind the forces at work.
[1:50:08] Hallelujah. She sent for them and
[1:50:12] they're destructive because they dig out
[1:50:14] Samson eye. And the Bible says Samson
[1:50:17] shake himself up before because all the
[1:50:19] lies he telling he break through and he
[1:50:21] still had the power to defeat them. But
[1:50:23] this time when he shake himself as
[1:50:25] usual,
[1:50:27] he recognized he's just a man like
[1:50:30] everybody else because the covenant was
[1:50:32] broken. Therefore, the power was absent.
[1:50:35] It was no longer there as a vindication
[1:50:37] or confirmation. And Samson was a guy
[1:50:39] had revelation from God, but because he
[1:50:43] broke the covenant, the anointing was no
[1:50:46] longer there to give the uncction to
[1:50:48] function. He couldn't defeat the enemy.
[1:50:51] And they dug his eyes out. Samson had a
[1:50:53] long time. Secondary consequences of his
[1:50:57] despicable behavior. Secondary
[1:50:59] consequences. Lost his eyes. He had a
[1:51:03] long time to think over it. Amen. And
[1:51:05] one day, one day they want to embarrass
[1:51:07] him. Now they want to shame him. Now
[1:51:10] they want to make sports of him now.
[1:51:12] Once a servant of God, once on top the
[1:51:14] mountain, once victory, once killed lion
[1:51:17] and once killed a thousand philistine
[1:51:18] with just a jawbone of an a mule,
[1:51:23] a little boy leading him. He's blind.
[1:51:26] Samson asked him, "Where are the pillars
[1:51:29] that this building struck his whole
[1:51:31] life? Lead me to it. I want to show what
[1:51:34] faith make a man do. Samson say stop in
[1:51:36] the middle of the field about hallelujah
[1:51:39] glory bloop. He fall down. That was
[1:51:42] entertainment for them. That's the next
[1:51:43] piece of entertainment. He has spirit.
[1:51:45] He jumping, jumping, jumping. Something
[1:51:46] didn't do that. He said put me in the
[1:51:49] position
[1:51:51] between the pillars because I want to
[1:51:53] get glory to God. Put me in position
[1:51:57] where I could be effective
[1:51:59] where I could maximize the damage on the
[1:52:01] enemy. and they put him between the
[1:52:04] pillars. When they looking for
[1:52:05] excitement and looking for
[1:52:07] entertainment, Samson start to cry
[1:52:09] through his sucker eyes. He's saying,
[1:52:12] "Once more, Lord. Once more, send
[1:52:15] another book of Acts. Send your power as
[1:52:18] in Mark 16, St. John 14:12, St. Mark
[1:52:21] 11:23, send Acts 18, your power come
[1:52:25] down upon the church once more, Lord."
[1:52:27] And Samson knew he had it before so he
[1:52:30] could call for it some more. And when
[1:52:32] the power hit him, he felt the power in
[1:52:35] his muscles. He felt the power because
[1:52:37] the hair grow back. The lux was
[1:52:39] restored. He was anointed. He was ready.
[1:52:43] And he pushed all his might. And he
[1:52:45] said, "Let me die with them." Oh, give
[1:52:47] the Lord a shout. I'm willing to pay the
[1:52:50] price now. Let me die with my enemy. And
[1:52:53] Samson killed more Philistine in his
[1:52:56] death than in his life. He brought honor
[1:52:58] and glory to God. What that devil know
[1:53:01] didn't know is that God dropped his
[1:53:03] agent in the camp of the enemy. What
[1:53:06] does the Lord are shouting the house?
[1:53:08] Glory to God. And here we are in Satan's
[1:53:11] Eden. We are in the enemy camp. But God
[1:53:14] has raised us up in this hour for such a
[1:53:17] time as this. Give the Lord a praise in
[1:53:19] the house. Hallelujah.
[1:53:22] Hallelujah.
[1:53:23] God himself has done that. All right.
[1:53:28] So, Eve wasn't supposed to be smart. She
[1:53:31] was supposed to be obedient. God don't
[1:53:34] want us smart. He want us to lean on his
[1:53:37] understanding.
[1:53:38] Oh, praise God. Now, we know we make
[1:53:41] mistakes, but you mustn't look at that.
[1:53:44] It's not your mistakes because you're
[1:53:46] always going to have them. But you see
[1:53:50] it is following his rules, following
[1:53:52] what he said do. Stumbling and falling
[1:53:55] doesn't have one thing to do with it. A
[1:53:58] real true servant. If he stumble, he
[1:54:00] will get up again. If he wobbles, God
[1:54:02] pull him right back to the path, as long
[1:54:05] as he's a part of duty. But if he's off
[1:54:08] the part of duty, God is not obligated
[1:54:10] to him. But as long as the part of duty,
[1:54:14] God is obligated to him, knowing he's
[1:54:16] just a man or a woman. He is obligated
[1:54:18] to that person as long as they in the
[1:54:21] path of duty. We hitting the home
[1:54:23] stretch. The word oneness means to be
[1:54:25] one with and that's the scripture we
[1:54:28] read. Jesus said that we be one not just
[1:54:30] any kind of one. As let me read it here.
[1:54:33] Hallelujah. Let me get that here.
[1:54:37] Praise God. Thank you Jesus.
[1:54:40] Thank you. Now I'm no more of in the
[1:54:42] world but these are in the world. And I
[1:54:45] come to thee, holy father, keep through
[1:54:48] thine own name those whom thou has given
[1:54:50] me that they may be one as we are. So
[1:54:55] the oneness was as we are. St. John
[1:54:57] 14:20 he said at that day you shall know
[1:55:01] I am in the father ye in me and I in
[1:55:04] you. Then he also said to them as my
[1:55:07] father sent me so send you. The father
[1:55:10] that sent him went in him. So he is
[1:55:13] showing that he himself going to be in
[1:55:16] you. Hallelujah. So as the father power
[1:55:20] Jesus, Jesus will power that bride.
[1:55:22] Because we'll be connected to him. Isn't
[1:55:24] that right? Hallelujah. Do you get it
[1:55:26] tonight? All right. So let's go. So
[1:55:29] watch now. The spirit of God in the word
[1:55:35] makes the word live itself or act itself
[1:55:40] out. Now Paul said the letter killth but
[1:55:44] the spirit giveth life. So the text or
[1:55:46] the letter in itself is not the spirit.
[1:55:50] It is the spirit in letter form or word
[1:55:52] form but the spirit is what energizes is
[1:55:55] what bringeth alive. So we need the
[1:55:58] spirit to make the word that we are
[1:56:00] hearing alive or quickened or like
[1:56:05] dynamic coming to you. You need that.
[1:56:08] It's quickening power. Lazarus was dead
[1:56:11] but Jesus said I go wake him. He take
[1:56:14] power to wake him. He said where have
[1:56:16] you laid him? He that believeth on me.
[1:56:18] He throw a promise as the scripture had
[1:56:20] said. No. He he said what? What? I am
[1:56:22] the resurrection and the life. That's
[1:56:24] what he said to them. You can't say that
[1:56:26] a sick person. You talking about the
[1:56:27] dead person. I am the resurrection and
[1:56:30] the life. And that sister draw into
[1:56:32] that. Plug into that even now Lord. You
[1:56:35] say where have you laid him? Roll away
[1:56:37] the stone. She can't complain now. and
[1:56:39] ball stone too big. No, she run to move.
[1:56:41] Is faith at work? You know, faith for
[1:56:44] Jesus to be there. Faith for Jesus to
[1:56:45] speak the promise. Faith to say roll
[1:56:47] away the stone. And faith for him to
[1:56:49] say, Lazarus, come forth. And a dead man
[1:56:52] come forth. Well, give the Lord a shout.
[1:56:55] I'm telling you, you have to be in love
[1:56:57] with this faith thing. This faith is
[1:56:59] life. This faith is a currency of God.
[1:57:02] You walk by faith. You talk by faith.
[1:57:03] You live by faith. You go home and you
[1:57:05] believe that God will protect you and
[1:57:07] you will go home safely. All of that is
[1:57:09] by faith. Give the Lord some praises.
[1:57:12] The spirit of God in the word makes the
[1:57:14] word live itself or acts itself out. It
[1:57:17] brings the word to life like a seed.
[1:57:20] That's how he says, "So my word shall go
[1:57:22] from my mouth. It shall return me void."
[1:57:24] Like a seed. What happened to that seed?
[1:57:26] You have a seed. You put it here. You
[1:57:27] could leave it there for 100 years. It
[1:57:30] stay dry. It's still a seed. But until
[1:57:32] you put water in that in a ground, it
[1:57:34] will stay dry. Just a seed. It have life
[1:57:37] in it. Amen. But the life has not been
[1:57:38] unfolded. You have life in you, a seed
[1:57:41] in you, the word in you. The secret is
[1:57:43] the word is in the brine. The disciples
[1:57:45] had themselves haul themselves in the
[1:57:46] upper room dry seeds waiting for rain to
[1:57:49] come. When the day of Pentecost was
[1:57:51] fully come, the Holy Ghost poured upon
[1:57:53] their seeds and the seed begin to grow
[1:57:55] or the word turn to spirit or the
[1:57:57] kingdom of God has manifest in them as
[1:57:59] the word turn into spirit and they had
[1:58:01] the kingdom. Even Jesus tell them don't
[1:58:02] go low here, low there. He said the
[1:58:04] kingdom is within you. He was showing
[1:58:06] this word coming to you and then God
[1:58:08] transformed that word in you and then
[1:58:10] the kingdom breaks out. Oh, you're
[1:58:13] empowered now. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:58:15] shout. You are empowered now. You're a
[1:58:17] little wiky sister and all of a sudden
[1:58:19] the kingdom break upon you. You're
[1:58:20] empowered now. And you find yourself
[1:58:21] casting devils, praying for the sick,
[1:58:23] praying for your son, praying for your
[1:58:25] daughter, praying for whatever condition
[1:58:27] and God answering your prayer. You are
[1:58:28] now empowered by the spirit of God. It's
[1:58:30] not letter anymore. It's spirit and word
[1:58:33] dynamics and mechanics together.
[1:58:34] Something got to rock. Something got to
[1:58:36] shake. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:58:40] Amen. Hallelujah. Before all this modern
[1:58:43] technology, it used to have the trains
[1:58:45] and the train with with with um a boiler
[1:58:48] in it. Hallelujah. With water in it. For
[1:58:50] the train to move, it needs steam. How
[1:58:53] you getting steam? You had to hot the
[1:58:54] water. It's not boiling water, you know.
[1:58:56] It's steam. They have to bring that
[1:58:58] water so hot that it produces steam. And
[1:59:00] this steam generates the power to move
[1:59:03] the train from one place to the next. So
[1:59:05] I'm saying to you this morning, rapture.
[1:59:07] Where you going with that? A book, a
[1:59:08] tape. We going to rapture. Where you
[1:59:09] going? Down San Fernando. Where you
[1:59:11] going to go with the rapture? Where you
[1:59:12] going? Rapture. We taxi.
[1:59:17] Raptor taxi. You need power to leave.
[1:59:21] Enoch walked with God and was not.
[1:59:23] Because God took him and God is a
[1:59:26] spirit. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:59:28] Glory to God. God is not just text. God
[1:59:30] is the spirit. The prophet said the
[1:59:32] dynamic, the mechanics he reflected
[1:59:34] became dynamics by the spirit and it
[1:59:37] took him.
[1:59:39] In other words, what he had on the
[1:59:40] inside might transform what was on the
[1:59:41] outside. Raptor is not outside in. The
[1:59:43] rapture is inside out. We're going to
[1:59:45] leave here because of what's in us. Not
[1:59:48] what we hanging on here. This old flesh.
[1:59:49] You see the old gray head man walking
[1:59:51] bent up and broken. That's not rapture
[1:59:54] business. Rapture is the power inside of
[1:59:55] you. If that same spirit that raised
[1:59:58] Christ from the dead dwell in you, it's
[2:00:00] going to quicken your mortal body by
[2:00:02] that same spirit. Oh, give the Lord a
[2:00:04] shout in the house. Same spirit.
[2:00:09] Hallelujah. Same spirit.
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:13] [Applause]
[2:00:15] Hallelujah.
[2:00:16] Hallelujah.
[2:00:18] If that same spirit that raised Christ
[2:00:20] from the dead, hallelujah, dwell in you,
[2:00:22] shall quicken your mortal body, you have
[2:00:24] seen nothing yet. Oh glory. No blind
[2:00:26] people going to rapture. No deaf and
[2:00:28] dumb people going rapture. You had to be
[2:00:29] healed here now. You're going your
[2:00:31] whole. No gray hair any rapture. Yeah.
[2:00:33] You know your gray hair going back
[2:00:35] black. Your baldhead getting back here.
[2:00:37] Okay. I show me starting here this
[2:00:38] morning. You know this corruption will
[2:00:40] put on incorruption. This mortal will
[2:00:42] put on immortality. We shall be changed
[2:00:44] in a moment. In a twink of an eye. Oh
[2:00:46] Lord. I shout. I am leaving here. You
[2:00:48] could stay back if you want, but I'm
[2:00:50] getting out of here. Why you think I'm
[2:00:51] preaching this way? I want to get out of
[2:00:53] here. The bombs about to fly. The
[2:00:56] nuclear weapons is about to be loosed.
[2:00:57] The hour of God judgment is already
[2:00:59] loosed from the bow. Oh, give the Lord a
[2:01:02] shout. Oh, doomed devils on the run.
[2:01:05] We're going to see them doomed devils on
[2:01:06] the run. You're going to run them off
[2:01:08] your family. They're going to run them
[2:01:09] off your loved ones. They're going to
[2:01:11] run them off your wife. They're going to
[2:01:12] run them off your children. Doomed
[2:01:14] devils going to be on the run. Oh, give
[2:01:16] the Lord a shout.
[2:01:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The son of the
[2:01:20] Lord and of the bride. Shout.
[2:01:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The
[2:01:27] [Applause]
[2:01:28] [Music]
[2:01:36] So the only way they could be one with
[2:01:38] God, only way. Only way was because God
[2:01:42] nature was in them.
[2:01:46] So how they get away from this perfect
[2:01:47] man statue? Hallelujah. How how do you
[2:01:50] get for nature? It's not because they
[2:01:52] hear a sermon and the text was in them
[2:01:54] and they sleeping on a Bible or book
[2:01:56] that God's nature was in them. These
[2:01:59] virtues
[2:02:02] the LGBTQ world people hijacked the
[2:02:05] color and rainbow and stuff
[2:02:08] them liars. But this belong to us. They
[2:02:12] are the perverted ones. They are the
[2:02:14] twisted ones. But this is original.
[2:02:18] The Lord I shout this is original.
[2:02:21] This is what this this is ours.
[2:02:25] They can't take that
[2:02:27] flag we wear. You know there's something
[2:02:29] on the inside. It thunder in Luther. It
[2:02:32] thunder in Wesley. It thunder Pentecost.
[2:02:35] Seven thunders going to be in that
[2:02:37] bride. The mighty angel come back with
[2:02:39] his red back wings with seven thunders.
[2:02:42] Seven voices. Those seven voices will be
[2:02:45] in the bride. They don't want it to be
[2:02:47] the virtues. That is the business. But
[2:02:48] seven voices going to be in the bright
[2:02:50] to thunder against the enemy. The devil
[2:02:52] going to be rocking and shaking. God
[2:02:54] can't lie. The thunders is on the earth.
[2:02:57] Hey.
[2:03:01] Hallelujah.
[2:03:02] What a punch. No man bring it down.
[2:03:05] Jesus brought it down. No man I bring it
[2:03:08] down. The revelation will be vindicated.
[2:03:12] The seven tunnels on the earth.
[2:03:15] [Music]
[2:03:15] [Applause]
[2:03:19] Glory.
[2:03:21] This is good. This is good. That is why
[2:03:24] he said wait till them seven thunders
[2:03:26] that's on the earth utter the voices of
[2:03:28] that group.
[2:03:33] [Music]
[2:03:36] [Applause]
[2:03:37] So Jesus prayed a prayer in St. John 17
[2:03:39] that we be one. What a union, a oneness
[2:03:43] that would be to see God in his church.
[2:03:45] He is till every member is just
[2:03:47] perfectly in harmony with each other and
[2:03:49] God. I love that. You see, somebody
[2:03:52] can't be claimed to be harmony with God
[2:03:53] and they can't be har with your brother.
[2:03:55] That's a different God you're with.
[2:03:59] Harmony with God means you could be in
[2:04:02] harmony with your brother and sister.
[2:04:03] Amen. So if somebody claim so so the
[2:04:06] problem is a God connection
[2:04:09] because God can't forgive you of your
[2:04:11] sins and you hold somebody sin against
[2:04:13] them. That makes no sense. Because the
[2:04:16] same blood for you is for your brother.
[2:04:18] The same blood for you is for your
[2:04:20] sister. So you can say God pardon you.
[2:04:22] You are free and you condemning somebody
[2:04:24] and locking somebody neck. That that
[2:04:26] that can't work.
[2:04:28] Perfect harmony with each other and God.
[2:04:31] That's the church that Jesus coming for.
[2:04:34] That is where his prayer will be
[2:04:36] answered. That we will be one. Sin and
[2:04:41] death takes you away from God. So to be
[2:04:44] united with him in the spirit of his
[2:04:46] power is eternal life and you are
[2:04:49] eternally united with God. On the day of
[2:04:52] Pentecost, here we go. We find the Holy
[2:04:55] Spirit, the pillar of fire. Amen.
[2:04:57] Separating itself and setting upon each
[2:04:59] member of that church,
[2:05:02] God putting himself together by doing
[2:05:05] what? Giving each one their own light.
[2:05:08] It wasn't the pastor light and the
[2:05:09] bishop light and the arbishop life and
[2:05:11] the apostle light. No, every believer
[2:05:13] tongues of fire lit upon each one of
[2:05:15] them and they were all filled
[2:05:19] with the Holy Ghost. So when Mary was
[2:05:21] filled with Holy Ghost, she didn't feel
[2:05:23] and they were all filled
[2:05:25] with the Holy Ghost. So when Mary was
[2:05:28] filled with Holy Ghost, she didn't feel
[2:05:29] let go in the pulpit to preach
[2:05:32] that that that Holy Sp now now said a
[2:05:36] woman pumping going where God didn't
[2:05:38] change her fellowship change her
[2:05:42] fellowship with her husband wasn't
[2:05:45] right. They begin to pass the buck. You
[2:05:48] know the story go. Eve said the serpent
[2:05:50] and and then when God got Adam, Adam
[2:05:52] Adam said the woman you give me. He was
[2:05:54] careful to say you know he said I I find
[2:05:57] she you know you give me that and and
[2:06:00] that is how I that what what happened
[2:06:02] now. So so so excuses was in Genesis.
[2:06:06] Hallelujah. Excuses was in the
[2:06:08] beginning. Adam didn't want to accept
[2:06:10] responsibility for what went on there.
[2:06:14] But God didn't talk to his serpent. And
[2:06:16] upon thy belly of shall go. You stand
[2:06:17] straight down in the ground. That way
[2:06:19] you take a dive. Listen to this. Her
[2:06:23] thinking changed.
[2:06:25] Her fellowship with her husband wasn't
[2:06:27] right.
[2:06:29] Her thinking was changed because she had
[2:06:31] the life of the devil in her. As soon as
[2:06:35] she disbelieved God's word, she accepted
[2:06:37] the life of the devil because she
[2:06:40] accepted his teaching.
[2:06:43] So you mean teachings have a life? Amen.
[2:06:46] Exactly. Amen. Jesus said it this way.
[2:06:48] The words that I speak unto you, they
[2:06:52] are spirit and they are life. So the
[2:06:56] devil's spirit come into people by false
[2:06:58] teaching.
[2:07:01] Causing them to think differently and
[2:07:04] see differently. So instead of seeing
[2:07:06] you as brethren, they see you as off or
[2:07:09] this or that and they up and you down.
[2:07:12] said of foolishness, no manifestation,
[2:07:13] no vindication, no confirmation. None at
[2:07:15] all. Just talk. You know, trainer like
[2:07:18] to talk.
[2:07:21] Hallelujah.
[2:07:24] You see, God don't deal with person in a
[2:07:26] group. Uh God don't deal with you in an
[2:07:28] organization. He deals with you as an
[2:07:30] individual and individual. Individually,
[2:07:33] we are baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[2:07:36] Collectively, we are baptized into the
[2:07:38] body when we are baptized with the Holy
[2:07:39] Ghost. Amen. It's the same thing today.
[2:07:41] God want a separation. There can be no
[2:07:44] unity. Can night have unity with day?
[2:07:46] Can a believer have unity with an
[2:07:47] infidel? Can a man who believes in all
[2:07:49] the word have unity with a man who just
[2:07:51] believes part of the word? He paid a
[2:07:53] debt in order to get the oneness between
[2:07:56] God and man. This is the price that
[2:07:57] Jesus paid. I'm I'm closing. Jesus could
[2:08:00] not come along as long in a body of
[2:08:02] flesh. So he had to become the complete
[2:08:04] sin offering to take away the guilt of
[2:08:06] the believer to take away so the Holy
[2:08:08] Ghost would come into man and make man
[2:08:10] and God oneness again. Hallelujah. He
[2:08:13] had to reestablish that. So the highest
[2:08:15] form of the on human life is a human
[2:08:17] being. The human being fell. So God in
[2:08:20] spirit could not die. So God had to
[2:08:23] bring himself a little lower than the
[2:08:24] angels and take on flesh to take on debt
[2:08:29] to pay the penalty to bring the oneness
[2:08:31] between man and God again so the Holy
[2:08:34] Ghost could come back. I'm sure that the
[2:08:36] objective of all of this is to bring
[2:08:38] back Holy Ghost. Isn't that right? The
[2:08:41] debt of sin was paid. Jesus had to do
[2:08:44] this to send the Holy Ghost back upon to
[2:08:47] unite the people again like it was in
[2:08:48] the garden of Eden. So the objective of
[2:08:50] the Holy Ghost is to unite the people.
[2:08:53] No minister could do it. No man could do
[2:08:55] it. No church could do it. Playing the
[2:08:58] tapes every day from now till the
[2:09:00] tribulation, it can't to do it. Oh, give
[2:09:03] the It still need the Holy Ghost. Give
[2:09:05] the Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[2:09:08] Hallelujah.
[2:09:09] [Applause]
[2:09:09] [Music]
[2:09:11] Musicians, get ready. The disciples even
[2:09:13] walking with Jesus didn't have no
[2:09:15] oneness. Listen. They didn't have any
[2:09:17] unity. They argued, "Who's going to be
[2:09:19] bishop after this? Who's the greatest
[2:09:21] among us?" They couldn't even believe
[2:09:23] Jesus. They couldn't understand him.
[2:09:25] God's got a plan. Outside of that plan,
[2:09:28] I don't care how much wisdom behind it,
[2:09:30] how much million of dollars of the
[2:09:32] buildings, how much schools, if it's
[2:09:34] denying the Bible is of the devil. The
[2:09:36] disciples who walk with him, slept with
[2:09:38] him, eat with him, saw miracles are so
[2:09:40] teased with him, close as anybody. They
[2:09:42] didn't have it yet. He said, "Don't
[2:09:44] preach anymore. I'm going to send the
[2:09:46] promise that's been given to you that
[2:09:49] will unify you. Yes. The disciples had
[2:09:53] no unity. They could not understand
[2:09:55] Jesus. They said God wasn't in them yet.
[2:10:00] Here we go. Well, punch this. They were
[2:10:03] associated in fellowship.
[2:10:07] But George, you get that? But God wasn't
[2:10:10] in them yet. Even a woman come one time
[2:10:12] and says Jesus could you put one of my
[2:10:14] sons in the left hand one son in the
[2:10:16] right disciples they are furious to them
[2:10:18] brothers because they know the mother
[2:10:19] come with a foolishness
[2:10:21] Jesus says nothing in me to put on right
[2:10:23] and left and so on like that you know
[2:10:24] the story but they had issues among
[2:10:27] themselves you go wasn't friends being
[2:10:29] friends is Jesus called these different
[2:10:30] groups of people different backgrounds
[2:10:33] different whatever it is and he had them
[2:10:35] there around there isn't that right all
[2:10:37] right let's hit the sh here now so
[2:10:40] church.
[2:10:42] God wasn't in them yet. They were just
[2:10:46] associated in fellowship. They just
[2:10:49] associated with him. That's many a good
[2:10:51] man today. They didn't drink, lie,
[2:10:53] steal, nothing. But they didn't have one
[2:10:55] with God.
[2:10:57] They know the message. They know the
[2:10:59] quotes. They know the explanation. But
[2:11:01] they're not one with God. Amen.
[2:11:06] But when the day of Pentecost was made
[2:11:07] one, they was made one again. Amen.
[2:11:09] Oneness with God. They were in one
[2:11:11] heart, one soul, one mind, one mind.
[2:11:15] They were restored back to original
[2:11:16] again. We are coming to the end now. God
[2:11:19] sent the Holy Ghost. And the Holy Ghost
[2:11:22] is God himself. Here we go. He is the
[2:11:26] one that will make the oneness between
[2:11:28] God and man. The Holy Ghost alone. Man
[2:11:33] under the devil's plan has tried to
[2:11:35] denominate the church into oneness.
[2:11:37] educate the church into oneness. Through
[2:11:39] denomination, man under the devil's plan
[2:11:43] tried to denominate people into oneness.
[2:11:45] But God said, "Not by power, not by
[2:11:47] might, but by my spirit. I will unite my
[2:11:50] church. Not by organization, not by
[2:11:53] education, not by theologians, but by my
[2:11:55] spirit, say the Lord. I'll bring my
[2:11:57] sheep together."
[2:11:59] Oh, praise God. And when he does, what
[2:12:02] happens? His signs will be a record of
[2:12:05] the same. The revelation will have a
[2:12:07] vindication. Hallelujah. He's bringing
[2:12:09] the elect together from all kind of
[2:12:11] churches everywhere. He's calling his
[2:12:13] elect together in oneness to himself. He
[2:12:15] called the elect Lutherans to form the
[2:12:16] Wesian. Call the elect Weson to form the
[2:12:18] Pentecostals. And now he's calling the
[2:12:20] elect Pentecostal out to make the
[2:12:22] headstone to come into it. Praise God.
[2:12:25] I'm closing here now. The word of God is
[2:12:28] a sword.
[2:12:29] And the word is the sword is perfectly
[2:12:32] dormant if it isn't yielded by the hand
[2:12:34] or power. It takes a hand to hold the
[2:12:37] sword and take the hand that holds this
[2:12:39] sword is the hand of faith. Now the hand
[2:12:42] of faith is depend upon how strong it
[2:12:43] is. Now if it's a strong hand it will
[2:12:46] cut through. Some people have faith to
[2:12:47] say I'm saved. I I I have faith to say
[2:12:50] brother but you my pastor. I have faith
[2:12:52] to say I go to he tabernacle. Plenty of
[2:12:55] faith. But here what he wants. If it's a
[2:12:57] strong hand, it will cut plum through
[2:12:59] everything the devil can put out there
[2:13:01] and make every promise of God shine
[2:13:03] forth in the power of the resurrection.
[2:13:05] It depends upon the power of the hand
[2:13:07] behind the sword. Oh, glory to God. We
[2:13:09] have the sword here today. You know,
[2:13:11] it's the power of the hand behind the
[2:13:13] sword. Now, that sword will cut in there
[2:13:16] if there's enough arm to push it in. It
[2:13:18] will find its place, cut every promise,
[2:13:21] and give it to you. If you got strong
[2:13:23] enough arm behind it, the sword will
[2:13:24] pick it up the arm of faith and grip it
[2:13:26] tight. You take the sword of the word
[2:13:28] and every promise belongs to you. Pick
[2:13:30] it in a strong pick up in a strong hand.
[2:13:31] Walk forward. If you need healing, cut
[2:13:33] it out with the word. Push through the
[2:13:35] darkness until the light of God shines
[2:13:37] through you. The real believers will not
[2:13:40] compromise in any word. They were in
[2:13:42] God's image and God was in them. And
[2:13:45] that is what makes a fellowship. That is
[2:13:47] what make a union. God in his church.
[2:13:49] Let's go. The kingdom of God is his word
[2:13:52] made power. 1 Corinthians 4:20, the
[2:13:55] kingdom of God is the word made power.
[2:13:57] What is the kingdom of God? It's within
[2:13:59] you. The kingdom is in you. And when the
[2:14:02] word comes in there, what does the word
[2:14:04] begins? It turns itself into power. You
[2:14:07] can't say it says this and it says this
[2:14:09] and make it work. You you got to say the
[2:14:10] same thing. It makes a confession. And
[2:14:13] here we go. This is a bomb. What is it?
[2:14:18] You got to get that word. You got to get
[2:14:21] yourself killed out. I'm persuaded that
[2:14:23] many of us friends have received the
[2:14:26] Holy Ghost.
[2:14:28] But
[2:14:30] we just received enough Holy Ghost in us
[2:14:34] to make us to a place where we don't
[2:14:36] want to lie. We don't want to steal. We
[2:14:39] don't want to do anything. But God wants
[2:14:42] to fill every fiber of his church. He
[2:14:46] wants to fill your thinking. He wants to
[2:14:48] fill your mind. He wants to fill every
[2:14:51] bit of you. Just make you completely
[2:14:54] totally dead to yourself or to your
[2:14:56] thinking just so surrendered till God
[2:14:59] that his word is living right through
[2:15:00] you. Oh my. Hallelujah. What is it? We
[2:15:05] are getting ready for the rapture.
[2:15:07] Holding ourselves steady for a few
[2:15:08] minutes till every fiber is filled with
[2:15:11] the Holy Ghost. You can't go rapture
[2:15:13] without Holy Ghost. You can't go rapture
[2:15:16] just with books and tapes. You have to
[2:15:18] be there till every fiber is filled. He
[2:15:21] is calling his people together to

[2:31:12] prayer requests. You could play
[2:31:13] something softly. So,
[2:31:16] note of praise. This is my testimony of
[2:31:18] God's goodness and love. Greetings to
[2:31:20] the body of Christ. This month, July,
[2:31:23] will mark one year since my father, the
[2:31:25] most high God, had miraculously
[2:31:27] delivered me. I had a six-hour surgery
[2:31:30] to remove a tumor in my pancreas. I will
[2:31:33] be forever grateful to my family, Gloria
[2:31:36] Francis, Uncle Edmund, and all editors
[2:31:38] of the Headstone Tabernacle headed by
[2:31:40] our beloved Pastor Oid. Thank you for
[2:31:42] your strong prayer and intercession. It
[2:31:45] was a few days before surgery late at
[2:31:47] night when Gloria called on a three-way
[2:31:50] line. Pastor did not hesitate. He
[2:31:52] responded right away. He prayed and
[2:31:54] pleaded the blood of Jesus Christ to
[2:31:56] cover me. Right before I went into the
[2:31:59] surgery room, I heard the Holy Spirit
[2:32:01] spoke to me saying, "There's no one here
[2:32:03] with you. Your family's in the waiting
[2:32:05] room and cannot come in here with you. I
[2:32:06] am here and I will never leave you or
[2:32:09] forsake you." And from that moment on, I
[2:32:11] was comforted and at peace. Thank you,
[2:32:13] my brothers and sisters, for keeping me
[2:32:15] in your prayers. Truly, prayer changes
[2:32:17] things. There is nothing too hard for
[2:32:19] God to do. He is able. To God be the
[2:32:22] glory for great, great things he has
[2:32:24] done. From Katherine Walker,
[2:32:27] family of the Anwine. So, we thank God.
[2:32:32] We do have quite a number of prayer
[2:32:34] requests this morning.
[2:32:37] We want to take to the throne of grace
[2:32:39] this morning
[2:32:42] from sister Jennifer Oid. Please pray
[2:32:45] for brother Terren who is in a lot of
[2:32:46] pain. He fell on Friday evening. So you
[2:32:50] want to remember brother Terren in
[2:32:52] prayer
[2:32:56] from brother Vijay Kadu. I'm requesting
[2:32:59] prayer for severe
[2:33:01] back pain, for healing of a severe back
[2:33:04] pain and for a total deliverance
[2:33:07] from Sister Precious Allen. Good
[2:33:10] morning, saints. I'm asking for prayer
[2:33:11] on behalf of my brother's apprentice. He
[2:33:14] fell down from a tree yesterday and hit
[2:33:17] the back of his head and you can see his
[2:33:19] brain.
[2:33:21] We got the news that he might not make
[2:33:23] it. Praying for a total
[2:33:25] recovery.
[2:33:29] requesting prayer for Daniel Rajkumar,
[2:33:31] from Sister Susan for his safety and his
[2:33:34] well-being, thanking the Lord in
[2:33:36] advance,
[2:33:38] and from sister Janice Straker. Please
[2:33:40] pray for my sister Brenda who is in San
[2:33:43] Fernando Hospital with a brain tumor
[2:33:46] which is affecting her speech and the
[2:33:49] closing and opening of her hands
[2:33:52] and the speech has come back but her
[2:33:54] hands are still uh cannot open and
[2:33:56] close. Also my uncle is in mount hope
[2:34:01] with complications as well. And if
[2:34:04] there's anyone in the house this morning
[2:34:05] with a need that has not been written,
[2:34:09] but you want us to approach the great
[2:34:11] physician this morning to make your
[2:34:14] petition known. The Bible said, "If two
[2:34:17] shall agree, touching anything, we could
[2:34:18] have what we ask for." Healing is a
[2:34:21] children's bread. And there's power in
[2:34:23] the church of the living God over every
[2:34:25] disease, every sickness, over every
[2:34:27] affliction, over every problem,
[2:34:29] condition. It doesn't matter how
[2:34:31] complicated it is. He is God. So shall
[2:34:34] we pray this morning? Heavenly Father,
[2:34:37] we thank you this morning for words of
[2:34:39] eternal life, Lord, that has been spoken
[2:34:41] behind the sacred desk to encourage us,
[2:34:44] Lord, about the promised manifestation
[2:34:46] of every vindicated promise of God.
[2:34:49] Every revelation must be vindicated,
[2:34:51] Father. And Lord, we have stood behind
[2:34:54] this sacred desk many times and seen
[2:34:57] many prayer requests come back as notes
[2:34:59] of praise, Father. And Lord, we come as
[2:35:02] a needy people with Lord a number of
[2:35:04] prayer requests this morning, Lord, from
[2:35:07] Lord, Sister Janice, for a sister with a
[2:35:09] brain tumor, Lord. And she's looking for
[2:35:12] a touch, Father. We pray there, God,
[2:35:13] that the angel of the Lord would move to
[2:35:16] Brenda wherever she is right now.
[2:35:18] Father, may you touch her from the crown
[2:35:20] of her head to the soles of her feet.
[2:35:22] May she be completely healed. And may
[2:35:24] this request come back as a note of
[2:35:26] praise. and for her uncle in Mount Hope
[2:35:29] with complications. Whatever the
[2:35:31] complications are this morning, we know
[2:35:33] you are more than able to deal with
[2:35:35] every complication. Lord, for Daniel
[2:35:38] Rajkumar for his safety and well-being,
[2:35:40] Lord, may your blood cover him. May you
[2:35:42] protect him, Lord, for Lord. Lord, for
[2:35:45] sister Precious is her her brother
[2:35:47] apprentice uh John Owen. Lord God, he
[2:35:51] fell down and Lord, it's a very grave
[2:35:54] serious situation. But Lord, you are
[2:35:56] more than able this morning. Lord, you
[2:35:59] are able to do anything, Father. So,
[2:36:01] Lord, in the situation of the
[2:36:03] impossibility, Lord, you make yourself
[2:36:06] known. So, Father, may you make yourself
[2:36:08] known to him and to all of his loved
[2:36:10] ones in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[2:36:12] And Lord may your healing power move
[2:36:15] into that situation Lord for brother
[2:36:17] Vijay Kadu Lord for the severe back pain
[2:36:20] plane Lord and for a total deliverance
[2:36:23] Lord we pray a healing would touch him
[2:36:25] even now as as he's at his post of duty
[2:36:28] and Lord for brother Terren Lord Lord an
[2:36:31] elder in the house of God Lord how the
[2:36:33] enemy has a right to try anything he
[2:36:35] could try but we as a church have a
[2:36:38] right to push back every attempt of the
[2:36:40] enemy we have a right as a church of the
[2:36:42] living God to pray for the sick, Lord,
[2:36:45] to declare healing over our house and
[2:36:47] our family. So, Father, may the angel of
[2:36:49] the Lord visit your servant even now and
[2:36:51] touch him from the crown of his head to
[2:36:53] the salt of his feet. And Lord, for
[2:36:55] every hand that was raised in the
[2:36:57] sanctuary, every request in the
[2:36:59] tabernacle, those that are on the
[2:37:01] internet, Lord, we speak a word of
[2:37:03] healing, of deliverance, of freedom, of
[2:37:06] breakthrough. May the power of the Holy
[2:37:08] Ghost move upon each one in the mighty
[2:37:11] name of Jesus Christ. And the church
[2:37:13] says, and the church says.
[2:37:17] And heavenly father, Lord, we pray for
[2:37:18] your people. Lord, we pray for your
[2:37:21] church. Lord, we pray for our pastor
[2:37:23] this morning. We pray for the ministers.
[2:37:25] We pray for the elders. We pray for the
[2:37:27] deacons. We pray for the trustees. We
[2:37:29] pray for the ushers. We pray for the
[2:37:30] musicians. Lord, the technicians, the
[2:37:32] Sunday school, the the kitchen, the
[2:37:34] hospitality, the parking. Lord, every
[2:37:37] help, every government, every officer,
[2:37:39] every brother, every sister, every
[2:37:41] father, every mother, we pray for the
[2:37:43] entire assembly in the mighty name of
[2:37:46] Jesus Christ. Father, may you strengthen
[2:37:48] your people one more time as Samson
[2:37:51] cried out once more, Lord. Uh, Father,
[2:37:53] we cry once more, Lord. Uh, may you move
[2:37:56] upon your people. And Lord, may you
[2:37:58] bring us back at the appointed time. We
[2:38:00] are under great expectation for what
[2:38:02] you're about to do. Lord, you have never
[2:38:04] failed us yet. Lord, we could look back,
[2:38:07] Lord, and look to the mountains, look to
[2:38:08] the valleys, and when we could look, we
[2:38:10] could say, "You have never failed us
[2:38:12] yet. You are faithful. You are God of
[2:38:15] the faithful. You're a faithful God.
[2:38:17] You're a miracle working God. You're a
[2:38:20] God who opens doors. Uh you're a God of
[2:38:22] the possibility." He said, "If is is is
[2:38:24] anything too hard for you and there's
[2:38:26] nothing." So, Father, we claim every
[2:38:28] backslider. We claim everyone that's
[2:38:31] sick. We claim those that are
[2:38:32] struggling. We claim those that the
[2:38:34] enemy thinks he has. And we say, "Satan,
[2:38:37] take your hands off of God's property.
[2:38:39] House of hell, give way to the name of
[2:38:41] Jesus." Uh, and by the power that's
[2:38:43] vested in us as a church of the living
[2:38:46] God, we can declare this is our season.
[2:38:49] This is our time. Uh, it's a new day.
[2:38:52] It's a new season. It's a new hour. It's
[2:38:54] a new dispensation. And Father, let the
[2:38:57] fire fall.
[2:39:00] Father, we are under expectation for the
[2:39:02] rustle in the malberry tree. We are
[2:39:04] under expectation to see the sick heal.
[2:39:07] We have been sick for too long. We have
[2:39:09] been depressed for too long. We have
[2:39:10] been up and down for too long. But your
[2:39:12] promise there's a power coming into the
[2:39:14] church and that's now coming in uh when
[2:39:17] they'll speak the word uh and it'll
[2:39:19] flash like lightning. So, Father, may
[2:39:22] that power rest on positionally placed
[2:39:24] sons as we prepare for the convention.
[2:39:27] May we rise from faith to fate. May we
[2:39:29] rise from glory to glory. May the
[2:39:32] standard bear users. Uh he said when the
[2:39:34] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[2:39:36] would raise a standard. May you raise a
[2:39:38] standard here this morning. May you
[2:39:40] raise a standard in our homes this week.
[2:39:42] Uh may you raise our standard as every
[2:39:44] day comes down to the convention. May
[2:39:47] this island shake under the power of the
[2:39:49] Holy Ghost. Uh may the epicenter of a
[2:39:52] move of God uh be sparked in this island
[2:39:55] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we
[2:39:57] pray. May you bless those that are
[2:39:59] planning. May you bless those that are
[2:40:01] part of the process. May you bless those
[2:40:02] that are preparing to travel into the
[2:40:04] country. More father, may all be well uh
[2:40:07] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Uh
[2:40:09] we commit your people into your hands.
[2:40:12] May you bring us back at the appointed
[2:40:13] time. And the church says and the church
[2:40:16] says amen. You may be seated
[2:40:21] for a few
[2:40:23] a few announcements.
[2:40:29] like to welcome Andrea Ross invited by
[2:40:32] sister June Renhead. God bless you.
[2:40:34] Welcome. Happy to have you here with us.
[2:40:38] Also like to welcome Nicholas Castillo
[2:40:41] invited by brother Steven Oliver. God
[2:40:42] bless you Nicholas. Thank you for
[2:40:44] coming. Trust you were blessed.
[2:40:48] So for some announcements,
[2:40:51] uh
[2:40:53] there are only two services before the
[2:40:55] convention. So service continues this
[2:40:58] Wednesday
[2:40:59] at 8:00 p.m. here at the tabernacle.
[2:41:01] There will be no service this Friday and
[2:41:04] we just have this Sunday ahead before
[2:41:07] the convention. The countdown is on. We
[2:41:10] have arrived. So we are under great
[2:41:12] expectation. So, if you could be here
[2:41:14] this coming Wednesday night, make every
[2:41:16] effort to be here this coming Wednesday
[2:41:18] night. And this coming Sunday will be
[2:41:20] our last service before the convention
[2:41:25] 2025.
[2:41:27] And we are looking for the entire church
[2:41:30] to be active in the convention. Call
[2:41:32] somebody, invite somebody, encourage
[2:41:34] somebody. It's an open convention. And
[2:41:37] we are looking for God to do great
[2:41:38] things. We are not having a convention
[2:41:40] to promote man to promote an agenda but
[2:41:44] it's for God to get the glory and by the
[2:41:46] leadership of the Holy Spirit. Some have
[2:41:49] asked what's the theme of the
[2:41:50] convention. The theme is what the Lord
[2:41:51] wants the theme to be. The ministers
[2:41:54] will speak what the Lord places on their
[2:41:56] hearts by the revelation that God give
[2:41:58] them and the uncction so that God could
[2:42:00] do what he wants to do for the body of
[2:42:03] believers that will be gathered here
[2:42:04] physically and those that will be
[2:42:06] connected online as well. So once more
[2:42:10] service just this Wednesday and this
[2:42:12] Sunday coming and then of course next
[2:42:14] week Lord willing we'll have the
[2:42:15] convention maintenance group two is
[2:42:18] carded to serve today which is brother
[2:42:20] Joel Straker's group and next week Lord
[2:42:23] willing group one which is but a
[2:42:24] popwell's group registration for
[2:42:27] conventions meal for convention meals
[2:42:29] continue today uh I believe the menu is
[2:42:32] on the notice board downstairs so we'd
[2:42:34] like a prompt response for that for
[2:42:36] planning purposes
[2:42:38] so we could be ahead of the curve as it
[2:42:40] were. Convention dates have been placed
[2:42:43] in the WhatsApp group as well as on our
[2:42:47] social channels. And just for a reminder
[2:42:50] to us, July 18th, 19th, and 20th, we are
[2:42:54] looking for your continued support in
[2:42:56] prayer, in time, and in any way you can
[2:42:58] in financial support. And we thank you
[2:43:01] for your continued support. There will
[2:43:04] be a meeting after service. I'd like to
[2:43:07] see all the deacons, all of the ushers,
[2:43:10] all of the trustees, as well as the park
[2:43:13] in attendance. And there'll be a few
[2:43:15] other things happening there as well.
[2:43:18] So, we do have some housekeeping. Uh so
[2:43:20] as the technicians wind down the stream
[2:43:24] and we prepared
