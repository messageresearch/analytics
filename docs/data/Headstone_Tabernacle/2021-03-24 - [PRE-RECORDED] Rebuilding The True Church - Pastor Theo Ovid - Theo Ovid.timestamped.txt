[14:18] uh special service this morning and next
[14:20] week and um
[14:22] i'll let you know praise god so our
[14:25] title rebuilding
[14:26] the true church rebuilding the true
[14:29] church
[14:30] and have an inspiration setting the
[14:32] church in order
[14:34] for the appoint of the spirit setting
[14:36] the church in order
[14:38] for your point of the spirit or the
[14:40] lattering or the
[14:43] and all dynamics want to see at the
[14:44] church have to be set in order
[14:47] for god to outpour the dynamics the
[14:49] spirit
[14:50] the lattering because the lattering is
[14:52] promised the fall
[14:53] if it says seed you see rain if you say
[14:55] word you say spirit
[14:57] praise god but something is coming down
[15:00] it's coming down it's coming down it's
[15:02] coming down
[15:03] hallelujah nobody could stop it from
[15:05] coming down praise god daniel saw a
[15:07] stone cut out without the hands of man
[15:09] you see that stone that's coming man not
[15:11] gonna cut that one out
[15:13] that's the different stone the coming of
[15:15] the headstone closes the gentile
[15:17] dispensation
[15:18] hallelujah that stone that was rejected
[15:21] that stone comes back to close off the
[15:22] gentile dispensation
[15:24] because god has to go back to the jews
[15:26] but before you go back to the jews
[15:27] there's a bunch of people you've got to
[15:29] seal
[15:30] because the death angel is moving the
[15:32] decision of a sniper weapon
[15:34] he has taken out all that don't have
[15:37] that
[15:37] mark all that don't have that seal
[15:40] he's not asking if you believe brother
[15:42] branham he's not asking if he believes
[15:44] the message
[15:45] he's not even asking what church you go
[15:47] to all he wants is the mark
[15:49] he is really talking to the mac he is
[15:51] only looking for the map
[15:53] he's not asking what you believe he only
[15:55] want to know is if you got that
[15:57] mark because in the last days there's
[15:59] going to be two kind of people on the
[16:01] earth
[16:01] one with a mark and one without oh glory
[16:04] to god and the devil receive all
[16:07] except those whose names written in the
[16:09] lamb's book of life
[16:11] before the foundation of the world
[16:13] russia is flying
[16:14] all over making test runs for war there
[16:17] is going to be another war
[16:19] there is going to be a third world war
[16:21] the war is coming
[16:23] you can't stop it and i can't stop it
[16:25] there is no way out
[16:27] there is one way that's up and that's
[16:29] why we come to church this morning
[16:31] to know how we gonna get out how we
[16:35] going to get up
[16:36] we come here for preparation we come
[16:39] here to know how to prepare
[16:41] because the bible says his wife had made
[16:43] us already
[16:44] you could know the death of the coming
[16:46] of the lord you could know the hour of
[16:48] the coming of the lord if you're not
[16:50] ready if you're not prepared you are
[16:52] wasting your
[16:54] time praise god you've got to be ready
[16:57] and if we come to church and we are not
[17:00] changing
[17:00] and we are not being ready we are
[17:02] fooling ourselves
[17:04] how we are wasting our time we have
[17:08] wasted
[17:08] years but that's not what my bible said
[17:11] my bible said everything that can be
[17:13] shaken will be
[17:15] shaken that the things that cannot be
[17:17] shaken
[17:18] merry men let the shaking begin
[17:22] because we are standing on the rock of
[17:25] revelation upon this rock
[17:28] i will build my church and the
[17:31] gates of hell will never prevail against
[17:35] it
[17:36] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[17:39] praise god glory
[17:43] glory hallelujah

[18:44] it was god that draw you and took you to
[18:47] the waters to get baptized
[18:49] to be identified with the dead burial
[18:52] and resurrection of jesus christ
[18:55] which man could touch you now which man
[18:58] can interrupt
[18:59] no wonder the bible said come i will
[19:02] show you the bride
[19:03] the lamb's wife you're not a wife of a
[19:06] man
[19:07] you don't belong to a man you belong to
[19:10] god
[19:10] the privacy that his wife had made
[19:13] yourself
[19:14] ready there's going to be a people
[19:16] that's calling
[19:17] me already
[19:26] hallelujah hallelujah

[19:33] that's gonna be made
[19:36] ready
[19:39] oh my good to feel the fire of your
[19:43] faith
[19:44] it's good to feel the anointing in the
[19:46] camp
[19:47] my god i'll be a dead man without this
[19:50] glory
[19:54] [Applause]

[20:22] a true revelation of the true church and
[20:25] on this morning
[20:26] the rebuilding of the true church you
[20:28] say what are you saying better of it
[20:30] are you saying the church must be
[20:31] rebuilt that's right unc
[20:34] church yet the glory the glory
[20:38] this glory will be greater than the
[20:41] former glory
[20:43] if you think that was glorious under the
[20:45] ministry of the word
[20:47] wait till you break into the ministry
[20:51] of the spirit not by might
[20:54] not by power but by my
[21:00] spirit
[21:07] [Applause]
[21:11] you mean we already got started yet no
[21:18] if you talk to the seed you will get the
[21:20] answer
[21:21] you talk to the seed seed when you're
[21:23] going going great
[21:25] i'm just waiting under here see you're
[21:29] undercover that's right
[21:31] i'm under silence nobody knows i'm here
[21:34] they can't see me they can't hear me but
[21:37] in me have all
[21:39] all what i have to produce sealed up
[21:42] i'm sealed i can't change who i am
[21:46] i can't change what i am i can't change
[21:49] my purpose
[21:51] it's too late it's too late
[21:54] it's just too late hallelujah
[21:58] i am not what i'm supposed to be yet
[22:03] come on now come on now
[22:15] don't let your temper get you down don't
[22:17] let your struggles get you down your
[22:19] trials your failure don't let that get
[22:21] you down
[22:23] you're not you're not just there yet
[22:25] just seed
[22:26] if the seed could talk seeker said laugh
[22:29] at me
[22:30] i'm still a seed hallelujah good seed
[22:34] true seed just just laugh just laugh
[22:37] the seed can stay there for years and
[22:39] let the world laugh
[22:41] but one day one day when that rain
[22:46] when that spirit when that power
[22:50] we're not anointed when that glory
[22:53] strikes
[22:54] that sea everything that was locked up
[22:59] everything that was sealed up everything
[23:01] was planted inside of you
[23:04] will come forth
[23:18] [Music]
[23:20] hallelujah
[23:25] [Applause]
[23:31] there is reason why churches feel
[23:35] the reason why group fails men feel
[23:39] there's a reason
[23:40] for that the reason why
[23:43] some fail and some succeed
[23:47] and we have to look closely at god's
[23:50] plan and purpose for the church
[23:53] because all man systems
[23:56] note that word system must run out
[24:00] and must fail god had the pillar of fire
[24:05] above them by day
[24:06] amen cloud by night
[24:10] when the pillar of fire moved israel
[24:11] moved
[24:13] nobody'll tell them should we move now
[24:15] the pillar fire was moving
[24:18] and you wouldn't want to be without that
[24:20] because that brought them out
[24:23] that that that is who handled pharaoh
[24:25] and his army and horses
[24:27] so you really don't want that to go
[24:28] ahead of you or leave you back
[24:31] so when the pillar fire moved in no time
[24:33] to move
[24:34] everybody knew it was time to move
[24:37] nobody could pray super spiritual i feel
[24:39] it let the pray today
[24:41] that can't work you have to move pick
[24:45] your package and move
[24:47] because the pillar fire is moving
[24:50] oh glory to god israel was supposed to
[24:54] know
[24:55] that that was god up there that was god
[24:57] above us
[24:58] in the fatherhood representing something
[25:01] above them
[25:02] more than them distinguished from them
[25:06] no man in this thing it was a god thing
[25:10] the people knew that fire was god
[25:12] almighty oh the angel of the lord
[25:16] leading them so it was an astonishing
[25:18] thing
[25:19] for you to ask for a man to be king
[25:24] and the prophet lament what you're
[25:26] asking for
[25:29] god is your king
[25:31] [Applause]
[25:33] why do you want to humanize
[25:37] the kingdom of god why do you want to
[25:40] bring it down
[25:41] to a flesh level when the supernatural
[25:45] is in your midst
[25:46] [Applause]
[25:51] and god told samuel they have not
[25:53] rejected you
[25:55] they have rejected me because i am their
[25:58] king
[25:59] he was going to bring on david at his
[26:02] appointed time
[26:03] but they look around and show what
[26:05] others have and that's the first era
[26:07] people make
[26:08] look around and see what this one have
[26:10] and what that one is doing
[26:12] and what that one is doing because once
[26:15] you start to look around and compare
[26:17] yourself
[26:17] and you are unique you can't be compared
[26:20] with nobody else
[26:21] your purpose is unique you cannot be
[26:24] used like
[26:25] nobody else stop comparing
[26:29] stop looking around to see what this one
[26:32] is doing
[26:32] and what that one is doing what you have
[26:35] to be concerned with
[26:36] is the will of god for your life being
[26:40] interpreted to you
[26:42] by revelation and inspiration
[27:02] take that
[27:06] you want somebody to worship you want
[27:08] somebody to lift up you want somebody to
[27:11] super honor wholesale soul is a stop gap
[27:15] measure
[27:16] because i have appointed myself and
[27:18] david amen
[27:21] god purposed to have david amen to sit
[27:24] on that room
[27:25] and what purpose have to be accomplished
[27:30] [Applause]
[27:32] so soul start off good no saul didn't
[27:35] start a battle
[27:36] nobody said so bad especially when they
[27:39] get anointed
[27:43] but sometimes things just go wrong and
[27:46] things go
[27:46] off track and god have to get people
[27:49] back on track
[27:50] this is the history of israel a people
[27:53] led by god
[27:55] backslid god send them into bondage they
[27:57] repent god bring them out and say my
[27:59] people

[28:03] backside

[28:06] go in that way

[28:11] because you have to understand the laws
[28:12] of god demand
[28:14] certain things hallelujah certain
[28:16] results
[28:18] oh glory to god amen hallelujah
[28:21] and i just want to bring this about
[28:23] joshua joshua one email
[28:26] because i'm with you joshua no man shall
[28:28] be able to stand before thee

[28:32] with moses i'll be with you
[28:34] i will not fail you i'll be with you
[28:38] be strong and have a good courage that's
[28:40] joshua one
[28:41] what happened joshua said
[28:45] in joshua 7 they say the king her eye is
[28:47] next door because
[28:48] they don't handle jericho already so the
[28:50] victorious them guys getting extra juice
[28:52] i want we don't want to use a good drink
[28:54] they're getting extra juice for victory
[28:57] isn't that right they have the victory
[28:59] they're feeling good and powerful they
[29:01] run up at confidence we just need three
[29:03] thousand men or whatever they're gonna
[29:04] take
[29:04] i is small thing and they go on with i
[29:08] and everybody expect to hear the victory
[29:09] show and only see men running down the
[29:12] mountain
[29:15] when joshua saw that
[29:18] 36 men dead
[29:22] the israel running from their enemies
[29:26] joshua say good what is this
[29:30] remember joshua 1.
[29:34] god joshua can tell god that remember
[29:36] your short one
[29:38] and got your lament joshua bowen is here
[29:41] joshua
[29:42] crying then god tells joshua i am not
[29:44] with you
[29:46] amen and i will not be with israel until
[29:49] you get this
[29:50] cursed thing out yes yes
[29:54] now this is the god that i serve
[29:59] i don't know about the message god that
[30:01] they have
[30:02] but this god is he's a god of justice of
[30:05] judgment of his
[30:06] word keeps his word of righteousness
[30:10] and keeps his words of judgment even
[30:12] though he told joshua that in joshua 1
[30:15] in joshua 7. now joshua did no wrong
[30:17] amen that's right
[30:18] joshua i didn't do anything god didn't
[30:21] ask joshua if he did anything
[30:23] the law was broken something went
[30:26] off-key
[30:28] and judgment was the effect of that
[30:31] going off key
[30:32] then joshua had the task of finding out
[30:39] i didn't mean to go down here this
[30:40] morning but i'm there already
[30:43] he called tried by tribe family by
[30:47] family
[30:48] man by man to get down to the individual
[30:51] that did this cursed thing and when they
[30:54] finished
[30:55] they stoned him akan and his entourage
[31:01] they've stoned eaton and all the
[31:04] connection
[31:05] with that that deed
[31:08] oh hallelujah could we say amen this
[31:11] morning
[31:13] do you understand how we have to go back
[31:14] to the bible
[31:16] and not back to your feelings come on
[31:18] now
[31:20] do you understand you cannot go back
[31:24] how it was and how this group do it and
[31:26] how this pastor did it
[31:28] i said something unity must not
[31:31] cannot and should not break sovereignty
[31:35] every church is sovereign the prophet
[31:39] said so
[31:40] the reason he said that is that the
[31:42] popes wouldn't come in and move in
[31:49] once that suffinity is broken watch for
[31:52] the popes
[31:53] archbishops bishops lieutenant
[31:55] lieutenants you name them they come in
[31:58] because they structure and hierarchy to
[32:00] govern people
[32:01] man-made slaves god made man god never
[32:04] ordained man the rule man
[32:05] [Applause]
[32:08] god said let us make man in our room and
[32:11] only imagine like this and let that man
[32:12] of the men over the fishes over the bees
[32:14] over the birds
[32:16] he never said man over man
[32:19] give the lord a shout and praise every
[32:22] creeping thing that creeped upon the
[32:24] face of the earth
[32:30] and before god could give manpower
[32:34] over others and other things a man must
[32:36] have power over himself
[32:39] i'm not hearing you this morning
[32:41] therefore they have to come a test
[32:44] that proves you have power over your
[32:46] tongue
[32:47] over your attitude over the lust of the
[32:49] eyes
[32:50] over your temper come on now over the
[32:52] lusts of the flesh
[32:53] over the pride of life over women over
[32:57] money over popularity god has to give
[33:00] that
[33:00] test and you have to overcome
[33:07] and if you ain't get the test yet it's
[33:09] coming it's coming it's coming it's
[33:12] coming
[33:15] let me say that again it's coming it's
[33:16] coming it's coming
[33:18] are you brothers anymore to say that
[33:20] first they're still coming
[33:23] god the test is what's going to bring
[33:24] out the best out of you isn't that right
[33:28] so brother branham was his son a man
[33:33] the message he brought was the messiah
[33:36] and jehovah of the old is jesus of the
[33:40] new
[33:40] year came into that prophet and spoke
[33:43] his own words
[33:45] not brother branham spoke jesus
[33:49] spoke through that prophet
[33:52] spirit given words that's why the
[33:55] prophet said the spirit
[33:57] and the prophet and the bride will have
[34:00] to say come
[34:01] we have to be able to say this is that
[34:05] that the prophet speaker not this is
[34:08] that a brother from england speaker
[34:10] no this is that that the prophets
[34:13] speak of we have to vindicate malachi 4
[34:16] we have to confirm the prophecy because
[34:19] if peter didn't step out and say this is
[34:21] that
[34:22] it's just tongue jabbering people when
[34:24] they're speaking in tongues
[34:26] but when peter step out and say this is
[34:28] that that the prophet joel speak of
[34:31] that makes a whole different thing
[34:33] altogether
[34:34] because now you're identifying the
[34:37] prophecy
[34:38] that the church supposed to have and we
[34:41] supposed to be under
[34:42] prophetic utterance we supposed to be
[34:45] inside a prophetic vision
[34:47] we supposed to see where we are going
[34:51] that we can know how we are getting
[34:53] there
[34:54] and how yeah we are to target
[35:04] i'm trying to get started here whoa
[35:07] israel was just two days journey
[35:10] on the promised land my god little did
[35:14] they know they were 40 years away
[35:16] two days convert to 40 years
[35:20] because of behaviors because of
[35:22] attitudes
[35:23] because of unbelief two days convert of
[35:26] 40 years and people were expecting the
[35:29] millennium in this message a long time
[35:30] now
[35:31] they want god to take them all to the
[35:33] troubles nobody knows
[35:34] the trouble i've seen but you're not
[35:36] changed yet nobody knows but jesus
[35:39] but you need character nobody knows the
[35:42] trouble of seeing
[35:43] you want to get out your troubles i
[35:44] don't want to get out of trouble i want
[35:46] to overcome
[35:48] i want to be like him i want to leave
[35:51] some smoke in the devil's face
[35:53] before leaving here
[35:58] that's what we are talking about
[36:01] who want to die and go over yonder we'll
[36:03] die and go over yonder
[36:05] but as long as i'm here above six feet
[36:07] i'm gonna praise him
[36:09] i'm gonna serve him and i'm going to
[36:13] give hell a shaken
[36:14] [Applause]
[36:20] are you thinking that they ever feel
[36:21] when you see soldiers walking near it
[36:26] i mean special forces you are special
[36:30] forces not only alone
[36:31] [Applause]
[36:33] god could choose anybody to be in this
[36:35] age with special men in this age
[36:42] [Applause]
[36:45] next year could be 40 years since i
[36:47] joined this army
[36:49] you hear what i said next year going to
[36:51] be 40 years
[36:53] since i signed up for my boots and my
[36:56] gun
[36:57] and my weapons oh glory to god
[37:01] i didn't get a pen i have to pee
[37:02] potatoes no i got a sword
[37:07] and right now it's sitting just right
[37:11] just right oh hallelujah
[37:15] i got a sword and you got a sword all
[37:18] god's children got
[37:20] short oh
[37:23] and we're gonna use the sword
[37:27] oh glory to god the sword is the word
[37:30] and the sword is sharper oh glory
[37:34] that's the word
[37:37] [Applause]
[37:40] an intense of the heart
[37:43] so therefore when that capstone
[37:45] anointing
[37:46] veiled itself behind william branham and
[37:49] spoke out spirit given words
[37:51] which man going to add to that or take
[37:54] away from that
[37:55] my god is a dangerous thing now to add
[37:57] or take away from what the prophet
[37:59] brought is very dangerous now
[38:01] oh hallelujah if somebody believes six
[38:03] seals they are guaranteed a front seat
[38:05] in tribulation
[38:07] no doubt they're not gonna miss the
[38:08] tribulation for nothing because six
[38:10] years you can't make the rapture the
[38:11] rapture is from under the seventh seal
[38:14] so at least you have the assurance you
[38:16] are guaranteed a front row
[38:17] in the tribulation period under the
[38:19] sixth seal isn't that right
[38:20] you have to you need a seventh seal you
[38:22] need them thunders oh glory to god to
[38:24] give you a faithful rapture in grace
[38:26] you need them seven thunders to gather
[38:27] their bride together they need them
[38:29] thunders to show you how to be pale
[38:30] you need them thumbnails to utter their
[38:32] voices you need them thumbnails to be
[38:34] the private revival
[38:35] you need those standards and those
[38:38] thunders
[38:39] is under the seventh seal
[38:44] but a man that adds or take away the
[38:47] bible says god will add
[38:48] plagues that's in the book to that man
[38:51] amen and if they take away take the name
[38:54] of the book take the name out
[38:56] take it that's dangerous
[39:00] whoa to come down 40 plus years and add
[39:03] to the world
[39:04] where you can't find where the prophet
[39:06] say those things
[39:07] that is dangerous i wouldn't want to be
[39:10] there
[39:12] i wouldn't want to be that that's why i
[39:13] strive to see what the team say
[39:16] my inspiration amen my revelation
[39:19] people love they say i can't preach
[39:21] that's fine i can't preach that's true
[39:24] trust he preached from me i'm a repeater
[39:27] i'm a quota
[39:28] people preaching freely without the
[39:30] quotes they don't need quotes
[39:32] and after 40 years so many believers
[39:34] don't even know their promises
[39:36] what they know is the pastor with the
[39:38] pastor teacher i heard a personal
[39:40] testimony of a man who said he went up
[39:42] to buy new canyon
[39:43] and a spirit enter into him no no
[39:45] there's another two party hearing now
[39:47] this is my one ears
[39:48] hearing this and i'm listening to spirit
[39:51] unto him oh he said what spirit yet but
[39:52] spirit unto him
[39:54] and the spirit tell him when you go back
[39:55] to your church go and open some series i
[39:57] say whoa
[39:59] it's a big thing now because by around
[40:00] 37 seals so this spirit tell them go
[40:03] back to your church and open some of the
[40:04] seas
[40:05] that's fine i still don't know what
[40:06] spray that is but then
[40:08] when it's at a break the first thing
[40:11] that break you don't need the holy ghost
[40:14] you are a seed of god
[40:17] you don't need the baptism of the holy
[40:19] ghost you are predestinated original
[40:21] seed
[40:22] from before the phone now that sounds
[40:24] nice and what he has now
[40:26] a bunch of people that know that they
[40:27] are predestinated from the foundation
[40:29] world
[40:30] without the oil amen
[40:33] because they have been taught out of
[40:35] expecting
[40:37] and receiving the holy ghost
[40:40] oh hallelujah they could sing well they
[40:43] have nice music they have hundreds of
[40:44] people
[40:45] nice church and so on but no oil
[40:49] oh hallelujah no oil no oil
[40:52] no oil it's a troubling thing when
[40:55] people take away the desire for oil
[40:58] but one songwriter said give me oil in
[40:59] my lamp to keep me burning
[41:01] give me all in my lamp i pray give me
[41:03] all in my lamp to keep me burning
[41:06] keep me burning till the break of day we
[41:08] need the oil
[41:10] there's only two the wise version and
[41:11] the foolish version
[41:13] one had oil and one did not one sat in
[41:15] church and one
[41:16] asking god for the fire asking god for
[41:19] the holy ghost
[41:20] one was content to have books on tapes
[41:23] one was content to belong to a group
[41:25] and belong to a church but the other one
[41:27] was hungering and twisting
[41:28] for righteousness and we have a word
[41:30] from jesus
[41:31] he said blessed that day that hunger
[41:33] enters after righteousness they shall
[41:36] be filled oh glory to god
[41:39] so what are you saying but all i'm
[41:41] saying the teaching
[41:43] of the message the letter of the word
[41:45] did not accomplish
[41:47] this church that god promised in the
[41:48] last days this church that joel saw
[41:52] this mighty machine army they didn't
[41:54] accomplish that
[41:55] the ministry of the world did not
[41:57] accomplish that but i am saying
[41:59] all what the ministry of the world did
[42:01] not accomplish the ministry of the
[42:02] spirit well
[42:04] oh glory to god that's what i'm telling
[42:06] you this morning
[42:07] and there's a prophecy that the church
[42:09] gonna be rebuilt
[42:11] so god's gonna get some rebuilders
[42:15] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[42:18] and that is where you're going to get a
[42:20] supernatural fightful ministry oh glory
[42:24] glory my my my my
[42:27] be saying something this morning oh
[42:29] glory
[42:30] you may be seated no there's a fifo in
[42:33] the body
[42:34] and there's a fightful out to the body
[42:39] i know you never hear that before amen
[42:41] think on that seller
[42:49] where is he going with that
[42:52] amen there's a fifo ministry in the body
[42:56] and there's a fight for ministry out of
[42:57] the body all claiming to be fightful
[43:02] but the ones in the body are those that
[43:04] pleased ah
[43:06] by god amen the ones out the body
[43:11] they have been elected and selected by
[43:12] man
[43:16] they anoint each other
[43:21] but the fifo that that god has to place
[43:24] positionally
[43:25] that anointing comes from god almighty
[43:28] [Applause]
[43:30] no man could do that
[43:34] one time a man wants to climb up in the
[43:36] realm but ram said listen
[43:37] go back down and testify it take god to
[43:40] put a man up there
[43:41] you could climb all the intellectual
[43:43] realm brother i have an amazing iq above
[43:46] others i tell somebody iq
[43:47] i'll do the holy ghost the sharpest
[43:50] brightest
[43:50] iq a man could have could never all do
[43:54] outwit outsmart
[43:57] the holy ghost
[44:02] glory i am not intimidated by the
[44:05] intellect of men
[44:06] on the contrary i see a big target i see
[44:10] fear game because i have a rock
[44:13] [Applause]
[44:15] god gave me a rock he gave me faith to
[44:19] handle the swing
[44:22] [Applause]
[44:24] oh this is good this is good this is
[44:26] good
[44:27] in other words don't play goliath around
[44:29] me
[44:30] hallelujah i will take your head off
[44:33] glory to god that's all because i have a
[44:36] rock
[44:37] a revelation god put that inside a tear
[44:41] that is why i am how i am
[44:44] oh hallelujah glory to god amen
[44:49] i'm gonna blow your mind up with this
[44:51] quote coming here
[44:53] hallelujah this is on paradox
[44:58] in paradox means incredible but true
[45:01] unbelievable
[45:03] boggling mind blowing here is bomb
[45:09] the same one jesus of nazareth
[45:13] would choose a bunch of ignorant
[45:17] fishermen for his church instead of
[45:20] well-trained priests
[45:21] on the nomination of that day how that a
[45:24] god
[45:25] that had all wisdom that could walk on
[45:28] the waters
[45:29] that could turn water into wine that
[45:31] could take five biscuit and feed five
[45:33] thousand
[45:34] take up seven baskets for left over hold
[45:36] that same one
[45:38] that god that sets an eternity under
[45:41] so bright till the sun hides their face
[45:43] from him
[45:44] the very pool of wisdom and purity and
[45:47] of
[45:47] understanding and knowledge supreme of
[45:50] supremes
[45:51] that he would come to a place where a
[45:53] great
[45:54] organization of churches had gathered
[45:55] together and trained all their men
[45:58] and he would go down and pick up a bunch
[46:00] of dirty stinking fishermen
[46:03] that couldn't even write their name and
[46:05] choose listen
[46:06] and choose that type of man to set the
[46:10] church in order
[46:22] oh hallelujah
[46:26] oh give the lord a shelter praise and
[46:29] this morning will be part one
[46:31] of setting the church in order for the
[46:34] dynamics
[46:35] because the dynamics of the pope the
[46:40] poor oh
[46:42] hallelujah hallelujah
[46:46] watch strange thing isn't it
[46:49] it look at least he might took somebody
[46:51] off stream
[46:53] he's the trainer he's the one who does
[46:55] it strange that he did that
[46:57] instead of taking church men he took
[46:59] fishermen to do it
[47:00] very hard but that's the way he does it
[47:03] it is true
[47:04] a real paradox when god took a bunch of
[47:07] ignoramuses
[47:08] as we call them today holy rollers poor
[47:10] of the world's good poured out the holy
[47:12] ghost in
[47:13] on them in the upper room instead of
[47:15] pouring out of these hydrogen council
[47:17] where all the telogen set where all the
[47:19] great men was
[47:20] we're the head of all the churches we're
[47:22] the ones that study the scriptures
[47:24] have made great school well trained
[47:27] waiting for the coming messiah knowing
[47:29] that they will be the one
[47:30] who would walk out and meet him and say
[47:32] messiah
[47:33] you come long as if on an airplane wing
[47:36] you sat down here in the temple step
[47:38] we've seen you coming from heaven from
[47:39] the golden call of heaven we are trained
[47:41] ready to go to work
[47:42] we got our schooling we got our phd we
[47:45] are all trained
[47:46] here we are 10 000 strong come
[47:49] we are waiting on you the in word
[47:52] already interpreted the people
[47:54] with men's idea intellect so the people
[47:57] are set
[47:58] expected to come that way expecting to
[48:00] come the way their pastors teach it and
[48:02] train it
[48:03] not hold the words speak it but instead
[48:05] of that he goes down
[48:07] and get a bunch of people that they know
[48:09] right and from left hand
[48:10] put them in the upper room pour out the
[48:12] holy spirit
[48:13] but abraham said oh god hallelujah
[48:16] hallelujah what apparently oh god
[48:19] upon a bunch of people like that instead
[48:22] of this hydrant council
[48:23] it pleased god it pleased god
[48:27] to make his own church a paradox
[48:32] are you hearing what i'm saying it
[48:35] please god
[48:36] to make his own church a paradox but i'm

[50:03] that's what you get when you do
[50:04] something more for the lord

[50:12] extra come on now let's get their hands
[50:14] going get your mouth activated
[50:17] glory lord god stop gossiping and start

[50:45] adoption is the book of joshua
[50:47] and joshua placing the people where they
[50:48] belong and if they couldn't stand still
[50:50] he put ephraim here

[50:54] still
[50:55] he put it from here and said he run over
[50:56] to marseille manager
[50:59] see this is where it becomes problematic
[51:02] because adoption is pleasing one call to
[51:05] raise oats one quarter is sheep one
[51:07] quarter is
[51:08] cattle different things that everybody
[51:10] iron that brother have a good corn field
[51:12] but i go and plant corn too
[51:13] yes but your land is for sheep your land
[51:16] is the main goat so man
[51:17] you see so so with all that revelation
[51:20] you find that lions getting tie up
[51:22] because you're getting a problem with
[51:24] other people blessing
[51:25] and other people blessing bothering you
[51:26] but that's not yours
[51:31] and as soon as you get the burden to
[51:33] understand where is my land that's where
[51:35] it's going where is islam
[51:37] you see you haven't asked that question
[51:38] yet but joshua thirteen said there is

[53:08] causing things to happen so when
[53:14] something happened in your home
[53:16] and you go down on your knees do you
[53:19] think the devil wants you to go along on
[53:20] your knees
[53:21] because that's how god will make things
[53:23] happen you have to set up a request
[53:26] god waiting to work but there is no call
[53:29] the application can't be possessed
[53:30] because he has not received no
[53:32] application
[53:33] when the people start to cry so and cry
[53:36] god said i heard it i heard it
[53:38] i heard it i heard it i heard it i had

[54:52] ever talked about
[54:53] he can't hear you that man throwing
[54:55] another gear
[54:56] he's got the strength
[55:05] now now now you may hear a natural

[55:53] because elijah talking things that they
[55:55] whispering in secret

[55:58] dimension where the air is open ah
[56:02] hearing you're crying
[56:05] i am hearing what you are saying
[56:08] i can see what you are doing because the
[56:12] word

[1:04:56] overthrown
[1:04:58] by men who have been around him that
[1:05:00] vision
[1:05:01] they have overthrown it overthrown the
[1:05:04] prophetic vision
[1:05:06] and they introduce their own vision
[1:05:08] their own inspiration
[1:05:10] their own revelation and it is off of
[1:05:13] the world
[1:05:15] hallelujah hallelujah

[1:05:49] church it has nothing to do with i being
[1:05:51] your pastor
[1:05:52] it has to do with the target it has to
[1:05:56] do with the goal

[1:07:48] and his love is perfected in us
[1:07:51] hereby know we that we dwell in him and
[1:07:54] in us
[1:07:55] because he had given us of his spirit
[1:07:58] and we have seen and do testify
[1:08:02] that the father sent the son to be the
[1:08:04] savior of the world
[1:08:06] whosoever shall confess that jesus is
[1:08:08] the son of god
[1:08:09] dwelleth in him and he and god and we
[1:08:12] have known and believed the love that
[1:08:14] god had to us
[1:08:15] god is love i need to dwell it in love
[1:08:18] dwell it in god
[1:08:20] and god in him hearing is our love
[1:08:23] made perfect that we may have boldness
[1:08:26] in the day of judgment because as he is
[1:08:28] so are we in this world there is no fear
[1:08:31] in love but perfect love casted out
[1:08:36] fear because fear had torment
[1:08:39] he that fear it is not made perfect in
[1:08:41] love
[1:08:42] we love him because he first loved us
[1:08:45] now if a man say here we go i love god
[1:08:49] and hated his brother he is a
[1:08:53] liar for he that loveth
[1:08:56] not his brother whom he had seen how can
[1:08:59] he love
[1:08:59] god whom he had not seen and
[1:09:02] this commandment have we from him that
[1:09:05] he that loved god
[1:09:06] love his brother also
[1:09:10] may god bless his word could we give the
[1:09:12] lord a shout on that one
[1:09:19] hallelujah hallelujah say in other words
[1:09:23] the devil can impersonate any gift amen
[1:09:26] the democrat in person in miracles but
[1:09:29] one thing i could guarantee you the
[1:09:30] devil cannot do
[1:09:32] is love
[1:09:38] and barbara said there will be no love
[1:09:40] left except
[1:09:42] amongst the elect
[1:09:51] he's so naive and deceived if you only
[1:09:54] say different to them they will hang his
[1:09:55] head off like isis and put them on a
[1:09:56] stake
[1:09:58] that love is based on saying what they
[1:10:01] say
[1:10:02] but if you say different cut your head
[1:10:04] off and put them in a stick
[1:10:05] like jihadist isis oh hallelujah praise
[1:10:09] god hallelujah but jesus said you have
[1:10:13] heard at all times hate your enemies i
[1:10:15] say unto you love your enemies
[1:10:17] oh we have to get dog in the wood now
[1:10:19] that's why we're getting down to
[1:10:20] business now
[1:10:22] wherever you are being preached love who
[1:10:25] hallelujah anyhoo no they're loving
[1:10:28] their own jesus rebuke disciples for
[1:10:30] everybody love the old this family love
[1:10:32] their brother and their mother and their
[1:10:33] sister and their wife and their husband
[1:10:35] everybody love their own pharisees of
[1:10:38] their own sadducees of their own isn't
[1:10:40] that right
[1:10:41] like i send somebody somebody to unite
[1:10:42] with me against something
[1:10:44] coming with me to me agreeing with me
[1:10:47] against something doesn't mean you are
[1:10:48] standing with me
[1:10:50] because you could unite to be against
[1:10:52] the same thing but that don't mean you
[1:10:54] are for the same thing
[1:10:55] because the scribes and pharisees and
[1:10:57] sadducees they didn't agree with one
[1:10:58] another
[1:10:59] but when jesus came they came together
[1:11:01] and former consul
[1:11:02] to unite against jesus because he was
[1:11:05] the word being expressed
[1:11:07] and they couldn't handle it
[1:11:10] so they helped us to destroy it and that
[1:11:12] was before the government could take
[1:11:14] action
[1:11:15] so before the press come down the
[1:11:17] so-called church in the church
[1:11:19] the so-called church spirit in the
[1:11:21] message have to come against the bride
[1:11:23] [Applause]
[1:11:24] before the government could come there
[1:11:27] to shut down the churches
[1:11:29] all the people of god so called after
[1:11:32] come against the elect
[1:11:33] then the phong fought with the man who
[1:11:36] was the word
[1:11:37] no divine fault with the word working
[1:11:39] through the man
[1:11:42] oh the word is gonna be in the bread by
[1:11:46] and through the pride
[1:11:47] will be fulfilled all that was spoken

[1:16:56] shunned culture
[1:16:57] when a pastor put a shot on you think i

[1:17:01] the amish they have a kind of shunt
[1:17:02] thing when when you do something wrong
[1:17:04] and they put a shine on you the people
[1:17:05] do like you don't exist
[1:17:06] you don't acknowledge it not emotionally

[1:17:10] and the only way to get back from being
[1:17:11] on shunned is to
[1:17:13] get back in line so these ministers
[1:17:15] think they're going to shun me and get
[1:17:16] me back in line

[1:17:20] me i'll never leave you
[1:17:22] nor forsake you i i don't need amanda to

[1:18:42] you may be seated i rejected this
[1:18:44] message culture a long time
[1:18:46] because i've seen myself end up in
[1:18:47] failure and i made a pledge to god in
[1:18:49] kaiwa with 12 people
[1:18:51] never to rule his people with rigor with
[1:18:53] force and with legalism
[1:18:55] in that kind of a way and i kept my
[1:18:57] pledge
[1:18:58] i kept my pledge i see pastors that
[1:19:00] control people's lives
[1:19:02] who to married when they're married
[1:19:03] everything else they read for the
[1:19:05] brandon books
[1:19:06] they see brother branham said he didn't
[1:19:07] get a preacher when he was caught in his
[1:19:09] sister
[1:19:10] he only went to church to escort a home
[1:19:12] he never heard his sermon
[1:19:15] because he was in love these jokers
[1:19:18] sitting in church
[1:19:19] and telling and letting him tell them
[1:19:20] who to marry who not to marry how long
[1:19:22] they stay and whatnot and also the
[1:19:23] foolishness
[1:19:24] and they say they believe this message
[1:19:29] man who's supposed to have grandchildren
[1:19:30] you know they married your name
[1:19:37] because i'm minister hold the light he's
[1:19:40] a guru

[1:19:54] everybody have the ubuntu
[1:19:57] it's just they have the spiritual turban
[1:19:58] right now must be can see it
[1:20:00] that message their lives are the peoples
[1:20:03] in their hands what the life of the
[1:20:04] people doing in some manhattan
[1:20:06] why wow
[1:20:12] brother branham said this
[1:20:17] thus saith the lord amen
[1:20:21] it will take perfect love to put you in
[1:20:24] that place
[1:20:26] no matter how much religious
[1:20:27] demonstration no matter how much good
[1:20:30] deeds you have done whatever you have
[1:20:32] done that won't cut
[1:20:33] nothing on that day it will take perfect
[1:20:36] love

[1:20:39] else until you are so filled
[1:20:41] with the love of god till you can love
[1:20:45] those who hate you

[1:21:01] amen but when you see you come to this
[1:21:03] spot

[1:21:08] anything you know that's that tangible
[1:21:10] thing you squeeze a business and put
[1:21:12] something from yourself and you say you

[1:29:09] hallelujah i want you to get this
[1:29:13] never let this slip
[1:29:16] if we only need the intellectual
[1:29:18] conception of man
[1:29:20] we don't need the holy spirit if the
[1:29:23] church
[1:29:23] is to be run on government upon
[1:29:25] intellects educational program
[1:29:28] upon the intellects of mankind we do not
[1:29:30] need the holy spirit
[1:29:31] and if it is to be run by the holy
[1:29:33] spirit we do not need intellectuals
[1:29:36] it's either one or the other now these
[1:29:40] five offices of this fifo ministry
[1:29:42] aren't called by the church and so forth
[1:29:45] they are chosen by god
[1:29:46] apostles prophets teachers evangelist
[1:29:49] pastors
[1:29:50] five spiritual offices
[1:29:53] in the church to set the church in order
[1:29:57] apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:30:00] those are called offices by god then in
[1:30:02] the local church there are
[1:30:04] nine spiritual gifts working among the
[1:30:05] people now in these
[1:30:07] offices and places in the offices you
[1:30:09] hear you hear from the apostle
[1:30:12] his ministry you hear from the prophet
[1:30:16] his ministry you know last week
[1:30:19] or so i spoke by inspiration it came to
[1:30:21] me the fivefold
[1:30:23] ministry is not corporate readers
[1:30:25] bandits
[1:30:26] and pirates of wherever they come from
[1:30:28] they are not coming to take over
[1:30:30] churches and say you know what i am i
[1:30:31] feel you know who i am
[1:30:33] i am part of the fool no we'll tell them
[1:30:35] get out they're no full business
[1:30:37] the fivefold is christ manifesting
[1:30:39] himself in these offices
[1:30:41] look what i find here and discover you
[1:30:43] are hearing from the apostle
[1:30:45] hearing from the pastor here you have to
[1:30:47] hear from them
[1:30:49] and their words and their message will
[1:30:51] bring the edification
[1:30:52] the strength the perfection from their
[1:30:55] ministries
[1:30:56] affected to the bride across the world
[1:30:59] so when somebody say connect to me
[1:31:02] to make it you know that is nico again
[1:31:04] that is contrary
[1:31:06] what the connection so far has been
[1:31:08] god's permissive will
[1:31:10] because once it breaks affinity it
[1:31:12] cannot be god's perfect will
[1:31:13] it's god's perfect will that every
[1:31:16] church be sovereign
[1:31:17] where it chews its deacons elders and
[1:31:20] the minister preached what god put upon
[1:31:22] his heart
[1:31:23] that is god's will that is how the
[1:31:25] churches was established
[1:31:27] in ephesus in paul's time that is how
[1:31:29] we're going to be in the last time
[1:31:31] one thing i'm convinced of the bride
[1:31:33] will not be manhandled
[1:31:35] because the bride is the wife of the
[1:31:36] lamb you can
[1:31:38] handle the church anytime but not the
[1:31:40] lamb's wife
[1:31:42] she will escape all the force anointed
[1:31:44] she will be
[1:31:45] the escape ones another people in the
[1:31:48] land
[1:31:50] that is going to be the pride oh
[1:31:53] hallelujah glory to god amen listen
[1:31:58] god had must allow some people to
[1:32:00] backslide
[1:32:01] to save them from this untoward
[1:32:04] generation
[1:32:04] and the religious spirits in this
[1:32:06] message because god coming to get them
[1:32:08] back
[1:32:09] glory to god hallelujah that was going
[1:32:12] to be lost
[1:32:14] in church but no you're not lost you're
[1:32:16] free
[1:32:17] that's why god could find the woman of
[1:32:19] the world
[1:32:23] she escaped the pharisees she escaped
[1:32:25] the sadducees
[1:32:26] she escaped the herodians
[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:33] you you you understand that you wanna be
[1:32:36] seated
[1:32:37] if she was a good pharisee man jesus
[1:32:40] enemy dinner
[1:32:41] we got along so she she long white
[1:32:43] version closing what nothing for a
[1:32:44] second
[1:32:46] make any tribulation guaranteed front
[1:32:48] seat to city tribulation
[1:32:50] but that sister was a rapture person she
[1:32:53] was getting caught up in the upper room
[1:32:55] the jesus told his serpents and needs
[1:32:57] spatula samaria
[1:32:58] them didn't know what he's gonna do he's
[1:33:00] going to meet a woman at the well
[1:33:02] her name is on the book i only come who
[1:33:04] the father give me
[1:33:06] that is one of them god gave me
[1:33:11] jesus come for everybody all that the
[1:33:14] father had
[1:33:15] passed and has given me welcome so he
[1:33:18] walked up to the woman and said give me
[1:33:20] the drink
[1:33:21] he's kind of feeding her out watch that
[1:33:23] seed she's in the condition he said you
[1:33:25] had five man and the man you're waiting
[1:33:26] not yours
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:32] you hear that
[1:33:42] no that had nothing to do with the plan
[1:33:45] of god
[1:33:46] jesus went beyond all what she had done
[1:33:48] you see that's what the blood does that
[1:33:50] that's the power of my
[1:33:54] my you're making me the dance this
[1:33:56] morning
[1:33:57] hallelujah that's what the power of the

[1:34:14] whoa could you take care anymore
[1:34:17] but i have a lot more for you
[1:34:21] amen amen
[1:34:24] hallelujah so watch each has
[1:34:28] a separate ministry so the glad the guy
[1:34:30] who claimed to have the entire fightful
[1:34:32] on him and people
[1:34:32] i guess believe that the entire fifo
[1:34:35] that
[1:34:36] is not what it's saying here each have a
[1:34:39] separate
[1:34:40] ministry okay and their ministry is of
[1:34:43] god
[1:34:44] and god has set them in the church for
[1:34:47] this purpose
[1:34:48] what is the holy ghost given for what's
[1:34:50] the purpose of the holy ghost
[1:34:52] it's to give unction to the preacher
[1:34:54] it's to give holiness to the group
[1:34:56] it's to set the church in order it's to
[1:34:58] bring the unity of the spirit
[1:35:00] it's to unite us together with power it
[1:35:02] is united together with love
[1:35:04] broadly love i don't care if you're a
[1:35:06] methodist baptist
[1:35:07] presbyterian lutheran whatever you are
[1:35:09] if we are all being
[1:35:11] one holy spirit baptized into the body
[1:35:13] and become a member of the body of jesus
[1:35:15] christ there's nothing present future
[1:35:16] starvation
[1:35:17] can separate us from the love of god we
[1:35:19] are a new creature
[1:35:21] oh could we give the lord praises
[1:35:24] listen to this ephesians 3 i'll read at
[1:35:28] verse 16 and he would grant you
[1:35:30] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:35:32] be strengthened with might
[1:35:33] by his spirit in the inner man that
[1:35:36] christ may dwell in your hearts by faith
[1:35:38] that he being rooted and grounded in
[1:35:40] love may be able to comprehend with all
[1:35:43] saints
[1:35:43] what is the breadth and length and depth
[1:35:46] and height
[1:35:47] and to know the love of christ which
[1:35:49] pass that
[1:35:50] knowledge that he might be filled with
[1:35:52] all the fullness of god
[1:35:54] no one to him that is able to do
[1:35:56] exceedingly abundantly
[1:35:58] above all we can ask or think according
[1:36:00] to the power that work enter
[1:36:02] in us unto him be glory in the church by
[1:36:04] jesus christ
[1:36:05] throughout all ages without end amen

[1:36:13] here we go may he grant you out of the
[1:36:15] rich treasury of his glory
[1:36:17] to be strengthened and reinforced with
[1:36:20] mighty power in the inner man
[1:36:21] by the holy spirit himself indwelling

[1:36:49] the height and the depth of it
[1:36:50] that you may really come here we go to
[1:36:53] know practically
[1:36:55] true experience for yourself the love of
[1:36:58] christ

[1:37:06] without experience that you may be
[1:37:08] filled
[1:37:09] through all your being into the fullness
[1:37:11] of god
[1:37:12] may have the richest measure of divine
[1:37:14] presence and become a
[1:37:16] holy filled and flooded with god himself
[1:37:18] now to him
[1:37:19] who by in consequence of the action of
[1:37:22] his power
[1:37:23] that is and at work within us is able to
[1:37:25] carry this purpose
[1:37:26] and do super abundantly far above above
[1:37:29] all that we could dare ask or think
[1:37:31] infinitely beyond our highest prayers
[1:37:33] desires hopes and dreams
[1:37:35] to him the glory in the church
[1:37:39] and in christ jesus christ all
[1:37:41] generation forever and ever
[1:37:42] oh blessed be the rock
[1:37:45] oh hallelujah glory to god
[1:37:50] and for my hearing on my seat he said
[1:37:52] that's the church if it's in order
[1:37:53] it's got the mechanic ready it's only
[1:37:55] needed dynamics
[1:37:57] and if we will get the mechanics ready
[1:37:59] watch get
[1:38:00] our hearts right so getting the
[1:38:03] mechanics ready means what
[1:38:05] get in your hearts right the things that
[1:38:08] we
[1:38:08] can do follow every word follow him in
[1:38:11] baptism
[1:38:12] follow him in every order he told us to
[1:38:14] do get every mechanic ready and stand
[1:38:16] there
[1:38:17] then we are ready for the dynamics to be
[1:38:19] let off and only god can do that
[1:38:22] only who can do that but we could do
[1:38:24] something
[1:38:25] if we can only get started then god will
[1:38:28] do the rest
[1:38:29] so the dynamics would come as a response
[1:38:31] to the action of our faith
[1:38:35] oh glory to god and this is where i got
[1:38:37] the inspiration from for this title
[1:38:39] the church rebuilding of the true church
[1:38:41] but about the message of grace
[1:38:43] he read that scripture we read this
[1:38:44] morning from zechariah not by might not
[1:38:46] by power
[1:38:47] he said we all acquainted with the
[1:38:48] scripture that reads the bible
[1:38:50] we all know that this was during the
[1:38:51] time of preparation of the restoration
[1:38:53] of the temple
[1:38:54] and zerubbabel was the great prince
[1:38:55] among the people who had laid the
[1:38:57] foundation of the building
[1:38:58] now i want you to put in your spiritual
[1:38:59] thinking anointing jacket this morning
[1:39:01] as we think
[1:39:02] this great prince had determined to
[1:39:04] rebuild the house of the lord
[1:39:06] and when he did he laid the foundation
[1:39:08] stone as we read on father
[1:39:10] we find out that god said the rubell had
[1:39:12] laid the foundation with his hands
[1:39:14] he also shall bring the headstone i want
[1:39:16] you to notice he never said
[1:39:18] he shall bring for the cornerstone he
[1:39:20] shall bring forth the headstone
[1:39:22] and we know that the scripture says
[1:39:23] jesus is the chief cornerstone
[1:39:26] he also is the headstone now if we will
[1:39:28] think for a few minutes
[1:39:30] here we go are you ready the seventh
[1:39:32] church messenger
[1:39:34] was to restore the fate of the children
[1:39:37] to the fathers
[1:39:38] in other words rebuild the church again
[1:39:42] under the power of the spirit not by
[1:39:44] power
[1:39:45] not by might but by my spirits here the
[1:39:48] lord
[1:39:49] not by organization not by denomination
[1:39:52] but by the holy spirit god will bring
[1:39:55] forth the church in the last days
[1:39:57] so all these groups around the world
[1:39:59] that's not the church yet
[1:40:03] because we have us to move from
[1:40:05] mechanics to dynamics
[1:40:07] from ministry of the world to means of
[1:40:09] the spirit so when the military of the
[1:40:10] spirit
[1:40:11] runs in effect then you will see the
[1:40:14] power of this church
[1:40:15] then but the problem says when the power
[1:40:17] of this church rises
[1:40:19] if we bring the brethren oh glory to god
[1:40:22] so what something which group is going
[1:40:25] to organize the power of this church
[1:40:29] it's foolishness which man going to open
[1:40:32] the pipe and says
[1:40:34] you know you want to have it i'm not
[1:40:35] gonna you're not gonna have it
[1:40:38] but i'm already prophesied when the
[1:40:40] power of this church rises it will bring
[1:40:42] the bridge around
[1:40:43] so there's a seed to bring the power
[1:40:45] jesus said destroy this body and trees
[1:40:46] i'll raise it up there was a built-in
[1:40:48] power in him
[1:40:49] he said i laid down and i will take it
[1:40:51] back up again
[1:40:52] hallelujah enoch mechanic what became
[1:40:55] dynamics
[1:40:56] with the spirit and god took him the
[1:40:59] power is already built in
[1:41:00] the power of the world have a life in it
[1:41:03] give the lord a shout of praise
[1:41:05] and the secret is the word and the pride
[1:41:07] we are already connected to the source
[1:41:09] there's a power already inside of you
[1:41:12] creator is he that's in you
[1:41:14] that's he that's in the world come on
[1:41:17] believe
[1:41:18] it that's nothing but the truth
[1:41:21] [Applause]
[1:41:25] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:41:28] on the guide this is after this such a
[1:41:31] perfect man
[1:41:32] said don't forget now remember these
[1:41:34] things that build the civil of christ
[1:41:36] faith first then virtue now remember the
[1:41:38] holy spirit here we go
[1:41:40] cannot cap the building of god until
[1:41:42] these things are
[1:41:43] operated by the spirit so he is saying
[1:41:47] these virtues are not just to operate by
[1:41:49] revelation
[1:41:50] he is saying they've got to come an hour
[1:41:52] where these things
[1:41:54] are operated by the spirit itself
[1:41:57] then you're going to be talking about
[1:41:58] the ministry of the spirit it has to be
[1:42:01] a life
[1:42:02] not just preaching mysteries
[1:42:05] oh come on now hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:09] praise god
[1:42:10] but abraham there's got to come in the
[1:42:13] last days
[1:42:14] a restoration of the church that by tree
[1:42:16] back there
[1:42:17] he said now watch we are waiting for
[1:42:19] something they're going to take the fate
[1:42:21] and restore the fate to the children
[1:42:22] back to the original pentecostal tree
[1:42:24] that the kangaroo eat up roman conqueror
[1:42:26] caterpillar all the nomination increased
[1:42:28] eat it down
[1:42:29] i will restore again in the last days it
[1:42:31] will be restored here we go
[1:42:33] god shall send the holy ghost

[1:44:58] you want that's what the people want
[1:45:00] that's what the american jewish want
[1:45:02] that's what the pentecostal they want

[1:45:40] i hate to see a something
[1:45:43] nominational puppet i like a man
[1:45:45] a god-sent man that stands on his
[1:45:47] conviction regardless

[1:46:19] that both gonna shoot those falls
[1:46:21] i'm screaming to you get out of here
[1:46:23] it's not because i don't like you
[1:46:24] it's because i do love you but the
[1:46:26] system that you are in
[1:46:28] will go to hell where it come from
[1:46:32] hallelujah what are we looking for
[1:46:34] friends
[1:46:35] the real church is not looking for the
[1:46:37] nomination he's not looking for a
[1:46:38] president he's not looking for a genus
[1:46:40] he's looking for a kingdom it's a
[1:46:43] spiritual
[1:46:44] mystical body of christ and in dear
[1:46:46] watch
[1:46:47] i love this they come out of
[1:46:48] presbyterian methodist pentecostal
[1:46:51] they are in this kingdom they are born
[1:46:53] in there they come in there by the
[1:46:55] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:46:56] and they are in this kingdom oh glory to
[1:46:59] god hallelujah
[1:47:01] hallelujah you are in the kingdom and he
[1:47:03] said there'll be no unrighteous there
[1:47:05] everybody in the kingdom they are
[1:47:07] kingdom people
[1:47:09] and christ is their king christ is the
[1:47:12] headshell
[1:47:13] he's the headship over the body which is
[1:47:15] his church
[1:47:16] [Applause]
[1:47:19] i'm going to come to the home church
[1:47:21] want a messiah
[1:47:23] but they want it under their own
[1:47:24] conditions they want a savior they did
[1:47:26] and they want it now the way the same
[1:47:28] way the same reason for denominational
[1:47:30] politics has taken the place of the holy
[1:47:31] spirit
[1:47:32] the ministers instead of too many of
[1:47:34] them are led by religious politics
[1:47:36] instead of letting the holy spirit lead
[1:47:38] them we ought to be led by the holy
[1:47:39] spirit
[1:47:40] god send a real leader of the church
[1:47:43] that is the holy ghost friends we are
[1:47:46] not promised a system
[1:47:47] jesus wouldn't have nothing to do with a
[1:47:49] system we wasn't promised a system
[1:47:52] we will promise a kingdom oh my that
[1:47:55] ache jacob and esau
[1:47:56] and he's so present for the buddha isn't
[1:47:58] that right the word must deliver a word
[1:48:00] by church
[1:48:00] the church has got to be delivered out a
[1:48:03] bride for
[1:48:04] christ there you are what system are you
[1:48:06] in
[1:48:07] just imagine if you would have lived
[1:48:08] back there in the other days under the
[1:48:10] jolting of god's prophets that was
[1:48:11] comfort
[1:48:12] what side would you be on back there
[1:48:14] well we got the same choice today
[1:48:16] she's fixing to bring forth the perfect
[1:48:17] wood back there the word coming to our
[1:48:19] word bride
[1:48:20] you say i taught you love people if love
[1:48:23] isn't corrective
[1:48:24] how are you gonna produce love love is
[1:48:26] corrective i'm
[1:48:27] zealous of god's church and when i see
[1:48:29] these systems that binding it down on
[1:48:31] the dogmas is
[1:48:32] rotten away and god declared his word to
[1:48:34] be true
[1:48:35] the word must produce a bride
[1:48:38] they were hated by everybody so
[1:48:40] therefore when god sent the prophet the
[1:48:41] church itself went in the good things
[1:48:43] the word of the lord comes to the
[1:48:44] prophet and him only is not right what
[1:48:46] was it
[1:48:47] back to the word back to the life
[1:48:49] systems doesn't have life
[1:48:50] it's only the word that has life systems
[1:48:52] are built around the life
[1:48:54] so around this seventh and the life of
[1:48:56] systems hallelujah that's not the life
[1:48:58] that's a system of wrong the life isn't
[1:49:01] that right
[1:49:02] praise god listen to this they brought
[1:49:05] to me for pilate jesus
[1:49:09] nicodemus came by night master we know
[1:49:11] you're a teacher come from god
[1:49:13] we know now cometh from god no man can
[1:49:14] do these things
[1:49:16] except god be with him who is he talking
[1:49:18] for the church the pharisees the leaders
[1:49:20] of that day
[1:49:21] we know we totally convinced the other
[1:49:22] person why then couldn't they do it
[1:49:24] because their system i wanted to soak
[1:49:27] real deep
[1:49:28] because i'm that's what i'm getting too
[1:49:30] the system that they have already joined
[1:49:32] themselves into
[1:49:33] was the one that could move though this
[1:49:36] did see that that was messiah
[1:49:38] but the system that they were connected
[1:49:41] with
[1:49:42] would not let them accept it
[1:49:44] [Applause]
[1:49:47] hallelujah so once you are labeled and
[1:49:50] the system say brother to you
[1:49:51] is off no evidence no proof once it is
[1:49:56] said
[1:49:57] the system conquers all the people to
[1:50:00] say
[1:50:01] he off how is he off how do you check a
[1:50:04] man out
[1:50:04] prove a man by way he stays
[1:50:08] with the world not by the way
[1:50:11] the system says
[1:50:16] so then the same way from but i'm going
[1:50:18] to judge them they can't come on
[1:50:19] judgement day and tell by
[1:50:21] god saying you know you know my passage
[1:50:22] i met that brother was off and i thought
[1:50:24] he was off and i
[1:50:25] i see him off no you wouldn't see how
[1:50:28] you judge a man but how he
[1:50:29] stays with the world there's no foolish
[1:50:30] age this is not blinding just the age
[1:50:33] god and a prophet
[1:50:34] with evening light we have 40 plus years
[1:50:38] people claim the word open up to them
[1:50:40] the right testimonies the understanding
[1:50:42] open up and they're seeing the word
[1:50:44] and what they're going to receive i know
[1:50:45] what happened they're standing closer
[1:50:48] it was testimonies went up about the
[1:50:50] understanding of the world opening them
[1:50:52] are they seeing it they're seeing it
[1:50:53] what are they seeing right now they have
[1:50:54] shades dark glasses
[1:50:58] any day time they're watching walking
[1:51:00] witches nighttime you're walking with
[1:51:01] shades
[1:51:02] they have been shaded off from the truth
[1:51:05] hallelujah because once the word opened
[1:51:08] up to you
[1:51:09] you are changed
[1:51:10] [Applause]
[1:51:12] understand this peter denied christ

[1:51:25] peter
[1:51:26] but when that word was open peter didn't
[1:51:29] look left
[1:51:30] no right peter was focused because
[1:51:34] he really knew what he was and what he
[1:51:37] was about to receive
[1:51:39] nothing couldn't show him off

[1:57:30] the seven seal message have loosed seven
[1:57:33] spirits to all the earth
[1:57:34] the prophetic vision that was sealed up
[1:57:37] to the seven church ages
[1:57:38] the prophetic vision has been restored
[1:57:40] to the church again
[1:57:41] like it was in the apostle church it's
[1:57:43] the restoration
[1:57:45] of the entire ministry of jesus christ
[1:57:47] therefore it had to include the
[1:57:49] prophetic vision

[1:57:52] which is a testament of jesus
[1:57:53] which is a testament which is a spirit

[1:58:03] they will preach by direct inspiration
[1:58:06] not only for telling
[1:58:07] but by direct inspiration like a nazi
[1:58:10] sapphira
[1:58:11] the apostolic pastor will be standing
[1:58:13] there preaching
[1:58:14] sin comes in the camp dom comes the
[1:58:17] mouth don't come the wisdom
[1:58:18] don't see the lord praise the name of
[1:58:20] the lord
[1:58:21] hallelujah do you believe that oh praise
[1:58:24] enough
[1:58:25] he said now watch the testimony of jesus
[1:58:26] the spirit of prophecy
[1:58:28] when the prophetic vision functions in
[1:58:31] the church again
[1:58:32] after the manifestation of tongues on
[1:58:34] their pentecost it
[1:58:35] changed from the pentecost to the word
[1:58:37] when peter said this is that
[1:58:39] isn't that right if peter didn't say
[1:58:41] that it would be confusion
[1:58:43] this ministry and that's coming now will
[1:58:46] show up the hypocrites
[1:58:47] expose them expose the false shepherds
[1:58:50] wolves and sheep closing it will pull
[1:58:53] down the heretics
[1:58:54] as god declared would be the letter of
[1:58:56] the word
[1:58:57] the tapes and the books and the hearing
[1:58:59] and the quotes has not accomplished that
[1:59:01] but the living word was spoken by men
[1:59:04] that don't fear nobody
[1:59:05] they don't fear anybody they got a mount
[1:59:08] they got wisdom oh hallelujah praise the
[1:59:11] name of the lord
[1:59:13] that is what the vision gonna do it's
[1:59:15] going to be a different ministry
[1:59:16] altogether
[1:59:17] such as the world i've never seen oh
[1:59:19] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:59:21] hallelujah i'm almost true but abraham
[1:59:25] he said i believe in the supreme
[1:59:27] authority of the local assembly let
[1:59:30] each church be its own choose its
[1:59:32] pastors its deacons
[1:59:33] whatever it is and the way the man there
[1:59:36] has no bishop over him
[1:59:38] the holy spirit wants to speak something
[1:59:40] to that church
[1:59:41] they don't have to ask anybody about
[1:59:44] whether they could do this
[1:59:45] or do that it's the individual in
[1:59:48] contact with the holy spirit
[1:59:50] show me by the bible what's greater in
[1:59:51] the bible than the local elder
[1:59:54] to a local church that's right the
[1:59:56] severity of the local church
[1:59:58] each church in itself no brotherhood
[2:00:01] that's wonderful
[2:00:02] all churches ought to be in brotherhood
[2:00:04] but the sovereignty of the local church
[2:00:06] hallelujah no man supposed to undermine
[2:00:09] the sovereignty of the local church and
[2:00:12] in some churches that is what being done
[2:00:14] hallelujah people are being sent to
[2:00:15] church to undermine the pastor undermine
[2:00:17] the local church
[2:00:18] they try to destroy the church instead
[2:00:19] of looking to save souls and get people
[2:00:21] sinners restored they're trying to
[2:00:23] destroy men who standing
[2:00:24] because they believe a data stand
[2:00:26] somebody must be destroyed the laborers
[2:00:28] are few
[2:00:29] the harvest is ripe and ready praise god
[2:00:31] there is no need for any man to destroy
[2:00:33] any man
[2:00:34] there is need to understand the devil is
[2:00:36] on the loose and every time i see a
[2:00:38] pastor
[2:00:38] preacher breakthrough i am feeling great
[2:00:40] about that i
[2:00:42] told those ministers in india i said

[2:00:55] inheritance and hear from god yourself

[2:06:57] are wrong
[2:06:58] hold on to the wrong thing thinking it
[2:07:00] is right
[2:07:01] and these things should be proven
[2:07:03] whether they are right or wrong
[2:07:05] it's the duty of all of us as we
[2:07:07] expected to go to heaven when jesus come
[2:07:09] and it's the minister's duty here we go
[2:07:12] when
[2:07:13] any question is brought up that he
[2:07:15] solves this
[2:07:16] out and then proves it before the people

[2:07:55] the holy ghost in the church
[2:07:56] it ought to lead us from all formalities
[2:07:59] and creates into a glorious wonderful
[2:08:02] baptism of the holy ghost where there is
[2:08:04] virtue and knowledge and godliness in
[2:08:06] the holy spirit
[2:08:07] that's what the real guide would lead
[2:08:10] oh god deals with individuals not with
[2:08:12] groups isn't that right you see he's
[2:08:14] trying to get one man he can get in his
[2:08:16] hands that will tell the truth

[2:08:19] pull no punches that will not be
