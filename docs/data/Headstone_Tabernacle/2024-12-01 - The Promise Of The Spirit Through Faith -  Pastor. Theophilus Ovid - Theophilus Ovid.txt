signs one of the Miracles we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you and welcome welcome welcome welcome to be here this morning if you have your Bibles I turn to Galatians chapter 3 want to read from verse one of Galatians chapter 3 for scripture reading this morning thank you musicians thank you sister in for that special thank you for all coming out this morning even though it's raining but God is good sometime we have rain sometime we have sun we need a rain we need a sun oh foolish Galatians Paul speaks who had Bewitched you that he should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ had been heavly set forth crucified among you this only would I learn of you receiveing the Spirit by The Works of the Lord or by the hearing of Faith are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that Minister it to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture fore that God would justify the Heathen true Faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying inde thee shall All Nation be blessed so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham for as many are of the works of the law are under the curse for this written curse is everyone that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Lord to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the J shall live by faith and the law is not of Faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them Christ ha redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written curse is everyone that HTH on a tree tree verse 14 that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith let's bow our heads father we thank you for your word and we pray a bless it and in our hearts in Jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated have title this morning the promise of the spirit through faith of a subject the Jos are live by faith and have an inspiration the fate of the fathers to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost amongst the people the fate of the father is to bring the power of the Holy Ghost amongst the people so this title is from that last scripture that the blessings of Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith so it's important you understand Faith being Revelation and you have to get a revelation to truly access the spirit amen praise the Lord andrah was praying in prayer he said Lord Jesus master of Life Giver of every good gifts by thy Grace at one time we were aliens cut off from God Gentiles working worship Him dumb Idols but in due season Christ died the innocent for the guilty and now we are Sons and Daughters of God it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know when we shall have a body like him for we shall seem like he is you see how Faith speaks Lord how we grown in these bodies to be clothed upon with immortality to be clothed upon with his Spirit we know that in the Old Testament the blood of bulls and ghosts could only take away sin it only it could not take away sin it only covered sin but waiting the paradise from one day that sin will be taken away but when Jesus came the Son of God the Messiah he took away sin he divorced it never covered it he took it away then now since then in this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have won waiting in glory we go straight into the presence of the father to be clothed in immortality this Earthly Tabernacle we were born in sin shape iniquity Comm World speaking Lies siners by nature but then God has redeemed us and redeemed our soul and has a blessed body waiting for us that will never be sick even above Temptation a body like his own glorious body did you get it a body that been never be sick you will be sick but this body we talking about it'll never be sick it will be above Temptation a body like his glorious budy then we will see him like he is oh give them some shout tonight this morning now father we approaching your word there's no man could open the book he is worthy and so on he says watch and now may the Holy Spirit Come and Get on these words that we have just read and may you speak today go right out over the audience here and May the Hool G give the church just what we have need of Faith Oh Glory to God May the Holy Ghost sweep over the audience and give us what we have need of which is Faith

green Briars and the stickers and the tongs and the root of bitterness and bring down the Holy Spirit oh give the Lord some Praises May the angel of God come and sweep over this building Hallelujah Give the Lord some Praises we have to praise God you know we not here to keep quiet we not here for some Demon to sit upon your mouth glory to God he's the high priest of our confession you can't live above your confession hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so last Sunday I believe Wednesday I believe I close up with this uh scripture from Hebrews 10 this is the Covenant I will make with them in those days sayith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more oh God will forget things you know but when he said he go for remember them no more it means he forget that clean it means he drop your sins in the sea of forgetfulness do you know if you to repent of your sin you're going to hell do you know have a place called hell do you know if you to repent and get right with God you go to hell not Purgatory know hell hell was created for the devil and his angels but humans go in there too because they connect with hell oh glory to God and their sins and iniquities will remember no more for there where there is remissions of these there is no more offering for sin then it starts here having therefore there therefore Brethren boldness that's how you are to be able to come to the throne every time not sometimes having therefore boldness hallelujah hallelujah having therefore boldness or full freedom and confidence to enter into the holiest of holies hallelujah hallelujah having a high priest over the house of God somebody pleading your case somebody sprinkling blood he offered his own blood Oh Glory to God when when the devil accusing you he said not guilty he said I died for them I shed my blood for them and the devil accused you he accuse you accuse you but you are free because the blood of Jesus Hallelujah come to release you and set you free Oh Glory to God a Christian come on a Christian have a right to be worshiping just go up a little bit more and praising God and worshiping God every time but some of us get too proud some of us feel we entitled some of us have believe that when you come to Christ everything is over you know start to fight we fight every day the just shall live by what just shall live by what you need Faith every single day you live by faith you walk by faith you talk by faith you Praise Your Hands by faith you say Amen by faith you come to church by faith you pay a tis and offering you do that by faith everything we do by faith I step in the Pulpit here by faith I preach by faith the J I live by faith not what your senses [Music] see praise the Lord hallelujah let us draw near with a true heart you see we have to become transparent transparent mean you could see straight through you you have no gu you have no hidden things you're open you to Fumble with your words well you trying to duck and hide and whatnot making excuses let us draw near with a true heart with the full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled with from an evil conscience on our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession our faith without wavering without wer without wavering and that is saying let us seize and hold hold fast and retain without wavering the hope we cherish and confess an acknowledgement of it that he who has promised is reliable and faithful to his word he that is Promised isn't that right he is faithful that promise is other words God can't lie God promis you something he will give it to you brother say if all sincerity approach God for something God will give it to him or tell him why

good to see you God bless you welcome back we miss you praise the Lord amen good to see you back in the house of the Lord hallelujah not forsaking the assembling ourselves together as the man of summons but exalting one another so much the more as the day they approaching not forsaken or neglecting to assemble together as Believers as is the habit of some people but admonishing warning urging

pray for them they don't want to talk to you that's okay you talk to God about them let God you let God deal with them oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there's a reason why the be Bible say let the weak say I am strong Satan need that don't want you to forget he said cannot live above your confession if you confess your weak you're real weak if they confess your cold you're real Co you belong to Alaska somewhere up there but if you confess praise God with your mouth I am victorious I am going to get a breakthrough I have the victory in Christ Jesus I can do all things through Christ which strengthen at me I am more than a conqueror I am more than an overcomer I have to overcome the situation praise God praise God laziness and no promise laziness unhealthy certain things are very unhealthy you know laziness is one of them and I'm not talking about physical lazy some people lazy in their mind your mind slow your mind your head I a say head hard you that's a next category but a lazy mind means lazy in thinking you have to be sharp because you need to be sharp in this hour remember knowledge shall increase total knowledge on the Earth right now I'm not even talking about chat GPT and all these artificial intelligence total knowledge is already in the earth easy accessible to any human being on this planet easily accessible so you can't afford to be dumb and stupid in this hour you can't be a foolish galatian you can't start in the spirit and try to get in the flesh you can't start and in the spirit and you want to get flesh to to to to vgate what stay in faith faith brought you who who convict your heart when you came to Christ is God is faith in your soul make you respond to the gospel no man didn't do that you're not obligated to no man you're obligated to God the god that called you because who he found you he called he only call it because he found you you now what the devil going to do about that he can't do nothing about that oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God let's go the word is the Messiah you believe that the reflection of the word then is what a reflection of the Messiah which is the Holy Ghost Among Us he's reflecting himself he tries to whenever he get a lamp he can look through that ain't smoke up with Creeds he can give the light through you see so therefore we can't put confidence in what other people say there's only one thing that you can put your confidence in and that's the word and the word is God that's why the devil don't want you to read a Bible or read any word want to read newspapers read politics everything else but this word because the devil know the word word is God this is God in print form you could take this and beat the devil literally Beat the Devil say it's written some thought come say it's written a liar what you talking to me for anything come out your MTH is a lie said do that say no you a liar Hallelujah I ain't working for you you didn't call me hallelujah hallelujah you have to deal with your own feelings I a feel to come to church today but let your feelings stay home but you coming feelings you you you take on that I going to church you have to bind your feelings you have to bring pull down imagination you got to take a hold of your own thoughts the devil flying it his job to inject you with thoughts the pastor don't like you the pastor don't shake your hand tell that he's a liar Jesus shaking your hand Jesus loves you oh give the Lord a shout you have to tell the devil even the pastor don't like you Jesus loves you I am loved by God oh give the Lord some praises you're fighting for your life you're battling with thoughts Hallelujah you're battling with caral devices you're battling with lust you're battling with temptation you're battling with all kind of battle Financial pressures but you have to fight the just shall live by faith oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah not live by flesh live by faith Glory Hallelujah glory to God Hallelujah so there the one thing we can put your confidence in that's the word and the word is God and the word anointed makes the Messiah so the Messiah is the anointed word so you come here to get anointed you come here to get anointed word not to get text or information or lecture you come here for the word to be inspired to you when you leave here you must feel inspired you must see to say where the devil where the devil where the devil looking for him you're looking for him now what binding me what Hind in me what's stopping me you have to be able

the temple and read the scripture said the spirit is upon me for he had anointed me so the word itself must be anointed Living Word written word spoken word has to be anointed then that becomes the anointed word of Messiah that's why we press here could come in the spirit oh my come earlier to pray up the service oh my hallelujah praise God so the Oneness of God is the word anointed in you then you become a son a messiah of the age and the highest Heavens hasten to honor Earth's most humble and unlearned the highest of Heaven came down to make himself known to the lowest on Earth they bypass all the common herds men they come they come to not the common herdsmen come to give these common herdsmen the greatest message of all time and the greatest message of all time was the what what's the message the Messiah is here now because the prophecy was he's coming he's coming Dynamic is coming charity is coming super church that's coming too doted son's coming power of God coming that's the prophecy for 50 plus years but all of a sudden he is here that's different oh G he ain't coming again he is here Messiah is on earth now Oh Glory to God if Messiah is an earth he's coming to your house oh go give the Lord a praise Hallelujah if Messiah is on Earth he is coming to your house oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah you still love Jesus amen all right so some bring it to church some bring it to a Creed this the best Church there the best Creed there the best teaching and so on so bring people to that and what I recognize now is that um people have been brainwashed so so now I catch it now in the message message people have been their brainwashed I was reading something from a wife somebody who escaped North Korea and they say as a baby as a child they teach them to hate America hate this all the action they get is to fight with toys hitting American soldiers and whatnot and whatnot they train indoctrinated and when she escaped she in London now and another guy in London too from North Korea he say it take a while to get this brainwashing off out of the system so I see now how people bind to their Church bind to their Pastor not to the word they really bind to their organization and church they have been brainwashed not with the word it have the washing of the Water by the word not that that's not that we're talking about now them them brain have been washed by something else it's not the word it's something else but the word because when you get your mind and your head washed with this all they could speak is this this is this is what it is not even my dream could show you off my dreams has get you think I B with that Satan no better than that is this the word you know my dream is not God the word is God you know oh the Lord I shout in the house don't let no dream Tire up you know yes sir so sometimes because are we born our brains is washed right we are brainwashed to say we are defeated we are brainwashed to think we can't make it we are brainwash and somebody said only Sinners only Christians remember your sin you know there a big one s remember he do this he do this pet CHR three times they don't think he can make it you know all time you can't make it you can't make it and when you get to the top his but shoot and shoot you from Over the Top all the time you're climbing can't make it friends I'm preaching these things and saying these things because you have to be stronger for what lays ahead you have to be sharper for what lays ahead and some of you just too laast in your head in your mind in your spirit you have to press harder than that don't even say you're tired you know was talking preaching I was talking about um when husband help wash words that doesn't count or you laugh I talk from experience wife all these years watch two way you I mean you looking for a book in a crown and that's that's regular you know that extra you know but I'm says what you do extra for God what you do normal what you're supposed to do that is not the real blessing you know is what you do extra do you do extra is when you do the extra service God can reward that oh give the Lord some Praises so I'm not talking just head knowledge talk from experience all right Hallelujah so they bring you to a Creed to Christmas you you see Santa Claus they bring it to church you see an organization but Christ these Greeks who say we see Jesus brought them to the Cross this is the Bossman now there's not no Pastor evangelist or or what this is Jesus the Messiah Serv we will say Jesus Jus say accept a corner we fall in the ground and die abide alone he said listen if you want to see me look at the cross so when you get a real disciple that will point you to Christ Christ you hear that a real disciple or a real Minister will point you to Christ Christ will bring you to the Cross where you are crucified with him so they not cany chicken when they come to Christ everything will be all right and no so blessed to be stressed is that special that's a song Somebody finish right yet that's not the word you come to Christ Christ pointed to the Cross where you are crucified with him and his eternal life and your life meets together your life dies and you take on his eternal life and then you are Son of God your life dies you repeat it again and you take on his eternal life and then you are Son of God what difference from a disciple of old and disciples today amen if you mention to a disciple I would love to know the Lord Jesus well look now we belong to a certain certain Church you know come down and join us because we don't believe like them believe up there you know we that that is what they pushing we belong to a certain Society come join but Christ himself this part I want to get to pointed people to his dead there's not the pastor there's not a prophet or evangelist or teacher Christ pointed people to his dead except a corner falls in the ground buys a loone how different it is how different it is but your life and his life find each other not at the church not in a building not in a Creed not in good works but in the cross where you are crucified with him where you find Christ you don't find him by doing better I'm going to do better that's not him turn on a new page I'm going to turn a new page that's not him start a new life you don't find Christ you find Christ only in debt now I know this is not the normal gospel thing that people likes to hear but we are not here you see politicians tell people what they want to hear not what they could do you know if the people want to hear this a lower taxes they see that a liar read my lips one time I man said that and he was lying from his lips read my lips so we are here to hear truth because the truth is what sets you free transparency Clarity what sets you free and who the son of man set free is free indeed oh glory to God so you don't find Christ in death not in a Manger not in confession to believe certain Creed and fables you find them in death you said then brother Brandon if Christ is on Earth today a real servant will take to him to him to Christ well Christ is here in the form of the word and the word brings life and I think that it's I don't know if people catching it but this word is God you know God is his own author he wrote this book two prophets everything inside of here sometimes SCP have compound meaning it's for that age it's for this age for this age it's for our age too that why Jus Clearly say as was days of Noah so shall be the days of the Common Man son of man why because him Spirit back there they leave leave those Spirits just jumping on people do you get that now so the same spirit that was on no it's here the same spirit that was on Sodom and gomorra is is here the people die but the spirit don't die it just jump on the Next Generation that why they could not get rid of sin and wickedness and evil and murder because the murderous Spirit they hang a man they kill a man they execute a man or whatever it is what Spirit upon Him jump on on somebody else it's a scary time isn't it but it's a glorious time too Hallelujah because God is dependent upon you and I that we wouldn't remain immature but we will accept the responsibility and the challenges that lays ahead for us you have a baby right one year two year the baby not a toy tell people that you know babies are not toys babies are grown men and women in baby form what they don't have yet is time babies do baby things you don't expect babies to do adult things children do children things they play they run and that's what baby do are the children D and something like that but these little guys in a couple of years they are adop and the same thing with the gospel the same thing with Christianity when you come to Christ like a babe but God expect you to be playing with pacifier and every minute go see pitching pitching pitching and you do hop scotch and you know what I mean hop scotch and God will expect that that is what children do when I was a child I spake as a child I acted as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I had to say put away say put away again one more time say put away there are things you have to put away oh give the Lord a shout in the house give the [Applause] Lord I'm not saying that because I'm saying you a child now but I'm saying even as an adults there are things we have to put away you have to put away the negative and accentuate the positive come on speak back to me somebody you have to put away how you see yourself negatively and say I'm fearfully and wonderfully made you don't have to be like nobody else oh give the Lord a shout you don't need to be taller you don't need to be shorter you don't need to be thinner fatter or whatever you are just how God want you to be oh give the Lord I shout I am fearfully and wonderfully made take that devil oh hear the Lord I shout in the house [Applause] so as children we are our basses we have the way we think and the we see things and so like that we sometime ago we preaching and talking about the queen and the children of the princess and princess and Prince Harry and whatever it is they don't know what they are they're born they're children they don't know somebody have to teach them you are royalty your father was a king your father was a king father father father father look look all the crowns there look all the Thrones there this Palace is ours this Palace from 1,500 years ago King Louis the 8 or 10 or all the names and Stu When the Children grew up in that just as those North Korean children are brainwashed to fight the West these royalty people have to be brainwashed too to get a understanding of their calling and placement so when they grow up is Lis and what the princess and princess and they grew in and they had cameras picked afterwards they accustom that did not say get away from me don't take no pictures talking a nonou that non Prince talking when they understand what goes on with their the pictures come normal everywhere they go the paparazzi every ton of pictures what that's job but they are called it's just like us we come into the word Catholic Baptist Methodist we come into the message then we have to be taught our brains have to be washed by the word to understand God call Baptist and make Baptist more maodus and more Pentecostal the word will produce Sons and Daughters of God we recognize Baptist produce Baptist because a Baptist seed Methodist will produce Methodist because a Methodist seed but this word seed produce Sons and Daughters of God so we are not Baptist we are not Pentecostal we are not Methodist we are not Jehovah Witness we are Sons and Daughters of God we are seeds from the book we are words of the book we come from the book we are children of the book Oh Glory to God we were sealed with the book this book belongs to us what's in this book is what is ours we can claim whatever Redemptive rights from this book healing is mine from the book Deliverance is mine from the book my family Deliverance is mine from the book Oh Glory to God I speak according to this book this book can't fail this book can't lie this book is God in print oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and I'm going to take God at his word the just shall live by faith and Faith come by hearing hearing the word of God so as the word of God is preached Faith could arise in your soul to believe for your healing to believe for your deliverance to believe for your breakthrough any kind of breakthrough not just physical breakthrough but Financial breakthrough emotional breakthrough whatever condition you have Hallelujah [Applause] you may be seated when we don't present things to God and lay it upon the altar we are actually saying God I don't believe you have the ability to deal with this so that is unbelief I'll say it again when we don't bring our issues to God lay our problems on the altar we are telling God I don't believe you have the omnipotent omniscient power to deal with what I have to deal with I am sentenced to this all by myself and God want to tell you you a big liar but you think you're Christian because you believe the word and you Comm church but you have a big set of unbelief subconscious unbelief not conscious subconscious unbelief that is unbelief and the background so he saying I believe here but he subconscious do so you ever tell a child something child want to eat this and child watch it give one of my grandson something he do that toughy and he just look at it don't want it subconscious unbelief now so when we have to repent and we have to repent every day there are things we don't even know that affecting us at the subconscious level we want to believe we want to hold on in faith but there's something hindering us and Bon talk about the subconscious is the real you that's the real engine that the heart the Mind know this is right the Mind know I'm supposed to the mind that's the mind but we have to get it to the heart now and when the heart and the mind line up trouble that is where Faith that's coming behind that and whatever you act you could have because everything in your system lines up your conscience and your subconscious and that is why I think it was I think it was last service yes Wednesday night I was say say it and say it and say it until you believe it I am healed by I'm Healed I am healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I read for you when the Propet was so sick every time he eat the food coming up he push it back down it

wife against him let me leave that one right there I done I can't make it no more the wife she cook for days I finish are taking time from church that weak man that weak son that not even a test that that you other words you have to be able to deal with rebuke with instruction with correction with God telling you a big fat no many of us just won have our own way and we feel God is a cad boy just get up from hey no Fellowship no relationship all could you imag you Uncle you father you have some cousin or somebody and all only time you see them is for them to get something from you every Christmas time just just for let it come look for you again I'm talking from experience as a child Christmas time you know you had to go and check this one and that one any time you go get and eat you get and drinks and so on and as long as it keep going like that the whole day go I used to be N I tell you I and you have Panda to get change and thing God bless you Merry Gentlemen and something like that but you see you see the thing about it is this that God want a relationship so when God tell us no we have to have the confidence he is right and he is protecting us from things we don't even know so I trust him I trust his no and I trust his yes sometime it's yes is not what we expect but it's a yes I trust his yes and I trust his no when God said no you don't have to go back and pray Lord are you sure that's what it is know unbelief talking there Lord are you sure is a no I turned his wife against him I turn his neighbors against him so if you don't have a wife you can have a neighbor turn against you I turn everything that didn't make a difference that's a strong Christian there's a tough Christian that didn't make a difference I said he said do he slay me yet I trust him so Wife Carrying on that they moving you the boss carrying on that they moving you the neighbors carry that moveing you nothing move in you the devil know you're like a rock you're like a flint you're like a Piller you're like a rock you cannot be moved okay that's the Christians God want for these last days [Applause] don't you slay me as I trust him let's go deeper I killed his family that mean death come on your doorstep the first death I experienced my was my father and Isaac was one year old and I remember that morning waking up feeling so troubled and S Jennifer called me and say you standing he say yeah sit down my father just died and I tell them the people my job my father just died my father are gone now that talk my father I just died only up here you know that every here is when I going home now and I begin to think about it it's had to go down then T come my eyes and I lift up Isaac as a baby and say he don't even have a clue what going on here now but I start to imagine my father Lifting me up like that here my father going I'm lifing up a son that is how I experience death as close as that there's some people who don't have that around them he I kill the family I took this now not saying this for me I just making a point I took this I did this I done this I did this that the other still he stood right up though he slay me yet I will serve him he is mine that's a good Christian if this whole church collapse if Grandy if trainer split up by an earthquake into a 100 pieces and you can't ever go to church you're still standing hear this part now this the part I want to get to now when the father in the Old Testament understood number one his son was come of Age Two he has been listen to this word seasoned out unto adoption seasoned out you don't take chicken and put you have to put seasoning on that you know why I see all these in India they going to a restaurant that food St so good so I ask them a call sent for the cook I say how how you do this chicken he said boy my chicken is marinate overnight then nice cook that so that no Quicky Quicky thing that was tting you know true and true that was good stuff marinate so sometime God marination about us is not overnight sometime it might take 20 years 30 years to marinate say sometime take 30 years for a man to get 6 months God have your dear maturing lightening seasoned onto adoption so when he ready to release you to the word he really no half crack crank he no man to shame him and embarrass him and let him down he's releasing a man that has been thoroughly tested a Time tested Memorial oh give the Lord I shout hallelujah hallelujah so much of ministers pastors all around the world dropping down like flies some of them have too much of money the money just knocked them out Cal overtaken by this overtaking by popularity overt by woman over all kind of like God must have true Sons the have be that dark it have many false prophets many false Christ it have to have true ones true Sons born Sons filled Sons not corrupt Sons not filthy Sons righteous Sons just Sons oh give the Lord a shout so he used these words seasoned out unto adoption he said they are born a child they are son right then but then there will be no more child just a ordinary son here we go until they mature and show what they are then he calls them out then so a man called up a 12y old a 14y old that son had to become mature we as parents have to try to see how we could manage that that our children become mature I remember telling a sister your daughter of age just know she had be out of the house that's she she make get M what not let her iron let her do this cook and whatnot that mother she with me later on when the daughter get married you know what the issue was cleaning and cooking marriage break under clean and cooking because some parents raise the children for themselves because they want control it's a power play to control the children so as long as they get each other inde dependent I'm in charge so they don't want to release the children that they could become mature adults the Bible say for this cause shall a man not boy he born a child he grew up but he becomes a man for this cause Shalla m not a mommy boy shall a man leave his mother and father not his mother come with them too not his mother overshot them with her mouth not a mother trying to bring guidance shall a man leave his mother and father and cleave to his wife and they Two Become One flesh hon we have a problem so son child ordinary son until they mature and sure what they are then God's called them out he going to place them Mana says you are over here Ephraim go over there then he takes him out to a certain place the father does he sets him on high place like this he has a ceremony they all come around and he said here we go this is God speaking I want everyone to know that this is my child and I adopt my son so this is not God H sh don't tell nobody yeah no this is not you talking this is the father talking I want everybody to know this is my son this is my daughter oh my Hallelujah I adopt my son and I want you to know from hence forth I dress him up on him I want to know his name is just as good on any check as my name is because he is my child I adopt him into my family although he was a son since he was born since he received the Holy Ghost he has been my son but now I'm going to here we go Place him in position in Authority what he fires is fired what he hired is hired oh give the Lord some Praises I have adopted the son after he is proven you know let me say a faith that cannot be tested cannot be trusted because a lot of people haven't been tested yet so you don't know if they will stand it's not that we don't like people and whatnot but if somebody come and you know you have to give them time to be seasoned out and get ripen oh my hallelujah oh glory to God so when Jesus come on the scene he was the manifestation of the word all right he was the manifestor of the manifestation of the word for that day now here we go oh this is the Meat part here now take the rest as rice and peas and salad coming on to meat now Hallelujah and now it's laid out it takes someone to come on the scene to manifest those promises faith in the call of God some point in time you as an individual have to have faith real genuine faith in the call of God upon your life in order to be in a channel to manifest what is Promised faith in the call of God because if you have faith in the call of God that call cannot be canceled preach back to me now that call cannot be cancelled it is impossible for that to be cancelled because it's God's called upon on your life oh give the Lord some Praises Moses running away from Egypt couldn't cancel that call Jonah running away from Nineveh couldn't cancel that call Paul fighting the Christians couldn't cancel that call that's a call upon your life that's a Divine call that's a Heavenly call that's a h that oh praise God praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said the church what kind of Messiah is the church looking for today he said they want some kind of B man and so on he said but we already got it God give it to us it's his promise for this hour that's the Messiah the promise for this hour God give us the Messiah his promised word for this day here we go that's the bomb

the woman trembling Jesus look at her he never said my virtue healed you he said thy faith who give the Lord some Praises she never got baptized in Jesus name but thy fith she never went to a church service but thy fate he wasn't watching how long a dress house or how short a dress was thy fate she wasn't watching if she wearing earring or Earth thy fi oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises so people in the message with the long dress and the nice hair and the clean face and no fate Jesus C say die fet he go say th long dress th clean face have you just as you are thou changes not and a woman who don't have that clean face a woman who may not have that long dress walk in with faith and snatch it and walk back out friends your tears and human spirit and you struggling God not hearing that the dimension God is in his response is to fate it doesn't matter who have it it's a currency of God God give you a body a spirit and a soul the soul is at the level of the subconscious and it so happen that what you speak could affect your own body he said he will make your body obey your confession when you sin you affect not only your body you affect your spirit you affect your soul you affect your entire being is not it's separated flesh is flesh and spirit is spirit and soul is soul no it's all connected together that way you could speak and the writing begin to evolve off of what you are speaking that woman with the blood that woman with the daughter Vex with the devil that came to Jesus she comes disciples turn her down she harasses his disciples Jesus said it's not fit to take the ch's bread and give it to dog he not even looking at her think about you come for help and in Jesus looking at you and telling listen it's not fix to you hearing him he want you to hear him he privately you know dog there's a dog standing there he he wasn't doing that you know he making sure woman hear him it's not fit to take the chur woman standing right there she she a moov you know share on the Facebook and complain you know no she didn't make a phone call and call God he that preacher say B talking me he calling me a dog he wicked wicked manall Jesus standing so on woman move Hall and she said she said truth truth because anytime the word speak is truth she's at to see like what the dog do see she saw the dog she saw a vision you know when she when she say dog she see the dog eating crumbs she see the dog he hey hey she saw the dog crumb eating she said Jesus even the dogs get the crumbs from off the master's table Jesus said it's over it's over he said your daughter is free Oh Glory to God Jesus said for they saying that woman spoke in this Dimension and she affected the next Dimension she spoke ordinary and what she said influence heaven and that a bum fell on that devil on her daughter and her daughter was delivered that same moment that Jesus is here this morning you can be delivered this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] morning my God how do I do this I had to WRA up here I have 16 pages and now on page seven so I'm not even halfway through but the point about it is this your faith must be anointed to receive your healing your faith must be anointed to receive your breakthrough and deliverance your faith must be anointed Moses he knew by information and intellectual what his mother told him his calling was he knew his calling he knew God calling to deliverer but his fate was not anointed that is why he killed one man and run out when he encountered the pillar of fire his fate was now anointed Ed same man same fate but anointed fate we give the Lord some Praises I'm saying to you today faith is in you the word is in you it's not out of you it's in you but that has to be anointed something have to drop on top of that a fire have to come upon that an anointing have to come upon that then your faith is now anointed to fulfill the promises that God put in your subconscious in your life [Music] so it takes fi to anoint the promised word today for that foot to live do you understand that Hallelujah so how God will test that feet as men as I love I rebuke he will chastise you to see if you want to be a bastard you want to be an ordinary normal church member tradan he hit me he buff me what kind of St talk is that you see buff in the Bible somebody buff you you feel you're in school or something God trying to straighten you as a son you see we spoil our own children God don't he straighten out Noah he's straight out Joshua he straighten out Moses he straight out all his sons every son that come un God get straighten now so what your parents escape with you and don't do to you in discipline God will do oh God help me Romans 1:16 says for another ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God and the Salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first also to the Greek here we go for daring is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as is written to Jos by faith the Amplified says for the gospel a righteousness which God ascribed is revealed from springing from faith and leading to Faith the way of faith that arouses the more faith so this this righteousness of God is from Faith to Faith not from Faith to unbelief and from unbelief and low belief and no belief from Faith to Faith that arouses more faith because Faith also come by experience not just the word David's experience of the bear and the lion in defeating them give him the courage to face golon the in my house Samuel was there building some little all children has come to build little cushion to cave and whatnot so he's doing some kind of I see you'll fail to my shock Samuel tell me no I will not I have the courage to try again you know Grandpa get rebuked grandpa said the wrong thing and Grandpa get rebuked the point about is this Faith stands Faith speaks faith is bold Faith declares itself Hallelujah let me say it again Faith speaks Faith have hair on its chest faith is muscular there is nothing effeminate about faith the J shall live by Fai brother Bram look what Fallen sons of God has did he invented automobiles radio electric lights atomic bombs jet planes turning fast in science but we are trying to linger back on some old church Creed and stand there when God wants us to unfold the word we are living in the last days we are living in a time that God's beautiful Church ought to be standing on his feet but we are back somewhere I long say Presbyterian the Methodist and somebody say well our CH believe it's so how is that so that the word brother Bram what are this Grace we should be unfolding God's spirit pouring out not just one little gusher not one little baptism but baptism after baptism not a revelation justly by faith or sanctification or gifts of the Spirit but revelation after Revelation power after power glory after Glory we ought to be way up the road ready for the translation hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God praise God praise God give the Lord Praises hang in there you have a service this evening you ain't going nowhere hallelujah praise God praise God praise God and be hungry now for this word we almost now we almost true you know we half already all right but Joe had shared this in the believer in chat he said now I believe I say online here when the Holy Spirit begins to move and to give discernment and that is to bring the presence of God Among the people just like singing a hym shouting a message given in unknown tongues or something it brings the spirit of God Among the people let's reverse that now reverse engineer let's reverse engineer so you mean shouting as bring the spirit speaking in Tong that bring the spirit singing a h that bring the spirit that's right discernment is bring the spirit the spirit have to move something have to bring it Oh Glory to God so a church that not shouting what they bringing they bringing themselves amen you heard your pastor preach many times on the word until the spirit got among the people and they just screamed out they couldn't hold their peace any longer what making you stand up what making you scream what making you shout is the spirit without the spirit you sit down there and the devil sit on your top lip and the devil give you handcuffs and hold your hand down and don't talk about your foot your foot in shackles the spirit of God takes the word of God to the congregation and feeds them and they grow spiritually on the word now brother brandham now the Lord bless you each tonight I pray sincerely not only pray but believe that you would receive what you pray for now many times people has thought if I could just had more faith I doubt that now these things are important I don't know how I could get this clear to you he said people think I if I could just more faith I doubt that you got enough Faith you just need a little more knowledge to know what to do with your feet so the first thing you have to know is you have feet that's all you got faith enough you just don't know how to put it to work so there's a way to put Faith to work like we say if you put something in hands of God don't go and take it out you say Lord I give it to you you take it back and you start to M it you can't do it like that you have to release it Hannah was praying for a baby she was Barren she had a terrorist inside the church terrorizing her because she had no baby and so on she pray she CED she beg God and beg God then she change a prayer she said Lord if you give me a son I would honor him by giving him back to you God bless her with Samuel and she released Samuel to God and Samuel became one of God's Great prophets she changed her prayer and God could honor her faith in believing him and take away her baress Oh Glory to God and God could you could God could inspire you to change your prayer and instead of you negative you could pray positive you could pray what God want you to pray and get the answer from God brother Bram I just going to skip quickly tomorrow afternoon I want to put the whole afternoon praying for the people with them prayer cards listen to these words I just feel that the Holy Ghost is here and you have got enough Faith to Move It I Want You P these things if you don't get it now go back and listen to the tape he saying the Holy Ghost is here and I believe you have faith to move it that one time he pray for people they got sick and by even time they got back sick they got healed and by even time he got they got sick again he called them and say repent he said the faith that you believe when you get healed it have that Faith had to keep it say he so God could touch you and you have to believe in faith that that touch will hold and you're going home with faith you're going on believing that this going to happen all right let's go quickly Hebrews 10 says 35 cast not away of confidence which had great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while he that come will come and will not t now the Jos shall live by faith and and If any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in it so God don't want your draw back now let your fet loose go beond you go be on your past go be on your story go be on the history go by what your family used to do you go be on all of that all you want to know is what God want what will you have me to do and you want to follow through with what God want have you to do praise God are you ready now don't die on me now because I will send fire down and get your back up don't die on me now you you you'll get it listen to this here we go Mary could have waited until she had some kind of sign she's going to be mother you could wait after meeting over after the meeting is over until you feel you could move your leg to just get a little better you could hear a little better out of a DEA ear or cancer seems not bothering you so much that is not taking God at his word anytime you're looking for a feeling to feel for heal a feel you don't take God at his word taking God at his word is God said so Mary said be it done unto me be it done unto me according to Thy word Oh Glory to God that is not taking God at his word to take God at his word is to hear his word accept it and start rejoicing in it and some of you your lips still you're taking it in why you're not rejoicing I remind me of the time pepper test eating Pepper and a hot pepper and said the first person say lost and somebody say he want to say he look look he want to say said the first person say lost and that person Tricky Tricky Tricky guy say look he looking like he want to say so what's something here now to take God at his word is to take his word hear it accept it and St re in so when you catch it like that Paul in prison start to Rejoice start to sing and the power came down and he got out of prison when you start to see that you start to sing and praise God before you come out to prison you're not praising God when you are free you know you're Praises God to be free Oh Glory to God give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah brother bham we could see 500 rush to the altar tonight which would be good sign when this revival is about going to break we don't have to have 500 altar we just have to take God at his word and start rejoicing something will happen that brings the word to Life As We water it with praises oh brother over you mean just water it with praises yes that's how you water the word that's how the word get anointed you say hallelujah thank you Jesus praise God thank you for your love thank you for your grace Lord God uh hallelujah praise God thank you for the help that you given me you could have been in the hospital but you're here Halle you could have been dead but you're alive praise God for Life praise God for your feet your hands praise God that you could hear the word of God oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah he says take the word and start rejoicing something will happen because that brings the word to Life As We water with praises what makes a seed grow water what makes the word of God grow is the Praises of God this is it here now what and that's why the devil fight worship fight praise and we fight the devil right back we want a dead Church glory to God stay home with your deadness and they hot or your cold if you're cold you're dead dead on fire for God oh glory to God [Applause] hallelujah Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah give him glory give him glory what makes the word grow the Praises of God so that's is why the devil try to cut off your Praises like in sin and unbelief and what not because you can't give God worship and praise you can't be cussing and getting worshiping God for how that supposed to work now you have two mouths one is the cuss mouth and one the praise mouth only one mouth God give you so you can't let cuss come out of the mouth and then praise come out of the mouth too you have to say cussing you to take aide you know you got to send that demon right out and let Praises come out your mouth so you're living by faith you're walking by faith you're saying the right things isn't that right but Bram when Jesus told them to wait in the upper room on the seat of Jerusalem until they ended point from on high that word fell on their ears they were in the temple continually praising God day and night what was they doing watering that promise that is plain Jan let them ministers fight that let them pastors fight that in the upper room so how man have Revival dead as a DA there no praise inside of there something wrong something cuckoo inside of there Hallelujah Jesus told them go and T until you power and he said they were praising God what were they doing they were watering that promise and all of a sudden all of a sudden they were praising God every day that's how you have to begin to do praise God for your healing praise God for your sealing praise God for the Holy Ghost praise God for Revival praise God for breakthrough praise God for restoring you from a boxing condition praise God for anointing you praise God for inspiring you praise God for the pastor praise praise God for the church praise God for the God's people oh give the Lord a shout praise God for the roof over your head and the bed you sleep on Give the Lord all of a sudden there came a song from Heaven Like A rushan Mighty Wind and in fill all the house where they were sitting the word was being watered and it took to life and start to grow and when it start to go they start to STG like drunk men brother bam said you want a Revival start watering the word he said that makees me feel religious start watering the word oh if you want a Revival you will open your mouth and say thank you Lord praise God hallelujah hallelujah if you want to come out of the wheelchair start watering the word if you want to come out from cancer start watering the word God heals cancer God heal our sicknesses oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah cast up no Hallelujah buckle your seat belts and give God some Praises Hallelujah by watering the word ping the word with a amen that's his watering the word you're saying amen Lord that's truth Lord isn't that right but Bram I remember staying a year and 6 months in the book Book of Revelation I that is teaching I just love teaching it's wonderful it gives the basis and settles the church and in preaching there's some people that are preachers they can pick up the word with inspiration and sway out in places that is watering the seeds that the teacher has taught so we need the teachers and we need the preachers the teachers bring the seed word the preachers bring the anointing the inspiration the water through the word and some people hate preachers they love teachers because the teachers place your position where you are and they nail to the Pew Hallelujah but we need the teaching and we need the preaching but brandham says that is watering the seeds that the teacher has taught you got to put some seed in first then water it and the watering comes from the preaching of the word not the teaching the preaching oh give the Lord I shout so I don't care how much Mighty teachers it have in the message the water when comes from the preaching of the word bring on the preachers oh give the Lord a shout to the host hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah brother Bram there's a vast difference between a teacher and a preacher that is two different gifts of the Spirit Al together two different gifts all right remember Rebecca hardly knowing what she was doing she watered the same animal the camel to go to her husband and the Beast of Burden in the Bible represent a power and this Beast was being watered Rebecca watering the same Beast she wrote on and watch now the same Holy Spirit that's going to lift it up and take it to his new home the church that is praising and blessing and watering with Thanksgiving to the Holy Spirit that's the church that going to get the power to take them home Rebecca water the camel we are watering our camel tonight oh give the Lord I shou in the house glory to God notice notice the very camel she watered took her to meet her unseen bridegroom and that's with the bride also glory to God and the very thing that the church is watering that is the seed the seed of the word is the very word that becomes alive and Carries up to our seen bridegroom oh my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory this is going sweet this eating sweet this eating nice Hallelujah notice God promised that he would send us a true prophet of the true word with a message to return to the original word of God and there I get inspiration from original word and the fate of the fathers to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost amongst the people that the that's a power will raised above these things so this faith of the fathers is that to say we have faith of the fathers it's the faith to bring down to bring down what to bring down a man from America no a man from Canada how about a man from Europe give me one from you Africa no to bring down the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God we see Nations uniting we see the the world uniting watch therefore never since the early church age did they ever see things we are seeing today and this was only made possible when God sent Seven Seals and give us a Sign by it and send seven angels down out of heaven and come and bring back that scattered word and tied back into the word to bring down this holy spirit so all this seven SE Revelation was to tie everything together to bring down the holy ghost in the church I am saying church we are ready for the Holy Ghost itself we are ready for Dynamics and the mechanics we have stood on this word for years I say Let the Fire Fall oh give the Lord I shout in the house the coming of The Headstone the coming of power Hallelujah glory to God let's go so does the word of God you can't you can't take a church and bring it to life on some tradition you might bring members but you will never bring down the power of God until we get back to the original word back to the foundational word back to the blood in the last days I'm almost done I will send down the rain in abundance Oh Glory to God not no light rain not no showers not no light rain rain in abundance both former and latter rain will fall in that day what they had there plus what's called going to do for us right now Hallelujah thaty why I've been so zealous of the kind of seed that I wanted for the body the rain is going to fall pretty soon now I mean the real rain and it's got to have seed to fall on I will restore again in the last days it will be restored God shall send the Holy Ghost not no man Hallelujah God shall send the Holy Ghost in such a way upon planted word that it will restore M come up please the word is a seed that the sore went for to Soul Oh Glory to God hallelujah is this the mystery of the Thunders that will bring back The Headstone well the Myster of the Thunders have to be the faith faith inside the dear is what going to pull down that headstone Oh Glory to God get ready we are closing out right now will this be the mystery that would open up that will bring Christ bring back a power into the church National Force but Israel in a Homeland but the power of God would put the people in The Bride oh you may be seated in a minute praise God we almost there oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah when Moses cried out God said go oh cry unto me speak and move forward Moses said to the people fear not stand still and see the salvation of God what is Moses doing brother George he's prophesying he's speaking positive a ton of Men Behind the ton of I'm in front of the and he's saying stand still don't be worried
