you'd like to read tonight Matthew chapter 5 verse 6. and Revelation chapter 3 we want to read for 7 to 13. Matthew 5 6. uh one verse there blessed are the deepest after righteousness for the shall be filled Revelation chapter 3 I want to read from verse seven unto the angel of the Church of Philadelphia write these things here he that is Holy he that is true he that had the Key of David he had opened it no man shut it shut it no one opened it I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it there was a little strength has kept my word has not deny my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which see their jewels and are not and do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee because star has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the awe of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy crown he not overcome it will I make a pillar in the temple of my God he shall go out no out no more out I will write upon him the name of my God the name of the city of my God which is the New Jerusalem which coming out from heaven from my God I'll write upon him my new name he had an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches you may be seated oh praise the Lord so good to be here tonight see all of you all tonight my God it looks like you come out for a Revival tonight that is so good I feel the excitement I feel the expectation that is wonderful and he passed out Minister gonna be excited about this oh priest God Amen let's go hallelujah praise God Amen Let's Get Down the business that's we're here tonight amen to get down to business praise God brother Branham my friends that the entire Church of the Living God is built solemnly upon spiritual revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ no matter how educated you are how smart you are how well you may be think you know the Bible Satan knows it a lot better than you do but only through revelation God to the Holy Spirit your tutor revealed to you that he saved you by his grace amen so that's why he told Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gizabel cannot Prevail against it so the church is built upon Revelation not knowledge that intellect Revelation that's my God could bypass the intellect and the human mind and drop it straight into the heart isn't that right praise God you're also saying that the gifts of Hell will come against it but can't reveal so when you get them backward that's normal when they get in fight that's normal the devil's supposed to be upset because he could never get his name up there he could never take your place he can't take your inheritance he could never be your son he cannot be adopted he cannot eat no he cannot go there or give the Lord of praise God hallelujah so right now tonight devil is jealous praise God he's jealous of you he's jealous of your inheritance he's jealous of your calling he's jealousy of anointing that God put upon your life and what God put the devil can't take off we'll give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah glory to God so tonight our title I have set before thee an Open Door praise God that's not but always speaking as God speaking praise God I've set before the unopened door he set back in Philadelphia age but it meant to go right through oh praise God an open door that no man could shut money open it manka close it when God opened that door for you God opened that door for you behold I set before thee tonight Hallelujah the open door and that open door is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that Open Door had no man messenger inside of it that opened all the Holy Ghost how glory to God Give the Lord some Praises before loud is here right upon the wealthian age just after sanctification god Set an open door that no man got shot no man could shut that door nobody could stop you from getting the holy ghost at night what can the Lord and shouting the house no false anointed no message Man praise God no Pastor man Bishop man no kind of man because God opened that door or give the Lord some Praises hallelujah praise God my God may be seated and I'll be jumping here jumping there but in the same scripture we read he said behold I will make them that of the synagogue of Satan with savior Jews and the tale of that is they say they have the Holy Ghost but they do not he said I will make them they lie and behold I will make them come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee oh give the Lord some Praises this holy ghost thing is a real thing you know it's a holy ghost punch promised in the last days you know to connect to the headstone you know we there's no church positional this is not woman no church pensional this is you kept coming alive by Revelation you praising God by Revelation all glory Lord God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God glory to God hallelujah when the anointing begin to strike he said he won't have to ask the people to worship you would never ask them to praise God you wouldn't have to ask them to sing they can't wait for the doors to open they can't wait to color atmosphere they can't wait to hear the word go forward power my God Hallelujah Glory the court my God you may be seated with a Clarence but a client send me this one and I think this is goal Jesus being revealed to disciples the gardener Eden watches when Cain brought an offering In Worship the same as Abel did he worshiped he pays to the church he sacrificed he done every religious deed brighter better more fitted than later he had a better altar he made it prettier than water worship you see the strains still walk among the sons of Adam watch this there's a way that seemed right unto a man but what he did he worshiped true knowledge he worshiped not by revelation so you can worship and then he said this and it is possible he said get it now listen you can worship true knowledge you can go to church by knowledge which you should do it but going to church though that way is worshiping in vain you go to church because you don't want people thinking about science because you missed two Services he had to make up they had to come because your army if I say two three services they might take a bad side you have no revelation you are back sitting already because you can come here every service and bust it in your heart mission service doesn't mean I want to think about that now you have to be right in your heart [Music] so worshiping by knowledge is worshipers and vain that's why Jesus told a woman of the woman we know what we worship I know what you're about but I will know what we worship because salvation is of the Jews but then he went deeper and said woman the woman our common knowledge when neither Jerusalem not on this mountain We're Gonna Worship We're Gonna Worship the father in spirit and in truth thank you so what he did there he canceled every Jewish exclusive exclusion exclusivity he cancel all that so there's another Jewish thing we're talking about sister that there's a spirit and and one thing we're talking about so you cancel all that this is the mountain and Jerusalem and be elect people he cancel all of that and said y'all are common always and that was prophecy for us now we're getting to worshipers glory to God because we have the word and we have the spirit truth amen all right so let's go quickly now let's get it again you can worship through knowledge you can go to church by knowledge and you and you should do it but by going to church that way is worshiping in vain but when there is something happens done in your heart [Applause] [Music] when something happens down in your heart that makes you love God in such a way you can't steer from church that is the revelation that is God revealing because something striking tongue in your heart we are coming to church to see somebody here commentary because somebody coming to they're coming because they love God they love his people they love the atmosphere you love the word you love the cause all right visited how can you make a pig alarm Yuri speaks and Lamb's boat the pig get around eat all kind of stuff you get out and manual pieces are belly full you don't feel bad about that you think that's a pig he's a good pig you don't see a llama wrong there he could invite him over for dinner he wouldn't come because he's a pig you go tell him he's wrong he said bless God I'm a pig you on your own ground you go down there in the whole world if they want to there you are watch not because I quit eating money or make me different from a pig no isn't that it's when my nature is changed so you could they could dress up the pig put bow tie on the pig put pink bunnies and a pig put glasses on a pig game of suit is still a pig you can keep any hosting you know make him an executive house big but once he gets out oh my God modern manual because of his nature so the prophet said you put a fence around it back off you say watch he said it's not until it's changed but if you take the spirit out of that of a lamb and put it into a pig the pig will do the same thing the lamb Spirit of him will do so you don't have a problem it's a night you know all you need is I need your change [Music] this gospel solve your problem you know you're miserable God could change that nature yeah nature get an answer back on your root God could change your nature your wicked God could change your nature your backs haven't got to change your nature too you're hateful God could change that you're envious God to change that you're narcissistic you're selfish but to change that too you don't have no sins and and cans of people got to change that too God could change you I will give you a new spirit I will give you and I'll put my spirit in your spirit so we're on a great expectation this night all right let's go I've been predestinated us to the Praises of his glory of his grace where any meters accepting the Beloved who did it because I quit drinking because I quit smoking no he did it he made me before the function of the world acceptable in the presence of his grace nothing I ever done didn't have one thing to do with it I was a pig to begin with I was a sinner born in a family of drunkards raising moonshine still settle in the whiskey barrel disgraceful a Kentucky Moonshiner never wore a pair of shoes till I was a big boy here hanging on my neck sitting in a moonshine cake making moonshine and yet the Holy Ghost come on me at seven years old and said don't drop it don't touch a drop of it don't fool with them all girls out there don't smoke cigarette or to Tobacco praise God it was the father's good will before the foundation of the world that he would send me to preach the gospel and to leadership he was seven years old praise God that is one more year than my grandson Samuel praise God he was seven years old when God tell him no smoke Don't drink don't fall out woman other work for you to do and I'm telling you where right where you are right now whatever works for you to do the devil's a liar oh praise God God and finish with you yet Give the Lord a shout God has finished with you yet he want to empower you he wants to anoint you he wants a direct and guide you Holy Ghost on Fire Holy Ghost on Fire let's go we don't believe that speaking with tongues makes you filled with the Holy Ghost no the morning we believe a ban living in a man will make you a pig servant hear what we believe now are you ready We Believe that you receive the Holy Ghost by an experience but I have shout this is not the bride that Jesus Christ around the world [Applause] this is for the Bride of Jesus Christ around the world not sitting on your bent and you're not Christian fire after State you something has to happen inside your heart inside your soul or give the Lord some Praises tonight glory to God glory to God hallelujah God Trinidadian God called it be a Christian and a Christian is Christ in you the hope of glory Give the Lord some praises [Applause] but nobody said this is the word of God behold I send you Elijah Elijah said that God said that oh give the Lord some Praises as many hath received him to them give him power to become the sons of God you don't have power power belongs to God and when God sends power God sends power foreign [Music] we believe that you receive the Holy Ghost by an experience not by mythical intellectual conception of the scriptures but by an experience that you alone know and if you want to know whether it was the Holy Ghost watch how your life patterns after that it will tell the kind of spirit coming to you so the baptism of the Holy Ghost in this message is a personal experience after you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe this message you have to get a personal experience and when they get that person experience no devil no demon no child no testing no tribulation nothing present nothing to come could stop you from being focused on this absolute does here the Lord glory to God hallelujah you may be season oh my God Hallelujah Prophet speaks he said I want you to come and listen a while because you want to take our time and lay the world so close that the devil won't even have one little speck of room to move hear these words now when you let your feet your feet runs out to his end till you begin to believe then let your subconscious go to acting then the faith of God will back it up because your faith won't do too much your subconscious has to move in the direction your faith is moving and then God said Moves In and confirms it all [Applause] no you are 13 or whenever you go to work you're going to try to get taxi that's all I just facing on you live outside by your faith that inside your heart you know when you take up a taxi or you take up a car to go to work you expect the reach to work you'll expect to crash you're expected not to make it you're nice to it Runs Out and your subconscious they need to line up without faith then God faith dropped behind that then they get the confirmation of indication because your faith Runs Out you believe in God the believing God for your children you believe in God for the Holy Ghost you believe in God for your family you believe in God your faith your trust and your believing they're going this way they're going that way but you believe in it upsets you it troubles you but to believe in you're holding on that's your faith you're holding on God you said so Hallelujah I'm gonna be healed I'm gonna that's your fate but if you want your subconscious to move [Applause] the subconscious is the real you say I got it right now and your subconscious rolling back I wonder if it'll work on me they know it's right but I sure it's the 90s in my channel subconscious pulling back something holding you back you want to be liberated you want to be free you know you can be you know you should be you can be and you should be I'll show you why God take us as wretched Sinners and save us we supposed to be the happiest people in the world and he has a lot of Christians that happy they're under heavy frustration and heavy issues why because self is in the way some of them untangle and ungrateful they don't know they say thank you Lord I'm so happy I'm thanking what you have the greedy said they want more they I long call that long eye so what they have is never enough so they are unsatisfied they're watching this person and find they have that they want that too the I see that they want that too the I see that they want that to they're not satisfied and they come to church unsatisfied that's not how God wants you to be God wants you satisfied if you're freightful fretful fretful nurse at the breast of The Shadow such a nurse on that dress until I am satisfied you know if I dead in the morning I'm good you know glory to God hallelujah you have to prove nothing to anybody you know God bless me and help me and save me and deliver me I pick up a wife I pick up three sons I pick up some thought and laws and pick up some grandchildren I'm on my way to Glory we'll give the Lord some Praises I'm excited about the future I'm excited about what God have in store I'm excited about the Next Generation Oh Glory to did the devil run for his money I'm excited about the Sea of the righteous of the seated serpent seed and the devil people Conquering the world but God said the people that know their God shall be strong they're gonna be one more ride there will be one more witness of this super church superbride we'll give the Lord some praises Hallelujah praise God praise God somebody sleep but we just are not all sleep maybe seated praise God all right let's go God deals with individuals not with denomination God in no age ever dealt with domination he always dealt with individuals that's that's a tremendous thing and if you catch that by Revelation you'll be excited you know one time I was reading and the prophet said you one is the majority in God and I dropped under my teeth my knees I said God I'm a majority oh give the Lord I praise offering Oh Glory to God I felt so good doing that he said one is a majority in God and I say God I'm a majority when you understand by Revelation that God deals with individuals that means no man could stop God from dealing with you you are individual you not talking about the group and the church and the people that I'm Gonna Do With It Give the Lord some Praises God they call your family God call you oh give the Lord I shall God have to call each individual in your family or give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah praise God my god let's continue now you cannot make a holy church there is no such a thing as a holy church or a holy organization so when you see Pastor man or Bishop man or who they think they are say that you have to come here to be the Rapture you know they are liars you have to be in Christ to go in the Rapture you have to be magnetized instead of The Headstone to go on the Rapture Glory the God man saying are they be connected to us yet implemented this one connected to that one that's a liar that's a false anointed ones that's the false prophet a false teacher get out from there run for your life or no man could put you in and no man can put you out the kingdom of God is preached and every man every man every man passed away into it give the Lord some Praises nobody has come to shake your hand into it come on now you press away that's what you're here to do tonight the pressure way I come for the Holy Ghost I come for Revival I come for the quick and power Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] let's go you cannot make a holy church there's no such thing as a holy church a holy realization the Holy Spirit can be preached in it but in dear in the church you find God and we have that too bad we have that here Renegades we have that here indifferent and everything else so always here we have that desire here regards are saying this and saying that and brothers and brothers and sisters amen is the pastor speaking here right now you know I know what I have yeah I preaching this a long time enough I supposed to know what I have here you know God bull whatever it is I suppose oh Gloria God small horn Big Horn bullhorn I suppose to know her sheep oh give the Lord a shout there's a bite for Jesus Christ hey all right the Holy Spirit can be preaching it but in there you find good bad Renegades and different and everything else so an organization can hold it we we can't you can't say we got it none of the rest of them has it people doing that foolishness by the judge we have this and nobody's have that and you know you know you don't have like us you know no they will say so directly they said exactly but at the end of the day people say are we different you can't say we we got it none of the rest of them has it no sir the Holy Spirit here we go it's poured out on individuals for that alone we can go home after this evening [Applause] upon me upon you tonight the Holy Ghost is part of an individuals and you are individual and God has deal with individuals that means God could port on you tonight and the person in front of you are deciding you behind you can't stop that or give the Lord some praises Hallelujah glory to God glory to God hallelujah I hope this anoint your faith to reach up and pull on your anointing and pull down your healing and pull down your ceiling and pull down your deliverance praise God you may be seated praise God sometimes on the platform there and his patience and the people come to be prayed for all of a sudden he did like this he said the pillow move across there he said sir God just receive your healing and they come back this way sir you just received praise God God just deliver you from death on that that person pulling the pillar fire off the platform and pull it right for them praise God they interrupting the prophet or give the Lord a shout you could stay there and interrupt God tonight hey praise God come on get the Lord and Shout in the house Oh Glory to God right in your seat you could get God to come to you give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah All Through the Ages they receive the Holy Spirit but not in the measure that they have it now because it's a restoration of the face now lots of time many of us Pentecostals made a mistake and think well the Holy Ghost poured on me glory to God that's all I've got to have no sir you're just getting started because holding a sport upon Faith where is that that's about you that's power that you can add the rest getting started he said now watch then it's your test and your trial so when you get the Holy Ghost you know get an opportunity to go into your place of trying we find out the Old Testament testing trying then placing a sun adoption place in the sun he was already a son he was born into the family but he would be tested and tried raised by tutors to see how he comes out Oh Glory to God I'm not praise God hallelujah I am not the tester so her again fight with me wrong battle praise God so this is the prophet now we have we had about 40 Years of testing of Pentecostals see testing Church seeing whether they're going to stand or not when your family come wrong and your loved ones come down to see if it was a Christian your cousin so it could cost like them smoke like them drink like them clean glass with them because hey family you know family no family you have a Christian you have a stand watch testing the church scene where they're going to stand or not seeing that you see there is way I get it again instead of holding on to the Cross onto the wood and moving on becoming become fashion after the world all right so let's go going good did you notice Rebecca when ili is a Founder it was an evening time she watered the camel called Elizabeth said all right wow Elizabeth said if the dancer that comes to what is the camel give me drink and will be one that you have chosen Lord to be the Bride of your silver Isaac and while he was yet in prayer Rebecca come draw water and give him drink water they come here notice the camera was a beast and that Beast that she was watering was the one who packed to her bride Isaac and today the power of the Holy Ghost that the church is watering and worshiping is the thing that will pack it from the Earth to meet the bridegroom [Applause] Isaac come out to his father's house was out in the field when he saw Rebecca coming on the camel she loved him at First Sight jump off the camera around to meet him and so forth that's where we meet the Lord and the Very comment that she watered packed her to her husband very power that the church is worshiping you heard the message Sunday right the very power that the church is worshiping that the world called fanaticism that the church is worshiping will be the same power that will take the church up in the air to meet the Lord in the air the Holy Spirit so you can understand Claire you know suddenly message worships come precedes the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you yourself have to get a revelation to worship [Applause] because that's not normal people not thought that before they sit down here and listen but they don't know

it is that drinking and when it drinks its allotted portion he's got to drink more than that it has to drink so much until it starts pushing out limbs say they come barely tasting they had to drink this thing up whole you had to drink more than you need to push away come the series to drink to drink this wooden then it keeps drinking until they pushes out the leaves it keeps drinking they push it out blossoms they keep drinking until it pushes out oranges all the time it is drinking drinking drinking when you put out orange trees looking like a babies little leaves if it's too soft wound us come and bite it you gotta have it away from the worms and so like that but after it gets strong and the way you get tough it's starting to spread now getting more mature then I get a flower a drinking I said drinking and pushing out flowers pushing out branches and so forth then you see your orange come there so they get bigger and bigger and more mature then you reap from your orange tree oh God there's the same Christian principle Oh Glory and God put you down and you start a drink and pull up isn't right he said when we become Born Again Servants of God the seed of God planted in our heart we just keep drinking drinking and pushing out and everything that you have need of in this earth journey is in you when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's in that word reading again everything that you have need of in this Earth's Journey is in you when you receive the Batman Legos all the healing you ever need all the rejoicing you ever need all the power you ever need everything you need is in you when you got Christ in you but the only thing you have to do is to keep drinking drinking drinking or glory to God hallelujah praise God you know what the prophet said the people don't get thirsty enough the Bible said blessed are you when you are Hunger unto us under righteousness when you are till so you can drink the more you drink the more you can spread out the more grace you get the more power you have the more faith you have you keep drinking from Christ who is the inexhaustible function of life drinking or give the Lord some praises God word is a seed watch God is in his word look at him when he mixes with manifest he promised of what he would do look at 120 people God take in God's word went up to Pentecost waited until the commission Tower in the city of Jerusalem until you do perform High watch this now listen to this approach that he brought it God's word sunk into the hearts and they waited there what was they doing just sitting around saying well I will see what will happen you can't water it that way oh we're going down deep as a night he said well you say but yes I believe in Divine Healing but sure it's in the Bible but that's not the way to get healed you might have the seed but you've got to water it you've got to what you got the what you got to what you got to water it if you've never heard that before you're here tonight you have the seed but you have to water it can't be boasting about how this I can't see you know yeah Original season ings you're only showing it you put a plastic over it oh my you're playing when your neighbor coming straight even and it's not hybrid you know you said Original Seed is what I believe but we only go past that tonight okay what you got to do you might have the seed but you got to water it the Bible says this is now the Bible said when they win the upper room they were blessing and thanking and praising God why he's asking a question why praising him because they knew it was coming for they had the seed in the heart God's promise I can give you another scripture Abraham started not of the promise of God true unbelief but was strong in faith given what praises to God for he was fully persuaded that God was able to perform what he promised that's all we're trying to get you to do to be fully persuaded so much that you will praise God before you get the Holy Ghost praise God before you get your healing praise God know him it's on its way get the Lord some Praises tonight Glory glory to God relax tomorrow is a holiday not only keep it too long but just bear with me write at me glory to God listen yourself right if it can ever settle in your heart you out here with heart trouble cancer you in radio land and we say those who connected to us life you want online or who would hear the tape watch something now you in the hospital wherever you may [Music] 's word in your heart and water it with praises and thanks to God for giving it to you it will grow into a tree of whatever the seed represents whatever your need is whether it's her family whether they say loved ones you thank God in advance because you receive the word seed and you are praising God before it even happened oh give the Lord our Shout glory to God hallelujah let's go down deeper healing salvation whatever it is for that tree will blossom but you got a drink you got to what it you got to feed it you got to let it grow and the more you trust in God if you're in a wheelchair and in the hospital you are so paralyzed you can't even move one finger but just keep moving that one finger to the glory of God the more you'll move your hand there's a paradise only one finger moving your Hallelujah has a finger movie Hallelujah going thank you Jesus and after one you may get two Hallelujah pray until the whole hands are the move [Applause] next they move your arm if you keep watering it pushing out growing getting bigger and bigger take God's word is a seed God Abraham a promise that we've been studying and Abraham let that seed get into his heart that is where I get into people is in people's head it has to get in your heart and when I get to the heart you start to love God's people you love the word you love the cause you love what Christians love and the words had to break off for you all all these are the fall off and they get new leaves that'll break inside of you see watch and Abraham let that see gets into his heart the promise and he kept watering it with praises and Thanksgiving to God for the child and waited 25 years but the three feet cup with three Kim for just the same because he watered it with fate oh praise God okay so we're gonna wrap up Revelation 3 17. unto the angel of Church of Philadelphia write these things said he that is Holy either is true he has the Key of David he opened it to no man shut it shut it no man open it I know that works behold I've set before thee and open door and no man can shut it for that was a little strength kept my word has not denied my name little strength kept my word not deny my name little strength kept my word look at the name the prophet said between the Western age and now recent age Wesley which is Philadelphia Elijah he opened the door that no man can shut adore so after some vacation he put a door there and afterwards what the kidney nominated isn't that right after Luther died the nomination what not he put an open door and that open door he identify as the Holy Spirit 1906 I believe the 1909 they had the great Revival on Azusa Street the open door was dear and the baptism of the Holy Ghost was given out dear isn't that right and of course he never could do nothing about it and when people started to speak in tongues and carry on the people who run them and as they run them everywhere they run them the fire break out God was using the devil to run them to spread it and the more they run them and run them out and they hate them is they modify your spread and that's how God started this Holy Ghost Revival under the Pentecostals by the devil getting so mad at this fire he was just like blowing the fire and making the fire get bigger isn't that right and then God brought the prophet up born to 1909 praise God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord all that under the open door is where God put the new name is where adoption where them Thunders manifesting a new name to speak the word in this open door this Open Door closing you know not yet praise God God set it I sat before an Open Door isn't that right hallelujah praise God under that open no anointing he spoke squirrels glory to God he spoke this he spoke that he spoke that because the door is open to the spirit that no man can touch it no man can hurt the oil and the wine God set her open door and I want to tell this message well that door is still open oh give the Lord a praise Hallelujah the Holy Ghost door is still open no man could shut it when God opened it okay the Lord as praise hallelujah praise God hallelujah the prophet and what is the Holy Ghost he said no watch not by one handshake but by one Spirit Holy Spirit we are baptized into one body whether Jews or Gentiles where are we born or free We Are All Made to drink of one Spirit the body of Christ is one Spirit where every member from Pentecost to this time drink of the new wine the same Holy Ghost bringing forth the same results how do we get it by one spirit it's God's Open Door the Holy Spirit what is it it is God's open door it's a sign it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's an assurance it's a rest it's a peace it's goodness it's healing it's life it's God's Open Door to all these things be all I set before thee an Open Door his cause open door to Christ God proved that he raised Jesus from the dead and those that are dead in Christ will God bring with him at the resurrection grieve not the Holy Spirit wherever you are sealed until the day of your Redemption oh praise the name of the Lord glory to God so this open door that started in Philadelphia is like a blood called you know the spirit follow the blood all the way from the book of redemption that Spirit Come True like a black cord isn't that right to Philadelphia too loud yes sir isn't that into the prophet and the prophet brought the fullness of it and that that man right on top the brotherly kindness is is the holy spirit it's the open door to the Rapture Oh Glory to God's seven Living Voices do you see it there now praise God on top that brotherly kindness dear praise God is that that rainbow holy who slapped that called Holy Spirit praise God as he opened over us the Escape praise God you are going to be the Escape one you escape loudish here yes escape the hope you escape the false anointed that Open Door go right up to the Holy Spirit oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah because that Open Door introduce the birth but William Branham introduced the person of Christ oh give the Lord some Praises Lord God is one line Oh Glory to God give the Lord some praises Hallelujah let's continue you know all right swimming Pages here foreign by faith Sanctified Justified to Luther's message sanctify true there but miss the open door justified by Future Luther by Wesley what don't you remember the sleeping virgin when she reads up you remember what was she called Ten went to meet the bridegroom is that right five was wise had oil how many knows that all signify Spirit but you are Sanctified they were all Sanctified every one of them Sanctified but five was wise enough to have the wisdom of Revelation to catch that door and be filled with the spirit wisdom of Revelation to cut the cat what the door doctor refill with the spirit and that's the key right there to the message to be filled with the spirit Oh Glory to God when the Holy Ghost fell in Russia and the Holy Ghost fell of all the other places there was no Doctrine to it there was no teaching to it the spirit was falling the spirit was moving there was no word under it it was the open door Spirit moving freely in Wales Russia Armenia all over the world the spirit of God was moving because God bringing an atmosphere because he know the prophet must come with the seed and it have to have the atmosphere so he released the open door to bring the spirit atmosphere that the settlement could come the sore of the good seed or give the Lord a shout but the Pentecostal turned it on and it crashed them into laodicea and God blessed my bright age to call you or can the Lord I shout because the Pentecostal was the shock but you are the seed Rory look good Hallelujah glory to God so after the open door Pentecostal God put the open door writing Tabernacle there praise God a prophet belching out the word of God word after word after word and that is why we are live tonight because of that open door that God put there in Jacksonville with a 20th century Prophet preached until 1965 and looked at us today 2023 and we still alive because of that open door oh can the Lord I shouting the house be still alive Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God Gloria God hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God worry the god I'm almost finished let me see it now watch in this scripture he's revealing part of it here he said that um what he said the church is going to come and you have to get in the organization because those keep the word of my patience I will keep you from the hour of Temptation and is identifying the all of temptation as the tribulation and that tribulation was not in that age so all that was prophetic so he experienced here now this great temptation of or the hour of Temptation that shall try the whole world goes into the tribulation just in a few minutes we will see it it goes on into the tribulation and the tribulation did not come in the days of Wesley so what age are we in what is this door set before us oh praise the name of the Lord It's been Wesley where the church is heading right now and laodicea oh praise God isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah watch setting right before the people to come in and God will take the remnant and seal it off and they will go on into lukewarm and be split out of his mouth now here there's a pairing the sleeping Vision also proves that this last Church age moves on to the first part of Pentecost and then they go into the Great Tribulation oh praise God and there's only one way to go into the body of Christ there's only one daughter the Church of the Living God and Jesus is that door isn't that right he said I've set before the unopened door he said that to the Methodist Church age they turn away from it it went through an organization but I've set before an open door now after they receive sanctification he said I will put the open door which is the Holy Spirit and by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body which is Christ so he set that message before the Methodist Church the students aside they come this on vacation but refuse the Holy Ghost remember that is the open door how do you get into Christ by one Spirit not by sprinkling not by handshake but by one Holy Ghost baptism we are all baptized into one body and make practices of that body one Holy Ghost baptism into that door it is one Holy Ghost baptism into that door oh God that door is set before you tonight oh glory to God wherever this message is preached wherever it is William random messages they have an open door an opportunity for the people to receive Christ the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus Oh Glory almost done let's go how do we get into Christ by one Holy Spirit he had a question all right he's talking about uh the wedding the Parable with the man who came in with all the government listen the bridegroom stands at the door or comes up with an invitation right and the old time Holy Ghost religion makes all look alike whether the rich or poor Bond of free black white male female one in Christ Jesus the bridegroom stood at the door received the invitation now what do you think when the bridegroom come back from The Man Without The Wedding garment said friend how do you get in here he's so speechless he showed he come in some other way besides the door he come in a window he come in the back door he come he call a friend with a church member friend how did you come in here without the Garment now Jesus himself called the portal and said casting out of Darkness where there'll be weeping with the national teeth that's Christ's one word because it proved without the wedding garment he coming some other way besides the door it's not right because if you come to the door he would have received the wedding garment listen to this then if the wedding garment is the baptism of the Holy Spirit how are we going to be represented any other way if the first church age had to come by the door Christ Jesus be baptized into the name of Jesus Christ receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost to put on the wedding garment how are we coming any other way if you come by Methodist by Baptist by Pentecostal by other denomination you will be born and cast in the of the darkness you've got to come by Christ's way Hallelujah just as sure as God kept his word to Peter James and John just assure he kept it to John the Beloved the Revelator just assure he kept the promises through the judges just as sure he promised in this last days he would send them the latter rain and would bring back the same spirit that was upon the Earth in him or give the Lord a shout to just assure Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God music please Hallelujah glory to God Amen question but the Branham greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus please explain who is the man in Matthew 22 11 the man that didn't have on the wedding garment I know he couldn't get into heaven without the wedding garment on this was a guest I know not the bride yes that's right he would be a guest he just slipped him it just took a whole semen on that he said here's what happened in the oil comes custom they put it at the door you put a robe on him he was poor he was rich whatever it is he had to wear this wedding garment and when they stood at the door they put this on him it covered him up on the outside of what he has been whether he's a millionaire a pauper a farmer a dish Digger it doesn't matter no he said Saint John 10 I am the door now this man had come by organization back at the window over there sipping a hole and they had all them things there well they come somewhere else besides the door he come with all the proper invitation he would he comes from educational system something like that he got in and then he said to them buying him hand on foot and cast himself out of Darkness where they'll be weeping and build a national teach he went into tribulation period it did not come by the door oh praise God hallelujah it is clean it is clear the Holy Ghost is the door the open door to get the Holy Ghost
