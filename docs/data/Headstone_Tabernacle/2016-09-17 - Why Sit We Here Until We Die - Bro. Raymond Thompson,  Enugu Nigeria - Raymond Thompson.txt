going to be too late you got to be identified now identify yourself now with the word and brother sister you can't wait for the rain by the time the Dynamics comes the door hallelujah amen amen that's why I'm not ashamed of the s from the gospel Prophet preaching with no revelation God spok it through his prophet my so you see they couldn't what happened they were too late then then one morning all

seven Thunder Revival the same baptism of the Holy Ghost the same power of God that they are making fun of is going to Rapture us it will condemn the critics the same third pool there they make fun of will be the pr protection Hallelujah we get to numbers 13 and and Moses sent over the spies to go and spy out the land and and they came back now remember they were 12 but 10 of them came back negative with a negative so it's so important what your report is as a minister as a CHR as a Believer what you say that your report Hallelujah your Revelation your and what happened they came back and they told the people make it those people are giants and we are grasshoppers the walls are so big and there's no way we can make it but says and Caleb stole the people before Moses and said hey shut up let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the man that went up with him said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought us up an evil report of the land which they have searched unto the children of Israel saying the land which has which had gone to search is the land that inhabit and all the people that we saw there St oh I want to tell you man before I go further I don't care how big they are I don't care how big their churches are I don't care if they worldwide connected I don't care about brother I don't see the you know what I'm looking at I'm looking at the promise of God I'm looking that there's a Rapture Lan for the pride I'm looking at the promise of God I'm not interested how big they are but brother my God Is Bigger Than them bigger than the walls bigger than the report bigger than the Revelation my God Is Bigger man amen amen woo Hallelujah Hallelujah now listen closely and when the word test came and when they went over and seen the opposition so great the greatest opposition they ever seen the malachit was 10 times their size they said we look like grasshoppers their fences their cities are so w till they can run a chariot race around it two chariots as hard as they could go around the wall SE of their cities why their Spears are way out there long and they are giants why we look like we can't do it watch the negative report yet Joshua and Caleb came back with the evidence Hallelujah I don't know who was in front and who was back but maybe Joshua was in front and K the back and they came with the evidence one bunch of great two men to carry brother Hallelujah you know what the B says as long as it was in the land it was evidence but when they brought it back Hallelujah and the people that was manifested evidence I yet to tell you brother brother Bren went the cross he came back with the evidence of the new land and he said I seen you there and I seen you and I seen you and I seen you he was there he came back with the evidence Hallelujah and the two men that and the two men stood on that word Cale and josua said wait a minute wait a minute you two says yeah two million people shut up just minut we are more than able to do it we are more than a mat for them we can take it we can do it shut up two million people against you he say shut up we can do it we more than and only Joshua and Caleb believe the report Hallelujah and the Bible says numbers 14 bring so you see when you come with the ne God cut you off man God don't need you you need God you need to believe this message hallelujah hallelujah the Bible says they were cut off messenger he says you are a messenger and he says they were cut off before the Lord but Joshua the son of and C the son of japa which were of the men that went to search the land they Liv Hallelujah you hear that they still lived for the ones with a negative report they were cut off don't you worry brother it's not our it's not our duty to do anything God will take care of them brother whatever negative report they have and whatever down they speaking on this Bri God is going to deal with them brother they have God on their hands hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he says this morning you're a messenger you're a messenger of good news or a messenger of bad news oh isn't that beautiful to know that we are embassadors that we are angels The Messengers of the resurrection and we are God's Messengers to this sinful world that Christ lives in our hearts he lives and in our Spirits he lives he brings us from a low deatched life of sin and exalts us and gives us hallelujah hallelujah he gives us what a hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he gives us a Hallelujah in our soul and makes us new creatures so we are messengers angels of the Covenant he says how wonderful so we come back to this I want to go quickly to Second Kings the Bible says there's a massive famine Syria had surrounded Samaria and they were starving them to death so much so until they were eating the backk of the tree they were eating the grass on the ground they were eating one another's children because of the famine and the King joram was the king of Samaria and he was the son of the king of and Jezebel and there were seven years of famine in the land and K king banadad of Syria had surrounded samar's Army and starved them to death this famine was so bad until they were eating donkey's head and sold four square pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cab of doves D for five pieces of silver so he said so the fine was so bad until one day the King was walking on the wall and one woman screamed to the king he says oh King what shall I do he says me and my neighbor came to an agreement that today we boil my son and we eat and today it's her turn and now she you see what happens brother is got out of the will of God and when you get out of the will of God there comes a famine a Salvation and and I feel brother that we are not immune from it and you find people in the message dying people in the PS are dying I'm going to read the quote people in the church are dying why the prophet says here and when the king he rent his clo and the King sent this is Elijah and we must cut off his head and then he sent a messenger hallelujah hallelujah but what happened before the messenger came Elijah already knew and Elijah said yeah he the word of the Lord before he could come with this message he has Elijah with this prophetic message the Lord Brother we lay our lives on this man and elishah said behold Hallelujah thus say the Lord tomorrow about this time shall be a measure of for a sh and me of for a in theate of Samaria if this man didn't believe the report he said how can it be when you look at the condition how can God even if he opens the windows of Heaven how can this be and elishah looks at him he says man you will see with your eyes but you will not eat thereof hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah father let me tell you there's many that seen it with their eyes but they can't eat their off okay so he prophesied before he could even give his message and he said even Winds of Heaven it will never happen said you'll see with the eyes but you won't come the Bible says but there was four lepers on the outside they couldn't be in the city they had leprosy and they had to be outside the city so if they said one to another why sit we here until we die oh I'm here to tell you man why are you in the message but you are dying why sit you here weak in and weak out convention brother said last night man you might hide behind the people you might hide but God knows exactly who you are God knows you dying you know you dying you know that you are spiritually dead and the minister come week after week trying to revive you but brother let me tell you there's coming a deliverence there's a people that believe a message I don't care if you don't want it I don't care who don't want it but there is somebody that wants a message they begin to say one to another and I think that's what we doing in this convention we encouraging one another come on we can make it don't be downhearted you might have come here you ready to give up you might be here I don't know how you feel you may feel contented because something went wrong you might feel like like like you NE can never come back brother said one man wrote to him he said brother Bram I committed the most evil sinner he there's no Grace for me he say my brother just the fact that you feel that way shows there is Grace for you here to tell you looking at your condition I'm not looking how bad you are I don't care what the devil has done but I believe there's a promise saying over you right now brother that the devil cannot take away we didn't gather under a group we didn't gather under a church we are GED under the banner of Jesus Christ there no bishop and our Bishop he is the bishop of our souls he's The Shepherd of our souls the sheer of your soul Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah praise praise God now watch my God the prophecy already went out right Elijah already said Lord tomorrow by this time but you see God is Sovereign I can't tell him or we can't tell him you can't save you he can't save you and he can't save you because you no he's Sovereign he saves who he wants to he saves the viest he saves the poorest he saves the richest there's no there's no limitations with God he's sere oh I hope you call that man he Sovereign don't let anybody tell you you can't be saved you can't be changed you can't come to CH hey this is a promise of God he's the Sovereign one man he's the one that saved you he's the one that died for you he's the one that gave his life for you H hallu hallelujah hallelujah Man I Feel the Fire of God is here I feel the power of God is here God and the Word was hanging in the air thus say the Lord by tomorrow this time there will be flowers Hallelujah and you will think Elijah will go there and stand and bring it to pass no you know what happen God let these two these four men say listen we dying they ding in the city we ding here let's go to the syrians maybe they kill us we die but they might just Spar us hallelujah oh my goodness the secret of this year what I'm saying is you got to do something about your state don't sit there

the Lord made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of Chariots a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another hey the king of Israel hired a against us the kings of the heit and the kings of the Egyptians to come upon us where they Rose and fled in the Twilight the same time they rose up the Bible says they rose up in Twilight and the Bible says here that the
