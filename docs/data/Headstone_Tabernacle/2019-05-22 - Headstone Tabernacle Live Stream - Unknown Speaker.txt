Genesis chapter 4 verses 9 and 10 there we put a marker by Hebrews 12:22 2:24 man when I read from Genesis chapter 4 verses 9 and 10 and the Lord said unto Cain where is I where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I my brother's keeper and he said and he said what has dog done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground and from Hebrews 12 to Hebrews 12 22 to 24 but here come on to Mount Zion and on to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the General Assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel in the Lord of the blessing today we know Almighty God father we are so needy all we need your presence to come tonight to complete control of this silver slowly without you Lord we can't do nothing what we regard and very few present or common take over the surface and speak dear teacher why I am so needy tonight Lord if I am bigger than sufficient than myself Lord has said that your grace is sufficient for me that his strength is made perfect in weakness so many common strengths me tonight from anoint your world is in my heart Lord I'll speak to you cheering tonight speak to every heart tonight leader leave here blessed anointed and charged with your presence set the captive free and delivered with a bomb and he loads on the sick and family and we be careful to give you all the priests to give you all the honor give you on the glory awesome Jesus Christ amen young obvious it's tonight tonight for thought I want to speak on the voice of the blood the blood of Jesus has been speaking since it fell upon the earth had been speaking for seven churches when Cain killed Abel Abel blood cry out from the inert and to God and so the blood of Jesus Christ has been crying out on the earth from the earth before God for every name that was written in blood from before the foundation of the world so that night I want to take a look at the natural blood and a spiritual blood prophesied the natural types the spiritual so if we could get a look the function of the natural blood then we can see the reality of the spiritual blood for the life is in the blood I'm go to Alec trust Israel do not drink blood if you kill an animal pour off the blood because the life is in the blood and your blood speaks on your behalf the same way Jesus blood is speaking our behalf so today many people are coming to recognize that what they taught about themself and who they thought they would they have been deceived because the life in the blood is speaking something different and what they taught with this thing that they have DNA testing and to know the generations you came from the blood testing the blood and if I not know they are not who they thought they would so people think there was pure and believed this type of person discovering that they are so mixed up that they been living a lie all the time because the blood now speaking about what is the life in the DNA in their blood to the ancestral DNA tests that people are doing today so people are getting shocking discoveries about themselves because of what their blood is seeing to them and so it is in the natural so it is in this spirit because people and believers and Christians are saying this and saying that and say the other about themselves but the life in the blood is speaking something different so they are deceiving themselves by believing a lie and they're going to be damned by it so I want to show you something all the natural blood God give us a defense system in our bodies but there is nothing like it no ears it is so efficient and it is so complicated they are all type of warriors called cells in the white blood that have specific function to fight off and to ward off infections so I want you to look and see what happens in the natural blood before we go to the spirit because in the natural blood your blood is fight now demons in the physical realm in the form of illnesses and sicknesses in the spiritual realm the blood of Jesus is fighting on your behalf all them demons and spirits but the Devils are released him after you and it's only because of the blood of Jesus that is speaking on your behalf you have protection underneath the blood that you could survive and withstand the onslaught of the Devils that I ruin that is why in Egypt but in that Enza was about to strike go to al Moses let them take a lamb and take the blood put them the lentil of the door top on both sides when I see the Blood I will pass over them the blood was speaking for every name that was in the house the blood was a protection from the Death Angel for every individual that was under the blood so if an Egyptian recognized what the Israelites was doing and he take and do the same thing forgetting the same protection recorded blood was speaking so you as an individual have to know that the blood is speaking on your behalf so in the natural blood when something invades your system there are blood cells one is called a macrophage equally rough on to the invader and send signals of other cells you started coming there'll be a series of attacks they have cells called natural killer cells will come and scoot some highly toxic chemicals against the organism you have a very high fever because they want to bring the temperature very high that this organism cannot survive you will lose your appetite in what no food is a system because there is a war region in your body after the voice over there cells would heat up everything else then they leave what is called an antibody in circulation the antibody that is left in circulation after the war in your blood is over remains in circulation in case that seemed over missing combat to attack you again so there is a specific antibody after every attack in your system there is a specific antibody that stays in circulation in your bloodstream so in case that particular organ come back I can it is yet to defeat at one time you won't go 26 me something my just feel funny time where you feel it you will get to this it was that immediately so then they could take your blood Kyle to the lab and check it out and see well your fought against yellow fever dengue fever can attack against this so they can identify already because they are specific antibodies against this specific attack that you face it remains in circulation to protect you so that is the natural blood and that is all the natural operate now the life is in the blood is what able to do a lot but the Brennan said the life in the blood cell of Jesus is the Holy Spirit and that life come back upon the believer in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that lies speak for you so when Christ died on the cross and the PSSI his blood came upon the earth this blood of God is so powerful it came and sanctified the entire Earth I want you to get this Jesus blood sanctified the entire when it fell upon it when God sent the flood it baptized in order to justify it because Adam for affected the earth and God have to redeem the earth and this one process of redemption just if we can scientific asian and then I have baptism and the same we didn't really it he deals with the individual so you have to go to the same process so when Jesus blood fell upon the earth its sanctify the entire everything were certified under the Old Testament God actively chose Israel clean and unclean meats but when the blood of Jesus Christ came upon it it cleanse every meat there was not complete that's how powerful this blood is because when Peeta was Ali host of godsend on the sheet with every form of creeping crawling in a meeting on the I tell Peter killing it Peter said not me Lord nothing uncommon no unclean has ever enter into my mouth the voice said what God has sanctified do not call it unclean because the blood of Jesus Christ hurt upon it all these things were sanctified Paul was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he came along in Timothy and said every creature of God is good and nothing is to be refused it is sanctified by the Word of God and pray we are people today eating some things that you never think or didn't did frogs they snake not eaten cockroach they wrapped they eaten everything because the world said every creature it is a summer every creature of God is good and nothing is to be refused it is sanctified by the Word of God and that is how powerful the blood of Jesus is so on the day of Pentecost the life in the blood came upon 120 believers in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus was made a high priest after the order of Melchizedek he had to do his priestly duty in a blind blood for the blood to speak the Bible said he entered in once within the veil and obtained first eternal Redemption he took his own blood and sprinted upon the mercy seat in heaven to apply the blood for you and me and for every name in the Lamb's Book of Life and that blood been speaking ever since so every attack that the devil brought truly Church ages the blood of Jesus Christ overcame and defeat the devil and left an antibody to extend any other attack of the devil that come the same way so he told its chains at Ephesus you have tried those who say there are puzzles and a knot and you found them to be liars and you have them that all the doctrinal eighteens but faith in the world in that age defeated all them Devils when I come to the next age they came up with doctrine of balaam virtue when thought as a thunder and defeated all them spirits so for seven church ages the blood of Jesus been defeated every attack but it never bought against the church and live in the evidence by a virtue that thundered against the enemy in average an average the voice let him have an air hear what the spirit said to the church because the Spirit was speaking to the blood the blood is the life and the life is the Holy Spirit so at every age the spirit that was released for the age was speaking Express to the church in the age and given them the overcoming power to become the spirits that was released by Sita so for seven church ages the blood of Jesus Christ means begin now we come to the fullness of time we come to the last age the age of me Odisha so the fullness of the blood must be applied so the fullness of the life that is in the blood have to return and brother Branham said at the altar of the seven seals revelation 10 the full Word of God is to be born into manifestation again and vindicated by the Spirit of the court in its full strength as it was written manifesting the same we are doing the same thing in other words the same Jesus that worked it and Galilee had to come back well as Solomon looks sent in today in a Solomon to manifest the return of the fullness of the life of the blood that went to the seventh eighth ages the blood that was speaking and every age the prophet said the bride will be the mercy seat of God upon the earth there'll be no mercy nowhere else but the bride because the fullness of the blood going to be in the bride because the fullness of the life would be manifested in the bride the fullness of the pork on both we manifested in the bride he said bye and true the bride was great to fulfill all that Ben side of the Virgin he said they were here directly from God ask what of the day of Pentecost because the bride were to be the mouthpiece of God so look at this here we can talk Ian prophet coming to the platform and same good evening friends and that was the voice of God he said come to the unveiling of the mighty God before us and we unveiled God the world Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever for the wouldn'ta see and they couldn't see Christ the professor why they cannot see this he said because the Scriptures prophesied they will be blind he said the blindly additions cannot see this anima be revealed he said God has come down in the midst of his people and performing the same signs same Merkers and same wonders and they cannot see it the same as a mental telepathy the saint is fanaticism and it did not recognize Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but the panama's given the Ministry of Jesus Christ so all too is British coming up he was revealing Christ they saw so much of Christ in him the thought he was guys but Jesus Christ Himself was going to come as son ahmud to take up his own ministry as from a man he said come on the three sons named Solomon son of God and sana David he said before he comes as son of DVD millennium you have to come back as Solomon again she came back as Solomon in this generation and spoke spirit spoken words he said you must be born again of water and spirit of word and spirit so we've been feeding on the unfeeling by the word of the Son of Man therefore the Prophet identified that the foolish virgins miss the rapture because they reject the fullness of the atonement they reject the head part they reject the voice of the blood that Tunde seven times to these seven churches that defeated the devil at every one of his tricks when the two anointed word speak it is the voice of horde to recheck it is remove the candlesticks it was so simple that they couldn't see because God hide himself in simplicity and reveal himself in the same and they couldn't see the simplicity of the Living God standing neither man with a seventh grade education and no problem said he said before sudden boom they receive the last sign called will in flesh when he said that somebody in the condition said eyes not gold is he a saint that's not what but even : elude him that is God in flesh you see after that trouble and he said God has done the same thing this generation and to prove that he turn his back to the people and started this in the people's heart showing that no man could do that but God so it is the same chord that was here with Abram before Saddam boon is now stand with Abraham's seed and he format the bride doing the same thing given a promise of a time a life he came to Abraham I did my promise of a visitation in the time of life he give us a promise that seven thunders with the author's voices to the group who could take the word handed year he gave us a promise he going to write this trail again but they reject the voice of God that was veiled in the Prophet thundering in sweetness and purity and an undefined life but the problem was hiding a lot of things from those that or did not to see it he will settings to trough people that are ordained to be true love jesus told His disciples resume eat my flesh and drink blood young life anew and the true of a who'll be called come down to the twelve you say I have chosen you and one of you is a devil there was a lot people I remember a bandit didn't know who he was although he was a prophet that no revelation what is happening wrong about him when brother Branham preached the seventh cygnets he what he did he said this seven seal when it open it is a tree full revelation he identified the tree full revelation of secretary shall fall sixteen I shout our voice on a job and he put that back on the d70 he saw his picture and a full of it it is the seven thunders banging one two five six seven one time underneath he said his second full pass across him we didn't reckon a great was understand but he took the seventh seal and identified that is the common of the Lord when he puts his tattoo a perfect man in 62 he said when the last seal open it reveal Leo the Lion the second coming of the Lord Jesus when the priest says is the time he said if it is the common of the Lord don't be scared he recognized it was the first full of the cup of the Lord we gotta hide it when he came and preached this message the message came back to the Jews the trump visa trumpets any FISA trumpets he wanted it he said this 7c is open it is the common of the Lord his hide in the coming of the Lord by seeing the Seventh Seal is moving because it is the coming of the Lord but when he preached a rapture you identify he said what is a shout this is 65 is about to leave now so he's clarifying so many things that was hidden all along so he's identifying this out of seven thunders he said it is a messenger getting the people together he said it's a message going forward to gather the bride and then he said seven thunders gather the bride so it was these seven thunders which was Christ the Lion of the tribe of Judah speaking truly prophet given the promise for the bride revival he said all revival that there's no revival know where all the arrivals are over you say there is no revival for the church all the revivals are over so they have coconut galleons and then they turn and say the bride hasn't had a revival yet has a revival yet because she must have the revival he said it will take the seven I don't understand because at the time it wasn't known what he told us was he said we'll take the seven thunders back there to wake up and many commonly forty I say wait until those seven thunders uttered its voices to the group who could take the word and handed here they go into cotton they would have sliced they shot me heaven they better do this do that you be the voice of God speaking back the world award they called the voice of God going to be in the bride so God been hide him and reveal himself in the message Christ we finished all worldly prophecy God is in his word hiding himself from the great intellectuals and real himself the babes such as Whitlow listen 98% of the people new message don't know what the voice spoke in June of 1933 when bura balan was baptizing the same teen they know what the Prophet said when the Prophet said he said that in order to get people off of him and all truly master Harry policy as John the Baptist sent so are you sent with a message the forest second command The Voice didn't see a single message before his never said that to burn everything he said that because if you take the English language as meaning the same way as John the Baptist was sent to form the first coming of the Lord so and I use scent to fall in a second coming let me add sang with another message not as John was sent because the scripture said behold I send my messenger before my face to be played away before me I mean well has to be whole I send you Elijah if you want to know exactly what the voice said about abandoned tombstone in his commission exactly what the voice said if you go to the den on the door there's a screw that said exactly what the voice said in all the messengers is only about three messages you can find about a fandom aptly said what the voice said never said a message and I am Minister Singh is the message not the person so that keeps saying it is the message and the message but they don't know what is what about a message but Abraham said this message is the same message that Luther preached with something extra added he said this message is the same message Wesley preached with something extra added he said this message is the same message the Pentecostal preached with something extra added the revelation of the seven seals because is the revelation of the seven see which reveal Christ in the Sevenfold personage of his being as he walked through the midst of the seven golden candlesticks that will feel every other mystery that was hidden in the Bible it will really seven spirits of God that was veiled in that simple man that worked in Galilee it reveal Christ in the fullness of the core he'll go to seven compound with them tell titles in the Old Testament to represent the seven spirits aboard and butter balance said this is the messenger teaching I will tidy man that is going to be redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus I'm going to be an eternal Church it at the end of the seals the statue of a perfect man you say after you have added to your feet these seven things seven requirements the same voice of the speaking blood to the seven Church inches that defeated the devil's got to be in you because the leader of Hell has been uncovered and all the devil's of the seven truth is he'll be released against the bride what a balance that this is the most deceitful and decision of all the inches because people worshipping the devil think in the worshipping God in church he said the same where Satan came and deceived Eve with the world she won't even answer is the same word that God gives Eve cure deceive with no cause he had not one would I me identify that Satan has his bride that she is going to put on this plane because he came the god of Edom and disrupt Adam Brad and he came after Jesus bride and got a tire in Asia Council and from them he arrived in this bride and as fast as they come out he sent his host of demons fallen angel spirits in the same message the tabie people and make them believe that they all right make them believe that they have all these books when they believe this message they have to Hollywood is a lie but a panel for that Baptist spirits for all his ministry he fought against that back the doctrine when you believe you receive then he annoyed some of them to say that they are holy ghost when they prefer that you are not the Holy Ghost I am NOT yolivos he spoke playing for everyone to see I know men stand abhorrent saying I am he who knows the devil using the same deception upon a burnin preach the message and 9:20 n times he said it genuine Holy Spirit upon these people and the force because they teach in Rome not the Spirit is a genuine Holy Spirit upon them by the teaching force in the message look away to Jesus but abandon speak about what happened on your high River when the voice came no and he said I sent the phone the first coming so I sent with a message then later down with that same message he said 12 years after he walk in our church one word I spoke in tongues one parental interpret he sang what they said was exactly what the voice say at the river he went to one brother and he oxy missus do your way she was skeptical about tongues interpret he said don't you know that brother you say no you ain't never know never know and then Peregrine's repeat exactly what do you say so you want to see it and read for yourself take the message look away to Jesus and you will see where brother Bonham identify what the tones and he puffs he said and I said Johnny back to a center for the first common logic so I you sent the phone a second coming he had to see exactly what the prophecy because that is what before he said so many things are said and I hid but the voice of the blood going to show you the middle line because when were repelled until after the seventh seal night and just identified the seven zero he turns the Seventh Seal is opened Republic and that two hundred people and the city seven C is open forever after come back to twenty seven C and V D seven thunders just by the statement to offer who will be cold and they believe in this return ministry as you have to come back by that statement so you have to hear the voice within the voice because it's the voice of God will in the Prophet same things for the elect here and to trough others who not ordained to hear he said the bride will be the final voice to the final age and God is going to confirm the fullest version but by the bride because the Spirit the bride and the Prophet to be seeing the same thing go be speaking the same thing the voice of the blood want to be speaking the same thing nothing different and what she will say would have already been said in the world so you have to hear the particular voice you can't take what I see in for granted no you have to check me out check what I'm saying a sister came to me a while ago some watch Eternia but Terry you know I didn't find me they spoke about this together I see well looking the third seal you look at it and I felt so good to note this sister is on the word check it out what is being said but some people they just take whatever administer say and educate all you have to be like the Bereans you have to search the scriptures and see if these things be so or not you have to search the scriptures listen remember abandoned went to South Africa and go tell and go to do but I spent a month and these guys who brought him down did made their own itinerary super Abraham to take tell him don't ever tell me this is what I want you to do you know what was one big problem with these men in that itinerary these Africans people what the ball from Germany informing nothing they had believed that the native Africans do not have a soul you know when by the balance financially till it meets in the axe we are the natives he did see one natively make three defensive is didn't see one intentional when they had the equipment both taking they take one man's attempt are abandoned if you take his itinerary even the city natives because what a panel went Africa without bulletins for the natives I was only in Durban that is natives was we able to gain because of the apartheid system and the first meter per rep Adam had when he landed South Africa the first vision he saw was a bus Magdalene and a fella were a broken foot rock watch comedy bus in watching any bus came over the condition any city fella and he was the first person I call or domiciled was on this one but I'm said why will they take me from a please God is doing so much miracles and said him take him out clean and same quite odisha leave all these native people here to serve their own people because they believe this Bluff no soul prepared to deal with them on that so people does believe what they want to believe but if you are Christian I really Bible you will see where in acts it the Holy Spirit to Philip from a revival and centered Gaza turn it yo plain UNEP to set him down with a revival to Ethiopia to Africa and these people believe in these that people do not have a soul so people believe in what they want to believe and the clayman they believe the Prophet this is where you got to recognize he's honorable say any message any messenger because Satan is any message making a mess in the very message in the very message you will be shocked when you recognize the kind of deception that people but a balance is not the bootleggers going to be disappointed on the yet just his the people I put on the time coming to church I'm singing and having I didn't believe that this Living God they are the ones going to be disappointed because they wouldn't recognize that they was deceived all alone because as I said you must be born again and to be born again is to get the baptism of the Spirit of Christ in you that the life of the blood that no transfused into you as the Holy Ghost could propels me out to manifest those virtues that I pledge live or die Cinco John let these virtues live in me this is what must be our prayer we got to see the life of the blood speaking on our behalf we got to recognize that there is something more than our human spirit that is in us that given us the victory not just living a more alive because people live in a more life and I do have the oligos when I Brown said to be baptized will goes 24 hours a day and still misses because it gets done maybe one spirit may get in your flesh shake it dance in the spirit speak in tongues and prophecy son he listened and silvadene soon the predestinated seed that were put in your soul from before the foundation the Wizzle the only who's got to come upon that seed to kick it and to make it a life that the voice that the blood going to speak on your behalf Paul in speaking to the Hebrews who are the Lawkeeper they know all along and Paul had to show them all these shadows and all the types that isn't the law is pertaining to this Christ died so I tell them in Hebrews chapter 12 didn't come to Mount Sinai you know where the thunders and the flames and the blackness remanded sheikha Moza mercy exceedingly he said come to Mount Zion the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels that is the city representative in the pyramid that is the city not amongst an think about it this is God's dwelling place this is what tabernacle the Most High God doesn't dwell in temples made with hands as Stephen Ottertail describes and if Rises it's a body God has prepared and by one spirit we are all baptized into that one body so you have to press with all eyes in you to be baptized into the body to be in the church triumphant to be in the serious bride there's only one way to anything just as it did on the day of Pentecost that you can become a live voice seven live voices can be done during to you to others it could float to others they got to see it flowing out others the life of Christ not talk I live the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble touch Thunder this is monk Sian the bride of Jesus Christ this is what you must manifest by the life of the blood being applied the token being applied to you whenever the preachments fully token coming the end of the messenger he said three people he said many of you believe you have the Holy Ghost he said about your dog have it and I know it the person of the Holy Ghost in the Prophet was telling people that they believe they have the Holy Ghost and they didn't have it and as the same thing today many people the message believe they have the Holy Ghost and they don't have it so they're not seeking faith do not crying faith they not sighs wait but what about identifying one week or habit for everything you got a sigh and I got a cry he said God put it in this way as a child he said you could get more than telling a child listen I put up bail here in your field only ring the bell see that will work when the child gets hungry they will ball and ball and ball until you come and see them and if you are child and God and they recognize you don't have the Holy Ghost Brown said okay all done both on your head and bohu whatever it is I'll do to get it you're going to do it because I recognize you've got to get it it is absolute essential and compulsory and necessary that you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the always late time is short the world is falling apart friends you got to be sealing to the kingdom of God before the Harbour Bridge strike you got to hear the voice of God speaking to you personally you cannot rest night and day until your MIDI requirements you got to meet these requirements you say when God look down and see these requirements then he see you with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost which is charged then you become a sealed unit of the Lord God Almighty then you are push on he pleased and it gives us something to shake the nation's it's individuals possessing the individual inheritance in the promise on listen quad give the prophet a vision and he saw the bride matching he said they were marching in step proudly this plane the blood of Jesus Christ upon the chest the Word of God for the age in which they live and every age the Word was made flesh friends we really Bible read John 1 in the beginning was the word us record the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and we see Christ we see logos we see Elohim but you got to see yourself in that same scripture in every age friends the word allotted for the age was made flesh you are the flesh of the word for this age Malachi said behold I send you Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the Lord he shall turn the hearts of the father's to the children and he turned to the father's before I come and smite the earth with a curse you are the chair whose heart has been turned back to the feet of the fathers you are at Living Word and you got to see that living would be make manifest in your life in Revelation 10 8:11 the voice spoke to John and said go to the angel and take the book and eat it a child amount as sweet as honey on your belly bitter John went to the incident took two he said give me little book and heat it up John represent the bride to represent you turnips and the elect if you not eat in the book your talent prophesy again the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy we got a prophesy like Enoch was seven from the first Adam we got a prophesy the second full of the coming of the Lord in voice of the Archangel got to be in the bride to prophesy to all these rejecters the builders caretakers and dignitary the message that we check cries they reject the anointed Word the pastor what shall I do with Jesus called the Christ who is the anointed word Christ means The Anointed One the word and you got to be anointed you got to become a messiah upon the earth little Messiah sons of God all nature's groaning traveling waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God we are born son fill sons when to speak and here we're going to be backed you got to get to my channel to recognize who you are and what you are called to these sleeping scenes of the seven churches they are waiting upon us deal with all us are not made perfect we are called to make up the head stored for God to comment it we cannot just be coming to church I'm hearing a nice sermon we cannot be doing that we got to see our self in the world I start to act upon it here in recognizing acting upon the word of the Living God we come at the church and listen again that's what she meant a sermon I was really blessed are we not acted upon what we are hearing we're not burning our knees I'm saying Lord heal me let those who choose live in me O Lord is my prayer pledge to pray without ceasing until you fulfill the requirements flowing in this patio that you can become the manifestation of the Living Christ because he took your place
