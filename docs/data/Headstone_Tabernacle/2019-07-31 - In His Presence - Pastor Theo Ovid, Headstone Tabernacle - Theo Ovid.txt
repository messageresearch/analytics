to go into the scriptures we want to go into Isaiah chapter 6 we want to read from who's one to eat wanna go just in John chapter 12 when I read from verse 20 to 28 Isaiah chapter 6 beat him for this one date thank you so much for pressing your way coming out here tonight and may God richly bless you they sacrifice another vain the effort to press away and push on sweat it out not in vain we didn't chapter 6 of Isaiah in the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up his train filled the temple above it stood the Seraphim each one had six wings with twain he covered his face between he covered his feet between it it fly one cried unto another and said holy holy is a lot of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and houses for which smoke then said I o is me if I'm undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim's unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken from with the tongs from of the altar and he laid it upon my Mountain I said lo they said our lips and then iniquity is taken away and I stand purged and I hear the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me our last scripture fobs in John chapter 12 we didn't for verse 20 and there were certain Greeks among them that came to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Philip which was of Bethesda of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus and Philip comment and telleth Andrew and Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and jesus answered them seen they always come but the son of man should be glorified fairly very light unto you except the corner wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it he that hated his life in this world shall keep it under life eternal if any man serve me let him follow me away I am there shall also my Stephen be if any man serve me him will my father honour now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour father glorify thy name then came their voice from heaven saying I have both glorified it I will glorify it again let us pray father we thank you for your word tonight come into it Lord and bring us into your divine presence Lord and have the preeminence is Lord we love you tonight we thank you for this way that you have made for us and it's opportunity that you have given to us to access your Greece to access your love to access your presence granted father that your presence will be so will fill this place so much Lord that the people would leave there but change lives and change hearts change minds change attitudes transform souls granted father in Jesus and we ask it amen and amen you may be seated who praise the Lord hallelujah love him tonight it's always good to be in the presence of God tonight our title three words in his presence in his presence that's what I got tonight in his presence but Obama is saying that there was some I'm talking about these Greeks and they worship all kind of the gods and so on so Jesus attracted the attention and people that want to find Jesus is to find somebody who knows how to take them to him so that's why they came to the disciples because recycle is supposed to know whether to take care to isn't that right so a leader or one of his servants is the way they find them I want to read it again what usually the way that people want to find Jesus is to find somebody who knows how to take them to him a leader or one of his servants is the way define him so Jesus here we go if he ever chooses a servant he always chooses somebody that will bring the people to him what yes bring the people to who to him because it is his purpose to save the people now he find that they brought his watch that we find that they brought into his presence these Greeks Philip they consulted Philip and Philip said now here is someone I want to see our Lord so it wouldn't be just right for me to have the honor to introduce these Greeks to my lord I go get Andrew to go with me so they went and got Andrew and Andrew and Philip came and presented the Greeks to Jesus now there is a great thing that's the text that's unusual there's as soon as these Greeks are pointed to Jesus Jesus did not point to himself he did not make himself known to them because you cannot know Jesus in that way Jesus is known in that way the Greeks brought up that Jesus was in his presence it looks like Jesus would have said well I'm the Messiah of the Jewish race thus predicted by the prophets my inspiration down to the centuries I'm here now I am the board of Nazareth I'm a Jewish mother my father is God I'm here to make myself known to you Greeks that's sort of like holding modern ones this do today with the flag on VHS and show their muscles right but that's that would be more nineteen nineteen sixty one version of it program as soon as they brought in his presence that's the main thing get the people in his presence you see the object of this message is to bring people into presence not just information not just revelation but the word is supposed to bring you and I into presence or give the Lord some praises hallelujah get the people in his presence and as soon as as in his presence Jesus except a corn of wheat falls into the wrong and die it abides alone what an unusual thing instead of accepting the introduction the thing that he done was pointing them to the place that they could find him Oh glory to God hallelujah the place to find him yes some church some wait no no no he's pointing them to please except for corn or wheat fortune of growing and Danza but what if every pastor preaches is Donnelly what every minutes every elder point to people to Christ what are we finally gonna have it what the husband point the wife took Christ the wife pointed the husband to Christ your behavior is in Christ hey Jesus go behave like that how you behave and so ocher could imagine that could you imagine a husband telling my wife Jesus oh you people do even just like Jesus oh god I love you even more and the white tail in the husband that is just how Jesus was gonna be you and the children telling the parents that's og Livie here I'm the parent selling the chair that's how Jesus that's all now you're supposed to be here you know okay what did he do here he pointed him to that great truth how to see him they could not see him and the way of eternal life just standing there like he was he was a man so if we if it's so hard to see what the Prophet say we could talk and explain listen to what it is you know if we ourselves in our ministry in our thoughts in our life so he's talking about me pulpit to the Pew if we abide as we are we can do no good we have got to also die at the altar or we will live alone we will lift the some denomination or some Creed we will lift us some organization but if we die to ourselves then the Holy Spirit will be spread forth everywhere by our lips oh the mean enough to come back to that you mean the Holy Spirit was spread by the lips of Peter in the house of Cornelius because Peter was in the body and life was coming from the body the Mende returning to that while Peter yet spake these words Peter brought them into presence he then brought them under the anointing it wasn't just the breaking of the word was spirit and work together or get a lot of shock don't you want to see that don't you want to experience that or hallelujah you must want that tonight if we die to ourselves then the Holy Spirit will be spread forth everywhere by our lips we have got to die so many today we must realize that we have got to die in order to bring forth new life so he said so much of this if you want to see me you must die to yourself and then you will bring forth a new life but if we want to see him if you ever expect to see him you will never see him by joining a church some books of laws you keep some crease of yourself you will see him when you die when you come to Calvary and a crucified to yourself then you will see Jesus we would see him first before he said anything he pointed them to the place to find him like all Gentiles of all people you find Jesus a cross where you are crucified with him today we tried to fight him in everything find a fundamental choice building California mental domination can define him by saying some Creed we try to find him by keeping us sitting days or being certain rituals and I'd find him till become to Calvary dear we are crucified fall into the dust of the earth and died ourselves then reborn again then we find Jesus so many tried today to hold themselves and maintain their ideas I've got my way of it I believe this you see that is bad I believe this and if I believe this you know believe like me you off oh gee is that no matter that's it this is belief I believe and you believe and it's unbelief where's Jesus Jesus another belief this is a person I pushed me after meeting Harlan I want your meeting here same two days I look me here no he said let me cross you're gonna find me when you go dear hallelujah when you recognize you have to die and they come at the presence and you're gonna find out the sake of presence and the responsibility of presence you talk about that tonight okay the Lord some praises you right over me tonight alright so watch that is so many try you cannot find Christ to watch watch so many try to do to hold their selves maintain your own idea I've got my way of it I believe this but you cannot find Christ until you died yourself accept him the word then you find like that's why I say that the people have no disease in men actually who your posture is first or what you should go to then according to what you see then you see well you know oh ho and then the antennas go although you see but if that discernment they don't judge you by what church you go to or who your pastor is they're judging by what spirit inside of you or give the law some praises so we have to come at a genuine Holy Ghost scriptural discernment where you have to listen when somebody whether they have old clothes or new clothes it doesn't matter be closed its spirit a male it's what spirit like behind me whether you call me over here call me that will make them a Christian or come on I'll say Amen somebody Oh hallelujah whether their shoes have a hole in it that doesn't make him a Christian the kind of a hole in your shoes or glory to God or not you're still a Christian Alleluia you could be me models and still be a Christian because the Christ you will make you a Christian that Mattos is mental or glory to God you could lose your mind it doesn't change what inside your heart or give the Lord as you get there are some praises - one thing on heart is one thing or glory to God hallelujah praise God got to see what's inside that deal it and say he's a man after my own heart or like a veteran team a little card game a little first met David but when go out looking David he saw a man after his own heart all glory to God hallelujah his wife children and pull it off and pull it off hallelujah quantum entanglement and that's when tangle of he says stay here limit my show limit I'm not gonna let you go up when only we stay attack or I'm not staying here why I gotta get a Tang government already either wrapped up and tied up I really can't even explain it something pushing him on something have to push you you can't even explain it you fall though you get back up they were strapped back up you're like a pumpkin ball we can't get rid of you we can't shake you off or Chloe the core you want to strum blur here somewhere here but I stopped you or we let go because you already get an entanglement but the Spirit of the Living God or glory no God no man could come except the father draw him for you to come something must draw you so you have already been entangled with the Spirit of God that's why you yet tonight that's why you receive this message tonight that's why you receive a prophet tonight you already tango whether you feel it or you don't feel it little sensitive when I get my entanglement 1974 a hungry intention of the righteousness oh god I tell my parents that I some day when they didn't want me to come to this message I said some I said some day I'll come back to it what if something's in my soul or glory to God and I get back to it you have to get back to where you belong I belong in this thing nobody can boot me or kick me out they can take my name off the book did our permission today to feel it my name I mean blood section of the book home somebody gonna take out my name they don't like me like you okay God love me oh praise

disciples of the day what did it do if they come to the cyber city he said this he's the same yesterday watching but if you come to a true disciple to D they did the same the Greeks brought them into

for today they try to take you to a cradle or to a manger or to our Santa Claus Auto bunny rabbit or anything other than instead of Christ they never they bring you in the presence of Christ Oh hallelujah today they bring you some other please there's some stature some church some organization some doctrinal laws but you never get into the presence of Christ so the way I believe it this fool

God for your miracle should be even caught for your blessing you believe in God you want people to know you believe or glory to God Amen alright so here I want to get to a real true disciple would bring you right straight in the presence of Christ and from dear Christ would show you what you have to do I want to hear a bigger shout than that I really true disciple would bring it to who interpret into his presence and then Christ will tell you what to do except for with a corner each Falun Gong and I'd abide alone all glory to God hallelujah not bring it to church bring it to Christ bring it a presence please go to husband giving trouble pray for him why give him trouble pre for her she has to come into presence Oh glory to God we talk with ya be kong's to be saved this but until that power that presence come down hallelujah you in the same shape something have to happen hallelujah praise God and you can look to yourself you look to the Lord to inspire you yourself have to come under the inspiration you yourself have to be inspired just appreciate to get inspiration to bring his message you have to get inspiration as a believer believers inspired you know it's a peace sign shall follow then I believe you know that scripture for believers you know you don't have to inspire you you have to be annoying table design shall follow them that believe you have to take that upon yourself as your scripture they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover and my name is shall cast out devils if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them or glory that one why because you are believer and cocolonia we'll true believers so God will test what you really believe or glory that God may be the true disciple of Christ he believes that a cross oh praise God so the reason they didn't accept Jesus because they were living in the glare of the law and when Jesus came he was contrary to the law but he come to fulfill the law they couldn't accept him because his message wasn't exactly the way they had tweeted it out it wasn't in the tradition they come like chemistry in that here they have the only local taste of holy messages to be presented and if you don't come according to local teas it's a problem now I ain't talking Yankee and I ain't talking American I ain't talking English I talking just obvious talk here but this is a different approach because this is bringing these promises from this year and some people don't like that they like if any preacher could explain things and talk things and just talk just killing time talking and just making up some time but this is the word here watch they couldn't accept him because his mission was exactly the way they had it all cleared out and it wasn't called it was ten call traditions didn't come according to their traditions he didn't keep the traditions and really he upset it and toy top don't think that was contracted in so much that they thought he was breaking up the churches but they couldn't receive him because of his message and we know today he's come exactly in line with God's prophecy and didn't know them and it could happen again and we wouldn't know it I imagine if he would actually appear tonight it would be so contrary that what we gotta figure in our chance no they have chance okay no chance I know school and things that I see when they make the chance it has to come up on to the job because they make it up Oh Harlan but God common tickets would and interpreted and he will begin the tickets with know what you're gonna begin to see you will see Court interpreting the would in your own life that's is what you want begin to see now God beginning to interpret the word in your own life oh praise God hallelujah but a Branham he said no watch the look we get in slothful the churches get them so worldly so indifferent their mind so muddled up with television we love Suzy and you can't tell them these things are wrong and they think you're crazy what is it lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God he said the greatest pleasure I know of is to pray until I can realize that I'm in the presence of God and recognize it I team that oughta be the chill of the church is the presence of the Holy Spirit seeing the God that made a promise standing among us and to feel his presence and to see his word under see it finding it ought to give faith to make the cripples walk the blind see the Deaf hear the dumb speak all glory to God so when we come into the presence you've commented the supernatural you're coming under the expectation but God to do miracles among you listen biblical sit there intellectual with no expectation forgot to move or glory to God is sitting there for information this isn't if a revelation and understanding but when you begin to understand you have to come into presence then is beyond the man behind the pulpit or God is beyond eaten and illidan and laws of the church he won't be on that Oh hallelujah understand this the woman with the blood issue example she came and Paula self touch to him of his garment she wasn't coming to a man he was coming to a bank she was coming to make a withdrawal she had coming to see Jesus the imine stand in the air and speak in words she had come to hear no words she was Marian or Sherman he has come to touch the hem of His garment because she recognized power was resident in that man or glory the corner what he have to lose out what he she had said to pull it out there where everybody was around him everybody touching him and bouncing him and they get in that pain but this woman well Cory got this woman well hallelujah push she crawled she move along until she get to touch him then she withdraw from that bank of power or glory there go easy who touched my clothes because everybody touching her he said no no no no no this touch was different Oh glory to God somebody with draw somebody pulled on the power somebody pull up anointing somebody pull out virtue power for sinners somebody joy it out or give the Lord a shout then Jesus knew who would draw he said woman died maybe hole he didn't say my power or my virtue the fate Oh glory to God and what did whatever I was sent to do he said to tune your hearts back what to the faith of the Father success what the fitme success see it say it again your faith was like that power will give the Lord a shout so you have to know tonight that you have what it takes to pull down the power of God now if I don't speak this you wouldn't know you have it and you wouldn't expect it they will expect me to bring word wood wood I'm telling you we have to change over under the expectation for the power of bottle ricochet to the church when that glory came knowing Solomon dedicated a temporal the minister could not minister because the glory of God came and sell the whole house but was so pleased but the wisdom of Solomon and the burden of Solomon to bring a temples of God and this is a temple to be built and live in hate living with you live in knowledge this touch of a perfect man and living host a living brain Squad monument of the God's plan in place and when that homes is built I could see the glory I could see the power I can see the anointing coming up on that house [Music] what with the strong that holds my glory hallelujah when he is not recognized this power is not revealed when he is not recognized no matter how much God is standing present you have got to believe it you know I took my woman and they were caught behind the country we do one more blood issue but Ron T when he is not recognized this power is always not revealed so if you want a revelation of his power if you want to loosen his power you have to begin to recognize they're not coming to church you're coming into presence his presence not the presence of pastor his presence okay the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah what happened this little woman had an issue of blood and she heard about him and when she come down there we go so anybody said she recognized who it was if I could touch him of his garment order standing there might have been sicker than she was but you know what she recognized his presence so that's deep enough not only must you come in but you must recognize his presence and when you recognize his presence you have to act upon what you recognize you're just bored Isis presence is present no act upon it do something in it or glory to God act upon it Lord heal me now but your hand away you're sick do something Oh God fill me now hallelujah deliver me now let's continue if we could only realize that he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose one purpose that is to release our desires that we have in him to us but we have to recognize its presence so you have a desire for deliverance of your family that's inside your heart hallelujah and you come here with one purpose for him to release that desire that you have for your family and his presence coming among us and you recognize the presence and I'm not anointing I clean them I claim a complete deliverance every demon to come on my house my home my family hallelujah I came a complete deliverance I plead the blood of Jesus Christ Oh glory to God you're claiming that clip us nothing and 19 you're claiming your healing you're claiming your breakthrough you are playing your feet you're not sitting on here in here in here and now you're acting upon what you're hearing because we are teaching you the keys Oh glory to God to access the spirit Oh hallelujah oh praise God so how how you recognize his presence it's been the promise word for this age is read manifest not the promise would have Moses age or any other age a promise would of this age Oh glory to god that's why brotherly kindness ought to be manifested but the kind of sad to be vindicated it's not to have evidence of brotherly love not just I forgive you but the spirit of brotherly kindness have to strike the truth to strike you as individual people sitting up with anger in church bitterness in church hatefulness in church having odds in the church God forgive him the church and put around prophesy he lost almost all the coins but when the church finds his Brotherhood or glowing equality lawsuit you have to find it we'll give the Lord a show give the Lord a show if the lawsuit has to find it and to find it you have to look for it or get the Lord a show he said she had a whole screening time she swept the walls she swept the floors she swept the walls she swept the cobwebs she says her neighbors could see the dust fly no that is what I want for this church just not to be flying out let other churches laugh let me warm up and let them up and say what they want to see that's a business but you have to clean up gotta clean out to find a coin that you was lost remember pizza and James and general M is a story of us we once had this coin we had once had this power those brothers represented us in the Alpha Church they were us they are our story we went back to that we find in the presence of God God man recognized himself to be sinners so hope somebody could claim and the arrogant and CD that is impossible let me say it again that is impossible a man cannot be arrogant and claim to be in God's presence because you're why we find out in the presence of God man recognize themselves to be sinners we may feel pretty good when we are open different places and feel like we are pretty good people but when we ever come into the presence of God then we see a little bit yeah then we realize how little we are when we realize how great he is and how close we come in the common of the presence it is always showing a great effect upon people who come into the presence of God I have seen the time in my ministry where you would see the presence of God comment in such a place that it would bring a person up and reveal the life to them call all their sins and all kinds any moral acts and bring it as such holy hush among the people till they will drop out of the prayer line before they ever come to be grateful run to the altar and get right with God before they come into his presence there is something about coming into the presence of God it causes things to happen I've seen people in cuts and stretches we have to fight for that you have to sweat for that Oh glory to put it gonna happen again yes you have a promise I'll write Israel once more give the Lord a show oh the Holy Ghost the white horse rider going to write the trail once this time upon a bride Oh glory to God there'll be one more rider oh give the Lord a shout you know what I said there'll be one more rhyme hallelujah you see that night in Mexico when I little dead baby leaned on the blanket little Spanish mother brought up a little Mexican mother brought up when the several thousands of those people saw 75 toasts not one gathering saw that little baby come to life woman fainted people to the hands up and scream why they realize that a human being could not do that and that they were in the presence of Almighty God and it caused something that happened and I am saying to you tonight we have to begin to see things that human beings cannot do and you will know that you have been in the presence of Almighty God all glory to God we could talk whole night we can explain whole night but when that presence

Finney was going to try the acoustics after spending much time and prayer for revival II you hold each other's voice to see how it will carry he slipped up quickly to the propeller and said repent or perish and he said it was that force after you know under the anointing of God till the man dropped out from the top of the battery don't worry Flo I'm top of the building onto the floor he preached the gospel to be preached the gospel in such a way till he stood in Boston Massachusetts in a little bit window because I was no church that could hold his crowd he stood here with such mighty force and pre-sell such a place until working men with their basket under the arm fell into the street and scream for mercy in the presence of God great preachers who have been able by the Word of God to bring the presence of God to the audience aha Menino talked back to me great preachers have been able to bring what by the word the presence of God to an audience do you want to see that are you experiencing that you could have more of that God could bring the presence hallelujah glory to God healing fabbi it that a man would be so share in their hearts till they could never recognize the presence of God or glory to God when man fell the first reaction he had sinned he tried to come into the presence of God sin upon his soul he could not hide because he was tender yet sin had not took a hole like his Reutimann peoples had today you're very conscious he was telling for his creator my god Genesis Abraham come into the presence and when God moved his presence the patriarchs fell on his face because he couldn't stand the presence of God he could not stand as his feet when he come in God's presence he felt his face like Abraham did he could not stand the presence of God or glory could is a effective comment across the presence oh yeah you can shake my hand but could you shake God's hands oh yeah you could talk to the deacon and talk to the elder but could you get in contact with that Living God when that power struck by the Branham he was in a corner there he was numb afterwards he said you talk but blessings but you don't know the presence or glory of God you've got to come into that presence oh come on that an anointing you have to live on the deer have to be part you have to be this is your life this is where you live this is your address so Florida but he call you oka coming to the land of the Holy Ghost or give the Lord a shout he call ya'll Tulare loud easier MacRay it is probably kindness what's after that is Holy Spirit or gives a lot of show so after loud easier the Holy Spirit wait when I live in the spirit you're gonna walk in the spirit you're gonna preach it gonna sing you're gonna play music in the spirit or give the Lord a show you talk with a glorious church without spot or wrinkle and no I did with court Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah when them guys are efficient all night catching nothing I'm Jesus come and Circassian it in I went inside a bring up modular fish Peter said be Pat from me Oh Lord I'm a sinful man who said that st.

to show in a message they have never really come into the presence of God Paul realize he was wrong when he fell to the ground under the influence on power you think books and tips could explain to Paul Saul about this this presenting god no no books that catch in the middle there's a big fish but after catch and his only power can lick him avi hyo's because you in the Christians he pursuing them he anointed and commissioned to go get them but caught anointed and commissioned to go get that son or give the Lord a show under people oh they're gonna release powers and get them all glory to God power is about the bridge what I was about to bring up nothing gonna stop it [Applause] nothing gonna stop it Oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God when he looked up and seen the very God he had been preaching all against I'm talking node I'm seen he was wrong he fell on his feet to the ground because he was in the presence of God he's seen the picture night it like one brother bring some kind of picture for me some okay I think me hopes light your light like that I ask myself what am I supposed to do with that now is he adopt pictures which isn't that I want to know what is behind that I can't explain that what I do know is that my heart have to be literally back to the faith within a proof he said Jesus a man of God approved good signs and one of them I gotta prove him this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased go put that stamp upon him and then send the hard test and she there was something as you know your name is in my all that come my always that jet come when it's time come here some way I always come what shall I say but God I come to thee and now I come to thee when I was three so far I have to die if I want to see my family get a bridge and after day but call your head that you could not be deposed in the mental pictures no Holly with you today Oh hallelujah crying stop it he called you to visit he call it the test it he call it to be a partaker of it or glory to God hallelujah praise God hallelujah don't consider the test any kind of thing I recommend of trials of this present world is done worthy of the glory that shadowy feeling us and what can reveal enough is what the whole creation I've been crawling for all these years no one that I prefer said God will do in one year what all the theologians still to do in 2,000 years you are looking for that I'm looking for that oh oh I always knew as dynamics to do it I always knew it was an explanation of this word let's continue Oh glory to God hallelujah Jacob supplant the deceiver run all his life away from God but when he got one time in the presence of God in pinion in the face of God II he hold on to God I wouldn't let loose because he saw was enough terrorism film he said ya face a man boy here money bigger face him he have hopes his we can't face him you have a boat you have a fancy car but he still kaffir see brother or Chloe the what pressure but when he come in the press of the angel he saying let you go not tonight not tonight not tonight another night but not tonight I come too far to turn back now they roll on the floor angel tried to get away grab the foot when you see grab a hand rustling all night long you have to be determined to rush that way you know that's the one to be changed that way you know you have to want the stretches out the Lord show and many people don't want to sweat it out you wouldn't turn him loose God we need more cheek cups here long to the face of calling the princess of God and still the one until the much Sun up man chord yeah we go back hungry God managers are we to get men in deep in his presence then they make the decision some of them run from him some of them run to him so whenever presence coming is to direct in the guru you could run towards the presence or run away from the presence hallelujah you know what Jonah did right a man running from the presence of the Lord collision hallelujah Oh pray Psalm 16:8 I accept the Lord before me this is hold even begin the practice practice I have set the Lord before me so he could not be confused about it he wanted to be listen listen he wanted to be conscious of his presence so David said I have set the Lord all before my face I David I've set the law before my face always to be conscious of God's presence would not be a good lesson for us tonight set the law before our face watch.watch so we can be conscious of his presence put him first put him first wife then you won't sin when you are realized that constantly you are in the presence of God when you realize God is all wrong you'll watch what you say you will watch when you do you will watch where you go because you are conscious you have to set back no Emma you have to set that if you have to work to achieve a goal like you have a yearly goal I know same with me a yearly goal or five-year goal you want to have thousand dollars or whatnot you could break that down in two years what months what I've been in weeks what I mean in days if you're making it by the day you reach a goal if you're not making what you're supposed to make you but not reach a goal well the same thing in God what's your goal in going you want that live in Fayetteville it won't achieve that by your days not by your months by your days every day daily depression is you have to be committed to prayer every day you have to be committed to is praising him every day you have to be committed to that is a responsibility to move up into the presence of God or glory to God hallelujah listen listen I have put the Lord all before me that's a good thing no wonder God said he was a man after his own heart man will do anything when he think God is near but when we realize that God is near did you ever notice a sinner let her godly person walk up them quit cussing because your presence bring conviction on his cousin spirit so our SS cousins but you just coming up because some company Kristin come in when we come into his presence we are changed never to be the same look all to the edges every walk of life when well the change life is just for ministers no no no this bar boundaries again the change life is for the minister oh no the change life is for everybody he's a preacher he's strong he's getting most of the blues you know because every day they're trying to out him think about the thing about this think about it now smite the shepherd the sheep will scatter never keeps alone he come to steal to robbing to kill Oh hallelujah are you with me so now watch something please let's continue so after coming to the presence after these things you have seen it and coming to his presence you are responsible for the message to get to somebody else you cannot sit still with it you must take it to somebody else how much people really come into the presence because the presents have an effect enough for you any message everybody rapture which approach presence it's a very fact upon your burden comes upon you then you live in for God you want to witness you want to testify you want to invite people to service you want to tell them or the Lord because what God has done for you somebody testify to you somebody call you somebody invited you somebody witness to you who are you witnessing to them say if you don't give God praise and testify your friends have bastard in one day it's not the way but there is something about it when you find Christ you cannot hold your peace any longer the rest of your days you are changed pushing for when life and life comes together it makes a bright light and then when the bird connects with the wire is a correct bulb it's got to give light and when the current and the bug gets together there's nothing to scuttlebutt right Oh Oh Isaiah Brooke into this vision presence of God if they go with me I'm undone man of unclean lips and then he saw this cherubim is next two cherubim something like a Seraphim something like an angelic being it isn't an angel it isn't an angel it's a special person and they are the bigness of the sacrifices service and they were flying to the temple and Isaiah was in a vision the whole temple become full of smoke on a book crying holy holy is the Lord God Almighty there is something I kind of feel there is your example so these beings with sick wings was an example damage to the king holy holy and we find out these six winged creatures and now we're gonna study the reason they have six wings they had he said to recover their face I mean know what it is they said that's reference we find today there's no reference sadly fine they have no respect for God reference we ought to then he's breaking it down we ought to honor one another respect one another as brother and sister love one another oh yes this is something flat tonight it's not an ordinary night they're not bigoted mister you know this is the mission top new mysteries this is easy mr. Ebert love oh you can respect your brother and talk to him in such a way Oh glory to God come on respect one another hallelujah glory to God are you with me tonight what what you say well I just can't well just stay a little longer and then you would like people to you would love those people doesn't love you and that's a good sign of Christianity you want to test your Christianity see all the people that don't like you and so you're gonna like them back under the getting troubled I like them back you have some more work to do you have some more Calvary to come to you have more presence to get into or give the Lord some praises we want the real deal come on now we want the real thing we want to stick on Christianity like false teeth or for his hand or false foot something that part are you but attached to you it's not ready part of you all glory to God you don't wanna false Christianity or glory your false love no phones brotherly kindness attached to you you want the real thing do I hear a man in the house you just watch them shake your head you know say Amen because I'm fine you don't a to say Amen because this after living you oh just have to become fresh in you Oh glory to God amen hallelujah praise God Jesus said if you do favors for those that do favors for you the public will do the same thing you must be kind to those one thing too you too good for those who do evil to you always remember that keep that before you then Court is watching you watching worth watching your life watching the attitude well glory to God now we find out these wings their faces well because they were in the presence of God so he's showing your how we gonna worship these would be bright you know this is bright stuff them Sara's has given testimony of how we supposed to be any image of worship to face reverence covering a face Oh hallelujah praise God are you with me but yet in the presence of the holy God they hide their face what is the backside are gonna do on that day what's the ungodly gonna do when these angels I've never seen her to cover their faces oh my secondly their feet covered with wings that represented humility Odessa will be lost today too many people humility in this presence to humble ourselves in a special you have your will but when you're praying I remember years ago pray pray my own thing and just to tell you you pray in your thread is normal normal normal I'm God boom I remember when I was first caught my Aunt Mary and the Lord break upon me about my she was my sister face then she become my wife a change the attitude of deal with her as my wife hallelujah number woman then you know Jesus talked already and a woman no no like that daughter God so it brings a different kind of thing all together in loving her and caring for her but it brings out different things all together but it the Lord has healed me for that because so whatever Rick you from your own national spiritual oh yes there's only one holy spirit and the holy space not a Trinidadian I say cornellà try that and God what he would so when you deal to be word you see more of God oh my let me see a current you quickly know humbly step in the presence I've seen the Holy Spirit come down into a room and perform do exactly that I remember one night I the Moi's our holiday Oh relax look watch watch I remember one night a minister brought 20th of his congregation I was sitting this was in Joinville unconscious and there an epileptic boy he was happy epilepsy and that's a devil it's a devil that's what it is doctors don't know what it is but the devil I mean hot clothespin and a rag wrapper on it and when he would get these fits they were shown in the boy's mouth cause he would chew his tongue so they brought the boy up he was having his fit right on the platform course when they get the least bit excited they will go into one so while you were fixing the pray for the boy I said will everyone bow their heads in reverence and I preached him the Spirit will not leave the boy like this things this way you know I look along I see a little group sitting there in the place I said would you bow your head I said you must obey I said that was the Commission if you get the people to believe me then you be sincere when you pray would you bow your head and they laugh at me so I turn I wrong and it would not leave the boy I know this was hundreds of people five times what it is here tonight they claimed there was twenty eight thousand people there and I said he said and then I said I wouldn't do that sir he and he belonged to a dimensional church that was just simply laughs a divine healing doesn't believe in such a thing I look along the poor boy is poured out his mother trying to holler crying like that the boy trying to swallow and going on I said Heavenly Father don't let this innocent boy have to suffer for that guilty group I said this is your word I've been honest and told him and so many of the epileptics have been healed at the meetin I said don't let this innocent boy have to suffer the mother and father brought him here for Missy and then I turn and I said in the name of the Lord Jesus by faith by my commission given to me by Almighty God this devil cannot hold this boy you are at liberty so he's talking to the devil you you at Liberty see if the disobedient will be disobedient then you have Liberty to go to them but come out of that boy and I saw 28 people with their pasta fall into epilepsy right or wrong and I'm wrong I'm wrong and I wrong in the floor like that as far as I know they still got it here is the prophet saying Lord don't let distinct things then people affect this boy hallelujah devil you have to go and if the goal you have to go so you're free to go so but you have to go because that spirit have a destination if if those people Reverend it goes straight out hallelujah but that ereference brought that spirit straight upon them every man-jack got including pasta that coming back you know because it could be caught again on this scene you know or Gloria could that coming back you know what glory to God the manifestation will be the interpretation you know going to interpret his own work you know go up on the vindicate his sons is that man chosen is God chosen let's continue glory to God hallelujah one time they bought a mantle to hypnotize me I guess many of you remember that they would take him out take army camps take these soldiers and hypnotize them make them back like a dog and they was going to have some fun out of me so I was in the auditorium and they brought this man and I felt when the prayer line started there was an evil spirit somewhere you can always pick them and that doubt they think they don't it was you could feel it it's different so then I could tell where it was cut but I couldn't see just where the man was and after a while so he in the spirit know after what I found it I seen what it was i watch the darkness haggle over him say see in watching normal people and he's looking he's courting me wonderful where that man is what what you different level here now looking for Tennessee doctors hanging dicey dude there that's the remedy spirit know that you do t have that this happen over Neely let's continue and I didn't want to say that but just turn around payments it child of the devil see why he has the devil put in your mind to do that because he's done that something was saying it to me they will be over here and he is still paralyzed still paralyzed letter after letter come to him I said the only thing I know is repent see I had never did that that was your ereference before god no don't you do that oh my hallelujah praise God now we come times that people think that this holiness before God is some kind of mockery or some kind of bunch of people that doesn't know some kind of cult or plan but let me assure you brother there may be a lot of mockery I don't see that isn't I can't say that I'm just a man I ain't no judge I just come to preach but there's a genuine Holy Spirit they are genuine a Pacific Paul the Holy Spirit and in foreign countries witch doctors and things rise up them Devils the challenge if I'll break my subject here that could I tell you about those things I've seen on an Holy Spirit never one time fall into a praise God no they put for the wings humility we and we don't like the bow ourselves we want to think we are somebody nobody want to humble themselves everybody wants to keep this self you know I am this I am that nobody want to say I'm sorry I'm wrong I missed a turn I need to get back on track this is what God wants the thing of it is people brother sister and friends it's the be conscious of your littleness don't be conscious of how big you are because just hold it you are you are small we are all that we God can do without us but we can't do it on him all glory to God God isn't trying to find one person he can get in his hands you always try to do that unit is all along to the Bible he just got to give you just got to give you all to God your reference your respect everything you are just be nothing and Co little you can and what God wants to do first that's real humility that's the way the surfing zionist presence you see their thesis reference the feature members you know terribly they could fly there are two wings and that put them in action God is showing his profit here what kind of servant he has prepared reverent humble and in action that's the real servant that God is looking for Oh hallelujah oh my own home stretch you know since John 14 2000 fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that the New Jerusalem is a place that men ought to worship this is a woman at the well talking to Jesus and Jesus said woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet to Jerusalem we should the father you worship you know that what we know what we worship for salvation of the Jews but I our commander now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him no we couldn't do that why because the truth was lost to seven ages so course send the Angels to Cana all these scattered word the tide back in the world to bring along the Holy Ghost that's what the seven seas was all about Dakara all over to bring down the Holy Spirit that we could have mechanics and dynamics we could have word and spirit but we can correctly worship God no we have the truth we need a spirit to have the word truth and spirit word and spirit hallelujah the father seeketh such or give the Lord I show you meaning this message Almighty God looking for two worshipers or glory to God hallelujah brother branham mechanics in what runs the automobile is the dynamics of run-ins the mechanics don't run the church is the dynamics the Holy Ghost that gets into this world it is not seminary that teaches you all the theology and Greek interpretations but it's the dynamics of the Holy Ghost in there to set that afire and bring it to pass and to make it live exactly what the promise Wofford is are not the mechanics the dynamics it takes the mechanics and dynamics the word of the Spirit they are the one that gives life or glory to God what God promised for this hour look for it to be fulfilled what what God promised you after know what God promised don't look for it to be fulfilled you can't expect what you feel to be fulfilled it's what God promised if God promised a seventh on the revival just one marries ival not seventh under talked seventh on the revival Oh glory to God hallelujah sorry the cornea and let's continue until the church becomes what mechanics and dynamics and the Spirit of God that moved him do the same things he did if he hit on 16 cylinders sober the bride for he said in Saint John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall you do also I will give him a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics and the world will not be able to withstand it you hear about the clients we become cross mechanics I'm caught bring a charge it have you let your cars right no yeah the plug is in look at that charge way to go if you don't plug it in you have nowhere to go you have a whole night you take a brand new and it's not charged up you only person taking pictures you will go nowhere when you plug it in anger be charged then your car could go right this bride she's mechanics and dynamics is the charge I mean longer you stay anymore chat on your battery or glory that God God and charge up the brake battery we want to leave you and smoke him smoke in the devil's face or glowing avoid smoking hallelujah smoke coming from the bride never get confused because of pride leaving your Shelton or give the Lord of princes people it will only work watch watch watch watch that's the Easter message mechanics and dynamics together the mechanics with all dynamics no good neither is dynamic soil mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want and the 90s word you will do no good you're cranking along the Pistons it will only work as they come together so one will set still and the other one will go up Oh glory to God that's the only thing there is to it they might look like both came to be churches both tend to be bright but one has mechanics Oh glory to God is that your expectation tonight to see a church with mechanical dynamics or glory level it won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until dynamics come and when the dynamics come that fire is mythical equity octane in the gasoline and when that explored it caused a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for he the same yesterday today and forever that is the resurrection that is the real power of God mechanics and dynamics it is the spirit of quick left Oh glory to God hallelujah and look all the profit time dynamics and mechanics with worship and earnest love this almost on the home stretch yet Romans 8:11 if the spirit had raised christ on the dead being you it will quicken your mortal bodies if the split and really is on the dead it will be in you and we're cooking on water bodies quicken it what does the word quick means it means to be brought to life after death and there is the gift of worship worship in spirit and in truth mechanics and dynamics together so genuine worship comes when we have mechanics and dynamics together almost done Gideon comedy piano hallelujah or glory to God or glory to God hallelujah or you enjoy the word tonight as Daniel the seven thunders and forbidden to write John heard the voices and this book was sealed and the back of the book receiver seven seals but in the days of these scenes will be open listen the mystery of gotta be finished in other words God would be known to his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God would reveal and when that was completely revealed remember what we said some couple of semester back we have been living in a time of the revelation of these things being made known but after the time of the revelation of these and be made known God gonna come to dynamics to bring the manifestation of the things that have been made known Oh glory to God so watch now he said God will be known to his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God revealed and when that was completely revealed then the seven mysteries would open to the church because in yeah we go the church would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out among us show any signs of being alive living among us and them we are worshiping the Living Christ that's a mirage that is what you have to look for him moving in and out the Holy Spirit Oh glory to God last
