and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day a man and a man others turn over to Isaiah chapter 60 and first three verses there and it says arise shine for that light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall a child shall come to thy light and Kings to the brightness of

life was the light of men and the light shine it in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not it understood it not isn't alright now let's skip down to verse 9 and today it says that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world he man is now right he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but this morning as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God that's you this morning and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth and now we want to turn lastly over to Acts chapter 1 a man familiar Scripture a man this is all a scripture this morning before we take our seats Acts chapter 1 book of Acts and from

somebody Oh glory be to God my subject is recognizing your teen it's message and my inspiration is the Word made flesh a man and a man 11 this morning so praise God today's would I trust is a word of inspiration to you a word of inspiration from the law we need to be inspired if the Word of God is not inspired to us then it's just words that we're hearing then it's just Church that we're coming to then it's just a building but when God is here it becomes more than a building when card is here it becomes born in a church but you've got to be inspired you've got to be in the spirit of the comment of the Lord you got to be looking for his comment watching for us coming waiting for his comment praying for his common seeking for his comment oh because he is comment oh mary don't recognize it but jesus said a little while and the world will see me no more they were going to their lolly and they will say all nor delay it is coming but you shall see me because I lived she shall live also and greater works and this shall you - because I go unto my father Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when you realize when you recognize your Tay in your message you will do the greater works same and somebody God's Word must be inspired a man you mind if I take my time this morning but when it's inspired it comes to life to you the individual and that's when we hear it that's when we recognize it and that's when we're ready to act upon it isn't that right and then when we become convinced and then concerned about the time and the season and the day that we're living in Holly is now so the Holy Ghost wants to come in more than ever before and place the church positionally it's now but it's been bound by creeds bound by talk much but in the evening time there shall be lights that's a promise this morning I don't care how bad you feel I don't care how messed up you feel in the evening time in the top time in the shadows of the dying world there shall be light oh you're not hearing me this morning Oh hallelujah if you heard me this morning we'd have to fix the roof because you'll be on your feet Oh hallelujah don't worry we're gonna get to well what is the line well in order for us to understand what the line is we have to go back to Genesis isn't that right we have to go back to that original light that God spoke in the beginning so let's go back now Genesis 1 says that when God made the heavens and the earth that he earth was without form and was was void and there was darkness so here was three problems that we have the first problem is it without it was without form which means the earth was in chaos it lay in ruin it lay confused it was messed up there was also another problem the earth was void it was void of life there was nothing in it try and imagine a world with no animal life no human life no living creature nothing in it just the deadness of silence it was void of life Freud of action void of movement Oh hallelujah hallelujah furthermore it was another problem there was also doctors you couldn't see anything because there was nothing to see there was no light at all there was nothing anywhere Oh hallelujah what a condition sounds like the condition that some people find themselves in Freud of life without form pop this all over can't find a space and find nothing Paulo trying hard to prayer feel like you can't find your way I feel like God is here too small to do something different to speak a word into season spoken word into season how could it is so is what up for it was void empty and it was talk there was no light in there at all so then the only way God decided to move forward because even if he wanted to give the earth form we still have to see what we were doing I didn't order to deal with the voidness in order to deal with the emptiness we still have to see what we do in there was a problem that he had to deal with this problem of darkness stood in God's Way of doing something about the earth that he had created in the earth he had created were seeds and those seeds were predestinated to bring for life to bring forth herb yielding fruits to bring forth trees but they were covered over by this darkness oh there was a boy there was emptiness there was nothing Oh hallelujah hallelujah and god looked at the darkness and he didn't argue with the darkness he didn't complain with the darkness he didn't have a meeting in the darkness he didn't issue a warrant to the darkness he didn't get back to the darkness he didn't get upset with the darkness he didn't get out of the atmosphere when he approached the darkness no no no no no all God had to do was speak a word and God said Let there be lights part is now worried about the topless this morning gorgeous has a speaker learn his thoughts are not your thoughts his ways are not your ways his ways higher its Ouisa thoughts but before it can become a word it had to be a thoughts so when he let me like in your home let me light in your hearts let me light upon you lift up your hands worship God in the sanctuary let the light of God come upon your soul and make you a new creature a new creation we are the children of the light we are no longer slaves of sin or we are children of God we are born for such a time as this we will raise the percent of promises let there be light in this message in this world let there be light we declare it or faith declare it we are our Father and we speak a word the small with me toward the spot right at evening time right in the middle of the topless [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he's here it's angel is here pill up light it up five simple afire little North Sea st. Pella fires hair to divide himself among you give you a portion of a spear in your soul let there be light burn the demons out in the spirit Stanley anointing stay in the presence of God don't let nothing shake you don't let nothing hinder you don't let nothing keep you back the topless has to roll back the spot oh I feel the faith is rising hate is rising sicknesses scream at the pebbles are running is rising [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Heather let's finish darkness robot you are defeated the enemy is defeated he is defeated this morning receiving a holy close you are children of the light receive the anointing this is you're annoyed yes come by L or I need the Holy Ghost yeah I am standing a lead up prayer handing I need a deliverance god help us this morning reach up and grab it reach up and grab your promise this morning yeah well glory this is wonderful oh my oh my oh my let your soul find a spot [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] are you gonna be the lever he can be deliver you can be deliver right now right now in this place all glory to God glory to glory [Applause] oh my message oh Jesus dynamic steel mechanics dynamics Co mechanics the quickly and quickly pound the quickly power it's riding in this morning he's riding in on you he's feeling it away he's tearing the devil's from you close eyes there's the Holy Spirit anointing here close eyes wherever you are lift up your hands the enemy is defeated this morning Oh hallelujah demons are running demons are running this morning stay in the spirit I don't know what's going on party's here now pillow fights in our angel is here now he's taking control yes we got his ring Michael is here to chop the enemy away from you Michael is here to take the sword of the Lord and chop the enemy to ribbons the devil is through you reach up and grab it reach up and grab it pull it God give you fake God give you atmosphere tonight oh yes oh yes oh come by allergies my allergies my allergies [Applause] [Music] my money [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] moving huh what is a yes-no yes-no you feel its presence here oh I won't be long with you this morning not all what the Holy Spirit is already here you know you keep running you're 19 now seen in the spirit [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Holy Spirit it's fixing to fall die now I saw mechanics you seen this bird this morning or do you love him what a not boring oh we feel a love of God in this man [Applause] loves you this morning now seeing a spirit I feel I was just a taste of what's fixing to take place that's only a sprinkle don't be satisfied now stay hungry you're gonna get it priest corny man believe it all all my heart Oh hallelujah a man a man Oh hallelujah oh now you didn't argue with the darkness he simply spoke a word to the darkness and he said to the darkness let there be light and there was much isn't that right hallelujah has no more argument there was no more fuss there was no more debate all of the chaos all of the ruin was dealt with hallelujah in the first four when he spoke let there be light isn't that right hallelujah now what is darkness darkness is defined as the absence of light so when there is no light then ultimately we get darkness it's now when there's no presence of light when there's no other positive influence the only other default position is darkness isn't that right holiday it means and it was such an encouragement to me as I studied this here it means that if darkness is the absence of light then that means darkness is not really an actual force darkness is not really an energy light has the energy the Prophet said from light comes life but out of darkness nothing can come it means that when we turn on a light darkness has to find its place it means that the devil this morning doesn't really have any power he has no power over the blood wash once because when there is light darkness butterfly on back death must know its master because the kings of the earth have come back to take back from the enemy what he took from us he took our children we're gonna take it back if he took your joy we're gonna take it right back and if there's darkness in your life if there's tapas in your home this morning oh yes Satan is powerless this morning the devil is confused this morning mr. Tekin - because when a light comes forth the tightness has the finest place the darkness has to be pushed back to make our theatres here the left you know that he is here to begin his reign he is here to take control of your situation maybe it's too hard maybe it's so powerful but there's no power like all God he is your eternal power is your eternal life that's why the Bible says resist the devil he is freed from you miss him seven ways praise God because a light of God scatters a cockroach's scatters art apples left and right hallelujah and the light produces a life Jesus Christ and a life is seven furnish all the mystery the coming of the Lord and if these things be in you and abound you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ and keep in a world that is print corruption through love [Music] my god Olivia oh I don't know my Holy Spirit is here you just ride he anointed a man he just dropped down already the temple is on the run the pebble is running priest caught what we reach boy stung by now I see them on the way out praise God you have the victory this morning you have to pick you right now hallelujah praise God a man mine so the power of that light is more powerful than the power of darkness it's not really a power where there's no light the default position is darkness so where there's no positive influence in the community the young boys well you know they get up to him and get up the trouble stealing robbing weed whatever that's the default that's a natural position that's a normal position when there's no positive influence because we were born and sin shaped in iniquity and come into the world speaking lies so therefore some higher power some higher influence has to influence us not from here but from above not on the ground level but solely from up there a vision we got to be caught up in to catch a higher love to be in a higher place to see what's coming to see what chord is trying to show us Oh glory to God Amen young people it makes you walk different when you see it from a different perspective that's all the time you've seen it from your eyes how you feel how you are going through and what what's going in your mind but when you raise up into the mind of God and to his purpose and to his program and to what he wants for your life then it changes the way you walk changes the way you talk changes the way you see things changes the way you approach this gospel this word praise God because you're operating by God's divine revelation hallelujah open up second round what speaking to you you man now watch now watch he said now let it be like okay so God is the original power God is the original light that came forth and darkness had to find its place so when God said let it be like God saw it was light a man is never now this light is not a natural light remember the Nick Genesis 1:12 2:24 this light is not a natural light oh we're talking about but it is a supernatural language remember he spoke it in the beginning well when we go down to Genesis 1 12 to 14 hey Randy can you find it man you put it up here man so you'll see it and God said Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years I let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so and God made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and he made the stars also hey man thank you so that's what we're talking about is the Sun that's the moon that's the Sun that's the light he gave four times that's the light he gave four season that's the light he give four years but in order for God to do his work in the beginning there was a light that came before all those lights that's a light we're talking about this morning I'm not talking about a natural light but I'm talking about that light he spoke in the beginning that is the original lunch not the SU and lunch but the Esso and lights that is a light you feel this morning in this tabernacle that's what drop-down this morning hallelujah the original light Florina car now watch that was the Sun the Moon the Stars but he said let there be light and then he said he left that light be separated from all other lights because after he saw a flash he said this light is good and after that the Bible said he separated the light from the darkness so anything outside of the air so and lunch is talking but a Panem said let every man's word be I like I let parts would be true if God spoke it it's got to happen because that is the original light he was how much he was the light of all man and a word became flesh and not flesh brother Mallis and we beheld his glory the same chlorine appropiate innovated let's say glory through Tomas and he said when you see me you see that light when you see me you see the father the father me I don't back there you shall know I am in my father the father would build me and I will peel you and you in me what pain this thing that was your original light now ride with me now we going somewhere how was your regional life it took the like to declare the day because when God saw the light he said that I like was good he was pleased with her lunch he rejoiced with her lunch he was uh he was happy about that lunch and it if I call that light a and he called the darkness night so anything that is outside of the talk outside of the light that's in the darkness that's in a nighttime hallelujah that's out McChord separated it like from darkness tape from night it's not hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory and afoot in the morning and evening was the first day all right you think in the morning rather a mine so here was hey man you lovin this morning you man the prophet said now he said the Sun is the king of all the lights on this earth in a natural light no matter how much artificial light that we can have and how many great electric rays we can produce he said but when that Sun rises all the rest of them dim out that's the same thing with the Word of God he said when the Word of God raises all of the superstitions all of the denominational fanaticism zand things spread away and it shows just exactly what it is God in the beginning said let there be light and the light only comes the true light the king light only comes by the Word of God the outer speakers then a manifestation can take place afterwards in the light of God only comes by the Word of God isn't that right hallelujah is not right God separated the light from the darkness in the beginning and the Word of God was made manifest I always separates the light from the darkness I'll see that again the Word of God made manifests always separates the light from the darkness the Word of God when me manifests always separates the light from the darkness when the Word of God produces a life when the Word of God produces another fishin's when the Word of God produces another original church another original branch and it separates everything else call it self praise God then it comes back to the original and I don't care what fanaticism what they preach what they say God will always point you back to the word back to the original your retina like the original life your original holy fire that said on the day of Pentecost that's what we're going back to that is the tale that we are living in right now it's gotta come back to the original life oh I'm getting a little ahead of myself hey man alrighty anointing this morning man you feel his presence get a lot of shot of free he said no separate electron doctors right so the Word of God made manifest I want to drive this down would've court made manifest always separates the light from the darkness so we've got to have a burden this morning to become a manifestation because God is longing to reproduce themselves in sons and daughters of God so God is not happy God is not satisfied until we become a manifestation of this then when we manifest this when we manifest in John 14:12 when we manifest st. Pete 2nd Peter 1:4 to 7 then God is pleased to dwell in you my God my god people can rise up with this or that or the other isms can rise communism fascism all other isms can rise up superstitions cults whatever it may be interpretations Dogma screech all kind of men's ideas men thoughts Messel of the people messing up the churches messing up good people but false doctrines false teachings false Christ's will rise up lean away silly women will laden with diverse loss they have not recognized they're telling their message oh and a prophet cried out against them you have not recognized your day you have not recognized your message because if you had you'll be looking for the Holy Ghost you'll be hung learn to see those seven virtues living in your soul you will not be satisfied to just cut the church and occupy a church bench and feel like you're going to heaven just because you got long here and I got a long skirt you need to get the Holy Ghost in your soul that's the only way

of reproof to you a word a mine of exhortation a many men wonderful hallelujah so now I see but you see now we we we know it's here but it until it's vindicated prove that it's light then we have no right to argue against that because it shuts all or the light out jesus said that every man's would be alive let mine be truth his word is superior over all man's words with all anything his word is light it's not a man a man hallelujah I'll skip this down now okay okay well he says I know in the beginning it must've been fog he must have been dismal dark as the world was turning before he spoke it is now right I went God knew that he need he had need of light now his see was already inert because yet he had planted it there but he needed light now to bring forth that seed to make up see live because the seed was already there when God made us there was seed already there and when you came forth from out of your mother's womb there was a seed already there when you were going to school there was a seed already there and he got your first job it was a seed already there when the teller tried to kill you in that accident and that fire not whatever it was there was a seat already there the pebble is trying to snuff your life out but there was a seed already there God spoke that seed in the beginning and that seeds got to come for God dispatch an angel to walk with you to make sure that you make it to that angel the angel of the Lord because you have an appointment this morning with the supernatural and the unseen calm Oh hallelujah praise God the same car that Moses saw the burning bush the same God of Joshua saw as a captain of the horse same God is here to separate the light from the darkness in your soul [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we're not satisfied this morning until we got that light burning in our hearts putting in our souls putting in our system Oh Holly apostles yeah I'm trying to their feets who are anointed we thought she was anointed people later sick on pets and cultures pad pincher beach our past my and they would be healing as though he didn't him pray he didn't touch them but when the light reflected off of a son of God it's very shadow was anointed you know what I'm saying that kind of son is coming back that kind of Trotter is coming back upon the urge when a royal priesthood we are holy nation a peculiar people and when I like it's ready to manifest itself then we'll the Philistines will back it up Ben the shots will go off cigars will be missing faces will be washed the gospel of reason is power and then the Philistines will go to back it up the darkness will go to back it up because that feel it will take the rock or the revelation of what the Seventh Seal is and smash it in Goliath's forehead and set God's people free glory to God a man and a man My dear lover this morning or get on fire I don't know how many church services we'll have after this well hallelujah the end is coming and and the end is coming churches

morning with forgiveness with love with humility or doing all we can [Applause] a hundred-twenty made away for 3,000 standing a captive spot don't stop praying for your son's quarters for disable the push what we in the spirit now we all beat down wonderful now he says just like in each age quarters for told us what would take place any change the only thing he needs is a manifestation of the light upon that scripture it's not the manifestation of the light needs to come upon second Peter 1:4 - seven - come upon revelation 22:17 the manifestation of the light it's not right to make it live for that age and it would do it as long as a Lycan kept to the word as long as the light can get to that seed in your soul then it then sonic punch something reacts because it's a law that's put into motion in now I remember in the days of Wesley they were so sanctified that the Holy Ghost would want to fall upon the people and they will want to baptize them but it wasn't the days yet for that to happen so they would throw buckets on the people I think it was alright to get them out of their spirit before that take place because if it did it would change the season but what that showed us is that there's a law that's put into motion and every time you meet God's requirements every time you meet God's conditions you in the right conditions then certain things will take place and if you are sanctified if you are holy then the holy spirit it's very attractive it's very excited about a person like that it wants to fall upon him Oh hallelujah because it's a law that's put into motion if my people shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear from heaven I will he can forgive their sin I will heal Ellen that's called fern and he will manifest it when God's people begin to pray for the Lord to have his way then the Spirit of the Lord is coming down when you begin to get into obedience to the whole Word of God that everything that God told you to do now hallelujah your ABCs always believed Christ sanctified holy separating yourself from all unbelief when you begin to do that the Holy Ghost the same Holy Spirit fell on the day of Pentecost is obligated to meet you on the basis of his promised word [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] follow minions to the whole world of Kong and titled you to the token hey man hey man do you live in this small for my time is just going but the Holy Spirit is here that's alright and that's okay because if somebody's delivered and the work of God is finished doesn't matter what I have written here but the work of God must be accomplished this morning somebody's going to go free somebody's going to be inspired somebody this week it's gonna call our fire glory the corner yeah somebody this week it's gonna break pass the natural but according to those who leads of holies they're gonna go into their prayer closet oh yeah you the devil's gonna see something then brother that Devils got another thing coming when you begin to get into your place when you begin to get into right atmosphere in a right condition God will speak from heaven and this world will help direct from God and there is another people in the land you another Messenger will be the final voice to the final age and a final junction of time right now an inland time there shall be like Oh hurry along you know he said you might plant wheat you might plant wheat at one time or grain at another time some comes slower than others because it depends on the season but God's word comes in a season it's not the law and grace and so forth as we went on to the ages and each time it is lit up by the manifestation of the light spreading forth the life that is in the sea the life comes from the light is now right and we realize that God's light of the day is his son the one was as you but this one was s o n s o n is the biome is now right he was in the beginning was a word and the word was with god and the word was God Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever it's the Word of God always it was Christ that wasn't Noah it was Christ that wasn't Moses it was Christ in David that looked up as a rejected king upon the city when 800 years later Christ set their weeping over a city being himself a rejected king just like David was isn't that right it was always the spirit of Christ and the full manifestation of God's Word made known through Jesus Christ is the Spirit of God and that's what they were doing that's the reason they did that because they were living now what she's talking about something else now I'm talking about a man people got caught up interpretation he said they are living in the glare of another light a man or they're living in little clay of a past light it's not right they're living in a glare of the light of another day and that's what I believe he said is a matter with the world today friends it's because we're trying to live in the glare of a light that shine in another day a glare is a false light just like a mirage on a road he said we go down the road and we see a mirage it's a false conception of the Sun and when you get there it hasn't produced a thing but something false because you cannot walk in the glare of the Sun because it's a mirage always showing you something that there's nothing to and when people try to tell you that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever they're leading you to a mirage any time someone preaches something that is outside of this gospel outside of this Bible outside of the correct interpretation they are leading you into a mirage that's all and when you get into church and then you join maybe a church or some cold creed or something like that there's nothing there no more than what you had in the world from separation or unbelief the bible says oh we believe that God is a great God yes and we read back there where he was with the people about 2,000 years ago the Prophet said that's intellectual that's something that God did that's like a man he said freezing to death and a paint him and we paint him a big fire on the wall and say look what a beautiful fire that was see this picture here well he had a fire to come look how everybody was getting warm but everybody was getting warm then but what about you you can't get warm by a painted fire you've got to have the fire itself oh so we are not here this morning to preach painted files we are here this morning but we are here is to anoint the promise of glory present tense now faith is for your deliverance right now for your healing right now for your salvation right now but people need court today not a court of yesterday not a quarter tomorrow we need call right now right now in this place not a painted fire but the fire of court itself the fire poor to burn in your heart burn in your soul burn all the lusts burn out the lies burn out demon powers burn up as over the world hallelujah praise God it has to be real whoa hallelujah hallelujah it has to be real it has to be genuine it has to be God in your heart in your soul Oh Holy Spirit told me speak someone here now hey man let me read this here said now there you are don't fall short of that brother said without the baptism of the Holy Spirit your loss that's the only you won't have to worry about getting into heaven if there's nothing in there supernatural the Prophet said the doors cannot unlock over there you could walk there and bump your head against it but if the Spirit of God is in there the Spirit of God inside here will unhinge the doors got to have that thing in here to unlock it over there yonder through it that's what I come for not to be a church member but I have that thing in here to unlock the doors over there open up the gates glory to God the Son of God is coming home Oh [Applause] Holy Spirit it comes down into your soul it makes you a candidate for a supernatural and fully unseen where you become a citizen of God I always think about that experience that I had coming off the plane coming back from Germany and here we was coming up big plane and everybody's coming down crowds of people and only a

you would fall and you knew you would always feel good he knew you would always feel righteous so God paid the price now it's not about what you feel but it's what about what he did for you on Calvary's tree oh that's why we praise him that's why we shout that's why we lift our hands that's why we ought to worship God every single tale that's why I have no reservation when I come to church

Omega pride team meets back to the world back to the Bible back to the original back to the foundation that was laid on the day of Pentecost or in the day of Pentecost was fully come it was in one mind there wasn't one Accord why because a Word of God was open to them they were with Jesus thirty forty days and he unlocked their thinking he unlocked their minds I saw who they were who God was who that pepper was and then you by revelation what they had to receive and they were there praying continually in the spirit and in those days stood up among them and said this Jesus of whom we were witnesses who was slain on a cross and hung on a tree to die it's now exalted at a right hand of God and he told us a Terry in Jerusalem and pray without ceasing I'd stay on the expectation I've beat on them by inspiration beginning to put the church in order and they cast lots and Matthias was cultivate them as much but the Bible said and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were in one mind they won't want to cause and all of a sudden all of a sudden they heard a sound come from heaven son of a Russian might you in that sound swept into the house and we get a baptized individuals

God Himself the word alone with it will remain standing everything else will pass away I already swore by himself time should be no more the angel truck down from heaven clothed with a cloud rainbow upon his head what was that rainbow refraction of the pure light of God the glory of the Lord that surrounds us he is that pure white light and when science says when our white light is refracted through a glass prism there's a rainbow that sprays out and it's a natural type of the glory of the law that when the pure white light of the world is in you then we reflect seven rainbow glories seven rainbow colors the presence of light is what brings forth the colors not the darkness but we like the original light of God seven rainbow colors seven attributes of God hate putting knowledge temperance patience calling as brotherly kindness charity amen if these things be in you and abound then you have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust oh that's why we give all diligence remember the lectures that add to our faith virtue and to offer to knowledge and to a knowledge temperance but he that lacketh these things is blind and has not recognized that day in their message hallelujah here and look at these things that still coming to church it's Ted playing church but without the Holy Ghost prophet said you're lost what you're gonna receive it because your sons because you're taught us because your children of the light you must receive that light we didn't hear it patch hands jesus said my sheep hear my voice a stranger's voice they will not follow Oh hallelujah but you cannot be lost because a seed of God remains in you and you shall receive the holy spirit not many days hence hallelujah hallelujah whoa do you understand it do you know you are

begin to up here and we have seen his appearing he has appeared in a prophet that probably lived just like Jesus until the people took him for Jesus and he said no it's not me don't worship Me but worship Him look to Jesus the author and finisher of your faith he's the one that doesn't miracles I must decrease and he must increase hallelujah hallelujah I'm pulling away but there's a bride coming on eh she'll be without spots she'll be a not wrinkled washing of blood on a lamb when the prophet saw that bride in division she was marching in step she was marching in holiness she was

Christ Jesus don't walk in some glare of another age that glare been made alright for them it's been alright for them it's not right the Jews taught that they were worshipping the true light they thought that they were worshiping the same God that they were turning down the very one that they thought they were worshipping they will crucify they were making fun of the very God and making him a laughingstock of the people the very god that they thought they were worship in may I say this with reverence and respect the Prophet says but to bring light because as our brothers said a while ago we're living later than you think we are and he said one of these days something is going to happen it's going to be too late and he said the people would take on the mark of the beast not knowing what they are doing blindly the blind and they all fall in the ditch jesus said and we're living later than we think many honest people follow that not even knowing what they're doing but he our is at hand now the prophets here oh he was always striking when a light is shining the gospel lights and in its power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ manifesting himself that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday the same today and the same forever he losted that for this day a man is known he lot it up for his knee the thing that he promised for this day must happen in this day if the church won't accept it then God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham so if you don't want it called find a drunken porter find a prostitute but he said my table shall be full hallelujah but we are here this morning to recognize a call and to respond to the voice but when Jesus calls us this morning he's calling to your heart this morning and we hear the voice of the Lord we heard him when we was in this church and when he was in that church when he was over there over here when we were tossed about with every wind of doctrine but a voice came to us my sheep know my voice a stranger's voice they will not follow we have not followed Connelly defiled tables but this is the points of call on to the children of this last team wake up this morning recognize the voice recognize your tail recognize your message and what we are calling to a memory equality of affection we are called to adoption the adoption of sons or the adoption of sons onto Jesus Christ unto himself that's according

that image from glory to glory from glory to glory I lie beholding the glory of the Lord that's what we come for this morning to behold his glory to look upon him to see him manifested in us when we see our nakedness when we see our sinfulness we want to be washed by the blood of the Lamb we want to be sealed by the Holy Ghost and fire and commit to his image and comment that his likeness and be transformed by the renewing of our mind that we might prove what is that good and acceptable or somebody say man you didn't just come to church to warm a church pew or as a Roma church bench but to be changed from glory to glory to be sealing your soul with the Holy Ghost and pile that the same nature that was in Christ living you that your family could see it that your wife could see it that your husband could see it that your children can see it it's got to be a real change no more playing Church no more playing Christian but you smile genuine you love genuine you forgive genuinely not speak lovely the truth but speak the truth and love that's what we got to come back to the original gospel the original Bible the original church [Applause] oh yeah do you believe it it's a man [Applause]

back justification is now hallelujah that wasn't like for his day and every choice with that light and they love that light and a priest caught in a like they had a revival in my life but when it raised a little further when she came with a higher realm it's not holiday you must not all would also be justified because in those days they drank beer well isn't that right it was all right

came he introduced the fullness of the world so brother what they are we living in if we are living in the day when the Son of Man is being revealed and a fullest of the world is here then that means

tree ever puts forth another original branch it will bear its original fruit the same food ours on Pentecost healings ceilings deliverances baptism of the Holy Ghost it will pay the original fruit and there's got to be a restoration of all these things right Hadi and loved the vine the Prophet said he has prophecy prophecy he said there is to comfort or restoration an evening like to light it up and make it right but it will come out of the vine not a denomination that's crafted it is but the original production of the word it is to comfort for the evening time there will be a light in the evening time it takes light to ripen it see your proofing the scripture is a day that won't be called day or night fruit kind of ripen here it is until the Sun ripened it no matter how much you preach whatever you do it cannot be ripened it cannot be manifested it cannot be vindicated only by him who said I am the light of the world the word is that right so there is it comfort as a power the Prophet said therefore it has to come forth as a power the Holy Spirit Himself not the work of man not man or Tufton one another nonsense but the Holy Spirit Himself must ripen 250k CH and proof and manifest that what he said what happened the Holy Ghost is gonna comfort in your heart in your life in your soul in this church as a power and anoint your soul the same original lunch this morning let
