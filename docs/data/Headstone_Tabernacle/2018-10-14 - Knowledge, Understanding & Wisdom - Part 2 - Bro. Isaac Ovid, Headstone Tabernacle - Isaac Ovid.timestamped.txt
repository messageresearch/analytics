[1:09:18] because nothing worth having it comes
[1:09:21] easy but if it's worth having you have
[1:09:23] to have the tenacity to drive the energy
[1:09:26] the enthusiasm the passion the zeal for
[1:09:29] whatever it is in life you have to have
[1:09:31] something that drives you to fight and
[1:09:33] that word fight is powerful because it
[1:09:36] means that you're gonna encounter
[1:09:37] resistance and it's not fight by foot or
[1:09:41] fight by yards is fight by inch so it's
[1:09:44] going to be slow moving but it's
[1:09:45] positive move in it's Oh somebody help
[1:09:48] me this morning every inch of ground and
[1:09:51] the thing of it is as you claim these
[1:09:53] inches you're not gonna give it back to
[1:09:55] the devil oh we're gonna gain and keep
[1:09:58] it we're gonna acquire and build a choir
[1:10:01] and build a choir and build all the way
[1:10:04] to the resurrection all the way to the
[1:10:06] wedding supper all the way to the
[1:10:08] rapture can the church see
[1:10:11] man hallelujah you may be seated and
[1:10:15] certainly I want to salute by the
[1:10:17] Anthony for the service last Wednesday
[1:10:19] night what a blessing you know and I
[1:10:23] really want to salute all the believers
[1:10:25] who have had to readjust their schedules
[1:10:28] and there are times to make it to the
[1:10:30] special midweek services you know the
[1:10:33] Bible says even as the day approaches we
[1:10:35] will gather more frequently so we are in
[1:10:38] the word we are in the word and it
[1:10:42] reminds us because to break out of your
[1:10:44] routine or your schedule requires
[1:10:46] decisions everything in life is about
[1:10:50] the decision it's a decision every
[1:10:53] single thing in life is about the
[1:10:55] decision everything God has done has
[1:10:57] been based on a decision that he made he
[1:11:01] thought about it he thought about you he
[1:11:04] thought about him he thought about the
[1:11:06] Sun and where he should put it in place
[1:11:07] and he decided where he's gonna put it
[1:11:10] he thought about what mountain to make
[1:11:13] the tallest mountain and he put Mount
[1:11:14] Everest in his place because that's
[1:11:16] where he wanted to see the tallest
[1:11:18] mountain in its place there's no
[1:11:20] accident with God there's nothing
[1:11:22] haphazard recorded and you decided this
[1:11:25] morning to be here in the house of God
[1:11:27] there's no accident with that decision
[1:11:29] there is no mistake there is there is no
[1:11:32] luck and there's no chance there's this
[1:11:34] is God allowing us as with freewill to
[1:11:37] make a choice and because you have
[1:11:38] chosen his foreknowledge knew what you
[1:11:41] would choose and because of that choice
[1:11:43] he has a whole storeroom of blessings
[1:11:45] for you this morning can the church say
[1:11:47] Amen so this week we'll just have
[1:11:51] services Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. make
[1:11:54] every effort to be here this Wednesday
[1:11:56] there will be no services coming Friday
[1:11:58] so just be reminded only on Wednesday
[1:12:01] and there'll be no services coming
[1:12:03] Friday and of course service continues
[1:12:05] this coming Sunday and last week I
[1:12:09] believe we had a wonderful time in the
[1:12:11] Lord speaking about knowledge
[1:12:13] understanding and wisdom how many were
[1:12:15] blessed
[1:12:16] man it's very difficult to speak about a
[1:12:20] service you preach a week before this is
[1:12:22] first time never never done that
[1:12:24] referencing but I raised it because we
[1:12:27] want to continue along that road this
[1:12:28] morning a lower place in my heart to
[1:12:32] continue part two of that message this
[1:12:35] morning and bit of it this morning ask
[1:12:37] me is there part three I see maybe there
[1:12:39] are 10 paths I'm not sure you know but
[1:12:42] when you talk about the knowledge
[1:12:42] understanding and wisdom of God it keeps
[1:12:45] unfolding and there's more and more to
[1:12:48] it and I do have so I could give you my
[1:12:50] title even before we read the scripture
[1:12:52] knowledge understanding and wisdom part
[1:12:54] two with a subject being the mind of
[1:12:57] Christ and an inspiration the
[1:12:59] intelligence so we're looking for God to
[1:13:02] do something this morning special and
[1:13:04] speak to us in a special way so if you
[1:13:06] have your Bibles thank you musicians you
[1:13:08] could turn with me to our we're gonna
[1:13:11] read from four portions of Scripture
[1:13:15] once again I want to reference the same
[1:13:17] scriptures we read last week so we can
[1:13:20] build upon it once again Isaiah 55
[1:13:26] reading from this 8 as the f55 and verse
[1:13:31] 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:13:34] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[1:13:37] lord for as the heavens are higher than
[1:13:39] the earth so are my ways higher than
[1:13:41] your ways and my thoughts than your
[1:13:44] thoughts and reading Romans 12 reading
[1:13:48] verse 2 we also going to touch in
[1:13:50] Philippians and we're gonna read and
[1:13:52] proverbs 4 reading Romans 12 and verse 2
[1:14:00] and be not conformed to this world in
[1:14:03] other words do not take the shape of
[1:14:04] this world do not twist your behavior to
[1:14:08] meet the standards of the world don't
[1:14:10] desire to be like the world but be
[1:14:12] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:14:15] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:14:18] acts
[1:14:19] acceptable and perfect will of God and
[1:14:23] reading Philippians 2 and reading verse
[1:14:25] 5 Philippians 2 I read in verse 5 let
[1:14:31] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:14:34] Christ Jesus and our last reading
[1:14:37] proverbs 4 reading from 1 to 13 proverbs
[1:14:46] 4:18 here ensuring the instruction of a
[1:14:50] father and attend to no understanding
[1:14:53] for I give you good doctrine for sake he
[1:14:56] not my law for I was my father's son
[1:15:00] tender and only beloved in the sight of
[1:15:02] my mother he taught me also and said
[1:15:05] unto me let thine heart retain my words
[1:15:08] keep my Commandments and live get wisdom
[1:15:11] get understanding forget it not neither
[1:15:15] decline from the words of my mouth
[1:15:17] forsake her not and she shall preserve
[1:15:20] thee love her and she shall keep thee
[1:15:23] wisdom is the principal thing therefore
[1:15:26] get wisdom and we're all like getting
[1:15:29] get understanding

[1:15:34] shall bring thee to honor when thou dost
[1:15:36] and Bree saw she shall give today I had
[1:15:39] an ornament of grace a crown of glory
[1:15:41] shall be she delivered to thee here all
[1:15:44] my son and receive my sayings and the
[1:15:46] years of thy life shall be many I have
[1:15:49] thought be in the way of wisdom I have
[1:15:51] led V in right paths when thou goest I
[1:15:54] step shall not be straightened and when
[1:15:56] darkness
[1:15:57] thou shall not stumble take fast hole of
[1:16:00] instruction let her not go keep her for
[1:16:03] she is thy life I mean the Lord had a
[1:16:05] blessing to the reading of his word
[1:16:07] let us bow has one more thought once
[1:16:09] more Heavenly Father Lord any man could
[1:16:11] read the scriptures but it truly takes
[1:16:14] the Spirit of God to breathe life upon
[1:16:17] it father this morning as we endeavor in
[1:16:19] your word may you give us the knowledge
[1:16:21] understanding and the wisdom to rightly
[1:16:24] divide the word so that we could leave
[1:16:26] this house change and transform drawn
[1:16:29] closer to you we are not here for our
[1:16:31] ideas
[1:16:32] we're not here for our thinking's but
[1:16:34] Lord we are conscious that there's a
[1:16:36] higher thinking we are conscious that
[1:16:38] there's a higher power we are conscious
[1:16:40] that we are called to something greater
[1:16:42] may you walk out the pages of the Bible
[1:16:44] today and may you stir in our hearts a
[1:16:47] newness of life and a revival in the
[1:16:49] depths of our soul Lord recognizing that
[1:16:52] the hour is late recognizing that the
[1:16:55] Prophet messenger of Malachi 4 didn't
[1:16:58] come just for us to have church or
[1:16:59] gather together but to show us how to go
[1:17:02] for us to prepare to leave this place so
[1:17:05] may you connect the dots as it were in
[1:17:07] our hearts may you answer the deep
[1:17:09] questions in our souls and the areas of
[1:17:12] confusion and doubt and fear misgivings
[1:17:15] whatever it may be may you minister to
[1:17:17] us the only way that you can father me
[1:17:20] you touch the fathers and the mothers
[1:17:22] the children the officers the helps the
[1:17:24] governments those that are connected may
[1:17:27] you minister to one and all may you take
[1:17:29] me out of the wave and speak directly to
[1:17:31] your children in the precious name of
[1:17:33] Jesus Christ and the church says Amen
[1:17:36] any man you may be seated
[1:17:40] hallelujah can we give the Lord a hand a
[1:17:42] praise so we are speaking on knowledge
[1:17:52] understanding and wisdom and we started
[1:17:56] this topic this theme with the young
[1:17:59] people in the last few service and last
[1:18:01] Sunday and we hear again today because
[1:18:05] when you understand it and you get into
[1:18:08] the quotes but the man I made it very
[1:18:10] clear that a word is a thought expressed
[1:18:14] so before you could say anything it had
[1:18:18] to originate somewhere so he said a word
[1:18:22] when expressed is a thought that changes
[1:18:25] form it had to be a thought before it
[1:18:28] could be expressed whenever you think of
[1:18:31] something to speak or even do any type
[1:18:35] of action you rely on your mind because
[1:18:38] the mind is where the thinking takes
[1:18:41] place and in order to make a decision
[1:18:43] whether it is to speak or to act
[1:18:45] that thinking relies on what you know
[1:18:47] that thinking relies on what you
[1:18:51] understand and that thinking also
[1:18:53] applies to the wisdom that you would
[1:18:55] have acquired so it is said that age
[1:18:57] brings wisdom because the assumption is
[1:19:01] that as you get older you would have
[1:19:02] tried enough with the knowledge you have
[1:19:04] had to learn something more than you did
[1:19:07] before and over the period of time you
[1:19:09] would have learned what not to do and
[1:19:10] what to do and and as a result of this
[1:19:12] age brings wisdom but we realize when we
[1:19:18] watch certain people who are all that
[1:19:20] necessarily that doesn't always connect
[1:19:23] that is not so much at age brings wisdom
[1:19:26] but wisdom is something that has to be
[1:19:29] acquired and provides you read said get
[1:19:32] wisdom get understanding and it speaks
[1:19:36] of knowledge number the Anthony
[1:19:38] beautifully brought back to fear of the
[1:19:40] Lord as the beginning of knowledge the
[1:19:43] fear of the Lord as the beginning of
[1:19:44] wisdom in other words if in our schools
[1:19:47] we teach as the very first lesson the
[1:19:49] fear of the Lord we would have a
[1:19:51] different type of student that comes out
[1:19:52] of school everybody with me this morning
[1:19:55] if in the church we teach the fear of
[1:19:58] the Lord as a first principle of
[1:19:59] teaching we would have a different type
[1:20:01] of behavior because the fear of the Lord
[1:20:04] is the beginning of understanding and
[1:20:05] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:20:07] wisdom can the church same and I'm I'm
[1:20:10] just recapping a few things before we
[1:20:12] get into a few things this morning so in
[1:20:14] topic we are talking about the mind of
[1:20:17] Christ because we are promised that that
[1:20:19] mind is supposed to be in the bride and
[1:20:21] that mind is supposed to be in us so for
[1:20:24] us to get the mind of Christ it has to
[1:20:26] be a desire for our thinking to change
[1:20:29] there has to not only be a desire there
[1:20:32] must be a realization that our thinking
[1:20:35] is flawed the very best of our thinking
[1:20:39] is Florida let me say that again the
[1:20:41] very best of man's knowledge is limited
[1:20:43] the very best of man's understanding is
[1:20:46] limited the very best of man's wisdom
[1:20:49] will all
[1:20:50] we limited it what is limitless it's
[1:20:53] cause knowledge what is limitless is
[1:20:56] course understanding what is limitless
[1:20:58] is God's wisdom so Paul and speaker Z I
[1:21:03] come not to you it with enticing words
[1:21:05] and the wisdom of a man but I'm
[1:21:07] connected to something or anybody with
[1:21:10] me know anybody with me in the house is
[1:21:12] smaller no one not the Bible you see he
[1:21:17] refused to show it to the wise and
[1:21:19] prefer this show it the beam such as we
[1:21:21] learn he's not talking about the wise
[1:21:23] based on the wisdom of God is only wise
[1:21:26] in their own eyes wise in their wisdom
[1:21:29] you could spend and I have met people
[1:21:30] who have read the Bible back to front
[1:21:33] they could quote every verse they could
[1:21:35] cut every scripture they could justify
[1:21:37] how they act but it's not spiritual
[1:21:39] knowledge he could understand and that's
[1:21:42] why pork is it do I understand all
[1:21:44] mysteries there is something greater
[1:21:48] than man's understanding there is
[1:21:50] something greater than man's knowledge
[1:21:52] there's something greater than man's
[1:21:54] wisdom and that is what comes from God
[1:21:56] can the church seaman so if you approach
[1:22:02] marriage with the knowledge of men with
[1:22:05] the understanding of men with the wisdom
[1:22:08] of men then you cannot tap into the
[1:22:10] spiritual or the God side of marriage
[1:22:13] because God has his own thinking you
[1:22:18] ever see the Furman I want you to get
[1:22:19] this Court has his own thoughts on what
[1:22:22] makes a good marriage
[1:22:23] you can have your thoughts but he has
[1:22:25] his thoughts you may have your thoughts
[1:22:27] on what makes a good career for you but
[1:22:30] he has his thoughts about what's the
[1:22:32] best career for you or somebody help me
[1:22:34] this morning you could have your
[1:22:36] thoughts of how to do things in your
[1:22:38] life but he has his thoughts and all of
[1:22:41] the problems we encounter in life is
[1:22:43] when we try our way and we refuse to
[1:22:46] listen to his way and that's why we are
[1:22:48] here this morning to get connected to
[1:22:51] his way to get connected to his thoughts
[1:22:53] to get connected to his approach
[1:22:57] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:22:59] God has designed it that your thoughts
[1:23:03] your knowledge your understanding your
[1:23:06] wisdom will always lead to failure
[1:23:08] [Applause]
[1:23:10] because once you rely on your thinking
[1:23:13] about that lean not on your own
[1:23:14] understanding but when you rely on his
[1:23:17] understanding you are guaranteed to have
[1:23:19] his success you're guaranteed to have
[1:23:21] his blessing all God has desired is to
[1:23:25] be able to communicate to somebody in
[1:23:27] the same language somebody helped me
[1:23:31] this morning you may be seated
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:34] [Music]
[1:23:37] you made me see this for a minute I'm
[1:23:40] not gonna talk to you before I preach
[1:23:41] don't worry I have a hundred and three
[1:23:43] pages so we have food so I can't say
[1:23:50] that is the appetizer this morning for
[1:23:52] you to speak a language for you to
[1:23:55] communicate
[1:23:56] you must have an image for you to say
[1:23:59] the word cup there must be a cup visual
[1:24:04] in your mind sometime it doesn't happen
[1:24:09] consciously it happens too fast so your
[1:24:11] head you would say King before you talk
[1:24:13] to me because the people want to talk so
[1:24:17] fast he breathes until it catch up with
[1:24:18] the words they're trying to say it isn't
[1:24:21] but fee to speak a language with someone
[1:24:24] we just speak Spanish you have to know
[1:24:26] what you are relating to come everybody
[1:24:30] with me and when man hell God lost the
[1:24:33] ability to communicate the way he wanted
[1:24:36] to with man because man and God was no
[1:24:39] longer thinking the same way Adam was
[1:24:43] made in the image and likeness of God
[1:24:45] it's two different things
[1:24:47] image and likeness image speaks a form
[1:24:53] like this speaks of attributes I'll say
[1:24:57] one more time image of God but likeness
[1:25:00] is thinking behavior conduct so when
[1:25:03] Adam walked he was in the image of his
[1:25:05] father but he was also
[1:25:07] his father his thinking was in alignment
[1:25:10] with clutch thinking on the motto that's
[1:25:14] why I got to trust him whatever you name
[1:25:16] I'll back it up because you are thinking
[1:25:19] like me so quad has long since Adam sell
[1:25:26] to find men we would think like him
[1:25:28] because that's how he knows is it's his
[1:25:31] son
[1:25:32] because his thinking produces his words
[1:25:35] oh come on no one not the apostle to
[1:25:39] take notes part of what they said
[1:25:41] because their thoughts were his thoughts
[1:25:43] so if their words became his words no
[1:25:46] wonder we learned the prophets are the
[1:25:48] mouthpiece of God so for a prophet to be
[1:25:51] a genuine prophet he has to put his
[1:25:54] thoughts on the subject
[1:25:55] so you don't need to be his father's
[1:25:57] thoughts that is what makes him a
[1:25:59] prophet because if he interject his own
[1:26:02] words it's no longer God's thinking it
[1:26:05] becomes his thinking can the church say
[1:26:07] man ride with me this morning we haven't
[1:26:20] church this morning we in the word this
[1:26:23] morning because at the end of the tea
[1:26:25] cold wants to restore back man to image
[1:26:28] and likeness behavior an attribute of my
[1:26:32] flesh bone of my bone spirit of my
[1:26:36] spirit when they see you they see the
[1:26:38] husband when you see me you see the
[1:26:40] father it's hard to even differentiate
[1:26:42] the two because when you speak heaven
[1:26:44] responds when he speaks heaven responds
[1:26:47] if you shall say to this mountain be
[1:26:49] moved the mountain doesn't actually you
[1:26:53] the bumpty recognizes the authority
[1:26:55] that's in the son of the Living God in
[1:26:57] this bride of Jesus Christ somebody say
[1:26:59] man
[1:27:07] I'll get to the mess if I want to speak
[1:27:08] about thinking a little bit and this
[1:27:14] teaching has gone beyond the realm of
[1:27:17] Scripture it's in every area philosophy
[1:27:20] the study of philosophy the study of
[1:27:22] knowledge
[1:27:23] so from yearly Plato Socrates Aristotle
[1:27:28] for eg to tried to understand this thing
[1:27:30] called the mind
[1:27:31] I believe it's Albert Einstein said the
[1:27:34] mind is a terrible thing to waste power
[1:27:40] locked up in your thinking as a man
[1:27:43] thinketh in his heart so he is so what
[1:27:46] you think about that's what you become
[1:27:48] so if you think I'm a failure
[1:27:50] it becomes what psychologists referred
[1:27:53] to as a self-fulfilling prophecy because
[1:27:56] your thoughts become what you live out
[1:28:03] so your thinking is very important like
[1:28:09] I heard somebody say one time in the
[1:28:10] business will he said don't say that
[1:28:12] you're poor or don't think you're poor
[1:28:16] think you're broken he said it's a
[1:28:17] difference you see a poverty that's
[1:28:20] theater man he said that's why someone
[1:28:21] who is poor could win the lottery and in
[1:28:24] two years they have no money because
[1:28:26] they have always been poor boys that we
[1:28:28] have thinking but if you have no money
[1:28:30] you're broken that's temporary because
[1:28:33] if you are broken you can be restored if
[1:28:34] you're broken you can get black it's all
[1:28:39] about your thinking so when Caleb and
[1:28:43] the other ministers went into the
[1:28:46] Promised Land they didn't have a
[1:28:48] conversation with the chance but their
[1:28:51] thinking was different ten men saw the
[1:28:54] situation did the analysis did their
[1:28:57] research and submitted the report
[1:29:01] that said we cannot do it did you speak
[1:29:03] to them no did you have a conversation
[1:29:07] with them no so how did you come to this
[1:29:10] conclusion when I thought about it and
[1:29:12] when I thought about it my thinking told
[1:29:16] me based on my knowledge based on my
[1:29:19] understanding based on my wisdom that we
[1:29:22] are not a match for these gyres
[1:29:25] but Joshua and killeth went to the same
[1:29:29] place saw the same thing at the same
[1:29:32] grapes drank the same honey but their
[1:29:36] thinking was different they remembered
[1:29:40] how God took them out of Egypt they
[1:29:42] remember how to read she opened up they
[1:29:45] remembered how it was swallowed up he
[1:29:48] remembered how God made a way for them
[1:29:51] when there seemed to be no way he did
[1:29:53] not look at what the eyes saw their
[1:29:56] weddings are deep acknowledged a deeper
[1:29:59] understanding and a deeper wisdom and
[1:30:01] they also submitted a report you may
[1:30:05] receive it for a minute
[1:30:06] the report was different they are
[1:30:09] reports that we are so excited we are so
[1:30:11] happy we are so pleased to report that
[1:30:14] we have entered the land we have tasted
[1:30:17] the grapes they are planted and
[1:30:19] described they are juicier than
[1:30:21] advertised come on somebody help me this
[1:30:23] morning the honey was the sweetest honey
[1:30:26] we are ever tasted
[1:30:29] you may be seated the report continued
[1:30:33] there are some challenges to get into
[1:30:36] this land but these challenges we can
[1:30:39] handle it because when we look at the
[1:30:41] challenges we are more than able we are
[1:30:47] more than able we are more enabled and
[1:30:50] if you didn't read the last paragraph we
[1:30:52] are more enabled
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:30:56] you may be seated
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:30:59] [Applause]
[1:31:01] [Music]
[1:31:03] you may be seated so it was not that the
[1:31:08] Giants had come on out palsy ten men and
[1:31:10] jacked him up in equal and not them and
[1:31:12] they had a never let's come back abuse
[1:31:14] but we got beat up it was their thinking
[1:31:22] their kids in there all conclusion I
[1:31:25] want you to get that the power of your
[1:31:28] decision that's why with a vertical
[1:31:32] because thou hast chosen you made a
[1:31:34] decision based on your thinking now the
[1:31:37] more the word you get and the more the
[1:31:40] spirit you color contact with it is
[1:31:42] impossible for your thinking to remain
[1:31:44] the same
[1:31:48] [Applause]
[1:31:49] he made me see them it is impossible and
[1:31:57] that is why it shocked me and it goes to
[1:32:01] show it's not about time and the message
[1:32:04] it's not about what church you go to
[1:32:06] people go to annoy people sat in from
[1:32:10] the Prophet and then believe think about
[1:32:15] it people were they on the platform and
[1:32:17] in belief when the man was beaten up
[1:32:23] preachers came into the tabernacle those
[1:32:26] believe in ministers if they had
[1:32:29] believed in the gift and protecting the
[1:32:32] gift they would have formed a barricade
[1:32:35] at least if it's not wanna is to see us
[1:32:36] let us all go together as a group but
[1:32:39] every man Bella kindly ran of the
[1:32:43] platform and leave a short profit and
[1:32:45] they thought he was alone
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:50] but this short prophet who was alone had
[1:32:53] the knowledge that no weapon formed
[1:32:55] against me shall prosper
[1:32:57] he had to knowledge that the angel of
[1:33:00] the lord encamps around him that near
[1:33:02] him the same fear the lord this prophet
[1:33:05] angel messenger sign the right hand of
[1:33:09] God had knowledge and the understanding
[1:33:11] that he didn't need to fear the
[1:33:13] understanding he didn't need to worry
[1:33:16] the understanding and he didn't need to
[1:33:18] run
[1:33:19] I'm the wisdom to see you gonna fall
[1:33:24] over my feet somebody helped me this
[1:33:27] morning everybody feelin fine you
[1:33:32] happily been a house of the Lord this
[1:33:33] morning there's no better place to be
[1:33:36] this morning Danny leaves presents
[1:33:38] candid shirts a man with a George I
[1:33:45] forgot my watch so I'm holding you
[1:33:50] accountable to keep me on time so time
[1:33:57] is no more for me it is any problem
[1:34:01] afterwards dr. Burdick angrily in the
[1:34:05] message Christ is revealed in his own
[1:34:07] world brother Branham said see down
[1:34:10] through the edge we started off from the
[1:34:12] foundation from the first church age
[1:34:14] when the seed went in the ground a
[1:34:17] complete seed so he said what went in
[1:34:18] the ground was the complete sheet of
[1:34:20] force then it came to the feet Luther
[1:34:23] come back out then through Wesley then
[1:34:25] into Pentecostals the tongues and the
[1:34:27] lip see now was in the eye so the
[1:34:29] Prophet is speaking about his own
[1:34:30] ministry prophetic of Malachi 4 and so
[1:34:33] forth and now there's nothing else left
[1:34:36] for it to come but him himself to step
[1:34:41] into that because that's the last thing
[1:34:43] there is now listen he said the next is
[1:34:45] the intelligence and this wherever the
[1:34:49] random places is and this is the call it
[1:34:52] the context in the message for this
[1:34:54] theme we have no intelligence of our own
[1:34:58] so we have no knowledge of our own no
[1:35:00] understand
[1:35:01] or no wisdom of our own button brother
[1:35:04] branham goes on we have no sight of our
[1:35:06] own
[1:35:06] how can a man foresee these things he
[1:35:08] can't do it it's God himself see it's
[1:35:10] becoming to a place and he's governed
[1:35:13] the body all the way through then the
[1:35:16] complete body of Christ is revealed in
[1:35:18] the form of a bride that was taken out
[1:35:21] of his side like Adam did at the
[1:35:24] beginning come the church say man so I'm
[1:35:27] gonna place some quotes in here and
[1:35:29] we'll see what God will do in a message
[1:35:31] God in his people he said what is it God
[1:35:36] in his people God in his wood God in his
[1:35:40] servants God in his prophets God in his
[1:35:44] healing or gods here in this building
[1:35:47] tonight and I say he's here today do you
[1:35:49] believe it right now that's right it's
[1:35:51] God in his creation you believe it is
[1:35:53] that right it's gone in his word do you
[1:35:55] believe it
[1:35:56] what's gone in his son do you believe it
[1:35:58] what's caught in his people do you
[1:35:59] believe it
[1:36:00] I can just prove that he's in here now I
[1:36:03] believe that it's God the Holy Ghost
[1:36:05] flowing over this building right now
[1:36:07] that if the same and he'll every person
[1:36:10] in him God is in his people now in the
[1:36:16] upper room they were in one mind and one
[1:36:18] Accord a chord means will or purpose so
[1:36:24] they were in one way of thinking so if
[1:36:27] you came here but they're an official
[1:36:28] message you kept what you expect so you
[1:36:31] was supposed to come to church this
[1:36:32] morning with an expectation in other
[1:36:34] words whoever to be walking and thinking
[1:36:36] a certain way useful to walk into the
[1:36:38] house of God this morning thinking today
[1:36:41] is my deliverance you supposed to walk
[1:36:43] in here this morning thinking I'm gonna
[1:36:46] get the Holy Ghost you were supposed to
[1:36:48] walk in this morning thinking we are in
[1:36:49] revival I'm gonna Branham said if you
[1:36:52] get the people in one mind and one
[1:36:53] Accord in five minutes they'll maybe not
[1:36:56] one sick person inside a building this
[1:36:58] morning so the preaching of the gospel
[1:37:00] is for us to be transformed by the
[1:37:03] renewing of our minds to have a
[1:37:05] different approach to have a different
[1:37:07] talker to have a different walker to
[1:37:09] have a different life
[1:37:10] somebody say man
[1:37:12] Oh hallelujah
[1:37:15] mine is the same here every person here
[1:37:18] God is in his people I believe at night
[1:37:21] time when he calls when he calls at
[1:37:23] ticket you hear that but the man said
[1:37:26] when he calls I take it when God calls
[1:37:29] you don't miss this call when this call
[1:37:31] you take Nicole every time I heard
[1:37:33] somebody say recently the word is like
[1:37:36] trying to get God's phone number but I
[1:37:39] Brandon said it like this he said the
[1:37:41] full obedience to the entire wood
[1:37:44] entitles you to the token so I heard
[1:37:47] somebody speak and he say you know when
[1:37:48] you take a few scriptures it's like a
[1:37:51] key when you have the old-fashioned key
[1:37:53] there were certain grooves so in order
[1:37:56] for the key to work you have to have all
[1:37:57] the grooves for it to turn the lock if
[1:38:01] you have some of the grooves the door
[1:38:03] would never open likewise if you have
[1:38:05] God's phone number and it's a it's a
[1:38:08] seven digit number if you have five
[1:38:11] numbers or six numbers you can't call
[1:38:13] him if you want to cooperate or we do -
[1:38:16] no it's one eight six eight seven four
[1:38:18] one we're living in today that will
[1:38:19] finish it numbers but if you know you
[1:38:23] want to call him 741 you need to get the
[1:38:25] other four numbers correct for it to
[1:38:28] ring his phone now you could have three
[1:38:31] of the other four right and you're gonna
[1:38:32] walk around see now how do seven
[1:38:34] I have before have you one I have the
[1:38:36] next one XY and the rest missing one
[1:38:39] have him six of these seven numbers as
[1:38:42] good or as correct as it is still will
[1:38:44] not get him so when you come to church
[1:38:50] and see what I do this and I do this and
[1:38:52] I read two sounds and that's one of okay
[1:38:55] could great you have that one but you
[1:38:56] need to get all seven to be able to call
[1:38:59] and when you need to call glory you have
[1:39:02] to have the phone number you have to the
[1:39:05] present I know the number to call and
[1:39:07] that number is when the seven step is
[1:39:10] complete in your life that's how he
[1:39:12] makes a big heap that's how he makes a
[1:39:15] believer so when you call heaven you get
[1:39:18] direct access
[1:39:19] because you have all the numbers you
[1:39:22] have all the virtues you have all the
[1:39:24] characteristic you have all the would
[1:39:26] come on somebody preach back to me is
[1:39:29] this helping somebody this morning this
[1:39:32] deals with all those people who say well
[1:39:33] had a spree Anders read but you're still
[1:39:36] living this way
[1:39:37] thanks a number missing because one of
[1:39:39] the numbers they have to be the way you
[1:39:41] live one must be how you talk I'll be
[1:39:44] even nicer over when I talk to my wife
[1:39:45] I'm talking to any old house I said
[1:39:47] number two come on somebody preach back
[1:39:49] to me one number is how you behave and
[1:39:51] work so everything else is good but it
[1:39:54] work
[1:39:54] you look like a temple when you fix that
[1:39:56] number and all the numbers get in
[1:39:58] alignment when this key this key a Fiat
[1:40:01] closer to the groove and a lot of
[1:40:04] blessings that heaven has somebody help
[1:40:07] me this morning so when we cause I think
[1:40:18] it hallelujah you know you think I'm
[1:40:20] crazy that's the Prophet maybe you do
[1:40:23] but I don't think so that's how I feel
[1:40:26] this morning maybe you think I'm crazy
[1:40:28] maybe you do but I don't think so I know
[1:40:30] I'm not crazy
[1:40:31] you see I couldn't lose my mind mine of
[1:40:34] will I have the mind of Christ
[1:40:35] hallelujah
[1:40:37] he's more than life to me you may call
[1:40:40] it whatever you want to hallelujah
[1:40:43] hallelujah you can call the Holy Ghost
[1:40:45] tonight if he said if you want to but
[1:40:47] one day I was a sinner this is the
[1:40:49] prophet speaking now I'm a Christian one
[1:40:52] day I was blind but now I see one day I
[1:40:55] was all kind of one day yonder another
[1:40:57] one said by the Branham I'm sorry to
[1:41:00] leave this burden to you but you are
[1:41:01] finished somebody told the Prophet I'm
[1:41:05] sorry to leave this burden on you that's
[1:41:07] how we are trying to see it nicely sorry
[1:41:09] miss Boone Minya
[1:41:10] but you've finished he said but I said
[1:41:14] two years ago they told me you are
[1:41:16] finished and tonight I'm in the best
[1:41:18] health I ever was God is still in its
[1:41:22] people hallelujah how can I prove it to
[1:41:24] you it is it is it the truth hallelujah
[1:41:27] I remember the brown embrace it our
[1:41:28] Father God we pray now and you'll pour
[1:41:31] yourself tonight upon these people
[1:41:33] and me the everyone be healed hear my
[1:41:36] prayer Lord they are sick ohgod may your
[1:41:38] spirit come upon your poor humble
[1:41:40] servant and me sins be called me people
[1:41:43] be healed of all manner of diseases here
[1:41:46] tonight for we ask in Jesus name Amen
[1:41:49] hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the
[1:41:54] Lord in the message witnesses but the
[1:41:57] balance of cause remember bring it back
[1:42:00] to your memory you can't have the mind
[1:42:02] of Christ and the mind of the world at
[1:42:05] the same time you can't be in your way
[1:42:09] and God's Way at the same time you have
[1:42:14] to get out of your own way to let God
[1:42:17] have his wing that's the only way you're
[1:42:22] ever gonna do anything you've got to get
[1:42:25] away from your own thoughts your own
[1:42:28] reason don't try to reason just believe
[1:42:31] can the church team maybe this will help
[1:42:34] somebody this morning where the man said
[1:42:38] what if Mary tried to reason about the
[1:42:40] Virgin but what is she trying to say no
[1:42:43] wait a minute now look I don't know no
[1:42:45] man there's never been anyone like that
[1:42:46] you see Mary couldn't use knowledge
[1:42:50] because learn knowledge or even man's
[1:42:53] knowledge at that time could not explain
[1:42:56] how a virgin could conceive and if
[1:43:01] knowledge is the foundation you can't
[1:43:02] even understand what you don't even know
[1:43:04] so nobody could have explained to Mary
[1:43:08] how it's gonna happen cause nobody
[1:43:10] understood it because there was no
[1:43:12] evidence there was no knowledge of it
[1:43:14] but it took spiritual wisdom to drop
[1:43:17] down to tell Mary the Holy Ghost will
[1:43:22] overshadow thee every prophet every
[1:43:24] Messenger of God have to go beyond human
[1:43:27] knowledge beyond human understanding
[1:43:28] beyond human wisdom when God told Noah
[1:43:31] Noah build an ark it's about to rain
[1:43:33] there was no knowledge there was no
[1:43:35] evidence to show a green was ever gonna
[1:43:38] fall but no squat hapa is it a mind of
[1:43:41] God
[1:43:42] and Noah started building he couldn't
[1:43:44] understand with his with his natural
[1:43:46] mind but he trusted the wisdom of God
[1:43:48] that it was about to happen and court
[1:43:51] let him come to church see man read
[1:43:53] through the Bible it has been over and
[1:43:56] over and over again can the church say
[1:43:59] man put a man up said Mary never waited
[1:44:02] for anything she just took God at His
[1:44:04] Word and started thanking God for the
[1:44:07] baby before she felt any life before she
[1:44:10] felt anything before one sign was given
[1:44:12] to her she's had it thank God for the
[1:44:14] baby so remember the Branham said
[1:44:16] missing limbs will be restored if you
[1:44:19] have a limb missing I don't need human
[1:44:21] understanding to try to explain to
[1:44:23] anybody
[1:44:24] I don't need human knowledge to explain
[1:44:26] to anybody but I'm thanking God waiting
[1:44:30] because he promised one day we'll
[1:44:32] understand it that's a pie and pie how
[1:44:35] do I need to know it right now I don't
[1:44:36] need to understand right now but if
[1:44:38] God's prophet said it I believe it that
[1:44:41] settles it missing limbs are going to be
[1:44:44] restored it's got to happen glocks
[1:44:49] prophet spoke it these gray hairs have
[1:44:52] to turn back
[1:44:53] black God's prophet said it I believe it
[1:44:58] Oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be
[1:45:05] seated
[1:45:05] I said it before I looked in the mirror
[1:45:07] yesterday that's why I keep my hair this
[1:45:09] slow and like I had to go low because
[1:45:11] I'm here something amiss here mighty
[1:45:13] often E has no missing here hallelujah
[1:45:17] hallelujah this balls what here I'm too
[1:45:20] young for this balls what the devil gone
[1:45:24] with my hair
[1:45:26] well it's got to come back if Adam
[1:45:29] didn't fall we wouldn't get old we
[1:45:31] wouldn't get sick we wouldn't get tired
[1:45:35] Satan came it's of course Eden and turn
[1:45:38] it upside down and God has restored our
[1:45:41] prime the turn it right-side up
[1:45:44] [Applause]

[1:45:49] more back pain no more poor head no more

[1:45:55] and you don't want to be happy brother

[1:46:03] aging reverse come on now
[1:46:05] [Applause]

[1:46:13] this gospel has benefits

[1:48:51] not leaving today without something
[1:48:52] that's how the woman came with the issue
[1:48:55] of blood she decided she made up her
[1:48:58] mind
[1:48:59] I've spent all of the house but I've
[1:49:01] made up my mind that I'm going to church
[1:49:04] this morning I don't care how many
[1:49:06] people there but if I could just touch
[1:49:08] the hem of His garment I know I'll be

[1:49:13] elegance aha

[1:49:20] she was not going home without getting
[1:49:22] something
[1:49:23] she decided have you decided

[1:49:49] I'm gonna brand I'm also said he said
[1:49:51] when you pray and they claim something
[1:49:53] you'll have to go back and claim it
[1:49:55] again it's already yours so when I don't
[1:50:01] come in your mind but Andrew he's had a
[1:50:03] tongue Gordon loader because it's
[1:50:06] already yours
[1:50:07] so when you claim your children and you
[1:50:09] claim victory it's already claimed thank

[1:50:18] lord thank you lord thank you thank you
[1:50:20] for healing me thank you you may be
[1:50:24] seated
[1:50:25] we know the story the blind man came to
[1:50:28] the prophet the Prophet prayed for him
[1:50:30] he went back his way and then he you
[1:50:34] didn't see the healing he came back to
[1:50:36] the Prophet the brother said but I
[1:50:37] already pray for you the first time I
[1:50:40] prayed that was good enough but you know
[1:50:42] what he's you know Saint by his type of
[1:50:44] you begin attest live in it
[1:50:46] beginning its walk in it we cannot claim
[1:50:49] it that's the old rugged seat somewhere
[1:50:52] along the line people lot you old rugged
[1:50:53] feet if you feel that just make it a
[1:50:56] crazy you say that make yourself I could
[1:50:58] see you seen anything I could see you
[1:51:00] see what do you think I can see don't
[1:51:02] worry what I'm seeing but I could see my
[1:51:04] stripes I'm healed stripes I'm a healer
[1:51:06] I didn't wonder at the barbershop his
[1:51:09] eyes popped open and what he was
[1:51:11] speaking about came to pass you ever
[1:51:19] seen
[1:51:19] [Applause]
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:27] Mary before she felt any life before she
[1:51:32] felt anything before one sign was given
[1:51:35] to her she just stood the angels would
[1:51:38] and went rejoicing and praising God and
[1:51:41] our angel messenger Malachi for seven
[1:51:44] inch or gave us oh wait and that word
[1:51:47] should be enough to be rejoicing and
[1:51:49] praising God that's why we emphasize
[1:51:52] praise and worship so much in the
[1:51:54] tabernacle because if God has revealed
[1:51:56] something to you if he has given you
[1:51:58] knowledge of his good and the
[1:52:00] understanding for what it means to you
[1:52:01] then you will get the wisdom to worship
[1:52:03] I can't understand the dead message
[1:52:10] churches because if culture is profit
[1:52:14] give you the knowledge and true cause
[1:52:16] divine intervention understanding of
[1:52:19] what this message means with it become
[1:52:21] the wisdom to worship like the tyranny
[1:52:24] of Peru you worship in with revelation
[1:52:28] and understanding that this thing has to
[1:52:30] come to pass I heard somebody you may be
[1:52:35] seated
[1:52:36] somebody said my office recently some
[1:52:39] eat is a good age to die and all of us
[1:52:42] died and I was the in the kitchen and
[1:52:46] you to go to know if you cannot groove
[1:52:50] here did I make my people straight
[1:52:52] planning retirement nothing wrong with
[1:52:54] my retirement by planning to leave here
[1:52:57] I want to be like enough one day my foot
[1:53:00] will connect to the Kings Highway I'll
[1:53:02] be walking to work walk into Church and
[1:53:05] one day I recognized wait a minute I'm
[1:53:08] not walking on I'm not walking on on
[1:53:10] this tiara anymore I'm walking the Kings
[1:53:13] Highway but if you're not unknown
[1:53:16] thereafter to your life you have no
[1:53:17] rough you to go to if you don't
[1:53:21] Unknowing the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:53:22] you have the Holy Ghost again so when
[1:53:25] Mary said be it unto me according that I
[1:53:27] would that was her anointing the word to
[1:53:30] her life anointing the word to her
[1:53:33] situation so if a word has spoken to you
[1:53:35] this morning your response should be be
[1:53:38] it unto me according to thy word if
[1:53:41] healing is what you need be it unto me
[1:53:44] according to thy word if deliverance is
[1:53:46] what you need be it unto me according to
[1:53:49] thy word if your family is what you're
[1:53:51] looking for be it unto me according to
[1:53:54] thy word and watch God bless you I
[1:54:00] [Applause]
[1:54:08] listen and this is the problem with us
[1:54:11] I'm still the same quote I'm a pitch 9
[1:54:14] president so we goin good residence on
[1:54:17] the 10% before she felt any life I want
[1:54:21] to read it again before she felt
[1:54:22] anything before one sign was given to
[1:54:25] her she just took the Angels wood and
[1:54:27] went rejoice think I'm praising God
[1:54:29] that's not all enough listen to the rest
[1:54:30] of it and when you wonder why you're
[1:54:33] missing certain things made a word -
[1:54:35] they give you the knowledge
[1:54:36] understanding and may he give you the
[1:54:38] wisdom the plan is your life only read
[1:54:41] it one more time I want to get to
[1:54:43] something before she felt any life
[1:54:47] before she felt anything before one sign
[1:54:51] was given to her she just took the
[1:54:53] Angels wood and went rejoicing and
[1:54:56] praising God telling everybody
[1:55:01] you see the father telling everybody she
[1:55:07] was going to have a baby who have you
[1:55:11] told that you're about to have a Holy
[1:55:15] Ghost baby who have you told that you're
[1:55:18] going to be healed you see below when
[1:55:20] you begin to talk about it
[1:55:21] it creates an expectation around you
[1:55:23] even if people mock you it still creates
[1:55:26] an expectation
[1:55:27] no one's billing me up and people said
[1:55:29] that gather they said I have our parties
[1:55:33] around New York because it was a center
[1:55:36] of attraction by didn't matter because
[1:55:38] that is how God unfolds it but if you're
[1:55:41] not telling nobody it makes me one of
[1:55:43] you really believe it because if you are
[1:55:46] really kind of Vince or something didn't
[1:55:49] even have to tell people about it
[1:55:50] then I tell you for me you know I'm
[1:55:52] gonna get healed I'm gonna get heaters
[1:55:56] I'm gonna get here to Abraham I'm gonna
[1:55:59] have a son people was watching him like
[1:56:02] yeah someone have a son Abraham there is
[1:56:07] something gonna have I'm gonna have a
[1:56:08] son I'm gonna have a son because that's
[1:56:11] what God proves his would listen friends
[1:56:13] but the random total court proves his
[1:56:15] word by believers now if there is not
[1:56:18] build-up or anticipation to the miracle
[1:56:21] how people know it is a miracle I like
[1:56:24] you are depending on God to do it so
[1:56:26] when he Abram say I'm gonna have a son
[1:56:27] I'm gonna have a son
[1:56:28] you see Ibrahim boy I don't notice him
[1:56:30] worry about my son everybody who did see
[1:56:32] you know that God of Abraham is real
[1:56:34] it's 25 years no Abraham telling me this
[1:56:37] thing I'd really and truly you know have
[1:56:39] a testimony I didn't believe but now I
[1:56:42] believe because I see somebody testify
[1:56:44] all this goodness and that's what the
[1:56:46] young people need to hear some more
[1:56:48] people testify I am I'm gonna get healed
[1:56:50] I'm gonna about breakthrough and watch
[1:56:52] God do it and then able to say if he
[1:56:54] could do it for him he could do it for
[1:56:56] me that's how the early church was built
[1:57:00] [Applause]
[1:57:03] can the church say man telling everybody
[1:57:07] she was going to have a baby and listen
[1:57:10] to the Prophet God give us some more
[1:57:11] marries around Phoenix here and I want
[1:57:14] to say give us some more marries around
[1:57:16] Trinidad here that can take God at His
[1:57:18] Word and start rejoicing before anything
[1:57:22] happens that's what you need that's all
[1:57:28] for she was overshadowed by the holy
[1:57:30] goose and when the Holy Ghost truly
[1:57:32] overshadows a person they take God at
[1:57:35] His Word that settles it what the Holy
[1:57:37] Ghost said candide should say Amen in
[1:57:40] the message law or grace but a parent
[1:57:43] said and we are fear to know her heart
[1:57:44] the fear of God in our heart and can see
[1:57:47] it clay it becomes a feet and then we
[1:57:50] speak it and it comes into existence so
[1:57:53] understand this seeing it is not just a
[1:57:55] routine but when you say it that is
[1:57:57] taking the thought into wood and when
[1:57:59] wood is spoken just like your father
[1:58:01] will it's materialized so when you keep
[1:58:04] it to yourself and don't see it there's
[1:58:08] nothing to enforce the thought until it
[1:58:12] becomes a word let me save it again
[1:58:14] there is nothing to release the power of
[1:58:17] your thinking until it becomes a word if
[1:58:20] God had said thinking about the son
[1:58:23] thinking about the son thinking about
[1:58:24] his son it was a thought until he spoke
[1:58:26] at the moment he spoke it activity could
[1:58:28] take place likewise when you speaks
[1:58:33] nonsense
[1:58:34] you see intranet you speak choppiness
[1:58:36] when you speak nonsense that also
[1:58:38] materialize sort of walk in this room is
[1:58:44] where a real fear boy what's not if you
[1:58:46] normalize feel I would I feel I speak I
[1:58:48] just feel what should I look at
[1:58:51] everybody failures look at my failure I
[1:58:53] feel and when you live in their world
[1:58:55] what we expect success unless you want
[1:59:01] to be more successful failure
[1:59:05] but whenever a man speak you speak to
[1:59:07] anybody and steal a certain as a job
[1:59:10] they tell them before you leave home any
[1:59:12] morning go any mirror and see to this
[1:59:13] would be a great day
[1:59:15] there's a term we use self what self
[1:59:18] affirmation work for me they have it and
[1:59:21] it's from Scripture each other and you
[1:59:24] see you're gonna make it I'm gonna be a
[1:59:26] success today there'll be no traffic me
[1:59:28] all the road be clear and all kind of
[1:59:31] affirmation ever who booked this read it
[1:59:32] in a book different decent thing today
[1:59:34] I'm a conqueror I'm a king I'm a queen
[1:59:36] I'm a ting leave your house energized
[1:59:41] energized until a child hit them boom
[1:59:43] pull back the book again I can make it I
[1:59:46] can make it because not groaning in
[1:59:49] chorus spiritually hula goes when the
[1:59:52] BAP is a letter weak say I am strong it
[1:59:55] is not that God is ignorant of the fact
[1:59:57] that weakness exists because his
[1:59:59] strength is made perfect in weakness but
[2:00:02] only when you can say I am strong
[2:00:05] [Applause]
[2:00:15] [Music]
[2:00:18] so is he
[2:00:19] we have to understand France God has
[2:00:21] done his part you know he sent
[2:00:24] messengers he sent angels he sent
[2:00:26] prophets he sent science he sent wonders
[2:00:28] to catch your attention for you to get
[2:00:31] the knowledge of who you are who he is
[2:00:32] who the devil is and understanding of
[2:00:34] who you are who he is who the devil is
[2:00:36] and your place in this economy of God
[2:00:39] and to have the wisdom to know when to
[2:00:41] speak winter act when to move for this
[2:00:44] final knockout punch that will kick the
[2:00:46] devil straight out to this bit that's
[2:00:49] what it's all about can the church even
[2:00:52] I listen to the Prophet know I'm driving
[2:01:00] something I know some of you haven't
[2:01:02] seen it yet but I want you to get
[2:01:03] something because many of us we come to
[2:01:08] church and we go back and do the same
[2:01:09] thing and the reason is our thinking has
[2:01:12] not seen
[2:01:27] it becomes a feat and then we speak it
[2:01:29] and it comes into existence the same
[2:01:32] thing cause the mind of crisis in the
[2:01:34] man listen prophet that's what make
[2:01:37] healings and so forth when you get that
[2:01:40] perfect revelation you hear that
[2:01:43] so the healing you're waiting for is
[2:01:46] about your thinking being changed to the
[2:01:49] Magnum Christ the same thing cause the
[2:01:51] mind of crisis in the mind is in the man
[2:01:54] that's what make healings and so forth
[2:01:57] when you get that perfect revelation
[2:01:59] just what you're doing then how to walk
[2:02:02] that's it
[2:02:02] god that's the Christian walk can the
[2:02:05] church say man could he take some more
[2:02:08] in the message the fundamental
[2:02:11] foundation for faith but the Balam said
[2:02:15] now the father and his would hold on one
[2:02:20] second
[2:02:28] now if we throw ourselves completely to
[2:02:31] God now if we could throw ourself
[2:02:34] completely to God and to his will and be
[2:02:37] lost to our own thoughts now that's a
[2:02:41] big problem for us you know friends we
[2:02:43] have our own thinking about how we want
[2:02:45] to do things we have our own ambitions
[2:02:48] we have our own plans I'm half 99% in
[2:02:53] fact they probably have I'm gonna get
[2:02:55] married this age I want to have this job
[2:02:56] I want to have this car I want to have
[2:02:58] this salary that's all you're thinking
[2:03:00] that you had talked to God yet I want to
[2:03:04] be at this I want to be at that I wanted
[2:03:05] to be an actuary that was my thinking
[2:03:08] and palm tree you couldn't stop me from
[2:03:10] what he back to Mary
[2:03:13] had a song Lord prepare me I'm serious
[2:03:19] I'm not joking to be an actuary that
[2:03:23] really was a song that's what I wanted
[2:03:29] but I was my own thinking Noah to all
[2:03:35] the mathematics you need for actuarial
[2:03:38] science is serious mathematics but I was
[2:03:42] my own thinking and if you look back
[2:03:45] through your life and look through what
[2:03:48] you have gone through and all your
[2:03:50] thoughts you would recognize that how
[2:03:55] every serve I used thought about doing
[2:03:57] it didn't materialize because if God did
[2:04:01] have a hand in it it will not
[2:04:03] materialize now if we could throw
[2:04:09] ourselves completely to God after his
[2:04:12] will and we lost our own thoughts and
[2:04:14] just let the mind of Christ being us
[2:04:17] them seem operations of the Spirit who
[2:04:21] work to us just as a natural thing nurse
[2:04:23] just the same thing because we were
[2:04:26] first created for that purpose to
[2:04:29] control to rule and to praise God and to
[2:04:32] live for God now jesus said if he abide
[2:04:34] in me and my words abide in you you can
[2:04:36] ask what you will and it shall be given
[2:04:38] to you if you abide in me and my words
[2:04:41] abide in you now the father and his wood
[2:04:44] is inseparable because the father is his
[2:04:47] son in the beginning was the word and
[2:04:48] the word was with god and the word was
[2:04:50] god and the word has made flesh and
[2:04:52] dwelt among us god and his word is
[2:04:55] inseparable you cannot have God without
[2:04:58] having his wood and when you have his
[2:04:59] wood you have God now I want to place it
[2:05:02] in the promise message so you leave with
[2:05:04] the foundation if you want to go back a
[2:05:06] little further just as far as historical
[2:05:09] you can see the wizard in the beginning
[2:05:10] was the word but what is the word a word
[2:05:13] is a thought manifested a thought spoken
[2:05:17] for God first he perceived the thought
[2:05:19] and spoke it and it became a wood and
[2:05:22] the wood became material so it's thought
[2:05:24] that is spoken and once it's spoken it
[2:05:27] could become material so God thought
[2:05:31] about you smoke you and you are the
[2:05:33] material which is the expression of the
[2:05:35] world to this bride and we're talking
[2:05:37] about represents the material or the
[2:05:40] physical expression of the thoughts of
[2:05:42] God that was spoken through his prophet
[2:05:44] to call a bride out everybody with me
[2:05:47] this morning the son is the material
[2:05:50] that was the expression of course would
[2:05:52] everybody feeling fine so everything
[2:05:56] that God has spoken his would receive
[2:05:58] into the right channel will materialize
[2:06:00] that word for whatever the purpose
[2:06:02] behind it is God will do it he's
[2:06:05] obligated to it then if you abide in me
[2:06:08] and my words abide in you then you have
[2:06:10] a corner and a wood and you and you
[2:06:12] believe the word just as you believe God
[2:06:14] because it is God and it's inseparable
[2:06:17] then if you have coarse wooden you you
[2:06:20] have caused life in you you have corn
[2:06:22] and you are whatever God's Word speaks
[2:06:24] for out of you it will have to come to
[2:06:26] pass just like it was spoke from God
[2:06:28] what are you saying brother Isaac I'm
[2:06:31] sin all these years that you familiar
[2:06:34] with description you familiar with the
[2:06:35] message until it becomes your word until
[2:06:39] it becomes your thoughts it's not your
[2:06:42] message let me say that again for it to
[2:06:46] be your message and I preaches some
[2:06:48] months ago it is
[2:06:49] for the branham's message it's God's
[2:06:52] message to his bride
[2:06:53] but the Branham is the messenger but the
[2:06:56] Branham is the one who transmitted or
[2:06:58] chants with the message I'm going to us
[2:07:00] as people but it's not your message of
[2:07:04] my message until it becomes our thoughts
[2:07:06] and our words and then we can become the
[2:07:09] living expressions of what this prophet
[2:07:11] spoke because we are walking so that's
[2:07:14] why there's no room for my
[2:07:15] interpretation of the message or your
[2:07:16] interpretation where I seen it so and
[2:07:19] how you see in it if we carry on how we
[2:07:21] see if we take any mind of Christ us
[2:07:24] trying to figure it out will not come to
[2:07:26] us solution without a minor crash you
[2:07:28] know we can spend days debating the
[2:07:30] quote with our human understanding and
[2:07:32] our human knowledge but until the wisdom
[2:07:35] of war drops down and that's why but the
[2:07:36] Branham cleared this all up I said God
[2:07:38] is his own interpreter so regrets
[2:07:42] theologians in the message who just
[2:07:44] spend more time academically stood in
[2:07:47] the message gives no greater authority
[2:07:49] on the message because what we need is
[2:07:52] the mind of Christ to show us what he
[2:07:55] wants done with the word the mind of
[2:07:58] Christ how to live as husband and wife
[2:08:00] the mind of Christ as how to live as
[2:08:02] children in appearance houses the mind
[2:08:06] of Christ of how to choose a wife the
[2:08:08] mind of Christ of how to wait for your
[2:08:10] husband the mind of Christ of what job
[2:08:13] you're supposed to get the mind of
[2:08:15] Christ of how to be an example the mind
[2:08:18] of Christ how to run your business
[2:08:19] there's a mind of Christ for every
[2:08:21] matter every situation
[2:08:23] God has a thought about everything
[2:08:30] I don't even get get it off your mind of
[2:08:34] God is only interested in the spiritual
[2:08:36] things when those men had taxes to pay
[2:08:38] go tell him to go and fish he went
[2:08:44] beyond their understanding and their
[2:08:45] knowledge because it was what you see
[2:08:46] where we had taxes at least we go eat
[2:08:48] but when they cut the fish open and it
[2:08:50] was gold to go on pity taxes so you
[2:08:54] think oh I don't want to bless you
[2:08:55] abundantly he has a thought about
[2:08:59] everything he knows what you have in
[2:09:02] your bank account
[2:09:02] you know what bills you have coming up
[2:09:03] but if you keep thinking your own way
[2:09:06] holder solvent you were never even
[2:09:07] giving him room to how to solve it
[2:09:09] he knows how to solve the problem he's
[2:09:11] the best mathematician you didn't work
[2:09:13] in only numbers cards within your budget
[2:09:14] and he recognized have a deficit he know
[2:09:16] that before you even start the
[2:09:17] calculator and his math is different you
[2:09:21] know you didn't walk out on you can work
[2:09:23] and gold say what do we have we have
[2:09:26] five loaves and two fishes we have five
[2:09:29] thousand people to feed let's have
[2:09:32] spring and start to feed it I better
[2:09:36] over preached you guys who was at Katyn
[2:09:38] fullest that's a chance we could I know
[2:09:40] they closed up in the front and say I'm
[2:09:41] not looking back i guessing it for my
[2:09:43] own portion lord thank you for the
[2:09:45] blessing and they don't realize that he
[2:09:47] foods something a multiply because when
[2:09:51] God started work God works completely
[2:09:54] and it was the only realize was a
[2:09:56] miracle when he had a clean up these
[2:09:58] scraps I recognize that it was remainder
[2:10:00] you might even butterflies so much you
[2:10:03] gotta get more but when you bring your
[2:10:08] own thinking that situation you limit it
[2:10:11] but when you stop and say Lord I handing
[2:10:14] it to you and then go ah but you know
[2:10:19] what he wants after that you worship
[2:10:23] you won't see this worship lord I handle
[2:10:25] this problem to you because he said
[2:10:28] class all of our cares upon you that
[2:10:31] scripture I preached this before as if
[2:10:34] you problem any parents is they keep
[2:10:36] giving richer in the border I'm taking a
[2:10:37] bathroom good lord I give you my
[2:10:40] children I made me repossessed take them
[2:10:47] back I'm you trying to teach them I'm
[2:10:49] changing kneeling down and kneel it on
[2:10:51] and leave it on until it kneel flat no
[2:10:54] more million but if you hanok to go say
[2:10:56] lord give them understanding give them
[2:10:58] knowledge because many of us didn't know
[2:11:02] how to raise children we didn't have the
[2:11:04] knowledge we didn't have the
[2:11:05] understanding with empty wisdom and we
[2:11:08] didn't even know from your script you to
[2:11:09] ask God to see a lot because I've ever
[2:11:11] seen if you lack wisdom
[2:11:12] Axford so before you act in any
[2:11:15] situations they're not giving you wisdom
[2:11:17] because he promised to give it to you if
[2:11:20] you ask we are so irrationally at times
[2:11:28] we quit if God was so quick to act
[2:11:32] before we get to repent you know no
[2:11:38] church nobody would be here will be the
[2:11:41] chance but go on extend mercy to give
[2:11:46] any grace so come to the altar and say
[2:11:49] Lord I'm sorry lord please forgive me
[2:11:51] give me another chance
[2:11:54] so before you act in any area of your
[2:11:56] life you say lord give me the wisdom
[2:11:58] where I lack the knowledge show me where
[2:12:00] to go how to do give me the
[2:12:01] understanding of how to say this to my
[2:12:04] wife and the way that would have the
[2:12:06] right effects my tone of voice come on
[2:12:09] but punch every me this morning it takes
[2:12:11] wisdom how do you right toward that
[2:12:15] plenty ways to say things you know you
[2:12:20] can say before there's food there's food
[2:12:22] is in horrible you can say that that's
[2:12:26] one way remember years ago a burner tool
[2:12:30] as well this meal filled
[2:12:34] total failure no no you can't tell me
[2:12:42] she don't want to cook for two weeks
[2:12:43] after that because it's you cause that
[2:12:45] you couldn't find a better way a better
[2:12:48] way to see you didn't ya next time you
[2:12:52] make it yet you really prefer wisdom man
[2:12:54] because one size don't fit all you can
[2:12:57] say the same every time
[2:12:58] cuz if there's a pattern you will
[2:13:00] recognize you don't like it I remember a
[2:13:04] couple I read a story a couple after
[2:13:06] 20-something years
[2:13:10] what you said - like this chicken you
[2:13:14] just make it this way after 22 years and
[2:13:17] she saying you know tell me there's 22
[2:13:19] years I don't like to cook it like this
[2:13:29] but because he didn't know how to say it
[2:13:32] he suffer in penance for 22 years
[2:13:37] eating a chicken he didn't like and
[2:13:39] because she even know how to say she's
[2:13:42] suffering 22 years preparing his chicken
[2:13:44] she didn't want to cook there's a way to
[2:13:48] approach your boss you can't make your
[2:13:52] boss or like a fool by boss watch now
[2:13:54] you really want to do it so and so and
[2:13:56] so when you fire my boss barn fire meals
[2:13:58] there's a way there's a way the
[2:14:04] Centurion approached Jesus for wisdom
[2:14:06] they say I see a man under Authority
[2:14:08] when I say onto one Cody Coe I recognize
[2:14:12] one
[2:14:14] [Music]
[2:14:15] [Applause]
[2:14:19] yeah I am unworthy he was feeding a kiss
[2:14:23] say I am unworthy future coming in my
[2:14:26] house if you just see the word that'll
[2:14:28] be all
[2:14:29] Jesus was so touched by the knowledge
[2:14:32] understanding wisdom that is my news he
[2:14:34] said quote I weigh a servant as he'll
[2:14:39] [Applause]
[2:14:42] look at it one more word he who I did
[2:14:45] was vexed with a devil it's not just
[2:14:50] fair to take a chair umbrella and
[2:14:51] custody dogs we talked about it many
[2:14:52] times by company shoes with the first
[2:14:55] time and a common repair request and I
[2:14:58] asked him to pray for me I never had a
[2:15:00] dog you see this all these dog torches
[2:15:03] he's talking and after that they go on
[2:15:05] she go on her way Alber obviously
[2:15:06] express-news they carry on Facebook
[2:15:08] Instagram interim stories but the fluffy
[2:15:10] hair dogs deceived that whatever the
[2:15:12] corner but she said but but but Lord
[2:15:24] even the dogs get crumbs that was real
[2:15:28] wisdom and listen this woman didn't have
[2:15:31] the Holy Ghost in her I want you to
[2:15:33] understand she didn't have you who only
[2:15:37] goes she wasn't an apostle she wasn't
[2:15:39] preaching for years and he just City
[2:15:41] right thing that what happens this is
[2:15:45] sad you're right
[2:15:46] but the Branham was relating this story
[2:15:49] of what happened with the squirrels
[2:15:50] isn't all right and when he really hated
[2:15:52] it
[2:15:53] sister had here I say that's nothing but
[2:15:54] the truth and with a branham's of the
[2:15:57] Angels if she said the right thing
[2:16:00] and remember what they said your words
[2:16:03] are an expression of your thinking so
[2:16:08] what do you see so when and some of us
[2:16:11] can't help but search we're gonna get
[2:16:13] some I'm not done yet but a Georgia give
[2:16:15] me salami until we sell what we see in
[2:16:20] our homes in our jobs in our lives is an
[2:16:24] expression if I was headed this way
[2:16:26] out of the abundance of your heart the
[2:16:29] mouth speaks
[2:16:30] and as a man think in his hat
[2:16:33] so there's mental thinking there's also
[2:16:35] hot thinking so this whole thing about
[2:16:41] understanding knowledge and wisdom you
[2:16:44] will feel at your job without the
[2:16:46] knowledge of what it takes to work you
[2:16:49] can be an architect every day I see a
[2:16:52] recent job application in a certain job
[2:16:56] we asked him for any person applying for
[2:16:58] a job with none of these skills no skill
[2:17:01] for the job come to realize they misread
[2:17:04] the job you're applying for
[2:17:06] no you don't have the knowledge or the
[2:17:09] job the understanding of what even
[2:17:11] applying for and then you wisdom to know
[2:17:13] what we are your wrong place but on your
[2:17:17] job in your life as a child and you know
[2:17:20] cheering stock offered a certain
[2:17:21] understanding an OD some chewiness swing
[2:17:24] their parents up and down and the
[2:17:27] business world they commercialize in it
[2:17:28] so in marketing we know you put all the
[2:17:30] candy and all the toys are in Lewisham
[2:17:33] it's not the every parent as wisdom is
[2:17:39] there for the children so when we
[2:17:42] children article your parents if they
[2:17:43] see it does not track them but when he
[2:17:45] child on sit and drop to the floor in
[2:17:47] the grocery and Sirte embarrass the
[2:17:49] parents you say okay I'll take it for
[2:17:50] you I'll take it for him
[2:17:54] and children know which pure naked go to
[2:17:58] and get away with what
[2:18:01] your enemy expertly exposed in here this
[2:18:04] morning the use in wisdom it didn't know
[2:18:07] it easier to get to Danny or easy to get
[2:18:10] to mommy when I was in school there was
[2:18:12] a young man in my class who his mother
[2:18:15] told him you're not going to this thing
[2:18:18] with the other boys and he tried it he
[2:18:22] went to his father when his mother went
[2:18:24] out and he called permission from his
[2:18:26] father when he mother came back she be
[2:18:28] the father on each other
[2:18:42] [Music]
[2:18:49] the baby said be wise as a serpent and
[2:18:52] gentle as a dove
[2:18:53] so trout Scripture you see this
[2:18:55] application is this theme of
[2:18:58] understanding this theme of knowledge
[2:19:00] this team of wisdom understanding God
[2:19:03] because God is so fast so big so
[2:19:05] powerful it's difficult enough finite
[2:19:07] minds to fully comprehend his majesty
[2:19:10] comprehend oh he could see a prostitute
[2:19:13] and he could look at the prostitute and
[2:19:15] man would look at how one way but when
[2:19:17] he sees her he has a deeper
[2:19:18] understanding that her name is on the
[2:19:20] book and the outward appearance has
[2:19:23] nothing to do with his love to meet her
[2:19:26] at the well to come to fish for her soul
[2:19:30] and pull her from the clutches of not
[2:19:33] just her sin but the fact that she did
[2:19:35] not know who she was so he was there
[2:19:38] together
[2:19:39] acknowledge that you are bigger than
[2:19:40] this you are born for a purpose
[2:19:43] you are a child of God and your past
[2:19:47] does not define you your mistakes do not
[2:19:50] define you your failures do not define
[2:19:53] you the definition of who you are comes
[2:19:56] from God and what's written about you in
[2:19:59] his book somebody say man this morning
[2:20:06] [Applause]
[2:20:13] but the better piece of all message
[2:20:15] called spiritual amnesia that message is
[2:20:19] to deal with this issue of not knowing
[2:20:21] not knowing who you are because you're
[2:20:25] born in your house here grow up in
[2:20:27] wherever you are limited by what you are
[2:20:30] told you are limited whatever you would
[2:20:32] by a schoolteacher who has a dream my
[2:20:34] dad and I clashed when I was in primary
[2:20:36] school cuz I've always been I said I'm a
[2:20:38] learner another form standard five
[2:20:41] teacher named mr. right and I succumb
[2:20:46] home sir see this sir say this sir see
[2:20:50] if that Tennessee mr. right is not
[2:20:52] always right he could be wrong but the
[2:20:58] message he was preaching and pyramus
[2:20:59] crew is so profound to me that I was
[2:21:02] that was a rule that I was going on but
[2:21:05] that's the product and all of us we are
[2:21:07] the product of what we were taught in
[2:21:08] school from our parents so whether it's
[2:21:12] an abusive home or an alcoholic father
[2:21:14] or academic children are the product of
[2:21:18] their environments here is little
[2:21:21] scientific evidence to support this
[2:21:24] nature versus nurture Theory there's a
[2:21:26] lot of debate about whether brilliance
[2:21:29] is born or you acquired and therefore
[2:21:31] when you take any child but I'm in the
[2:21:33] right environment it could blossom but
[2:21:35] the Branham said if you take a chicken
[2:21:37] egg and put it on that dog it will hatch
[2:21:39] because the environment is what
[2:21:42] determines the result the atmosphere
[2:21:47] I've seen shirin who were called slower
[2:21:50] because somebody spend the time and help
[2:21:52] them help them help them help them after
[2:21:55] a while they found ways to figure it out
[2:21:58] I think Nobel Prize winner Nash the
[2:22:01] mathematician for which the book and the
[2:22:04] movie A Beautiful Mind is written speaks
[2:22:06] of a man who had a mental issue and he
[2:22:09] decided say what almost happened to
[2:22:12] rewire his mind because you recognized
[2:22:15] what was real or does not
[2:22:17] his mental condition but the challenges
[2:22:22] we are totally easy
[2:22:23] that's why Quattro trusts for many teeth
[2:22:26] on the world day and night that's the
[2:22:28] only way to change your thinking not
[2:22:31] watch the news day and night not watch
[2:22:34] morning edition of The Daily proof or
[2:22:36] whatever else it is but if you meditate
[2:22:38] on the Word of God day and night your
[2:22:41] thinking will change everybody I'm
[2:23:04] keeping going George this morning when
[2:23:16] brothers get in trouble proverbs 5 verse
[2:23:20] 1 my son attend unto my wisdom and both
[2:23:25] an heir to my understanding you think
[2:23:28] every that the words may regard
[2:23:31] discretion and that I lips me keep
[2:23:34] knowledge for the lips of a strange
[2:23:36] woman drop as a honeycomb and her mouth
[2:23:39] is smoother than oil but her end is
[2:23:41] bitter as wormwood sharp as a two-edged
[2:23:43] sword her feet go down to death her step
[2:23:46] her steps take all on hell no you tell
[2:23:54] me if you read out any morning and you
[2:23:56] reading that all the time and this is
[2:23:58] more real to you oh you're in trouble
[2:24:02] how you ended up in problems
[2:24:15] but this must be real to you it must be
[2:24:17] your language this is God's language you
[2:24:20] know God found a way to express all of
[2:24:26] himself in a way that you could carry
[2:24:28] around with you the word is God and
[2:24:36] goddesses would this is his voice it
[2:24:40] depart not from it keep it close to your
[2:24:44] heart we fail as Christians when we
[2:24:49] don't read this word but the balance
[2:24:53] said it was this we said God don't make
[2:24:54] half with preaches he doesn't make half
[2:24:56] a Christians but we could be halfway and
[2:24:58] God will your business he will
[2:25:01] your life he will
[2:25:03] everything to force your attention to
[2:25:05] this because you are under his law David
[2:25:11] in discovering that understanding he
[2:25:14] looked and he said but I see people
[2:25:15] prospering around me and wanted to see
[2:25:18] have you considered their end because
[2:25:21] you are under a different law you want
[2:25:25] to go and do what you want to do but you
[2:25:26] are under different covenant and the
[2:25:28] Covenant requires something from you the
[2:25:31] covenant requires a certain contact from
[2:25:34] you there's a tutor assigned to what -
[2:25:37] behavior it is a great reward that's
[2:25:40] assigned to you and because of this I
[2:25:44] expect a certain behavior and that
[2:25:47] behavior ought to be consistent
[2:25:51] consistent you may be seated consistent
[2:26:00] you see church friends not the place
[2:26:02] that is come on shorten jump it's a
[2:26:04] change or behavior so there are times it
[2:26:06] should reinforce what you're doing
[2:26:08] that's good but more importantly it
[2:26:10] should highlight the areas of our life
[2:26:12] where we need to work on a few things if
[2:26:14] you come to church and don't hear what
[2:26:16] needs a change you need to change the
[2:26:18] church
[2:26:20] because we are not here to tell you
[2:26:22] everything is all right we have to make
[2:26:25] sure that you do what is required to
[2:26:27] make it to the rapture to make it to the
[2:26:29] resurrection to make it to the wedding
[2:26:31] supper not to play politics into play
[2:26:33] church but it's Souls I am in the
[2:26:35] balance with the real devil trying to
[2:26:38] pull people to hell and a real heaven
[2:26:40] with God trying to pull them to heaven
[2:26:43] [Applause]
[2:26:49] consistent behavior you want to be a
[2:26:54] Christian or you don't want to be a
[2:26:55] Christian right is wrong right is Right
[2:26:58] wrong is wrong there's no gray area of
[2:27:00] it good sin is sin holiness his holiness
[2:27:04] righteousness his righteousness wrong is
[2:27:06] wrong what was not acceptable 500 years
[2:27:10] ago cannot now be acceptable he said I
[2:27:13] am God and I changed not you may be
[2:27:20] seated
[2:27:21] the requirements for revival a thousand
[2:27:24] years ago are still the requirements
[2:27:26] today
[2:27:27] it requires prayer it requires sacrifice
[2:27:30] it requires holiness it requires the
[2:27:32] world it requires desperation come to
[2:27:37] church see me I want to warn the chiller
[2:27:42] just warning about something this one
[2:27:44] bothers me there are many young people
[2:27:46] who have lost their way doing nonsense
[2:27:48] they love human love decent human
[2:27:51] knowledge understanding of wisdom and
[2:27:52] his godly love granny love is corrective
[2:27:55] it doesn't control foolishness so I will
[2:27:59] see this once today and hopefully also
[2:28:02] repeat it again when young people who
[2:28:04] have been in church back slid and post
[2:28:06] nonsense on social media don't endorse
[2:28:10] it and see you looking good when they
[2:28:11] wear in stupidness
[2:28:12] [Music]
[2:28:16] young lady who grew up knowing not to
[2:28:19] wear pants not to wear makeup not to
[2:28:21] wear jewelry not to go too fast take a
[2:28:23] pic in a party looking good it's not
[2:28:25] looking good
[2:28:29] it's filthy before God that's what the
[2:28:32] Bible says that's the Word of God
[2:28:39] holiness is holy there's no middle
[2:28:41] ground he said I am God and I am holy
[2:28:48] God will have a clean shirt she will
[2:28:50] have a holy church
[2:28:56] that's what Jesus died for that's what
[2:28:59] he died for that's what he paid a price
[2:29:00] for first to live like him walk like him
[2:29:05] the Bible says when you look at a woman
[2:29:07] to lust after you already committed
[2:29:09] adultery in your heart and by the pranam
[2:29:11] said it's two sides of that equation
[2:29:13] it's not just a look to lust but when
[2:29:15] you dress in a way to attract men that's
[2:29:18] filthy before going that's the Bible
[2:29:20] that's the word when sinners entice
[2:29:25] Deacon sent them but don't give them
[2:29:27] permission don't get caught in it that's
[2:29:31] the word also come to church Shaymin
[2:29:36] right knowledge right understanding this
[2:29:39] is another popular gospel it's on a
[2:29:41] popular teaching it's not what people
[2:29:42] want to hear they want to hear that you
[2:29:44] can keep reading two scriptures listen
[2:29:46] to two things and if you foresee
[2:29:47] assembling of yourself together
[2:29:49] you're wasting time because that's the
[2:29:51] word also you have six numbers you're
[2:29:53] missing seven number whatever it is in
[2:29:55] your life you search your heart it's a
[2:29:57] command for sick not that's a command a
[2:30:00] sort of suggestion is that the idea is
[2:30:02] that something being presented to a sick
[2:30:05] not the assembling of yourselves
[2:30:07] together that's why we are here because
[2:30:10] we are obedient to the heavenly words of
[2:30:12] Almighty God
[2:30:14] [Music]
[2:30:15] [Applause]
[2:30:18] [Music]
[2:30:20] [Applause]
[2:30:21] everybody feeling fine so for the young
[2:30:26] peers it's not your parrot and I give
[2:30:27] you rules or pressure or it's what God
[2:30:30] says either you want to serve God or you
[2:30:32] want to please man is it's only two
[2:30:33] forces the only two influences the
[2:30:36] influence of God and the influence of
[2:30:38] man the influence of corn and the
[2:30:40] influence of the devil those are the
[2:30:41] only two influences and our desire our
[2:30:44] call is a please God it begins with a
[2:30:47] fear of the Lord but it turns it a love
[2:30:49] of God we love cost so much we don't
[2:30:52] want to hurt him we love God so much
[2:30:54] that if we make a mistake and mistakes
[2:30:57] will happen but you want to repent we
[2:30:59] don't want to be headstrong why you tell
[2:31:00] him how about it why are you making me
[2:31:02] feel bad if you feel bad about doing
[2:31:05] something wrong thank God because a
[2:31:07] minute still of voice of conviction
[2:31:10] speaking to your heart seeing you could
[2:31:12] change you could turn around there's not
[2:31:15] this mercy yes help for you think about
[2:31:29] our thinking we to review our thinking
[2:31:32] but Abraham said in a message as I
[2:31:36] thought on my way powerful message he
[2:31:42] said it was the Prophet Jacob who had
[2:31:43] done wrong and lied to his blind daddy
[2:31:46] because of a birthright and one day his
[2:31:50] heart began to you and to go back to the
[2:31:52] homeland he must have thought all that
[2:31:54] time it was covered up but when he began
[2:31:57] to get near home he heard that Esau was
[2:31:59] coming out to meet him then he thought
[2:32:02] of his deceiving ways and he prayed all
[2:32:04] night on the other side of the river
[2:32:06] when he thought how he had deceived his
[2:32:09] brother it called him to an all-night
[2:32:11] prayer god knows that's what the church
[2:32:14] needs I remember when the church used to
[2:32:16] call for all-night prayer meeting and
[2:32:18] when the sermon went forth there wasn't
[2:32:20] a dry eye in the church
[2:32:22] everybody wept and cried out before God
[2:32:24] and today it seems like it's
[2:32:25] loose that people just go on living any
[2:32:28] way they want to and sell Syria
[2:32:29] Christians I wonder if we're not nearing
[2:32:32] home we better think on always and turn
[2:32:35] off his testimony's maybe rethink how I
[2:32:39] walk this morning maybe rethink our talk
[2:32:42] this morning it was Moses the mighty
[2:32:44] prophet and all Shepherd she put he
[2:32:48] turned out to be that was wandering back
[2:32:50] behind the mountain one day and a little
[2:32:52] old path that the sheep had made perhaps
[2:32:55] it was very familiar to him but that
[2:32:56] morning was just a little different from
[2:32:58] all the morning's yes seemed to be
[2:33:00] something around him you know Jesus said
[2:33:02] once if they hold their peace the rocks
[2:33:03] will cry out I wonder if the Angels
[2:33:06] wasn't preaching to him talking about
[2:33:07] Moses all of a sudden he began to think
[2:33:10] on his ways and I encourage it sure just
[2:33:14] wanted to think on your ways have you
[2:33:18] been praying have you been seeking have
[2:33:20] you been living rights I want you to
[2:33:22] think on your ways when people look at
[2:33:24] you can they tell that you are Christian
[2:33:26] or do they wonder what your testimony is
[2:33:29] I want you to think on your ways I want
[2:33:31] you to think on how you were last week
[2:33:32] oh you will last month hope you were
[2:33:34] last year hope you would this morning I
[2:33:36] want you to think on your ways it's not
[2:33:38] about who's next to you it's you think
[2:33:40] on your ways this morning how did you
[2:33:42] come to church this morning how did you
[2:33:44] approach God this morning what were you
[2:33:46] doing Friday night when we had church in
[2:33:48] the house of God and even if you
[2:33:50] couldn't make it you could have been
[2:33:51] connected live I want you to think on
[2:33:53] your ways and even if you missed it did
[2:33:57] you listen back to the service on
[2:33:58] Saturday and what to think on your ways
[2:34:00] this morning we really want to be a
[2:34:03] Christian or do you want to live your
[2:34:05] own way I want you to think on your ways
[2:34:07] this morning all of a sudden Moses he
[2:34:11] began to think on his ways how did he
[2:34:13] admit a feeling if any tried to find
[2:34:15] safety while his people wasn't bondage
[2:34:17] this is the Prophet god grant at the
[2:34:20] heart of every preaching here we'll get
[2:34:22] that burden how we can rest in Zion when
[2:34:26] the world is covered with sin and church
[2:34:28] members living in sin we shake this
[2:34:32] chair just morning how can we hold our
[2:34:34] peace when the churches pour to pieces
[2:34:36] by Creed's
[2:34:37] and denominations and Brotherhood is
[2:34:39] separated it has if the Prophet is
[2:34:41] standing here this morning because the
[2:34:44] condition he is speaking to in this is
[2:34:48] in 1959 it's what we live just today how
[2:34:54] can we hold our peace when the church is
[2:34:56] tore to pieces by creeds and
[2:34:58] denominations and Brotherhood is
[2:35:00] separated and the people are becoming
[2:35:02] worldly deep mysteries but worldly great
[2:35:06] understanding but worldly massive
[2:35:09] churches but worldly peanut conformed to
[2:35:14] this world but be transformed by the
[2:35:16] renewing of your mind and people are
[2:35:19] becoming worried when code requires
[2:35:20] holiness or no man shall see the Lord
[2:35:23] God requires holiness holiness in the
[2:35:29] husband holiness and the wife holiness
[2:35:32] in the parent God requires holiness not
[2:35:35] your thoughts on holiness but his
[2:35:37] thoughts on holiness there's a
[2:35:38] difference and Moses began to think on
[2:35:44] his ways how that he had went off in his
[2:35:49] own schooling and training and he know
[2:35:52] that there was a call of God in his life
[2:35:54] but he tried to work it out his own way
[2:35:57] many of us preachers or believers if I
[2:36:00] could see this get in that trouble a
[2:36:02] call of God in our life and then we go
[2:36:04] off and get a schooling that tells us
[2:36:06] that the tears of miracles are past and
[2:36:07] there's no such thing as the baptism of
[2:36:09] the Holy Spirit mainly young people went
[2:36:11] off to school at a university on jobs
[2:36:13] and they forgot about God they allowed
[2:36:16] lecturers and professors and school
[2:36:18] friends and the desire to please and to
[2:36:20] fit in and to belong when you belong to
[2:36:23] the family of God the desire to belong
[2:36:24] somewhere you lost your way in your job
[2:36:27] in your work and you can't find yourself
[2:36:29] and you know it is a call on your life
[2:36:31] you know there's a call in your life
[2:36:34] your family anointing you'll feel that
[2:36:37] still small voice something gripped your
[2:36:39] soul you're pinning a meeting where
[2:36:41] tears stream down your eyes
[2:36:43] you've been enough
[2:36:44] others and you knew you felt the power
[2:36:46] of God but you allow your love to wax
[2:36:49] cold you allow the fervent desire to
[2:36:52] please God but disappear may you think
[2:36:55] on your ways this morning
[2:37:02] allow the desire for money the desire
[2:37:05] for popularity the desire to be a
[2:37:07] success to be a somebody to get the next
[2:37:10] qualification to get the next place to
[2:37:12] get a bigger car to fit in somewhere may
[2:37:17] we think on our way is this morning we
[2:37:21] are being weighed in the balance just
[2:37:22] warning and we're being found one cheeky
[2:37:34] God let you think on your ways as a
[2:37:36] prophet that same God wrote that would
[2:37:39] still lives and holds you responsible
[2:37:42] Twitter when you speak it's got to be
[2:37:47] perfectly kind of change also God's will
[2:37:49] we have to alter our thinking to his
[2:37:53] thinking that's a prophet we have to
[2:37:56] alter our thinking to his thinking we
[2:37:59] have accepted mediocrity because we
[2:38:01] don't want to meet his standard Simon
[2:38:09] justification and excuses because we
[2:38:16] don't want to be held to his standard
[2:38:19] and then we talk about that's not how it
[2:38:21] used to be I remember the old time this
[2:38:23] you all ten days a year but individuals
[2:38:25] want to pull down to you anointing of
[2:38:28] the old time these any man any woman who
[2:38:31] turns away from the world and calls and
[2:38:34] God and as an old-fashioned Remington
[2:38:36] we'll have all fashion results court is
[2:38:40] obligated to give you old-fashioned Holy
[2:38:43] Ghost revival to believers who live your
[2:38:46] fashion boutique or sweet
[2:38:48] he is obligated hallelujah I've heard
[2:39:00] too many testimonies of there being a
[2:39:02] race of sick being healed and the
[2:39:06] conditions have to be there and the
[2:39:08] faith must also be there and the
[2:39:10] behavior must also be there and the
[2:39:12] prayer meetings must also be there and
[2:39:13] the family altars must be there and the
[2:39:16] men taking their place in their homes
[2:39:17] must also be there and the wives taking
[2:39:20] their place must also be there and the
[2:39:22] children taking their place was also be
[2:39:24] there and the Deacons and the elders and
[2:39:26] the ministers everyone in their place
[2:39:27] that's what makes a super Church when
[2:39:32] you find your position me this week as
[2:39:37] of this morning to pull down the
[2:39:39] knowledge of God to change our behavior
[2:39:42] the understanding that the hour is late
[2:39:44] and we cannot leave and the wisdom to
[2:39:47] know that if we call upon God he is
[2:39:49] promised to answer us hallelujah glory
[2:39:54] to God he cannot change we cannot alter
[2:40:00] course would we have to alter our
[2:40:03] thinking to his thinking
[2:40:13] let the mind of Christ be in you then
[2:40:16] you think like he thinks and as he began
[2:40:20] to think on these things but around I'm
[2:40:22] continuing on Moses I can see him
[2:40:25] becoming all Torah there's no man who
[2:40:29] can come into the presence of his own
[2:40:32] past but what gets tore up about it and
[2:40:37] I pray that the Holy Spirit would bring
[2:40:38] every human being here now back to your
[2:40:41] past and look at it then turn to his
[2:40:44] testimony and as he began to think I can
[2:40:49] see that old man with the flowing white
[2:40:50] beard and he said I've ruined my life
[2:40:52] I'm 80 years old and I thought of it
[2:40:55] when I was a young man I would have done
[2:40:56] the right thing but now it's too far and
[2:40:58] the great crystal tears rolling down his
[2:41:01] white piscis and about that time when he
[2:41:04] was drinking on his way there was a
[2:41:05] crackling noise on the side of his head
[2:41:07] while he was thinking on his ways he
[2:41:09] said I'll turn aside to see what this
[2:41:11] thing God has done and I trust that God
[2:41:14] will bring that burning bush in the
[2:41:16] hearing distance of every person in here
[2:41:19] tonight that we can think in our own
[2:41:21] ways and it change Moses when he turned
[2:41:25] his feet from the path of sheep and wild
[2:41:27] animal to the path that God had led him
[2:41:29] through the Red Sea and to the promised
[2:41:31] land thinking on his ways it does us
[2:41:34] good to think on his ways friends the
[2:41:39] service is shifting over this is no
[2:41:41] longer about speaking to you this is
[2:41:43] about you pondering his word you've been
[2:41:45] around long enough to know what's right
[2:41:47] what's wrong and it's time to raise the
[2:41:50] bar it's time to raise the standard not
[2:41:55] because you have lived under it means
[2:41:57] you keep pulling it down and pulling it
[2:41:59] down and pulling it down until you the
[2:42:00] level of comfort but this is this is my
[2:42:02] Christian walk no put the bow it's
[2:42:04] supposed to be and say lord help me help
[2:42:07] me help me to meet the standard a
[2:42:10] standard Paul had the standard Peter had
[2:42:13] the standard at William Branham had the
[2:42:16] standard that was set on the day of
[2:42:18] Pentecost
[2:42:20] he said the promise of the Holy Ghost is
[2:42:23] just as real as it was on the day of
[2:42:26] Pentecost the musicians can get ready
[2:42:29] I'm not gonna be much longer trying to
[2:42:31] wind up this morning thinking always
[2:42:37] whether Brandon went on he said on the
[2:42:39] had caught three times after the
[2:42:43] crowed three times and Peter looked
[2:42:45] up in the face of the Lord Jesus he
[2:42:48] began to think on his ways and what he
[2:42:50] had done to our Lord Peter had been
[2:43:04] there he had seen it and when the test
[2:43:07] came he denied Christ but around him
[2:43:10] said that when he heard a crow he
[2:43:13] looked up and he thought about it and it
[2:43:16] tore him up how could he do that to the
[2:43:20] Lord he could be gonna play something
[2:43:24] softly
[2:43:26] and we do think on your way this morning
[2:43:29] how we have we heard the Lord
[2:43:33] how have we heard our husbands how have
[2:43:36] you heard our wives how are we heard our
[2:43:39] parents how are we heard the ministry
[2:43:42] what we hold against somebody else think
[2:43:46] on your ways and say Lord I need to
[2:43:50] think differently I need a new mind I
[2:43:53] want to be transformed by the renewing
[2:43:55] of my mind I want to know I want a new
[2:43:58] talk I want a new way of life
[2:44:10] after the Kaka crow three times and
[2:44:12] Peter looked up in the face of the Lord
[2:44:14] Jesus he began to think on his ways and
[2:44:16] what he had done to her Lord and the
[2:44:19] prophecy in the word of the Lord came
[2:44:21] into his view for he know what God had
[2:44:22] said that seemed gora told him has told
[2:44:26] us also what to do what did it do when
[2:44:29] he thought in a way is that he had
[2:44:30] treated Jesus and how God denied him
[2:44:32] before the people I know he had tried to
[2:44:35] be one of the world that's what Peter
[2:44:37] did by denying Christ he was trying to
[2:44:40] be like one of the world he tried to act
[2:44:44] like the rest of them but when he taught
[2:44:46] in his ways it drove him into the
[2:44:48] darkness and the Bible says he wept
[2:44:51] bitterly he wept bitterly but if Adam
[2:44:59] said I believe it's cock-crowing time
[2:45:01] now for the Church of the Living God to
[2:45:03] get alone with God and a weeping
[2:45:06] bitterness of tears and say God be
[2:45:08] merciful to me no doubt but there's men
[2:45:14] and women here tonight boys and girls
[2:45:16] that need that same thing all of us
[2:45:18] needed alone with God friends think on
[2:45:27] your way this morning

[2:45:58] greater need for the blood when I think
[2:46:01] of my ways I realize the need for mercy
