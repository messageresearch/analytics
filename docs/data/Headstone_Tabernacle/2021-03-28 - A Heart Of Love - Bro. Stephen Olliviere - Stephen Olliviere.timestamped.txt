[31:29] to be thankful for
[31:31] jesus set me free
[31:36] the bible said that whom the son of man
[31:38] set free is free indeed
[31:40] and i'm very grateful this morning
[31:43] because
[31:44] what god have done for me nobody
[31:47] couldn't do that for me
[31:52] jesus dropped my charges jesus
[31:55] set me free and um what i'm going to
[31:59] tell her this morning
[32:00] is very short i don't want to take up
[32:02] too much of the time because i know
[32:03] brother i would have to come and
[32:05] bring the word but um
[32:08] it's a testimony that's upon my heart i
[32:10] need to share with the church
[32:12] god have been very very good to me god
[32:15] had been gracious to me
[32:18] i was backslidden
[32:22] and jesus dropped my charges
[32:25] you know a lot of people must be asking
[32:28] me
[32:29] brother linda what's happening with you
[32:31] what's going on with you
[32:33] and i try my best to go back in the word
[32:36] and explain to them what's happening
[32:38] with me
[32:39] and my life but most of the time they
[32:43] don't understand
[32:45] right but i just want to tell you that
[32:50] jesus paid it all
[32:57] [Music]
[33:05] sin

[34:16] but just even during the pandemic jesus
[34:18] delivered me
[34:23] jesus set me free during the pandemic
[34:27] [Music]
[34:29] when you see sin allah wrong and death
[34:31] all along and
[34:32] jesus dropped my chest just jesus set me
[34:35] free i
[34:36] can't help but praise god
[34:39] and just two things quickly
[34:43] one of the things i am extremely happy
[34:46] about is to be a christian
[34:49] [Applause]
[34:50] you see sometimes sometimes we just be
[34:53] afraid to say it
[34:55] but say it tell your friends that i
[34:58] am a christian nothing wrong with that
[35:02] be proud to be a christian reproduction
[35:05] because the devil will let you know what
[35:08] time it is with you you know
[35:11] there was a time i got rob home in my
[35:14] house and
[35:17] i was backsliding at that time and
[35:20] god helped me a guy come with a gun

[35:31] first first thing i
[35:32] talked to the guy you know what i told
[35:34] him i was backsliding what i tell him i
[35:36] say

[36:03] to your head you know
[36:05] tell the devil i am a child of god
[36:08] i love jesus
[36:12] and um one of the things that i'm really
[36:15] happy about
[36:16] is that i do not have to walk
[36:20] or match to the drum of that devil's
[36:23] beat again

[45:45] put on therefore as the elect of god
[45:49] holy and beloved bowels of mercies
[45:53] kindness humbleness of mind
[45:56] meekness suffering for bearing one
[45:59] another
[46:00] and forgiving one another if any man
[46:03] have a quarrel against
[46:04] any even as christ forgive you
[46:07] so also do we and above all these things
[46:11] put on charity which is a bond of
[46:14] perfectness
[46:15] praise the lord and first corinthians
[46:16] chapter 13
[46:19] verse 8
[46:24] charity never faileth but whether there
[46:27] be
[46:28] prophecies they shall fail whether there
[46:30] be tongues they shall cease
[46:33] whether there be knowledge it shall
[46:35] vanish away
[46:37] with nine for we know in part and we
[46:39] prophesy in part
[46:41] but when that which is perfect is come
[46:44] then that which is in part
[46:46] shall be done away with amen may the
[46:49] lord
[46:49] others which is blessings to the reading
[46:51] of the word amen god bless you may be
[46:52] seated this morning
[46:54] amen so my old title this morning is
[46:59] a heart of love and the inspiration
[47:03] is it will take perfect love amen
[47:07] praise god and from the message from
[47:11] that time
[47:12] brother branham is praying for the
[47:14] people
[47:16] he said lord i pray now
[47:19] that your spirit will be sweetly upon
[47:22] them let them say from this time
[47:25] on that their attitudes have changed
[47:30] the hardness that was in their hearts
[47:32] has melted away
[47:34] and a sweet peace and divine love
[47:38] have taken its place may each one
[47:41] receive
[47:42] the baptism of the love of god in their
[47:46] heart
[47:47] amen give the lord a hand of praise this
[47:49] morning amen
[47:51] is that your prayer this morning
[47:53] hallelujah for a baptism of the love of
[47:55] god in your hearts
[47:56] is that your prayer this morning give
[47:58] him praise give him praise
[48:00] hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus
[48:03] are you on the expectation this morning
[48:07] glory to god amen this is a very simple
[48:10] thought
[48:11] but i pray that the holy spirit will
[48:13] magnify to your hearts amen by the grace
[48:15] of god
[48:16] praise god amen so in mark chapter 12
[48:20] 30 it says
[48:23] thou shalt love the lord thy god with
[48:25] all thy heart
[48:27] all thy soul all thy mind
[48:30] and all thy strength so we want to look
[48:34] at the heart to the amen
[48:38] we got to give him our whole hearts can
[48:40] we say amen
[48:41] amen and matthew chapter 22 verse 36
[48:45] master which is a great commandment to
[48:48] the law
[48:50] jesus said unto him thou shall love the
[48:53] lord thy god
[48:55] with all thy heart with all thy soul
[48:59] and with all thy mind this is the first
[49:02] and great commandment hallelujah
[49:06] and then in luke chapter 10 a lawyer
[49:08] tried to attempt jesus
[49:10] he said master what shall i do to
[49:13] inherit eternal life
[49:16] jesus answered him thou shalt love thy
[49:19] god
[49:20] with all thy heart with all thy soul
[49:23] with all thy strength with all thy might
[49:26] and thy neighbor as thyself don't forget
[49:29] your neighbor now amen
[49:30] praise god one more scripture joshua
[49:33] chapter 22
[49:36] take diligent heed to do the commandment
[49:38] and the law
[49:39] which moses the seventh of the lord
[49:41] charged you
[49:43] to love the lord your god and to walk in
[49:46] all his ways
[49:47] and to keep his commandments and to
[49:49] cleave unto him
[49:50] and to serve him with all your heart and
[49:53] soul
[49:54] can we say amen
[49:58] so in all these scriptures we see that
[49:59] we have to love god
[50:01] and serve him with all our hearts amen
[50:04] we see that god is interested in the
[50:06] heart of men amen
[50:07] can we say amen amen glory
[50:10] so from blind bartimaeus says
[50:15] don't trust in head knowledge because
[50:18] god knows your heart
[50:21] so yes we read and study and make sure
[50:23] you know every verse if you can
[50:26] knowledge is good we ought to have it
[50:28] but after all your knowledge
[50:31] god is still looking for something
[50:34] he's looking this morning he's looking
[50:37] past your knowledge
[50:39] is looking at hearts what is he looking
[50:42] for my and just for a background to show
[50:47] that god looks at the heart from first
[50:49] samuel chapter 13
[50:51] and but isaac struck it in the bible
[50:53] study on march 9th
[50:56] speaking about king saul but now thy
[50:59] kingdom shall not continue
[51:02] the lord had saw him a man after his own
[51:05] heart
[51:07] and the lord had commanded him to be
[51:09] captain over his people
[51:11] because thou has not kept that which the
[51:14] lord
[51:15] commanded thee glory
[51:19] so saul was in a battle against the
[51:20] philistines and the people were
[51:22] scattered all over
[51:23] and fearful saul wanted to offer up a
[51:26] peace offering to god
[51:28] to gain god's favor in a battle
[51:32] but instead of waiting on saul the
[51:34] prophet and priests
[51:37] saul went ahead and offered up the
[51:38] sacrifice for himself
[51:41] and god was displeased with saul's
[51:43] actions and
[51:44] right there the lord sought for another
[51:47] man
[51:48] after his own heart
[51:52] what is god looking for
[51:56] saul went on again later on the lord
[51:59] told saul to destroy the amalekites
[52:01] all of them and everything they had but
[52:04] saul kept the best sheep and cutter
[52:08] and only destroyed some which he felt
[52:10] were not valuable
[52:13] in addition saul did not execute king
[52:16] aegon
[52:17] as the lord instructed
[52:20] my and in first samuel 15
[52:24] the lord repented that he had made saul
[52:26] king
[52:28] saul had turned from god's instructions
[52:31] and commandments
[52:32] my god and saul wanted to sacrifice some
[52:36] beasts
[52:37] unto the lord but god rejected king's
[52:41] soul
[52:41] and his offering right
[52:44] and samuel told him behold
[52:48] to obey is better than sacrifice
[52:52] and to hearken and the fat of rams amen
[52:55] so obedience is better than sacrifice
[52:58] amen
[52:59] hallelujah samuel said rebellion is as
[53:02] the sin of witchcraft
[53:04] stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry
[53:08] samuel said because thou has rejected
[53:10] the word of the lord
[53:12] god has rejected thee from being king
[53:16] my so don't have a stubborn heart
[53:20] a rebellious heart amen don't have a
[53:22] stubborn heart this morning amen
[53:24] so god rejected saul and god is looking
[53:28] for another king hallelujah glory
[53:32] so in acts 13 paul says i have found
[53:36] david
[53:37] the son of jesse a man after my own
[53:40] heart
[53:41] and he will do all my will praise god
[53:44] amen
[53:46] so a man after god's own heart will do
[53:49] god's will can we say amen can we say
[53:53] amen
[53:54] it does not matter what the world thinks
[53:55] about him it's what god
[53:57] thinks about him oh glory to god
[53:59] hallelujah
[54:00] thank you jesus praise god so god chose
[54:04] david to be king a man after his own
[54:07] heart glory notice
[54:13] it was not that david was sinless
[54:17] david did many unpleasant things
[54:21] it was not that david never made
[54:23] mistakes or had false
[54:25] no he had many thoughts
[54:28] are you sure it was david that was the
[54:30] man after god's own heart
[54:34] you mean the man that committed adultery
[54:36] and staged the murder of the woman's
[54:38] husband
[54:39] david are you sure is that the man after
[54:43] god's own heart
[54:46] that man uriah was david's most faithful
[54:49] soldier
[54:50] he set him up at the front of the battle
[54:52] to die david
[54:54] you mean god chose david
[55:00] how many times you look at your own self
[55:02] and you say me lord
[55:04] what did you see in me lord sometimes
[55:08] you don't even like your own self
[55:09] you see your failures you see your
[55:11] mystics you see this and that
[55:13] but lord what is it that you saw in me
[55:16] that you bypass
[55:17] one million other people and chose me
[55:22] this morning you are one in a million
[55:24] this morning you are one in a million
[55:26] hallelujah praise
[55:28] god amen and let me say it this way
[55:31] one million other persons were lost when
[55:34] god
[55:35] saved you give him praise give him
[55:38] praise this morning hallelujah
[55:40] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he saw
[55:44] you
[55:45] he chose you he loved you
[55:48] he elected you by predestination he put
[55:51] your name on the book
[55:53] give him praise hallelujah he saw the
[55:56] sins that you were going to commit
[55:58] and he prayed for them with his blood
[56:01] the passings
[56:02] the presence the future since he has
[56:05] already paid for them
[56:07] with his blood can you give him praise
[56:09] this morning
[56:10] can you give him praise this morning
[56:12] hallelujah
[56:14] hallelujah glory
[56:17] [Applause]
[56:19] now many people will look at your faults
[56:21] and say devil child
[56:23] you will look at your own flesh and
[56:25] condemn yourself
[56:27] but this morning what does god see in
[56:29] your heart
[56:32] is there a genuine seed of god on the
[56:35] inside of your heart
[56:38] if so then that's the real believer
[56:42] praise god and you got to know that by
[56:44] divine revelation this morning
[56:46] give the lord a hand of praise amen
[56:48] that's the real believer the seed in
[56:50] your soul amen
[56:52] glory to god amen amen amen amen
[56:57] so let's look at david what did god see
[57:00] in david
[57:03] after david sinned
[57:07] he repented david had a repentant heart
[57:13] in psalms 51 have mercy upon me o god
[57:17] according to thy loving kindness
[57:19] according to the multitude of thy tender
[57:21] mercies blot out my transgressions
[57:24] hallelujah you see his attitude amen
[57:28] wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and
[57:30] cleanse me from my sin
[57:31] for i acknowledge my transgressions he
[57:34] is confessing to the lord
[57:36] hallelujah amen perch me with hyssop
[57:40] wash me and i shall be whiter than snow
[57:43] oh created me a clean heart oh god renew
[57:46] the right spirit within me
[57:49] cast me not away from thy presence and
[57:52] take
[57:52] not thy holy spirit from me hallelujah
[57:55] praise
[57:56] god amen hallelujah this morning restore
[58:00] unto me
[58:01] the joy of my salvation give him a hand
[58:04] of praise
[58:05] hallelujah hallelujah david had
[58:08] a repentant heart glory to glory amen
[58:14] what are the sacrifices of god the
[58:16] sacrifices of god
[58:18] are a broken spirit a broken
[58:22] and a contrite heart god will not
[58:25] despise and contrite means
[58:29] remorseful repentant sorrowful
[58:33] amen that is the kind of heart that
[58:36] david had
[58:37] a contrite heart a repentant heart
[58:41] that is the kind of heart that god is
[58:43] looking
[58:44] for amen and the songwriter said
[58:47] brokenness is what i long for brokenness
[58:50] is what i need we need brokenness this
[58:53] morning hallelujah
[58:54] oh break me and melt me lord hallelujah
[58:57] is that how you feel this morning
[58:59] is that how we feel this morning don't
[59:01] look around anyone else
[59:02] today we are looking at our own hearts
[59:05] yes lord amen praise god amen
[59:08] yes lord amen break me lord amen take me
[59:11] down to the potter's wheel praise god
[59:14] amen
[59:14] yes lord amen david was a man
[59:18] after god's own heart give the lord a
[59:21] hand of praise
[59:23] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god
[59:28] another quality of david he was
[59:32] merciful
[59:35] and saul became very jealous of david
[59:37] after a while
[59:38] and he hunted him to kill him saul's
[59:41] hatred for david increased greatly
[59:44] david had to hide from saul to stay
[59:46] alive
[59:48] and one time saul took three thousand
[59:50] men in pursuit after david
[59:52] and they came very close to where david
[59:54] was hiding
[59:56] during the night when saul and his men
[59:58] were asleep
[1:00:00] david and abishai sneaked into saul's
[1:00:03] camp
[1:00:04] and found saul abishai wanted to kill
[1:00:08] saul
[1:00:09] right there and then but david stopped
[1:00:12] him
[1:00:13] david showed mercy to the man who wanted
[1:00:16] to take his head
[1:00:18] hallelujah david respected saul
[1:00:21] as god's anointed even though he himself
[1:00:25] was already anointed by samuel
[1:00:27] to be the king my amen
[1:00:30] hallelujah he showed mercy and david
[1:00:33] took soil superior and water jug
[1:00:35] that were right by his head and left the
[1:00:38] camp
[1:00:40] and later on he called out to saul who
[1:00:42] then realized that david could have
[1:00:44] killed him oh my
[1:00:46] my my my but david showed mercy can we
[1:00:50] say amen
[1:00:51] can we say amen and in matthew 5 7
[1:00:54] blessed are the merciful
[1:00:56] for they shall obtain mercy
[1:00:59] oh glory to god amen hallelujah
[1:01:02] hallelujah hallelujah what about you
[1:01:05] have you ever been in a position to take
[1:01:07] revenge on someone
[1:01:09] who has done you a lot of wicked things
[1:01:12] what did you do did you show mercy
[1:01:17] or did you serve justice
[1:01:21] what is in your heart brother i'm so
[1:01:24] glad that all god is merciful
[1:01:26] aren't you glad this morning that god is
[1:01:28] merciful hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:30] hallelujah
[1:01:31] yes lord amen mercy
[1:01:34] is when god does not give us what we
[1:01:37] deserve
[1:01:39] we deserve to go to hell but abraham
[1:01:42] said
[1:01:44] adam pinned that on us that we deserve
[1:01:47] to go to hell
[1:01:48] because we were born in sin and shaped
[1:01:50] in iniquity none of us righteous
[1:01:53] can we say amen from another message he
[1:01:56] said when man sinned
[1:01:57] he separated himself from god he was
[1:02:00] across the chasm from god with no way
[1:02:03] back
[1:02:04] but god rich and mercy hallelujah
[1:02:07] and wonderful in grace made a way
[1:02:10] back can we say amen this morning
[1:02:12] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:15] hey amen glory to god amen
[1:02:20] listen question what is the difference
[1:02:23] between mercy
[1:02:25] and grace
[1:02:28] hallelujah mercy is when god does not
[1:02:31] give us the judgment we deserve
[1:02:34] amen you sin
[1:02:37] you should die the wages of sin is death
[1:02:41] but god says no mercy says
[1:02:44] no i'm not gonna let you go i'm not
[1:02:48] gonna let you slip away you don't have
[1:02:51] to be
[1:02:51] afraid hallelujah mercy said no praise
[1:02:55] god
[1:02:56] sin will never take control thank you
[1:02:59] jesus
[1:03:00] but mercy said no give the lord a hand
[1:03:03] of praise this morning
[1:03:04] thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah
[1:03:08] oh praise god amen
[1:03:12] so mercy is when god does not give us
[1:03:14] the judgment we deserve
[1:03:17] but grace what is grace grace is when
[1:03:20] god gives
[1:03:21] us what we do not deserve
[1:03:24] my so you sin
[1:03:27] you should die mercy said no but grace
[1:03:31] says
[1:03:32] i forgive you now you are my son
[1:03:35] now you are my bride all that i have is

[1:09:15] from the message stand still but ibrahim
[1:09:18] said
[1:09:19] you say i belong to church but that has
[1:09:22] nothing to do with it
[1:09:25] he said hell is made up of church
[1:09:28] members
[1:09:29] my let me say that one more time
[1:09:33] you say i belong to church that has
[1:09:36] nothing to do with it
[1:09:38] hell is made up of church members
[1:09:42] my so we are not striving to come all
[1:09:45] these
[1:09:45] miles all these years to become a good
[1:09:49] church member no no no amen he said
[1:09:52] that's not good enough
[1:09:53] that has nothing to do with it can we
[1:09:55] say amen
[1:09:56] can we say amen got to know by
[1:09:59] revelation and by experience
[1:10:01] that there is a seed inside your soul
[1:10:03] that is hungering and
[1:10:05] thirsting after god amen hallelujah
[1:10:09] no wonder jesus said blessed are they
[1:10:10] that hunger and things after
[1:10:12] righteousness
[1:10:13] because they shall be filled say that
[1:10:16] this morning
[1:10:17] shall be one more time shall
[1:10:20] be filled give the lord a hand of praise
[1:10:23] o praise the name of the lord
[1:10:25] you're going to be filled with the holy
[1:10:26] ghost that seed in you will push forth
[1:10:28] to life
[1:10:29] born again by the spirit of god
[1:10:31] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:33] can we say amen can we say amen praise
[1:10:36] god hallelujah
[1:10:38] glory yes lord
[1:10:41] so i introduce that background to show
[1:10:43] you that this whole christian experience
[1:10:45] is not only about how much you know
[1:10:47] knowledge
[1:10:49] and again i'm not trying to play down
[1:10:50] the significance of godly knowledge
[1:10:52] but i want to underscore the necessity
[1:10:55] for a heartfelt
[1:10:56] life it has more to do with your heart
[1:11:00] and the condition of your heart than we
[1:11:02] think
[1:11:03] can we say amen
[1:11:06] and this is a simple message but the
[1:11:08] burden that god placed upon me is to
[1:11:10] tell you
[1:11:10] the kind of heart that god is looking
[1:11:13] for
[1:11:14] is a heart of love can we say amen
[1:11:17] a heart of love amen glory
[1:11:21] and all the qualities that david had
[1:11:24] that made him a man after god's own
[1:11:26] heart
[1:11:27] every one of them came from a heart of
[1:11:29] love for god
[1:11:31] amen repentant and merciful and
[1:11:34] passionate trusting humble
[1:11:37] faithful and many more all tied to his
[1:11:40] love for god
[1:11:41] the love that he had in his heart for
[1:11:43] god amen
[1:11:45] and we are called to have a heart of
[1:11:48] love amen love for god enough his people
[1:11:50] can we say amen this morning
[1:11:52] yes lord amen glory so let's move on
[1:11:58] what is god who is god
[1:12:02] we can't begin to come comprehend who
[1:12:04] god is
[1:12:05] but a bible being god in print form
[1:12:09] the word of god is god the bible said
[1:12:11] first john 4
[1:12:12] he that love it not knowing that god for
[1:12:15] god
[1:12:16] is love is that right god is love
[1:12:20] amen if our message brahman said love is
[1:12:22] the most perfect thing there is in the
[1:12:24] bible
[1:12:25] and god is love they that love are of
[1:12:28] god can we say amen glory to god amen
[1:12:32] from hebrews chapter 2 problem says now
[1:12:34] god was in the beginning
[1:12:36] before there was any light before there
[1:12:38] was ever an atom of style
[1:12:40] any visible thing god filled all
[1:12:43] space and in that space was nothing but
[1:12:47] purity pure love pure holiness
[1:12:51] pure righteousness it was spirit amen
[1:12:54] hallelujah and god is a very essence of
[1:12:57] love
[1:12:58] his spirit covers all the solar system
[1:13:00] from eternity to eternity
[1:13:02] all love all power godly love agapo
[1:13:05] he's the fountain of all that hallelujah
[1:13:08] amen
[1:13:10] amen he's the fountain of love this
[1:13:12] morning amen
[1:13:13] glory and men of all ages have tried to
[1:13:17] explain
[1:13:18] this great love of god it is fathomless
[1:13:21] as the skies brother branham says
[1:13:24] there is no way to ever try to explain
[1:13:26] the depths of the love of god
[1:13:28] hallelujah for god is loving man his
[1:13:31] very being his love
[1:13:33] amen seven perfect spirits can we say
[1:13:36] amen this morning
[1:13:37] glory to god god's love is divine love
[1:13:41] agape love amen
[1:13:43] and hebrews chapter four amen brahma
[1:13:46] explained that there are four levels of
[1:13:47] love
[1:13:48] amen first is perfect love that's god's
[1:13:51] love
[1:13:52] pure and adulterated divine love amen
[1:13:56] praise god number two then there is fill
[1:13:59] your love amen which is earthly
[1:14:01] that's the love for your family but it
[1:14:03] has some perversion in it
[1:14:05] my number three then lustful love
[1:14:08] it has more perversion in it then number
[1:14:11] four there's filthy love
[1:14:13] it keeps on getting more perverted
[1:14:16] but by the look baba said god's love
[1:14:18] agapo
[1:14:19] is million miles higher praise god
[1:14:22] every love outside of agapo is perverted
[1:14:25] love
[1:14:26] which has an end a couple of has no big
[1:14:29] beginning
[1:14:30] and it will never have an end can we say
[1:14:32] amen praise god
[1:14:34] hallelujah glory to god amen thank you
[1:14:36] jesus
[1:14:38] so in the garden sin perverted the pure
[1:14:41] love
[1:14:42] that adam shared with his family and
[1:14:44] with god in the beginning
[1:14:47] sin brought lust and fear and hatred and
[1:14:50] murder
[1:14:52] my in other words the heart of love
[1:14:56] in eden pure gentle divine
[1:15:00] soft passionate for god
[1:15:03] tender hearted that kind of heart it
[1:15:06] changed
[1:15:08] it became a heart of stone perverted
[1:15:10] carnal
[1:15:11] hateful fearful my my my amen my my amen
[1:15:16] glory to god glory to god jeremiah 17
[1:15:20] the heart is now deceitful above all
[1:15:22] things
[1:15:23] and desperately wicked who can know it
[1:15:26] my my my my no one of the songwriters
[1:15:30] said
[1:15:30] what can be done with this whole heart
[1:15:33] of mine
[1:15:34] please soften it up praise god where the
[1:15:36] holy ghost and fire
[1:15:38] hallelujah hallelujah oh praise god that
[1:15:41] old heart praise god
[1:15:44] but in ezekiel 36 we have promised a new
[1:15:47] heart
[1:15:48] a new heart also will i give you and a
[1:15:50] new spirit will i put
[1:15:52] within you and i will take away the
[1:15:53] stony heart out of your flesh
[1:15:55] and i will give you a heart of flesh a
[1:15:58] heart of
[1:15:59] love oh glory to god amen and i will put
[1:16:02] my spirit within you
[1:16:03] and cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:16:07] hallelujah if you love me keep my
[1:16:08] commandment o praise god hallelujah
[1:16:12] glory to god glory to god glory to god
[1:16:15] amen the holy ghost will be your control
[1:16:17] tower
[1:16:18] right in the middle of your heart tied
[1:16:21] by
[1:16:21] chains of love you become a prisoner of
[1:16:24] love
[1:16:25] only doing god's will your heart
[1:16:28] becomes the throne of god can we say
[1:16:31] amen
[1:16:32] can we say amen a place for god to live
[1:16:36] praise god amen glory
[1:16:40] so our whole christian experience is a
[1:16:42] journey back to god
[1:16:44] back to love because god is love can we
[1:16:47] say amen
[1:16:48] can we say amen amen back to perfect
[1:16:50] love divine love
[1:16:52] pure love agape love back to a heart of
[1:16:55] love give the lord a hand of praise this
[1:16:57] morning
[1:17:00] glory so love is key
[1:17:04] love is the objective paul emphasizes to
[1:17:07] the church
[1:17:08] how we must get back to love
[1:17:11] make no mistake about it don't fool
[1:17:14] yourself
[1:17:15] from divine love but abraham said no
[1:17:17] matter how much we try to bluff
[1:17:19] we are negative without love can we say
[1:17:22] amen
[1:17:23] amen and first corinthians 13 though i
[1:17:26] speak with the
[1:17:26] tongues of men and angels and have no
[1:17:29] charity
[1:17:30] i'm nothing i've missed the mark
[1:17:32] completely praise
[1:17:33] god my god my god he said though i
[1:17:36] prophesy and understand all mysteries
[1:17:38] and knowledge
[1:17:39] i am nothing without love my god he said
[1:17:43] though i have
[1:17:44] faith to move mountains and have no love
[1:17:46] i am
[1:17:47] still nothing praise god my god my god
[1:17:50] he's trying to show the importance of
[1:17:52] love to the church amen
[1:17:55] my and some people feel that charity
[1:17:58] means feeding the poor
[1:18:00] but paul says though i give all my goods
[1:18:02] to feed the poor
[1:18:03] i am still nothing without charity my
[1:18:06] he said do i give my body to be burned
[1:18:08] and have not charity
[1:18:10] i am still nothing it will profit
[1:18:13] nothing whatsoever
[1:18:15] my so charity is not just feeding the
[1:18:19] poor some people say
[1:18:20] man this charity here is divine love the
[1:18:23] love of god
[1:18:23] can we say amen praise god hallelujah
[1:18:26] amen
[1:18:27] and first corinthians 14 follow after
[1:18:30] charity
[1:18:31] we must get it somebody say must get it
[1:18:34] must get it praise god hallelujah the
[1:18:36] love of god amen that's the love of god
[1:18:39] even christ
[1:18:40] amen love love amen the perfect love of
[1:18:44] god
[1:18:44] and colossians chapter 3 says above all
[1:18:48] these things
[1:18:49] put on charity hallelujah hallelujah
[1:18:53] hallelujah
[1:18:54] how many one charity how many won that
[1:18:57] promise praise god we must have it
[1:18:59] we must have it amen glory
[1:19:02] glory glory glory glory give the lord a
[1:19:04] hand of praise we must have it
[1:19:06] we must have it we need it we want it
[1:19:08] praise god amen
[1:19:10] hallelujah hallelujah this feel your
[1:19:12] love that we have is nice
[1:19:14] but it could fail us we love and love
[1:19:17] until somebody does do something wrong
[1:19:19] and then we don't love anymore
[1:19:25] we love our family and our friends alone
[1:19:28] ma you love people in your churches
[1:19:32] you love people in your church more than
[1:19:34] people in another church
[1:19:35] he said that's perverted love can
[1:19:37] somebody say amen this morning
[1:19:39] oh my god my god my god hallelujah
[1:19:42] praise god
[1:19:43] he said that is failure and it cannot
[1:19:45] work praise god
[1:19:46] ah hallelujah so fill your love cannot
[1:19:49] work
[1:19:50] we need charity this morning we need the
[1:19:53] charity praise god hallelujah
[1:19:55] the love of god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:00] when the people crucify jesus enemy or
[1:20:04] friend
[1:20:05] it did not matter he said father forgive
[1:20:07] them
[1:20:08] and when you fail and do things you
[1:20:10] should not do he says i forgive you
[1:20:13] i love you no less
[1:20:17] go and sin no more hallelujah and he
[1:20:20] wraps his arms of love around you
[1:20:22] he loves you with an everlasting love
[1:20:25] somebody praise him this morning
[1:20:27] somebody praise him somebody praise him
[1:20:29] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:31] hallelujah praise god thank you jesus oh
[1:20:34] glory to god
[1:20:35] [Applause]
[1:20:36] so choose love over hate
[1:20:40] choose to love love is the most powerful
[1:20:43] force there is
[1:20:45] love will conquer anything every enemy
[1:20:47] praise god
[1:20:48] love will endure forever when everything
[1:20:50] else fails
[1:20:51] love will still be there can we say amen
[1:20:56] hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:21:01] how will they know that you are
[1:21:03] christians how
[1:21:05] john chapter 13 by this shall all men
[1:21:08] know that you are my disciples
[1:21:09] if you have love one to another give the
[1:21:12] lord a hand of praise
[1:21:14] give the lord a hand to praise amen love
[1:21:16] one to another amen
[1:21:17] so we have to treat each other right
[1:21:20] with love show kindness
[1:21:22] colossians three husbands love your
[1:21:23] wives titus too let the older women
[1:21:26] teach the younger sisters to love their
[1:21:28] husbands
[1:21:28] and to love their children amen can we
[1:21:31] say amen
[1:21:32] praise god amen so the older sisters
[1:21:35] have some work to do amen
[1:21:36] to teach the younger ones to love their
[1:21:37] husband brother smiling amen but he also
[1:21:40] say husbands love your wives
[1:21:41] amen sister smiling now amen
[1:21:44] glory so come on love is the key
[1:21:47] say amen love is the key amen hallelujah
[1:21:52] glory even the gifts of the church
[1:21:55] brother branham said
[1:21:57] perfect love brings perfect gifts
[1:22:00] he says so work first with love and then
[1:22:03] that brings
[1:22:04] fellowship and then fellowship brings
[1:22:06] gifts can we say amen
[1:22:08] hallelujah hallelujah come on now he
[1:22:11] said one time
[1:22:11] i'd rather have a church that knows
[1:22:13] nothing about any spiritual
[1:22:15] gift and just be so in love with each
[1:22:18] other
[1:22:19] and with christ i'd rather have that
[1:22:23] then every spiritual gift operated in
[1:22:26] the church
[1:22:28] he was trying to show how important love
[1:22:30] is among the people
[1:22:32] amen a heart of love for god and his
[1:22:35] people
[1:22:36] thank you praise god he said you can
[1:22:40] have
[1:22:40] every gift and still be lost
[1:22:45] again he said i'd rather have that
[1:22:46] experience of love
[1:22:48] than all the gifts that god has in
[1:22:51] heaven

[1:24:07] your elijah

[1:33:37] glory love your enemies
[1:33:41] but about him another story you remember
[1:33:44] the story of the prophet
[1:33:45] with a maniac man killing preachers in
[1:33:48] oregon
[1:33:50] a 300-pound man out of this insane
[1:33:53] institution
[1:33:54] about six feet two there were over five
[1:33:58] thousand people in the audience about
[1:33:59] 300
[1:34:00] preachers on the platform the man ran up
[1:34:03] the platform
[1:34:04] shouted you hypocrite you snake in the
[1:34:07] grass i'll show you how much man of god
[1:34:09] you are
[1:34:10] i'll break every bone in your body
[1:34:13] but abraham was a small man he said when
[1:34:16] that happened you could hear a pin drop
[1:34:18] in the audience
[1:34:20] hundreds of sick people were there he
[1:34:23] said
[1:34:24] i'm kept on speaking then a man rushed
[1:34:27] up to the
[1:34:28] to brother branham on the pulpit and
[1:34:29] spit in his face
[1:34:31] my and you know what happened the holy
[1:34:35] spirit came down and said he will fall
[1:34:37] over my feet
[1:34:38] and he did but from the message god
[1:34:41] provided a lamb he explained it a little
[1:34:44] differently
[1:34:45] brabham said what was it
[1:34:49] did i hate the man he said no
[1:34:53] i love him a poor mortal in that
[1:34:57] condition
[1:34:58] that was not the man speaking that was
[1:35:01] the devil
[1:35:02] the devil made a challenge and the holy
[1:35:04] spirit challenged him back glory to god
[1:35:07] amen
[1:35:08] praise god all fear was gone
[1:35:12] love cast away all fear but you cannot
[1:35:15] bluff it
[1:35:16] you have to have it you cannot bluff
[1:35:19] love amen so we need it we must have it
[1:35:22] we have to add it praise god amen
[1:35:24] but abraham said the power of hatred and
[1:35:27] the power
[1:35:28] of love met together but love will
[1:35:31] overcome hatred
[1:35:32] every time give the lord a hand of
[1:35:35] praise
[1:35:38] praise god
[1:35:40] but abraham said make me real i don't
[1:35:43] want to impersonate it
[1:35:45] i want something real god give it to me
[1:35:49] give me a reality this morning lord i
[1:35:51] need it lord give it to me praise god
[1:35:54] amen
[1:35:54] hallelujah you can't bluff it you can't
[1:35:57] impersonate it
[1:35:58] satan will figure it out praise god you
[1:36:00] gotta have it praise god amen
[1:36:02] glory he said love your enemies
[1:36:06] love your enemies amen love your enemies
[1:36:09] praise god amen
[1:36:11] glory talking about the heart of love
[1:36:15] love conquers all love is the most
[1:36:18] powerful force there is there is nothing
[1:36:21] stronger than love
[1:36:23] my can you say amen there's nothing
[1:36:26] stronger than love amen
[1:36:28] praise god glory amen so let's strike
[1:36:31] the inspiration
[1:36:33] it will take perfect love
[1:36:36] so from the message messiah 1961
[1:36:39] the ram says when god placed man in the
[1:36:41] garden
[1:36:42] god gave him some of his birth
[1:36:45] part of his life he was in the image and
[1:36:49] likeness of god can we say amen
[1:36:51] hallelujah so adam
[1:36:55] had the love of god this is
[1:36:58] i'm seeing this it's not part of the
[1:37:00] quote so adam had the love of god amen
[1:37:03] the fellowship and harmony with god
[1:37:06] glory
[1:37:07] adam had dominion over every creature
[1:37:11] and over all the earth can we say amen
[1:37:14] genesis 1 glory there was perfect love
[1:37:19] he had not only the authority but the
[1:37:23] power to control
[1:37:24] glory to god amen he ruled it
[1:37:28] well he ruled it with love
[1:37:31] hallelujah oh glory to god and i believe
[1:37:34] the animals felt the love
[1:37:37] he ruled with love the earth felt the
[1:37:40] love
[1:37:41] the plants the animals the ocean nature
[1:37:44] itself
[1:37:45] felt the love praise god
[1:37:48] hallelujah he used the language of love
[1:37:53] he used the power of love to rule and
[1:37:57] conquer every creature
[1:37:59] no wonder the lion laid down by the lamb
[1:38:01] praise god
[1:38:02] what perfect peace and harmony existed
[1:38:05] praise god amen
[1:38:07] can we say amen he had
[1:38:10] a heart of love it was the oneness of
[1:38:14] god and man
[1:38:16] he had the heart of god he had the mind
[1:38:18] of god he had
[1:38:20] the love of god hallelujah amen glory
[1:38:24] it was the likeness of god for god is
[1:38:26] love amen
[1:38:28] glory continuing oh what a perfect love
[1:38:32] on the earth that existed
[1:38:34] before the fall of sin it was

[1:38:49] before the fall glory to god amen
[1:38:52] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:55] amen it's not a quote but i'm trying to
[1:38:57] stick with what the bible said amen
[1:38:59] glory amen then
[1:39:03] sin came the true
[1:39:06] ownership of the earth never really
[1:39:10] changed because god
[1:39:13] still had it but the rulership the
[1:39:16] leadership change
[1:39:17] satan became the god of this world
[1:39:22] no wonder when satan temporarily took
[1:39:25] over
[1:39:26] and sin stepped in perfect love was gone
[1:39:30] the animals became fierce
[1:39:33] the leaves began to fall
[1:39:37] storms raged over the earth
[1:39:40] hallelujah hallelujah and praise god i

[1:39:57] hallelujah so the animals became fierce
[1:40:00] the earth itself
[1:40:01] storms rage for the first time
[1:40:05] the creation became sad
[1:40:09] it grieved for his master
[1:40:12] in romans 8 it says the whole creation
[1:40:15] is growing in pain
[1:40:16] until now from then
[1:40:20] until now bye groaning in pain
[1:40:22] hallelujah
[1:40:23] waiting waiting for the rightful rulers
[1:40:28] waiting on manifested sons who are just
[1:40:31] like how adam was before the fall

[1:40:36] with a heart
[1:40:37] of love oh glory to god give the lord a
[1:40:40] hand of praise
