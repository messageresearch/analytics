his wife but Isaac over and his wife also he's not here but um we certainly appreciate him also and and um we've been um tremendously blessed um to be Under The Canopy of life amen and um we just thank God for that because that's God's leadership well I don't mean to kill too much time I'm just kind of uh waiting for my computer here to um to get a clue amen but uh we're ready now and we want to turn to two portion of scriptures I thank you so much for your patience 1 John 4 we want to read from verse 7 and uh I also want to read from 1 Peter 1 uh 4 to8 okay uh sorry 2 Peter 1 4 to8 sorry so that's first John 47-8 uh and actually that's 2 Peter 1: 14-8 you might just have to make an adjustment there in the back um for that but we'll read uh quickly from 1 John chapter 4 and um 7 to8 okay amen 1 John 4 and verse 7 says beloved let us love one another amen for love is of Goden and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God am he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love amen and now we also want to read from second Peter uh chapter 1 uh that's second Peter chapter 1 and verse uh 4 familiar scripture and it says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that that that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ may God add blessing to these scriptures let's bow our heads almighty God here we stand in your presence Lord in this dawn of this New Year 2025 Lord we know that you are still on the Earth moving things around Lord Jesus we thank you for your spirit that has been with us Lord father Lord and if it not had been with us Lord we would have been swallowed us up quick Lord the enemy would have had us but your grace is sufficient for us Lord your Tender Mercies are new every morning and they are new right now this morning and we thank you for your grace Upon Our Lives Lord As We Gather here now to hear the word of God we want to just surrender all of us Lord before the presence of God because we can't do it on our own we need you every step of the journey this morning Lord and we admit how small we are and how great you are Lord and I pray de God that you would come in your own special way may you break the bread of life here among the people Lord may you speak to every heart Lord may you soften us up Lord father with the the oil and the wine Lord may you minister to us father in ways that Lord that would make us more uh uh uh usable father Lord that we could be led and used of you dear God because you're looking for such a people Lord father in the last day Lord who would be Mighty upon the Earth Lord so may you take us now as we yield ourselves your word come and Shake us Lord where we need to be shaken may you minister to us where we need strength there God and give us power for the journey Lord for there is much land to be possessed there God so we pray you have your way one more time I Just Surrender myself now in these people we surrender ourselves to your awesome presence may you move in whatever way you choose in Jesus Christ's precious name amen and amen you may have your [Music] seats oh praise God well it's certainly a privilege to be here one more time and we have a title this morning amen praise the name of the Lord so my title is when Divine love projects Sovereign Grace takes its place when Divine love projects Sovereign Grace takes its place amen and amen so are you happy to be in his presence this morning amen am just give me one second here uh I just want to make a quick adjustment amen so we've been blessed so far by the messages I know I have been even up to last Sunday uh with the message that we heard the tape amen do you appreciate that to brotherly kindness at charity what a message from the Lord and so we know that uh God is speaking by his word amen and uh I had a little inspiration here on the of God and I was thinking about it some weeks now and so when I heard what was spoken um it just blew my mind because it was right down the same channel but uh brotherly kindness as a key the Wednesday before that was also really outstanding and I feel like amen for those of you who are here and for those of you who heard the tape we were mightily blessed by that and we know that this is the requirement for our age it's brotherly kindness and so we are going to be duly tested uh on brotherly kindness so that we could prove it to prove brotherly kindness because that's what the age requires that's it and um so the objective of today's message that I have I wanted to start with an objective so we we we understand where we're going right this is why we're here now and this is why why I'm doing all of this um so the objective is to we want to just kind of show a link now and I'm seeing it as a link between brotherly kindness forgiveness and this love of God this supreme love of godall uh and I truly believe that there is an anointing there's a there's a spirit that's connected to this as well we're not talking about brotherly kindness being as a text or as a nice practice or as a moral scruple or something that we a code of conduct that we should live by or words on a wall in a company that that that's not what we're talking about we this is an actual Spirit um that is supposed to come upon us it's not a mental conception but Bram said uh he said the problem we have in bam Tabernacle is there's there's two kinds of knowledge there's two kinds of temperance two kinds of patience one is natural and the other one is spiritual so we're not talking about natural Temperance or natural patience we're not even talking about natural brotherly kindness because it's it's nice to forgive it's nice to be nice but that's not what we're talking about this morning what we're talking about is an actual spirit of God that comes upon us it's a sweet anointing that comes upon the mother when she's getting ready to bring forth a baby amen amen hallelujah and you spiritual mothers in here getting ready to bring forth Christ a sweet anointing has to come upon us this morning Hallelujah in order to bring forth the the perfect one oh Hallelujah Hall it's it's a real thing it's a force that the devil is flattened by He Is squashed by this Force his his weapons become powerless his his words become disarmed when we put this into gear and we want to turn that key this morning Hallelujah Hal because we feel like it's a key that has to be turned in order to flip us over from the natural into the Supernatural and it will take perfect love to get us over there how do we get into perfect love brotherly kindness Spirit of forgiveness has to come upon you and raise you up above your natural now the spirit of God is here this morning don't get too distracted cuz he's here he's moving now he can sweep down the aisle and baptize you with the Holy Ghost you just stay on fire for God because I am not in control this morning Jesus is at the wheel I'm I'm actually in the back seat I'm I'm having a cool kids praise God Amen Hal he is in charge this morning Hallelujah glory be to God the Lov him so that's my that's the objective that's what God give me right I'm just trusting that he'll help us this morning to bring it out in a way that will will be helpful here and we just surrender to his word now amen oh praise God so we pray that it's that sweet anointing that will sweep over us even while we're speaking this morning we in expectation that what we're talking about could actually become a reality Among Us that fervent charity could be felt among us so much that the devil would have no place in here Among Us oh draw a bigger Circle and we're going to love Out the Devil and we're going to love in our brother so we're going to start with love this morning the prophet said start with love because love will bring Fellowship Hallelujah and fellowship will bring the gifts it'll bring a Revival it'll bring a come see what I found oh H the coin I was lost come and rejoice with me oh all whosoever will can come into the love of God hallu Amen praise God you believe it this morning so when we speak about love we usually Identify two things the prophet spoke of it many times and we just want to lay it as a a backdrop to this today and of course we know F your love which is the Greek word that means friendly love or affection often used to describe a love between close friends isn't that right that's that's that's an Earthly kind of love that that's the kind of love that we are accustomed to that is what is familiar to us um I'm pretty sure if we had our own choice this morning uh there was no Usher here we would sit in the seat that we like we I know you're laughing but it's true me I I would do too that that's just human nature we we I would sit next to somebody uh uh that I am familiar with that that I am comfortable with because as a human being we we like safety brother over was talking about it in the in the bible study on Friday we we we like the comfort zone we like to sit next to people we we know and we like we we are comfortable with people that make us feel safe right that's just that's just how we are very few of us would would feel free or open or brave enough to step out of that comfort zone uh maybe sit in the front seat somewhere you know uh people like to shuffle in the back where where they feel they could just be a little a few rows behind somebody else that's just how it is and that's just a familiarity that's that's how humans are and when we love we we we we base our love on that sense of familiarity uh we if someone does good to us we will do good back for them if someone don't like our head we don't like their head neither uh you know if if you don't scratch my back then I'm not going to scratch yours um don't even ask me to do it because uh you know I just we we just don't have that we just don't click but then there's agape love and agape love is that Greek word that that refers to that pure unconditional and sacrificial love that love is above that filal love that we just talked about it's high above it it there's not a love above that comp there's no comparison that that love endures everything it goes past how you feel it goes past your condition it's it's unconditional isn't that right there's no condition there's no set form of conditions that need to be met in order for agape love to be expressed to you God just loves God is love Yeah and love is of God and anyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love oh and it is This Love that cast out all fear It Is This Love that rescued us when we were broken it was this love that look past who we were look past our sinful condition look past what we were this love reached down into the depths of the darkness and pull your soul out of hell and if you want to ask me why God love you go ask Grace I don't have an answer God just loves oh he loves and he knows who will love him back oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but it doesn't stop God from loving he just loves Hallelujah and his love this morning Hallelujah is an Unstoppable Force his love this morning is why we're sitting in this Tabernacle his love this morning it is only by his love I could call you brother I could call you sister it is only by his love by his love it allows me to go past filal love to go past familiar love and love a love that is unknown and go beyond into the supernatural going to the things that I don't know about F your love can't take you there but a gape love God's Own love can take you into a place that you may not be familiar with oh hallelujah hallelujah hallah that's where God is oh beyond the stars Beyond this natural Beyond this Earthly realm is a love that surrounds all things he's beyond all things it is above all things isn't that right God's love is elective love he chose you before the foundation of the world he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should bring forth fruit Hallelujah and that your fruit should remain isn't that right he he he chose you before the foundation of the world it pleased God uh to choose you don't don't ask me how because because when I look at myself I don't see nothing worth loving uh everybody can find Fault In Their Own selves some some people find they could be taller some people find they're too tall some people find they're too dark some people find they're too light some some people find they're too they they're too skinny some people want to lose some weight uh and and however you are this morning it doesn't matter what condition you find yourself in God loves you God loves you just the way you are and he doesn't desire that you stay the way you are but one thing we can't deny this morning is that he loves you and his love is going to rescue you and bring you into a condition that is favorable that is that is just that is righteous but it's not you doing it it's his love it's his love of reaching down in the midst of all your fear and pushing it aside love is going to take first place in your life in your heart oh Hal it is the work that he is doing right now it's all because of Love isn't that right Adam and Eve when they fell in the Garden of Eden there was a fear there that dropped upon them they they realized that they were naked they realized for the first time that you know they saw themselves and they they hid themselves and they were ashamed of themselves and and their own condition and father God came down into the midst of the garden and began to shout Adam Adam where are you uh because you're not in the position that I left you when I when I when I when I left you last uh you're out of place I I can't find you in your place that I have left you the place that I have put you Bible said he planted a garden and called it Eden and and then he placed man in that garden positionally and everything else to to do the work that he had raised him up to do uh but here it was God come back uh in the garden and one day found a a situation that was a lot different than when he had had left it last and here was man uh fumbling at his words saying that I was afraid and we were afraid and we we we hid ourselves Hallelujah and the Bible says that God told them the day you eat that day you shall surely die Hallelujah but we know that God in that moment when he saw that they needed help when he saw that they needed a savior they were supposed to surely die but something happened God God killed an animal [Applause] the wrath of God that was supposed to come down upon them came down upon an animal instead and that animal was a substitute for them the Bible said he took the skin of that animal and he clothed them in it they were drenched in the animal's blood and in the sacrifice that that was just made as a perfect type for a sacrifice that was going to be made for us years later cousins of time later isn't that right but here was God performing his first act on Earth of a sacrifice being made for man to take his place uh to save him because he needed saving and in that moment God acted Hallelujah in that moment God did something and that's what love love does sometimes love does crazy things oh Hallelujah but it's loveen in action oh Hallelujah isn't that right glory to God God's love is corrective isn't that right amen because he loved he gave isn't that right you can give without loving but you could hardly love without giving I'll say that one more time cuz that just went over you you can give without loving but over always says you could give stuff you don't want you know I got a old shirt I I'll give it to you I'll give it a I have old shoes I'll give it to you um but you can't hardly love without giving if if you if you really love somebody or if you really love something you're going to give whatever you have even if you don't have material things to give you will still give of your time you will still give of your effort you will still pour into it your your inspiration your creativity your passion and even if you can't do nothing you'll just stick around just to let people know I'm here I'm in support of this and if I was able I would do something because I've got love for what's going on here I've got love for the people here isn't that rightall love gives God's love is corrective Hallelujah isn't that right Hallelujah he he corrects us when we need to be corrected because every son that come to God must be tested must be tried because he wants the best for you he'll straighten you out he straightens out everybody he he doesn't have any favorites he doesn't have somebody who he like to give food to and not like to give food to that that's that's not God is everybody gets the same plate some through the waters some through the flood some through great trials but all through the blun they're going to come through because they are his children you you are his children this morning we are the children of God and he wants the best for you and he will deal with you as Sons and Daughters Hallelujah because what father loved his son and doesn't correct him amen isn't that right if a natural father would correct his son out of love out of a natural love that he have for his son and how much more would God correct us when we need correcting because he doesn't want us to stay as we areu he wants us to grow and to become mature and to be able to handle things on our own because it pleased God to turn his back in Eden Hallelujah and know that Adam was managing things that that he was control of things that that nothing was out of cater nothing was out of order it it it pleased God to do that uh God is not running around in everything trying to do everything he set up systems in place sir to run things sir notice nature is never in a hurry it knows that its season will come fruits will come this is not in a hurry to try and bring forth fruit it's it's not in a hurry to try and grow and get fast it it knows that it'll happen in time soon the rain will come it will come it might take a long time but the season will change because God set up the seasons for things to run on its own he's not running around in the sun and the moon and the stars trying to keep things moving no no no it He's Got The Whole World in His Hands he knows what's going on and he know knows that he set up a time and a season for everything to happen in its time and in its season and every one of us tonight every one of us this morning have a time we have a season when all fruit are going to come in when our tree is going to bring forth and Blossom Hallelujah and though it might say a while though it might car wait for it oh that tree will be restored again oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the restoration of the Bride tree is on season come season go there's Brides brides churches churches but God knows that when the season comes around there's going to come one who will not be like Eve she will not be deceived she will have his attributes she will have his nature she will have his Spirit she will be flesh of his flesh she will be bone of his bone she will be Spirit of his Spirit you're going to be just like Jesus do not appear what we shall be but we know when he shall begin to appear oh we shall we shall be like him and God is appearing this morning oh he's appeared in the prophets and he's about to appear again in The Bride of Jesus Christ oh and when he shall begin to appear we shall be like him and we shall see him in his glory oh and there'll be a Revival and the sick will be healed and the blind will see and the will look and the lame will get up out of their cuts and the young people will be on fire for God uh and the devil won't find a place in the Church of God but he'll be bound by a chain of circumstance I feel the power of God is getting ready to ride in this morning oh he's routing the [Music] enemy Hallelujah glory to God amen amen oh I'm on fire for God I'm not waiting for it to come yes sir I'm on fire now now Faith is oh even if the Our God don't deliver us we will not bow down not to any Creed no Dogma I have no Creed but love I have no Dogma but the Bible hallelujah praise God Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah amen Oh Glory Glory let's start with love this morning it can't go wrong starting with [Applause] [Music] love wow amen because love is of God God is love he loved you and if he loved you then why can't I love you too if he if he died for you and why can't I do something good for you brother God help me then how I ought to be able to extend that back and practice God's love among God's people it is uh we are commanded to forgive cuz if you do not forgive neither will my Father in Heaven forgive you but if you could forgive if you could release it from your heart that God could come in there and begin to do something and take you on another level because you're starting to leave the familiarity thing you beginning to leave the fio realm and you begin to step into a realm of the unknown when you begin to forgive you're actually going into something else because the world is it doesn't noce the the the human nature the spirit it just is designed to to steal to to be destructive to to to to stay on their own they you know there's a different kind of love called eras love which is erotic love selflove people are are loving themselves Hallelujah and the Bible actually says in the last day men shall be lovers of themselves that's a spirit that is upon the Earth today but that is not the spirit that we have we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father and that spirit is going to Bear witness with your spirit when God sees you forgiven amen when God sees you loving when God sees you repenting when God sees you treating each other right that spirit will bear witness with your spirit and let you know from above that you are the sons of God God's going to send fire on that when you can forgive when you can repent when you can make it right when you can release your ought your Grudge whatever it is this morning and God will confirm it and make it alive then we'll see The Headstone coming forth with shoutings crying what Grace Grace Grace unto The Headstone UNM merited favor we didn't deserve it but he did it for us oh Hallelujah we draw a bigger Circle this morning and we love Out the Devil and we love each other we pledge to love the Brethren amen he cared for usall because he he loves us now the clearest distinction between these two forms of Love filo and Agape is that fio love is a human love isn't that right and and it's based on a condition but agape love which is Godly love is reflective of a higher state that is without condition isn't that right Hallelujah there's no set form of circumstances there's no prerequisite needed to access this Godly love it is without condition isn't that right God is love and God is Sovereign and his love is Sovereign and he could love whoever he choose to love and God just choose to love everybody he could do that because he's gone do you believe it this morning CH John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting lifeall this passage of scripture is one of the most profound and complete passages of scripture in the in the Bible Prophet talked about it he said this one passage of scripture has led many to Christ because in this one passage of scripture contains a whole message the whole message of the Bible the whole message of why God sent his son in the first place and what the whole point of it is it's it's all contained in this one passage of scripture if we don't get nothing else this morning if if we don't remember what song was sung and what scripture was read if we just remember this one Passage morning we could take home meat just from just from this one passage this morning because here in this passage Christ in the scene is in the night time I don't know if it's around a campfire or if he was just talking with Nicodemus but Nicodemus is a man a Pharisee come to Jesus by night and he couldn't uh stand to be seen in the day uh because of his Association and and his affiliation with with with the pharan council so he choose to come by night to to inquire of Jesus because he heard enough to to make him to make him uh thirsty he heard enough salt to make him thirsty he wanted a little more of what he had heard and what he had heard and and seen I hear say he he listened to the tapes and he he listened to the hookup but he he needed to come and see something and he didn't feel too comfortable in the day so he came in the night time seeking Jesus seeking his counsel he he had some questions and as we know he asked how should I man be born again and Jesus tells him you know it's not of your mother's womb but but born of the spirit of God and he's expounding and he's giving Nicodemus so much word he's given him so much H to go with it's it's it's really it's really wonderful it's almost like he he he he went for a basket and and he got a whole truck CL he went with a little shopping cat and he end up leaving with with with with a one ton truck amen of stuff in his pickup pray but that's how Jesus does he he gives because he loves that's just how he is if you BNS God had enough love come out it'll fall on you it'll fall on your brother it'll fall on your sister oh Hallelujah if you squeeze him love will come out and that's how God want you to be God wants us to be so filled with these virtues that if you bounce us virtue will come out if you squeeze us a little bit knowledge will come out brotherly kindness will come out oh just a sweet as ever oh that's the Thunder that will shake the devil in the last days when these holy and unify lives are living out in sweetness and humility praise praise God hallelujah that's what we need today thousands of live voices in Jeffersonville in sangry Grandy in Nigeria in North America South America wherever you would find them here's my spirit flowing freely here's one over there I can place him I can place her the adoption that's the age we're coming into now and I

amen amen amen so for God so loved the world that he gave gave His only begotten son that whosoever will believeth on him would not perish but have everlasting life it says for God it wasn't man's desire it wasn't the animals it wasn't the trees it wasn't the it wasn't the birds and it wasn't the Beast God so loved the world it was God that loved it was God that created us and because he loved us he so loved us oh it wasn't just love but it's so loved oh there's a whole deep love that goes in there it's more than just what you think it's it's above what you think above what you can feel above set circumstance above how low you feel how how how how disappointed you feel how unworthy you feel his love is above that above that this morning above every circumstance you are in this morning his love is above all of that reaching down and pulling you up this morning there is a force trying to pull you downwards hatred and animosity Creed and strife that's the devil and his forces but also another Force Hallelujah forces pull this way and that way but God's Force pulls you upward oh and upward is where we want to go we're going up yonder to be with my god oh I can't stay down here this world is not my home I'm just a passing through oh Hallelujah not from here this [Applause] morning we are from another place where this love is more familiar to us and I hope it become more familiar to us as we near the resurrection amen um so he so loved the world doesn't just one person Bible says he loved the whole world that same uh Vision brother spoke about it uh a couple Services back brother Brandon was in that uh Tavern or restaurant or whatever and he saw that lady who was in such a condition and when God tapped him and showed him the vision there was the blood of God surrounding the whole world wasn't just one person it wasn't just one brother or one sister it wasn't what you think or what you like or what you familiar with it was the whole world was covered with the blood of Christ and the blood was acting as a bumper pumping away and the prophet said every time he would make a mistake whether he was conscious or unconscious of it Sin is Sin and it has to be judged and the only thing keeping you from being judged this morning with the wrath of God for your sin is the blood of Jesus Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God that blood is keeping you keeping your feet from falling keeping you from dashing your foot against a stone the Lord that keepeth de he shall neither slumber nor sleep for the Lord is thy keeper and the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand and the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the Moon by night he will preserve thy Soul he made a perfect sacrifice this morning he made it possible to preserve your soul to preserve you from all evil to preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and forever more great is the Lord oh and greatly to be praised this morning oh somebody Praise Him somebody worship him for his greatness is unsearchable oh hallelujah hallelujah the blood prevails no matter what the devil say thank God Hallelujah for the blood prevails and it'll never lose its power its power is still here this morning power to save just like in olden days the power of hell is broken when Jesus died on the cross and from his side blood poured out water gushed out oh H said father forgive give them they know not what they do and when that final virtue was displayed he gave up The Ghost and something a spirit was released and that spirit is here this morning that spirit is here to set you free to fill you with himself to surround you with himself flames of fire are here this morning uh to take you up out of the natural and bring you up into the supernatural oh where the glories never fail where the impossible is made possible oh [Applause] Hallelujah we are nearing that time now oh it won't be [Applause] long we don't have a lot of time [Applause] the dismantling of America is already underway God have a man inspired to do it Peace by peace it is falling apart at the seams it'll come straight to the prophecy the prophet talked about it spoke like a lamb then they will speak like a dragon and and and things will begin to happen very quickly Christ was on the road to the crucifixion a lot of things was happening very quickly very quick succession even when he appeared before the head priest and he tore his robes off and everything all of that was prophecy being fulfilled everything was just happening it was just God fulfilling prophecy fulfilling his word and it was just happening seen after seen after SE in a matter of a night and a Day scriptures were just being fulfilled here it was Christ was silent for 18 years and finally come into his ministry and so forth in his 30s and but yet when it come down to that crunch time it was an urgent matter because crucifixion was the next phase it was time for scriptures to be fulfilled oh H and brother we are coming on to the Resurrection The oh is now the dead in Christ are getting ready to raise up the scriptures have need to be fulfilled there must be a people people in the land today who God could put his hand on who under their Messenger will be their final voice to the final age and by and through the bride every promise every scripture will be fulfilled oh hallelujah oh there is a people this morning oh I believe I'm looking at them tonight we are looking at them today of people in the land the take up their rightful place take up the mantle of responsibility that God has left for us Elijah is gone but the spirit of Elisha uh Elijah is getting ready to rest upon Elisha God's Great understudy and the bride is going to come right in there and take up that same spirit and do the same works that was done when the prophet was here Prophet says what we've work in US small measure it's going to be here in his fullness when that time comes do you believe it amen oh I was on this scripture wow I better hurry because time is going but I'm having fun this morning amen praise God we enjoying the word amen but there's a few things I want to get to let's just hurry along now amen so the he loved the whole world right not just one person but the whole world he gave so God so Lov the world that he gave it's an action word he gave love gives you can't give without loving isn't that right but you can hardly love without giving and if you really love then you're going to give isn't that right if you if you're going to give of your time and so forth like that you give what you can love makes you do something amen about it it's not just you talk about love or or an idea of love some some people are in love with the idea of love but that's not what we're talking about we we're not talking about speaking lovely the truth but speaking the truth in love amen isn't that right that's the condition we going to come in isn't that right Hallelujah so not only did God give but he gave his only begotten son God gave his only his only begotten son uh God in flesh to die for the sins of man and that whosoever whosoever anybody in here this morning anybody around the world wherever you are can come and take of the Water of Life freely the fountain is open to all isn't that right but would like to say God is not an English God he's not a Spanish God or or French God he he he he has the whole world in his hands and and anyone who can want to come and surrender themselves can be used of him one of my favorite quotes on the prophet is that God uses uh uh pennies sometimes when he was talking about lot being a silver dollar and uh uh uh I'm sorry uh Abraham being a silver dollar and he said lot was a penny but he did say slip in there he said God use his Penny sometimes he can use pennies in a penny way yes sir he could use silver dollar in a silver dollar way whatever you have he'll use don't don't don't think that what you have is too small God could use whatever you have even it's a penny Jesus said if you have faith like a mustard seed you could do something with that Faith this morning don't think it too small don't think it too strange God could still use what you have he asked Moses what's that you have in your hand and he said it was a rod and God said throw down that rod and that rod turned into a snake and he began to work wonders with a old dead rod that's been around about 40 years Moses didn't even know that rod could do that but in God's hand Anything Can Happen God could use a rod to lead two and a half million people out of the hands of the overlord pharaoh who think he's so big and bad oh Hal but when God takes a hold of somebody God could use them to upset nature to turn the whole world upside down to break the back of the enemy off of God's people off of your life whatever you have this morning God wants to use if you're willing to give yourself over to God oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right and all that feel they so big and bad they haven't met God yet I heard a saying one time he said everybody is a bad man until the Cockroach start to fly and then we see who's bad a lot of stuff was happening in Egypt but God had a man ready seasoned out 40 years in the desert Hallelujah seasoned out all of his thinking all of his intellect all his education all what he know he was just reduced to love he was just reduced to humility he was just reduced he is a man with phds with his master's uh in science and and and astrological study of the day of Egypt but yet yet he had to Humble himself he said I can't talk and God said don't worry I'll get Aon to talk for you but you're going down there because my people need to be delivered oh Hallelujah and God's people need to be delivered today think it not strange that you are in the hands of almighty God God's going to bring you out and raise you up for such a time as this amen so whosoever will come and Believe on him will have everlasting life they shall not perish that's a promise in the word but you'll have everlasting lifeall amen and amen hallelujah so we're talking about the love of God right Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 13 says do I speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not charity I become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol it's insignificant it's it's just a a voice in the wind it's here in one moment and and by the even tide it's gone it perishes with it isn't that right like David said amen he said and though I I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and know a other stuff isn't that right and do I have all Faith so that I could move mountains and have not charity this this love of God I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profited me nothing charity suffered long and is kind charity Envy it not charity vaunt it not itself it doesn't parade its beef it is not puffed up amen it doesn't get swell-headed Hallelujah it doesn't think itself higher than others isn't that right but it it doesn't show up to get things it shows up to give Hallelujah isn't that right oh doesn't behave itself seemingly doesn't get all crazy he that believe it shall not make haste it seeketh not her own it is not easily provoked it think it no evil it rejoices not in iniquity but it rejoices in the truth it loves truth because it knows that truth will set the thing free oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh it rejoices in God's truth oh Hallelujah not misinformation not misinterpretation but the truth amen you shall have the truth and the truth is going to set you free isn't that right it beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and it endureth all things that's that's that's all things that's not some things this love of God beareth all things endureth all things believe it unto all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away so we're not in this thing for the tongues all right we're not in this thing for the prophecies yes we know that when the Revival comes there'll be great outpouring upon the bride and these signs are going to follow them that believe but s we would see Jesus that's what we're about it's not about great signs and wonders and miracles but it's who can take that word who could live that word who could because you have to have it in order to give it what are you going to give if you don't have you got to have something that this world knows nothing about that will defeat the enemy anytime anywhere any place under any condition oh and that love has got to project itself and manifest something isn't that right oh we know in part and prophesy in part hallu but that when that which is perfect is come and that which is in part will be done away 1 Peter 4:8 says and above all things have fervent charity amongst yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins oh we believe it this morning amen from the Seal of the Antichrist I'll read this quickly no matter how much you join churches uh no matter said no matter you might join churches shake hands with pastors put your name on the books and all those things are good Paul said why though I speak with the tongue of men and angels though I have wisdom and understand all the knowledge of God though I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice though I do all these things I am still nothing that's right but he said where there is tongues they shall cease where there's knowledge it shall vanish where there's prophecies it'll fail but when love has come the prophet said it'll endure forever he said and now what the church the Pentecostal church needs tonight along with all the other churches is a good oldfashioned baptizing of the Holy Ghost and love that will make you straighten up and get together and come together like brothers and sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ and break down these walls of partition amen where there is love God is love and love suffers long love is not provoked it's not puffed up he said when you get puffed up love is gone and where there's all this malice and strife and wars and envy and so forth against each other brother God just moves out that's all and it's a fact he said you can see it amen and now you've got the right Road brother you've got the right path but what you need is to come back together again for an oldfashioned auua Street meeting yes sir where the men and women will come together in all denominations and break down their barriers and recognize one another as brothers and sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen and amen so fill your love is that realm we live in every day isn't that right so I believe that there's something that has to happen to break in on us amen in order to break us out into this love of God that we talking about something has to raise us up amen above fil Your Love raise us up above our ordinary way of seeing things that's right and of seeing each other am in this three-dimensional space something has to be above that right a dimension above that above our perspective and I believe this morning I happy love is that Dimension above us oh and to get up in there God's going to release a spirit among the bride in the last days to give her the ability to step into that realm to step into that place the prophet said we hardly have faith for Divine Healing we need a faith more than we've ever known to enter into that place and Faith work it by love oh what faith work it by forgiveness oh hallelujah hallelujah oh and only the bride could enter into there oh may God Inspire us to raise us up to get into that place as we see the day approaching am amen and amen oh my a higher Force this love a higher purpose this love it's in a higher realm we've got to be able to love the way God loves we got to able to see each other the way God sees each other and not the way we see ourselves and not the way we see other people because we filter everything by our own experience we tend to filter everything by our own idea our own opinion our own thinking man's filter oh Hallelujah but we got to have God's filter oh Hallelujah we got to be able to see it the way God sees it oh Hallelujah be able to love the way God loves oh Hallelujah not in a filar way but a love that goes past what we are past who we are isn't that right amen God put a seed in our soul because he loves us we love him because he first love us Psalms 91:14 says uh because he had set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him and I will set him on high talking about you this morning because he had known my name and he shall call upon me and I will answer him ask what you will and it shall be done unto you when you begin to get into this love you can ask what you will the prophet asked what he will and it happened we're going to get it oh hallelujah praise God and I will answer him and I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him isn't that right so we believe this morning it takes the spirit of God to produce this true brotherly kindness Spirit of forgiveness a literal spirit that comes upon you and makes you choose to love instead to love instead of hate amen and to forgive instead of of holding an art or a grudge isn't that right oh my I believe God will do it isn't that right it they're going to come a point in time when all human element will go out all of we what we are will be boiled trashed out oh that crystal clear water is going to boil the trash out of the Rock Box the confession is there but what we need is a boiling out of the trash praise God all the stuff that got left behind all the lint and all the feathers and all this dross and animosity and strife and things that happened years ago that just piled up and isn't that right we're going to have a house cleaning time amen amen long time you're looking at the dirt in the corner time to pick up your broom this morning long time you're looking at that stuff laying around there it's been piling up a long time but it's time to get that broom we got to find what we have lost oh s is this the time for the bride to have a mighty Revival for the bride to finally find brotherly kindness holy decency place in Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory glory amen oh my statue of a perfect man the prophet said then sixthly let's add the Bible said here add brotherly kindness Brotherly Love brotherly kindness now that's a good one right here the six then seven all right he said add in brotherly kindness all right he said when we get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter amen talking about that brother isn't that right put yourself in his place on the matter that's what the prophet defines it as here and he says now say now you say my brother sinned against me said Peter shall I forgive him he said seven times a day day he said 70 * 7 see uh because the Jews they they operating with laws like do this three times do this do this five times and and and if it's five times we cut off point we we we take an action after five so so Peter wants to know how when we're going to take action what number we need a number we we operate him by the laws of Moses I for an I so I ready to dig out for time you say if you say it's after seven by the eth we dig in and Jesus said no 70 * 7 isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah it's impossible to reach that number but he's trying to make a point Hallelujah that it's without limit a it's more than you could number take whatever it have and multiply it seven by 70 times that is how much God wants you to love that's how much God wants you to forgive that's how much God want you to obey his word there's no number whatever number you have in your multiplied by 70 praise God amen amen hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory oh hallelujah amen 70 * 7 see brotherly kindness now you see now if a brother is All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see see just be kind to him go anyhow amen amen sometimes they're just not seeing sometimes that's not seeing it the way you seeing it you all always see eye to eye but the honey does stick the honey will stick uh uh when the when when that uh that dream sister shepher dream when the water pour in it couldn't hold in a rock Box it poured right out but the honey had to go in first and then the water could hold so the honey actually has a function that dream actually shows that the honey performs a function on the church in the last days and binds the whole thing together H isn't that right so that it could hold something isn't that right amen okay brotherly kindness now you see so if a Brother's all at a tune now don't be impatient with him see just be kind to him go go anyhow somebody said not long ago how can you be leave these things the way you do and still go to the Assemblies of God and the Oneness and all the rest then put see put brotherly kindness uh uh uh see and and see hoping someday see patient with him see temperent enduring with him see every virtue is living out now knowledge knowledge to understand what he means remembering that it is in his heart that's what it is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness virtue is going to sangwich it in there and it's going to go out with kindness with virtue with meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in amen that's the mindset that's the attitude isn't that right brotherly kindness the seven Thing 1 2 3 4 5 6 then seven the prophet Taps on the choke board seven times see seven thing then now you're coming into it see and then the next thing he said add charity which is love he said that's the capping Stone isn't that right amen amen and on this message here uh when love is projected Prophet said now to show how love is projected this is you now you might laugh at this but he said it's just true as I'm standing here hallelujah one time I was out in a field when I was in a game warden and there had been a bull that had been killed by a colored man and so forth in the brook you know the story great gesy Bull and he'd been sold away to another man and he just turned him loose into the pasture and I knew that bull was there but I never thought I was over on the creek you know turning some loose fish and so on I thought a man I thought of a man that called for me to go pray for him so going up across the hill to pray for the man being about right about 3 or 400 yards from the fence in a little clump of bushes this Gacy bull was bedded down there and I got close to him and and he raised up and he was a killer I looked back to the fence it was too far for me to run he was so close to me there was no tree for me to get into it so clearly the god allowed the prophet it to leave leave the prophet's mind um about this particular Bull and he said I thought and he thought the prophet said well I thought this is the end I can't go no further for if I try to run he'll catch me so what can I do he said and now that's when we come to these crisis that when Sovereign Grace steps in then something happen in my life the prophet said I wish it would if it ever comes again that it will never leave and I only wish that there was some way I had the power this morning to project this to this group of men and women here and that it never leave you oh he's talking about something now something that came upon him in that moment of Crisis a Spirit come upon him that he said he wish he could have it all the time he wished that it would never leave isn't that right something happened there he said oh you've often wondered I guess how these things happen it's something instead of despising that man is not right oh okay sorry let me go back here he was talking about uh that that Maniac guy in Oregon right he said like when that Maniac in Oregon he ran up to the platform to kill me he said many of you read that book something happened there so he's linking it now he said now you you you you've often wondered I guess how these things happen he said but it's it's something instead of despising that man though he was there to take my life a Divine love set in for him a Divine love something come upon the prophet a Spirit come in isn't that right and he called me a hypocrite he called me a snake in the grass and thousands of people sitting there and he spit in my face Drew back his fist and said I'll break every bone in your body people probably sitting here was there he said but instead of despising the man something grace came in in a moment when I needed it Grace sets in and projected a Divine love into my heart that I could project to him oh hallelujah hallelujah oh he was just standing there when something came true oh Divine love projected into him and it came out of the prophet and unto that man oh brother do you see it now we are just a conduit for the spirit of God to be used of us mightily oh that this Divine love could project itself into US oh do you see it how cleared out we have to be in order for that Divine love to project you can't have something blocking the lens it can be a smutty lens all messed up with ideas and opinions and and experiences and stuff and stuff and stuff you got to clear that out so that when that love that perfect white light goes through the lens of your heart there's no mix up there there's no there's no muddiness there but there's just a clean clear picture a clean Clear Channel oh Hallelujah that God's Divine love that God's perfect white light can flow through you and display every one of his virtues out will come Faith out will come virtue out will come knowledge out will come Temperance when it strikes that pyramid seven perfect colors will flash like lightning oh hallelujah hallelujah that's the season we're coming into now that's why we've got to clear everything out get everything out of the way cuz a Revival is coming and we want when that light comes it could project when that Divine love drops in it could project itself through US amen and to go out flow out like the prophet said flow out to others to help others along the way that's the whole purpose is not right the son of man didn't come to be ministered to they came to minister to help somebody and that's what the bride has got after have that same spirit amen praise God to reach back and help someone else isn't that right amen isn't that right okay where where am I at now he said now it it it Grace set in and projected a Divine love into my heart I love how he describes it so we get an idea now of how God is going to use us we are just in between we we we are just in between the process of God reaching the people God wants to use someone to get out that way isn't that right Hallelujah pray we're not in control God is in control and the more we surrender we just become a m members of the machine of his body but he is the Dynamics we are just the mechanics but he comes to work the mechanics his Dynamic power and sets this great machine into motion and then out comes love out comes forgiveness out comes healing out comes Deliverance amen that's what that's how it's supposed to work amen but we have to become members of this machine we have to be surrendered and honed enough to fit in our place every gear every wheel every Sprocket in its place so that it could function and serve the purpose that was meant to serve isn't that right is not right he said now Divine love projected say see he said there stands a man thinking about the man he's thinking about the maniac man while he's coming at him these are the thoughts that are going through the prophet's mind he said there stands a man a man like I am like I am he said he likes to eat and drink and his family but the devil has him bound and so the prophet said the love of God constrained me and the man humbled himself and fell across my feet the prophet said Grace steps in When Love was projected he said in the case of this bull that was trying to kill me he got up and his feet looked at me and he snorted about three or four times and throw his horns into the ground I looked around there was nothing as an officer I'm supposed to pack a gun and I wondered why I didn't have it I would have killed the bull and went and paid for it the prophet said but I had no gun and God seeing to it that I had no gun he wanted to show his divine grace in a crisis hour and something struck me way better than a gun or any weapon of this world it was the divine grace that took my heart and thinking of that animal look at again Watch he wanted to live the same way I wanted to live so we see a pattern here now every time the prophet begin to put himself in the place of the thing something begins to happen something going to take place it shift from the natural every time he put himself in his brother's place on the matter or put himself in the place of the thing or the animal or whatever it was something begin to shift in the Supernatural God begin to work on that what we need is a shift this morning a shift in our thinking a shift in our mindset that Divine love praise God could could could project itself and Grace could step in Grace not just for you but for your brother for your Fallen sister for for someone who may be struggling they say that hurt people hurt people it's because they are hurt is why they go around hurting others they themselves have hurts that have not been healed they themselves have wounds that have not been addressed sometimes someone might turn roughly to you but you don't know what's happening behind the curtain you don't know what's happening behind the scenes and if you would spend a day with them you might get a better picture of what they have to face and why in that moment praise God they might have done something that offended you we've got to think on a higher level praise God hallelujah isn't that right sometimes people just can't see amen they they they might claim to have eyes but they they're really not seeing where they going they they're not seeing that there's a better way they're not seeing that there's a more excellent way there's not seeing that there's a a better approach or that there's a better example to follow they're only going with what they think they know they only going where what they hope will work oh Hallelujah and we've got to intercede for them and pray for that brother pray for that sister that somehow by the grace of God God would open their eyes to see Elijah couldn't open gazi's eyes he G has he was frightened he he came and said I see the hosts around us and and I don't know what's going on and I'm frightened Elijah couldn't do it on his own he so he said Lord open this boy's eyes so that he could see what's really going on and and and and when God opened his eyes all of a sudden he saw something that that that he didn't see before he he saw Chariots of Fire he he saw Angelic hosts surrounding them there there was a big Army outside of the army that they saw there was a natural Army there but there's a supernatural Army this morning that's got your back oh hallelujah hallelujah amen amen there's more for us than there's against us but sometimes we just don't see these things we we walking around in the natural walking around in this filo love anointing with what we are familiar with uh and sometimes we fail to see and if God don't open our eyes uh we won't see the bigger picture but sometimes love has to do that love has to open us up to understand the bigger picture of what's going on God told job he said where was thou when I laid the foundations of the Earth when the morning Stars sang together when the sons of God shouted for Joy where were you you Hallelujah I am the god that is in charge of the seas in charge of the Sands in charge of the waters I set my decree that the water could go no further that the firmament of the heaven will be separated from the sea god is in charge of all these things and he's in charge of you this morning if God is running all these systems parallel and nothing is in each other's way or chaotic then there surely an intelligence behind all that and if the intelligence that is behind all that is going on surely you in your little situation God knows what's going on with you this morning he knows that you're going to come into your time come into your season and he's only testing you to see if you go all the way to see if you will take one more step forgetting all the things that are passed and press on to the the mark for the prize for the high calling in Christ Jesus amen amen and amen oh my see he he and said Grace stepped in When Love Was projected it was divine love that that took my heart see he said and instead of hating him hating the bull that was planning to take my life he said I loved him he said that sounds juvenile but it's the truth and as he rushed towards me I said creature of God I I am the servant of God I am on a legitimate call to a man who's dying and all Creator sent me and I'm sorry to disturb you out of your rest but in the name of he who created us both go over and lay down under the tree and when he got so close to me within 10 ft I was no more scared of that animal then that I would be of my brethren here this morning oh my love made it familiar oh love Bridge a gap Divine love Bridge a gap between him and this animal wow what an example he said and now uh come Divine love perfect love he said cast out all fear and he stopped and he he just looked so depleted he looked both ways he turned around walked over and laid down under that tree and I walked in three feet of him passed by through the field safely Prophet said when love is projected Divine Sovereign Grace of God takes a hold he said one day he was mowing his yard he's mowing in the front and he cut a few rounds and so forth he's talking about those bees he said I pulled off my shirt try to take a few more rounds while nobody was at the house way down in the corner of the fence I forgot that there was a hornet nest down there and I ran this electric mow into the fence and it shook those Hornets me with no shirt on and and you know what Hornets are and they were all over me just in a second very angry one of them can kill you sting in the head in the top of the head and so forth isn't that right and so in that crisis in that moment he said when I was standing helpless then Sovereign Grace took a hold and something happened oh May Sovereign Grace take a hold here this morning we need that to sweep in make all the wrongs right cover a multitude of sins sweep away the Refuge of Lies We need that to sweep in love for your brother love for your Fallen sister love that removes all the lines and sees the truth that we are all God's children we might be a little messed up all of us are messed up and bent up and twisted up in some ways all of us need Jesus we all need the Lord people need the Lord my mother needs the Lord my father needs the Lord Lord my brother my sister my wife my children my family we all need Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he is able to supply all our needs according to his riches and Glory he's able to straighten us out to help us give us the right Spirit give us the right attitude oh Hallelujah so that Divine love could could have its perfect work amen I'm in among Our Lives isn't that right Grace took a hold and something happen he said and as kiddish as it may seem I love those little creatures and and they I thought they were in their nest God in his wisdom he put them there for some purpose and they were in their nest and I Disturbed them oh my see bring out humility right here's the mindset and they come they never come disturbing me he said I disturb them and I said little creatures of God I am the servant of God and I'm trying to pray for his sick children I've got to mow my grass and I Disturbed you and I'm sorry I did this and I love you and if you mean it'll work you can't fool a bee Prophet said if you can fool or be how much more a man you got to have what you are talking about you have have to know in other words it can't be a fake love it can't be a put on love it's got to be real what you say and what's in your heart must be in alignment and then something happens he said I said little creatures of God go back into your nest and watch and I I'll not disturb you anymore covered with hornets and as I have to meet God at the day of judgment and you people he said those Hornets swarmed two or three times and took one and one took a beline and every one of them went right back in the nest in the name of Jesus Christ by the grace of conquering love amen amen hallelujah we believe it hallelujah amen my amen so I read those situations to just show us a picture all right that the prophet actively when this Divine love come down that's right something happened it shifted the mindset amen shifted the attitude shifted the way he saw it you would normally see it like that but when it come to the crisis hour when it come to the the the the Press oh Hall when it come to the final hour when it is needed the most the bride is going to have something that will be able to project the spirit and the bride will be able to say come when it come to that crisis hour brother that crisis hour is coming very soon the wheels are already started to turn what is set in Motion in this world cannot be undone oh the vision is about to come to pass but before that Vision a bride is going to come into view and when the crisis arrives oh Hallelujah when it's needed the most oh watch that turd pull then you watch that bride step out on display with love with brotherly kindness on her chest with the blood for the age oh because the devil know if they ever get to brotherly kindness we are finished if we ever get to forgiveness if we ever learn to forgive our brothers we are finished oh but he is finished this morning oh hallelujah it's love that slays that giant oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah amen amen amen glory hallelujah oh so in each one of these situations the prophet recalls something happened isn't that right Divine love took a whole amen what is it it's the law of grace and grace is unmar favor undeserved we didn't deserve it but Grace stepped in we just supposed to die we were supposed to die to death oh that Christ died on the cross we were supposed to hang on that cross but ver he said no I'll not let you go I'll not let you die oh I'll take your place and God provided a sacrifice God provided a substitute for our sins oh I ought to be the happiest man in the world that God reached down his hand for me I was lost and undone oh without God and his son when he reached down his hand for me he reached down his hand for you therefore I ought to love you the way that Christ love you because he loved me and he loved you oh hallelujah hallelujah oh if we walk in the light we have Fellowship in the light and we love one another oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen oh my the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin oh my Prophet said we've got to have something common to Fellowship about and the blood of God the blood of Jesus makes a common ground upon which we can say there is my brother Hallelujah there is my sister we can shake hands on that Common Ground the blood brings us all down to one level rich or poor bonded or free don't care how much money you have in your pocket you'd be lost without Jesus I'd be lost without Jesus and if God could forgive me oh in my rotness in my selfishness in my in my undeserved state then how much more could I love you how much more I ought to love you if he loved me that much oh Hallelujah and if he forgave me that much oh hallelujah how ought I we to love one another because love is of God Amen and amen so when Divine love projects Sovereign Grace takes his place oh I think we Struck it now amen wonderful let's just kind of see if you could wind down here now oh it's been wonderful isn't that right my so there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus makes us free from the law of sin and death for what the law couldn't do it was that it was weak through the flesh God send in his own son and the likeness of sinful flesh for sin condemned sin in the flesh so that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit isn't that right so on Blasphemous names wanted to touch on that dream real quick he said but what this man who was pouring the water the messenger to the church Prophet is interpreting the dream he said the messenger to the church was the man pouring the water pouring the message into the church but what was the water doing it was boiling out all the trash that was in it Hallelujah he said that's what the Holy Spirit does boils it up now now the honey represented Brotherly Love brotherly kindness which is this age he said I've got just got through telling see of Brotherly kindness the age that we live in now now you might say now I look I sure don't like brother Neville or I sure don't like brother Jones or I don't like brother so and so and something like that he said but just let something happen to him brother your heart is broke it just nearly killed you see we can obtain brotherly kindness and a feeling one for another see but to maintain in a group of people he said so so now why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him he had the altar as you will tonight you you fellowship with him you shook his hands you worshiped with him he's your brother and he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with because you just kind of say well you know which you ought not to do and maybe you might shun him a little but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it would just nearly kill you or that sister he said he said I'm an old man I was once young now I'm old Prophet said and I've seen it down through the age I've seen it do that people hear hear people say I won't have no more to do with him and then something happened to that man it nearly kills him he thinks oh God I let my precious brother go oh it's it's real amen without making friends with him you see see it's brotherly love it look like it won't stick but it does stick the honey it sticks it sticks oh hallelujah it's going to stick oh hallelujah hallelujah it's got to stick that's what it does amen that's what the honey will do this brotherly kindness is getting ready to pour out upon us it's going to stick now in so much that she came from here down the hill to the bottom of the hill now this glorious water was gushing over the hills in five streams and he said now five is a number of Grace JS us f a i t h g r a c e c five is the number of Grace five streams are was pouring up out here at the trough uh uh down through here he said that each one of these ages had that rock confession the Saints are sleeping he said they're waiting waiting waiting see Hallelujah sorry excuse me waiting see until this age he said but soon the Holy Ghost being poured out from Christ will come and will seal up the church and then the church will be raptured it'll be a complete unit of God a bride for Christ that's what we're coming into Now isn't that right who will be the head of all things he said You Follow Me Now congregation says amen said now she was wondering now in Her Dream she was wondering with this little stream would this stream ever get to the bottom see it was drying up now being that she herself she said now here's what I want to get to you now she herself was wondering about herself did she have the Holy Ghost and he said now I Shan in saying this a few minutes ago he said thinking the church would be spiritual enough and so on he said but watch he said now he said but you could speak with tongues you could shout you could dance you could cast out devils and do anything you want to do and still not have the Holy Ghost didn't them disciples come back rejoicing and shouting because the devils are subject to them did not Jesus say in that day when he come that many will come to me and say Lord have I not cast out devils in your name done Mighty works and I'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity I didn't know you those things are not indication of the Holy Spirit by he said by their fruit you shall know them he said but now you say brother brandom do we should we speak inong absolutely that is gifts of God but those gifts of God without these virtues in them makes a stumbling block to the unbeliever it is not accepted by godall this has to be first and when you have faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance patience godliness and brotherly love then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit the musician can get get to come up now amen and same as he seals the church ages as a unit the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual they're made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam's side isn't that right here is the things that you have to have first you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them they've got to be God's oh that's why we say it can be a human Temperance or a human patience it's got to be God sent and God born imitation he said only causes confusion sir he said it's like I said you could imagine seeing a buzzard setting here with a dove feather stuck in his wings and say see I'm a dove he said but he's not a dove he's a buzzard vulture see could you imagine some black bird with a peacock feather saying I'm a peacock he said that's just something he stuck in see but it has to come from the inside out and it produces this produces Christianity God by the power of the Holy Spirit and he said and here now now get this lesson here's what's wrong he said when I turn on this here's what's wrong with brandom Tabernacle yeah he says it here he said you see there's two different kinds of Faith there's two different kinds of virtue and I had it the other day two different kinds of knowledge two different kind of temperance one thinks it's prohibition that they got staining from from alcohol and stuff like that he said but that's not the kind of temperance that God's talking about it's that ungodly uncontrollable temper you got and things of that side fast back fast and so forth like that patience and so forth he said there's a mockery of it a pretending to be a nature given Faith a nature given virtue there's a nature given Temperance all these things are nature given and the biggest part of our faith is mental feate by hearing the word it bring us into a mental recognition of God see all of this is is human you see isn't that right and but he said but if this coming from above he said oh brother if it ever strikes this he said then there's a Godly spiritual fate then what does that Faith do that Faith recognizes only the word oh it won't recognize anything else but the word of God whatever God says that when it strikes that it will only recognize the word what did he say she will have thus sayeth the Lord or she'll keep still when these virtues are in her oh she'll produce Christ oh Hallelujah she'll walk with god oh hallelujah hallelujah she'll move when he moves she'll act when she'll act Spirit of his Spirit oh flesh of his flesh isn't that right the word made flesh oh I'm getting ready to wind out now amen oh you've been wonderful praise God Amen so let me finish this up here nowah he said it it gets a Godly Faith that's what the faith do it only recognize the word no matter what anything else says it only recognizes the word because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God Amen and the Word was God and the word is still God Amen and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental Faith becomes a spiritual Revelation and upon this Foundation I'll build my church see not upon a mental conception of church joining a mental conception of that but upon the Revelation when them streams of Grace has poured into that mental faith that you've got then upon this a spiritual Revelation he said I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it see that shows that they would be against it but it'll never Prevail oh what a glorious thing now we see that fith coming in isn't that right oh Hallelujah glory to God the prophet said I'm perfect Faith you could please some softly faith is based on forgiveness then and as we said here this morning we're trying to get the church into a place where we could really see Apostolic times moving Among Us that's what we all hunger for and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we want it to flow such a flow that it'll help us that it will flow out to others isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen do you love him oh H one more quote here and we'll just close out with this on Elijah the prophet said now everybody wants to be loved I tell you the truth I do I want God to love me I want the people to love me that's exactly the truth he said and if God loves me then the people will love me and if I love his people then he will love me for doing it God would rather I love you than love him did you know that I'd rather you love my boy back there no matter what you say about me I want you to love my children any father would think that and so father God thinks the same thing he said in so much as you have done to the least of these my little ones you have did it unto me and so if you want to love God just start loving all of his children you could begin to stand and God will reward you if you just love his children that show that the love of God is in you Jesus said that's the way that all the people ought to know that you're the children of God and pass from Death onto life when you have loved one for another then you'll know it not because you have a big church that's all right but just because you you have lot of fine ministers come by that's good too but it's because you have love one for another may God richly bless you this morning I'm finished amen and divine love projects Sovereign Grace
