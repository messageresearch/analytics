[38:28] we appreciate that and uh this is from
[38:32] the seventh seal this is brother brown i
[38:35] remember
[38:36] i think it was uh this is the time
[38:41] but lebron gave a dream one of the
[38:43] brothers had a dream
[38:45] and it was connected with a pyramid
[38:48] and he's taken a crowbar ripping it off
[38:50] and then he was telling the brethren
[38:51] look on this
[38:52] he rip it off and he was interpreting
[38:54] the writing outside and then
[38:56] he said light not never shown it before
[38:58] there was part of the whole package
[39:00] and so on like that now this is on the
[39:01] seventh seal he said
[39:03] and on that dream too um he told the
[39:06] veteran look on it
[39:07] but they were looking at him instead of
[39:09] looking at what he tell them to do
[39:11] he said very few were looking on what he
[39:13] said to look on this
[39:14] i was in something in the pyramid but
[39:17] all the other virgins look and say where
[39:18] did he go where did he go
[39:19] where did he go where did he go and they
[39:20] were looking after him see and that's
[39:22] what end up happening instead of looking
[39:24] at the pyramid
[39:24] they're looking everywhere else praise
[39:26] the name of the lord but but
[39:28] there are some people who keep looking
[39:29] on this that
[39:31] like he said all right so then he was
[39:33] talking about this in the seventh seal
[39:35] he said notice the next thing i took
[39:36] some kind of back cut it off
[39:38] on the inside was a white rock that had
[39:40] nothing wrote in it and
[39:42] at that time i started to go west and i
[39:44] told them don't go out west
[39:46] stay here and look on this until i
[39:48] returned
[39:49] and went west for the blast return back
[39:51] to the east with the holy spirit
[39:53] interpreting the unwritten word
[39:56] now if that isn't perfectly the god
[39:59] almighty i don't know what is
[40:00] what i am trying to say this
[40:04] for friends is to show you
[40:07] we are at the end time and if
[40:10] them others is perfectly on dot with the
[40:13] word

[40:28] just keep climbing with the coronavirus
[40:30] because of
[40:31] poor leadership bad management and
[40:33] there's debt everywhere
[40:35] but that is nothing compared to what's
[40:36] going to happen he said
[40:38] millions will lose their lives millions
[40:41] will be
[40:42] and now believe that they are saved and
[40:44] will be counted further
[40:46] for the atomic age we are living at the
[40:48] last hour
[40:49] and by the grace of almighty god by his

[41:49] o glory to god hallelujah he said i
[41:52] am not he will implant i'm speaking i am
[41:54] his servant
[41:56] and the pillar fire is not he it's in
[41:58] spirit form
[42:00] which was upon the son of man and has
[42:03] come now to anoint sons of man
[42:05] purpose to bring back a ministry
[42:08] just exactly like he said it would be in
[42:11] order
[42:12] for the head and the rest of the body to
[42:14] connect together
[42:16] just like the pyramid has enoch built we
[42:18] find in that pyramid they never did get
[42:20] the headstone on it why
[42:21] the headstone is yet to come the seven
[42:23] steps in the pyramid
[42:25] we will go to that someday now you
[42:26] notice american dollar
[42:28] the great headstone the seal notice back
[42:31] there in egypt those stones are laying
[42:33] they are so perfect
[42:34] at the top and the top the stone is like
[42:38] a great big diamond and that stone could
[42:40] not fit down there at the bottom of the
[42:41] foundation
[42:42] it will not fit on the second foundation
[42:44] or the tilt foundation it will only fit
[42:46] on the top foundation
[42:48] so he was saying these stones will only
[42:50] fit on the top foundation
[42:52] he said abraham faith isn't that right
[42:54] hallelujah isaac love jacob grace
[42:56] pentecostal and julia fort perfection
[42:59] the capstone word
[43:00] so on top that word and that word that
[43:02] slab is brotherly kindness
[43:04] and between brundly kindness and love is
[43:07] that holy spirit slot
[43:09] and you tonight have to believe that you
[43:13] are called
[43:14] to be one of them stones to be fitted
[43:17] in that holy spirit slot because that is
[43:20] what christ is coming for

[43:24] at the end of the pentecostal age
[43:26] to introduce a bright age which is a
[43:29] hidden mystery

[56:19] oh god do you get that it was god
[56:22] almighty
[56:23] it was the open door there was no
[56:25] messenger there
[56:26] god slammed it open
[56:32] he said it was the open door and the
[56:34] holy ghost come to that door
[56:36] no man was in control of that it was
[56:38] divine power
[56:39] it was divine unction it was the holy
[56:42] ghost sweeping
[56:43] healing delivering baptizing speaking in
[56:46] tongues
[56:46] supernatural piano playing all kind of
[56:49] manifestation
[56:50] it was god almighty but what we are
[56:53] promised
[56:54] is god himself the word in you
[56:57] being dominated by the spirit itself
[57:01] in the holy spirit's shot oh give the
[57:04] lord i
[57:04] shout god does using man using the word
[57:07] he put in man
[57:10] what's the secret the word is in the
[57:13] bride go give the lord a shout
[57:15] the pentecostal can't claim that because
[57:17] they are shocked
[57:18] but the word is in you deceiving you
[57:22] what happened son of man come son of man
[57:24] is always his shower
[57:26] son of man brings seed that was a
[57:28] prophet bring he brings seed
[57:29] he couldn't release court could release
[57:31] dynamics where we look back to
[57:32] pentecostal again with all the life
[57:34] without the token with all the holy
[57:36] ghost without the word with all the
[57:37] mechanics
[57:38] we've been back to pentecost again with
[57:40] a kind of half waiting
[57:41] so god put the word as a seed and say
[57:44] hold that
[57:45] hallelujah die out to that die out to
[57:48] yourself to your flesh
[57:49] i'll cross jordan oh hallelujah
[57:54] glory to god so then
[57:58] you become god's tabernacle or god's
[58:00] house
[58:01] oh here brother branham and there's a
[58:03] man i could tell you what is it just
[58:05] like the pyramid message you see
[58:06] keeping right up this way into the
[58:08] minority with the headstone
[58:10] the ministry of jesus christ
[58:13] oh let me i'll back up a little bit he
[58:16] said when a man in a phone just making a
[58:17] bell
[58:18] he's got to have a certain tone to put
[58:21] in it
[58:22] and when he is setting his mole and
[58:24] pouring his iron he puts so much brass
[58:27] so much steel so much copper
[58:30] he knows just exactly how much to put in
[58:33] to give it the right tone
[58:35] and that is what jesus has done to his
[58:37] bride he put in so much looter
[58:40] so much methodist so much presbyterian
[58:43] so much pentecost in it what does he
[58:45] come up with his own perfection
[58:48] so you can eliminate justification and
[58:50] signification but you kind of limited
[58:51] all the other things that's what make up
[58:53] the tone
[58:55] if you don't have the ingredients you
[58:56] can get ping
[58:58] when you bear supposed to paint your
[59:00] belgian pong
[59:02] so for you to get the ping you haven't
[59:04] got so much of copper
[59:06] so much a method so much at this so much
[59:08] i'd like to hit get the right note
[59:10] are you with me you say what is it just
[59:12] like the proven message you see
[59:14] it's heaping right up come to minority
[59:16] with the headstone
[59:18] the ministry of jesus christ on earth
[59:21] has to be here we go the same
[59:24] he had or he can't come to it
[59:28] he is saying they have to be i'll say
[59:31] this way
[59:32] i see what the prophecy i i always say
[59:34] with prophecy
[59:35] it has to be a reproduction of the
[59:38] original grain
[59:41] bringing back the same ministry that
[59:43] jesus had so jesus have to see his own
[59:47] ministry
[59:49] in the church isn't that something
[59:52] does not give me then not come join and
[59:54] read here and rewrite that that you know
[59:57] they know that at all watch
[1:00:01] it has to be the same minute as he had
[1:00:04] or he can't come to it
[1:00:08] he said just like head to feet the feet
[1:00:11] is not the head
[1:00:12] but the head packs the feet you get it
[1:00:15] was he was a great light
[1:00:16] he said yes sir no the dirty rags of
[1:00:19] yesterday
[1:00:20] no it just become dirty rags all the
[1:00:23] time it serves its purpose as clothing
[1:00:26] now it becomes paper justification
[1:00:28] service time
[1:00:30] on the looter then it had to become
[1:00:32] signification to wesley
[1:00:33] sanctification saves time till it
[1:00:35] becomes the baptism holy ghost
[1:00:36] and the baptismal ego service time until
[1:00:39] the holy spirit
[1:00:40] which is only one god now yeah they told
[1:00:43] me use now
[1:00:44] one god blends into the church
[1:00:48] and the church into christ and it makes
[1:00:52] jesus christ reflected on the earth as
[1:00:54] he promised you in the bible
[1:00:56] so he's talking about blending now
[1:00:58] remember we're going to we say we're
[1:00:59] going to take up those words blend
[1:01:00] and honed so now the holy spirit has to
[1:01:03] come
[1:01:04] to blend into the church
[1:01:09] oh yes blender egg i don't beat it
[1:01:13] you don't just drop an egg and you get
[1:01:14] blended
[1:01:16] whisk it so if god had to blend the holy
[1:01:20] spirit he has to do some whisking
[1:01:24] i don't care how long it takes
[1:01:28] if you don't want this with skin to me
[1:01:30] you don't want to blend
[1:01:32] because afterwards you have to be
[1:01:33] blending with the anointing
[1:01:35] then the anointing becomes part of you
[1:01:37] and part of it
[1:01:39] you can live without it is part of your
[1:01:40] life part of your walk your
[1:01:43] talk holiness becomes part of your
[1:01:45] rhythm part of your speech
[1:01:46] your action your attitude your life
[1:01:52] my my mind now what she always say here
[1:01:55] now
[1:01:58] the church constantly getting the
[1:01:59] minority with greater powers
[1:02:01] when the enemy become like a flood based
[1:02:03] on the sign of the time new york
[1:02:05] the enemy raises the standard when this
[1:02:07] when the enemy come like a flood rather
[1:02:09] the spirit of god would raise a standard
[1:02:10] against it no
[1:02:12] we have left the pentecostal age i guess
[1:02:14] this is
[1:02:15] prophecy present now we are coming
[1:02:19] to where like in the pyramid not pyramid
[1:02:21] doctrine now
[1:02:22] but i mean like as the permit the
[1:02:24] headstone
[1:02:26] when it comes to fit it's got to be
[1:02:29] honed there's got to be a ministry in
[1:02:33] the
[1:02:34] church the true church of the living god
[1:02:36] to where
[1:02:37] when the headstone comes christ
[1:02:41] or the ministry of christ will fit right
[1:02:43] in together
[1:02:44] then that brings back the redeemed
[1:02:48] to take the whole house of god to glory
[1:02:50] the methodist the baptist but
[1:02:52] through the great revelations that come
[1:02:54] out and give their lives and persecution
[1:02:55] and things for the kingdom of god but
[1:02:56] that stone is coming
[1:02:58] so in other words you say we must come
[1:03:00] to perfection to bring the resurrection
[1:03:02] that is true
[1:03:03] but remember christ does all three the
[1:03:06] shout
[1:03:07] the voice and the trump is not pastor
[1:03:10] teacher evans is doing that
[1:03:11] it's christ doing all three he produced
[1:03:14] a shout
[1:03:15] he produced a voice he produced the
[1:03:18] trump
[1:03:19] isn't that right but they got to have a
[1:03:20] ministry christ's own spirit in the
[1:03:23] church
[1:03:23] that he could come down and blend into
[1:03:25] it to do that
[1:03:27] all glory to god that's why we've got to
[1:03:29] come to perfection
[1:03:31] hallelujah that last step and that's
[1:03:33] where we continue from the last service
[1:03:35] last wednesday oh glory to god are you
[1:03:37] with me now
[1:03:38] he said under luther was the same holy
[1:03:40] spirit justification then signification
[1:03:42] then about the holy spirit he said not
[1:03:44] three steps of grace
[1:03:46] but three stations notice when a baby is
[1:03:48] born
[1:03:49] they are treating that constitutes a
[1:03:50] birth is not right
[1:03:52] water blood and spirit the elements that
[1:03:56] come from his body
[1:03:57] to make his body it comes from his body
[1:04:00] is the material to make his bride
[1:04:02] so water blood spirit is the material
[1:04:06] to make the bride not word only
[1:04:10] no no no don't come with that don't try
[1:04:13] that
[1:04:14] don't try that it's easy because you
[1:04:15] study long it's easy because you study
[1:04:17] hard
[1:04:18] but there's that you see men just
[1:04:21] go against the spirit because the spirit
[1:04:24] does put them out of control
[1:04:29] jesus said when the spirit is come he
[1:04:31] will guide you
[1:04:32] into all truth so it must take man out
[1:04:35] of the way
[1:04:36] because the spirit is what taken the
[1:04:37] whole love oh glory to god
[1:04:40] i meant the one that become men want to
[1:04:41] be in church but god sent the holy ghost
[1:04:43] to be in church
[1:04:45] oh glory to god holy ghost two gifted
[1:04:47] men holy ghost true men god using men
[1:04:50] people think i you believe god has used
[1:04:51] men no no no god of jews man
[1:04:53] holy ghost using men oh hallelujah but
[1:04:56] the man spirit
[1:04:57] is defending all together i spirit a man
[1:04:59] trying to dominate the church
[1:05:01] that's nicolet and spirit now my spirit
[1:05:03] conquered the laity
[1:05:04] by mental and intellectual and demonic
[1:05:07] and political power
[1:05:08] oh glory to god and we get delivered
[1:05:10] over that the church the church get
[1:05:11] busted god
[1:05:12] god come to redeem you after that and he
[1:05:14] said this will never go back into that
[1:05:16] they will mind handle church but never
[1:05:18] the bribe every bright member will be
[1:05:20] delivered by the spirit of the living
[1:05:21] god
[1:05:22] because you you come from god oh glory
[1:05:25] you come from that
[1:05:26] you come from that source hallelujah you
[1:05:28] come from that element that where your
[1:05:30] gene belong
[1:05:32] oh no pastor hole in your gene that's
[1:05:34] nonsense no pastor of the key to your
[1:05:36] life that is foolishness
[1:05:37] or give the lord a shout the god who
[1:05:40] call you is able to
[1:05:41] the one that started working you is able
[1:05:43] to finish it
[1:05:44] and i challenge you to see any pastor
[1:05:46] starting with you that's a lie
[1:05:48] it's god that stopped the work in you
[1:05:50] the same one that called you i don't
[1:05:52] care what conditioning
[1:05:53] he called you out to that for what
[1:05:55] purpose to be jacob grace
[1:05:57] no they committed to the perfection that
[1:05:59] the holy ghost could strike his soul
[1:06:02] hallelujah upon that thought foundation
[1:06:05] oh give the lord a shout hallelujah
[1:06:08] hallelujah
[1:06:09] and when christ died there was three
[1:06:11] elements that came out of his body
[1:06:14] water blood and spirit justification to
[1:06:16] believe in water
[1:06:18] signification through the blood and the
[1:06:20] baptism holy spirit
[1:06:22] and here we go and this is where we
[1:06:23] closed off last week
[1:06:25] now this last great step must come to
[1:06:28] perfection
[1:06:29] that the holy spirit ah has to live in
[1:06:32] the church
[1:06:33] so perfectly do you get it tonight
[1:06:36] that's the holy spirit's shirt come
[1:06:38] along and walk on brotherly kindness
[1:06:40] no brotherly kindness to the holy spirit
[1:06:42] or give the lord a shout
[1:06:44] my god hell i could run out of the
[1:06:46] church right now
[1:06:47] i could run around the building and come
[1:06:49] back up now no
[1:06:50] brotherly kindness the holy spirit when
[1:06:53] you stand praying for the holy ghost
[1:06:55] when you stand praying for charity when
[1:06:58] you stand praying for that super
[1:06:59] anointed
[1:07:00] forgive
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:06] forgive me
[1:07:11] to see that
[1:07:22] when brother branham was condemning the
[1:07:23] woman in the restaurant and got tapping
[1:07:25] on his shoulder and said i forgive
[1:07:26] yourself look you condemn her
[1:07:29] and he had to go and repent and he got a
[1:07:31] woman restored when the people was
[1:07:33] making love in church
[1:07:34] and rosemary drop down and tell him that
[1:07:36] that whatever you say will happen
[1:07:37] and he said i forgive you and he said
[1:07:40] hold me was please
[1:07:42] because you see he had to show god's
[1:07:43] kindness the way
[1:07:45] god does think the way god does feel
[1:07:48] they call the woman and adultery and
[1:07:50] said this one was caught in the very act
[1:07:51] and the lord wanted moses toner and
[1:07:54] jesus said which one among you without
[1:07:56] sin
[1:07:56] cast the first stone and jesus himself
[1:07:59] had no sin that he didn't curse
[1:08:01] all empty believe he said here do i
[1:08:02] condemn thee go and sin no more
[1:08:05] who could do that by the power of love
[1:08:07] who could do that by the spirit of
[1:08:08] forgiveness
[1:08:09] who could do that by the power of
[1:08:10] reconciliation and that's what god come
[1:08:12] to reconcile sinners unto himself
[1:08:14] then we have to be like god oh glory to
[1:08:17] god to express god's kindness
[1:08:20] oh god to the weak ones and of some of
[1:08:22] compassion making a difference
[1:08:25] to those who are weak in the flesh from
[1:08:27] brute peace
[1:08:28] oh give the lord some praises tonight
[1:08:31] the way i
[1:08:32] shout in the house
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:51] they rejected the stone to the pyramid
[1:08:53] cut off the monkey without what without
[1:08:54] hands
[1:08:55] god centered do you see it they rejected
[1:08:57] one
[1:08:58] the rejected one is the head of the
[1:09:00] church they kept the head the capstone
[1:09:02] and the very one that they rejected
[1:09:04] through this gentile is christ
[1:09:06] and christ was not cut and put there by
[1:09:07] as a vicar or son of god
[1:09:09] or some great dignitary to church he is
[1:09:11] the holy spirit
[1:09:13] and the cap of the pyramid will be
[1:09:15] christ coming
[1:09:18] amen so l-o-v-e is christ's coming
[1:09:22] and the holy spirit is what's coming to
[1:09:24] us
[1:09:26] to prepare for love
[1:09:34] now watch i've got this shape like a
[1:09:36] pyramid the horizon of the saints makes
[1:09:38] the match to glory
[1:09:39] christ the headstone the rejected stone
[1:09:42] the all-seeing eye
[1:09:44] and daniel have you watched the gentile
[1:09:45] age until the stone come up with the
[1:09:47] mountains wasn't cut without hands
[1:09:49] they never put a capsule on that pyramid
[1:09:51] it wasn't cut out by man's hands
[1:09:53] it's god hand that cut that stone so
[1:09:55] when you talk about capstone now
[1:09:57] which is the seal of the building man in
[1:10:00] charge of that
[1:10:01] but i'm saying we do all that we can do
[1:10:03] that's the mechanics but only got to
[1:10:04] send dynamics
[1:10:05] so man god didn't give the right of man
[1:10:08] to dynamics
[1:10:09] he's in charge of that but he take faith
[1:10:11] to connect with that because faith could
[1:10:12] pull along the power of god
[1:10:14] and fate is based on forgiveness if
[1:10:16] there's no forgiveness there's no real
[1:10:18] faith
[1:10:18] because the faith was that he sent a
[1:10:20] prophet to the hearts back what
[1:10:22] to the fate of the father has to pull
[1:10:23] along what the holy ghost the power
[1:10:26] to get into the holy ghost you
[1:10:28] cannot get in that slot by mental
[1:10:29] ability is by faith you have to get
[1:10:31] there so it's a holy ghost send the
[1:10:33] prophet
[1:10:34] the holy ghost say behold i send you
[1:10:35] elijah to get fate into your system
[1:10:38] to connect back with the power because
[1:10:40] you need power to enter in
[1:10:41] you need power to break through the song
[1:10:43] barrier to get into rapture and
[1:10:45] condition
[1:10:46] oh god lord help me tonight did you hear
[1:10:48] what i'm saying
[1:10:49] you need power to get into wrapping
[1:10:51] condition before the astronauts go out
[1:10:53] here they have to have a rehearsal down
[1:10:54] here
[1:10:55] oh glory to god they have to have a
[1:10:57] place where they have zero gravity to
[1:10:59] float and whatnot because that's the
[1:11:00] atmosphere up there
[1:11:02] and before we leave here oh glory to god
[1:11:04] we have to have an atmosphere down here
[1:11:06] which is the spirit of christ in the
[1:11:07] church that's why he said there will be
[1:11:09] a church
[1:11:10] with jesus christ walking in it the
[1:11:12] shout of the king will be in the camp
[1:11:14] oh i'm so excited tonight we have a lot
[1:11:17] to live for
[1:11:18] we have a lot to look forward for oh
[1:11:20] glory to god if we move into the temple
[1:11:22] a great ministry lies ahead oh give the
[1:11:25] lord a shout
[1:11:26] i am dead at all i'm not back singing
[1:11:29] hallelujah
[1:11:30] i'm on fire for god this is what i'm
[1:11:33] looking for since 1975.
[1:11:36] oh god a church in order oh glory to god
[1:11:39] at church and expectation
[1:11:41] a church cut off from the world and the
[1:11:43] things of the world
[1:11:44] we'll give him some praises tonight
[1:11:46] hallelujah
[1:11:48] hallelujah christ is that stone
[1:11:51] he wasn't born of a man he was born of
[1:11:53] god he is coming for a church
[1:11:55] that has been reborn again by the spirit
[1:11:58] of god
[1:11:59] because the strength of that headstone
[1:12:01] runs through the church like a magnet
[1:12:03] so i remember about watching the mill
[1:12:05] and the time they were shaping
[1:12:07] and a big stone come all that scrap of
[1:12:08] metal in there and a big magnet won't
[1:12:10] pick up it all
[1:12:11] because it was magnetized it we have got
[1:12:14] to be magnetized to the headstone
[1:12:15] not some person or some bishop not some
[1:12:17] man of the hour not so many son of man
[1:12:19] who is the man of the hour and all that
[1:12:21] nonsense you have to be mannerized to
[1:12:22] the headstone
[1:12:24] oh glory to god who had stolen
[1:12:27] say it again the head stone that's where
[1:12:31] to be magnetized to
[1:12:32] not the church not this church
[1:12:36] hallelujah the headstone which is christ
[1:12:38] the holy spirit
[1:12:40] the word hallelujah we have got to be
[1:12:42] manchester headstone
[1:12:43] that headstone is the holy ghost
[1:12:47] all glory to god that headstone is the
[1:12:50] holy ghost christ
[1:12:51] and when every one of us that got the
[1:12:53] magnetism of the holy ghost
[1:12:54] when that stone strike the image the
[1:12:56] church will flee to it
[1:12:57] back into glory she'll be taken up in
[1:13:00] the rapture of the saints
[1:13:02] my god seriously there's a time
[1:13:06] he said might be crucial you think has
[1:13:08] got me steered
[1:13:09] time shall be no more he announces that
[1:13:11] time is over what happens

[1:16:58] and thunders is the cap so therefore the
[1:17:01] cap of revelation and manifestation then

[1:17:53] we continue you say you remember the
[1:17:55] pyramid message
[1:17:57] it is the caption what did it do
[1:18:02] the holy spirit capped off the
[1:18:05] individual
[1:18:06] and sealed it when we added your faith
[1:18:10] righteousness godliness kept adding till
[1:18:13] we got seven things
[1:18:14] and the seventh one was love which is
[1:18:16] god and that is how he makes the
[1:18:18] individual
[1:18:19] and caps him and seals him with the holy
[1:18:22] spirit
[1:18:24] oh glory to god where's that holy spirit
[1:18:26] that seal is that
[1:18:27] between l-o-v-e and brotherly love
[1:18:30] holy spirit isn't that right and
[1:18:33] that word
[1:18:34] is the word from luther wesley paul
[1:18:36] arenas martin columba luta
[1:18:38] all the word to the ages which was the
[1:18:40] scattered word
[1:18:42] he put all that word and put it inside
[1:18:45] of you
[1:18:46] and put a pyramid inside of you it's the
[1:18:48] pyramid of your life
[1:18:50] in mechanic form that's the secret
[1:18:55] the entire pyramid is a seed put inside
[1:18:58] of you
[1:18:59] hallelujah then if that be so brother
[1:19:02] branham
[1:19:03] he got seven churches that's immune
[1:19:07] and he had seven mysteries that had been
[1:19:09] summoned away and they fought for to
[1:19:10] bring back
[1:19:11] that they knew and now the heads don't
[1:19:13] come the cap of the church
[1:19:15] does the thunders mean that
[1:19:20] so what in you is what god see in the
[1:19:23] camp
[1:19:24] no the cap can't come down unto
[1:19:26] brotherly kindness
[1:19:29] the capital come down holy spirit these
[1:19:32] stones have to
[1:19:33] be called out to be fitted
[1:19:36] into the holy spirit slot because it's
[1:19:39] from dear you will be raptured
[1:19:41] because indeed you'll find heavily
[1:19:43] places and there you'll find another
[1:19:45] ephesians
[1:19:46] is there you find superchurch super race
[1:19:49] has been near the headstone
[1:19:50] oh glory come on now as we need a
[1:19:54] headstone
[1:19:55] superchurch nowhere in the holy spirit
[1:20:06] isn't that what the tell the prophet
[1:20:08] pick up a pen and write
[1:20:09] as the bride near the headstone she will
[1:20:12] be a super race
[1:20:13] a super church what he's talking about
[1:20:15] he's talking about holy spirit slot
[1:20:16] he's not talking about brotherly
[1:20:17] kindness he's not what you in the same
[1:20:19] spirit of christ was
[1:20:21] oh glory to god the works of christ
[1:20:24] saint john 14 12 the same works i do
[1:20:26] shall you do also you can erase that you
[1:20:29] can't change that
[1:20:30] that is still the word all glory that
[1:20:32] god has to be fulfilled
[1:20:35] or in a bride
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:44] nobody man and blasphemous name
[1:20:47] he was saying he said no when you say
[1:20:50] automobile
[1:20:51] he said no i'm not a mechanic it's got
[1:20:53] to be plugs and coils and
[1:20:55] balls and valves and everything else so
[1:20:57] when you talk about baptism of the holy
[1:20:59] spirit
[1:21:01] there's a lot that goes with that so
[1:21:03] he's comparing the battle he goes
[1:21:05] with same automobile a different kind
[1:21:08] that manually have automatic
[1:21:10] walking thinking of door trunk back you
[1:21:13] always have to be electric
[1:21:14] so a lot doesn't go with this world
[1:21:15] called automobile so when i talk about
[1:21:18] baptism
[1:21:19] he said a lot of things goes with it
[1:21:21] okay he said now peter said first fate
[1:21:23] now watch greek clothes
[1:21:24] faith now to your fate then you add
[1:21:26] virtue and temperance and so on like
[1:21:28] that and love
[1:21:29] and i even know love is god now then
[1:21:31] bringing this into the seventh church
[1:21:32] ages
[1:21:33] god is building in seventeen ages a
[1:21:35] bride for christ
[1:21:37] so this was the structure of building a
[1:21:39] bride that is the ages
[1:21:42] how to say it dispensation then
[1:21:46] and the same way he built the ages he
[1:21:48] built you
[1:21:51] he can't break his principles he can't
[1:21:54] break his laws
[1:21:56] he was building a bride under he knows
[1:21:58] of satan
[1:22:01] because all these messengers were hidden
[1:22:04] in the seals
[1:22:06] it's only say white torch read all state
[1:22:07] lost black horse and so on but these
[1:22:09] messengers was hidden under the land
[1:22:11] anointing ox anointing man anointed
[1:22:12] eagle anointing
[1:22:14] they were hidden behind here to call out
[1:22:16] the elect
[1:22:19] devil totally blindsided because in
[1:22:21] every age the elect was called out and
[1:22:23] sealed
[1:22:24] away this is the first elect
[1:22:28] satan have to deal with
[1:22:31] mano amano man to man you have to deal
[1:22:34] with this bride
[1:22:35] because this bride was sent in satan's
[1:22:37] eden
[1:22:38] to defeat him
[1:22:41] do you hear that tonight did you get
[1:22:44] that tonight
[1:22:46] [Applause]
[1:22:50] this will be such a defeat
[1:22:53] that when you look for the prices
[1:22:55] rapture
[1:22:57] and the devil will be so upset he will
[1:23:00] make war
[1:23:01] with the remnant of the woman's seed
[1:23:03] which is the church members
[1:23:04] in this message i call them the
[1:23:06] tribulation saints
[1:23:08] that hearing message preached tonight
[1:23:12] around the world without real revelation
[1:23:19] because they ever went in scots eden and
[1:23:22] trade on god's bride
[1:23:23] and god waited until they have the
[1:23:25] highest technology
[1:23:27] the highest amount of sin highest among
[1:23:29] a loss on sex and filth and pornography
[1:23:31] you name it a day is there
[1:23:32] and instead of having a clean pure
[1:23:34] virtual sinless bride
[1:23:37] going to come out in this age and prove
[1:23:39] to the devil
[1:23:41] prove to satan she is not like eve
[1:23:44] oh glory to god she's not only staying
[1:23:46] behind the world you know she will
[1:23:48] become the word itself
[1:23:50] and the same voltage power that satan
[1:23:52] felt
[1:23:53] when jill was written is the same power
[1:23:55] you will feel
[1:23:56] this bride because this bride will be
[1:23:58] extension of jesus christ
[1:24:00] what jesus begun to do and continue to
[1:24:03] do
[1:24:03] what she just began to do and continue
[1:24:06] to do
[1:24:06] she's going to write another book of
[1:24:09] acts
[1:24:10] or give the lord a shout it will be the
[1:24:12] acts of the holy spirit
[1:24:14] oh glory to god that same holy spirit
[1:24:17] slot
[1:24:18] from dear acts of the holy spirit
[1:24:21] write another book of acts hallelujah
[1:24:25] who there to guide you who they tell
[1:24:27] some man some bishop some pope
[1:24:29] the holy ghost itself my god
[1:24:35] my lord my lord my lord
[1:24:38] glory to god he has built a bride born a
[1:24:41] bride begotten a bride on earth for
[1:24:43] christ and the same way he bears his
[1:24:45] bride he has begotten individuals
[1:24:47] so our sister shepard had a dream and
[1:24:50] the dream was she was wondering lord if
[1:24:51] i have got the holy ghost can you prove
[1:24:53] to me
[1:24:54] some safe i shouted he said watch you
[1:24:56] said she saw she dreamed this dream and
[1:24:58] baram saw the dream that's how you get
[1:24:59] interpreted
[1:25:01] she dreamed her dream she was up on a
[1:25:02] mountain in this mountain it was a rock
[1:25:04] box
[1:25:05] her husband was behind her she saw a
[1:25:06] large man standing there with work
[1:25:08] clothes on
[1:25:09] sleeves rolled up bathing the most pure
[1:25:10] water that she'd ever seen
[1:25:12] pouring it into this box this rock box
[1:25:14] setting up the mountain and the rock box
[1:25:16] could not hold the water
[1:25:17] it rolled right out there just boiled up
[1:25:19] the trash and sticks and everything in
[1:25:21] there
[1:25:21] ball it out rolling up the mountain rule
[1:25:23] over her feet she was standing right in
[1:25:25] that stuff
[1:25:26] only didn't stick to her then she asked
[1:25:28] why the box didn't hold it
[1:25:30] the man said that is not water that's
[1:25:32] the holy ghost
[1:25:35] that's nothing will hold it
[1:25:40] said he went back and got another big
[1:25:41] bucket it was full of honey
[1:25:44] and poured the honey into deer and he
[1:25:46] said no it would hold this
[1:25:49] and she taught the box the rock box was
[1:25:51] going to burst out and spill the honey
[1:25:52] but it didn't
[1:25:54] it finally stuck together and held it
[1:25:56] she turned and went down the mountain
[1:25:57] going down the mountain she stopped and
[1:25:59] the bottom of the mountain and looked
[1:26:00] back she saw five streams of pure
[1:26:02] crystal water not contaminated
[1:26:04] by the things that had been through
[1:26:05] still pure clear coming swiftly then it
[1:26:08] slowed up
[1:26:08] then almost feed it out and she was
[1:26:09] wondering would it ever reach the bottom
[1:26:11] of the mountain
[1:26:12] five streams that she woke up so but
[1:26:14] ibrahim began to interpret the rock box
[1:26:16] his rock confession
[1:26:17] upon this rock blessed alzheimer's jonah
[1:26:20] uh
[1:26:21] but my upon this rock i'll build my
[1:26:22] church he said no that has been each
[1:26:24] church age has
[1:26:25] had a rock confession which is a rock
[1:26:27] revelation right
[1:26:28] so there's a revelation that what when
[1:26:29] the whole stuff okay
[1:26:31] he's now you cannot make a holy church
[1:26:33] one two there's no such thing as the
[1:26:34] holy church or hold on tradition right
[1:26:36] three the holy spirit can be preached in
[1:26:38] it but in dear you find good bad
[1:26:40] renegades and different and everything
[1:26:41] else
[1:26:42] so somebody judging the church by one
[1:26:44] member is foolishness
[1:26:47] because in the church you find let me
[1:26:48] say again good bad renegades and
[1:26:50] indifferent
[1:26:51] let me say that again it just says this
[1:26:54] unseen that
[1:26:55] no we call them scenes we call them
[1:26:57] brotherlessness you say in the church
[1:26:58] you find good bad
[1:27:00] renegades are indifferent
[1:27:03] blessed are three cannot believers and
[1:27:06] everything else so an
[1:27:07] organization will not hold it you can't
[1:27:09] say
[1:27:11] and i don't understand how believers
[1:27:12] could read these things and see the
[1:27:14] foolishness and
[1:27:15] you can't say we got it none of the rest
[1:27:18] of them has it
[1:27:21] so when people in their churches believe
[1:27:23] they own their pastor or their group
[1:27:25] or their only channel of god and people
[1:27:27] that come to them to hear it and to see
[1:27:29] it and whatnot this is
[1:27:31] it is contrary he said you can't say
[1:27:34] that
[1:27:36] he said you can't say that if anybody
[1:27:39] say hear that
[1:27:40] they will he you hear from me
[1:27:43] don't let me hear you say that reading
[1:27:44] whispered don't let her come back in my
[1:27:46] ears you know
[1:27:48] he said you can't say that
[1:27:52] you know some spirits they hear that but
[1:27:55] they want to see that yeah
[1:27:57] because they're feeling led the holy
[1:27:59] feeling inspired
[1:28:01] you satan upon the manner jesus jesus
[1:28:04] peter boy don't worry the christ on the
[1:28:05] living god jesus had to be creepy if i
[1:28:07] said no no no he said get behind me
[1:28:08] satan
[1:28:09] sit and jump on him right after you
[1:28:12] can't
[1:28:13] see that all right none of the rest of
[1:28:16] them have
[1:28:16] no sir the holy spirit is part of the
[1:28:18] individuals
[1:28:19] so tonight people hearing us tonight
[1:28:21] could holy speak about that in their
[1:28:22] house
[1:28:25] they don't even have to be in church
[1:28:30] glory because the holy ghost is poured
[1:28:32] out on individuals
[1:28:40] until when he was young he messaged and
[1:28:42] i read what i'm saying one is a majority
[1:28:44] in god
[1:28:44] i went on my knees and said lord i'm a
[1:28:45] majority are we going to pray for stuff
[1:28:48] yes why i say won the majority i feel
[1:28:49] like a real big majority
[1:28:51] one is the majority and goes in oh glory
[1:28:54] to god
[1:28:54] now in this church the message the
[1:28:56] message is being poured into the church
[1:28:59] this tabernacle we see here she comes to
[1:29:01] church this
[1:29:02] tabernacle is not a holy ghost
[1:29:04] tabernacle there is
[1:29:05] no such a thing
[1:29:08] individuals that come into this church
[1:29:10] is holy ghost tabernacles
[1:29:12] they are tabernacles that contain the
[1:29:14] holy ghost but not the church
[1:29:16] therefore it runs out so you take a
[1:29:19] bucket of holy ghost
[1:29:20] it pours into the church it goes sweep
[1:29:22] all the trash fill people
[1:29:24] individuals by going right through the
[1:29:26] church can hold it
[1:29:27] like how some people like if they're
[1:29:28] renting the angel
[1:29:30] they say the angel with his brother the
[1:29:32] angel with his pastor and people
[1:29:34] fighting the angel of the lord like the
[1:29:35] angels have a rental
[1:29:36] apartment in the church and you have a
[1:29:38] sexual situation just living there
[1:29:44] yeah the angel of our apartment yes he
[1:29:47] has new scriptures he isn't really
[1:29:48] prophet but he enjoyed this one and he
[1:29:50] wrote that one
[1:29:51] and when they hear what they're speaking
[1:29:52] you could know that angel is with them
[1:29:53] you know
[1:29:54] but not the issue of the lord i don't
[1:29:56] know what name i don't know where he
[1:29:57] comes from but it's certainly not from
[1:29:58] heaven
[1:29:59] it's not the israel it's somebody in
[1:30:00] general because the india being in
[1:30:01] revelation that not in the scriptures
[1:30:03] not in the message they call it hidden
[1:30:05] mysteries
[1:30:07] hidden from god and all right hidden
[1:30:09] from hearing from the prophet the
[1:30:10] prophet didn't reveal it
[1:30:12] see god sent a prophet to reveal all the
[1:30:14] mysteries
[1:30:15] and if a man preaching a mystery now
[1:30:16] that i can't find any word he only own
[1:30:19] and people like that become man invented
[1:30:20] you know they're saying something
[1:30:21] prophet didn't see you know i mean
[1:30:23] fresh they find this is boring i only
[1:30:26] say in bad things
[1:30:27] a man say years ago why think we read
[1:30:29] scripture
[1:30:32] look how long genesis is written but you
[1:30:35] know moses didn't reinvent that
[1:30:37] oh gosh i feel like in the
[1:30:39] beginning what's the word already
[1:30:41] moses just screamed that because he
[1:30:42] takes some marijuana and some
[1:30:44] ganja and something going to his head is
[1:30:46] god spoke to him
[1:30:48] and we take that as dusty at the lord
[1:30:51] holy men
[1:30:52] move as they were moved by the holy
[1:30:53] ghost this is the written word
[1:30:56] that's why the prophet said the spirit
[1:30:57] and the brave prophet will say the same
[1:30:58] thing
[1:30:59] i'm not embarrassed about this message
[1:31:01] i'm not embarrassed about this word
[1:31:03] i don't have to bring my own revelation
[1:31:05] and my own interpretation
[1:31:06] and my own explanation i am locked in
[1:31:11] my job is to find promises to preach and
[1:31:13] i'm preaching to you tonight
[1:31:15] the holy spirit shot is where you belong
[1:31:18] is where you are to aim at is where you
[1:31:21] are to press that
[1:31:28] the man who was pouring the water was
[1:31:30] the messenger to the church
[1:31:31] pouring a message to the church and the
[1:31:33] water was doing it was boiling all the
[1:31:35] trash that was in it
[1:31:36] that is what the holy spirit does and
[1:31:39] what i'm talking about revival revivals
[1:31:40] are getting trashed all the church
[1:31:41] people about no revival they're a bunch
[1:31:43] of stinkness all weed what kind of old
[1:31:45] pan
[1:31:45] what kind of nonsense inside the church
[1:31:47] and sing a message song on top of that
[1:31:50] as if mrs strong's revival i said that
[1:31:53] intellectual songs
[1:31:55] no juice in it no anointing in it no
[1:31:56] atmosphere in it and that's supposed to
[1:31:58] be a message
[1:32:01] because i have things and messages in it
[1:32:04] yeah
[1:32:06] it's good for information but not for
[1:32:07] inspiration
[1:32:09] informational songs we need inspiration
[1:32:12] song
[1:32:13] listen daniel couldn't uh david couldn't
[1:32:15] play a message song for
[1:32:16] saul you know that's spread upon soul
[1:32:18] and move no messages he had a prayer
[1:32:19] inspirational song
[1:32:21] he had praying because no devil like
[1:32:23] casting notice the atmosphere
[1:32:24] his devil's upon the man when david
[1:32:27] presents his music so it bring an
[1:32:28] atmosphere
[1:32:29] is the atmosphere to run them devils
[1:32:31] even them difference in your home and
[1:32:32] take an atmosphere
[1:32:34] you can come out they will come whatever
[1:32:35] what spiritually you have atmosphere
[1:32:38] you create that atmosphere you come to
[1:32:39] church to get connected to atmosphere
[1:32:41] now when you go back in your house
[1:32:42] if your atmosphere could vibrate over
[1:32:44] you you know it coming off of you
[1:32:47] oh glory to god is the atmosphere
[1:32:50] hallelujah could we give the lord a
[1:32:52] shout glory hallelujah hallelujah
[1:32:55] glory hallelujah so therefore the
[1:32:58] message is pure it's pure word
[1:33:00] it will boil the trash out and even pass
[1:33:03] you all kind of crazy stuff
[1:33:04] and all kind interpretation is still
[1:33:05] pure uncontaminated
[1:33:08] it's still written it's still there we
[1:33:10] can still say what he tapes see
[1:33:12] we forget all the way into position it's
[1:33:14] still here no you say my i do like
[1:33:16] brother so-and-so
[1:33:17] or brother jones i don't like brother
[1:33:18] son so he said but let something happen
[1:33:20] to that brother your heart is broke
[1:33:23] nearly killed you we can't obtain burly
[1:33:25] kindness and fearing for one another
[1:33:27] but to maintain the group and so on so
[1:33:30] he's talking about
[1:33:31] um you know that that forgiveness then
[1:33:34] isn't a group you're getting that
[1:33:35] that's what could hold in the church
[1:33:37] brotherly kind of spirit of forgiveness
[1:33:39] see so that is why we stress we strive
[1:33:41] for that because that is what the holy
[1:33:43] spirit is coming down upon
[1:33:45] the atmosphere of brotherly kindness
[1:33:47] spirit of forgiveness
[1:33:48] i like that i'm not teaching a very kind
[1:33:50] i say people teach that
[1:33:51] and explain that we're in brotherly
[1:33:52] kindness but we can't break they just
[1:33:54] talk
[1:33:55] we're talking about the spirit of spirit
[1:33:58] of
[1:33:59] forgiveness you see when that comes
[1:34:01] husband forgive wife
[1:34:03] why forgive husband i have father
[1:34:05] forgive children children forgive
[1:34:06] parents
[1:34:07] when that spirit comes to atmosphere oh
[1:34:09] glory to god make you put your
[1:34:11] put yourself in the person's position
[1:34:13] and put your shoes on
[1:34:15] oh my want to skip down quickly you know
[1:34:19] i'm going to skip down so he's talking
[1:34:21] about our streams of grace i want to
[1:34:22] just get down
[1:34:23] can i get this he said but those gifts
[1:34:25] of god with all these virtues in them
[1:34:27] we should call please makes a stumbling
[1:34:29] block to the unbeliever
[1:34:30] is not accepted by god this
[1:34:34] has to be first so it is important to
[1:34:37] understand why this
[1:34:38] time of lingering in this message
[1:34:42] because god wanted to see this this has
[1:34:45] to be first
[1:34:47] when you have faith virtual knowledge
[1:34:48] temperance patience goodness bully
[1:34:50] kindness
[1:34:51] then the holy ghost comes down
[1:34:55] and seals you as a unit this is specific
[1:34:59] are we driving slow down this road we're
[1:35:02] not talking about pentecost
[1:35:04] we're not talking about 1906. we're
[1:35:05] talking about when these things are
[1:35:07] added
[1:35:08] he said then the holy spirit come down
[1:35:10] on city as a unit
[1:35:11] the same as receiving the church ages as
[1:35:13] a unit
[1:35:15] so in other words he can seal the church
[1:35:17] ages until it's completed
[1:35:20] after it's completed so the prophet come
[1:35:22] at the end of the age and he could look
[1:35:24] back
[1:35:24] and say look at ephesus sardis
[1:35:30] you see he come to the end and look back
[1:35:36] so then he could show the cap will come
[1:35:38] it was rejected
[1:35:39] but we are the end now so we know what's
[1:35:41] coming next
[1:35:42] the count of the cap is the coming of
[1:35:44] the christ the coming of the cap is the
[1:35:46] coming of the stone
[1:35:47] that's totally to end the gentile
[1:35:49] dispensation
[1:35:52] then they could go to 145 000 jews but
[1:35:55] there's a ceiling angel to come to close
[1:35:57] it off
[1:35:58] the angel from the east having the seal
[1:36:00] of the living god
[1:36:02] the cap and we're going to read it as we
[1:36:04] close and we get down to the closer the
[1:36:05] cap the pyramid of your life
[1:36:09] oh give the lord some praises tonight
[1:36:11] hallelujah
[1:36:13] the same way he makes his bride is the
[1:36:15] same way he makes his individual
[1:36:16] made all the same material oh glory to
[1:36:19] god you can't imitate them
[1:36:21] they got to be god sent and god born
[1:36:23] imitation only causes
[1:36:25] confusion it has to come from inside out
[1:36:28] and it produces christianity
[1:36:29] god by the power of the holy spirit our
[1:36:32] sister had her feet wet
[1:36:33] when she got to the bottom and then he
[1:36:35] talked about god accepted the foundation
[1:36:36] and so on
[1:36:37] here's what's wrong with brahms you see
[1:36:40] there are two different kinds of fate
[1:36:41] they're two different kind of virtue
[1:36:43] about human virtues human faith human
[1:36:45] body kindness natural virtue natural
[1:36:47] and people say no church with a natural
[1:36:48] stuff we're not talking about that you
[1:36:50] talk about blood transfusion
[1:36:52] such a perfect man put you in your
[1:36:53] preaching theater get your blood out and
[1:36:54] put the blood jesus in
[1:36:55] put the blood jesus bring the feet of
[1:36:57] jesus virtue of jesus
[1:36:59] knowledge of jesus not your knowledge
[1:37:01] knowledge of jesus temperance of jesus
[1:37:03] isn't that right that faith and he said
[1:37:05] no watch what
[1:37:06] what we have the biggest part of our
[1:37:08] fate is mental fate a mental fate only
[1:37:10] here in the world bring us our
[1:37:11] mental recognition of god but then from
[1:37:14] above
[1:37:14] if it ever strikes this there is a godly
[1:37:16] spiritual fate
[1:37:18] so he's talking about the operation of
[1:37:19] the holy ghost to strike a mental fate
[1:37:21] and make it a spiritual revelation and
[1:37:23] that faith only recognizes the word
[1:37:25] so regardless of what the man say and
[1:37:27] preach the only way they could recognize
[1:37:28] isn't that right
[1:37:29] now the five streams they see coming
[1:37:31] down to here tempers percent together
[1:37:33] has been the holy spirit
[1:37:35] that made the ephesus church it was the
[1:37:36] holy spirit that breathed
[1:37:38] into this new world here now birth the
[1:37:41] smoothie and church
[1:37:42] the holy spirit give the pugamous jewish
[1:37:44] taitara church
[1:37:45] and build that bride there's an elected
[1:37:47] predestinated by jesus christ
[1:37:49] that the holy spirit has called out the
[1:37:50] elect and it's been the holy ghost in
[1:37:52] this age in that age in that age
[1:37:54] on to the top the holy spirit now as in
[1:37:56] individuals
[1:37:57] these virtues and things knowledge
[1:37:59] temperance is added to it
[1:38:01] then here we go when the capstone comes
[1:38:05] the holy spirit cements it together
[1:38:08] there is the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:38:12] that the automobile them that all the
[1:38:14] parts
[1:38:15] the plugs deploy the condensers and
[1:38:17] everything else inside of this fan
[1:38:19] the radiator everything in there that's
[1:38:21] it
[1:38:24] there is the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:38:26] that is why
[1:38:27] it's a short so short today
[1:38:31] so then you talk about from faith so in
[1:38:33] other words from faith
[1:38:35] to love sees you at christ then you have
[1:38:37] the person of the holy ghost
[1:38:39] living inside of you and that is not
[1:38:41] talk he said well speak for itself
[1:38:43] he will make let it be made known
[1:38:47] it will make itself known i must say how
[1:38:49] we say it it will make itself known
[1:38:51] you will have to speak a word it will
[1:38:53] speak for itself
[1:38:55] he said no watch what was number one
[1:38:57] number one coming down to your mental
[1:38:58] fate
[1:38:59] holy spirit coming down into your mental
[1:39:00] fate making it spiritual faith number
[1:39:02] two
[1:39:03] tree then you'll have a spiritual
[1:39:04] revelation you have the holy spirit i
[1:39:06] will seal
[1:39:07] all these things into you as the holy
[1:39:09] spirit covers this from your faith here
[1:39:10] we go
[1:39:11] up to the holy spirit the he's
[1:39:13] talking about seals you in with christ

[1:39:18] one

[1:39:24] god then
[1:39:25] is when they are vindicated and placed
[1:39:28] not before
[1:39:30] then let me say it again then let our
[1:39:33] pastors figure their own and their
[1:39:34] vindicated no
[1:39:35] nothing at all zero only mouth only talk
[1:39:38] then they have indicated i'm reading
[1:39:41] then they are vindicated and placed
[1:39:43] and when that time takes place they
[1:39:44] become vindicated sons
[1:39:46] and daughters of god right now we are
[1:39:48] sons and daughters of god but then they
[1:39:49] become vindicated sons
[1:39:51] and daughters of god halal that song
[1:39:52] something good tonight when when you're

[1:40:17] that god can see virtue and knowledge
[1:40:19] and temperaments and patience and so
[1:40:21] forth
[1:40:21] then and then god seals him and places
[1:40:24] him
[1:40:25] that is when you see the son of he say
[1:40:26] it again

[1:41:19] spirit you cannot join the church
[1:41:21] you could join a lodge i think if god
[1:41:23] tempered his bride together with that
[1:41:25] spirit
[1:41:26] and then it tempers the individual
[1:41:27] together with that spirit then you're
