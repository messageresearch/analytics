all tonight that's where we come from Oh hallelujah praise God you are not on an area but tonight we are gonna find out our position in this word in this message and why we are here Oh what we are here for we have to make a revival we are here to cause a stirring in this world this world will once more hear direct from God Oh because there will be a group of people who will be anointed those people being trinidad will be an Africa there'll be an America maybe all over the world people he could choose in his endtime know the message of Malachi 4 is not dead but all corners are live tonight I'm not caught that he looks sick no corner reason pad but corner cast out Devils not gonna kick the seat another heaven is here to kick him out of the earth praise God we're here to kick him out of the church kick him out of your life kick him out of your heart priest car same as somebody money man amen amen the 11:00 tonight feels good in here tonight a man feel like the atmospheres here praise God any atmosphere pitch miracles could take place in the atmosphere pitch or the Prophet love that kind of atmosphere you didn't have to pretty much that was here just booth he said preach it rise up and receive your healing rise up and claim it in the ranch by happy fees cancer everything run hallelujah from the presence of Almighty Laurie so the first thing is Satan the serpent never read about he came against worship isn't that right he didn't want that worship he wanted I wish it for himself he did not want that worship for God he did not want that worship for the Most High isn't that right you wanted all to himself but first he has to stop the worship I was going on Harlan is nice first the other introduced holiday his thoughts he's thinking he got to interject his opinion on the matter and show the Angels why he thought that this was a better idea that this was a better way of living this is a better direction to go into is not the devil hates worship he heats let me get into the atmosphere he hates when you get into the spirits because when you're in the spirits you could hear from God the devil hates revelation but we love it were true revelation in our lives but gates of Hell could never prevail against it Oh with true revelation you know life you see what was written in the scripture and revelation teks the what was written in the scripture it takes the wood of God and it makes it present tense to you I'm gonna say that again revelation power revelation stimulation when it comes upon the world a written word it brings us to life it makes it present tense to you deeper believer it makes it present tense to you the individual so no matter how long the scripture is sitting there for years just as quotes just as books or just as teeps but when revelation strike it then it becomes real when it becomes alive then it becomes quicken when it's no more but now it's an anointing dropped upon it to make it present tense to you oh we could read that cortisol healer but when it's inspired to you and something in your heart can raise up and wrap your healing and take it from the devil what he took from you you can take back your joy take back your peace to do tonight create an atmosphere create an anointing for the spirit to come down and anoint the word as is being preached to us anoint the promises as it's coming to us hallelujah are no more words just flying away ahead but now it's anointing now you see who you are you see when you come from you see where you're going you see what your real name is your name is not lavell your name is not John Jones but there's a mystery of what the book is while it is calling those names so when the mystery is being preached and seven thunders get aged seven thunders Calipari viable hallelujah you are seeing your name being spoken when you hear God hallelujah hallelujah when you hear promises being spoken to you very well God is a healer upon the deliverer when you hear the holy spirits shall come upon you but not many days hence or tarry in a city Jerusalem when you hear that power is coming upon you the Holy Ghost the changes hallelujah from this stage into a supernatural stage it gives you a charge because your tyranny I was way back in the beginning what with Michael and those angels both angels represented you here tonight and that is why we are here tonight we are here to take up our position in Christ and to know who we are now we can pray with faith know we could clean more daughter well we can clean more son push back the enemy get down Satan let him know who sideway on we come to take role of Oh hallelujah somebody shout somebody lift up your hands tonight we come to take over we come to mean business clean your territory hallelujah the authority that God is getting ready the police in the sons of God listen you can start exercising that right now when you go to work don't let them dictate the atmosphere you dictate the atmosphere you clean your crumbs you claim your inheritance you let them know who is here know a son of God is here now hallelujah - in the atmosphere of prayer and worship hallelujah hallelujah will you do it you inviting angels right on your workplace right in your school right in your job right taking all the garbage you could be anywhere God will meet you there praise God hallelujah where the Prophet was behind a pulpit or whether he was up on the mountain it was the same presence that drop pound and he knew that presence and he lived in that presence and it's gonna be our people tonight who's gonna know that presence who's gonna know that power who's gonna know that anointing that ongoing thing will arrest the devil's in this last day Oh hallelujah praise finish tonight because their sons and daughters of God horizon of inches church in this assembly and I say tonight to clean the inheritance to clean their portion of the Holy Ghost [Applause] we are royal priests and we are holy nation we ought to pray like it believe like it walk like it speak like it see the problem is we are in the world but we are not of the world but the challenge is being in the world and having to rise up above that in the world to be not of the world hey man it's a challenge to get from there to there please go up because in the world you have to be built since night in the world you have to interact with people you have to talk to people and you have to get things done in the natural that's all right that's part of the challenge that's why we bypass our Tiffany but drop dong into flesh but God in a theophany stage already proclaim you victorious listen you are not going back to a defeated theophany please Clark you're not going back to some poor me one no it's a glorified body it's a glorified state that theophany praise God Satan out of heaven it's a victorious state that's what we are going to but because we bypass / hallelujah hallelujah come to be tested we come to be tempted because in this condition we don't know who we are and we have to come to a growth we have to come to a maturity we have to come to a perfect stage a man out of a perfect Scanlan under the blood of jesus christ we come from that to a perfect stage hallelujah praise call how well you know all things Oh night profits right up there over on the other side when he had that vision she said Bill you talked about it

them that keep praising to God core tool to well as power when the morning stars sang together I when the sons of God shouted for joy Jason was dead but a praise come on now oh you are stare you are shouting you are giving God glory we were waving our swords in the air and say woe unto the church and they inhabit the devil has a short time but we are going down to finish what we started here oh do you see it now so it's a process we can't bypass the process that's the part of one of the devil's tricks one of his both major tricks in this message trying to make the people feel that they could just walk into the rapture it doesn't look like that God doesn't give the Holy Ghost to anybody on a silver platter you have to pray you have to cry you have to get down on your knees you got to go through some stuff the Prophet went to stuff Abraham went through stops what you talking about tonight Moses went through stuff everybody went through that stuff but they come true some to the waters some to the bloody some to the finite but all to the blood of Jesus Christ they were trying to sleep they were tempted this way the Bible said it was leaned on the edge of the sward they wander around in sheepskin coats skin being destitute being afflicted being tormented all these have not attained the promise but they are waiting on you and I they got a revelation of who we are hallelujah so that we could pull them up and say come on Paul come on Harry come on Martin you fought for the faith in your tail now P I had to finish your alleluia alleluia Oh my father will get into and I work glory be to God hallelujah oh it's gonna come on people you are that people tonight you were gonna realize on that day that you shall know I am in my father my father me and I knew and you and me cause it's gonna unveil in you a truthful mystery oh I like Christ in you Oh hallelujah to bring you back to perfection my my my my my my my think of it we were sons we were always sons but we were just lost through sin we lost to Adam on the fourth and God had a plan to bring us back to our perfect state and a quarter perfection decided to come drawing an imperfection this great car that we're talking about fail himself in human flesh as what Isaac said son no any turnaround he found his help in the womb of Mary when he translated himself came and dropped down into flesh came on top the law was tempted came on drop down I was tried and devil didn't know who he washe never met him in the wilderness I said if thou be the Son of God tell these stones into bread and cheese I said it is a return it is written God oh he blasted him on the word and it's gonna be Santa Claus tonight there's gonna be portals of Sion tonight we're gonna defeat the devil on the world a message hi Abigail please call I don't person fighting and how here are all are you just like married you just like a son you're gonna press true I receive the Holy Ghost and raise up the Oh hallelujah hallelujah - we ought to pray God put something inside of us like lilies tonight we are pressing me on the Mach passing beyond the mile pressing me on all the satanic influence in this world today there's a million reasons why we could go back but I've got one reason in my heart and his name is Jesus and for that reason my heart beats tonight that reason while I still have breath in my body let me die with my Philistines but I'm going through I've got to go all the way let me tell to myself but God must be glorified in me live on time sink or drown let this life live in me it's my prayer let me let purge you live in me that knowledge live in me let them proceed in me all that charity live in me your card it's not your present I prophesied pray without ceasing pray without stop until every one of these virtues are living in you that's the requirement to make it interruption I know you got to have the full Word of God not possible but the whole roll eat the whole roll it shall be sweetened I'm out with my belly but you gotta eat the whole thing don't leave our pot don't pop the same pot when that was just perfect to come all pass away we have received a miniature perfection xisa holidays night he said walk before me and be therefore perfect even as my fine heaven is perfect we have a call to perfection tonight hallelujah I Martin Luther listen his thing is nice they came to the requirement up today is not Wesley lived in LA they came to the requirement the requirement of sonification is not right they have to come to that it wasn't enough for them to be justified in that age you understand it or reveal something higher and because that you really high it required something more of them to step up to the standard the platform that was being presented in that day wasn't good enough for you to say do you believe Martin Luther's message hallelujah but with this that was revealed hallelujah can you take the word can you any man how can you die out to yourself and receive the word for nothing and they all had a requirement for that age is nice and they met the requirements god how do people in every to meet that requirement in that day and I'm seeing tonight that God has people tonight that I hear to receive the requirements I can beat the standard of this ha Oh hallelujah to meet the standard of perfection there has to be a quality of people like won't have to choose it couldn't just be anybody hard everybody choose somebody but standing Trinidad somebody Remus me granny when I know angel corners wherever he had to choose somebody to do it oh it's not you then who it's not yeah well if not now then Oh hallelujah however there's got to be a people in the land yeah Oh hardly the Prophet did not come in vain therefore as we have received much we are expected much of us a man in its last day why don't we got a pretty much printout ceasing until every one of these virtues these requirements be living in us we got to live our fate live our virtue we live our knowledge live our temperance live our patients we can't stick your head in the sand and try to prevent it hasn't been preached because the gospel was not me plead to them like it's me me clean to us in this last year unless or whom much is given much is expected that's why so much emphasis is being put on prayer and being put on 10 occasion and sanitation and consecration why because we got to rise up from our humanistic into a supernatural realm to catch the mind of God for this day that's why when you come to church we come to lift up our hands we don't look around us praise God we come to meet with God we come to meet the pillow we come to get in contact with that chain angel that was with the prophets that same angel with the rainbow presence that same angel with the rainbow glory that angel is on here now mixing things around put a comment on the Lord fix me Lord Jesus I need a fix in my heart in my life take all the lofts take all the lies take out the filthiness take out a real examine me cut me shape me hold me but let Jesus live in me is my prayer Oh hallelujah top resonate Oh hallelujah we ought not to rest day and night until the Holy Ghost is booming in our souls until the Holy Ghost has found its way in our hearts we can't stop tonight we gotta keep on praying keep on pressing keep on fighting keep on shining with everything we have in us don't you stop don't stop prayer no stop pray for your life don't stop pray for your husband but I pray for your children keep on praying keep on believing God I made the promise he is able to provide for your every need according to his riches in glory he is able to fill you with the Holy Ghost and fire he did it for Peter come on now he did it from Mary come on now he can't do it for you tonight somebody say man Peter James John Wall in the upper room and they were human beings just like you and me it's night they were afraid prophetic shut themselves in the upper room but you'll be leaving on a promise believing on the Lord Jesus that the same Jesus had come holla at 8:00 with them and sup with them all the time they didn't know who he was but then real slowly when he come back in his resurrection ministry he began to reveal the scripture and I began to open their understanding but what he was telling them while he was yet with them in Galilee and in Jerusalem and all these places remember the things I spoke unto you you shall receive the Holy Ghost the son of man shall be delivered up and a sinful man and after three days he raised up again remember I told you those things and they have to pass look at my hands look at my feet look at my side it's me don't you be afraid don't be afraid of the devil don't be afraid of Lucifer don't be afraid of Roman army you want more than conquerors don't you be afraid I'm gonna come with you I'm gonna be in you even to the end of the earth and I'll be with you in Judea I'll be with you in Samaria I'll be with whoever you call and the Bible says the Lord went with hammer everywhere confirming the word with signs wonders and miracles it was not only talking about the world but they heal the sick on the spot they are rested the pebbles on the spot hallelujah are we gonna come back to that kind of a church in this last day tonight that's gonna be a church in Trinidad we're gonna heal the sick raise the dead that's how pebbles Oh rainbow glory will be all around you because I've been the same Jesus doing the same things he did when he was oh my whoa Jesus Eman so I was talking about the process just about 5-10 minutes again talk about a process in alright it's a process that destination and God's ultimate purpose for us it's not just to go to church but occupy a Pew is now or the pit hi don't be nice Christians but this process was the ticket a destination what's the take us to sonship what's it take us to our adoption was the tickets to all place in Christ the Prophet said all place in Christ's heavenly places it's actually the believers position in Christ that's what it is not just some airy-fairy thing it's not a made-up heaven earlier but it's a position that you haven't God Jesus came seeing the kingdom of heaven is at hand and you didn't know you just talked about the King number but he demonstrated the kingdom you heal the shake was the King number he reads the dead that was the kingdom because this gospel that we preach is not in word only but is in power and it's an administration of the Holy Ghost in other words there's going to be a people in the I'm going to demonstrate the Holy Ghost anaconda demonstrate the shaitaan hold this thing would you tell the enemy this land belongs austenite I feel like Caleb relax now therefore give me my Mountain give me my inheritance where I was in that pail the anakims was great but it's the Lord be with me and I shall be able to chop the enemy to ribbons Jesus seemed triumphant spirit kayla was different why because he's a type of the bride tonight we will possess her individual inheritance oh how many possesses inheritance the land had rest from war and we are promised to enter into that rest into that seven children by a glorious wonderful Holy Ghost where this pitch letters fetch you what is knowledge what is temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness seven thunders God be revealing in God living out of you thunder that shakes it ever a holy sanctified life say anything to him justice sweetie oh honey what is it the pyramid jumping inside of you that original image that Seton sought to destroy in the Garden of Eden God right under the devil's nose right in secrets just as Barry was pregnancy walking to Jerusalem King Herod II know him she was there or she passed through Jesus was undercover and just with Jesus was undercover God have a people in the land such as never was since there was a nation there undercover they never don't know they commented he didn't know I never leaves it will be the sudden secrets going home of the
