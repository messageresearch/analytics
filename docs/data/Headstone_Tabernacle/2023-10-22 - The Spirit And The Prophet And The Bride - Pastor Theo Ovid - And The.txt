one day something going to happen and all the evil be taken out one day it will be different you know maybe the minister wouldn't have to minister because God will fill the place with his glory oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah may be seated well I bring greetings from India from pastor vickram and pastor avanes and the Believers across in India part that we went to and we had a tremendous time in the Lord amen praise the Lord I I did for service back to back and my voice never break and I never lose strength actually the last service was just as strong as was the first service so I thank God for that uh it was good being there uh I get to uh I think it's Doha that take 13 hours flight to go that way and coming back was 15 hours to get from there to back to Miami but uh the trip was blessed and the believer were blessed and I know there one or two would like to come here to Trinidad next next next uh convention July and we'll be happy if they could get come to get here amen also I want to appreciate I didn't get to make any comments after the service of brother yadel thel and what a tremendous blessing he was to us and I know is to the body of Christ and I'm looking forward for more fellowship and more brothers that would step forward to minister or minister to support uh so we're looking to see what the Lord will do this morning and um I'm under great expectation and India was kind of mindblowing because the atmosphere was there from the very start so I know that the Lord is working a mighty mighty mighty work and his spirit is moving all over the world God have his people everywhere like I told them across day God have his man right in India we were there to encourage to support and so on not to take over not to be charge not to be no Pope over anybody right so that position of popery I have no interest in it whatsoever that Crown position and that's in charge of men and whatnot sorry I not qualified for that that above my pay grade I'm here to serve and God put me in this little group to serve and that's what I want to do to serve effectively I'm here I believe to speak to the bride of Christ I don't know who that is really we preach to all as bride but all is not bride we know that you know every group there are three kind of Believers so you can't judge this church by some cuckoo inside of here you can't judge your CH by some n case inside of here or some crazy inside of here you understand you have to judge people by the word so when we come here each one of us have to subject ourselves to the word of God because we come here to get better we come here to grow we come here to mature we come here to get ripe the prophet said your faith isn't ripe enough that means Faith could grow Faith could ripe and not because you are where you are you to stay where you are oh come on now not where you are you stay where you are you could be in a condition but you have to stay there you could be in poverty but you don't have to stay there you could be in depression but you don't have to stay there not because where you are you're going to stay there you are come on now you could get out praise God you could step out you could do better amen you can aim higher glory to God because good is the enemy of perfect God don't want it just good he want it perfect he want to come to Perfection that mean you have to press higher the voice said come up here and I shall show you praise God you can't stay where you are to see nothing when you're down in the dumps praise God do something about it go go go don't keep D don't keep digging when you're D in the dumps you go deeper in your hole get out your hole oh give the Lord some Praises get out the dumps glory to God get out of that then you can climb higher and further glory to God hallelujah there's going to be a powerful bride of Jesus Christ nothing going to stop it let's go from good to Great oh give the Lord some Praises oh Hallelujah yes yes yes yes yes let's get go from good to Great you a good father be a great father you a good mother be a great mother you a good grandfather be a great grandfather be a great grandmother be a great Deacon go give the Lord some Praises be a great Usher be a great preacher Oh Glory be a great believer let Heaven testify about you let he let Heaven witness your testimony oh give the Lord a praise offering hallelujah praise God amen amen maybe Cesar I was talking to my wife and I was talking to Isaac also about you know somehow sometimes God doesn't allow uh people to fulfill all their dreams you have dreams you have visions and so on and like David he has a heart to build a house for the Lord David had plans David put in his own personal money into the into the Affairs of God for the building but God said David not you your son your son will do further than that David you fought your fight your years coming out now you I mean you have a burden and everything else but die now for you to fulfill so tell the Bible said old men shall dream dreams young men shall see Visions now it's two different things there you know because the old men can't fulfill the dream that they're dreaming about but young men who could have a vision could come and fulfill what the old men dream oh give the let the Old Men Dreams oh praise God but God going to raise up some young men that going to fulfill the vision because the vision is an appointed time oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah nothing wrong with dreaming nothing wrong with I'm a vision and sometimes it just doesn't work out you have something in your heart you like to see you like to do something work out some with not that's how God have it amen I remember when my mother died uh I don't think she knew uh some of the grandchildren was coming and that's it somebody have to go at some point in time and then whatever age and Stage a child at that's how it is but life goes on the vision goes on the vision itself is complete and perfect because a vision from God but one thing we know God can't lie he don't have the ability to lie he's the function of Truth fruit and in him no Darkness at all so when he speaks is light and his word could be a lamp onto our feet and a light to our path so when God bring his word he bringing truth and light and Life to us that we can walk in it oh glory to God and day by day Souls going across yand praise God Souls break into the next Dimension and they're going across knowing there's a lamb be on the river they are dead and done they go to another dimension and we who are alive and remain glory to God shall not hinder them who asleep oh God that we have Breen gone and they're sleeping right now but we going to wake them because the voice of the Archangel going be a bride day without us not made perfect a church has got to come to Perfection we are leaving here Glory we're going to read the scripture just now and I don't know I'm going get to it but the prophet said your life is in the hand of sinful men with a trigger on atomic bombs and so on sinful men you think anybody in Ukraine teachers doctors lawyers going to work normal normal all does somebody coming to invade one man he didn't led to invade look at Israel ham just to attack the planting in secret that's why I say before I left here in the time of peace prepare for war oh give the Lord some Praises that's not that's not a catchphrase you know that is real you know in the time of peace prepare for war even Jesus said which hearing my words and if a man listen to it like a man who build his house upon a rock a man who don't listen build his house up on a sand and the house looking nice you paint it up and looking pretty but the rains have come yet then the rains come Hallelujah and the winds blow so as long as the wind they blowing and the storm are coming and the rain are falling you're good you can have your party you can have your dance you could do whatever you want but when that wind begin to rock that wind begin to blow is what your bill on is better or not going to stand you impress your family you impress your wife your children your husband your your neighbor whoever it is you make your style right but the storm's coming that storm could be cancer humor that storm could be diabetes that storm could be a heart attack that's something could be or some kind of thing in your in hospital you don't know what kind of storm a storm of sickness a storm of you lost your job you don't know what kind of storm coming but the storm is coming you can't stop that the winds will contrary oh give the Lord some praises and when the winds are Cherry you need God you need to walk with God you need to talk with God you can't explain thing suffering doesn't mean sin way dark clouds doesn't mean sin just the wind blowing contrary we can't explain that oh God help me this morning but sometime the wind just blow contrary a contrary wind blow in your marriage in your home in your finances in your situation in your house wherever but the winds blow contrary but there's a voice that could say peace be still there's a voice that could tame the way there's a voice [Music] that could tame those Devils oh my Hallelujah that's why when you come to church you come to church with a grateful heart always come to church with a grateful heart don't Vex you come to church and your parents being at the church and you no don't do that many people wish they were inside a church but they strap up in a hospital bed they foot up here they hand up here they all kind of thing tubes in the nose and mouth and everything else but you are here this morning give God praises today when you hear his voice Harden not your heart Oh Glory to God when you hear his voice Harden not your heart glory to God say God do something in my heart for me do something in my life glory to God Amen you may be see that there's too much religious people around religious Spirits they like to come to church because this is the atmosphere and they live in this atmosphere so they they don't want to change they want to be in an atmosphere they don't want to be converted they want to be in an ATM don't be like that now you must want to be changed because when that angel hold on to Jacob he said I want that change Hallelujah and Jacob began to hold on to that angel and he could talk about atmosphere and hold on to the angel he said but I will not let you go till you bless me I want to touch you and get your testimony I touch the angel and come in my house I don't want to hear that I want to know of a new walk a new talk a new life a new attitude a new action praise God people still talk about their Childhood Days and how they raised and how they grow cut that crap out it's not what you're born into it's not what name they give you it's the name you make for yourself you could do better than that don't tell me what your grandmother and your grandfather and this one and that one don't tell me what this one do you and that one do you Liars they do you nothing you're doing yourself oh give the Lord some Praises pick up your bed and walk oh give the Lord some Praises I don't know why I saying all these things this morning but pick up your bed and walk oh pull yourselves up on the bootstrap the Lord some Praises too much of blaming and blaming and blaming blame yourself let be seated Hallelujah but a yadel went powerfully into the whole description of this woman with the alabaster box and Jus when she when Jesus understood he was anointed to die to death and she was a side of the Bride right but let's bring it to you and I know do you know you have to be anointed to die a willing us to let go of you Paul said this I Die daily this killing we talking about is for everybody you know don't pray the pastor kill him Lord kill him Lord what about you Jesus said except a corner with fall and that who he's talking to Pastor Prophet teach evangelist janitor whatever it is Gardner except a corner we fall in the ground and die you abide alone but if it dies it brings much more fruit at the end of this at the end of this song we have to see Jesus like I tell them in India I not there to say about the clothing and the kind of music and whatever it is you know I there to minister the word of God because the Bible said out of different Nation tongs and King was a beautiful experience in India always have a enjoy time going India there oh Hallelujah today was this time was extra special and I'm hoping that them brothers can make it back some of them down here for trainer convention next July oh praise God so we're looking forward to see what the Lord will do there's a bride around the world and I'm talking about leaving your life in the hands of sinful men all of a sudden you're going to work you teach and whatnot and BMS had to fall like Ukrainian all of a sudden somebody come and and and and think all of a sudden men sinful men wicked men but the finger on on the on on the button don't say that wouldn't affect you the Bible said the island shall be flood away don't say that not affecting you you know even what happening oh my I'll read it I'll read by the same scripture read before leave how J Jerusalem shall become a burdensome Stone to All Nations so what happened there is he starting like a kind like the fire and walk away and then start to burn Hallelujah because we know all the countries have to come against Jerusalem and all the spirits in Hell had coming against the bride 200,000,000 devils and them only about to start a ride that's why we have to become a super Church a super race as we near The Headstone we can't withstand no Devils with books and tapes or give the Lord some Praises we can't withstand no Devils just just come in the church and going back home you got to become the word living you got to become the word manifested you got to become the word Vindicated do you want that or you just want to come to church Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah praise God praise God praise God will you want you see I'll tell you something when people get set in your ways it's a difficult thing to break you out of that you know you have to want that you know you have to want change you know that's why J didn't say If any man want a drink you know he said If any man test let him come to me and drink then in the sermon in the mount he said blessed a day that hunger and thirst after after righteousness they they shall be filled don't let no preacher nobody take that from your heart you shall be filled filled with what filled with power filled with the Holy Ghost filled with the spirit do you want that you have to want that you didn't born with that you're born with a gene a seed a germ but God had to fill it with his power he said a new heart I'll give you a new spirit I'll put within you and I'll put my spirit in your spirit oh give the Lord some Praises we have promised the Holy Ghost we have promised a

read from 5 to8 Revelation 10 8-1 revelation 22 7-12 and 16 and 17 1 Corinthians CH 3:5 who then is Paul who is Apollos but ministers by whom he believed even as the Lord give to every man I have planted Paul speaks Apollo's watered but God give the increase so neither is he that planted anything neither he that water it but God that giveth the increase now he that plant it and he that water it are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor Revelation chapter 10 read in verse eight and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake to me again said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and John here represented the bride and I went unto the angel said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand eat it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings our final reading is on Matthew chapter 2 Revelation chap 22:7 says behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the SS of the prophecy of this book and I John saw these things and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things now look at the reaction of the Angel then sayith he to me see thou do it not don't worship me for I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God and he said unto me seal not the SS of the prophet prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let them be unjust still he which is filthy let them be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be let's go on to verse 16 of the same chapter I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the church es I am the root and The Offspring of David and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bright sck come let him that hear at sake come let him that is at thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely may God bless his word let's pray father we thank you for your word here your precious people the souls gathered here this morning and I pray that you speak to their hearts and may it have a transformational effect upon their lives in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated praise is God hallelujah so this morning I have a title here the spirit and the prophet and the bride that's the title this morning the spirit and the prophet and the bride I an inspiration seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the times at hand I have a question will the bride have a voice and be a mouthpiece for God it's question going have see if we could get that question answered will the bride have a voice and and Paul said it clearly he said who is then is Paul I have planted AP Paul's watered but God give the increase amen now go in a prophet with seeds but the son of man is a Ser of The Good Seed Luke 17:30 says even thus had it been the day when the son son of man is revealed the only reason God send back son of man manifestation is to bring seeds because the son of man is a Ser but the seeds that this son of man coming with according to Luke 1730 is the seed of the entire Bible because we are the end of time so now every mystery had to be revealed to get the seed of the entire Bible into a people that's why I get the secret is the word is in the bride a seed is in the bride isn't that right all right now watch this you now when did you get saved when did you get Sanctified when did you get filled with the Holy Ghost When You Believe on the Lord Jesus for you receive there right everlasting life but from then you start growing you start growing you grow through sanctification through the Holy Ghost through speaking in tongues through all these things you receive life when you believe see what I mean now some people already got life and you're trying to get them to do something here when they haven't even reached that place yet and that's why we said the Bible talk about I write unto you young men I write unto you children I write unto you fathers that you know from the the beginning on every stage of growth from children to young men to fathers there's a portion of knowledge that is afforded to that you cannot give child uh Advanced knowledge when the child is just in primary school so according to the growth of the child God presents certain things to them now the object of God is to get us into fatherhood or get us into maturity or get us into adoption that we could manage our own stuff can we give the Lord some Praises in other words God want his son to be independent you know how the Bible say for this cause should a man leave his mother and father and cleave his wife the object of parenting is to bring the child to maturity that they could leave and cleave not stay and hold and be managed and helicopter parent Hing over the child that is not the objective you know the objective is to reproduce and produce a mature son a maure daughter that could go on in responsibility and in their future and in their lives oh give the Lord some praises and that's the same thing God wanted let us make man in our image I want to be just like me having my objective and motive and let them have dominion over the fish over every creep rep thing and God saw it was good oh give the Lord some Praises God wasn't envious of man in position or man having Authority or man having power that's what he wanted oh give the Lord a shout So Adam was a god of the earth he had to name everything and everything he called was the name thereof so God put Power into man his original intent was to get power into man to rule to conquer to overcome but Fallen man want to re over man fall man want to take control and people like to have influence over control over power over that's not God's original intent God original intent is that the Holy Ghost have over you it come like the Holy Ghost over the husband and then the wife is under the husband because the Holy Ghost is under the husband so as he yield to the headship the wife yields to him yes so the order of God is for you as a man to be the priest in your house not woman priest oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God and you be the priest in the house all right let's go I watch something now now the Pentecostal people has never come to the place where the church is getting now to adoption or to the placing of a son so 1906 birth Pentecostal speaking in tongues they only had that birth story but they never came to the maturity that God could positionally place them the only person that came to maturity was William Mar Braham that God adopted into the family of God and give him authority to speak to squirrels speak to squirrels speak to the storm same power that Adam had that Jesus had he demonstrated and said the Bible have that same thing too so what he actually prophesying from the book was that other Sons will come to maturity or come to adulthood or come to fatherhood to know him from the beginning oh give the Lord some Praises you will not always be a young man Oh Glory you will not always be a child you're going to grow you're going to mature you're going to ripen you're going to get into the place where God could positionally place you as to what you are Oh Glory to God and when you come into a position you cannot oh my you will have faith in your position not the anointing there know in who you are not the anointing upon you you know but in who you are come like when Saul when when Samuel anointed David David couldn't go back and say come for the throne now he went back and see what sheep because he was anointed but not ready anointed but not ready he had to grow and get mature to to get the Throne of Israel because God was finished with Saul God send the pink slip to Saul and fire him and he don't even know he's fired but he's on the throne but he already anoint David and God of a bride already anointed but that bride will come into position position of power oh give the Lord some Praises glory glory to God are you with me now hallelujah hallelujah so the Pentecostal Church never came to this position of being placed Hallelujah so this prophet of Malachi 4 behold I S Elijah the Prophet this prophet of Luke 17:30 this son of man being revealed is also the same prophet of R 10:7 the days of the voice of the seventh angel and the voice of the seventh angel he had to catch the mystery from the mighty angel in Revelation 10:1 I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow about his head and his feetures brass and Pillar of Fire and he had hand a little book open that book was once closed in heaven now the book is open and when he opened the book Seven tunders T the voices out and I was about to write you say seal up the things that the seventh Thunders uttered and write them not but the days of the voice of the seventh angel Oh Glory to God the angel swore that time shall be no more time runs out but Revelation 108 speaks about a different thing I heard the voice again say go to the angel who you talking to not talking to church members he's talking to the bride and said give me the book which book the same book that was closed the same book that is now open and I take it and do what read it and listen to it no he eat it digest it soak inside of it the book is now in oh give the Lord a shout the book is no longer in no the book is now in and then go th must prophesy again bring a fresh prophecy prophesy it again oh glory to God and we find out in the Book of Revelation it says seal not the prophecies and in this book for the time is at hand what time is at hand a time where you cannot change your character sit down a minute amen seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book because the time is at hand not just judgment in that sense outside but the time when you cannot change your character when the Bible say he is filthy filthy still he is Holy Holy still in other words someday this camera of God will catch you in a picture and however condition whatever condition you're in it stops you right there if it catch you righteous righteous still catch your holy holy still catch your filthy filthy still whatever condition you freeze you can't go to heaven to change you got to change here now if you can't change here now you're not going to make it to Heaven Can somebody say Amen people still going to hell you know we don't hear much about hell but people still go to hell you know direct we talk about it already so some woman she fool along she leav she husband get this other man do this and that and that going church playing piano and all kind of thing like that and then when come now time time you see time time does deliver you know all what people feel they get away and they escape and they get through and they get through time you know time she end up on the hospital bed dying and then preacher come and say if your soul right she say I didn't send for you I don't want to hear no preacher I good I good I good I do belong to your church now God send the man you know to try to get her corrected back and part you know she close to the door you know she don't want the preacher she don't want no word of warning and when she begin to die on the blood cell the brains had to break up that where the GC is CXC that where you have car and this and your house and what all that to break up now a soul to come up when a soul come up now after all them little intellectual thing break up she said I'm lost I'm lost that's a terrible place to be in you know to know that you're right to the end and you're lost and you have an opportunity to get it right to make it right everybody have a choice you know you know what you do you know you know why you do it you know you know what going in inside of you you know not that you don't know you know even Legion with all them Devils cried out to Jesus Christ a thousand devils and he see devil keeping back he Lord have mercy upon me he reached out and he cared and Jesus cared oh give the Lord some Praises my God how do I get out of here hallelujah praise God okay let's go watch in the Old Testament when a son is born into a home it was a son because it was born in a home my son is my son when he's born to me when the Pentecostal Church gave birth or found that they called the birth the new birth of the Holy Ghost they were born into the kingdom of God now Ephesians said we are predestinated unto the adoption of sons now a man in the Old Testament when he he had a born a son in the house he had a son and when he was born there was a tutor raised that child until he come of certain age and if this tutor brought word to the Father the child was worthy and all right now he was adopted into that family many of you Old Testament readers know that he was adopted into the family but if he wasn't he still remain a son but he wasn't adopted then if he was adopted he was brought out in the street put a robe on him a ceremony was made and then this boy sing year on the check meant the same as his daddy's so now the son could sign the check he's now adopted he's always a son let's come on to the message now everybody is sons and daughters but there's some going to be adopted and when they adopted they could sign the check for healing for deliverance whatever you have need of look at Peter Silver and Gold Have I None such a as I have I give it unto you he was an adopted son he said rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ and we going to have the same thing here in Trinidad and Around The World God will adopt his sons because God can't lie that's the purpose the message come to bring us to spiritual maturity and adoption oh give the Lord some praise that's the objective not baby baby baby not God at a hand your hand you that you sit down and being feeling entitled oh give the Lord some Praises but the kingdom of God is preached and every man every man pressed their way into it give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to so get off your entitled chair Glory get out your entitled seat and start to press your way into this great battle we talking about here now glory to God so what's something now here this God adopted his own son when he took him Peter James and John as a witness okay in the more of two or three Witnesses he said this is my beloved Son he him in other words there it is what he says is all of it then he is given equal of course it was God but God In the Flesh of Jesus Christ manifested himself to the people then God adopted his son now when the Pentecostal church and those people in the last days here that's beginning to find a new but being born again they thought that settled it no sir your ups and downs and ins and outs and things like that God can place you as a son so this yoyo thing up and down son more you're a sinner you're s a son s a son this yoyo thing God you had to come out of that because God know you're not even sure who you are today in church you're playing Christian tomorrow with some devils out there and your fellowshiping normal normal normal today eating nice cake and nice nice nice nice Heavenly Dove cake and tomorrow you slop from the p p how we adopting that because you put a bow eye and a pig in a house and dress him up in a suit and put it and with you know how crossbars and things ISX toxy toxo and and the ex on the back and thing now the only reason he's behaving himself is because he inside you as long as you keep that pig inside he's clean but the day that door crack open and that pig get away outside of there and when he see that P mother better keep away from all the time my God I to roll and all that toxo tox business you know because the pig and mud United Oh Glory to God the pig and is just it's just you confine the pig by laws and rules the pig stay clean but once you loose that pig he's a pig but if you change his nature he put back on he toxy though and he get a good bath oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God your nature have to change God want to change your nature oh it change your desires it change you oh give the Lord some Praises your ups and down ins and out and things like that God can place you as a son but when you stay in the kingdom here we go stay in the gospel stay right prophecy now one of these days God will call you out and set you aside and adopt you as a son before the people and give you something that will shake the nations with it oh glory to God l you know no violent to play the side you know God giving us something to shake the nation with it do you believe that God going to identify his sons confirm and vindicate his sons oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God today the dead are raised up and people say it's demonology it's psychology it's mental telepathy the people wasn't there to begin with you see the difference it's our indifference towards God has determined what we are getting today we are going to receive Divine judgment the whole world is shaking right now under the impact of the UNC creeping judgments one of the ministers will probably pick it up in a few minutes on the uncoming judgments and I hope they do however because the whole world is ready every nation is quivering don't you think that Russia isn't quivering too the United States and the islands are quivering who is going to throw the first atomic bomb and when it does it mature the whole thing out of cater watch it's right now this part reach now it is right now in the hands of wicked sinful hell bong men and your destination of this Earthly journey I said Earth's journey is left to the hands of wicked and sinful men you better watch where your soul destination is pledged for if it isn't PL towards heaven towards God tonight with all your heart don't let the old year pass away without you turning to God for your Earthly destination is determined by the hands of wicked and cruel coldhearted iotic men that is where your body is determined whatever you want to do about it now that finishes you up God be merciful oh my Hallelujah all right let's go let's start this from this morning age Brother The Seven Ages are set forth in Revelation Chapter 2 and three takes in the whole span of the fullness of the Gentiles for the whole time in which God is with the Gentiles under the Salvation in every single age by none it says the very same thing in the opening and closing the message to each age unto the message of Unto the messenger of Ephesus smna pogos Tira sadis Philadelphia laa right he an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches notice here is what Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word of that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say for that age let that soak it one man receives what the spirit says to the age not men one man and that one man in this age was William maram BR behold I send you Elijah so the spirit spoke to deprit and you'll find out it come down to debde Oh Glory to God the spirit the prophet and the bride oh give the Lord let's continue now only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false so he's not just speaking to the TR but up punch he's speaking to true and false so in this message of Malachi 4 they are true and false amen that's right don't say Amen now doesn't change it it's still a true and false you better find out if you are true but it have true and false Hallelujah and the message come to both so you can't correct false what false is false you have to stay what is true we not here to try to identify false money and false dollars if you do that we have no service we because have many false prophets many on false teachings and doctrines so we stay with your true dollar so when your false money come the bank people they checking your money like that so and they're checking normal normal and once a funny money come they hand stop the feel is different Hallelujah so we want to treat train you to truth train you to the word that once some kind of cuckoo something come you hey this hey I can say Amen to that hey something funny with that boy that a funny money oh give the Lord some Praises he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all hear the part I love you but though it is broadcast for all who come within the range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is the one has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger those who hear are not getting their own private Revelation nor is the group getting their Collective Revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God oh give the Lord some Praises so number one the elect has the ability to hear from God give the Lord a shout on that one the elect has the ability to hear from God when God speaks there's something in you could respond oh give the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah praise God glory to God Amen let's continue I've been saying right along that they are actually two churches though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they were a one here it is plainly stated that there are churches and it states just as plainly that some of those churches most evidently do not know that he is the one who searched the Reigns and the hearts he is going to prove to them that is so now what churches will be those that do not know this truth of course it is the false Vine group because the True Believers certainly know that judgment begins at the house of God and they being God-fearing judge themselves that they be not judged Oh Glory to God to the True Believer they walk in here carefree and walk in here careless they walking with the Consciousness that judgment begins at the house of God let's go let's go let's go let's fight with me now so when anas fire came into the church God loved that bright so much he he didn't want that bright to be defiled so he judged and n and saf and they died in the church to protect the church that was God protection for the elect in that day give the Lord some praises and the prophet said it will repeat again oh glory to God you could say Peter Deni Christ and Peter the Crow and all that but God was veiled in Peter's heart you can't you don't know when that happened but it happened Oh Glory to God they thought was brother Peter but God was sitting there and when they lie he said didn't lie to a man you lie to the Holy Ghost oh give the Lord some Praises that same Holy Ghost will come back back in the church Oh Glory there will be a church with Jesus walking in it oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah do we believe [Applause] that my God why does God call these churches his churches even though they are false Vine the truth of the matter is that they are all Christians but they are not Christians of the spirit all brother over it have Christian and Christian yeah have Christians of the Flesh and Christians of the spirit they are Christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain Mark 7:7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be a muhammadan is a mohammadan that is the religion no matter how he lives because he subscribes to the theory that the Quran teaches in the same way a Christian is a Christian as long as he subscribed to the fact that Jesus is the son of God born of a virgin crucified died rose again and he's a savior of mankind in fact in the loud Ean age there will be those who call themselves Christians because they subscribe to the Fine qualities of Christ Christ while reserving themselves the right to deny his deity Christian Science have done that he is a nominal Christians belongs to the church but he's not a true or spiritual believer that kind of a Believer is one who has been baptized into the body of Christ and is a member of him so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group on one hand he is praising and on the other hand he's rebuking he has told what is right with the True Believer now he warns what the false Vine must do if it is to stand Justified let's go now we find why there are two Vines one through once for we can see why Abraham had two sons one after the flesh that persecuted Isaac and one after promise now we can see how out of the same parents two boys come forth as twins one knowing and loving the things of God and the other knowing much of the same truth but not of the same spirit and hence persecuted the child that was elect God did not reprobate for the sake of reprobation he reprobated for the sake of the elect and then this is the bomb elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm elect Oh Glory to God so when you see somebody persecuting you or want to harm you you know that is they miss the election because elect can't persecute can't Hallelujah they come from the same how you persecuting they come from the same father how you persecuting why you fighting elect cannot H elect elect cannot persecute the elect it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect those reprobates are religious they are smart they are of the can line the serpent seed they build their babbles they build their cities they build their Empires all the while calling on God to destroy God elect ones but they are needed so you're not here to fight them oh glory to God the bridesmaid will always be the bridesmaid but you are the bride oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah Give the Lord some shout in the house glory to God don't bother with the bride made you are the bride his wife had made herself ready oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God you come to get the word what your husband would love you come to get the word how to please your husband you come to get the word he's coming back for her Pride that's why when the woman lost the coin she swept the floor She kep the cover out she kept on until she found what she had lost he said the church lost his brotherly love and the church WIll press on until they get back brother George that brotherly love oh GL the honey it looked like it won't stick but it will stick because faith is based upon forgiveness and if Malachi 4 was sent to back to the faith of the fathers we have the door pass through the door of Brotherly kindness oh give the Lord and Praises you have got to drop your art you have got to forgive your brother you have got to press on like you have never known [Applause] before they are needed hallelujah oh elect of God beware study closely be careful work out your salvation with fear and trembling rely upon God and be strong in his might your adversary the devil is even now going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour watch onto prayer be steadfast This is the End Time both the true and the false Vine are coming into maturity but before the weak matures those writing tears must be bound for burning they all joining the work onto the churches that is The Binding soon the Gathering of the wheat will come and right now two Spirits at work in two Vines come on from among the tears start to overcome that you might be considered praise worthy for your lord to fit to Reign and to rule with him start to overcome oh glor glory to God to overcome when a test is given start to overcome you can't parade your flesh your beef every time whatever you want to get whatever you say you want to save cannot be like that Paul said I become all things to all men that might all means I might save some you got to be discipline you got to come into order you come to line up with God's word you can just do your own thing and just come to church that can't happen that that that must not happen Give the Lord some Praises you must desire God's requirement hallah may be seated when Jonah run from the commission to go to

little Remnant that God will give him let that Remnant go to calling out to God Watch What Happens there'll be National Showdown there will be a power this is prophecy from the book that was sealed there will be a power that they have never seen before the trouble of it is this time it's going to be too late then the doors will be closed so remember we are the end time oh pray Noah was a sign of Deliverance to his people and a sign of judgment to the Lost World the very Waters that chok the world drwn the world was the only means of saving Noah the only only thing that save him was the judgment and the only thing that will save the church today is the Judgment Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God so Noah message was the mechanics and the rain coming was the Dynamics for 120 years mechanics mechanics mechanics he's prophesying it going to rain it going to rain it going to rain and when the door was shut and God shut his him him in with his family no rain first day no rain second day somebody feel led now God Noah now cat a revelation I now believe God Noah didn't shut the door he couldn't open back the door somebody banging on the ACT Noah I already know too late s days the ark preached to people who was lost s days the ark preached to people who could not be saved no more blood hallu no more toall no more token just judgment and rain fell for 40 days and 40 nights Hallelujah Dr people floating and as the rainfall no I begin to raise the only thing I'm going to save the church is the Judgment so the same Holy Ghost we're looking for is one going to judge the world because Daniel saw I saw a stone cut out without the hands of man and that stone ends the Gentile dispensation oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah listen continue oh brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year what all theology failed to do in 2,000 years you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home after the doors of the Gentile is closed God will anoint a church then he who is filthy be filthy still he is righteous to be righteous still who is Holy be holy still and God will anoint the church with the power of God and things will be taken place oh give the Lord some Praises I understand that woman will bow with their hair in the last days I understand they'll wear short clothes walk with high heel shoes tinkling as they go I understand that moral will be so low in the last days I understand that the preachers will be false shepherds in the last days that will compromise and will not feed the people the word of God we'll go after Crees and things instead but I understand there will be a voice coming in the last days crying out of the Wilderness calling the people back to the original message back to the things of God I understand by the look those things will take place I understand in the last days there'll come a famine the churches will be so organized and so set that the last day will be a famine not for bread and water only but for the hearing of the true word of God not for Bibles they have tons of that not for tapes they have tons of that but for the hearing oh of the true of God and the people will go from the East and from the west from the north and from the south seeking to hear the true of God but the churches will be so organized and tighten up they will fail to hear it oh give the Lord a shout in the house I understand he will send Elijah before that end time he will have a message that will turn the heart of the children back to the fathers and turn them back to the original go back again I understand here we go that will take place just before the spirit leave the Gentile church and return to the Jews so before God could deal with the Jews you have to take the spirit out of the Gentile church and he said we will be here preaching to the Eternal l oh glory to God the spirit going to be in the bride no Spirit left for salvation no Spirit left for people to come to the altar to be saved the time is now the time to repent is now the time to make it right is now the spirit will leave the Gentiles and go to the Jews Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God praise God he said now we live through the westan age of Pentecostal age with the Bap Holy Ghost we are shaping up all the time this rejected Stone cut out of the mountain without what without hands God sent it do you see the rejected stone is the head the Capstone and the Very one that was rejected to the Gentile is Christ and Christ was not cut and put by a Vicor or Son of God by some dignitary he is the Holy Spirit and the cap of the per where Christ coming so the holy spirit is right there on top of Brotherly kindness so brotherly kindness is the attraction for the Holy Spirit to come oh my Hallelujah they never they put the cap Stone on the pyramid it wasn't cut by man's hand it's God hand that cut that stone oh my watch so watch you see it it hit the image right smack in the feet and broke it to Pieces grung it into powder what happened at that time the coming of that stone up when the church into Glory at the Rapture because it ended the Gentile dispensation amen here it is God ended it with the coming of that stone so we talking looking for the Capstone super Church super race but the Capstone itself coming to end the Gentile dispensation oh here it is he is Christ is that stone he was born of a man he wasn't born of a man he was born of God he's coming for a church that is reborn Again by the spirit of God because the strength of that headstone runs all through the church like a magnet we have got to be magnetized to The Headstone that headstone is the Holy Ghost Christ that every one of us that got the magnetism of the Holy Spirit when that stone strike the image the church will flee to it back into Glory that's why I said the Rapture is not outside in it's inside out and if you have the magnetism inside of you and the Capstone come it will pick you up you have to go because it's connected to what's inside of you oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah he said the Jews are in their Homeland they are we at the End of the Age ready for the Rapture the Rapture comes the church goes up we are caught up to meet him in the ear we all know that that stone was cut out without the mountains is ready to come at any time and when it comes when it does it does away with the Gentile age it's all over God completely quits dealing with them let him that filthy be filthy still let him that is Holy be holy still see what he does then he takes away his church the Holy Ghost filled not message Believers it's not the same thing he takes away his church the Holy Ghost filled what's the filthy question that's the sleeping virgin and them come up for judgment way over here so God call the sleeping versions or the foolish versions filthy so our job now is to get the oil give me oil in my me

time oh glory to God don't come out of time in Inspiration Hallelujah my God he said now these days watch the voice of the throne Before the Throne was Seven Stars voice of the Stars voices um from the throne proceed light in thousand of voices not one voice voices plural what is it God speaking to the church reflecting himself through the seven spirits when the true anointed of God speaks it's the voice of God to reject it is to remove the can stick nowadays we don't believe in say hell in the Pulpit he said Mercy we need men who won't hold back now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can't preach to people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people of Simon let your Simon be lived and it's the voice of God a lived sermon is the voice of God that will bring reproach to them who reject it they will say no one can put a thinger on his of her life they are sweet living if there ever was a man of God is that man or that woman see live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you get mixed up and messed up you get people tangled up and and you ruin them and yourself too just live the sermon the preacher is called to preaches and to live it too if you can't live it then stop preaching it you're supposed to live your sermons all right there was voices then he says this here how we need in jonville thousands of live voices the Thunder of godallah thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity unify lines walking around the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the Thunder against the enemy read Christians then he went on further the devil don't care how L you holla devil don't care how much you jump and how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see a Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be move right on that throws him away that Thunder that shakes the devil so there is a thunder that shakes the devil and there's a thunder that does not shake the devil Oh Glory to God hallelujah we want the Thunder that shakes the devil when the devil see you they say come move move move move move he coming he coming he coming the bride coming he bride coming the Bri move on move on move on move on oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah you said if he could speak like Billy Graham or orbert or a great influential speaker sometime the devil just laugh at that he don't pay no more attention to that than nothing you get all the theology you want all the Seminary training devil sit back and laugh at that but when he sees that life look at those disciples down there that Maniac child that day with epilepsy saying come on come out of him devil come out of him devil come out of him devil devil sitting right there and said now aren't you making a shame of yourself you see what you're doing Jesus told devil talk about Jesus told you and commission you to cast me out not one of you could do it but brother when they see him come walking quietly he didn't have to say nothing the devil was already scared right then he know he had to leave because here comes a life not a sermon but a life what did the prophet said this being Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience when is completed is the servant of God in the Church of God that's going in Rapture he never said this message he man preach he said there being when it's completed Hallelujah that being has to be completed in you God has to Veil himself in you glory to God from Tabernacle to the heart but Isaac preached that God want to step into your 16 elements he want to step into your flesh do you believe that you see my flesh is filthy God go burn and clean that up and sanctify that and step into it oh give the Lord some Praises Glory remember a loud clapping noise of Thunder is the voice of God so a thunder is the voice of God and that's is what I shake the devil Oh Glory to God not just one Thunder but seven of them Oh Glory every aent Thunders hit the devil full blue every day every age the devil get licks and blows from the elected church and in this last day seven tunders utter the voices and thre the voices out and I am saying this morning seven tunders that will be a bride and when the book was open seven tunders thre the voices out and God told John go to the angel and said give me the book so if we eat the book we have the Thunders in us go give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God does the bride have a voice will the bride have a voice glory to God let's see if we could hit the home CH here right now Hallelujah said right now Paul said I so I planted Apollo watered but God gave the increase William brandham he planted and God sent a fightful Ministry with a Kang to water the seeds that the prophet planted because we cannot bring our own seed one man here from the spirit oh give the Lord some praises and that comes to the prophet so the prophet put the seeds and books and tapes he said I am just here to lay those seeds I hope that there men come behind to make more sense to it he didn't stop there and hope to bring these seeds to life so it cannot stay on the books and tapes it have to hit your flesh and your faith oh give the Lord some Praises this seed we are preaching here is the bride seed so William Bram Malachi 4 he planted a fightful Ministry come behind to water the seeds not new seeds not their own seeds no but the same seeds in other words to bring the same prophecy over the bride because what you have to get is the SE the prophecy over you you have to know what is prophesied on your behalf glory to God are you with me now hallelujah praise God will this bride be God's mouthpiece because the Bible said the spirit and the bride say come that means the bride going to speak so just be but a brand I'm speaking or Elijah speaking the bride will have a voice oh glory to God hallelujah let's go but around and this is the home stretch we are now in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin to song the scriptures the mystery of God should be finished as he have declared to his the prophets there it is he is sending a Vindicated Prophet he's sending a prophet almost of after 2,000 years he is sending someone who is far from organization education the world of religion and watch as John the Baptist and Elijah of old he will hear only from God he will have thust say the Lord and speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece And he as it is declared in Malachi 4 will turn the hearts of the TR back to the fathers not he Plus you don't have some something plus Ultra Plus and this plus and whatnot not he and he shall turn the hearts of the children not he plus a man from Trinidad a man from America he plus a man from South America a man from Africa man from Europe not he plus nothing God said behold I send Elijah he shall that's a job for he all right he shall turn H TR back to the faith of the fathers he will bring back the elect of of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones are you ready who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and before him his works oh glory mean the pride will be his body The Pride will be his voice The Pride will perform his works that's what he said a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word Lutheran spoke for God at that time and they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and Creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley he was the voice of the word in this day the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles great and known of all men for their generation when the Methodist fail God rais up others so it has gone on through the years until in this last day are you ready in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be will be the final voice to the final age Oh Glory to God so there brother man had his voice in the days of The Voice but the pride will be the final voice to the final age he came at the end of the seventh age but God bur open a pride age and the pride will be the final voice glory to God let's go are you right with me now the church is no longer the mount piece of God it is his own Mount piece so God is turning on her on the church in the message God going and turn on them and here what this this powerful word is here now he will conf found found her through the prophet and the bride Oh Glory to God the prophet is gone but he will confound her to the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her oh I can finish right here now right with me right with me right with me now right with me now glory to God the voice of God in the last days The Voice will be in the bride he will confound her that word confound means cause a surprise or confusion especially by not according to their expectation they'll be so confused Oh Glory to God that's that's the confound confounded by the prophet and the bride confounded or confused or baffled or perplexed with uncertainty Oh Glory to God question will the bride have a voice yes it is for in the last chapter of Revelation the 17 it said the spirit but I'm reading now he said the spirit and the bright said come he said once more the world will hear direct from God hold it hold it the world heard direct from God through Malachi 4 but once more the world will hear direct from God not through books and tapes not that way but from the bride because the voice of God will be oh give the Lord a praise oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word Bible be repudiated as in the first age you may be seated now we had cried out to this age you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking into pieces taking what you want leaving out what you don't want you are not interested in living it but debate in it I would rather have you with hot or cold if you were cold and rejected it I could stand that if you would get white hot to know it's truth and live it I could praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it and return must refuse to honor you I will spew you out because you know me you no at me oh what to God the church will hot a cold best of all she should be fervent H but she is not sentence has to be passed let's continue she's no longer God's voice to the world she will maintain that she is but God says not God still has a voice for the people of the world he's not talking about himself let's let me read it now God still has a voice of the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride am that voice is in the Bride As we have said and we will talk more about that later oh praise God hallelujah listen to this one now I'm feeling good now almost finished but Bram there's a voice last days there are so many voices on the Earth today that is absolutely a Harding because it deadens the voice of the supernatural there are so many intellectual voices great voices of mighty men who are intellectual and in their intellectual condition they even shake the Nations they are not overnight people but they Shake Nations being in great organization together and a person would be confused and say how could these things raise up and and it causes the voice of God to be placed way back somewhere now hear this so brother Branham is about to State what we will state now yes he stating it for us and the voice of God they see how will we know it's the voice of God because then it wasn't the Vindicated Prophet so he's talking like if he's here right now that we' be looking back and say how we will know is the voice of God because in William brandham it was an evated prophet he said well now today how we know is the voice of God because it's the manifestation of the prophet's word he was Vindicated Malachi 4 he was a Vindicated 20th cury Prophet how would we know it's a Vindicated word today it will be a manifestation of what the prophet prophesy how could we know what the prophet prophesy if the book is not unsealed seal not the says of the prophecy of this book how we could prophesy if we haven't gone to the angel to take the book oh give the Lord some praises and that scripture started Revelation 108 not 7 8 seven is the days of the voice but it says hallelujah I Heard a Voice said go to the angel Hallelujah in other words go to B boss oh give the Lord a shout go to the one that called The Prophet go to the mighty Angel and ask for the book direct who's doing that the bride give me the book and then take it eat it in your mouth sweet like honey and your belly bitter when you have to stand for the truth stand for what is Right stand up to your husband if your husband doing foolishness in the house stand and tell him that's not the word praise God stand tell your wife and that's not the word Oh Glory to God you have to stand that's the bit in the belly Oh Glory to God if it's not bit in the belly you only chewing it like chewing gum it a going on inside yet but when you eat that word something had to happen on the inside It Rock your system Oh Glory to God it's sweet in the mouth because Revelation is sweet oh give the Lord some shes how do we know it's the voice of God because it's the manifestation of the prophet's word this is God's prophet and the true voice of God only brings back that real living Supernatural God with a supernatural word with a supernatural Spirit manif true word all right praise God mus come please hallelujah hallelujah my Lord hallelujah and you will see where I get the title from now I'll leave that at the very end the last war of the spirit this is the last warning there will not be another the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paved

streets with joy yes yes it's the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over but thank God at this moment this age is not over he's yet crying his cry is only in the spiritual ears of men by the spirit but once again a prophet is in the Land once more God will reveal the truth as is to Paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the loudest and age his Messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who receive the prophet in his own name will receive the benefit effect of that prophet's Ministry and

ago to the young people and that was before the year 2000 so we were really young brother Anthony and back then we talking about Y2K is coming and the year 2000 is coming and now I'm watching 2023 come to an end and watching 2024 staring Us in the face and to see how time has just moved on and time is not stopping and and the reality is nothing is a surprise to God God is not saying oops look what happened and this happened and that happened God is looking at his clock he's looking at his time piece he looking at his plan and we are walking in his plan so I want you to take courage I want you to walk with a smile on your face I want you to approach your trials and the testings knowing that God will never give you more than you can bear so lift up your head lift up your shoulder shoulder and approach this week with the faith and the confidence that he who started the work in you he who called you he who chose you he who predestinated you you he who wrote In His will and testament that upon his death you could effect and access what he promised for you and he died to make sure that his will could be affected and then came back as the enforcer to make sure that no that nothing stands in your way of accessing your inheritance that he left for you so walk with that confidence and with that Dominion this week May God richly bless you stay in the atmosphere stay in prayer practice the presence of God and walk with confidence knowing that God is with you and great is he that's in you and he that's in the world and may God richly bless you and looking for a
