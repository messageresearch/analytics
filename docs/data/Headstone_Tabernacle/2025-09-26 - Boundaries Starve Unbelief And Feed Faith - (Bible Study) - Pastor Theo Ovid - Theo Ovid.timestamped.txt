[8:18] When we praise, when we praise,

[8:26] Hands are praise when we praise,
[8:32] consuming every part. Because we know
[8:38] that the God we serve will make his
[8:42] presence known
[8:44] when we pray.
[8:49] When we pray
[8:51] [Music]
[8:53] when we praise, when we praise,
[8:58] there should be a fire in our hearts and
[9:02] a praise. and praise.
[9:07] We are consuming every part because we
[9:12] know

[9:17] presence known when we praise.
[9:24] When we praise,
[9:27] oh when we praise, when we praise, there
[9:33] should be a fire and lift your hands and
[9:36] say, "Hands of praise. When we praise,
[9:42] consuming
[9:44] we pray." Because we know
[9:48] that the God we serve will make his
[9:52] presence known when we pray.
[9:58] When we praise. Oh, give him praise
[10:01] tonight. Hallelujah.
[10:04] We praise you, Lord. Hallelujah. Thank
[10:06] you, Jesus. Oh, there's a fire in my
[10:10] heart. Oh, your savior, your redeemer.
[10:16] You're consuming every part because we
[10:21] know
[10:23] that the God we serve will make his
[10:27] presence know when

[10:54] [Music]
[10:56] Oh, give him praise tonight. Thank you,
[10:57] Jesus. I
[11:01] want to be more like you,
[11:05] Jesus. inside.
[11:09] Want to be more like you.
[11:14] Oh, I want to be a vessel you work
[11:18] through. And I
[11:21] want to be more like you.
[11:25] Oh, with all your heart. Oh,
[11:30] I want to be more like you,
[11:34] Jesus.
[11:36] So I
[11:39] want to be more like you.
[11:43] Oo I want to be a vessel
[11:47] by you and I
[11:51] want to be more like you. Well that's
[11:54] it. Just one more time. Oh Lord
[11:58] I
[12:01] more like you.
[12:04] Oh Jesus,
[12:06] I
[12:08] want to be more like you.
[12:13] Oh, I want to be a vessel to work
[12:18] through and I
[12:21] want to be more.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. We
[12:26] thank God tonight to be here and God
[12:29] bless you all and we certainly
[12:31] appreciate all of you stepping forward
[12:33] to be here tonight. Let's bless a
[12:36] prayer.
[12:38] We want to remember brother Alman
[12:41] of Migos Nigeria. Please pray for to God
[12:43] to grant me healing touch from every
[12:45] ailment in my body. Let's pray. Heavenly
[12:47] Father, we thank you for this great
[12:50] opportunity to gather in your presence
[12:52] in this virtual setting and I pray that
[12:55] your holy spirit will move through the
[12:56] atmosphere, Father, and minister to each
[12:58] one to brother man, Father God, Wayne
[13:00] Logos, Father. I pray visit him touching
[13:03] from the crown of the head to the soul
[13:04] of his feet. May he be healed and
[13:06] delivered completely in the name of
[13:08] Jesus. And as we approach your word
[13:10] tonight, may your presence be with us
[13:12] this special time in study in your word.
[13:16] May it light up your people. May their
[13:19] mind be transformed and changed from a a
[13:21] a whole different view from how they
[13:23] view things, how they view you, how you
[13:25] view your nature, your ways, your word,
[13:28] your truth, because you said you shall
[13:30] know the truth and the truth shall set
[13:32] us free. So, Father, come with your
[13:33] truth tonight and speak to us by your
[13:35] word. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And
[13:38] amen. So, God bless you. And if you have
[13:40] your Bibles, I'd like you to turn to Job
[13:43] chapter 14. We're going to read five
[13:45] verses dear. And um strange scripture to
[13:49] read tonight, but we're going to have
[13:51] that tonight. And the title of what I
[13:54] want to share with you tonight is
[13:56] boundaries starve unbelief
[13:59] and feed faith. And I want to connect
[14:02] with what brother has been on
[14:05] dismantling unbelief. I just like those
[14:07] two words that combination. Mash it up,
[14:10] break it up, destroy it, wreck it.
[14:13] dismantling unbelief. Job 14:1-5.
[14:17] Man that is born of a woman is of a few
[14:20] days and full of trouble. He cometh
[14:24] forth like a flower and is cut down. He
[14:26] fleth also as a shadow and contin
[14:31] thou open thine eyes upon such and one
[14:34] and bringest me into judgment with thee?
[14:37] Who can bring a clean thing out of
[14:39] unclean? Not one. Seeing
[14:43] his days are determined,
[14:46] the number of his months are with thee.
[14:49] Thou has appointed his bounds
[14:52] that he cannot pass.
[14:54] And from this scripture, seeing his days
[14:57] are determined, the number of his months
[15:00] are with thee, thou has appointed his
[15:03] bounds that he cannot pass. And this is
[15:06] where I want to talk a bit about
[15:07] boundary.
[15:10] boundaries.
[15:12] You know, Jesus,
[15:14] the Bible said in Matthew 13:58,
[15:17] he did not many mighty works there
[15:20] because of their unbelief.
[15:23] Mark 6:6,
[15:26] "And he marveled because of their
[15:28] unbelief, and he went round about the
[15:31] village teaching."
[15:34] I think brother Redhead read this one.
[15:36] Hebrews 3:12, "Take heed, brethren, lest
[15:38] there be in any of you an evil heart of
[15:42] unbelief in departing from the living
[15:45] God." And we know that they could not
[15:47] enter in because of unbelief.
[15:52] So there has to be a way
[15:55] of
[15:57] dismantling this unbelief
[15:59] and it's not dismantling just matter of
[16:02] dismantling unbelief but dismantling
[16:04] unbelief also mean replacing it with
[16:06] fate that truly comes from the word
[16:10] prayer dedication and consecration. Now
[16:13] what are boundaries?
[16:15] Boundaries are limits or guidelines that
[16:19] defines where something ends and another
[16:23] begins. So when God say he have set us
[16:26] boundaries, it means he set us a limit.
[16:31] He talk about three score on 10 and if
[16:33] by virtue of grace you get an extension
[16:35] praise. But he has set boundaries over
[16:38] man. Boundaries align edges and limits.
[16:42] Example, a fence mark the boundaries
[16:44] between two properties.
[16:46] Boundaries are also in personal and
[16:48] relationship to protect your well-being
[16:51] and define what you are comfortable
[16:53] with. Boundaries is what will cause you
[16:56] to say no when you don't want to do
[16:58] something.
[17:00] There are also geographical boundaries
[17:02] between nations and countries.
[17:05] There are also in abstract terms
[17:08] boundaries in limiting your thought and
[17:10] behavior. The Bible talk about bringing
[17:12] every thought into captivity of Jesus
[17:15] Christ. So boundaries are limits that
[17:19] protects,
[17:21] define
[17:23] and give structure to relationships.
[17:26] Now God is a God of order. That is why
[17:29] he set boundaries
[17:31] strange enough for himself,
[17:34] by his word, and by his character and
[17:37] for his creation. And maybe you never
[17:39] thought of it that God actually set
[17:42] boundaries
[17:44] to himself. God is infinite. God is
[17:48] sovereign. And he chooses to act within
[17:52] the boundaries of his own word. That's
[17:54] why he told Adam, "The day you eat
[17:57] thereof, that day you shall surely die."
[18:01] He couldn't come around and say, "Oh
[18:02] gosh, it's my son. As is you pass
[18:05] through the back door, you don't have to
[18:06] die." No, he has to keep his word. He is
[18:10] limited by the boundaries of his own
[18:12] word. And in Psalms 84:34, he said, "My
[18:15] covenant will I not break, nor alter the
[18:20] thing that is gone out of my lips." So
[18:24] once God speaks it, he binds himself to
[18:28] what he speaks.
[18:31] He cannot go back on it.
[18:34] Numbers 23-9 says, "God is not a man
[18:37] that he should lie.
[18:40] Neither the son of man that he should
[18:42] repent. Hath he said and shall he not do
[18:46] it? Hath he spoken? Shall he not make it
[18:49] good?" And Isaiah says, "My word shall
[18:52] not return unto me void." So whatever is
[18:55] gone out of his lips, he cannot alter
[18:59] it. God is also bound by the boundaries
[19:02] of his holiness.
[19:04] God is also bound by the boundaries of
[19:09] his promises and his covenant. That's
[19:12] why in times of Noah, he said, "I will
[19:14] not destroy the earth again by water."
[19:18] Genesis 9:11, "And I will establish my
[19:20] covenant with you, neither shall all
[19:22] flesh be cut off anymore by waters of a
[19:25] flood, neither shall there anymore be a
[19:27] flood to destroy the earth."
[19:30] the token of the covenant which I make
[19:33] between me and you and every living
[19:35] creature that is with you for perpetual
[19:37] generations. I do set my bow in the
[19:40] cloud. It shall be a token of a covenant
[19:43] between me and the earth. So God b
[19:47] himself by promises but bind himself by
[19:50] covenants. And then God sets boundaries
[19:54] for his creation
[19:56] in nature. Genesis 1:9 and God said,
[19:59] "Let the waters under the heavens be
[20:01] gathered together unto one place, and
[20:02] let the dry land appear." It was so. So
[20:06] God set the moon, stars to govern the
[20:08] waves, the tides. He set things in
[20:12] order. God sets moral and spiritual
[20:16] boundaries. And that is how he put the
[20:19] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[20:21] and tell them, "Thou shalt not eat of
[20:23] it."
[20:24] God also set human boundaries. In Acts
[20:27] 19:17-26 it says, "And had made of one
[20:31] blood all nations of men to dwell on all
[20:35] the face of the earth and had determined
[20:39] the times before appointed and the
[20:43] bounds of the habitation." So God knew
[20:46] exactly where man would live. There's
[20:49] also boundaries of e for evil. And this
[20:53] is what he said in Job. Job 1:2, God
[20:56] allowed Satan to test Job. He said,
[21:00] "Behold, he's in thine hand, but save
[21:02] his life." So when Satan fought from the
[21:06] presence of the Lord and smoke Job with
[21:09] sore boils from the sole of his foot
[21:11] unto his crown. So Satan was limited as
[21:16] to how far he could go with Job. Isn't
[21:20] that something tonight? So God have
[21:22] boundaries for himself. God have
[21:25] boundaries for his people. And I was
[21:29] thinking about it because this thing
[21:31] was, how to say it, riding me. And I
[21:34] realized that boundaries could be
[21:37] applied to your personal life
[21:40] as seen as discipline.
[21:44] And this is a word we have struck many a
[21:47] times. This is a word young people don't
[21:49] like to hear because they want to do
[21:52] their own thing. you want to, you know,
[21:53] but as we taught before, there's a cost
[21:57] of freedom. The cost of freedom. I want
[22:01] to be free. I can't wait till I reach
[22:03] 18. I can't wait for this and that and
[22:05] the other. And when we look at the
[22:08] children of Israel coming out of Egypt
[22:10] for 400 years, this people generation
[22:12] after generations in bondage. And when
[22:15] they got the freedom that they desired,
[22:17] the freedom that they was longing after,
[22:19] they messed up.
[22:21] They're messed up because freedom
[22:23] carries a price.
[22:26] That is why there are some people stuck
[22:28] to be bound,
[22:30] stuck in what they are in. Because when
[22:34] you are slave, you don't have to have
[22:36] responsibility.
[22:38] You don't have to have ownership.
[22:41] You they give you food. They tell you
[22:45] when to sleep. They give you drink. They
[22:48] beat you. They they make you work but
[22:51] you are not in charge of you. And that
[22:53] is why when they came out of Egypt, the
[22:55] issue wasn't coming out of Egypt. The
[22:57] issue is how could God get Egypt out of
[22:59] them?
[23:01] And many people come out from the world,
[23:03] come into church, not Christ just yet,
[23:06] come to church, come as believers and so
[23:08] on like that. But what the objective is
[23:11] to get you not just out of Egypt, but
[23:14] get Egypt out of you. And that is where
[23:17] that first word terminology called
[23:19] church comes from as the called out
[23:21] ones. But remember, God is not calling
[23:24] you out just to say you are called out.
[23:27] God is calling you out to go into
[23:29] something. He doesn't call us out just
[23:31] to call us out. He called us out into a
[23:34] possession, into a promised land, into
[23:37] the Holy Ghost, into what is promised
[23:40] for us at this very hour. Now, some
[23:43] people come out, but they haven't gone
[23:45] in. And that is where the problem lies.
[23:47] That is where the uncertainty lies. That
[23:49] is where the unbelief lies. And we find
[23:52] out that the people that came out of
[23:53] Egypt was a mixed multitude. It had
[23:56] Dayton. It had Kora. It had a lot of
[23:59] real troublesome characters that they
[24:01] was just with the crowd that was on
[24:03] their way out. And in addition, because
[24:06] of the people's unbelief, God said, "I
[24:08] will not let you go over your children
[24:10] would, but you won't. You would stay
[24:12] there. You would go 40 years until the
[24:15] carcass dropped and die and God saw it
[24:19] that that generation did not go in
[24:21] except Joshua and Caleb and their
[24:23] children is to cross over. So unbelief
[24:27] is really something that God hates. It
[24:29] disturbs the rhythm of things. Unbelief
[24:32] even affected Jesus ministry when he was
[24:35] on the fields and so on like that. So
[24:37] God really desires a dismantling of this
[24:40] thing called unbelief that we could have
[24:42] all faith because all things are
[24:44] possible to them that believe not only
[24:47] with God. How you think about that? Like
[24:49] they say all things are possible with
[24:50] God. Yes. But he said all things are
[24:52] possible to them that believe. And when
[24:55] that centurion man came to Jesus and he
[24:58] said Lord my servant is sick of the
[25:00] devil. Now remember he was not a
[25:02] baptized believer. He was not a
[25:03] Christian. He was an ordinary man that
[25:05] saw something. He saw that Jesus was
[25:08] under authority and he said it to Jesus.
[25:10] He explained the basis of his faith in
[25:13] telling him speak the word. He said I I
[25:15] am a man under authority. I say to one
[25:17] go we go it. I say the one come and he
[25:19] cometh. You just speak the word. I'm not
[25:22] worthy for you to come under my roof.
[25:25] Just speak. And Jesus said he had not
[25:28] seen faith like that in Israel. It was a
[25:30] gentile. It was a soldier. It was a man
[25:33] that was concerned about his servant.
[25:35] and to show you that God goes past your
[25:39] background, your race, your color, your
[25:41] creed, whatever it is. Once faith is
[25:43] presented, there's a response.
[25:46] He didn't ask you to join a church. He
[25:49] didn't ask you if you're this, how long
[25:51] you're in sin. No, he's looking for this
[25:53] currency called fate. You know, as we
[25:55] see already, if you go to America, you
[25:57] can't go with TT dollars. You can't
[25:59] spend TT dollars in America. You have to
[26:01] convert your money to US dollars because
[26:03] that is the only money they' recognize.
[26:05] Well, God's currency is a currency of
[26:08] faith. That's the only thing he
[26:09] recognize. Not your tears. You're
[26:10] crying. You're crying. And if you cry
[26:13] with faith, fine. But if you're just
[26:14] crying like it's onion in your eyes,
[26:16] that's a different thing all together.
[26:17] So the tears is will move God. Is the
[26:20] faith that will move God. Just like the
[26:22] Hebrew boy said, we shall not bow down
[26:24] even if our God don't deliver us. In
[26:27] other words, they are standing
[26:28] regardless. So I wanted to share that
[26:30] with you tonight. So let's go a little
[26:33] further. Praise God. So therefore,
[26:34] boundaries
[26:37] are limits set to protect you. And I
[26:42] want to see if I could sh get a mind
[26:44] shift tonight. You know, like people,
[26:47] young people in particular will say,
[26:48] well, you know, I feel bound. I feel I
[26:51] feel like limited and whatnot. And they
[26:53] figure that this thing is to ent trap
[26:55] them and to enclose them not and not see
[26:57] it as a view of protecting.
[27:00] The boundaries part is to protect you
[27:04] your well-being, protect your values.
[27:08] The discipline part here we go is to
[27:11] train yourself
[27:13] how to stay
[27:17] within those boundaries. That is where
[27:20] discipline comes in. Now, brother Isaac
[27:24] spoke about Samson and Samson had
[27:27] encounter with I think two women before
[27:29] he end up with Delilah. Samson keep
[27:33] pushing the boundaries.
[27:35] He keep going beyond where God want him
[27:39] to go. And the way a tree leans, that's
[27:42] the way it falls. If you want to push
[27:45] and you're pushing in the wrong
[27:46] direction, you will end up in the wrong
[27:49] place. That the same thing with Lot. Lot
[27:52] pitches them towards Sodom. Not Sodom
[27:54] yet, just just towards. But he end up
[27:57] right there. He end up without
[27:59] considering and weighing out the
[28:00] secondary consequences of going down to
[28:03] Sodom. He could have handled it. Not his
[28:05] wife, not his family. And that is where
[28:09] things crash. So sometime we as parents
[28:12] we as leaders we sometimes could think
[28:15] we handling certain things but the
[28:17] others that we in charge of or the
[28:18] others we are connected with could they
[28:20] handle it. So we have to be careful in
[28:24] our decision making and the choices that
[28:26] we take in life without taking a pause
[28:30] to look at secondary consequences.
[28:34] Yes, you could be strong and your the
[28:36] Lord and your faith and everything else,
[28:39] but be careful. And this is where this
[28:41] is a weighted service tonight. A
[28:43] weighted something tonight. And I'm
[28:44] seeing it in such a different context of
[28:47] this thing called boundaries.
[28:49] All right. So the Bible said in Proverbs
[28:53] 25:28,
[28:55] "He that hath no rule over his own
[28:59] spirit is like a city that is broken
[29:02] down and without walls." Let me read it
[29:06] again. He that hath no rule over his own
[29:11] spirit is like a city that is broken
[29:15] down and without walls.
[29:19] Boundaries like city walls keep you
[29:23] protected.
[29:24] Discipline is coming to the position to
[29:29] rule your own spirit.
[29:32] There are many people want to rule
[29:33] others. They want to rule other things.
[29:36] They want to be in power. They want to
[29:38] have influence just like how today there
[29:40] are people called influencers. But they
[29:42] themselves are not in a position to rule
[29:45] their own selves. And before we can
[29:48] effectively rule others and other
[29:50] things, we have to have the rule over
[29:54] our own lives. And this is exactly what
[29:58] what Jesus God example seed son he did
[30:02] when he got the Holy Ghost. He was led
[30:04] by the spirit into the wilderness to
[30:07] defeat the devil and overcome the lust
[30:09] of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and
[30:11] the pride of life. So therefore, he was
[30:13] a true conqueror. So when he came to the
[30:16] temple and pick up the book and says the
[30:17] spirit is upon me and they thought he
[30:19] reading text that was a overcoming man
[30:22] not with a placard not with a a stamp
[30:26] not with a thing a pin over his chest
[30:28] like a s over his chest like Superman
[30:30] but conquering humility conquering by
[30:33] the word conquering because he kept the
[30:36] boundaries of the word the devil asks
[30:38] him he know you know he's hungry and
[30:40] listen the devil know where you're at
[30:43] he's tracking you as an elect, as a
[30:46] bride member, as in the body of Christ,
[30:48] as a Christian, he is tracking. So he
[30:50] knew Jesus was hungry. So he is not
[30:53] going to see a man hungry and offer him
[30:55] a motor car. That is not even a
[30:57] temptation. That is wasting time. Hunger
[31:00] means this man need food.
[31:02] So the temptation came along that exact
[31:04] line. If thou be the son of God, turn
[31:08] the stone into bread. In other words,
[31:11] follow my instructions. Now, if Jesus
[31:13] could have done it, he could have done
[31:15] it. But that would have been listening
[31:17] to the devil.
[31:19] That would be obeying the voice of the
[31:21] enemy. He said, "Man shall live by bread
[31:24] alone. I'm hungry." Yes, I need bread.
[31:27] Yes, but it's not by bread alone we live
[31:30] by. We live by every word that proceed
[31:33] out of the mouth of God. So, he was
[31:35] clearly in this connection with God that
[31:39] he's not going to deviate from the word.
[31:42] So when the devil recognize this man is
[31:44] on the word, he's come now to give him
[31:46] an offer. The scriptures say that the
[31:49] angel will hold you up if you if you
[31:52] jump from a high building, if you that
[31:53] you shall not dash your foot against a
[31:55] stone. Do it. Show off. Parade your
[31:58] beef, show your flesh, display how much
[32:00] power you have.
[32:03] And Jesus answer him by the word. The
[32:05] final test was all these kingdoms are
[32:08] mine. You don't have to go to the cross.
[32:11] You don't have to pay the price. You
[32:12] don't have to go to Calvary. Just
[32:15] worship me and I will be the CEO in the
[32:18] back. You just the front man and I'll be
[32:21] in the background there. You don't have
[32:22] to go through that pain and suffering.
[32:23] And Jesus handling by the word. It is
[32:26] also written. It is also written. We
[32:27] know that. So I want you to see that
[32:31] boundaries are not to restrict you and
[32:33] restrain you, but it's to protect you.
[32:37] And Paul himself says, "I keep my body
[32:41] and bring it into subjection." So Paul
[32:44] himself says that he has to do that lest
[32:47] after he preached the gospel, he becomes
[32:49] a cast away. So he wasn't putting
[32:51] himself above the saints, above the
[32:53] believers where he's Paul, he's prophet
[32:55] Paul and all things work together for
[32:57] good and all the fancy scriptures we put
[32:59] put around without the discipline.
[33:02] Understand this. God told Joshua, I have
[33:04] given you the land. Could you imagine
[33:07] your aunt say I've given you the car or
[33:09] I've given you the house or some uncles
[33:11] have given you this. God have given you
[33:12] but you have to fight for it.
[33:15] Listen carefully.
[33:17] The lazy man who say there's a land in
[33:19] the streets that we not going out to
[33:21] work going out at all is dead.
[33:24] The thing of it is we sometime miss the
[33:27] fine print. We hear the general
[33:30] statement I have given you the land. The
[33:32] land is mine. You sing a song on it. You
[33:33] write a special on it and for that's
[33:35] fine. He's singing that, but yet he
[33:38] comes and say the fine print, every
[33:40] place you put your foot is yours. So you
[33:42] could use binoculars, you can look at
[33:44] the land, east, west, north, and south,
[33:45] big mountain where you going to put your
[33:47] house, your white house, and everything
[33:48] else. If you don't cross Jordan and put
[33:51] your foot on that land and begin to
[33:54] conquer, you're wasting time. And what
[33:57] it discover and we we strike it I think
[33:59] by the time is that when God tell him
[34:01] meditate day and night and from the
[34:04] river here to Jordan to wherever
[34:06] wherever shall be your coast that wasn't
[34:08] everything but that was and I like this
[34:11] that was what was immediately available
[34:14] for them to conquer and I begin to think
[34:18] what do we have in our lives that we
[34:21] could immediately begin to conquer I
[34:24] want you to think about that while we go
[34:25] forward we going to get back to that.
[34:27] All right. So, you know, sometimes
[34:29] again, you think conquering and it's a
[34:31] big thing and you have this temptation
[34:33] and this trial and and this big thing in
[34:35] front of you, but the Bible said little
[34:37] by little. God has an approach for
[34:40] possession. It wasn't everything. Little
[34:43] by little. How do you save money? When
[34:46] you get $100,000, you start to save.
[34:50] So you're buying the snow cone, you're
[34:52] buying the doubles, you're buying the
[34:53] this, you're buying, you're buying,
[34:54] buying by by your secondary name is buy
[34:58] or buy. First name is buy, second name
[34:59] is buy. You're buying buying buying.
[35:01] You're not considering saving for a
[35:03] rainy day. You start to save when you
[35:05] start to save.
[35:07] That's when you start to save. Whether
[35:09] it's $10, $5, $1,5. But if you're not
[35:12] saving, you are not saving. Then you
[35:14] have to be will say you have to be lying
[35:16] to yourself believing you're getting
[35:18] somewhere that you accumulate a down
[35:19] payment for anything. Yo you are
[35:21] actually lying to yourself. It's a big
[35:23] set of unbelief when you get this you
[35:25] will save. When you will get that you
[35:26] will save. You're not saving nothing
[35:29] because you don't have the discipline to
[35:31] save. And that is why if God can't trust
[35:33] with $100 why should he give you a
[35:35] thousand? You want 10,000 but you can't
[35:38] handle a thousand because you're blowing
[35:39] it. So until you come into discipline,
[35:42] until you see the the value, the joy of
[35:45] getting yourself in order, not others.
[35:49] I'm not talking about blaming others and
[35:51] husband, wife, children, family,
[35:52] neighbor, work, coworker, whatever. Not
[35:55] that. You I'm speaking to tonight. You
[35:58] who the song of my voice tonight, until
[36:00] you can get yourself in order, we have a
[36:04] problem.
[36:05] Okay, let's go.
[36:07] Okay. So, there are different things we
[36:10] could see as boundaries.
[36:13] I like this one. Time boundaries. How we
[36:16] spend our time. Bible speak of we spend
[36:19] our time as a tale that is told. We
[36:22] spend our years as a tale that is told.
[36:25] You waste your minutes, you waste your
[36:26] hours, then you waste days, you waste
[36:28] weeks, you waste months, you waste years
[36:33] spending time. So time is something that
[36:35] could be spent. Time is something that
[36:38] could run out. You could actually run
[36:39] out of time. Time run out. The band
[36:41] says, "Tomorrow I'll big big big bands.
[36:44] I'll spread my business and I'll do
[36:46] this. I'll do that." And God said, "Thou
[36:48] fool, tonight thy soul is required."
[36:50] See, his time ran out. There are moral
[36:54] boundaries.
[36:57] You could choose to go to a party. You
[36:58] could choose to compromise with sin. or
[37:00] you could run like if there's a big
[37:02] truck coming to kill you.
[37:07] There are relationship boundaries,
[37:09] people who you shouldn't have around
[37:10] your life, people that you shouldn't be
[37:12] connecting to. And there are also
[37:15] spiritual boundaries where the Bible
[37:16] proverbs 4:23 and something that Isaac
[37:19] speak a lot about guard your heart. Why
[37:21] would God say that?
[37:23] For out of that of the issues of life.
[37:27] In other words, you can't be loose about
[37:29] your lips. loose about your desires,
[37:31] loose about, you know, what you say.
[37:33] Loose about your tongue. You have to
[37:35] guard your tongue.
[37:39] So, I hope that along the way tonight,
[37:42] it will strike you of these things of
[37:46] what boundaries is like. Praise God.
[37:49] Amen. Let's go. Okay. So therefore
[37:54] boundaries is what define the path from
[37:57] the river Euphrates to there to here and
[38:00] so on. But discipline is what will keep
[38:03] you on that path. Without discipline,
[38:08] boundary is just talk. It's just
[38:11] thoughts. Without boundaries,
[38:14] then the discipline you have, you're not
[38:16] you don't know where you're going. But
[38:19] you see God gave a specific from the
[38:22] river Euphrates to here to there all the
[38:24] land of the Hittites shall until the
[38:26] going of your son. You see the sun going
[38:28] down all that is your coast. So you see
[38:30] the sun going down you reach there yet
[38:31] all that shall be your coast. Thou shall
[38:34] make it on the word day and night. And
[38:37] then the thought struck me about
[38:40] respects
[38:42] about respect as a boundary.
[38:45] And it struck me if you cannot respect
[38:47] the man
[38:49] respect the office he holds.
[38:52] So respect is not a feeling. You know
[38:54] some people like to respect people with
[38:56] a fancy car, fancy house, fancy money,
[38:58] fancy job, fancy title. Respects is
[39:02] something you have to have within
[39:04] because you have to have it to give it.
[39:07] Yes. Some people don't have respects.
[39:10] They cannot give it. But respects is a
[39:14] boundary listen that governs how we
[39:18] interact with people
[39:21] especially people in positions of
[39:22] authority.
[39:24] So respect sets a limit on how far we
[39:27] let our emotions
[39:29] frustrations or disagreement carry. How
[39:32] much marriages get affected because the
[39:35] emotion tip over in a wrong direction?
[39:38] What if husband respects wives? Wife
[39:42] respect their husband and treat them
[39:43] with respect. Bible say husband love
[39:45] your wife, wife respect. Why it is that
[39:47] wife have a battle with respect?
[39:50] What the the the the the Bible didn't
[39:54] call out respects on the husband so
[39:56] much. The Bible call out respects on the
[39:59] wives. The Bible call out love upon the
[40:02] husband. So husbands can have a
[40:04] challenge with loving their wives. Bible
[40:06] talk about treating a wife with wisdom.
[40:09] So the Bible is very specific. It's not
[40:11] there's not a general uh one-size fit
[40:14] all. It it defines certain things and it
[40:17] defines the way a woman or a wife
[40:21] supposed to treat a husband. Of course,
[40:23] we have the modern day feminine kind of
[40:26] thing. Um so subject to a man and the
[40:29] Bible thing and and and that drama
[40:31] business. But the point about it in
[40:32] order to succeed as a family it has to
[40:34] have some structure and some order and
[40:37] God set it up that way because God know
[40:39] it will work best that way. I would not
[40:41] argue with him. So even if you don't
[40:44] like a person
[40:46] if you recognize that that person is an
[40:49] office
[40:50] you could operate with restraint. You
[40:54] could operate with honor. you can
[40:56] operate, you know, you it it makes you
[40:58] stop being insulting and rebellion
[41:00] because that is where things backfire.
[41:02] And a good example of this is in 1st
[41:05] Samuel 24:6. Sometime we know and we
[41:08] know Saul was trying to kill David. And
[41:09] David caught Saul and David could have
[41:11] killed Saul. And he said unto his men,
[41:13] "The Lord forbid that I should do this
[41:17] thing unto my master, the Lord's
[41:19] anointed, to stretch forth my hand
[41:21] against him, seeing he is anointed of
[41:25] the Lord." This is a man out to kill
[41:27] David. David get the opportunity to kill
[41:29] him and David did not. David said he in
[41:33] other words I will not do that because
[41:36] that man is in the position of a king
[41:40] why you want to have on your title you
[41:42] kill a king David didn't do that but you
[41:45] know what was powerful for me to see how
[41:48] Jesus handled the scribe and Pharisees
[41:50] and we find that in Matthew 23 verse 2
[41:53] and 3 listen to Jesus saying the scribe
[41:57] and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat he's
[41:59] telling you where them guys operating a
[42:01] legalistic
[42:03] lawike position. That is why the woman
[42:06] caught in the act of adultery, they
[42:08] said, "Moses law say she should be
[42:10] stoned." And Jesus said, "Which one of
[42:12] you cast the first stone?" He said, "I
[42:14] ain't come to to to to question the law
[42:16] or fight the law. I come to fulfill the
[42:18] law." So listen to what he is saying
[42:20] here. He's telling the disciples, "The
[42:23] scribe and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.
[42:25] these guys in a position
[42:28] all therefore whatsoever they bid you
[42:31] observe
[42:33] that observe and do in other words what
[42:36] they talking obey it what they are
[42:39] talking do it but then he say but do not
[42:42] ye after their works or they say and do
[42:46] not so he is saying these guys are
[42:48] hypocrites but respect them
[42:52] what they are saying if it's the truth
[42:55] Obey them, follow it. So these guys were
[42:59] in a position of authority. These guys
[43:02] were sitting in Moses' seat and they
[43:05] were hypocrites. And yet Jesus said,
[43:08] "All therefore whatsoever they bid you,
[43:11] observe. That observe and do, but do not
[43:16] ye after their works or they say and do
[43:19] not." In other words, their life is not
[43:22] tallying up with what they are saying
[43:24] with their mouths. They are already
[43:26] hypocrites. But don't bother with that.
[43:28] Don't go and say hypocrite and you put a
[43:31] card and you're carrying on a piece of
[43:32] foolish. You don't have to go that way.
[43:34] That's disrespect. What you do, you
[43:36] listen, you observe, and you do, and you
[43:40] act because it's God's word. Let them
[43:43] continue sitting Moses seat. God will
[43:45] deal with them.
[43:47] So even Romans 13:7 talking about
[43:50] governmental authority. Now render
[43:53] therefore to all their dues tribute to
[43:54] whom tribute is due custom to whom
[43:56] custom fear to whom fear honor to whom
[43:59] honor. So therefore we respect authority
[44:03] even governmental authority. Of course
[44:05] there will come a time when the
[44:06] government will close us down and all
[44:07] that sort of thing and think that is
[44:09] true. But it the Bible does not give us
[44:12] any position to fight the government and
[44:16] to lead a rebellion and the Bible
[44:18] doesn't give us that authority at all.
[44:20] On the contrary, the Bible say pray for
[44:21] those who in power that we may lead as
[44:25] fast as possible peaceable lives. So you
[44:28] can apply this and the Bible says there
[44:30] and this is from Tim 1 Timothy 2. I
[44:33] exhort therefore that first of all
[44:35] supplications, prayers, intercessions,
[44:37] and given of thanks be made for all men,
[44:39] for kings, and for all that are in
[44:42] authority, that we may lead a quiet and
[44:46] peaceable life in all godliness and
[44:48] honesty. Do you know it takes God to put
[44:50] someone in power?
[44:53] Do you know power comes from God? Do you
[44:56] know that God put Pharaoh in power? Do
[44:59] you know God said, "I harden Pharaoh
[45:00] heart. I'll get me glory over Egypt.
[45:04] So God is the one that set things up and
[45:07] bring kings down. Set kings up kingdom
[45:11] up and bring kingdom down. So you don't
[45:14] have to fight like Abraham. Abraham
[45:16] didn't fight lot men being blessed and
[45:18] and cattle and and everything else and
[45:20] and lot and men and Abraham come and
[45:23] said look we are brethren don't carry
[45:25] where they said of foolishness and men
[45:26] fighting and sheep rustling and all kind
[45:28] of foolishness going on. He said listen,
[45:30] you take the east, I take the west, you
[45:31] you you choose. Imagine God called
[45:34] Abraham and Abraham says my right. God
[45:37] called me first and therefore I want
[45:39] this, I want that. No, no. Abraham said,
[45:42] "Lord, you choose." And look his eyes.
[45:44] His eyes. See the eyes. You look around.
[45:47] You see desert here, desert here. And
[45:48] you see Sodom, water, you see this down
[45:50] Sodom. You get towards Sodom. And when
[45:53] they split, God tell Abraham, "Look
[45:55] east, west, north." And so all is yours.
[45:56] I couldn't tell you been a lot around.
[45:58] know that all split. So sometimes split
[46:01] is in order. God set up that because
[46:04] that level of unbelief doesn't help Lot,
[46:06] doesn't help Abraham. So Lot went down
[46:08] to Sodom and we know these stories. Oh,
[46:10] praise the Lord. Amen. You love him
[46:11] tonight. Trusty being edified tonight.
[46:15] Amen. So therefore, respects
[46:19] becomes a boundary of conduct. There are
[46:22] some people like to get trouble. They
[46:24] like to be hard. I know a guy who has
[46:27] been from church to church giving
[46:28] trouble. He you know they they figure
[46:32] that is a devil is a demon. It's some
[46:34] spirit upon them figure that they will
[46:36] go and and challenge things and fight
[46:38] things and whatnot. I believe you you
[46:41] have issue with some place you sort it
[46:43] out or move out. Don't go and carry on
[46:46] with any foolishness. That doesn't make
[46:47] any sense. Doesn't have the cause. Even
[46:50] the Bible talk about wicked servants and
[46:52] the Bible talk about the lord of that
[46:54] servant. I am not the lord of anybody's
[46:56] servant. God will deal with all those
[46:58] who claim to be servants because they
[47:00] have to give an account. So therefore
[47:03] God want us to respect and recognize
[47:06] authority. God want us to learn what it
[47:11] is is to be humble and what is to be
[47:14] disciplined and how we respond to people
[47:16] who don't have the the sharpness or or
[47:22] the grace or whatever we think that they
[47:24] should have. We could we could go past
[47:26] all of that. All right. Now,
[47:29] disrespects. We talk about respects
[47:31] being a boundary. Disrespect
[47:34] break boundaries.
[47:36] And I'll give you an example of that.
[47:38] And if you have your Bible, you could go
[47:40] to Numbers 12. This is Miriam and Aaron
[47:45] coming against Moses. And Numbers 12:1
[47:48] says, "And Miriam and Aaron
[47:52] speak against Moses
[47:54] because of the Ethiopian woman whom he
[47:56] had married, for he had married an
[48:00] Ethiopian woman." Now, this is none of
[48:03] their business. This is Moses. This is
[48:06] God. Moses is a prophet. This is a
[48:10] sideshow now. And these people choose to
[48:12] comment on something that is absolutely
[48:15] none of their business.
[48:18] And they said, here we go. It gone
[48:20] further than Latin. And they said, "Had
[48:23] the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses?
[48:26] Hath he not spoken also by us?"
[48:29] And the Lord heard it. You know, but I
[48:32] read it said something. I think it was
[48:33] quite interesting. You talk about people
[48:35] who robbing God of tights and he said
[48:38] it's not so much that you know it's what
[48:39] else they robbing God. They could rob
[48:41] God of worship, rob God of prayer, of
[48:44] dedication, devotion is rubbers going on
[48:47] right there is a reflection of more than
[48:48] just that because you have to come into
[48:50] full obedience and the Bible talk about
[48:52] full obedience in of the word of God
[48:55] entitles you to the token. So these
[48:58] people watching Moses marry a 2 p.m.
[49:00] woman they have issues with that. Not
[49:02] only had the issues, you know, they're
[49:03] speaking it and they went. Not only
[49:06] that, they're saying, "But but God, not
[49:07] we talking to Moses, we're talking to
[49:09] us, too." And the Lord heard it. So
[49:12] they're expressing their thoughts in
[49:13] private, but God heard it like a
[49:16] loudspeaker in him. Now
[49:19] verse three, the man Moses was very
[49:22] meek.
[49:24] That's interesting. You got to find some
[49:27] stuff on that. He that be a whole Bible
[49:29] part, Bible study. The man Moses was
[49:31] very meek above all men that were upon
[49:33] the face of the earth. And the Lord
[49:36] spake suddenly unto Moses and unto Aaron
[49:40] and unto Miriam, "Come out, ye tree unto
[49:43] the tabernacle of the congregation, and
[49:46] they tree came out." And the Lord came
[49:49] down in a pill of cloud and stood in the
[49:52] door of the tabernacle and called Aram
[49:56] by God. They say song and like I'm I'm
[49:58] reading it and like I'm seeing it. But
[50:00] could you imagine uh you being there?
[50:03] Could you imagine what type of
[50:05] experience that would be for you to see
[50:07] the cloud come down and call Aaron and
[50:10] Miriam and they both came forth and he
[50:13] said know my words.
[50:16] If there be a prophet among you, I the
[50:19] Lord will make myself known unto him in
[50:22] a vision and will speak unto him in a
[50:24] dream,
[50:26] my servant Moses is not so, who is
[50:30] faithful in all my house. With him will
[50:34] I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently,
[50:36] and not in dark speures. And the
[50:38] similitude of the Lord shall he behold.
[50:42] Wherefore
[50:43] then were you not afraid to speak
[50:46] against my servant Moses? And the anger
[50:49] of the Lord was kindled against him,
[50:52] against them, and he departed.
[50:57] And the cloud departed from off the
[51:00] tabernacle. And behold,
[51:03] Miriam became lepros, white as snow. and
[51:08] Aaron looked upon Miriam and behold she
[51:11] was lepous. So the cloud came down
[51:14] called them out the cloud left and
[51:17] Miriam is now she has leprosy.
[51:22] So Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses
[51:24] because of his wife.
[51:27] They actually stepped
[51:30] outside of the boundary of respect for
[51:33] the office that God gave Moses and
[51:37] judgment was the result.
[51:41] Disrespecting spiritual authority
[51:44] is crossing God's boundary.
[51:48] Want to take another one from 2
[51:50] Chronicles 26. So your Bibles want to
[51:52] look at it verse 16
[51:54] to 21. This is about King Uzziah. He was
[51:58] a good king. He was young on the throne.
[52:00] He was doing quite well. But something
[52:03] happened with him.
[52:05] This is where people change
[52:08] especially with heart issues
[52:11] and he got lifted up and he wanted to do
[52:15] priest work. He was king. He was doing
[52:18] quite well as king but he want to play
[52:21] priest.
[52:23] You want ministry.
[52:25] You want to get in a position that God
[52:26] didn't call him for call him to.
[52:29] Verse 16 says, "And when he was strong,
[52:31] his heart was lifted up to his
[52:34] destruction
[52:36] and he transgressed against his God."
[52:39] The Lord is God. Went into the temple of
[52:43] the Lord to burn incense upon the altar
[52:46] of incense.
[52:48] Now listen. Aariah the priests went in
[52:51] after him. And with him four score
[52:55] priests of the Lord, which is 80,
[53:00] and were brilliant men.
[53:05] And they withtood Uziah the king, and
[53:07] said unto him, It appearainth not unto
[53:10] thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the
[53:14] Lord, but to the priests and the sons of
[53:16] Aaron. Thou art consecrated to burn in
[53:19] that are consecrated to burn incense. Go
[53:21] out of the sanctuary. So they're telling
[53:23] the king, go out of the sanctuary, for
[53:26] thou has trespassed.
[53:28] Neither shall it be for thine honor from
[53:31] the Lord God. Then Uzziah was wrought.
[53:36] So he already broke boundaries. He's in
[53:38] a place he's not supposed to be. Plus
[53:41] he's getting upset. He's getting angry.
[53:44] So Isaiah Uzziah was wrought and had a
[53:47] sensor in his hand to burn incense. And
[53:50] while he was wrought with the priest,
[53:53] the leprosy even rose up in his forehead
[53:57] before the priest of the house of the
[53:59] Lord and beside the incense altar.
[54:03] And Aariah the chief priest and all the
[54:06] priests looked upon him, and behold, he
[54:09] was lepros in his forehead. and they
[54:12] trust him out from then. He himself
[54:15] hasted also to go out because the Lord
[54:18] had smitten him. And Uzziah the king was
[54:23] a leper
[54:24] onto the day of his death. Little
[54:29] he could not have imagined
[54:33] his life would have taken that turn.
[54:36] Uzzah the king was a leper until the day
[54:38] of his death and dwelt in several house
[54:42] being a leper for he was cut off from
[54:44] the house of the Lord and Jotam his son
[54:46] was over the king's house judging the
[54:49] people of the land.
[54:52] So Uzziah
[54:55] disrespected
[54:56] the boundary that God set between the
[54:59] kingly and the priestly offices
[55:04] struck with leprosy.
[55:06] So respect means
[55:09] staying in the boundaries
[55:11] within one's calling.
[55:14] Oh, praise the Lord. I want to read this
[55:17] one from Mark 6. And this is one in
[55:20] which
[55:22] the people choose to view Jesus a
[55:24] certain way. Jesus is in ministry now.
[55:28] He's pumping. He's moving. He is
[55:31] executing. He is manifesting. And Mark 6
[55:35] 1-6 I'm going to read. And he went off
[55:36] from dense and came into his own country
[55:41] as disciples followed him. And when the
[55:44] Sabbath day was come, he began to teach
[55:46] in the synagogue. And many hearing him
[55:49] were astonished, saying, From whence
[55:51] hath this man these things, and what
[55:54] wisdom is this which is given unto him?
[55:56] And even such mighty works are wrought
[55:58] by his hands. Is not this the carpenter?
[56:01] Okay, so here we go now. He's in
[56:03] ministry. He's bringing the word is
[56:06] astonishing them. He has works to go
[56:08] with it. And they choose to see is not
[56:12] this the carpenter's son, the son of
[56:15] Mary, the brother of James and Joseph,
[56:17] and of Judah and Simon, and are not his
[56:21] sisters here with us? And they were
[56:24] offended at him. And Jesus said unto
[56:27] them, "A prophet is not without honor,
[56:29] but in his own country, and among his
[56:32] own kin, and his own house." And here we
[56:35] go. and he could dear do no mighty work
[56:39] save he laid his hands upon a few sick
[56:41] folk and healed them and he marveled
[56:45] because of their unbelief. This one
[56:49] astonished Jesus. The Bible use the word
[56:50] marveled. So he was surprised,
[56:54] astonished because of their unbelief and
[56:56] he went around the villages teaching. So
[57:01] their disrespect
[57:03] broke a barrier that affected the
[57:07] ministry to be effective to them because
[57:10] they chose to see the carnal side of
[57:12] Jesus or the natural side of Jesus or
[57:16] the human side of Jesus. So therefore
[57:19] disrespect could block the flow of God's
[57:23] power and blessing. And that's why talk
[57:25] about pray for your pastor. If you're
[57:26] about talking to your pastor and talking
[57:27] negative and saying all kind of thing
[57:28] that how is that man supposed to help
[57:30] you? How is that man supposed to be a
[57:31] blessing to you? How is the anointing
[57:34] supposed to flow through that man to
[57:36] you? It can't work that way.
[57:39] So respects is a boundary.
[57:44] Respects authority. Even if it's float,
[57:48] it's not the man, it's the office, the
[57:51] man's home. Okay. Wow.
[57:55] Trust you're having a good time. I trust
[57:57] you're being edified.
[57:59] Joshua 14, from the wilderness of this
[58:01] Lebanon, even to the great river, the
[58:04] river Euphrates, all the land of the
[58:05] Hittites and the and the great sea
[58:08] towards the going down the sun shall be
[58:11] your coast. So he's telling them south,
[58:13] north, east, west.
[58:16] And you know God wanted them to get this
[58:19] land.
[58:21] This was the land to be conquered. This
[58:23] is a land Moses just looked over. He
[58:25] couldn't cross into it. God appointed
[58:27] Joshua. And I was thinking about what we
[58:30] could overcome and take immediate
[58:32] possession of in our lives. One of them
[58:34] is fear.
[58:36] One of them is sinful habits. So we just
[58:38] pick two also. Doubt, unbelief, negative
[58:42] thinking, all of these things. Sinful
[58:45] habits. Romans 6:14. For sin shall have
[58:48] dominion over you. We could have victory
[58:50] over sin. We could have over picture
[58:52] over fear. We could have victory over
[58:54] anxiety. Certain things we could take
[58:56] immediately. We don't have to have fast
[58:58] three days to take them things. We could
[58:59] take it right away. We could say, "You
[59:01] know what? I'm bringing back the prayer
[59:02] altar back in my home. I'm bringing back
[59:05] the time of meditation of God's word.
[59:07] Yes, you're a mother. Yes, you have
[59:09] children. Your children have to do
[59:11] school work and schooling and everything
[59:12] else. But still, you have to make a
[59:15] little time to meditate on the word. You
[59:18] have still have to make time to pray.
[59:19] still has to make time to set your
[59:21] boundary on time. Time itself because if
[59:23] you don't, you would lose time. You
[59:25] would lose focus because the devil have
[59:28] everything so busy busy busy that we
[59:30] can't have that kind of focus. And one
[59:32] of the greatest thing we could do
[59:34] immediately immediate immediately is to
[59:38] exercise forgiveness and drop
[59:40] bitterness. Ephesians 4:32, forgiving
[59:43] one another even as God for Christ's
[59:45] sake has forgiven you. And we always
[59:48] talk about it over and over and over
[59:50] like a recurring decimal. Forgiveness
[59:53] releases you from the person that you
[59:55] have the ought against. If you still
[59:57] hold the ought, they still connected to
[59:58] you. They're bound to you like
[1:00:00] Spider-Man passing a web. And if you
[1:00:03] have ought against 10 people, it's 10
[1:00:04] webs. You carrying a a whole set of
[1:00:07] people around with you. You're not even
[1:00:08] light enough to go in rapture. You can't
[1:00:10] go in rapture with that. You have to be
[1:00:12] able to get past that. So forgiveness is
[1:00:15] something you could immediately apply
[1:00:17] whether it's to your wife, to your
[1:00:18] husband, to your boss, to your neighbor,
[1:00:20] to somebody that abused you, terrorized
[1:00:21] you, whatever it is, to drop it. Forgive
[1:00:24] us of our sins as as we forgive those
[1:00:27] who trespass against that. Forgiveness
[1:00:29] is a key. Forgiveness could bring
[1:00:31] healing, but forgiveness could bring
[1:00:33] restoration. But forgiveness could
[1:00:35] actually bring reconciliation. So
[1:00:38] therefore, again, go Joshua, God give
[1:00:41] Joshua the land. Hotel Milan is yours,
[1:00:44] but you have to fight to possess it. So
[1:00:48] Christ already won the victory at the
[1:00:49] cross and paid the price and redeem us
[1:00:51] everything else. But here we have to
[1:00:53] work out our own salvation with fear and
[1:00:57] trembling. Isn't that something? So we
[1:01:00] have to fight for our own inheritance.
[1:01:04] All right. So therefore, personal land,
[1:01:09] personal victory, personal promised
[1:01:12] land. We could have victory over sin,
[1:01:14] victory over peace of mind. We could
[1:01:16] have victory over fear. We could get joy
[1:01:18] in the Holy Ghost. And we could get
[1:01:21] authority over the enemy. You hear about
[1:01:23] the Reddit speaks a lot about that. And
[1:01:25] you could trust God to provide for your
[1:01:27] needs. You could trust God for your
[1:01:30] wholeness. You could trust God and
[1:01:32] believe God for wisdom. You know,
[1:01:34] sometimes you see Christian acts acts
[1:01:36] foolish. And the Bible say if you lack
[1:01:38] wisdom, ask God. But I don't know if we
[1:01:40] supposed to tell people you're acting
[1:01:42] foolish. How you convey, how you speak
[1:01:44] that, how you share that, I don't know.
[1:01:45] Because you don't want to bring offense.
[1:01:47] But my goodness, you you you would need
[1:01:50] to ask God for wisdom. Even dealing with
[1:01:52] your children when they five and under
[1:01:55] is one level. 10 and under is the next
[1:01:57] level, 15 is the next level, 20 and is
[1:01:59] the next level. It's different levels.
[1:02:01] Is your child? Yes. But it's not the
[1:02:04] same child that is three years old or
[1:02:06] four years old. You know that child is
[1:02:08] becoming an adult being shaped along the
[1:02:11] way and sometimes we didn't if we don't
[1:02:13] do the early work after a while it's
[1:02:15] almost too late but we could be free
[1:02:18] from condemnation.
[1:02:20] All right. So we the title I have here
[1:02:24] is boundaries starve unbelief
[1:02:27] and feed fate.
[1:02:30] So boundaries are like walls of a city.
[1:02:35] It protects you
[1:02:37] without them. And brother Isaac Da Bible
[1:02:40] study about broken walls and the the
[1:02:42] burden was to restore the wall before
[1:02:44] you could even build because you have
[1:02:46] enemies.
[1:02:47] And if you have broken walls, the enemy
[1:02:50] could keep attacking attacking and you
[1:02:52] will not get that victory. So first you
[1:02:54] got to be concerned with what are the
[1:02:55] walls? What are the walls for?
[1:02:59] Proverbs 4:23, "Keep thy heart with all
[1:03:01] diligence, for out of it are the issues
[1:03:04] of life." Guarding means setting
[1:03:07] boundaries to protect your faith from
[1:03:11] unbelief. So unbelief tribes where the
[1:03:15] boundaries are broken.
[1:03:18] That's what we find out.
[1:03:20] God was giving them mana.
[1:03:23] God is blessing them with shoes, with
[1:03:26] they closed that get in treadbearer,
[1:03:28] but they broke those boundaries and the
[1:03:31] Bible said they could not enter in
[1:03:35] because of unbelief.
[1:03:37] So where boundaries fall, unbelief
[1:03:40] will gain ground. Boundaries are
[1:03:44] discipline
[1:03:45] that train us to keep the faith alive.
[1:03:49] There's a boundary of the word. That's
[1:03:50] why God tell Joshua, meditate day and
[1:03:52] night. Meditate is not to pray.
[1:03:55] He didn't say pray day and night. He
[1:03:56] said meditate on me day and night. You
[1:03:58] have to pray day and night. But meditate
[1:04:00] is thinking on that. Like last night I
[1:04:03] wake up and I think about boundaries.
[1:04:05] And this thing riding me. Boundaries.
[1:04:07] Boundaries.
[1:04:08] Does God have boundaries? Find out he
[1:04:10] does. Does he set boundaries? Yes, we
[1:04:14] do. He does. Do we set boundaries?
[1:04:17] Sometimes we do. Especially with
[1:04:19] children. And that's why if you give the
[1:04:22] children everything they ask for, you're
[1:04:25] training up and raising up a monster.
[1:04:27] Later on they will feel life means that
[1:04:30] whatever I ask for I get. Then later on
[1:04:33] they feel truly entitled and then they
[1:04:36] become almost like bullies because they
[1:04:38] don't know what no is. They don't have
[1:04:41] discipline. But the Bible speaks about
[1:04:44] every son that cometh to God must be
[1:04:46] tried, must be tested. So we have the
[1:04:50] word and we have a order from God to
[1:04:54] think on this silah take a pause take a
[1:04:57] scripture write it in your heart keeping
[1:04:59] your heart meditate on it as brother but
[1:05:01] Isaac will say you you're walking slowly
[1:05:03] sometime you read you read too fast but
[1:05:05] sometime when you walk slowly you could
[1:05:08] see some things like how he beautifully
[1:05:11] we brought out about that man 38 years
[1:05:13] coming and he say I have no man to put
[1:05:15] me in the question was where his friends
[1:05:16] where his family did Did he make any
[1:05:18] contact? Was he just all lonely Joe? Was
[1:05:21] he just coming to church and going back
[1:05:22] home? No relationship, no connection,
[1:05:25] just a plain just come and do your duty
[1:05:27] and get out. He had no connections.
[1:05:30] There's no man to put me in. Why? 38
[1:05:33] years he's coming. No support.
[1:05:36] Church is a supportive environment.
[1:05:39] Church is a relief. When you come in
[1:05:42] that do not forsake your assembling,
[1:05:43] when you get the opportunity to connect
[1:05:45] with others, shake their hands. Granted
[1:05:48] there are characters around always have
[1:05:50] every church have them three kind of
[1:05:51] believers unbeliever make believer true
[1:05:53] believer but besides that it's a
[1:05:56] supportive environment that you could
[1:05:57] say you know what remember me in prayer
[1:05:59] you could say what I love you my brother
[1:06:01] god bless you could forgive you could
[1:06:03] encourage you could hold up that's what
[1:06:05] church is about the birds when a bird is
[1:06:08] wounded the rest of birds fly to protect
[1:06:09] it they fly in a certain formation to
[1:06:12] order to protect the bird from the heavy
[1:06:13] breeze because the wings is wounded you
[1:06:15] have to recover and when in recovering
[1:06:17] mode. You can't take too much alix.
[1:06:20] You have to be protected.
[1:06:22] Isn't that something?
[1:06:25] There are boundaries of speech. We have
[1:06:28] to know when to be silent. We struck
[1:06:30] that some time ago. Mark the perfect
[1:06:31] man. He could bridle his tongue. There
[1:06:33] are people tongue loose. We know our
[1:06:34] sister used to say, "I know lit from
[1:06:36] your mouth." Yes, you better get lit for
[1:06:37] your mouth. Oh, God will shut it up. I
[1:06:40] know lit from your mouth. That's a wrong
[1:06:42] statement. That is not a Christian
[1:06:44] statement. You have to get a lid for
[1:06:46] your mouth. Your mouth is too loose.
[1:06:48] Your mouth is getting you in trouble.
[1:06:53] Look at numbers chapter 14. And the Lord
[1:06:56] spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, How
[1:06:59] long shall I bear with this evil
[1:07:01] congregation which murmur against me? I
[1:07:04] have heard the murmurings of the
[1:07:05] children of Israel which they murmur
[1:07:07] against me. Say unto them, listen to
[1:07:10] what God tell him. Say unto them, truly
[1:07:14] as I live, sayeth the Lord, as he have
[1:07:16] spoken in my ears, so will I do to you.
[1:07:19] In other words, what you say? I work
[1:07:21] with that. So if you talking negative,
[1:07:24] what you expect? If you saying I cannot
[1:07:27] take it, I cannot possess it. What you
[1:07:29] expect? When those 10 spies came back,
[1:07:33] they brought an evil report. That's how
[1:07:35] God that was just negative him. God
[1:07:37] interpreted that report as an evil
[1:07:39] reporting because that report brought an
[1:07:42] anointing among the camp of Israel that
[1:07:45] was purely negative. They was in a dark
[1:07:48] place because the God that brought him
[1:07:51] out of Egypt who say I'm bringing you to
[1:07:52] a land of milk and honey. Here it is 10
[1:07:55] ministers, 10 pastors, 10 bishops, 10
[1:07:58] popes, 10 whatever they are. They came
[1:08:01] back and brought a report to the people
[1:08:03] and said we cannot take it because there
[1:08:05] are giants in the land. Joshua and Caleb
[1:08:08] have come back late which is by order.
[1:08:11] There's a reason why God have them to
[1:08:13] stay back that way. When they came back,
[1:08:15] Caleb was the shortest person in the
[1:08:17] camp. He had to put stand up on a box to
[1:08:19] tell them that is so paradoxical for him
[1:08:22] to stand up on a box and say we are
[1:08:23] wellable. We are more than able. Let us
[1:08:25] go up at once and possess it. And then
[1:08:28] but he's saying look at shorty what
[1:08:30] shorty telling us he could fight any
[1:08:31] giant and and and these guys were saying
[1:08:34] we are more than able and this is what
[1:08:36] God want to hear from your mouth that's
[1:08:39] why the Bible say let the weak say I am
[1:08:41] strong let the weak say I am strong I
[1:08:45] say it again let the weak say you have
[1:08:47] to say it you have to say to believe it
[1:08:50] let the weak say I am strong you never
[1:08:53] confess weakness you never confess I
[1:08:56] can't make it and oh God. The devil beat
[1:08:58] him up left, right, and center.
[1:09:02] God said, "Truly as I live, say the
[1:09:05] Lord. As he have spoken in my ears, so
[1:09:07] will I do to you. Your carcasses shall
[1:09:10] fall in this wilderness." Now,
[1:09:12] understand this. This is the God that
[1:09:14] brought them out here. There's not
[1:09:16] another God. He brought me out out
[1:09:18] there, man. We clear. Hallelujah.
[1:09:19] Hallelujah. Yes, he brought you out. But
[1:09:22] where are you now?
[1:09:24] Your carcasses shall fall in this
[1:09:26] wilderness, and all that were numbered
[1:09:28] of you, according to your whole number,
[1:09:30] from 20 years old and upward, which have
[1:09:32] murmured against me. Doubtless ye shall
[1:09:35] not come into the land concerning which
[1:09:38] I swear to make you dwell therein, save
[1:09:40] Caleb, the son of Jeff, and Joshua, the
[1:09:42] son of Nun.
[1:09:44] So therefore
[1:09:46] you have to
[1:09:49] you have to disconnect yourself from
[1:09:52] this unbelieving atmosphere from
[1:09:55] negative atmosphere from negative people
[1:09:58] from negative environment from negative
[1:10:00] churches you have to disconnect
[1:10:01] completely
[1:10:04] about the clothes all right look at this
[1:10:08] brother Isaac struck this Mark 53842
[1:10:11] when this rich ruler came to Jesus and
[1:10:14] spoke about his daughter is sick and
[1:10:16] somebody said no but the master daughter
[1:10:18] is dead he came to the house of the
[1:10:20] ruler this is Jesus of the synagogue and
[1:10:22] seeing the tomat and them that wept and
[1:10:24] wailed greatly and when he was come in
[1:10:28] he said unto them why make this a do in
[1:10:30] other words why carry on and weep the
[1:10:33] damsel is not dead but sleepeth so Jesus
[1:10:37] speaking
[1:10:39] speaking the word speaking into the
[1:10:42] atmosphere here speaking into the
[1:10:45] situation. By the way, not everybody
[1:10:47] called to speak into your life. Speaking
[1:10:49] into the situation, he said, "She's not
[1:10:52] dead. Sleep it." Verse 14. And they
[1:10:55] laughed him to scorn. And when he put
[1:10:58] them all out after they laughed, have a
[1:11:00] laugh.
[1:11:02] He put them out. He taketh the father,
[1:11:05] the mother of the damsel, and them that
[1:11:08] were with him, and enter in where the
[1:11:10] damsel was lying. And he took the damsel
[1:11:13] by the hand, and said unto her, Dalita
[1:11:15] coming, which is to say, being
[1:11:18] interpreted, damsel, I sent to the rats.
[1:11:20] And straightway the damsel arose, and
[1:11:23] walked, for she was of the age of 12
[1:11:25] years, and they were astonished with a
[1:11:28] great astonishment. So Jesus put the
[1:11:32] doubters out. He put unbelief out. He
[1:11:36] put the negative atmosphere out. We have
[1:11:38] to do the same. We have to put things
[1:11:41] out as brother say dismantle unbelief.
[1:11:43] We have to break it up. We have to make
[1:11:45] an effort. We have to take action to get
[1:11:47] this unbelief completely dismantled.
[1:11:54] So boundaries, I want you to see
[1:11:57] boundaries as structures that protects
[1:12:00] faith,
[1:12:01] dismantling unbelief as removing the
[1:12:04] doubts, the disobedience,
[1:12:07] the lies. Isn't that something? So
[1:12:11] boundaries
[1:12:13] starve unbelief and boundaries feed
[1:12:16] faith because you're walking into the
[1:12:19] land of what God promised. Oh, praise
[1:12:21] God. So I'm going to wrap
[1:12:27] Boundaries define what is allowed
[1:12:31] and what is not.
[1:12:34] God has set boundaries for himself
[1:12:37] and his creation.
[1:12:39] God maintains order
[1:12:43] in our personal lives. Boundaries
[1:12:46] protect our fate and the boundaries is
[1:12:49] what helps dismantle unbelief.
[1:12:56] Boundaries are like spiritual walls to
[1:12:57] protect us.
[1:13:00] Boundaries help to keep faith intact and
[1:13:03] unbelief out.
[1:13:06] They are not restrictions to harm us but
[1:13:09] protections to preserve what God has
[1:13:13] given us.
[1:13:15] And I'm closing with this.
[1:13:20] Jesus used
[1:13:23] truth to defend the devil.
[1:13:26] He wasn't in opinion.
[1:13:28] He was quoting the word. You cannot
[1:13:31] quote what you don't know. You cannot
[1:13:34] speak what you don't know. The first
[1:13:37] word man shall live by bread alone, but
[1:13:39] by every word that proceed out of the
[1:13:40] mouth of God was the word. He keep
[1:13:43] feeding the devil the word. In Gyrus
[1:13:46] house,
[1:13:48] he actually
[1:13:49] sent out and kicked out and booted out
[1:13:52] the contrary atmosphere.
[1:13:56] In Gethsemane,
[1:13:59] he submitted himself to the father's
[1:14:01] will even though he had a choice. If it
[1:14:06] is possible, let this cup pass. But I
[1:14:08] surrender to the boundary of your will.
[1:14:12] Never rest but my will but thy will be
[1:14:14] done. So boundaries are not to confine
[1:14:17] us but to secure what God has given us.
[1:14:22] We have to respect boundaries.
[1:14:25] Question
[1:14:27] is boundaries a friend or an enemy?
[1:14:30] Boundaries protect not punish.
[1:14:33] A fence in a garden
[1:14:36] doesn't keep the plants in prison. It is
[1:14:39] to protect them from the animals that
[1:14:40] would destroy them.
[1:14:43] So God boundaries protect our lives from
[1:14:48] sin and destruction. I want you to see
[1:14:50] tonight boundaries as a shield, not a
[1:14:53] shakle.
[1:14:55] True freedom
[1:14:57] is not the absence of limits.
[1:15:00] It's the presence of order.
[1:15:04] So the traffic lights on the road is not
[1:15:08] to keep us back. Why the red stain so
[1:15:10] red and you want green right through
[1:15:12] you'll get in an accident. You will get
[1:15:15] killed.
[1:15:17] There's a reason why there's a red,
[1:15:20] there's a orange, and there's a green.
[1:15:23] There's a reason why they have these
[1:15:25] things is to set boundaries. When you
[1:15:28] have to stop, the other cars have to go.
[1:15:32] And the boundaries that we have as
[1:15:34] Christians, I want to put you a word
[1:15:37] that you're familiar with. It is holy
[1:15:39] decency. When the church finds his
[1:15:42] brotherly love, when the church finds
[1:15:44] his holy say, "So I love you, brother,
[1:15:46] and you're my brother. I have brotherly
[1:15:48] love and I come straight inside your
[1:15:49] house. Go straight inside your fridge
[1:15:50] and take out what I didn't put inside of
[1:15:53] there." That's not brother love. That is
[1:15:54] foolishness. That is disrespect. That is
[1:15:56] not holy decency. Brotherly kindness
[1:15:59] doesn't mean that you become
[1:16:00] disrespectful because I love you and we
[1:16:02] love one another. No,
[1:16:05] God put brotherly kindness there. He put
[1:16:08] holy decency and he put place in Christ.
[1:16:10] Let us bow our heads tonight.
[1:16:14] Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight. I
[1:16:17] love you and I thank you for your word,
[1:16:20] for your truth. I was astonished to see
[1:16:22] this thing on boundaries
[1:16:24] and Lord you know we have spoken on
[1:16:26] discipline character and character
[1:16:29] formation and the trial of our faith on
[1:16:31] different topics and so on but this was
[1:16:33] a little different tonight and I pray it
[1:16:35] strike the hearts of your children in a
[1:16:38] special way tonight and boundaries is
[1:16:40] not to imprison us but to free us. It is
[1:16:44] the freedom of order. It's the freedom
[1:16:47] to be in charge of our lives in the
[1:16:49] correct way. Israel came out but is
[1:16:52] Egypt was still inside of them. That's
[1:16:54] why when the when the pressure came,
[1:16:56] they say, "Why did you bring us out to
[1:16:58] die in the wilderness? But the
[1:17:00] wilderness was not the promised land.
[1:17:02] The journey is not the promised land.
[1:17:03] Father, the promised land is the
[1:17:05] promised land. And the promised land for
[1:17:06] the day is the Holy Ghost. Oh God, would
[1:17:08] you pour it out at night? Pour it upon
[1:17:10] your sons and daughters. Pour upon the
[1:17:11] Calebs, the elderly, Lord, upon the
[1:17:14] young people, upon those who would hear
[1:17:16] this uh sharing of this Bible word
[1:17:19] tonight. May it edify them and
[1:17:20] strengthen them. And may they take every
[1:17:22] rebuke differently because you said, "As
[1:17:24] many as I love and I rebuke and chasen
[1:17:27] as many as you love." The issue here is
[1:17:29] not our love, it's your love. And your
[1:17:31] love is elective love, not parental
[1:17:33] love. Your love is elective love. You
[1:17:35] could elect us to go through trials.
[1:17:37] Elect us to go through fiery furnace.
[1:17:38] Elect us to go through lion's den.
[1:17:40] Whatever is elective love. And because
[1:17:43] he elect us, we could rejoice because
[1:17:45] our name is written. Not because devils
[1:17:47] are subject to us, but because our names
[1:17:49] are written. Father, bless bless the
[1:17:51] church. Bless the service this coming
[1:17:52] Sunday. May you anoint with a double
[1:17:54] portion of your spirit your servant as
[1:17:55] you come to minister your word. May your
[1:17:57] pour the richest blessing upon him in a
[1:17:59] special way. And may we have a glorious
[1:18:01] time under the supernatural uncction of
[1:18:03] the Holy Ghost. May the pillar of fire
[1:18:04] drop down. May the cloud be there. The
[1:18:06] fire of God be there. May the anointing
[1:18:08] be there. Heal every sick Lord in our
[1:18:10] midst. And Father, cast out devils. May
[1:18:12] there be signs and wonders and miracles.
[1:18:14] And may each one that chose to be here
[1:18:16] tonight, may they leave here
[1:18:17] strengthening man. May they leave here
[1:18:19] edified. May they leave here built up in
[1:18:21] the name of Jesus. I ask it. I commit
[1:18:23] their lives into their hands in Jesus
[1:18:25] name. Amen. And amen. God bless you and
[1:18:29] thanks again for being here. Praise the
[1:18:31] Lord. Hallelujah. God be with you in a
[1:18:34] special way. Uh we tonight. God be with
[1:18:37] you.
