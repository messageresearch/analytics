each and every one of you again and tonight remember what you want to say welcome back to the ministers amen back safely thank God Amen God bless you and welcome back from the convention resource Psalms 62 praise God Heavenly Father we are so grateful tonight being a presence Lord we pray bless the exhortation bless you reading of your word and bless this time of praying a special way Lord may people draw closer to you family fill and change lives as we come to and we depend upon you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ with Thanksgiving amen and amen praise God Psalm 62 verse 1 to 8. truly my soul waited upon God from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved how long will you imagine Mischief against a man he shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall he be and as a torturing fence the only consult to cast him down from his Excellency the Delight in lies they blessed with their mouth but it feels inwardly Sila my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved and God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God this is trust in him at all times he people pour out your heart before him God is our refuge for us Sila amen and I want to focus on this here tonight I trust in him at all times he people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us father father blessed with tonight we pray in Jesus name amen and amen thank you Lord praise God so tonight I just want to talk about three words Trust heart and refuge and what is Trust trust is assured reliance on the character the ability and strength or truth of someone or something it is a place confidence in someone or something it is to Hope or expect confidently so when you trust someone you have an expectation of that person you know that he or she will not fail you in a particular regard you trust in something because you know it will work for you you can't prove it but you just know it will work for you you expect it to work with a high degree of confidence amen and I remember as a young Christian now this scene also to come in my mind or probably around age 12 13 around there and it's it's like this you take a baby or toddler and you put him to stand on top of a building and you show him his daddy or Mommy way down below and if Daddy says come jump down to me that little boy will be ready to jump into Daddy's arms someone he knows that he will get him daddy will surely catch him therefore he focuses more on Daddy and ignores the dangers that are connected to such a high jump he trusts his father he does not see the danger he sees Daddy and he trusts Daddy maybe he's too young to know the magnitude of the danger and maybe that's a good thing but he trusts his father somebody said trust tonight praise to God and we call that shy like faith trust in like a child [Music] so we tonight we must become like a beautiful child in the way we trust God we must trust God Without Limits trust God regardless trust God in spite of Amen so can somebody say Amen to that praise God praise God Amen thank you Lord an older child may say Daddy it's too high I'm afraid to do it it's too dangerous I might fall and enjoy myself I might even die see so the older child and the older we get we use reasoning he will use his senses to protect himself he begins to make sense or assess the risks involved so he trust his dad partially somewhat but not fully because he's afraid amen so Fear Can Trust fear can reduce faith so don't allow fear to hinder your trust in God don't allow fear to hinder your faith in God can we say Amen to that thank you Jesus hallelujah praise God I want to trust you Lord but I'm afraid this situation is too bad I want to trust you but this might happen I want to trust you but only if this happens see though you must trust God regardless amen praise God so notice he's kept on the boat he was trusting in God but then the conditions and the storms of life and his reasoning and his fear begin to choke his faith he began to sink but tonight keep your eyes on Jesus can we say Amen keep your eyes on Jesus trust him to see you through amen trust him to see you through tonight Hallelujah say Lord I Trust You Lord I trust you no matter what I trust you tonight Hallelujah I trust you with my life I trust you with my health I trust you at my family I trust you with my finances Hallelujah I trust you to finish that work that you started in my life you you started at work with me and you go to finish it Lord you are the author and finish up my feet praise God and I trust you tonight don't give up on God because he won't give up on you trust him tonight can somebody trust him tonight amen praise God Glory trust them praise God praise God so so David says trust in the Lord at all times not sometimes not just in the good times but all times and then Prophet says when you are sick trust him when you are down in a valley trusted when you are so low and the rocks are on top of your head still trusting when you're in the belly of a wheel and there's wheel all around you my like Jonah still trust him amen glory to God maybe you lost your job can you still trust him maybe you lost a loved one or a family member still trust him hallelujah praise God Amen maybe nobody seems to care about you trust him still God cares for you he cares for you tonight amen can we say amen he cares for you praise God praise God Amen thank you Jesus Glory so tonight trust the Lord with all your heart amen and some time ago I was looking up at the on YouTube at the turkey earthquake the earthquake activity and the aftermath and the magnitude of the destruction but what held my attention was the rescue workers and how they tried so hard to save this up any survivors buried under the rubble and I saw one particular piece where they found a baby a very young baby alive after four days or so and I saw the The Rescuer he held the baby when he picked him up and he sat down when he just burst into tears when he saved the baby it was like a big miracle you know and you know I'm considering people trapped on the ground and so on and can you imagine being trapped under there and you are alive but you can't even move your finger you're just alive Frozen there hoping that somebody will find you because you can't help yourself then hoping that somebody will find you and Rescue as brother Peter talked about on Wednesday they without us on Wednesday night amen so somebody is depending on us somebody's depending on us amen you know so but many times conditions around us are so rough and they may seem like there's no way off nowhere else it's totally impossible but tonight I don't care if one million persons around you die you are one in a million today Hallelujah you will not die but you will live to declare the works of the Lord can somebody say Amen tonight hallelujah hallelujah somehow somehow you can trust in the Lord somehow you can look to him and believe that he's going to bring you through you don't know how but God tonight you can say do it for me do it for me praise God I know Lord you will bring me out oh God I trust in you can we give the Lord a hundred praise today hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen you don't know how it's going to work out but somehow trust God and he will work it out praise God David said in Psalms trust in the Lord at all times ye people all times amen praise God if you look at the three Hebrew boys they say oh great king I don't mean to be disrespectful it is not what I mean to be rude or just to be in different old great king but you see we only bow to the one true and living God and okay we declined to bow to this statue you can do whatever you want with us but we trust in our God In God We Trust Hallelujah you can hit the fire seven times hotter it does not matter Our God will deliver us but even if he does not deliver us we still want Power hallelujah praise God We Trust in the true and living God tonight can we say Amen can we say Amen we are confident we are confident we are fully persuaded we know whom we believe in Oh Glory to God tonight that's the kind of trust amen that we must have can we trust him like that tonight will you trust him like that tonight praise God and can we trust him for Revival we say Lord send a Revival we need it we must have it send the bride's Revival a holy ghost Revival a seven Thunder Revival he will send it he will send it do you believe that tonight he will send it amen Oh Glory to God and we come tonight to ask for it in prayer we came to ask and seek him and call for it tonight in prayer praise God he said ask and it shall be given amen seek the Lord with all your heart praise God amen so trust the Lord but the heart three words tonight trust heart and refuge the heart David says pour out your heart before him your heart pour it out we are looking for Revival start by pouring out your heart before him tonight as an individual empty out everything in that heart all the issues of life all your weaknesses and habits and you'll be setting sins and your complexes and all the baggage of the past pour it out tonight let's pour it out tonight we want Revival but let's start with the heart all the memories and the hurts and the disappointments and all the past experiences that are holding you back tonight is the night to pour it out somebody say pour it out tonight pour it out pour it out pour it out praise God don't hold back tonight you just pour it on tonight is an opportunity in prayer for each and every one of us a personal link with God tonight so you just pour it out tonight and make room tonight for Revival make room for the Holy Ghost pour out all the old stuff tonight pour it out empty it out tonight and make room tonight for Revival make room for the Holy Ghost make room for joy and peace and the love of God and fill it up with praises and Thanksgiving praise God Amen praise God praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen glory glory glory glory glory glory so it's a pouring out and I'm filling up Amen Hallelujah Lord I know I'm not what I ought to be just yet but I thank you that I'm not what I used to be I'm living in the game and not in the gap of Glory to God Amen Hallelujah yes Lord help me Lord fill my cup Lord I Lift It Up come and quench this this thing in my soul oh praise God do it for me Lord Do It For Me Lord do it for your people tonight do it for your name say praise God yes Lord give him a hand of praise to them Hallelujah amen amen Glory so Revival we're talking about Revival but Revival is a hot thing it's a hot thing in Revival your heart becomes so tender you get so soft before God not just staring around and looking around and just going through motions but you actually get your heart gets tender before God and you get so soft before God so thirsty for God so forgiving you're forgiving everyone it's so loving and so humble Hallelujah that's the disposition of our heart and Revival amen and thank God for this time of prayer and fasting and and consecration you just can't it get you just can't get enough of God you want so much more and and God is a function of infinity you cannot trap him you can't get enough of him hallelujah praise God Allah said last time yes it is inspiration yesterday's anointing is not good enough for today you want a fresh experience you want Power after power baptism after baptism filling and refilling and refilling praise God it's free that's what Revival is all about revive Hallelujah amen so pour out your heart before God even tonight pour it out amen in Revival you don't have time to waste because you will be so busy pouring out your heart before the Lord day or night you might be going to work you're doing whatever you're making up the bed you're washing the dishes but you just pouring out in your spirit that's when Revival amen we walk around us if we are pretty good we are the best and nicest people or maybe we are but in Revival you will begin to see how much stuff coming out of that Wicked heart in Revival you will see how much stuff will come out of that Wicked heart make your calling an election show yeah so yes we are nice people you're right but there are still things that are hard that need to stuff that needs to come out hiding somewhere in a corner oh God help us help us we need Revival because listen that's tough in there that's hiding won't make it on the other side the only thing that's going to make it on the other side in that heart is perfect love to all this other s you gotta get rid of it and that's what Revival is for Amen to put all that out and put the perfect love of God in there that will and then we will make it on the other side so Revival must come to boil all that trash out of our hearts and lives can we see him in tonight do we need Revival are we desperate enough for Revival you know hundreds of people walking around thinking that they are just good and nice and shine but it's Perfection that must be in the heart so we are not good until in this and Perfection resides in there amen perfect love glory amen so Lord send it send the Revival father send it Lord we need it we pray for it tonight and let that be part of your burden tonight as we pray amen so it's not just an expression send a Revival we need it because the Revival is what's going to put all that trash out of our lives and get us in a place where God wants us to be David says my soul waited upon God and we say tonight teach us how to wait their Lord hallelujah wait in faith weighted love don't wait in vexation and disappointment that's the wrong attitude to wait but wait patiently how wait patiently one piece broadensive patience is a holy ghost virtue amen I'll read it later wait patiently so my soul waited upon God and while I wait I will worship while I wait I will give thanks while I wait I will trust him tonight we talk about trust we're talking about the heart are we talking about God is our refuge oh yes Lord the right mental attitude will bring the Divine promise to pass can we say Amen can we see amen so while we say we have waited on the promise wait in love wait patiently weight giving thanks for giving praise because we trust him what is trust absolute confidence in somebody or something so you know it's going to come to party you just have to wait thanking him and praising him patiently glory to God Seven Thunders give feed though it tarries wait wait for it and love wait worship and wheat praise and Hallelujah David said he's my rock and my salvation and my defense and my refuge I shall not be greatly moved he didn't say it won't be moved he said I shall not be greatly moved so tonight you are tied to the Rock it's like a ship in the on the ocean tight and anchor many

internal wrestlings and struggling struggles and disappointments will happen and the devil will try to make you give up on God his aim is for you to curse God and say forget this Christian thing and

blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord point to Jesus thank you Lord thank you Father praise God Amen just before we close off and pray I just want to leave a key with you amen you may ask the question how do I trust God how do I trust God and you know while I was praying that this came to me hey you take your faith and you rested upon his word rested upon the word of God and you hold that feet right there and that's trusting take a faith because your faith must rest on something solid so yeah so God's word cannot fail and God and the word is God and God is his word so you're taking faith and you're rested upon God's word and you hold it right there and that's trust in God tonight hallelujah amen so for example if you are sick you are sick you need a wood you need a wood to rest your faith on you see by his stripes I am healed and you take that you take your faith and you rest it on that word of God and you hold your feet right there and that's trusting God to me hallelujah praise God praise God praise God amen so for example if if you're planting a seed in the ground you put the seed in the ground two days after you go back and you know for sure that city is going to germinate how do you know you trust the process of nature you trust the principles of nature you then try to you then Force the sea to germinate you just trusted the process and the principles of nature and that's exactly how we trust we cannot figure it out we cannot work it out we just take our faith and rest it on the promised word of God and hold our faith right there you know many years ago when we're over preaching you he would say a coach remember Abraham the birds have a law and they just fly the fishes have a law where they just swim but the Christian has a law and the law is to just let go and let God have his way and that speaks about trusting just the whole Christian experience is about trusting God amen can we say Amen tonight praise God so take a fit and rested upon God's word and just hold it right there trust him for every situation tonight amen can we say Amen there is no failure in God tonight praise God praise God praise God even so as we just want to close up and pray tonight it's just about our heads amen heavenly father and thank you for this time of prayer teach us how to trust you Lord Jesus teach us how to let go and let you come and take control not to fight up and try to work it out but just let go and let God have his way and to trust you more it is so sweet to trust in Jesus Hallelujah and Lord as we pray tonight we want
