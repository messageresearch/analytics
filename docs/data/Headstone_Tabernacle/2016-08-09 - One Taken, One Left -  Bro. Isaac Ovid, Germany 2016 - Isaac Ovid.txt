you may be seated for a few minutes amen Hallelujah would I'd like to greet the convention this morning in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ it is certainly a great honor to be here amen among Believers of like Precious Faith I'd like to greet you on behalf of my wife sister Karen who is here I'd also like to greet the convention on behalf of my pastor but theid who is here and the church headstone Tabernacle it is truly an honor to stand before for the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ amen I do want to send special greetings to those who are connected live on the internet and wherever these tapes may be played I want to thank brother zigar colen Brena his wife his family and the church in utmach for the faith and courage to host this International summer convention I want to salute all the pastors ministers and the churches that are here we are so happy to be in Fellowship can the church say Amen how many appreciate our precious brother the Ed bisc what a message yesterday morning brother Ed may God richly bless you thank you for your labor of love for the Bride of Jesus Christ and our brother Tim puit in the evening yesterday God bless you brother Tim and what can we say about our brother John con last night how many appreciate the message last night amen amen amen amen amen so I'm under great expectation to see God do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think and God's Prophet taught us that you could only get what you expect he said if you expect to see simple things you'll you'll see simp simple things but you expect to see Jesus Christ on the scene you will see Jesus Christ on the scene so I don't know how high your expectation is this morning but I know how high my expectation is this morning because I serve a big God I serve a powerful God he is an eternal God and he has never failed me yet and he will never fail you can the church say Amen so I feel unworthy this morning to speak after the brothers who have gone before but it's my lot this morning to stand before the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ so I'd like to go straight to the word this morning if you have your Bibles would you turn with me to two portions of scripture reading from The Book of Matthew 24 and reading First Corinthians 15 Matthew 24 and verse 40 then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be grinding at the Mill the one shall be taken and the other left watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh and reading from First Corinthians chapter 15 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and reading verse 51 behold I show you a mystery which shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed can we bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you this morning to be in the house of God lord there are so many places we could have been this morning but you have brought us here today from the east from the west from the north from the south from almost 35 countries father we have gathered Lord under the shed blood father Lord we thank you for the blood that covers Us this morning we thank you for a message of Life a message of power we thank you for a prophet in this day Lord we thank you Lord for calling us out Lord of this evil world and any man could read the scriptures but it takes the Holy Spirit to breathe life upon it may you walk out the pages of the Bible and may you deliver your people may you heal the sick this morning Lord if there's a backslider in the house today may you restore them if there's somebody who doesn't know you in the power of the Resurrection May they have an experience this morning with a pillar of Fire May the angel that one with the swep back Wings may he move through the camp this morning Lord and put a mark upon those that sigh and cry Lord may you break every chain Hallelujah may you break every shackle Satan the blood of Jesus is against you father we thank you for such a time as this that we could feel your presence that we could feel your anointing may you take me out of the way and may you speak speak directly to your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says and the church says amen you may be seated this morning so I have a title this morning and my title is one taken one left one taken one left and my subject rapturing condition my inspiration the token will be displayed and in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed God's Prophet said God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's what we want to speak about this morning the mystery of God this world is a mystery to this day scientists are still trying to understand understand what is happening around us whatever we cannot explain is a mystery until you understand something it is a mystery to you I'm holding a microphone this morning without a cord it's a mystery how the sound is moving from this instrument through the speakers this didn't happen a 100 years ago it was here all the time but it was a mystery and this great God is a mystery God himself is a mystery and and way back before there was a sun before there was a moon before there was a star before you had a trial before you had a test before you felt pain in your body before you ever had a headache this great mysterious God he existed all by himself he was the self-existing one Lord he couldn't even be called God because God's prophet daers God means object of worship and when he existed by himself there was nobody to worship him so God had certain things he had to express so he created the angels and the angels they began to worship him and it began to change who he was God was expressing who he was he was omnipotent he was omniscient he is all powerful but God had to find a way he had to find a way to take this great mystery and bring it down to Simplicity you don't hear me this morning our minds could never understand this great God but if the Holy Ghost you don't hear me this morning if the holy ghost ever gets a hold of you something comes over you you could never understand this great God with your intellect you could never understand this great God by reading books you could never understand this great God unless you meet him for yourself because one experience with the supernatural it takes over you it takes control of you can somebody say Amen you may be seated Hallelujah you may be seated for a minute I'm a young person Hallelujah I was not privileged to be on the earth when God's prophet he walked the Earth but I believe every word from this prophet and this Prophet taught us that if there is no noise there is no God can the church say Amen because God is the object of worship and worship has nothing to do with what you have worship has nothing to do with what you feel worship has nothing to do with what country you come from worship has nothing to do with what you believe worship has everything to do with who he is he is God he is Jehovah Gyra he is the provider he is the alpha he is the Omega he is the beginning and he is the ending he is the first he is the last there is none like him there is no one greater we are not here we are not here in this convention to hear a man speak we are here to meet God himself brother Brandon brought a message to introduce Messiah and I say this morning Messiah is on the earth Messiah is on the earth can the church say Amen you may be seated I feel happy this morning I feel excited this morning you may be seated one time there was a woman in the Bible you see something happens when you catch a revelation of who you are what you are born to do until that Revelation becomes real to you you walk around anyway you walk into the bar you walk into the club you live all kinds of life but when the Holy Ghost introduces himself to you you cannot explain it you cannot tell somebody about it but something comes over you you may be seated are there any Christians in the house this morning do we have any believers in the house this morning do you love Jesus this morning will you serve him this morning can the church say amen hallelujah you may be [Applause] so this mystery that we are speaking about am do you know that you are a mystery I want to take my time brother zigma we got many translators I want to make sure you get it young people you are a mystery your school will never understand you your teachers will never understand you your neighbors will never understand you your family will never understand you because you are a mystery the only person who knows this mystery he's above [Applause] Hallelujah let me say that again the only person who knows who you are he's above in other words your pastor doesn't even know who you are the preacher don't even know who you are because who you are could only come from the one who wrote the names in the book Hallelujah before the foundation of the world some names were written in the book and every name that was written will be delivered brother brandom said in the message taking sides with Jesus he said the message will fall into the hands of the predestinated you didn't find this message this message found you in Germany in Canada in Sierra Leon in Ivory Coast this message spoken by a prophet you may be seated when he spoke those words once it's spoken because the Bible says my word shall never return void once it's spoken over your life you could turn around you could hide like Jonah but that word will find you wherever you are that word will find your son that word will find your daughter that word will find every predestinated [Applause] seed you may be seated can the church amen can I slow down a little bit can I take my time a little bit so this great mystery it was too big this mysterious God he was too powerful he could do anything he is Sovereign but God wanted to express himself he did not want to remain a mystery and this mystery was so great amen it took centuries huj for him to slowly reveal himself he never wanted to be complicated this message is not supposed to be complicated but the BR brought a message of Simplicity if God could take Peter who couldn't write his name and do another book of Acts God could take you today you don't need a degree to meet this Jesus you don't need education to meet this Jesus you don't hear me this morning you may be seated this great mystery of God he wanted anybody to be able to talk with him you could be 8 years old or you could be 99 years old this great mysterious God wanted to commune with [Applause] somebody don't worry this is just the background I haven't gotten to the message yet I'm just testing the temperature because brother brandom said the atmosphere must be right for the miraculous to take place so we're turning the heat up sometime may take some time but we're going to get there we're going to heat this place up until your fears don't matter until your sickness doesn't matter we're going to turn the heat up until your mistakes and your mind doesn't matter anymore somebody say Amen so you may be seated am so God had to find a way to take this great mystery and bring it into simplicity so brother Bram taught us that when David was living and when Moses was living and when Abraham was living they did not even know what they were living out Hallelujah so God spoke to Moses and Moses died not fully understanding in that there was a deeper mystery being unfolded through his life because God had certain attributes he was a deliverer but at the beginning there was nobody to deliver that's right amen are you with me this morning so God picked Moses to express that mystery of Deliverance because it was Christ in Moses are you with me this morning God in him was the attribute to be a Shepherd so he had to find somebody to reveal this mystery of being a Shepherd so he found a boy called David can the church say Amen what is God doing he is revealing himself he is slowly unveiling who he is because he wants to introduce himself to his people he wants you to know a god with skin on it can the church say Amen so God found somebody named Joshua and he said Joshua you will Express the warrior that I am can the church say amen he found a man called Elijah and he said Elijah you will perform the prophet that I am can the church say Amen but every one of them was only expressing a part of this great mystery of God now there is a difference between part of the mystery and the fullness of the mystery are you with me this morning Hallelujah so the entire of the Old Testament was parts of the mystery it was a part here it was a part there it was a part there but when Jesus came Jesus Christ was the entire mystery of God revealed can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah are you with me this morning you may be seated so young people you are a mystery your trials are a part of your mystery your ups and your Downs they are a part of your mystery it's a process that you don't yet understand but there's nothing by accident there is nothing by chance God does not make mistakes there is no mistake this morning you couldn't be here unless he wanted you here this morning and because you are here you are going to receive the Holy Ghost because you are here you shall be delivered because you are here you shall have an experience with the same Pillar of Fire with the same angel of God can the church say Amen you may be seated I'm still warming up haven't gotten to the text yet can the Church Say Amen yeah Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice huah of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophet can the church say Amen so all these centuries this was leading up to something until a seventh angel was under scene to tie up all the loose to connect the dots to make it simple so that in our day we didn't see Moses we didn't see Joshua we didn't see Elijah some of us didn't even see the prophet but in the days of his voice the mystery is finished no more mystery no more secrets it's open to us that's why I could worship that's why I could shout it doesn't matter to me what anybody else does because I know I come from God and I'm going back to God can the church say amen and there is no devil could hold me there is no demon could stop me there is no sickness can hold me you may be seated in The Minister's meeting I said the devil could have some but he cannot have all God will have some young people in 2016 God will have some individuals in Ukraine in Russia in Germany in France in Africa who will testify that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday he is the same today he is the same forever you may be seated but the brandham told us he said it's easy to talk about yesterday because it's already happened he say it's ni to talk about the future because anybody could talk about the future but God he is the same yesterday he is the same today and he's the same forever s is this the time because something is happening right now demons are leaving right now you are being healed right now Revelation is coming to you right now the power of God is here right now we don't need to wait till tomorrow we don't need to wait till next month now Faith is now Faith is can the church say amen hallelujah amen hallelujah you may be seated so when you were saved when you were saved that was only a part of the mystery when you came into this message that was only a part of this mystery you are here in this convention but that's only a part of the mystery there's coming a time when the mystery will be finished can the church say Amen but the brandom said a mystery is scripture previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but a supernatural element Still Remains despite the Revelation so God give you a revelation but despite the Revelation that you have there is still a supernatural element that remains can the church say amen amen so what we want to get friends is not just a divine revelation and I tell young people all the time if there was anyone in scripture who had a revelation was Peter because in Matthew 16 when Jesus is fellowshipping with his disciples he asks the question who do men say that I am and these brothers were spiritual and they began to tell Jesus all the good things that they had heard people say about him but that was the Preamble that was not the real question Jesus want wanted because he is a god of the individual it's not about what this group says and what this Minister says and what that person over there says he switch on them and say who do you Hallelujah the IND who do you say that I am and all of a sudden the ministers put their notepads away and they begin to move back a little bit because they had no revelation of who he was but all of a sudden Peter said don't to cry the son of the Living God and when Peter spoke this Jesus said Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you you did not hear this in a convention no Minister sat with you but my father my father give you a revelation and if you ever get a revelation from God nothing can move you nothing could shake you nothing could change you somebody say Amen but you may be seated I'm trying to go somewhere I want you to understand [Applause] because I was I I'm born and grew up in this message I'm young but I'm grw up in this message Hallelujah and I've heard people explain this and explain that and teach this and teach that I'm not a preacher I'm not a minister I'm just to nobody trying to tell everybody about somebody who could change anybody but the one thing I know Peter had a revelation and a few verses down Jesus the Bible said for the first time he's able to reveal a secret to his disciples that he could not say before so he was checking them out before he could open their understanding a little further so when he was sufficiently satisfied that they had answered the question of who he was he began to explain well I have to go and be crucified and and he began to tell him and Peter said no and this same Peter who had a revelation God was get the behind me Satan because even though he had a revelation of the message of the hour he had still a destination was still an upper room experience that Peter had to get to connect his Revelation to the Holy Ghost despite the Revelation a supernatural element still remained there are many people here with a revelation but I feel it's time for that supernal element I believe it's time for the Holy Ghost itself I believe it's time for God himself you may be seated what did brother brandham said he said the pillar of fire will be veiled in the adopted Sons that's not a book that's not a tape that's not you hearing a message that's God himself in the socket of your soul can the church say Amen is that what you want is that your expectation you may be seated you know in the upper room in the upper room every individual in the upper room got their own liqu of fire I couldn't take the fire from my brother I couldn't take the fire from the pastor every individual had their own experience with God and I challenge you today if you have never had an experience with God don't you leave this convention until you hold on to the horns of the Altar and say Lord I've heard by the hearing of the a but now this is my time This Is My Season I'm not going back I've come too far I've come too far I've traveled for too long to give up now I'm not going to turn back I need something more a book is not good enough a tape is not good you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah Peter Andrew James John these brothers walked with Jesus could you imagine Walk With Jesus talk with Jesus sit next to Jesus see what Jesus is eating see what Jesus is drinking taking notes about the way he lived what an experience to see Jesus walking on on two feet but yet still these brothers were hiding in the upper room they were afraid after three and a half years of being with the word itself these brothers witnessed Jesus's resurrection Ministry there was no doubt in their minds that he was risen the Bible says he opened their understanding to the scriptures so they had seen him they had seen the Miracles they understand standing was opened and yet still they were hiding they were afraid and when you read the scripture I believe it's over about 66 times Jesus says fear not you could check the number fear not fear not it is I fear not when he's walking under the water he says fear not and after all of this Peter is afraid James is afraid but there was something that was greater than their fear it was not a revelation it was not their understanding being opened but the Bible says all of a sudden there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it fill all the house where they were sitting and then Peter walked out of the upper room and he was staggering under the anointing he couldn't even keep straight anymore everything he knew was finished he couldn't even look at anybody well said this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel this is that this is the Holy Ghost this is the Holy Ghost what we need today is more Holy Ghost Services what we need is another day of Pentecost can the church say Amen you may be seated I'm going to get to my text in a few minutes Hallelujah the ROM taught us that you are not the believer but the word in you that seed in you that's the believer so you didn't come to this convention the word in you is crying out for something that's why you are here it's a mystery trying to express itself you may be seated let's talk about Jes Jesus Does anybody love to talk about Jesus you know how many meetings people have and they don't even talk about Jesus and I thought that's the reason that we are here to talk about Jesus so I want to talk about Jesus for a few minutes then I'll get to my text but I want you to think for a minute of Jesus as a little boy Growing Up 5 years old 6 years old 10 years old he's Young I'm sure he had friends he played with he's a he's a young boy he's growing up but he's a mystery amen he goes to the temple like all the other young people but he's a mystery whatever school they had he went there but he is a mystery amen the Bible says in Luke 4 he was in the synagogue as was his custom it was not the first time time in Luke 4 that Jesus was in the temple he was always in church but nobody knew who he really was nobody paid any attention to him he was coming in and out the meetings like everybody else he looked like everybody else dressed like everybody else there was nothing about him that would draw attention to him because he was a mystery this was brother Jesus could you imagine in the service turn around and greet your brother and and they're turning around and greeting one another and Jesus is in the synagogue Hallelujah I want you to think about it friends but but a different day came and they and they invited brother Jesus would you come and and read for us he's a mystery nobody knows who he is and he gets there like everybody else who is called before to read the scriptures and he finds a scripture spirit of the Lord is upon me for he had anointed me to and everybody thinks it's an ordinary service because this is what you normally do in a service Hallelujah come there are people sleeping on the side and taking notes in the back and that's brother Jesus but all of a sudden when he when he closed the scriptures before he walks away he says something he says this day this scripture is fulfilled and all of a sudden the mystery of who he was was made clear can the church say Amen oh are you hearing me this morning you may be seated and brother brandham said if you read the Bible and do not see Jesus in every verse you need to read it again yes I'll say that one more time he said if you read the Bible and you don't see Jesus in every verse go read it again and again and again because it's all about Jesus every scripture in the Old Testament was pointing towards Jesus so when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive that was scripture it was a word it was spoken but listen that word had to wait until a body came along to manifest that scripture are you with me this morning I want you to get this then I'll get to my text so the word went out a virgin shall conceive and that word it's scripture and that word had to wait until a body came along because the word expressed itself through something until a body came along to manifest it so people look at scripture but when God looks at it he doesn't see scripture Hallelujah am we read scripture and we see scripture but when God looks at it he's not seeing scripture he is seeing names Hallelujah so when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive God is saying that's Mary but the brandham taught us that God is coming for a book A book of redemption a book of names so it's a book of names he is coming for so when the book says the voice of one crying in the wilderness that's in your book but when God is looking he's saying that's John the Baptist Hallelujah can the church amen so for years people read Malachi 45 and 6 and people say that's scripture but when God looks he said that's William Brandon and he's coming for a book of names and when God speaks of a people that know their God that shall do exploits he was speaking about somebody was it you was it you was it you brother I say today you are the words in the book and every name in the book shall be delivered somebody say Amen Glory Hallelujah you may be seated that's why I have faith this morning to say you shall be filled you shall be delivered you shall have a revelation you shall meet a pillar of Fire that's your promise that's your inheritance because every word that is written must come to pass can the church say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah so the book said in Joel in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh that's the words in the book but when God looks he's seeing Peter he's seeing the upper room because Peter comes out and says this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel now listen friends and this is for the young people Peter did not know that he was written in the book Peter backslid Peter denied Christ Peter made mistakes but he was still in the book Hallelujah when Jesus called Peter he knew everything Peter would do amen but he was not looking at what Peter would do he was looking at the words in the book because heaven and Earth would pass away but these words in the book will never pass away can the church say Amen it was going to take some time for Peter to get a div divine revelation of who he was so what Peter did could not change his name in the book and Young Brother young sister your mistakes your failures your past what you have gone through will not change God's mind about you thank you he loves you he cares for you he'll take care of you he will make all things to work together for good because you are written in the back part of his mind how could he forget you can the church say Amen so let me strike my text you love the Lord this morning so let me strike my text one taken one left so all of this great mystery of God is Not Just for us to know Mysteries and know the message and because the scribes and the Pharisees they knew the scriptures they had the books they had the tapes and when Messiah walked among them they did not even recognize him so for all these years God has been waiting for the right season he has been waiting for the right people because the greatest Escape that the world has ever witnessed is about to take place an escape for for those who sigh and cry for the abomination in the city and Escape for those who separate themselves from the things of the world and Escape for them who want the Holy Ghost and Escape for them that want to be adopted and Escape for them that want to be perfected because brother bradam said nothing will touch the bride Satan will be powerless before this bride of Jesus Christ and the angel of the Lord is on the earth now Messiah is on the earth now he was here with the prophet but when God took the prophet away the angel never left the angel is still here but the Bram said fixing things around for the coming of the Lord so the angel is here right now he's moving through the aisles he is seeing your attitude he is looking at your heart he sees if you really want him and I ask a question this morning if God were to Grant the deepest desire of your heart what is that desire this morning what do you want God to do for you in this convention what have you been sighing about what have you been crying about as for the contest said last night God gave the children of Israel a promise but they had to cry out and God could now say I have heard the cries of my people they are not comfortable with being in the message they don't want to be church members they don't want to just know that it was in this message and it was in that message and that's what he said and no they needed something more they needed Deliverance they needed a go who could break the chains break the shackles break the power of sin break you are born to be free you are born to fly the laws of this world are not your laws we come from a kingdom with higher laws you don't hear me this morning we come from another world we come from another place we are not from time we come from eternity and we are going back to Eternity can the church say [Applause] Amen friends he promised that he would never leave you he promised that he will never forsake you he will be with you in your trials he will take you through your trials and I believe one of the brothers I believe it was brother the Tim pu it yesterday said there is no way through this there's only one way that's up stop trying to figure out how you're going to get through this we need to figure out how to get up can the church say Amen because there promised a rapture we shall not all sleep but there's coming a time where somebody is going to be changed and this Mortal will put on immortality can the church say Amen you may be seated there is a way of Escape there is a way of escape this morning brother brandham said in the message the first seal he says at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word amen as God helped me tonight to show you that we are to receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there listen carefully and reveal the whole secret of God and he gives the purpose purpose Hallelujah for the rapturing of the church so the purpose of God that was revealed as the entire Secret Of God is not for us to have conventions it's not for us to make churches it's for the Rapture of the church can the church say Amen somebody is going to leave this place but there's a promise before we leave this place the sick will be healed before we leave this place place your children will be restored before we leave this place the Dynamics will connect to the mechanics before we leave this place once more the world will hear direct from God you may be seated listen friends God could never take a man off the scene unless his work is finished Glory let me say this again God could never take a man off the scene unless his work is finished brother brandham did his part yes and if that messenger was to turn the hearts of the children back yes and to get the whole mystery of God for the Rapture and God took him away it means that job is finished every mystery is revealed the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church it's here brother Bram said rapture and faith is laying in the message so what are we waiting for but the P said one day the pride will get to know who she is and then the Rapture will go s is this the time for the bride to get a revelation of who she is you may be seated brother if you ever get a revelation of who you are you'll never be sad Hallelujah you'll never be depressed you will always have a smile on your face you will always look at your trials and say that's all you got devil is that the best you got is that the best you got there's nothing that stop me from going where God wants me to go bring your best devil bring your best because I'm a Child of God give it your best shot because all things will work together for good give me your best shot because I'm pretty destinated for the Rapture and when the devil is looking for you you'll be gone the Rapture will go because you are predestinated for it can the church say Amen you may be seated I'm not going to be too much longer but but brandham did his part and now he's waiting for you and I Paul is waiting for you and I brother Ram said the sleeping sees are waiting for somebody to come to Perfection to bring on the resurrection so there's some waiting going on the whole creation is groaning the weather is groaning the trees are growing the nations are groaning it that's why I said I don't care what they do out there the politics the Nations the government that's not my promise the devil has his job we have our job listen I've seen I've seen ministers take their time and explain the tribulation and the vials and the woes and the plagues I can't criticize nobody but the vials not mine plagues not mine tribulation not mine Rapture that's mine you may be seated I've heard ministers preach you may be seated these divinely reveal mystery truths and they open up every single mystery but the brandom himself said there are some real seeds for the bride brother the brandham spoke about the pope he spoke about serpent seed that's wonderful but I'm not serpent seed I have nothing to do with the Pope I don't need to hear about it tell me how do I get out of here you may be seated that's what's important that's what I need because I don't belong here I'm waiting to meet David I want to see Joshua I got to testify to Moses they want to hear how you made it in the evil age 2016 when all hell is against you 200 million Devils Loos against you but you made it you are Overcomers you stood the test you stood as real Christians you stood as real men wom of God hallelujah you may be seated Hallelujah my my My Oh Glory Hallelujah it it feels good in here now it feels good there's somebody want to go to the Rapture somebody wants the Holy Ghost somebody wants that old fashion sin killing sky blue Holy Ghost Revival oldfashioned sin killing sky blue Holy Ghost Revival you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah it's all right to praise him it's all right to worship he loves it when you worship he loves it when you praise him he inhabits the Praises of his people he loves it when you say hallelujah he loves it when you say thank you Jesus he loves it when you say even so come Lord Jesus come even so glory to God you may be seated hallelujah hallu hallelujah could you imagine this is the hardest age this is the toughest age could you imagine God in his great wisdom he couldn't send David to this age this age is too hard for David this age is too to hard for Daniel this age is too hard for the three Hebrew boys this age is too difficult for Peter so God had to find some people who are qualified who are qualified to be in this age they have no strength of their own they have no ability of their own but God predestinated them and he put a seed inside of your soul and that seed it might be covered up this morning but that's all right that's all right once the seed is there every seed must bring forth after its kind there's no other way that's the law of God and God's law unbreakable God's law unchangeable he says I am the Lord and I change not can the church say Amen oh I'm excited come on young people come on young people come on young people oh Hallelujah you may be [Applause] seated brother brandham brought a message for young people he brought a message for a new generation it's been 50 years since brother brandham left those that brother brandham ministered to 99% they're no longer here but there's a new generation that God called out they were not there in the 50s they were not there in the 60s but they started maybe in the 70s maybe the 80s maybe the 90s maybe to the 2000s but something got a hold of you you couldn't explain to your family what pulled you from the Catholic Church what pulled you from the Methodist Church what pulled you from the Baptist Church but it was a pull in your heart and young people it doesn't matter what they do in the school or on the job you will never be comfortable in the world you could never fit in you are cut differently so you try to fit here doesn't fit fit here doesn't fit but the brandom call it OD ball there's something different about you you try drinking it it didn't work for you you tried the singing didn't work for you the songs they don't make sense but you struggle up one day down one day you got to go to work it's not easy to go to work all the co-workers they live a certain way you go to the lunchroom you're trying to eat you don't know if you want to pray for your meal because everybody's watching you and you you go this whole tug of wall anybody anybody in the house they tell you you have to dress a certain way to be professional you got to be a profession Prof so you got to dress a certain way and you got to go to certain work functions because you want to get a promotion and when my Bible tells me promotion doesn't come from the east or the West it comes from the Lord I don't care if your boss doesn't like you once God likes you that's all that matters listen you may be seated if God would change the law so that Mary would come to Bethlehem God could change your boss he could change your company he could change the law to make sure that you are taken care of can the church say [Applause] Amen you may be seated but that's a problem today a lot of people today they don't want to prove God they don't want to prove God so when God went to Gideon say Gideon th Mighty Man of Valor Gideon looked around yes he said wait a minute wrong man I'm from the smallest tribe my family is the smallest family and I'm the smallest one in my family but when God began to talk to him Gideon's question was if God is God then where are all the Miracles he wanted to see something more than what he had heard about he had heard about the Red Sea he had heard about coming out of Egypt but he was not there so he said if this is real then then then where are all the Miracles and in our day we say where is the Lord God of Elijah because we know Elijah we know about Elijah but we want the god of Elijah is that your prayer is that your expectation can the Church Say Amen Hallelujah you may be [Applause] seated you know it's so wonderful Glory Glory but the brandham would look out into the audience and he would see all kinds of things one time but the brandham said he he preferred to go out in solitude at times because he saw what was in the hearts of the people around him and he needed to escape a little bit and I could just imagine God is looking down right now and he's seeing what you have on the inside that you don't even know is there some of you haven't lift your hands in a long time because you've been under so much pressure but you know what brother Bram said he said the law of gravity keeps things down he said but when you lift your hand he said it takes something Supernatural to defy the law of gravity and you could lift your hands and say thank you Jesus Hallelujah the fact that you can lift your hands to God shows that there's a supernatural element that is connecting to something higher because gravity wants to keep you down but there's a power trying to pull you up because you belong in Heavenly places you belong in the heavenlies where was thou when the sons of God shouted for Joy you were there you were there you were there you were shouting can the Church Say Amen Hallelujah so we're talking about the Rapture and Satan doesn't know when Satan doesn't know how Satan doesn't know who because this Rapture is a mystery because if he knew he could do great damage so the devil had only one option to try to infiltrate the church and I said to the young people the devil is not in the world trying to get those he already has he already has them so the Devil comes to church greets the Believers infiltrate with all kinds of doctrines and ideas and and and I think it's this and I think it's that but Brandon brought one message not 5 10 12 82 one message get ready for the Rapture one message destroy the works of darkness because Satan came into God's Eden but now we're in Satan's Eden and God has a bride who will not be like Eve and be deceived and give the devil the final knockout punch because after the devil met David he got back up he met Joshua he got back up he met Elijah he got back up but the Bram said when he met Jesus he went away for a season because Christ himself was on the Earth but over the ages the devil was always there looking around trying to see what he could do but God waited until he got the Navy Seals Special Forces secret agents in this age individuals who don't look like they are agents they don't look like they are soldiers but they are soldiers anyhow young people calebs they look that's why brother Brandon said when you get over there you'll see people you never thought would make it see people you never thought would make it so Satan had one strategy to try to stop you from getting access to the Rapture to make sure that you do not receive the Holy Ghost that's what the devil is trying to do brother bam said in the message question and answer he said before there was a world you were in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost amen because he knew you'd be wanting it and he chose you himself he chose you in Christ listen before you or Jesus any of you was on the earth and He sent Jesus to die to prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost listen to The Prophet's words to think it's not what I wanted it wasn't my desires it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing it had not one thing to do with it but before the world ever started God saw us and put our name on the Lamb's Book of Life talk about God can the church say Amen I'm not going to be too much longer so we spoke about Malachi 4 revealed many things he spoke of a power coming to the the church he spoke of the manifestation of the sons of God once more the world will hear direct from God he spoke of a perfect Church a church with Jesus Christ walking in it a church where sin cannot stay in it the same Jesus who healed the sick raised the dead would be veiled in that church in individuals the mystery that has been hid which is Christ in you the hope of glory and what is revealed the Bible says it belongs to us can the church say amen and you want to tell me I can't be happy and you want to tell me I can't shout when what is revealed belongs to us but the Rapture friends will be a defining moment in the Eternal Mind Of God as he looks at time is divided into two categories before the Rapture and after the Rapture this message is the same message get ready for the Rapture let us not lose the focus friends of why God sent the prophet the purpose of the evening time message is to bring the bride into rapturing condition friends what good is it to be in the message for all these years and you are not in rapturing condition and brandom spoke about the different ages the horse and buggy age and the horse and the car Age and and the airplane and the and the age of the astronaut and if you have to go and fly in space you cannot just walk into a spaceship and just take off you need to be prepared for what you have to deal with when you get over there so to be an astronaut there's some training that you go through because gravity is different the air is different you have to behave differently because what you could do here you cannot do over there but before you could go there you have to be in the condition to go there so God has Us in training right now we are being pressurized right now to get into rapturing condition Lord and the reality is many people apply to go to space yes but only those who go through the training and prove that they could behave a certain way and deal with the conditions over there are the ones they s over there friend what is your condition this morning because only perfect love will be over there there'll be no sickness over there there'll be no lying over there there'll be no sin over there there'll be no hate over there you cannot hold HS over there but to get there we must be in the condition here hallelujah and God will force the issue what is your condition this morning are you ready because the Bible says there'll be one there'll be two in the field one taken one left two in a bed one taken one left not two churches one taken one left it's individuals so I'm not talking to the person next to you right now I'm talking to you right now are you ready for the Rapture are you ready Malachi 4 brought a message to prepare us but for years we have fought about Doctrine and teaching and quote and are you ready that if God were to pull one this morning two in the field and he he takes one will you be the one two in a bed and he takes one will you be the one go back to the days of Moses he said take a lamb kill it put Blood on the door because the dead Angel is passing through the land and when I see the blood I'll pass over you not when I see what church you go to not when I see how many books you have read how many conventions you've been to not even how long you've prayed but when I see the blood that's the only thing that matters when I see the blood I'll pass over you and brother brandham said the token for this day is the life of Jesus Christ that's the token that's the blood when I see the blood I'll pass over you you may be seated that life that's the Thunder that shakes the devil Hallelujah that's what I want to see not another book another tape another no show me a life show me something H that I can believe when I see the blood I'll pass over you this message doesn't ask your position in the church it doesn't ask you what country you came from it doesn't ask you how long you've been in the message it doesn't ask you if you walked with the prophet it doesn't ask you how long you've been preaching it ask you have you applied Hallelujah the token not even for your church but have you applied it for your life Hallelujah friends there will be ministers who will not make it and people in their churches will make it because God is no respector of persons he only respects the Holy Ghost Hall he only respects the token he only respects the blood when I see the blood have passed over you friends this is real two in a bed one taken one left two in a field one taken one left are you ready Paul said examine yourselves Hallelujah my job is not to examine you your pastor is not to examine you but the Bible said examine yourselves but the brandom said it like this look into the mirror of the word hallelujah and stay there until you see [Music] Jesus Lord I want to see Jesus in my life you may be seated friend this is real it's a burden your job is a distraction your family could be a distraction the news in the world is a distraction this is the only thing that matters right now because the angel of the Lord is here but the brandom said he's here fixing things around for the coming of the Lord and he he said put a mark upon those that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city for the abomination in the pulpits and he said begin at My Sanctuary at the ancient men at men who shouldn't know better because they've been around for a long time but death is about to strike from the east from the west from the north from the south this message is a message to prepare us to have a life before we leave here hallelujah Pharaoh has held this world long enough but the time has come for the children of Israel to come out of Egypt and the Death Angel is about to pass through the land but the brandham Cried Out brandham Tabernacle don't you fail apply the token Hallelujah brother brandham said don't just say I believe the message that's not good enough it's not good enough to believe because the Bible says the devil believes and he trembles it's more than believing what are you doing about the message what what are you doing about this message that's dripping with blood through Paul henus Martin Columba Luther Wesley and God's Prophet it wasn't easy to bring the message to us what are we doing with the message the musicians could come there should be a burning in your soul tonight there should be a burning in your soul every day Lord I want to be a Christian in my heart I want to be a real Christian I want an experience with the pillar of fire that I will never be the same again I want to meet God for myself like Moses at a burning bush I want to meet God for myself like Peter on the day of Pentecost the token must be displayed not showing the book but it must come from the inside and the token cannot be impersonated it cannot be explained the way it just lives itself out Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity the Life of Christ that's what this world needs is to see Jesus the musician can begin to play something [Music] softly you could talk to him right [Music] now [Music] a little softer in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother bam said Look only in an individual never in a group an individual not in a group his his identification is with an individual he said I'll take one and leave one I'll separate them that's right it's not a group these are the words of the Prophet friends he said it's a personal Vindication of a pregnated child of God filled with the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he don't care about anything else and the Holy Spirit living its life pulsating through him showing the personal Vindication of the [Music] word with the brandom sing the token apply it Church don't fail and brother brandham is pleading he says it over and over he said don't don't don't let the sunset then he goes on don't don't don't don't rest day or night don't take no chance it won't work children it won't work you must have the token you say I believe yes I go I believe the message that's all right but that's not good [Music] you must have the token do you hear brandom Tabernacle and I say this morning do you hear convention you must have the token displayed without it all your believing is in vain you live a good life you listen to what the word says you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not it when I see the blood that's the token don't just come this far I'm still reading from the prophet say I believe the message you obey the messenger come enter Christ you say well I believe every word said brother brandham he said that's good but that's just being able to read take the message take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in Christ be in you when I see that I will pass over you friends you cannot blame anybody you can't even blame your pastor you can't blame your neighbor you can't say it was his fault that I didn't get it it's because of that that I didn't get it I had no time that's why I'm not there is no excuse there are no excuses this brother hurt me this sister offended me that has nothing to do with it Lord I need it youve got to get into rapturing condition young people I don't care who backslides I don't care who does what you get the token don't look at anybody else the Rapture is for IND individuals not a group not a church nobody has the Monopoly on the Rapture oh God oh God help us this morning friends you could bow your [Applause] hands you could have knowledge and Mr Rapture you could speak in tongues and miss the Rapture you could feed the poor and miss the Rapture you could give your body to be burnt and still miss the Rapture you must have charity you must have the token you must have seven thundering voices living in you and brother the Bram is praying and this is my prayer in the message God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him he said I pray God that tonight and I say I pray God that today if there be some here who doesn't know you who's never made their peace and maybe tonight while we're speaking a little voice a little voice has been speaking down in their heart I feel a warning that I can't be around much longer oh God oh God may they put their house in order right now may everything be set May the cold and the Brandon pra say maybe they're Christians but they've lived long under this seing so many things they've just lost the value of it the things they take it lightly oh God let us check up tonight Grant it knowing that these great things are only warning us of the soon rapturing church if we are Laden with sin with unbelief with slot with slothfulness we're not going to make the rapture we know it Lord so we pray that you'll burn into us the Holy Ghost down into our hearts oh God set our souls on fire help
