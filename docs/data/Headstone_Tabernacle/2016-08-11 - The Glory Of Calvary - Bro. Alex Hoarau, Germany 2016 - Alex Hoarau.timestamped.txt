[10:37] to the skirts of his garments as the de
[10:40] of

[58:56] when they come in a meeting they touched
[58:58] by the Holy Spirit they touched by the
[59:02] message and they want to serve the
[59:07] Lord and they are
[59:11] siner but until when they leave the
[59:19] church everything
[59:23] change
[59:26] they return the same
[59:29] person with the same
[59:33] character I'm sorry maybe after the

[1:07:43] spirit that I want to read some portion
[1:07:48] of the brother
[1:07:50] Bram preach about
[1:07:52] the the this day on the
[1:07:58] calvary he say the calvary is the more
[1:08:01] important
[1:08:03] things appear on the
[1:08:10] earth praise
[1:08:15] God you

[1:08:50] that but if the seal is open I believe
[1:08:53] that

[1:09:11] open in the hand
[1:09:15] time that people need to see you and
[1:09:19] me as a living
[1:09:21] God God in flesh
[1:09:25] God
[1:09:25] today not the god
[1:09:29] yesterday is not important to do many
[1:09:32] many
[1:09:34] things but if you stay on your cross on
[1:09:37] the
[1:09:38] calvary that brother but I'm say every

[1:09:51] Calvary look the prophet brother br
[1:09:55] he work with the angels he he he work
[1:09:58] with the pillar of the fire is the
[1:10:01] prophet messenger confirmed by
[1:10:06] God but one day when a storm come in the
[1:10:11] mountain and brother B Paul and and and
[1:10:14] sister made us stay in a car what he
[1:10:19] say he tried to confess God you know is

[1:32:54] trembling and my speech and my preaching
[1:32:57] was not with enticing words of man's
[1:33:02] Wisdom but in
[1:33:06] demonstration of the spirit of
[1:33:13] owers that brother say in the hand and

[1:58:41] simp simple and
[1:58:44] simple and people come to sh say this is
[1:58:48] not Holy Ghost
[1:58:51] brother
[1:58:54] no all you
[1:59:01] know praise
[1:59:06] God the Holy Ghost want to crucify you
[1:59:12] first because brother says power without
[1:59:17] character is satanic
[1:59:28] when I go in new Calia the first
[1:59:32] time nobody want to receive me but
[1:59:36] believes that when God send you
[1:59:40] somewhere not
[1:59:43] me but the voice of the seven Angel me
[1:59:46] to go
[1:59:48] there
[1:59:54] if this unit brother I I prefer get
[1:59:58] another job
[2:00:00] maybe because my Doctrine and my message
[2:00:03] is is very stupid is
[2:00:06] nonsense God sent a real messenger with
[2:00:09] a real
[2:00:12] message for prepare people for the
[2:00:17] raptures only one message can change
[2:00:20] your
[2:00:22] heart behold I send you
[2:00:26] Elijah this is not your prayor this is
[2:00:29] God says that I send
[2:00:34] you and when Elijah comeing he say my
[2:00:39] voice this
[2:00:42] tapes to go all the nation around the
[2:00:48] world
[2:00:51] show me one demon can to against this
[2:00:58] message show me one demon can stop this
[2:01:07] message brother and
[2:01:09] sister that God want to use
[2:01:14] you say God crucified
[2:01:18] me
[2:01:20] I want to call on a
[2:01:23] Calvary the problem is not the message
[2:01:26] the problem is my
[2:01:31] opinion that brother but I'm say the
[2:01:33] first sickness in the church is not the
[2:01:37] cancer he say the first sickness is the
[2:01:45] Fear cast out the devils
[2:01:49] the fearce
[2:01:53] spirit and all the doors
[2:02:02] open praise the
[2:02:04] Lord when I've been in new Calia no
[2:02:07] doors open and I go there first person I
[2:02:11] I I I knock the door for the pastor that
[2:02:14] is a Protestant
[2:02:17] pastor
[2:02:19] and God said me go to this man there's
[2:02:23] many plenty denominational
[2:02:29] church but when you you are
[2:02:34] crucified your argument is
[2:02:38] finished that brother but I'm say if you
[2:02:41] if you meet
[2:02:43] somebody get argument with the word you
[2:02:47] say when you get argument with the word
[2:02:48] the word you never born
[2:02:56] again not
[2:03:00] amen if you are born
[2:03:03] again each word say
[2:03:05] amen I don't understand but
[2:03:08] [Music]
[2:03:11] amen because this Prophet is is he
[2:03:16] preached the living message for you
[2:03:22] and he say even you cannot understand by
[2:03:24] believe
[2:03:26] it maybe you don't understand but
[2:03:28] believe

[2:51:45] [Music]
[2:51:47] being a real uh son or daughter of God
[2:51:51] being led by the
[2:51:53] spirit Jesus said it's like the wind you
[2:51:56] don't know where it comes from you don't
[2:51:57] know where it's going so is everyone
[2:52:00] that is led by the spirit of the Living
[2:52:04] God and in you can see in brother Alex's
[2:52:07] heart there's that
[2:52:10] burden for lost
[2:52:13] souls I told a brother this the other
[2:52:15] day I said brother if you if there's
[2:52:18] any
[2:52:20] Revelation that you get that takes away
[2:52:24] from the burden of lost souls then it's
[2:52:27] a wrong
[2:52:28] Revelation we've got to sigh and to
[2:52:31] cry we've got to try to find that last
[2:52:35] Fallen son or daughter of God and I'm
[2:52:38] speaking for myself I've got to have a
[2:52:41] greater burden you know we talk about
[2:52:44] how how wonderful it is in church and
[2:52:46] everything but we go out of here Sinners
[2:52:48] all over the place God help us to live
[2:52:52] in that atmosphere so that we can be
[2:52:55] directed by the Holy Spirit to be an
[2:52:59] example of this gospel that we believe
[2:53:04] isn't that the burden on your heart
[2:53:07] tonight I don't want a lot of head
[2:53:09] knowledge I want my heart to be led by
[2:53:13] the Holy Spirit of the Living
[2:53:15] God oh help me
[2:53:19] father I'm thankful for the message
[2:53:21] tonight you're

[2:53:39] request here from Nathaniel Lori shalom
[2:53:44] Bri of Christ I have a prayer request
[2:53:46] for my grandmother Marcel Joseph she had
[2:53:50] surgery and she suffers since that
[2:53:53] moment she has many problems because of
[2:53:56] her age but I believe that he is the
[2:53:59] great doctor and he will heal her God
[2:54:03] bless you amen so let's take this uh
[2:54:07] prayer request to the Lord and I'm
[2:54:11] taking my own heart to the Lord and ask
[2:54:14] him
[2:54:14] please father give me a greater burden
[2:54:18] amen you want a greater burden you want
[2:54:21] a burden like that Prophet had amen do
[2:54:24] you realize
[2:54:27] that uh I think one of the brothers said
[2:54:30] it uh earlier in the week that he had
[2:54:32] gotten a complex and he wanted to pull
[2:54:34] away and become a Trapper but then the
[2:54:38] Holy Spirit the angel of God came to him
[2:54:40] and told him to go back out to those
[2:54:44] ones that he would refer to as Rick
[2:54:48] Ricky and so forth and the people in the
[2:54:51] street and whatnot told them go back out
[2:54:54] after them my Prophet died on a Texas
[2:54:57] Highway going out after the Lost we
[2:55:01] don't want to just be cloistered in our
[2:55:03] little church with our little group and
[2:55:05] that's it no we've got to have a burden
[2:55:07] like brother Alex has amen so I'm asking
[2:55:11] God to give me a greater understanding a
[2:55:14] greater burden amen for the lost or for
[2:55:18] whatever the situation is right we want
[2:55:20] to be missionaries we can start right in
[2:55:22] our own
[2:55:24] house amen so let's take this prayer
[2:55:27] request to the Lord Almighty

[2:56:25] and with a true burden Lord and with the
[2:56:28] right uh ready word Lord From You Lord I
[2:56:33] read of Charles finny how that when he
[2:56:35] was filled with the Holy Ghost how when
[2:56:38] he would go through the countryside
[2:56:39] without even knowing it he would drop a
[2:56:42] word here or there to people people and
[2:56:44] then that few words that he would say to
[2:56:47] a person would grip them in such a
[2:56:51] conviction that they would go off
[2:56:53] somewhere and cry out to God until they
[2:56:56] were saved Lord give us words like that
[2:57:00] Lord give us a a baptism of fire like
[2:57:03] that Lord so that we can be led by the
[2:57:05] Holy Spirit Lord to find those last lost
[2:57:09] seeds so this bride body can be raised
