[1:04:42] sometimes either last year this year he
[1:04:47] discovered a problem with a foetus the
[1:04:49] fruit juice is just a baby dusty
[1:04:51] developing in the womb
[1:04:53] and he was able to bring out this baby
[1:04:56] of president this baby switcher buck
[1:05:00] this baby and put the baby back again in
[1:05:02] the mother's womb for his scotum a human
[1:05:11] you may not know what I'm talking about
[1:05:18] an inspired him and then I own doctor
[1:05:21] have confidence he himself that he would
[1:05:24] do this surgery and every two of you
[1:05:25] arise so his total is one of the one of
[1:05:30] the wanna make all a great news in
[1:05:33] medicine that the baby was put back
[1:05:37] again in the mother's womb as the
[1:05:39] healing was taking place in the mother
[1:05:41] the healing was taking place in the baby
[1:05:44] seven days the sutures were removed the
[1:05:47] stitches remain removed and the mother
[1:05:50] here the baby healed
[1:05:52] [Applause]
[1:05:58] and what took place was that the woman
[1:06:02] had gone ahead to deliver this baby
[1:06:05] that was a vindication that if serger
[1:06:09] was right but we have dr. Jesus you know
[1:06:20] it was so fascinating that you were
[1:06:22] clapping for this great thing this young
[1:06:24] man has done but what he did was he
[1:06:27] operated on what was a life now let's
[1:06:31] talk about the doctor that our press on
[1:06:34] what is dead
[1:06:35] and then brings it back to life only
[1:06:38] doctor Jesus can do that he's done it
[1:06:44] before he still doing it and he will
[1:06:48] still do it again oh let's give the Lord
[1:06:51] a clap of praise hallelujah
[1:07:00] delivery secret please go to Maine and
[1:07:05] we know their scriptures Jesus gave us I
[1:07:12] said greater greater things than these
[1:07:17] shall you do because I go to my father
[1:07:19] and the Malachi first said that we can
[1:07:22] not do something greater than what
[1:07:24] Christ has done rather more of it will
[1:07:27] be done that is the interpretation do
[1:07:31] you believe that so we are going to see
[1:07:33] more of what Jesus has done we cannot do
[1:07:37] more of what he never had done and we
[1:07:39] cannot do greater things of what he had
[1:07:42] never had done but all that he had done
[1:07:45] the same we should do more and more
[1:07:49] shall we do ray is gonna make he here
[1:07:53] the sick amen and we can see his T
[1:07:59] healing the sick and we are seeing more
[1:08:02] and more and more of them he raised the
[1:08:05] date Prince Karimi and we are going to
[1:08:09] see more and more and more ovation of
[1:08:10] the day praise God amen hallelujah amen
[1:08:16] so I want to read this to you but I'm
[1:08:20] going to compress it this is a testimony
[1:08:23] the brother came to me on the great
[1:08:25] excitement and he said I was not here
[1:08:28] last year his brother Stephen here s why
[1:08:34] this is a minister so see a deacon
[1:08:38] praise God I mean you were here last
[1:08:41] year it was no here last year
[1:08:45] but a Stevens pastor is brought a
[1:08:47] Filipino sinking
[1:08:50] when he gave me this testimony already
[1:08:52] true and I took my time out a bit to sit
[1:08:55] with his pastor you know to cross-check
[1:08:58] this and I want to tell you that what I
[1:09:02] have here and I want to tell you is
[1:09:05] confirmed as truth it was from the mouth
[1:09:09] of two or three let it quickly establish
[1:09:13] I also have evidences from their
[1:09:18] hospitals the x-rays and the report from
[1:09:23] the doctors also here
[1:09:26] praise God Amane so it can be verified
[1:09:32] we also have another testimony of the
[1:09:34] similitude which was mentioned along the
[1:09:38] way by our brother Paul on a July when
[1:09:41] he was preaching yesterday and he made a
[1:09:43] reference of the one that was testified
[1:09:47] from brother of Roger base church and I
[1:09:51] feel I would like before I read this to
[1:09:54] cover the for debate to really come and
[1:09:57] tell us this testimony you can hear from
[1:10:00] the
[1:10:05] from the horse's mouth praise God MA
[1:10:09] and I want to say sister comfort of
[1:10:13] Korea are you here Laurie oh please you
[1:10:24] will know more about this sister god
[1:10:28] bless you brother Isaac just in a
[1:10:30] nutshell tell us what God has done out
[1:10:34] in a week god bless you
[1:10:43] I want to give a testimony to the glory
[1:10:46] of God we have read in the Bible that
[1:10:53] God can heal God can raise the dead and
[1:10:59] we saw that up with the Ministry of
[1:11:01] Branham what is better history Jesus
[1:11:06] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:11:09] forever and so happens the comfort is
[1:11:13] here herself as I give this testimony
[1:11:16] again this was a second of August in
[1:11:20] 2017 that was last year on a Wednesday
[1:11:23] and recording happens so fast second
[1:11:29] foot she came to my house herself but I
[1:11:34] noticed that she was not under myself
[1:11:37] and the way the team was going in the
[1:11:40] way she was talking I could really make
[1:11:42] out what what was really happening
[1:11:45] it he said I didn't take it very serious
[1:11:47] but at a point I noticed that the system
[1:11:49] was just going like that going like that
[1:11:52] as she was talking test that is no more
[1:11:54] in this world so I was confused now I
[1:11:58] don't know what to what actually was
[1:12:00] happening and I spoke with how we prayed
[1:12:06] I try to send her out and the next thing
[1:12:10] she did was she came back
[1:12:13] she kept back a Westray to the judge and
[1:12:16] she entered the church the church
[1:12:19] premises she fell down flat inside the
[1:12:22] church the church compound I was
[1:12:25] screaming out of her voice was screaming
[1:12:28] so myself I had that fahadh ha I came
[1:12:31] out again and went to squash it was lame
[1:12:35] and I prayed for her I took her up God
[1:12:38] my wife we took her to my house and she
[1:12:43] ledge was there on a bed and what you
[1:12:46] were just going like that so I have to
[1:12:48] call her husband to come because she was
[1:12:51] really getting down so within few
[1:12:54] minutes she couldn't talk to us again
[1:12:59] we're talking were calling her and she
[1:13:01] wouldn't respond
[1:13:02] she was also going fed in a way
[1:13:04] threatening way fed and the husband came
[1:13:07] rush in caught her caught her she
[1:13:11] couldn't respond so I got some brothers
[1:13:16] and I took a husband who have to take
[1:13:19] her to the teaching hospital because the
[1:13:21] cases is beyond what we can handle at
[1:13:24] home we have prayed so I'm gonna have a
[1:13:27] prayer meeting that evening in church
[1:13:29] and it was actually about the time we
[1:13:33] should start the evening service so I
[1:13:35] felt I went to the church I felt how can
[1:13:38] we be in church and we're having a
[1:13:41] prayer meeting and then from the same
[1:13:43] compound somebody will take it to
[1:13:47] hospital doesn't mean that caught us no
[1:13:49] more and separate us and what cannot be
[1:13:52] honest it so after stop the brothers has
[1:13:55] said please wait while the parameter
[1:13:58] will finish the parameters before you
[1:13:59] return so we went into the church has
[1:14:03] booked the church at all and certainly
[1:14:05] judge briefly and then went to the press
[1:14:07] section at a point during the procession
[1:14:10] then I saw her saw him her song run in
[1:14:14] sunny church and jump on a beacon
[1:14:16] so Ashley Annie was it was just jumping
[1:14:20] on it ticking screaming so I knew that
[1:14:22] something must have happened
[1:14:24] my wife was at home and with with her
[1:14:27] and her husband I saw about children so
[1:14:30] I believe it caught a blister who was
[1:14:32] behind me
[1:14:33] I said moved to my house within then
[1:14:35] something must have happened a so but I
[1:14:38] had got to the house after said that he
[1:14:40] came behind him about time they go to
[1:14:42] the house this is not a stone and this
[1:14:45] happened right on my wife's arms so my
[1:14:49] wife has to drop her run out of the
[1:14:51] house and was screaming you know and
[1:14:55] when they came back he merely to tell me
[1:14:57] that the comforter has passed on I said
[1:15:01] that's why of course you know how a few
[1:15:07] the point I was confused what do I do
[1:15:11] so that's ok will be Caprica
[1:15:15] check her to hospital so the bloody car
[1:15:18] I've brought a body and put aside the
[1:15:21] vehicle and I said you take her to the
[1:15:26] teaching hospital go to the hospital why
[1:15:28] we go to church to pray then we went a
[1:15:30] web slide back inside the church I
[1:15:32] stopped the prayer meeting the Pope
[1:15:34] Leila stop the prayer meeting and I
[1:15:35] announced to the church that does an
[1:15:37] emergency Adams the comfort is seriously
[1:15:41] down and just put it like that
[1:15:43] so um friends I saw the acts for another
[1:15:49] ants work on faith
[1:15:50] what did George prayer it wasn't just
[1:15:54] like when we pray like when nobody
[1:15:58] talked and we call it players and taste
[1:16:00] like that but this was really the people
[1:16:02] cried out to God and by this time the
[1:16:06] body was been taken to the hospital and
[1:16:08] when it got a decision was between
[1:16:09] they'd come out and looked at her she
[1:16:11] was then just dead so they just abandon
[1:16:14] her there put her there and and we and
[1:16:17] no attention was given to her what he
[1:16:21] just was praying
[1:16:29] this hotel lasted for up to an hour and
[1:16:35] before I have to excuse myself from the
[1:16:39] charge I went and called them at the
[1:16:41] hospital and they said as a comfort just
[1:16:43] that their Britain
[1:16:46] [Applause]
[1:16:53] our God is dear God
[1:16:55] [Applause]
[1:17:01] they took out an emergency and we got to
[1:17:05] attend to her and so far the doctor
[1:17:07] called me about 2 a.m. that Wednesday
[1:17:09] night and was asking me if there if she
[1:17:12] fell from somewhere because I was around
[1:17:14] where the watching was happening tissue
[1:17:15] for I said because the brain the dome
[1:17:18] was swollen and there are certain
[1:17:20] conditions no does miracle Sam Sann
[1:17:22] hammered a medical doctor but while
[1:17:24] you're speaking in a medical term sense
[1:17:25] this night at but I said no she did not
[1:17:27] fall but the brain actually was swollen
[1:17:29] but they were surprised that upon all
[1:17:31] that happened there was no single brain
[1:17:33] damage God restore her and God hear her
[1:17:39] as the comfort is here and living
[1:17:43] testimony her and watching the shows
[1:17:48] that a God of Elijah is still alive I'm
[1:17:51] here the same yesterday today and
[1:17:52] forever
[1:18:02] god bless you let me see the Oz maybe
[1:18:06] this plan college somebody about two
[1:18:08] weeks ago us us written that's a to
[1:18:11] three weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon I
[1:18:14] receive a call from a pastor he boasted
[1:18:17] his name is but a Malachi and it was
[1:18:21] excited
[1:18:22] the surprising the God of Elijah is
[1:18:24] still alive our God sphere does those
[1:18:27] things he used to do in those old days
[1:18:29] you know he was so excited and it was
[1:18:31] telling me how a brother and officer in
[1:18:34] the church they were in the church
[1:18:35] service for this Sunday and this brother
[1:18:38] at the point they saw him sitting and
[1:18:40] just like his lump on it on a sheer so
[1:18:44] that at first he thought he was slipping
[1:18:47] but after some time he was still like
[1:18:50] that so they have to get close to him
[1:18:52] and getting close to him they noticed
[1:18:54] that his brother has passed on right
[1:18:55] inside the church so it truly hoped
[1:18:59] listening to in the world their brain
[1:19:02] said they all come to the altar and
[1:19:04] begin to cry out to the Lord
[1:19:06] brain and acts in the Lord for to
[1:19:08] restore the broadest life is that after
[1:19:11] a long time of brain nothing happened so
[1:19:15] they waited and waited and waited and
[1:19:17] Martin happened so then they now decided
[1:19:20] to take him to the hospital and let into
[1:19:23] the hospital the hospital attendants
[1:19:25] refused to attend to attend to him
[1:19:27] because it was as a complete dead body
[1:19:29] so then they advise them if you want to
[1:19:34] do anything but early go to a winner and
[1:19:36] then he said much there was no need so
[1:19:40] but I still believed they still have
[1:19:44] faith
[1:19:45] and thalia greatest surprise at a time
[1:19:48] that we're about to move the body to the
[1:19:50] to wear a let be to go to the mark this
[1:19:55] water
[1:19:55] open his eyes I mean doctors and in
[1:20:02] losses we are so amazed they didn't know
[1:20:05] what happened but that was a god of
[1:20:08] Elijah he is the same yesterday today
[1:20:11] and forever case not a code of history
[1:20:14] is the present tense god what he did
[1:20:17] yesterday he can do today hallelujah the
[1:20:21] brother is alive today as the confidence
[1:20:23] in he is yet this morning as a living
[1:20:26] testimony

[1:21:11] phrase briefs can't evade ma you maybe
[1:21:18] see that we're not doing yet we're not
[1:21:24] done yet
[1:21:25] so we have 1 2 we're coming to three
[1:21:33] let's give the Lord a clap of Dreams
[1:21:35] [Applause]
[1:21:45] you know these are very long Fe so if I
[1:21:48] keep reading it is gonna tell me some
[1:21:50] hours but I have read it and read it so
[1:21:54] I want to compress it phrase got a man I
[1:21:57] believe but our Steven will really
[1:22:02] accept my proposal to compress it
[1:22:07] praise God a man but a Steven and wife
[1:22:11] had been married and he talked about how
[1:22:14] it was very very difficult he was of an
[1:22:16] Anglican Church when the Lord God showed
[1:22:19] him the revelation of the message and He
[1:22:22] gave His life to Christ and then started
[1:22:26] worshipping God and like God will always
[1:22:30] sure the man his wife and stuff the
[1:22:33] enemy for them all throughout I know
[1:22:36] what he's talking about when you have
[1:22:38] another church you want to be a now a
[1:22:40] born-again Christian anyone you know you
[1:22:42] face a lot of tribulations and more from
[1:22:44] the father
[1:22:45] concerning the wife so he was able to
[1:22:50] scare true by the grace of God a
[1:22:51] difficulties trying to get a wife
[1:22:54] married and they moved on
[1:22:57] praise God MA but I'm much more
[1:23:00] consigned to tell you the story about
[1:23:03] how the wife died and God raised Ibaka
[1:23:09] gaint alive
[1:23:15] you know when the Bible say that enemy
[1:23:18] would come like a flawed but let me tell
[1:23:20] you God allows the enemy to come like
[1:23:23] your flaws he will get to one river he
[1:23:29] was some kind of rain down God will
[1:23:34] allow it
[1:23:35] the devil would take the key and open up
[1:23:38] and then the rain he never makes any
[1:23:40] rain but he's gonna move in the midst of
[1:23:43] the rain to cause a flood but don't
[1:23:47] worry there is that promise he will
[1:23:53] raise a standard against the enemy so
[1:23:58] the enemy came like a Florida against
[1:24:00] our brother's wife she was on her way to
[1:24:03] the bank
[1:24:04] and then was kind of like in the vehicle
[1:24:10] he was she got into but she didn't know
[1:24:12] that these are very bad people gangsters
[1:24:18] so it was like they were taking her away
[1:24:22] for one reason or the other so this
[1:24:26] sister was screaming from the vehicle
[1:24:28] and then when these people realize it
[1:24:30] was what we call a can a pepper in
[1:24:32] Nigeria so when the people realize that
[1:24:36] somebody was in distress call from that
[1:24:38] vehicle so and then the people inside a
[1:24:41] vehicle felt that room maybe we may be
[1:24:44] caught or something of that nature what
[1:24:46] they did was they pushed this sister in
[1:24:49] motion and she fell on a hard road and
[1:24:54] hit her head on the ground and broke
[1:24:56] this car
[1:24:59] she went into shock was bleeding and
[1:25:04] there was no brother no sister there but
[1:25:07] somehow the police came around the same
[1:25:09] and then they try to find out and they
[1:25:12] they did they discovered the document
[1:25:14] around her and then without they started
[1:25:15] to make a call so when the Medi score
[1:25:19] the broader was not close by
[1:25:24] and then when he got the news there was
[1:25:29] you know as the husband you will feel
[1:25:32] like you could just appear and disappear
[1:25:34] and they arrived where the wife worse
[1:25:39] [Applause]
[1:25:47] for those of you never had experience I
[1:25:49] have had this kind of experience whereby
[1:25:52] something happened to my wife and and I
[1:25:54] will feel like I could from wherever I
[1:25:57] am and just can you know translate
[1:26:03] praise government you know under the
[1:26:08] condition he was not yet to know then he
[1:26:12] was able to call her brother who was
[1:26:15] close by to run to the scene and I
[1:26:19] brought I got there and then give back
[1:26:21] the report it was a bad one so he had to
[1:26:26] call his pasta incidentally this was
[1:26:28] happening when we are having the
[1:26:29] convention here so he called his pastor
[1:26:34] and his pastor his pastor's wife by the
[1:26:40] grace of God as I said when he called
[1:26:42] his past or his pastor is just coming in
[1:26:44] now
[1:26:44] that's what a Philippines in care prays
[1:26:49] Clara main so a prayer request was
[1:26:54] offered here and the situation was
[1:26:59] prayed over it was the pastor's wife
[1:27:02] that rude now requests quickly there was
[1:27:06] respect the saints of God from here or
[1:27:11] offered prayers you know sometimes when
[1:27:14] people come down here and then prayer
[1:27:15] request is being said and things like
[1:27:17] that you don't know the power that
[1:27:19] follow your prayers
[1:27:22] you don't know how heaven the key is
[1:27:26] being on the door has been unlocked and
[1:27:30] gods sending down answers now while we
[1:27:36] are doing this here the devil has done
[1:27:39] his own so they were able to rush this
[1:27:43] sister to the hospital and she was what
[1:27:48] we call dead on arrival DOA so he could
[1:27:56] not be received to be managed and then
[1:28:00] within this scenario brother a key had
[1:28:03] heard about this also brother a K prayed
[1:28:06] also but a K is that room but contrary
[1:28:15] because she was still in that situation
[1:28:18] no breathing on a thing all of a sudden
[1:28:23] life came back again
[1:28:34] praise God a man and then went to do
[1:28:38] x-rays that give the courage to the
[1:28:40] doctors they had to do x-rays and
[1:28:43] authoress and they discovered damage and
[1:28:45] then the doctor was wondering he could
[1:28:49] not see because with the situation of
[1:28:51] what has happened there would not have
[1:28:54] been any suit of any any any chance for
[1:28:57] her to be back again to life and I want
[1:29:03] to tell you it was just like this
[1:29:06] scenario I also saw myself of a pastor
[1:29:10] friend of mine in Abuja but I really
[1:29:14] would a the devil came and shredded her
[1:29:19] sir let him down
[1:29:21] the doctors were there I was walking up
[1:29:23] and down with them we could not find no
[1:29:26] diagnosis but our brother was going he
[1:29:30] came at a time I see you rejected him at
[1:29:35] a point everybody said it was all over
[1:29:38] accordin apologies he said well that is
[1:29:40] not we can do but God who is so reaching
[1:29:44] missing
[1:29:51] got so reaching Missy he started the
[1:29:56] environment he proved that he was taken
[1:30:00] and at the braiding were praying one
[1:30:03] thing about it is that is not just on
[1:30:05] looking or shuttin up and down I've
[1:30:07] never seen people that really have faith
[1:30:10] they're bred in over there they said no
[1:30:12] it can never happen it will never happen
[1:30:16] because when we are sick our posture
[1:30:19] does not rest
[1:30:20] he will ensure that we something has
[1:30:23] been done and then how comes that we are
[1:30:26] going to literally really lose him
[1:30:29] and as they prayed on all of a sudden
[1:30:32] the kidneys that part op came back to
[1:30:35] life the hats that was completely going
[1:30:40] down collapsing and I mean the the Hat
[1:30:43] came back again alive the man that was
[1:30:45] not talking again the following morning
[1:30:47] he had to Tony he has to begin to say
[1:30:49] where is my wife where is brother John
[1:30:53] please remain and then life came back
[1:30:56] again I want to tell you what God is
[1:31:00] doing
[1:31:01] these are God he can do anything

[1:55:35] [Music]
[1:55:44] god bless you good morning if you ever
[1:55:48] Bibles and lecture the very attention to
[1:55:51] Genesis 1 and sin Luke chapter 4 Genesis
[1:56:06] 1 I'll read verse 26 through verse 28
[1:56:11] I'm sure the scripture we all know very
[1:56:14] well certainly many of us can really you
[1:56:17] know with our eyes closed but let's go
[1:56:22] and God said let us make man in our
[1:56:28] image after our likeness and let them
[1:56:32] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:56:34] and over the fowl of the air and over
[1:56:37] the cattle and over all the earth and
[1:56:40] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:56:42] upon the earth so God created man in his
[1:56:45] own image and the image of God created
[1:56:47] he him male and female created he them
[1:56:50] and God blessed them and God said unto
[1:56:54] them be fruitful and multiply and
[1:56:56] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[1:57:00] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:57:02] and over the fowl of the air and over
[1:57:04] every living thing that moveth upon the
[1:57:07] earth amen armsan look when it's you
[1:57:19] I'm gonna read a pretty lengthened
[1:57:23] portion from there you know the Bible
[1:57:27] said that I got some kinda scriptures
[1:57:29] which I'll show you in a minute but the
[1:57:32] Bible said that Jesus Christ as a son
[1:57:36] lent obedience by the things that he
[1:57:40] suffered so Harry is one of those
[1:57:46] scriptures as a matter of fact a major
[1:57:48] one where Jesus Christ is learning
[1:57:51] obedience now when you see that when you
[1:57:55] read that it doesn't mean he was
[1:57:57] disobedient and then he he had to suffer
[1:58:01] to lend to know like that if you do
[1:58:03] wrong you will you know that's not what
[1:58:05] it means
[1:58:05] that's not what it means it means that
[1:58:09] the things that is suffered the
[1:58:11] challenges the things that came across
[1:58:13] his path his suffering his pains the
[1:58:17] circumstances he learned that obeys the
[1:58:22] word under those circumstances really
[1:58:25] pays off every circumstance every
[1:58:28] challenge everything that happened let
[1:58:30] him understand was an experience was an
[1:58:33] opportunity for him to learn the way you
[1:58:36] obey the word those circumstances have
[1:58:39] got to obey the word also that's what it
[1:58:42] means
[1:58:43] amen so your challenges your
[1:58:45] circumstances is not a kill you but an
[1:58:48] opportunity to learn obedience to land
[1:58:52] that this world works this world every
[1:58:57] circumstance in my life will abate if I
[1:59:00] obey the word and let the word have his
[1:59:03] way the circumstances have no choice but
[1:59:06] to obey the word here's the master of
[1:59:09] every circumstance he speaks and every
[1:59:13] circumstance stands at attention the
[1:59:16] master is here
[1:59:18] watch how Jesus Christ as a son and is I
[1:59:21] example citizen how he learned obedience
[1:59:27] by every circumstance every pain every
[1:59:30] suffering every temptation every
[1:59:33] challenge so look for verse one array
[1:59:38] through 22 is the lengthen one but I'll
[1:59:40] try to run through it and Jesus been
[1:59:44] full of the Holy Ghost returned from
[1:59:47] Jordan and was led by the spirit into
[1:59:50] the wilderness being forty days tempted
[1:59:53] of the devil those are the things he's
[1:59:56] suffered your temptations your
[2:00:00] sufferings amen I mean those days he did
[2:00:05] even nothing and when the world ended he
[2:00:07] afterward hungered and the devil said
[2:00:10] unto Him when he appeared most
[2:00:12] vulnerable if thou be the Son of God
[2:00:15] command these stones that will be made
[2:00:19] bread and jesus answered him saying it
[2:00:22] is written learning obedience to the
[2:00:26] word obeyed the word himself and took
[2:00:29] the what to apply to the situation to
[2:00:31] the temptation to the suffering knowing
[2:00:34] that every temptation every sin every
[2:00:37] situation will obey the Word of God and
[2:00:40] you are learning that obedience is
[2:00:43] better than sacrifice amen and Jesus
[2:00:50] said it is written the man shall not
[2:00:53] live by bread alone but by every word of
[2:00:56] God the devil is not done yet the
[2:01:00] traditions are not done yet your
[2:01:02] challenges your sufferings are not your
[2:01:04] pains are not done yet and the devil
[2:01:07] take him up and high mountain should on
[2:01:10] to him all the kingdoms of the world in
[2:01:12] a moment of time you know like you know
[2:01:14] flash in your mind your thoughts your
[2:01:16] thinking path and your thinking process
[2:01:18] just shows you everything in a moment of
[2:01:21] time what you could be how you can you
[2:01:24] know just just
[2:01:25] take a chance and compromise on that
[2:01:27] what a little bit or do something that
[2:01:28] nobody sees it you know just do
[2:01:30] something it doesn't matter
[2:01:32] I got understands and in a moment of
[2:01:34] time just shows him and in his mind in
[2:01:37] his thoughts because you're it presents
[2:01:40] you as a third God does and the devil
[2:01:42] also presents you as a thought amen and
[2:01:46] showed him all the kingdoms of the world
[2:01:50] in a moment of time and the devil said
[2:01:53] unto him all this power will I give thee
[2:01:57] and the glory of them for that is
[2:02:01] delivered and to me and to whomsoever I
[2:02:03] will I give it you think that they ever
[2:02:06] don't know scripture I will give them to
[2:02:10] you not just that
[2:02:11] and the glory of them now you know man
[2:02:16] had fallen from the glory of God so the
[2:02:19] devil was sniffing that this man here is
[2:02:22] come to restore men back to the glory of
[2:02:24] God so you wanted him to attain that
[2:02:27] Laurie of God because he's scared stiff
[2:02:29] that that glory of God is not gonna be
[2:02:32] funny for him when man comes right back
[2:02:34] to that glorious Adam having the gun of
[2:02:37] Eden the devil knows is in big trouble
[2:02:39] then your finger devil is in trouble now
[2:02:42] wait until adopted sons begin to rise up
[2:02:45] and the devil knows because sleeve this
[2:02:48] man had a lot to do with it so exchange
[2:02:53] one glory for another glory my glory is
[2:02:55] waiting on the road don't know that I'll
[2:02:58] give you this glory right now the glory
[2:03:00] of the majesty to own all of these
[2:03:02] things here everybody in the world
[2:03:04] worships you great temptation in
[2:03:14] suffering do I do I not do I do I not
[2:03:20] but submit to the obedience to the world
[2:03:23] submission to the world under the
[2:03:26] control of the world
[2:03:29] father not my will but thine be done
[2:03:34] no I won't take what the devil's telling
[2:03:36] me I will take what your word says I'd
[2:03:41] be obedient to their word and he found
[2:03:48] strength and virtue was his submitted to
[2:03:50] the control of the world like that now
[2:03:53] what the gracious words that came out of
[2:03:55] his mouth and jesus answered and said
[2:03:59] unto me get thee behind me Satan for it
[2:04:02] is written thou shalt worship the Lord
[2:04:06] thy God and him only shalt thou serve
[2:04:10] finding strength in the word for every
[2:04:12] one of your situations a man being in
[2:04:15] obedience to that will let the world
[2:04:17] step out of the way they really give
[2:04:19] both the bum said he still learn how to
[2:04:20] get yourself out of the way and let the
[2:04:22] word have his way to let go and let God
[2:04:25] have his wonderful way your brothers
[2:04:29] will vanish your night will turn today
[2:04:31] when you learn the greatest gift of all
[2:04:33] to step out of the way and let the word
[2:04:36] harvest let the what fight your battles
[2:04:40] Amen what demon what spirit was that
[2:04:43] conscience what challenge what pain was
[2:04:45] suffering can stand against the word
[2:04:48] he's the mighty champion like ordinary
[2:04:51] just sang the undisputed a man on
[2:04:56] defeated champion of law amen
[2:05:01] verse 9 not done yet more suffering and
[2:05:08] he brought him to Jerusalem and set him
[2:05:12] on a pinnacle of the temple and said
[2:05:14] unto him if thou be the Son of God cast
[2:05:17] doubt cast thyself down from vens from
[2:05:22] there just cast yourself down for and
[2:05:31] for it is written verse 10 he shall give
[2:05:35] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[2:05:37] so is a war of courts now
[2:05:41] quotes the devil learns fast here Lent
[2:05:45] the thing that would you know you'll
[2:05:46] learn what you're opening doors people
[2:05:49] who do those things are get to in a
[2:05:50] minute people who do those things know
[2:05:52] like that you have to learn what the
[2:05:54] competition is doing and I can if it
[2:05:57] would gin Simon and is working don't be
[2:06:00] don't don't be proud copy it as bona
[2:06:02] fide you can make it better and that's
[2:06:05] what the devil did here real powerful
[2:06:07] tactic so this thing is working against
[2:06:09] him this man is bringing in the world
[2:06:11] the world the world so let me also bring
[2:06:13] you the world so he went into the world
[2:06:16] not that he respects the water he has no
[2:06:19] respect whatsoever for the world but
[2:06:21] just the water got to use to manipulate
[2:06:23] to cheat to deceive that's why he was
[2:06:27] about but he more than marriage match
[2:06:31] this was not any man this was a man that
[2:06:35] had been trained to let obedience by the
[2:06:39] things that he suffers to know that
[2:06:41] every temptation every trial every pain
[2:06:45] every every circumstance that seem so
[2:06:47] calm against you is an opportunity by
[2:06:50] God to learn obedience to live that the
[2:06:53] work does work that what God says he
[2:06:56] will do and when you land this time
[2:06:59] around next time it becomes easier to
[2:07:00] believe that's what it is here these
[2:07:04] what works
[2:07:05] this word works amen
[2:07:09] so that there will begin a core to wharf
[2:07:13] courts that's why we don't get into any
[2:07:15] of course in anybody but the panem said
[2:07:18] it would believe it that's 0zt if we are
[2:07:23] still searching keep on searching move
[2:07:25] on man go on segment we have found a man
[2:07:29] our resting place in the revealed Word
[2:07:32] of God sent from that from God through
[2:07:35] that Elijah Prophet Malachi for for it
[2:07:38] is written he shall give his angels
[2:07:40] charge over thee to keep thee very smart
[2:07:44] you know all those things you remove
[2:07:46] something from the
[2:07:48] always gravies no other ways then you
[2:07:51] check this way I'm trying to do jump
[2:07:54] from the pinnacle here father is this
[2:07:57] your way
[2:07:58] is this your will I want to be obedient
[2:08:01] to every word and go see my son not my
[2:08:05] way not my will but Jesus was the word
[2:08:13] himself and that's what you're getting
[2:08:15] too to keep thee he remove in other ways
[2:08:22] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[2:08:24] up lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[2:08:28] against a stone and Jesus answering said
[2:08:31] unto Him it is said thou shalt not tempt
[2:08:35] the LORD thy God and when the devil
[2:08:39] arraigned there is all the temptation he
[2:08:43] departed from him for a season but he
[2:08:46] learned some more things to know that
[2:08:47] this what works befits the devil anytime
[2:08:50] under any condition even when you are
[2:08:53] weak and vulnerable like Jesus was it
[2:08:56] would always defeat the devil amen verse
[2:09:00] 14 and Jesus returning the power of the
[2:09:03] Spirit into Galilee and then why not a
[2:09:07] frame of him through all the region
[2:09:09] round about and he taught in their
[2:09:12] synagogues being glorified of all and he
[2:09:16] came to Nazareth where he had been
[2:09:17] brought up and as his custom was he went
[2:09:20] to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and
[2:09:22] stood up for to read and there was
[2:09:24] delivered unto him the book of the
[2:09:26] Prophet Isaiah's and when he had opened
[2:09:27] the book he found the place where it was
[2:09:30] written the Spirit of the Lord is upon
[2:09:32] me because he anointed me to preach they
[2:09:35] are to preach the gospel to the poor he
[2:09:38] has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[2:09:40] preach deliverance to the captives and
[2:09:42] recovery of sight to the blind to set at
[2:09:44] liberty them that are bruised to preach
[2:09:49] the acceptable year of the Lord
[2:09:50] and he left out on the day of vengeance
[2:09:53] of our God which in all those news Bible
[2:09:55] readers message students the bomb tour
[2:09:57] because there was no this is rightly
[2:09:59] dividing the world
[2:10:00] I'm making the word present tense
[2:10:02] because the day event declaring that the
[2:10:04] Avengers was left to these in time
[2:10:07] bright and he closed the book and he
[2:10:10] gave it again to the minister and sat
[2:10:12] down and the eyes of all them the one
[2:10:14] that synagogue were thrusting on him and
[2:10:17] that's why I believe when you come a
[2:10:18] church leave all this side talk thrust
[2:10:21] in your eyes and him not the mist on the
[2:10:22] pulpit but the word that's been spoken
[2:10:25] because Jesus Christ is the mystery of
[2:10:28] God every word every mystery revealed
[2:10:32] amen and he began to say unto them this
[2:10:36] day is this scripture fulfilled in your

[2:15:55] just trying to talk to you and on this a
[2:15:59] bit of a clock of control this morning
[2:16:01] now control that say what that are fun
[2:16:07] very intriguing for a long time
[2:16:10] especially as it comes and applies to
[2:16:12] you know Christianity this was in the
[2:16:16] message because we are all here we're
[2:16:18] all about control now you may not
[2:16:20] understand I believe that but our
[2:16:21] legislature a few minutes
[2:16:22] we hear all about control that's why you
[2:16:25] were here that's one here that's why we
[2:16:27] get a church that's why we do the things
[2:16:30] that we do if we really mean to be in
[2:16:32] the rapture because you know what and
[2:16:34] and not just those were the message most
[2:16:37] any human being you see us in our lives
[2:16:40] struggling for control it's even the
[2:16:43] business war you seen the spots war you
[2:16:45] see all over every facet of human
[2:16:48] existence you see men less women in him
[2:16:51] that once control a man can you say Amen
[2:16:55] now I'm just talking to you okay just
[2:16:58] talking all right
[2:17:00] the preachers have gone ahead so I'm
[2:17:01] just talking and I think you're right I
[2:17:04] think you're a good class you have
[2:17:05] listened so but don't let it become so
[2:17:07] academically like scratch your head when
[2:17:13] it becomes like that then I know it's
[2:17:14] time to just sit down but control you
[2:17:20] love control I love control me I don't
[2:17:24] love control I lie you know where this
[2:17:31] is coming from God said let us make man
[2:17:34] in our image after our likeness and let
[2:17:37] them have dominion control control it's
[2:17:43] in Bill is inflating man this control
[2:17:46] you want to have dominion you want to
[2:17:48] protect your space are you can somebody
[2:17:51] relate can you relate that's that's
[2:17:55] words you can wriggle out of that even
[2:17:57] when you feel you're the nicest person
[2:17:58] you let everybody have their way give
[2:18:00] her their space not true if a man made
[2:18:04] in God's image Christian unbeliever
[2:18:07] control now when God made man he made
[2:18:16] him in his own image but like I said
[2:18:19] many times many times we want to make
[2:18:21] God in our image we want God who been an
[2:18:23] image who would be like horse is only in
[2:18:25] our church our group that's God that's
[2:18:28] it got in your own image but God make
[2:18:32] him a nice image you try to cope with
[2:18:34] him and
[2:18:35] cope with his world he doesn't have to
[2:18:37] look like your group every believer
[2:18:38] doesn't have to look like your group or
[2:18:40] your church but when it must be like our
[2:18:43] group our church our pastor our deacons
[2:18:46] you got a God in your own image that's
[2:18:49] not how God did it what made man in his
[2:18:52] own image after his likeness what he
[2:18:55] likes you may be seated just talking to
[2:18:58] you a man so this man II met it put him
[2:19:06] in the beautiful garden of eden and give
[2:19:08] him three things but the Benham said
[2:19:10] would you not know these things the
[2:19:12] prophet a great prophet i stripped from
[2:19:15] the man of God William Branham II taught
[2:19:17] us these things now we've been on the
[2:19:19] Commission we warned many times I mean
[2:19:22] even this is this convention here don't
[2:19:24] you ever for one minute think that this
[2:19:27] message is failing or that's a law there
[2:19:30] is nothing like that but if you ever let
[2:19:33] the devil get you to feel nothing is
[2:19:35] going on nothing is moving you are
[2:19:37] defeated you might as well go going home
[2:19:39] somewhere this measure is stronger now
[2:19:41] than it's ever been because God is
[2:19:44] getting ready maybe see that God a man
[2:19:51] you are stronger today than you were
[2:19:54] yesterday I'm not talking about what you
[2:19:56] feel I'm telling you it no soul the
[2:19:59] devil is more scared of you today than
[2:20:01] it was yesterday
[2:20:03] [Applause]
[2:20:05] amen
[2:20:12] so you'll be seated so God made man in
[2:20:19] his own image after his likeness but we
[2:20:22] wanted God in our image after our
[2:20:24] likeness what we like and then we'll
[2:20:27] find the court on the scripture to make
[2:20:30] God Satan to me by the pen I'm sage
[2:20:34] that's a God in your own image so when
[2:20:40] God made these men for the Branham
[2:20:42] tourist in breda from the scriptures and
[2:20:45] let us see it that God give this man
[2:20:49] three things because when he fair is
[2:20:51] that Adam lost three things number one
[2:20:54] he lost his fellowship with God number
[2:20:57] two he lost his return alive and number
[2:20:58] three in his eternal life he lost an
[2:21:01] inheritance a man in his eternal life
[2:21:04] let me expensable to you here
[2:21:06] fellowship with God is his right as a
[2:21:08] son of God it's not like is this a right
[2:21:11] understand of God you don't have to do
[2:21:13] anything extra to earn eternal life
[2:21:16] addition of God neither do anything
[2:21:17] extra to learn fellowship with your
[2:21:19] father even in the natural and natural
[2:21:21] your son what is a good boy or a bad boy
[2:21:25] he's your son
[2:21:26] he has access to you all the time amen
[2:21:30] it has your life flowing through him
[2:21:32] well I disown that boy too late your
[2:21:37] life is flowing through him same way
[2:21:40] with God can somebody say Amen
[2:21:43] the devil is no match or glory because
[2:21:48] greater more powerful is he that is the
[2:21:51] youth and the devil in the world
[2:21:52] lying to you try to stop you but he
[2:21:54] cannot do it you can add orange the
[2:21:57] other pure virtuous sinless brother
[2:21:59] Jesus Christ amen
[2:22:03] man amen you may be seated
[2:22:06] [Applause]
[2:22:11] trying to keep it up on my time here
[2:22:13] because some of us are Chipotle key I I
[2:22:16] need some training because break a judge
[2:22:20] in less than one hour put me on that
[2:22:23] pulpit what it doesn't one hour I'm

[2:22:37] department
[2:22:39] how much was pitching you know the time
[2:22:41] by this sweat even though our all church
[2:22:43] you know you know heat so and one bunch
[2:22:48] of boy spinning when is sweat over here
[2:22:49] no he's gone two hours when it's gone to
[2:22:53] the Lexx here you know he's like four
[2:22:55] hours and I said I'm only just getting
[2:22:57] started so so we get a print blah I get
[2:23:04] to Lego sometime to the tree knows how
[2:23:06] to get your point through in one hour
[2:23:08] I'm sure they put Legos would love that
[2:23:10] very much oh yeah no don't tell me you
[2:23:15] won't love that I see you how you look
[2:23:18] at your watch and you're making like you
[2:23:21] are yawning up I see all that come on
[2:23:24] Legos you a nap it's good for too long I
[2:23:27] know that brother okay you got to come
[2:23:30] with me but the chief will draw the
[2:23:32] talks and forgivable emojis when it
[2:23:34] comes here is from Legos we have got to
[2:23:38] put in a ward there or something you
[2:23:40] know what everybody was in families you
[2:23:42] do in 50 minutes but don't be scared I
[2:23:46] won't keep you for hours and that's what
[2:23:49] the cheapo stuff you know so I was
[2:23:52] behind him in that department and but I
[2:23:54] talks would do it in both talks but I'll
[2:23:57] do it in one hour half hours well they
[2:23:59] serve the chip when I was taking all the
[2:24:01] time so they upgraded
[2:24:03] they upgraded to meters up you know so
[2:24:07] wouldn't lead them to long so but talk
[2:24:11] to the spiritual so anyway got made
[2:24:23] Manny's image again these three things
[2:24:26] and when man fell he lost these three
[2:24:30] things so we know from there
[2:24:31] he had these three things before he fell
[2:24:34] fellowship eternal life and inheritance
[2:24:39] in his talent now then here John we said
[2:24:41] but what it was was the authority the
[2:24:43] power the control over the earth that
[2:24:46] was the inheritance your son is your son
[2:24:49] but you know when you are writing your
[2:24:51] wheel to give your children the
[2:24:53] inheritance it depends on certain things
[2:24:54] and brother Branham taught us in God's
[2:24:56] economy that song has got to be the
[2:24:59] right kind of a song because this
[2:25:00] inheritance is powerful these returns
[2:25:03] pressing on the same level as God
[2:25:04] himself so you have got to be the right
[2:25:07] kind of a song firstly before he will
[2:25:10] give you this inheritance in life now
[2:25:12] Adam didn't know how to prove to be the
[2:25:14] right kind of a son because God made
[2:25:16] Adam not a child but a man in his own
[2:25:19] image made him a mature
[2:25:22] perfect man in cause image as though he
[2:25:27] had gone through the process to be the
[2:25:29] right kind of a son
[2:25:30] and given this inheritance in life but
[2:25:33] when Adam sinned unfair they lost all
[2:25:36] three and God immediately because Adam
[2:25:40] is a son is a son you can do anything
[2:25:43] about that
[2:25:43] what was in divorce his children he will
[2:25:46] never divorce you no matter how beaten
[2:25:49] up how black and blue you Vietnam he
[2:25:51] will never divorce you if we can just
[2:25:54] find your way back to the cross you will
[2:25:57] find your way back home but devil can
[2:26:00] keep you and put away by your father you
[2:26:03] always was a son you always your be a
[2:26:06] son hallelujah
[2:26:08] Laurie you may be seated
[2:26:12] [Music]
[2:26:17] but the the thoughts in the the
[2:26:20] inheritance in life got in Norwich topic
[2:26:23] immediately you restore the frost to
[2:26:25] those ways who writes as a soon it not
[2:26:28] to be the red candle so not to be any
[2:26:30] type of Sun it's in a life flash with
[2:26:33] his father but the inheritance is the
[2:26:40] only given to the right care of children
[2:26:42] with God felt atom yeah built atom up to
[2:26:45] that smoker when Adam fell said no this
[2:26:48] is no longer the right kind of song I
[2:26:51] cannot him that will that inheritance to
[2:26:54] have my domain to himself alone I cannot
[2:26:56] give him that but I restore back his
[2:26:59] inheritance I mean I restore back his
[2:27:01] fellowship is eternal life you'll never
[2:27:03] be lost
[2:27:04] you'll always be my son and so from that
[2:27:07] time the church has been how to come
[2:27:11] back to that inheritance that's supreme
[2:27:13] control on the face of the earth that's
[2:27:15] why you wanna have this craving for
[2:27:18] control of the instead of us we want to
[2:27:20] come back to rulership we want to come
[2:27:22] back to sonship you want to come back to
[2:27:23] sonship authority to speak and our words
[2:27:27] are backed just like that amen glory so
[2:27:44] follow my story so that's where the
[2:27:50] craving to come from God Sandman out I'm
[2:27:54] gonna say I'm not going to restore this
[2:27:56] control the inheritance back to you
[2:27:59] until I see you and see you under the
[2:28:03] control otherwise you'll prove to be the
[2:28:06] right kind of a song amen and when I see
[2:28:10] that I will call you aside give you
[2:28:14] three more words here is my son much
[2:28:17] spirit flowing freely and that's always
[2:28:19] tell there
[2:28:20] like for the OVC last night a main
[2:28:23] course or regional plan for you mantis
[2:28:25] 10 like the original mind the gun of
[2:28:29] Eden possessing on Timmins 20 spoken
[2:28:34] what authority power to control the
[2:28:37] earth total all the elements amen hey
[2:28:40] man against the Amen so when Adam fell
[2:28:53] borough's back to this spot here and
[2:28:55] that's why I said you mean all of us
[2:28:57] something on instead of us look longing
[2:28:59] for control you see it everywhere you
[2:29:01] see in your home life you see it at
[2:29:03] school you see between husband and wife
[2:29:05] you see within the children you see in
[2:29:10] the business world the husband wants to
[2:29:12] control his wife do I want to control
[2:29:15] the children
[2:29:15] Bejoy to control their parents what must
[2:29:19] happen to a husband this job want to
[2:29:21] control that church this must want to
[2:29:23] control the whole church control it
[2:29:26] smell of us it's part of who we are amen
[2:29:30] but we we have got control figured out
[2:29:33] wrong big-time big-time because God is a
[2:29:38] God of control God has little if it's
[2:29:43] just hanging everywhere he's a God of
[2:29:45] control but the devil has put a battle
[2:29:47] rap on that what control it means like
[2:29:50] you any prison means they control
[2:29:52] everything you do it means you can't do
[2:29:53] anything you are just held there and you
[2:29:55] just have to like stay in a straitjacket
[2:29:56] no that's what we think
[2:29:58] but that's opportunity
[2:30:04] how did Adam get here to have these
[2:30:07] three things it's an alive fellowship
[2:30:10] and inheritance how did you get there

[2:31:14] forth and you know right what is the
[2:31:16] rookie he doesn't know is out of his
[2:31:18] game he had of his all of his league in
[2:31:21] this place here so they had to rearrange
[2:31:24] the hall to accommodate my pitching
[2:31:28] staff you will think I will lend so when
[2:31:34] I went there I was very conscious now
[2:31:36] like that you've got to be measured and

[2:31:46] finish as the brother the Chancellor
[2:31:49] hired I do was it okay inside

[2:32:03] I said I'm so sorry brother you know so
[2:32:06] but let's hear I understand I understand
[2:32:10] but you know how did Adam get to help
[2:32:14] this year it's God's great 3/4 mystery
[2:32:16] which was God having the preeminence
[2:32:20] ease the control over Christ by the word
[2:32:23] and Christ off-price having control by
[2:32:29] his word over the brown collie
[2:32:32] preeminence ease but it's control
[2:32:35] controlling the bread lab rat learns to
[2:32:39] obey the word all the time and here is a
[2:32:42] secret when you learn to be something to
[2:32:44] the world every second missile around
[2:32:46] you will lend the same thing to the
[2:32:49] circumstance around you cannot stand
[2:32:51] against the watch the what will create a
[2:32:54] hole in the wall is there must be hole
[2:32:56] in that wall Oh hallelujah now the three
[2:33:13] for me she's not just catch phrase
[2:33:14] because I hear these days L name logos
[2:33:17] bright that's fine but don't take the
[2:33:19] water out of context
[2:33:26] Malakai him and reveal what the
[2:33:29] three for me she's nobody needs to shed
[2:33:30] more light on it
[2:33:32] nobody's to explain anyway
[2:33:35] hello him logos Brad what it means it's
[2:33:39] the Elohim God having premises and
[2:33:42] control over Christ the bride the word
[2:33:45] and Christ having premonitions over you
[2:33:48] the bride and number three is not the
[2:33:51] bride is Christ and the bride going back
[2:33:54] to Eden which is crashing you the hope
[2:33:57] of glory amen amen
[2:34:04] so here's a secret here so they can
[2:34:07] Avedon in the game of Eden here was Adam
[2:34:11] walk out of the theophany in the
[2:34:14] beginning made his spirit man on the
[2:34:17] face of the earth and how was Adam
[2:34:19] spirit man Adam and later judges to
[2:34:23] seven this female was put in the body of
[2:34:25] flesh and man became a living soul
[2:34:27] and this man Adam went open down the gun
[2:34:31] Avedon in the image of God with absolute
[2:34:34] control over the earth God was the god
[2:34:38] of the universe but his son Adam was the
[2:34:41] god of the earth in absolute control
[2:34:44] over the earth but how that worked how
[2:34:47] that works which you know but you're so
[2:34:49] repeated - you have that what was that
[2:34:50] God had control over Adam and so Adam
[2:34:56] could control the earth one had to come
[2:34:59] first
[2:34:59] God her to have preeminence is over Adam
[2:35:03] frosty
[2:35:08] and control over the earth automatically
[2:35:12] followed that's what we don't follow a
[2:35:14] sign don't look for signs signs follow
[2:35:18] the believer the believer has come to
[2:35:21] preeminence ease has come to control by
[2:35:24] the word amen amen amen amen
[2:35:36] so Adam there he was in total complete
[2:35:45] subjection to God on his world the world
[2:35:48] in his soul Sharon split of Elohim in
[2:35:55] his soul Genesis 1:26 228 with a command
[2:36:00] commissioned to subdue to rule to
[2:36:03] control the earth and so Adam was under
[2:36:07] the control of God and because of that
[2:36:09] you could control the but the very
[2:36:13] moment the very moment that Adam went
[2:36:17] away from the control of God the very
[2:36:20] minute like brother Delia things are
[2:36:23] said like that not going to happen when
[2:36:25] Eve you know these will be nothing
[2:36:28] happening and you watch for the vanity
[2:36:29] always about when Adam fell when Adam
[2:36:31] fell when Adam failed once Adam soul at
[2:36:39] his birthright and God lost control over
[2:36:43] Adam immediately Adam lost control of
[2:36:48] the earth in me it was instant the day
[2:36:51] you either of that danger will die and
[2:36:54] instantly I'd I knew something change
[2:36:57] something change on the spur Adam knew
[2:37:00] that you know we all love control I mean
[2:37:07] you get adopted and you won't love it
[2:37:08] you'll be happy that's all the life Adam
[2:37:11] ever knew have you ever thought about
[2:37:12] Adam before you came on the scene the
[2:37:15] only man on the face of this earth no
[2:37:18] fellowship no way to grow
[2:37:21] no matter who is father and mother and
[2:37:22] you know laying things
[2:37:24] no no nothing he was just alone and then
[2:37:29] go made it for him and they had
[2:37:31] fellowship with God and it was in
[2:37:33] absolute control over the earth touch
[2:37:34] all over the earth but once he did this
[2:37:37] sin and listen to the devil in the form
[2:37:42] of this happen through his wife go lost
[2:37:46] control over Adam and rather the same
[2:37:48] time instantly and I'm lost control over
[2:37:50] the earth you cannot eat a cake and have
[2:37:56] it Eve copy God
[2:37:58] seven so like we all do wrong so he he
[2:38:07] tried it again he snitched on me one
[2:38:08] organs but you will know you know you
[2:38:10] will know when something goes you know
[2:38:14] so he tried to like this removed this
[2:38:17] way I moved away nothing happened
[2:38:20] little excess that control like before I
[2:38:23] want to walk on the water and if I were
[2:38:25] himself sinking he run back you know
[2:38:29] that control was gone away from him I
[2:38:33] noticed that he was naked which wasn't
[2:38:36] an issue before he looked at his wife
[2:38:38] she's naked
[2:38:38] you know these not proper so he went
[2:38:40] right away to try and get that control
[2:38:42] back let's do something let's do
[2:38:44] something no that's how yeah we never
[2:38:46] admit until we are pinned to the world
[2:38:48] and we are pinned to the wall and we
[2:38:50] have to first to admit that the still of
[2:38:52] falling man don't do that and so he went
[2:39:02] and the fig leaves uncovered himself on
[2:39:05] its own so you say here also instead of
[2:39:07] beginning a free means something went
[2:39:09] wrong he you know like like something
[2:39:11] you stretch and find out the power is
[2:39:13] gone just gonna kick off the cheetah
[2:39:17] should I call me actually just money
[2:39:18] which I just look who is talking just
[2:39:20] when his way say lion come here the
[2:39:22] general straddle the of a tiger just
[2:39:25] coming like that graceful like that and
[2:39:27] I'm sorry getting afraid he said no
[2:39:28] something's gone wrong here I've gotta
[2:39:30] hide these animals will cheer me up
[2:39:32] I gotta hide from all these animals
[2:39:35] because they would be out they had the
[2:39:37] land roar he got afraid he said I was
[2:39:40] afraid so I hid myself fear came in he
[2:39:43] was afraid with loss of control his war
[2:39:47] just turned upside down that's why you
[2:39:50] and I want control control put stays in
[2:39:52] place control gets you in order control
[2:39:55] set things the way you think you want
[2:39:56] them to go like atom when we feel out of
[2:40:13] control we just don't feel right because
[2:40:19] God made us to control to be the
[2:40:21] controller on the earth so when we feel
[2:40:25] out of control
[2:40:26] that's another subject while we feel out
[2:40:29] of control
[2:40:29] I just want to you know stay here on you
[2:40:31] know Genesis and Adam you know I'm
[2:40:34] selling out to the devil through his
[2:40:36] wife's reasoning you got I wasn't
[2:40:37] deceived when you feel out of control
[2:40:41] when you feel not in control things just
[2:40:45] don't feel right unlike Adam we get
[2:40:53] control wrong Adam to fix this frame of
[2:40:59] loss of control look at what he did look
[2:41:03] at what he did
[2:41:03] it made figleaves wrong action God came
[2:41:08] down I don't know where out there he
[2:41:12] said I had the vault work in the garden
[2:41:14] and I was afraid of all these animals
[2:41:18] running around here and Aniyah done
[2:41:20] something wrong and I hit myself wrong
[2:41:23] action but Adam who tore your photo you
[2:41:26] were naked have you eaten the fruit that
[2:41:29] I did simple answer yes
[2:41:35] simple answer yes Adam said yes but an
[2:41:43] explanation not a laughing matter matter
[2:41:57] and said you know it's because of the
[2:42:00] woman that you yourself gave me I was in
[2:42:02] fine you know I see dementia I didn't
[2:42:04] found without her but you gave her to me
[2:42:07] you gave it to me
[2:42:09] wrong action simple answer yes
[2:42:13] everybody was win you was he did wrong
[2:42:17] he was caught red-handed
[2:42:18] but the blame is not mine alone out of
[2:42:24] control
[2:42:24] playing the blame game it's my wife
[2:42:28] it's my husband he's my brother is my
[2:42:31] sister he's the pastor is Julian oh come
[2:42:37] on now come on now
[2:42:40] [Applause]
[2:42:45] Bhavana me nigeria okay I mean idea this
[2:42:49] is on top for me so I know that's what I
[2:42:57] want but always coming around wasn't
[2:42:58] that trouble is coming because he can
[2:43:01] see things that just you know cause
[2:43:02] whatever but you know I don't mean to be
[2:43:05] controversial I apologize about that up
[2:43:06] front but I don't like living in denial
[2:43:08] I don't like delicious deceive myself I
[2:43:10] like to call it spirit spade and if I'm
[2:43:13] wrong and wrong I can get over your head
[2:43:15] and because your pastor is talking you
[2:43:17] can keep quiet but God is not gonna keep
[2:43:18] quiet garden respect no possible
[2:43:21] response children and but mom's never
[2:43:23] gonna be dead listens here anyway so
[2:43:25] Adam put a blame game you know when it
[2:43:28] was like everybody's wrong because of
[2:43:30] what you have done you can never all up
[2:43:32] to what you did the only way you owned
[2:43:33] up everybody must take a blame for it
[2:43:35] because he felt out of control the blame
[2:43:39] game the victim mentality everybody's
[2:43:42] against me if not for my wife if not for
[2:43:44] my husband
[2:43:45] not for the judge even though for the
[2:43:46] country if not for the president just
[2:43:49] blame everybody for your circumstance
[2:43:55] because he fails was totally out of
[2:43:57] control and we got control wrong totally
[2:43:59] figured out wrong lost control we want
[2:44:03] to get it back and gone wants us to get
[2:44:05] it back so how do we get control back
[2:44:08] O'Reilly what's the right way to get
[2:44:10] back this control how do we get control
[2:44:12] right we go back to God
[2:44:20] go back to God he's the God of all
[2:44:23] control he said in the Bible let
[2:44:26] everything be done decently and in order
[2:44:30] God do it all by himself
[2:44:33] thoughts on his mind and became the
[2:44:36] logos poured all he wasn't to the logos
[2:44:43] where that Angels the word created
[2:44:48] angels angels worshiped him and when in
[2:44:55] just watched them then there was a
[2:44:56] revolt in Heaven's something went wrong
[2:44:59] there's no panic in heaven the word is
[2:45:02] in control is a God of control things go
[2:45:05] wrong it was all well thought out it's
[2:45:08] all in God's program things can never go
[2:45:11] wrong nothing can go wrong but what God
[2:45:14] would allow it and the world control
[2:45:22] that they will control it war in heaven
[2:45:28] through Lucifer out and he's won for
[2:45:31] angels and human our wine heaven became
[2:45:35] human battles and got him on the earth
[2:45:38] and created the heavens and the earth
[2:45:40] the god of order and control I wish I
[2:45:44] had the picture to show you the the grid
[2:45:47] you in France that he created but let me
[2:45:52] give a simple statistic
[2:45:55] the skies the heavens bubbles it
[2:45:58] declared some writing declare the glory
[2:45:59] of God and the firmament shows his
[2:46:01] handiwork and in the stats that you see
[2:46:04] at night there are billions and billions
[2:46:07] and billions of them many of them are
[2:46:10] bigger than our earth and those tears
[2:46:16] are wrong planets and it grew a planets
[2:46:20] form a galaxy and it galaxy has its own
[2:46:24] and the planets rotate around that zone
[2:46:28] now our own galaxy our own galaxy and
[2:46:32] most of these galaxies are spinning
[2:46:34] around me no we don't feel it because of
[2:46:37] God's great wisdom but this earth this
[2:46:42] earth is an and the galaxy Dewayne is
[2:46:45] spinning around at the breakneck speed
[2:46:48] of four hundred and ninety thousand
[2:46:52] miles an hour this our galaxy this this
[2:46:59] galaxy that were in is spinning round
[2:47:01] spinning round spinning round for an
[2:47:02] eight thousand miles an hour we don't
[2:47:04] feel it and even at that great breakneck
[2:47:09] speed to for our gadget to make one
[2:47:13] single rotation you don't know how many
[2:47:18] years on it it wouldn't at least two
[2:47:21] hundred million years for our galaxy to
[2:47:27] make one single dish around the Sun and
[2:47:36] God keeps all that they're absolutely
[2:47:39] controlled in order of the McGowen one
[2:47:43] like that
[2:47:44] [Applause]
[2:47:45] and he hung those things in space by his
[2:47:49] word here's what keeps him on the check
[2:47:53] his word is the controller that controls
[2:47:56] all of business and keeps them in their
[2:47:59] space Laurie glory to God and you know
[2:48:05] what you know what there but over a
[2:48:08] billion all the galaxies not planets
[2:48:13] over a billion or the galaxies out there
[2:48:17] like our galaxy uncle credit these
[2:48:24] heavens and the earth and the hanging
[2:48:26] space there at this speed Ranelagh I
[2:48:29] don't collide he's a God of order I had
[2:48:32] that was not right under control and it
[2:48:35] control them by his word are you
[2:48:37] following me control them by his word
[2:48:41] and this great God come right down to
[2:48:45] you and I and could add them in the
[2:48:47] Garden of Eden this great God what is
[2:48:51] man that thou art mindful of him or the
[2:48:52] Son of man that you will visit him
[2:48:55] acquainted man in the cabin of Eden and
[2:48:57] put a man the same way he wants to
[2:49:01] control this man and by the panem tell
[2:49:03] us and you know when he came down gen
[2:49:05] 1:26
[2:49:06] that was God coming down his control
[2:49:08] tower in Adam are the control tower was
[2:49:12] by the word the seven spirits of God in
[2:49:16] Adam soul
[2:49:25] and in the physical do you see this
[2:49:29] control of God right down to everything
[2:49:33] that God does he's a God of console in
[2:49:35] Adams body your body is so controlled so
[2:49:41] controlled you have a control center in
[2:49:44] your head control the whole human body
[2:49:46] every cell has a control center
[2:49:49] everything is so controlled he's a God
[2:49:52] of control and that control brings an
[2:49:55] order
[2:49:58] so God so God when he gave Adam to
[2:50:06] control the earth he was sitting right
[2:50:08] an Adam spoon in Adams heart with his
[2:50:12] control tower
[2:50:14] it chose man's had to be his control he
[2:50:16] was seated there in the form of his
[2:50:19] seven spirits and Adam was subject to
[2:50:22] this control and then the earth was to
[2:50:24] me to Adams control amen
[2:50:27] glory to God a man can you share
[2:50:32] hallelujah are you following our story
[2:50:36] it's a beautiful story of redemption now
[2:50:42] like I said the devil gives a rap went
[2:50:44] about control I wish I'd want to control
[2:50:46] me it's very young people want to
[2:50:47] control me I'll lose my freedom they'd
[2:50:50] let me watch them what I do know here
[2:50:52] was God controlling Adam in the Garden
[2:50:53] of Eden God was absolutely in control
[2:50:56] what in this control like by the daily
[2:50:58] preach and choices watch in this control
[2:51:01] in this control why did God tell Adam of
[2:51:05] all the trees you go eat but this one
[2:51:08] don't eat but it's your choice I give
[2:51:11] you a choice not inside God's control
[2:51:13] got left room for a choice that for Adam
[2:51:16] to be or not to be for Adam to obey
[2:51:19] model be that's why so we get control
[2:51:21] one number one we control you get a do
[2:51:24] it here parents control the children you
[2:51:27] know do this here do this here or God
[2:51:33] didn't do that
[2:51:36] the controller is not your word those
[2:51:39] spirits are lost when don't respect your
[2:51:40] word the rest man I recognize gets word
[2:51:44] is that same don't control your children
[2:51:46] but God controlling his son Adam he told
[2:51:51] him this is what I'm going to do but if
[2:51:54] you choose the other way no their
[2:51:57] consequences with your choice so God's
[2:52:00] control leaves a room for a choice I
[2:52:06] [Applause]
[2:52:10] know why you know why nobody grows on
[2:52:17] the very controlling atmosphere nobody
[2:52:21] goes why you Anna Church everything is
[2:52:25] control sit down stand up you can't even
[2:52:28] think for yourself when you're at home
[2:52:31] sit downs cannot okay you do this here
[2:52:34] the church the pastor deacons do this
[2:52:35] here and the pastor's get away to take
[2:52:37] it away from them and do everything by
[2:52:38] himself and they the deacon you know you
[2:52:41] will never grow the same way in a home
[2:52:44] somewhere at home we don't give the
[2:52:47] people a chance to be and not to be too
[2:52:49] to grow to make their mistakes to learn
[2:52:52] that's what choices are there the
[2:52:55] process of choices lets you go through
[2:52:58] thinking it through if I go this way if
[2:53:03] I go this way these are the consequences
[2:53:05] if I go that way these are the
[2:53:06] consequences just talking to you and I
[2:53:10] hope you are listening if I go this way
[2:53:12] these are the consequences if I go
[2:53:14] through the consequences no I will go
[2:53:16] this way and not that way
[2:53:18] and in that process is a maturing
[2:53:22] process through the thinking process
[2:53:24] that's why God gave us choices to think
[2:53:27] through your choices and in control he
[2:53:30] lets us have room to be or not to be he
[2:53:33] doesn't crowd out our space so it's a
[2:53:36] lie when the devil says husain is all
[2:53:41] about controlling you controlling
[2:53:43] people's minds no in god's system of
[2:53:45] control you have a choice
[2:53:49] to obey or not to obey in the devil stem
[2:53:53] of control he gives you no choice even
[2:53:56] when you don't want to do wrong he
[2:53:58] forces you to do wrong you know like the
[2:54:03] prodigal son it's the I don't like this
[2:54:05] Oh Mia too much computing this one here
[2:54:07] I'll go to my father say father I'm
[2:54:10] tired of this control here I'm gone on
[2:54:15] his valiant said no you're not going
[2:54:18] proving that he was wrong in the first
[2:54:20] instance father let him go and the
[2:54:25] control he was getting the way from
[2:54:26] running away from from his father did he
[2:54:28] meet you where he went
[2:54:34] did he meet the control he went on was
[2:54:38] so all his substance he was free freedom
[2:54:41] to do what he wanted to know this
[2:54:43] control gives you freedom not to live
[2:54:46] like a freedom to do the right thing
[2:54:50] freedom to shun the wrong and do the
[2:54:52] right thing that's God's control and
[2:54:55] you'll give your children that same
[2:54:57] opportunity to have the choice to do the
[2:54:59] right thing or do the wrong thing when
[2:55:03] they get to that age of accountability
[2:55:04] if the choice is the choice Oh glory to
[2:55:10] God amen amen
[2:55:14] so Adam when he sinned and he lost
[2:55:23] control you want to get to control right
[2:55:26] back I need to wrong things and that's
[2:55:28] like I said that's what we all do we
[2:55:30] want control and we do the wrong things
[2:55:31] it becomes my way or the highway makes a
[2:55:36] domineering dominant you know nobody
[2:55:39] must be our way and no other way that's
[2:55:45] not good we have control and you'll
[2:55:47] never come to adoption like that more
[2:55:49] you will never Oh glory I'm not making
[2:55:52] sense
[2:55:55] I'm almost done I'm almost done so God
[2:56:04] will lend for me how this control comes
[2:56:07] about can I have the first my first
[2:56:11] picture there all right
[2:56:20] hello him have thoughts on his mind and
[2:56:25] that makes sense right
[2:56:27] and then arrow him put his thoughts into
[2:56:30] a body called the logos a body like this
[2:56:32] body but with the better seen it's
[2:56:34] supernatural body and all that and these
[2:56:36] thoughts narrowing became what seats in
[2:56:39] the loggers Adam was that funny narrow
[2:56:42] him you - a narrow him
[2:56:44] I was it for the narrow him so what got
[2:56:47] in in Genesis 1:26 was he took Adam seed
[2:56:51] in the logos the Bible says God created
[2:56:54] man in his own image of that seed he
[2:56:57] created a perfect man and that became
[2:57:02] the spirit man in Genesis 1:26 - 28 and
[2:57:08] you were still they as a throat a seed
[2:57:11] word in the Lourdes and what Adam was to
[2:57:15] do was so standing in the timeless
[2:57:17] season call you out and here you would
[2:57:20] have come God take your seat from the
[2:57:21] loggers and this is your seed and your
[2:57:25] serum your seat and your seed and God
[2:57:27] took it out and created the purpose of
[2:57:31] creation that's the only the quitter
[2:57:33] that can do that that can take a seat
[2:57:35] and walk in and fall it into the image
[2:57:39] of God 7 perfect spirits that's what he
[2:57:43] did in Genesis 1 2028 Genesis 1:26 was
[2:57:47] not the theophany it was it feel funny
[2:57:49] seed that was created and unfasten it to
[2:57:54] the image of God and ventures to 7 it
[2:57:59] took that spirit man put of flesh around
[2:58:02] him
[2:58:02] well this you're funny this seed was
[2:58:06] Adam soul and put inflation on him and
[2:58:11] just used two services go from man just
[2:58:14] 1:26 was the creation that's the
[2:58:16] creation this happens on the inside and
[2:58:19] then fun man on the face of the earth
[2:58:21] no man can do the Christian on the
[2:58:23] inside only God but man can do the
[2:58:26] farming on the outside like brother
[2:58:28] Charles was talking about the Nigerian
[2:58:29] doctor they can work on the flesh they
[2:58:31] can work on the body they can American
[2:58:33] shadow to a prosthetic limb and you have
[2:58:36] things they can cottonseed up but no man
[2:58:38] can cut open here the soul only God can
[2:58:41] do the walk of creation on the inside
[2:58:42] [Applause]
[2:58:45] next picture this was Adam before the
[2:58:56] fall in his soul was seven perfect
[2:59:02] spirits that was a spirit man and that's
[2:59:07] been my was a control tower the control
[2:59:10] tower was not Adam it was the world got
[2:59:12] controlling by his word and I was under
[2:59:16] the control of the ward in his soul and
[2:59:20] man just became a living soul when he
[2:59:23] put flesh on him the saw the what image
[2:59:26] lived out through the flesh man became a
[2:59:29] living soul but watch it when Adam fell
[2:59:37] what happened
[2:59:38] I don't you need to understand this you
[2:59:40] know what the battle has been for you
[2:59:42] and I the devil knew with the word and
[2:59:48] Adam soul he has no chance so what he
[2:59:53] did he came and began to attack his
[2:59:57] spirit it ever can never get your soul
[3:00:02] began to attack his spirit where you
[3:00:06] have your affection memory reasoning
[3:00:08] imagination conscience began to attack
[3:00:11] it has God said to reach the other world
[3:00:16] has God said if God said no that's not
[3:00:19] what it is here this was the Comptroller
[3:00:23] the world in the soul and he speaks the
[3:00:28] spirit listens it speaks the body
[3:00:30] listens and man became a living soul the
[3:00:32] soul lived through this flesh this
[3:00:35] spirit could not stand in the way but
[3:00:41] the devil came and succeeded in getting
[3:00:45] me here and government to reason the
[3:00:48] word has God said no God hasn't said and
[3:00:53] all that and then when man fell he fell
[3:00:58] short of the glory of God this was the
[3:01:02] glory of God inside and this Gloria
[3:01:04] Gorman's fell this world became
[3:01:06] shortened it came from in his stature or
[3:01:11] the fullness became a little seed in his
[3:01:15] saw the control tower was with the use
[3:01:17] of a little seed and that never got in
[3:01:20] here introduced another control tower to
[3:01:22] began to reason the word so after the
[3:01:28] fall the control tower the what image
[3:01:31] became a little seed and thus a man have
[3:01:33] seen and fallen short of the glory of
[3:01:37] God the glory of God that you're funny
[3:01:40] in seed form in your soul seven perfect
[3:01:43] spirits the nature of God in your soul
[3:01:46] the fall became ready used because man
[3:01:49] fare reduce to this little button amen
[3:01:55] so the control tower did not did no
[3:01:57] longer have the power that he had to
[3:02:00] control the spirit and the flesh because
[3:02:02] the devil got in here with his own
[3:02:05] control Lucifer's control tower the
[3:02:08] human mind which is your brain to reason
[3:02:11] things out can you say Amen
[3:02:16] amen so brother sister that's been our
[3:02:25] story can give me the third one I'm
[3:02:31] almost done really all right
[3:02:33] that's been our story this is your human
[3:02:36] mind the brain the physical brain is the
[3:02:39] body but that is the spirit that makes
[3:02:40] you work and that's with your human mind
[3:02:42] so the human mind works with the brain
[3:02:44] and like I explained before right here
[3:02:47] is your emotions right there the front
[3:02:49] of the brain is where you have the
[3:02:51] reasoning and when you live in your
[3:02:54] human mind at the level of your human
[3:02:55] mind
[3:02:56] what you are doing is that your reason
[3:02:58] and your emotions at work all the time
[3:03:00] all the time the control tower is to
[3:03:03] shut up your soul is no longer
[3:03:06] controlling like that when you are
[3:03:08] living in the humanistic realm your soul
[3:03:11] which is the control tower for God
[3:03:15] instead of shut up and this is the
[3:03:17] devil's control tower your reasoning and
[3:03:21] your emotions your intellect is the
[3:03:23] lecture of mine you read the Bible and
[3:03:26] then your intellect your mind know this
[3:03:28] can happen the doctors say that can
[3:03:29] never happen and all of that I know what
[3:03:34] you you can check this out not me saying
[3:03:37] that because all your sensations come
[3:03:40] through here emotions are given an upper
[3:03:43] hand all the time when you see at this
[3:03:46] level here your emotions will always win
[3:03:49] against your reasoning that's why when
[3:03:52] you know you know something is wrong to
[3:03:54] do while your emotions get you solar
[3:03:57] control you are so angry you know I
[3:03:59] should be angry like that your emotions
[3:04:01] win all the time between your emotions
[3:04:03] and your wrists your intellect your
[3:04:05] emotions you are wired the originals
[3:04:07] will get the upper hand all the time so
[3:04:10] when the fall happened the devil
[3:04:12] religious to live at this level war of
[3:04:17] emotions versus your reasoning have God
[3:04:21] said yes and no God say we shouldn't do
[3:04:24] it but no you will become whatever and
[3:04:26] put his hand in here
[3:04:28] the emotions felt good and the motions
[3:04:31] massage your reasoning the motions that
[3:04:32] are given an opera hand all the time
[3:04:35] whatever controls your emotions controls
[3:04:38] you
[3:04:43] so funny man that's his teach and God
[3:04:53] said I will not give you back that
[3:04:57] inheritance in life until I can get men
[3:05:00] back to the spot to where the control
[3:05:03] tower will be set back in his heart in
[3:05:06] that had compartment and that controls
[3:05:09] how we control the intellect will
[3:05:10] control the emotions control the body
[3:05:12] like it did in Adam before the fall
[3:05:15] that's been the Gospel story to get mom
[3:05:18] back to that spot to where God can take
[3:05:22] charge again and control your reasoning
[3:05:25] control your emotions control your flesh
[3:05:27] body that's been the Gospel story and
[3:05:30] that's why I sent you a prophet a man
[3:05:33] you may be seated
[3:05:34] Oh glory now can it send it back to the
[3:05:51] picture before this one right so here we
[3:05:57] are these where we are headed for but
[3:06:00] this is where we are when we come in to
[3:06:03] this world a little seed in us seed of
[3:06:07] God is a little seed but it's not the
[3:06:09] control tower normal the control is
[3:06:12] taking place here from your reason and
[3:06:14] emotions than your flesh and your your
[3:06:17] insolate and all the time your emotions
[3:06:19] always win because that's why man has
[3:06:22] become like one of us to know good and
[3:06:24] evil and he said to him that knows what
[3:06:28] is good and does it not to him it's in
[3:06:31] that's how we seen you no good and you
[3:06:34] don't do it because your emotions
[3:06:36] control you
[3:06:37] they catch your your feelings first and
[3:06:40] they guide what you do and we act and
[3:06:42] then think later so that's been the wall
[3:06:50] well when you become a Christian when
[3:06:54] become a believer this sit in the soul
[3:06:58] is walking up and that is journey to go
[3:07:04] back here we are going back where we
[3:07:08] fell from they will not leave you
[3:07:15] comfortless is that I will come again he
[3:07:18] will come and save you say to the weary
[3:07:21] one your God has surely come he will
[3:07:24] come and save you or let's drive it home
[3:07:26] now and go out of here glory may be see
[3:07:28] the glory so when you become a Christian
[3:07:40] this Syriac wets out ghost control tower
[3:07:46] begins to come back into the human soul
[3:07:48] because God controls by his world not by
[3:07:51] the parents words not by the pastor's
[3:07:54] words by his words he controlled the
[3:07:57] universe all of those galaxies are there
[3:07:59] by his words he doesn't cried over them
[3:08:02] like a helicopter it is the Sun staining
[3:08:05] his flesh
[3:08:06] he's just wandering there he doesn't
[3:08:07] know his word because what has no power
[3:08:10] in itself it meant to make this pass on
[3:08:14] the moon and the Sun and the galaxies to
[3:08:16] hang in their spaces
[3:08:17] thus one has the power why one does not
[3:08:21] have the power to keep your children our
[3:08:23] control to keep the stress on your
[3:08:25] children under control Laury Laury
[3:08:31] [Applause]
[3:08:35] you may be seated just talking to you
[3:08:41] so guts in the process of taking control
[3:08:49] back over Adam and when Adam is totally
[3:08:55] again under the control of God the earth
[3:08:58] will automatically come on the Adams
[3:09:01] control will be back here will be back
[3:09:05] here seven perfect spirits the image of
[3:09:10] God or what image in Adams soul
[3:09:12] undaunted into his flesh again and man
[3:09:17] will go up and down the earth again like
[3:09:19] Adam just see the Lord or keep still and
[3:09:23] that's what the devil fights that word
[3:09:26] so bad he pollutes the water he deletes
[3:09:36] the word interpreter word but thank God
[3:09:40] down through the ages we have examples
[3:09:44] examples of heroes in the Bible who
[3:09:47] correct dreams of the water God clever
[3:09:51] of the day and age even in the Old
[3:09:53] Testament and this was selling their
[3:09:56] soul and had under total control and
[3:09:59] when this word is in the soul and after
[3:10:02] that control the flesh is subject
[3:10:05] circumstance run is subject this one in
[3:10:09] the soap messages every circumstance
[3:10:12] [Applause]
[3:10:13] hallelujah let's call some on the scene
[3:10:17] Moses the prophet Moses then he was is
[3:10:25] been spoken about in this vision I don't
[3:10:26] have to go through all of that but here
[3:10:27] was Moses at the Red Sea God I told him
[3:10:32] lie below visible as man come back and
[3:10:34] watching me on this mountain and God
[3:10:36] said go back by the way of Midgar and by
[3:10:40] the way the ratio was ahead of them
[3:10:42] God didn't tell him that when he got
[3:10:45] let's see a circumstance the things in
[3:10:48] what's gonna suffer and he'll was death
[3:10:51] and uncover all of them speaking had

[3:10:58] way of the Red Sea Conroy's went to

[3:11:04] didn't you go back the same way God
[3:11:06] spirit let him at will meet God and
[3:11:09] there was the Red Sea there but you are
[3:11:12] sworn by himself
[3:11:13] thy seed share who says every guard
[3:11:20] every guard shall be possessed you
[3:11:24] believe that or a glory may be seated
[3:11:28] oh brother I'm not doing too badly may
[3:11:35] be seated
[3:11:41] it was Moses the Prophet the word came
[3:11:45] to him on the war dropped in his soul
[3:11:48] sunlight in his soul the word for that
[3:11:52] day for that age from the presence of
[3:11:57] God the glory of God in his soul amen
[3:12:00] the control tower was still in Moses
[3:12:03] soul and every challenge that he met was
[3:12:09] an opportunity to learn obedience by the
[3:12:12] things he was suffering there was data
[3:12:14] Koren speaking against him don't speak
[3:12:16] back against them don't go the way
[3:12:18] they're going father was AHA me to the
[3:12:21] ward is in control the what led him

[3:12:40] lost
[3:12:41] God the one to feel overwhelmed run
[3:12:46] through the perilous the heroes of faith
[3:12:47] this was thrown at us guess that yeah
[3:12:49] this no damn even in the Lions Den
[3:12:54] down because the world will possess
[3:12:59] every dirt of every enemy Oh God crying
[3:13:05] back to Moses white ground to me speak
[3:13:08] and go forward
[3:13:10] are you ready to speak we are gonna get
[3:13:14] to it under the blood of bulls and goats
[3:13:26] Moses spoke on the ratio open up another
[3:13:31] parables and gods Moses spoke and the
[3:13:35] rest it closed up unfair one in strong
[3:13:38] men what drowned of the myths of the sea
[3:13:42] why is shadow if for tests or way will
[3:13:48] be like when the water God is sitting as
[3:13:51] a controller in your soul again like I
[3:13:54] said an atom so old
[3:13:56] hallelujah our Elijah how about Joshua
[3:14:00] he needed some light to follow the
[3:14:03] Amalekites to follow the Midianites is
[3:14:06] the Lord he was few more lot of sunlight

[3:14:14] the day and age in his soul he knew the
[3:14:16] seed shall possess every gauge
[3:14:26] you can run through the Bible Gideon and
[3:14:28] Barack and Daniel in the lion's den he
[3:14:32] didn't panic
[3:14:33] he said if I perish I perish he walk
[3:14:38] that lounged in glory to call him an
[3:14:42] lurid Oh God
[3:14:44] I said Lord Here I am until the land or
[3:14:47] and sitting on the lion in the Old
[3:14:50] Testament under the blood of bulls and
[3:14:51] goats with the word back a little
[3:14:54] portion of the world before Christ died
[3:14:55] in the question of the war in their
[3:14:57] souls they had that much control that's
[3:15:05] the part that with God that will hang
[3:15:07] those billions of galaxies and had them
[3:15:09] read under control
[3:15:10] this word control the mass of lions and
[3:15:16] that's what Tom will fail us to tell of
[3:15:19] gideon and Parekh and Semien in other
[3:15:21] words who through faith the one in the
[3:15:24] soul subdued mountains who through faith
[3:15:27] meant to fly the armies are the aliens
[3:15:30] the water got in the saw Oh God
[3:15:36] bringing that walk back to full control
[3:15:39] to sit in your head as king on your
[3:15:43] throne or King like in Shannon Adams
[3:15:46] throne and when Jesus came the war
[3:15:54] himself he was the word he was a second
[3:15:58] atom the fullness of the world was in
[3:16:01] him there he was the warden his soul the
[3:16:06] word control reasoning in the human
[3:16:10] spirit control affection in my spirit
[3:16:12] that was shine through his flesh and the
[3:16:15] world was Christ possessing every gate
[3:16:18] of the enemy Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[3:16:24] the waves were roaring the sea was
[3:16:26] roaring is that piece Bastille just like
[3:16:30] I don't need Oh fresh and beat
[3:16:33] beneficial from the fire whatever it was
[3:16:35] he spoke that one and he quitted it
[3:16:37] still just like that because the water
[3:16:40] was back in control in the Hat of a son
[3:16:43] of God the Son of God Jesus Christ
[3:16:45] he showed us what it would be like when
[3:16:48] the water is back in your soul again Oh
[3:16:51] hallelujah glory glory to God amen amen
[3:16:59] amen amen
[3:17:02] Orry I once Christ died once Christ died
[3:17:13] he made a way for sons of God to go
[3:17:17] right back from his sitting the soul Rob
[3:17:21] back to the stature of the fullness of
[3:17:25] Christ in the human soul one more time
[3:17:28] those ten like Jesus Christ to those ten
[3:17:31] like atoms tool and speak the water cord
[3:17:33] it will query cell just like that
[3:17:36] and that's why you save all the prophets
[3:17:38] the problem William Branham Oh glory to
[3:17:40] God Oh hallelujah brother Branham said
