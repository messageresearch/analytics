[56:13] this is God speaking to Joshua and got
[56:16] her and Josh for this book of the law
[56:17] shall not depart out of thy mouth but
[56:20] also meditate therein day and night that
[56:22] Dom is observed to do according to all
[56:24] that is written therein for then thou
[56:26] shalt make their way prosperous and thou
[56:29] shall have good success have not I
[56:31] commanded thee be strong and of a good
[56:34] courage be not afraid neither be thou
[56:37] dismayed for the Lord thy God is with
[56:40] thee whithersoever thou goest and before
[56:43] that God told Joshua additional not any
[56:45] man be able to stand before thee I will
[56:46] all the days of my life as I was with

[56:53] strong I love good courage for under
[56:56] this people shall adorn divine for an
[56:58] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[57:00] their fathers to give them and it's it's
[57:03] something else to see why God will
[57:06] actually give Joshua and remind him to
[57:09] be courageous and to be strong because
[57:12] they grow in a battle they never went
[57:14] before and I landed never went up before

[57:23] need that we will call courage courage
[57:25] is put in your strength at risk and the
[57:28] word courage is dictionary the ability
[57:32] to do something that frightens one

[1:37:49] revelation it takes experience to speak
[1:37:52] back you man these things it's alright
[1:37:55] ok so now watch the prophets it here on
[1:38:00] greetings battle ya know before anybody
[1:38:02] could be put in re they first have to
[1:38:04] choose a meeting room or a place where
[1:38:08] the battle is to be fought a selected
[1:38:10] place and in the First World War it was
[1:38:13] called no man's land
[1:38:14] all right places where they formed they
[1:38:17] had to be a place selected is now on an
[1:38:20] Israel went to war the Philistines he
[1:38:22] said it was a hill on each side where
[1:38:23] they gathered and so on that was a place
[1:38:25] where they fought the Lions and
[1:38:26] everything is that it had to be a place
[1:38:28] selected he said and this is a mutual
[1:38:31] ground no man's land they fight here in
[1:38:34] this place so it's a mutual ground go to
[1:38:38] meet you there but it never committed a
[1:38:40] also it's a mutual ground they both have
[1:38:43] to be able to to clash at this point in
[1:38:46] the battle ground hallelujah is not
[1:38:49] right it's not and they fight here this
[1:38:54] place they don't just fight one over
[1:38:56] here and one over down here and one
[1:38:57] round on there he said there's a battle
[1:38:59] front where they meet and they test
[1:39:03] their power
[1:39:06] it's not in the battlefront where they
[1:39:09] meet and they test their powers test a
[1:39:12] nuclear test their bombs test their guns
[1:39:15] it's not there's got to be a battlefront
[1:39:18] where each army tested strength against
[1:39:21] the other army a mutual meeting place
[1:39:24] he said now don't miss this when this
[1:39:26] great battle started on it there had to
[1:39:28] be a mutual meeting place they have to
[1:39:30] be a place selected for the battle to
[1:39:32] begin and for the battle to reach and a
[1:39:35] battleground begins in a human mind
[1:39:38] that's where it starts it's not what I
[1:39:41] were just talking about yesterday it's
[1:39:42] not it starts in a mine then it drops
[1:39:45] down to your heart it's not right he
[1:39:47] said but that's where it starts it is
[1:39:49] alright because that's where decisions
[1:39:51] are made from the mind
[1:39:53] from the head it's not right because
[1:39:57] thou hast chosen there now away the
[1:40:00] harder way you have chosen holily is not
[1:40:02] right it means nothing of mine said no
[1:40:05] they never started it from some
[1:40:06] organization they never started it from
[1:40:08] some mechanical affair okay
[1:40:10] you said the grounds never started a
[1:40:12] therefore that organization could never
[1:40:14] do the work of God because a
[1:40:16] battleground is where you've got to meet
[1:40:19] your enemy a man is in the mind and
[1:40:22] you've got to make your choice holily
[1:40:25] and it beats you you make your choice to
[1:40:28] serve God you make a conscious decision
[1:40:30] a conscious clear-cut decision harder to
[1:40:34] serve God finally in season out of
[1:40:36] season
[1:40:37] what do you feel like it what do you
[1:40:39] don't feel like it
[1:40:40] you've got your mind made up to serve
[1:40:43] the Lord and you won't turn back because
[1:40:46] you make out a promise that you is gonna
[1:40:49] make it somehow somewhere deep in your
[1:40:54] soul you take courage and what the word
[1:40:57] says he said I'll never leave you he
[1:41:00] said I'll never forsake you he's never
[1:41:02] I'll be with you in your trials on your
[1:41:05] job in your home on the streets wherever
[1:41:08] whenever
[1:41:10] he will meet you there there's no place
[1:41:13] he can't go that his hand cannot reach
[1:41:15] you there's no place too far there's no
[1:41:18] height too hot there's no valley to know
[1:41:21] that he can't come find you
[1:41:23] he'll find your total he'll find your
[1:41:26] wife
[1:41:27] you'll find your husband he'll find your
[1:41:29] children but boys of God will thank you
[1:41:33] ever you are
[1:41:33] we hear that points this morning and we
[1:41:37] respond to the voice of God
[1:41:43] hallelujah he's calling us salvation
[1:41:45] he's calling us to repentance he's
[1:41:48] calling us to the Holy Ghost he's
[1:41:50] calling us back to himself the angel of
[1:41:53] God is on yet the manifestation the Holy
[1:41:56] Spirit is that angel trival appears not
[1:41:59] that this or that but to the Word of God
[1:42:01] because God can only manifest the world
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:07] he cannot manifest your thoughts that's
[1:42:11] why we don't preach all thoughts in this
[1:42:12] church we preach the Word of God in
[1:42:15] season out of season
[1:42:17] because when the Holy Spirit falls it
[1:42:19] will fall upon this it kind of fall upon
[1:42:23] preach and kind of thrown upon dogmas
[1:42:25] and kind of wallop on dreams and
[1:42:27] interpretation but it will fall upon
[1:42:29] this there shall be a people my
[1:42:32] spiritual pour out upon you you shall be
[1:42:35] witnesses upon your sons daughters
[1:42:38] that's a promise and we stay with that
[1:42:42] word until God answer the court fulfill
[1:42:46] [Applause]
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:55] [Applause]
[1:42:58] [Music]

[1:54:38] what happened on the earth there's a
[1:54:40] part of you up there being represented

[1:54:47] it's not my chance you come to the

[1:54:59] like God was speaking to you it didn't
[1:55:01] matter who was on the left who was on
[1:55:04] all right but Paul spoke to your heart
[1:55:06] gospel to your life when you first heard
[1:55:10] the word or when you first heard the
[1:55:12] gospel suddenly is how you clicked
[1:55:14] something is how you turn back each and
[1:55:17] every one of you at every point of your
[1:55:20] life at the very point of your need and
[1:55:23] you heard exactly what you needed to
[1:55:25] hear Oh hallelujah

[1:55:30] a place of your father that was the
[1:55:33] voice of your husband calling you
[1:55:35] calling you out to the world and into
[1:55:38] the skies into the heavenlies and to
[1:55:41] heavenly places in Christ
[1:55:43] [Music]

[2:11:17] necessarily by his wingspan all that's
[2:11:20] built in he's a big strong boy but what
[2:11:22] is it he's got something inside his
[2:11:25] nature that pushes him into the eye of
[2:11:28] the strong there's something called pill
[2:11:30] inside of him to go beyond what he sees
[2:11:34] hallelujah to go into where others would
[2:11:37] not be sit where others wouldn't have
[2:11:39] the courage they have the car to go
[2:11:41] beyond

[2:11:43] inside your soul that gives us courage
[2:11:46] to bring even when others say don't pray
[2:11:49] forget about it why don't you cook or
[2:11:52] untie you can still take heart take
[2:11:54] courage this morning that all God is
[2:11:57] able to deliver to set the captive free

[2:12:05] change your heart to change your life
[2:12:08] doesn't matter how you feel it's about
[2:12:10] what God said in his word he said I'm
[2:12:14] not leaving comfortless but I will come
[2:12:16] to you yet a little while and the world
[2:12:19] will see me no more but you are going to
[2:12:22] see me hallelujah
[2:12:29] right now we live in a very scientific
[2:12:32] age there's so much creature comforts
[2:12:35] there's so much technology there's so
[2:12:37] much things to depend on now I have a
[2:12:40] conversation I family some time and I
[2:12:41] was saying that you know it wasn't
[2:12:44] always like that
[2:12:45] and people didn't have all these things
[2:12:48] to rely on now if you wanted to go to a
[2:12:51] certain place you could go on your food
[2:12:53] use ways or Google Maps or whatever it
[2:12:57] tells you the traffic it tells you to
[2:12:59] weather long time ago people sat in the
[2:13:01] car and they prayed that God would make
[2:13:04] a way I go to open a door that God will
[2:13:08] keep the weather let go keep the traffic
[2:13:10] hallelujah let go to propely hallelujah
[2:13:13] where's this God hallelujah that Court
[2:13:16] is still here this morning his rules
[2:13:18] have not changed he said I am God and I
[2:13:21] changed not his will doesn't change his
[2:13:24] Buddhist offer on me it's still the same
[2:13:27] yesterday today and forever Oh
[2:13:30] hallelujah hallelujah bless man has
[2:13:32] increased and his dependability is no
[2:13:35] more upon God but now he's becoming
[2:13:37] dependent
[2:13:38] I've caught onto his own self and has
[2:13:41] made images onto his own self that he
[2:13:43] worships some people worship that car
[2:13:45] somebody worship the achievements some
[2:13:47] people worship a family some people
[2:13:49] worship what they have done what they
[2:13:51] have built their legacies and dependency
[2:13:54] upon
[2:13:54] God is declining but I'm saying today
[2:13:57] it's gonna come a time but perilous
[2:14:00] times shall come men shall be lovers on
[2:14:02] themselves and of pleasures more than
[2:14:04] lovers of God truth breakers false
[2:14:06] accusers but in that time God with other
[2:14:09] people who know how to trust upon him
[2:14:12] who will know how to lead upon God for
[2:14:15] everything for anything he is the source
[2:14:20] of our strength he is the source of our
[2:14:22] life
[2:14:22] he's a sauce hallelujah he is the reason
[2:14:25] why my heart beats he's the reason I'm
[2:14:27] here this morning
[2:14:28] he's a reason I worship he's the reason
[2:14:31] I lift my hands the Bible says even a
[2:14:34] youth shall paint and utterly fall but
[2:14:37] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[2:14:40] their strength that has not changed that
[2:14:44] is still true this morning
[2:14:45] this morning if you lift up your hands
[2:14:48] and you close eyes and you truly worship
[2:14:51] and I changed another place that same
[2:14:54] Court is here for you yes Lord he will
[2:14:57] touch you
[2:14:58] he will anoint you he was vibrate inside
[2:15:01] of you and give me your power we want a
[2:15:16] real God we want to live in God we want
[2:15:20] the god of the word that's what this
[2:15:22] will needs that's what the young people
[2:15:24] need to hear from God the experienced
[2:15:27] God for themselves to get in contact
[2:15:31] with this core of the Bible with this
[2:15:34] core of the scripture then it no more
[2:15:36] becomes Scripture but somebody begins to
[2:15:39] turn in your own life how somebody gets
[2:15:42] a turn in your own walk it's not when I
[2:15:47] was younger I would read the Bible I'm
[2:15:49] sure it was a Bible there were verses

[2:15:53] church you hear a preacher preach and
[2:15:55] you would hear things go forth I know it

[2:16:21] to you when you're not even worried
[2:16:23] about who is on the pulpit but you are
[2:16:26] waiting to hear from your tyranny you
[2:16:29] know we tend to hear from your God
[2:16:31] doesn't matter who's non the left who's
[2:16:34] on the right we are here to escape this
[2:16:37] world and all its cares and run to Jesus

[3:03:26] amnesia when we walked and lived here
[3:03:28] but Lord your work came to remove the
[3:03:31] scales remove the blindness from us to
[3:03:33] give us a joy to give us a peace ago as
[3:03:35] a comfort we think you'll be committed

[3:03:47] Lord one day the service will not over
[3:03:53] one day will break into such a realm all
[3:03:57] that consumes your minds but the Antony
[3:03:59] brought out he said there has to be a
[3:04:00] place where the war is fought there has
[3:04:03] to be a place where the frontline of the
[3:04:06] battle takes place and that place has
[3:04:08] been agreed it's in your mind but if you
[3:04:10] could just be renewed and transformed by
[3:04:12] the renewing of your mind to recognize
[3:04:14] that that the thoughts have come to you
[3:04:16] the negative towards the thoughts of
[3:04:18] fear and unbelief that's not from God
[3:04:20] and if your faith in the word that you
[3:04:22] hear every service could be so anointed
[3:04:25] that it could deal with the doubts and
[3:04:27] the fears in your mind if you shall
[3:04:28] believe and if you shall see and speak
[3:04:30] to your situation you don't even need a
[3:04:32] pastor to speak to your situation you
[3:04:34] have the power to speak to your
[3:04:36] situation you have the power to speak in
[3:04:38] your home god meat and cream and eat
[3:04:41] order the veal from top to bottom to
[3:04:43] abolish the old priesthood to let you
[3:04:46] know that you are royal priests you are
[3:04:48] a peculiar people
[3:04:49] you are holy nation and there's power
[3:04:52] locked up in you that the devil does not
[3:04:54] want you to know there's power in you
[3:04:58] that the devil wish you don't look in
[3:05:00] the room in your soul where the power is
[3:05:02] he wants to distract you with your job
[3:05:04] so you don't see the power distract you
[3:05:06] with family problem so you don't see
[3:05:07] your power distract you with your
[3:05:09] sickness so that you don't see the power
[3:05:11] but if you could look beyond your
[3:05:13] sickness look beyond your family look
[3:05:15] beyond your problems look beyond the
[3:05:17] mortgage look beyond the bills look
[3:05:19] beyond your situation and see the power
[3:05:21] and all of a sudden you could speak with
[3:05:23] confidence knowing that God is in you
[3:05:25] God is working through you can the
[3:05:28] church say man

[3:05:46] don't know sir yes to his word
[3:05:49] nor to the devil's lies and tricks and
[3:05:52] what you don't know that's why it's
[3:05:54] morning to get to know the things to all
