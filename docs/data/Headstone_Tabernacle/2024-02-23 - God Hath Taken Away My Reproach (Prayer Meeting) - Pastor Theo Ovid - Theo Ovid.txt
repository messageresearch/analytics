realm of traveling and back and forth this whole week of the stress of this week and bring us into your divine presence even Heavenly places we ask in Jesus name amen and amen men God bless you and thanks so much for being here tonight we always consider it a privilege where Believers of like Precious feet could gather together so tonight if you have your Bibles ID like you to turn to Genesis Chapter 30 and we want to read verse 22 to 24 Genesis Chapter 30 reading verse 22 to 24 and the title of what I want to share with you tonight is taken from this scripture title is God had taken away my Repro and this scripture in Genesis 30 verse 22 reads and God remembered Rachel and God hearkened to her and opened her womb and she conceived and be a son and said God had taken away my approach and she called his name Joseph and said the Lord shall add to me another son Psalms 42 want to go to that s and is a familiar Psalm this a heart pant after the water Brooks so my panted my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirsted for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have remind me day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God when I remember these things I P my soul in me where I had gone with the multitude I went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holding why are th castom oh my soul why thou disired in me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and from the herit from the hill of Mah deep cth un deep and the noise of thy Waters FL all the waves and thy Billows are gone over me yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime and the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life I will say unto my God my rock why hast Thou forsaken me why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy as the sword in my bones my enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me there is thy God may God bless his will reproach and this word reproach I just took it from there are different approaches to it but I want to take it from one particular angle reproach a cause or occasion of blame discredit or disgree and you know because in those times not having a child was such a societal thing that was negative it was a prayer for woman to not to be Barren but to bring forth and that is why Rachel could say that God had taken away my reproach this was a cry this was a prayer and the way the scripture phrased it it's so powerful and God remembered Risha and God hearkened unto her and opened her womb so it mean it meant that there's a part that God played there's a part that re shall pray played and that part is that R was crying out unto God that is what we here to do tonight to cow unto God that God not only remembers what he promised you but he would Heen to your prayer or happen to your cry and whatever is the occasion of disgrace where reproach is concern whether is defeat and battle whether is an exile in enmity the psalmist David prayed for deliverance from the reproach and this is in Psalms 11 19:22 he said remove from me reproach and contempt for I have kept thy testimonies now you don't have to find it but I read it from Daniel 9 when Daniel was praying in verse 15 he said now oh Lord Our God that has brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and has gotten the renowned and at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly oh Lord according to thy righteousness I beseech thee let thine anger and thy Fury be turned away from thy City Jerusalem thy Holy Mountain because of our sins and for the iniquity of our fathers Jerusalem and thy people have become a reproach to all that are about us and because the time is not yet for the Fulfillment of the promised word we have to be a reproach a reproach of baress even one Minister say you have all have nothing up in Sandy you know as if well okay that means they have something but the the problem is we have to bear the reproach of the word and the reproach of the word is a reproach of what God promised and when you understand that there something you want to read to get to you would begin to thank God for his promised word that God is not dead He's Alive the fact that he made the promise is the fact that he will keep that promise because God is not a man that would lie so once God make a promise even though it's dry even though it look like nothing is moving but God can't lie and we have confidence that God will come down and fulfill his will but listen to this so when Daniel was saying thy people have become a reproach to All About Us how come he the bride and you say is the bride and you say when the power come in the church and you know all the scuffing and the criticism and but Daniel went on to pray and said now therefore Oh Our God hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy Sanctuary that is desolate for the Lord's sake oh my God incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplication before thee for our righteousness but for thy great mercies so it is important to note the sincerity of these Godly characters in the Bible how they will talk to the lord they're not saying I the eye and the bride and and um you know a sort of swagger a kind of arrogant Swagger because they believe God like what you find now around kind of arrogance as if God is entitled to do certain things because because the people believe that Saints is not like that what God honors is his word not just hearers of the word but doers of the word and I want to prove to you tonight that is God's plan and program that each one of us bear a reproach for the word so let's continue now he said God has a time and season for that time to fulfill his Works God knows exactly L what he's going to do we don't we just have to receive it as he gives it to us and he knows there's nothing going to go wrong with it he has planned to what he's planned to do it has all got to come about and sometimes here we go rugged and hard things only bring out the real true nature of the object a see must die and rut and smell in order to bring for new life and listen to this partner God sets a and has a purpose for everything that he does there is nothing happen just accidentally to those who love the Lord and a call according to his calling we are predestinated and everything works just right for that because you cannot lie he said that was so and everything has its time here we go It season and it has its way and God is behind every move and this is a problem here people not seeing God behind things they're seeing flesh and blood and they're fighting this and fighting that but if you begin to pull back a bit and watch to see God behind what is taking place sometimes here we go you think that everything is going wrong it's up to us those things are put Upon Us trials and wonderings what is it it is testings to see how we will react on an action now you remember this story about a brandham making love and kind in the church and God dropped down and tell him what he what to do if they say blind they'll be blind you say dead they will die and so like that right and he said I forgive you and then the Holy Spirit fell and God was pleased and here what he said here now I believe all these things have a meaning what would you do with the power how what is your reaction to an action something that has come as an act how they react to that action do you understand remember the word and this is the most important part when to get to you tonight the word has always bought a reproach All Through the Ages God's anointed word has always been reproached and that's the reason it is so hard for people who doesn't understand would know how to accept that reproach so you've got to know how to accept what the world see as a reproach for your baroness our baroness and we can't produce a lot of thing that we speak on and preach on and teach on and Believe on we are yet to produce a lot of stuff and we could be criticized laughed at mocked and scuffed and you have to manage that you have to accept the fact and I remember an experience I had when I was in John Dawson techn Tech Institute doing electrical engineering and I used to stutter I had a stuttering sort of thing and they had a day I was talking about the prophet and the messenger I was testifying witnessing the people and I think I Shar this before and somebody challenged me on the messes of y b is a false prophet and and when I be to talk I be to stutter and the person said look at him you can't even talk you know and fumbling and it was a terrible experience people around laughing and everything else but I walked from dear couldn't finish my sentence but still believe what I believe in my heart it didn't stop me from testifying it didn't stop me from witnessing but I believe what God promised in this song we have to accept the reproach of the world even sisters wear in a dress long dress um people make make comments on it and you could try to Skittle that that by having kind of KN cutting thing and S that you don't want to Bear the approach you don't want to feel out of sort you don't want to feel different from the rest so you find yourself doing things and acting no way to blending with the rest of the crow that means you don't want no reproach you don't want to Bear any pain any suffering any upset but the word has always bore a reproach he said can you remember disciples returning rejoicing and he said all that live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution that is the reproach for the world and here is bum you always have to stand this reproach in order to give you tested all right so here we go if character is a victory and character is based upon the test that we get and the test that we get is based upon the reproach then reproach should be welcomed and and your reproach our reproach my reproach is based upon our standing for the word we not talking about reproach for stealing or rubbing or holding up somebody or doing some crazy stuff we talking about for the word sake the word that you believe and the word that you believe that God promised all right so watch you always have to stand this reproach in order to give you a testing and every man that comes to Christ must supp be child trained now remember this is the hard partner if you can just keep quiet so you have to kind of carry on what you're going through I can't take it no more and you know that kind of drama if you can just keep quiet remember here we go and this is where trust comes in in what is about to be spoken if he has called you for this there is nothing can keep it from happening there is not enough Devil's in torment but what God's word will make manifest you are born for a purpose and nobody can take your place you might have impersonators everything else they will never take your place God word will Triumph it cannot fail there is where every Christian ought to stand knowing that God that that God would will tra it cannot fail and trials will come up and seem every way to you but remember God has a purpose and it will work right God has a purpose and it will work right you believe that tonight that it will work out right okay okay we on speak about Abraham right father of Nations 25 years Sarah what did Abraham said he stack not of the promise of God to unbelief what is embarrassment God a son coming a son coming talking only prophesying you only prophesying about a son name Isaac coming and 5 years P 10 years past 15 years all you is are talking Church all is are talking people you are talking man but Abraham staggered not at the promise of God to unbelief why and he said you said you pray for so and so it didn't get well that doesn't matter if I pay for 10,000 tonight and 10,000 die in morning tomorrow night I'm still anointing the sick and praying for them God said so it doesn't stop it a bit I believe it certain don't make any difference what they say they will Scuf but that's the reproach of the world you have to manage scuence you have to manage critici people criticizing and so on this is just part of it and then he said this we Abraham here we go standing on God's word finally it was fulfilled watch the scuff of baronet the scuff of baronet being scuffed and the reproach of barness sometime your wife could scuff at you your husband could scuff at you your children could scuff they don't believe your testimony they don't believe your story she had to stand the reproach of being Barren for all these years she was nearly 100 years old she was 90 Abraham baren both of their bodies as good as dead but God kept his word in that Dark Hour Isaac was born God always answers his word yes baress first then Isaac what baress first so God says he given the people opportunity to mock to laugh y Thunders where's the new name Thunders where the Revival have thunders this and all kind of drama and question they want to ask all because you confess the word that are 20th century Prophet brought and people have issues with that but bar is first then Isaac because when Isa come it shuts the mouth of the critics that is what that is about when the manifestation comes it shut the MTH of the critics they say we we don't a prophesy but the Bible said in R 10811 don't almost prophesy again we only prophesy because the time is not yet once it is manifested then we don't to prophesy anymore we say this day this script is fulfilled all right just about two more and me close Mary Mary and Joseph Joseph Mary is showing pregnant and she's not married and she's holding on to God's promise and he said they could see Joseph say people saying you're Maring a prostitute remember adultery was debt in those days and you know God was dealing with him Mary know that the word was written the angel spoke to her the Holy Spirit come down and never spoke to the whole congregation here we go he spoke to them so sometimes what God is speaking is not to everyone what is speaking to you a virgin shall conceive and be a child Joseph know that right Joseph looked and before the angel visit him and said I love her I'm a righteous man I can't marry a woman like that but the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream Joseph thought son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which has conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit what a comfort so Mary on her Road people laughing people mocking but they don't know the scriptures Shea go and hide in her room and say oh God I can't take it no more I ain't going nowhere no no no she has to have normal living because the Bible said a virgin shall conceive all right so when the angel appeared to Mary oh sh these things be see I know not a man he said the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you that Holy thing will be born in you will be called The Son of God what about the bride today the secret is what the word is in the bride the word is in you you like a dry seed waiting for the upper room uh experience or The Upper Room Dynamics or The Upper Room Marine which will bring your seed to life so the scuffers name scuff that I'm carrying and here's the problem as we close he said the people are always trying to manufacture something so because they don't want to be a reproach they have to manufacture all kind of stuff to make it appear to be bride inverted comment bride um you know and manufacture they come like they say every Revival have his own songs so as long as the church produces songs that the bright songs and so on so they have bright songs and you know this is the Bride is a bride is a bride but in the real evidence or confirmation of the prophet's prophecy it is not there so we don't want to manufacture anything that doesn't make any sense he says the Sheep doesn't manufacture W no the Sheep Bears will we are not called to manufacture the fruit of the spirits we are called to Bear the fruit of the spirit the Sheep produce wo because what is on the inside so God by predestination calls who he will he gives the kingdom whoever who desires to give it to as we close God remember remembered Rachel God hearkened to her and opened her womb and she conceived and be a son and said God had taken away my reproach and call his name Joseph and the bride day will produce a son do the perfection even Christ that Perfection will be produced by an end time BR God will take away your reproach our reproach the bride reproved and I think the last one I want to the Bible talk about Abram as the end skip that Hannah Hannah is an interesting case because she was mocked she was scuffed at she was ridicule she was barring but like us here tonight she was praying Eli came out he thought he was drunk she say I'm not drunk I'm praying that God would take away my reproach he said the Lord God grant the thy request now here this part this is beautiful God could have placed little Samuel right in Hannah's arm all of us knows that he's the creator of all things just it into existence he could have put it right in Hannah's arms but instead of doing that it was the regular procedure n months before the little baby come he could have done it instantly but he didn't do it instantly if he give her the promise and she but and she inherit he just give her the promise and she inherited the promise here we go now Church hope you get this tonight if what God promis you he give you instantly you have no reproach to go through or give the Lord some Praises I want you to think about that tonight if what God promised you he give you as an instant you have no reproach to go to but he set it up that way that you have a reproach to go through a reproach of baress scess of baress and after you go through that reproach you inherit the promise and Hannah is that Tye oh praise the Lord oh give the Lord some Praises tonight thank you Jesus thank you Jesus so God when he give them the land he said it's a good land I give you this this is yours but you have to deal with the Hittites and the jeites and the parasites and you have to drive them out so friends I want to encourage you tonight don't sweat it with the reproach of the word don't sweat it for people criticizing laughing and mocking your face clean and they want to say you know do this put on a lipstick put this put this and just smile nicely and say thank you but no thanks that is not how I want to be I choose this Ro they laugh and Mock and scuff let them laugh you may feel bad because you have to learn to uh how to say you have to learn to understand what this is in bearing this Repro and accept this Repro Peter after fighting with Christ or working with Christ and tting out devils and so on when it come to Gethsemane when it comes to the cross and Jesus dying Peter denied Christ and he was ashamed he was embarrassed and he could remember in his mind Jesus said after he converted St the he had to be a reproach and how sheepishly Peter must have come in the upper room you know embarrassed of his behavior but he was human he was a normal man and he has to go through his stuff and yet he was under a promise of the Holy Ghost we tonight are under a promise we refuse to accept anything less than what God promised for this hour we refuse to accept less than the same page the Peter had and all of them had I as your pastor refuse to accept that it's just church and just talk and just text and just sharing stuff and whatnot I believe in my heart as the heart pant after the water we have to pant after God I believe with all my heart that we are called to thirst after God I believe with all my heart we have to call to thirst after righteousness and to Bear the reproach of his word so what is for prayer tonight Lord take away my reproach of barness I want a living faith a living virtue I want living knowledge living Temperance living patience living confidence living brotherly kindness I want charity I want Christ life to be ooen out of me I don't just want to be a church member I want to be a manifested word believer let's B hands heavenly father I thank you tonight it was so exciting Lord to come with this word reproach God God has taken away my reproach and this word tonight is prophetic oh God that it will happen and here it is tonight we're going to ask you to come Lord and cleanse our hearts our minds like Daniel oh God we have become a reproach to the people people are saying where is the power where is your god where is this so-called super church and super race where is all of that and here we are we have to preach it believe it acknowledge it speak it and wait for it while the world mocks while church member laugh while those who are proud and arrogant and ady and highminded and whatever they carry on in their own world but here it is we believe your promise father as the people get on in pray tonight may you visit them with power visit them with presence visit them with Revelation visit them with understanding visit them with knowledge you said my people perish because of lack of knowledge Lord not tonight L let anyone perish tonight may they understand there's a true reproach of the word that we are called to bear and we are called to not to stay and say Lord I just have a reproach of the word no but to cry out Lord take away this reproach I want to honor you I want to bring glory to you I want your spirit to be magnified in and through my life I don't want me I want less of me and more of you I don't want my will and my way I want your way and your will oh God come tonight and honor your people Lord and they get on in prayer in Jesus I ask it amen God bless you thanks again for

struggles you know the battles father but you call us to walk in this hour you call us as elected ones chosen for the foundation of the world to walk through hell and Earth Lord and we thank you for keeping us and preserving us all these years oh God yeah in year old trial testings oh God it doesn't matter father but you have kept us is your word have kept us Lord your love has kept us your Grace has kept us and we keep keeping on Lord oh God you promise in your word when the enemy come like a flood the spirit to raise the standard raise a stand tonight in every heart in every life raise a stand tonight in the parents struggling with their children we understand with the challenges that the parents face husband and wife what what they face the single Lord the singles Lord Jesus what they face and each individual the trials that they face we know as we say and often that golad is coming Lord each one of their golad whether it's sickness whether is oh God job related whether it's family related it doesn't matter but everybody have their Philistine to deal with know God help us tonight to recognize Lord that you have put the word in US you have put the Sword and the Shi shield and the helmet and all the equipment is Le in your word that we can dress ourselves with blessed service is coming Sunday father may your presence p in a mighty mighty way bless bless the youth service tomorrow father God may your visit young people in special all those who make it out Lord oh God we ask that you touch them in a special way in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen praise the Lord God bless you again thank you again for being here tonight want to remind you about the youth service tomorrow all is in invited even though you're not young you want to come and pray and you want to come and give support but more importantly there are things that you could always learn you know sometimes the young people see us older ones as if we were born old as we were never young the reality is we were young and many times in marriage in homes in family in parenting there was there's no school of parenting there's no school of marriage and all parents and families and families around do the best that they can with the tools that they have and sometimes as you grow older you begin to learn stuff that you wish you knew when you were much younger so sometimes the empowerment is not just for the young people but the empowerment is also for the older ones that they could Empower their children or grandchildren or other young people that they will encounter in life not because you're old you only meeting old people but you might be older but you might meet young people how do you relate to them how do you connect to them how do you communicate with them and all of this is part of the package that helps us to be who we are and how we can effectively help our people so pray and if you could come out and make it up do come out and give support and and if you want to be able to in a position to to support and encourage a young man a young woman young son or young daughter going through life trials and they are facing things that we ourselves at at that age did not face and they have to face it and we want to give them their support to encourage them that they can make it so may God bless you thanks again for being here tonight and I love and appreciate you God bless
