[54:31] you don't have to find it we talk about
[54:33] Cornelius a devout man feared God he had
[54:36] a vision and he got he was noted but God
[54:40] said thy prayers and thine arms are come
[54:42] for Memorial before God so this man
[54:44] wasn't a Believer he wasn't a Jew he
[54:46] wasn't a Christian but God saw his heart
[54:50] God saw the kind of person he was and
[54:52] God say I hear your prayer now send to
[54:55] Jer and call for Simon so then Peter and
[54:58] so on like that but the part I want to
[55:00] get to is Peter part so the god working
[55:04] on both sides because that's what God
[55:06] have to do not one side both sides so
[55:09] God speak to to Cornelius and here it is
[55:11] God is dealing with Peter so on the
[55:13] tomorrow as they went up to the journey
[55:15] jight to the city Peter was up and
[55:16] housed up to pray about the sixth hour
[55:20] so Peter is in a praying praying
[55:22] atmosphere he became very hungry and he
[55:24] didn't cuss his wife he didn't argue and
[55:26] fuss and Carry On and because she didn't
[55:28] cook food on time and he was very hungry
[55:30] and would have eaten but while they made
[55:32] ready he fell into a trance this is the
[55:35] part I want to get to and saw heaven
[55:38] open and certain vessel descended unto
[55:40] him as had been a great sheet ning Four
[55:43] Corners let down on the earth wherein
[55:45] were all manner of four-footed beasts of
[55:47] the earth and wild beasts and creeping
[55:50] things and Falls of the and the voice to
[55:52] him said rise Peter kill and eat now
[55:55] this is God
[55:56] speaking this is Peter registering
[56:00] something that he not accustomed with he
[56:01] not handling at all God tell him rise
[56:03] and eat and said no no no no no no not
[56:06] not working so could you imagine that I
[56:08] trying to show you how you have to come
[56:10] separate sometimes from your own
[56:11] feelings and your emotion about things
[56:15] this is resident in Peter about not
[56:17] eating this sort what he called unclean
[56:20] hear what God Said hear what Peter said
[56:22] but Peter said not so Lord can you
[56:25] imagine that could you imagine some
[56:27] telling God not so not so not so not not
[56:29] so Lord for I have never eaten anything
[56:33] that is common or unclean and the voice
[56:36] speak unto him the second time what God
[56:39] had cleansed that call not thou common
[56:43] this was done three times and the vessel
[56:46] was rece him so God dropped something in
[56:48] him challenged but even his
[56:50] senses challenge his feelings that's why
[56:53] you have to separate your feelings and
[56:55] emotions from from your feet he
[56:57] challenged it and said this don't do
[56:59] that yet Peter don't know what going to
[57:01] unfold right as the sheet went up Peter
[57:03] doubted in himself that this Vision that
[57:05] he had seen should mean behold men were
[57:07] from Cornelius had made inquiry for
[57:09] Simon's house and called and ask Simon
[57:12] who said was Peter while Peter taught on
[57:14] div Vision so he doesn't know what going
[57:16] on just yet the spirit said unto him
[57:20] behold three men seek thee arise
[57:24] therefore get thee down
[57:26] go with them doubting nothing for I have
[57:32] sent them so even though it's not your
[57:35] normal routine even though it's not your
[57:37] normal environment even though it's what
[57:39] you didn't really expect I have sent
[57:42] them don't doubt believe isn't that
[57:46] right and Peter went down to the men
[57:48] which before con said behold I am he
[57:50] whom you seek what is the cause whereof
[57:52] you are come and they said Cornelius
[57:56] the Centurion a just man one that fearth
[58:00] God and of good report among all the
[58:01] nations of the Jews was warned by God by
[58:04] Holy Angel to send for thee into his
[58:06] house and to hear words of thee so Peter
[58:09] know this is a God thing now because now
[58:12] he hearing out that this he was sent to
[58:14] hear words Peter don't even know what
[58:16] words he going to speak yet and I'm
[58:18] going to stop right there so I want to
[58:20] show you I want to prove to you that you
[58:22] have to put your feelings and emotions
[58:24] on one side if your feelings don't want
[58:27] to come to church let your feelings stay
[58:28] home and you come to church if your
[58:30] emotions want to stay tell your emotions
[58:32] is a lie I am here to be blessed I'm
[58:35] here to be delivered I'm here to be
[58:36] healed I'm here to get free I'm here to
[58:39] break out and break through you don't
[58:41] know what God will do this morning
[58:43] praise the name of the Lord praise God
[58:45] Amen all right so a quote I want to get
[58:48] you now there something I read yesterday
[58:50] I F that to bring it back the trying of
[58:52] your faith work at patience there's
[58:55] absolutely no way in which to gain
[58:57] patience it has to come by the trial of
[59:00] our faith trial of what shout out faith
[59:04] and God had to try that a faith that
[59:07] cannot be tried cannot be trusted so if
[59:10] God gave you a faith you have to try
[59:11] that to qualify that faith it could be
[59:14] trusted faith faith that could stand
[59:17] amen hallelujah a man have faith and Fa
[59:19] when he test come he fall down that know
[59:21] faith that is hope faith does stand when
[59:24] the test come so when God dropped faith
[59:27] on Abraham he gave her 25 years to try
[59:29] that oh give the Lord a shout he put
[59:32] time on faith so you can one Faith now
[59:34] now Faith is but God has tried that now
[59:37] Faith is oh give the Lord some Praises
[59:40] are you with me now tribulation work at
[59:42] patience you can't say God give me
[59:44] patience give me quick
[59:47] tribulation work at patience so when you
[59:50] want patience to work tribulation is the
[59:52] key for that Hallelujah he say Lord give
[59:54] me patience God I sending tribulation
[59:55] for right away see how the amens
[59:58] disappear I sending tribulation to
[1:00:00] because tribulation has worked this
[1:00:01] thing called patience and let patience
[1:00:03] have its perfect work Hallelujah that
[1:00:06] you may be perfect and entire lacking
[1:00:08] nothing are you ready God's will for us
[1:00:11] is perfection and that Perfection is
[1:00:14] patience I'm not hearing you you have to
[1:00:17] say Amen to this you know we're not
[1:00:18] imagining things you know this is the
[1:00:20] real deal this not Kentucky Fried
[1:00:22] Chicken and the other kind of chicken
[1:00:24] the half gospel this not this
[1:00:26] God's will for us is perfection and
[1:00:29] Perfection is patience waiting on God
[1:00:32] and waiting for
[1:00:37] God so anytime God drops something on
[1:00:40] you he put time on it to see your
[1:00:42] behavior and See your action like we say
[1:00:44] if God told Abram 25 years get that
[1:00:46] child you know AB go go and drunk for
[1:00:48] the whole 24 years drinking he partying
[1:00:51] and in 25th years he chps in back into
[1:00:53] church this is year this is the of
[1:00:58] Jubilee but that but that is not going
[1:01:00] to be our testimony Our Testimony he was
[1:01:03] the father of Fai and the Bible said he
[1:01:05] staggered not at the promise of God true
[1:01:08] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[1:01:11] glory to God and he was fully persuaded
[1:01:14] that what God promised he was able to
[1:01:17] perform are you fully persuaded this
[1:01:18] morning God could deliver your husband
[1:01:20] your wife your children your family God
[1:01:22] could deliver you God could fill you
[1:01:23] with the Holy Ghost God could do more
[1:01:25] abundantly that you can ever ask or
[1:01:27] think hey give the Lord a shout is it
[1:01:30] this is the place to
[1:01:32] shout hallelujah hallelujah all right
[1:01:35] almost done I'm not the preacher this
[1:01:37] morning the preacher is here all right
[1:01:39] waiting on God and waiting for God that
[1:01:43] is where time comes in waiting on and
[1:01:47] waiting for on and for you're waiting on
[1:01:51] God to get clearance to do what you
[1:01:54] think or you feel God want want you to
[1:01:56] do now if you don't have the time I
[1:01:58] wrote this and patience you run ahead
[1:02:01] and get burned and you will get burned
[1:02:03] to learn time waiting listen is the
[1:02:08] means by which this process of character
[1:02:12] development takes place but abah said
[1:02:14] these words talk about waiting on God
[1:02:15] and waiting for God this is the process
[1:02:18] of character
[1:02:19] development we're going to play
[1:02:21] something the process of character
[1:02:23] development takes time amen
[1:02:26] and that's is why the Pentecostals fail
[1:02:28] they failing up to now because it didn't
[1:02:30] take the word to be tested to get
[1:02:32] corrupted many were loaded with loot
[1:02:34] money big churches mega churches 30,000
[1:02:37] people in the church and whatnot and
[1:02:38] feeling and falling on like
[1:02:40] flies because they didn't go through
[1:02:42] this thing called
[1:02:44] character you don't know what God have
[1:02:46] why you go through what you go through
[1:02:49] but ask yourself what does God see that
[1:02:51] I don't see then I want to trust him
[1:02:55] Hallelujah
[1:03:00] so I want to invite my friend from
[1:03:02] Grenada to come and Minister the word

[1:07:07] father almighty
[1:07:10] God it's a privilege to stand
[1:07:13] here before your
[1:07:15] people and to offer a
[1:07:19] prayers into your holy presence I'm not
[1:07:22] worthy Lord so we sang the Lord song
[1:07:26] Amazing
[1:07:28] Grace Lord sometimes we're tempted to
[1:07:31] look behind and see where we came
[1:07:34] from so that we could remain
[1:07:37] grounded and not get lifted
[1:07:40] up cuz when I look around Lord I see
[1:07:43] myself like
[1:07:44] job and then I Repent in dust and Ashes
[1:07:48] and I said oh God be
[1:07:51] merciful merciful to me and your people
[1:07:55] and I ask for Mercy because when you get
[1:07:57] when you send Mercy you send Grace and
[1:08:00] when you send Grace you send a message
[1:08:03] and that's why we are here to he amen I
[1:08:06] don't have a message I cannot have a
[1:08:08] message but it is your word and I'm
[1:08:11] grateful that you can use us not to
[1:08:14] bring our message but to Echo your word
[1:08:18] amen and therefore may you find me empty
[1:08:22] willing and submissive and if there's
[1:08:25] anything in me that will hinder that I
[1:08:28] beg you and I give you the right to move
[1:08:32] it and I said Lord empty me so the
[1:08:36] people would not see me but that they
[1:08:39] will see your word they will hear your
[1:08:42] word and it's funny that the brother was
[1:08:45] speaking about faith and that's what we
[1:08:47] want to talk about this morning Faith
[1:08:51] Lord many people think they have faith
[1:08:54] when it's really hope
[1:08:55] hope and what we want Lord is to peel
[1:08:58] back
[1:08:59] everything break the bir to get to the
[1:09:03] Kel so that we can get a true
[1:09:07] picture of who and what we are so that
[1:09:11] we can get up and get busy and keep
[1:09:15] pressing because the hour is late so
[1:09:18] have your own way and this beautiful
[1:09:21] people that you have here this morning
[1:09:23] in this wonderful place that is a house
[1:09:26] of prayer hallu and we thank you that
[1:09:28] the days are over when it used to be a
[1:09:30] den of Thieves now it's a place of
[1:09:34] worship it's a place of worship where we
[1:09:36] come and we hallowed thy name that you
[1:09:40] can speak to us cuz if you don't speak
[1:09:42] we might as well close our books and go
[1:09:45] home cuz our words does not give virtue
[1:09:49] but your
[1:09:50] words even if it is not spoken it is
[1:09:54] amazing much less when it is spoken he
[1:09:56] says it's spirit and it is life so I beg
[1:10:01] you and I plead with you to speak to
[1:10:05] us we will hear and soften our hearts
[1:10:10] that the word will not just be for
[1:10:12] hearing but be for
[1:10:14] doing and we will not forget I

[1:12:55] the easy path which is the word and if
[1:12:59] you don't mind turn with me to
[1:13:01] Philippians chapter
[1:13:07] 2 and it's good to be back
[1:13:15] here I was just telling brother over day
[1:13:18] I've seen
[1:13:19] growth almost can recognize it feels
[1:13:23] like a cathedral
[1:13:26] it's big
[1:13:28] nice oh
[1:13:31] boy
[1:13:32] Philippians it's right before Colossians
[1:13:36] and if you can get chapter two I'll be
[1:13:39] happy and we will read our first
[1:13:42] scripture I'm a big believer in the
[1:13:45] word verse five amen amen and let's read
[1:13:51] it help me read you know help me read
[1:13:55] and may the Lord bless the reading of
[1:13:57] the word to our hearts father God let it
[1:14:00] multiply like bread in Jesus name amen
[1:14:04] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:14:08] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[1:14:12] God taught it not robbery to be equal
[1:14:17] with God but made himself of no
[1:14:20] reputation pause a minute that means it
[1:14:23] was not self-centered or
[1:14:26] self-oriented let's continue and took
[1:14:28] upon him the form of a servant not the
[1:14:32] master a form of a servant and was made
[1:14:35] in the likeness of men and being found
[1:14:38] in fashion as a man he humbled himself
[1:14:43] pause these days men are being found in
[1:14:46] a fashion resembling a gr God I hope I
[1:14:49] don't offend you I I'm a preacher that
[1:14:52] speak what the Lord give me so if you
[1:14:55] just get offended just don't take it
[1:14:59] on all right so you have a lot of men
[1:15:01] who are grown gods they don't know Jesus
[1:15:04] came and humbled himself as a man and
[1:15:06] that is our example and he humbled
[1:15:09] himself as a man and was found in a
[1:15:11] fashion resembling what he says but
[1:15:14] Jesus humbled himself and became what
[1:15:17] obedient obedient follows humility you
[1:15:20] can you can be obedient if you're not
[1:15:23] humble cuz when we when we fell we got
[1:15:26] we took on an ego when man fell he took
[1:15:29] on an ego and that ego was from the
[1:15:31] Beast because he had to prove that he is
[1:15:34] right even though he born wrong and he
[1:15:37] has to make himself what he's
[1:15:39] not but once you go down into humility
[1:15:44] obedience
[1:15:45] follows
[1:15:47] amen it follows and it can't go wrong
[1:15:50] because if Jesus is the example that's
[1:15:53] what we follow and watch The Obedience
[1:15:55] follows and this is something I don't
[1:15:57] know if you have a problem with it's not
[1:15:58] obedience to be a nice guy but obedience
[1:16:01] to
[1:16:03] death and the death is the death of the
[1:16:06] self you see God showing us the way once
[1:16:09] you come into him you have to make some
[1:16:11] changes you had to make some changes so
[1:16:14] he became humble and that's the first
[1:16:15] thing that's why Deuteronomy says if my
[1:16:17] people which are called by my name shall
[1:16:20] humble themselves and you can't just get
[1:16:22] humble just so you can't just walk out
[1:16:24] and say I'm going to be humbled
[1:16:26] today see you have to come under the
[1:16:29] approach you have to come under where
[1:16:30] the word is cuz Jesus as you as you saw
[1:16:34] he did not think it robbery to be equal
[1:16:38] and in that he humbled himself as a man
[1:16:42] and we have to Humble ourselves unto
[1:16:45] death amen and our death itself his
[1:16:48] death was to the
[1:16:50] Cross Amen on the death of the Cross
[1:16:53] wherefore God also had highly exalted
[1:16:57] him see it after death you must
[1:17:00] rise if you don't rise then die double
[1:17:04] dead are you following me and you don't
[1:17:07] want to be dead and then go UND dead
[1:17:09] again you want to dead and come
[1:17:12] up I don't care what you do with my body
[1:17:14] I I got to make sure I can come many
[1:17:17] people take a lot of money well make
[1:17:19] sure you do this and some burn and some
[1:17:21] this and that but that don't mean you
[1:17:22] coming up Jesus was hum humbled to
[1:17:26] obedience unto death and then God raised
[1:17:29] him up and if you want to be in the
[1:17:32] resurrection and the Holy Ghost is the
[1:17:35] the what you would call the fouraste of
[1:17:37] the Resurrection for God to raise you up
[1:17:40] then you have to go through this
[1:17:42] process amen and then what what he did
[1:17:45] he gave him a name and a name that is
[1:17:49] above every name amen hallelujah and he
[1:17:54] says there reputation no matter what you
[1:17:56] all right give him a name wherefore God
[1:17:59] also highly exalt him and given him a
[1:18:01] name and a man's name is his
[1:18:05] reputation no matter what you say and
[1:18:07] what people say those things cannot
[1:18:09] erase your
[1:18:11] reputation because your name carries
[1:18:14] your reputation you just had to say your
[1:18:15] name and it works and it brings your
[1:18:17] life so there is no name on Earth
[1:18:20] different that's why dying to self is
[1:18:23] not an option towards eternal life and
[1:18:27] this name God gave him Jesus in which
[1:18:31] every knee shall bow of things in heaven
[1:18:34] and of things on earth and of things
[1:18:37] under the end you can have your
[1:18:40] [Music]
[1:18:41] seat amen but I will continue reading in
[1:18:45] Romans 10 from verse
[1:18:48] 8 but what
[1:18:50] said it the word is nigh thee even in
[1:18:55] thy mouth and in thy heart that is the
[1:18:59] word of faith which we preach that if
[1:19:02] Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[1:19:04] Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thy
[1:19:07] heart that God had raised him from the
[1:19:10] dead only person who could Raise You
[1:19:13] When God raises you from being dead to
[1:19:16] the flesh Thou shalt be save amen amen
[1:19:21] for with the heart man believeth on unto
[1:19:25] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:19:27] confession is made unto salvation for
[1:19:30] the scripture said whosoever believeth
[1:19:33] on him shall not be
[1:19:35] ashamed now I want to skip to verse 14
[1:19:38] but then how shall they call on him in
[1:19:41] whom they have not believed and how
[1:19:45] shall they believe in whom they have not
[1:19:48] heard and then how shall they hear
[1:19:52] without a preacher
[1:19:55] and watch this and how shall the
[1:19:57] preacher preach except he is sent by
[1:20:04] God now don't take this
[1:20:07] light except he is sent by God but they
[1:20:11] have not all obeyed the gospel for
[1:20:14] Isaiah said Lord who hath believed our
[1:20:18] message our report so then faith in God
[1:20:22] not by God but in God cometh by what
[1:20:26] hearing the word of God which is
[1:20:29] preached amen so if any preacher come
[1:20:33] and does not preach the word of God he
[1:20:35] was not sent by God and today we find an
[1:20:39] abnormaly where the sent preachers are
[1:20:43] by and large
[1:20:44] rejected while those who came on their
[1:20:47] own knowledge and esteem have the larger
[1:20:50] groups and people follow them as it was
[1:20:54] done in Jesus Jesus day it cannot change
[1:20:57] so this morning we want to be identified
[1:21:00] in the likeness of this Jesus that he
[1:21:04] just read about and to do so we would
[1:21:07] look into the mirror of his
[1:21:09] word amen and then we will see ourselves
[1:21:13] as genuine Holy Ghost L Believers or we
[1:21:16] will see ourselves as adversaries not
[1:21:20] having faith in God's word I'm still in
[1:21:24] the Bible Hebrews 3 verse 7 wherefore as
[1:21:28] the Holy Ghost said today if you will
[1:21:32] hear his voice by who the preachers that
[1:21:36] were sent Harden not your heart as in
[1:21:40] the provocation in the day of Temptation
[1:21:44] in the wilderness I always like to call
[1:21:47] that in the while when your fathers
[1:21:50] tempted me and proved me and saw my work
[1:21:55] 40 years wherefore I was grieved with
[1:21:59] that generation and said they do always
[1:22:03] air in their
[1:22:05] mouth in their head in their
[1:22:10] hearts and they have not known my ways
[1:22:14] so I swore in my wrath see what you have
[1:22:18] now God getting angry because of
[1:22:22] unbelief and because of not receiving
[1:22:24] the ministers or the word that he sent
[1:22:27] through them you now have God a god of
[1:22:30] wrath not the god of your mind but who
[1:22:33] he is because he saying I have sent your
[1:22:36] word and you show off on it you turn
[1:22:38] your back on it you treat it so so
[1:22:42] ordinary when it is God himself using
[1:22:46] man to speak to you cuz if he came
[1:22:49] himself you'd be
[1:22:52] dead cuz you can't handle him
[1:22:55] he did it with Israel and they said no
[1:22:57] don't let God speak cuz even a dog would
[1:23:00] die if it touched the mountain where he
[1:23:04] was and they said we don't want God to
[1:23:06] speak too much people dying let Moses
[1:23:09] speak but it didn't change their
[1:23:11] unbelief cuz when Moses spoke they take
[1:23:14] up Stone to Stone him so what I am here
[1:23:17] to tell you this morning unbelief is a
[1:23:19] terrible thing and it is a deep thing
[1:23:22] and many people take it for for granted
[1:23:25] and not realizing that our behavior is
[1:23:27] connected to either Faith or
[1:23:36] unbelief now watch this here when your
[1:23:39] father's tempted me and proved me and
[1:23:42] saw my Works two years 10 years how is
[1:23:46] it people can watch God working in their
[1:23:50] midst this is not a brother you know
[1:23:52] this is not a pope you know this God and
[1:23:54] for 40 years from year
[1:23:57] one to year
[1:23:59] 40 no
[1:24:04] change just the same Mary go around the
[1:24:08] mberry
[1:24:10] bush just going wrong and wrong you're
[1:24:13] not here for
[1:24:15] that God bring you here to change and
[1:24:18] when you don't change you make God as if
[1:24:20] he cannot do
[1:24:22] nothing it's a grief to
[1:24:25] him and the ministers are laboring
[1:24:27] sweating and you are laughing
[1:24:33] playing but it does not go like that
[1:24:37] because I'll tell you what happened to
[1:24:38] those who provoked him it's actually a
[1:24:42] provocation you actually brother Theo
[1:24:45] didn't get up on there and say you know
[1:24:46] what I'm going to do this something pull
[1:24:48] him something let him I didn't I was in
[1:24:52] the world
[1:24:55] and something brought me
[1:24:57] here something bigger than
[1:25:00] me something brought you here there's
[1:25:03] many people in the world would like to
[1:25:05] church places with you and cannot CU
[1:25:08] they're lost they're
[1:25:11] blind he brought you here but not to be
[1:25:15] out much of the same don't change your
[1:25:18] clothes and be the same change your
[1:25:20] clothes on your heart
[1:25:31] and this Hood me 40 years from one year
[1:25:36] to the 40th year a
[1:25:39] generation and God there with them
[1:25:42] worked with them had patience with them
[1:25:46] where are the people 2.5
[1:25:50] million listen they they're not seeing
[1:25:53] you know some kind of picture you know
[1:25:55] they seeing the pill of
[1:25:57] fire they're hearing the tunder of God
[1:26:00] they see The Works he said my
[1:26:04] works for 40
[1:26:06] years what have you done with it well to
[1:26:10] whom much is given much is required it's
[1:26:13] good to follow the message and say where
[1:26:15] you going to church I'm going by so and
[1:26:16] I'm going by so and according to if that
[1:26:18] God sent that man you have more to given
[1:26:20] account for it's not going to be a walk
[1:26:22] in the back amen you don't see it now
[1:26:26] because God have what
[1:26:28] patience you think you have patience you
[1:26:31] want to learn about patience check
[1:26:33] him because you cannot have patience
[1:26:35] unless you are
[1:26:37] tried you don't bring out patience
[1:26:40] unless people are provoking
[1:26:43] you I don't have to produce patience if
[1:26:46] I'm cool and calm and collected it's
[1:26:48] when I'm tried it's when I'm tested it's
[1:26:51] when I'm provoked to act
[1:26:55] can I take this
[1:27:01] off it's provoking
[1:27:08] me so you don't need patience when all
[1:27:11] is well a husband don't need patience
[1:27:14] with a wife that is just wonderful he
[1:27:16] needs patience with the wife that is
[1:27:18] going to give him some
[1:27:20] stress and we never marry the person
[1:27:23] that is going to be
[1:27:25] nice we always marry the person that
[1:27:28] knows how to touch the
[1:27:30] button that knows how to make us say
[1:27:33] things we normally in fact make us
[1:27:39] speak we don't marry the person that you
[1:27:41] know we just move in and walk out and we
[1:27:44] marry the person that gets our attention
[1:27:47] and God does this amazing mystery bring
[1:27:50] them together it's like a battery
[1:27:52] positive and negative both are charge
[1:27:57] yes sir and if you want that car work
[1:27:59] you had to put the place you had to put
[1:28:01] the pole in the right
[1:28:04] place otherwise you have problems you
[1:28:06] have a life battery but you have Sparks
[1:28:10] fire
[1:28:12] explosion so when a man that is married
[1:28:15] to a wife learns how to handle that
[1:28:18] you'll find the car working nice but
[1:28:20] every day you had to remember his pole
[1:28:22] is right and how Paul is
[1:28:28] left cuz if he if you forget and put it
[1:28:31] the wrong place she will test his
[1:28:36] patience and then God gave the wife the
[1:28:39] right
[1:28:40] man so all how I talking to you and
[1:28:45] answering you're that
[1:28:47] dummy but that man know if he answer you
[1:28:52] dead so he had a learn patience that's
[1:28:55] when I learn patience when I got married
[1:28:58] later
[1:29:00] on so what I'm saying is God tested them
[1:29:04] for 40 years and patience it took him to
[1:29:09] not wipe them
[1:29:11] out listen God is not your grandfather
[1:29:14] in God is not your uncle in God is a
[1:29:17] consuming fire and he can't change he
[1:29:19] said Moses careful how you're going with
[1:29:22] me didn't not no game
[1:29:25] when he came down to kill all of them
[1:29:26] MOS say wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:29:28] wait I'm in a normal place but still if
[1:29:30] you go and do that they're going to say
[1:29:31] we take them out and kill them you say
[1:29:34] hey I hear what you're saying but all
[1:29:37] them men who have seen my works and
[1:29:39] tested me and prove me I know what going
[1:29:41] to undo with them but according to your
[1:29:44] word not
[1:29:46] mine your word I want to show you I'm
[1:29:50] exercising patience even for you
[1:29:54] yeah it don't mean go change but I just
[1:29:58] giving you some
[1:29:59] slacks so you would see I was not
[1:30:03] wrong God never
[1:30:05] wrong never
[1:30:09] wrong so he had to teach us by
[1:30:13] patience so he tell Moses I know your
[1:30:16] nose is long as mine yet but it's come
[1:30:18] you come
[1:30:19] in and Moses was given an opportunity to
[1:30:22] come around and when they talk to him
[1:30:24] now and we want water
[1:30:27] water something that is a
[1:30:29] right Moses called them
[1:30:32] Rebels shall I go and bring water for
[1:30:35] you
[1:30:36] too and God who had told him
[1:30:39] speak he put that same God aside and in
[1:30:42] his moment of testing patience left him
[1:30:45] patience walk out the house
[1:30:50] tiptoeing and Moses forget who he was he
[1:30:54] was
[1:30:56] God and he should have been exercising
[1:30:58] what the same patience God showed him
[1:31:02] but he lost his ability to stay and
[1:31:04] function right his P
[1:31:09] cross and he hit the water The
[1:31:12] Rock and hear what God because he's God
[1:31:15] he sent it God has give you what you
[1:31:18] wanted even if he bring you in a
[1:31:22] crush little piece of tissue even if he
[1:31:26] break you in a crash he just do strange
[1:31:30] things and he hit the rock water gushed
[1:31:33] out hello and they
[1:31:36] drank and they fell good and when
[1:31:39] everything settled down God riding I me
[1:31:42] know you come come come come
[1:31:45] come what happened here God always has
[1:31:49] come you tell Adam and Eve what to do
[1:31:52] they did their own thing and God right
[1:31:54] in hey come give an account of your
[1:31:56] stship what went on here we are so slack
[1:32:00] in these ages and in these times we let
[1:32:02] anything
[1:32:03] fall God help those ministers to let
[1:32:05] anything fall you better keep that ship
[1:32:07] straight cuz you had to give God an
[1:32:09] account you may not be popular but I
[1:32:11] rather be unpopular with man and be
[1:32:13] popular with
[1:32:15] God

[1:32:19] Hallelujah now even if you clap that
[1:32:21] don't put me out cuzz I already have
[1:32:23] confirmation from above even if you say
[1:32:26] Amen it don't put me out night cuz I
[1:32:28] have confirmation from above what I am
[1:32:31] trying to get you to do is recognize as
[1:32:33] your pastor just said don't be emotional
[1:32:36] don't hear message emotional deal with
[1:32:38] the truth is it the
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:41] truth and if it's the truth say Amen
[1:32:44] even if it's drun in you God going to
[1:32:47] try his hand and pick you

[1:33:41] years I don't want God to be grieve with
[1:33:44] me not even for one
[1:33:46] year he was griev with them for 40 years
[1:33:50] and what miss you you know it there's a
[1:33:52] stat in in grenade that easy everybody
[1:33:54] know what missed you in past
[1:33:58] you wherefore I was grieved with that
[1:34:00] generation I notice
[1:34:03] generation to Moon guy and said they do
[1:34:07] always air where in their
[1:34:11] hearts God is not so concerned about
[1:34:14] what you have in your head now it's what
[1:34:16] is in your heart cuz the defilement of
[1:34:19] man is not in his head is in his heart
[1:34:23] and the biggest organ in your body is
[1:34:24] your heart not the physical one the
[1:34:28] spiritual one because it's the Bible
[1:34:30] even tells us it's so evil and
[1:34:32] desperately wicked and for it to be
[1:34:34] desperately wicked it's not
[1:34:38] shallow and that is the thing we had to
[1:34:40] deal with from time we born to the time
[1:34:42] we
[1:34:43] leave and they have they do not know my
[1:34:46] ways you come here to learn the ways not
[1:34:49] for you to bring your ways but to drop
[1:34:52] your ways and on his
[1:34:55] always so I swear in my heart they shall
[1:34:59] what
[1:35:00] not you see that not your father can
[1:35:04] help
[1:35:04] you your brother can help you when God
[1:35:08] say
[1:35:08] not is
[1:35:10] not balling in and helping
[1:35:14] you just don't move him heart that move
[1:35:18] him a broken and contrite heart so learn
[1:35:23] move your attention from the eyes and
[1:35:26] the
[1:35:26] head drop it a little lower where you
[1:35:30] have all them
[1:35:31] secrets and all of me sries in church
[1:35:34] you might behave like a priest like a
[1:35:36] saint I don't know what you do home but
[1:35:38] what you do home is what a heart is
[1:35:41] doing when you come to church you might
[1:35:43] put on a hat h a t but when you're home
[1:35:46] the h e t Will Rule and I am trying to
[1:35:50] say we can't fool God we need to get in
[1:35:53] in that genuine
[1:35:58] Faith cuz that God Ain changing you
[1:36:01] might change he remains the same
[1:36:04] yesterday today and forever we could
[1:36:08] handle the forever and we could handle
[1:36:11] yesterday but
[1:36:14] now
[1:36:16] problems so he said lest there be thank
[1:36:19] you in oh that's better in any of you
[1:36:24] and he's not talking to people in the
[1:36:26] world he's talking to Brethren lest
[1:36:30] there be in any of you hello so I swear
[1:36:34] in my there shall not end to take heed
[1:36:36] Brethren not Sinners Brethren lest there
[1:36:39] be in any of you Brethren an evil
[1:36:43] heart of unbelief what does unbelief do
[1:36:47] it brings you away from the Living God
[1:36:50] from the
[1:36:51] word makes you Doty
[1:36:55] are you hearing
[1:36:56] me makes you forget your prayer life
[1:36:59] make you forget
[1:37:01] consecration makes you forget that you
[1:37:03] have to approach God in a certain way
[1:37:05] God is not your
[1:37:08] uncle God is
[1:37:10] Holy
[1:37:13] always
[1:37:15] amen so he says lest there be in you a
[1:37:18] evil heart of unbelief in departing from
[1:37:21] the Living God but exalt
[1:37:24] one another daily while it is called
[1:37:27] today so there's a time when it wouldn't
[1:37:29] be called today let any of you be
[1:37:32] hardened to the deceitfulness of
[1:37:35] unbelief
[1:37:36] sin if it hadn't been for a prophet
[1:37:39] coming we would have still be using the
[1:37:40] word sin but people don't like the word
[1:37:43] unbelief move that away from me I'm a
[1:37:49] Believer
[1:37:50] unbelief that's a a word that tells us
[1:37:54] exactly what character we have and I am
[1:37:57] trying to hear you to tell you this
[1:37:58] morning that your works is your faith or
[1:38:04] attributes of
[1:38:06] unbelief and you can't hide that that
[1:38:09] can't
[1:38:11] hide amen so I'm speaking to you looking
[1:38:14] in the mirror of God's word n your
[1:38:17] mirror cuz some of us are say mirror
[1:38:19] mirror on the wall and just make
[1:38:21] yourself change I ain't like this I
[1:38:22] ain't like that but this
[1:38:25] mirror where is the
[1:38:27] change we will change ourselves in the
[1:38:30] mirror see I like this okay and I put on
[1:38:32] this and so on the real change has to
[1:38:35] come from the mirror of the
[1:38:41] word in the old in the Bible he call
[1:38:43] them open seers full of what dead men
[1:38:47] bones you know who was the best dress in
[1:38:49] them days the
[1:38:50] priests they looked like God they walk
[1:38:53] like God they s like God but they were
[1:38:58] assassinators
[1:39:00] criminals criminals alone that does pay
[1:39:03] to kill a
[1:39:05] man hope I get in
[1:39:08] trouble PID they paid
[1:39:10] $30 to assassinate
[1:39:13] him criminals and Judas was the one that
[1:39:17] collect the money and where was he
[1:39:19] living and living and breeding right in
[1:39:22] Jesus letter

[1:39:39] hide but that is not the way God
[1:39:41] intended it it is a place for you to

[1:39:45] identify with it by touching it all the
[1:39:49] Gory

[1:40:38] unbelief we come with our bags and we
[1:40:41] come with our purse but we don't come
[1:40:43] with our
[1:40:45] heart when you're ready to go to church
[1:40:47] we were doing a check when we were
[1:40:49] coming on and brother Clarence do so I
[1:40:50] said what wrong what wrong he said just
[1:40:52] checking making sure everything
[1:40:55] there and you do that too making sure
[1:40:58] they he some women here so nicely done
[1:41:00] you wonder if they're sleeping sun and
[1:41:02] up so neat but what about the heart what
[1:41:06] about the heart have you checked your
[1:41:08] heart before you came is it in the right
[1:41:13] place who's the last person on your
[1:41:21] mind where am I
[1:41:24] I want you to hold it fast onto the when
[1:41:28] the end not to start but you had to go
[1:41:31] to the end the race is not for the man
[1:41:33] that start many people start race and
[1:41:36] then finish and when they start you
[1:41:38] swear them
[1:41:41] going you don't run out fast you pace
[1:41:46] yourself you said until the end where am
[1:41:48] I where am I until the
[1:41:51] end for some when they had heard did
[1:41:55] provoke
[1:41:57] God imagine you have the adicity and the
[1:42:00] g to provoke God let me make a little
[1:42:03] confession in Grenada we a little
[1:42:05] different to you is a fastpaced life big
[1:42:08] everything big when we watch a store and
[1:42:10] you see the size we like
[1:42:13] oh I mean it's big do you think it's
[1:42:16] only the buildings are
[1:42:18] big the buildings is a is a
[1:42:20] representation of your
[1:42:22] thinking and your mindset and your
[1:42:26] culture
[1:42:27] big hello
[1:42:31] big fancy the
[1:42:34] best I watch your houses and I just want
[1:42:37] to just put this in here and I said
[1:42:40] these people don't know what fear is I'm
[1:42:42] not talking about the fear of God fear
[1:42:44] like General fear like fear we went I
[1:42:46] see 160 m hour wind move my roof we run
[1:42:51] downstairs and you watch the wind coming
[1:42:53] in the form of a man and my daughter is
[1:42:55] saying dad make it stop it sounds like a
[1:42:58] freight train screaming in your
[1:43:01] head and your fear is so profound that
[1:43:05] you you pray to Mary Joseph and the
[1:43:09] rest I was in a house they were pulling
[1:43:12] beads all kind to stink because at that
[1:43:15] time you prove if you know
[1:43:17] God
[1:43:20] fear so when you have fear you have
[1:43:22] humility
[1:43:24] and you think different when you don't
[1:43:27] have fear and you've never been tested
[1:43:29] oh you're big who's going to bring you
[1:43:32] down what's going to happen to you how
[1:43:34] are you going to come down I'm going to
[1:43:35] build bigger bands that's what the rich
[1:43:38] man said I'm going to build bigger bands
[1:43:40] I don't need this man who told me sell
[1:43:42] all that I
[1:43:44] had and come follow me and this man kept
[1:43:48] all the laws The Ten Commandments he
[1:43:50] kept and he ended up in hell
[1:43:53] cuz the Commandments only require
[1:43:57] knowledge what you
[1:43:59] remember having a form of godliness
[1:44:04] where is the power Brother Where is the
[1:44:06] power to keep you
[1:44:10] going some people from this just a
[1:44:12] little thing and they're ready to they
[1:44:18] get why you doing that when you're in
[1:44:21] sining why you only doing now when
[1:44:23] you're under some
[1:44:24] pressure sin Brave and and and be brave
[1:44:28] if you're sinning Brave then be brave
[1:44:30] and the pressure
[1:44:32] Rich are you hearing me but that only
[1:44:34] happens when you're big so I am praying
[1:44:36] Lord don't have mercy I watch your
[1:44:39] houses them EES 4 feet 6 feet outside
[1:44:42] hurricane love
[1:44:45] that it loves it the bigger the E the
[1:44:48] easier the
[1:44:50] LIF and if you had a hurricane and I'm
[1:44:52] not praying it is and just three just a
[1:44:55] size three 95% of your houses I watch
[1:44:59] all of them will not be there and that's
[1:45:03] when you would look up to the sky and
[1:45:06] remember you have a god you not no roof
[1:45:09] again that's when you'll be praying in
[1:45:13] Spanish that's when you'll remember
[1:45:15] every sermon that's when you'll be
[1:45:17] promising God I promise I
[1:45:20] promise God don't need you to promise
[1:45:23] then he needed a promise
[1:45:26] here you got a promise now when it's
[1:45:30] [Music]
[1:45:32] okay because remember A promise is a
[1:45:35] comfort to a what you can't fool
[1:45:38] God you can't fool your own
[1:45:49] self you to bear with
[1:45:51] me all right
[1:45:54] praise
[1:45:56] God so he says so what you do exalt one
[1:46:00] another daily while it is called today
[1:46:04] lest any of you be
[1:46:05] hardened so brother bam said they hard
[1:46:07] there preach the harder they get I watch
[1:46:11] brother sometime preaching and I'm like
[1:46:14] wow and I come this morning expecting
[1:46:16] the podium to be
[1:46:18] full you going to pay this man's sweat
[1:46:22] is nothing in in
[1:46:24] vain and those who probably right now
[1:46:26] making panai panai in Grenada is when
[1:46:29] you have a Sunday to go to church and
[1:46:31] you're going to make
[1:46:32] money we call it
[1:46:34] panai or you have a time and instead of
[1:46:37] doing it all that time you're doing it
[1:46:38] on the day of the Lord when the place
[1:46:40] should be ramram with all the things are
[1:46:43] going on here something is wrong you are
[1:46:45] begging God for
[1:46:49] judgment and that's the wrong time to
[1:46:51] come and make promises
[1:46:53] if you can't do it now tomorrow it will
[1:46:56] be a
[1:46:58] lie you should come now today while it
[1:47:02] is
[1:47:04] today don't be hardened by the
[1:47:06] deceitfulness of sin what causes that
[1:47:09] ver Tim when you lose the fear of God
[1:47:12] you develop
[1:47:14] habits and habits is like the first time
[1:47:17] you you sin and you and you feel you
[1:47:19] feel a little bad and you walk it over
[1:47:22] second time is easier the third time is
[1:47:25] easier after a while is a habit and a
[1:47:28] habit is something so ingrain in you you
[1:47:30] can't just get up and say I drop that
[1:47:32] habit for you to drop that habit the
[1:47:35] doctor had to say if you do that again
[1:47:36] you're
[1:47:39] dead that the only thing we just here
[1:47:42] dead we living in sin we we dying but we
[1:47:46] don't want to
[1:47:49] dead not knowing you are dead while you
[1:47:52] liveing
[1:47:54] wake
[1:48:02] up for we are partakers what's the word
[1:48:05] partakers partakers means I took
[1:48:08] part I didn't come and observe do you
[1:48:10] know how many observers you have in
[1:48:12] Trinidad you're like the
[1:48:14] UN I watch the churches me and my
[1:48:17] brother and he's asking me questions
[1:48:18] about how we all operate and and I have
[1:48:20] no answer I said why you don't know

[1:48:30] telling you what I find I'm only being
[1:48:32] honest and I'm asking myself where the
[1:48:34] Hearts where the
[1:48:36] Hearts where are the
[1:48:39] hearts God is not going to bring me in
[1:48:41] heaven because I know God is going to
[1:48:43] bring me in heaven because he
[1:48:45] knows now what I know is if he knows
[1:48:49] many time you think what you know God
[1:48:51] know hello where is The
[1:48:55] Works Jesus said who can condemn me of
[1:48:58] sin and if you don't believe me check
[1:49:01] the
[1:49:04] works check the works because the works
[1:49:09] identify who I

[1:56:06] them that had
[1:56:07] unbelief whose carcasses fell away do
[1:56:11] you know many people in the message have
[1:56:12] been buried and thinking they're coming
[1:56:15] up because the pastor preach a night
[1:56:18] service and as brother T was saying the
[1:56:20] man had to come and find out who is
[1:56:24] dead when you read the here they
[1:56:27] AIT I don't know how you do it here but
[1:56:29] all criminals in grenade rest in peace

[1:57:06] everything but the wages of sin for the
[1:57:10] wages of sin and I hearing a word get
[1:57:13] some voice for the wages of sin
[1:57:22] and their carcass fell in the wilderness
[1:57:24] so we see are you seeing they could not
[1:57:27] enter in because of unbelief now let's
[1:57:29] look at the other side cuz you have
[1:57:31] people here who really love the Lord

[2:02:27] that R is pointed to the word how dare

[2:02:59] person that hate you bless them that
[2:03:02] hate you that curse you that say all
[2:03:05] manner of evil against you for why that
[2:03:08] is what God does to us he send the Son
[2:03:11] and the rign on the evil and the
[2:03:14] good when you could do Matthew 5 on now
[2:03:19] people don't like Matthew 5
[2:03:22] because like God talking and he
[2:03:25] identifying our ways and they asking him
[2:03:28] questions and he said when you could do
[2:03:30] that then come and talk to
[2:03:34] me amen love joy peace all these
[2:03:38] qualities from God cannot come just so
[2:03:41] adversity brings
[2:03:43] them they are not just so you don't get
[2:03:46] joy just so adversity had to bring some
[2:03:48] sorrow for you to appreciate Joy
[2:03:53] otherwise your joy would be
[2:03:55] shortlived I'm not talking about your
[2:03:57] joy I'm talking about his
[2:03:59] Joy where it say always since God
[2:04:03] brought me back I have never one day
[2:04:05] been I don't know why the right word
[2:04:08] I've been on fire and the fire getting
[2:04:12] hotter now I'm all now
[2:04:17] sad peace
[2:04:20] longsuffering Gent gentleness goodness
[2:04:24] meekness hello
[2:04:27] meekness Temperance controlling the
[2:04:30] tongue controlling the tongue that
[2:04:33] iniquity that fire and then
[2:04:37] Faith Jesus said when I come shall I
[2:04:41] find Faith you think God say that just
[2:04:44] so he saw the generation that when he
[2:04:47] come fit will be very scarce that's
[2:04:52] right unbelief taking over and people
[2:04:56] thinking that they're mared and they're
[2:04:57] going
[2:05:00] along Jesus gave us the best example of
[2:05:03] what we ought to be looking like when he
[2:05:05] rejected his life for us by his word now
[2:05:09] as we go along this life we got to know
[2:05:11] that our character molds the image that
[2:05:13] we are and what we show to others when
[2:05:17] they look at us your image is your
[2:05:20] character your identity
[2:05:22] and who we are so as you so is your
[2:05:27] character amen and it molds or create an
[2:05:30] atmosphere around you amen so when it
[2:05:34] molds that character there are people
[2:05:36] you like being around Believers I'm
[2:05:38] talking hello are you there do your
[2:05:42] answer right well talk to
[2:05:46] me they create an atmosphere that you
[2:05:49] like being around that's Christ
[2:05:52] that not them because when it was us we
[2:05:55] didn't even like we own
[2:05:57] self we have problem with we
[2:06:00] ownself I have found myself saying in
[2:06:02] the past why you so stupid me I telling
[2:06:05] me
[2:06:05] that but when he comes it makes you
[2:06:09] tolerant to
[2:06:12] others so people don't mind being around
[2:06:15] you and there are others Brethren that
[2:06:17] as soon as you can get a chance you Bol
[2:06:23] foul you say Believers
[2:06:26] sure I don't know what they believe but
[2:06:28] they are
[2:06:30] believers but you don't want to be
[2:06:32] around them because the atmosphere they
[2:06:34] create it is
[2:06:36] contous it puts you on edge you're there
[2:06:39] with them but you smile on fake you're
[2:06:41] like you're trying to do the smile but
[2:06:43] ain't going
[2:06:44] good you're not stretching as he
[2:06:47] supposed to stretch so he can't you come
[2:06:49] so he go so
[2:06:52] you're trying your best to to walk
[2:06:54] around it why the image and character is
[2:06:58] molded by who they are are
[2:07:04] closing wow there's so much here I had
[2:07:06] to find a place to close
[2:07:10] by
[2:07:12] amen all right so when God look upon his
[2:07:16] lost creation his creation had fallen
[2:07:19] his loving character molded himself self
[2:07:22] into the person of Jesus Christ or his
[2:07:25] own character of Love projected himself
[2:07:27] in the man Christ Jesus so much Paul
[2:07:29] said think it not robbery but make
[2:07:32] himself equal to God by his own
[2:07:34] character
[2:07:35] molded that kind of a person and no one
[2:07:38] could ever do that but God he did it
[2:07:40] that way to pay the penalty for the fall
[2:07:43] of creation someone or something had to
[2:07:46] die someone as something had to save
[2:07:48] this creation and no one and nothing
[2:07:50] could do it because the highest species
[2:07:53] of his creation had fallen that's man
[2:07:57] and we need to understand that you came
[2:07:59] lost you didn't come save you came lost
[2:08:01] to be saved and therefore if you didn't
[2:08:04] go through the process of justification
[2:08:06] sanctification baptism or Holy Ghost you
[2:08:07] a ready yet you must go through the
[2:08:11] process
[2:08:15] must there's no option
[2:08:19] amen and each phase is a test is a trial
[2:08:25] and that's what that why people don't
[2:08:26] pray they are no test no test no trial
[2:08:30] no
[2:08:33] prayer amen so let me finish I'm trying
[2:08:36] to get a little space here so there was
[2:08:38] there has there was only one thing left
[2:08:41] that did not fall and that was God in
[2:08:44] the heavens so something of the heavens
[2:08:46] had to come down to redeem this creation
[2:08:48] because there was nothing here that
[2:08:50] could create it and God's Own love for
[2:08:53] the World created the character Express
[2:08:55] in Christ he was God's character he was
[2:08:57] God's expressed image in him was God God
[2:09:00] was in Christ revealing himself to the
[2:09:02] world and no love could ever be greater
[2:09:04] than his love this ought to put the
[2:09:06] whole world to shame to see what a
[2:09:08] condition we have fallen into and God
[2:09:11] projecting himself made a Plan of
[2:09:13] Redemption which is a by black pan by
[2:09:16] back plan for creation to redeem this
[2:09:18] Fallen character of ours and this he did
[2:09:21] to meet the penalty of the Fall which
[2:09:23] was death the day you eat the day you
[2:09:26] die and man died indeed he died also he
[2:09:30] was the only one free from the penalty
[2:09:32] of death and he came to bring us back to
[2:09:34] life from Death bring us back from
[2:09:37] unbelief which caused the fall bring us
[2:09:39] to
[2:09:40] Faith hello and what did Faith do it
[2:09:44] broke the fall and when he came as the
[2:09:47] infant Jehovah Crying In A Manger he was
[2:09:49] the truth the way the life
[2:09:51] and he brought us back to God but he
[2:09:53] came at a great price his mother Mary I
[2:09:56] like I can't leave unless I bring you
[2:09:58] this his mother Mary because why Joseph
[2:10:00] or husband had a big fight trying to
[2:10:03] bend his fate around what Moses told him
[2:10:07] he had a lot of faith he was a just man
[2:10:09] but when that
[2:10:10] reach Faith unto
[2:10:13] unbelief what reach her
[2:10:16] pregnany and he didn't touch her he was
[2:10:19] a just man and he was so just that he
[2:10:21] couldn't not believe that Mary was
[2:10:24] telling the truth how does a just man
[2:10:27] become an
[2:10:29] unbeliever and there was Mary yes I did
[2:10:33] nothing you know I wouldn't do anything
[2:10:35] yes I hear in you he gone to work he on
[2:10:37] mind he coming back home with on mind
[2:10:39] what on him mind Satan telling him
[2:10:42] things this girl pregnant and she trying
[2:10:44] to hide the shame because in those days
[2:10:47] if you're pregnant outside of marriage
[2:10:48] they Stone you to death and she don't
[2:10:50] want to be ston to so she F hiding
[2:10:52] behind you you the righteous man she no
[2:10:58] good today we still thinking so she do
[2:11:02] good then I must get rid of
[2:11:06] her not once did Joseph
[2:11:10] pray why it was not in his
[2:11:14] DNA to check what he don't
[2:11:17] know and you have a right when you don't
[2:11:21] understand go to
[2:11:24] God don't try to fix it you will be like
[2:11:29] usah you might be touching things you're
[2:11:31] supposed to touch sometime God have it
[2:11:33] shaken right in front of you to see what
[2:11:35] you going do God don't need your help he
[2:11:38] need your surrender he need your
[2:11:41] consecration glory to God and there was
[2:11:44] Joseph having a hard time to Benny mind
[2:11:48] around the truth
[2:11:51] and many people in the message have a
[2:11:53] hard time bending their
[2:11:56] mind around the truth especially in this
[2:12:01] message so what they have done everybody
[2:12:04] when this one in like what he start a
[2:12:05] new group and then that one start
[2:12:07] another one and then why Bing their mind
[2:12:11] around the truth we have a new one in
[2:12:12] Grenada they stopped their communion
[2:12:14] sorry I hope all you get me in
[2:12:16] trouble so the brother came to me from
[2:12:18] Trinidad he coming my home how you doing
[2:12:21] brother I say I'm trying to figure out
[2:12:22] what the secret AG I
[2:12:24] want cuz normally he don't come by me
[2:12:27] because we you know he in a different
[2:12:29] levels he high high up I reach up there
[2:12:33] yet and he come by me with a book I said
[2:12:35] don't bring that bookie I telling you up
[2:12:38] front I won't read
[2:12:39] it and there's another minister in the
[2:12:42] messaging he bringing that book I said
[2:12:43] no don't bring that book here so I then
[2:12:46] I ask him questions I said so what you
[2:12:48] doing now you on Zoom y allers have
[2:12:50] communion oh um we don't need that
[2:12:52] anymore I said how come we don't need
[2:12:54] that anymore when you get the Mysteries
[2:12:56] and you understand the Mysteries then
[2:12:58] you know communion is
[2:13:01] over I realize I need to get a
[2:13:03] mysterious man out of my
[2:13:07] life and I had to cut the thing there I
[2:13:10] can't believe that nonsense when Jesus
[2:13:12] said that as much as you do it you do
[2:13:14] show it to the Lord's death till I come
[2:13:16] and you have people in Your Country
[2:13:18] turning that not even the pop could do
[2:13:22] that not even the B would take that
[2:13:25] chance and know he move pocket Tre but
[2:13:27] he won't take that chance he like
[2:13:30] chalice and he give it out your wrong
[2:13:32] bread and man in the message stop
[2:13:36] it not even in
[2:13:38] Rome I don't know all eating
[2:13:42] here something real radically wrong and
[2:13:46] for people to stay and believe
[2:13:49] that then it tells me it's an evil heart
[2:13:52] of unbelief that is so
[2:13:55] deep and the devil don't care how much
[2:13:57] he
[2:13:59] kill the devil don't feel sorry for
[2:14:01] nobody tell me one thing the devil ever
[2:14:03] do for
[2:14:04] you
[2:14:06] nothing
[2:14:09] nothing
[2:14:11] nothing everything that ever happened to
[2:14:13] you was God helping you then why you
[2:14:16] can't give me your
[2:14:19] life why is Soo much
[2:14:22] trouble why all the
[2:14:25] stress why serving somebody that only
[2:14:27] bashing
[2:14:31] you you don't have to be bright you just
[2:14:33] have to recognize truth from
[2:14:39] error and people could follow that man
[2:14:42] leave me Gren let me stay
[2:14:45] simply I don't need
[2:14:47] that break the word and fix the word and
[2:14:50] move the word to justify your
[2:14:53] unbelief and Joseph willing to justify
[2:14:56] his unbelief says I know what I would do
[2:14:58] Satan give him my brain
[2:15:00] wave you say Satan yes God a't give him
[2:15:04] it I'm going to put her away privately
[2:15:08] so that she can retain her her whatever
[2:15:12] it is for the next person she
[2:15:15] married so nobody will know that much
[2:15:18] I'll do I find that is just and right
[2:15:23] and he went to sleep that night and God
[2:15:26] came to this to deliver his word not
[2:15:32] Joseph not Joseph he came to deliver his
[2:15:35] word because his word was already under
[2:15:38] reproach you know how much trouble
[2:15:39] Joseph caused by that
[2:15:43] behavior people get to know what
[2:15:45] happened with Joseph by but the man wife
[2:15:47] pregnant and we don't know he he's
[2:15:48] saying is not he he go talk he go have a
[2:15:53] confidence and you go ask him what you
[2:15:57] think and then that kind of talk do
[2:15:59] can't keep down and he talk with
[2:16:01] pregnancy can't keep
[2:16:03] down because prescy is a rising
[2:16:06] thing and the talk is a rising thing
[2:16:10] Jesus born with a stigma they said we be
[2:16:13] not born of fornication who cause
[2:16:18] it who cause it
[2:16:21] the Brethren that's right who caused the
[2:16:25] world to speak against us the Brethren
[2:16:27] that's
[2:16:29] right he started that lie and God had to
[2:16:33] come and fix it notice God didn't even
[2:16:34] tell him Joseph you could do better than
[2:16:36] that he just say listen what is
[2:16:38] happening to her is of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:40] ain't even give him another Comfort is
[2:16:42] of the Holy Ghost so cool
[2:16:45] yourself back
[2:16:49] off back off
[2:16:51] brother back off my
[2:16:54] word hello get yourself in the right
[2:17:04] order so much just and righteous men in
[2:17:06] the place and God had to tell her back
[2:17:10] off it ain't about you it's about
[2:17:14] her cuz what was in her was our
[2:17:17] Salvation even for Joseph
[2:17:22] even for Joseph he was getting rid of
[2:17:24] the very thing that came to save
[2:17:27] him and the very thing God sent to
[2:17:29] deliver his
[2:17:34] people the Holy Ghost has I'm coming
[2:17:37] down has been rejected and replaced by
[2:17:43] men they are now the Holy Ghost to the
[2:17:46] people because the genuine Holy Ghost
[2:17:49] will not stand for them nonsense
[2:17:52] and God told Samuel they have not
[2:17:55] rejected me you sorry but they have
[2:17:58] rejected
[2:17:59] me but give them what I
[2:18:02] want and they got a king after their own
[2:18:05] fashion if you read the Bible you will
[2:18:06] think that God give it to them
[2:18:09] no God never make a mistake he know what
[2:18:13] you want and he see Samuel Saul tall and
[2:18:16] handsome and full of
[2:18:18] brain no heart no prayer life die what
[2:18:22] they want game even make Samuel sorry
[2:18:26] Saul going in church and get an
[2:18:29] anointing speaking like a prophet you
[2:18:32] know Prophet you get it on the
[2:18:35] flesh you never change but die the
[2:18:40] choice die The People's Choice you have
[2:18:42] a church in Gren called The People's
[2:18:45] Church and people only look for a church
[2:18:47] where they like
[2:18:50] where they could live how they
[2:18:56] want do you understand it this thing
[2:18:59] catch me and it's hold me
[2:19:04] Joseph you do
[2:19:07] that and watch me Joseph never thought
[2:19:10] for one minute he was
[2:19:12] wrong he was justifying his unbelief if
[2:19:17] he had read the scriptures in Isaiah
[2:19:19] that's right a virgin shall
[2:19:22] conceive he should have having a party
[2:19:25] my
[2:19:26] wife is the
[2:19:29] [Music]
[2:19:31] best no you want to play big shot and
[2:19:34] just try and think it out when you get a
[2:19:36] message I wonder if he apologize to
[2:19:39] her the Bible didn't say and when you
[2:19:42] are wrong do you
[2:19:45] apologize no you move on and you think
[2:19:48] all is well God say remember people come
[2:19:50] to the prophet the prophet say oh I see
[2:19:51] this in your life you know what the
[2:19:53] prophecy a man Thief money in a Catholic
[2:19:55] Church when he was an alter boy some 20
[2:19:59] something years he said go and fix that
[2:20:01] in a Catholic
[2:20:05] Church you said that was see in your
[2:20:07] life with the god you say bring back
[2:20:09] brother Brenham bring back brother
[2:20:10] Brenham and he had the Holy
[2:20:13] Ghost brother Brenham ride his Trail and
[2:20:16] then the Holy Ghost is here speaking to
[2:20:19] you by the word
[2:20:20] [Music]
[2:20:22] hallah in your heart those are you are
[2:20:25] here this morning you know if God is
[2:20:27] speaking to your heart don't try to move
[2:20:29] it don't try to justify it if you're
[2:20:32] wrong you're
[2:20:34] wrong you can be wrong and strong you
[2:20:37] can be wrong and
[2:20:40] right when you're wrong you make it
[2:20:42] right then you begin the stage of
[2:20:45] humility so that God could raise you
[2:20:56] it I better close to that
[2:21:01] because she had to be broken let me just
[2:21:05] leave this little piece that was
[2:21:07] pregnant it was not orchestrated by a
[2:21:09] man unknown to Joseph in fact she did
[2:21:12] not even lay with anyone and yet though
[2:21:14] pregnant she was still a virgin and
[2:21:16] untouched and to lose her virginity she
[2:21:19] had to be broken by her human being like
[2:21:21] her but the Bible clearly says she knew
[2:21:24] no man and Joseph was a just man proper
[2:21:27] in Luke 1 26-38 and Matthew 1:18 read it
[2:21:32] as you bow your
[2:21:35] head in the interest of time we will
[2:21:39] come I have so much to hear but in the
[2:21:41] interest of time because I don't want
[2:21:43] you to
[2:21:45] overeat just want you to think about
[2:21:47] these things cuz you have a man of God
[2:21:49] here giving you the same word but I want
[2:21:51] you to appreciate that it's not him is
[2:21:53] that he sent by God or he's not sent by
[2:21:55] God and if he's sent by God don't
[2:21:57] provoke god let's bow heads let's all
[2:22:04] stand appreciate what you have a prophet
[2:22:06] is never having honor in his own
[2:22:09] country why because the people are blind
[2:22:12] they're in the forest and they can't see
[2:22:13] the
[2:22:14] trees I want you to check yourself this
[2:22:16] morning in the little simple message you
[2:22:19] have heard if there is something that
[2:22:21] the Lord has spoken in your heart and
[2:22:23] you said brother Tim I what you said is
[2:22:25] the truth I'm inviting you this is
[2:22:28] called our Altar and I believe in altars
[2:22:31] and I believe in making consecration I
[2:22:33] would advise you to come and talk to God
[2:22:37] because when we do wrong publicly we
[2:22:40] can't get by
[2:22:42] privately just walk here and say Lord I
[2:22:45] heard your word and I want to have faith
[2:22:48] not unbelief I want those attributes
[2:22:50] gone and I want to have a attribute of
[2:22:52] faith if you think you can willing to do
[2:22:55] that I'll stand here with you but come
[2:22:58] let God I will pray with you so that you
[2:23:01] would not be the same now if you don't
[2:23:03] come don't say you didn't get a chance
[2:23:06] because you don't come when you want you
[2:23:08] come when God calls you and he said my
[2:23:10] word never returns void hello so let's
[2:23:15] bow our
[2:23:18] heads Heavenly Father
[2:23:21] I've given the invitation and you see I
[2:23:25] leave it in your care and in your hands
[2:23:28] thank you for the opportunity that you
[2:23:30] given unto us so that we can be an echo
[2:23:34] of your word whatever happens they know
[2:23:38] they have no excuse there's no excuse
[2:23:42] because it's known now let it produce a
[2:23:44] life let it produce a life let it
[2:23:48] produce faith in God let the people have

[2:27:27] from
[2:27:29] Epsy and she would have it while she's
[2:27:32] sleeping and it bothered me and I went
[2:27:35] to God I said Lord I can handle it and
[2:27:39] to see her suffer so I began to
[2:27:43] pray and one day I found the place where
[2:27:46] the Prophet said he had a case like that
[2:27:48] and he jued the shirt burned it and pray
[2:27:52] and so when she had the next case I
[2:27:54] pulled it off I burnt it and I said Lord
[2:27:57] in the name of Jesus Christ may this
[2:27:59] devil never return
[2:28:01] amen she was about 15 she's now 35 never
[2:28:06] had another
[2:28:08] case but it gets better I have a little
[2:28:11] dog in the house and you might say well
[2:28:13] this is crazy no it's not he's God of
[2:28:15] everything yes and my dog was sick and
[2:28:19] gasping like if he was dying and I was
[2:28:21] sleeping I just finished
[2:28:23] praying and while I was there he came
[2:28:25] down right in front of me because when
[2:28:26] I'm praying he's always near me and he
[2:28:29] came down I don't know who sent him I'm
[2:28:31] only telling you what I experienced and
[2:28:34] he came right there and something said
[2:28:35] Tim get up and pray for the dog and I
[2:28:37] was so tired I didn't do and he went
[2:28:39] back up and I said if he come back down
[2:28:41] I'll pray for him and there he was right
[2:28:43] by
[2:28:44] me and I dropped from

[2:29:00] creation and after I prayed I went back
