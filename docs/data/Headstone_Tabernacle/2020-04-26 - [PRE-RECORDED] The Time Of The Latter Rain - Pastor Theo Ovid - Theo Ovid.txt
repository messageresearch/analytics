latter rain that's my title this morning the time of the latter rain and an inspiration occifer rain oh praise God you gotta have the acts for the rain yourself and that rain is coming for everyone grass in the field oh praise the name of the Lord blessed be the Lord's just all the time we last on a message about a word living with the word made flesh and this is the prophet from the comforter he says now watch what is our comfort today it's when we received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power of the Living God living in us and that's with the word of the Living God we stand and that word made flesh dwell among us now that same word that was made flesh and dwell among us has become our flesh he is with you now but he shall be in you know that same word that that prophet spoke that same word that was made flesh that same word dwells in the church and here the catch now therefore if we don't compromise that word and we stay right with it if we don't compromise it that same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when he was made flesh because your flesh holds it so God made a way for your flesh to hold the world remember it has to come into your walk into your flesh and your feet isn't that right and that's the reason visions can break through the sound barrier that's the reason vision and brick to the Sun barrier does see at the Lord because it's the word coming forth from a spirit amen so here we go now are you ready so this is a vision that the Prophet had in the early years so we started with a vision this morning this is a vision two years later I've been praying in a cave where I would go to pray but a dusty in a cave one afternoon I walked out lead my Bible on a log on the wind blew it open the Hebrews the sixth chapter which said that in the last days how it would be if we fell away from the truth and renew ourselves again unto repentance there was no more sacrifice for sin how that falls and T cells which were 90 rejection whose energy be burned but the rain commits upon the earth to water it to dress it and thorns and kissable be rejected but the wit would be gathered and I thought well it just had the wind blew that up well I lay the Bible down again and I thought well no and here come the wind and blew it open it happened three times seems pleased I said it strange and I raised up and thought Lord why would you open the Bible for me to read that when I get down to where Torn's and t-cells which is nigh on the rejection lose energy be burnt I thought why would you open that to me there and as I look across the vision broke now these visions come without pulling any gear it's just God I looked now don't know miss any words now just listen carefully I looked and seen an earth that was turning in front of me and it was all discs up I guess that is like when it have like to take a fork and fork it up like us till it up them this Cup there was a man dressed in white when the wrong showing wheat and after he went around the curvature of the earth around come a man look horrible he was just in black he was trying weed seeds over it the board come up together when they did the boat was thirsty because Irene was needed boat with this tea because Irene was needed each one looked like 3m with his little head bent over Lord Sandrine Sandrine no this is the vision and great clouds come up and the rain fell upon both of them and when it did the little we jump up and begin to say praise the Lord praise the Lord a little we'd jump right at the same set and what prison or prison log and then the vision was interpreted the rain falls on the just and the unjust the same spirit can fall in a meetin and everyone with Joyce and it hypocrites Christians all together exactly right but what is it by their fruits they unknown that's the only way it can never be known then you see how since Wild Oats wild wheat and grain sometimes impersonates genuine domestic great so close that it would deceive the very elect 'add I think we are living in a timely age that these things should be preached on and talked about so close in the last days that he could not depend upon a citizen churches separate them same Methodists or Baptists or pinnacles suffer so he sends his angels to separate them and angel is coming to bring the separation between right and wrong and no one can do that but the angel of the Lord and he is the one that's going to tell which is right and which is wrong God sent he sent His angels at the last times not angels don't you hear but angels at the last time and an angel is actually a messenger notice he said the foolish or world and also what the seed was so you have to identify this is a vision yet no he's gonna identify the shore and what the seed is because I have to know what the seed is and you're gonna know what seed is coming inside of you and what seed you already got oh praise Him a lot isn't that wonderful no the saw was he the Son of God who sent for went forth sowing seed the enemy came behind him was the devil and sowed the seed of discrepancy behind the right seed no he said the seed is the word of God and Jesus sent us in the place the word is a seed and every seed will bring forth of its kind now if the Christian the cheerin of the God has become the seed of God so you have to become God's seed like Noor was like Moses was like Abraham was you yourself have become God's seeded on the earth hallelujah now if the churn of God has become the seed of God they must be the word of God the word manifested in the ears are living in so God gave his promise at the beginning and each it had its seed its time and its promises when Noah came on the scene he was a seed of God for that age the Word of God when Moses come he couldn't come at Noah's message it wouldn't work he was the seed of God at that time when Christ come he could not come at nor on Moses age message isn't that right now we have lived to Luther's age Wesley is methodist age Pentecostal age each age has given a promise of the world and the people of that age that manifests not porcfest not not not not a doofus that manifests this the promise word is the seed of that age in other words the manifestation will be the interpretation little after wonder about it it's being manifested or do you believe that now all this happen under a church and who church on watch I'm gonna doing that you know this has to do with the word promised being manifested because when Jesus came is that Pharisees in that Sadducees a larger audience it had all kind of types of churches but he came according to promise all glory to God and the bride will come according to promise he promised a revival he promised a super Church he promised the people that know their God shall be strong so if you're weak you have to know your God it means you have to come forward not to get to know who you are is your God bigger than your problem so it'll also color with a heavy shoulder like that your God bigger than your situation you have to do con Yenny press you only get that ready for you don't know your God but your God open the Red Sea you're going to open the blinds I your God raise the dead your God heals the set your God costas your God your God is away may come that's your God I don't know what Nora God your God he's a kadhai mommy's he's a court of war Oh hallelujah praise God hey man so jesus said they are the children of the kingdom the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating to his children is the seed of the kingdom at that age not somebody in this group or somebody in that group or somebody said hey seed no he said he can try it he qualified the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operated in those children is the seed of the kingdom of God so Satan sowed discord or the seed of discrepancy he loves discord amen he was the one guilty of doing this horrible thing and Satan sword is see from the beginning when God places for his harvest of humans upon the earth Adam of course not had a knowledge of the truth and right and wrong but he has never come to that yet but we find out God gave his children his word for the defense we have no other defense than the Word of God that is our defense no bomb shelter there is no hiding place there is no Arizona or California or going to America there is no defense but the Word of God the Word of God your defense and it will defeat the devil any place anytime anywhere under any condition the word can never be defeated it is so powerful that Jesus said heaven and earth will pass away but my word could never pass away could we get my shot for the world and every word is a seed or a yummy season he's our only defense being in him we are safe Jesus was so confident of the prophetic utterance from the David's mouth I shall not suffer my Holy One see corruption David spoke that out jesus knew the scripture so he know he has the brains within three days he was so confident of the prophetic creative word that was spoken to the Prophet David he said destroy this body and the treatise I will raise it up myself Laurie Jesus wasn't imagining anything he wasn't hoping it gonna happen he no court shall I kill you that was not David that was the Spirit of God coming up on David ringing prophetic creative utterance and if that spirit come upon me today and speaks to you it can't feel because what Caroline or give the Lord are so Cano [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah yes yes yes may be seated we men know this harvest and at the beginning when God saw this seed upon the earth and give it into his hands of his children his family to keep that world that was the offense defense to keep the world here come the enemy broke the barrier by sowing a seed of discrepancy contrary to the Word of God God told him you can eat of every tree in the garden but the trees in the midst don't touch that because they tell you eat that day you die Satan came to the serpent and ax what did God say the cold blood wasn't talking to him so you have to invite information and when Eve said because her husband was all to work and when the Eve where God say we could either go retrieve a dead tree in the midst we shall we shall surely that he said you shall not surely die because God knows you could be wise you'll be very intelligent you enter like okay booth you got big head it's like you're smoking grass you get high head you would even know put an evil God knows that don't bother with him and she fell with that and then given a husband piece of it later and he fell true but she was deceived because she thought she was right the husband wasn't received he went with her and you know he's wrong because you know what God said it's not right that's why God come to break the curse and that's why Kyra come to break the curse of sin and death so you have to study about cellnet no more please God you can go free isn't that right and all they had was a few words here behind but they were supposed to stay behind that but no that's was the first bride that was Eve but this bride is not staying behind the word you know she is gonna become the world that is why that is why she'll be invincible [Applause] you know what invisible means cannot be defeated listen listen forget your bills forgets the pain forget the emotional problems forget your human spirit forget all of that just ride with me with the word just do like a bull of a mortgage to pee pee like a rock you like it there's not tomorrow it only has right now [Applause] himbecile the MSHA CS I'm getting knuckle punch this bride is not standing behind a wooden on this right will become the word the word itself she will be the word manifested she will be the Word made flesh she will be the living word the last time the devil and come to this was when he met Jesus after his when he met the prophet no we gonna meet the bride he has enough yet because the rain is fixin to fall I'm in the real rain I mean the lottery you may be seasoned according to the vision we read they will come to our when the cry will be sent us green because what we have no can be the tangible it will take a power it will take a ring to activate or manifest to see that's already in you we often say I won't talk about the cell phone you could buy a cell phone it could be the latest the greatest but if it's not activated or you having an expensive piece of I don't know paperweight you might as well put it on on tape and rest races on a piece of paper it can make no calls you can show people previous demos the fastest speed the professor and hold the screen is and what not atomic Nepal it's a dead phone because not activated but one size what is activated you could call and you can receive calls and when your phone when your seed is activated you could make calls and receive calls then you can ask what you will and it shall be given unto you Oh give the Lord a shout or we're in the wind this morning hallelujah hallelujah so Court is about to activate some sons and some daughters and dokdo get the devil hell or chlorine Oh God praising him alone the devil I see nothing yet the Bible said the Bible prophesy the people that know their God shall be strong and do great exploits not just exploits but great exploits I'm looking there today I'm looking at the stat now even a backup cancer regional bus upsetness we gonna back up diseases today it's time for a lottery [Applause] Oh God hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God listen you will be seated according to the vision boats weed and wheat begin to get thirsty but the close game hallelujah and the clothes has already come seven angels come from eternity and for macro that clone is already here that Chloe bring rain rain is coming I can guarantee you that that's dust here Lord I have no doubt in my heart I have no doubt in my mind that's according to vision that's according to prophecy [Applause] you may be seasoned you know what I've been represent your hopes your joy your Jubilee or what you look forward for all what you hire your heart or what you want materialize the rain producer set because every seed have to bring forth after its kind or glory the corners of the right seed the same Holy Spirit annoys the church that give them a deserve and Steve shows not give them power to perform miracles it falls under just on the unjust on the same as the just the very same spirit you can't make it another way and understand Matthew 24:24 gesture arise false Christ's force anointed ones anointed with the genuine thing but befores prophet or teachers of it that's why you could know somebody lonely would or not because it has to reflect back and what was on the tape what the Prophet said because he's the template that's the prom line prom night look twist for nobody when develop a plumb line panelists stand up so and straights truth if you believe in so deep I meant quite soon

behind it that is God's Word data beginning if we believe it to be the Word of God it depends on where the seed falls if it falls into grown that can create a moisture and nourishment around the promise of God it will bring forth every promise the Bible me that is why we strongly emphasize worship here I'm praising God because Barham says the praising and worshipping is decreasing he water atmosphere for the seeds germinate and grew and so on I got an e-type it with Rebecca Elijah ill Ilyas I asked the Lord the damsel that watered my camel and give me water let her be the one VISAA okay everybody one husband but you see the other a certain behavior so Eli Lilly is there was looking for a certain behavior he wasn't looking for look you look every kind of caught and clothes he wearing

after go but that word need water sadness Aaron [Applause] maybe season prophecy this time spoke original seed prophecy ah you enjoin the Lord this morning you've been trying to work this morning you in the spirit this morning listen to the prophecy remember there will be a denominational British government pretty soon it will be terrific they will bring themselves together into this Federation of churches and this kind of a church will be put out of operation as far as they know it's at that time that Jesus will appear and he will show which is random which is not remember Christian friends I'm a man I can make mistakes but God being God cannot make a mistake all the words has been written must be fulfilled jesus said so so we got things in the scripture that money fulfill and this is one of them this boycott is to come but before this broker can come of the mocking of the beasts here we go there has to be a seed soon forgot to take out a church out of it before the master of the beasts before the boy could come there has to be a seed sown to take the church out Oh glory to God so what to come here for to get seed [Applause] what's the secret the work is in the brain that mean the bride could see Donna she is pregnant with God all right let's go [Music] the shock has to leave the seed to get the seed in the presence of the Sun so it can be ripened right now so we know the shock come like the Pentecostals was like a shell over the seed and when it's green the shock is green and the seed is dream but then here comes the Sun and when the Sun set the heat and trials and tests and tribulation and pressure people do like that you know pressure come to Jesus everything will be all right come to Jesus tool best to be stress is that right not just a sign on pipoca ignore that all that come to court must suffer persecution don't call me that too blessed to be stressed foolishness that not anything memorize this man figured I want to comfort this day self so after the pressure comes down side of heat the shock after dry and pull away for the sea to get right so when the sub shop drying Under the Sun at ripening seed she becomes more mature right okay so then in the revelation is the shock was only a carrier of the green all the plant life okay so I plant a seed alpha church it shoot up a bleed stalk tassel and it come back to original again to the top all this promoted life is as carriers it's a carrier of the life but all the life is got up in the seed when it come back in the seed the bride or the church or the elect have original seed with the life locked up in it all that serious and true is they get writen and then be buried because it cannot bury a green seed so that's why going to harvest you into rightness or glory to God as you can see the need to die out break out and reproduce the green Oh hallelujah what about him says Squatch remember there's no more seed promise to a woman after Mary so Mary had to see but she was like shocked the seed was Christ in Mary isn't that right there's no money nominations promised after Pentecost it's the rapture and the bride coming forth from here the seed the wood will manifest again okay here we go notice how close it is Matthew 24:24 the two spirits in the last days the church spirit of the church people it's a spirit now and the bride spirit of the pride people would be so close together

it by the wayside I did it here then come at the devil and take it away the word out of their hearts Lisa should believe and be saved there on the rock a day which when they hear receive the word with joy these have no root for what for which for why believe in time of temptation following David fell among thorns a day which when they have heard go forth and a choked with cares and riches and pleasures of life and bring no fruit to perfection but that's on good ground are they which in an honest and good heart haven't heard a word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience there's Luke description Matthew description and 13 treaty 11 says this and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold I saw and for the show when he sowed some seeds fell by the wayside the falls came and devoured him up some fell upon stony places where they had not much as for 20 sprung up because they had no deepness of earth when the Sun was up they were scorched because they had no root they withered away some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up choked them others fell into good ground brought forth fruit some one hundredfold some sixtyfold and some thirtyfold who are in stir here and let him hear Cypress came and said unto Him wise because I want to have us because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given so the
