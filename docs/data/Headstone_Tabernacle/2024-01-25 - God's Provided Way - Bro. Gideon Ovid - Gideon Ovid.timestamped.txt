[35:22] uh from from a message of the same title
[35:26] in 26 he said now there's only two ways
[35:29] of anything not three not four just two
[35:33] he say that's the right way and the
[35:35] wrong way there's no in between either
[35:37] hot or you're cold either black or white
[35:40] you say and them ways are your ways and
[35:42] God ways so that cancel out your ideas
[35:45] and opinions immediately it has nothing
[35:48] to do with you it doesn't have to do
[35:49] with how you feel or or or or who
[35:51] invited you tonight or why you're here
[35:53] or why something happened yesterday is
[35:55] either his way or your way
[35:57] you have to choose he said you can't be
[35:59] in your way and God's way at the same
[36:01] time so his word is clear you can't be a
[36:05] a double-minded man is unstable in all
[36:07] his ways we can't be two plac at the
[36:08] same time amen so you got to forget your
[36:11] own way to get in God's way and you got
[36:13] to get out of your own way to get in
[36:16] God's way for as long as you're in your
[36:18] own way you're out of his way amen so we
[36:21] understand that this is his word now so
[36:24] forsake your ways forsake your thought
[36:27] forsake everything and just rely one
[36:29] thing on thus said the Lord that's all
[36:32] then you know you're right though you
[36:34] can't see it none of the senses will say
[36:37] it's right everyone will say it's wrong
[36:40] but you know it's right because God said
[36:42] so amen because he said it you know it's
[36:45] right has nothing to do with how you
[36:47] feel or what time it is or what kind of
[36:50] day you had yesterday but God said so so
[36:53] it's right that's what we want to stand
[36:55] on the word of God
[37:00] that's what makes it right the fact that
[37:01] it's God's word now that's his provided
[37:05] way it has been his word it is his word
[37:09] God's provided way for the human to live
[37:11] is not by your senses it's not by how
[37:13] you feel taste touch scare smell no no
[37:16] no no no it's by his word and his word
[37:19] can't lie it's the same yesterday today
[37:21] and forever if he promised it yesterday
[37:24] he will keep the promise today is not
[37:26] going to change his mind he's not going
[37:28] to change the way he feels about you he
[37:30] knows you didn't come in here 100% you
[37:33] didn't come in here a perfect man but
[37:35] that's why he called you to perfect you
[37:38] to deal with you to carry you through to
[37:40] build your character into somebody that
[37:42] he could
[37:43] [Applause]
[37:47] use I remember brother Anthony just
[37:50] Sunday speaking about it he spoke about
[37:51] Joseph he said despite what he went
[37:54] through Hallelujah the jealousy the
[37:56] slavery the the prison experience even
[37:58] being forgotten in jail God's provided
[38:01] way was to place him in a position that
[38:03] he could bring Deliverance to his people
[38:06] so it didn't matter where he went it
[38:08] didn't matter where he was placed or
[38:10] what he went through at the end of the
[38:12] day God's provided way is beyond what we
[38:14] could ask or think or imagine or
[38:17] conceptualize in our own minds his way
[38:20] is his way and his way only that's the
[38:22] right way and that's what we want to be
[38:24] guided by that's what we want to follow
[38:26] that's why we want to come in line and
[38:28] in tune and in step with his provided
[38:30] way because he has a provided way in
[38:32] store for you it may be different from
[38:35] the journey that he has for me but you
[38:37] need by Revelation to grab a hold of
[38:39] faith and understand and believe that
[38:42] his promise for you is just as real as
[38:45] it was in in previous years in previous
[38:49] time Divine Healing is just as real the
[38:52] Holy Ghost is just as real and this is
[38:55] his provided way that he has made and
[38:57] created for you to be able to maximize
[39:00] your potential and your benefit of his
[39:02] promises
[39:05] [Applause]
[39:08] amen you know I want to tell you a
[39:11] little story it's not my story it's a
[39:13] story he said later on in that message
[39:15] and I think it's so beautiful I just
[39:16] want to share it again I I know it's
[39:18] something you're familiar with and you
[39:19] would have heard before but I just want
[39:21] to recap it again he says it reminds me
[39:23] of a little Irish mother coming from
[39:26] Ireland coming across the ocean she was
[39:29] going over to New York to meet her
[39:31] daughter and you will see the parallel
[39:33] between the story and the wise virgins
[39:36] on the road over they sent a SOS the
[39:39] ship was about to sink and they were
[39:42] just playing some kind of jazzy music
[39:43] just having a good Grand time coming
[39:45] over let's just imagine was like a
[39:47] cruise they having a good time and they
[39:49] were playing that jazz music down on the
[39:51] floor and they were dancing the captain
[39:53] the skipper you know he come down and
[39:55] rather and said just a moment moment
[39:56] everybody change your music change your
[40:00] attitude let's change your atmosphere
[40:03] because something has happen we if we
[40:06] can only hold out 30 minutes we'll be
[40:09] there amen if we don't we're going to
[40:13] the Bottom of the Sea so those were the
[40:16] the two options they had if we hold out
[40:19] 30 minutes we'll be in New York if not
[40:23] we'll be at the bottom of the ocean so
[40:25] that was their reality at that time
[40:28] right so he
[40:31] said everybody they began to play Nara
[40:34] my God to thee and everybody falling on
[40:36] the floor and they begin to pray little
[40:39] old Irish mother with a little old dress
[40:41] hooked up around this way and her long
[40:43] sleeve she said Glory Hallelujah
[40:46] Hallelujah why the skipper said Madam
[40:48] what's wrong with you did you hear the
[40:51] announcement I
[40:52] made he said did you misunderstand me he
[40:56] said said did you know I said in 30
[40:59] minutes Hallelujah from now we may be at
[41:01] the bottom of the
[41:03] sea she said I I understood you I
[41:06] understood you
[41:08] clearly he said why don't you pray she
[41:11] said I'm prayed up don't have to pray
[41:15] I'm prayed up said Oh Glory praise the
[41:17] Lord he said how can you do that lady
[41:21] what are you shouting about if you
[41:23] prayed up he said well and she said you
[41:26] said in 30 minutes from now if we held
[41:28] out we'll be in New York he said that's
[41:31] right and if we didn't hold out we'll be
[41:33] at the bottom of the sea say that's
[41:35] right she said Glory she said I got a
[41:38] daughter in New York I'm going to see
[41:41] and if if we don't hold out I got one in
[41:45] glory so I'm going to see one in 30
[41:47] minutes whether it's the one in New York
[41:49] or the one in glory I definitely could
[41:52] stand on the promise of God and the
[41:53] faith I have that he is going to allow
[41:56] me to see one of my daughters in 30
[41:58] minutes that's her testimony she said
[42:00] hallelujah praise the Lord that's the
[42:03] way you want to live Hallelujah right
[42:05] pray it up and ready to go anytime he
[42:08] calls you're ready to go pray it up and
[42:10] ready to
[42:11] go
[42:13] Hallelujah he said walk in God provided
[42:17] way ready for any minute amen for you
[42:19] don't know what minute he'll call you to
[42:21] come in his presence amen that's how we
[42:24] want to live like those wise with extra
[42:27] oil we may not know the time or the hour
[42:30] but you want to be so prepared you want
[42:32] to be filled you want to be sealed you
[42:34] want to be prayed up that at any
[42:36] moment's notice you're
[42:40] ready
[42:44] hallelujah hallelujah so if you don't
[42:47] mind I just want to revisit that
[42:49] scripture we read at the beginning from
[42:50] Proverbs
[42:53] 3 just going through it's a little
[42:55] slower this
[42:57] time
[42:59] and chapter 3:1 it says my son forget
[43:03] not my
[43:05] law and when we hear law we often think
[43:08] legalistic we often think this is
[43:11] something dramatic don't want you to
[43:12] forget and yes it is but even Sunday
[43:16] when the pastor shared he shared that
[43:18] scripture very familiar scripture in
[43:19] Psalms 1 which was David at the time and
[43:23] he says blessed is the man that walth
[43:25] not in the Council of the ungodly nor
[43:27] standeth in the way of Sinners nor sit
[43:29] it in the seat of the scornful but his
[43:32] Delight is in the law of the law and in
[43:35] that law in his law do he meditates day
[43:38] and night so we see a parallel between
[43:41] what David said and what Solomon said
[43:44] amen he said it's very important he said
[43:47] my son forget not my law forget not so I
[43:51] want you to meditate on it I want you to
[43:54] study it I want you to have it ingrained
[43:57] in your system so it's almost aate it
[43:59] becomes a part of you that's how I want
[44:01] you to appreciate my law my rules my
[44:04] guidance my leadership I want it to be
[44:06] part of your life
[44:09] amen then it goes on to say in the same
[44:12] verse he said but let thine heart keep
[44:15] my
[44:16] Commandments
[44:18] yes so I I had to research this a little
[44:21] more cuz he talk about the law in the
[44:23] first instance forget not the law learn
[44:26] this almost like an academic exercise
[44:28] make sure you know it don't be caught
[44:30] with it undone don't be caught and and
[44:32] you're not sure what the law says but he
[44:35] also says let thine heart keep my
[44:39] Commandments that has nothing and I'll
[44:42] clarify in a second that has nothing to
[44:44] do with an academic um academic
[44:47] exercise your heart keeping his
[44:49] Commandments has all to do with you
[44:52] loving respecting and appreciating him
[44:58] it doesn't matter how bright you are how
[45:00] intelligent you are if you have a
[45:01] master's degree or if you're past CXC if
[45:05] you love him and you understand who he
[45:07] is you'll obey his
[45:10] word that's how you keep his
[45:12] Commandments by honoring his word and
[45:15] the relationship that you have with him
[45:17] which could only come through love amen
[45:21] as a matter of fact in St John 14 12-21
[45:26] I'm going to read it for you you don't
[45:27] have to find it it says verily verily I
[45:29] say unto you he that believeth on me the
[45:32] works that I do shall he do also and
[45:36] Greater Works than the shall he do
[45:38] because I go unto my father verse 13 it
[45:41] says and whatsoever you shall ask in my
[45:43] name that will I do that the father may
[45:45] be glorified in the son if you shall ask
[45:48] anything in my name I will do it and
[45:50] then on verse 15 he says if you love me
[45:54] on keep my Commandments
[45:56] he didn't say if you're in church long
[45:58] time or if your father told you so or if
[46:02] you wrote it down on the back of a book
[46:04] or you have it stuck up by your bedside
[46:06] no he said if you love me so if you have
[46:09] that loving relationship with me and
[46:12] that respect for me and that ability to
[46:15] honor my word then I want you to keep my
[46:18] Commandments he said I will pray the
[46:20] father in verse 16 and he shall give you
[46:23] another comforter that he may abide with
[46:26] you forever even the spirit of Truth
[46:29] whom the world cannot receive because it
[46:31] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[46:34] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[46:36] shall be in you I will not leave you
[46:38] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[46:41] little while and the world seeth me no
[46:42] more but ye see me because I live you
[46:44] shall live also and then in verse 20 he
[46:47] says at that day ye shall know that I am
[46:49] my father and ye in me and I in you then
[46:52] in verse 21 which is the last verse
[46:54] we'll read at this point he he said he
[46:57] that hath my Commandments and keepeth
[47:00] them he it is that loveth me so hold on
[47:04] you mean your ability to keep his
[47:06] Commandments is proof that you love him
[47:09] so this love is not a talk love you mean
[47:11] this love is not something you profess
[47:13] now and you walk down and you forget
[47:15] about it this love have action with it
[47:18] this love has listen it actually have
[47:20] something we could measure and check and
[47:22] quantify and say listen you need to love
[47:25] me to keep Commandments and when you
[47:26] keep it and I see you keep it and know
[47:28] you love me so you could prove it it's
[47:30] not just a talk love it has action with
[47:33] this love this is his provided way this
[47:36] is what he has determined and
[47:38] predestinated for us because he said he
[47:42] it is that loveth me and he that loveth
[47:44] me shall be loved of my father and I
[47:47] will love him so hold on so you mean I
[47:50] need to have love to keep his
[47:53] Commandments and when I keep his
[47:54] Commandments I prove that love him and
[47:56] it have benefits to go with that it's
[47:58] not just instructions so I want to
[48:00] revisit the scripture in a little bit to
[48:02] show this scripture is filled with
[48:04] instructions and benefits instructions
[48:07] and benefits that's how it's defined
[48:09] that's how it's outlined that's how it's
[48:11] guided you have instructions on one hand
[48:13] and the benefits of going through the
[48:15] instruction he said listen he said he
[48:17] that loveth me shall be loved of my
[48:19] father and I will love him and will
[48:22] manifest myself to him so this has
[48:25] nothing to with rules this has nothing
[48:27] to do with the pastor say and the
[48:29] deacons say and my mother say and my
[48:31] cousin long time tell me I should do
[48:33] this this is not your recommendation and
[48:36] and the way we see it and culturally we
[48:39] believe no no no no no this is God's
[48:41] word his way his provided way if you
[48:45] keep his Commandments you need to have
[48:47] love in your heart to be able to do that
[48:49] and when you do that it have benefits
[48:51] father could love you he could love you
[48:53] and he could manifest himself in you
[48:55] amen
[48:57] it's all about love it's not about you
[49:01] it's about him and his ability to have
[49:04] that
[49:06] relationship amen amen isn't Jesus
[49:10] wonderful my my my I don't want us get
[49:12] too distracted but going back to that
[49:14] original scripture in Proverbs I'm on
[49:17] verse
[49:18] two it says for the length of days and
[49:21] long life and peace shall they add to
[49:24] thee so just to bring it in context
[49:27] that's the benefits so think about the
[49:29] first one he said
[49:31] listen keep keep your mind on my law
[49:35] make sure you keep my Commandments don't
[49:38] forget it don't forget it you have a
[49:41] part to play but if you could follow my
[49:43] instructions these are the benefits
[49:46] Length of days long life and peace shall
[49:50] they add to thee you know some people
[49:53] cut short you know some people they miss
[49:55] miserable they cast it away they
[49:58] struggle through no matter how hard they
[50:00] it's always a fight it's always a fuss
[50:03] but wait if that's the case and my Bible
[50:06] say and God's word says for length of
[50:09] days and long life and peace if you want
[50:12] this it give the prescription Above So
[50:15] if you're feeling odd you're feeling out
[50:17] of place you're feeling a little weird
[50:18] listen the instruction is at the top you
[50:21] know you go to the pharmacy or the
[50:23] drugstore and they tell you take this
[50:25] twice a day after meals and you
[50:29] convinced you see that I I taken mine
[50:32] before meals because I like to do my own
[50:34] thing and you feel upset or something go
[50:38] wrong all you had to do was follow the
[50:40] instructions you know it reminds me of a
[50:43] time they they had a bottle and they say
[50:45] shake well before opening and the person
[50:47] jump and Shake right they didn't follow
[50:49] the instructions they supposed to shake
[50:52] the bottle and then take it so sometimes
[50:54] you need to catch up a revelation of
[50:56] what's required so you can really apply
[50:59] it to your life so in this case no
[51:01] explanation required yes sir no no no
[51:04] opinion required no addition no
[51:07] subtraction this is not algebra it
[51:09] clearly says listen keep my law keep my
[51:12] Commandments and here what long life
[51:16] peace long days
[51:19] simple 1 equal 1 1 + 1 equal 2 it have
[51:24] no mats in that
[51:25] easy understood now here's the thing in
[51:29] a message leadership here here what he
[51:32] says paragraph
[51:35] 11 1965 he said you know what you know
[51:39] what the first commandment is in the
[51:40] Bible the first commandment with Pro
[51:42] with promise maybe a little hard for you
[51:44] to understand these Commandments the
[51:46] first commandment is not to have any God
[51:48] but him but the great Commandments and
[51:50] the first commandment that has a promise
[51:52] to it see is to the children did you
[51:55] know that that see he said obey your
[51:58] parents which may lengthen the days upon
[52:01] the Earth that the Lord has given thee
[52:05] goes on to say to mind your parents and
[52:07] to do what you're doing it may give you
[52:09] a longer life upon the earth look that
[52:12] the Lord has given you so so the days he
[52:14] gave you he it could be more he could
[52:17] extend it if you follow the instructions
[52:20] if you follow the prescription right he
[52:23] said because it gives more time to serve
[52:25] him him you're not living long to harass
[52:27] your grandchildren you're not living
[52:29] long to harass somebody but he said to
[52:31] serve him so he give listen the
[52:34] prescription and the benefit one time
[52:36] prescription benefit and as we go on
[52:38] you'll see prescription benefit by the
[52:41] time you do two you you you will get it
[52:42] trust me you see wait now prescription
[52:45] benefit prescription benefit if I do
[52:46] this this happening if I do this this
[52:47] happening wait now all I I to do is have
[52:49] faith and believe God's word I mean it's
[52:53] simple I don't have to try to figure it
[52:55] out I don't have to wonder I don't have
[52:58] to add something and I you know what I
[53:00] need to to to do something special or
[53:03] know because I want to catch something
[53:05] in it no listen it it plain it clear do
[53:10] this and this is the result imagine they
[53:13] say listen do as your brother K just do
[53:16] what your brother do know you get
[53:17] blessed the same thing get the same pay
[53:21] you just do this and the outcome is that
[53:24] but we find that hard
[53:26] we find that hard it's just two ways or
[53:28] know it's not multiple ways it's not
[53:30] five and 10 and 20 ways and choose one
[53:33] and Mickey Mouse thing going on no no no
[53:35] no no it's either your way or God's
[53:39] way at the same time I'm not saying
[53:42] don't eat healthy and don't exercise and
[53:44] don't do what the doctors say no do what
[53:47] you have to do but at the end of the day
[53:50] God has a provided way to give you
[53:52] guidance and direction to be able to
[53:54] achieve your goals and objectives that
[53:56] you aspire to accomplish amen that's why
[54:00] step by step it's it's outlined Amen in
[54:03] verse three hope I'm not going too slow
[54:05] take your time take your time he says
[54:06] let not mercy and Truth forsake thee
[54:10] bind them about thy neck write them upon
[54:13] the table of thine heart now that's a
[54:15] long one but let's just look at the
[54:17] front let not mercy and Truth forsake
[54:19] thee you remember when Peter ask how
[54:21] much times we should
[54:23] forgive what is Mercy
[54:26] there goes I but for the grace of God
[54:28] that he could reach out and and and take
[54:30] us out of the mar clay we should have
[54:33] the same kind of
[54:35] Mercy right and I made a note here that
[54:39] we shouldn't have we shouldn't be a
[54:40] stranger to forgiveness and
[54:43] honesty so for the virtues to really
[54:45] live in us it's it's there it's all in
[54:48] the word mind you I'm not making this up
[54:51] this is not my thoughts and ideas this
[54:53] is God's word he said it it he puts it
[54:56] together I just rehash
[54:59] it in second Peter 1 and here's a
[55:01] familiar scripture verse 5 to7 he said
[55:04] and beside this given all diligence add
[55:06] to your faith virtue no science there
[55:10] and to Virtue knowledge he didn't say

[55:17] find the square root and find Co
[55:19] coefficient X sulf for x no he say add
[55:22] to your faith virtue and to Virtue
[55:25] knowledge knowledge Temperance

[55:35] your brother anyhow no matter how you
[55:37] feel they they wrong you and I feel so
[55:40] bad and I was embarrassed at the end of
[55:42] the day what the word
[55:44] say forgive Let It Go leave it alone
[55:48] that might be God's provided way for
[55:52] you because he know what you want to get
[55:54] out of of you think about the Rich Young
[55:57] Ruler good Master what I could do he are
[56:02] Welter already he had honor as a matter
[56:04] of fact brother brother preached about
[56:06] it a few weeks ago he had everything
[56:07] going for him charismatic fell
[56:09] goodlooking come from a good home he
[56:11] probably went the best schools oh
[56:12] eloquence you can't compare yourself to
[56:15] him Hallelujah and he said what La yet
[56:19] what I do have Jesus say you know keep
[56:22] your command keep the Commandments you
[56:23] know do the regular do the things that
[56:25] you expected he said I've done this from
[56:26] my youth since I was a child are doing
[56:29] it this is normal it's almost on the
[56:31] verge of insulting because I in church a
[56:33] long time I I practically born in church
[56:36] you understand I grew up I'm a a ruler I
[56:38] I oversee people you know I am
[56:40] management early amen but Hallelujah but
[56:44] of course the prophet revealed that
[56:46] there were still things that God needed
[56:48] to work
[56:49] on I can't tell what you need to work on
[56:52] it I don't live by you or work by by by
[56:55] by you I'm not in your house but you
[56:57] know and God knows so when God pull you
[57:01] through and you say oh Lord why are
[57:02] going through this he knows why you may
[57:05] not even understand your family may not
[57:07] understand and you know what it's not
[57:09] even important it may not even make
[57:11] sense if you look at some of the
[57:13] characters in The Bible to you it may
[57:16] not even make sense imagine Samson was
[57:18] smaller than the average person but when
[57:21] the spirit came on Samson he could do
[57:23] above and beyond what people could
[57:25] imagine was possible think about Noah
[57:28] buil a boat Noah was not architect a
[57:32] carpenter you know what this man is a
[57:36] engineer he do I think it's nautical
[57:40] science they call it he focus on this so
[57:42] he could tell you exactly how long the
[57:44] both should be no but God give him
[57:47] instructions and tell him if you build
[57:49] this boat you will survive you do this
[57:52] you will make it true I go and send rain
[57:55] so I'm going to send this instruction
[57:57] here to get you out this is my provided
[58:00] way to take you through just do it and
[58:02] you're in order how difficult is that
[58:06] simple once he follow the instructions
[58:09] you're good to go and guess what God is
[58:11] the same yesterday today today and
[58:14] forever so he give instructions here and
[58:17] say listen do this forgive tell the
[58:20] truth keep my Commandments learn the law
[58:24] keep it keep it sacred and near love one
[58:26] another love me show me you could do
[58:29] it what difficult in that simple in
[58:33] Simplicity that is his provided way and
[58:36] he hasn't changed now I showed you
[58:37] earlier on and we may have missed it
[58:39] wait now both David and Solomon were
[58:43] saying the same thing how come how come
[58:45] they're saying the same thing God way
[58:47] didn't change when he tell you meditate
[58:49] day and night yeah meditate day and
[58:52] night your son meditate day and night
[58:54] your great grandchildren still
[58:55] meditating day and night because
[58:56] important to know the law how could
[58:58] Jesus say it is also written and it is
[59:01] written and it is written if he don't
[59:03] know the law if he don't know what the
[59:05] words say how he can quote it the rules
[59:08] remain the
[59:09] same you with me so it doesn't change
[59:12] it's no respect to a person to know it's
[59:14] not well because you're you're younger
[59:18] or you're female or you're older you
[59:20] have more children or more
[59:21] responsibility no God requirement is the
[59:23] same in Moses time time when God said
[59:25] that angel going on pass you feel you
[59:28] could put put I I want to put my blood
[59:30] in a Nike sign because I executive no no
[59:34] he said Put it on the door post on this
[59:37] stop here on the side make a cross with
[59:40] it that was his instruction he say if
[59:42] you do that when he Death Angel pass he
[59:44] passing you straight passing your
[59:47] household straight you're protected so
[59:49] you have the instruction this is the
[59:51] benefit so once we understand that all
[59:54] we do follow God's provided way and
[59:57] you're free and you're released you
[59:59] could see this is what God have in store
[1:00:01] for you because he love you so much he
[1:00:03] give you the instructions in advance and
[1:00:05] tell you do this if he tell you in this
[1:00:08] age listen you need to seek the Holy
[1:00:10] Ghost you need to seek the holy ghost at
[1:00:14] what point the instruction
[1:00:16] change it change just like Noah say it
[1:00:19] will rain It Will Rain It Will Rain 120
[1:00:21] years it was still going to rain right
[1:00:23] so if this is the token and this is the
[1:00:25] requirements and this is what they're
[1:00:26] looking for it hasn't
[1:00:28] changed same
[1:00:31] instruction that is the instruction what
[1:00:34] is the the benefit of that clearly
[1:00:36] outlined you want oh oh you don't want
[1:00:39] it you don't want eternal life you you
[1:00:41] don't want to spend eternity with God
[1:00:43] you don't want in the in the Rapture you
[1:00:45] don't want to to to to to be counted as
[1:00:48] one of them right no but you see brother
[1:00:52] brandham say you know that that that is
[1:00:54] actually easy he said this debt here is
[1:00:56] simple you know he said but you see the
[1:00:58] second thatt do you trouble someone
[1:01:00] because it's easy oh gosh all you have
[1:01:03] no commitments to the bank and financing
[1:01:05] and you have no pain and no sorrow and
[1:01:07] that sounds good but you don't have a
[1:01:10] second that when you rais up again and
[1:01:12] have to give an account for why you
[1:01:14] didn't you didn't didn't forgive and and
[1:01:17] listen why you just ignore this part of
[1:01:19] the scripture why you ignore this why I
[1:01:22] give you instructions and you didn't
[1:01:23] follow whose fault is that and you had
[1:01:26] the same time the same opportunity he
[1:01:30] give you this is your
[1:01:33] instructions at that point we can't
[1:01:35] blame and say his brother you know his
[1:01:38] brother so so so the way he look at me
[1:01:40] he thrw me off he put me in the wrong
[1:01:43] seat that day so I really couldn't
[1:01:45] receive what was being said you
[1:01:47] understand so it's not good enough we
[1:01:50] have to do what is required of us and
[1:01:54] what his word said in order to get the
[1:01:57] benefits we can't make excuses we can't
[1:02:00] use somebody else experience and say
[1:02:02] well you know my parents used to go to
[1:02:04] church long time so they go say a prayer
[1:02:05] for me no it don't work so God don't
[1:02:08] have grandchildren so this is just the
[1:02:10] way his provided way to achieve that
[1:02:13] Hallelujah going quick quickly to verse
[1:02:15] four it says so shalt thou find favor
[1:02:19] and good understanding in the sight of
[1:02:22] man of God and man let me read it one
[1:02:24] one more time so shalt thou find favor
[1:02:27] and good understanding in the sight of
[1:02:29] God and
[1:02:31] man you know it is so interesting that
[1:02:34] they talk about finding
[1:02:36] favor and in Trinidad in particular you
[1:02:39] know we say is is is it's not it's not
[1:02:42] who who you know but who know you and
[1:02:44] finding favor so favor is a good thing
[1:02:46] so imagine God say he want to favor
[1:02:49] you he want to show you favor he want to
[1:02:54] give you things different than your
[1:02:56] neighbor he want to bless you he want to
[1:02:59] keep you he want to guide you he want to
[1:03:01] put a hedge around you he want to show
[1:03:03] you his favor and he want to find favor
[1:03:06] not just with him but with man and
[1:03:08] humanity and Mankind that people could
[1:03:10] love you and respect you
[1:03:13] Amen in Joshua and and this reminded me
[1:03:17] of of the Lord's commission to Joshua so
[1:03:20] in Joshua 1 vers 7 and 8 he said only be
[1:03:24] thou strong and very courageous and we
[1:03:26] familiar with it that thou May observe
[1:03:29] to do according to all the law you hear
[1:03:32] what it said there all the law right
[1:03:35] which Moses my servant commanded thee
[1:03:38] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[1:03:41] the left that thou mayest Prosper
[1:03:44] withersoever thou goest so he said
[1:03:46] listen if you could follow the law that
[1:03:49] Moses give unto you don't go left don't
[1:03:53] go right
[1:03:54] do divert and try to go your own way
[1:03:57] just follow the Lord that I give to
[1:04:00] Moses and Moses give to you look the
[1:04:03] benefit here so that was the instruction
[1:04:05] right it says that thou mayest Prosper
[1:04:08] withersoever thou
[1:04:09] goest in verse eight it says this book
[1:04:12] of
[1:04:13] law shall not depart out of thy mouth
[1:04:18] but Thou shalt listen meditate therein
[1:04:21] day and night not on a Sunday and a
[1:04:26] Wednesday night it says day and night
[1:04:29] right that thou must observe to do
[1:04:32] according to all that is written therein
[1:04:35] for then Thou shalt make thy way
[1:04:39] prosperous and then sht thou have good
[1:04:42] success so remember I say above and
[1:04:44] beyond so we not looking at profits of
[1:04:48] 2% and 3% I see government I believe
[1:04:51] doing a bond for four 4% over five years
[1:04:54] it sounds good but the government I'm a
[1:04:56] part of the the the community I'm a part
[1:04:59] of the Kingdom I'm a part of he said
[1:05:01] good success you not 4% success listen
[1:05:05] he talk
[1:05:07] Bountiful and when he when he mentioned
[1:05:09] fs and say 10 full and above and listen
[1:05:14] the God I serve does operate under
[1:05:16] different rules and I hope you
[1:05:17] understand and you catch it by now that
[1:05:19] we operate under different rules his
[1:05:21] provided way man can can sit down and
[1:05:24] it you know they can sit and say listen
[1:05:26] you know what if we do this we think
[1:05:28] this will happen and let's do a a fact
[1:05:32] fine or we do a comparative analysis of
[1:05:34] what we should do they brought that to
[1:05:36] Joshua you know when Joshua had a
[1:05:38] crossover the professionals the
[1:05:41] Consultants came to him and said listen
[1:05:43] if you wait just wait a little while
[1:05:46] because we have meteorologists and and
[1:05:48] different chologist and we check it out
[1:05:51] and we could see a far off and when we
[1:05:52] check we realize if you're wait you
[1:05:54] could just wait over and you know what
[1:05:56] he said what God say we moving in three
[1:06:00] days we crossing over it doesn't matter
[1:06:02] what you think how you feel your mindset
[1:06:04] your opinion your attitude this is the
[1:06:06] instruction I get and this is what we're
[1:06:08] going and do and that is the benefit of
[1:06:11] following the instructions of God
[1:06:14] Amen now I can say I'm moving quickly
[1:06:17] along it says in verse 5 trust in the
[1:06:21] Lord with all thine heart and lean not
[1:06:25] unto thine own understanding and this
[1:06:27] was the subject today trust in the Lord
[1:06:30] with all thine heart and the latter part
[1:06:32] said and lean not unto thine own
[1:06:35] understanding so that should cap it off
[1:06:37] there it has nothing to do with if you
[1:06:39] find it song nice if you find it sound
[1:06:41] harsh if you find it sound bad it's not
[1:06:43] about your ability to understand what
[1:06:46] God say or what I am even saying it has
[1:06:48] all to do with his word is truth his
[1:06:51] word is what we living by his word is
[1:06:54] God so when he said do it you do it it's
[1:06:57] right because it's his word just because
[1:06:58] he said it it's right we don't have to
[1:07:00] figure it you think we could have
[1:07:01] figured out when when God told told
[1:07:05] Gideon he said listen take the pictures
[1:07:08] put the light at a particular time break
[1:07:12] it listen I don't know they have Art of
[1:07:16] War by sunsu and different things about
[1:07:18] military planning and and catching
[1:07:20] people off guard and things but I don't
[1:07:22] think any planner of any kind of War
[1:07:26] could really rationalize what God
[1:07:29] instruction to Gideon was you know his
[1:07:31] instruction was so complicated to the
[1:07:34] man at that point that everybody would
[1:07:37] have been confused if he tried to
[1:07:39] explain how this was going to work but I
[1:07:41] could tell you what I
[1:07:43] know God said it here that was the
[1:07:46] instruction he did it and when you
[1:07:49] looked the victory was won the battle
[1:07:51] was over they didn't have to go and run
[1:07:53] people down and fight people and and
[1:07:55] come with spars and swords and shs no
[1:07:58] they cause a loud noise and the lights
[1:08:00] and the drama similar to when Joshua
[1:08:02] went around he went around once next day
[1:08:05] went around next day went around when he
[1:08:07] went seven times they didn't rush and
[1:08:09] say all that once let's pull the walls
[1:08:11] down no they just had to shout and once
[1:08:14] they followed the instruction that was
[1:08:15] God provided way to capture that
[1:08:19] adversary Jericho was their because they
[1:08:22] could follow instructions amen so it
[1:08:24] says trust in the Lord with all thine
[1:08:26] heart and lead not unto thy own
[1:08:28] understanding and with that verse
[1:08:30] Hallelujah I want to just give a little
[1:08:32] background Hallelujah the prophet
[1:08:34] preached a message called lean not unto
[1:08:36] thine own understanding and he said you
[1:08:38] know today we send out children to
[1:08:40] school to have understanding amen so he
[1:08:42] wasn't condemning school he said then
[1:08:44] after they go through the grammar school
[1:08:46] he send the high school they they get a
[1:08:48] better understanding then after they go
[1:08:52] through there some trainer even
[1:08:53] fortunate enough to go to to college
[1:08:55] which we call University and they go
[1:08:57] through college to complete the
[1:08:59] education and and the understanding of
[1:09:01] knowledge what they are acquired of many
[1:09:05] times they acquire that in an effort to
[1:09:08] get a job a lot of them do that right
[1:09:10] you have to have at least a high school
[1:09:12] diploma or so so on he say yet imagine
[1:09:17] Solomon who's regarded as the wisest man
[1:09:19] to ever live he told us not to lean to
[1:09:22] it not to lean our own understanding
[1:09:27] it's not what the teacher in the
[1:09:29] classroom will take you out and and pull
[1:09:32] you through and bring you out is not
[1:09:34] that by the way I'm not condemning
[1:09:37] formal
[1:09:38] education he said because we wonder why
[1:09:41] he would say such a thing as this for
[1:09:43] it's because that usually our modern
[1:09:46] understanding is usually the wisdom of
[1:09:48] man which is contrary to the word of God
[1:09:52] I think that's what Solomon was was
[1:09:53] trying to advise his sons was not to be
[1:09:58] illiterate but not to lean to their
[1:10:02] understanding and I think it would be a
[1:10:04] good exhortation today if we said to our
[1:10:07] sons and the sons of God that is it's
[1:10:10] all right to have an education
[1:10:12] Hallelujah there's nothing against that
[1:10:15] but when the education is contrary to
[1:10:17] the word of God then lean to the word
[1:10:20] let your education go see because the
[1:10:23] word education will stand and will give
[1:10:25] you a good job and per perhaps a good
[1:10:27] standing in society and and among the
[1:10:29] intellectuals you'll be regarded and and
[1:10:31] you know red as as somebody
[1:10:35] intelligent but you see it may even help
[1:10:38] your financial your finances and your
[1:10:40] livelihood making a living perhaps
[1:10:42] better but remember one thing you've got
[1:10:45] to die so after you achieve all you plan
[1:10:49] to achieve and you want to achieve
[1:10:51] you've got to die no matter how much
[1:10:52] education you got how many culture
[1:10:55] you're able to accumulate you've yet got
[1:10:58] to face death because is it written men
[1:11:00] must die and after that judgment and God
[1:11:03] when debt debt is not so bad but coming
[1:11:07] to judgment is the bad part now you
[1:11:09] could die but after that the Judgment
[1:11:12] God is not going to inquire of you how
[1:11:14] much schooling you got who was your
[1:11:16] lecturer perhaps who was in your cohort
[1:11:18] and who was in your class if you study
[1:11:20] with Dr Williams or something no he not
[1:11:22] going to ask you that he want to know if
[1:11:25] you have the
[1:11:26] requirements because his requirements is
[1:11:29] very different than the academic
[1:11:31] requirements he say he not going to ask
[1:11:33] whether you got a A Bachelor of Arts or
[1:11:36] or what degree you might have done even
[1:11:37] as a minister it's not going to be
[1:11:39] required of you but it's going to be
[1:11:41] required of you what you did about the
[1:11:44] understanding of God's word amen that's
[1:11:46] where the requirement comes because that
[1:11:48] your education is fine but the word of
[1:11:51] God is life am my word is is life and to
[1:11:54] know it is life and he said know him he
[1:11:57] is the word so you can only know him by
[1:11:59] the word for he is the word that's the
[1:12:02] only time you'll know him by his word
[1:12:08] amen in verse six of the same scripture
[1:12:12] in Proverbs 3 it says in all thy ways
[1:12:15] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[1:12:18] paths if you ever wanted a Christ
[1:12:21] directed Life and you wanted to see your
[1:12:22] way you wanted to see doors open and
[1:12:25] windows closed and doors Clos and
[1:12:27] windows open and opportunities that are
[1:12:29] for
[1:12:30] you this is a scripture that you need to
[1:12:34] really really be able to internalize and
[1:12:37] really catch a a a revelation of in all
[1:12:41] thy ways acknowledge Him not some and he
[1:12:45] shall direct your path this is not you
[1:12:47] throwing out an act and you say well I
[1:12:49] going here know bless me Lord help me
[1:12:53] Lord because this is what I want no he
[1:12:55] going in front you and all you have to
[1:12:58] do is
[1:13:00] follow Lead Me Lord that's it all you do
[1:13:02] is follow so he in front you think he
[1:13:05] will lead you astray you think he Lead
[1:13:06] You Wrong it says in all I ways
[1:13:09] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[1:13:11] path in a a message God hiding himself
[1:13:14] in Simplicity in 63 he said he wants you
[1:13:18] he wants all you are he wants every
[1:13:21] compartment in your heart he wants your
[1:13:23] private life he wants all your life he
[1:13:26] wants to be a lord lord is ownership he
[1:13:30] wants to own you so he can guide you
[1:13:33] direct you take you use you are you
[1:13:35] willing to do that if you are he's
[1:13:37] wanting to come in and you wouldn't be
[1:13:39] standing there see so now is the hour
[1:13:42] for you to receive it now it's up to you
[1:13:44] now if you'll believe it with all your
[1:13:46] heart it'll be settle from right now
[1:13:48] this will be a memorial night right now
[1:13:51] tonight this Wednesday night they
[1:13:52] probably won't close these doors tonight
[1:13:55] you'll stay all night in here but if you
[1:13:56] do like this say Lord I'm standing on my
[1:13:59] feet until you fill me according to your
[1:14:02] promise I'll never move from here where
[1:14:04] I standing you mean business with God
[1:14:07] he'll get to business with you because
[1:14:09] he's
[1:14:10] obligated to give you the benefits of
[1:14:13] his
[1:14:15] [Applause]
[1:14:22] instructions
[1:14:24] in verse S of the same scripture he said
[1:14:27] be not wise in thy own eyes fear the
[1:14:30] lord and this ties back into what we
[1:14:31] spoke about earlier you know in a in in
[1:14:34] a message
[1:14:35] respects 61 he said in
[1:14:39] verse this is paragraph 48 sorry he says
[1:14:43] now when you hear the term fear the lord
[1:14:46] he say now that doesn't mean that you're
[1:14:48] afraid of him but that means that you
[1:14:50] are giving him respect and reverence
[1:14:54] and when you respect God you fear God
[1:14:56] you fear that you might displease him in
[1:14:58] some
[1:14:59] way you fear lest you would do something
[1:15:04] wrong you wouldn't want to I fear my
[1:15:07] mother I fear my wife I fear my church I
[1:15:09] fear all of God's servants unless I
[1:15:11] should put a stumbling block somewhere
[1:15:13] in their way I fear the people I fear
[1:15:16] the people of the city unless I should
[1:15:19] do something wrong that'll cause them to
[1:15:20] think I wasn't a Christian see
[1:15:24] you've got before you can have respect
[1:15:26] you got to have fear and God demands it
[1:15:29] he demands respects God does he demands
[1:15:32] it and fear brings it and we know that
[1:15:35] fear brings respect so you see we talk
[1:15:37] about love we talk about fear so fear is
[1:15:39] not a a shout at you and I look at your
[1:15:42] fun to you feel bad no but because you
[1:15:45] respect God and you reverence God and
[1:15:47] you love God and you want to honor him
[1:15:48] and you honor his word you have no
[1:15:51] choice but to follow his instructions
[1:15:55] you have no choice but to look for his
[1:15:56] way that he has provided for you to find
[1:15:59] that and follow him amen and then it
[1:16:03] says and depart from Evil
[1:16:07] from the message deity of Christ of
[1:16:10] Jesus Christ he says and today that's
[1:16:13] what the matter with the church the hope
[1:16:15] of glory the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:17] has come into the people's hearts and
[1:16:19] they don't recognize what it is amen
[1:16:21] they don't recognize it they think it's
[1:16:24] a little church joining or something
[1:16:25] like that but that is the god the
[1:16:27] creates are living in you and giving you
[1:16:30] all the powers and you're in possession
[1:16:32] of anything that he had so is
[1:16:36] it in you to abstain from Evil to do
[1:16:40] good to shun evil and flee to
[1:16:42] righteousness to turn away from
[1:16:44] temptation all malice hatred Strife envy
[1:16:47] and so forth turn away from it for that
[1:16:50] will take him from your heart if you
[1:16:52] will receive receive him Embrace him and
[1:16:54] love him and hold him in your hearts and
[1:16:56] love him I can tell you the church
[1:16:59] together in that kind of a power has the
[1:17:02] power to bind the heavens heal the sick
[1:17:05] Open the Eyes of the blind Hallelujah
[1:17:07] the death speak the dumb speak the deaf
[1:17:10] hear the cripples walk the blind see why
[1:17:13] it's recognizing the power of almighty
[1:17:16] God in your heart there he is the deity
[1:17:20] do you want that
[1:17:22] tonight
[1:17:24] amen amen
[1:17:26] amen hallu looking to wind down now and
[1:17:30] and in verse
[1:17:31] eight it says it shall be Health to thy
[1:17:35] Naval and Marrow to thy
[1:17:38] bones held to thy Naval Lord and Marrow
[1:17:42] to thy bones so you know I went and and
[1:17:44] and I had to check it
[1:17:46] out according to Better Health bone
[1:17:51] Maru is is the blood cell
[1:17:54] Factory healthy bone marrow releases
[1:17:57] blood cells into the bloodstream that
[1:17:59] are mature and when required without
[1:18:02] bone marrow our bodies could not produce
[1:18:05] the white cells we need to fight
[1:18:06] infection the red blood cells we need to
[1:18:09] carry oxygen and the platelets we need
[1:18:11] to stop bleeding I'm not a doctor I'm
[1:18:14] not a medical professional but I know
[1:18:16] this means bone Mar real important we
[1:18:19] need it because it helped fight off
[1:18:21] illness it help extend your life it it
[1:18:25] help preserve your life so if the reward
[1:18:29] if the benefit is it shall be Health to
[1:18:33] your neighbor and Marrow to your bones I
[1:18:36] want
[1:18:38] that I want that I need to follow the
[1:18:41] instructions to get that because the
[1:18:44] benefits in there I want to get that and
[1:18:46] if you only look at it from that
[1:18:48] perspective and you realize wait a
[1:18:49] minute Hallelujah if I want long life
[1:18:52] and peace
[1:18:53] if I want good success if I want to find
[1:18:56] favor with God and man if if I want to
[1:18:59] get these things I just outline the
[1:19:02] instructions to get itlu all you have to
[1:19:04] do is accept it as yours by faith and
[1:19:06] know this is the word of God I'm going
[1:19:08] to follow this and guess what you'll get
[1:19:10] the same
[1:19:11] outcome amen now I want to wind on and
[1:19:14] wrap up so what what I want to do at
[1:19:16] this point I just want to read a couple
[1:19:18] other verses not going to explain them
[1:19:20] too much but I want to read a couple of
[1:19:22] other verses so from verse 9 listen to
[1:19:24] this because it's good it says honor the
[1:19:27] Lord with thy substance and with the
[1:19:28] first fruits of thine increase verse 10
[1:19:32] so shall I remember instructions
[1:19:35] benefits so when you honor the Lord with
[1:19:37] the substance and the first fruits he
[1:19:39] the benefits so shall thy bands be
[1:19:42] filled with plenty and thy presses shall
[1:19:44] burst out with new wine listen to this
[1:19:47] one my son despise not the chastening of
[1:19:50] the Lord neither be wary of his
[1:19:52] correction
[1:19:53] for whom the Lord loveth he correct it
[1:19:56] even as a father the son in whom he
[1:19:58] delighted happy is the man that findeth
[1:20:00] wisdom and the man that get it
[1:20:02] understanding amen that's verse 13 He
[1:20:05] said for the merchandise of it is better
[1:20:07] than the merchandise of silver and to
[1:20:09] gain thereof than fine gold verse 15 she
[1:20:12] is more precious than rubies and all the
[1:20:15] things thou can desire and not to be
[1:20:17] compared unto her verse 16 Length of
[1:20:21] days is in her right hand hand and in
[1:20:23] her left hand riches and honor now this
[1:20:25] is the same chapter they're still
[1:20:27] talking about Length of days and riches
[1:20:29] and honor so my friends in this same
[1:20:33] chapter they have instructions benefits
[1:20:36] instructions benefits throughout and it
[1:20:39] still come back to repeat Length of days
[1:20:42] is in her right hand and in her left
[1:20:44] hand riches and honor her ways so you
[1:20:48] notice we don't even have instructions
[1:20:50] here he reiterating benefits her ways
[1:20:53] are ways of pleasantness and all her
[1:20:57] parts are peace amen let's just pause
[1:21:00] right there at verse 17 you know the
[1:21:02] musicians could get get ready at this
[1:21:04] point and I just want to say that God's
[1:21:07] provided way is there to lead and guide
[1:21:09] you it's not yet there to fight you down
[1:21:12] and you know too much rules and somebody
[1:21:14] say and somebody tell me and I don't
[1:21:16] like how rough it was and what no no no
[1:21:18] no no it's there to lead and guide you
[1:21:21] he just wants you to love him and to
[1:21:22] serve him with all your heart he doesn't
[1:21:25] want you to try to make natural sense
[1:21:27] out out of it it needs no detailed
[1:21:29] explanation no no no fancy
[1:21:31] interpretation no opinion no you consult
[1:21:35] with with a Brethren and you find this
[1:21:37] some kind of word it has nothing to do
[1:21:39] with that this is the word of God and if
[1:21:42] God said it it will come to pass because
[1:21:45] that is his provided way he probably
[1:21:48] play through the
[1:21:49] blood
[1:21:51] hallu you know in that same message
[1:21:53] God's provided way he
[1:21:56] says men today are trying to make
[1:21:59] themselves a way people always be
[1:22:01] believe they're creative and they're
[1:22:03] bright they want to make their own way
[1:22:05] no matter how many times you say there
[1:22:06] are only two
[1:22:07] ways your way and God's way Hallelujah
[1:22:10] the wrong way and the right way he said
[1:22:13] men today are trying to make themsel a
[1:22:14] way they say well now I go to church and
[1:22:19] I do this I'm a good man well there's
[1:22:22] nothing wrong with that but still that's
[1:22:24] not God's way for
[1:22:27] you God's way he had to kill something
[1:22:30] for you that was his son Jesus Christ
[1:22:33] and on and and the blood has was is and
