Brother Bram preach by Brother Bram amen amen you may be seated praise God God bless you God make work see you got your own Resurrection inside of you your Resurrection lays inside of you in your spirit I you know when Jesus died on the cross his soul descended into hell and preached the souls that were in prison that repented not longsuffering days of Noah his body went into the grave but before he died he committed his Spirit into the hands of God into the hands into thy hands commend my spirit so you see his Spirit went to God his soul went to hell his body went to the grave now that spirit that was in him was the spirit of God that spirit in stimes and diverse matters anointed the prophets to bring the message to the people in the last days through Christ uh now in these days here through the gospel now when we receive Christ into our heart there's all that we have need of there's eternal life now Christ could not come back until three days was fulfilled because his Spirit was behind a screen like a bar like this that he could not cross over that bar and because it was a spoken word of God that he was to lay in the grave for three days and three nights now he could not come back until that three days and nights was up then when the three days and night night was up his Spirit was loosed it went directly to his soul and his soul came back and picked up the body and fulfill what he said I have power to lay my life down I have power to take it up I have power now each one of you have power the same way because you are Sons and Daughters of God and the Very Spirit that's in you this morning the Holy Spirit that's in you this morning that same holy spirit will raise you up so you have power to raise yourself back up when you die your soul will go into the uh under the altar of God not in right in the presence of God now your spirit will go to God but you cannot come back remember the Bible it said the spirit souls are on the altar crying Lord how long how long they could not return until the scriptures fulfilled like Christ canot return till the scriptures fulfilled then after the all has been done all the sufferings over and the Brethren has suffered the same thing or we suffered like they suffered and so forth then on that day you know exactly where you're buried your spirit will be turned loose from God and will come to the soul now the soul is that part of me who knows and understands your intelligence you remember the vision I had not long ago the little translation went into that place and saw those people amen now your spirit will come back to that body and that that kind of a body the soul which say the body that does not uh have to eat and so forth is this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting a Celestial body and with that spirit and that soul and Celestial body you'll raise up again this natural body that great Millennium hallelu you have the power in you now to do that now but that power that you have in you now can make a new world God doesn't have little weak spots and big heavy spots is powerful the least little touch of God is omnipotent amen see the least little touch of God so you know so I'm trying to get you in faith now you know that something has happened to you as a Christian do you know it amen you used to ride down here in the muck with all of the muck and sin and drinking and gambling and and things of the World well as soon as you believe that Christ forgive your sins you raised up above that stuff now you're riding up here the above all of it why because that you believe that you are a Christian then when you accepted Christ and the Holy Spirit came to you then you had faith in the holy spirit that gives you power to ride above that kind of life of sin well the only thing you have to do to ride higher into healing is just have more faith amen just keep pushing see and there you are now you're sick and you're not a Christian become a Christian right now so that that healing power will come in you by becoming a Christian and that will give you Faith to R above sin it'll give you faith in everything that you have need of in this journey is right in you now and the only thing you have to do is have faith in God that pushes that good things out of you which by the Holy Spirit you understand clearly now you Billy told me last night called me and said come in this morning especially for one person come thinking we're having services this we of those seven uh seals and they brought a sick child I believe and if you're here now sir remember you cannot your your faith will have to go for that child if it's it's a little infant child but now let me take another scripture if it's all right brother just remember now in the gospels we read over in the 16th chapter I believe of the acts where that Paul and silus was in prison one night and they had been beaten because he cast The Devil's Spirit out of a fortune telling girl and it was U and she her Masters had got angry about it and beaten them put them in in her prisons and then when they did that well Paul and sil's pray and God sent an earthquake and the jail down the flipping Jailer being a centurion which to lose his his uh prisoners was to be his own life would have to pay for the prisoners he pulled his sword and was going to commit suicide when Paul run forth and said do yourself no harm we're all here and this Centon had St some impression they had had about Paul and him they might have some him they might have testified or done something but whatever it was they know that they were holy man they know there was something different about those man because quickly he asked what must I do to be saved amen what must I do to be saved now Paul said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ amen and th and thy house shall be saved well if Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ I don't mean that his salvation would save the house but if he's got enough faith in God for his own salvation he have the same faith for his house and his house will have to come in see the same thing same job did as it said the other night down in Georgia the meeting I said Jo he said now I don't know my children have seen but what if they have seen and job had one thing to do to be righteous that was offer a burnt offering he said he would offer the burnt offering if his children had sin then they would be forgiven of their sin and it was a good thing that father done that's a good thinking father we need more of those kind of fathers today and job offered the bur offering that's before his tragedy set in but when his children was all killed and his sheep all destroyed and all he had taken he sitting on the a sheep back of his house scraping himself with a piece of cross did you notice after the days of his tragedy when God began to restore to him again where he had 10,000 cattle or so forth he restore double and double his sheep but you notice and God also gave job his seven children you ever think where they were at that bur and stood for him amen they were saved in glory waiting for him to come he's with him today th and th how shall be saved see now J had one thing to do to be righteous was to offer the burnt offering you have one thing to do to be righteous that's have faith in God am am for by faith are you saved by faith are you heal by faith you get everything that you have it's by faith that you believe now believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and th house shall be saved now sir you got the baby here to be pray for you believe yourself I'm here to put my faith with yours and we'll believe together that God heal that baby see we got in us the power to do that amen you got knew the power to do it every Christian's got the power to do it but now if we can just get that power is controlled by law as I've often said it's like gravitation controls water because it's a law gravitation controls water the sun is controlled by the by the the Earth turn of the earth you can't just make the sun do one thing doesn't say I won't sleep long hold on power it won't do it see because there's a law if you work according to that law well then everything will be all right if you go to bed in time you can wake up in time and if you uh like we got the Lake Superior Lake on here your Lake y on all those great lakes up here we got tens of thousands times thousands of Acres of ground out Nevada and California and Arizona New Mexico that's burning up for that water of land that would raise anything you can feed the whole world about there if you only had this water up here down there and it wouldn't bother that because of the spring fed as soon as it goes down just comes up your SL again because gravitation holds it there well now if you can work according the law of gravitation you can take all these Great Lakes and water that whole country out there and feed the whole world nobody will be hungry but you can't sit here and say yeah I see it sure got to go to it well that's the same way it is about the law of God the law of God is Fai and we got faith here this morning to heal any sickness to do anything amen but it's control by law and that law is Faith God's law is Faith Jesus said whatsoever things you desire you afraid if you can believe you receive it you can have it there you are so it's a faith that controls it and faith is given to us just as we have need of now we have to God L some of some Faith some other faith it isn't some great Supernatural power that have because when you become the Christian you already have the power but you like faith in operating have power amen so now the morning when you come to be pray for remember the Bible has said this this is true James 5:14 if there be any among you sick let them call the Elders of the church let them anoint them all pray over the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise him up promise you'll believe it therefore you see healing is loed to the individual it was the days of Jesus of Naz he can not heal people against their against their own faith he said I can if you believe if you believe that I'm able to do this I can do it if you can believe it so some people throw throws the power of healing into some of evangelist it's not that the power of healing is in you Amen in you they just put the C before the hearts the Evangelist doesn't have power to heal it's the holy spirit that has power of healing you have the holy spirit amen that's the little tree that you are and all the things that you have need of is in you so therefore you just start drinking from God's promise and it's a truth God say heal me buy Stripes I am there you start pushing and then others can see what you have now what is faith is the substance of things hope far evidence of Things Not Seen I not set that little tree out don't see the animal but they're in theree knows are in there so he just starts ring pushing pushing because he know it's in I'll get it out after while give me a little time just keep me a little time you just keep drinking app are in me I'll bring up after a while first thing go here they come here comes the a Because he believes that there in amen and if you believe that the power of the holy spirit is in you to he you there you are just keep pushing see you have faith you can't see the result right away you don't see it I see James Justified Abraham by his Works Paul justifi about Abraham by his faith what do we say then between the two Abraham was speaking on what I mean Paul was speaking on what God saw in Abraham and James is speaking on what people saw in Abraham see now see therefore God know that before the baby come that Abraham had faith in Abraham proved to God by acting like he that the baby was going to come when he was sterile he had no children his wife's WB was dead and he was sterile but yet he know in there somewhere was the baby you see he kep drinking the promise lean on God's Great El sh the breast lean there drinking knowing God would know that is a promise he had to do it and we're the children of Abraham so let's lean on to PR there God will do it you believe it now let the S line over here on one of the sides the other it wants to be prayed for and we get the Elder here and anoint them and all I'll pray over them and we'll leave a God will make every one of them well if thou can't believe KY where you at come around on this right hand side that's good and I want you to play only believe while they're coming Let's us to our heads the rest the audience let's be in prayer for these people who are coming our heavenly father we pray pray for you this morning in the name of Jesus Christ these poor sick suffering Humanity that's in this terrible disastrous condition I believe you I know that your words are true they are so true they cannot fail because they are God's Eternal and everlasting word they are all powerful like God is because they're a part of it in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwell Among Us now we believe that Lord with all of our hearts with all of our soul with all that's inside of us we believe it and I try in a simple childlike way to present it to the people that they might understand and know that the power of God LS within them they can only have their faith and follow God's order that's how they were saved they come and repented of their sins and was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ according to the Bible Acts two and then Peter said that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and here it com just because it's God's word made manifest thank you Jesus oh now the same thing father we know is true and we are not to sick with our pray the prayer Fai shall sa the S God shall raise them up God made each one leave this alt around this place this morning so happy rejoice and knowing that God is healed going be made well are we commit them to thee now in the name of Jesus Christ May each one be healed and Cat the vision what it means like Abraham call things which are not as though they were no matter what the results is that have nothing to do with faith Hallelujah results is nothing Faith's already come the whole and faith is the substance of things and the evidence of Things Not Seen make it s deep their heart or their need I go as your humble servants to Stand Here along with other servants and pray God put our hearts for these sick people we ask it in Jesus name amen amen somebody said the building now give another Min here pray this morning we would like to ask all the ministers here you [Applause] are now as they PR the song and the ministers are taking your place you're so each one let's see coming down across the mountain I see a man coming was any different from any other man he's just an ordinary man kind small and body rather frail and wece look his eyes down upon a a seed place down in the B it was this Apostles they had a boy down there had epilepsy and no doubt what they were saying healing Lord he but you see just saying heing Lord he w't do it that's what going to do it there's got to be something behind that [Music] if I can get you to believe that and believe that with all your heart you're going to be I get you to really see the vision I maybe Shake maybe push brother believe Hallelujah but the Devil stay right there because he couldn't find that Fai there make me believe but here comes one down across the hill and as soon as that devil that a [Music] [Applause] that's just not come for a show but come love our God know that we been commissioned this is our commission father I think this is word this song was written from compos of the word he said Lord I have mercy upon my son with the devil in the bar and PES away and so forth he said I to your disciples to think of the end [Applause] but I am if you will believe with say to do it if you can believe that would God let here this morning cancer sickness affli God Yi [Music] passion he doesn't fa I can you what do you say [Music] for oh [Applause] brother not just [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] Lord let Mercy I pray and heal these people through Jesus so many along the line watching seeing their reaction of how they were see how they react on an action these are such a thing as an action they raise and come far and another things how they react on that action that they have made after they have come to the place to believe that when they're prayed for they'll be healed and watch the reaction of their action Pastor got a good message for from sure this morning one thing I'd like to comment on just to know a cathol girl Stand Down on the altar a few days ago she was in my house her and her husband and um I know her husband for some time and and there was something about while studing on a private interview that's where we had the vision that's where we I used to have it here in the church but just taking up the morning and so forth and so it was I never said nothing because she being a girl another thing always reared in the Catholic church and so forth but she went to speak for her mother and during that time I saw a vision of her mother told her what her mother's trouble was and described her and how her mother looked of course she was judged that was right or not I've never seen her mother in alive she knows that and the girl this morning came to the Altar and stood to make a confession and accept Christ as heror she all I anointed her all how how God works anoint all our s watch the moving of the Holy Spirit now being she was anointed not sick but anointed see how makes everything work right she stood as the Christian now as she has become what we believe to be a Christian now she says would you pray for my mother she sick that's the same one so the anointing always applied approprate that see someone being just saved Christ stood for all of us he stands for all and as soon as this girl becomes a Christian then she wants to stand for somebody too sh that the fear of Christ comes within us when we are really saved now that's really fine uh I certainly appreciate that that fine Christian spirit I believe now just remember now to this young lady she's here somewhere and to another Catholic lady that came by and uh i' like to say these words just before I turn the service to is this now the Catholic church was one time like this church if you go back and read the Bible which we believe and do know that the Catholic church was the first church that is true but it got away from its teachings this was the teaching of the Catholic church but you see they got 600 and something other books that popes and so forth has written it's just as holy to them as this Bible so see what this is you haven't changed what you've done you just been converted see now if you take of course I guess maybe some two this morning was wind there might be some Catholic man sitting in here if you go back to the history of the church if you might ask your preest the action of these Apostles in the Bible here was that the way that was that early Catholics they'll say yes and that's true they were now they look what kind of religion they had they met little simple places they never said Hy Mar or our fathers that's a tradition of the church what did they say they praise God they scream they cry look here in Acts 2 when the Holy Apostle Peter and James and John and all of together the Bible said they spoke in tongues and they scream and even act so so filled with the spirit until they act like they were drunk and even the outside world are not all these drunks and then Peter the Apostle the holy St Peter when he stood up and he said men and Breen these men are not drunk but they're filled with the spirit as as the Bible says they were now that was an early Catholic Church according to the teaching now you see after about 200 years the taking five begin to get into the church then what they do they made their first organization at the N Council 866 they made their when the N Council was held at 9 home they began to get all the great dignitaries in and they just formed a church and made a church and broke four five times went from that to the Bish from the bishop to Pope and from that come the and different ones to just broke it up to what you see it today it's just an all kind of work but what we're trying to do Catholic bring see we are Catholic too we are the early beginning Catholic and the church that they call us now mostly we're referred to as Pentecostal because we believe in the Pentecostal blessing that's where the Catholic church is argiz and in our organizations of Pentecost today if if this world would stand 500 years longer this Pentecostal organization would be more formal than the Roman Catholic Church is today it's just getting farther away same way and when you organize you make a lodge out of it and then you just become Lodge and members and unconverted souls to my precious dear brothers and sisters to all of you as a servant of God I never say word in this church I say that's the prophet of the Lord I say you this is the life walk in amen [Applause] hallelujah hallu let's all [Music] stand when you appreciate the message this evening praise God thank you Jesus

chapter 11 prise this SC chap 11: 23-32 praise God for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you but the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as he drink it it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever
