[48:52] that song
[48:55] and um he had shared
[48:58] and many of you would have heard it
[49:00] before but when i read it
[49:02] it just resonated with me one more time
[49:05] [Music]
[49:07] the journey of life
[49:10] and how you have to really be grounded
[49:13] in god
[49:15] and have trust in god especially when
[49:19] things don't go the way you might expect
[49:22] so you share this with me and did you
[49:25] know the song it is well with my soul
[49:28] was written by
[49:29] a successful christian lawyer horatio
[49:32] spafford
[49:34] his only son had died at the age of four
[49:38] in 1871 and in 1872 the great chicago
[49:44] fire wiped out his vast estate that he
[49:47] had made from his legal career
[49:50] and then in 1873 just another year later
[49:53] he sent his wife and his four daughters
[49:56] over to europe on a summer trip on the
[49:59] ill-fated
[50:00] ss will they have a ship
[50:03] since he had a lot of work to do he
[50:05] planned to follow them later
[50:08] but the ship sank and he lost his four
[50:11] daughters
[50:12] with the wife being the only survivor
[50:16] she sent him a famous telegram which
[50:18] simply read saved alone
[50:21] on his return home his law firm was
[50:23] burned down
[50:25] and the insurance company refused to pay
[50:27] him
[50:28] they said it was an act of god he had no
[50:32] money to pay for his house
[50:34] and no work he also lost his house
[50:37] then while sitting and thinking what's
[50:40] happening to him
[50:41] being a spiritual person he wrote a song
[50:45] whatever my lord you have taught me to
[50:47] say
[50:48] it is well it is well
[50:52] with my soul and i'm standing here today
[50:55] and we are all standing here today no
[50:57] matter what we have been through
[50:59] the lord has taught us to see
[51:02] he has taught us to say it is well
[51:06] it is well it is well
[51:10] it is it may not be well with my house
[51:11] but it is well with my soul
[51:14] it may not be well with my cow but it is
[51:16] well with my
[51:17] soul my business my job this that it may
[51:20] not be well with that but
[51:22] you have taught me to say it as well
[51:27] with my soul is that your testimony this
[51:30] morning
[51:32] oh can we give the lord a praise
[51:34] offering oh
[51:36] lift your hand and say thank you jesus
[51:39] thank you jesus blessed be the name of
[51:41] the lord
[51:42] father we praise you father we worship
[51:44] you father we thank you for the trials
[51:47] we
[51:47] thank you for the testing we thank you
[51:49] for the ups and the towns lord
[51:51] we thank you that it is well with our
[51:53] souls this morning
[51:55] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[51:58] he may be seated thank you so much
[52:01] musicians
[52:03] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[52:05] like to greet one and all in the
[52:06] precious theme of jesus christ
[52:08] it's certainly a great privilege to be
[52:10] gathered in fellowship one more time
[52:12] in such a time like this and we don't
[52:16] count it for granted we don't take it
[52:18] for granted
[52:19] because we see so many things are
[52:21] changing around us
[52:22] we see the issues that have prevailed
[52:25] for some time
[52:26] continue to manifest itself in a way
[52:28] that
[52:29] humanity is being challenged and unless
[52:32] you have something that grounds you that
[52:35] anchors you that keeps you seen you'll
[52:37] go insane
[52:38] men's hearts feeling for fear people
[52:40] wondering how to live how to move what
[52:42] to do
[52:43] how to act but we have a comfort this
[52:45] morning and our comfort is not in church
[52:48] our comfort is not in a belief our
[52:50] comfort is in the lord jesus christ
[52:52] who promised to take care of us promised
[52:55] to never leave us
[52:56] never forsake us he promised to be with
[52:58] us even in us
[53:00] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[53:02] lord so i greet you
[53:03] in the name of jesus christ and i
[53:05] certainly want to wish a happy birthday
[53:07] to our precious pastor
[53:09] uh pastor theophilus ovid amen yesterday
[53:12] was his birthday
[53:14] so we thank god you appreciate your
[53:15] pastor
[53:18] hallelujah the gift of god that god has
[53:21] please
[53:22] in our midst and we love him and
[53:24] appreciate him and on behalf of the
[53:26] church we wish him many more years
[53:28] of health and strength and more than
[53:30] that to be more yielded to god as a
[53:32] vessel in this hour
[53:34] because the word tells us there'll be a
[53:35] famine in the last days
[53:37] for the hearing of the true word of god
[53:39] but i believe in my heart
[53:41] that god has blessed us with a pastor
[53:43] after his own heart
[53:44] can the church say man who stands in
[53:47] season
[53:48] out of season it doesn't matter what
[53:50] wind blows
[53:52] he is firmly rooted oh hallelujah on the
[53:55] promises of god
[53:56] oh for this end-time bride and for this
[53:59] local church
[54:00] so we love him and appreciate him and um
[54:03] the family we we sent him to get all the
[54:05] rest
[54:06] we send him to get a little rest so he's
[54:09] not here in the tabernacle this morning
[54:11] but if i know
[54:12] him he is connected on the under on the
[54:14] hook up this morning
[54:16] so we want to just remember him as well
[54:18] so are you ready for the word this
[54:19] morning
[54:20] let's all stand to our feet as we
[54:22] approach the holy scripture this morning
[54:25] and such a blessing how many appreciate
[54:28] last week sunday's message getting to
[54:30] the golden altar
[54:32] what a masterpiece of a message and we
[54:35] see the holy spirit as till in the
[54:36] corner
[54:37] and we are moving with the cloud this
[54:39] morning so reading two portions of
[54:41] scripture
[54:42] reading from first peter two and reading
[54:45] uh from verse nine first peter two and
[54:49] reading from verse nine
[54:51] ye are a chosen generation
[54:55] a royal priesthood and holy
[54:58] nation a peculiar people
[55:01] that he should show forth the praises of
[55:03] him who had called you
[55:05] out of darkness into his marvelous light
[55:10] which in times past were not a people
[55:13] but are now the people of god which had
[55:16] not
[55:16] obtained mercy but now have obtained
[55:19] mercy
[55:20] and let's go to the book of revelation
[55:22] chapter five in reading from verse one
[55:26] revelation five and reading from verse
[55:28] one
[55:29] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[55:31] sat on the throne a book written within
[55:33] and on the backside
[55:34] sealed with seven seals
[55:38] and i saw a strong angel caming with a
[55:40] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[55:42] book and to loose the seals thereof
[55:44] and no man in heaven knowing it neither
[55:46] under the earth was able to
[55:48] open the book neither to look there on
[55:49] and i wept much
[55:51] because no man was found worthy to open
[55:54] and to read the book
[55:55] neither to look there on and one of the
[55:56] elders say it unto me
[55:58] weep not behold a lion of the tribe of
[56:01] judah
[56:02] the root of david had prevailed to open
[56:04] the book
[56:05] and to lose the seven seals thereof and
[56:07] i be held and lo
[56:08] in the midst of the throne and of the
[56:10] four beasts and in the midst of the
[56:11] elders to the lamb
[56:13] as it had been slain having seven horns
[56:15] and seven eyes which are the seven
[56:17] spirits of god send forth into all the
[56:19] it
[56:20] and he came and took the book out of the
[56:22] right hand of him that sat upon the
[56:23] throne and when he had taken the book
[56:25] the four beasts and four and twenty
[56:28] elders fell down before the lamb having
[56:30] every one
[56:31] of them harps and golden vials full of
[56:33] orders which are the prayers of saints
[56:36] and they sang a new song saying thou art
[56:39] worthy
[56:40] to take the book and to open the seals
[56:42] thereof for thou were slain
[56:44] and has redeemed us to god by thy blood
[56:47] out of every kindred
[56:49] and tongue and people and nation and has
[56:52] made
[56:52] us unto our god kings and priests
[56:55] and we shall reign on the earth may the
[56:58] lord have a blessing to the reading of
[56:59] his word shall we pray heavenly father

[57:11] them so we thank you this morning
[57:12] that you are able to bring us to this
[57:14] spot this this this
[57:16] this crossroads as it were as we
[57:18] continue along this journey

[57:22] adoption and perfection
[57:24] and oh god the millennium and the new
[57:26] city and the rapture and every
[57:27] redemptive promise in the book father

[57:44] presence dropped down wherever your sons
[57:46] and daughters
[57:46] may be gathered even in other
[57:48] fellowships today may the holy ghost
[57:50] slow
[57:50] light and lord flash through the world
[57:53] lord as we prepare
[57:54] to leave this place we are not satisfied
[57:56] with just being in church we are not
[57:58] just
[57:59] satisfied in knowing what's about to
[58:01] happen but we want to be
[58:03] participators lord in what is about to
[58:05] happen
[58:06] we want to be active participants father
[58:08] we want to do our part we are reporting
[58:11] for duty this morning may you lord open
[58:14] your word to us we commit this service
[58:15] into your hands in the precious theme of
[58:17] jesus christ
[58:18] and the church says amen and amen you
[58:21] may be seated
[58:22] this morning in the presence of the lord
[58:24] and uh
[58:25] i have a title this morning
[58:28] the aaronic the ironic priesthood
[58:31] the melchizedek priesthood and the royal
[58:34] priesthood
[58:35] the aaronic priesthood the melchizedek
[58:38] priesthood
[58:39] and the royal priesthood and a subject
[58:42] understanding the priesthood that you
[58:44] are born unto
[58:46] and an inspiration the great high priest
[58:49] and the kingdom of priests and the
[58:52] church say amen
[58:54] so i'm connecting to brother ovid's
[58:56] message
[58:57] last sunday when he preached on getting
[59:00] to the golden
[59:01] altar and what our foundation for
[59:05] a corner being turned into spirit and he
[59:08] made a powerful statement
[59:10] that the way back to eden is by the
[59:12] altar
[59:13] and through the altar and we would have
[59:16] explored in that message and in bible
[59:18] study as well
[59:19] that moses would have been caught up to
[59:21] mount sinai
[59:23] and he was given instructions
[59:26] god in his mind had a plan for how
[59:28] things are to unfold and the thing about
[59:30] god
[59:31] he's a god of progressive revelation so
[59:33] he doesn't give everything all at once
[59:35] he doesn't reveal everything all at once
[59:38] he drops something here and then
[59:39] somebody picks it up later on and then
[59:41] all of a sudden
[59:42] it begins to make sense but but he has
[59:44] to drop it there
[59:45] so that it could be picked up somewhere
[59:47] else he is so much ahead of our thinking
[59:50] that he could drop little secrets along
[59:52] the journey that only when you need to
[59:54] connect back to the secret
[59:55] it needs to be called up at that point
[59:57] to make sense can the church say amen
[59:59] so isaiah would say a virgin will
[1:00:01] conceive and that hung there nobody knew
[1:00:03] what to do with it
[1:00:04] it was just there it was just in the
[1:00:06] records hallelujah
[1:00:08] but when the time came they could find
[1:00:10] where it was written
[1:00:11] peter on the day of pentecost could say
[1:00:14] this is that which was spoken
[1:00:16] by the prophet joel it was sitting there
[1:00:18] in the word for year after year
[1:00:20] people knew it was there they knew it
[1:00:22] was written but nobody knew what to do
[1:00:24] with it
[1:00:25] can the church say man so god in
[1:00:28] unfolding things to us
[1:00:31] he is smarter than us he is bigger than
[1:00:33] us
[1:00:34] he's bigger than the devil he's bigger
[1:00:36] than your problem he's bigger than your
[1:00:38] situation
[1:00:38] he's bigger than your triumph he
[1:00:40] understands how he wants this thing to
[1:00:43] unfold up
[1:00:44] and to ensure that no devil could stop
[1:00:46] it he does things a certain way
[1:00:48] he moves a certain way he operates a
[1:00:51] certain way
[1:00:51] can the church say amen blessed be the
[1:00:55] name of the lord so we know that moses
[1:00:58] was caught up in mount sinai for forty
[1:01:01] days and forty nights he was there
[1:01:03] and god was communion communing with his
[1:01:05] servant moses
[1:01:07] hallelujah we read this uh in bible
[1:01:09] study as well
[1:01:10] in the last bible study and this is in
[1:01:12] exodus 24
[1:01:14] hallelujah and moses went up into the
[1:01:16] mount this is verse 15 and the cloud
[1:01:18] covered the mount
[1:01:19] and the glory of the lord aboard upon
[1:01:22] mount sinai
[1:01:23] and the cloud covered it six days and
[1:01:25] seven day he called moses into the midst
[1:01:27] of the cloud
[1:01:28] and the sight of the glory of the lord
[1:01:30] was like devouring fire
[1:01:32] on the top of the mount in the eyes of
[1:01:34] the children of israel
[1:01:36] and moses went into the midst of the
[1:01:38] cloud and got him
[1:01:39] into the mount and moses was in a mount
[1:01:41] 40 days and 40 nights
[1:01:43] what did god call moses aside for for
[1:01:46] all those days under that anointing
[1:01:48] it was to show moses what had to happen
[1:01:51] to reveal to moses what had to take
[1:01:53] place
[1:01:54] god wasn't leaving into accident he
[1:01:56] wasn't leaving it to chance
[1:01:57] he was given specific instructions
[1:01:59] because the work of redemption had to
[1:02:01] continue
[1:02:02] he was not going to leave man without a
[1:02:04] way to get back to fellowship
[1:02:05] he was not going to leave man without a
[1:02:07] way to get back into relationship
[1:02:09] he was not going to leave man without a
[1:02:10] way of redemption he
[1:02:12] wasn't going to leave man without a plan
[1:02:14] and a process
[1:02:15] and a procedure and an approach so he
[1:02:18] didn't want man to come up with his own
[1:02:20] thing he didn't want man to come up with
[1:02:22] his own way of worship
[1:02:23] he didn't want man to invent his own
[1:02:25] strategy or come up with his own system
[1:02:28] or sit down and plan what he wanted god
[1:02:31] in his mind
[1:02:32] knew what he wanted up he always knew
[1:02:35] what he wanted
[1:02:36] he's not now deciding what he wants he
[1:02:38] knows what he wants up he knows how he
[1:02:40] wants you to worship
[1:02:42] he knows how he wants you to live he
[1:02:44] knows how he wants you to overcome
[1:02:45] he knows that your family has got to
[1:02:47] come back he knows that the power of sin
[1:02:50] has got to be broken from your life he
[1:02:52] knows that sickness
[1:02:54] can't have a grip on you until the line
[1:02:56] is crossed
[1:02:57] there's a line that the devil can't pass
[1:02:59] up that is a line that sin cannot pass
[1:03:01] there's a line that sickness cannot pass
[1:03:04] and god knows it
[1:03:05] before you even hear he knew it before
[1:03:08] you even born he called you
[1:03:09] before you even knew yourself can the
[1:03:11] church say amen
[1:03:14] [Music]
[1:03:15] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[1:03:18] read it in bible study
[1:03:20] exodus 25 and brother overread this and
[1:03:22] the lord spake unto moses i'm not going
[1:03:24] to go into all of it i'm just laying the
[1:03:25] background
[1:03:26] speak unto the churn of israel and he
[1:03:29] began to explain
[1:03:30] about the tabernacle and the building of
[1:03:32] the tabernacle
[1:03:34] we know exodus 25 exodus 26
[1:03:37] exodus 27 all of it is laying out the
[1:03:40] tabernacle
[1:03:41] and the priesthood and how they have to
[1:03:43] live and how they have to do the
[1:03:44] sacrifice
[1:03:45] and what they must have if you say blue
[1:03:47] it's blue if you say purple it's purple
[1:03:49] if you say gold is gold
[1:03:51] if you say what is wood whatever he said
[1:03:53] it's the way to do it
[1:03:54] you can bring what you want and say this
[1:03:56] is all i have
[1:03:57] it was whatever god said that's what he
[1:04:00] wanted
[1:04:00] the approach to the sacrifice was the
[1:04:03] way he wanted it
[1:04:04] whatever he said you had to do it that
[1:04:07] way
[1:04:09] can the church say amen so the way back
[1:04:12] to eden
[1:04:13] was by the altar and truly altar
[1:04:16] but the only way for man to get into
[1:04:19] communion with god
[1:04:20] god had to have a priesthood that was
[1:04:22] established
[1:04:23] because the priest had to perform the
[1:04:25] sacrifice you couldn't just get up and
[1:04:27] do your own sacrifice
[1:04:29] anybody with me this morning he
[1:04:31] established a priesthood
[1:04:32] so that the priests we know it once a
[1:04:35] year would go and make a sacrifice for
[1:04:37] the people
[1:04:37] they would make a sacrifice for
[1:04:39] themselves they would make a sacrifice
[1:04:41] for the people isn't that right
[1:04:43] so this establishing of the priesthood
[1:04:45] was very critical to god's plan
[1:04:49] but even before we reach exodus 24 25-36
[1:04:54] rewind the tape and in exodus 19
[1:04:57] verse 3 god says so in verse 3 and moses
[1:05:01] went
[1:05:02] up unto god and the lord called unto him
[1:05:04] out of the mountain saying thus
[1:05:06] shall thou say to the house of israel
[1:05:09] and tell the children of israel
[1:05:10] you have seen what i did unto the
[1:05:12] egyptians
[1:05:14] and how i bear you on eagle's wings and
[1:05:16] brought you unto myself
[1:05:19] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[1:05:21] indeed
[1:05:22] and keep my covenant then ye shall be a
[1:05:26] peculiar treasure
[1:05:28] oh hallelujah unto me above all people
[1:05:31] for all the earth is mine isn't that
[1:05:33] right and
[1:05:34] ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests
[1:05:40] so there was a prophecy hovering over
[1:05:42] them to be a
[1:05:43] kingdom of priests and an holy nation
[1:05:47] these are the words which thou shalt
[1:05:49] speak unto the children of israel
[1:05:52] so there's a prophecy hovering over them
[1:05:54] to be a kingdom of priests
[1:05:56] it's worse to them because they don't
[1:05:58] understand how this is going to unfold
[1:06:01] they don't understand how this is going
[1:06:02] to come to pass
[1:06:04] because at the time that god has given
[1:06:06] moses this and moses speaking to these
[1:06:08] people
[1:06:09] the israel has no king
[1:06:12] they can't call themselves a kingdom
[1:06:15] there has been no priesthood established
[1:06:17] but there's a prophecy hanging over them
[1:06:19] ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests
[1:06:23] no king yet no high priest yet
[1:06:26] but ye shall be unto me a kingdom of
[1:06:28] priests and that's how god always
[1:06:30] operates
[1:06:31] it doesn't matter what you have now it
[1:06:33] doesn't matter what you're seeing with
[1:06:34] your eyes
[1:06:35] god could prophesy over you when there's
[1:06:38] nothing around you to support the
[1:06:39] prophecy
[1:06:40] because he sees beyond you he sees
[1:06:42] beyond the present tense he sees beyond
[1:06:44] your present problem
[1:06:46] he shall be unto me a kingdom of priests
[1:06:48] just like he spoke to abraham you're
[1:06:50] gonna have a son
[1:06:51] there's no evidence of sonship there's
[1:06:53] no evidence to sarah there's no evidence
[1:06:56] to abraham
[1:06:56] but that doesn't stop the prophecy
[1:07:00] oh hallelujah when god says you're going
[1:07:03] to have the holy ghost
[1:07:04] when he says you're going to have a
[1:07:05] revival when he says you're going to get
[1:07:07] a breakthrough
[1:07:08] when he says you're going to have joy
[1:07:09] unspeakable and full of glory
[1:07:12] he's not speaking to your situation he's
[1:07:14] not speaking based on what you see
[1:07:16] he's speaking in prophetic knowing what
[1:07:19] will happen
[1:07:20] knowing what will unfold
[1:07:23] can the church say amen so israel is on
[1:07:25] the prophecy
[1:07:26] they have no king they have no high
[1:07:29] priest
[1:07:29] but god already spoke about a kingdom of
[1:07:32] priests or kingdom of priests
[1:07:34] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:07:36] lord
[1:07:40] and god is beginning to drop certain
[1:07:42] things to them
[1:07:43] to prepare for this kingdom not any kind
[1:07:46] of kingdom
[1:07:47] not a kingdom but just kings and
[1:07:48] subjects for the kingdom of priests
[1:07:51] because in this kingdom of priests will
[1:07:53] be priest kings
[1:07:57] hallelujah a kingdom made up of priests
[1:08:02] and those priests will also be kings
[1:08:06] hallelujah these kings were reported a
[1:08:08] king of kings
[1:08:10] and these priests will be accountable to
[1:08:12] a high priest
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:14] but it'll be a kingdom of priests what
[1:08:17] kingdom do you belong to
[1:08:18] i belong to a kingdom of priests
[1:08:21] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:23] this worldly kingdom can't hold me this
[1:08:25] kingdom of the world is not my home
[1:08:27] i belong to a heavenly kingdom a kingdom
[1:08:30] of priests
[1:08:35] priests and king rulership and holiness
[1:08:39] rulership and sanctification rulership
[1:08:42] and living in order rulership unable to
[1:08:45] perform the sacrifice
[1:08:47] authority and power power and the
[1:08:50] ability
[1:08:50] to stand as a representative for me and
[1:08:53] my house
[1:08:54] i'm a priest i'm a king don't you know
[1:08:57] who you are
[1:08:58] that you are born to be a king born to
[1:09:00] be a priest
[1:09:01] and that's why the devil hates you so
[1:09:02] much because we are race of priests
[1:09:05] kings no other people like this people
[1:09:08] no other church like this church can the
[1:09:10] church say man
[1:09:13] i'm trying to build into something are
[1:09:14] you with me this morning
[1:09:16] that's why it's a royal priesthood
[1:09:19] because his king
[1:09:20] priest is a royal priesthood no other
[1:09:22] priesthood has been like this priesthood
[1:09:27] in that same exodus 19 which we read
[1:09:30] which says ye shall be unto me a kingdom
[1:09:32] of priests
[1:09:33] and a holy nation by verse 22 and this
[1:09:37] is where i want to kind of
[1:09:38] kind of drill down a little bit if you
[1:09:40] would have me this morning
[1:09:41] exodus 19 and verse 22 and let the
[1:09:44] priests also
[1:09:46] which come near to the lord sanctify
[1:09:48] themselves
[1:09:50] lest the lord break forth upon them
[1:09:56] so we see a situation where the priests
[1:09:58] which have to come near to the lord you
[1:10:00] can't come
[1:10:00] anyhow you can't come any way you want
[1:10:04] to
[1:10:05] you have to come sanctified
[1:10:09] you have to come with your life in order
[1:10:12] because you are
[1:10:12] a priest because if you don't come right
[1:10:16] god will break forth upon you
[1:10:20] so it is not just a sacrifice to be
[1:10:22] accepted but the priests also have to be
[1:10:24] accepted with how the priest lives and
[1:10:27] how the priest walks and
[1:10:29] how the priest talks and how sanctified
[1:10:31] their life is as a priest
[1:10:34] so this is what god was laying down at
[1:10:35] the time for the aaronic priesthood
[1:10:38] they didn't know then that they were
[1:10:40] just a type or a shadow or an example
[1:10:43] of a priesthood to come because in that
[1:10:46] day only certain people could be a
[1:10:48] priest
[1:10:49] but in our day it's different you are
[1:10:52] all priests so the sanctification and
[1:10:55] the walk and the talk and the life
[1:10:58] you are also held to that same standard
[1:11:00] you can go where you want to go you can
[1:11:02] do what you want to do you can live how
[1:11:04] you want to live you can
[1:11:06] act the way you want to act because you
[1:11:08] are
[1:11:09] kings and priests because of your
[1:11:12] kingship you have to act like royalty
[1:11:15] you have to act because you understand
[1:11:17] that you're a king and you understand
[1:11:19] your authority and you
[1:11:20] understand you have a royal lineage and
[1:11:22] you understand where you come from and
[1:11:24] understand that
[1:11:25] nowhere performed against you could
[1:11:27] prosper because you are a king and you
[1:11:29] have authority
[1:11:31] because of your lineage because who your
[1:11:33] father is
[1:11:34] because of your relationship with the
[1:11:36] king of kings and as a priest
[1:11:38] you can't stand what is not holy you are
[1:11:41] bothered you are you are sick of the
[1:11:42] things of this world
[1:11:44] because you are priests and and around
[1:11:46] you are bells that are shaken holy holy
[1:11:48] holy
[1:11:49] holy is the lord god almighty holy holy
[1:11:52] holy
[1:11:52] where you walk is holy holy holy holy
[1:11:54] holy lord god almighty
[1:11:56] you are careful with what you say you
[1:11:58] are careful with what you do you are
[1:12:00] careful with how you live can the church
[1:12:03] say amen
[1:12:05] we are building into something in exodus
[1:12:08] 28 the bible says
[1:12:13] this is god's instruction to moses
[1:12:15] exodus 28 and verse 1
[1:12:17] and take thou unto thee aaron thy
[1:12:20] brother
[1:12:21] and his sons with him from among the
[1:12:24] children of israel
[1:12:25] that he may minister in unto me in the
[1:12:28] priest's
[1:12:29] office even aaron
[1:12:33] nadab and abihu
[1:12:36] eliezer and ithama aaron's sons
[1:12:40] so god told moses call aaron and his
[1:12:42] four sons
[1:12:45] that he may minister unto me in the
[1:12:48] priest's office
[1:12:50] and verse 2 and thou shalt make holy
[1:12:52] garments
[1:12:53] for aaron so aaron can't dress how he
[1:12:55] wants the dress
[1:12:57] thou shalt make holy garments for aaron
[1:13:00] thy brother for glory
[1:13:01] and for beauty
[1:13:04] hallelujah we're talking about the
[1:13:06] aaronic priesthood now so god is saying
[1:13:08] aaron is going to be a priest but as a
[1:13:10] priest and he and his sons they
[1:13:12] have to dress a certain way so that
[1:13:14] everybody will know that they are
[1:13:16] priests
[1:13:17] there will be no doubt about the fact
[1:13:19] that they are priests
[1:13:20] their walk will speak priests their talk
[1:13:23] will speak
[1:13:24] priests their lives will speak priests
[1:13:27] their dress will speak priests
[1:13:31] listen carefully and thou shalt speak
[1:13:34] unto all that are wise-hearted
[1:13:36] whom i have filled with the spirit of
[1:13:38] wisdom that they may make aaron's
[1:13:40] garments to consecrate him
[1:13:43] that he may minister unto me in the
[1:13:45] priest's office
[1:13:47] and these are the garments where they
[1:13:48] shall make a breastplate and an effort
[1:13:51] and a robe and a brighter coat a mitre
[1:13:55] and a girdle
[1:13:55] and they shall make holy garments for
[1:13:58] aaron thy brother
[1:13:59] and his sons that he may minister in
[1:14:02] unto me in the priest's office and they
[1:14:05] shall take gold
[1:14:06] and blue and purple and scarlet and fine
[1:14:09] linen
[1:14:10] and they shall make the effort of gold
[1:14:12] of blue
[1:14:13] and of purple of scarlet and fine
[1:14:16] twine linen not any kind of linen but
[1:14:19] fine twine linen
[1:14:21] with cunning work so he said get the
[1:14:23] skilled workers
[1:14:25] because this priesthood is so important
[1:14:27] that there are specific colors tied to
[1:14:29] the priesthood
[1:14:30] there's a specific dress tied to the
[1:14:32] priesthood there's a specific
[1:14:34] way that this comment must be put
[1:14:36] together for
[1:14:37] the priesthood anybody with me we're
[1:14:40] building into something
[1:14:41] it shall have two shoulder pieces
[1:14:44] thereof joined at the two
[1:14:46] edges thereof and so it shall be joined
[1:14:48] together
[1:14:49] and the curious girdle of the ephod
[1:14:52] which is upon it shall be of the same
[1:14:55] according to the work thereof even of
[1:14:57] gold
[1:14:58] of blue and purple and scarlet
[1:15:01] and fine twine linen and thou shall take
[1:15:04] two onyx stones
[1:15:06] and grave on them the names of the
[1:15:08] children of israel
[1:15:09] six of their names and one stone and the
[1:15:12] other names under
[1:15:13] of the rest on the other stone according
[1:15:16] to their birth
[1:15:17] so don't mix up the order of put don't
[1:15:19] arrange it how you want to arrange it
[1:15:22] don't come to church how you want to
[1:15:23] come to church don't approach this
[1:15:25] gospel the way you want to do it
[1:15:27] god has an order he has an approach this
[1:15:30] is a priestly office
[1:15:31] and we are called in this hour for our
[1:15:34] priestly office
[1:15:37] oh hallelujah
[1:15:43] verse 11 with the work of an engraver in
[1:15:46] stone
[1:15:47] like the engravings of a signet thou
[1:15:50] shalt engrave the two stones
[1:15:52] with the names of the children of israel
[1:15:54] thou shalt make them to be set in ouches
[1:15:57] of gold
[1:15:57] and thou shall put the two stones upon
[1:15:59] the shoulders of the ephod
[1:16:01] for stones of memorial unto the children
[1:16:04] of israel
[1:16:05] and aaron shall bear their names before
[1:16:07] the lord upon his two
[1:16:09] shoulders for a memorial and thou shall
[1:16:11] make ouches of gold
[1:16:12] and two chains of pure gold at the ends
[1:16:15] of
[1:16:16] rhythm work shall don't make them and
[1:16:18] fasten the reverend chains to the ultras
[1:16:21] and thou shall make the breastplate of
[1:16:22] judgment with cunning work
[1:16:25] after the work of the ephod thou shall
[1:16:27] make it of gold
[1:16:29] of blue of purple and of scarlet
[1:16:32] and a fine twine lineage shall thou make
[1:16:34] it
[1:16:35] four square it shall be being doubled a
[1:16:38] span shall be the land thereof
[1:16:40] and a span shall be the bread thereof
[1:16:42] and thou shalt set in its settings of
[1:16:44] stone
[1:16:45] even four rows of stones the first four
[1:16:48] shall be sadius
[1:16:49] a topaz and a cabuncle this shall be the
[1:16:52] first row
[1:16:52] and the second row shall be an emerald a
[1:16:55] sapphire
[1:16:56] and a diamond and a turtle a lager and a
[1:16:58] cat and an amethyst
[1:17:00] and the fourth row of burial this is
[1:17:02] god's instructions you know
[1:17:06] and you want to come to church how you
[1:17:08] want to come to church
[1:17:10] live how you want to live and god has
[1:17:12] taken care
[1:17:13] of the details of this office of the
[1:17:15] priesthood anybody with me
[1:17:18] so i'm going to move on a bit from that
[1:17:19] just so you get it and then by by the t
[1:17:22] and all in exodus 20 it goes on by the
[1:17:25] time exodus 29
[1:17:26] god gives specific instructions
[1:17:30] and this is the thing that thou shalt do
[1:17:32] unto them to hallow them
[1:17:34] to minister unto me in the priest's
[1:17:36] office take
[1:17:37] one young bullock and two rams without
[1:17:39] blemish
[1:17:40] and unleavened bread and cakes
[1:17:42] unleavened tempered with oil and wafers
[1:17:44] unleavened anointed with oil of wheat
[1:17:47] and flour
[1:17:47] and he goes on and by the time he
[1:17:50] reached exodus 30.
[1:17:52] anybody with me we reach the altar
[1:17:55] and gods give specific instructions
[1:17:58] about the altar
[1:18:00] exodus 30 and verse 7 and iran shall
[1:18:03] burn their own sweet incense
[1:18:05] every morning not the mornings if he
[1:18:09] like it
[1:18:10] not the mornings he gets up early enough
[1:18:12] every morning
[1:18:14] when he dresses the lambs he shall burn
[1:18:16] incense upon it
[1:18:18] and when aaron lighted the lambs at the
[1:18:20] evening he shall burn incense upon it
[1:18:22] and
[1:18:22] over touch on this last week a perpetual
[1:18:25] incense before the lord
[1:18:26] throughout your generations in other
[1:18:28] words this should not stop
[1:18:30] this should keep on going verse 9
[1:18:34] he shall offer no strange incense
[1:18:36] thereon
[1:18:39] no burn sacrifice no meat offering
[1:18:43] neither shall you pour drink offering
[1:18:45] thereon and aaron shall make an
[1:18:47] atonement upon the horns of it once a
[1:18:49] year
[1:18:49] with the blood of the sin offering of
[1:18:51] atonements once in a year
[1:18:53] shall we make atonement upon it
[1:18:54] throughout your generations
[1:18:56] it is most holy unto the lord
[1:18:59] i want to pause at exodus 30 verse 9 he
[1:19:02] shall offer no strange incense thereon
[1:19:06] strange incense
[1:19:12] the instructions that were given in
[1:19:14] exodus 28
[1:19:16] were fulfilled in leviticus chapter 8.
[1:19:21] so if you compare exodus 28 to leviticus
[1:19:25] 8
[1:19:25] you will see this parallel one bull two
[1:19:28] rams
[1:19:29] basket of unleavened bread you will see
[1:19:31] aaron and his sons have to wash
[1:19:34] and put on the priestly garments the
[1:19:36] bull has to be offered as a sin offering
[1:19:38] and the parallel is there
[1:19:40] but i want to go to leviticus 10
[1:19:43] to verse 1. so this is after
[1:19:47] the appointment and the placing of the
[1:19:50] priesthood
[1:19:52] leviticus 10 and verse 1 and nadab and
[1:19:55] abihu
[1:19:56] the sons of iran took
[1:19:59] either of them his censor and put fire
[1:20:02] therein and put
[1:20:04] incense thereon and offered strange fire
[1:20:07] before the lord
[1:20:09] which he commanded them not so as a
[1:20:13] priest so these are priests we're
[1:20:14] talking about now
[1:20:17] so god was very clear priests had to
[1:20:19] come from the tribe of levites
[1:20:22] and these priests and there's a special
[1:20:24] responsibility
[1:20:25] of the sons of aaron and aaron and his
[1:20:27] house
[1:20:28] as the chief levites if you want to say
[1:20:30] that of the house of the high priest
[1:20:32] and he's a two now of iran's sons
[1:20:37] nadab and abihu the sons of iran
[1:20:41] took either of them his censor and put
[1:20:44] fire therein
[1:20:45] and put incense there around and offered
[1:20:47] strange fire
[1:20:49] the bible didn't tell us what the fire
[1:20:51] was they just said it was strange
[1:20:54] before the lord which he commanded them
[1:20:56] not
[1:20:58] and they went out fire from the lord and
[1:21:00] devoured them and they died before the
[1:21:02] lord
[1:21:04] so i want us to see this friends israel
[1:21:07] is now being instructed on the
[1:21:08] priesthood and the tabernacle
[1:21:10] and then not too long after that you see
[1:21:13] two
[1:21:14] sons of aaron approaching things in a
[1:21:17] way that they should not approach it
[1:21:20] and israel is shaken when fire goes from
[1:21:22] the lord and devoured them and he died
[1:21:24] before the lord
[1:21:25] and moses said unto aaron this is it
[1:21:27] that the lord speak
[1:21:29] saying i will be sanctified in them that
[1:21:32] come nigh me
[1:21:35] and before all the people i will be
[1:21:37] glorified and aaron held his peace
[1:21:43] so church i'm challenging us because we
[1:21:45] are priests and kings
[1:21:48] be very careful in this hour because the
[1:21:51] closer we get to
[1:21:52] this climax that we are living and we
[1:21:54] are walking into and we read it in the
[1:21:56] book of revelations
[1:21:57] when that book was taken they sang a new
[1:22:00] song
[1:22:02] that we are made kings and priests and
[1:22:05] as a priest we have to walk a certain
[1:22:07] way
[1:22:09] and moses called michelle and elsa found
[1:22:11] the sons of uzielda's uncle of aaron
[1:22:14] and senator them carrie come near carry
[1:22:16] your bridge in from before the sanctuary
[1:22:18] out of the camp live these dead boys out
[1:22:23] does this remind you of ananias and
[1:22:25] sapphira
[1:22:27] two people there in the old testament
[1:22:29] strange incense offered
[1:22:31] ananias and sapphira the two of them
[1:22:33] come and lie before the holy ghost
[1:22:37] and they went there and carried them in
[1:22:38] their coats they're still
[1:22:40] in their coats out of the camp as moses
[1:22:43] had said
[1:22:45] can the church say amen no i want to
[1:22:48] draw your attention to this
[1:22:52] were the oldest of iran's four sons god
[1:22:55] made a promise to aaron that you and
[1:22:57] your sons will be the ones responsible
[1:22:59] for this
[1:23:00] but the strange fire they burnt didn't
[1:23:04] change
[1:23:06] the covenant that god had and his word
[1:23:09] about how you approach him
[1:23:12] everyone couldn't say but lord he
[1:23:13] promised me my sons would do this
[1:23:17] they offered strange incense strange
[1:23:20] fire these same sons were privileged
[1:23:24] to be with moses and their father along
[1:23:27] with the others
[1:23:28] to mount sinai so in exodus 24 i'm
[1:23:31] laying this foundation
[1:23:33] in exodus 24 this is before moses went
[1:23:36] up
[1:23:36] to get the instructions and he said unto
[1:23:39] moses come
[1:23:40] up unto the lord thou and iran nail up
[1:23:42] and abu
[1:23:43] and seventy of the elders of israel and
[1:23:46] worship he
[1:23:46] are far off so these two boys were there
[1:23:50] they were part of the elite club as it
[1:23:53] were
[1:23:54] who were close to moses
[1:23:58] when the whole of israel
[1:24:01] it's gathered to one side aaron and his
[1:24:03] sons
[1:24:05] these two sons were there as witnesses
[1:24:10] in exodus 24 verse 9 then went up moses
[1:24:14] and iran nadab and abihu and
[1:24:18] 70 of the elders of israel and they saw
[1:24:21] the god of israel
[1:24:23] these two priests who offered strange
[1:24:25] incense they saw
[1:24:26] the god of israel they had an experience
[1:24:31] and there was under his feet as it were
[1:24:33] a paved work of a sapphire stone
[1:24:35] and as it were the body of heaven in his
[1:24:37] clearness and upon the nobles
[1:24:40] of the children of israel he laid not
[1:24:42] his hand
[1:24:43] also they saw god and did eat and drink
[1:24:46] and the lord senator moses come up so
[1:24:49] nadab and abihu
[1:24:51] had been called they had witnessed they
[1:24:53] had experience
[1:24:54] they had eaten before the lord they had
[1:24:56] stood next to moses
[1:24:59] and god killed them the moment they
[1:25:01] offered strange incense
[1:25:04] the moment they came and offered a
[1:25:06] sacrifice that god said don't offer it
[1:25:08] that way
[1:25:09] i want to nail down you have to
[1:25:11] understand how serious this priest is
[1:25:13] done walking around saying i'm a king
[1:25:15] and i'm a priest and i'm a royal
[1:25:17] priesthood
[1:25:17] this is not a statement friends it's a
[1:25:20] life
[1:25:21] it's a testimony it's a walk with god
[1:25:24] that has to stand up to the word of god
[1:25:26] you couldn't say well lord
[1:25:28] he was with you right there on the
[1:25:29] mountain
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:34] we don't know how long they had been
[1:25:36] ordained as priests
[1:25:41] but it would not have been too long they
[1:25:42] were operating
[1:25:44] the bible doesn't tell us exactly what
[1:25:46] was strange about their offering
[1:25:48] but it just says it was strange and it
[1:25:51] was what the lord had commanded them to
[1:25:53] not do
[1:25:56] no wonder the prophet said full
[1:25:58] obedience to the entire word of god is
[1:26:00] what entitles you to the token
[1:26:03] they were ordained as priests they had
[1:26:05] walked with moses they were aaron's
[1:26:08] son and they still missed the message of
[1:26:11] the hour
[1:26:13] and as their office of priests they made
[1:26:15] a choice
[1:26:17] it was not an accident
[1:26:22] they sin by offering strange fire before
[1:26:25] the lord
[1:26:26] disobeying god's command
[1:26:33] there must have been some agreement
[1:26:36] between the two of them
[1:26:39] because for both of them to be killed by
[1:26:40] the pop well it meant they were
[1:26:42] complicit in each other's actions
[1:26:47] as a priest one could have said to the
[1:26:49] other that's not what god said
[1:26:51] i'm not going with you but the report
[1:26:53] agreed to do it
[1:26:57] how many times do we make decisions
[1:26:59] based on somebody else
[1:27:02] it's one thing to read this scripture
[1:27:03] and say nahab was guilty
[1:27:06] but they're both guilty they both did
[1:27:08] the same thing that was wrong
[1:27:13] and the act they did together they were
[1:27:15] also judged together for it
[1:27:19] not because somebody agrees with you or
[1:27:21] tells you it's okay makes it okay
[1:27:23] you have to check the word of god to see
[1:27:25] if this is a strange fire
[1:27:27] is this is this the way god wants me to
[1:27:29] live in this season
[1:27:30] this season has changed friends we have
[1:27:32] turned the corner the only way back to
[1:27:34] eden is by the altar
[1:27:36] and through the altar
[1:27:41] if there was an ever i want to
[1:27:42] understand the responsibility
[1:27:44] of your priestly role in the kingdom of
[1:27:46] god it's now
[1:27:50] can the church say amen
[1:27:53] what this highlights when you look at it
[1:27:55] friends under that aaronic priesthood
[1:27:58] you know there are many different jobs
[1:28:00] you could have
[1:28:02] even in the chives of israel some tribes
[1:28:04] were farming tribes some tribes were
[1:28:06] fishing tribes some tribes were rearing
[1:28:08] animals
[1:28:10] and it would have its own difficulties
[1:28:12] its own challenges the tribe of judah
[1:28:14] was known as a warrior tribe
[1:28:17] but all of a sudden the job of a priest
[1:28:21] and being born of the lion of the
[1:28:23] levites
[1:28:24] and being a son of iran was now one of
[1:28:27] the riskiest professions
[1:28:31] because if your walk was not right it
[1:28:33] was death
[1:28:35] if your life wasn't right it's death if
[1:28:38] your words are not right it's death
[1:28:40] if your offering is not right it's dead
[1:28:42] if you burn strange incense before the
[1:28:44] lord it's dead
[1:28:46] the most dangerous job was being a
[1:28:49] priest
[1:28:50] because god required the best he
[1:28:53] required his word
[1:28:55] he required his statutes he required his
[1:28:58] laws
[1:28:59] he required you to be understanding of
[1:29:01] who he was and what he was
[1:29:03] can the church say amen
[1:29:06] to be in the ironic priesthood he had to
[1:29:08] be born into the family you couldn't put
[1:29:10] in a job application
[1:29:12] you have to be born a levite
[1:29:15] you have to be born in the line of iran
[1:29:17] to be considered for a high priest
[1:29:19] and by the branham city believers though
[1:29:21] this every priest
[1:29:23] that was in the lineage of the
[1:29:24] priesthood knowed as soon as he stepped
[1:29:27] in behind
[1:29:28] into the priesthood listen he had a
[1:29:30] right to taste
[1:29:31] a bite of the original manna that fell
[1:29:34] in the beginning
[1:29:35] so not only was there a sacredness and a
[1:29:38] consecration to being a priest
[1:29:40] but there were blessings and privileges
[1:29:42] of being a priest
[1:29:44] there are certain things you had access
[1:29:45] to he could have a bite as soon as he
[1:29:48] was ordained in the priesthood
[1:29:49] he could taste the original manna how
[1:29:52] beautiful that is of the holy spirit
[1:29:54] our sustaining strength to carry the
[1:29:57] church on
[1:29:58] if they fail to eat the manna they died
[1:30:00] and if we fail to eat on the holy ghost
[1:30:02] we die if we fail to pray through daily
[1:30:05] all the time
[1:30:06] and keep under the blood you'll wither
[1:30:09] up and die
[1:30:10] in your christian experience can the
[1:30:12] church say
[1:30:13] man oh this is not a kind of
[1:30:16] jump for joy kind of message but we are
[1:30:19] dealing with going to the golden altar
[1:30:21] we are dealing with getting right with
[1:30:23] god we are dealing with coming back to
[1:30:24] calvary
[1:30:25] coming back to the cross we're dealing
[1:30:27] with not having all 10 grudges and
[1:30:29] leaving your burdens and leaving your
[1:30:31] cares behind you and
[1:30:33] living a life holy holy holy holy holy
[1:30:36] holy
[1:30:37] that's what a saint is the sanctified
[1:30:39] ones you are called to be sanctified you
[1:30:42] are called to receive the holy ghost
[1:30:43] you are called to be adopted you are
[1:30:45] called for a super church
[1:30:47] a perfect church but i brought him to
[1:30:49] the church that sin cannot stay in that
[1:30:51] church
[1:30:55] blessed be the name of the lord and god
[1:30:58] instituted it
[1:31:00] in that mosaic covenant for that ironic
[1:31:03] priesthood
[1:31:04] or levitical priesthood the office of
[1:31:06] the high priest
[1:31:07] so that the people would have someone to
[1:31:09] offer sacrifices on their behalf
[1:31:11] and represent them in the presence of
[1:31:13] god that old covenant
[1:31:16] provided a sacrificial system in which
[1:31:18] the blood of bulls and goats
[1:31:20] at least temporarily enabled them to
[1:31:22] remain in fellowship with god
[1:31:24] the old covenant under moses was filled
[1:31:27] with grace and mercy
[1:31:28] long suffering and love they would just
[1:31:31] wait patiently
[1:31:32] when the high priest would go in to
[1:31:34] offer the sacrifice once a year
[1:31:36] they would just wait and wait and wait
[1:31:38] to see if god accepted the sacrifice
[1:31:40] and we know that god that that that they
[1:31:43] would tie
[1:31:44] up rope around them so that if they
[1:31:46] don't hear the sound coming out
[1:31:48] they could pull the body out from inside
[1:31:51] of there because no man could go in
[1:31:53] there
[1:31:53] who wasn't qualified to go in there
[1:31:56] anybody with me this morning you
[1:31:58] couldn't just
[1:31:58] walk into there you couldn't just see
[1:32:00] well i'm a israelite oh i'm a levite it
[1:32:02] wasn't good enough you had to meet the
[1:32:04] requirements
[1:32:05] till we go into the holy of holies isn't
[1:32:08] that right
[1:32:08] can the church say amen but that whole
[1:32:11] system
[1:32:12] was a flawed system it was a temporary
[1:32:15] system you catch them
[1:32:18] our shameless brother over i said could
[1:32:19] you imagine that god
[1:32:21] knew that this system would be temporary
[1:32:24] but god didn't just have it anyhow even
[1:32:27] though it was temporary
[1:32:28] he still established how to do the
[1:32:30] tabernacle he still established how to
[1:32:32] do the clothes
[1:32:33] he still established the way they were
[1:32:35] going to do it and he knew
[1:32:37] that they were only doing it until he
[1:32:38] came come on somebody preached back to
[1:32:40] me
[1:32:40] and god didn't just let anything pass
[1:32:44] even though the time was not there yet
[1:32:46] for him to do the work as a
[1:32:48] great high priest he said i still want
[1:32:50] you to live right
[1:32:51] i still want you to approach it sacred i
[1:32:53] still want you to come to god the right
[1:32:55] way
[1:32:57] god knew all along what was going to
[1:32:59] happen
[1:33:00] but he still took time i want you to
[1:33:03] catch his friends
[1:33:04] how god operates so different from us he
[1:33:07] was building a temporary system
[1:33:09] and god spent chapter after chapter by
[1:33:11] the pop well
[1:33:13] get blue and get this color and get this
[1:33:15] stone
[1:33:16] and put it this way and get the gold and
[1:33:19] god knew
[1:33:19] that when jesus comes on the earth that
[1:33:21] whole system would be ripped off and
[1:33:23] finished
[1:33:24] he would throw away that system but god
[1:33:26] didn't say
[1:33:27] let us do it any old hole come the
[1:33:29] church anyhow you want
[1:33:31] no it had to be done a certain way
[1:33:33] because god is holy
[1:33:34] his way is holy his tabernacle is holy
[1:33:38] oh hallelujah and the approach to god
[1:33:41] must be holy
[1:33:45] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:33:47] lord
[1:33:48] oh hallelujah we knew it was a
[1:33:51] substitute
[1:33:52] we knew it was temporary but god doesn't
[1:33:55] matter
[1:33:56] he is a perfect god he wants perfect
[1:33:58] worship
[1:33:59] he wants a perfect sacrifice he wants a
[1:34:01] perfect life
[1:34:10] god designed it to be temporary
[1:34:14] think about it friends god knew it was
[1:34:16] going to be temporary
[1:34:18] those two and eventually they didn't
[1:34:19] understand it then you know because they
[1:34:21] were just living their lives
[1:34:23] taking it i said come god says something
[1:34:24] that they don't understand they just
[1:34:26] leave it there
[1:34:27] they'll believe it they'll accept it or
[1:34:29] they'll leave it there and they they
[1:34:30] don't
[1:34:30] jesus come and say the spirit of the
[1:34:32] lord is upon me that was there all along
[1:34:35] but nobody knew what to do with it
[1:34:39] it was there all along it was written
[1:34:41] all along
[1:34:43] but nobody knew what it meant the spirit
[1:34:46] of the lord is upon me for he had
[1:34:47] anointed me and i could imagine
[1:34:50] since the days that were spoken and
[1:34:51] written others may have read it
[1:34:53] and said this is an inspiring quote it's
[1:34:55] an inspiring scripture
[1:34:57] there's got to be something to this we
[1:34:59] don't know what it is but one day we may
[1:35:00] know what it is
[1:35:02] anybody with me this morning but it had
[1:35:04] to be there
[1:35:05] because jesus had to be captured under
[1:35:07] there
[1:35:09] but when jesus came that's why when he
[1:35:12] was reading it brother pop well
[1:35:14] there was no opposition to it there was
[1:35:16] no question to it
[1:35:17] the spirit of the lord is upon me for he
[1:35:19] had anointed me to
[1:35:21] and bring the titles and and and all
[1:35:23] this stuff but when jesus said this day
[1:35:25] this scripture is fulfilled that is what
[1:35:28] caught the attention
[1:35:30] of the church because never before had
[1:35:32] anybody finished that scripture
[1:35:34] with that statement this was the first
[1:35:37] time that that scripture
[1:35:38] was being made present tense oh
[1:35:41] hallelujah
[1:35:42] it was laying in the message all along
[1:35:46] all along it was there all along it was
[1:35:48] there in the scrolls
[1:35:49] all along it was there in the book all
[1:35:51] along it was there
[1:35:52] but nobody knew what to do with it no
[1:35:55] wonder the prophet said rapturing fate
[1:35:57] is laying in this message the secret to
[1:36:00] leaving this place
[1:36:01] is laying into this message the secret
[1:36:04] to getting back to eden
[1:36:05] is laying in this message one day the
[1:36:08] right word will be spoken
[1:36:10] one day somebody will pick up from the
[1:36:13] prophet's message
[1:36:14] something
[1:36:16] [Music]
[1:36:18] laying there all along laying there all
[1:36:21] along
[1:36:22] the is laying there all along from the
[1:36:24] moment you were born
[1:36:26] that seed in you was there all along you
[1:36:28] didn't knew what it was
[1:36:30] you didn't understand what it was but
[1:36:31] there came a time
[1:36:33] there became a day there came an hour
[1:36:35] there came a minute
[1:36:36] when what was there all along suddenly
[1:36:39] spark
[1:36:40] suddenly come alive and a change took
[1:36:42] place in your life
[1:36:44] a change took place in your walk
[1:36:48] a change took place in your
[1:36:49] understanding a change took place in
[1:36:51] your awareness
[1:36:52] you didn't realize that you're a child
[1:36:54] of the king you didn't realize who your
[1:36:56] father is
[1:36:57] you didn't realize that you're a king
[1:36:59] you didn't know you were a priest
[1:37:01] but you can't be a king or you can't be
[1:37:03] a priest
[1:37:04] unless there's a seed in you of being a
[1:37:06] king
[1:37:07] of being a priest you can't respond to
[1:37:09] this message
[1:37:11] if there's no seed of a king in your
[1:37:13] soul you can't respond to this message
[1:37:15] if there's no seed of being a priest in
[1:37:18] your soul
[1:37:19] this is not for the church member this
[1:37:21] is not to the message believer
[1:37:23] this is for the sons of god who
[1:37:25] understand who they are
[1:37:27] understand where they come from
[1:37:32] come on now somebody help me this
[1:37:34] morning this is not for everybody
[1:37:36] this is not for the church this is not
[1:37:38] just for a believer
[1:37:40] this is for the seeds of god the royal
[1:37:43] seeds
[1:37:43] the true seed of abraham
[1:37:50] hallelujah give the lord a shout our
[1:37:53] praise
[1:37:54] give the lord some worship give the lord
[1:37:56] some worship
[1:37:58] you may be seated so god in his plan god
[1:38:02] in his mind
[1:38:03] god and understanding that the question
[1:38:06] that adam had in his heart
[1:38:08] because adam had tasted power he had
[1:38:10] tasted glory
[1:38:12] he had tasted dominion he had tasted
[1:38:14] kingship
[1:38:16] he had tasted all these things and when
[1:38:18] adam was kicked out of eden
[1:38:20] god had to have a way back he had to
[1:38:22] have a way to get adam back
[1:38:26] so god is unfolding his plan and he's
[1:38:28] unfolding it as he wants to unfold it
[1:38:31] he's unfolding it the way he sees to
[1:38:33] unfold it
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:37] and as each age passes he is revealing
[1:38:40] pieces of himself
[1:38:41] because it all has to make sense it'll
[1:38:44] be only at a certain time
[1:38:46] that somebody will put it together but
[1:38:48] it has to be done
[1:38:49] a certain way because if there's no
[1:38:51] precedent for it
[1:38:53] then god can't unveil it can the church
[1:38:55] say man
[1:38:56] so hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:38:59] lord
[1:39:03] and to show the progression of
[1:39:05] revelation
[1:39:07] paul the apostle paul he wrote to the
[1:39:10] corinthians
[1:39:11] and he would write to the corinthians
[1:39:13] the issues are dealing with the
[1:39:14] corinthians
[1:39:15] he would write to the philippians he
[1:39:16] issued a deal with the philippians
[1:39:18] he would write to the ephesians the
[1:39:20] issue delivered the ephesians
[1:39:25] the vast majority of what poor bring
[1:39:27] would be to the gentiles
[1:39:29] but there are certain things he
[1:39:30] addressed to the jews as well
[1:39:33] in his letter to the hebrews he is
[1:39:35] speaking to the hebrews
[1:39:38] anybody with me and he has to use with
[1:39:41] them language they would understand
[1:39:43] he would have to share things with them
[1:39:45] things they should know
[1:39:46] things they would have been taught if
[1:39:48] there's one thing
[1:39:50] that was known in those days was the
[1:39:52] scriptures
[1:39:53] they may not have known what it meant
[1:39:55] but they knew about it
[1:39:59] because they challenged you our fathers
[1:40:00] told us this he said
[1:40:03] and are they all dead
[1:40:08] the new scripture
[1:40:11] but they didn't really understand
[1:40:14] so paul in hebrews 4
[1:40:19] verse 14 understand he is speaking to
[1:40:23] hebrews and he's saying to them
[1:40:26] because the fact that he has to see it
[1:40:28] means that their
[1:40:29] understanding of what this is is not
[1:40:31] clear
[1:40:32] so as an apostle as a messenger as an
[1:40:34] anointed one
[1:40:36] he is bringing clarity to their
[1:40:37] spiritual experience
[1:40:40] to their journey and how they're living
[1:40:41] so that they can grow into maturity
[1:40:44] isn't that what the gospel is for to
[1:40:46] bring us to maturity
[1:40:47] to sharpen up our weak areas to help us
[1:40:50] see clara in the world what applies to
[1:40:52] us so we could be prepared to leave this
[1:40:53] place
[1:40:54] it's not just a half church and we have
[1:40:56] a good time but we come here to see what
[1:40:58] we need to work on
[1:41:01] so paul is right into each age this is
[1:41:04] what you need to work on
[1:41:06] we dealt with the corinthians in bible
[1:41:07] study
[1:41:10] each age god each each group each group
[1:41:13] each church
[1:41:14] paul d william but listen to his message
[1:41:16] to the hebrews
[1:41:18] seeing then hebrews 4 verse 14 that we
[1:41:22] have a great high priest
[1:41:25] he can't talk this high priest talk with
[1:41:27] the gentiles like that because
[1:41:29] they don't understand how priests do a
[1:41:30] jew would understand high priest
[1:41:33] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:41:35] priest that has passed into the heavens
[1:41:38] jesus the son of god let us hold fast
[1:41:40] our profession
[1:41:43] for we have not on high priest so he's
[1:41:45] making now a comparison
[1:41:48] to the high priest that they are used to
[1:41:51] for we have not and high priests which
[1:41:53] cannot be touched
[1:41:55] with the feeling of our infirmities
[1:42:00] he said this high piece of document is
[1:42:02] different
[1:42:04] it is not that he can be touched
[1:42:08] but was in all points tempted as we are
[1:42:10] yet without sin
[1:42:13] so he's beginning to make a distinction
[1:42:15] between this high priest is talking
[1:42:17] about
[1:42:18] and the high priest that they used to
[1:42:20] from aaron on down to the high priest
[1:42:22] that they know for all of their
[1:42:23] generations and every high priest will
[1:42:27] come after the lion i hear on all down
[1:42:29] to caiaphas and these fellas
[1:42:30] anybody with me this morning let us
[1:42:34] therefore come boldly
[1:42:36] unto the throne of grace that we may
[1:42:38] obtain mercy
[1:42:40] and find grace to help in time of need
[1:42:46] and then we go into hebrews 5 and this
[1:42:48] is relevant to us friends
[1:42:49] because god told moses that you will be
[1:42:52] a kingdom of priests
[1:42:54] and the way god told moses that moses
[1:42:57] expressed it this was said
[1:42:58] only to the children of israel so you
[1:43:01] and i
[1:43:01] could have no part in that priestly
[1:43:04] kingdom
[1:43:05] unless a way is made for us to access
[1:43:08] that priestly kingdom
[1:43:10] and unless you were born in the tribe of
[1:43:12] levites
[1:43:13] and unless you are of the sons of of of
[1:43:15] of aaron
[1:43:16] you can't just be a priest not even
[1:43:19] somebody from another tribe could be a
[1:43:20] priest
[1:43:21] if you weren't born the right place but
[1:43:23] god had to find a way
[1:43:25] to pick you and me to be part of this
[1:43:29] kingdom of priests
[1:43:39] anybody with me this morning you know
[1:43:41] where i'm going
[1:43:42] hebrews 5 1 for every priest
[1:43:46] taken from among men is ordained
[1:43:49] for men and things pertaining to god
[1:43:51] that he may offer both gifts and
[1:43:53] sacrifices for sins
[1:43:56] so paul is explaining what they know
[1:43:58] already
[1:44:00] he said who can have compassion on the
[1:44:02] ignorant he's describing
[1:44:03] the attributes of a priest and on them
[1:44:06] that are out of the way
[1:44:07] for that he himself also is compassed
[1:44:09] with infirmity
[1:44:11] so he seen a priest would have some
[1:44:12] level of compassion because the priests
[1:44:14] himself have his own challenges
[1:44:16] anybody with me and by reason here of he
[1:44:20] ought as for the people
[1:44:22] so also for himself to offer sins
[1:44:25] to offer for sins so he's saying the
[1:44:27] priests that you're used to
[1:44:29] they can't just even offer for you they
[1:44:30] have to offer for their sins first
[1:44:33] before they give him an offer for you so
[1:44:36] he's beginning to point out now
[1:44:38] clearly the issues with the aaronic
[1:44:40] priesthood
[1:44:41] or the levitical priesthood or the
[1:44:43] priesthood that they used to can the
[1:44:44] church say amen
[1:44:48] and no man taking this honor unto
[1:44:50] himself
[1:44:51] so so you can't make yourself a priest
[1:44:54] you can't say i'm feeling led i'm
[1:44:55] feeling priestess
[1:44:57] i wake up this morning and i feel the
[1:44:59] call to be a priest
[1:45:01] you couldn't be born in the tribe of god
[1:45:03] or naftali or whatever it all
[1:45:05] and say i feel to be a priest today i'm
[1:45:07] looking at elephant dealer physical
[1:45:08] priest and i
[1:45:09] really admire how they move and and i
[1:45:11] feel i have something you couldn't do
[1:45:13] that
[1:45:14] so paul is making clear no man taking
[1:45:17] this honor
[1:45:18] unto himself but that he is called of
[1:45:21] god
[1:45:21] as was aaron so paul is laying on
[1:45:25] clearly
[1:45:26] it was true aaron this order was called
[1:45:29] you can't vote yourself you can't
[1:45:30] nominate yourself somebody can't see
[1:45:32] that brother living right i think he's
[1:45:34] supposed to be a priest
[1:45:37] you can fast on a mountain for how much
[1:45:39] days you want
[1:45:41] unless you were called by god keep
[1:45:44] fasting but this priesthood
[1:45:46] wasn't for you anybody with me
[1:45:50] it was not by works it was my
[1:45:52] appointment
[1:45:53] it was not by resume it was my
[1:45:56] predestination
[1:45:58] [Applause]
[1:46:00] it was not by works it was by being
[1:46:02] called
[1:46:03] can the church say amen so paul is
[1:46:07] bringing clarity to people who should
[1:46:09] know these things
[1:46:10] they're aware of the scriptures they
[1:46:12] know the history but he's not showing
[1:46:14] them i know what you're used to but let
[1:46:15] me show you
[1:46:16] why this jesus is different
[1:46:22] verse 5 so also christ listen to this
[1:46:24] now
[1:46:25] glorified not himself to be made an high
[1:46:29] priest
[1:46:30] hallelujah he didn't choose this high
[1:46:33] priest
[1:46:33] so he said jesus didn't even choose his
[1:46:35] high priest but he said
[1:46:37] he that said unto him down at my son
[1:46:40] today have i begotten thee as he saith
[1:46:43] also in another place so paul is now
[1:46:46] quoting dull at a priest forever
[1:46:51] after the order of melchizedek
[1:46:54] hallelujah and in there
[1:46:56] paul slips in the credentials the
[1:46:59] access under which jesus could be called
[1:47:01] a priest can the church say amen
[1:47:04] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[1:47:06] offered a prayers and supplication with
[1:47:08] strong
[1:47:09] crying and tears unto him that was able
[1:47:11] to save him
[1:47:13] from death was heard in that he had
[1:47:14] feared though he will a son
[1:47:17] yet learn he obedient by the things
[1:47:19] which he suffered and being made perfect
[1:47:22] he became the author of eternal
[1:47:24] salvation unto all them that obey him
[1:47:26] called of god and high priest after the
[1:47:29] order
[1:47:30] of melchizedek
[1:47:33] now why is this important for those
[1:47:35] younger ones
[1:47:36] around us to find out about melchizedek
[1:47:39] you have to go back into genesis
[1:47:42] now the fact that paul is bringing this
[1:47:44] clarity it is not that they didn't know
[1:47:46] about mercy
[1:47:48] they just did not fit into the plan
[1:47:50] anybody with me
[1:47:52] because abraham would have had an
[1:47:53] encounter in genesis 14 verse 17
[1:47:58] and the king of sodom went out to meet
[1:48:00] him
[1:48:02] after his return from the slaughter of
[1:48:04] chadolama
[1:48:05] so abraham had just come back victorious
[1:48:07] from a slaughter
[1:48:08] and of the kings that were with him at
[1:48:09] the valley of chevy which is the king's
[1:48:12] deal
[1:48:12] and melchizedek king of salem brought
[1:48:15] forth bread and wine
[1:48:17] and he was the priest of the most high
[1:48:19] god and he blessed him
[1:48:22] and said blessed be abraham of the most
[1:48:25] high god
[1:48:26] possessor of heaven and earth and
[1:48:29] blessed be the most high god
[1:48:31] which had delivered thine enemies into
[1:48:33] thine hand
[1:48:34] and he gave him tight of all so abraham
[1:48:37] paid tights to melchizedek
[1:48:40] the fact that melchizedek blessed
[1:48:42] abraham according to
[1:48:44] ancient tradition and biblical and
[1:48:46] ancient practice
[1:48:47] meant that abraham realized that of the
[1:48:49] two of them mel kenny that had greater
[1:48:51] stature
[1:48:53] fathers were typically blessed sons
[1:48:55] seniors would bless
[1:48:58] juniors
[1:49:00] and there was just a mystery hanging
[1:49:01] there israel knew about it they didn't
[1:49:04] know what it meant
[1:49:06] they just knew abraham at this
[1:49:07] experience
[1:49:10] can the church say man
[1:49:14] abraham recognized melchizedek as his
[1:49:16] priest
[1:49:17] because he paid tithes to him
[1:49:22] so the jews that paul speaking to they
[1:49:25] would be aware of this now he's bringing
[1:49:26] it into the narrative
[1:49:28] now notice in scripture the only time
[1:49:31] melchizedek is mentioned
[1:49:33] within the old testament is this
[1:49:34] interaction with abraham
[1:49:36] and then in islam of david so in psalms
[1:49:39] 110
[1:49:41] the bible says and the lord
[1:49:44] said unto my lord sit thou at my right
[1:49:47] hand
[1:49:48] until i make thine enemies thy footstool
[1:49:52] psalms 110 verse one the lord capital l
[1:49:55] o r d
[1:49:57] said unto my lord sit down at my right
[1:50:01] hand
[1:50:03] until so there's a time limit i make
[1:50:06] that enemies thy footstool
[1:50:09] the lord said unto my lord so this is
[1:50:11] now god himself speaking unto
[1:50:13] my lord which is david's lord which is
[1:50:15] david's seed
[1:50:18] david's descendants so david is really
[1:50:21] relating a conversation
[1:50:26] between god and jesus my lord turn into
[1:50:29] my lord
[1:50:31] sit down at my right hand didn't when
[1:50:34] jesus raised me that go on your right
[1:50:35] hand
[1:50:37] sitting at the right hand is priestly
[1:50:39] office
[1:50:41] until for a period of time i make them
[1:50:44] enemies thy footstool
[1:50:45] that's the kingly office your enemy is
[1:50:48] your footstool
[1:50:50] verse 2 the lord shall send the rod of
[1:50:52] thy strength out of zion
[1:50:54] ruled out in the midst of thine enemies
[1:50:57] thy people shall be willing in the day
[1:50:59] of thy power
[1:51:00] in the beauties of holiness from the
[1:51:02] womb of the morning thou has due of thy
[1:51:04] ute
[1:51:05] the lord had sworn and will not repent
[1:51:08] listen
[1:51:09] this repent is not an apology this
[1:51:11] repentance can't take it back
[1:51:13] throw out a priest forever after the
[1:51:16] order of melchizedek
[1:51:20] can the church say amen so this is
[1:51:23] hanging there but nobody is connecting
[1:51:25] the dots
[1:51:26] and here it is paul in hebrews 7
[1:51:29] begins to now write in his letter for
[1:51:31] this melchizedek king of salem priest of
[1:51:34] the most high god
[1:51:35] who met abraham returning from the
[1:51:38] slaughter of the kings and blessed him
[1:51:40] so paul is now beginning to preach this
[1:51:42] thing are you with me this morning
[1:51:43] we're speaking about three priesthoods
[1:51:45] the aaronic priesthood the melchizedek
[1:51:47] priesthood
[1:51:48] and the royal priesthood for this
[1:51:50] melchizedek king of salem priests of the
[1:51:52] most high god
[1:51:53] who met abraham returning from the
[1:51:55] slaughter of the kings and blessed him
[1:51:57] to whom also abraham gave a tenth part
[1:52:00] of all he paid his tie to him
[1:52:02] first being by interpretation king of
[1:52:04] righteousness
[1:52:05] so he's given the names of this
[1:52:08] melchizedek
[1:52:09] he is by interpretation king of
[1:52:11] righteousness
[1:52:12] and after that also king of salem which
[1:52:15] is
[1:52:16] king of peace without father without
[1:52:19] mother
[1:52:20] without descent having neither beginning
[1:52:23] of days
[1:52:24] nor end of life but being made like unto
[1:52:27] the son of god abideth a priest
[1:52:29] continually
[1:52:30] now consider how great this man was
[1:52:33] unto whom even the patriarch gave the
[1:52:36] tent of the spoils
[1:52:38] this year is loadable power because
[1:52:40] abram is the father of nations
[1:52:42] so if abraham is a father of nations and
[1:52:45] jesus himself
[1:52:46] is called a son of abraham who would it
[1:52:48] be
[1:52:49] that abraham would have to pay attention
[1:52:51] to
[1:52:53] can the church say amen now consider how
[1:52:55] great this man was
[1:52:57] unto whom even the patriarch so he's
[1:52:59] like singing in a shocking statement
[1:53:01] even abraham
[1:53:02] abraham himself gave the tent of his
[1:53:04] spoils
[1:53:05] and go on and verily listen they that
[1:53:09] are of the sons of levi who received the
[1:53:12] office of the priesthood
[1:53:13] have a commandment to take tithes of the
[1:53:16] people
[1:53:16] according to the law that is of their
[1:53:19] brethren though
[1:53:20] they come out of the loins of abraham
[1:53:23] but he whose descent is not counted from
[1:53:27] them
[1:53:27] received tithes of abraham so he's
[1:53:29] saying this melchizedek
[1:53:31] who wasn't counted of the descendants
[1:53:35] but still received heights so that means
[1:53:38] you have to be bigger than the tribe
[1:53:39] believer
[1:53:40] you have to be bigger than the
[1:53:41] priesthood of iran anybody with freedom
[1:53:43] this morning
[1:53:47] and bless him that had the promises
[1:53:50] so if he's blessing abraham if he's
[1:53:52] receiving tithes from abraham
[1:53:54] oh hallelujah verse seven and with all
[1:53:57] contradiction
[1:53:58] listen the less is blessed of the better
[1:54:01] so it means that this melchizedek has to
[1:54:03] be really special to be blessed in
[1:54:05] abraham because if alta abraham
[1:54:07] came iran an altar abraham can be tribal
[1:54:09] levites and
[1:54:10] out of this thing who could it be that
[1:54:12] this melchizedek is to be blessing
[1:54:14] abraham in the first place
[1:54:15] [Music]
[1:54:18] and listen verse 8 and here men that die
[1:54:21] receive tithes
[1:54:22] but there he received them of whom it
[1:54:25] has witnessed
[1:54:26] that he live it and as i may say so levi
[1:54:29] listen so paul is now going deeper and
[1:54:31] they say even levi
[1:54:33] also who receive tights also pay tight
[1:54:36] in abraham
[1:54:38] so who would levi who is the priest and
[1:54:41] the line of the priests
[1:54:43] pay ties to it has to be an even higher
[1:54:45] priest
[1:54:46] can the church say amen for he was yet
[1:54:49] in the loins of his father
[1:54:51] when melchizedek met him i know you know
[1:54:53] this but let's let's make sure we get it
[1:54:55] right
[1:54:56] if therefore perfection will by the
[1:54:59] levitical priesthood
[1:55:01] for under it the people receive the law
[1:55:03] what further need was there
[1:55:05] that another piece should rise after the
[1:55:07] order of melchizedek's
[1:55:09] and not be called after the order of
[1:55:11] iran
[1:55:12] for the priesthood being changed there
[1:55:14] is made of necessity
[1:55:16] a change also of the law so he's saying
[1:55:19] this pre-setting that you know all these
[1:55:21] years has come to an
[1:55:22] end because of this jesus who was called
[1:55:25] of the order of melchizedek
[1:55:26] he come from a different tribe
[1:55:28] altogether can the church say amen
[1:55:32] listen verse 13 for he of whom these
[1:55:35] things are spoken pertaining to
[1:55:37] another tribe of which no man gave
[1:55:40] attendance at the altar
[1:55:42] so in other words pauline explained to
[1:55:44] them you know the law you know they
[1:55:46] command
[1:55:46] only those of a tribal levite of the
[1:55:50] levites
[1:55:51] could be a priest but just jesus was not
[1:55:53] from that tribe
[1:55:55] so what tribe is he from if he is a
[1:55:58] priest
[1:55:58] and not just a priest because even among
[1:56:01] the levites only the sons of iran
[1:56:03] could be high priests so where did jesus
[1:56:05] come from where is
[1:56:06] his pedigree where is his heritage for
[1:56:09] him to be a high priest like this high
[1:56:10] priest
[1:56:12] verse 14. so paul makes it clear for it
[1:56:15] is evident that our lord sprang
[1:56:17] out of judah
[1:56:20] of which tribe moses spake nothing
[1:56:24] concerning priesthood
[1:56:26] can the church say amen so it means that
[1:56:28] jesus is coming from
[1:56:29] a whole different level now can can the
[1:56:31] church say amen and yet
[1:56:33] far more evidence for that after the
[1:56:35] cemetery of melchizedek there arises
[1:56:38] another priest who is made not after the
[1:56:41] law of a carnal commandment
[1:56:43] but after the power of an endless life
[1:56:45] for he testified thou art a priest
[1:56:48] forever
[1:56:49] after the order of melchizedek for there
[1:56:52] is verily a disannuling of the
[1:56:54] commandment
[1:56:55] going before for the weakness and
[1:56:58] unprofitableness thereof
[1:57:00] for the law made nothing perfect but the
[1:57:03] bringing of a better hope did
[1:57:05] by the which we draw nigh unto god for
[1:57:08] in as much as not without an oat he was
[1:57:11] made priests
[1:57:12] for those priests were made without an
[1:57:14] old but this with an oat by him that
[1:57:16] sent unto him
[1:57:17] the lord swear and will not repent thou
[1:57:19] art a priest forever
[1:57:20] after the order of melchizedek by so
[1:57:23] much was jesus
[1:57:24] made authority of a better testament
[1:57:27] and they truly were many priests because
[1:57:30] they will not suffer to continue
[1:57:32] by reason of death but this man because
[1:57:35] he continued
[1:57:36] ever had an unchangeable priesthood
[1:57:40] wherefore he is able also listen
[1:57:43] to save them to the uttermost that come
[1:57:46] unto god by him
[1:57:47] seeing he ever live it to make
[1:57:50] intercession for them
[1:57:51] so paul is preaching now he really
[1:57:53] preached it he said those priests you
[1:57:54] know before would die
[1:57:56] and the next people come and they can
[1:57:57] only intercede for you once or twice or
[1:57:59] whatever it is
[1:58:00] but this priest because he don't die
[1:58:02] because he cannot die
[1:58:04] because he lives forever
[1:58:08] could make intercession for such
[1:58:11] and high priests became us
[1:58:14] who is holy harmless undefiled separate
[1:58:18] from sinners
[1:58:18] and made higher than the heavens who
[1:58:21] needeth not daily as
[1:58:22] those high priests to offer up sacrifice
[1:58:25] for his
[1:58:26] for his own sins and then for the people
[1:58:30] for this he did once when he offered for
[1:58:32] himself
[1:58:33] for the law make it men high priests
[1:58:35] which have infirmity
[1:58:36] but the word of oat which was since the
[1:58:38] lord make it a son who is consecrated
[1:58:40] forevermore can the church say amen
[1:58:43] everybody feeling fine
[1:58:45] so this melchizedek of which jesus was
[1:58:49] of the order of melchizedek
[1:58:51] this pre this priest that abraham met
[1:58:53] this high priest was none other than the
[1:58:55] lord jesus christ
[1:58:56] himself who came to set a precedent
[1:58:59] before
[1:59:00] he established the aaronic priesthood so
[1:59:02] that when he choose to come
[1:59:04] in the time he came nobody could say
[1:59:06] you're not from the tribal iran
[1:59:08] you're not from the tribal levite no he
[1:59:10] could say i'm from the order of
[1:59:11] melchizedek
[1:59:12] before abraham was i was before iran was
[1:59:16] i was before levi was i was before the
[1:59:19] priesthood was i was
[1:59:22] and whereas the priesthood you knew
[1:59:24] before had to be done a certain way
[1:59:26] because of what i did and because of who
[1:59:29] i am
[1:59:29] and because of the order of melchizedek
[1:59:31] i can now open the door
[1:59:33] for other people to be priests you don't
[1:59:36] need to be at a tribe and leave like no
[1:59:38] more to be a priest
[1:59:39] you don't need to be of the child of the
[1:59:41] sons of iran anymore
[1:59:42] to be a priest can the church say amen
[1:59:47] i'm not going to be too much longer with
[1:59:48] you
[1:59:52] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:59:55] mr brown said who is this bunch of
[1:59:57] melchizedek you know this and notice
[1:59:59] melchizedek did not offer any money he
[2:00:01] only offered bread and wine
[2:00:03] mercury was a priest of the most high
[2:00:05] the king of jerusalem
[2:00:07] it was then called salem oh my i can
[2:00:10] prove it
[2:00:10] jerusalem was for salem jerusalem it was
[2:00:14] first called jerusalem that's right
[2:00:15] which when it was in gentile possession
[2:00:18] and the king of jerusalem
[2:00:19] or salem which was meaning the king of
[2:00:22] peace
[2:00:22] the king of righteousness met abraham as
[2:00:25] he returned
[2:00:26] and he gave him communion bread and wine
[2:00:29] thousands of years or 100 years before
[2:00:31] bread and wine was an ordinance
[2:00:33] showing it was the lord jesus christ it
[2:00:35] was the same god
[2:00:36] changing mast it was the same god
[2:00:39] changing scenes
[2:00:40] in god's mind it's a whole place a whole
[2:00:43] drama
[2:00:44] of how we gonna destroy the enemy and
[2:00:46] raise up a kingdom of priests
[2:00:48] before they understood what was
[2:00:49] happening he was already doing his part
[2:00:52] to make a way possible for kings and
[2:00:54] priests in this day
[2:00:56] to be called
[2:01:00] [Applause]
[2:01:02] based on the order of melchizedek who
[2:01:04] was this great man with a random
[2:01:06] can the church him he was not only a
[2:01:08] king but he was a priest
[2:01:10] so melchizedek was a king priest he was
[2:01:12] a king priest
[2:01:13] so it's not an uncomfortable statement
[2:01:16] to say that we will be king priests
[2:01:18] hallelujah because melchizedek was a
[2:01:20] king priest
[2:01:21] hallelujah and we know it through the
[2:01:23] old testament the lines of the kings
[2:01:26] were separated from the lines of the
[2:01:27] priests the priests were only from the
[2:01:29] tribe of levite
[2:01:30] but you are different king kings of
[2:01:31] judah kings of this kingdom but when
[2:01:33] jesus come
[2:01:34] he was another king priest just like oh
[2:01:37] come on now
[2:01:42] and because he was a king priest he can
[2:01:44] now unlock the door
[2:01:46] for more king priests oh he can now
[2:01:48] unlock the door
[2:01:49] for a chosen generation a peculiar
[2:01:52] people
[2:01:52] a royal priesthood because he was the
[2:01:54] example
[2:01:55] [Applause]
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:59] to our people who were never people
[2:02:01] before when moses was speaking to them
[2:02:03] they thought they were the only ones
[2:02:05] who were under the covenant of the
[2:02:07] kingdom of priests but because of jesus
[2:02:10] now those who were never a people who
[2:02:12] were not of this tribe and that tribe
[2:02:14] could now be our people and get the same
[2:02:17] access because he tear the veil
[2:02:19] from top to bottom abolish your
[2:02:22] priesthood
[2:02:23] abolish that mosaic priesthood abolish
[2:02:26] the aaronic priesthood
[2:02:30] can the church say amen anybody with me
[2:02:35] you may be seated the great high priest
[2:02:38] brother terrence
[2:02:39] so there in genesis he was the first
[2:02:42] priest
[2:02:44] isn't that right
[2:02:48] oh but kevin was the first priest and
[2:02:50] when jesus came
[2:02:52] he became the last priest because when
[2:02:55] he came
[2:02:56] there was no need for any other high
[2:02:58] priest
[2:02:59] because his priesthood was established
[2:03:01] forever
[2:03:02] so this priest we're talking about this
[2:03:03] great high priest is the first
[2:03:05] and he is the last hallelujah he
[2:03:08] established
[2:03:09] the beginning he established the ending
[2:03:13] that ironic prison was a temporary
[2:03:15] priesthood
[2:03:16] between the scriptural context of that
[2:03:19] first great high priest
[2:03:21] and jesus coming as the great high
[2:03:23] priest and when jesus came
[2:03:25] there was no more need for any high
[2:03:28] priest
[2:03:28] to ever have to get a sacrifice to go
[2:03:31] before the people
[2:03:32] because by his great sacrifice he
[2:03:35] abolished forever
[2:03:37] the system of man the system of the
[2:03:39] priesthood
[2:03:40] the failures of the priests
[2:03:43] [Applause]
[2:03:44] he may be seated
[2:03:48] so there is no office of high priests
[2:03:51] that had to be filled again
[2:03:52] iran's son became a high priest then his
[2:03:55] son after him became a high priest and
[2:03:57] he'll all be looking to who is the next
[2:03:58] high priest who is the next high priest
[2:04:00] so that when jesus came it had a high
[2:04:02] priest there
[2:04:05] and that high priest who was there but
[2:04:07] he cliff didn't realize
[2:04:09] that his job was finishing him
[2:04:12] you know when he said somebody come to
[2:04:13] take your work he didn't realize
[2:04:16] that when jesus was born in a manger all
[2:04:18] them priests who were servant
[2:04:20] who was eligible to be our next high
[2:04:22] priest are
[2:04:23] their work finish no work for you
[2:04:26] no no no atonement allele anymore
[2:04:29] if you're doing it it's just a ritual
[2:04:31] because the great high priests
[2:04:34] perform forever forever
[2:04:37] one time forever
[2:04:43] there was a time limit brother currents
[2:04:45] on iran as high priests
[2:04:47] there was a time limit on his son eliasa
[2:04:49] as high priest there was a time limit on
[2:04:51] phineas
[2:04:51] as a high priest but when jesus stepped
[2:04:53] into his role
[2:04:55] as high priest there is no time limit
[2:04:57] because he's a priest forever
[2:05:02] you may be seated iran led a certain
[2:05:05] category
[2:05:06] of priests these priests had to also die
[2:05:09] these priests had to do certain things
[2:05:11] but this jesus
[2:05:13] this great high priest is about to lead
[2:05:15] a kingdom of priests
[2:05:17] who also they will not die come on now
[2:05:19] this kind of priest we're talking about
[2:05:21] have a rapture promise this kind of oh
[2:05:24] you don't hear me
[2:05:25] you don't hear me never was there order
[2:05:27] of priesthood
[2:05:28] like this order of priests
[2:05:36] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:05:40] but it said listen i want you to catch
[2:05:42] it friends
[2:05:43] it was there in the world all along you
[2:05:45] know but paul
[2:05:46] is bringing clarity to them i know
[2:05:49] you've heard it before
[2:05:50] i know you ready before but let me put
[2:05:52] it together for you that's what paul was
[2:05:53] doing he said i know you're here but
[2:05:55] are you here but melchizedek you hear
[2:05:57] about it but let me tell you
[2:05:58] how jesus comes because only i have
[2:06:00] questions the fact that paul have to
[2:06:02] raise it mean they're wondering how
[2:06:03] could he be a high priest
[2:06:05] he's not from which i believe right that
[2:06:07] would have been a natural question
[2:06:09] how could paul preach that he is a high
[2:06:11] priest
[2:06:12] we know too well that you have to be of
[2:06:14] this i believe i to be a high priest
[2:06:16] you have to be able to descendants of
[2:06:18] aaron to be a high priest
[2:06:19] and paul preaching that jesus is a high
[2:06:21] priest not just any kind of high priest
[2:06:24] but this one you could touch him he feel
[2:06:27] what you feel
[2:06:28] he knows what you're going through this
[2:06:30] high priest don't have to offer
[2:06:32] for his issues and then your issues but
[2:06:35] with one offering
[2:06:36] he covered you and i he covered it
[2:06:38] forever and he make an intercession
[2:06:41] at the right hand of god this is not any
[2:06:43] kind of priest talking about
[2:06:45] god deliberately had it that he is not
[2:06:48] on the tribal levite
[2:06:49] unless you say he was of the ironic
[2:06:51] order but i had to have him outside of
[2:06:53] that order
[2:06:54] outside of the tribe to prove he is
[2:06:56] different
[2:06:58] whoa and god
[2:07:01] had to find you outside of the
[2:07:03] expectation of the world
[2:07:05] your family don't even know who you are
[2:07:07] god found you
[2:07:08] out of season out of order in a
[2:07:11] different place
[2:07:12] and god called you to a royal priesthood
[2:07:16] royal priesthood royal priesthood
[2:07:19] you're looking at royalty this morning
[2:07:21] you're looking at the priest this
[2:07:22] morning
[2:07:23] can the church say man
[2:07:33] hallelujah having no mother
[2:07:36] having no father but was made like unto
[2:07:39] the son of god
[2:07:41] abided a priest continually had no
[2:07:44] beginning
[2:07:45] he has no ending had no father
[2:07:48] had no mother yet he was a man he came
[2:07:51] from sailor reading the prophet
[2:07:53] he was the king of peace he was the king
[2:07:55] of righteousness
[2:07:56] he was not only a king but he was a
[2:07:58] prince he is a prince of peace
[2:08:00] he is a rose of sharon he is a lily of
[2:08:03] the valley
[2:08:04] he the morning star the alpha the omega
[2:08:07] he that was which is and shall come both
[2:08:10] root and offspring of david he was
[2:08:12] before david
[2:08:13] in david and after david i'm reading
[2:08:16] from the prophet
[2:08:17] who was this priest none other than the
[2:08:19] incarnated lord jesus christ
[2:08:21] in his magnificent power he was the same
[2:08:24] one
[2:08:24] a little later on after he had met
[2:08:27] abraham
[2:08:28] listen and gave him as being a covenant
[2:08:31] people the communion
[2:08:33] then now through the same covenant he
[2:08:35] was in a shadow
[2:08:36] that melchizedek when he become a man of
[2:08:39] flesh
[2:08:40] would be cut into pot and the communion
[2:08:42] will be given the fragrance of his
[2:08:44] broken body
[2:08:45] as we take today dear that melchizedek
[2:08:47] met abraham
[2:08:48] and abraham paid tithe to him abraham
[2:08:51] abraham the greatest man
[2:08:53] on the face of the earth paid tied to
[2:08:55] melchizedek
[2:08:56] the king of peace the king of salem the
[2:09:00] king of righteousness
[2:09:01] he was a prince but abandonment is
[2:09:02] repeating himself it's too good you have
[2:09:04] to keep
[2:09:04] do you know who we're talking about this
[2:09:06] morning whoo
[2:09:11] he was a prince he was a king and he was
[2:09:13] a servant of the most high
[2:09:15] which jesus was
[2:09:19] oh hallelujah hallelujah and brother
[2:09:22] branham said
[2:09:23] and when abraham a few years later or
[2:09:25] not too long after that
[2:09:26] when a lot had backslid listen to how
[2:09:28] the prophet put it now and sodom had
[2:09:30] been built
[2:09:31] okay and abram was left alone with syrah
[2:09:33] on the barren grounds
[2:09:34] and the cattle was all dying from
[2:09:36] starvation and it looked like god had
[2:09:38] failed him
[2:09:39] but he had a strong faith to believe and
[2:09:41] one day he was sitting at the door of
[2:09:43] his tent
[2:09:44] under the big oak it still stands in a
[2:09:47] memorial today as it's chad over and
[2:09:49] held
[2:09:49] and dear abraham sitting in the door of
[2:09:51] his tent
[2:09:52] scene listen melchizedek coming to him
[2:09:55] three men walking but ibrahim said i
[2:09:59] could just imagine abraham saying i've
[2:10:01] seen him before
[2:10:04] so parabanum is showing that abram is
[2:10:07] recognizing this man
[2:10:09] hallelujah it was the same god he
[2:10:10] changed form changed
[2:10:12] basque it's as if in a play by the pop
[2:10:14] well and you know who the character is
[2:10:16] you know
[2:10:17] and no matter what clause you put on
[2:10:19] hallelujah in the play you still know
[2:10:21] it's you
[2:10:23] you there you are the actor and you
[2:10:26] change your costume you're putting a
[2:10:27] different jacket
[2:10:28] a different tie a different shoes and i
[2:10:30] said but it's still popular
[2:10:33] he's acting in a different part but he's
[2:10:34] still the same pop well
[2:10:36] and then you're going on this scene and
[2:10:37] they come back again you win a different
[2:10:38] outfit now but
[2:10:41] he calling himself frank now but that's
[2:10:42] the same one
[2:10:45] and they're going over his scene and
[2:10:46] they come back again and i say but wait
[2:10:47] no
[2:10:48] he call himself tony nobody's the same
[2:10:50] one at the same way god
[2:10:52] has been slipping in and out in and out
[2:10:54] in and out
[2:10:58] he was before david he slipped into
[2:11:01] david he was after david
[2:11:02] he was before elijah slipped into elijah
[2:11:05] was after elijah
[2:11:06] he was before moses slipped into moses
[2:11:09] was after
[2:11:10] moses he was before joshua slipped into
[2:11:12] joshua
[2:11:13] and left a hallelujah and in this end
[2:11:15] time pride
[2:11:16] he was before you he will be in you but
[2:11:19] he will never leave you
[2:11:20] because he will be dwelling in a people
[2:11:24] can the church say amen
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:26] [Applause]
[2:11:36] superior ibrahim said again no in that
[2:11:38] same quote he said but when melchizedek
[2:11:41] the king of salem the priest of the most
[2:11:44] high the king of peace
[2:11:45] you see that connection between priests
[2:11:47] king priest king
[2:11:48] priest king so this is why the whole
[2:11:51] royal priesthood thing
[2:11:54] and kings and priests that you see in
[2:11:56] john say in the book of revelation
[2:11:58] is so important because it's a prophecy
[2:12:00] all the way back in genesis
[2:12:02] when we're back in exodus exodus 19 god
[2:12:05] talking about that thing a long time
[2:12:06] this is not a new message today you know
[2:12:09] oh come on now
[2:12:10] since exodus 19 is over the kingdom of
[2:12:13] priests
[2:12:15] and that message has been unchanged
[2:12:21] that message by the eclipse has been
[2:12:23] unchanged
[2:12:25] kingdom of priests kingdom of priests
[2:12:28] priests kings kings and priests
[2:12:32] so by time peter come he said he sings
[2:12:34] him you are a chosen generation
[2:12:37] a royal priesthood a peculiar people
[2:12:40] he cannot preach it because he knows a
[2:12:43] royal priesthood
[2:12:44] hallelujah he cannot preach it
[2:12:50] and we read in scripture anybody with me
[2:12:54] to see how it ties into our message as i
[2:12:57] get ready to close out in a few
[2:12:58] musicians
[2:12:59] get ready we read it there in revelation
[2:13:01] revelation 5 and i saw the right hand of
[2:13:03] him
[2:13:04] that sat on the throne a book written
[2:13:06] within
[2:13:07] and on the backside sealed with seven
[2:13:09] seals so
[2:13:10] so what was being locked up in this
[2:13:12] thing and unfolded into this thing
[2:13:15] and this whole seals and mystery thing
[2:13:17] and i saw a strong ancient brook came
[2:13:18] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[2:13:20] the book
[2:13:21] and to lose the seals thereof and no man
[2:13:24] in heaven knowing it
[2:13:25] what was this this was the key for the
[2:13:27] heathcliff to unlock in the kings and
[2:13:28] priests
[2:13:31] if this book didn't open there are no
[2:13:33] kings and priests
[2:13:34] oh come on now and no man in heaven nor
[2:13:37] in it
[2:13:38] neither under the earth was able to open
[2:13:40] the book needed to look to run
[2:13:42] and i wept much because no man was found
[2:13:45] worthy
[2:13:46] to open and to read the book needed to
[2:13:48] look there on
[2:13:49] and one of the elders said unto me
[2:13:51] listen weep not
[2:13:53] behold the lion king of the tribe of
[2:13:57] judah
[2:13:58] the root of david who we talking about
[2:14:00] oh hallelujah
[2:14:01] had prevailed to open the book and to
[2:14:04] lose the seven seals thereof
[2:14:06] and behold and low in the midst of the
[2:14:08] throne and of the four peace
[2:14:10] and in the midst of the elders stood a
[2:14:12] lamb as it had been slain
[2:14:14] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[2:14:17] are the seven spirits of god
[2:14:19] sent forth into holy earth and he came
[2:14:21] and took the book
[2:14:22] out of the right hand of him that sat
[2:14:24] upon the throne what could you imagine
[2:14:26] the jubilation the excitement oh
[2:14:29] hallelujah john was weeping
[2:14:31] because he was concerned about the
[2:14:33] king's priesthood
[2:14:34] coming back into power
[2:14:40] listen and when he had taken the book
[2:14:43] the four beasts and the four and twenty
[2:14:44] ella's
[2:14:45] fell down before the lamb having each
[2:14:47] one of them hops
[2:14:49] and golden vials of orders which are the
[2:14:51] prayers of the saints
[2:14:52] and they change their song i don't know
[2:14:54] what song they were singing before
[2:14:56] but they changed a song but they sang a
[2:14:59] new song
[2:15:00] and this is the song that they started
[2:15:01] to sing oh hallelujah
[2:15:03] the word worthy to take the book and to
[2:15:06] open the seas thereof
[2:15:08] for god was slain and has redeemed us
[2:15:12] to god by thy blood
[2:15:15] listen out of every kindred not just
[2:15:18] israel only
[2:15:19] not just abraham natural seed only but
[2:15:22] out of every kindred
[2:15:23] and tongue and people and nations
[2:15:26] and the song didn't end there but
[2:15:28] occurrence this is the old song
[2:15:30] it's a semicolon there so the song was
[2:15:33] continuing
[2:15:34] and has made us unto our god
[2:15:37] kings and priests kings and priests
[2:15:40] kings and priests so because this book
[2:15:43] was taken
[2:15:44] this book being taken this book oh come
[2:15:47] on now
[2:15:50] made it possible so for kings and
[2:15:53] priests and listen
[2:15:54] how does it end and we shall reign on
[2:15:56] the youth
[2:15:57] that rain on the earth means back to
[2:15:59] eden come on now
[2:16:00] that is back to eden by the altar true
[2:16:03] the altar
[2:16:04] you have to be a priest you have to be
[2:16:06] your king you have to be a priest
[2:16:08] you have to be a king royal priesthood
[2:16:11] royal priesthood
[2:16:13] lawyer priesthood royal priesthood i'm
[2:16:16] going to close out
[2:16:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:16:25] hallelujah oh hallelujah
[2:16:28] hallelujah listen
[2:16:32] and lean not unto my own understanding
[2:16:34] but ibraham said now the bible said the
[2:16:36] new testament he is the high priest
[2:16:37] right now
[2:16:38] so so so we are kings but
[2:16:42] the title king of kings is for a king
[2:16:45] who is above other kings
[2:16:48] so we are kings who are held account by
[2:16:51] the king of kings
[2:16:53] and we are priests who are held to
[2:16:55] account by the great high priests
[2:16:57] not iran not any other priest but the
[2:17:00] lord jesus christ himself
[2:17:02] the great high priest hallelujah after
[2:17:05] the order of mckenzie
[2:17:06] are you with me listen he is the high
[2:17:08] priest right now
[2:17:10] he continues the high priest after the
[2:17:13] order of mercedes
[2:17:14] he is the high priest forever so his
[2:17:16] role nobody else could sit there
[2:17:18] there's no vacancy for the position
[2:17:20] there's no other head
[2:17:22] of this body about christ there's no
[2:17:24] other high priest but the lord jesus
[2:17:26] christ himself
[2:17:27] and listen because we are priests
[2:17:30] there's nobody between us
[2:17:33] i'm getting to god because as a priest
[2:17:36] it gives you access
[2:17:37] that's why all the veil being rent was
[2:17:39] so important because it means in the old
[2:17:41] days you had to go to the priest to
[2:17:42] offer sacrifice but now you are priests
[2:17:45] you could offer your sacrifice today you
[2:17:47] could offer your sacrifice this morning
[2:17:49] you could all come on now anybody with
[2:17:51] me this morning
[2:17:53] listen he is the high priest forever
[2:17:56] there is no i'm listening i'm reading
[2:17:57] from the prophet
[2:17:58] there's no other high priest but him
[2:18:01] listen i'm talking about kings and
[2:18:02] priests are they talking about church
[2:18:05] i talk about ministry i'm talking about
[2:18:07] priests high priest relationship
[2:18:09] i'm talking about king king of king's
[2:18:11] relationship
[2:18:14] oh hallelujah because reigning on the
[2:18:17] earth
[2:18:17] is king and king of king relationship
[2:18:20] his son and father thing is priests and
[2:18:23] high priesting
[2:18:25] listen jewish about to be over you know
[2:18:27] and i'm talking about
[2:18:28] and the knowledge of our kingship and
[2:18:31] the knowledge
[2:18:31] of our royalty and our knowledge of the
[2:18:34] red carpet
[2:18:35] and the streets of gold oh come on now
[2:18:38] and the angels
[2:18:39] assigned to take command for us
[2:18:48] i'm trying to close out now the bible
[2:18:51] says
[2:18:52] he is a high priest right now without
[2:18:55] the weight no right now he's here please
[2:18:57] he continues the high priest after the
[2:19:00] order of melchizedek
[2:19:01] he is a high priest forever there's no
[2:19:03] other high priest but him
[2:19:05] no other mediator between god and men
[2:19:09] but the man christ so he's not the
[2:19:12] pastor
[2:19:13] is not an evangelist not an apostle
[2:19:15] there's no prophet
[2:19:16] there's nothing between you and christ
[2:19:18] every other office
[2:19:20] is subject to that relationship and to
[2:19:22] push for
[2:19:23] the relationship between you and your
[2:19:25] father
[2:19:26] between you and your king between you
[2:19:28] and your high priests
[2:19:35] who was between adam and god
[2:19:39] god would come down in the cool of the
[2:19:41] evening to have communion
[2:19:44] melchizedek met abraham and had
[2:19:46] communion
[2:19:48] the lord jesus met his disciples when
[2:19:50] they thanked him he had communion
[2:19:52] we do all this as a type as an ordinance
[2:19:54] now because one day we'll sit with him
[2:19:56] and have communion it'll be me and him
[2:19:59] him and i
[2:20:00] or in that secret place oh hallelujah
[2:20:03] nothing to get between
[2:20:04] sin can get between there your neighbor
[2:20:07] can get between there
[2:20:08] your past can get between there because
[2:20:10] once you accept your priesthood
[2:20:12] you leave your life behind you put it
[2:20:14] under the blood
[2:20:16] jesus paid it all and his one sacrifice
[2:20:19] his one offering has sanctified you
[2:20:21] forever
[2:20:26] i'm almost done
[2:20:30] no other mediator between god and men
[2:20:33] but the man christ that's right
[2:20:35] he is the only one and he is the same
[2:20:38] yesterday
[2:20:39] today and forever brother branham goes
[2:20:42] on now if he remains that same
[2:20:44] high priest and the bible said we can
[2:20:46] touch him
[2:20:47] by the feelings of our infirmities like
[2:20:50] that little woman did that touch his
[2:20:52] garment
[2:20:53] your faith can touch him tonight and
[2:20:55] he'll act the same way
[2:20:57] in human flesh like he did when he was
[2:21:00] in human flesh there
[2:21:01] abraham's oak do you believe this
[2:21:03] hallelujah
[2:21:04] my last quote in the seven church
[2:21:07] eighties but abraham said
[2:21:08] spiritual priesthood royal nation
[2:21:12] spiritual offering what is it now
[2:21:15] spiritual
[2:21:16] sacrifices that is quoting the scripture
[2:21:19] that is the
[2:21:19] fruits of our lips giving praise to his
[2:21:23] name
[2:21:24] now what kind of a what he said a
[2:21:26] spiritual
[2:21:27] sacrifice now now we might as well get
[2:21:29] started right here
[2:21:31] notice a good place to start from listen
[2:21:33] to the prophet now um
[2:21:35] do we have priests in the house today do
[2:21:38] you understand your priesthood and your
[2:21:39] kingship
[2:21:40] can i speak to the priests a message
[2:21:43] from the high priest
[2:21:46] because the high priest sent a message
[2:21:48] to the priest through the prophet
[2:21:51] he said when a little confusion comes in
[2:21:53] the church
[2:21:54] you don't run over to one side and out
[2:21:58] now
[2:21:59] if you are you sure in the priest
[2:22:04] you see how the prophet addressed the
[2:22:06] priest now he said when a little
[2:22:07] confusion comes into the church
[2:22:09] you don't run over to one side and pout
[2:22:11] now if you are
[2:22:12] you show in the priest see you pray
[2:22:14] through because that's what priests do
[2:22:18] you say your prayer life begin to change
[2:22:21] spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our
[2:22:23] lips
[2:22:24] giving praise to his name you see what i
[2:22:26] mean well you say i just don't feel
[2:22:29] like going to church he said but you're
[2:22:31] a priest
[2:22:33] hallelujah listen listen we're speaking
[2:22:36] to priests we have i asked a question
[2:22:38] you know and
[2:22:39] most of you put up your hand
[2:22:43] you say well you say i just don't feel
[2:22:45] like going to church he said but you're
[2:22:46] a priest
[2:22:48] it's your duty you've got to be there
[2:22:51] what kind of peace are you it is your
[2:22:54] turn to
[2:22:54] to to trim the wick and it's your turn
[2:22:57] to do the evening sacrifices
[2:23:02] but abraham goes on well i just i just
[2:23:05] don't feel like taking a part in the
[2:23:07] service
[2:23:09] he said you're a priest making a
[2:23:12] sacrifice
[2:23:13] a spiritual sacrifice not giving
[2:23:16] somebody some hand me down as they call
[2:23:17] it today
[2:23:18] that's all good i have nothing against
[2:23:20] it not going to get somebody to come to
[2:23:21] you that's all good i have nothing
[2:23:22] against it but it's you
[2:23:24] you making the spiritual sacrifice
[2:23:28] the fruits of your lips giving praise to
[2:23:30] his name
[2:23:32] so you can be a priest and sit down
[2:23:34] silent in church
[2:23:35] because the fruits of your lips as a
[2:23:38] priest
[2:23:39] you can't help but give praise to god
[2:23:41] you can't help
[2:23:42] but say lord you're worthy holy holy
[2:23:45] holy is the lord
[2:23:46] lord i give a sacrifice of praise even
[2:23:49] when you don't feel like worshiping as a
[2:23:51] priest
[2:23:51] you go against your feeling you show up
[2:23:54] even when you don't feel like it
[2:23:55] you do your duty when you don't feel
[2:23:57] like it because you're a priest you'll
[2:23:58] accept
[2:23:59] your priesthood
[2:24:00] [Music]
[2:24:05] when you see a time coming that
[2:24:08] everybody blaspheming and seeing these
[2:24:10] things and doing things wrong
[2:24:12] what do you do walk away you're supposed
[2:24:13] to stand there
[2:24:15] with a spiritual sacrifice saying the
[2:24:18] blood of jesus christ cleanses from all
[2:24:20] sin
[2:24:20] makes me a new creature in christ jesus
[2:24:23] you're a crazy fellow
[2:24:24] according to what you say it's all right
[2:24:26] but to me it's the power of god
[2:24:28] unto salvation i believe it now they say
[2:24:30] you believe in divine healing oh i don't
[2:24:32] know you but i asked well pastor what do
[2:24:34] you think about it you're the priest now
[2:24:36] but if i say you are the priest now if
[2:24:39] you're the priest you're supposed to
[2:24:40] know
[2:24:42] not we don't i don't know if you believe
[2:24:44] in divine healing let me go and ask the
[2:24:45] pastor if we believe in divine healing
[2:24:47] i don't know if we're looking for a
[2:24:48] revival am i asking pastor what about
[2:24:50] revival you're the priest now
[2:24:52] you're supposed to know he's without a
[2:24:53] revival you're supposed to be creating a
[2:24:55] revival because you're a priest
[2:24:56] yes sir i believe it because god would
[2:24:58] say so if you believe in the baptism
[2:25:01] of the holy spirit how do you know i've
[2:25:03] received a showing of a spiritual
[2:25:05] blessing
[2:25:05] first peter 2 5 he also has lively
[2:25:09] stones
[2:25:10] have built up a spiritual house and holy
[2:25:13] priesthood
[2:25:14] to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[2:25:17] to god
[2:25:18] by jesus christ closing out here you are
[2:25:21] chosen generation
[2:25:23] a royal priesthood a holy nation a
[2:25:26] kingdom of priests
[2:25:28] because jesus is the great priest king
[2:25:30] just like melchizedek
[2:25:31] as the office of the great priest king
[2:25:33] the lion and the lamb
[2:25:35] won the victory as king because he gave
[2:25:38] himself as a final sacrifice for king
[2:25:40] over to redeem us even now he reigns as
[2:25:43] king of kings
[2:25:44] lord of lords and as high priest he
[2:25:46] intercedes for us
[2:25:48] oh and as a redeemed people of god just
[2:25:50] like the aaronic priesthood
[2:25:52] we are set aside from all other people
[2:25:54] like iran's comment was to set them
[2:25:55] aside we
[2:25:56] are peculiar people have to now walk in
[2:25:58] this calling
