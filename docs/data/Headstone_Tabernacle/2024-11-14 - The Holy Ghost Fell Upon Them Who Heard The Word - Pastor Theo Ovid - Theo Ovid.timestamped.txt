[19:26] turn to uh Acts chapter 10 we want to
[19:30] read uh two portions from in there 1 to6
[19:33] and 30 to 48 and um we'll see what the
[19:36] Lord will do Acts chapter 10 there was a
[19:38] certain man in ceria named called
[19:41] Cornelius a centurion of the band called
[19:43] The Italian band devout man one that
[19:46] feared God with all his house which give
[19:48] much arms to the people and pray to God
[19:51] always he saw in a vision evidently but
[19:53] the nth hour of the day an angel of God
[19:56] coming to him saying unto Cornelius
[19:59] and when he had looked on him he was
[20:00] afraid and said what is it Lord he said
[20:03] unto him thy prayers and thine arms are
[20:05] come up for a memorial before God now
[20:08] send men to Jer and call for one Simon
[20:12] whose surname is Peter is very specific
[20:16] he lth with one Simon at Tanner whose
[20:18] house is by the seaside he shall tell
[20:21] thee what thou oughtest to do let's go
[20:23] down to verse
[20:25] 30 Cornelius speaking to speak and
[20:27] talking to Peter cornelus said four days
[20:30] ago I was fasting until this hour and at
[20:33] the ninth hour I prayed in my house and
[20:35] behold a man stood Before Me In Bright
[20:38] clothing he said Cornelius thy prayer is
[20:40] heard thine arms are hard and
[20:43] Remembrance in the sight of God send
[20:45] therefore to Jer call H Simon who s is
[20:48] Peter he is lodged in a house of one
[20:50] Simon a Tanner by the seaside who when
[20:53] he cometh shall speak unto thee
[20:55] immediately therefore I sent to thee
[20:57] that thou well well done that thou had
[20:59] come now therefore are we all here
[21:02] present before God to hear all things
[21:05] that are commanded thee of God then
[21:07] Peter opened his mouth and said of a
[21:09] truth I perceive that God is no
[21:11] respector of persons but in every nation
[21:14] he that fearth him and work at
[21:16] righteousness is accepted with him the
[21:18] word which God sent unto the to children
[21:20] of Israel preaching Peace by Jesus
[21:22] Christ he's Lord of all and that word I
[21:25] say you know which was published
[21:27] throughout all Judea and began from
[21:28] Galilee after the baptism which John
[21:31] preached now God anointed Jesus of
[21:33] Nazareth so so so Peter is preaching now
[21:36] and God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[21:38] the Holy Ghost with power who went about
[21:40] doing good healing all that were
[21:42] oppressed of the devil for God was with
[21:44] him and we Are Witnesses of things which
[21:47] he did both in the land of the Jews and
[21:49] in Jerusalem whom they slew and hung on
[21:51] a tree him God raised up the third day
[21:54] and showed him openly not to all the
[21:57] people but unto Witness
[21:59] chosen before God even to us who did eat
[22:01] and drink with him after he rose from
[22:03] the dead and he commanded us to preach
[22:05] unto the people and to testify that it
[22:08] is he which was ordained of God to be
[22:11] judged of the quick and the dead or the
[22:12] living and the dead to him gave all the
[22:15] prophets witness that through his name
[22:18] whosoever believeth in him shall receive
[22:20] remission of sins while Peter yet spake
[22:25] these words the Holy Ghost fell on all
[22:28] all them which heard the word and they
[22:31] of the circumcision which believe were
[22:33] astonished as many as came with Peter
[22:36] because that on the Gentiles also was
[22:39] poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost
[22:42] for they heard them speak with tongues
[22:44] and magnify God then Peter then answered
[22:48] Peter can any man forbid water that
[22:51] these shouldn't be baptized now hear the
[22:53] words here now which have received the
[22:56] Holy Ghost as well as we in the
[23:00] Amplified the words of that in verse 47
[23:04] says can anyone forbid or refuse water
[23:06] for baptizing these people seeing that
[23:08] they have received the Holy Spirit just
[23:10] as we have and he commanded them to be
[23:14] baptized in the name of the Lord they
[23:16] prayed at him to T certain days let's
[23:18] pray father we thank you for your word
[23:20] is exciting tonight to read these holy
[23:22] scriptures Lord make it alive to us real
[23:25] to us in Jesus name we ask it amen and
[23:27] amen you may be seated pray praise God
[23:29] is great to be here tonight uh rain
[23:32] rainy night but God is good okay I have
[23:36] a title the Holy Ghost fell upon them
[23:39] who heard the word Holy Ghost fell upon
[23:42] them who heard the word we know this man
[23:43] was just and devout give of arms and so
[23:46] on but I have an inspiration and these
[23:49] are the words from verse 47 Amplified
[23:52] theyed the Holy Spirit just as we have
[23:58] no different one the same holy ghost
[24:00] that got in the upper room Peter saw
[24:02] these people receive that same holy
[24:06] spirit all right so brother Bram says
[24:09] now he's talking about he is going to
[24:12] get a change of
[24:13] ministry and he said another one is
[24:16] going to happen and I'm grateful to God
[24:19] that the hour is soon at hand I believe
[24:21] it when God is going to help his
[24:25] children especially it will be for those
[24:29] who can't must the faith to raise up and
[24:33] get a hold of God like they should so
[24:36] he's defining that there are some of
[24:38] God's children who just can't seem to
[24:41] must up that fith and God going to help
[24:43] them amen now we know he's talking about
[24:45] his thir P right he said I believe the
[24:50] Lord is providing a way for us now to
[24:53] take care of them also some runs into
[24:57] the FI and they can just reach over and
[25:00] receive anything why that's the great
[25:02] fate some of them have Mustard Seed fate
[25:06] and has to wait so long to get through
[25:08] Hallelujah I believe the Lord is making
[25:11] a way for those people nowall do you
[25:14] believe that so you could see one size
[25:16] doesn't fit all and this is how God view
[25:19] this Kingdom but BR you can never be so
[25:23] good you can live a clean life you can
[25:25] go to church every day you can sacrifice
[25:27] every day you can give part of your
[25:29] money you can give all give up all the
[25:31] sins of the world and everything and
[25:32] live just as true and faithful as you
[25:34] can and you'll miss Heaven as far as E
[25:36] From The W it isn't by goodness are we
[25:39] saved Hallelujah but by his Mercy that
[25:42] we are
[25:43] brought goodness he said that is what
[25:46] God wanted to make Sons and Daughters
[25:49] goodness never makes them the spirit of
[25:51] God is what makes them so you could stop
[25:54] smoking stop drinking stop lying stop
[25:56] everything you're doing wrong and you
[25:57] still can't make it because that's you
[25:59] stopping that is you doing this and you
[26:01] doing that but what he is saying here is
[26:03] not goodness to make you it's the spirit
[26:06] of God to make you because if goodness
[26:08] could make you you don't need the spirit
[26:11] you just you just be goody to shoes just
[26:12] be a good man good woman Good Wife good
[26:14] husband and then you're making into the
[26:16] kingdom you don't need cross you don't
[26:17] need the blood you don't need the
[26:19] calvary you don't need Jesus your
[26:21] goodness is what pull you true he said
[26:22] that's not working here if the spirit I
[26:26] think last Sunday we say success not
[26:28] success bear witness of God is the
[26:30] spirit bear witness of God Amen if it
[26:33] wasn't so hear this part watch goodness
[26:36] never makes them the spirit of God is
[26:38] what makes them if it wasn't so he
[26:41] wouldn't have had to send the Holy
[26:44] Ghost so the Holy Ghost was sent to be a
[26:47] power to influence and transform your
[26:49] life Hallelujah that is why it's
[26:51] ridiculous having a form of godliness
[26:54] but denying the power to change they
[26:57] love to say Amen they love to to saying
[26:58] love special love to clap or whatnot but
[27:00] Power it has to have power to change you
[27:03] from what you are into what God want you
[27:05] to be that's the power of the Gospel
[27:08] that's the power of the word brother BR
[27:11] the coming of the Son of God is drawing
[27:12] nigh and only those who are charged by
[27:16] the Holy Ghost shout out charge tonight
[27:18] right those that are charged by the Holy
[27:21] Ghost who has Immortal Life living in
[27:23] them that's the type that's going to be
[27:25] drawn from here
[27:28] hallelujah oh glory to not church
[27:29] members those who are charged with the
[27:32] Holy Ghost Hallelujah glory to God you
[27:34] know when your cell phone going on you
[27:35] had to plug it in and get charge but God
[27:37] want you to charge up with the Dynamics
[27:39] of the Holy Ghost there is a Jo power
[27:42] not from the church here we go not from
[27:45] the pastor but from Glory this baptism
[27:48] of the holy ghost moving down in that
[27:50] live channel to draw up the church what
[27:52] it is is the power of God hallelujah
[27:55] giving you access to his life which is
[27:57] Zo Give the Lord some Praises tonight
[28:01] Hallelujah now God promised to meet the
[28:03] need of the hour he always does that and
[28:05] we need the voice of God today to meet
[28:09] the need of the hour to meet the time
[28:11] that we are living in after you promised
[28:13] it you can rest assure he will keep his
[28:15] promise and today one of the reason that
[28:18] the church is in the condition it's in
[28:20] is because of so many voices so many
[28:23] other voices to attract the church from
[28:25] the voice of God there are so many other
[28:28] voices that when it's God promised he
[28:30] would give us that if the other voices
[28:32] are contrary to the voice of God it must
[28:34] be the voice of our enemy to confuse us
[28:37] that we would not understand the voice
[28:40] of God when it spoke there are so many
[28:43] voices in the Earth today that it is
[28:45] absolutely a hard thing because it
[28:47] deaden the voice of the
[28:50] supernatural do you see it now every
[28:53] other voice is to deaden the voice of
[28:55] the supernatural because the devil want
[28:57] the intellectual church that the power
[28:59] can't move he want a dead church that
[29:01] the power can move he want a church that
[29:03] doesn't worship he want a church to have
[29:05] books and tapes and they believe they
[29:06] going to Rapture dead a DA you Satan
[29:09] don't even touch them because they dead
[29:13] already there are so many intellectual
[29:17] voices great voices of mighty man they
[29:20] not small fries now this is the dealing
[29:23] with the big
[29:24] guys mighty man who are intellectual
[29:28] and in their intellectual conditions
[29:30] even Shake Nations they are not just
[29:33] overnight people but they Shake Nations
[29:36] and persons would be a bit confused how
[29:39] that these things can go on and prosper
[29:42] and it causes the voice of God to be
[29:45] placed way back somewhere now the
[29:47] brother brandham is prophesying of what
[29:49] people will be seeing here and the voice
[29:52] of God they say how will we know it's
[29:54] the voice of God today because then it
[29:58] wasn't a Vindicated Prophet so he is
[30:00] going forward in time and looking back
[30:03] and saying what people would say because
[30:05] then it wasn't a Vindicated Prophet
[30:06] William brandham how will we know the
[30:08] voice of God today he said a true voice
[30:11] of God only brings back the real living
[30:15] Supernatural god with the supernatural
[30:17] word with the supernatural manifestation
[30:20] of the true word oh give the Lord some
[30:22] Praises glory to God so the true voice
[30:25] of God always tries to bring a manif Ed
[30:28] reality a present tense reality a
[30:32] present tense awareness that God is real
[30:35] he's alive he do heal he do deliver he's
[30:39] open blind eyes he set the captive free
[30:42] he open the prison doors that's the God
[30:44] we serve tonight when there is no way he
[30:47] could make a way do you believe that
[30:49] that he can make a way for you you don't
[30:51] have to remain sick in your body you
[30:53] could be healing your spirit you could
[30:55] be healing your body and you could be
[30:57] healing your Soul not only you but your
[30:59] family also your loved one also oh give
[31:02] the Lord a praise let's go the church
[31:05] feels it don't need the holy spirit
[31:07] because we have the seals now we have
[31:10] Mysteries now they don't need the Holy
[31:13] Spirit the churches will tell you that
[31:14] men will stand up and give you such an
[31:16] intellectual talk it could almost make
[31:18] you believe it they could make and he
[31:20] could make but says it is intellectual
[31:23] talks so smooth it will deceive the
[31:26] people it is Gospel it is men who
[31:29] handled the word in such a way that he
[31:31] could almost make any intellectual
[31:33] person if you're trusting intellectual
[31:34] they will condemn the Holy Spirit but
[31:37] that is the way of man oh praise God but
[31:39] Amos prophesied in Amos 8 he said behold
[31:42] the days come sayth Lord God I will send
[31:45] a famine in the land not famine for
[31:47] bread or thirst for water but for the
[31:50] hearing of the words of the Lord and
[31:52] they shall wand from sea to Sea from the
[31:54] north to the east they shall run to and
[31:56] fro the word of the Lord and shall not

[55:41] power from on high now watch this now
[55:45] you see Jesus had proven to God that he
[55:48] had been right and of son God took him
[55:50] off the mountain brought Witnesses out
[55:51] there His Garment shine like this son a
[55:54] supernatural something take place

[1:08:51] certain vessel descended it was a great
[1:08:53] sheath let down from the heaven by Four
[1:08:55] Corners it came to me upon the which I
[1:08:58] fastened my eyes and considered and saw
[1:09:01] four-footed Beasts of the earth wild
[1:09:02] beast creeping Things Fall of the air I
[1:09:05] Heard a Voice saying unto me arise Peter
[1:09:07] slay and eat I said not so Lord For
[1:09:10] Nothing common unclean at any time
[1:09:12] entered into my mouth but the voice
[1:09:14] answered me again from Heaven what God
[1:09:16] has cleansed thou shal not call common
[1:09:19] and this was done three times and were
[1:09:21] drawn up again into heaven and behold
[1:09:24] immediately there was three men already
[1:09:27] coming to the house where I was sent
[1:09:30] from CES unto me and the spirit B me not
[1:09:34] I call headquarters the spirit B me to
[1:09:36] go with them nothing doubting more of
[1:09:39] these six Brethren accompanied me and we
[1:09:42] entered into the man's house and he
[1:09:44] showed us how he had seen an angel in
[1:09:46] his house which stood and said unto him
[1:09:48] send men to Jer and call for Simon whose
[1:09:52] her name is Peter who shall tell the
[1:09:54] words thereby thou shal all thy house
[1:09:57] shall be saved and as I begin to speak
[1:10:00] the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at
[1:10:04] the beginning oh give the Lord a shout
[1:10:07] oh give the Lord a praise in the house
[1:10:10] Peter was given a testimony and as they
[1:10:12] begin to speak the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:10:15] them as at the beginning then remembered
[1:10:18] I the word of the Lord he said John
[1:10:20] indeed baptized with water but you shall
[1:10:22] be baptized with the Holy Ghost for as
[1:10:25] much then as God give them the like gift
[1:10:29] as he did to us who believe on the Lord
[1:10:32] Jesus Christ what was I that I could
[1:10:35] withstand God he busted them he said the
[1:10:38] same gift we got them Gentiles got who
[1:10:42] am I to fight
[1:10:45] God you may be
[1:10:48] seated I'm on was done Verse 18 says
[1:10:52] when they heard these things they held
[1:10:54] their peace they shut up and glorify God
[1:10:57] saying then had God also to the Gentiles
[1:11:00] granted repentance unto life Hallelujah
[1:11:04] busted them so if you think you're
[1:11:06] having it easy because you have a
[1:11:07] testimony of being led by the Holy Ghost
[1:11:10] why you going among them non Thunders
[1:11:16] Brethren if was so and so they never go
[1:11:19] there they never go there that is them
[1:11:22] but I was led by the spirit to go this
[1:11:25] way
[1:11:26] amen but those Breen don't believe we
[1:11:28] believe that believe could believe you
[1:11:31] hold your
[1:11:32] peace CU you are not my Holy Ghost Jesus
