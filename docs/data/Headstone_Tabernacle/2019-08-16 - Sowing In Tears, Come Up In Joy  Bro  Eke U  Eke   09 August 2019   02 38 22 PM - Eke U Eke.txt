rise miron Dave and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the year after that the full corn in the ear but when the

to speak today on sow in tears come up in joy so in TS come up in joy and I want to start by reading this quote are extracted from the invitation and every time we see these Bibles say anything it's a seed and it's absolutely and we are sought with the incorruptible seed of God and if a man will take any divine promise of God in his heart and what it would face it will produce just exactly what it said it would do the Prophet said Amen don't care what it is just take God's promise in your heart pray the Lord now some years but chandler's spoke about the bridge builder who in South Africa I think it was problem state the bridge builder had to build a bridge he must do it or lose his reputation because other people her comments said the job could not be done and this man came looked over the whole place and he told the person that wanted the bridge built as I can do the job you say you mean it say experts from America and different places have been here and they said I can do the job and you mean you could do it and the man said I'll do it pres a lot what was he going to lose if he didn't build a bridge his reputation are you hearing me friends say man somebody a lot said that the so uh sought the world the seed is the word and will Malachi forced end of time message know that we have a reputation as Christians because of the material we know is in the building when you know the material that is in your building you know that nothing can shake that building and the material I'm speaking about here is the blood of Jesus Christ praise Allah the stature of a perfect man those seven building materials can this is insane those materials you don't need to be shaken I don't care what happens the material can stand the test of time regardless of what comes of what goes somebody says something there's no guess what to eat I'm making it present tense so in tears now and come up in two don't get this correct don't get tired don't get weary the series original just keep sowing sowing and reaping is the law of God is a natural law of God what you saw you read there's no way I can saw the seven thunders without ripping the seven thunders manifestation it's a seed somebody say Amen I can hear you say a man somebody you couldn't come here without preparing to Seoul can you say something you just have to Seoul because what you saw you shall reap even if I didn't have confidence in this seat I wouldn't be suing but I have confidence in this sea and I will keep sewing because I know that the heavens coming let me redeem say oh man my whistle or so let's eat and you shall reap the right crop amen you saw in certain season and you reap in certain season you don't sow and reap in the same season there's a time to plant there's a time to harvest and we've been showing and I know that these laborers they know that they can live your job have done they know that their reputation is at stake if they don't finish the work your reputation is at stake if you don't finish this work let's come here up short I'll be there I better give you my testimony [Applause] you don't so enjoy you so in tears so don't begin to tell me about the things you've gone through which you shouldn't have gone through if you saw despite what you are going to despite what you will go through doubtless the Bible say down you will doubtless come back nothing to tell about it bringing in your sheaves you shall come what rejoicing worry brother god bless you friends no matter how much sleep you got if you are afraid to sew it thus it will do you no good you must sow the seed you have and it must be original and I know there are four years we've stood a whole lot of things sometimes up sometimes down that is one thing that is being proven you are time-tested memorials you've gone through fire you've gone through float you've gone through deep trials and we are still here time-tested memorials you know why problems book that a certain man that didn't believe in God said all these things nothing could about them is not true say if I'm wrong when I died let happen scroll through my to am program say why they were still digging the grave they killed two serpents and as a memoria serpents have been crawling in and out of that grave never you let anybody tell you that God's Word is not true every word of God from cipher to cipher is nothing but the truth we shall come rejoicing friends bringing in the sheaves for this is not the time for giving up it's time to be strong so if you don't get this courage and if you don't give up brother something is coming now before a man can make a reputation it has to have a vision of what he's doing if you don't have a vision of what you are doing you cannot make a reputation because you have a lot of challenges so you must be certain of what you are doing you believe it don't worry cotton promised us anything that he will not do God keeps his word the race has been long there everything that has a beginning must have an end and while it lasts take that turn for Jesus Christ take it ok how many spirits a challenging or let me read a quote here friends invasion of the United States and brother Brahim say old father while the great darkness is on the battle and a devil invading their countries and invading the pulpits invading the churches in varying the people's invading the businesses in reading the cities and the schools and the homes oh god help us to stand and he said pull us so quickly and fight for God somebody say Amen do what pull the sword quickly and fight for God as Moses and the

love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness now I'm going to give you my estimation of what I think that the closest thing to an evidence that a man is a Christian than anything I know of you know what it is it's travail of soul a person that's always so hungry and testing for God they just simply day and night that just comes tactics they've got to do something for God they are full of love and just in soul travel just traveling all the time the Bible said he that goeth forth sewing in tears will doubtless return again rejoicing bringing with him precious sheaves is that right so we are here to prevail we are here to make footprints we are here to possess our individual inheritance we are here no devil can stop us the chief captain has gone ahead of us already and he

failed us yet were tourists started to do in you he will finish it hallelujah God doesn't know failure and because he lives you shall live Hitler is in you is greater the leader is in the world he that is in you is greater than inner restraint to stop you hallelujah give him praise my you may be seated the Lord Jesus typing the kingdom of God is like a man going to sow his seed and he cast it into the ground he goes to sleep night he wakes up in the morning and this series in the end something is happening he cannot explain how is happening there after a while up comes a blade after that a tassel after that the full colon the year where the hammers is not yet caught something is being expected as soon as the fruits shows up he puts in the sickle because they have as is called The Rapture will not be delayed a second friends do you hear me the resurrection will not be delayed one second the signal is in you core is watering it day and night you can explain what is going on but something is happening will see live process fetch you a live voice amen knowledge a live voice temperance a leaf falls flushing God said it it has to happen as long as there is sun shining God keeps

that turn the world upside down they are Iran tell me something somebody the seer is already in your soul it's been sown in tears but I'm saying that let's not stop sewing let's make it present hence less so in tears present tense and you shall come a present tense with joy did I hear you say something give me prayers you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah now the Prophet explaining something he said a sheaf which was the first of your seed that you plant when it comes up and ripened you cut down this chief and take it to the priest and let him take it and wave it before the Lord for your acceptance somebody say Amen notice it was the first corner of God's width that had been raised from the dead God first kind of width by God's quickening power God have quickened his life raise him up from the dead and it was the first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was not chief that's why they had to waive the chief for it was the first one that come to maturity and it was waived as a memorial of times giving to God believing that the rest of them would come who told you you will not come you will come to maturity friends how can that be a half as if you don't come to maturity can you sew without ripping it's a law what you saw you read Amen you saw brotherly love you represent laws you saw holy decency you recall it decency you saw blessing Christ you replacing Christ this message will not come only in wordfriends it will also come in manifestation so I cannot settle down for work work work work work there will be a manifestation somebody shout let's so present-tense live history alone God's name is not history God's name is present tense I am I am that I am oh just give me a clap offering somebody hallelujah you may be seated how can you come all the way and think you will go back to him he knows what to do he knows why he brought you here he can send you but empty he's got to give you your heart's desire oh my as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although type in many places he was the first fruits of those are slept in a bride and the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they all have to be as she waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheaf what was the sheaf the first one had come to mature the first one that proof it was a week that proof it was achieved hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time they will come forth for a bride age for a resurrection power of that denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the world has turned but again in its full power and being waived of other people by the same science and oneness that he did back there because I leave shall live also praise God somebody prays a lot somebody oh my soul in tears amen brother if there's no resurrection we are of all people most miserable I wouldn't want to waste one second in thunders if God is not going to raise me up back again to a young man he said he will do it is a sea that is in you all these seven partners promises planted in your soul God said I'll raise it up again they are original in nature they cannot fail can I hear yourself even if this is your first time of coming in contact with the supernatural you cannot come into the presence of God and go back the same God has a way of touching you somebody shouts somebody jump hallelujah god bless you be not afraid I don't care help boys terrorist s tommy's don't let me scare you I'm almost done you know brace hello I want to read my last quote it's a little bit long but after I'm done can we give him a clap offering praise Allah this is from Easter sonrise 1956 and probrem says so in TS come up in joy and he say remain o because I live he shall live also oh my is it if the Old Testament Saints could think that what ought we to think this morning and I said this afternoon after 1900 years of seeing sufferings and toils and so forth knowing that we are right into the front door of the resurrection amen the church has moved right up to the hour now where the resurrection can come at anything and I'm thinking what would it mean to us at that day the believers what will it mean on the day I can see on that early morning when Matt and Mary went out to the grave they were coming along the side of the hill after a night think of that poor mother's heart her baby all the way when she was when it was born they said it was an illegitimate child very absolutely didn't belong to Joseph and and it was or it was Josef's and the where the baby was born out of holy wedlock she had all of that to go through I know think about your baby and I had been rejected and despised and spit yet he claimed it think of this message how it has been despised spit on whatever yet through whatever situation we still claim that the message of Malachi 4 is right but let's see how it went with Mary amen praise the Lord okay let me see where it was so she her ought to go through and think about your baby and how it been rejected and despised and spit on yet acclaimed it and she's somehow with a quivering heart said God brought me that baby how could it be seeing him yonder in that great crucial hour she thought surely when they went to put a crown of thorns on his head and beat him till the blood shot through his back striped him up and down and all these things she thought surely that any moment he will trot her cross down and turn around and hit his foot on the ground and the earth will pick from one side to the other and proclaim who he was there he had died yonder like a poor defeated male fatto hanging on the cross he had died in disgrace you see the picture of course with a cloud around him that was wrong they stripped him every bit of clothes off of him and his grace him to the wall and everything they could and they nailed him to the cross and he seemed to be standing helpless standing the air didn't want him heavens couldn't have him it was a sinner oh my if you could only realize just think the ED didn't know its creator heaven couldn't receive him because he had the sin of the earth on him they didn't even have a place talk about a place to be born he didn't have a place to die that's right the ed didn't want him they rejected a well with such a fellow heavens couldn't receive him because he was a sinner all were a saviour coming down from glory and beginning that I'm becoming that for me so rejected by his own there he came to his own his own received him not no place to be born no place to die what did the world want what could they do per custom into hell there was somebody who loved him I'll not live his soul in Hell night I will eyes suffer him to see corruption they raised him from the grave and a comforter on Easter morning try and hallelujah Brooke and every fear and everything rose again and stands a life today forever more his presence is here he's at his at this place this morning I said
