the headstone tabernacle trinidad on behalf of my wife here is ann marie son isaac and his wife zakarian want to greet brother okeechobee his wife family and church great fellow ministers fellow laborers in the vineyard we certainly appreciate you coming out we thank god for you want to salute but you may be seated just a minute or two just before we read the scriptures i want to salute the message this morning god bless you and what i can say he stood up like an angel and spoke truth you know that's what david did right david saw glad and spoke truth to goliath because goliath wanted to know who is this little boy coming to him like that and goliath told david a lie he said i'm going to feed you to the birds and goliath was spoken truth david said you come to me with spear and shield and whatever you come with but i just come in the name of the lord and i'm gonna cut your head off you intellectual giant and i feel that was like david and this morning praise god who is this uncircumcised philistine define the armies of the living god how dare you defy the armies of the living god they are more for us than against us oh hallelujah praise god amen amen amen oh glory to god oh gloria don't get me started this night lord god don't get me started oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god don't be fine this army you may be seated praise god amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to god and that is when truth speaks the power the power of position the hallelujah goliath was was was embarrassed to see who was challenging him he felt he was so powerful because of his position but one's truth speaks to power or position truth will prevail oh hallelujah glory to god that is what we need you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god you may be seated i remember reading something but abandoned said he was telling somebody the truth about their life and so on and when it came out they got free they got healed he said because the truth is what sets you free i'm not talking about the freedom that the devil come and take you back i'm talking about the freedom that jesus said who the son of man set free is free indeed oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god you might be seated praise god the devil didn't believe israel was free when moses took them out you may be seated the devil thought pharaoh thought the people still belong to him pharaoh taught that and many times the devil think that he you still belong to him so he see you as a runaway slave to bring you back in so when pharaoh saw those people going out he couldn't take it anymore he said let's go after them but god wanted that battle god wanted that devil to come after because god wanted to prove he's the same yesterday of the ever and i feel tonight that god wants to prove hallelujah that he is with this bride go away hallelujah you may be seated not because he is silent he doesn't hear not because god is silent he's not watching and looking don't misinterpret god's silence brother branham said when god is silent that's the hour to be certain of god when you pray and god doesn't answer that's the very hour to be certain of god and in this hour we are certain that we are standing on the rock in this hour we are certain that we are standing on the promises in this hour the devil can't move us we are certain this is the truth [Applause] oh glory to god amen certain bible says genesis chapter 1 want to read from verse 26-28 psalms 8. want to read from verse 4-6 revelation chapter 5 2 verses 9 and 10. genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over recreating that creepet upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply replenish the earth subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air over every living thing that move it upon the earth we want to go to psalms 8 reading from verse 4. what is man the doubt mindful of him and the son of man that doubt visited him for those made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory and honor thomas him to have dominion over the works of thy hand thou has put all things under his feet final scripture from revelation chapter 5 i want to read verse 9 and 10. this is after the lamb took the book and they sung a new song saying that what worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for tao was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth let's pray once more father we thank you for your word inspired to our hearts made get wings lord by the spirit and and fly into our hearts lord may the word be become flesh and dwell among us tonight in jesus name i ask it amen our name and you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the lord and tonight is the prayer line night and i trust them that the words that we're going to share with you will inspire you tonight and set you free from your sickness from your bondage from whatever condition you're in that freedom will reign in your life i have a title tonight we shall reign on the earth that's my title of the night we shall reign on the earth other context scripture from ephesians 1 11 to 14 it says in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who look at all things after the consul of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom also you trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believe you were sealed here we go with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest or down payment of all inheritance until the redemption of the purchase possession unto the priests of his glory so if this is a down payment it means it have more to come oh blessed be the name of the lord do you believe that and he was talking about uh you know the the tabernacle and the most holy place and so on he talked about iran and he said watch and them that took all the blood of the covenant the blood he was anointed he had garments on that had little jingle bells on them a pomegranate and a bell and that man here we go ahmad iran that man had to walk in such a way not just walk but walk in such a way watch that every time when he move his leg they played holy holy holy unto the lord so aaron couldn't walk just how he you know he just want to walk he had to walk away that the bells will ring and the bells ringing would be signaling holy holy holy holy unto the lord listen to brother branham you say what am i talking about hear it branham tabernacle you had your chance when a man once is anointed with the holy ghost to be adopted into the family of god to be positionally placed by the father and set into a service ordeal into his purpose of life of what god is calling for his war must be holy holy holy unto the lord that is what the anointing going to produce a walk a special walk hallelujah are you with me now watch but the branham is dramatizing oh you must turn a sight to this no holy holy holy unto the lord oh you must believe all what the elder said this but holy holy unto the lord not holy holy unto a group not holy holy unto a bishop or a message pope no holy holy unto the lord are you with me holy holy let his word be first let it be in everything here and settle it in your heart this is what has to happen now you have to settle it in your heart your walk must be in the word in other words it doesn't matter what bishop someone so said it doesn't matter what this group said it doesn't matter what the minister's association said it's got to be a walk in the world are you with me but abram is still dramatizing he said oh if you just come over here i'll tell you what we will do we organize and put you in our organization you'll be a great man no holy holy unto the lord it don't make a difference what anybody says are we coming on to that now now remember it wasn't the whole israel going to that most holy place it was one man it was an individual and listen to this the bible said god has made you kings and priests then you as an individual has to go in yourself with a certain walk holy holy unto the lord because you will be made kings and priests oh glory to god you wanna be seated glory to god listen to the buddha madam with call these tips do this do that no holy holy unto the lord you got your eyes set towards calvary and there's nothing going to stop you the very walk of your life you are walking on the king's highway anointed with the precious anointing oil moving into the holiest of the holy years oh you may be seated oh praise god what is he saying like raymond thompson says your connection becomes vertical not horizontal but vertical right now tonight the connections come vertical then horizontal when the angel dropped down we could speak to you it comes vertical then horizontal if you don't have the vertical you would need some man to connect to you or you will have to connect to some man but when you connect to the source of power when you connect to the headstone itself when you connect to i jesus that have sent my angel when you connect to the pillar of fire when you connect to that power source that comes down the angel of the lord it drops down he send ministering spirits that drops down or give the lord a shelter praise oh hallelujah glory to god you may be seated then i will walk must be in the word recognizing here we go no other headship what the word and i don't think the people get that the headship is nothing branham tabernacle the headship is nothing this tabernacle the headship is nothing some hookup connection no the headship is christ the mighty angel the word itself oh hallelujah hallelujah are you with me you may be seated and brother branham in christ the mystery of god real he said no watch oh this is a powerhouse he said the body and the head was stuck from the grave so the body must follow him back to eden where the head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bridegroom must follow the bridegroom because that's the head and when the head is revealed and come back with eternal life the body must follow that because it's husband and wife again as long as you are pregnant here we go with the same word which is his body you took his body you become in him then you took the word not accrete the word therefore the body cannot recognize any other headset [Applause] the church wants headquarters the church wants some head man but the body the bright body cannot recognize [Applause] the bright body cannot recognize any other hatred okay the lord i shout oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god listen to this the prophet you may be seated the prophet is driving it down listen the head is the word therefore denominations holy fathers and everything else is dead dung i'm reading we call it dead dong that is filled no holy father no holy denomination no only man no only pope if an angel comes from heaven we're going to smoke him out if he don't say what the prophets say that is what we're talking about oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god you may be seated i told my church when i come behind the pulpit i commit every weapon possible when i open this part of my jacket it have guns bombs open this part i have behind here i am loaded this is war oh hallelujah hallelujah when you think i don't have weapons i'll pull it all from behind here praise god all behind here but i am a war this is life and death or it could listen to this adam fell and he booked left his hands the book was sealed all creation is groaning because when adam fell the earth fell creation fell oh hallelujah so we fell down but when the lamb took the book it means that we are going to be restored when the lamb took the book it means that son's getting back the bible said when the lamb took the book they sang a new song not the same old song a new song and the song was we shall reign on the earth in other words heaven is not our destination heaven is part of the itinerary we are going up and we are coming back oh glory to god you heard what i said that's not the destination that's part of the itinerary we're going up the compact tongue but we going to reign on the earth because god has appointed man to have dominion oh glory oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah god said let us make man in our image and let that man have dominion so the image is connected to the book that's why the book was sealed the image is connected to the book because the image is connected to power the power of dominion oh hallelujah are you with me this is a brother branham then our headship i love this is a kingdom the kingdom of god is within you that's why jesus blow disciples man he said when they say low here come and get the connection here come and go there fifo is over there he said forget it behold the kingdom is within you oh glory to god the kingdom of god hala is the word becoming power in our life the devil is shaken tonight because we it's not possible that we might rain on the earth it didn't say we might rain on the earth it is it possibly will rain they say we shall [Applause] [Music] no but we shall reign on the earth or give the lord a shelter oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah you may be seated so god's original intent was for man to have dominion over the fish over the beast and brother branham came and demonstrate what god was talking about therefore he had to confront the bull to show there is power over peace there is power over the bull there is power over the beast there is power in the blood there is power here tonight oh glory to god its not tomorrow we are going to be the sons he said now are we the sons of god you have to talk like one you have to act like one you have to reflect one your son is just like his father and the father spoke and created just like that oh glory to god hallelujah are you with me tonight oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated please have a seat oh hallelujah oh praise the name of the lord oh glory hallelujah let's take a look at the program of god his holy spirit here he is trying to place his church to get his church in order and place it in the promised land so they could enter and all the enemies can be drove out god is not interested with the philistines and the hittites and the jebusites living with you if you don't drive them out they're going to stay with you they're going to terrorize you they're going to harass your church you better start to drive these philistines these hittites these jebusites these canaanites these amorites all the ice hallelujah hallelujah we are more than conquerors god has put all things under our feet hallelujah the glory to god amen you might be seated praise god you may be seated brother ibrahim manasseh can't take islam how are you going to act manaser won't keep us ground ephraim won't keep his ground god won't keep his ground when god blessed him somebody call him on the one and say you know what happened you should preach so and so and so and he said i want to know if i should preach that and what because he connected horizontal somebody sent him an email somebody sent him a text god he sent a text horizontal is man volatile is god when the elohim drop upon peter jesus said flesh and blood [Applause] so watch watch benjamin won't keep his ground they all run out here but the philistines all mixed up how are we going to be pleased we but we have been born by the holy ghost all of us is that right what are we born to watch we are predestinated here we go then after being born we are predestinated into the adoption watch to be pleased in the body of christ after you are born you may be seated all right so before jesus came forth as a manifested son after he was filled with the holy ghost he was led by the spirit into the wilderness to overcome the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of the earth the pride of life so jesus had to reign over his earth over his tongue over his flesh over his eyes over his desires over himself he conquered he conquered himself and was then ready to move on in the adoption ministry now the easier one is to rule a man like pope or mr francis or or like some president or so that's the easy part and we have these message popes who want to reign over people reign over others and they have no power over themselves but before jesus was sent out into the adoption ministry he had us to prove he had power over himself isn't that right because first john 2 said all that is in the world the lusts of the flesh the loss of the eyes and the pride of the life is not of the father but of the world so all that is in the world is either under the lust of the flesh or the lust of the eyes or the pride of life that is why the devil told eve hallelujah that tree is good when she saw the good she will see the tree she look at her eyes then the devil says good for food then he said gonna make your wise so since in the garden of eden it was introduced the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and once we could handle that and to put that under our feet we have overcome okay the lord i shout oh hallelujah are you with me this morning this evening may be seated adoption by the man what is everything waiting for what is the whole creation waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god it is waiting for the church to come in position oh hallelujah so now he's talking something different now it's not waiting for church we have thousands it waiting for the church to come in position that's different that that's different you may be caesar that's that's different that's it from jesus from he's 12 to 18 or 18 to 30 18 years it took jesus to write that seed and when he was right he went in the scriptures to find out his position in his isa 61 and went in the temple to read the spirit is upon me he was taking it present tense and bringing the word alive to himself he was anointing the promise to himself he was saying the spirit is upon me because he anointed me to perform these things because when the power come and come to do a work if you are ready for work yet no power coming to you if you are lazy there is no power coming to you if you are not interested in your father's business nothing is coming to you god looking for sons who could testify i am about my father's business not the association of ministers business no my father's business it's an individual affair you don't have a group father you only have one father oh glory to god no group is your father how not church is your father you only have one father that's the lord and the thing of it is this message that introduced is of adoption is to bring men to maturity not to stay as a little child where you have to be led and fed fed and people have to tell you don't go here don't do that there and stop doing that here no when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as a child but when i become a man forgive the lord let the men in the house out let me hear you brother when i become a man i put away childish thing oh glory to god god's objective is to bring you the christian maturity where you know what and how and what to do in the all trying times oh hallelujah you may be seated oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah god wanted to place his church sons and daughters listen about the man of god let me live to see it is my prayer it's so close you having a vision he's seeing you coming into power he's seeing all what's going to come upon you oh i feel a rumbling in the camp but the problems it's so close it's so close i could feel it with my hands almost that's what i longed to see waiting for the time there is a laying there from his mother's womb and we say look a book here's a tape to listen to no that's not what is here walk up to a and say silver and gold have i none [Applause] waiting watch for the manifestations of the sons of god when god will make himself known when they will stop sickness you know what that means arrest sickness lock it up oh hallelujah remove cancer remove the tumor let the walk the blind knight pop open look that's me talking about oh hallelujah are you ready for it [Applause] [Music] hallelujah oh glory to god we're going to rain on this earth on the earth we're going to reign over it we're going to reign over sickness over disease oh hell every any any condition whatsoever nothing going to stop this bride oh glory to god i have a sucker for you you're gonna have to mean over nothing at all say brother what you saying pour over nothing yes you'll create something there was no squirrel [Applause] there was nothing and he said let there be a squirrel so you will now power over nothing oh glory to god when there is nothing you're going to create hallelujah so there is no atmosphere but we could create it tonight oh hallelujah whatever you want you could have to may oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah they're going to stop cancer they're going to stop diseases you think cancer is cut something the bible said it's coming a time when men will rot in their flesh and the bosses will eat off the carcass before they even die cancer is a two take to what's coming but remember the horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who are the seal of god and that's what we are striving for now to get in one and be positionally placed now remember redemption is in two parts coming out of and going into if you only come out that's one part it's two parts you need the two parts for it to be completed but i have a word for you the bible said it said when the lamb took the book it says hando has redeemed us by thy blood so that means we're gonna get you the two parts we're gonna come out and you're gonna go into do you believe that that you ordained to go into into what the land of promise the holy ghost land oh hallelujah so we are striving to get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of god before these plagues strike inheritance you said jesus left your inheritance he said beg your pardon jesus never left the inheritance jesus never left you inheritance he only came down and paid for inheritance brought you to your inheritance your name was put in the lamb's book of life and god give you an inheritance your inheritance was first your inheritance was what your inheritance was first what inheritance did i have i didn't have any but god left me an inheritance and put my name on the lamb's book of life and god sent jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing i could do to inherit it it was blank but in the fullness of time god sent his own good time jesus the lamb slain from the foundational world the blood was shed that i might go to my inheritance so the blood was shed not for you to say i am saved thank you lord i'm saved no a little more than that the blood was shed for you to go to inheritance what inheritance to sonship [Applause] to be a son of god you may be seated oh hallelujah you mean my inheritance is sonship yes what kind of stunt chip the kind that adam had before the fall oh i'm not hearing you tonight that is what we are talking

higher than the animals he said we a little lower than the angels and he put all things under our feet some of you shaken tonight because you're never considered all things under your feet you feel the devil is over you but i'm saying that's a lie he is bluffing you tonight the word said god said he put all things under our feet all things all things we are more than conquerous tonight greater is he that's in you creator is he that's in you greater is he god's in you that he that is in the world oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah glory glory glory glory praise god let me say this to you elijah when he came down to the river he took his mantra and he struck the jordan river he didn't even talk [Music] he didn't have to talk when he strike the river do you even know what to do [Music] notice we could strike the water and open it up but when jesus come he decides he don't want to open it up he's going to walk on it we can do either one we can do either one open up or walk on it oh give the lord a shout oh oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now remember the destination is not heaven that's just past of the itinerary but god created it and placed man on this earth right now putin and obama and all them only temporary holding the position but we shall reign on the earth and the meek shall inherit the earth they can't stop us right now this is the satan's eden but we are coming back to take over but before we leave before we leave there'll be one blast there'll be one demonstration of what the power was supposed to be in the garden of eden there'll be one more ride oh glory glory glory glory to god when brother branham was alive they couldn't bring that foolishness they couldn't bring all the half the nonsense they have today because the prophet know the secret of the heart he could see through them from afar he knew all the tricks in the books god gave him visions and everything else but guess what the spirit of elijah is coming right back to rest upon elisha guess what there'll be another acts four guess what there'd be another acts 2. guess what they've been another acts 5 guess what the pillar of fire going to dwell in the sons of god in the last days who's going to stop it nobody could stop it hallelujah do you understand that the conqueror woman that caterpillar and the palm will eat down that tree and it's not man trying to restore god said i ah somebody's here god said i will restore unto you oh give the lord a praise give the lord a shout god set i oh glory hallelujah will restore unto you all the years you missed out all the years did they ever mess with your mind one of these days go go take the key up and think brought back your understanding god gonna bring back your right mind right now you have amnesia but god is bringing it right back because when the lamb took the book it wasn't for the lamb no the lamb took the pork it was for his wife that's why the mighty angel came along with the book open not closed but open and by the random evidence of the open book when he said little fishy i give you back your life that was an adamic son that was a son back in the garden of eden again vindicating the power that gonna be in the last day church little fishy i'll give you back your life and when the storm was coming that prophet said son come out and shine four days that was power over the elements that was joshua saying son stand still that's what the sun supposed to do speak and the word is created just like that one of these days we're gonna have a 15-minute service oh glory just 15 minutes and the power of god will be moving in your being every fiber you're being the minister will not be able to minister because of the glory of god because the glory of god going to fill the whole tabernacle oh glory to god his wife was sick he was in a next country and his wife was going into operation and brother spoke he said before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor very specific like the brother ulu not uh bless my wife lord uh touch my wife lord no no no we send an arrow straight to the tumor we can't miss [Applause] we are not going to miss we will be very specific john was specific he said we shall reign on the air oh give the lord i shout listen this is not fairy tale the evidence is already on the earth porter banham said little hearty right i give you your two boys he had power of salvation all of that is already on here the power of creation let there be a squirrel so nothing is not stopping him if there is nothing we'll create something so why we can't create a revival by required seven thunder i am telling you there is going to be a revival oh my my my my my okay hallelujah oh glory to god praise god i'm going to finish off with this hallelujah hallelujah in the last days the true church comes to the headstone will be a super church a super race hallelujah praise god do you believe that the last days there's gonna be a super church a super race isn't that right there will be so much like him we're not talking about talk now we're talking about images so he's saying in the last days this super church gonna be like him not the talk this is plentiful boa no arrows i call it verbal gymnastics flipping here and flipping here flipping words here and flipping doing some assaults and people who never see that way silly woman later divers lust ever learn and never come into the knowledge of the truth they have itchiness to hear new doctrine new teachings new revelations new mysteries that come out hidden from satan's black bag [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah but that bride going to be in his very image oh hallelujah brother branham said denominations can never produce this what is his image faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness broadly kindness battle with a mission because brotherly kindness you have to put yourself in your brother's place on the matter [Applause] you can't go around it you can't escape it that blood have to be upon you no ought no grudge because you have to conf you have to have confidence to speak the word so there have to be no condemnation hallelujah oh glory so then from a group of the true seed of the word god represent christ a beloved bride watch a virgin a version to his word that means no man's interpretation so no man can come and see his fivefold which fall is that it has fall and fall which pole is that it take dynamics to produce a five-fold save the dynamics and strike yet there's a fight for ministry yet you can't take out yet no man have the authority to take out yet that's a false authority dynamics have to strike the bride i want the dynamics strike the bride then sons position only place then they have to be tested or i thought i read no you know start these virtues have to be living and tested you can't tell me the living is only the test well proof of it living on it and i have news for you but i'm saying that devil make it prove it not brother of it you could pass by it's you and the devil oh hell you don't want to see him into that one [Applause] i didn't say that that's the word you know the devil will make you prove it that's why i'm fighting for every inch yes yes yes i'm not gonna sit back if i have to die i have a crook stick up here i'm gonna hold a cook stick here if i lose my teeth i'll use my gums but i'm gonna fight every way hallelujah are you with me because there is going to be revival in this land oh hallelujah praise god through them and by them will be fulfilled all that was promised to them by them what a church i could feel it i could sense it how i could sense it what a people a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people oh glory to god be one of them oh hallelujah i love this part notice the harmony jesus never did anything until the father shamed first he can do nothing and the bride will do nothing until you have thus said the lord oh hallelujah if they leave the church they went out from us because they were not of us so therefore there is no thunders without dying but i've not thunders without death i hear people preaching all kind of gospel there's no death in it there's no killing i just listen for that you know because i know i see it after going on the ground somebody mistakes something you see it said he taught i was a stone or a rock he didn't was a seed and he buried me that's the wrong thing to do i see him because once you bury it it will come forward so therefore this gospel has to come with that okay let me close god made man but obama said to predominate over the earth he had dominion he said in genesis when he make man he said i am yahweh javier jehovah what did it mean it mean i am the all-existent one who has created something or for myself to be a son of mine a temporary or an amateur little one of me so god was the reign over heaven and the sons reign on earth that was god's original intent but because of the fall with the introduction of the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and eve take up that tree we went through a process and god made the whole cycle must be born again get to the book the book reveal your name you go to the process bring it to positionally placed tested virtual image come right back to the image of god you're back to eden on the earth and the devil is confused oh give the lord a shout in the house oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to the lord amen praise the name of the lord praise god praise god praise god finally what about him said this great outpouring of god's spirit in the last days that's the thing to bring faith into the people that will take a rapture and fate that will take the church into glory and he said the church have to be rebuilt in the power of the spirit and the final quote i'm going to read he's talking about feasts of the trumpets he said this group here they've got two thousand bang on the river euphrates has been born for two thousand years the church has burned the holy ghost for nearly two thousand years under martyrdom but the whole the holy spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems but she is going to be liberated she is coming back the evening type message liberates the holy ghost god couldn't release the holy ghost as spirit because he wasn't ready for it yet so he released the holy ghost in the form of promises that by these promises you can become partakers of his divine nature to come back in god's image to come back to dominion may the lord bless you [Applause] hallelujah come on do something come on do something come on come on come on come on come on shall reign on the earth we shall reign on the earth tonight and never tell him testify to him we shall reign on the earth we shall reign on the earth come on give your testimony we shall see the king when he comes he's coming in power we're held a blessed hour give your testimony give your testimony be
