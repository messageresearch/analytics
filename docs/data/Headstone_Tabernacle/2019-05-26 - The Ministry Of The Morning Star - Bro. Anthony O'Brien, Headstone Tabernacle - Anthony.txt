world Amen anyway and I'll turn it over to Revelation chapter 2 I want to read from Luke 26 you mean Revelation 20 to read from verse 26 and says and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nation's and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to shivers even I as I receive of my father and I will give him the morning star he that an heir let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now reading revelation 22 and just two verses there revelation 22 and verse 16 which is I Jesus have sent mine

Ministry of the Morningstar and my subject is to him that overcometh a many-many man to him that overcometh so this morning this message is about overcoming and this age is about overcoming the devil

God in heaven you're gonna make it this morning Oh hallelujah I'm here to tell you that there is overcoming in you this morning there's more to you than meets the eye the devil hasn't met this bride yet but he's going to because greater is He that is in you this morning than he that is in the world greatest he does the devil in the world great is he new this morning hallelujah greater is upon you

Lombardi left lady she's waiting for her spirit to come to her she feels it out there she knows it's gonna happen she knows her healing is coming she knows the Holy Ghost it's just that's real it was on the pay up any cost real assets no here now we just been true it's not right that's love he's trying to get back in said after he put out his own house he was trying to come back in and said he'll open the door and I'll come in see whoever open the door see the church itself the whole and holes I put them out I said now notice his call here is not just the church he that overcomes see not to church that would be she he see the church body but is he not overcoming the individual he's speaking to he not personal pronoun you you that overcome you that put down your loss you that put down your line you that put down your idolatry you that put away other things and can't write with called you that praise you that cry out you that press you that forgive you that give up watch you have the right attitude you that display hallelujah or the right kind of a son the right kind of a daughter that is who he will adopt a man Judy individual he he that overcometh to him that him that goes all the way with the Lord what Allah give he give that Morningstar ministry it's nice hey man so we talk about a ministry in the morning stuff but it's to him that overcometh that's why I put the title on subject that we a man holiday is not right because it's condition you've got to overcome in order to get this ministry that is promised in this last thing holiday there's a condition to be met there's a requirement that must be fulfilled for you to get this kind of a ministry that perfect ministry to heal the sick raise a Ted that casts out Devils the triumphant spirit dwelling Christ is promised to live in this endtime bride if you can overcome hallelujah so the real question is can you take the world can you take the trials can you take the tests that he and his wisdom sends your way knowing what is in you that he had not made a temptation for you that he has not also made a way of escape for hallelujah is not he knows he does not give you more than you can bear [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] refiners fire they have to know how hot to burn this thing in the furnace it's got to be just the right temperature to get it to be able to move until pen he knows what

reflection will be the perfection so in all of him to see his reflection he's got to beat all of the stuff out of you that doesn't belong there until it come just like Christ and Jesus said of Ted I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire bought precious is your feet that is tried this morning than gold that perishes and that silver and all these things that parish shall we moved more precious this morning is a trial of a working patience hallelujah hallelujah non God waiting for God let me see the trials getting hotter and God wants to send some more but we crying out we say God

you're dead right until you rot to yourself rock to your own ideas holla till you become a dead man Oh hallelujah you can't kick a dead man they can't show to the dead man you can't call that I didn't better to call it or quarrel at the wrong shop then call it a dead man that man is dead pick up his hand he's dead because foot is dead you can't respond back to you and that's how God wants you dead

Ministry of Jesus Christ back in the church again that's what's promised today amen praise God hallelujah today we never to believe another ministry that glorifies a man or himself or another group or another thing it can't be that not when the Prophet said here it's got to come back to Christ himself back to the word itself Jesus at the center of it all at the center of your worship at the center of your walk at the center of your talk when we come together it must be Jesus Christ moving in and out among us he must feel free to move in and out among you among your conversations among your

tempted at every point isn't that right young brother is now right young sister that ought to encourage our hearts that Jesus was a teenager one time he went through stuff he was tempted but he learned obedience through the things that he suffered he had to suffer in order to enter into that place so - you must suffer halleluyah halleluyah must suffer many things but God will be glorified in
