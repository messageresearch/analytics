father we invite you this morning raise that standard lord that seven rainbow color standard that seven spirits hallelujah coming under the throne of god may you're sweeping here this morning in jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you and welcome if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to second timothy chapter two we want to read from verse 19 to 22. second corinthians chapter six one read from verse 14 to 18 and malachi chapter 3 we want to read from 1 to 3. read in 2nd timothy 2. nevertheless the foundation of god standed sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity iniquity is known to do right and doing wrong but in a great house they are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honor some to this honor if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel under honor sanctified and meet for the master's use and prepared under every good work free also youthful lust but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart we read from ii corinthians chapter 6 verse 14. be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship are righteousness with unrighteousness what communion had light with darkness what concord had christ with bear what part had he that believed with an infidel and what agreement had the temple of god with adults for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters said the lord almighty and let's read from malachi chapter 3 reading from verse 1. behold i send my messenger and he shall be peered away before me and the lord whom he seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom he delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeared for he is like a refiner's fire unlike fuller soap and he shall sit after as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness may god bless his word you may be seated [Music] good morning and god bless you greeting to those connected to us on the internet it's a blessing to be here this morning this morning i have a title it's the refiner's fire the refiners fire i have a subject the fiery trial which is the trial another inspiration purged vessels ready for the master's use that's my subject purge vessels ready for the master's use so we see how the lord will what the lord will do for us today the subject the fiery trial which is the trial is taking on the scriptures first peter 4 12-14 which peter said beloved think it not strange considering the fiery trial which is to try you or some as do some strange thing happen to you but rejoice in as much as your partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may also be glad with exceedingly great joy if he be reproached for the name of christ happy a ye for the spirit of glory of god rested upon you and for their part he's evil spoken of but on your part he's glorified so that is where i get that that subject from that uh content think it's not strange the fiery trials that come your way amen matthew 7 so read some scriptures today matthew 7 this is 15-29 this is jesus words it's in red beware of false prophets they are wrong they're always talking walking they coming which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are evening wolves you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grips of thorns or figs of tissues even so every good tree bringing forth good fruit but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not good fruit is hewn dog cast into the fire whereby by their fruits you shall know them not everyone that's under me lord lord shall enter the kingdom not the lord lord talk thing not that but watch but he that do it the will of my father which is in heaven so he is qualifying who going to enter he is qualifying how you get there not everybody hallelujah glory glory no no no he's talking about doing the will of the father all right many will say to me in that day lord lord have me not prophesied in thy name in thy name have cast out devils in thy name done many wonderful works then i will profess unto them i never knew you the part for me is at work iniquity so then the fine print is getting deeper and deeper as to what god requires of us and this is what you are here for to find out god's requirement for your life isn't that right and therefore jesus said whosoever heareth these things of mine and do with them i would liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock so this is jesus now sinking in the teaching at mysteries because mysteries was hit as parables he is sinking in now not to talk not to say lord lord but did i do the will of my father did i come into obedience to my word and to my will i will tell you what kind of man that is i'm going to tell you that kind of woman that is and yes he could begin to give his parable would have heard these scenes of mine hear it like everybody in the message hearing and do it amen i would liken them a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house it fell not before it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heard these things of mines do with them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sun the rain descended the floods came the winds blew beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it and when it came to pass when jesus ended these scenes the people were astonished at his doctrine and he taught them as one having authority and not as described i want to bring your attention to a particular thing here not the house built but the rain that's coming notice he didn't see the house built everybody was looking nice but that's nothing only the rain will prove what's it built on but ramp is a measure called the uncommon storm only the storm will vindicate what the house is built on only the trials only the judgment of fire would prove what works somebody had built on and it's coming it's coming to you to your home to your family to your job it's coming the churches is coming the marriages is coming yes every man gonna be tried yes whether it's sickness whether it's whatever it is it's coming and you can't stop it because it's coming amen are you with me hallelujah john and he's malachi 3 scripture when i'm random is malachi 4. john matthew chapter 3 i indeed baptize you with water and repentance this is john and he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes are not worthy to bear and this is where we first get this introduction he shall baptize you with the holy ghost on fire so before christ even make his appearance john was identified this man who coming after me he's not like me at all hallelujah i'm not even worried to lose his shoes he's coming with holy ghost and fire hallelujah whose fan is in his hand and he shall thoroughly push the floor and gather his wheat into the ghana but but you burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire then commit jesus unto galilee unto john to be baptized of him john forbid him saying i have need to be baptized of thee come as thou to me and jesus answered and said unto him suffer to be so now for us it'd be committed us to fulfill all righteousness and he suffered him and jesus when he was baptized so we're getting the continuation now john come to introduce his messiah here come the messiah he's following the scriptures he's not saying because i am this i do have to do that no he is humbling himself he's going the flow of the word he is obeying what god said he's fulfilling righteousness it looks like a small thing but he's going to get baptized and watch what happened here now and watch and straightway out of the water and lord of heavens to open up and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove lighting upon him and a voice of heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased oh hallelujah then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah and that jesus came with his earthly ministry pick up some men which he called disciples say be followers of me and i will make you fishers of men and he begin to take these natural men carnal men ordinary men men with jobs and everything else i begin to share the words of the kingdom with them and tell them they're going to be servants in this kingdom and they're going to be sanctified by thy truth and thy word is truth he sanctified them and then he began to begin to expound to them and demonstrate to them the the the powers of the kingdom demonstrated them the authority of the kingdom demonstrate to them the kind of things we will do in this kingdom by healing the sick and raising the dead and cast not devils and telling these same men the same words i do you're gonna do also because you're going to get a revelation of what kingdom you come from and my kingdom is not of this world and your kingdom is not of this world so don't let the world tie you up don't be unequally you don't tap yourself with unbelieving unbelieving people outside of there free yourself from that because you come from a higher order you come from a higher life you come from a higher kingdom altogether could we get a shout in the house [Applause] hallelujah and jesus let them straight up to his exact commission to them he said behold i send the promise of my father upon you hallelujah you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me flown in jerusalem unto the utmost part of the earth so jesus came and dropped their commission upon them to go into all the world and preach the gospel and the gospel wasn't involved only it was in power and demonstration so jesus had to empower these men with his spirit which was the promise from the father and they went in the upper room and they created an atmosphere in the upper room and they went one man and one accord and they were waiting they were believing they were repenting they were groaning they were travailing they were hiding they were fearful of the people on the outside but they had a promise from the father that the holy one was going to come and when the day of pentecost was fully come it was the right day it was the right time it was the right season it was godzilla suddenly hallelujah the pure fire hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the pillar of fire descended and each one get a portion answers he says no watch the promise of the baptism of the spirit which is promised all through the old testament and you too behold i send the promise of my father upon you and peter said that under the pentacles that is the promise the promise was never to build churches the promise was never to build groups i have a bunch of groups of people and say we have a group too the promise was the holy ghost that is still the promise in the old testament in the new testament isn't that right that is the promise here we go are you ready the promised land is to live in this land of holy spirit that is god's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit it's another world it's another land you have to come out of what the condition you have been in to live in that land you're not going to be getting born in that land that's why you tell abraham come out that's why he said be separated you have to make a sacrifice [Applause] you have to make an effort [Applause] hallelujah that's why i should make every effort to be part of the worship service because that is where you give to god this is the preaching service you come to hear at this point but when you're coming to singing and you come to give adoration and praise blessing and honor might and power and dominion [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's another world it's another land it's another world it's another land it's not hollywood it's not party and dance and fit it's not gambling and corrosive it's another world it's another land and don't let the devil say you can't live it you can't make it you can't get in it it's another world you have to come out of your world to get into this world it's another world it's another land it's the land of the holy spirit it's a land of power it's a land of prayer it's a land of praise it's a land of joy unspeakable and full of glory [Applause] the holy ghost fell under pentecost church was charged peter step out and say these people are not drunk as you suppose they were adopted sons healing the sick praising the dead first miracle was in front of the eyes a man crippled everybody see them crippled every day and jesus just take him and raise him up and say silver and gold have i none such as have i give it unto you he was releasing things from the kingdom peter became an extension of the kingdom kingdom power was vibrating to a peter he was like a circuit he was like a line of current flow into him he couldn't help it he couldn't help it it was just part of his being you can't help it you have to heal the you have to raise the debt you have to cast out there you can't help it [Applause] you have to overcome you can't help it you have to put your foot on the devil's neck you can't help it come on now oh glory you may be seated remember what god told abraham after you offered by zach i know you fear me and blessing i will bless thee and multiply multiply the anti seed not maybe not perhaps not god scratching his head wondering what the season last days will do god already know what we will do he told it to abraham seed shall possess the gates of the enemy there is no gate that could stop any seed of abraham yes that's the ability that's what god prophesied that's what god sees us don't wait i don't care what hell you have been through you will get hell hell back praise god i don't care what you have been through oh glory to god you're gonna take back from that devil whatever he took from you you're gonna take it back that's the authority that's back in the church could i hear a shout in the house [Applause] this this holy ghost fire that started on the day of pentecost what's the original fire [Music] every age had to get light off of that fire so the light that cannot suck you take the fat from ephesus and light it tell it i keep light and smoother i'm sad is that the light because that that church had the original light that is why william branham came to turn our hearts back [Applause] come on give me a shout in the house [Applause] so before you can go forward you have to go back and pick up what they had back [Applause] it's not a slip already these are the back side already because big shots coming to the church and they find this fault and that fault and they find they're supposed to be so and they're supposed to be so and then put this one in a special seat and what kind of stuff and then begin to dry up and use the earnestly contend for the fate that was once delivered to the saints god came and delivered it to the saints you supposed to walk home without faith lay hands on the sick in your house and i'm safe god's don't perish without faith pray without faith overcome with that faith the just shall live by faith you will be seasoned and in this last days it takes seven thunders to bring back that fate all seven seas have to be open and seven thunders one two three four five six seven and god bring them thunders to cut our bride out to keep that by faith oh glory to god we are back to the faith the faith has already been identified manifested in william mariam branham to be manifested in a body called a bride so then go out to joel other prophecies province to restore or what a conqueror woman the palmer woman the caterpillar lucas eat down comes to restore it by a four-fold message a four-fold revelation four full move of god so to speak there come loot with justification they can reside sanification god had to build this thing back up because god had to keep his own law his own word so you bring justification with luther someday and here come the pentecostals now to introduce the spirit age let me give a testimony from that age 1906 to 1909. frank battleman account as an eyewitness of what happened 1906 to 1909. the fire falls at azusa that's on the book nazuzu street chapter 2 fire fall in azusa just remember they know come out of the matter this age no fire the power was so much they were so sanctified ah god lord have mercy they left such clean lines you hearing that you listening certainly here you hear what i'm saying they live such clean lives that the holy ghost used to come upon them ready to fill them but they used to have a bucket of water when the power hit them so they throw water and they revive before they get the holy ghost so you qualify service in different days by having buckets of water when you see a dunk themselves that's what's real good think about it you're preaching on your buckets of water line up waiting for the power to fall and the power hit them so you throw water and revive them up because it is not yet for the holy ghost 1906. god said behold i set before me an open door no man messenger in that door god himself opened that door no pastor prophet evangelist no man just god bless that door open hallelujah behold i said before they an open door it was an open door age holy ghost moving nobody could stop the holy ghost they were all on one level my god in barnyard no air condition sweaty people no under arm you can't complain about who i'm smelling all the one of us holy ghost no makeup praise god hallelujah no no musical instrument they were singing in the spirit or they were singing the songs of god singing the blood songs old-time religion hallelujahs fire falls on azusa street i wonder where the fire gonna fall next because there's a bride that is waiting for fire oh don't let me get outside of the priest right now there's a braggart we fired up tax yes goggles and a fire bomb i'm believing it today i believe in this is the hour oh i give the lord a shout in the house [Music] you might be seated this is frank baklaman testimony mercury i went to buban called the new testament church sunday morning april 15th a black sister was there spoke in tongues this created the greats too the people guarding the little companies on the sidewalk after the service inquiring what this mean just one person speaking tongues what mean at this this is new now you know this is we never had this before so this is all together new they're talking about it on the sidewalks enquiring what this mean it seems like a pentecostal science we then learned that the spirit had fallen a few nights before april night at the little cottage on burning bridge street they had been tearing very earnestly for some time for our porn a handful of black and white believers had been waiting there daily for some reason i was not privileged to be present at that particular meeting i went to bonnie bermuden in the afternoon however and found god working mightily we have been praying for many months for victory months months months praying for victory that have to come you're not wasting your time you're not wasting prayer praying for virtue that must come god promised victory god promised our holy ghost god promised a clean church a glorious church without spot without wrinkle [Applause] don't stop praying [Applause] can i be seated say but over i'm struggling keep struggling don't stop if you stop you die [Applause] when that worm scrolls on the ground and he's spinning that web around him and inside that there's a change going on wrong that worm is about to become a butterfly isn't that right and you have to press this way isn't that right the chicken of the presence wait what about you you have it too easy and the truth is you're too lazy thirty percent say amen on that they don't want to confess their laziness before god amen you're not confessing to me you're confessing to god if you're lazy or lazy [Applause] you know who i'm talking to you know yourself please need to pray listen to prayers this is the terry listen to worship there is a pressure way let it even get up in the morning and say i'm glad when they said unto me let us go in the house of god [Applause] but i will restore say the lord he's not waiting on you he's going to restore anyhow okay the lord has shout in the house [Applause] jesus pursued himself a life again the pioneers had broken through for the multitude to follow i like that the pioneers broken through for the monetary to follow there's got to be somebody some people who take front to cut the trail to pray out to cry out oh we had a powerful parameter on tuesday gone oh long time i hear the believers crying out like that praise god a powerful permit until you say hallelujah why don't you come to prayer meeting on a thursday night what do you do on thursday night even if you're not coming to the church you should be in prayer from half a seven to half past nine don't get off a prayer until half past nine reach because that's the time we pray not to almost but terry give some god some time there put your deposit in lord we pray for revival pray for breakthrough pray for the rivers are boxing backsliders pray for people half dead insider here don't need a body here the spirit of the soul somewhere else [Applause] [Music] pray for deliverance for holy bunch womans are those not serious there was a general spirit of humility manifested in the meeting they were taken up with god amen amen evidently the lord had found a little company at last outside as always through whom he could have his way god had not chosen an established mission where this could be done there they were in the hands of men the spirit could not work others far more pretentious had failed that which man esteems had been passed by once more and the spirit was born again in a humble stable outside the ecclesial establishment amen our body must be prepared in repentance and humility for every opponent of the spirit there is no outpouring of the spirit without preparation amen hallelujah god's in a message of preparation john was sent to prepare for the coming of the lord who shall stand when he comes and he come in like a refiners fire what are we going to get on into it oh hell but he's coming away with me for him to come and he's coming he's right on his way isn't that right glory the present world by pentecostal manifestation did not break out in a moment like a huge prairie fire and set the wall on fire in fact no work of god ever appears that way there is a necessary time for preparation the finished article is not realized at the beginning men may wonder where it come from not being conscious of the preparation but there is always such every movement of the spirit of god must also run the gauntlets of the devil's forces the dragon stands before bearing up the bearing mother ready to swell up her child so it was with the present pentecostal work in the beginning the enemy did much counterfeiting god kept the young child well hit for a season from the herod's until it could gain strength and deserving to resist them the flame was guarded jealously by the hand of the lord from the winds of criticism jealousy unbelief and so on it went through about the same experiences that all revivers have it phones were both inside and out both luther and wesley experience the same difficulties in this time we have this stretch and eaten vessels every natural birth is surrounded by circumstances not entirely pleasant god's perfect work is brought about in oh oh i'll just skip that every natural bird is surrounded by circumstances not entirely pleasant john wesley himself once prayed after revival had about died out for the time oh lord send us the old revival with all the defects and if this cannot be send it with all of his defects we must have a revival [Applause] oh god what a man of god what a man of god 735 without the defects but lord if this cannot be sent by the defects we must have a revival hallelujah praise god adam clark said no nature along with satan will always mingle themselves as far as they can in the genuine work of the spirit in order to discredit and destroy it in great revival of religion it is almost impossible to prevent wildfire from getting among the true fire oh holland people would say so then they move from bunny bay street to 312 azusa street so the spray began to move in bonny berry street they switched to 312. tristan number 312 azusa street here that rented an old frame building formerly a methodist church in the center of the city but now a long time out of you from eaton a receptable of all lumber plaster other materials they are cleared space enough in the surrounding dirt and debris to lay some plants on top of empty nail kegs which seats enough for possibly 30 people if i remember rightly they were arranged in a square facing one another so it was a square entire amount was 20 people just hold it i was under tremendous pressure to get to the meeting that evening it was my first visit to azusa mission mother wheaton was living with us was going with me she was so slow that i could hardly wait for her we finally reached azusa and found about a dozen saints dear some white some black but a sema was dear in charge the ark of god moved slowly but surely at azusa it was kind in the show of his own appointed priests in the beginning we had no new cat in those days to please the colonel mixed multitude we had the devil to fight but the ark was not drawn by oxen zombies the priests were alive unto god too much preparation and prayer discernment was not perfect and the enemy got some advantage that brought reproach to the work but the saints soon learned to take forth the pressures from the vial the combined forces of hell were set determinedly against us in the beginning it was not all blessing in fact the fight was terrific as always the devil calmed the country for crooked spirits to destroy the work if possible they will look for them and send them to the church send them to the revival say you have to go there but the fire could not be smothered gradually the tide arose in victory from a small beginning a very little flame was kindled i gave a message at my first meeting in azusa two of the same spoken tongues such much blessings seemed to attend the utterance it was so noisy abroad that god is working at azusa and all kinds of people begin to come to the meetings many were curious and unbelieving others were hungry for god the newspapers began to ridicule and abuse the meetings that's given us free advertising this brought the crowd the devil overdid himself again oh my my my my my my my hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god can any good thing come out of nazareth oh glory to god hallelujah can any good thing come about this seven thunder bride that what kind insider there yes a real revival seven thunder revival holy ghost revival oh glory to god hallelujah the devil over there themselves outside persecution never heard the work we had the most fear from the working of evil spirits with him spiritualists hypnotists came to investigate and to try the influence then all the religious saw is crooks cranks came seeking a place in the works remember in paul time he said give me that power that paul had that we could do that too come on devil in the name of jesus paul preacher so this is not a new thing them looking for power without character looking for power they're not authorized to have so watch we had the most to fear from these but this is always the danger to every new work they had no place elsewhere this condition casts a fear over many that was hard to overcome it hindered the spirit much many were afraid to seek god for fear the devil might get them then came the earthquake san francisco earthquake the earthquake was surely the voice of god to the people on the pacific coast so god had everything lined up you know the anointing the people the earthquake that just take it the next level together it was used mightily in conviction for the revival the lord graciously brought afterwards in the earlier days both heaven and hell seem to have come to tongue [Music] this is this is serious men were at the breaking point conviction was mightily on the people they would fly to pieces even on the street without provocation our very bloodline seemed to have been drawn around as those are missioned by the spirit where men came within two blocks of the space they were seized with conviction amen the work was getting listening the work was getting clearer and stronger at azusa god is working mightily it seems that everyone had to go to azusa missionaries were gathered from africa india the islands of the sea preachers and workers across the continent and come from distant land with an irresistible drawing to los angeles gather my saints together they are coming for pentecost though they literally realize it it was god's call holiness meetings tents missions begin to close up for lack of attendance their people were at azusa brother and sister god closed the burning bush wall came to azusa received the baptism of the spirit and was soon on their way to india to spread the fire even but there was much there was there was much persecution especially from the press they wrote us up shamefully but this only drew the crowds gave the work six months to live soon the meeting was running day and night the place was packed out nightly the whole building upstairs and dung had now been cleared and put into use there were far more white people than black people coming the color line was washed away in the blood of jesus christ he said uh a s warrior a translator of the new testament declared his rules of work had rediscovered the blood of christ to the church at the time great emphasis was placed on christ's blood for cleansing and more a high standard was held up for a clean life oh my and that has a return a high standard for a clean life a consecrated life a holy life a dedicated life isn't that right divine love was wonderfully manifest in the meetings the people will not even allow an unkind word said against the opposers of the churches or the churches the message was the love of god it was a sort of fullest love of the early church return the baptism of the holy spirit as we received in the beginning did not allow us to think speak or hear evil of any man the spirit is very sensitive tender as a dove the holy spirit is symbolizes a dove we knew the moment we had grieved the spirit by an unkind thought or word we seem to live in a sea of pure divine love the lord fought our battles for us in those days we were committed to his judgment fully in all matters and never seeking even to defend the work of ourselves we live in this wonderful immediate presence are you getting the picture of what we had back there we live in this wonderful immediate presence and nothing contrary to his pure spirit was allowed there the false was sifted out from the real by the spirit of god the word of god itself decidedly absolutely look i like this the word of god itself decided absolutely all issues and we have to come right back to that well all issues is settled by the word of god no matter how you feel i know you think and what is brother saying another one's saying and no no by the way what did the word say hallelujah the heart of the people in act and motive was searched to the very bottom love that let me read it again the hearts of the people watch both in act and motive was searched to the very bottom it was no joke to become one of that company no man this joined unto them it was no joke unless they meant business it mean a dine out and clean up process in those days to receive the baptism it was a little more than going to church no it was a little more than that that occupied a pew it was a little more than that it was people coming for the baptism of the holy ghost people coming to be sealed people are coming for the mark of god oh can we give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] we had a tyrion room upstairs for those especially seeking god for the holy spirit baptism though many got it in the main assembly room also in fact they often got it in their seats in those days the spirit worked very deeply in the tearing room an unquiet spirit or thoughtless talker was immediately reproved by the spirit that means the spirit are arresting people yeah cause i'm talking talking talking no there's a different atmosphere together you have to reference and respect the operation of the spirit of god isn't that right we were on holy grounds the atmosphere was unbearable to those with a common spirit they can't wait to leave they generally give this room a white bird unless they have been totally subdued and burnt out that means they get out they cannot they can handle it only honest seekers sought it those who really mean business with god it was no place to throw fits or blow off steam men did not fly to their lungs in those days they flew to the mercy seat they took their shoes off figuratively speaking they were on holy ground oh my so that was the little caption that i have from azusa street kind of atmosphere you appreciate it god had this man as a witness to the atmosphere that he fights and the battles that they had itself this is brother branham you take a chicken egg and put it in an incubator which should be under hand it will hatch anyhow put it under pop it will hatch it's the warmness it's the condition that makes it hatch you could take a good live egg put it on that dead end it won't hatch it's the condition and that's the weight in this age we're living in you've got to find what is god's way of doing it for this age that's what martin luther found that's what john wesley found that's what the pentecostal found in their age now watch the pentecostal there was a brother one of his eyes was out a colored brother he's seymour who was like the lead person in that revival okay so one eye out she's like a one eye mandarin if people choose anyone choose the one i man but god choose that man all right he was laughed at because he was a negro he was made fun of but he brought a message for that age just a little boy but a buddy a little buddy fellow could have said his own name but the lord had revealed to him that this was the age for the restoration of those gifts that was his revelation in the season and time for the gifts of tongues and interpretation of tongues all these gifts and healing to be restored hallelujah we are beyond the methodist church hallelujah being a season when god promised to restore these things all right let's go further and the lord revealed to him and no matter what said it come but everybody here we go god in the atmosphere of it and see the word the age and god vindicated and then here it comes did you see what seymour did now he saw the revelation and everybody came in the atmosphere of it what about you this morning we have a promise of dynamics oh glory to god we have a promise of a holy ghost revival the person of god be restored back back in the church hallelujah praise god and then baram says in influence what we have seen in these last days ourselves shall put each one of us into action but you know why we don't cover our faces on our feet right our wings won't work we got these things spread out cover yourself humble yourself what we have seen happen should put every soul in action it should make a church that will make a revival in phoenix that people will be flying in from europe that's what a revival caused people to fly in people that come in people want to know what is happening oh praise god flying from europe to see what's taking place they will say there's an uh there's a place in arizona called maricopa valley a city called phoenix there is something broke out here until the seven thunders of revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the bible is being made manifest he's not talking about the sermon he's not talking about the special message he's talking about a literal manifestation of god that is promised and god promised a manifestation of god to the bride he said a bride has not a revival yet there has been no manifestation of god to stir the bride he will send it not a preacher bring it he will send it we preach the promise of it but he will send it are you looking for it are you part of this bride then if you are part of this bride god will come suddenly to his temple oh hallelujah oh glory that's what the scripture says hallelujah he will come when he's ready to come but he's going to come oh give the lord a shout in the house you don't know when he's going to come but he's coming [Applause] buddha burnham was recognized as the nominal leader in charge we had no pope there's a man continuing now we have a next part of it i'm reading here now we had no purple hierarchy we were brethren we had no human program the lord himself was leading we had no priest class no priest craft these things come in later with the apostasizing of the movement we didn't even have a platform or pulpit in the beginning we were all on the same level the ministers were servants so they didn't even have an elevated platform or pulpit everybody on the same level that's how it was zazusa old time shouting oh glory hallelujah the ministers were servants according to the true meaning of the word we did not honor men for their advantage it means or in means or education but rather on their god-given gifts he said the members in the body now a wonderful and horrible thing is is to come to pass in the land no okay i'm just keeping something this is a scripture a wonderful and horrible thing has come to pass in the land the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people love to have it so and what will be the end thereof that is jeremiah so my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them isaiah 3 12. but the seymour generally sat behind two empty shoe boxes one on top the other he usually kept his head inside the top of one unipre meeting in prayer there was no pride there the services ran almost continually seeking souls could be found under the power almost any hour night and day the place was never closed nor empty the people came to meet god he was always there hence a continuous meeting the meeting did not depend upon a human leader god's presence became more and more wonderful in that old building with his low rafters and beer floors god took strong men and women to pieces and put them together again for his glory low rafter mud floor strong men and woman broken before the power of god oh what will happen when that pillar his sent once more like he descended on monk sinai it was a tremendous overhauling process pride self-assertion self-importance self-exceed esteemed could not survive there the religious ego preaches his own funeral sermon quickly no subjects or sermons were announced ahead of time no special speakers for such an hour no one knew what might be coming what god will do all was spontaneous ordered of the spirit we wanted to hear from god to whoever he might speak we had no respect of persons the rich and educated with the dame as the poor and ignorant and found much harder today you're rich finding the heart of there today we only recognize god all were equal no flesh my glory in his presence he could only use the self only he could not use the self only recognized opinionated those were holy ghost meetings led of the lord it had to start in the poor surroundings god all were equal no flesh my glory in his presence he could not use the self to keep all this selfish human element all came down in humility together at his feet they all look alike that's what baram talked about all look alike isn't that right had all things in common all came down in humility together at his feet they all look alike the rafters were low the tall must come down by the time they got to jesus they were humbled ready for the blessing the food was displaced for the lambs not giraffes all could reach it oh praise god we were delivered right there listen we were delivered right there from ecclesiastical heritage like hierarchism nice pope and bishop and this sort of thing and abuse we wanted god when we first reached the meeting we avoided as much as possible human contact and greeting remember yesterday you see what happened in politics we're here don't make nadia please amen you're coming for god you're coming to me the pillar of fire it has to change from coming i'm going to church i'm going to see yesterday no you're coming to meet god they come and wait and god speak to me there's got to be a word in this service here that i know is god speaking to me you know my needs you know my condition you know what's in my home you know what's in my house i need a deliverance i need a breakthrough i need an answer i need to hear from you speak [Applause] we got our heads under some bench in the corner in prayer and met men only in the spirit knowing them after the flesh no more the meetings started themselves spontaneously in testimony and praise and worship the testimony were never hurried by a call for popcorn we had no pre-arranged program to be jammed through the time our time was the lord's we had real testimony some fresh heart experience otherwise the shorter testimonies the better a dozen might be on their feet at one time trembling under the mighty power of god we didn't have to get a cue from from our leader we were free from lawlessness we were shut up to god in prayer in the meetings of our mind on him all obed god in meekness and humility in honor we pray for one another the lord was liable to burst through anyone we prayed for this continually hallelujah some will finally get up anointed for the message all seem to recognize this and give way it might be a child a woman a man it might be from the back seat from the front it made no difference we rejoice that god was working no one wished to show himself we thought only about obeying god in fact there was an accuracy of god there that forbid anyone but a fool attempting to put himself forward without a real anointing i think that word reading again i think that word reading again hallelujah in fact there was an atmosphere of god there that forbid anyone but a fool attempting to put himself forward without a real anointed and such did not last long the spirit from the throne controlled the mittens those were truly wonderful days i often said i would rather live six months at that time than 50 years of ordinary life everybody alive everybody receiving this is our history we can't deny luther we can't deny wesley we can't deny pentecost no this is our history [Applause] but god is just the same today only we have changed someone might be speaking suddenly spirit fall upon the congregation god himself would give you all the call men would fall over the house like a slain in battle or rush for the altar in mass to seek god the scene also often resemble a forest of fallen trees such a scene cannot be imitated i never saw an altar called given in those early days god himself would call them hallelujah such a scene cannot be imitated god himself would call him and the preacher knew when to quit when he spoke we all obeyed it seemed a fearful thing to hinder or grieve the spirit the whole place was steeped in prayer like that amen steeped in prayer not a little dip you know you know when you have your ill tea bag you could depend and pull it out you know die no tea you know to get the tea you have to steep it and leave it inside of it here it takes time for it to steep it takes time to get along in prayer it's in a good morning longer even lord it takes some time we need to get some tyrion time oh hallelujah praise god as bahram says when you're about to get a breakthrough here come the mosquito bite to him there comes something stinging him something buzzing around his head when you're about to get a breakthrough i don't know when you're bought the vehicles you walk on a torch coming this coming that coming the phone ringing somebody knock on your door when you're about to get a breakthrough but you keep pressing on [Applause] the whole place was steeped in prayer god was in his holy temple it was for man to keep silent the shekinah glory rested there in fact some claim to have seen the glory by night over the building i do not doubt it i have stopped more than once within two blocks of the place and prayed for strength before i dared to go on the person of god was so real did you hear that two blocks from the place the presence of god is so real he asked for strength to go on oh how the are falling in the streets two blocks people getting healed on their way to the building people getting healed the anointing emanate him god himself came into the temple into the house of god oh are we gonna have a repeat oh glory to god it will be greater than that [Applause] [Music] the presence of god was so real presumptuous men would sometimes come among us especially preachers who tried to spread themselves in self opinion but their effort was short-lived the bread would be taken from them their minds would wander their brains real things were turned black before their eyes they could not go on i never saw one of them get ready in those days i remember my time my brother coming he come with communism first time coming walking with his guitar i got somebody still looking he worked very good he wanted to know he could play guitar i want to know what kind of life behind that church i'm not going to play i want to know who are you i wanna know what spirit behind you oh yeah we had all kind of cooks coming here you know oh from sky water now oh it's crazy one brother come to the church he said everywhere i go people call me to pray oh every church you go to these pastors come to pray to pray i say oh i tell myself he doesn't know me not this church really no way all kind of characters are like these stories here we wouldn't leave here today you know i overcome every one of them every single one of them whatever brother driving with me i i i like an extra pastor and he drives with me next to micah he's getting plenty trouble you know he's he telling me that i tell myself he don't want more trouble on me he's telling me he's good when he goes he's going to play any job are you supposed to follow that okay brother wow his spirits and as that preacher was powerful thank you for the message that god bless you for that last bit last week the demons was not given legion leave to go see jesus so jesus had to go to him that's powerful so demons could keep people from the altar demons keep people from deliverance demons keep people from confession demons keep people on their breakthrough but because that man was a seed jesus need to go to the other side [Applause] glory other sides have pigs other sides have no fancy church other side don't have a lovely group singing your songs but they have a seed on the other side and jesus didn't say i ain't going over now he's going still the devil tried to rock him and out him and out him but jesus was going still oh glory to god that's when a man anointed and commissioned when they wake jesus with that storm he said peace be still and that storm wrap itself like a baby put on his cover overalls and went and sleep oh glory to god packed that storm and sent him to sleep and the ship keeps sailing on oh hallelujah and legion with all them demons on him when he sees jesus he ran he didn't walk he ran and he began to worship oh glory to god he's at last at last i see my deliverer coming at last i see my breakthrough coming the lord suddenly come step on that shore deliverance time had come whenever you see god your time has come you've got to see him you've got to recognize him and when you recognize him your time has come the devil is finishing your life devil is finishing your home devil is finishing your marriage or give the lord a shout out my glory these presumptuous men he said they were up against god no one cut them off no one cut them off we simply prayed amen the holy spirit did the rest amen is brave enough to come and then this i want to read the card or something who they are ending spread cut them off all right watch osprey did the rest we wanted to spread the control he wound them up in short order they were carried out dead spiritually speaking they generally bit the dust and humility going through the process we've all gone through in other words they died out came to see themselves in all their weakness then in childhood humility and confession were taken up of god transformed to the mighty baptism of the spirit the old man died with all his pride aragon said good works in my own case i came to abhor myself i begged the lord to drop the curtain so close behind me on my path that it would hit my heels he told me to forget every good deed as though it had never occurred as soon as it was accomplished ending for him at least my good works would become a snare to me abhorrence of good self not bad self oh give the lord a shout in the house i hate myself what self is that that's the good self denies you who do curse and do swear and who do this that's you you ought to hate that too so then you have nothing to boast about hallelujah you have nothing to boast about because your good self is filthy your night self is filthy your nice mess itself it's no good it has to die fire after coming hallelujah not your fire the refiners fire oh hallelujah oh give the lord some praises people hallelujah we saw wonderful things in those days even very good men came to abhor themselves in the clearer light of god the preachers died the hardest because they could coat and they could preach and some people businesses and but when they still have fire all right look look look look look at saul it's alright and hard going to the pacific christians yesterday both next week and next year and and next 40 years you know he got a great question when he's prepared today when you pick up his his notebook for today puts the good christians that's what he have on his calendar and he's writing hard on the pillar fire lick him off let him bite some dust who are the lord you know who that is when that fabric in the movie don't know who that is there be no wondering i wonder could it be whatever it is it'll look could it be you know no no whatever it is you know don't have that you know oh who are the lord i am jesus [Applause] whom don't persecute us you ain't touching my sins i am in my sins and when you touch them you touch me i am jesus whom not persecuted because i'm gonna walk in them i'm gonna live in them they are the temple of the holy ghost oh glory hallelujah until the preachers died the hardest when god got you with them they gladly turned a new pageant capture that was one reason they fought so hard death is not at all a pleasant experience strong men die hard [Music] strong men die hard what a time is coming oh this bright wind for a wonderful time it will be hot and heavy but we in for tremendous time in the lord oh praise god for the pranam from sisters the time he says now a mystery scripture a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but a supernatural elements to remain despite the revelation a scripture a mystery of scripture isn't that right a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed it means revealed by the spirit somebody could be actually inside here 20 years and god revealed himself to them and you can't stop that that is flesh and blood heart not reveal it to you so i could preach but to take the spirit to reveal it to you that's why you have to come in the spirit because the spirit can then reveal it to you and that's the rock that you build this church on that's the rock the devil can't touch that's anchored in your soul the devil can't go there because it's a word to deserve the thoughts and intents of the heart so when god dropped that in your soul devil can't touch that he can't go behind there he have no reason to go behind you he is not the word so though your flesh may act up your flesh may feel there's a rock that god put inside of you a seed inside of you that is ready to anoint with fire baptism of fire that's he gonna come alive are you gonna manifest what's inside of you oh glory to god glory to god listen peter was jesus he wrote you know he was a son of god and he was a soldier you know the devil seemers are miserable this and miserable that and jesus said that i prayed for you that everyone was sitting like wheat but i prayed for you what for what for that your faith failed not because of your faith fail everything fall down your christian life is based upon faith my feet are coming this morning i know this is not an easy message but i got to preach it because that is what he gave me to preach and i don't question what i'm given i don't preach what i feel like that entice your ears these are things you need to know it's not easy to preach this kind of gospel but this is what you need to know because this will help you to grow to understand when we get to the spot listen when we finish the devil not even in the picture let me say it again when we are finished you would see the devil not even in the picture [Applause] it's just the potter on the clay [Applause] and if you're gonna rema if you're gonna submit yourself and surrender yourself yourself to his moulding all right but the prana he said no i know my uh he said okay now elijah will not be a system it will be a man he'll be a one man anointed of the holy ghost and he won't introduce any three or four gods he will introduce one the lord jesus christ because his message will shake the pentecostal children back to the fate of the fathers again so this is the message of malachi 4 to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers again according to malachi 4 is to bring them back to the faith which was once delivered to the saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers the pentecostal part in the restoration time let me take that slowly let's take that slowly to bring them back to the fate here we go the pentecostal part in the restoration time oh yeah people are books and tapes but where is the pentecostal part yes you're saying restore and restore where is the pentecostal part because that is what happened on the day of pentecost [Applause] and the holy ghost has to be made real to the people again that's why people are not seeking the holy ghost is no longer real but it's going to become real again oh there's a real holy ghost there's a real baptism there's a real power there's a real presence there's a real transformation [Applause] i think that would reason again bring them back the faith of the fathers the pentecostal part in the restoration time i will restore share the lord the real event end time evangelism oh praise god and jesus asked the question when the son of man cometh shall we find faith on the earth or will these guys cheat us the people out of the fate question when the son of man cometh not gonna reveal himself when he comes shall we find faith on the earth got to have faith on the earth i don't care what's wrong with you i don't care if hell itself inside your house shall we find feet on the earth or somebody gonna have that faith my god and the fine sells kingdom defy satan's kingdom that faith defies everything that fake common things are not as though they were abraham look at syria and say lying symptoms praise god woman you're gonna have that child praise god i don't know who you are that baby is coming because god said so i didn't promise it god promised it isaac is coming ready or not he's coming [Applause] that's the kind of faith god started off with that fate and tested that fate it's the fate of god that's why they tested it that's why the faith has come true that was the ibrahim faith that was god's fate in abraham so when god dropped that on abraham as a revelation he had to stand the test imagine you know god could have talked to ac iran ibrahimo oh yes god could have been the both of them say here and abraham behold my children and come in and you're going to be blessed i'll have a child and he will happen your body will be changed what not the other worry about nothing did you have faith no more when god dropped that bomb on ibrahim i said abraham you you are the man i know you're old but you have a child you share and whatnot and just just walk away and ibrahim go into this area excuse me i want to talk to you later because i'm cranky already and you know he can just drop that on sarah said the creativity right atmosphere lighter candle and put some flowers in the krita atmosphere they're ready sitting on dr terra i say syria we have dinner tonight i have something special to tell you the lord appeared unto me and told me that we gonna have a son and we don't have a name already his name when we call isaac say so shall i see it be he's not looking at the arena you're looking at this me the episode already created you ever give a testimony you can't look at syria you don't know how sarah are going to be here you're not looking at sir are you you're looking at the promise of god lord help me jesus glory well after abram say that sarah is mute sarah can't talk sarah have nothing to say she eats she just walks and go and sleep and the babies abraham staggered at the promise of good to unbelief but was strong in faith giving praise giving glory to god and he was fully persuaded that what god has promised he was able to perform do i hear a shout in the house [Applause] sit down a minute so let's say you have cancer you have leukema you have kidney you have some kind of problem you tell me you can't believe god like that i don't care what the doctor said i don't get to the last minute i will still believe god just like abraham did that's the faith that god gave me i don't have to accept nothing you'd ever want to give me oh nothing you want to offer you have a right to attack you have a right to do this and do that's his right what is my right when the lamb took the book what is my right when he took the book for me what is my right i could claim my healing i could clean my deliverance i could clear my victory [Applause] [Music] no relax i'm not in a hurry i'm in a groove and a special anointing for this service so i'm i'm okay i'm fine oh glory to god i'm staggered nothing like that have no car i had no cold drink i like cold drinks ibm didn't have that i had no fast food either i didn't say i like that [Laughter] but it stays nice like they react a little bit but abraham amidst all that desert circumstance he believed god and god yes counted his faith as righteousness without any works he believed god and god called him as righteous [Applause] for believing a promise that seemed so impossible how on earth could this bribe be transformed after 40 plus years waiting on the promise of the father from malachi 4 dynamics to the mechanics he said the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost oh man i feel like jumping though the prophecy the dynamics of this church [Applause] what am i supposed to look for what am i supposed to expect might have some bums inside here you won't be seated [Applause] the capstone haven't dropped yet so what love groups have let's feel your love have a quote on the one called friendship love all right they're not capstone well the group i go to they're so loving they're so kind here with all the capstone they have more love together because they love that god talking about in this hour is not gonna fill your business everybody love their own even jesus bless his own disciples he said you do better than that you're a veteran everybody pharisee like they own they have love among themselves sadducees of their own and that's how they say he's the best that you see in the whole wide world yes because you give me this and you give me that fine all the groups love their own but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about agape love talking about divine love that does the will of god come on now help me jesus [Applause] what would drive jesus to go to their side it's not the love of god for that soul bombed by those endeavors and jesus proven something to us don't let them devils stop you [Music] the bible described the man's condition they kind of chained him up he breaking his chin the couple closed at him he got all closed when jesus finished with him the man dressed in his right mind man fully clothed study the stone once they come in on my stone somewhere watch this protocol look for this stone the clavicle light for every goliath for every goliath in my life there got to be a stone somewhere if i could only find that stone i'm going to deal with that goliath i'm going to be with my goliath once i can find that stone lord show me that stone [Applause] maybe season so there's faith of the fathers turn back to the faith of the father seven tons give feed this feet of the son of god this feat is to be tried gold and silver doesn't come out of the ground pier you know they're gonna get pure gold your silver are going and sell it that the magnet and dig it out and it doesn't look nice sometimes it doesn't even recognize what it really is until fire until the gold smith or the silversmith began to deal with it when god called you out you really wasn't looking nice now [Applause] god [Applause] don't let the dirt fool you don't let my failures fool you don't let the sin fool you because when the refiners fire come upon my life hallelujah i shall be asked your goal [Applause] notice when jesus received the spirit it led him straightway into the wilderness to be tested to be tempted and when we come into the adoption time and that's what we're heading for now it's time to come into the place of trying amen before jesus had this big display of power here is to overcome the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life in privacy it has some ministers you know just walk with us jesus led by the spirit solo individual into the wilderness his wilderness individual to overcome the devil so when jesus overcome the devil what do you do with men do you take her attila it i go and do my father's work and always men become small in your eyes when you already lick up the devil himself [Applause] no man intimidates you after your encounter with lucifer flesh and blood is like not so jesus having overcome the devil no signs no wonder that it's written it is written i mean which other quote scripture it is also written so in other words he just give him it's written right through i ain't doing nothing for you tony stone the bread no if don't be do this do this no i ain't doing nothing for you just look at these scriptures you'll find about me look the scriptures is written is written he's proven we could stand with the word we can tell that it is written we don't have to prove nothing we have to bring no proof on evidence [Applause] like a brother tell me you have a point to prove see all right prove it point next bird tell me your head you're here yeah ahead of us you're gonna hear the voice i said brother i'm trying hard as i can i'll catch up on one day i'm behind i'm behind i'm i'm trying as fast as i can and these just small talking you know i'm a head i'm on top i'm above i have more revelation i have his mysteries hidden mysteries missions that goddamn reveal from the bottomless pit all kind of mystery being loosed have no foundation whatsoever and people are itching like two children in a park in some games there's some swinging toys no manifestation no fruit no no vote you no power nothing at all just talk but the rains are coming the storms are coming not t.o coming i ain't going to try no man work i am not the trier god coming to try what i'm doing god trying every man's work we're not escaping you know every man's work i remember you said tell the church a long time to ask god for revelation to fellowship here because when childhood and testing come here you know why you're here so must come into that place of trying now first peter 3 2 7 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to the abundant mercy had begotten us and a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead i love this to an inheritance incorruptible on defile feed another way reserve in heaven from you give me the whole hug the whole story it's reserved it's uncomfortable it's there for you amen isn't that right to inheritance and corruptable undefiled feeling with reasonably who are kept by the power of god true faith on the salvation ready to reveal the last time wherein you greatly rejoice don't know for season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that here we go the trial of your faith being more precious than gold that parachute don't be tried with fire might be found unto praise and unknown glory at the point of jesus christ so god doesn't want a product that is untried his products are tried his sons are tried his daughters are tried isn't that right but when god finished with him it's approved that's why balram says what we need is thousands of lived voices that's the thunder that shakes it lived already it overcome in polish and martinez in colombia it lived already god won the qualified voices alive that's the thunder that shakes not letter quote the quote is not going to shake the devil hallelujah let's talk about another brother isaiah he was leaning upon king yuzan king josiah died because he thought because he's a king he could play priests and the king went and tried to do the priest work and got judged leprosy struck him right there and he died that shook up is i run into the temple now and god began to show him something he said i saw stood seraphim's he saw the lord high and lifted up train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twenty covered his face between covered his feet which we needed fly and one cried as another said holy holy lord god almighty the lord is the lord of hosts the whole is full of thy glory and the post of the door was moved by the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said i woe is me i'm undone because i'm a man of unclean lips but this is important because he's a prophet he speaks a god but then in this presence there's a behavior that came upon his life there's an effect it had upon him a vision broke upon him and transforming totally and completely and then he says now watch who is me from undone uh lips and i dwell in the midst of a people and clinics for my eyes i've seen the king the lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a life coal in his hand which had taken with the tongue some of the altar wow laid it upon my mouth and said lo this had touched my lips the iniquity is taken away thy sin purge i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send who will go for us then i hear my send me amen and this is brother branham he said the prophet had been leaning upon the kingdom and when he found out that something taken place no matter how much a man has been blessed yet when god when he steps across that boundary line between error and truth god calls his hand then isaiah went to the temple fell along at his knees no doubt yes he said he fell down to the temple at the ultimate in the crowd and as he cried god came in a vision and he saw the angels he said i saw god lifted up god was lifted to a place that man cannot come then he become influenced in another way he saw god lifted up high way up his train he looked and the pillars began to move begin to shake at the voice he never saw that isaiah he saw what a mortal man can feel oh here what isaiah saw he saw that a mortal man can fail fall no matter how much he is blessed and that is why it's a shame for ministers to deceive the people by putting everything upon the people about them that it's got to be them that's a shame amen because a man because of blessings can fall ten percent you don't believe that but that is what i just said i didn't say the prophet said it let me read it again in case you really understand what i say he saw that mortal man can fall no matter how much he is blessed he can still fall one so then he get a look at one that can't fall whose foundations are sure the vision of the temple saw god lifted up god being lifted up isn't that right he said now watch isaiah seen that the king as soon as he got it out of his calling god smote him with leprosy then as i thought what must i do uzziah was dead he had lean heavy on his arm he thought he was gone what would he do life itself was gone from him nearly so what did the young prophet do he made his way down to the temple and pray he fell under the altar and he cried out sometimes god let the very props be knocked from under us sometimes he let sickness strike us he let sickness strike us he lets disappointments heartaches strike us amen you saw the immigrant lighter [Applause] weight on the devil we're talking about god he so he using the devil to accomplish his papers because he want to get something out of you sometimes you don't even know what's inside of you but he's got to get it out because he want to make you a vessel of honor he wants you to be purged and persian could only come through a process [Applause] sometimes he does that to get you where you would be influenced by the gospel be wise enough to catch it don't be stupid enough to walk away from it isaiah noted that he must find something different what did he do he went to the temple he saw god on the throne lifted the way up he saw the seraphims here we go i want to get on to this a little bit seraphim mean burners the seraphim means which is next to the altar actually the seraphims is the one who receives the sacrifice and cleanses the worshipper and then presents him to god so when you come to worship that fire presence caused some of the altar coming around you to prepare you to approach god you just come to god there must be a way made to approach god when the pillar fire came on monk sinai god tell moses to put on stakes and tell the people don't let the animal pass there it got to be killed don't cross that mark hallelujah monkey becomes holy because the holy god is on the mountain wherever god is it comes holy and you are the temple of the holy ghost [Applause] glory hallelujah you are more than just an ordinary person walking god said you are the temple you are the host they're going to keep god they're going to house god you are very important to god could we hear a shout in the house then you can look to do your own thing you got to get your life conformed to his will cleanses the worshipper then presents him to god this seraphims are angelic beings they are the very one next to god right at the altar they receive the sacrifice it shows the justice of god that sin cannot come in his presence until it's been atoned and these seven seraphims remember in the seventh church ages they guarded the gospels one on either side they were in the gardener eden with the flaming sword guarding the altar so when god tell him oak are eden and god tell the servants to protect that tree unless he called with his perverted life and have eternal life and he served him with god in the tree now they serve him trying to get you back to that tree oh my hallelujah oh glory like uziah trying to usurp the place of an anointed office because he was a big fellow among god's people they are no big fellows fivefold they're massive real big ghost people there's no big fellows we are all children of god god gave us one of us wanting to do and another thing to do so you are just as important as the minister god may have a little thing for you to do and that's very important in the kingdom of god just as important hallelujah remember jesus who and the wine ran up and they came to jesus and and he said what have you to do with that and they say whatever he said do it whatever he said do it he said take the water box and draw the water somebody had to do it somebody saw what i put whiner that was the instructions leprosy have mercy upon me he said go and show yourself to the priest have mercy upon me i said they go and say huh

[Applause] notice yes you may be seated when he confessed he was wrong then there was cleansing power who is me i'm undone if he didn't say that they called stay right there it'd make a confession it takes acknowledgement that he could say i'm undone i am a man of one clean lips he wasn't talking about nobody else that was his testimony that was his experience that was his what he was going through i have a manga when he lives yeah here come the cleansing power this is brother branham we see how god sets his servants in order humble himself get an action watch when he cleans that servant he never done it by seminary he never done it by a bunch of books he never done him a bunch of books including spoken word books no books we find out god cleanse the servants by fire somebody say fire

man's work an exact discovery of every man's work the probe of the spirit hallelujah the probe of god the sword of god to deal with every man's work so no man at the most let the fire fall oh glory hallelujah no man after boss no church of the boss just let the fire fall and fire will fall elijah said let the good that answer by fire let him be god oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise

watch it shall come to pass that he has left in zion and he that's a remnant jerusalem in jerusalem shall be called holy even everyone that is written among the living jerusalem wherein the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughter of zion remember that's always the bride oh yes did you hear that revelation the prophet bringing there the lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of zion remember that's always the bride and i have purified the blood of jerusalem that's the remnant of the jews plus the bride in the midst thereof with the spirit of judgment all god purifies with the spirit of burning with the spirit of judgment with the spirit of fire to refine us fire oh hallelujah that's for the bride oh glory to god amen listen to that prophet that's always god's judgment when he makes his final judgment he calls you justify you bring you to redemption then his judgment breaks upon you and the holy ghost and fire cleanses away the sin then you are his and the same thing he does the earth he purges it with fire by the spirit of burning he said now look are you ready and the lord will create upon every dwelling place among zion and upon assembly a cold and smoke by day and fire by night and upon all the glory shall be a defense oh close you talk about anointed you talk about commission you know with a pillow fire hanging over your life hanging over the building hanging over the church you talk about a vindicated word [Music] so therefore it has to come to genuine death that's why god put brotherly kindness right where it's supposed to be long before the fire before holy spirit god put brotherly kindness and god have present to do your hard things nasty things wrong things god is not to send them goddess in you [Applause] the bad behaviors church members the bride had to respond to that all jesus that you cannot believe us i don't know who's who i push into the believers but my point is this when the test comes it has coming to you he could test it with your husband he could test you with your wife he could test it with your own family he could just send a job [Music] so when you are right and the brother is wrong or sister iran you take wrong there's a death there's a hard thing you know you you know what are you when you when you do it when you can't tell anybody when you do tell anybody else that's a killer because you want to see how much you forgive her you want to say you don't wanna and are you telling everybody i dropped this in a while i drop it and i drop it everybody know you drop it you're getting famous by japanese same take over now do not die you come in a life in another realm of fame and popularity i was trying to boast how humble you were i still prayed [Applause] are you hearing me are there believers in the house and do you know there no prayers do it because your father who see it in secret he's seeing he's seen what you're doing the lord you pray in secret your father he's going to reward you openly [Applause] don't do like the pharisees on them they like to make their long and long speeches and everybody knows them on the floor and they're on show and you know they're doing a business ending all right praise god oh this is a quote here no get it you say we have two categories two greek words one of them is agape one is failure feed your love is earthly like friendship friendship agape love is above feel love is what you are for your wife your children that's fill you if someone insult your wife kind of love would kill him the man insulted your wife that's philip agapola will pray for his soul that is the difference many times the church get that mixed up and they try to apply for your love which means friendship to be a couple of there's a difference so outside a capstone headstone anointing coming down as promised is just for your love mixing up with everything friendship friendship plenty of friendship my friends dear so i'm going to church dear because all my friends are there but if the world is not there forget your friends because your friends along with the whole bunch of the wood amen fully comprehensively deceived but if a man of the world a man of the world you know i challenge people already you know show me where i'm off the word show me i'm off the word and then i'll come and show me what was supposed to be on i i happy i want to correct it i'll repent i'll make it right i'll correct it show me because father i'm staying with the word [Applause] amen i'm not afraid of any man i'm not afraid of any challenge as long as i stay with the world i'm fine i promise to say with the world amen so i can just keep that down there oh praise the praise the lord amen all right but i'm okay be going good time all right so i'm go with jesus but i'm talking about they would have known he understood the storm was coming all right he knew what happened it was only a test of their fate he knew this almost coming that's good i thought that was a good one jesus knew the storm was coming he wouldn't have a strong sleep leaving them to see what the food will do and they're singing the special student god is so good god is so good to me but then when that's at a rockstar and they recognize watermelon and flower let me go with jesus yes no somebody could have speak to this storm somebody could say let strong all back and have you try something the only thing they tried to wake him up jesus said speak to yourself they'll know he understood the storm was coming and it will happen it only gives them a test of fate and maybe these troubles is only done maybe the revival has let up to see what we will do about it maybe maybe sickness struck you discourse not not know what was nobody's sin but that god works of god might be made known how do we know these things happen nothing happens just commonly not without god knowing that he knows it and all these things happen because it's a test of feet and peter said think it not strange when the trials come upon you fiery trials is better to you than gold is done to prove you that's the refiner fire that come out a hundred percent all the just melted out all the unbelief and experience then you know what the contibus children could testify that they went through fire isn't that right he said did you see them oh they mold a bell some famous bell to shine he said you see it's ringing a chime it takes a certain range for each bell and it takes it materials to go in there to make a certain ring isn't that right god is our great coppola he is the great refiners furnace he is the great refiners furnace and that is where he has to put these things upon us and trials and persecutions and things to mold it together to make our testimony ring for a certain time the bell is consistent in material ping pong ping pong all the material to get it ring a certain way and for your life to ring a certain way he has to put upon us [Applause] come on now i want to hear the mature people say you know i want to hear the men in here say amen i want to hear the babies and also amen because you're coming up to be men same in everybody oh glory to god so watch you put trials and positions on things to mold us together to make our testimony ring for a certain time and a certain note that he wants to run out in a certain day we are made different we are all made different we see different but we all see one thing that is jesus christ so because we are made different god have customized trials so you can want to be like sister that you can handle what sister that going through you know that was customized for sister so and so you can say i want to be blessed like that sister do you want the trials that sister have come on same as somebody i want that blessing that brother have yes but could you go that you could you drink the cup he drank come on now preach back to me somebody come on now don't just watch the blessings oh watch the process out in the house don't just watch the blessings watch the process [Music] i know your fate no he does not stay as he did the other church you hold my feet he's not talking about his feet now he is commending them for their faithfulness he also mentioned their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness the trying of your faith work at patience there's absolutely there you go no other way in which to get patience it has to come by the trial of our faith romans 5 3 tribulation look at patience tribulation is work distinct i only hear one amen and um oh glory hallelujah oh glory um oh yes oh glory are you with me do you love the word do you love jesus do you love this message [Applause] all right how highly god regardless of working of our patients is seamen james 1 4 let patients have a perfect work that you may be perfect an entire lack in nothing god's will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on god and waiting for god this is the process of character development oh praise the name of the lord notice when the fiery trial come on and every man that will witness for god will have to go through fiery trials isn't it strange how god leads his people very strange as soon as jesus was baptized he went to the wilderness to be termed the devil as soon as israel came out under the blood and circumcised by the holy spirit leading them from a light in the red sea corner of mountain pharaoh keep coming and mercy cutting them off it's all done to test your fate jesus all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution no exception god has no exceptions in that i'll read it again i read it again all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution no exception god has no exception in that all peoples must have their child training and the pastor got her child traded for you you have to have your own child training and your child is customized for you because god knows your walk and god know your talk oh glory to god so look when look when it look like everything has gone wrong god is giving you a child you want to kill yourself you want to bung yourself in the head because you make such a out but god set it up to give you a trial that song is a weak boy it's not the devil giving you that no i hear right on that one amen right right and amen all are going together as long as you respond to it it's not the devil giving you a trial god is allowing situations around you you could handle it you could handle it you could handle it [Applause] so fed up should never come out of your mouth i can't take them i can't take them but what you want to take this is the word i hear mercy lord that's a good one it's time to break for mercy on that one you can't be fed up cause i can't take it no more two boys went to the fiery furnace and they were in your testimony do you make on his age this is so tough and everything else give me a testimony i can't stand it you want to go back there god give me the gift to handle it listen if i have to go down i go no fighting you know i ain't just going down no no i ain't going down like that i went fighting just fighting for my life fighting to overcome i want to drop my foot on the devil's neck yeah yeah yeah possess the case of the enemy i'm a royal seat of abraham i am one of them i'm identified with david with samsung with just i but the heroes of faith i'm identifying with hebrews 11. may be seated what about a woman a baby dropped dead 12 years old the boy get dropped dead she showed him in a chariot on saturday right actually riding and the first gossip and confusion sister see you're riding so hard see all is well she belong as well so here it is all his will there's a reason why she riding so fast she have a dead son into back there she don't want you to know what's going on she's going to elijah elijah is a man of god elijah's god conduit at that all hallelujah child was raised from the dead and god going to ask some men of god men going to be villain god men will become the temple of the living god but we want to identify a little process for you to become a vessel of honor if any man purge himself there's a persian there's a cleansing there's a purifying there's a refining that has to come prophet call it honing honing oh glory to god hallelujah then we're going deeper now to become temples of the living god god was veiled in peter and that's what our nasty sapphire did not understand they thought that was the same brother peter that was the same house but that was a different man fire was upon that throne god was on top of that throne listen my god hallelujah and the prophecy will repeat again let me go further now okay my very final fire unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift that's why blessings have become cursed i think somebody uh england did i think some girls should win the lotto age 17 and she want to sue them and say they shouldn't allow anybody to win it on age 17 because um her life has been messed up by all this money it was too much of money and she did all this to herself she buy house this now she's broke she messed up she have no life she's frustrated she said she never should have wanted to begin with she's suing them they don't know how to make it it hit them and they blow it character is a victory not a gift and character is simply never made without suffering so all of you who don't want suffering and don't want to pain and you you know what i mean you spoil your children you spoil your wife you spoil your husband you spoil everybody you could spoil all i could tell you is a good happiness bulgerian so you do the spoiling but when god has agreed with you he not spoiling you he will go through the process like noah like moses like abraham he never spoiled none of them he straight them out he correct them jacob every one of them you know their sons too but all of them came to the grinder and they came out right don't give up on anybody don't write anybody off when that vessel was mad in the potter's hand he repurposed it he reset it he re-channeled it he cannot throw it away he cannot dump it but he choose to hold you glory give him praise inside of here character is a victory not a gift a man without character cannot reign because power apart from karate satanic but power character is fit to rule and since he wants to share his throne on the same basis he overcame and sit down at his father's throne then we have to overcome the sith with him and the little temporary suffering we go to now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes what treasures is later for those who are willing to enter in his kingdom into his kingdom with much tribulation oh give him a shout out hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah take it that strange concern the fairy trials that is a trial what god wants us to develop is a christ-like character that comes through suffering amen you say we all have trials we have all have tried and chastened us sons but not one goes through that the church that is not suffering is not being tried the church that is not suffering and is not being tried isn't of god [Music] i think i've seen it again the church that is not suffering and is not being tried isn't of god for whom the lord love it hebrews 12 6. he chastened it and scorched at every son who he receive it and if you're with ultrasonic aware of all the particulars then you are bastards are not sons there is no special condition in smyrna this special conditions mana must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no true believer free from it this is of god this is the will of god it is needful we need the lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ like in doing it when you're on the phone gossiping and telling people about where you're going through and where you're going try where you went to that is not suffering like christ [Applause] that is you looking for sympathizers in your pot of worry i said people's drink to have a bunch of friends who do you same thing too all i'm talking he said we'll talk no you don't want that amen so watch this is the will of god is needful we need the lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and the christ that can do in it love suffered long and is kind the cloudy skies and storms of life and no signs of god's disapproval because things are wrong and things didn't work out like god fixed at you and you feel that we you and you didn't repent and repent and repent and repent like if you try to work god up god forgive me lord you want to repent things that you didn't even do you said a script back up things in the past in case god they forgive you at them too and keep going back because you think god angry at you and trying to appease this angry god but he's teaching us something here the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god disapproval neither are the bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us are you ready is in the beloved his love is elective which he has for us before the foundation of the world how does he love us yes how shall we know because he said so and manifest that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placed in us as sons how can i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allow to come to pass amen that's 30 how do we show that we love him how do we prove his love for him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials he in his wisdom allowed to come to pass oh glory to god hallelujah praise god i'm going to skip down these things here oh my god last time i preached here i talked about the potter's house the word that came to jeremiah go down to the potter's house and i will show cause you to hear my words i went on to the potter's house and behold he wrote a work on the wheels and the vessel that he made the clay was mad in the hand of the potter so he made it again another vessel and it seemed good to the party to make it then the wilderness came to me saying o house of israel kind of i do with with you as this spotter says the lord behold as the clay is in the potter's hands show you in my hand i want you to notice who is in charge the potter is i want to notice his interaction is connecting with the clay itself he's not leaving the clay on his own he is molding it he is shaping it he's feeling it there's any stones in it to take it out oh yes oh yes he's channeling it for a vessel of use a vessel of honor a blessing that he can use because you have to make the vessel that he can use a vessel of honor that god can use oh hallelujah that was the potter that was a claim no devil in there it's the potter and the clay and the shaping there was no lucifer [Applause] why are you oppressing me so yeah because you want to shape your soul then the devil this is the potter and the clay i want to read another scripture listen john 15. i'm divine true man my father is a husband man every branch of media bear not fruity take it away amen cut it off now watch what here where the problem start if you call it problem to you see that's problem every burst that buried fruit he purchased it so he's not interested in non-fruit branch he's interested in brands of producing fruit and once he's a fruit he's a purge now you may take fruit fruit fruit the object behind that more fruit again no devil there you're clinging to the word i've spoken to you abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot be a fruit of itself accepted abiding in the vine no more can you accept your body than me i am the vine you are the branches he's a divider than me and him the same bringing forth much fruit for without me you could do nothing if a man about not in me is cast out as a branch is withered men gather them cast them into the fire they are burned if you abide in me my words are bad in you you shall ask what you will shall be done unto you here is my father glorified that he shall bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples again there's no devil there if you abandon me my words are in you ask what you will so you in charge to ask whatever you will because you abide in him you are arrested in him you understand a revelation that you are a branch of god connected to the vine and the life of the blind is throwing through you producing the fruit that god needs which isn't the fruit that god wants so you become a channel of god i am of god a vessel of god a tool of god use of god devil is all the picture you're coming into god's wisdom now you're coming to god's maturity now you're coming at a different level altogether where your whole work becomes god inspired god directed amen who may abide in the day of his coming who shall stand when he appeared for he's like a refiner's fire and like a full of soap and a standard full of soap is some kind of lie some kind of soap that made and didn't clean and clot to make cloth clean and the way it is done they have to walk on it and sprinkle it and whatnot they can't leave it and walk away they have to stick with it so just as the vines connect with the branch just as the potter is connected with the clay the fuller soap cleaning the cloth you have to connect with the soap connect with the cloth and scrub that cloth and wash that cloth you can't leave it it'll spoil it you have to stick with it to work with it you're not moving away from it that's the fullest but tonight we want to talk about the refiner's fire he shall sit as a refiner who shall abandon day of his coming who shall stand when he appeared for he is like a refiners fire like a fuller soul he shall sit as a refiner and purify of silver he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the lord and offering in righteousness and this is a story there was a group of women in bible study on the book of malachi as they were studying chapter 3 they came across these verse 3 that he would sit as a refiner and purifier of silver this verse positive woman and they wondered what the statement meant about the character nature of god one of the women offered to find out the process of refining silver and get back to the group at the next bible study that week this woman called up a silver smith and make an appointment to watch him at work she didn't mention anything about the reason for her interest beyond her curiosity about the process of refining silver as she washed the silversmith he held a piece of silver over the fire and let it heat up he explained that in refined silver one needed to hold the silver in the middle of the fire where the flames are the hottest has to burn away all the impurities the woman thought about god holding us in such a hot spot then she thought again about the verse he sits as a refiner and purifier of silver she asked the silversmith if it was true and he had to sit there in front the fire the whole time the silver is being refined the mana instead and said yes he not only had to sit there holding the silver we had to keep his eyes on the silver the entire time it was in the fire if the silver was left a moment too long in the flames it would be destroyed he shall sit as a refiner of silver he sits so when you think god is silent he's still watching he sits through your pain he's still looking he know how much you could bear no temptation has given humanity cannot bear you make a wave of escape he sits watching knowing he could give you a word all things work together for good to them that love got to them what he called he sits while the fire is upon your life he's not absent he can't leave you on your own he has to keep looking at you because he has to bring you through tell the devil he's a liar because he sits at the purifier oh glory hallelujah glory to god do you see it now the connection between what god going to what you're going through as a process of what the lord himself has to do you know how much you could take that's why you almost gave up you almost didn't make it you thought about giving in you thought about committing suicide you thought you were finished altogether and you're still around you're still holding on because he kept you and he held you he hasn't given up on you he's still working on you he's sitting watching you oh praise god he's gonna prove his love to you oh glory to god he said you're engraving a power my hands how can i forget israel how could god really forget you he brought you out to laodicea he mined he dug you off from being wretched miserable naked blind of the baptist and methodist and pentecostal all kind of religions he'd take you out
