Are you happy to be in the house? One more time. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? [Music] [Applause] Amen. Before you take your seats, in fact, you can have your seats. It is incredible that we have come to the final service. &gt;&gt; And God has been good. &gt;&gt; Has he been good? &gt;&gt; And to think, you know, a brother said to me, "It's not even over yet." And to think that God still has more in store for us tonight. &gt;&gt; How good our God is. &gt;&gt; You appreciate the convention. We appreciate the singing, the worship, the ministry of the word. There's no convention without you. So, we really appreciate you for making the convention the convention. Hallelujah. You may be seated. I have two notes of praises. One from Sister Elizabeth Pinkra. I thank the Lord for his goodness. My nephew has been moved from the ICU to a regular ward. [Music] She said, I see a cloud like a man's hand. Thank you, church, for your prayers. You know, brother said, once you see one sign, that's enough. We we just need to see one sign to know that it's already taken place. So, we thank the Lord. And from uh Bodan Olofin, I want to thank God for the great deliverance he bestowed to me today during the altar call after brother Olu's message. Now I can say that sin will not have dominion over me anymore forever. And I believe many can give testimony. Many can give witness of the service this morning. The service is yesterday. The service is on Friday. And God is still in the deliverance business. He is still breaking chains. He is still setting free. And I believe if you came tonight, God is not going to disappoint. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; So certainly we want to acknowledge uh some of the ministers that are here one more time. Brother Andrew Fong, we thank you so much for being here tonight. God bless you and to be here with your wife, Sister Green. So good to see you. God bless you. Our precious brother Green will be greeting us tonight. my friend, my brother, Brother Norris. So good to see you here with us again tonight. Brother Harry, so good to see you. And all the wonderful faces of the portion of the bride that's here that knows that we are the final voice at the final age. &gt;&gt; You know, brother said, when we get over there, there'll be some people over there who you didn't think would make it, &gt;&gt; but they're going to be there &gt;&gt; because their names are on the book. It might look like they're in trouble now, but they are going to be there. So it's so good to be among believers of like precious paper. We could shout, we could jump, we could rejoice, we could cry, we could sing. And it is my honor tonight or how many appreciate our precious brother Olu for the message this morning. What a word, what a message, and what a move of the spirit that followed the service that brought deliverance, great deliverance to the people of God. [Music] Amen. great deliverance to the people of God. And uh tonight we have our precious brother Raymond Thompson from South Africa who will minister the word of God to us. But before he comes uh we have a greeting from our precious brother Albert Green. How many you appreciate brother Green, a real soldier in the army of the Lord. We salute our brother Green. me such an inspiration. You know, as as one of the younger one of the younger preachers, it's important for us to have ministers we could look up to and who could inspire us who run the road of the course and could find the middle of the road, &gt;&gt; you know, and and it's such a blessing to see what God is doing. But I really want to salute brother Green because he walks the middle of the road &gt;&gt; and he is focused on the resurrection. He's focused on the rapture. He's focused on where the bride needs to be. So, Brother Green, we salute you. We love you. We appreciate you. So, as brother Green comes to greet the people, let's just sing that song. All over the world, the spirit is moving. &gt;&gt; All over the world, the spirit is moving. All over the world, as the prophet [Music] All over. [Music] All over. [Music] All over. [Music] Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just want to read one verse of script here and we could have our seat. And he gives some apostles &gt;&gt; and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers. &gt;&gt; May the Lord God bless his precious words to our heart. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I think this evening all of us &gt;&gt; would want to give honor and appreciation to this church for these wonderful services. [Applause] [Music] Dear pastor, his wife, your officers, brother Isaac, all your efforts, all of us without a doubt leaving with a testimony that we enjoy these services. [Applause] Knowing a little about services, I could imagine the kind they have here. They are real tired. They are real worn out and they need two Mondays after the Sunday, you know. So, we appreciate them. But you know what will make their labor and give a joy &gt;&gt; to them? &gt;&gt; All the expenses and all it takes to put up this what will give a joy not only to them but to almighty God &gt;&gt; that these services draw us closer to him. &gt;&gt; That someone was delivered. someone because the truth be told &gt;&gt; we ought not to come here and don't leave better. &gt;&gt; Should should I be vernacular? You should leave better better. &gt;&gt; All these services you get, all these blessings you receive, you know what it should have done for us by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe most of us because technology will have it. I was here for this is my third time being here but technology will have it that we had an opportunity to take part in all the services &gt;&gt; you know so we were able to you know receive the blessings of being here. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if I should share, you wonder why I read that scripture, but if I should share a little thought with you, the reason why you get all these blessings is Ephesians 4:11. &gt;&gt; Thank you, sir. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:11 &gt;&gt; is the reason why &gt;&gt; you had we get it from God, &gt;&gt; but he used &gt;&gt; we got it from God. But God had to use a vessel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he, &gt;&gt; not common age, &gt;&gt; but really H, capital H. &gt;&gt; He, almighty God, &gt;&gt; he give. So Ephesians 4:11 identify to us predestinated offices. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:11 identify to us predestinated gifts. &gt;&gt; It identify to us God called gifts. &gt;&gt; God forain gifts. &gt;&gt; Elected offices of God, &gt;&gt; divine gifts that God give us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that if God didn't give you, if God didn't give us it, we cannot get the trouble. I hope you don't mind &gt;&gt; if you didn't get it. If God ain't give away it, we cannot get the real blessing. &gt;&gt; But we believe God give us &gt;&gt; and we thank God for the gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message blind battas, God's prophet tells us and God set in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First what? Missionaries, apostles. And missionary as I told you taught the same thing. Apostles, prophet, evangelists, pastors, God set in the church. &gt;&gt; God set them for the perfecting of the church. &gt;&gt; So the church cannot be perfected. &gt;&gt; The church cannot be perfected &gt;&gt; outside these gifts. That's divine gifts of God &gt;&gt; for ordained and set into the church &gt;&gt; for the perfecting of the church. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; God's prophet tells us that Jesus speaks through the pastor. &gt;&gt; Jesus speaks through his teacher. &gt;&gt; He speaks through his seer, his prophet. &gt;&gt; He speaks through his missionary. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's his gift &gt;&gt; and he put it in the church. &gt;&gt; So, we want to thank God we could identify over the the the few days of services, this being the seventh service, we want to thank God that we could identify with a ministry of perfection. &gt;&gt; A ministry that God had set. &gt;&gt; There's no evidence that God take them out. Amen. &gt;&gt; No, there's no evidence that God take them out. &gt;&gt; God put them there. &gt;&gt; This is a work of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Is Almighty God that set them there &gt;&gt; and Almighty God set us for a purpose. &gt;&gt; The perfecting of the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. That has nothing to do with a man. &gt;&gt; No man put you there. &gt;&gt; Woo. No man put you there. &gt;&gt; You might say I vote for him. &gt;&gt; Don't fool yourself with that vote. &gt;&gt; God first put them there. &gt;&gt; That is why you could recognize them. &gt;&gt; It is who God put there. &gt;&gt; Amen. We as pastors, we could put deacons and trustees. &gt;&gt; That's all we could do. &gt;&gt; Bring in deacons and trustees. But God puts the fivefold. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Not to take much of your time. In Acts chapter 1:21, you remember when Judas passed away, &gt;&gt; Judas give up. Amen. The disciples, those real top of the line men, &gt;&gt; those top the best of the best, &gt;&gt; they had the keys. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they had the first time they going to use the key. Yes. &gt;&gt; And they end up with Matias &gt;&gt; that you never heard of after that. &gt;&gt; But God had &gt;&gt; God had one known as all who was Paul. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God had a highteer Jew. You may not like &gt;&gt; You may not like &gt;&gt; the five-fold, &gt;&gt; but you don't have to like them. &gt;&gt; It is God that choose them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is God that choose them. &gt;&gt; And if God choose them, you better respect them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you respect them, God will bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] And other than respect them, &gt;&gt; don't have favorites. &gt;&gt; If God send you, we are all the same. &gt;&gt; One brother will be more blessed in a different way. Another boy blessed in a different way. But they all come from God. &gt;&gt; So have no favorites. Don't set your eye on any man. &gt;&gt; Are we all right? Are we all right? &gt;&gt; So we thank God tonight that we could have recognized over the past days. &gt;&gt; Amen. Men that God put. &gt;&gt; And if God put them, they are qualified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If God put them, if God put them, they're going to be a hindrance. &gt;&gt; I said if God didn't put you, you're going to be a hindrance. &gt;&gt; If God put you, you're going to be an obstacle. If God put you, you going to interfere. You're going to make these brothers life hard. &gt;&gt; Thus said the prophet. &gt;&gt; If God put you, you'll be an obstacle to a real preacher's way. &gt;&gt; But we thank God for God men. &gt;&gt; God give them the gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. Predestinated offices. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody a lay hand on them. &gt;&gt; Nobody. You can't pray for that gift. You can't feel for the gift. &gt;&gt; You can't desire for the gift. &gt;&gt; No, it's God placed them there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We talking about something that is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Something that you cannot pray for. &gt;&gt; You cannot wish for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You cannot desire it. &gt;&gt; It comes from almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You could do nothing about it. &gt;&gt; You cannot walk yourself into it. Hallelujah. It's like saying some of these brothers here, they are born musician. &gt;&gt; If they're not born musician, school ain't going to help them. School will only help them if they have something in them. &gt;&gt; I could tell you that, right? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You cannot push something in somebody &gt;&gt; if that thing is not there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So we praise God. When you're thanking God for these services and you appreciate this, you're going to recognize it is a blessing from Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The sovereign God has blessed you. &gt;&gt; The sovereign God has blessed you with these gifts. the sovereign God who could do what he want. You can't tell God who to choose. &gt;&gt; You cannot choose for God you're out of place. &gt;&gt; You have to accept to be blessed. You have to accept what God has given. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I I believe we all could recall. Amen. God's prophet came from a family. Catholics on both side &gt;&gt; as a sinner man. The gift was in him. &gt;&gt; As a sinner man, he seeing visions. &gt;&gt; God's prophet tells us, he say, "I see visions just like how you drink water." &gt;&gt; As a sinner, &gt;&gt; the gift is from the sovereign God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Gifts and calling the scripture tells us &gt;&gt; are without repentance. &gt;&gt; Repentance does not bring gifts. gifts are predestinated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Last night we really enjoyed Amen. Brother Isaac. Amen. And I seek permission to take hold of those thoughts and share it with our young people. So we thank God for the gift. &gt;&gt; A amen. &gt;&gt; Now God's prophet tells us the gift the gift cannot leave you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You remember the same night &gt;&gt; Samson slept with a harot. &gt;&gt; It's the same next morning he pick up the gate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God would not take away the gift. But &gt;&gt; if I use it wrong, &gt;&gt; if you use it wrong, God will deal with me. &gt;&gt; God will deal with you &gt;&gt; for using it wrong. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we want to thank God that we could identify with predestinated offices, &gt;&gt; predestinated gifts of God to bring the church together. &gt;&gt; They are they have a purpose. They have a job description. Their job description is to bring the people together for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; That is their purpose. Go and go veet for them for doing the work. &gt;&gt; You better pray for them and thank God for them. Their job is to put you in order. &gt;&gt; Their job is to put me in order. Their job is to lift you up for the they working for the self. I said they are not working for themselves. &gt;&gt; What they are doing is for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And we know anything you doing for the glory of God will fall down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we thank God you do for the glory of God is going to last. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; So let me take two or three minutes and just close off. I just want to show taking from the message putting on the whole armor of God. Paragraph 76. &gt;&gt; God fortified his army &gt;&gt; with what? &gt;&gt; Himself &gt;&gt; in the form of prophets, &gt;&gt; apostles, &gt;&gt; teachers and pastors. &gt;&gt; God fortified his army with himself. &gt;&gt; Himself is in the form of your pastor. Hallelujah. What did he do? What was God doing? Listen. Did you ever think of that? Teachers, pastors, what did he do? What was God doing? Listen. Amen. The officers of the church. It's God's dress. Where? &gt;&gt; Inside dress. An apostle, a prophet, a seer. Amen. Foresee before Satan ever get it done. What is it? Is God dressed up in his church? &gt;&gt; Who these officers are? God dressed up in his church &gt;&gt; is God's dress wear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you see these offices, pastors, teachers, what is that? That's God's dressear. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, I love this piece. &gt;&gt; God's prophet put a disclaimer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We always hear about buy something have a disclaimer. &gt;&gt; I hear the disclaimer now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is that? That is God's dress wear is God's presence working through man. And if that office &gt;&gt; deny any of this word, &gt;&gt; it is not God's dressing. &gt;&gt; So God tell you, the word tell you how to recognize what is God's dress. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the disclaimer. If we do anything or we preach or believe in anything contrary to the word, it is not God's dressing. &gt;&gt; No, that's a wolf in sheep clothing. &gt;&gt; Watch that fella. &gt;&gt; So in the same way tonight to temper off. In the same way tonight, Amen. God have a fivefold, the devil also have one. Now I got to tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; No, we must not give half truth. &gt;&gt; We we we are called to give the full counsel of God. &gt;&gt; The devil have a five-fold &gt;&gt; and the apostle Paul identified it in 2 Corinthians 11:13. For such are false apostles, &gt;&gt; deceitful workers, &gt;&gt; transforming themselves into apostles of Christ, &gt;&gt; and no marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. &gt;&gt; Therefore, it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their work. &gt;&gt; So the devil have a five-fold Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The devil have make believe preachers, &gt;&gt; make believe prophets &gt;&gt; and we know it in 2 Chronicles about the lion spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, there's a lying spirit. That's how to deceive. How to deceive Ahab. Get into them lying spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. A lying spirit into preachers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So if it is not the word, don't believe it. &gt;&gt; That's the disclaimer. &gt;&gt; Turn on the light. And a man who can turn on the light, you can go and read it. God's prophet express it very simply. &gt;&gt; He said no Lutheran &gt;&gt; could deceive a Methodist. &gt;&gt; Okay. a Lutheran Methodist came out from them, &gt;&gt; right? No method, no no Methodist, Amen, could deceive a Lutheran, right? No, a Pentecostal cannot a Methodist cannot deceive a Pentecostal &gt;&gt; because you didn't get it. &gt;&gt; And the bride dig out Pentecostal eye. The point I'm making tonight, the five-fold of the enemy is in the midst of those who believe what we believe. &gt;&gt; If you could stomach it, &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; It is in our realms. &gt;&gt; There is where it coming from somewhere else. it coming right from our realms. &gt;&gt; And just let me said one more thing before I sit and you lay members don't think we only talking about the preacher. &gt;&gt; God don't forget you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; God's prophet tells us that God set the lay member. &gt;&gt; God you have a you have a purpose. &gt;&gt; You have a ministry. &gt;&gt; In present stage of my ministry, he said, "Amen. God will crown your ministry. &gt;&gt; Maybe a housewife. &gt;&gt; Are we in church? &gt;&gt; Are we in church? &gt;&gt; Are we in church? &gt;&gt; Maybe. Amen. A layman. &gt;&gt; Maybe a farmer. &gt;&gt; God will crown your life for his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we cannot have a church without you. &gt;&gt; My prophet tells us without you there's no me. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we thank God for the lady. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if God wanted to be a lay member, I'll be a better lay member than a preacher. &gt;&gt; If God &gt;&gt; wanted me to be a lay member, I would be better off a lay member than would be a preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if God ain't call us, we will never make it. &gt;&gt; Outside the call of God, &gt;&gt; we'll do nothing but mess it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But stay in line with God's word, &gt;&gt; whether we be minister or lay people, &gt;&gt; because a little housewife is much in the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; as an apostle. God positionally placed you here in his body to be a housewife, &gt;&gt; to be a farmer. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be a preacher. &gt;&gt; In God's secret economy, he placed you in his body. God bless you as we continue to enjoy the word. Great things he has done amongst us. God bless you. We appreciate brother Green. Wonderful brother, sister. We can do better than that. Amen.

You believe the power is moving like a magnet. &gt;&gt; So, so the magnet is drawing power. &gt;&gt; So, if he draws on you and someone next to you is not moving, just move a bit closer &gt;&gt; and magnetize that person.

Thank you, brother Theo, once again in the Headstone Tabernacle. What a convention. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? What a blessing. What an honor to be here. I was sitting there and I thought, uh, Brother Theo, brother Isaac Hone, I thought, man, God made history this weekend. &gt;&gt; And you know, brother men speaks of what's the traction on the mountain &gt;&gt; and I was saying, what's the attraction here &gt;&gt; in Headstone Tabernacle? Amen. &gt;&gt; What was God doing? Making history. &gt;&gt; And you will go back never the same again. &gt;&gt; All of us. Our brother Green says you come to church, you'll never go back the same. Brother says you go out worse or you go out better. &gt;&gt; So thank you, brother Theo. A tabernacle, uh, brother Thompson, the food was so good, the music was good, the singing was good, the preaching was good, uh, the atmosphere is good, everything is good. So, we want to say thank you. Thank you for all the specials. And what can we say about Brother Isaac's message? My God salute you. What a masterpiece. What a blessing. Uh so that was really beautiful. Brother Isaac uh keep going. God has anointed you. And like brother Green says, you know, brother says, you're born with that gift. &gt;&gt; No man can make you a pastor or a preacher. He says he told Jeremiah before you even formed in your mother's womb, I ordained you a prophet. You know, so God ordained you with that gift, brother Theo too. Thank you. So everyone uh that has been part of this, I want to say thank you, brother Olo. What a message this morning. Wow. We salute you. Was brought so beautiful. Uh that's a very deep thought, but he made it so simple. We all could understand it. Even the young ones could understand. And we salute you, brother. And God richly bless you. And uh he always tease. He says when he grows up, he want to be like me. And I'm trying to catch him up. So thank you. And brother Theo, this was really outstanding convention. Outstanding. I was blessed. And uh as our brother Green says, without the people there's no convention. So let's give yourself a hand for coming to this meeting. Amen. So if I forgot anyone, the musicians, the chorus lead, everyone thank you and thank you for the invite. It was so great to come all these miles. Now when you say you're going to Trinidad, you must have pluck. I don't know if you understand that word. You must have cuts because it's so far you travel for hours. But I tell you, every moment was worth it to be here in the presence of almighty God. So, thank you. God bless you. I'm not going to be long tonight. It's a prayer line. So, if we just uh bow our heads for a short word of uh and brother Theo, I like to salute your wife always. You know, we always forget the wife. Sister Emory, she here or she here. But thanks, Sister Emory and uh for the Isaac Wives of Tama. We really want to bless you and it's it's it's behind the scenes. You always find they do the most of the work and the planning. So, thank you, heavenly father. We thank you again gather this night as we come away from the hustle and bustle, the cares of this life. We see the world falling apart, Lord. We see the handwriting on the wall. We see the signs of you're coming all around us. But Lord, the Bible told us when these things happen, lift up your head. Look up for your redemption is drawing high. We're so thankful our souls is saved, Lord. But we're waiting for the redemption of our bodies, Father. And Lord, that's soon to happen and soon to appear, Lord. So give us grace. This is the last service. We welcome your presence. And someone didn't receive their blessing. May they receive it tonight. Lord, give us anction to speak. And I always say, Lord, this message is anointed. So is your word anointed. We need that anointing to come upon us. Bless the preaching of the word. Heal the sick tonight. That's what we've come for with faith in our hearts that no demon will stand before the presence of God. And every demon, Lord, power will be bound tonight. So may the people that just rise up with faith tonight, Lord, to take a hold of your promise. And we come to the end of the service. We won't forget to give you the honor, the praise, and the glory. &gt;&gt; For we ask it in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, I'll say &gt;&gt; the church shall say &gt;&gt; amen. So, it's the last night. Uh I always say this, but Jesus on the last day of the feast. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh and if you didn't receive your portion yet, it's not over. Amen. &gt;&gt; And on the last day, he said, &gt;&gt; if any man thirst, &gt;&gt; let him come unto me &gt;&gt; and drink of the waters of life. So I'm saying tonight, if you're still thirsty, &gt;&gt; there's still one more opportunity for you &gt;&gt; to break through tonight and say, Lord, I want that power of God in my life. &gt;&gt; So if you have your Bibles, very short scriptures, Acts 1:8, Romans 8:18, and Philippians 1:2. Excuse me. Now it's very familiar scripture. Acts 18. But he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. &gt;&gt; Even Trinidad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 8 and we'll read verse 18. For I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. &gt;&gt; So the glory is being revealed in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then Philippians 1 and verse 20. According to my expect earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, &gt;&gt; whether it be life or by death. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; So we're not tired. Eh, &gt;&gt; if we are tired, we tired of the devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're tired of him. &gt;&gt; And every demon has to go tonight. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I believe tonight we came with a attitude of victory tonight. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but that's how I came. &gt;&gt; Uh I always like uh I took it from Rubbranom. He says when you go into a city, he says and he climbs out of the plane. He says when he puts his foot on that ground, &gt;&gt; he claims that country &gt;&gt; and he binds every demon in that city. So when I put my foot on the ground, I bound the head demon of Trinidad. &gt;&gt; So if the the the head demon is bound, brother Goki, then all the imps, &gt;&gt; they have to go and God's people is gathered. And when God's people is gathered, the demons has got to go. &gt;&gt; And brother says, if God must open our eyes, we'll be surprised to see the angels of God walking up and down here. So tonight, as our brother Olu preached, you're not alone, brother. The angels come with a tent. Brother Graham says, and they camp around you. So tonight, you're not just here in the church, but the angels of God are walking up and down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So my title tonight, God's power is your power. &gt;&gt; Come on now. God's power is your power. My subject, God will shake the world with a pride &gt;&gt; and my inspiration. He shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you. &gt;&gt; Okay. He says you have proof of his resurrection. What is it? The last days God is going to raise up men &gt;&gt; with messages with power and deliverance. &gt;&gt; When in the last days, God is going to raise up men. And I hear our brother Green spoke of the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; They're not just put there. You can't vote them in. They are born. Bible says when they drop from the womb, they drop with that gift. &gt;&gt; And yet he says, "What is God going to do in the last days?" God is going to raise up men with messages, with power and deliverance, with power of the gospel to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Did you feel it this weekend that may God raise up men with messages of power to deliver the bride of Jesus Christ? He says you're in the second end robe. He says, "And God has never left himself on the earth without a witness." &gt;&gt; God has always had somebody &gt;&gt; someplace had a person that he could put his hands on &gt;&gt; and he would stand for a witness. &gt;&gt; So is he if he did that down since Genesis the beginning, surely somewhere God has got a man that he can lay his hands on. Now, now someone reads it and stops there and say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But go just the very next verse. He says he's he's he's more than one man now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, no man has claims that he has the authority on this message alone because God has got men now. men now he has many men that can lay his hands on because we coming down to the gathering time which is harvest time. So in the time of the harvest no man can claim this is my message. I'm the authority I can do. No my brother God has got men all over the world that he can lay his hands on. And you know what says he's going to say there's my spirit flowing freely. I found one here and I found one there and I found another one there. So, it's not one man show. In fact, man's time is over. This is a man that's got to be praised. We raising up Jesus. We coming together under the banner of Jesus. No church, no denomination, no no religion, brother, but we coming under the banner of Jesus. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says you're recognizing your day. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say something. National force put Israel in the homeland. &gt;&gt; National force will put the church in the world council of churches. &gt;&gt; But the power of God will put the people in the pride. So that's why I said I'm not interested in Rome, brother Goki, and what's happening out there, but I'm interested in the power of God that's got going to get us out of here. &gt;&gt; And I hope you're also interested because if you're not interested in the power of God, you're going to miss it. &gt;&gt; And you're going to wonder, why didn't I make it? And you're going to say, wasn't there supposed to be a rapture? And the rapture will be passed and the the wise virgin went in and here you still sitting. Brother, it's time to wake up. It's time to get desperate. It's time to seek the face of God. It's time to pray in your house. Call the altar. Get the children together. God wants to deal in your house. He wants to be the head of your home, the head of your family, the head of the church. He wants to have rulership. Hallelujah. Oh, brother. I feel the fire of God. He says here the power of God will put the people in the bride. The world forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward. Oh, I want to tell you there's an upward pull. The spirit of God which is the word of God. My word my word is spirit and life. So you can't say word word only and you can't say spirit spirit only. You get you got to gather two together. And when you get them together then there's fire brother Paul. Then the anointing falls and the power of God. And tonight I'm looking for the sick to be healed. And I want to tell you cancer is just a name. Brother B says it's a demon. High blood pressure is a demon. Sugar diabetes is a demon. And tonight we calling that demon on his name. Satan, you're a liar. God's people is going to be healed. Hallelujah. Amen. And I feel the power of God. I know the anointing here. And the anointing will break the yoke. &gt;&gt; Wow. My word is spirit and life will put the bride in a place cuz you recognize the position in the word. Then she's in Christ. Will put her in the place. No national force will do that. So many people say, "I'm waiting for the squeeze." &gt;&gt; No, it's not the squeeze going to put you in the bride. It's the power of God is going to put you in the bride. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Jesus. He says uh drive Israel to the homeland. National force and the council of churches will drive every organization by the power of God will raise the bride into glory. Aren't you helping in the bride? Come on church, you must preach back to me. You're not tired. I'm tired. But I know the Holy Ghost is here to quicken you. You know when Elijah was tired and he heard the noise, he heard the just the sound. He says goes, "Look up seven times and he seen the hand of a cloud like a man's hand." Did he sit back and say, "Wow, that's nice. &gt;&gt; That old man over there, he got up, brother." He says, "Go right to Jezel and sound the rain bells. I hear a sound of abundance of rain." Brother, I don't care how old you are. I don't care how sick you are. But tonight, I hear the sound of abundance of rain. There's a cloud and there's going to be a cloud burst and you're going to be healed. You're going to be delivered. You're going to be set free. Come on, young people. Preach back to me. Give me something, man. I need a strength. I need virtue. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. He says here &gt;&gt; contest but I want to speak for this ministers quickly upon the greatest contest &gt;&gt; there is. Now I want you to notice where he places and I said God's power is your power. &gt;&gt; So tonight I'm preaching to you as the bride &gt;&gt; and we got to find out where is God's power. &gt;&gt; How can I get this power? &gt;&gt; How do I get into this power? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he says here, I want to speak on the greatest contest there is between the church and Satan. He didn't say God, brother Isaac. &gt;&gt; Between who? &gt;&gt; The church. &gt;&gt; So you mean this battle that we have now is not between God and Satan. &gt;&gt; Because God gave his power to the church. &gt;&gt; All that was in God, he bought into Christ. &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ, he bought into into the church. So where's the power now? in the church. So his power is your power. Now why do you sit back when the power of God is here to anoint you to break through tonight? Break through every chain. Break through every demon power. Break through the sickness. Break through everything that has you bound. You can break through because the power, his power is your power. Woo. Hallelujah. Brother, listen man. You came in here not with your power. You came in here with his power. &gt;&gt; You are saved by his power. You are delivered by his power. You are healed by his power. Everything that you have is his power. Hallelujah. My my my [Applause] &gt;&gt; between the church and Satan. The great strength of Satan we want to speak of. But the great strength of God in his church. Wow. &gt;&gt; So, brother, &gt;&gt; I came here so anointed you won't believe. &gt;&gt; I'm tired and well, but I said, man, I was studying. I'm praying. I was walking up and down. &gt;&gt; And I said, man, the devil is a liar. &gt;&gt; You see, we got to call his bluff. &gt;&gt; As long as he got you cornered &gt;&gt; and you in in back there and you pull him back and oh, I don't know what I'm going to do. then he's got you whipped, man. But when you stand up and say enough is enough, Satan, you're a bluff. I'm going to be healed tonight. I'm going to be delivered. Nothing will keep me bound anymore. And I'm going free. Drugs, I'm going free. Pornography, I'm going free. Lust, I'm going free. It doesn't matter what it is. You are free tonight, brother. Why? The power that was his is yours. Woo! Hallelujah. Come on now, man. Hallelujah. The great strength of Satan versus the strength of God in his church. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus says, "Not if I speak to the mountain." &gt;&gt; What did he say? &gt;&gt; If you speak, so where's the power to speak? &gt;&gt; It's in you. &gt;&gt; So tonight, speak for your children. Speak for your family. Speak for those that are not here. Say, "Lord, they're not here. I don't know where they are, but I'm speaking for them, God. Turn them around. Bring conviction upon them. Speak the word and go forward. Speak the word and don't worry what's going to happen. God will bring them in. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, please listen to me. This is the last message. &gt;&gt; Putting on the whole armor. &gt;&gt; Said I I'll be with my army. &gt;&gt; Not only that, but I'm going in my army. &gt;&gt; Hey, brother Paul. This is powerful, man. &gt;&gt; He says not only uh he says I I'll be with my army. Not only that, but I'm going in my army. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Think of it. Our great warrior, great triumph word general in us. The word who was made flesh and triumph over every demon. Watch every sickness, &gt;&gt; every death, hell in the grave. That same general is in us. &gt;&gt; Hey, brother. Come on, man. You've got to preach back. You can't sit like that. The same general that overcame everything. He overcame death. He overcame every demon. The same general is in us tonight. That's why we have the right to command Satan. Be careful. Satan, get out of my way. Satan, you're a liar. The general in me speaks to you. Come on, man. The general is in you tonight. Speak the word. Speak the word. Hallelujah. The same general is in you tonight. Woo! I feel so happy, man. The He doesn't go with you, but he's in you tonight. Hallelujah. What a glorious time. Brother Charles, the great general is in you. healed you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? Brother three. In us, &gt;&gt; not with us. Brother Green, not with us. He's in us. &gt;&gt; The great general that already overcame. &gt;&gt; And he says, because I overcome, you will overcome. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Raymond, I can't get rid of this." Get the general in there and watch how you overcome, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] triumph over every sickness, even death, hell, and the grave. That same general is in us &gt;&gt; with us. How long? How long is he going to be with us? &gt;&gt; Just from revival till the next convention, &gt;&gt; till the next &gt;&gt; till we get back into our homes. &gt;&gt; He says, watch here. Till the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Come on, friend. Hallelujah. He's going to be with us until the end of the world. He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you, but I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world." Right on down. Think of it. The one that's leading the battle, every power of the enemy is defeated. &gt;&gt; When he was here on earth, he took the word and triumphed over everything. &gt;&gt; Satan had. He triumphed over death. He triumphed over hell. He triumphed over the grain. He rose up on the third day and he's come back now living in the church. &gt;&gt; So he doesn't live in a church building. Who's the church? &gt;&gt; Who's the church? &gt;&gt; You're the church. So the general is living in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We leave from this church. But you know tomorrow will be church. &gt;&gt; Tuesday will be church. Who's the church? God goes to church every day. He wakes you up. He's going to church. &gt;&gt; Okay. The same word that the word is in us living himself punctuating every sign of the resurrection. He's coming. Amen. He's doing it today in every time when the great evening lights are begin to shine. Hallelujah. Great warrior. Christ already triumph. &gt;&gt; Ain't a thing for me to do. Now what you worried? &gt;&gt; Ain't a thing for me to do. Just follow. &gt;&gt; After these meetings when you go back to your city, don't worry to do anything. Just follow what was being said. &gt;&gt; The enemy is going to come and say, "What happened here? It turned that was nothing. He's a liar. You going back with your head back, your shoulders raised. You charge with the Holy Spirit. You heard from your theophony. Your glorified condition is going with you. And you're going to be charged up. No more trouble to the pastor. You're going to hold his hands up. You're going to support. You're going to be an asset, not a deficit. We don't want deficit Christians in the church. We want people that is a asset. Prayer warriors, mothers that pray, fathers that pray. Hallelujah. That come to church not expecting something, but they make something happen. They under the anointing of God. They the answer to the church. Hallelujah. Are you an asset or are you a deficit? &gt;&gt; I can't hear you in the back there. Are you a asset or are you a deficit? Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother, I got a first quote I left here. I left it out, &gt;&gt; but I just want to quote it. He says, "No man has a right to make any claims on God." &gt;&gt; Maybe I can go to it. &gt;&gt; I know the ministers will like this. We sit too much with people that trying to bind the church. Brother Green, you know what? &gt;&gt; They can't put their hands on this lady. &gt;&gt; This lady is God's wife. &gt;&gt; You think he's going to leave it over to man to man handle it? &gt;&gt; You're in trouble. Whoever man's handles this pride is in trouble, brother. &gt;&gt; This lady belongs to him. He says here dedication the trouble of today we try to yoke up with everything &gt;&gt; the churches the trying to yoke up with the world but the power of God is not yolked up to nobody but God. &gt;&gt; Nobody but God. God's power is not yolked up to your group. My group has it. My church has it. Listen man, if you got it, you don't have to say anything. If if it's there, it speaks for itself. And your church don't have it. You don't have it. God has the power. Amen, brother Charles. Amen. Away with this foolishness. We tired of it. We need God to come on the scene. We need a uniting. We need a forgiving. We need to love. We need to drop the odds. Stop waiting for the next person to come and fix up. You You go and say, "Lord, I'm to the person, I'm sorry, man. We come in the church with OS and we go out with OS. Last year you had the same OS. It's another convention. You're still sitting with the same one. Come on, brother. It's time to drop your odds that God can move in the church. Signs, wonders, and miracles when we are a united group and forgiving one another and loving one another. Hallelujah. Let's love one another. Let's forgive one another. Let's bless one another. Let's love one another. Put your arm around that brother. Put your arm around the sister and say, "Amen. You my brother. You my sister, man." Tell your brother. Tell your sister. You're my sister. You're my brother, man. Oh, hallelujah. You're my brother. Brother Isaac, I love you, man. Brother Paul, you're my brother. Wow, what an anointing. You see, it's time we break the pattern. It's time we act different. Stop sitting there and being a usual thing. No, God wants you to break it. Go out of your queue and go to the someone that don't you never greet. &gt;&gt; The one you always taught. You must go to her and go to him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Forget about your click and your group and the one YouTube. Hey, that's nonsense, man. We all brothers and sisters. We all love one another. There ought to be no clicks in the church. No, I don't talk with that group and I'm with this group and you only chat. Come on, man. You better delete it. If that's here on your on your phone, delete your group. Come on man. I feel the Holy Ghost saying that. Not me. You heard brother Green. It should not mean the Holy Spirit. God is sick and tired of this. &gt;&gt; And you know what? You think God don't know it. &gt;&gt; As I'm speaking here, he knows your thoughts. &gt;&gt; He know if you resenting me. &gt;&gt; He know if you are pushing this to a side. That's the God we serve. So you can't bluff him. You can bluff me and bluff the pastor, but you can't bluff him. &gt;&gt; He knows what's in your heart. And if you walk out of this convention not fixing up, brothers and sisters, I don't know what your end will be. &gt;&gt; But I know if you tonight surrender and say, "God, I want to go free. &gt;&gt; The days are so short. The coming of the Lord is upon us. The stage is set, brother. Anything can happen now. So get rid of your clicks &gt;&gt; and your clan. &gt;&gt; You know what that does? It brings division, man. &gt;&gt; Now we leave the poor ones out and you leave the unrecognized. We leave them out. &gt;&gt; If you're doing that is sad. You better change tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God's power is your power. So what I'm saying tonight, you can go free &gt;&gt; cuz God's power is in us &gt;&gt; and we can change the setup. &gt;&gt; You can get rid of that enemy that keeps you bound &gt;&gt; because listen to what the Bible says. Greater is he that's in you &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; He that's trying to keep you bound. You stay with that problem and you stay bound. &gt;&gt; You know what? You walk with it for years. But it takes you one minute or a few seconds &gt;&gt; to get rid of it. &gt;&gt; But you sitting with it for years &gt;&gt; and if you just go and say forgive me, &gt;&gt; it takes two seconds, two words, three words and watch you walk around for 20 years, you get delivered at that same time, brother. So do it tonight, brother. Get rid of that and walk upright and watch God come your way. Watch the sick being healed. Once the miracles take place, then we are a united group with nothing in our hearts. [Applause] &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; living punctuating every sign and resurrection is coming. He's doing it today every time when the great evening lights are shining. &gt;&gt; He says, listen here, Satan could not take them. He could not drown drown Noah in the flood until the purpose of God had been finished. He could not burn up the Hebrew children until the purpose of God had been finished. He could not kill Job with boils and troubles until the purpose of God had been finished. Neither can he take the li to take Daniel in the lion's den until the purpose had been finished. Neither could the death and old age take Abram until the purpose of God had been finished. Neither can he take you or take me until the purpose of God is finished. &gt;&gt; Hey brother, come on now man. He can't take you. Why are you here? Co came, he didn't take you. You were in a car accident, he didn't take you. Brother Charles, you got sick, he couldn't take you. God's purpose is Listen, man. You got a purpose on earth. You're not just here yet to fill a chair. You're not just here yet to go work and come back, but you're here yet to fulfill God's purpose. If you don't fulfill God's purpose, then you missed your you missed your chance. &gt;&gt; You missed it. &gt;&gt; But if you say, "Lord, I'm here to fulfill my purpose." What is my purpose? To be a daughter of God. To be a son of God. I live on my job like I'm a daughter of God on the college in the university. I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. Then you walk like one. You talk like one. You dress like one. You look like one because you're a son and a daughter of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh my God. We are daughters and and sons and daughters of God. Praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; My neither can he take you or me brook Isaac until the purpose of God of our life is finished. So we gather from there consolation. And why does God let troubles come and harness troubles and put bits in the mouth and makes it obey him? Are those troubles to bring us into a closer fellowship with God? &gt;&gt; He says, don't now here's a quote. Don't fear, John. &gt;&gt; Don't fear little flock. &gt;&gt; Oh, listen. Don't fear, man. &gt;&gt; Do they have that slide &gt;&gt; on fear? Maybe just find out. Do they have it? &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't fear little flock. All that I am, you are to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, yeah, I got it. &gt;&gt; All my power is yours. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, brother. All my power is yours. So don't fear, little folk. My omnipotence is yours. As I stand in your midst, I have come to I didn't come to bring fear and failure, but I came to bring love and ability and courage. All power was given unto me and it's yours to use. You speak the word and I will perform it. &gt;&gt; He didn't say I speak the word. You speak the word. Speak the word tonight, brother. We're going to have a healing line, but speak the healing now. I don't care what you're suffering with. I don't care if it's diabetes. I don't care if it's high blood. I don't care if it's cancer. I don't care if you if you're blind, if you halt. Speak the word now. I shall be healed. I shall be delivered. You speak it and I will fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, if you don't speak it, it stays on the books and tapes. But when you speak it, &gt;&gt; then I will fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Brother Green, we have to speak it, man. We have to say it. He says here, I will perform it. That's my covenant &gt;&gt; and I can never fail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now watch. He says here, Israel and the church. He says here and he goes on. He says, "I believe that the there's a church on the road tonight. A power of the living God that men will speak the word here and there and it will flash like lightning." And the church is coming out not a psychologist, not some put on and make believe, but a real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost called out church. Not a false brother, not a false five-fold ministry, but a true one will speak the word and it will flash like lightning. &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? If you pull on the Holy Ghost, he'll anoint me. And I'll say something and and it will go right there where you sitting. &gt;&gt; It will flash like light in and all of a sudden you feel anointed around you because you put on the Holy Ghost. You spoke it. You said it. And the Holy Ghost heard it. Now he anoints a minister and he speaks a word over you. My can I predict man? I'm every demon. Listen devil. We taking every spirit under our control. Everyone I don't care the people is tired. I don't care if what's wrong with them. But we taking every spirit under our control because the power that he had he gave to us. &gt;&gt; That general is in us. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Praise God. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; He says there's been churches, churches, brides, brides, but there's coming in one of the mechanics and dynamics. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. He says you have question and answers. Oh, brother, give me a church full of the Holy Ghost. God will do in one year what the theologians failed to do in 2,000 years. He says, "You wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home." And that faithful little remnant after the doors of the Gentiles is closed. Oh, God will anoint the church then. And and he that's faith, let him be filthy still. He that's righteous, let him be righteous still. And he that's holy, let him be holy still. And God will anoint the church with the power of God. And things will take place not only then, but he's doing it now. So listen brother, we making it present tense tonight, &gt;&gt; sister. Did you hear that? We making it present tense tonight. &gt;&gt; Tonight you can be healed. Tonight you can go free. Hey, come on, man. I see people being set free. I see the demons running, brother.

He know when he walks in here what you coming for. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Is there a shout in the house? &gt;&gt; Satan hates worship. He wanted the worship in heaven and he was kicked out. &gt;&gt; So we don't worship the devil. They worship him at the discourse. They worship him there wherever they're going. But here in this house, hey, we worshiping the King of Kings. We jumping. We shouting. We happy, brother. Why? Because he's the King of Kings and he's the Lord of Lords. And only your worship will he accept, brother. Let them have the world. Let them have their nightclubs. Let them have their ochre pipes, but give us Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My he says, "Come, Lord Jesus, perfect strength. Get away your church. And if it be your will, Lord, just before the church is raptured, watch &gt;&gt; what the prophecy hanging over this bride. Just before the church is raptured, may there rise what power. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Theo, I feel my faith muscles. I feel like you Moses going to the gym and you can see there. But I tell you, if you see me spiritually, I'm small, but you must see me inside. You'll be shocked how I'm built, brother. A small man with a big God in his heart. And I don't care how small you are. I don't care your situation. You've got a big God in you, a big general that overcame the world. So that God that's in you is greater than the world, brother, and what he has to offer you. Come on, young people. I want to tell you this. You think the world is smart and the word is good. And you see this young people with all this gold in their nose, in the earrings, and funny. I mean, how can you pierce your nose and put funny stuff in there? God didn't make you that way. But you see that's become the trend. &gt;&gt; It's the bling thing to do. And if it's not that, it's status. &gt;&gt; Now they have it all over. So they have to wear these short clothes to show it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Listen, sister. Listen, brother, young person. Don't compromise to be recognized. &gt;&gt; Don't compromise. I don't care what your peers say. I don't care how how they tell you. You look nice with it. It's a lie from the devil. Come I tell you, the world is nothing but garbage with cream on top of it, brother. And the young people see the cream, but they don't know they living off garbage. And they dying by the hundreds, man. But God has called you out. He must have some young people that is going to say, "Listen, in Trinidad, there were some young people that served me. There were some young girls and brothers that served me. Brother, come on. You're a child of God. You're a daughter of God. And the five-star general is in you. Hallelujah. Our brother said, "When you go from here, know that Jesus is always with you." &gt;&gt; But I want to say this quote says he's in you. &gt;&gt; Not with you, not above you, not on the side. He's in you. &gt;&gt; And greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Thank God, brother Olu, for those angels. Yo, [Applause] &gt;&gt; wow. &gt;&gt; What an anointing, man. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; If it be your will, Lord, before the church is raptured, may there power, oh God, fill these vessels. Now, in order to be filled, you must be empty, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I can't fill this glass if it's full. &gt;&gt; If it's full, I can't fill it. So, you got to empty it. &gt;&gt; Here's the empty one. &gt;&gt; It's empty. &gt;&gt; So, in order for God to fill you, &gt;&gt; what must you be? &gt;&gt; Empty. But the trouble is we some of us is so full of ourselves. &gt;&gt; God can't fill us. &gt;&gt; Me, I promise we we full of the world. &gt;&gt; We full of television. &gt;&gt; We full of everything that's done in the world. So God can't fill you. &gt;&gt; So what you got to do? You got to die &gt;&gt; and empty yourself out. And when you empty yourself out and you even shake it brother to make sure every drop is out then when you fill then God can fill you. Pour in the Holy Ghost pour in the virtues. Pour in himself and then he can fill you. But you know what Bible says? Sometimes we full of nonsense. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We give the pastor unnecessary troubles because we full of nonsense. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet says. Not even me. You're so full of yourself and pride. You full of nonsense. &gt;&gt; You come to the church and it's N. Oh, Africans. You you you cross. You're upset. You got a long face. You don't know if I can hug you. I don't know if I can shake your hand. Just come on, man. Says God's people is happy people. &gt;&gt; He says, you know, God's people, there's people you want to be around them. You know why? It's the atmosphere they create. You want to be in the in the atmosphere. You want to be with them. And you know, I hate somebody that looks down on the next person. Who gives that person the right to look down on the next person and speak down on them? This is God's people, man. You know, David had this against Goliath. I don't care if they were backsliden. He says, "You let this uncircumcised Philistines defy the armies of the living God." I don't care what condition they were. I don't care what was happening. They stole the armies of the living God. Woo! Hallelujah. I got to walk, brother. This is still the armies of the living God. I don't care they backsliden. I don't care they something wrong with them. They still the armies of the living God. And we challenging the devil. You uncircumcised Philistine. Let my people go. Hallelujah. Let my people go. This is God's people. This is God's sheep. And that was the thing that David had against Goliath. Don't speak against the armies of the living God. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; My my my &gt;&gt; you know when when they see the church they think the church is cooled off Bruthio and then they run they run from this church to another church and they come and they find it's the same thing. &gt;&gt; They can't get along with someone here. They run there. They meet the same person with the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Brother Green, brother says he can't even adopt you. because you blown around with every wind and doctrine. This coming and there you go. The next don't come and there you go. &gt;&gt; But brother, you know a Christian is solid. &gt;&gt; He Psalms 23, I'll be like a tree that's what planted by the rivers of water. And he says you can't move him. Everything he does will prosper. He says he's watered by the nine springs of the fountain. His roots are in the water, brother. And every day you come to church, you see this man is on fire. This sister is on fire. Why? You're a tree planted by the rivers of water. &gt;&gt; My what a convention, man. I never felt the freedom of God to speak like this at a convention and feel the anointing only, brother. If the anointing is not there, I'll get out of the pullpit. But if the anointing is here, I'm going to say what he put on my heart. And somebody's going to go free. Somebody's going to be anointed. Somebody's going to be delivered. Somebody's going to come back and say, "Pastor, I'm free. This convention set me free. We tired, man. We as pastors, we tired struggling with people year in and year out. And there's no change. &gt;&gt; No change. [Applause] Come on, man. &gt;&gt; If you're not free, you better slam your feet. Start marching. You know what that did? Oh my. Yes. Something. You remember those lepers? &gt;&gt; When they started walking, &gt;&gt; God made the enemies have such a fright. They said, "The Israelites has hired more armies." But just because they were walking, God multiply their footsteps. Let's let's do it again. Hey, God is going to multiply your footsteps, brother. And the demons are going to run because they hear the rumble of God's people. Walk, brother. Walk, sister. Jump. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God will magnify your footsteps.

Hallelujah. Come on, brother. I feel the power of God. Yes. Come on. Just rumble. God will magnify. God will take care of the enemy. That's why you have to do nothing, man. Just follow. [Applause] I say Phil, just before the rapture, may there rise power. &gt;&gt; Oh God, fill these vessels. Raise them up, Lord. &gt;&gt; Shake this world once more. We know it will be pass time. There'll be no more repentance. Now, I told you at the first meeting I preached, &gt;&gt; the foolish virgin came when it was too late. &gt;&gt; Noah's day the the door was shut seven days before the rain fell. &gt;&gt; Brother B says, "If this happens, it will be past repentance. Time for repentance. &gt;&gt; There'll be no repentance then. It will be too far up for them. But show your power, Lord. Fill these vessels, shake this world like it's never been shook before. Take your church then and leave the world in a chaos that she sits in. Hallelujah. And God is going to take this bride first. Fill them &gt;&gt; today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It can happen tonight. &gt;&gt; It can be in this prayer line. God fills you. Shake the world once more. He's going to shake the world. Hallelujah. Once more, Lord.

I seen the trouble he did or what he does &gt;&gt; cuz we only friends with so and so. &gt;&gt; That's why I said let's get connected this way. &gt;&gt; We too much this way connected. &gt;&gt; Our phones are even full. Your phone tell you hey your phone is full. &gt;&gt; But we want to stay connected. &gt;&gt; Delete. &gt;&gt; Delete. &gt;&gt; Delete. There's a button called delete. And if you don't have the other group on your phone, put them on your group and send them a nice message and watch the difference. &gt;&gt; Next time that sister will come smiling. Oh, what? I got I got a I got a WhatsApp from Sister Susan. So a nice message. Why? You broke the circle. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we know what we're talking about. We're all pastors. We go through this. So he says here, "Leave the world. It will be pass past time to repent." &gt;&gt; You see, man is going to come when they close these doors, lock it up. It becomes a storehouse and then they're going to want to run and come to church. &gt;&gt; Pastor, what's happening? &gt;&gt; Brother Isaac, why? Why is the church locked? &gt;&gt; Isn't there no more service? Nothing was said on the chat. &gt;&gt; There was no poster made. What's going on? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you find out the world counselor church has locked the church &gt;&gt; cuz brother theo is not going to sign up. &gt;&gt; I tell you this is a reality &gt;&gt; and it's moving upon us fast. &gt;&gt; It's moving very fast. &gt;&gt; It can still happen. It can be enforced this year still &gt;&gt; and here here you are in this glorious meetings &gt;&gt; and you're still stubborn and arrogant. Say, "Lord, break it tonight." &gt;&gt; You know, God's God's love is corrective love. &gt;&gt; Not not human passion that pet you and say, "No, you're right." God's love is corrective. &gt;&gt; God's love correct the error. &gt;&gt; He says, "The hour is close at hand." When you're going to see something happen, when something is going to take place and all this background here has only been laying a foundation for what? A short quick message to do what? To shake the nations. &gt;&gt; What was this message? Just to lay what? A foundation. For a short quick message to do what? To shake the nations, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you heard that, man. How is God going to shake the nations? &gt;&gt; Not with Donald Trump. No, &gt;&gt; not with a president. &gt;&gt; He's going to shake the nations with you. &gt;&gt; God is going to shake the world and shake the world and shake the world until the grave shake loose. And before you know, here comes in brother Brennham. Here comes in my Oh, come on, man. You know the ones that died and here they come walking in. Why? Because you are going to shake the world. &gt;&gt; How you going to do it with the life that you live? Not the message, you know, the life that you live. &gt;&gt; They'll see Christ again in you once more. Again, the world will see Christ in you. The life of Christ. Bible says they said, "There goes a woman. She's just like Christ." There goes a man's just like Christ. &gt;&gt; Where will they see Christ? In you, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I better get out here. My my my this background here has been laying a foundation for a short quick message to shake the whole nation. &gt;&gt; He says, "Listen, I'm wanting to happen now &gt;&gt; that the anointing will strike the whole church. Not some, the whole church. &gt;&gt; We so burdened for everyone." &gt;&gt; Because we see you slothful. &gt;&gt; We see you negligent. You just come and and there's nothing, no zeal, no fire. &gt;&gt; He says that will strike the whole church of the living God. She'll rise up, he says, to her feet like a mighty marching army. The sick will be healed by a word. The blind will see and the deaf will hear. The dead will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world. With the church of the living God. How's God going to shake the world? With the church of the living God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. my &gt;&gt; my will with the church of God. We're in the process of it right now. I believe soon coming into pass. I believe it will be just exactly that way. I believe it's going to strike the church of God soon. And it's going to start a revival that will shake the world. I believe it. Listen, brother. They'll be flying up. What's the other island? Tobago. &gt;&gt; And all the other islands, they'll be flying in here to find out what's happening. God has shaken the world. He's shaking Trinidad. He's shaking TNT. Listen, he doesn't need a cricket world. He doesn't need a World Cup soccer. He doesn't need that, brother. He just need a church. One man is an individual. You know, if there's going to be a revival in this church, you must say, "Lord, let me be the revival. I'm not looking for the pastor. I'm not looking for the deacons. Make me the revival." Woo! Hallelujah. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. He says here it will start revival and shake the world. I believe it. Hallelujah. Let me say this. If you count me to be a fanatic from this night on, that's the very same thing that I'm speaking of. It will be done. There'll be power put in the church. Watch. It's all back to the church. &gt;&gt; There'll be a power put in the church. And now he's coming in that the Holy Spirit will so anoint the people. They will speak the word and it will create itself there. We haven't seen powers like it's coming into the church and that is a fact. &gt;&gt; Say to this mountain we move and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass. You can have what you have said. The placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church. Then the critics's mouths are going to be shut. &gt;&gt; Oh, let the dogs bark now, brother. &gt;&gt; But the caravan is moving on. We're going onto that power. We're going on to that anointing. He says we're marching forward. We carrying on after this meetings. We're not going to sit back. &gt;&gt; No, brother. We might dismiss from the convention, but we're taking the spirit with us, brother. We're taking this anointing with us. Go back to your church. Brother Olu, may you have a new church when you get back. Brother Paul, may you have a new church. Brother Theo, may your church turn around and cause a revival. And if my church is watching, may you start a revival. By the time I come back, there's a revival in the church. It takes one man, one woman that's desperate toward God. My brother Green, may there be revival in your church. We prophesy and we we knock in the demons left, right, and center. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My it won't last long. &gt;&gt; Only a short time. Jesus came right off the mountain and straight to Calvary. &gt;&gt; He says here the hour is coming when this world will shake under the impact of the church of the living God &gt;&gt; and moving forward in his great power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen. He says we'll step forward. I'm closing as the musicians come. He says we going and he says when the pyramid gets to the top when the full sons of God will be manifest. When the power of God will walk out. Watch &gt;&gt; where's the power going to be, brother Paul? It's going to walk out. I'm going to say something. I know you're tired, but don't miss this. &gt;&gt; Jesus took the book, right? &gt;&gt; In Luke, &gt;&gt; he went into the temple. They gave him the book. &gt;&gt; He found the place where it was written of him [Applause] &gt;&gt; and he read it, &gt;&gt; closed the book, &gt;&gt; gave it back to the blind ministers. And you know what he said? This day the scripture is fulfilled. What happened, brother? The word became flesh. &gt;&gt; Where's the book tonight? It's not in New York. It's not in South Africa. It's not in Nigeria. It's not in Guateva. But you are the book. You're the book walking on two feet. You're the book that became flesh. You're the book brother Penam spoke about. You are that book. Woo. Hallelujah. Let's stamp our feet, man. Come on, brother. We walking over demons. We walking over devils. Hallelujah. Come on, man. You are the book made flesh. It's no more a quote. It's become a living manifestation. We are the book. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are the book. Brother Paul and brother says he closed the book and he gave it back to them. to manage still a closed book. &gt;&gt; Close. &gt;&gt; Close. &gt;&gt; They still preach six seals. &gt;&gt; They don't know the seven seal is open. &gt;&gt; And where are you? You're not under the six seals. &gt;&gt; You under the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; And when he opened the seven seal, what was there? Your names was written there. Your name is there tonight. That's why we're on our feet, brother. We shouting tonight. I saw my name. My name is under the seventh seal and under the seven seal was seven thunders and that's why I'm a part of that. I can't help to scream. I can't help to be happy, brother. I can't help to preach this way. I saw my name. Did you see your name? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Stay to your feet. Don't sit, please. Wow. I feel anointing, &gt;&gt; Andrew. I feel an anointing here, man. I feel it here. I don't know if it's there by you, but I feel the power of God is filled here. I feel the prayer line is going to be powerful. Hallelujah. And your attitude is going to determine your healing tonight. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave all the other quotes here. Powerful ones. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother said this in in Harrisburg. I'm sure you remember it. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so wonderful. &gt;&gt; You know, there's one thing I liked in school when they had the racing. You know how they used to race and they had the 100 meter and the 200 and 400. But you know what to me was the best race &gt;&gt; was a relay race. &gt;&gt; Oh, that was the most beautiful one. When that came up, brother, I tell you, brother Olu, I used to like go crazy. &gt;&gt; It's one of the best races in in the Olympics, whatever you want. &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking on my school days when I was unsaved. &gt;&gt; I don't go to those places now. &gt;&gt; But listen, man. God had seven runners. Now, normally they have four, &gt;&gt; but God had had seven runners &gt;&gt; to run this race. And the first one was Paul. &gt;&gt; He started the race. &gt;&gt; And maybe in those years didn't have a gun, maybe a whistle, whatever. And Paul ran, brother. &gt;&gt; He started running. &gt;&gt; And he ran in that day. And when he came to the end of the road, guess who was there? &gt;&gt; He gave the baton to who? &gt;&gt; Arinius. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Arinius took it and he ran. And when he came to the end, brother Paul, guess who was there? Martin &gt;&gt; and Martin took it and he ran his race. When he came to the end of his, who was there? &gt;&gt; Columba. &gt;&gt; Columbus took the pattern and he ran. When he came to the end, who was there? &gt;&gt; Luther. &gt;&gt; And when Luther protested and he ran that race, brother, it says one thunder, he shook the whole Roman Empire. &gt;&gt; Watch those seven thunders. If one thunder shook the Roman Empire, what the seven thunders going to do, brother? It's going to shake the world. And then Luther came to the end of his race, who was there? Wesley. &gt;&gt; And when he came to the end, who was there? Elijah. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hey, come on now, brother. &gt;&gt; Hey, you better be with me. Was that the end of the race? &gt;&gt; So Malachi ran. &gt;&gt; Hey, brother. He made sure he ran &gt;&gt; seven times across the world he went. But when he came to the end of his journey and his part that he had to run and then he came to the end and he said, "Listen, you here's the pattern. Say what I say. Do what the tape say. Stay with the message. Don't turn. Stay with the message. Don't blink it. Say what I said." And who was standing there? The bride. You got the message and listen brother. You say how come brother Amon the bride becomes the final voice to the final age. She takes it to the home run. So come on brother they without us. Brother Theo they not going to make it. So brother I can't give up. I got to run. Woo. I got to run. I got to go. Brother Brham is waiting for me. My wife is waiting. We got to run. Don't run back. Run forward. Come on brother. Let's run for Christ. We take it. Brother Brandham handed us the baton. Let's give the Lord a shout of praise, man. Oh, the musicians can come up. My my brother Green, he handed us the pattern and we're not going to fail. &gt;&gt; Your pro, you can't fail him. Brother Bram's waiting on you and me. We love him so but he without us &gt;&gt; cannot be made perfect. &gt;&gt; So guess who takes the final &gt;&gt; we take the final stretch &gt;&gt; and brother we're so close to the finish line. You can almost see hey there's the line. I can't go back now. It's nearer that way. Young people it's further to go back. I can almost see there's the finish line. And on the other side I see them waving. Woo. I see the process. Come on. Don't give up. Press on. Press on. Press on. Don't you feel like that tonight? Say, "Lord, I want to press on tonight." Just bow your head and close your eyes and say, "Lord, tonight I feel your presence. I feel your anointing. Your power is my power. Your anointing is my anointing. &gt;&gt; And tonight, I want to make use of that tonight." And before we come into the prayer line, you already confess your sins and say, "Lord, whatever's wrong in my life, take it out tonight." So when I come through this prayer line, I I know I fixed up. I know I met right with God tonight. So we can sing that chorus. I don't know there's going to be a prayer line. And may the church may you be blessed. &gt;&gt; God bless you, man. It was so good to be here. &gt;&gt; It was so good. This place feel like home, brother Theo. I feel I feel the presence of God every time I come here. I feel the anointing of God and I know somebody's going to go free. We might not see it in here now, but brother Theo, you're going to hear testimonies. You're going to see people that was slow. You're going to see them now be coming to speed up. &gt;&gt; They're not going to mark time anymore. Oh, I feel like one more time. You know that marching, he sounds so good, man.

[Music] What's my main concern? because I'm going on the way. There's no more. Hallelujah. And I'm careless. I guess what you do or say [Music] promise even away. I told him I follow after all that I've been through. I'll be a fool is the turn loose. Oh, I'm going all the way. &gt;&gt; Let's Let's do this second verse together. Satan comes around. Woo!

I'm going all the way. I can't turn back now. I care less. I care less. I care less. I care less what you do or say. I made up my mind if he will lead the way. I told him I follow after all that I've been through. I feel foolish to turn it loose. my up in my mind. I'm going all the way. I'm going all the way. Going all the way. I'm going all the way to my world. Good morning. I'm going on away with my world. Good morning, glory. I'm going on away. When I get there, I'm going to tell my story. I'm going on away. I'm going on away. I got joy down in my soul. I'm going on away. I'm going all the way. Hallelujah. Glory. Can we give the Lord a shout of praise? My my season. [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; There's a shout of the king in the camp. How many appreciate the convention? How many appreciate the Lord? Glory. [Music] So, I'm here just to I'm think I'm losing my voice. We are here just to say thank you. As brother said, we don't want to be like the lepers who never came back, but that one who said thank you. &gt;&gt; So, can we just firstly thank the Lord for making a way, for making this happen. This is nothing but the Lord. Hasn't he been good? &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Now, if I were to try to call all of the names that had a part to play, we would have quite a lot of names to call because this would have been impossible without the workers that worked behind the scenes in so many different ways. And we would have to call some teams, some different departments. But we want you to know we certainly appreciate you all for the part that you played from just worshiping to being present to the hospitality team to the different areas. We love you. We thank you. This would not be possible without you. So I believe it was Buddhan who said give your give give a round of applause just for you being here because many times we say if we just have preachers and nobody to preach to we don't have a convention &gt;&gt; and if we have the people to preach to and no preachers we don't have a convention so we need all the different parts but I really want to acknowledge firstly you may not have seen them or know they're around but I want to salute but Alino Torado in the back in the booth translating the services into Spanish for the believers who were streaming in Spanish. Brother Lo, God bless you. Thank you for coming. Thank you for the Spanish translation. And I know the believers, the Spanish speaking believers certainly appreciate him. And next to him is brother at who did the French translation for the French streaming. So the services were in English, French, and Spanish. So may the Lord bless you brothers. They preached seven services &gt;&gt; because they translated all the services. So may God renew your strength and bless you abundantly in a mighty precious name of Jesus Christ. And what can we say about the ministers who stood behind the sacred desk from the greeting to the ministry of the word from the very first service to see how God scripted what took place. You know there was no people ask sometime what's the theme of the convention and for this convention and like last year we said whatever the Lord puts upon your heart is the theme of the convention let the Lord deal and as brother Green said every gift that was born to be in its place once it in place that's God using it and didn't we see that on display over this convention from brother Joash from the very first how the service started to brother she oh what a what What a what a masterpiece of a message. What a masterpiece of a greeting. And brother Hashem is 80 years old or so. And I saw him step out behind the pulpit and I say, "Man, God give us more preachers like brother Joash and brother Shem. You appreciate those brothers. Brother Joash, if you're listening, Brother Shem, God bless you. We love you and appreciate you." And then the second service, how many appreciate brother Yadel Thornne who stood and oh what a what a powerful greeting and our precious brother Stephan Skull and Rena who brought the message on that night. What a time in the presence of the Lord. And then yesterday morning, brother Norris. Brother Norris is still here with us. Brother Norris, we salute you for putting your shoulder to the wheel. And then brother Raymond Thomson man if I tell you brother Raymond is an inspiration to us. Brother Raymond, thank you for for coming all the way from South Africa to be a blessing. Amen. And then, Brother Paul Onan Jacob from Ivory Coast. I appreciate Brother Paul. Amen. And brother Andrew Furong who came next. Brother Andrew, we thank you for the greeting. Amen. How do I &gt;&gt; But [Music] Thank you. Amen. Amen. It's just so humbling. And and you know, I was speaking to a few friends and I said the attacks on families, on homes, on marriages, on parents have been unprecedented. We have lost many. And there are many wounded soldiers. They're coming to church, but they are wounded soldiers. And it's a real burden in our hearts because we are promised our families. &gt;&gt; And I believe to give comfort to all of us in this meeting knowing we are leaving with the devil under our feet, not one will be left behind. And if that is one thing we leave this meeting with is God is going to bless you for standing with this message in the face of every obstacle. So may God continue to bless you. And then this morning to have a greeting from brother Nigel alert. You appreciate brother Nigel and and then this morning brother Olu's message. Brother Olu, this is his church. They are blended with us here in Hes Tabernacle. And then what can we say about tonight? Our precious brother Albert Green. You appreciate brother Green [Music] and with the Raymond coming again to cap it all off. What a tremendous time in the Lord. and then to see how the Lord orchestrated because every service had a different song leader. You appreciate the song leaders and behind the scenes a lot of what transpired I can tell you was not planned. It was just the Lord moving things around. The best plan on paper just crumbled when the Holy Ghost said this is how it's going to happen. and to see it unfolded in a way that there are things that happened that we had no control over and we could see God saying, "No, that's not what I want." And whatever God wanted is what happened. So, I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt, there was no paper that spoke of what you saw this weekend. The paper that was written, that paper was destroyed because the Lord had how he wanted it. So, I want to salute all the song leaders from brother Zoe to brother Anthony. You appreciate those brothers. To brother Gideon, to brother Sirill. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. To brother Ofnneel. It's so many of them. I forget to brother Steven Olive and to brother Fei. Every gift was different. The way the Holy Spirit was able to move through each one. So, we appreciate all of the song leaders. And then the musicians. There were some rotations in there. But every service you salute the musicians [Music] cuz all these are different ministries that without them you can't have the meeting. &gt;&gt; So from sister Naomi Maxshine, Sister Eden Hernandez on the violin because all the gifts just they were in and out but God was just moving in and out. So, brother Anthony O'Brien, brother Oil, brother Mvin Otley, brother David Azima, Daniel Olofin, brother Gideon Oin, brother Steven Oliver, brother Michael Blackman, brother Andy Henry, brother Michael Thomson, brother Ethan Balbosa, all of the different gifts. What can we say? Faith comes by hearing. [Music] Right now, those technicians have a lot of power because they can cut off this thing here right now. So, we thank God that during the convention, they never cut us off and not only made it work, but was able to coordinate all of the logistics of the different songs. We want to salute brother Daniel Bishop, brother Timothy, brother Francis Timothy, brother Timothy Granville, brother Jesse Utley, brother Ian Paul Francis, brother Nicholas Citaram, brother Adrien Joseph, brother Steven Thompson, brother Shane Williams, brother Kenneth Bullis, brother Jose Noak Puddter. It was a blended team and they worked so well together. God bless you. We thank you. We love you for the streaming and the sound and all of the cameras and all of those things. What what a grace of God to us. And for the ministers that are here and those I want to acknowledge. I I think I saw him. He may not be here now, but brother Peters uh was here with us this afternoon, but the MelchzDC is here with us still. Brother Norris, Brother Harry, Brother Andrew, and for the many ministers that passed through the meeting, whether Nigel Alert, Brother Joash, Brother Shem, Brother Thornell, Brother Yadel, Brother Richard, Brother Roland, Brother Tuxing, uh, Brother Rat and George. We appreciate all of the ministers who were in for the different services and for the believers that came from the different fellowships. We thank you all. What can we say about the hospitality team and the food and the preparation? I want to give acknowledgement to Sister Oid and to my wife, Sister Karen. I don't even think they're upstairs because they're getting prepared for us to go down. So, we thank them and the teams and all of the maintenance team, the the building and the landscaping and the car park attendant and the medical team. You know, we we had a conversation around people, you know, sometimes have a medical situation and they have a a triage process. We pray first, then we test. So, they have all the blood pressure things and the all these things there, but the first the first response is get the elders to pray, then we check your blood pressure. So, we thank all the medical teams that have been supporting those and all of the pieces working in such harmony and such unity. And you could just think it as we get nearer to the headstone. It's one Lord. It's one faith. It's one body. And brother Brandham said, "One day the water will rise so high that the ducks will just fellowship." And it's such a beautiful thing to fellowship, the unity of the spirit before we see the unity of the faith. &gt;&gt; So I don't believe I hope I'm not forgetting anything. How many appreciate our host pastor [Applause] But Oie, we love you. We appreciate you. And I want to salute two special brothers as well. Before I get to them, I want to appreciate the team that handle the transport and the logistics for moving the believers from the hotel to the service and all the different things. And you know there's a lot that goes behind the scene. I want to want to release to brother Steven Olive. I don't know where he is. Is brother Steven upstairs hiding. He's hiding in the back. You know Steven's role is so important that this list that I'm working off of. He did it. That's how much of a support he is to what I have to do. But the role that he plays is not even here. He's trying to confuse me so that I forget and I'm like I know I'm missing something. But there are two brothers who are really critical in supporting my role and that's brother Steven Oliveri our administrative elder. Brother Steven, God bless you. Thank you for your support. Thank you for all the WhatsApp messages at 1:00 a.m. 1000 p.m. 5:00 a.m. He has this way of reminding you. God bless you. Receive and brother Mike Blackman who's our operational director. these two brothers because I always say the best what the best place plans come under fire and whenever anything goes out of line those are the two brothers I call and very seldom do we need to we need to escalate it to to the pastor but we really appreciate brother Steven and brother Mike Blackman for their support I believe that should be it now anything else is it So wonderful. So may the Lord richly bless you. And I want to call our host pastor to close us out in a word of prayer. And uh [Music] &gt;&gt; what? Yes. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. They were going to lynch me after service. [Music] I really want to salute our head deacon and all of the deacons and the ushers and what we saw was really unique because we had a blended team of deacons from Hon Tabernacle and from Lagos and you couldn't tell them apart and you know when you're from one body when you can't tell them apart. So we really salute the deacons and the ushers. Amen. So I believe that should be it. And uh you know we do have the hospitality told me the hospitality team told me to make sure and bless the refreshments because we want to make sure we have enough. So let's bless. So in closing prayer but over if there ever was a time that we needed a miracle it's but we believe we have something for everyone. So we want we want you to leave here happy in joy and knowing that God has a plan and a place for you. So may the Lord rich you bless you. Thank you for coming but over. Amen. Let's stand. [Music] So I want to just leave this with you as we pray. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless thee and keep thee. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord make his face shine upon thee &gt;&gt; and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your love and your presence and your grace towards us. And I pray as the believers go to their homes and various places that you would bless them in a special way. And Father God, the meal, whatever have been prepared, may it sanctify it. May give strength to our bodies on life service. We commit them to thee, Father. We take the word and place it over them that the church will be strengthened that each pastor, each minister would be empowered by your spirit to lead the people where you want them to go. Granted, Father, in Jesus I ask it. Amen. God bless you. May have your seats as the ushers come forward. [Music] Live for you know every breath that I take. Every moment I'm awake. [Music] Have your way in me. Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you, Lord. Every breath that I take, the moment I'm awake, have your break in me. [Music] Hallelujah.
