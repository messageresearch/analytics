grateful for i am blessed this morning i have a lot to be thankful for jesus set me free the bible said that whom the son of man set free is free indeed and i'm very grateful this morning because what god have done for me nobody couldn't do that for me jesus dropped my charges jesus set me free and um what i'm going to tell her this morning is very short i don't want to take up too much of the time because i know brother i would have to come and bring the word but um it's a testimony that's upon my heart i need to share with the church god have been very very good to me god had been gracious to me i was backslidden and jesus dropped my charges you know a lot of people must be asking me brother linda what's happening with you what's going on with you and i try my best to go back in the word

washed me wide as snow hallelujah jesus he paid it all [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Laughter] [Music] sin left a crimson stain but he washed me wide as snow so you see all through the pandemic you know sometimes we seem that nothing could go right but just even during the pandemic jesus delivered me jesus set me free during the pandemic [Music] when you see sin allah wrong and death all along and jesus dropped my chest just jesus set me free i can't help but praise god and just two things quickly one of the things i am extremely happy about is to be a christian [Applause] you see sometimes sometimes we just be afraid to say it but say it tell your friends that i am a christian nothing wrong with that be proud to be a christian reproduction because the devil will let you know what time it is with you you know there was a time i got rob home in my house and i was backsliding at that time and god helped me a guy come with a gun in my head i got him a sun head and i was asked the first thing the first first thing i talked to the guy you know what i told him i was backsliding what i tell him i say i am a christian i say i am a child of god god help me jesus that's the timing that's called anybody lord you know jesus because i'm staring down the barrel of a gun are staring death in its eyes and all i do is say in jesus jesus jesus don't wait until you're dying or you have a stroke or somebody have a barrel to your head you know tell the devil i am a child of god i love jesus and um one of the things that i'm really happy about is that i do not have to walk or match to the drum of that devil's beat again i am happy i'm not eating pig food [Applause] i am happy i'm really happy you know i don't have a problem coming to church and worshiping god and blessing god you know i have plenty to thank god for you know i have plenty plenty if you know sometimes i just get excited about god's word i will come to church i will sit there and i will focus and i will worship and i will praise god i don't so a brother asks me your time better london you know what what you know what does inspire what does you know what does and sometimes i know myself is a miracle you know sometimes i doesn't even know what to say sometimes sometimes i just get flustered but just hearing god's word knowing where i was knowing that what god did for me in this time with sin sin unbelief and god gave me revelation of his grace and his mercy and his love i just can't help but just focus and taking god's word and worship worship god bless god so um two mondays ago i was cooking and um while cooking i'm just you know singing and worshipping god and cooking half past 10 in the morning it was on monday i'm sure and i felt the presence of god in my house i'm not just talking about you know some people say your poor's raised and that kind of thing i'm not talking about i'm talking about the presence of the lord i know the presence of the lord and i had to shut down my cooking i had to actually take off the stove and i went upstairs right and i went on my knees and i started worshiping god i started praising god and the presence came louder the person came stronger and i couldn't handle it again i was praying but i praying from the inside i was something crying out something wanted just i don't know but i thank god for his grace towards me because he didn't have to do it you know [Music] and my boast is in jesus my voice is in christ my voice is that whatever it is that the world have i don't want that you understand what i mean i want jesus i want the holy ghost i do not

right i want to talk right i want to talk like a son of the king i want them to know that jesus is my god and i want to operate in a particular way with reverence and respect that they will know that

and i want to just salute the pastor of god bless you brother god god bless you brother anthony god bless you amen and we really appreciate each and every one of you for making it out this morning breathing the weather the adverse weather amen and coming out of the house of the lord i trust that you'll be blessed tremendously amen amen so let's just turn to our bibles at this time thank you musicians praise god the two portions of scripture uh colossians chapter 3 verses 12 to 14. and first corinthians chapter 13 verses 8-10 praise the lord hallelujah heavenly father we pray a blessed your word as we read it now inspired your hearts in jesus name amen and amen verse 12 colossians chapter 3 verse put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness suffering for bearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgive you so also do we and above all these things put on charity which is a bond of perfectness praise the lord and first corinthians chapter 13 verse 8 charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away with nine for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with amen may the lord others which is blessings to the reading of the word amen god bless you may be seated this morning amen so my old title this morning is a heart of love and the inspiration is it will take perfect love amen praise god and from the message from that time brother branham is praying for the people he said lord i pray now that your spirit will be sweetly upon them let them say from this time on that their attitudes have changed the hardness that was in their hearts has melted away and a sweet peace and divine love have taken its place may each one receive the baptism of the love of god in their heart amen give the lord a hand of praise this morning amen is that your prayer this morning hallelujah for a baptism of the love of god in your hearts is that your prayer this morning give him praise give him praise hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus are you on the expectation this morning glory to god amen this is a very simple thought but i pray that the holy spirit will magnify to your hearts amen by the grace of god praise god amen so in mark chapter 12 30 it says thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart all thy soul all thy mind and all thy strength so we want to look at the heart to the amen we got to give him our whole hearts can we say amen amen and matthew chapter 22 verse 36 master which is a great commandment to the law jesus said unto him thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment hallelujah and then in luke chapter 10 a lawyer tried to attempt jesus he said master what shall i do to inherit eternal life jesus answered him thou shalt love thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy strength with all thy might and thy neighbor as thyself don't forget your neighbor now amen praise god one more scripture joshua chapter 22 take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which moses the seventh of the lord charged you to love the lord your god and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and soul can we say amen so in all these scriptures we see that we have to love god and serve him with all our hearts amen we see that god is interested in the heart of men amen can we say amen amen glory so from blind bartimaeus says don't trust in head knowledge because god knows your heart so yes we read and study and make sure you know every verse if you can knowledge is good we ought to have it but after all your knowledge god is still looking for something he's looking this morning he's looking past your knowledge is looking at hearts what is he looking for my and just for a background to show that god looks at the heart from first samuel chapter 13 and but isaac struck it in the bible study on march 9th speaking about king saul but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord had saw him a man after his own heart and the lord had commanded him to be captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the lord commanded thee glory so saul was in a battle against the philistines and the people were scattered all over and fearful saul wanted to offer up a peace offering to god to gain god's favor in a battle but instead of waiting on saul the prophet and priests saul went ahead and offered up the sacrifice for himself and god was displeased with saul's actions and right there the lord sought for another man after his own heart what is god looking for saul went on again later on the lord told saul to destroy the amalekites all of them and everything they had but saul kept the best sheep and cutter and only destroyed some which he felt were not valuable in addition saul did not execute king aegon as the lord instructed my and in first samuel 15 the lord repented that he had made saul king saul had turned from god's instructions and commandments my god and saul wanted to sacrifice some beasts unto the lord but god rejected king's soul and his offering right and samuel told him behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken and the fat of rams amen so obedience is better than sacrifice amen hallelujah samuel said rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry samuel said because thou has rejected the word of the lord god has rejected thee from being king my so don't have a stubborn heart a rebellious heart amen don't have a stubborn heart this morning amen so god rejected saul and god is looking for another king hallelujah glory so in acts 13 paul says i have found david the son of jesse a man after my own heart and he will do all my will praise god amen so a man after god's own heart will do god's will can we say amen can we say amen it does not matter what the world thinks about him it's what god thinks about him oh glory to god hallelujah thank you jesus praise god so god chose david to be king a man after his own heart glory notice it was not that david was sinless david did many unpleasant things it was not that david never made mistakes or had false no he had many thoughts are you sure it was david that was the man after god's own heart you mean the man that committed adultery and staged the murder of the woman's husband david are you sure is that the man after god's own heart that man uriah was david's most faithful soldier he set him up at the front of the battle to die david you mean god chose david how many times you look at your own self and you say me lord what did you see in me lord sometimes you don't even like your own self you see your failures you see your mystics you see this and that but lord what is it that you saw in me that you bypass one million other people and chose me this morning you are one in a million this morning you are one in a million hallelujah praise god amen and let me say it this way one million other persons were lost when god saved you give him praise give him praise this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he saw you he chose you he loved you he elected you by predestination he put your name on the book give him praise hallelujah he saw the sins that you were going to commit and he prayed for them with his blood the passings the presence the future since he has already paid for them with his blood can you give him praise this morning can you give him praise this morning hallelujah hallelujah glory [Applause] now many people will look at your faults and say devil child you will look at your own flesh and condemn yourself but this morning what does god see in your heart is there a genuine seed of god on the inside of your heart if so then that's the real believer praise god and you got to know that by divine revelation this morning give the lord a hand of praise amen that's the real believer the seed in your soul amen glory to god amen amen amen amen so let's look at david what did god see in david after david sinned he repented david had a repentant heart in psalms 51 have mercy upon me o god according to thy loving kindness according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions hallelujah you see his attitude amen wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions he is confessing to the lord hallelujah amen perch me with hyssop wash me and i shall be whiter than snow oh created me a clean heart oh god renew the right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me hallelujah praise god amen hallelujah this morning restore unto me the joy of my salvation give him a hand of praise hallelujah hallelujah david had a repentant heart glory to glory amen what are the sacrifices of god the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart god will not despise and contrite means remorseful repentant sorrowful amen that is the kind of heart that david had a contrite heart a repentant heart that is the kind of heart that god is looking for amen and the songwriter said brokenness is what i long for brokenness is what i need we need brokenness this morning hallelujah oh break me and melt me lord hallelujah is that how you feel this morning is that how we feel this morning don't look around anyone else today we are looking at our own hearts yes lord amen praise god amen yes lord amen break me lord amen take me down to the potter's wheel praise god amen yes lord amen david was a man after god's own heart give the lord a hand of praise hallelujah hallelujah glory to god another quality of david he was merciful and saul became very jealous of david after a while and he hunted him to kill him saul's hatred for david increased greatly david had to hide from saul to stay alive and one time saul took three thousand men in pursuit after david and they came very close to where david was hiding during the night when saul and his men were asleep david and abishai sneaked into saul's camp and found saul abishai wanted to kill saul right there and then but david stopped him david showed mercy to the man who wanted to take his head hallelujah david respected saul as god's anointed even though he himself was already anointed by samuel to be the king my amen hallelujah he showed mercy and david took soil superior and water jug that were right by his head and left the camp and later on he called out to saul who then realized that david could have killed him oh my my my my but david showed mercy can we say amen can we say amen and in matthew 5 7 blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy oh glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what about you have you ever been in a position to take revenge on someone who has done you a lot of wicked things what did you do did you show mercy or did you serve justice what is in your heart brother i'm so glad that all god is merciful aren't you glad this morning that god is merciful hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yes lord amen mercy is when god does not give us what we deserve we deserve to go to hell but abraham said adam pinned that on us that we deserve to go to hell because we were born in sin and shaped in iniquity none of us righteous can we say amen from another message he said when man sinned he separated himself from god he was across the chasm from god with no way back but god rich and mercy hallelujah and wonderful in grace made a way back can we say amen this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hey amen glory to god amen listen question what is the difference between mercy and grace hallelujah mercy is when god does not give us the judgment we deserve amen you sin you should die the wages of sin is death but god says no mercy says no i'm not gonna let you go i'm not gonna let you slip away you don't have to be afraid hallelujah mercy said no praise god sin will never take control thank you jesus but mercy said no give the lord a hand of praise this morning thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh praise god amen so mercy is when god does not give us the judgment we deserve but grace what is grace grace is when god gives us what we do not deserve my so you sin you should die mercy said no but grace says i forgive you now you are my son now you are my bride all that i have is yours hallelujah you are god of the earth i will restore you right back to eden give him praise hallelujah i am going to perfect you praise him hallelujah glory to god amen you shall be an overcomer you are my trophy praise god i give you my righteousness i give you my righteousness hallelujah you are now the sinless bride of jesus christ hallelujah glory to god amen hallelujah you are a man after my own heart take that devil praise god somebody give the lord a shout take that devil hallelujah thank god for the grace of god this morning amen hallelujah glory mercy and grace no wonder david said i will sing of the mercies of the lord forever hallelujah he said great i like tender mercies towards me o lord hallelujah praise god praise god praise god amen amen amen glory thank you jesus amen still on david what was in his heart that god loved about him in spite of all his feelings and sins and david had a hunger and passion for god that drove him it was unparalleled god saw the passion in his heart in psalm 63 david wrote this psalm while being in the wilderness running and hiding from saul it was praises from the wilderness it was praises from a dry place it was praises from a place of trying he was at his lowest moment and he still praise god can we say amen this morning hallelujah hallelujah oh god thou what my god only will i seek thee my soul first step for thee my flesh longed for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is he was actually in a wilderness place at that time amen my shoulders stepped for me my shoulder said to see thy power and thy glory how many want to see the power of god this morning how many want to see his glory are you thirsting for god this morning amen oh my soul chester to see thy power and glory because thy loving kindness is better than life itself oh glory to god my lip shall praise thee thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name o glory to god is that how you feel this morning i wish somebody would forget about himself and just give god praise give god praise this morning forget about yourself and give god praise hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh give him praise give him praise give him praise hallelujah glory to god david said when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on the in the night watches so while he was looking out for saul he was meditating on the lord oh god fill me oh god seal me oh god deliver me hallelujah i'm looking for saul but lord fill me with your holy spirit oh i love you lord i'm hungering for you lord i thirst for you lord i seek your face oh god hallelujah is that how you feel this morning somebody shout unto the lord this morning somebody give him praise hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen amen amen psalms 42 as the heart punching off the water brooks so my soul punched it after the oh god my soul this church for god for the living god is that how you feel about god this morning hallelujah hallelujah my so don't just come to church young people amen get a passion for the things of god can we say amen amen begin to hunger for holiness for righteousness for a heart of love amen and from thinking man's filter abraham says in you was that predestinated seed down in you that makes you hunger for god can we say amen hallelujah so it's not you that that's hungering for god per se is that predestinated seed in you crying out from deep down inside hallelujah can we say man and where there's a jeep on the inside is it deep to respond to that call praise god amen oh hallelujah oh brother sister cry out cry out cry out this morning praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen don't be a church member you have a seed in you cry out with all your heart say amen this morning hallelujah can i say something that will sting a little bit amen i have the go ahead amen from the message stand still but ibrahim said you say i belong to church but that has nothing to do with it he said hell is made up of church members my let me say that one more time you say i belong to church that has nothing to do with it hell is made up of church members my so we are not striving to come all these miles all these years to become a good church member no no no amen he said that's not good enough that has nothing to do with it can we say amen can we say amen got to know by revelation and by experience that there is a seed inside your soul that is hungering and thirsting after god amen hallelujah no wonder jesus said blessed are they that hunger and things after righteousness because they shall be filled say that this morning shall be one more time shall be filled give the lord a hand of praise o praise the name of the lord you're going to be filled with the holy ghost that seed in you will push forth to life born again by the spirit of god hallelujah hallelujah can we say amen can we say amen praise god hallelujah glory yes lord so i introduce that background to show you that this whole christian experience is not only about how much you know knowledge and again i'm not trying to play down the significance of godly knowledge but i want to underscore the necessity for a heartfelt life it has more to do with your heart and the condition of your heart than we think can we say amen and this is a simple message but the burden that god placed upon me is to tell you the kind of heart that god is looking for is a heart of love can we say amen a heart of love amen glory and all the qualities that david had that made him a man after god's own heart every one of them came from a heart of love for god amen repentant and merciful and passionate trusting humble faithful and many more all tied to his love for god the love that he had in his heart for god amen and we are called to have a heart of love amen love for god enough his people can we say amen this morning yes lord amen glory so let's move on what is god who is god we can't begin to come comprehend who god is but a bible being god in print form the word of god is god the bible said first john 4 he that love it not knowing that god for god is love is that right god is love amen if our message brahman said love is the most perfect thing there is in the bible and god is love they that love are of god can we say amen glory to god amen from hebrews chapter 2 problem says now god was in the beginning before there was any light before there was ever an atom of style any visible thing god filled all space and in that space was nothing but purity pure love pure holiness pure righteousness it was spirit amen hallelujah and god is a very essence of love his spirit covers all the solar system from eternity to eternity all love all power godly love agapo he's the fountain of all that hallelujah amen amen he's the fountain of love this morning amen glory and men of all ages have tried to explain this great love of god it is fathomless as the skies brother branham says there is no way to ever try to explain the depths of the love of god hallelujah for god is loving man his very being his love amen seven perfect spirits can we say amen this morning glory to god god's love is divine love agape love amen and hebrews chapter four amen brahma explained that there are four levels of love amen first is perfect love that's god's love pure and adulterated divine love amen praise god number two then there is fill your love amen which is earthly that's the love for your family but it has some perversion in it my number three then lustful love it has more perversion in it then number four there's filthy love it keeps on getting more perverted but by the look baba said god's love agapo is million miles higher praise god every love outside of agapo is perverted love which has an end a couple of has no big beginning and it will never have an end can we say amen praise god hallelujah glory to god amen thank you jesus so in the garden sin perverted the pure love that adam shared with his family and with god in the beginning sin brought lust and fear and hatred and murder my in other words the heart of love in eden pure gentle divine soft passionate for god tender hearted that kind of heart it changed it became a heart of stone perverted carnal hateful fearful my my my amen my my amen glory to god glory to god jeremiah 17 the heart is now deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it my my my my no one of the songwriters said what can be done with this whole heart of mine please soften it up praise god where the holy ghost and fire hallelujah hallelujah oh praise god that old heart praise god but in ezekiel 36 we have promised a new heart a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh a heart of love oh glory to god amen and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes hallelujah if you love me keep my commandment o praise god hallelujah glory to god glory to god glory to god amen the holy ghost will be your control tower right in the middle of your heart tied by chains of love you become a prisoner of love only doing god's will your heart becomes the throne of god can we say amen can we say amen a place for god to live praise god amen glory so our whole christian experience is a journey back to god back to love because god is love can we say amen can we say amen amen back to perfect love divine love pure love agape love back to a heart of love give the lord a hand of praise this morning glory so love is key love is the objective paul emphasizes to the church how we must get back to love make no mistake about it don't fool yourself from divine love but abraham said no matter how much we try to bluff we are negative without love can we say amen amen and first corinthians 13 though i speak with the tongues of men and angels and have no charity i'm nothing i've missed the mark completely praise god my god my god he said though i prophesy and understand all mysteries and knowledge i am nothing without love my god he said though i have faith to move mountains and have no love i am still nothing praise god my god my god he's trying to show the importance of love to the church amen my and some people feel that charity means feeding the poor but paul says though i give all my goods to feed the poor i am still nothing without charity my he said do i give my body to be burned and have not charity i am still nothing it will profit nothing whatsoever my so charity is not just feeding the poor some people say man this charity here is divine love the love of god can we say amen praise god hallelujah amen and first corinthians 14 follow after charity we must get it somebody say must get it must get it praise god hallelujah the love of god amen that's the love of god even christ amen love love amen the perfect love of god and colossians chapter 3 says above all these things put on charity hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how many one charity how many won that promise praise god we must have it we must have it amen glory glory glory glory glory give the lord a hand of praise we must have it we must have it we need it we want it praise god amen hallelujah hallelujah this feel your love that we have is nice but it could fail us we love and love until somebody does do something wrong and then we don't love anymore we love our family and our friends alone ma you love people in your churches you love people in your church more than people in another church he said that's perverted love can somebody say amen this morning oh my god my god my god hallelujah praise god he said that is failure and it cannot work praise god ah hallelujah so fill your love cannot work we need charity this morning we need the charity praise god hallelujah the love of god hallelujah hallelujah when the people crucify jesus enemy or friend it did not matter he said father forgive them and when you fail and do things you should not do he says i forgive you i love you no less go and sin no more hallelujah and he wraps his arms of love around you he loves you with an everlasting love somebody praise him this morning somebody praise him somebody praise him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god thank you jesus oh glory to god [Applause] so choose love over hate choose to love love is the most powerful force there is love will conquer anything every enemy praise god love will endure forever when everything else fails love will still be there can we say amen hallelujah hallelujah glory how will they know that you are christians how john chapter 13 by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another give the lord a hand of praise give the lord a hand to praise amen love one to another amen so we have to treat each other right with love show kindness colossians three husbands love your wives titus too let the older women teach the younger sisters to love their husbands and to love their children amen can we say amen praise god amen so the older sisters have some work to do amen to teach the younger ones to love their husband brother smiling amen but he also say husbands love your wives amen sister smiling now amen glory so come on love is the key say amen love is the key amen hallelujah glory even the gifts of the church brother branham said perfect love brings perfect gifts he says so work first with love and then that brings fellowship and then fellowship brings gifts can we say amen hallelujah hallelujah come on now he said one time i'd rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with christ i'd rather have that then every spiritual gift operated in the church he was trying to show how important love is among the people amen a heart of love for god and his people thank you praise god he said you can have every gift and still be lost again he said i'd rather have that experience of love than all the gifts that god has in heaven my but paul kept talking about something that was perfect to come when that perfect thing comes brother everything else will fade away amen first corinthians 13 amen can we say amen so talking about a heart of love give the lord a heart of prayer a familiar story from urbana we remember the story of brother branham leaving his plane and just walking until he met the old shana mike type woman she said the lord gave my husband and i a lovely boy and i promised the lord i'd raised my baby for him but he took the wrong road a few years ago and now he has a venereal disease and

she said person can we pray and that old saint knelt down and raised up our hands and pulled out her heart to god but i'm saying i never heard such a prayer in my life my said i when i heard her pray he said i held the little iron pulse of the bed and cried like a baby to see the outpouring of love it moved the prophet to see your mother's love praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

enemies to god a pure heart blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god hallelujah matthew 5 can we say amen can we say amen i can't even say man praise god amen glory love your enemies but about him another story you remember the story of the prophet with a maniac man killing preachers in oregon a 300-pound man out of this insane institution about six feet two there were over five thousand people in the audience about 300 preachers on the platform the man ran up the platform shouted you hypocrite you snake in the grass i'll show you how much man of god you are i'll break every bone in your body but abraham was a small man he said when that happened you could hear a pin drop in the audience hundreds of sick people were there he said i'm kept on speaking then a man rushed up to the to brother branham on the pulpit and spit in his face my and you know what happened the holy spirit came down and said he will fall over my feet and he did but from the message god provided a lamb he explained it a little differently brabham said what was it did i hate the man he said no i love him a poor mortal in that condition that was not the man speaking that was the devil the devil made a challenge and the holy spirit challenged him back glory to god amen praise god all fear was gone love cast away all fear but you cannot bluff it you have to have it you cannot bluff love amen so we need it we must have it we have to add it praise god amen but abraham said the power of hatred and the power of love met together but love will overcome hatred every time give the lord a hand of praise praise god but abraham said make me real i don't want to impersonate it i want something real god give it to me give me a reality this morning lord i need it lord give it to me praise god amen

part of his life he was in the image and likeness of god can we say amen hallelujah so adam had the love of god this is i'm seeing this it's not part of the quote so adam had the love of god amen the fellowship and harmony with god glory adam had dominion over every creature and over all the earth can we say amen genesis 1 glory there was perfect love he had not only the authority but the power to control glory to god amen he ruled it well he ruled it with love hallelujah oh glory to god and i believe the animals felt the love he ruled with love the earth felt the love the plants the animals

praise god amen and the creation love this ruler my the man that ruled with love before the fall glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen it's not a quote but i'm trying to stick with what the bible said amen glory amen then sin came the true ownership of the earth never really changed because god still had it but the rulership the leadership change satan became the god of this world no wonder when satan temporarily took over and sin stepped in perfect love was gone the animals became fierce the leaves began to fall storms raged over the earth hallelujah hallelujah and praise god i i had prepared this message since march 14th i was supposed to speak and i didn't know anything about wednesday night service amen all the quotes about the love and so on praise god so it
