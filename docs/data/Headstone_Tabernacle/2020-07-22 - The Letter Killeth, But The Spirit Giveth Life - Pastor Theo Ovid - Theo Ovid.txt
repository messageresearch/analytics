here tonight breathe upon your word speak to our hearts tonight and Lord me life come out of your word God obey you bless the hearers of the word those that are listening and connected us on the Internet may your visit them also with your presence in their home in just a minute god bless you if every Bibles we have one scripture to reach a knight from second Corinthians chapter three wanna read from verse 1 to eat I'm good to see all of your tier tonight even though the weather is how it is but we still present we first one of second Corinthians chapter 3 do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you Yayoi Bissell written in our hearts known on read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart and such trusts have we through Christ to God would not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also had made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death written and engraven stones was glorious so that the chair of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious may God bless his word you may be seated it's a powerful Scripture Amen you may be seated and I I enter it tonight and our title the letter killeth but the Spirit give it life Oh praise what letter kill it but the Spirit give it life first corinthians 2:4 paul's at my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power first Corinthians 2/5 continue and he said that your feet the purpose of that should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God what was behind him what was motivating him what was active with him isn't that something else ok if God told Moses take off your shoes you're on holy ground Moses said that's too much trouble I'll take off my hat I got unleased my shoes would have been would it have been just as good no sir God would have never spoke to him until he took off his shoes it's big never spoke to him until he took off his shoes but Abraham knock on his pulpit four times and God will never speak to the church till it comes back to the Articles and principles that Krait lists lead them and it is not dominated by some emotional or some denomination to pull it this way and that way they will still have to come back to believe in miracles believing in science they will have to come back to believe in miracles believing in science believing in the Holy Ghost build baptised in the name of Jesus Christ all these things they have to come back to that or God won't speak to them or glory to God you mean back to the signs and wonders America's yes now the gospel is not altogether the word or this is the Word of God and all thing must be based upon the word isn't it true he said jesus said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature now he did not say teach the world no this is where we head in tonight he did not say teach the word he said preach the gospel so the gospel consists more than teaching the word I wanted to soak in tonight the gospel consists more than teaching the world remember jesus said nation shall rise against nation Kingdom against Kingdom earthquakes pestilence and the Gospel as we preach and then shall the income not gospel taught gospel preached and then shall the income so all the teaching have to come to preach him in other words the teaching going to produce the seed the preached and produced the rain the water to manifest the very seed that the teachers have taught so every position have a role and a function the posture to hold the church a teacher teaching ministries evangelists to get the fire up on the people the Atmos everyone have a part to play that's why the fight for ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints in my name and we believe that so the gospel is consist more than teaching the word for Paul confirming that says the gospel came to us not in word only but true power which is demonstrations of the Holy Spirit would come and demonstrate the gospel to bring the word to a living reality Oh glory to God live in reality shout out live in reality so if you receive the word by knowing the word that doesn't do you any good because they letter kill it but the Spirit give it life then you must be born again and then the Holy Spirit quickens the word to you in other words like a grain of corn it's leaning in my hand just a green a corn it will never do nothing else but bury it it comes contaminated moles then it bring up another green a conscience like yet yes sir we need every stepladder the building is still in make him and when it's completed here we go the gospel is to be preached to every kindred tongue and nation when then Jesus returned Oh glory to God you mean all of this pyramid building was the billet until I become completed don't make it get the full gospel Oh hallelujah praise God isn't that right he said now watch we have had plenty passes on trucks and theology around the world but the gospel is not the Bible all together all said the gospel came to us not in word only but true power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost so then when Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature then he meant this is the interpretation now to go into all the world and demonstrate the power of God to every creature hallelujah praise God do you understand what the gospel really is now to demonstrate the power of God to every creature doesn't that remind you of something what happened in gadna Eden when God put man in His image likeness have power over every creature that is bringing back the gospel so Adam had the gospel back there Oh glory to God and we coming back to that same gospel that original gospel when Wareham get access to the book he demonstrated the power from that book and that book is only earth the angel is on you know with the book or glory to God nor watch in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a gospel preached you have got to have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel so it is not a ritualistic of fear it is absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ living among men and that's the faith that I'm trying my best to contend for today this is William Marion banner or glory record he was seeing it and he was seeing what he had to fight for he was fighting to see that original gospel come back Oh hallelujah let me say it again it's not just a ritualistic of fear it is absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ living among them and that's the fate that I'm trying my best to contend for today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever his power is unlimited [Applause] allelujah file it will fool around with unlimited power Pilate will stop unlimited power his power is unlimited that means to and walk the blank and see the difficulty rivers can be cast out whatever condition it is and missing limbs can be restored this power is unlimited every gift could be back in the church within five minutes with the power of God back in the church I talk about tongues interpretations the wisdom differ fate gif of healing miracles all the same and every give back in the church Oh glory to God what is it another book of Acts he essays Alpha and Omega just recent I'm saying that he's alpha he's Omega what he manifests in the Alpha he has to manifest sin Omega I want nothing less than that I don't want to try that Church I'm not taking that I have come on for that this is not my mess this is my message here or give the Lord a shout hallelujah praise God I'll preach till I see it I'll fight for it praise God in that delicious was a super Church nothing but stop them Oh glory to God nothing could stop that church I never asked this is a prophecy this last day breath will be a super Church or super race who said that not even the Prophet said that his God pelham pick up his pen and write that Old Glory is written and so shall it be Oh glory to God as the near a headstone a super church a super anointed a super power a super strength or glory to God Samson was ordinary but when an anointed come upon him he was not ordinary or glory to God hallelujah and when the anointed come up on David they were not ordinary is something come upon him something has to come upon you or glory no God but this time is not just flesh and blood is the word image inside of you or give the Lord a shout if you can limit God you can limit Christ if you limit the church today in its possibilities you are limited in God but all things whatsoever you desire when you pray believe but to receive it and you shall have it he said I believe and I know it's true sir Oh glory to God thank you Jesus Holly Elijah was a perfect type of the church on Christ Elijah being the type of Christ and when he was about to leave before leaving oh he made preparation that the Spirit of God must remain on the earth God takes his man never his spirit God took Christ but the Holy Spirit is here tonight vindicating him just as similar Jesus he tokenized her but it came upon Elijah come upon John the Baptist same spirit making Lysa act like he likes her made John the Baptist act like Elijah it's with the church today act like Christ because the same spirit coming back upon the church Oh glory to God hallelujah the devil takes a spirit or his man but never in spirit so that way they cast up crane the cast of evil because the evil man dead I'm going to hang him they kill him or whatever it is the barium but the anointing of upon him fallen upon somebody else and if the devil could drop his anointing on somebody else the Spirit of God could fall on you because when Jesus died the ghost of Jesus which is the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost is what is promised to come upon you the spirit of a man a perfect man or glory to God Jesus man hallelujah his spirit is what his promise to come upon you do you believe that Alleluia so them same teachers who the devil takes is the man but never his spirit damn shame teachers bacteria that condemn Jesus Christ they were scholars to the minute they were far beyond our seminary students today in the width they were holy men no one could put a hand on them they had to be holy they had to be righteous they had to be blameless but yet powered by sitter does the title 1/2 of this section powered by Seaton yet man behind it pulpit man preaching word but powered by Sita didn't recognize the Son of God and they condemned and killed him that's right and that spirit lives on today people who are just as fundamental just as scholarly and pita as they can be having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof watch them how to deny the power thereof or glory to God hallelujah the ninety-nine mysteries the 1990 history there not be 90 prophecies but denying the power the power and that is what you come for that is what Judas couldn't access because Pentecost is what caught you deserve Oh glory he was under temporary power in Matthew 10 but he couldn't get permanent power in the upper room Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said from such turn away brother they know the word so perfect just set it in order lead OD in such a masterpiece yet know no more about God than a Hottentot with normal a Egyptian night that is right the owning of the word but the letter kill it but the spirit give it life its life comes by the word made manifest not Potiphar's manifests the word manifested produces life that's what we are striving for to see the word made manifest when this invisible cord becomes visible when does that happen when the word becomes flesh go into all the world and manifest the power to all nations mark 16 preach the gospel on how what did burns about the true church he says Satan or shortly that the true church is what mark 16 in action mark 16 the text that's why you label it so mark 16 in action not read in mark 16 as a text and explain in that but mark 16 made manifest Oh glory to God are you Whitney watch mark 16 preach the gospel not teach the world no I'm not getting teaching I just given the emphasis of where we go in like we said Sunday or the car nice bumper nice lights but the cast at so if you have an engine rumbling aha body is that the engine revving revving River beyond okay yeah nobody yeah no door no seat you need both together you need a mechanic I'm the dynamic you need the seed and the water you need to see the rain you need to see the fat you need all of it did you get what I'm saying now so I'm not not hitting teaching I'm not hitting mysteries I'm not hittin I am bringing the emphasis he said with emphasis too much on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics we had 50 plus years of emphasis on mechanics bringing clarity of the prophecy that the Prophet brought the revelation of these things being made known or glory to God nor we have to manifest the things that have been made known or could we give the Lord a shout let me say it again now we have to manifest the things that have been nominal I don't want to say now looking for the press the press is a manifestation that's unsafe inside the press coming down guys daily devil business he looking for the anointing to do his thing what I supposed to be looking for if he come along that's all wrong the church like the surrounding Jerusalem yeah and the only way out would be up and then he will make war with the foolish virgins so if he's running the church and surrounding the message world like he seroma in Jerusalem like an ADIZ at Titus and fellas what are we supposed to look for he said when you see Jerusalem compassed with my armies free to the mountain hallelujah isn't that right and the army surrounded Jerusalem además know where they could get out but then somebody died back in Rome and had to pull back the army and the true believers well they pull back so they run to the mountain or glory to God where we see I pull back right now we see I'd ride on right now we see people in the corner right now and when they start a pullback so we seen a mountain we see a monk pyramid we've seen dynamics we see in power we've seen the Holy Spirit we see in charity the price absolute we see what we were born for what we're razor for and nobody could take it from us what we go on to be in that scripture I think it's just right a team when the whole when the ministers get rebuked how long and you will be slack to go on possess your land we don't want to be in that scripture we want to say no guess or get me my mountain or glory to God all these gears are with him at this hour know that y'all has come I want my mountain my fear be Clare I could possess adoption I could possess perfection I could possess miracles and signs and wonders well glory to God man hallelujah but the vehicle me declares that Oh blow it up God what does your fee be K this morning tonight gospel is not true teaching the word it's the word mean manifests these signs shall follow them that believe they shall cast out devils heal the sick great signs and wonders you see it there it is the gospel made manifest lo I am with you always to the end of the world hallelujah and wherever the tools and the trees I gather in my name I'll be in their myths and the things does this sound good to you tonight and the things that I do shall you do also even more than this for I go to my father or this is wonderful oh praise God so people today you say we're going to India now was told by the authorities some greeting Authority some India don't come over saying we are missionaries we got all your trucks I know all about it and you do he said they had religion before America is even formed they have Jesus Christ said what we want yet is in the instil in them what we want is somebody who can make the word manifest but finally what if that Jam now administers all around the world we want somebody who could make the word manifest not talk I wonder if everybody would just close the lips together we want somebody who can make the word manifest and that's what we want to see it somebody who can make the word to be alive Oh God so the word manifest is what we need to do so the gospel is not going out and teaching the Bible that isn't the gospel it is written in the scriptures that the gospel didn't come just true or only but to the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit so I'm afraid if if God turn Epona where the gospel are to step forward no you have to be under expectation for the demonstration the confirmation the manifestation of the power and the Spirit of God that means sick after the heal that means Blaine have to see do you see what I'm going deaf have to hear Oh Dom have to speak crippled have to walk and come out the wheelchair am I talking something strange tonight or is this the gospel he's a God of miracles he's our core of power he's a God of night you have to come back to believe every promise that he has made Oh glory to God no weapon form again she will not prosper also you have to believe that these signs shall follow them that believe you have to believe that you have to believe your name is on the book you have to believe that you have to believe you have before known of God raise you up for this purpose that's how I believe it all right hallelujah now a seed on the pulpit he has a seed until it dies and become Jimmy ties would here has to be made manifest in order to be the gospel I'm not taking my time but this is what I get tonight to drop into the socket of your heart let me see it again whoa this is good tonight the gospel that's the word isn't I write a hallelujah but the letter killeth he said the Spirit give it life no mercy lay in here just a seed even the first in order to be the gospel even thus shall it be in the date when the Son of Man is revealed once you say Salomon you see ensure Solomon come to what the soap it's also what seed after Solomon ministry in the Bible what came next son of God hallelujah so son of blood follows son of men let me say it again not me Solomon sub Solomon more son of man's know like I go have a subunit a sub C you a sub Solomon a mini Solomon a small vision of this element you don't have that sorry so all I'm Solomon's and mini-settlements and putting this other man and son on my comeback and Salman me for them all according to this revelation here that we

because he has to come in resurrection ministry private ministry no not public not public private ministry and open the scriptures to them break the seeds of the Old Testament openly understanding that he could catch fit know of all these precious promises that you're gonna receive so it was clean and clear in the in the Bible here comes son a man again cantaloupe something today what did he bring seeds prophecies hallelujah let's continue so do you understand now then after seed son of man weird ministry must be spirit ministry discover already talking about the ministration of the Spirit would be so glorious Oh hallelujah the ministration of the Spirit we have began to see that just yet Oh glory to God it would be glorious the earth itself wouldn't be able to hold the anointing it would be so powerful it's gone only lasted 30 40 days when that resurrection annoyed I began to strike the earth cap all it and then the bright ability cannot or glory to God hallelujah that too had to follow you cannot believe that to her when them fellas getting the presidency fall as one dead became is suddenly anointed when that vision broke upon Burmingham he was packed in a kadhai he see was numb for days he said you know the blessings but you don't know the power Oh glory to God you know blessings but you don't know but boy is that's a different realm all together Isaiah when he hit that temple and he saw the trail high and lifted up and them saris flying back on 40 will always be a Montana man of unclean lips I could see Isaiah stacking inside a deer Oh hallelujah cleanse my lips hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God that's when man get in the presence they become nothing all a big self mess itself past herself apostles serve all kind of self at Ithaca side ho glory

crucified mumble send them onto the grinder and grind him right through until he becomes a hoe until she become God's voice God's hands God's feet God's eyes of course at Shangri believe that tonight nothing less than that Oh could you take some more course you take some more that's why you here tonight hallelujah to get some seeds for your soul this is very important and it is lined up with what which on Sunday discontinued Jana all right so what something you know now in the beginning was the word and the word was was God no dependent upon the what the word was the word was the expression of a thought it has to be a thought before it can be a word so God in the beginning give the thought of what it would be the word for it and we received the word and it produces what God taught it was then he says this the word is the gospel in seed form that was seen again he said they thought spoke by the word Underwood is a seed and then he come to bring this emphasis the word is the gospel in seed form so as long as we teach in sharing explaining we are no way no to the gospel we are reaching yet you hear me sing I waited 40 plus years Tech preach the gospel so your Torah was musing arroway's Imam I keep telling you God called me to preach the gospel that we call me to do and I guess that it yet that's why talking about I see in this 40 years now just this I have to get to this is a geniune to get that this Jesus at 18 years seeing them miss cotton miss locatin dislocated misinterpreted scriptures 18 years of silence Here I am quoting scriptures tithing that not all the time explain anything that they do not bring about and he had to wait till the appointed time when his thank him he came and get baptized get fire fall on him fullness of the gospel the Godhead brought in him bodily and that spirit let him not deem on you no no Satan a similar Suncor name you know the spirit itself let him into the wilderness to do something for us to show us the power of the written word as a seed it is written it is written it is also written and then G returned in the power of the Spirit finest scriptures he came back to the word to get back to his seed know the spirit is appalling that's wood that's letter for he has anointed that is still wood that is the letter to open the eyes of the blind that the script is written that is still on the print but when he said this day this scripture is fulfilled he is saying the life of that letter is here now to manifest what is written or glory to God hallelujah praise God he said this scripture is fulfilling the hearing of your ears you do I stood here and don't believe it you will see it manifested what you're here you're going to see it manifested or get the Lord a shout and what people have been hearing all these years as a prophecies they're going to see it with their money I manifested I've heard by the hearing of the ear but no my eyes will see Oh glory to God is not here and here and here and even people going to recognize and act upon it and it will be manifested I feel the anointing here tonight Oh glory to God Jesus before he said it look at his career ed he's here the Spirit is upon me Oh glory to God he wasn't coming with that letter he had the spirit upon him his Spirit is upon me because he has anointed me or glory that blood you have to be anointed or caught the fulfill the world you have to be anointed to connect with the spirit of prophecy that lead inside that word he had to be anointed or does Jesus anointed by God this bride will be anointed hallelujah the anointing will be upon Mount Zion the anointing will be upon the bride the glory gonna be upon this ride or glory of God under the ministration of the Spirit and if the ministration of the way it was glorious how much more the ministration of the Spirit is administration of death or glory God let her kill him who must render spirit come this Rick must come there's a prophecy where to come revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride wanna sneak home or give the Lord a shock not looter not Wesley but spirit itself hello IAM or glory dog or seven perfect spirit the rainbow to anoint a bride to reproduce Jesus Christ or give the Lord a shout do you see it tonight this is what we fighting for this is what we pressing for Christ repetition in the brave that will be the seed again coming to life so dear for but a Branham Alistair bring the seed of the entire Bible but a Branham that was son of man ministry to bring the seed of the entire Bible by gathering all the loose ends and turn it back into the word to come back to the original full wood body seed to be placed into a bride then after that she was planted in a drag the devil's have do nothing because know that wood is no longer in quads amount that word is knowing you then you what's a new keratin point because the power of the world is let every seed bring forth after its gain now in Genesis the seed was in the ground and a word had was to be spoken let there be light because the seed was always a seed but it needed light and it was under darkness but when God said let there be light that itself was a seed and when the world become manifest and there was light and when that light hit them seasoned the ground every seed bring forth after its kind and the profits soared a perfect man seed or glory to God laugh that mocked that but every seed but before after it's time there's gonna be a living faith what's that word living living virtue living knowledge living temperance living patients live in colonists live in brotherly kindness or glory to God God's own life then you have in you living mysteries [Applause] boys who the mystery grace is the mystery of God oh so the grid is the gospel seed form she went on deeper you see if you ask me but Branham in your country that a country a country would you give me a country I could give you a corn you have a country potentially but it's in the seed fool you can't see you have absolutely got a tree until the seed has produced a tree and that is the problem today people claim in all kind of things that they do already have so we're not talking about seed we're not talking about potential we're talking about the fruit that is to be produced and that is coming to maturity because seed represent the potential babies in life that is to be unfolded until the life grows up into maturity there is ready to blossom and be a fruit or glory to God so once is the seed form its baby its potential hallelu there's nothing much I could do about it but bury it and let the life unfold no you can't force the life you can't force the leaves you can't force the maturity life itself unfolds it or give the Lord a shout so the mystery of what's in the seed is when the life is unfolded because your daughter is a pumpkin seed or watermelon see that looks similar but when you put it in the ground and the life they kept unfold even though both of them running on vines when the life unfold and the fruit comes forth they said this is a pumpkin and this is the watermelon there's two different things altogether oh I mean the life unfold this is bright this is church member or give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so it is clean it is clear why you could see the mystery is the secret is I'm caught on to write that do Wood is in the bride Oh hallelujah so so potentially it's in seed form but you're you can't see some people want to claim to be adopted now on all kind of thing I don't know power no nothing at all even a devil or don't believe that not only I don't believe it I don't believe that are you go challenger adopted son is over adopted son like that different thing altogether you know like back to evening hallelujah cause I'm adopted son zealand's you know what up see Sansa men will repel a fire in them I'm gonna do great damage you can't lose someone like that and there's old human spirit they just plain terribly do terrible things we seize any world with leaders when man have no character and getting a big position on power how does lead it's just terrible in a yeah it's good counter for that this is perfection I went that much the perfect has come what's put Pat aside so God permit certain things but when perfection have been unfolded got the man is perfection he's supposed to have perfection don't come short of it brethren oh this is not being h passed by they not be not elutriation Wesley is this is a perfection Oh glory to God and Paul said this way I will show you a more excellent way do I speak with the tongues of men and angels after all the mysteries after all the revelations though I speak have all knowledge and understand all mysteries that some all all and I do i charity I'm still nothing hallelujah hallelujah do I have all knowledge and all the books are in nature so she computer hallelujah do I know our mysteries and do our charity nothing and then he he expressed the behavior of this thing called charity yeah look for that a monkey I claiming a charity there's a word another he can spell that you could put this with the people and say I have that and put in your pocket in negative charges suffered long and is kind charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up is not easily provoked beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never is the characteristics there's a behavior that goes with what you call that life Oh hallelujah so a man can't claim you have and you're not seeing that you have to have that and then you could claim whether you want to claim all let's just see see we could just hit the home stretch here oh well preaching the word is the Acorn but making it live is the gospel he promised the Holy Spirit that's the word and receiving the Holy Spirit is making it live manifested and if he promised these blessing by the word then accepting the word and producing what it said is the gospel going all the world and preach the gospel to every creature the very next line is the proof that just teaching the world wouldn't do it he said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils evil spirits speak with new tongues take up serpents it won't harm them no that is the gospel and then Bertram said this I believe that we are living in the day when the Holy Spirit is moving upon the hearts of people regardless of how much criticism how much fanaticism God is under obligation to take that to it out of the Gentiles just as certain as I'm standing on the platform he will do it Oh glory to God hallelujah then let's collect Anna was hoping I'd get this thing that I want to read for you know title it the preaching that kills and this is an extract from a writer called en bomb she's a man who wrote about the power of prayer and way back in the early centuries the West and I wonder I can say it like him so I wanted to read I want to read this for you tonight the preaching that kills the preaching that kills is non-spiritual preaching the ability of the preaching is not from God lower sources then God has given to its energy and stimulant the spirit is not evident in the preacher nor his preacher many kinds of forces may be projected and stimulated by preaching that kills but they are not spiritual forces they may resemble spiritual forces but they are only the shadow the counterfeit life they may seem to have but that the life is magnetized the prison that kills is the letter che plea and orderly it may be but is the letter still the dry husky let the empty ball shall the letter may have the germ of life in it but it has no breath of spring to evoke it winter sees they are as hard as the winter soil as I see as the winters air nor torreón not germinate and by them the letter pigeon has the truth but even divine truth has no life given energy alone it must be energized by the spirit with all of God's forces at its back shoot on quickened by God's Spirit dedenne's as much as more than error shoot on quickl by God's timid dedenne's as much as or more than error it may be the truth with oat mixture for all the spirit its sheet and touch a deadly its shoot error its light darkness the letter preaching is functionless reader mellowed more oil by the spirit there may be tears but the tears cannot run God's machinery tears may be the summer spread on a smoke of an iceberg nothing but surface feelings and earnestness there may be but it is the emotion of the kata and the illnesses of the attorney repression I feel from the kindling of his own spots the eloquent over his own disease earnest in delivering the product of his own brain the professor may usurp the place and imitate the fire of the apostle brains and nerves misses the place and fake the work of God's Spirit but by these forces the letter may glow and sparkle like a illumined X but the glow and sparkle will be as barren of life as this field soon with pills the depth demon element lies back of the woods back of the sermon back of the occasion back of the manor back of the action the great hindrance is the preacher himself say Amen he has not in himself the mighty life Cretan forces there may be no discount on his potted oxy honesty cleanness or innocence but somehow the man the inner man in its secret places have never broken down and surrender to God his inner life is not a great highway for the transmission of God's message God's power somehow self and not God rules in the Holy of Holies somewhere all the unconscious to himself some spiritual nonconductor has touches in a beam as a big one spiritual nonconductor as touches in a beam and the divine current has been arrested his inner being has never felt its thorough spiritual bankruptcy its utter powerlessness he has never learned to cry out with an ethereal cry of self disappear and self helplessness till God's power and God's fire comes man fills purifies and empowers self esteem self ability in some pernicious shape has defamed and violated the temple which should be held secret for God life given preaching cost the preacher much death to self crucifixion to the world the travail of his own soul crucified preaching only can give life crucified preaching can only come from a crucified man or give the Lord some praises all glory to God you love him this light almost finish this is the Prophet he says if you have been called from darkness and the light from death unto life from a formal intellectual conception of Christ are boiling in a spirits watch in your life that it leaves the things of the wool aside and you stand for Christ we got this there's something in you hunger and unmoving like it wasn't Jacob you're rested with the Lord you walk different after that something is different than you you have changed this is one I get to hear no no it has to before it can be done it has to be inspired to you I don't care and he had a big bomb and this is good for all and people who don't want plenty plenty plenty I don't care I could stand here and preach till what here I got fell off off of my shoulders till my shoulders tripped on I was 90 years old and you listen every day until God quickens that to you you're still in the same shape or glory the cover give the Lord a shout on that so it's not just the word the laptop it has to be inspired to you or glory to God hallelujah so he said no he's gone Jacob one after the spirit he order after the flesh what is it Esau and Jacob fighting in the wombs of the mother he said they have been since Luther brought the first Reformation I hope that is simple enough for you to understand it these men if they pick up this and go out with it they can make more sense to it here we go to bring it to a place that you would want I just wanted I just want to lead this seed and hope they make it come to life so brother Branham was saying he just wonder what lay the seed and hope that these men that coming after bring the seeds to life Oh glory to God and he says no there's not he said no he was the light there was no two or three lights or four five different organization there was one right there's not a Methodist Baptist Lutron precision Christ is the light the light is the light and the word manifested is the light of the hour what you mean not just the word know the word manifested is the lighter II or or glory to God rise and shine for the light has come and every data sunlight it's got to be separated and the only one thing separates it is the word manifested so everybody talk and talk and talk and let them talk but they're gonna come would manifested light of the hour or glory Terry's her pride she must be the word manifested to be the bride Co because the Lord a shout thing capri-sun message on that the bride wanna be the word manifested hallelujah glory to God he was the word manifested here on earth but he could not do this as a man if taken the Spirit of God what is a big one Tombo Jesus it take the Spirit of God dwelling in him to quicken these promises to him I hope that we get this really clear Jesus being a man himself the body but it took the spirit in him the Spirit is not me to do it the words he is seen the Spirit is what I've got quicken the promises of Jesus as a man he can pull it on himself the spirit itself to do that whole glory to God and then he said but to the elected God is calling to elected didn't know it he calling of virtuous bride the last ditch a selected lady he said the bride is always part of the bridegroom so the bride will not be a denomination it will have to be the word manifested to be the Bride of Christ say everybody was all much seen some church and a bride I believe this I believe this like foolishness I ain't no bad at all light revolution scenes you have to see you have to become the would manifests it to be the brain and this year faith virtue knowledge temperance patience gone this vertical as long as you would people could fight all the fights and pitch all deep color mysteries that is that is the mysteries there I do because that is the entire Bible did previously Bible you know what do you have here is the written word with mysteries written in it that guy is the machine life form that's why I said if you have these things then you have had seven mysteries that they fought for to bring back does the term does mean that my brethren if you have these things inside of you then you have seven ages you have seven mysteries you have several voices does the tug does mean that all the machines inside of you any identified Irina Saul then he said they were hidden the seals think only think about that know who know Irina San Martin like a llama loot as messengers nobody knew that until the profit came he said they were hidden Lucille's how would they hid white was black was red horse all that that was a seasonal but these were behind devil do know about them they were hit and he WI them he only liked it didn't born he tried to kill them but God hide him hallelujah behind all MCS breakin he hid them messengers and they were the tools that God used the colony licked come come come come come or glory to grow when Luther job justification and hurry the elected the elected came out then he said he called the elected Lutheran's and maker Brazilians then he called the elected resident to make the Pentecostals now we call the elect and he can start to make up a headstone that he could come into it or glory to God so you have to be part of the elected bunch that God call out to make up the headstone to be the magnet right to pull them from the grave or blow in the court because there is going to be a resurrection or give the Lord a shout hallelujah so you can go Philip a letter and more revelations and letter you have to look for the spirit for the Lord is that spirit let's go and where the Lord is where the Spirit is there is Liberty not by name Liberty not not people that care warship Liberty where the Spirit is [Music] my it was the same of the Old Testament Paul being well trained he knew the Scriptures the word you see the Scriptures no matter how well you know them if the Spirit doesn't quicken them then the letter killeth the spirit given life it must be quicken or made alive by the spirit if the screw doesn't live in up the word to you and make it the reality you then the letter is just intellectual that is why I know if if we don't get an atmosphere in his singing and you wish upon the prisoner that's where he's Oh hallelujah see pre-scored and what doesn't show them what not to keep any spirit gets in is very sinister a cheese that doesn't have that it tough the man is more letter going out not because he under letter you know but because this spirit atmosphere is nadya to inspire what he is preaching to the people he could be the best preacher or teacher if the atmosphere is not there is like he we sent time I don't want to waste my time I want to the ocean to be here to know that the word going straight into your spirit and your mind your soul because that is what have life in it jesus said the words that I speak they are spirit and their life or glory napot the very word spoken if God speak tonight you get in spirit and life in your own life Oh glory to God hallelujah Peter wasn't consciously doing this and doing that he came and give witness and Cornelius house while Peter was speaking brought interrupts back because he was speaking seeds he was cause mechanic and the dynamic is over him and as he would come on his mount fire fall on the wood man filled with the Holy Ghost waiting happily bright as you see sick people on what the fire come upon you they were healing Peters shadow lay hands upon the signal noise on your hands not no intellectual thing yet mountain on your hands you know it's dear when you lay hands on is sick so or them demons that a ball is see fire coming on for them don't you want that this is the brighter action you say one a hospital all I'm Devers wait them to get older delicate they waitin together word got a man who talking you know walking and you walk in hospital didn't know who you were when you're bored yeah yes sir didn't know who talkin the same voice that talked to them and it was in the same voices Christ's voice gonna be in a brain I'm seeing all glory to God and to understand business over to his diction we punish him here before we leave and we coming back here you going forward and suffered honeymoon a bi-stable to come back here to be with him Oh glory to God hallelujah but before we leave this we showing Satan that sons have been restored and the book he couldn't access we have access to it he have access denied when he tried to access it he get access denied so he cannot access what we could access and that's why the Angels give a maternity to bring our access rights that's why Gore tell Jon Coulton he said give me the book that same book that was sealed that same book that was sealed he's a gwaan ticket and eat it Oh glory to God because right now it open it open once it opened you could see a name was it open you have accessed it as a sudden nobody could deny you access to that book that's the book that Daniel wanted to understand and you coming to understand the contents of that book because you came back to evening you can back to your promise think about it all this revelation and mysteries history purpose go out have the preeminence as they take us back to even go and reveal himself have the preeminence and take us back to even who's the big thing about that he said that war from Jesus revelation three words would made flesh and that story let the main thing be the main thing hallelujah water baptism and Pope and Rome and Israel all that talk all that filler material at the end of the day is God reveal themselves God how many preeminence has taken us back to Eden because you cannot go back to Eden without the preeminence --is because Eden demands a restored son not a crook not a sinner but us restored son and the blood came for justification as if we never lived in the first place so when God looked on this night he seen us as original sons or give the Lord a shout my God my God justified as if you're never in the first place hallelujah that's why cash out that's why could praise God that's why I was so excited when God look down and then wonder brother said Noah we the sons of God it doctored up here what we shall be but we know when we see him we shall be like him what they took they caught up in it caught up in a revelation of the sonship that he had not be canceled let me finish Moses was taught in the wisdom of the Egyptian he had 40 years of teaching under his mother and he could even teach them masses of Egypt but it taken God another 40 years to get all that beat out of him on the backs of the desert and one day while he was hidden jetrel sheep running from Egypt running from the task that thought he was to go back unless they all go because he tried in himself and having any with out he tries in himself without having any experience the seals of his deliverance and being liver was open up there but all I was intellectual teaching is all right he said by the letter killeth the spirit gave it life and in the presence of the burning bush he knowed more about God in five minutes than he had been taught in 40 years your own teachers this position ecclesia teach it teach it to be needed on so he can say Amen Ninomiya church and all he could see the other my teacher my pastors are my decision I go look at the area lady you can talk about your life you have a booster testimony or like a talk about the manbana pulpit if that is your testimony you have new testimony I question your own testimony very pastor that no whole church messed up think about you know you think what one that we fight that listen listen the reason we end up in this condition is because I'm Nicole Eaton somebody feel they began and somebody and somebody want to take over the churches somebody think there's a little Pope bishop and Archbishop that most bishop Danny best bishop higher bishop and they pull this out right up a delegate Pope because somebody want to be in charge of somebody God never put that like put-put man to have to maneuver creeping things and hold them till any hunting man wasn't supposed over man just what that's why before bottle is power you have to show you up all over yourself I see men say any wrong thing doing up over a tongue and if I was a Magda perfect mantis magna he could bridle his done so without manifestation at least he picked on quiet play a perfect man my man loosen the tongue big argument big carrying on Mac the perfect man he could badly stung so you have to demonstrate power over yourself before God give power over others another thing if somebody understand that what he could clean my look in the deeper corner virus with intellect uneven body middle vibrance all I know he said adopted sons what the backup the Philistines he said then you go see the power of Gordon Demi Phyllis eyes to go to backing up eleventh Iman's coming back then you go back up cancer back up tumor he's not talking about this this Pentecostal kind of thing she can Jesus genuine power even the Pentecostal will be as polished because the world come on the bride's mode you wouldn't have to use Jesus name because you will be who Jesus wife just speaker see walk here hallelujah praise God see just in friendly blind eyes Oh glory to God hallelujah Tomer power demonstrated or glory kept no impersonation to that no impersonation to that he said his past was an anvil like when you when you're cutting iron and spots backing off flying off the manual note and sign off for you every devil in hell see not flying off for you when you walk inside all around you or Chloe the word sire upside down fire all around hallelujah rainbow around the throne because God's throne is in your heart or give the Lord a shout or glory to God when I'm said I wish I could live to see it or chlorine avoid sons of God coming for here's gonna be sons of God not one son's sons of God and that time call me coz vindicated sons and vindicate the daughters I am under great expectation tonight I believe his three people inside yet tonight I was preaching this o because I am quickened to preach this I'm anointed to preach this they'll let her kill it but the spirit giveth life brings God I will return unto you according to the time of life that time is coming for you you can't miss it if you try or give the Lord a shout glory hallelujah glory to God five minutes in the presence of that pillar of fire no more of Gordon five minutes that what had been taught in Egypt for forty years it was an experience listen to this bomb he just didn't have a letter to read it or lost a read or books to read he had an experience if this don't make you shocked I don't know what will or glory to God not tapes to listen to no books to read just an experience and he was equipment ready to go down to tell Pharaoh let my people who what about a bride after sixty years soaking in this word when the anointing comes love fire what you think would happen anointed bride and no I did bit good trying to finish you born from above born again home above when you're born from above then we are active active and things from above for his life is in us which is his word fin the kitchen the wood itself here we go the spirit that's in you is the Word made flesh in you this is big enogh this is not skim milk you know this spirit in you that's right the foolish virgins we could never get the oil they don't have the world in them to turn to spirit so it's not just prayer meetings and praying you have to have the will it in you because the Spirit in you is the world made fresh one of the biggest mysteries Jesus busting in Cyprus we don't talk much about it one of the biggest mysteries he said - ello here do whatever them know here he said the kingdom is within you they couldn't understand that and then the Baron said the kingdom is the word maintaining the power is the flesh-and-blood kingdom is the word in you turn into power and that puts the kingdom resident inside of you Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God when GSA all Paul and her mother's desire to meet he met all power the kingdom was resident he could call for help at any time boy let me finish here because my my my my my the spirit that's in you is the world made flesh in you the spirit minds the word and is active in vindicating the word now the spirit is not active in any denomination it is not interested in making an organization because the spirit itself is contrary to organisation how can you how can the spirit work in an organization when it's the ninth take increase instead of the word it can't do it it is dead God don't go to damn kind of places his group amount to work for him cause they're already dead they are unbelievers in the world or wouldn't be in there no we are active in the things I'm above the spirit Minds the word the spirit gives the word life the Spirit is interested in vindicates in the word that's why he said the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the world because God can only vindicate the word see man want to get vindication they say I am it but court said no I'm not vindicating that I'm particular my word if you have the word in you you'll get the part of the vindication when that confirmation comes but go wonderfully Kiedis would the reason depend depend consulted many manifestations but they didn't have the word so that's why they went and seen at door she what kind of thing like that unknowingly but the Holy Ghost doing all kinds they go I don't want that so he give us 50 plus years to soak him to blend in to add this word to get mature or let's put it this way to get your feet right that's what this was all about to get your feet right to break into this season Oh hallelujah let's continue Oh save it last me musicians he was the first son of God to comfort the full maturity to be in God for my Jesus Christ he was plucked from the earth and wave over the people what a glorious lesson by the quickman power the first one he had been tight but this was the first fruit of them that slept so when Jesus rose from the dead he was the first fruit of them that slept isn't that right and the first fruit must be with hallelujah so what he was wave over the promised seed that had the promise of life he was waved at the day of Pentecost people don't want us to go back there but we have to because that's where he was with when their common song from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and was wave over the people at Pentecost waiting for the blessing and is to be waived again we realize in the last day according to Luke 1730 in the day that the Son of Man will be revealed or waved over the people this is the cap of all what I'm preaching tonight what I'm about to read here you cannot miss this one he said who is the son of man but a mission in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us now if all the teaching that we have by the confirmation of the world by signs and wonders no Luke something to hear we all agree with that Scripture that the word again is wave over the people so for 50 years what was wave over you the word by these promises so all these promises I don't know what other churches I don't want you it's the words of the Son of Man was we've 50s every time we preach on me people I promise it's being weaved over you all right watch what the word is weaved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is the life again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit what do we said earlier after son of man is son of God lookit right here the Son of Man is to be wave again and what that river will produce is we produce that the Son of God is alive again with the Baptist with right among us and has given us life as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth to the types in many places he was the first fruits of those that slip the bright coming of Christ now in the pride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will be a sheaf wave again in the last days Navan of the sheaf but we talk about the waving of a sheaf of the seven seals alright so that is it right here now Raven of the sheaf what was the chief the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was or week's hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was grieve over the people and this is the final quote there's nothing after this just miss white that means this is the final I'm nothing else after this hallelujah are you ready and for the first time prophecy there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of data nomination will be a message that the full maturity of the world has turned back again to its full power being wave over the people by the same signs and wonders that see big back there or glory to God what a prophecy full maturity of the word after 50 years turning into power being waved again but signs wonders and miracles Oh glory the whole we know the Raptors at hand when Christ is walking among us Oh glory to God is here you see a dead raised from the dead crong he's an author bring wrapped in feet to the people or glory to God
