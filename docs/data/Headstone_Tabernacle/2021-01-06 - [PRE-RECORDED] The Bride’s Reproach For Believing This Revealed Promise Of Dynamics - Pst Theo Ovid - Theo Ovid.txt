and also we're going to read some from numbers chapter 14. we're going to read numbers chapter 13 verse 30 to 32. i'll be going to numbers chapter 14 and read a couple of verses verse 1 verse 5 verse 11 verse 22 to 24 27 31 and 36 to 45 you can't remember all that but i'm saying that anyhow so we know that we are reading the word for all of you who haven't read your bible for the whole week we're making up time for you to read scriptures sister hello very welcome you're back amen praise the name of the lord sister june i read in numbers 13 verse 30 and the reason i'm reading the scriptures in this sequence is to give you a sort of sketch and i want to give you some homework for homework you want to read number 13 whole chapter number 14 forward don't be afraid you might be tested on it but do the homework so reading verse 30 of numbers chapter 14 doubtless you shall not come unto the land considering which i swear to make you dwell oh oh that's right i'm looking at 14. thank you thank you thank you these guys sharpen the wood ah this is good this is very very good that's how it's supposed to be i'm not where i'm supposed to be you say what what's that what mean at this all right so number chapter 13 i want to read from verse 30 and caleb still the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are strong on our way and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eases up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that saw it in it are men of great stature let's switch to numbers chapter 14 verse one and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried the people wept that night verse five then moses and aaron fell on their face before all the children of israel of the congregation of israel verse 11 and the lord said unto moses how long will this people provoke me how long will it be air they believe me for all the signs which i have showed among them verse 23 surely they shall not see the land which i swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoke me see it but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and had followed me fully him will i bring into the land where unto he went and his seed shall possess it verse 27 how long shall i bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me i have heard the murmurings of the churn of israel and their murmur against me say unto them as truly as i live saith the lord as ye have spoken in my ears so will i do to you your carcass shall fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from 20 years old and upwards which have murmured against me doubtless he shall not come into the land concerning which i swear to make you dwell therein see if caleb the son of jeffery and joshua the son of none but your little ones which you said should be a pray them will i bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despised let's go down to verse 36 and the men in which moses sent to search the land who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the land even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the lord and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jeffers which were of the men that went to sisterland live still and moses told these saiyans unto all the children of israel and the people mourn greatly and they rose up early in the morning and got them up into the top of the mountain saying lo we be here and we'll go up unto the place which the lord had promised for we have sinned and moses said wherefore now do you transgress the commandments of the lord but it is not but it shall not prosper go not up for the lord is not among you that ye be not smitten before your enemies for the americanites and the canaanites are dear before you and you shall fall by the sword because you are turn away from the lord therefore the lord will not be with you but they presumed to go up onto the hilltop nevertheless the act of the covenant of the lord and moses departed not out of the camp then the amalekites came down and the canaanites which dwell on the hill and smote them and discomforted them even unto horrible let's pray father we thank you for your word that's already anointed we thank you for your people gathered here oh god give them water this morning give them manner this morning give them bread this morning even the bread of life this morning take me out of the way and be glorified in all that we see and do json we ask it amen you may be seated it's so good to be here i wish i could refer back much to this service through this it was a special service uh you should go on here to the website uh it's already there and um speaking about the website you know our facebook page is online it's live and uh is some of the things expressing it is really a blessing to me and i like to share uh two of the things that i note a bad attitude is like a flat tire you can't go anywhere until you change it i really like that one i see again a bad attitude is like a flat tire you can't go anyway until you change it and uh i want to thank you all for all you given your likes and so on we appreciate your support for this online ministry because it is a ministry and it is a responsibility and we take it seriously are we take it to serve and the next one that i love is if if you were accused of being a christian and placed in front of a jury would there be enough evidence to convict you think that word reason again if you were accused of being a christian and placed in front of a jury would there be enough evidence to convict you that's something to think about all the judges say get out of here we want evidence that could convict you they love their enemies ah that's point number one hallelujah they do good they do good to them that hate them that's point number two hallelujah they caught them praying every day and i see them through the window reading their bibles every single day they read in the bible that had to be a christian holiday humbling heart humbling spirit couldn't bring a conviction to say that truly is a christian arrest them and tie them up in chains of love send them home for eternity hallelujah force them down to the resurrection hallelujah i sentence you to the rapture for being a genuine christian get the lord come praise his people hallelujah so you go to that facebook page and get inspired hallelujah amen so this morning uh our title the bride's reproach for believing this revealed promise of dynamics the bride's reproach for believing this revealed promise of dynamics and i have an inspiration don't presume anything get thus saith the lord don't presume anything get dusty hello reproach to find fault to blame a disgrace all of this the bride must suffer like abraham 25 years believing on the promise of isaac like noah 120 years believe in the promise of reign now let's go along into the word but the brahmana wrote a message called reproach for the cause of the word god has a time and a reason for that time to fulfill all his work god knows just exactly what he's going to do we don't we just have to receive it as they give it to us but he knows and there is nothing going to go wrong with what he's planned to do [Applause] so stop trying to assist god nothing is going to go wrong remember what we said on tuesday night because balaam had something in his heart that was corrupt when god tell him don't go he still went back to seek the lord to see if god will change his mind and when he went back got to go but it came from perfect will to permissive will and we will emphasizing the reveal word will of god when the word reveal it it is the will of god it's not your dream it's not somebody text you it's the word being revealed and you've fallen in line to obey the word because if you watch what god say and how god bless people and you do that god have to bless you god must bless you because he's the same yesterday the today and wherever and if you see how god cursed people and you do that god will have to touch you because he is just and he is god he got to keep his word there is no respecter of persons he is god and god alone oh give them glory now the rescriptory red wasn't about unbelievers or make believers or they wasn't god's people these were the people that god brought out these were the people that saw miracles and these are the people that god was about to judge [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah know this message this morning it's not an easy one but this is what i got from the lord to bring to you he knows and there's nothing going to go wrong with what he plans to do it all has to come about and they have to sometimes have to have rugged and hard things to bring out the true nature of the object rain is born in rugged ragged thundering skies god sets a time and has a purpose for everything he does there's nothing happen accidentally i love that to them that love the lord and called according to his purpose even the bad things and the uncomfortable things working out for good so so get comfortable with being uncomfortable come on now see him and somebody stop trying to get everything comfortable as you wanted get comfortable with being uncomfortable get comfortable being under pressure get comfortable being under tension get comfortable having mind profit get comfortable [Applause] hallelujah glory conquered not strange you're feeling uncomfortable cocky not strange you got a battle to come in this morning coconuts trained the devil didn't want you to be here this morning but you had to be here this morning because there's a word from the lord for you hallelujah no watch he said no but the brand i'm talking about came to church the two people carrying on making love in church volga and he's begging them to be quiet and the holy spirit said they're in your hands what will you do with them there was a holy hush everybody was deadly quiet i thought oh god what must i do then i remembered if it happened in the warning of the holy spirit two days before i said i forgive you amen and that is what he wanted me to say because after all i've been guilty maybe not of that but i'm guilty and guilty of the lease is of the whole so i said i forgive you and there are witnesses sitting here the holy spirit fell through now you see i believe that all these things had a meaning what would you do with the power why would god give a man power when the man don't have character that doesn't make sense he's going to abuse that power and god hates abuse god don't want no husband abusing no wife god even said if you don't treat your wife right he wouldn't even answer your prayer that's the word and this is how we go back to the bible this is how we get guidance and how we live not just to sit in church and say amen you got to live right you got to have right you got to do right [Applause] [Music] i want to say it again because saying again if you don't treat your wife right god will not answer your prayer so you better go back to the negotiating table and sort all the issues out why did you go there because i'm a pastor i'm supposed to go there don't go there this morning but all of it stop me oh give the lord some praises people i will go wherever the lord tell me to talk there is going to be a revival and we got to tie up all the loose hands brother john was trying to translate that loose ends and he said the french don't have you know and the only way to say it is no more issues i like that tie up that there have been no more issues once there are issues that but the brandon has attacked all the loose ends before the seven thunders come before the angels come he has to have all the loose ends some genesis tap all what was loose and you have to tap all the looseness in your life because when god sent the power he doesn't want it to leak out so you have to make sure there is no leaks in your building come on now god want to tie up all the loose ends you're loose living your loose life your loose attitudes the inspector coming to inspect your box car and you're gonna shake it and see everything shaken and if there's nothing shaking then he could seal the whole thing [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so you ruined i'm saying back your husband hold on get blessed with her save him with reference you can see what you have to say but say it respectfully you don't have to say it disrespectfully say it respectfully you can see what's upon your heart but say it with respect then it shows that they respect god you respect the word you're in the word in ephesians sharing will be the appearance you're in ephesians praise god father don't provoke your children because you're the father no the bible talk the balance children by your parents but father don't provoke your children treat them right it's a whole balance it's not an off-balance business oh give the lord some praises people hallelujah hallelujah so the fathers have the responsibility the mothers have their responsibility the children have the responsibility the wise have their responsibility you are your responsibility every man of the responsibility man by man [Applause] all right okay so you want to see what you would do with the power the reaction to an action something comes to act and you want to see how you're going to react and god loves to do that let somebody mash your corn let something happen upset let something happen out of sync with what you expect god disappoint your expectation just looking at you yeah let me see my son let me see we can handle this one let your wife talk to you a certain way and check you out and see a grumping gump and grumping let your husband tell you something and see and check you out god loves to do that hello but we sang and you sang sweetly we shall overcome someday this is the day you're gonna start to overcome this is the day you're gonna understand the test is given for you to overcome hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can you remember the disciples returning back rejoicing because they figured that they were conquered woody the standard reports for his name all that live godly in christ shall bear persecution the reproach of the word you always have to stand this reproach in order hear the purpose are you ready in order to give your destin the reproach is always to give you a taxi see so when god tell ibraham go can i make it right there you know see i got son next week look out next nice monday night then ibrahimovic hall like you know you get kentucky buy chicken instant food we call it fast food fast food nice fast fulfilled promise but you see you see patience is waiting on god and for god and and they can't get patients quick you have no fast food patience how fast god doesn't work patients like me patients must have this perfect work that could be entire lack of nothing so when god gave up promise he just put time on it he gave time for people to laugh at you hallelujah time for people to mock you look god tell buddha bran and he will kill the calibur big big bear how long it is and think of a big big caribou when they were hunting the grass was so low people tell about the random it has no caribou here but brother branham said i have nothing to do with that if god say 42 inch if god said caribou if god said grizzly tip or whatever it is if god said that he is able to make it come wherever you want to come so why they're talking and they're talking and the grass that's there when they look back so curry boobie [Applause] grisley tip or whatever it's right there who did that our business man to figure out how god doing it our business find out what god promised and let the devil know we believe that i i don't know when god gonna fulfill it my my my faith is to believe dynamics is promised power is promise not not a one power no it's promise in other words power is minds it is promise god said so i want to be like caleb have another spirit with me because them christ brought an evil report and god said as i live they're going to fall in the wilderness they're going to perish because i brought them out to give them all these precious promises that by these promises that can be a divine particle of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world you lost in other words you said that's it let me see that you take it today you are saying that you can't live that this is the promised land whenever you say that i don't know about that no that's insane just like what i'm evil report the land is a good land these people were so backslidden in spirit they say god would to god be tied in egypt you bring us out here to perish no you come out here to possess [Applause] [Music] mine so you always have to have this reproach to get a testing every man that comes to christ must first be child trained for the purpose that god has ordained you for remember if you could just keep quiet amen that would be bold we carry on we not keeping quiet watch remember if we call you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening are you ready there is not enough devils in torment but what god would will be mean manifest i'm still reading you are born for a purpose and nobody can take your place [Applause] oh give the lord a big hallelujah he said you were born for a purpose tell the devil he's a liar you were born for a purpose that purpose must be fulfilled do you know god raise up pharaoh to bring long pharaoh so friends you could only understand god by faith and which is by revelation not by intellect intellect cannot comprehend god because intellect is limited there are no sense in intellect of man to contact god outside of the sense of faith and faith is a revelation so the prophet said that there is no school the christian mission of god revealed no theologians no teachings of the bible among any school they cannot know nothing about it it is impossible for them to know anything about it god here we go has hid the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers talking about gifted man gifted teachers and their senses are comprehended so what they're pumping you with with his intellect the front loop back loop square loop whatever loop the gray matter that is what they're peddling intellect because god is not known by intellect are you with me that is why they were ignorant and unlearned peter was ignorant and unlearner peter couldn't sign his name peter couldn't sign a check peter may not even count all the bills but he had to take note he had been with jesus that man knew god not about god he can read about it he carried so he didn't knew about god he knew god because god was veiled in him middle eyes as was in moses god veiled in peter it wasn't reading about god it was saying silver and gold have i none what do you have i have god in me what is it what is it god above us purify a cloud god with us jesus christ and then god in you the holy ghost itself that's what's always god's purpose to hide himself in man to wrap himself in earthen vessels oh my you're getting me excited treasure in earth and vessels you are the earthen vessels you want to wrap himself in oh hallelujah hallelujah jesus what's the first sign behold i give you a sign a virgin shall conceive and she came with the firstborn wrapped in swaddling clothes wrapped up the baby wrap up jesus he wrap your wrap you up wrap up your spirit into your life some tall some shorts some fat whatever it is it doesn't matter god failed god hiding himself god choose to hide himself oh what a wretch i am but god choose to hide himself you talk about praises and honor and glory when you understand what manner of love is this that god could choose to wrap himself inside of you that you got god rap gift you got a christmas skill you got the gift of the holy ghost that's your promise the promise of the father my god if you don't have it you're going to get it nothing could stop it from coming to you because that seed is in your soul that predestinated mystery is inside of you or glory to god what a jubilee time what a joyful time this is the best time of your life you may be seated this world go into a crisis russia ukraine israel all kinds of things all over the world never has the world been such a terrible time when you could see they don't know what to do up to the day they cut off somebody's head isis a man of aids worker his demon powers loosed on the earth hallelujah hitler the brains behind hitler was an educated man but brother branham said look what education did did not even think in his demon power satan ride in the earth streams you can't fight that with your intellect you can't fight when the enemy coming like a flood what standard that you want to raise what strength do you have praise god we're getting tired we're getting all we're hanging in there for years believe in the promise remember for 400 years they were believing that the liberal was coming generation after generation expectation of the expectation reproach after reproach barring as ever but they believe anyhow they tell it to their children and tell their children tell it to your children and tell your children tell it to your children and tell it to another generation that the delivery is coming to bring us out of bondage and i have a testimony from you that god said talent tell it to them that fire coming power coming deliver is coming there is one standing among you he's going to baptize you with fire [Applause] what am i preaching i'm preaching dynamics why are they fighting while i am preaching i am preaching the promises i am not off the word i am not talking no cuckoo doctrine or any funny thing i am not doing that this is your promise and the pride around the world is paying our reports this morning for believing our promise of dynamics [Applause] hallelujah not promising more mysteries sorry sorry not promise of more knowledge promise of dynamics i'll tell it to you brother brown said you don't even have to know you don't even have to know the mechanics i don't have to know the spark plug going to the engine and this all i want to know when i put the key the car starts [Applause] grandchild going to the dry shaft and his carburetor and this and that i don't need to know that all i need to know when i turn that key that engine tumble and i could go where i want to go that's the same thing you need the holy ghost hey come to that key hallelujah praise god stop the engine and let's get going with the revival bunch of stories and intellectual nonsense confusing the people messing with their minds no faith whatsoever no expectation no genuine worship because you've got to be free to genuinely worship god you can't have no issues [Applause] why do you think i can freely put all the messages on the internet because i am free i am preaching the word let everybody judge it let the pope in room listen to it it is still the word i am not ashamed of the gospel i am not ashamed of what i preach i am not ashamed of the promise of dynamics [Applause] how abram must have suffered he had a tough one god make it hard for the people by putting an old man on that promise of having a challenge a wife can't produce nothing god said rock them holly rock their mind hey man shake up the intellect they know it can happen so it had to be god hallelujah when god when god do something like that when when it shake the intellect when everything looking impossible that's why god yourself tell them about you shall conceive no wonder isaiah didn't go back in the human spirit to figure that out and say you know what i wish i conceived i can't say that lord that's human business but if god said of which shall conceive them guys only speaking the word look look joshua tell them be crossing over three days i tell them high priest go down to the river them guys are fumbling and wondering and this one said i can't swim i didn't go to swimming classes there wasn't that they just take up the act and they walked straight down to jordan and as they touched the [Applause] men that would obey god men that would completely obey him i know some people like moses you know their problem with joshua moses was a pleasing man oh god spear them take me don't take them moses make a tune in the wilderness wilderness man joshua joshua is warrior it never says moses is the warrior joshua's a warrior his ministry is different his behavior is different he's an action man so if you want moses ministry you're in the wrong church joshua is take the land every place you put your foot is taught are you taking the land stop wasting time in my land take it or get out i think on the facebook page have stopped making an excuse make progress stop making excuses make progress good luck i hate to see deadness and a dead young person is the worst kind of dead there is yes if somebody old killed up the day and they fall asleep on that you can understand that they long at a vineyard they battle through a lot of things but to see a young man nodding and bobbing on things like that you need voice of the archangel [Applause] we went to pray or fasting every week once a year we cannot prevent you all night permitted don't want to think these young people don't even read books they just they're surviving off their parents gas when i say gas i mean gas i mean bad pillow fridge stove everything is telling your mother's home you'll face nothing yet when david went out to meet to meet his brethren to carry food david didn't know he was gassed up for gallard [Music] notice his brothers had no gas to give him his brothers have no inspiration to give him his own brethren had a new anointing for him they had no encouragement for him under contrary they were reproaching him they were asking him what he didn't hear they were asking him why are they staying with the sheep but david said isn't there a cause isn't there a reason why i am who i am because i have to deal with something you're not dealing with it but god raised me up to deal with it i'm anointed for it oh give the lord some praises people and that is when you come into the position to know who you are and to know who's you are to know where you come from and to know where you're going [Applause] listen friends miracles are about to break forward miracles i'm not talking about blessings i say miracles things that they don't even expect changes that they didn't expect miracles real miracles is about to happen prepare for miracles miracles the miraculous hallelujah because omnipotent's gonna speak [Applause] hallelujah i'm omnipotent speak miracles start to take place cripples gonna start to walk blind gonna start to see death gonna start to hear and the dead i see them raising already right inside of here [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah that husband on yours won't be delivered oh yeah the wife of yours hallelujah some people faith so low they felt so weak they prefer to label the wife or husband than to pray and faith believing they'll be delivered the privilege to say my husband is a serpent see that my wife is at this or my husband is that that on my shoulders and they say no whatever he's a liar he might be all twisted up he's a worm but he's a butterfly you have that worm behavior calling wrong but i prophesy that them butterfly wings gonna come god gonna take him out of the cuckoon of his love god gonna take him and cover him under the tent of his presence under the canopy of life and under that canopy of silence but gonna transform you from the inside out oh glory to god glory to god you may be seated you have natural genetic disposition dna stuff in you that you can't control that god allowed to your family lineage to be a certain way some are strong some aggressive somehow quiet some of this that i or some worry a lot some have faith some have doubt and you have no control over that but that what god has in you is beyond that that's why the bible said the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so when god go past your family dreams your gender your genetic disposition when god go past all of that you see a mystery inside of there and god's had to activate that mystery to make a call which is a deep calling to a deep and afterwards you can't help it i don't care if your mother was a drunkard that don't make you a drunkard i would have your father i used to drink and i was a big boozer that don't make you a boozer god going to bring you out this is a day of miracles this is day of coming out but god wants you to confess that the land is a good land don't confess your doubts don't talk about your fears let the week say i am strong oh give the lord some praises people now watch you may be seated so god hit the very senses of knowing it from the elected teachers elected teachers who teach in bible who teach and message you say here it is he has been revealed to me and then the life that christ reduced here in the bible that seemed like that's in him does not produce itself in you then you have the wrong revelation [Applause] oh brother over you mean it's not just revelation and i can't say multiplication another word is that revelation and being able to mount things no the revelation has to produce a life god is not known by intellectual fate blind leaders of the blind notice god hold this key alone god is not known by education he is not known by how to explain it so i complain explain to trump i can explain the new name explain the mysteries explain the thunders the viles the woes woman and the sun all the all the books of revelation that does not make it god you know god by how to explain it that doesn't make me god filled because i can explain it you ever see them book a theology they see it come inside and read it some big fat thing human intellect write them things and put it in school someday this is doctor so and so now there's no ordinary folk right this is doctor somebody now i think what's senior one of them was praying in the back and some says come and tell him you need him holy ghost one of them guys i can't remember where it was and they said we're praying for it getting hold he goes and he's he taught he was so ashamed he went and prayed god you feel me holy ghost sisters he's the only one he goes and god fill the holy ghost and that activate him and set him on fire how are you explaining that no that's illusion holy holy what fool he goes is he the legend don't have it he doesn't know what it is you know what the bible said we read caleb god said had another spirit he had the holy ghost joshua was representing the holy ghost it was caleb and joshua caleb represent the true believer [Applause] and the last day he's gonna have caleb and joshua again who is caleb the true believer who is just what the holy ghost [Applause] [Music] oh hallelujah hallelujah you mean the holy was going to reach you yes in you teaching you directing you spirit led world living guided by god [Applause] nobody branham says god is known by simplicity and a revelation of jesus christ in the most illiterate person amen hallelujah watch and the life of christ projecting his life through you with preeminences to the people that they see the very life works i keep seeing it over and over he never talked about teaching doctrine message you talking about the life the life have to be projected and i don't think people get in that people are safe in their churches for so long they have been taught to believe the pastor and the minister and the group that they trusted men instead of trusting the word understanding by no man people supporting this one and that one i'm standing by the word if anybody's standing on the word i'm standing with him i don't even have to meet him paul was in an arabian desert and when he get to peter they're speaking the same things and when paul at the boss and straighten out peter paul bust and straighten out peter because peter was going contrary to the principles of the word so you have to straighten on peter when peter said a right he said you have to be watch how paul writes because paul is a you know paul says i'm strong things i can't talk like paul because paul a different capacity and so forth everybody has different capacity and position and calling on sean i'm going to begin to reveal to the brethren what they're calling is no mankind tell me whether i would stay there you know that is your calling they are not my holy ghost they might want to be i mean my denominational pope guide or something like that but i'm not allowing them that privilege because god already take that position up there hello they can see for that they don't know if they can see to lead me they don't they can see the direct me you have no position for that holy ghost already take up that place to direct me where he wants me to go what he wants me to say and i will only say what he wants me to say praise god friend oh no friend family oh no family hallelujah and that's my son's that i tell him like it is yes ask any one of them tell them i love them very much but i don't love them stupid i love them with all these senses hallelujah i love them to rebuke them to correct them to amen to challenge them and that's how i love them they have no pastors and privileges ask them what make a person sunday for any other son or pastor daughter from any other daughter is the same some of them is big rascals some are getting most trouble in the church and they're protected by pastor that's my sons i'm not playing with words i'm not playing with games this is just oh i am hallelujah oh praise god you see you have to get disconnected from the senses part to really connect to god because your children will mess you up i tell people live for the lord only for your children put god firstly turn around and get all and leave you forget about you live for god put god first god does god first [Applause] if i take on all the issues and put some issues i will not even preach oh god man pray for me saints since you know what it is i stress out if i come here with that what kind of thing is that i can't afford to do that no no no no it's the word righteous right and wrong is wrong god has no respect to a person isn't that right do you love him oh praise the lord so watch by lack of revelation is why there are so many different divisions today and so much mockery so much visions among us is because the people like that revelation they lack that revelation the teachers could imagine the teachers lack revelation they have knowledge but not revelation oh my so here is lucifer again limiting the word of god to his reasonings that is lucifer now from simulator here we go when the church gets away from the word it will believe anything now do you realize like eve when cain was born she said i've gotten a man from the lord now listen to this revelation but the branham is breaking here do you realize that she really meant that she taught that she had a man from the lord you see once she had been deceived by taking the word of satan instead of the word of god she then taught that whatever she said was right and if she said she had a man from god then she had a man from god but god has set his laws universe a good seed can only bring forth good fruit even seed can only bring for evil food now eat seed true different will utilize the same earth nourishment moisture sunshine but it will bring forth of its own kind now if you look at the statement of eve real close you will notice that she had more of an understanding than most realized she did not attribute the son to satan for that would have made him equal with god so eve had deeper thoughts than you might might appear only god could create the egg in the womb of mary satan couldn't do that eve knew that satan can only pervert so he beguiled her with the wrong seed it was the serpent sea that brought fort came it was adam's sea that brought fort abel and set those seeds went through the same process but the children were different for they were different seeds she believed that cain was from god she accepted the devil's lie as the truth of god that is exactly what we have now churches set themselves up as fountains of the truth but the truth is not in them they have begotten children swear by them and would even kill to uphold the error if you think that's an exaggeration read second timothy chapter three i charge ddf4 before god and the lord jesus who shall judge the quick and the dead at his apparently his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure song doctrine but after their own lust shall heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall turn to fables but watch though in all things and your afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry when the church allow herself to move away from the original like adam and eve debt set in there is no strength in her she has become a monstrosity the minute the church moved towards form and ceremony and towards priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group that decided leadership apart from the holy spirit and his word that very moment death entered when she started to get sick and she got sick she charged she changed to a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument when i was studying this and i read this i said my mind was totally blown only weapon argument she could produce nothing in the spirit for her hopes were built and programmed and not on faith in his word they sold program they reprogram they sold pervision they read perverted children you tamper with god and you'll reap exactly what you injected what will happen if you change your truth into a lie the answer is you will breed an antichrist godless system of religion that is so perverted it will not look like or produce that original what the original did the only answer that god has for situation like that is the lake of fire there are those who say that god's people are going to come together through a collective revelation i want to get to this this is but at his time there was a scene in that time that elijah ministry of malachi 4 is a collective ministry it's a body ministry and he had to refute that listen to this there are those who say that god's people are going to come together through a collective revelation i challenge that statement it is uh it's a ball invalid assumption in the face of revelation 10 7. now i do not deny that people will prophesy in this last age and their ministry scanner will be correct i do not deny that there will be prophets even in the days of paul there was one akavas a prophet who prophesied a famine i agree that is so but i deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who would reveal the mysteries as contained in the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of return to the fathers thus saith the lord his unfailing word stands and shall stand and be vindicated there is one prophet messenger to this age on the basis of human behavior alone anyone that where there are many people there is even divided opinion on lesser points of major doctrines that they hold together who then will have the power of infallibility to be restored in the last age for this last age is going to go back to manifesting a pure world bride [Applause] so in other words once there are men there'll be differences that's obvious when they are people in family their differences and church is their differences he said who is going to bring back that infallible word because they're going to have a pure bride are you with me now watch the second tour that must be impressed okay sorry that means here we go we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given perfectly understood in the days of paul i will tell you who will have it it will be a prophet vindicated even more thoroughly vindicated than any other prophet in all ages from enoch to this day that is the magnitude of vindication are you with me because this man will of necessity have the capstone prophetic ministry [Applause] hallelujah so do you caught what peter branham had he had the capstone prophetic ministry so his ministry revealed the mysteries to bring down the capsule itself therefore this prophet has revealed every mystery no man can come back to reveal no mystery it has already been revealed we have to find where it is written where it is hidden but it's already in the word because monarch i thought at the capstone ministry [Applause] oh hallelujah god will show him forth he won't need to speak for himself god will speak for him by the voice of the sign the second thought that must be impressed on our hearts is that the seven church ages started out with the antichrist spirit as well as the holy spirit listen to the approach of him going into scriptures first john 4 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirit you have a dream who said that is god people take every dream for god they see alligator they see a tiger and they see a flock every dream sometimes you eat corn too late in the night somebody overeat and everything get crossed up and then they get some pictures in your head and they come out of your bed with that even with something good you could write it shelf it you know watch it but don't come out with islam you're looking for it unless god gives you a direct vision fear not joseph to take unto thee mary thy wife joseph gathered in a dream a dream i know she went to her reproach i know she's going through her thing everybody mocking and laughing her but that is what the bride has to go through but you're pregnant with messiah you're going to produce the life of christ do you believe that all right believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they of god watch watch because many false prophets are going out into the world not literal many did you notice it the antichrist spirit is identified with false prophets the ages came into force prophets and they go out with false prophets now of course there's going to be a real false prophet in the grandson of that man mentioned in revelation but as now before this revelation they had to pay many false prophets matthew 24 36 and they and if any man shall say unto you lord he has christ believe it not they shall arise false christ false prophets shall show great signs and wonders in so much if they were possible they shall receive the very elect behold i have told you before wherefore if they say unto you behold he's in the desert go not forth behold he's in the secret chamber believe it not these false prophets are a emacked for us in various other scriptures such as second peter two one to two and there were false prophets among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the law that brought them and bring them from themselves with destruction for many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of ii timothy 4 3 and 4 for the time will come when they shall not end your song doctrine but after their own lust shall he to themselves teachers have been itching ears and they shall turn away their heirs from the truth and shall be turned to fables second timothy 4 1 the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter time shall come many shall depart from defeat given he to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils now in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the world just as we showed you that antichrist means untoward saw these false prophets come perverting the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends have you ever noticed how the people who leads others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear i want to repeat that have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind the people to themselves by fear they say if the people don't do what they see or they leave then destruction will follow they are false prophets for a true prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to jesus christ and he won't tell the people to hear him or what he says but to fear what the words say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah i'm exhausted this morning on the word butterburner give me a church here we go full of the holy ghost god will do in one year what all the theology failed to do in 2000 years you wait till the anointing of the church really strike home that's what we're looking for that's the dynamics we're talking about we are looking for a church full of earth full of the holy ghost full of what the holy ghost after the dawn's gentleness closed go and learn to change them he does fill to be filthy still oh praise god notice here we go moses he was the anointed word for that i promised with for that day isn't that right noah was anointed with that day abraham and so forth now watch and moses stood there that anointed word of that day that's why he could put his hand on his wisdom why he was standing in the presence of god you see when samson is under the anointing he could do anything when moses is on the anointing these guys could do anything it wasn't moses it was the presence it wasn't moses what the kind of glory it wasn't brother bryan and one time god taught barack do you think is you healing the people you have to remain by the brand you see what's so automatic it was so flowing he said you think is you healing the people this god was healing the people is that man healing the people is the virtue in freely oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right so moses the glory around him every move he made represented god are you ready that is where the church ought to be standing now hallelujah he said but we are off on something nomination or something so the church now should be representing god every move we make supposed to be under the glory and direction of the spirit direction of the spirit not intellect if you are scriptures men are led by the spirit of god they're the sons of god now watch god spoke i must deliver but to moses whether he like it or not he said not to be different but to be obedient obedience is better than sacrifice god had so much complete control of them till he was their voice and their actions i like that god had these men so much under their his control his control that those men became his voice and action it was not mata man studying to bring forth a message no it was a matter of the man so much in the presence of god that he spoke for god they were one with their message they were one with god isn't that right hallelujah god had so much complete control of them till he was their voice and give me a church that's so completely anointed with god till their very action and move is thus saith the lord walk in that kind of glory i will show you a messiah anointed one standing upon the face of the earth oh hallelujah so he is predicting he is prophesying give me a church full of the holy ghost he is predicting he is prophesying a church anointed with god hallelujah a church anointed with god what is that the promise of the father [Applause] jesus told a woman in the world we know what we worship the father secret such to worship him in spirit and in we didn't have the full truth to the ages because only now god could get proper worship because william branham brought the fullness of the word back to the people with the fullness of the word comes the fullness of the spirit so it's only no god to release the fullness of his spirit so we can act ignorant we can't act like we don't know we have 40 years of this message right in the earth 40 plus years god filtering taking out the make believer the unbeliever a halfway believer whatever because you have to work two believers oh praise god that woman of the world was a true believer you know she just didn't know it yet she was trapped in the pharisees and she was trapped under our kind of life but that didn't hinder that seed inside of her and some of you might be trapped inside of here but that's not going to hinder the seed of god inside your life that's why god will open his eyes big when this one in this condition and that condition in that condition is religious people open their eyes big and find fault with us and find fault for that but we have all sin and come short of the glory of god are you with me we'll praise the name of the lord hallelujah let's get down a little deeper now abraham father of nations how many children you do you have at this time that old critical spirit would criticize what did abraham said stagger not to the promise of god why you are praying here so and so that doesn't matter if i prayed for ten thousand tonight this is brother brown and ten thousand died in the morning tomorrow night i was still annoying and sick and pray for them god said so doesn't stop it one bit but that's the reproach for the word hallelujah so whenever you believe a promise and god put time on that promise hallelujah that's you bearing a reproach for the world your wife said where is the promise your husband said where is the promise your neighbor said where is the promise church member said where is the promise but you are believing a promise and you are believing it and being a reproach for the very word itself watch the scuffness of baroness i like that combination the scuffness of baroness being scuffed do you approach a baroness first she had to stand the report of being barren for all those years no life he's talking about life that's the thunder that shake the devil the life behind the name that make the demons tremble oh what the trainer needs thousands of voices only talking about virtues for years since these seventies was my first jews virtues virtues so watch barbara says you could have the batman goes 24 hours and still be lost but what they didn't go down deeper is that there is body there is soul and there is spirit now if you don't need the holy ghost peter can i bypass the upper room peter could have said i my name is in the book i have a seat in my soul but every time the ball look him he go run because he have no power he's sealing his soul but but no power but when he got the holy ghost he got the holy ghost upon the season and soul not running anywhere peter said this is that that the prophet joel speaker [Music] i don't know why i'm saying all of this you may be seated and after a while you say you come today then and the lord show me that's true we come to a dead end but we die at the end and god show me joshua moses came to deaden and joshua take over jesus came to the dead and the holy ghost take over the thunders bring you to a dead end it has to bring you to a dead end hallelujah if you bypass the tree of life you'll jump onto the cheek of knowledge and you'll get plenty mysteries off that knowledge tree oh glory to god we have them been there before brother george hallelujah we have been there before we know there's a revolution of life the seed and you have to come to life some point in time you have to get alive i come that you might have life oh give the lord some praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah so people can make the word say whatever they wanted to say but there's a middle of the road it's not right oh hallelujah baroness poweriness where's the manifestation some people have pillow fire picture light rainbow color light all kind of flashes what kind of thing like that that don't even bother me doesn't impress me i want to know what behind that light what life behind that light if you are not like that like i know you know light not the light for us the wood he would say it have to have something behind here and that's what i am interested in like that's what i want to see oh that's what i fighting for for years isn't that right that's 17 year old i saw money woman and popularity when i was 17 years old studying this message oh yeah go call me 16 17 and put a two cent on my half of righteousness and i'm still hungry that's what step twisting this morning still can't get over him and the power of his love i still can't take for granted oh hallelujah praise god and that's the whole thing people presuming i'm presuming we're going to find out i didn't get there yet it's the venture without authority that's the word presuming and god through moses told those people we read don't go up because god not with you yeah god forgive them and they belong with you don't go take it easy keep praying keep repenting make sure the spirit come back make sure god start to move don't go up because america is up there they will smite you because god's not with you you have to understand the battles not yours is the lord's if you obey him amen [Applause] many people feel that they're fighting and the other fight back and you have to say this something is your fight [Music] when moses was on the rock that in the morning that they win the battle when moses hunt for a long you know blues so who was controlling the battle up the ham not them it's a hand if they hand up victory handle do you know what they pop them up let's put a rock and stone this holy hand up there right you god help us make your hand hold up for us that we could get victory this morning it's not you it's god that's why he said bless his name and worship him it's not you going to bring back your son and daughter it could be god [Applause] flesh have to take and exist you see a lot of people want to help god they want to do it like moses all the time moses saying don't say lord that's the lord that's certain people when god says speak to the rock moses get vicks and with this mighty reconciliation like you and i and iran bring water for you rebels that was dusty at moses and god didn't like that because all the time all mother was supposed to do is dusty the lord god god it was god's people it wasn't moses because god brought them out god says speak to the rock for water moses didn't feed him and speak his anointed mighty rock drinky rebels it looked good it looked bad it looked impressive anybody said you see that you should be smited god say hello come in the back room i want to talk to you take mosuli back office and say moses you glorify yourself and for doing that i'm going to discipline you you see god don't spoil children we just make a mess of a job as parents mess god don't you straighten out his sons straight not his daughters street not his people i'm not talking about the enemy no i'm talking about his people hallelujah notice when the backslide he let some king come and take them captive until they repent and then he punish that king and bring them out that's what we're talking about my my mind so abraham now he went to his his reproach isn't that right and they came true now just want to bring back something new that wine and oil is connected together and wine is the power of stimulation by revelation and when something is revealed it gives stimulation to the believer so when people shake in their head about iman amen amen there's no revelation yet you know that's just a man in the wood but when things are revealed it brings a stimulation that just make it jump on your seat that doesn't make you want to run on the building that has been the excitement of your life when you get to revelation and to get revelation the holy spirit are revealed to you and they get revelation you have to be in the spirit so the devil's job now is to rub you up the spirit he's like a highway robber he puts your gun on say get off the spirit say something to throw you off the spirit so you come all natural you get upset your mind bothering you and you're not in the spirit and you're just going to the motion until you're watching the clock and say when we're over going undone when you're going undone when you're going you're but when you're in the spirit yeah study when you're going to finish because you want to get more you want to be empowered you want god to reveal it to you so you are in the spirit i have the person around you dead they bring a death spirit by you so you have to fight that back by that of worship that person are wrong you that you you're pushing them back because they're desperate leaning on you hollering that sleepy spirit leading in you making you feel sleepy too but when you get in the spirit oh yeah that that sleepy spirit is like whoa whoa whoa whoa i can't stay here i have to go too much of fire too much of worship too much of glory that's why in the upper room you come here thursday night they will worship worshiping continually not part-time worship don't apply if you want

the street you worship by testifying you worship by inviting people to service you worship him by giving him glory you worship god by living for him that is how you worship and when you live like that and you're coming here raise your hands that is true worship the father seeking true worshippers oh we're gonna have a upper room brother oh give them glory giving praise hallelujah you see man can live without god no dependency upon god that's why money just crushed people they come with money you could buy what they want go where they want fly whatever and do what they want because their money

pressing because she had to aim that she wanted to get a touch she wanted to be healed she wanted to get her breakthrough she was desperate desperate just make you do some crazy thing desperation is

dustbin and eaten from the thing too what do you really like what what do you really connect with what what is your spirit feeding on yeah yeah you feed yourself with a set of filth and so on you'll grow on that yes what what what what are your spirit feeding on the holy ghost feeds on the word that's where you get your strength from yeah that's where you get to function from inspiration from i know if i stay with the word god bless me i know that god bless the church if you stay with the world god will bless you god cannot not bless you blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsel ungodly not stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the law that's psalms 1 and in his law that he merited day and night he shall be like a tree planted by rivers of portal whatever he do shall prosper whatever he do shall prosper whether they curse it they can't stop it whatever he do gonna prosper because that man pleases the lord something else oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah when you please the lord god make an enemy to their peace [Music] enemy had to cool it because you're pleasing god if god won a war he could start oh glory to god how a little bit do you think god didn't see goliath parisian every f for the 40 days oh god every day morning morning either you know send me a man to fight me and then fellas only paralyzed fear only paralyzed in them send me a man to fight me go out going solid i'm laughing and then fellas behind it have a big manga they have a front man there's a man in front and they have no front man on this idea hallelujah when god had enough of that god inspired david's father carry something say brothers god never told david you won't think of gladhead that's the plan that god has david is unknown to that all david had is a backside experience no written mysteries david not reason anything is evil you know this is how the way to fight holy sword like that and holy sword like that and then i turn the page now fix the you know screw the handle in like that make sure the handle screwing tight david wasn't reading them things how to fix his sword and whatnot david get beer take him out david experience lion take him out that is written something that's experience say experience say like an experience david had an experience [Applause] [Music] you cannot defeat a man who has an experience as opposed to a man who read it in a book [Applause] you cannot defeat a man who has experienced [Applause] a man studying his degree to be a doctor fine professional phd and so on right now he's reading the book how to operate got it so kaddish so take the tread onto it you are sick you go to the hospital and i'm telling you this man just read it in the book he's coming to operate on you i will take my trust and faith in god and get out of that hospital [Applause] you don't want to in turn some nervous that comes a cutting he had trembling so he never cut before cutting you not me you need somebody who have experience so you want the great hair doctor who cut a thousand cases who know what he is doing because he had the experience dr jesus is on the scene now watch some people rely on the gifts and talent and almost like they want to assist god with their gifts and talent god don't need our gift and talent and that's what i love about david david didn't comfort in an overconfident manner if god was with me what killed him come with him no no david togola you come to me with spear and shield but i come to you in the name of the lord god of israel david knew he was represented god he was representing heaven he was representing the court of isaac jacob and of israel he knew he was anointed he knew he had the authority he wasn't presuming he told the lad i will cut your head off that's not earth that's not bad [Applause] that is what i'm going to do god god shake a black intellect because all the time god looking for a big man like himself very biggest one to fight he won quote for quote tax for text scripture for scripture david didn't come like that so when goliath saw david come and he said am i a dog is that your son to fight me you know who i am i am z gold hyatt with a capital g and david come like with the commandee i was gonna take your head off and david did just that by the spirit of prophecy and david gonna rise on the scene again oh yes a bride anointed with charity but to challenge the intellectual giants on the field but that's where they are on the field oh hallelujah hallelujah shaken up kingdom with the intellect oh yes no praising of the lord so therefore when something is revealed it brings stimulation because it is brought by revelation now what something every revival use a twin is none right jacob and esau isn't that right esau didn't care about the birthright but jacob he just wanted the birthright he didn't care isn't that right so every viable is a natural man and a spiritual man natural man just come to church he doesn't want to come to church you know where to go this morning go to church but spiritual man he wants his birthright want his portion i don't want you come here natural come here spiritual come here with a desire for the holy ghost [Applause] don't let nothing cut your expectation for the holy ghost anything cutting your expectation behold is the devil any doctrine cutting your expectation for god to fill you with the spirit is a doctrine of devils [Applause] a lot of people don't want to get the birthright because the thing is a little bit unpopular okay they don't want to get on the altar and cry a little bit or go to a few meals they don't want the new bird because they knew but it's kind of messy like any bird i don't care if it's a pig pen a band a pink hospital it's a mess oh praise the name of the lord you don't realize you've got a soul that's going to leave here and go somewhere oh my god you see what you're talking about people are acting and so on you see your destination right here the way you live and the way you do it is scary you are here what you are somewhere else people that want to take a ticket to have them friends i don't have enough breath and words to tell you it can't work that way but a brand i'm pleased with the brown time i haven't said bahamut it won't work you've got to have the token it was its own tabernacle you were telling the truth to them he said believe in me believe it you've got to apply the token that was applied now we say i got to display the token what was the token was the blood in the door post was the blood on the inside no the blood was on the outside isn't that right praise the name of the lord so all what these virtues that we have here it cannot be hidden it have to come only out how many stand that all this virtual knowledge and temperance it can't stay on the blackboard there and say we have a nice pretty picture that have to come on the outside of your life that your wife could see it your husband could see it your children could see it you're christian on every day praise god you do what you know there are some people when people are wrong then they do a lot of stuff because nobody is seeing this makes it alive and nobody is a you're a christian when nobody's looking are some people that's why that dictator said oh there's some people can't control their own life and they need dictators and god i'm not saying god it has spiritual dictators they're natural dictators these activists say let's sit down shut up move this wear this don't wear this they like that amen because they don't have that internal discipline that's not in training here every problem is a law pass a law pass a law they often already they ain't getting the skull laws don't work in that way because laws external laws can't con can't manage internal issues the problem is within the heart of man i know external law would just stop that thou shalt not steal god give that long time and since when man stopped stealing you know wrong god said thou shall not steal it's not now and you think god mansell's stealing you know what a klepto is just like to pick up things they don't even need it once they're there they pick it up they don't know what it's for let's pick it up could i have that anybody else have that they take it up too if you stay too long they'll pick you up too just klepto their hands itchy to take up things it's a spirit if that's pretty leave them they will behave different people need a cord people need the holy ghost and that's why i say we have no time to waste to argue to debate we only have time to die out to let christ begin to flow in us don't you love jesus this morning the greatest thing you could do is to serve him [Applause] you're not doing that for me you're doing that for yourself he deserves all the praise and the glory and i would know what to do if i wasn't serving the lord have riches have fancy cars swimming pool houses land and they get old gray they can't go in the swimming pool all the nice food eaten your body tastes loud taste you taste but not functioning properly and then all what you have has a degree and just feeling in memory and maybe alzheimer's attack and so on you remember in norway not remembering no one someone like that hear from help i don't want to be like that and you're grabbing grabby grabby grabby see what you're gonna get get this in your hand only doing like that never made an input in somebody's life never made a deposit into another human being of value never put a treasure inside a deer to encourage somebody along the right path amen amen all you have is things that is my stereo that is my headphone that is my couch that is my chair that is my church is that right i thought jesus built any church anyhow and all people expressing as possession that is my dress we call it again um ralph lauren or some polo i don't know names i don't have time with that some kind of fancy name reebok nike i know my shoes the other old shoes because we bought just behind a new one you think you're working the elitists and they walk with a bump because you're working with elites and that done all already because when you buy that we both don't make an excellent already coming out because i want to keep on buying keep on buying keep on keep on buying i have no money you know but they keep on buying they can't put their offering but they keep on buying they can't pay attention they keep on buying they come by looking good panty cologne smelling good too but all that's all about you nice shirt expensive shirt it's all about you don't talk about the shoes ooh shiny i'm not looking at anybody's foot tonight it's all about you but consider jesus consider how god left glory consider how he was patient with the disciples consider how he went through with them consider the good he did and how he hated him consider he went all the way and said father forgive them consider he pricey paid to love you and to reach you and can't we do that for each other can't you go the extra mile can't you reach out a little deeper can't you extend yourself to somebody who would even care for you have somebody who you know wouldn't help you and can't you do that without looking for a reward you're just doing what is right you're doing what is kind you're doing what is true you're doing what is loyal you're doing is faithful god remembers those things god sees those things that's why god said not 100 people will cross over except joshua and caleb what did joshua caleb said he said this city land is a good land go back and read the script in 14 damn fellas cry they rent the garment they say oh god the land is a good land they're telling the people that it will change your attitude change your pictures god didn't tell them listen kill and talk that talk no they was in their heart it was in their heart they loved god amen ten other ministers brought to every report if you take that today people will support the 10 ministers because that's a big number it's telling them saying the same thing they're all saying the same thing who knows those two things they are this is different it's easy to believe teachings and doctrines than to believe the promise of dynamics because the bible says people have itchiness silly women leading with lust keeping on themselves teachers having itchiness there's itching to get more mysteries more revelation more interpretation itchiness because the promise looking long they're looking hard because you ought to prepare yourself for it amen the promise of the father it's the promise of the holy ghost the promise of dynamics and i am preaching until it come to pass [Applause] if you're tired here in dynamics i'm sorry for you because i will be preaching it and preaching it and preaching it because one day the rain is going to fall you didn't know i was entirely 120 years was the message it will rain but you know what the evidence of he believed in that the accused villain if no one say it will rain are we doing about it there we go who knows but noah's building white prophesying building pressing building it's gonna rain power gonna come dynamic's gonna come it's gonna rain what about already the same message you preached that's the president tell me you leave here i'm preaching the same message you're preaching to light of course i preaching light i'm not a heavy preacher i don't have a message on my own i preach in another man's message william branham is the prophet i am a prophet god didn't say to you the prophet i am not a prophet in case you thought i was no i don't amen i am not presuming amen i am hold on to dusty at the lord because this is what the prophet brought god said the lord oh hallelujah okay let me just skip down now so but i'm safer man watch get this the church is supposed to be predestined to adoption of children where a man a man can god can take a man adopt him to the family and give him something first try that a man came last night pilfer pay over my home angel on one side angela and one inside and whatnot and the fun thing said you're here not text money just your insulin the first thing to do what try that not take that and run with it oh you have one person say did you try it he said try it all i don't want to say oh i want to try it oh i want to hear nice things then you'll be deceived this is the word here the man claims a certain thing try it try it and see if it is right if it is right move right with it and say lord send us something else isn't that right so i want you to understand you have to suffer a reproach for the revealed word mary edwards suffer a reproach for testifying she's gonna have a christ she's gonna have a son she's gonna have a baby and she'll know no man isn't that right no presuming that what presumably mean taking things for granted venture with authority isn't that right don't go quickly but abraham they were presuming they were right because they had priests and their synagogues if it doesn't matter whether truth or error whether what we do how we live what we preach it doesn't matter listen to this why did god let six thousand years of suffering and perils and death strike the human race if he just didn't let eve get by with one little misconcept word he is a god of anger he's a god of justice he's a god of holiness he said what if i was on the street he said no watch talk about love could you imagine having a little boy i say honey just go ahead if you want to drink that liquor you're six year old boy daddy won't stop you i love you too much if you want to take my shotgun with two shells on it and hammerlock i love you too much to stop you bob said that ain't love what if he was out in the street daddy i want to make mud pies out there where cars are going 60 miles an hour down the street i love you too much honey to stop you you want to do that i know it daddy loves you too much well go go and get killed you're going to get killed your child wants to make mud pies in the middle of the road he will get killed he said no watch a real daddy will shut the height over him that's the matter today you're trying to preach the gospel with soft gloves on priesthood is all right here we go i'm gonna finish israel here presumed that they were all right they went up they said why we are the people of god god come again egypt sent this prophet donald with a pill of fire brought us up here slew feel right before us smoke the land with plagues flies heal upon the land protected us glory to god hallelujah that what they're saying and as we come to the red sea here come pharaoh god open the red sea by his mighty power we march to the red sea god love us so much that he turned and said look around at your enemy i'll drunk behind you not only that he sent us angel food fell every night and that prophet said and the will of the lord said don't you go up there if you do god won't be with you but they presumed that they go up anyhow god is too good you know god love us pentecost don't ever get in your head woman i can bub my hair i can do this i can do that god heal me one time god give me the holders one time that's right but don't you trespass that divine in line i'm going to tell you sin lays beyond the boundaries of god's word listen stay with the word look didn't jude said earnestly content for the fate 1896 they already got away from it i'm skipping on quickly oh praise the name of the lord are you with me now watch that tree started growing what happened the church was cut down and the tree started growing what did it do they organized it got cut down the branch off it withered died like jesus said he pruned it upcoming wesley another branch coming on it what did he do organized god put listen there's god's tree but as they organized he cut it off who did it not the devil got cut at all that's not what he wants and the chief is pushing up you keep cutting it off guanine will cut people in this message he will once they're gone they would cut him off because of the blessing of duty fountain same god same god people claim to be serving same god with testimonies you have to continue to save god but imam said this way he said a lot of ministers and i'm saying this think that they no longer have to save god they get so secure with the congregation they feel they could do anything and get away with it afterwards they feel secure there's so much people that have beaten elder they feel secure and everything else that they started little making small sin little small thing here and afterwards god leave them they don't even know the church is void of god yes it have sermons yes it's not scriptures yes they have thoughts but where is the living god among the people amen hallelujah it does not solve it it doesn't put us on a throne each one have to serve god daily the elders in here the deacons in here the ushers is here god hates abuse abuse of authority abuse of position that is why god have to give people character and test first before putting them in a power humbles people to see what's in their heart so god keep cutting it off i don't want to read something here look how buddha brown bring it who came face johnny baptist preaching what repentance who come next jesus christ and he put jesus on a signification second move amazing father satisfied them to the truth what come next the baptism of the holy ghost john kepler bought what repentance jesus brought signification and then the holy ghost that he said if i don't go holy ghost will not come i have to go for the holy ghost to come isn't that right so therefore after the word is the spirit elohim came down with flesh on him and gave abraham a fresh promise i will return to the according time of life no more flesh coming back again a spirit to come so the spirit is what is promised you have to wait for it do you believe that so watch along the church ages here 14 minutes come the first one what it took the fruit of broadly love took it off next thing conquer worm the leaves of fellowship suck the very life out of it we have too much of god as a good god he loved me too much to punish me he promised he loved adam he loved eve he is love but he has to keep his word oh praise god god never does deal with a group he does with an individual israel presumed he was just so good they seen so many things that they could do they wanted to do isn't like a teenage boy that's the way the church is today they feel well god give me the holy ghost if i want to do this i can do this that goes to show it's not there if you was in christ you'll hold to his word regardless amen do you believe that don't presume don't venture without authority samson presume i ain't got lux anymore i presume i'm the same old guy i went something shake himself no power was there hallelujah watch what did we do the revival started 14 years ago penny castle found out she couldn't stretch herself no more because she organized the little groups and hated one another they chose people sold discord among brethren and the revival struck it the evening like come in what did she do she couldn't do nothing because she organized she lost her strength her brother love the fruit of the spirit i'm almost done listen closely samson thought he is still here you better be feeling he's still here a contort when he took the wedge it won't be noticed a preacher said to me brother branham doesn't make a difference whether it's this way or that way sure it makes a difference that's the very lie that satan told eve it does make a difference well as long as the rest of them does it i don't care who does it or who doesn't do it i don't want to do it anyhow i am not presuming that's all right because the rest of them does it god requires this and this is what i've got to have amen i am not presuming about nothing adam said i won't be noticed it don't make a difference but it did make a difference it can aikon said it won't be noticed it will make a difference but it did make a difference that one little wedge upset the whole program of god oh hallelujah you see what brown went on to say now a confession is a stone you should i confess jesus christ i confess to believe the message but you need us to miss him to shape you you need to be shaped your confession of believing but abraham is not good enough your confession of believing jesus christ is not good enough now you come to church to get as pastors told mason to blossom crack on your stone to shape you he said into the image of the son of god oh hallelujah you said watch noah okay almost done hallelujah wow whoa noah take my time my brother take my time oh hallelujah noah's time they presumed if it come like a flood ignore well the only thing they will do is jump in their own boat them say they have their own boat they could jump in it but there was only one boat that was god constructed i believe i belong to the church i do this i do that but there's only one group that god constructed and that is not a denominational construction it's the word construction revelation of his power constructed the boat you see god give a revelation to noah was build a boat of in wood now wood is a soft wood an absorbent wood any intellectual phd person here that revelation will say it's false because that would go to sync but god tell him that word because god has a further revelation to attack that revelation god go in and put pitch on the outside and pitch on the inside to seal the boat and that is the wood to absorb the ceiling that is the wood to absorb the ceiling and the seven thunders is the wood to absorb the spirit the seven thunders is the mechanics and charity is the dynamics oh hallelujah hallelujah so you may be seated so the seven thunders is supposed to strip us of self strip us to nothing strip us like in wood that god descend the spirit and seal it on the inside and steal it on the outside and the devil has no path with me oh i feel good though oh hallelujah that was the footage of revelation that quote was on the brick toneur [Music] oh man watch god constructed watch so many prophets today telling so many different things get the people confused don't presume just watch for the vindicated promise let's go there you are pentecostal missed about a million miles you went after sensation instead of waiting for the world to be fulfilled it is always the leaders that get the people out of the will of god what it was korra it was an uninspired leader him all this thing is the only man didn't god put the spirit of prophecy upon all these people took it over moses and put it here so we just listened to this group moses think he is something god told moses separate yourself watch moses was god leader moses was vindicated to be that leader all that didn't listen to him perish jesus was god's leader the holy ghost is the leader and all that don't obey the holy ghost who wrote this bible will perish so you know who the leader is right now the holy ghost not some man from anywhere else it's the holy ghost he was sent to lead the church isn't that right now jesus said wait he said isaiah 26 11 said precept must be upon precept isn't that right watch then no listen peter jumped in and said wait a few minutes watch skipping fast hallelujah he said peter's had to preach the very next day he preached on joel in the upper room when he recognized people struggling to hold on peter come next time preach on joel he said it shall come to pass in the last days i'll report my spirit and so forth they were waiting they wasn't presuming they had anything they were waiting until the scripture was made manifest oh brother i wish it wasn't this late we would like to stay a little bit they waited for scriptural authority because the scripture said how it will come you can't imagine how we're gonna come the scripture talk about the power the scripture talk about how it's gonna come let's talk about tears my spirit flowing freely come on see him and somebody the scripture speaks about it do you believe that now watch moses one time presumed without a witness without an experience he heard words that he was to be a liver but he didn't have the call he didn't have the experience so he presumed that he could go and take over oh hallelujah and you know i'm the moses he killed one man and run because he presumed that because he is supposed to be deliverer because his mother told him what god told her he had a second hand hearing god never talked to him he didn't hear direct from god so moses went in the power of his intellect to try to deliver the people and he failed big time he failed big time but when that pill on fire when that fire in the burning bush when that struck moses there was no feeling now more than just say ain't no stopping me now i'm going straight down to phil i'm going to tell him let my people go i'm anointed i'm commissioned i heard from god met the pillar of fire had an experience with god who could stop a man that has met that pillar of fire oh glory people oh hallelujah hallelujah glory glory hallelujah glory to god praise god praise god look at that i'm closing with this music is gone please but abraham this in obedience this doesn't fit woman that's you that's the bride i'm talking about that lives by faith the bride watch she is believes the word of god that's the bride obedient that's the bride written in love that's the bride for the promise of the age to be confirmed she is watching for it she is part of that word she is watching for her life to manifest the word brethren can't you see that i hope that didn't go over you the body is written for which is the word waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm it or make it alive she is waiting for it get his bomb no other life would work in her hallelujah no other life will work in her she can't come to life any other way we can't put hidden mysteries on peter in the life she has got to get dynamics that is why there's a fifo ministry yet because of the dynamics to bring forth the fifo ministry i am contending for it i will preach it till i die because this is the truth the pillar of fire will be veiled in the abducted songs oh there are going to be some adopted sons oh glory hallelujah hallelujah watch watch yet she feels this out there she know it's going to happen and then it happens then she wakes up hallelujah children of disobedience disobedience means rebellion i look that up in a dictionary rebellion rebellion against what the revealed word of god like cain rebelled against abel's revealed revelation vindicated of god that it was righteous the pharisees were the only nominational knowledge of what the word was selected hand-picked men rebelled against the vindicated word of god being manifest for that day pharisees and the handpicked men oh my what is that eternal disobedience rebellion against the word of god see where they act these are miraculous past jesus christ is not the same oh hallelujah god is not mocked just remember don't worry god is not mock
