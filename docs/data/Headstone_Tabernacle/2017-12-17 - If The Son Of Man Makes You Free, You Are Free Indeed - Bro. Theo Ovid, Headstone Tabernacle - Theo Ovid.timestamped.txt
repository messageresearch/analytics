[1:25:58] into Monday so we had never Sunday
[1:26:00] morning service that all years D that
[1:26:03] would be Sunday itself so the night will
[1:26:07] have a midnight service the ten o'clock
[1:26:08] service at night so remember us in
[1:26:12] prayer I appreciate that special this
[1:26:14] morning heart of
[1:26:18] um I'm brother Brannan and Jesus said
[1:26:22] that the hour come where the true
[1:26:23] worshipers will worship the father in
[1:26:26] spirit and in truth and it was one thing
[1:26:29] to have spirit but then the truth is
[1:26:31] what was lost through the ages and God
[1:26:34] sent a prophet to gather the scattered
[1:26:36] wood to bring back truths when he got a
[1:26:40] disgusted wood that word now can bring
[1:26:42] down the Holy Ghost but the object of
[1:26:44] God is was going above us go to with us
[1:26:47] and know God in us the object of God is
[1:26:51] to come into his people so God has not
[1:26:54] content to be around you he wants to be
[1:26:56] in you look to your eyes and speak to
[1:26:59] your lips to check your life remember
[1:27:02] you are not just a single being your
[1:27:05] triune being body spirit and soul
[1:27:07] remember that God wants you to be a twin
[1:27:11] like a dual being one on the earth and
[1:27:14] one in the spirit many times we are not
[1:27:17] conscious of how much things happen in
[1:27:19] the spirit realm and we have to become
[1:27:21] people that are tuned to the spirit
[1:27:23] realm not just natural things and you
[1:27:25] want to have a scripture and a coat and
[1:27:27] know you want that we understand in the
[1:27:29] spirit realm you want understanding what
[1:27:31] spirit is sent against you what's coming
[1:27:34] to challenge you will come and affect
[1:27:35] your home and family and your whole
[1:27:37] situation environment around you it is
[1:27:39] spirits and demon powers and you cannot
[1:27:42] fight demon powers with natural things
[1:27:44] you kind of find demon powers with
[1:27:46] physical things you have to have the
[1:27:47] authority Authority to fight back what
[1:27:50] the devil's a loose but we have a
[1:27:53] scripture whenever the enemy come in
[1:27:55] like a flood the Spirit of God always be
[1:27:59] is a standard God must have a witness
[1:28:01] somewhere God must have 7000 they have
[1:28:05] not bowed and needs to bear one time

[1:41:02] this and tell us about people on what
[1:41:03] that I never did that that's not why I
[1:41:06] see the pulpit is for I see the pulpit
[1:41:08] of the place to speak truth because this
[1:41:11] is what will help you it's not about me
[1:41:13] and my personality is about what the
[1:41:16] prophets said I am out of the picture I
[1:41:19] have no opinion and feelings about it if

[1:41:44] truth shall make you free they answered
[1:41:47] him we be Abraham's seed and were never
[1:41:50] in bondage to any man who says though
[1:41:54] you shall be made free jesus answered
[1:41:58] them verily verily I say unto you
[1:42:01] whosoever committeth sin is the servant
[1:42:04] of sin and the servant abideth not in
[1:42:08] the house forever but the son our body
[1:42:11] forever if the son therefore shall make
[1:42:15] you free
[1:42:16] you shall be free indeed revelation is
[1:42:20] up two to one I read from verse 12 under
[1:42:27] the angel of the church in Pergamos
[1:42:29] write these things saith he which had
[1:42:33] the sharp sword with two edges I know
[1:42:37] thy works and where thou dwellest even
[1:42:39] where Satan's seat is and thou holdest
[1:42:43] fast my name and has not denied my faith
[1:42:46] even in those days wherein Antipas was
[1:42:49] my faithful martyr who was slain among
[1:42:52] you with seat and to elect but I have a
[1:42:56] few things against thee because thou
[1:42:59] hast dere them that hold the doctrine of
[1:43:04] Balaam who taught Balak to class a
[1:43:08] stumbling block before the chin of
[1:43:09] Israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[1:43:11] idols and to commit fornication
[1:43:14] so as doubt them that hold the doctrine
[1:43:18] of the Nicolaitans which things I heat
[1:43:22] repent or else I will come unto thee
[1:43:26] quickly and will fight against them with
[1:43:29] the sword of my mouth he that ear let
[1:43:35] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:43:38] churches
[1:43:38] the him an over commit will I give to
[1:43:41] eat of the hidden manna and I will give
[1:43:43] him a white stone and in that stone a
[1:43:46] new name written which no man knoweth
[1:43:50] saving he that receiveth it let's pray
[1:43:53] father we thank you for your word now
[1:43:55] God may breathe life into it speak to
[1:43:57] our hearts we need to hear from you
[1:44:00] granted Father in Jesus and we ask it
[1:44:02] amen amen Yura be seated well this
[1:44:06] morning I have a title if the son of man
[1:44:14] make you free you are free indeed
[1:44:19] if the Sun Amon make you free you are
[1:44:22] free indeed of a subject the doctrine of
[1:44:28] the Nicolaitans another an inspiration
[1:44:32] he that had ear he that hath an ear let
[1:44:37] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:44:40] churches
[1:44:40] oh praise the name of the Lord but a
[1:44:44] brand speaking in a church age he says
[1:44:48] in verse 23
[1:44:49] I believe talk much in John 20:23 to
[1:44:52] speak in the disciples he said we father
[1:44:54] and son will come unto Him thus it is
[1:44:57] not it is it that is the Father Son and
[1:45:00] Holy Ghost all coming in at one time
[1:45:03] it is one person comprising the Godhead
[1:45:09] not truly it's just one the advent took
[1:45:14] place at Pentecost they an two comments
[1:45:17] of the Spirit just one the trouble is
[1:45:20] that people don't know the real truth
[1:45:21] and they simply believe in Jesus for the
[1:45:25] remission of sin but never go on to
[1:45:27] receive the Spirit before I close this
[1:45:30] subject I know there's a question in
[1:45:32] your minds you will want to know if I
[1:45:36] believe in the deduction of
[1:45:37] pre-existence I don't believe in that
[1:45:40] Mormon doctrine of pre existence of
[1:45:43] souls any more than I believe in
[1:45:46] reincarnation or transmigration of souls
[1:45:48] be careful here and see this listen it
[1:45:53] is not the person that comes
[1:45:57] predestinated eternally from God it is
[1:46:00] the word or the seed that it is that is
[1:46:05] in that that is it way back there too
[1:46:09] far from the human mind to grasp the
[1:46:11] eternal God with eternal towards thought
[1:46:15] and decreed Jacob I loved but Esau have
[1:46:18] I hated in Romans 9 13 Nita was born but
[1:46:23] neither had anger or evil see it was the
[1:46:25] thought and when that thought became
[1:46:28] Express God
[1:46:29] brought back Jacob because Jacob alone
[1:46:32] was seed so that seed is what
[1:46:35] predestinated that seed is what was
[1:46:38] eternal Jacob alone had the seed that is
[1:46:42] why he had respected a bit right and the
[1:46:46] Covenant of God and if you are a true
[1:46:49] seed you will hear that word the Spirit
[1:46:52] will baptize you into the body of Christ
[1:46:55] selling you and empowering you you will
[1:46:58] receive the word for your age and your
[1:47:01] deal you see o clear the true evidence
[1:47:04] becomes when the word is revealed to you
[1:47:07] though Jesus was the Royal seed like
[1:47:10] that no talking about seed jesus was
[1:47:13] what royal seed here we go he lived in
[1:47:16] the human body what living a human body
[1:47:19] this royal seed live in a body called
[1:47:22] Jesus okay the Lord a shout
[1:47:24] you heard it now this royal seed lived
[1:47:28] in that body
[1:47:29] Oh glory to God hallelujah and when the
[1:47:33] spirit called to him the word manifested
[1:47:38] thought he went to Jordan and was
[1:47:42] baptized in water upon of being the word
[1:47:45] the Baptist upon or being the way to the
[1:47:50] whole world and tackle you to the token
[1:47:52] upon obedience to the word he gives the
[1:47:56] spirit to them that obey Him do we a
[1:48:00] shout in the house do you hear somebody
[1:48:03] confirming what we are preaching this
[1:48:04] morning
[1:48:05] this is the Prophet upon obeying the
[1:48:08] word the Holy Spirit came upon him and
[1:48:11] the voice said this is my beloved son
[1:48:16] the voice did not say this has become my
[1:48:20] son Oh glory to God Jesus was the son
[1:48:25] but the Holy Ghost position him as the
[1:48:29] son before them all or give the Lord a
[1:48:33] shout that's why we said but a promise
[1:48:37] will pull him do the work of an
[1:48:38] evangelist and he had to wait on
[1:48:41] the Holy Ghost positionally and we have
[1:48:44] to wait until you are positionally
[1:48:46] pleased oh my so let me say it again the
[1:48:50] Holy Ghost before them all then haven't
[1:48:53] been filled us and the same pattern
[1:48:56] holds at Pentecost and ever after he
[1:48:58] went in and demonstrated revelation of
[1:49:02] God from go home I know glory to God now
[1:49:06] we have been constantly saying that the
[1:49:09] true evidence of being baptized with the
[1:49:11] Holy Ghost is for the believer to
[1:49:15] receive the word for the Iijima she
[1:49:16] lives let me show you clearly the seven
[1:49:20] ages sat for toleration two and three
[1:49:22] take the whole span of the fullness of
[1:49:26] the Gentiles so this seven ages that we
[1:49:29] talk about seven two changes completes
[1:49:31] the times of the Gentiles when the ages
[1:49:35] are over the Gentile times is finished
[1:49:37] right what this is the whole time in
[1:49:42] which God is dealing with the Gentiles
[1:49:45] unto salvation in every single age band
[1:49:49] none it says the very same thing in
[1:49:52] opening and closing a message to each
[1:49:54] church age on to the messenger Ephesus
[1:49:57] Smyrna Pergamum ty Tyra Sardis
[1:50:01] Philadelphia right these they see it he
[1:50:04] etc he has an ear let him singular hear
[1:50:11] what the Spirit says to the churches
[1:50:13] let's quality / notice here Jesus by the
[1:50:19] spirit in every age address himself to
[1:50:24] only one person relative to the word for
[1:50:28] that age only here we go one messenger
[1:50:33] for each age receives what the Spirit
[1:50:37] has to say for that age and that one
[1:50:42] messenger
[1:50:43] is the messenger to the true church God
[1:50:50] put a messenger and a half a messenger
[1:50:53] and another messenger is only one behold
[1:50:57] I said you Elijah the prophet and he
[1:51:00] shall turn back the hearts of the
[1:51:03] children or glory to God this messenger
[1:51:10] let's continue he speaks for God by
[1:51:13] revelation to the churches both true and
[1:51:17] false
[1:51:18] Oh give the Lord a shout all glory to
[1:51:22] God enough traditions in our forces but
[1:51:27] this messenger have to speak to booth
[1:51:29] okay the Lord will have to claim the
[1:51:32] messenger both have to believe the
[1:51:35] message born out to be claiming to
[1:51:37] preach a message but it is a true church
[1:51:39] and there's a false church or gives a
[1:51:41] lot praises people there's a true vein
[1:51:44] and there's a fault line and the
[1:51:46] prophecy when the bride by design meant
[1:51:52] could discern the two spirits were given
[1:51:56] the framing of the church and on my
[1:51:58] facebook puts page I put that coat and
[1:52:01] so you're asked what for discernment
[1:52:02] because you cannot withstand what you
[1:52:05] have not discerned when the bride could
[1:52:08] discern the two spirits in the church
[1:52:11] and by God's Spirit discern and
[1:52:14] withstand you can just is in it you have
[1:52:18] to withstand it that's what will kill
[1:52:20] you if you allow it or give the Lord
[1:52:24] some praises and not taking
[1:52:26] prisoners sit and look at the steel to
[1:52:29] rob and destroy
[1:52:34] did you hear that dough feels sorry for
[1:52:39] the devil and he appears I himself you
[1:52:44] have to steal robbing destroy
[1:52:46] he's a busy busy bandit oh yeah he could
[1:52:50] ship you off every write that you have
[1:52:52] yeah every blessing you strip you forget
[1:52:55] get a chance let's continue Oh glory he
[1:52:59] speaks the God by revelation to the
[1:53:02] churches which one falls the message is
[1:53:05] then broadcast to all but though it is
[1:53:08] broadcast for all who come within the
[1:53:11] range of the message that message is
[1:53:15] received individually by only a certain
[1:53:19] qualified group in a certain way or
[1:53:24] glory of God each individual of the
[1:53:28] group is one who has the ability to hear
[1:53:32] what the Spirit is saying by way of the
[1:53:37] messenger not by we have no faithful but
[1:53:41] we are the messenger
[1:53:43] [Applause]
[1:53:47] faithful and messenger not on the same
[1:53:49] class at all but a Branham didn't
[1:53:53] recommend but Abraham has the evening
[1:53:56] place as a fight for his place above
[1:53:59] that he plays as a major elijah prophet
[1:54:03] he was placed even to reveal son of man
[1:54:06] even - shall it be in the day when the
[1:54:09] Son of Man is revealed so he William
[1:54:12] Branham was a shallow man reveal indeed
[1:54:15] Shannon on so these phenomena words to
[1:54:19] the bride words of deliverance bullets
[1:54:22] of Zealand words of restoration so when
[1:54:25] we talk about shadow man setting you
[1:54:28] free this is the words of the son of man
[1:54:31] when you go back to the words of the son
[1:54:34] of man and that set you free you are
[1:54:37] free indeed no pasta no patient no
[1:54:42] faithful so-called
[1:54:44] good hold you back when the Son of Man
[1:54:47] set you free you shall know the truth
[1:54:51] and the truth is what gonna set you free
[1:54:55] [Applause]
[1:55:03] you don't want information you want
[1:55:07] fruit you know what information he want
[1:55:11] revelation
[1:55:15] ask God for revelation ask God for
[1:55:23] revelation that message is received
[1:55:26] individually by only a certain qualified
[1:55:29] group in a certain way each individual
[1:55:33] of that group is one who has the ability
[1:55:36] to hear what the Spirit is seen by way
[1:55:41] of the messenger there we go those who
[1:55:45] here are not getting their own private
[1:55:49] revelation nor is the group getting a
[1:55:54] collective revelation but each person is
[1:55:58] hearing and receiving what the messenger
[1:56:02] has already received from God so no man
[1:56:08] can come under no new teachings new
[1:56:12] revelations that the messenger every we
[1:56:17] deem them false and if the communis
[1:56:21] morning trivia you are false
[1:56:27] [Applause]
[1:56:39] were it again each person is hearing and
[1:56:45] receiving what the messenger has already
[1:56:48] received from God that was you're saying
[1:56:53] what the Tipsy you're seeing what the
[1:56:56] prophecy because he alone had the
[1:56:58] ability to hear what Jesus was saying to
[1:57:02] the churches so when Jesus tells the
[1:57:04] Prophet the top / tell us no man in
[1:57:10] between you didn't hear that there was
[1:57:15] no man in between now tink it not
[1:57:24] strange for this is the case of Paul
[1:57:27] said this pattern under the hand of God
[1:57:29] Paul alone
[1:57:31] had the full revelation for his day as
[1:57:35] evidenced by his confrontation of the
[1:57:38] other apostles who admitted that Paul
[1:57:43] was the prophet messenger to the
[1:57:45] Gentiles so Paul being a messenger could
[1:57:49] confront the Apostles because Paul was
[1:57:52] not a faithful minister or a faithful
[1:57:55] prophet
[1:57:55] Paul was a revealer of the Old Testament
[1:57:58] he had to go on the backside of the
[1:58:00] desert they haven't beaten them no
[1:58:02] they're from God Almighty
[1:58:04] I only come back from that he said any
[1:58:07] man since I'm spiritual let him
[1:58:09] acknowledge what I say is the
[1:58:12] commandments of God and if he's ignorant
[1:58:15] I am a painter wish I Paul a prisoner
[1:58:21] Jesus apostle to the Gentiles or give
[1:58:24] the Lord praise offer
[1:58:26] [Applause]
[1:58:31] one day I'm gonna meet that man
[1:58:34] hallelujah I'm gonna meet that
[1:58:36] hook-nosed dude
[1:58:37] hallelujah add hot tempered you I'm
[1:58:40] gonna meet that man called Paul old
[1:58:43] glory to God Paul is within us what a
[1:58:47] Branham is waiting on us
[1:58:48] this just have to come to perfection to
[1:58:52] bring the resurrection
[1:58:53] [Applause]
[1:58:58] [Music]
[1:58:59] Oh glory will be seated in every age we
[1:59:06] have the same pattern that is why the
[1:59:10] light comes true some god-given
[1:59:13] messenger in certain area and then from
[1:59:18] that messenger get spreads the light
[1:59:22] through the ministry of others who have
[1:59:26] been faithfully taught one man gets the
[1:59:30] light resent the light like how Habakkuk
[1:59:34] say write the vision write the vision
[1:59:36] then other ministries come to make it
[1:59:38] plain that's you the people might see it
[1:59:41] run or give the Lord some princess do
[1:59:46] you see where I'm preaching this morning
[1:59:47] the Prophet came and write the vision
[1:59:50] then make it plain and butter balancer
[1:59:55] this way I hope that God raised up men
[1:59:59] to make more sense to what I am
[2:00:02] preaching and who only hits in the
[2:00:05] highlights but me men come and bring it
[2:00:08] into written authority
[2:00:10] so as we near the coming of the Lord

[2:20:39] name by Jesus what does that B is before
[2:20:43] Jesus so you get it how carefully must
[2:20:52] be the year one voice for the spirit has
[2:20:55] but one voice which is the voice of God
[2:20:59] and Paul warned them to say what he said
[2:21:04] even as Peter did likewise he warned
[2:21:08] them Aereo that even Paul prophet Paul
[2:21:15] could not change one word of what he
[2:21:20] given by revelation Paul cannot even
[2:21:25] come back and say you know I should have
[2:21:26] change it so I wanna change he can do

[2:22:14] you are a Christian you will get back to
[2:22:19] what the Spirit is teaching that is the
[2:22:23] world of his age save a pastor decides

[2:22:28] name of God that could be a fallen angel
[2:22:33] did you hear what I just said if a
[2:22:36] pastor choose to play for the Branham
[2:22:39] teams in this church how in God's name
[2:22:42] that could be a fallen angel that is
[2:22:45] impossible
[2:22:47] that is impossible
[2:22:50] the only way we could come up to the
[2:22:52] tips and what the Prophet said is the
[2:22:53] gather people back to the word because
[2:23:01] of wood is a plumb line you know the
[2:23:03] plumb line is is what the tradesmen use
[2:23:05] a weight with a string on it to see how
[2:23:09] straight it is so you're building the

[2:25:57] you
[2:26:27] the cry of every edge is the rebuke you
[2:26:31] have left the word repent come back to
[2:26:35] the word from the first book of Genesis
[2:26:38] to the last of the revelation there's
[2:26:39] only one reason for God's displeasure
[2:26:43] leaving the word and there's only one
[2:26:46] remedy to gain favor back to the word
[2:26:52] [Applause]
[2:26:53] scripture acts 20 verse 27 to 30 says
[2:26:58] Paul speaking I have not shunned to
[2:27:00] declare unto you all the counsel of God
[2:27:06] take heed therefore unto yourselves unto
[2:27:09] all the flock over which the Holy Ghost
[2:27:12] hath made you overseers to feed the
[2:27:16] Church of God which he had purchased
[2:27:19] with his own blood for I know this after
[2:27:25] mighty battle this is profit Paul
[2:27:27] speaking shall Grievous wolves enter in
[2:27:32] among you not sparing the flock prophesy
[2:27:39] and Paul also of your own selves men
[2:27:45] shall arise not Saddam men gonna sit
[2:27:49] down and and cool yourself no all gone
[2:27:52] you see when him when a dog on it and
[2:27:54] when when he kept burning most horribly
[2:27:56] right so Paul gone men rise speaking put
[2:28:05] for these things to draw away disciples
[2:28:10] after them the object of speaking things
[2:28:13] so people know what Paul speak I'd never
[2:28:17] hear that so you have more where that
[2:28:18] come from
[2:28:20] then at occasion like that
[2:28:25] that's not a new way to mix wheat bread
[2:28:28] you know that is that once is not what
[2:28:31] Paul said it is deafness guys with with
[2:28:36] reasons on it but O'Bannon was
[2:28:49] interpreting this scripture he said also
[2:28:52] of your own selves watch that man could
[2:28:54] look don't you and see the thing coming
[2:28:56] of your own cells mentioned arise
[2:28:58] because of those things to draw away
[2:28:59] disciples after them years later a bunch
[2:29:05] of men that want to make an organization
[2:29:08] take the sacredness and the holy spirit
[2:29:12] away from the church and push it on
[2:29:16] bishops and Pope's and priests that deal
[2:29:21] be holy and the congregation live any
[2:29:23] way they want to they pay the priests
[2:29:26] and he'll pray them out to hell and it's
[2:29:30] nichole eaten now listen let me see
[2:29:32] and God said he hated it God hits an
[2:29:38] organization now you see watch don't you
[2:29:42] the church if it don't do that he hits
[2:29:45] an organization he that hath an ear let
[2:29:47] him hear what the Spirit says to the
[2:29:49] churches
[2:29:50] no Paul wolves he said wolves are coming
[2:29:54] right has become Nicole Eaton
[2:30:00] so the Wolves come to bring doctrines
[2:30:03] and teachings put for the stuff attract
[2:30:07] people onto themselves their ministry I
[2:30:10] have the angel connect to the angel but
[2:30:15] I want to tell you there are two engines
[2:30:17] I want to call it angel II and Angel we
[2:30:28] will get down into it shortly these two
[2:30:31] angels represent two sides two forces
[2:30:35] two spirits 1/8 from above and one B
[2:30:40] from below but we don't get down into it
[2:30:42] Oh glory to God so pause wolves become
[2:30:47] nickel eaten they were trying to form a
[2:30:50] priesthood a little priesthood not a
[2:30:53] china forma a faithful priesthood to
[2:30:55] rule over man they're saying Jesus
[2:30:59] ministry no because Jesus had come at
[2:31:01] the rule nobody Jesus if thou be
[2:31:04] hallelujah Jesus said do you want to
[2:31:07] remain whole just as a gentleman jesus
[2:31:10] said behold I stand at the door and
[2:31:12] knock
[2:31:13] jekima say I am your boss you know not
[2:31:18] Jesus hallelujah
[2:31:21] so watch the Wooden Nickel the Greek
[2:31:23] word Nick oh I wish my time
[2:31:26] it's a conquer and overcome the laity
[2:31:29] the Holy Spirit to conquer the Holy
[2:31:32] Spirit to conquer the laity to take out
[2:31:36] of the church the resurrected Lord Jesus
[2:31:39] with signs and wonders among the
[2:31:42] believers and put men voted in to be
[2:31:46] Pope cardinal overseer to take the Holy
[2:31:50] Ghost away from the laity and give it to
[2:31:53] order a holy order men placing
[2:31:58] themselves over the lady
[2:32:03] this is now converted into well the fake
[2:32:06] fight over men who want to be in charge
[2:32:08] of other churches these guys hit this
[2:32:14] ability of the local church I talked
[2:32:17] that some brothers and estates I said
[2:32:19] decision train I I said as a sovereign
[2:32:20] Church and if brother hit the table
[2:32:23] where we were dining and said we should
[2:32:26] not go back to serenity it will break
[2:32:29] the unity then I knew they were off the
[2:32:31] word because sovereignty is the word and
[2:32:35] I say there is no unity without serenity
[2:32:39] you have to respect what a man is doing
[2:32:41] respect that there was no fight for over
[2:32:43] no church the faithful ministry is for a
[2:32:46] specific purpose for the perfecting of
[2:32:48] the saints I've never said one run
[2:32:50] churches is for the work of the ministry
[2:32:53] where is that ministry
[2:32:54] it's very any fan of the body I'm before
[2:32:56] a man could get into that fight for
[2:32:57] ministry you have to past you before
[2:33:03] Jesus had these ministries what ready
[2:33:04] Jesus go the spirit let Jesus into the
[2:33:11] wilderness it wasn't a Minister
[2:33:13] Association to come Jesus who we are all
[2:33:15] one the spirit let price into the
[2:33:20] wilderness and he overcome the lust of
[2:33:22] the eyes the overcome the lusts of the
[2:33:24] flesh he overcome the pride of life in
[2:33:26] other words he overcome himself and
[2:33:28] before God to give a man power he has to
[2:33:31] be able to overcome himself could we
[2:33:36] give the Lord a shout
[2:33:37] [Applause]
[2:33:40] people want power over others and acai
[2:33:42] hop over itself so not to call em
[2:33:51] pastors with mean Shepherd but I'm sorry
[2:33:53] first timothy 4:1 now the spirit
[2:33:57] speaketh expressly that in the latter
[2:34:00] times some shall depart from the feet
[2:34:06] and we already see some that want pom I
[2:34:10] mean he's like Isis they gone extreme
[2:34:14] they go on had a terrorist level I kid
[2:34:18] you not I'm not freaking out over there
[2:34:20] I'm a person display with words I don't
[2:34:22] I'm not any word game thing okay some
[2:34:25] shall depart from the faith giving heed
[2:34:28] to seducing spirits and doctrines of
[2:34:32] devils
[2:34:34] second Timothy four one two five says I
[2:34:36] charge thee therefore before God under
[2:34:39] Lord Jesus who shall judge the quick and
[2:34:41] the dead and his appearing and his
[2:34:43] kingdom preach the word be instant in
[2:34:46] season out of season reprove rebuke
[2:34:49] exhort with all long-suffering and
[2:34:52] doctrine for the time will come prophecy
[2:34:54] where they will not end your song
[2:34:58] doctrine but after their own lusts shall
[2:35:01] they heap to themselves teachers having
[2:35:03] itching ears and they shall turn away
[2:35:06] their ears from the truth what did we
[2:35:09] preach last week you shall know the
[2:35:11] truth and the truth will set you free
[2:35:14] they're going to tell it on the truth
[2:35:15] and shall be turned unto fables but
[2:35:18] watch thou in all things endure
[2:35:20] afflictions do the work of an evangelist
[2:35:23] make full proof of thy ministry or
[2:35:26] praise the name of the Lord
[2:35:28] what about I'm sayin if those churches
[2:35:30] are fine people but it's the system that
[2:35:33] binds them it's not the church itself
[2:35:35] it's the people in the church it's the
[2:35:38] system behind that binds them put them
[2:35:40] into a place and brick or fellowship
[2:35:42] they won't let them go on with God what
[2:35:44] about beautiful thing and God heats not
[2:35:46] the people in there but the sister
[2:35:48] that is Bynum is what he hits it's that
[2:35:52] organization that tells them if they go
[2:35:55] to another church they're going to be
[2:35:57] excommunicated cut off and the people
[2:36:01] don't know what to do but we're around
[2:36:02] said they were peaceful it's Sunday and
[2:36:04] these brothers that's showing these
[2:36:06] false doctrines and false teaching about
[2:36:09] you are a Holy Ghost and all kind of
[2:36:10] foolish and contrary and prefer things
[2:36:12] they will be judged one of these days or
[2:36:15] you have to pivot oh it's the enemy with
[2:36:18] this revelation and hell - oh yes
[2:36:20] damnable heresies oh praise the name of
[2:36:22] the Lord glory to God when I'm talking
[2:36:25] about Jonah he said we are not going to
[2:36:28] the shift of dashes we got a duty before
[2:36:31] God he said as a message we are
[2:36:33] responsible for I am responsible to tell
[2:36:37] you the truth and I am NOT going to tell
[2:36:40] you nothing but the truth as long as God
[2:36:42] let me know what the truth is or glory
[2:36:45] to God not to deceive you not to try off
[2:36:48] but to tell you the truth I hope I am
[2:36:51] duty-bound to a message that he given to
[2:36:53] me from a mighty God but around words
[2:36:55] and I hope that you will understand if
[2:36:57] you disagree with me on these messages
[2:36:58] and things you remember at least have
[2:37:00] this respect that I have a
[2:37:02] responsibility and I'm not going to
[2:37:04] Tasha SHhhh I'm on my road to Nineveh
[2:37:06] have got the cry out Oh glory to God
[2:37:10] could you take a little more
[2:37:12] so this pull almost become the seat of
[2:37:14] Satan Babylon was the seat how did it
[2:37:17] become the seat of Satan when Babylon
[2:37:19] fell to the Medes and Persians the
[2:37:22] priest king Attalus fled the city I went
[2:37:24] to Potamus with his priests and sacred
[2:37:27] mysteries oh you didn't know that
[2:37:33] Lucifer has some sacred mysteries yes he
[2:37:38] does his priest was packing it sacred
[2:37:43] mysteries mysteries from Hell but around
[2:37:47] say one time all the world believed in
[2:37:49] one God
[2:37:50] then it came to the three gods and the
[2:37:53] tree has one person and what not and
[2:37:54] then mysteriously he said father son the
[2:37:58] patrolman for father with a sick of a
[2:38:00] son
[2:38:01] and Holy Spirit they end up sticking a
[2:38:03] woman inside idea and put Mary dear
[2:38:06] brother that a revelation father son and
[2:38:09] bride is the Godhead good imagine father
[2:38:13] son and bride he do the same thing them
[2:38:15] did back there this take a woman side
[2:38:18] idea father son and pride God said let
[2:38:21] us make man you mean God Father Son and
[2:38:25] bride say let us make man that's so
[2:38:27] confusing that not even so an
[2:38:30] intelligent it's something kinda real
[2:38:33] foolish is only one Lord
[2:38:36] but around said the Godhead is settled
[2:38:39] it is scared he's definitely got head no
[2:38:42] tree persons one God a man come and flip
[2:38:45] the card upside down and say you know
[2:38:47] what is a hidden mystery it's father-son
[2:38:49] and brain nobody ever pre that that is
[2:38:55] one of these secret mysteries
[2:38:56] [Music]
[2:38:59] God give that one think about it now he
[2:39:04] said the Father Son and Holy Ghost these
[2:39:06] three are all glory of God gives a lot
[2:39:12] of show
[2:39:15] Father Son and Holy Ghost Istria these
[2:39:18] trees are yellow Israel the Lord our God
[2:39:20] is one Lord
[2:39:22] don't bring no primary third-person
[2:39:25] electricity false teachers false
[2:39:31] revelation so the priests set up a
[2:39:36] kingdom outside the Roman Empire and
[2:39:38] strived under the care of the devil so
[2:39:44] you'd ever have care to the care his
[2:39:49] priests he makes sure his priests get
[2:39:52] covered already let me go the false vine
[2:39:58] was telling Lucius anger against the
[2:39:59] Living God by killing the elect
[2:40:02] even as Cain killed Abel the true church
[2:40:07] kept trying to get the first church to
[2:40:10] repent it's not the other way around
[2:40:15] the true church trying to get the first
[2:40:18] church to repent it would not do so it
[2:40:21] increase in science and influence and by
[2:40:25] Rama influences then we take the name of
[2:40:27] the Lord use it anyway prophesy on it
[2:40:29] when means nothing but some panel
[2:40:31] inference and so forth and see things
[2:40:33] have never happened and act like it
[2:40:35] never pay any attention as if you say
[2:40:37] something honestly it didn't happen you
[2:40:38] say if you say something and it didn't
[2:40:41] happen who repent and tell it that you
[2:40:44] were wrong then your influence will come
[2:40:47] back that the man is honest but there's
[2:40:51] no reference they seem to be that we can
[2:40:53] just do anything in the Lord I get by
[2:40:54] with it as long as we belong to certain
[2:40:57] group so these brothers for 2010-2011
[2:40:59] didn't want to repent because they want
[2:41:01] to know how it will look for the five
[2:41:02] whole ministry how they go look really
[2:41:05] good because I look honest because I
[2:41:08] recognize a wrong Spirit came and
[2:41:09] brought the wrong prophecy wrong
[2:41:11] teaching Oh hallelujah Oh glory to God
[2:41:16] amen praise the name of the Lord so we
[2:41:19] see the two angels injured a I call it
[2:41:21] injure B
[2:41:25] who me talk about the GB virus already
[2:41:26] right so a is representing Arkansas
[2:41:30] representing the image of the Lord a
[2:41:31] represent above angel B represent
[2:41:34] belzebub represent the angel that once
[2:41:38] was in heaven man skip down or below
[2:41:39] this B angel is the one that was working
[2:41:41] with Brunel writing underworld false
[2:41:44] prophecies as an angel that two angels
[2:41:47] Harlan for question the B angel I was
[2:41:51] working 2010-2011 where did it go all
[2:41:54] that question think about it but a
[2:41:57] Branham says watch how close it gets
[2:41:59] that razor-edged this some trying to do
[2:42:02] God a service or status pingos will
[2:42:03] between right and wrong a reason edge
[2:42:06] between right and wrong remember it will
[2:42:09] fall on one or the other side till it
[2:42:12] comes down sometime like a hone razor
[2:42:15] between the difference of right and
[2:42:18] wrong
[2:42:19] it's got to be every word of God not
[2:42:22] just almost every word but every word is
[2:42:25] cut down today not the Lutheran's not
[2:42:28] the Methodists not the Pentecostal but
[2:42:31] that I warn edge with this edge where
[2:42:34] the Antichrist anointed so perfectly it
[2:42:36] would deceive the very elect 'add they
[2:42:39] will fall on the wrong side is there
[2:42:41] none watch it like a wedge watch be
[2:42:44] careful we are not living in the
[2:42:46] Pentacles of each now we are past that
[2:42:48] age Oh glory to God amen hallelujah
[2:42:52] praise God so the devil job was a set up
[2:42:56] a hierarchy of ministers try to
[2:42:59] controlling their own way complete
[2:43:03] influence isn't that right hallelujah
[2:43:07] setting up and maintaining a system that
[2:43:09] is contrary to God's plan and program
[2:43:12] hallelujah praise God you cannot reject
[2:43:16] and deny the sovereignty of the local
[2:43:18] church a little brother dogmas of any
[2:43:19] local church but you just talking that
[2:43:21] talk he the respect he given that the
[2:43:24] whole but not respected at all his
[2:43:28] behavior and action tells otherwise but
[2:43:31] you have to see certain things people to
[2:43:32] believe that you really believe that oh
[2:43:34] my I go all since 2013 I've been
[2:43:37] hammering
[2:43:38] because of my experience with bread -
[2:43:40] Lucy we should not go back to
[2:43:41] sovereignty 2013 Germany after preach
[2:43:43] about serenity of local church and I
[2:43:45] believe that that's why I am in nobody's
[2:43:47] Church business I am NOT just business
[2:43:49] at all I do interfere my want to do so
[2:43:51] and so on so up to this morning
[2:43:53] people asked me a question about what we
[2:43:54] do in here up there this morning on the
[2:43:56] internet after answer I say the truth is
[2:43:58] sovereign you chacorta's yourself you
[2:44:00] fine fall fine photo watchers are open
[2:44:02] church people looking in the people and
[2:44:04] again music and drums this that they
[2:44:06] wanna find this and I said well to
[2:44:07] uncheck about yourself
[2:44:10] Oh glory to God are we ready for some
[2:44:15] more for the most he said by this stage
[2:44:18] we have two churches bearing the same
[2:44:20] name but with a bit of difference
[2:44:22] between them one has he parted from the
[2:44:24] truth she has high whereas I sell for
[2:44:26] the signs of debt she is powerful many
[2:44:29] members she's favor of the world the
[2:44:31] others a little persecuted group that
[2:44:33] falls the word we see the churn of the
[2:44:35] flesh persecute and destroy the chair of
[2:44:37] the spirit the Butley one father even as
[2:44:39] was the case of Isaac and Ishmael
[2:44:41] Revolution horse finish won't take me
[2:44:44] too long we run to $15 them that hold
[2:44:47] the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which
[2:44:49] things I heat didn't want to get on to
[2:44:52] you recall that Nikola 10 comes from two
[2:44:55] Greek works nikkyo to conquer Leo which
[2:44:57] means laity Nicoletta means to conquer
[2:45:00] the laity
[2:45:00] now why is this such a terrible thing it
[2:45:02] is terrible because God has never placed
[2:45:06] his church in the hands of an elected
[2:45:09] leadership with moves with political
[2:45:11] maintenance he has placed his church in
[2:45:15] the care of God inane spirit filled
[2:45:17] world living men who lead the people to
[2:45:20] feeding them the Word of God he has not
[2:45:23] separated the people in the classes so
[2:45:25] that the masses are led by a holy
[2:45:27] priesthood or holy fifl it is true that
[2:45:31] the leadership must be holy but so must
[2:45:33] the whole congregation further there is
[2:45:36] no place in the world where a priest or
[2:45:39] minister mediate between God and the
[2:45:42] people but we give the Lord a shout
[2:45:45] there is no place
[2:45:47] where the five hole or the minister
[2:45:50] mediate between the people and God Oh
[2:45:53] glory to God the men behind the pulpit
[2:45:56] supposed to be pipes when God opened
[2:45:58] that pipe the Spirit of God just have to
[2:46:01] flow through to you or get the Lord of
[2:46:05] screen give the Lord a show I am NOT
[2:46:09] here for me I am supposed to be here for
[2:46:12] you bringing love letters from your
[2:46:14] lover love letters from Jesus or give
[2:46:19] the Lord some praise these people so
[2:46:21] when you're coming to the fore to
[2:46:22] rejoice they can afford a shout because
[2:46:25] you're hearing from your Lord
[2:46:29] then the ministers become deadly like a
[2:46:32] dead pipe like a trumpet and I just had
[2:46:35] a blood true
[2:46:36] oh my further there is no place in the
[2:46:43] world where priests or minister or such
[2:46:46] as mediate between corner people nor is
[2:46:49] a place where they are separated in a
[2:46:50] wish of the Lord God wants all to love
[2:46:53] and serve Him together Nicole it isn't
[2:46:55] destroyed those precepts and instead
[2:46:59] separates the ministers on the people I
[2:47:01] make the leaders overlords instead of
[2:47:04] servants overlords instead of servants
[2:47:08] so what am i doing interfere with
[2:47:11] another church and saying who supposed
[2:47:13] to be pasta underfoot all the pasta and
[2:47:16] the ship of a right of photo mode
[2:47:18] because the ship supposed to want to
[2:47:20] connect to the angel which one angel II
[2:47:24] or angel be because right here I pull
[2:47:31] the plug an angel be and I have to make
[2:47:37] sure in the beat don't return
[2:47:40] [Applause]
[2:47:45] the keep in shall be out angel it is
[2:47:49] welcome in the ether walking and sang he
[2:47:54] said there'll be a church with in jelly
[2:47:56] in it
[2:47:56] the shout of the King will be in the
[2:47:59] camp she's just going to be walking in
[2:48:03] it Oh glory to God let's continue so now
[2:48:06] this doctrine started as a deed in the
[2:48:09] first age it appears that the problem
[2:48:10] leaning towards elder precipitous and
[2:48:13] overseer bishops both scripted shows
[2:48:16] that they are several elders in each
[2:48:17] church to teach that the idea of a
[2:48:20] bishop was one of preeminence or
[2:48:22] authority and control over elders so
[2:48:26] that Fripp now is a disciple of power
[2:48:28] and control over the elders and is a
[2:48:30] difference no lot difference talking
[2:48:34] French now between the faithful ministry
[2:48:38] and the elders and you have to explain
[2:48:41] will be faithful and the brother
[2:48:43] I see talking with two sides of his mode
[2:48:44] one side in Mount he's in his local
[2:48:46] elder next site trying to say he is five
[2:48:48] or so he said imagine a local elder a
[2:48:51] fallen angel spirit coming local error
[2:48:53] to make him think he's a faithful befall
[2:48:58] already chosen really faithful that's
[2:49:02] five fools means five men think about it
[2:49:04] they called another Englishman got to
[2:49:07] talk Spanish French German think about
[2:49:09] it once the Englishman at the only
[2:49:11] language Jesus spoke in English just
[2:49:13] wasn't over English he's talking Hebrew
[2:49:16] or whatever he was talking then you know
[2:49:17] so I can limit God to English only
[2:49:21] Faisal you mean any houla South America
[2:49:25] it will have one minister on the planet
[2:49:28] and South America that God could take
[2:49:29] fill anoint and bless and use and give
[2:49:32] the finest touches to the bride because
[2:49:35] men are perfect any bride you know the
[2:49:36] wood is doing that b54 is the duty
[2:49:39] finishing touches like the hem of your
[2:49:42] dress like you typically toward his
[2:49:44] shoes are wearing for the wedding
[2:49:46] finish the bouquet of flowers the
[2:49:48] finishing the fight formation of the
[2:49:50] party virgins of the people and the car
[2:49:52] to drive back miss reason
[2:49:53] the man has to have the virtues for it
[2:49:57] to flow and pour for 50 years we have
[2:50:04] mysteries and revelation and wood and
[2:50:05] teaching and script a-courtin and so on
[2:50:07] the secret is the wood in the bribe but
[2:50:09] the spirit has to be released to
[2:50:11] activate that Buddhist in you to make
[2:50:14] you an empowered Sun or glory to God
[2:50:17] don't let the devil think you are
[2:50:18] finished you are not finished yet you
[2:50:20] have to come into a manifestation
[2:50:22] because a word is a tort Express but the
[2:50:25] word itself must be borne into
[2:50:26] manifestation
[2:50:27] so go ahead bring thought bring you to
[2:50:29] the word know the word in you have to
[2:50:31] come into a manifestation you catch us
[2:50:33] you mean as a word you have to come into
[2:50:36] an expression the Bible said the word
[2:50:38] was made flesh that is when the
[2:50:41] invisible would become visible when the
[2:50:44] world come into your flesh then the
[2:50:46] invisible becomes visible all glory to
[2:50:51] God so the Prophet said know the truth
[2:50:54] of the matters it would L signifies who
[2:50:56] the person is why the word bishop
[2:50:58] signifies the office of the same man the
[2:51:01] elder is the man the bishop is the
[2:51:03] office of the man the elder always has
[2:51:05] and always will refer to a man's
[2:51:07] chronological age in the Lord he's an
[2:51:09] elder not because he's elected ordained
[2:51:11] but because he's older he's more
[2:51:13] seasoned trained not a novice reliable
[2:51:16] because of experience long standing
[2:51:17] proof of his Christian experience but no
[2:51:20] the bishops did not stick to the
[2:51:21] epistles of Paul but rather they went to
[2:51:23] Paul account of the time he called the
[2:51:25] ilysm ephesus and record states elders
[2:51:28] were called and in verse 48 he called
[2:51:30] him over stairs or bishops and these
[2:51:32] bishops no doubt here we go politically
[2:51:35] minded and unjust for power anxious for
[2:51:41] power insisted that Paul had given the
[2:51:44] meaning that overseers
[2:51:46] were more than the local elders with
[2:51:49] official capacity on his own to Overland
[2:51:51] Church to them a bishop was not one with
[2:51:54] extended authority over many local
[2:51:58] leaders such a concept was neither
[2:52:01] scripture nor historical yet even a man
[2:52:04] of the statue of Polycarp
[2:52:06] into what such organization thus what
[2:52:09] status that did in the first age was
[2:52:12] made a literal doctrine so it is today I
[2:52:15] call it five for bishops still claim
[2:52:17] power to control men and deal with them
[2:52:20] as the desire placing them where they
[2:52:22] were so will in the ministry this denies
[2:52:25] the leadership of the holy ghost who
[2:52:29] said separately Paul and Barnabas for
[2:52:32] the world parent to I have called them
[2:52:34] this is an T word and Antichrist or
[2:52:38] Cobra say Amen okay I'm gonna do in
[2:52:41] Chechnya now Matthew 20:25 28 Jesus
[2:52:44] callin to them and said you know the
[2:52:46] princes of the Gentiles exercise
[2:52:48] dominion over them and they have great
[2:52:52] exercise authority upon them it shall
[2:52:54] not be so among you but whosoever will
[2:52:58] be great among you let him be your
[2:53:00] Minister and whosoever be chief among
[2:53:02] you let him be your servant and as the
[2:53:05] son of man came not to be ministered
[2:53:07] unto but to minister and to give his
[2:53:09] life a ransom for many
[2:53:10] oh praise the name of the Lord praise
[2:53:13] God and this Roman Catholic Empire now
[2:53:16] watch what the bigger room do on the
[2:53:18] basis of a success she divided on
[2:53:20] conquer that was the seat of room - did
[2:53:22] I divide and conquer human knowledge and
[2:53:26] power and programmed the kind of take
[2:53:27] over divine wisdom and place the Holy
[2:53:29] Spirit no longer in control this indeed
[2:53:32] was a tragic evil for the bishops begin
[2:53:34] to maintain here we go that is no longer
[2:53:36] required a transparent Christian life
[2:53:39] and character to minister either the
[2:53:41] word with this man-made doctrine of
[2:53:44] elevation of bishops to a place not
[2:53:46] according them in the scripture the next
[2:53:48] step was handled greater titles the
[2:53:50] development the religious hierarchy soon
[2:53:52] they were acts Bishop lo bishops
[2:53:53] Cardinals over as bishops and by
[2:53:55] Boniface deterred there was a pontiff
[2:53:57] overall pontiff anna nicola turn
[2:54:02] doctrine this rule i was established in
[2:54:04] the church did not hit it off too well
[2:54:06] with a lot of people for they were
[2:54:08] really all a pistol oy essay on the word
[2:54:10] written by some godly person what did I
[2:54:12] just do
[2:54:13] excommunicated the righteous teachers
[2:54:15] and burn the school's telling me not an
[2:54:18] inspiration
[2:54:19] the out it takes special education to
[2:54:24] read and understand the world after all
[2:54:26] these years
[2:54:27] come on it took five fall to bring what
[2:54:30] known seamless they better bring the
[2:54:32] life because the word here for all these
[2:54:34] years it's hardly ever think we do
[2:54:36] already nobody profits it we could find
[2:54:38] it it only computer it's only in it its
[2:54:41] internet and so on you can find this
[2:54:42] anywhere it need more than that right
[2:54:44] now it's really that light because it
[2:54:45] breaks come in room coming home so just
[2:54:48] coming judgment is coming and we have to
[2:54:51] have what it takes to deal with that we
[2:54:55] can't have we have a church it happen
[2:54:57] less touches Satan embodiment that he's
[2:54:59] still marching him but a wrong quality
[2:55:02] invasion of the USA he said the invasion
[2:55:05] of churches the invasions of home is
[2:55:07] Devil's loosed hell is not below he'll
[2:55:10] have come on the earth do you understand
[2:55:14] you in a real war he'll come from
[2:55:17] underneath and come on top so part of
[2:55:19] the cell heaven from dong he said heaven
[2:55:22] consists of the word so he sent seven
[2:55:24] years of bring down heaven with a
[2:55:26] message of the Holy Ghost to loosen go
[2:55:29] across the world and you in the land of
[2:55:32] mortality you are in between fight
[2:55:35] brother
[2:55:36] [Applause]
[2:55:40] maybe seated almost done and though we
[2:55:46] are angel from heaven preach any other
[2:55:48] gospel and which we are cursed we should
[2:55:51] let him be accursed
[2:55:51] it was the Apostles who brought your
[2:55:54] original word to the people the original
[2:55:56] word could not change
[2:55:58] not even my dot or - Paul knew it was
[2:56:01] God who had spoken to him so he said
[2:56:03] even if I come and try to bring a second
[2:56:08] revelation try to make one little change
[2:56:11] if I give originally left me be accurst
[2:56:15] do you see how powerful that is he had
[2:56:18] was to stay with your original
[2:56:19] revelation did he Paul knew that the
[2:56:24] first revelation was correct God can't
[2:56:26] give a first revelation than a second
[2:56:28] revision now listen this if something is
[2:56:31] not any Bible only a prophet could
[2:56:32] reveal it if a mystery is not inside
[2:56:35] only a prophet can reveal it
[2:56:37] nobody could claim but a man never
[2:56:39] revealed the mystery of pitch three or
[2:56:40] four and he revealed it no so that make
[2:56:44] him who what what a what a man is that
[2:56:48] right the Prophet is the only man call
[2:56:51] to review this book men come under that
[2:56:55] and see what that was said by revelation
[2:56:57] inspiration oh my are you with me no so
[2:57:01] Paul knew the first version was correct
[2:57:03] God can't give a first revelation then a
[2:57:05] second revelation if he did he would be
[2:57:07] changing his mind he can't give a
[2:57:09] revelation and an app to it like he
[2:57:12] didn't garner Eden he promised the sea
[2:57:14] to the woman and then later desert in
[2:57:15] the sea to come to Abraham and then
[2:57:17] later say they will come to the planning
[2:57:19] of David it was the same revelation it
[2:57:21] only gives the people more information
[2:57:23] to help them to receive and understand
[2:57:26] it he can actu'ly the revelation will
[2:57:28] catch injured god's word can change the
[2:57:31] seed came exactly as revealed and you
[2:57:33] see what those false apostles were doing
[2:57:36] they came here we go with their own
[2:57:38] would go wrap it up here those Ephesians
[2:57:45] knew what world Paul had taught it they
[2:57:50] were full of the Holy Ghost
[2:57:51] the lane of Paul's hands the look post
[2:57:54] false apostles in the eye and said you
[2:57:56] are not seeing what Paul said you are
[2:58:00] therefore false this is not laity or
[2:58:03] elder correct and fight for you know
[2:58:05] this was believers who no apology
[2:58:08] challenging them apostles chlorine
[2:58:11] Oh God
[2:58:11] a brother say explaining the difference
[2:58:14] in a local elder a fiber ministry
[2:58:15] because son lieutenant will not correct
[2:58:17] a general what that could work in the
[2:58:24] army but will come with that here this
[2:58:27] is Ephesians didn't on lieutenant
[2:58:30] correctly know L know fine fall this is
[2:58:33] a famine of the word dynamite or glory
[2:58:38] that God is no lieutenant correct in
[2:58:40] general it doesn't have that
[2:58:41] oh my hallelujah they look those
[2:58:45] apostles for in the eye and said you are
[2:58:47] not saying what Paul said you're
[2:58:49] therefore false that says my heart on
[2:58:51] fire get back to the word it is not you
[2:58:53] that really tried the Apostles on profit
[2:58:56] on teacher it is the word that tries
[2:58:58] them oh my one of these days there's
[2:59:02] going to be a profit to the loudest
[2:59:03] interchange you will know if he's a real
[2:59:06] one sent from God or not for he will be
[2:59:09] that in that word exactly as God give it
[2:59:11] to Paul music I'm a please he won't
[2:59:13] deviate from that word for one moment
[2:59:16] not by one iota and that's in this last
[2:59:19] age are you ready
[2:59:20] when there will be many false prophets
[2:59:23] apparent watch and see how they will
[2:59:26] keep telling you if you don't believe
[2:59:29] them and what they say you'll be lost
[2:59:34] but when that last day profit comes on
[2:59:37] the scene if he is truly the prophet
[2:59:39] he'll be crying out get back to the
[2:59:41] world or you are lost or glory to glory
[2:59:45] man praise God praise God praise God
[2:59:48] so once the clergy separate themselves
[2:59:51] and organize themselves they oppress the
[2:59:53] people by leading them into an abandoned
[2:59:56] organization this organization was based
[2:59:59] upon Crees and dogmas which they taught
[3:00:01] the people instead of the pure Word of
[3:00:04] God you act instead of the pure Word of
[3:00:08] God
[3:00:09] are you ready ritual and ceremony was
[3:00:12] given Christian partnership and soon the
[3:00:15] whole system was a militant and
[3:00:18] diabolical power that did its best to
[3:00:21] control all to persuasion or discourse
[3:00:24] or literal force oh my god this is too
[3:00:28] much this is too much this little ism
[3:00:30] his it came to be a militant this church
[3:00:34] she's only like if his militant
[3:00:38] diabolical power that did its best to
[3:00:41] control all true persuasion of discourse
[3:00:44] or literal force it receives his energy
[3:00:49] from its own false prophecies
[3:00:54] the false prophecies Israeli was getting
[3:00:57] energy from and not the Word of God it
[3:01:00] was no absolutely Antichrist though it
[3:01:03] came in Christ's name after what seemed
[3:01:06] interminable time where and truth must
[3:01:09] surely die men begin the protest of
[3:01:11] vileness of the Catholic Church because
[3:01:12] by no stretch of the imagination could
[3:01:14] God be in such teachings and such
[3:01:16] conduct and I swear Luther came in and
[3:01:19] start the Reformation oh my he said
[3:01:23] they're Antichrist spirit manifested in
[3:01:25] organization dimension on false talking
[3:01:26] to the ages and the poor little root and
[3:01:29] stock is going to be restored and so
[3:01:31] forth amen
[3:01:31] religious I'll skip that but Ram says I
[3:01:35] sincerely believe that the Spirit of God
[3:01:38] has been speaking to us not only
[3:01:41] teaching us the truths of the ages but
[3:01:44] he has been faithfully delivered our
[3:01:45] hearts that they may turn to Him that is
[3:01:48] the reason for all the preaching and
[3:01:49] teaching for it is the preaching
[3:01:50] intention of the word that the sheep
[3:01:52] hear the voice of God and follow him not
[3:01:54] for one moment do I bring a message of
[3:01:56] the people that they may follow me
[3:01:58] listen Brown or join my church or start
[3:02:01] some fellowship organization I have
[3:02:03] never done that and will not do that no
[3:02:06] I have no interest in those things but I
[3:02:08] do have an interest in the things of God
[3:02:09] and people and if I cannot come to just
[3:02:12] one thing I'll be satisfied that one
[3:02:14] thing is the see establish a true
[3:02:17] spiritual relationship between God and
[3:02:19] men wherein men become new creatures in
[3:02:22] Christ filled with the spirit and live
[3:02:25] according to the Word of God praise God
[3:02:28] so this false prophet praise God later
[3:02:31] he become the devil incarnate so the
[3:02:33] devil begin with the spirit of the devil
[3:02:35] he become a false prophet a teacher of
[3:02:38] false doctrine so the teaching of the
[3:02:40] false doctrine is the first move of
[3:02:42] Lucifer on the move he didn't have a
[3:02:45] classical power yet but he started in
[3:02:48] with a demon of false teaching and that
[3:02:51] teaching became a doctrine and the
[3:02:53] doctrine become incarnate and a false
[3:02:55] prophet that went and not known the room
[3:02:57] Nicaea room god only knows how many he
[3:03:01] calls to spiritually die by his anti
[3:03:03] Bible were teaching this
[3:03:05] he put 68 million into the sword and
[3:03:08] kill and billions died spiritually on
[3:03:10] false teaching false teaching
[3:03:14] notice he give us space to repent but he
[3:03:17] didn't do it he's done it again she
[3:03:19] won't do it
[3:03:20] reject it oh my so what I will do her
[3:03:24] okay almost so then this force teaching
[3:03:28] the Antichrist first road in a teaching
[3:03:30] ministry what did God do to combat that
[3:03:33] Antichrist spirit
[3:03:34] listen know what he did and one window
[3:03:36] to meet him the lion the lion of the
[3:03:41] tribe of Judah which is the word when
[3:03:44] this false teaching went out the
[3:03:46] anointing of the lion has to come to
[3:03:49] combat false teaching that anointing is
[3:03:52] a pole anointing fearless anointing
[3:03:56] Judah to come back what false teacher oh
[3:03:58] praise the name of the Lord do you
[3:04:00] believe that she anointed one what I'm
[3:04:03] saying is not designed on one design or
[3:04:04] is it teaching different village to
[3:04:07] anointed only for some limited question
[3:04:09] an answer Matthew 24:24
[3:04:12] and there shall arise false prophets and
[3:04:14] false Christ's and false prophets show
[3:04:16] us and the one is how shall we recognize
[3:04:18] them whatever him say a false Christ is
[3:04:20] false anointed because Christ is
[3:04:22] anointed how many knows that the Christ
[3:04:24] been anointed there will be four so
[3:04:25] noted ones they call themselves prophets
[3:04:27] but how will you recognize them by the
[3:04:29] word that's how you will know it by the
[3:04:31] word whether they're right
[3:04:32] how will you recognize them will be by
[3:04:34] the word if they say that they have the
[3:04:37] word and then deny the word
[3:04:38] there's nothing to it they might heal
[3:04:40] the sick they might open the blind eyes
[3:04:42] and deny the word stay away from it
[3:04:44] don't care what it is
[3:04:45] stay away once it's not the word Oh
[3:04:47] glory to God when a man turns on the
[3:04:50] world and joined the church instead of
[3:04:52] receiving the Holy Ghost that man dies
[3:04:53] Oh glory to God amen oh praise God
[3:04:58] hallelujah
[3:05:00] what's next I'm frozen and this is from
[3:05:07] Isaiah 28 this is what coming next
[3:05:15] Wow
[3:05:18] praising of the Lord wherefore yeah the
[3:05:24] word of the Lord is confirming that rule
[3:05:27] these people which is in Jerusalem
[3:05:29] because you have said we are made a
[3:05:32] covenant with that I would hell are we
[3:05:34] at agreement when the overflowing
[3:05:37] scourge shall pass through it shall not
[3:05:40] come unto us for we are made lies or a
[3:05:43] refuge an under false enough we hid
[3:05:46] ourselves therefore does see the Lord
[3:05:49] God behold I lay in Zion a foundation of
[3:05:51] stone a tried stone a precious
[3:05:54] cornerstone a sure foundation he that
[3:05:57] believeth shall not make his judgment
[3:06:00] will I lead to the lane and
[3:06:01] righteousness to the plummet and the
[3:06:04] heel shall sweep away the refuge of lies
[3:06:07] and the water shall overflow the hiding
[3:06:10] place and your covenant will death shall
[3:06:13] be dishonored your agreement with hell
[3:06:15] shall not stand when the overflowing
[3:06:18] score shall pass through then you shall
[3:06:20] be trodden down by it and from that time
[3:06:22] that did code for each I'll take you
[3:06:26] morning by morning shall is Passover by
[3:06:29] day and by night it shall be a vexation

[3:06:35] himself on it and the covering narrower
