[27:51] scriptures tonight First Corinthians 6
[27:54] reading Verse 18 to 20. Zechariah
[27:58] Chapter 4.
[27:59] I want to read verse 1 to 10.
[28:01] and had I won
[28:04] we want to
[28:06] reading one to five
[28:09] reading from
[28:10] First Corinthians 6 18. free fornication
[28:15] every sin that a man do it is without
[28:17] the body
[28:18] but he had commit fornication sinned
[28:21] against his own body
[28:22] what know ye not that your body is a
[28:25] temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[28:28] which he have of God and you are not of
[28:31] your own
[28:32] for you are bought with a price
[28:34] therefore glorify God in your body
[28:38] and in your spirit which are gods
[28:41] and our next scripture from Zechariah
[28:44] Chapter 4 reading verse 1 and the angel
[28:46] that talked with me came again and with
[28:48] me as a man that has written out of his
[28:50] sleep said unto me what says Thou I said
[28:53] I have looked and we hold a Candlestick
[28:55] all of gold with a bowl up on top of it
[28:58] and his seven lamps thereon and seven
[29:00] pipes to the seven Lambs which are upon
[29:02] the top thereof to all of three by one

[29:12] Lord then the angel talk with me and
[29:15] said and said unto me no it's no not
[29:17] what these be I said no my Lord then he
[29:20] answered and speak unto me singing This
[29:22] is the word of the Lord unto the rubber
[29:24] Bill saying not by might not by power
[29:27] but by my spirit seeth the Lord of hosts
[29:30] who are thou great Mountain because the
[29:32] room well though shall become a plane
[29:34] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[29:36] thereof with shouting scrying Greece
[29:39] grease unto it moreover the word of Lord
[29:41] came to be saying the hands of Jehovah
[29:43] Bell have laid the foundation of this
[29:45] house his hands shall also finish it and
[29:48] thou shall know that the Lord of whose
[29:51] had sent me unto you for who had
[29:55] despised the day of small things and for
[29:57] they shall rejoice and shall see the
[30:00] plummet in the hand of the river Bell
[30:01] with those seven they're the eyes of the
[30:04] Lord which run to and fro to the whole
[30:06] earth or last of the reason is
[30:10] chapter 1
[30:12] you want to read
[30:14] in the second year of diary as the king
[30:16] the sixth month and the first day of the
[30:19] month came the word of the Lord by had I
[30:22] the prophet unto zero Bell the South
[30:25] Shield governor of Judah and to Joshua
[30:28] the son of Jose Tech the high priest
[30:31] saying thus speak at the Lord of who
[30:34] saying
[30:35] this people say
[30:38] the time is not come
[30:41] the time that the Lord's hope should be
[30:44] built
[30:45] then came the word of the Lord by hadai
[30:48] the prophets in
[30:50] is it time for you
[30:52] or ye to dwell in your sealed hoses and
[30:56] that word in the Empire is panel houses
[30:58] and this house liewis
[31:01] therefore now therefore thus said the
[31:05] Lord of hosts consider your ways let's
[31:08] ball heads Heavenly Father we thank you
[31:10] for your word tonight may you come and
[31:11] interpret it to our hearts in Jesus name
[31:13] I ask it amen any man you may be seated
[31:15] praise God
[31:17] uh if you want to keep a marker in that
[31:20] scripture there we go back to it he got
[31:22] chapter one we want to just get
[31:24] something something Saturday tonight but
[31:26] have a title of the night
[31:29] thus said the Lord of hosts
[31:31] consider your ways
[31:34] that's the title of tonight
[31:36] amen thus say at the Lord of whose
[31:37] consider your ways of an inspiration
[31:41] rebuilding the last day bright Church
[31:44] under the power of the spirit
[31:46] oh I appreciate the services Sunday
[31:51] when God stirs and I believe it was a
[31:54] message direct from the Lord when God
[31:57] stirs and it got to do that
[32:01] and Trooper Anthony he identified how
[32:04] Cyrus was stood this King by God himself
[32:07] to put a burden to release the people to
[32:10] go and rebuild this Temple so I want to
[32:13] hook into that I got this uh through
[32:15] that has come to me to go into this so
[32:18] I'm going to share this with you tonight
[32:19] and this is from the book of I
[32:24] no
[32:25] just look a little background a little
[32:27] bit
[32:28] you know go out something with Kings and
[32:31] Priests and Prophets
[32:32] in the Bible right and that's the story
[32:34] of the Old Testament Kings priests
[32:37] prophets and most time the king of Ki
[32:41] sometimes the priests go all free coffee
[32:43] but not the prophets
[32:45] the prophet sent by God the street and
[32:47] Kings and Priests straighten the whole
[32:49] system so that's why God have to send
[32:52] Prophets
[32:53] no
[32:56] hagai was considered a minor prophet
[32:59] and his prophecy I believe was within
[33:02] the same year about four months it
[33:04] wasn't a long period of time that he had
[33:07] to see what God put upon him to see now
[33:10] the wickedness of Israel brought
[33:12] destruction
[33:13] it brought the desolation of the temple
[33:15] it was all in Ruins amen
[33:19] and this was some second Kings chapter
[33:21] 25 I'm going to read part of it one and
[33:25] it came to pass in a 90 of his Reigns
[33:27] other Bible teaching but we're going to
[33:28] get we're gonna get to where we're going
[33:29] to get tonight
[33:30] in the 10th month in the tenth day of
[33:32] the month that Nebuchadnezzar King of
[33:34] Babylon came he and all his hosts
[33:36] against Jerusalem
[33:38] and pitched against it they built fought
[33:41] against roundabout and the city was
[33:43] besieged on the 11th year of King
[33:46] zedekiah and on the ninth day of the
[33:49] fourth month the famine prevailed in the
[33:51] city and there was no bread for the
[33:53] people of the land now this is Judgment
[33:55] for sin and wickedness coming to God's
[33:59] people
[34:00] in Jerusalem okay and the city was
[34:03] broken up and all the men of all fled By
[34:05] Night by the way of the gate between two
[34:07] walls which is by the King's Garden now
[34:10] the Italians were against the city
[34:11] wronged about and the King went towards
[34:13] the there was the plane and the army of
[34:15] the child is pursued after the king and
[34:17] overtook him in the plains of Jericho
[34:19] and all his army was scattered from him
[34:21] so they took the king brought him up to
[34:23] the king of Babylon to rebab and they
[34:25] give judgment upon him they stood the
[34:28] sons of zedekiah before his eyes put all
[34:30] the eyes of zedika and Bong him with
[34:32] Setters of brass and carried into
[34:34] Babylon in the fifth month of the
[34:37] seventh day of the month which is the
[34:38] 19th year of King Nebuchadnezzar King of
[34:40] Babylon came nebuch uh nebul zaran
[34:43] captain of the Goddess servant of the
[34:45] king of Babylon unto Jerusalem and he
[34:48] burnt the house of the Lord and the
[34:50] King's house all the houses of Jerusalem
[34:53] and every great man's house burned he
[34:55] would fire and all the armies of the
[34:57] Charlies that were with captains of the
[35:00] god break down the wall
[35:03] House of God broken King's Palace broken
[35:07] burnt with fire judgment but the captain
[35:11] of the god left the poor of the land the
[35:13] Divine dresses and husband men and the
[35:15] pillars of brass that were in the house
[35:16] of the Lord and the bases and the prison
[35:18] sea was in the house of the Lord the
[35:21] Italians break in pieces and carry the
[35:23] brass of them into Babylon pots the
[35:26] shovels the Snuffles and so on they took
[35:28] away
[35:28] so Israel spent 70 years in Babylon
[35:32] as prophesied by Jeremiah we're talking
[35:35] about prophecy fulfillment of Prophecy
[35:37] and God can't change his mind about what
[35:39] he's in his body
[35:41] now Jeremiah 25
[35:43] verse 8 says therefore thus saith the
[35:48] Lord of hosts
[35:49] because you have not heard my words
[35:52] Behold I will sin and take all the
[35:57] families of the north saith the Lord
[36:00] the king of Babylon my servant
[36:04] I saw God identifying Nebuchadnezzar a
[36:07] man that will do what God ordained
[36:10] because of the behavior of his people
[36:13] Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my
[36:15] servant and will bring them against this
[36:17] land and against the inhabitants thereof
[36:20] against all these nations wronged about
[36:22] and will utterly destroy them and make
[36:25] them an astonishment his sin and a
[36:28] Perpetual desolation
[36:30] moreover I will take from them the voice
[36:32] of myth the voice of gladness the voice
[36:35] of the bridegroom the voice of the Bride
[36:37] the song of the millstone and the light
[36:39] of the candle and the whole land shall
[36:43] be a desolation and an astonishment and
[36:46] these nations Shall Serve the king of
[36:49] Babylon 70 years
[36:51] God can change that
[36:53] God cannot reverse that the ball from
[36:56] his Arrow has been shut his Arrow from
[36:58] his bow has been shut and that's it
[37:01] and I shall come to pass
[37:03] prophecy continues
[37:05] when 70 years are accomplished so what
[37:09] have his time you know we may feel it's
[37:11] supposed to be so it's supposed to be so
[37:13] but God have his timing
[37:15] so nothing is by chance this lingering
[37:18] time is not by chance Oh Glory to God
[37:21] hallelujah praise God and it shall come
[37:24] to pass when 70 years are accomplished
[37:27] that I will punish the king of Babylon
[37:29] and that Nation said the Lord for their
[37:31] iniquity and the land of the challenge
[37:33] and will make it a Perpetual desolation
[37:36] and I will bring upon that land all my
[37:39] words which I have pronounced against it
[37:41] even all that is written in this book
[37:43] which Jeremiah had prophesied against
[37:46] all the nations so he recognize now God
[37:48] has back up His prophets go to have his
[37:51] prophecy in one thing and he's saying
[37:52] something else because he is who gives
[37:54] the prophets his words we're not talking
[37:56] about false prophecy we're talking about
[37:57] true prophets genuine prophets like what
[38:00] goes in our Prophet this last day
[38:01] Malachi foreign
[38:03] genuine Prophet true Prophet give him

[40:33] believe in um
[40:35] the same scripture in desperation you

[40:40] years they accomplished we read this in
[40:41] prayer meeting for another thoughts I

[41:06] will bring you again unto the place
[41:07] which I cause you to be carried away
[41:10] captive
[41:11] Pentecost
[41:13] now what he said here I put that in
[41:16] myself it doesn't say that that's what I
[41:19] was meaning to the church Luke 17 the
[41:22] law and the prophets were until John
[41:24] since that time the kingdom of God is
[41:26] preached and every man pressed into it
[41:28] every man presented not just simply
[41:31] walks into it easily he's got to be
[41:35] pressed into you when you seek me with
[41:38] all your heart I'll be found
[41:39] so you put the key right there people
[41:42] join the message they come into the
[41:43] message they believe the message they're
[41:44] pressing nothing
[41:45] but the kingdom of God had to be
[41:47] preached and every man had to press
[41:49] their way into it so this message this
[41:51] morning tonight is an exaltation and
[41:54] it's something to encourage you
[41:56] to get your apathy get out your laziness
[41:59] your your your deadness your your
[42:01] formality your your formal thing of
[42:04] going to church and just going back home
[42:06] and recognize there somebody's a person
[42:08] too isn't there something there
[42:11] so the king of Babylon took the children
[42:13] of Israel into captivity
[42:15] 70 years but then Cyrus
[42:18] the position King
[42:20] captured Babylon
[42:23] and he was stayed by God as we heard
[42:26] Sunday
[42:27] that God had decreed to go back to the
[42:29] Homeland and build the temple of God
[42:32] it's not something yet he even get them
[42:34] funds money afterwards about two steps
[42:38] down Darius coming to see and cut it off
[42:41] affecting the work of the building her
[42:44] battles because once ever you stood up
[42:46] to do something for God what the battles
[42:48] come what's the fights come watch the
[42:51] opposition come watch the enemy come
[42:53] once your spirit is still Watch What
[42:55] Happens
[42:59] now watch
[43:00] so Cyrus gave the decree okay they stood
[43:04] up to go back and build this Temple this
[43:07] house of God right and watch just a
[43:10] Remnant went back
[43:12] the rest who were born in captivity they
[43:15] remained there
[43:16] and by that time I've guessed they're in
[43:18] business they're doing good they are the
[43:20] hoses they're the homes you know the
[43:22] prospering yeah I know burden you know
[43:25] only the remnant who have a spiritual
[43:28] antenna
[43:30] that we have to be going out to visit us
[43:32] only that Remnant decide to go back I
[43:35] just surrendered
[43:36] it's not something there
[43:38] and this Remnant was led by two people
[43:41] two persons two persons let this small
[43:44] Remnant was the rule belt a prince a
[43:46] governor and he was along the Royal line
[43:48] of David
[43:49] and Joshua a priest
[43:52] is that right
[43:53] no doubt they left family
[43:56] friends in order to go back to
[44:00] desolation
[44:01] and hardship
[44:02] to a land that wasn't till or wasn't
[44:06] brought into subjection for 70 years
[44:08] they're going back to abandonment with a
[44:11] spirit upon them to restore and to
[44:14] rebuild to get it back in order
[44:17] Hallelujah glory to God
[44:20] it wasn't about Comfort or money that
[44:23] caused them to make this journey if they
[44:25] wanted comfort and money they got to
[44:26] stay in Babylon they can stay with their
[44:28] business they could stay where they
[44:30] Prosperity Prosperity but something was
[44:32] burden in them
[44:35] where they were taken from
[44:38] as he was born in Babylon but he wasn't
[44:40] staying in Babylon there was a call
[44:42] inside of him to get back to Jerusalem
[44:44] Oh Glory look they get back to the land
[44:47] what calls inside you tonight you have
[44:50] to have a call in you you know not
[44:51] everybody have that call you know it's
[44:53] just a bunch of Remnant Oh Glory the god
[44:56] set that call to go back
[44:59] not the prosperity and comfort and Easy
[45:01] Living you know go back to Desolation
[45:03] but this is God's lamb go back to
[45:05] Desolation but of course I'm going to
[45:07] restore Hallelujah go back to the ruins
[45:10] Oh Glory the God is not something there
[45:14] it was something spiritual for them
[45:16] a destiny to bring honor and glory to
[45:20] God
[45:21] it was challenging
[45:23] it was no easy part by Clans it was
[45:25] challenging Hallelujah
[45:28] praise God and from Ezra chapter 3
[45:32] there's three verses there and when the
[45:34] settlement must come the children of
[45:36] Israel were in the cities the people
[45:39] gathered themselves together as one man
[45:41] to Jerusalem then stood up jeshua
[45:44] or so when they're traveling to the land
[45:46] you know the first thing to do
[45:49] the first thing they did was what Villa
[45:51] altar
[45:54] a place that they could talk to God
[45:57] least that he could offer sacrifice
[45:59] so when you're on the path of
[46:01] restoration you have to get connection
[46:04] first thing they build backer altar to
[46:08] restore back a connection to Jehovah
[46:11] watch and when the seven month was come
[46:13] to me Israel was the cities the people
[46:15] Ghana together themselves together as
[46:17] one man to Jerusalem then stood up
[46:19] Joshua the son of Joseph
[46:21] his bridge in the priests the Ruleville
[46:24] the son of Shield his Brethren and
[46:27] builded the altar of God of Israel
[46:30] to offer burned offerings thereon as it
[46:33] is written in the law of Moses the man
[46:35] of God and they set the alt upon his
[46:38] bases for fear was upon them because of
[46:42] the people of those countries and they
[46:45] offered burnt offerings therefore unto
[46:47] the Lord even burnt offerings morning
[46:49] and evening
[46:51] so they're coming back into our Zone
[46:53] let's say for instance the rubabell he
[46:57] Clueless
[46:57] he had born there you grew up there this
[47:00] is new land
[47:01] and they have countries all around
[47:04] it have enemies all around they are
[47:06] small bunch
[47:08] but they have a mission
[47:09] they are small Bunch but they stood up
[47:11] they are small Bunch but they have a
[47:14] calling upon them and they know that
[47:16] they have enemies out there so they are
[47:19] playing with this altar they're calling
[47:21] upon God they're frightened but they
[47:23] praying they're shaking but they pray
[47:25] isn't that familiar when he was in the
[47:27] upper room they were fighting but it was
[47:29] their present and blessing God
[47:30] continually Oh Glory to God it was the
[47:32] upper room for fear of the Jews Oh Glory
[47:35] to God's favorite frightened pray
[47:37] if you're scared pray if you're worried
[47:40] pray oh glory the lord is not things not
[47:42] working as they wanted pray
[47:44] ER
[47:46] Hallelujah
[47:49] now this time that these guys going in
[47:52] this maybe I think it's about 20 years
[47:54] since Cyrus gives the decree to build
[47:56] the temple
[47:57] stood up by God to do that
[48:00] and you know what
[48:02] they were working
[48:04] they actually work on the temple for two
[48:07] years
[48:08] and then stopped
[48:10] so that fire
[48:12] that stirring
[48:15] that anointing lasted for two years
[48:18] and didn't step this Prophet call
[48:21] haggai
[48:25] that is where he came in
[48:27] because he had that burden
[48:29] to get them back on track
[48:32] Hallelujah and this is the question that
[48:36] God presented to them
[48:40] and this is where we read
[48:43] a guy come up speaking thus said the
[48:46] Lord of hosts sin
[48:49] this people say
[48:52] no we're not talking about those in
[48:53] Babylon
[48:55] we're talking about the cold loved ones
[48:57] we're talking about the remnant no we're
[49:00] talking about people in the land because
[49:02] what happened they started work at the
[49:03] temple Foundation late you're gonna get
[49:05] it
[49:07] and afterwards things stop
[49:10] and I think it's 14 years past not a
[49:13] stone nothing moving
[49:16] foreign taking a coffee break
[49:19] relaxing time
[49:21] in the message
[49:23] here come had I
[49:26] hear what God is saying this people say
[49:30] the time is not come
[49:33] the time that the Lord's hope should be
[49:35] built
[49:38] they can't question going back
[49:41] that is folly they know they have to go
[49:43] back
[49:44] but a query come up now you know I mean
[49:47] I do think there's the time you know
[49:52] you know what continue
[49:55] then the word of the Lord by higai the
[49:59] prophet saying is it time for you
[50:03] or ye to dwell in your sealed hoses
[50:08] and this hosts like ways
[50:11] now therefore
[50:12] the Lord of hosts not that simple
[50:18] consider
[50:20] your whis
[50:22] this small group
[50:27] low resources
[50:30] choose to build a smaller Temple than
[50:32] Solomon home
[50:35] but they were working on their own home
[50:38] they were working on their own stuff
[50:41] and not the purpose that God raised them
[50:44] up for
[50:45] what are you working on
[50:48] what is your project
[50:50] the priorities got skewed
[50:52] they was focusing on the wrong thing
[50:55] oh praise the name of the Lord
[50:57] Hallelujah they stopped building after
[51:00] two years and of 14 years nothing was
[51:02] done on the house of God

[51:53] hallelujah glory to God
[51:56] glory to God a conflict of returning to
[52:01] the land if it was right or wrong no it
[52:03] was right but like our timing is wrong
[52:06] it was a terrible condition
[52:08] God raised up the prophet
[52:11] to speak to his children and all this
[52:14] isn't just about the four months
[52:17] the purpose that God raised up that
[52:20] Prophet was to motivate
[52:23] and Inspire the people to work on the
[52:26] temple of God
[52:27] when the foundation was laid and that
[52:29] Foundation was laid identified in Ezra 3
[52:32] 8 to 11 he said no the second year of
[52:36] their coming into the house of God at
[52:37] Jerusalem in the second month began the
[52:40] rule about the same Shield Joshua the
[52:43] son of Jose and the remnant of the
[52:45] bridge when the priest and the Levites
[52:46] all that they will come out of the
[52:48] Captivity unto Jerusalem they appointed
[52:50] Levites from 20 years old upward to set
[52:53] forth the work of the house of the Lord
[52:55] then stood Joshua with his sons and his
[52:58] Brethren Camille and his sons and the
[53:01] sons of Judah together they set forward
[53:02] a Workman in the house of God the sons
[53:05] of hinenaad with his sons on the
[53:06] abrasion of the Levites and when the
[53:08] builders laid the foundation of the
[53:10] Temple of the Lord they set the priests
[53:13] in their apparel with trumpets and the
[53:15] Levi is the son of Assaf with symbols to
[53:18] praise the Lord after the ordinance of
[53:21] David king of Israel and they sang
[53:23] together by course and praising and
[53:25] giving thanks unto the Lord because he
[53:28] is good his Mercy endured forever
[53:30] towards Israel and all the people
[53:32] shouted with a great shout when they
[53:35] praised the Lord because the foundation
[53:36] of the house of the Lord was laid Oh

[54:36] people say
[54:37] the people talking
[54:39] the time has not come
[54:41] the time that the Lord's House should be
[54:43] built
[54:44] the mid
[54:46] an excuse
[54:48] that song spiritual
[54:51] not that it won't be built you know but
[54:52] but you know I mean I believe my house I
[54:55] I had it all night doing this I doing
[54:57] that I fixing me
[54:59] and God said consider your ways
[55:05] think to consider is to think carefully
[55:08] about something
[55:10] come from a Latin word to examine
[55:13] to pause a moment
[55:15] to consider to reflect
[55:19] because what happened after a while
[55:21] this lack of Interest
[55:24] lack of enthusiasm lack of concern apacy
[55:28] take them
[55:35] make a Revival
[55:37] they stirred up does he say what you see
[55:40] should make a church that will make a
[55:42] Revival that we will find them
[55:43] everywhere I said there's seven Thunders
[55:45] that are rip this there's been mean man

[55:51] produce that
[55:52] manifest that bring that into a reality
[55:55] there'll be a church where the shout of
[55:58] the king will be in the camp
[56:05] Glory
[56:07] opposite of apathy is enthusiasm

[56:13] he said no this is your own life this is
[56:15] my life if this isn't the truth what I'm
[56:18] fixing to see I'm one of the most
[56:19] foolish people in the world I've given
[56:21] my life for something there's nothing to
[56:23] and so have you but if it is the truth
[56:26] then I owe everything that I am I owe
[56:30] everything that I could be to the cause
[56:32] of which we are standing for I think
[56:35] that we must lose our enthusiasm

[57:42] a lot
[57:43] they'll be so disappointed
[57:45] that's been hurt you know when you feel
[57:47] entitled to something yeah Jesus gave an
[57:49] example he said when somebody invite you
[57:51] take the lower seat
[57:54] you figure you belong to some higher
[57:56] seat and new places over there and
[57:58] somebody more worthy come than you
[58:00] and that is actually excuse me your
[58:02] Shadow coming moving from there then
[58:03] your vexing everything else because
[58:07] Jesus said what to do
[58:09] take the Lewis seat
[58:11] when you take this you don't feel you're
[58:13] entitled when you take a seat that you
[58:16] feel you're entitled to and have to
[58:17] remove from that there's a problem
[58:20] that is what is happening now
[58:22] people feel the entitled because a long
[58:24] time in the message they're entitled
[58:25] because this they're entitled cut it out
[58:28] you entitled to fight
[58:30] you're entitled to press
[58:31] you're entitled to back back to your way
[58:34] you're entitlement of every place you
[58:36] put your foot is yours that is what
[58:38] you're entitled to
[58:46] examine yourself
[58:48] to see what it is
[58:50] improving
[58:53] everybody say a nice you're good you're
[58:55] fine with that channel that what them
[58:57] say what did God say and what do you
[58:59] know
[59:00] reputation is what other people talk
[59:02] about you characters who you are
[59:04] Hallelujah when you're by yourself
[59:06] that's character
[59:08] Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[59:11] praise God coming personally aware and
[59:14] coming uncomfortable that's the problem
[59:16] no some people are not accomplishable to
[59:18] nobody so they do whatever they want
[59:21] like if we're in the days of Judges
[59:22] everybody do what's
[59:24] in the heart
[59:26] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[59:30] God ask a question
[59:33] is it time for you you say it's not time
[59:36] to build the house of God
[59:37] but is it time for you to dwell in your
[59:40] panel houses
[59:41] and this whole line wheeze
[59:44] parties were off
[59:47] not having the right priority
[59:50] making
[59:52] and this is where we have to come to
[59:54] making the most important thing
[59:57] the most important thing
[1:00:03] let the main thing be the main thing
[1:00:05] everything else is inside you
[1:00:09] let me say it again let the main thing
[1:00:10] be the main thing only the most
[1:00:12] important thing be the most important
[1:00:13] thing
[1:00:14] Hallelujah
[1:00:17] getting a burden for the house of God to
[1:00:20] be rebuilt and to be in order your house
[1:00:23] in order but you're not burdened about a
[1:00:25] church being in order your house in
[1:00:27] order but you're not burden about
[1:00:28] anybody else getting an order and the
[1:00:30] fire of God in the church you're not
[1:00:32] burdened
[1:00:35] consider
[1:00:37] your ways
[1:00:39] a message to reorder priorities Matthew
[1:00:40] 6 33 and seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:00:44] God
[1:00:45] of his righteousness
[1:00:47] and all these things shall be added
[1:00:50] unto you
[1:00:51] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:00:54] praise the name of the Lord
[1:00:57] Hallelujah
[1:00:59] verse 5.
[1:01:01] now therefore thus say the Lord of hosts
[1:01:03] consider your ways
[1:01:05] and then go start to rip into them
[1:01:08] the sixes
[1:01:09] you have sown much
[1:01:12] and bring in little
[1:01:14] you eat but you have not enough
[1:01:17] you drink and you are not filled with
[1:01:20] drink
[1:01:21] he clothed you but there is none warm
[1:01:23] and he that earned wages earned wages to
[1:01:27] put it in a bag with holes
[1:01:33] in other words
[1:01:34] you're doing your thing
[1:01:36] no burden for Revival
[1:01:38] no burden for breakthrough no burden for
[1:01:41] this touch of man back in the church and
[1:01:44] individuals no burden for Holy Ghost not
[1:01:47] burden for nothing in the house there's
[1:01:49] some people
[1:01:54] they have zero burden
[1:01:59] none
[1:02:02] I remember when he was building this
[1:02:04] church what was involved or who was in
[1:02:06] the early days make sense and and toting
[1:02:10] bricks and and everything else that was
[1:02:12] a labor to bring it to where we are now
[1:02:15] and the people could walk in the
[1:02:17] building now and never have a clue
[1:02:20] how this got here
[1:02:24] and they may even feel the entitled to
[1:02:25] criticize
[1:02:27] they wasn't there for the foundation
[1:02:29] they wasn't there for the building they
[1:02:31] come when it's finished
[1:02:34] but there are things that God put in
[1:02:36] individuals
[1:02:38] that that that that only you could
[1:02:40] produce that only you could do that that
[1:02:42] you're called to it
[1:02:46] got that pick nobody else go Choose You
[1:02:51] and if he choose you it means he'll put
[1:02:53] something in you that's why he chose you
[1:02:55] he chooses the idol he actually to be
[1:02:57] like a like a leech like a parasite in
[1:03:00] church
[1:03:00] just sucking and drawing and benefiting
[1:03:03] and giving nothing back
[1:03:08] Hallelujah
[1:03:10] just like I don't know
[1:03:15] he's so much bring it little
[1:03:18] drink
[1:03:19] not filled with drink I've clothed not
[1:03:21] warm I hear Ernest witches and the
[1:03:24] witches put up in a back for the holes

[1:03:31] bless them but they can't show nothing
[1:03:32] for it because holes in the back

[1:12:09] see Faith first and virtue no remember
[1:12:11] here we go the Holy Spirit
[1:12:14] cannot cap the building of God
[1:12:18] until these things are operating by the
[1:12:22] spirit
[1:12:24] not by revelation
[1:12:27] but by the spirit
[1:12:29] because we could know the word know how
[1:12:30] we're supposed to I can behave and do it
[1:12:32] from a mechanical standpoint but he's

[1:12:59] and so forth is to be added until the
[1:13:02] complete study of Christ is made
[1:13:03] manifest then the Holy Spirit comes upon
[1:13:07] it
[1:13:08] and sees it as one body
[1:13:11] things must be and Jesus is by your
[1:13:14] fruit you are known and he said now

[1:13:18] are sealed to the day of your Redemption
[1:13:21] sealed into the kingdom of God don't
[1:13:23] forget that keep that in mind now take
[1:13:25] these things first then the ceiling is

[1:19:31] forth The Headstone thereof with
[1:19:32] shouting's crying Grace with unto it we
[1:19:35] are all acquainted with the scripture
[1:19:36] that reason the Bible we all know is
[1:19:38] during the time of the preparation of
[1:19:40] the restoration of the temple and
[1:19:41] zerubbabel was a great Prince among the
[1:19:43] people who had laid the foundation of
[1:19:45] the building now I want you to put on
[1:19:47] your spiritual thinking anointed jacket
[1:19:48] this morning as we think this great
[1:19:51] Prince had determined to rebuild the
[1:19:53] house of the Lord and when he did he did
[1:19:55] the foundation stone we read on further
[1:19:58] we found out God said the rule has laid
[1:20:00] the foundation with his hands he shall
[1:20:01] also bring forth The Headstone I want
[1:20:03] you to notice he never said he shall
[1:20:05] bring forth the Cornerstone he shall
[1:20:07] pray for The Headstone and we all know
[1:20:09] the scripture said that Jesus is the
[1:20:11] Chief Cornerstone and he also is a
[1:20:13] headstone and we will think for a few
[1:20:15] minutes that the seventh Church
[1:20:17] messenger was the restored of faith of
[1:20:19] the children back to the fathers in
[1:20:21] other words rebuild the church again
[1:20:23] under the power of the spirit not by
[1:20:26] might not by power but by my spirits he
[1:20:30] at the Lord not my organization not by
[1:20:32] denomination but by the Holy Spirit God
[1:20:35] will bring forth the church and the last
[1:20:37] days okay the Lord some Praises do you
[1:20:40] see what all ties together oh glory to

[1:20:51] forth The Headstone he had laid the
[1:20:53] foundation he took the people back to
[1:20:54] the foundation and type we all know that
[1:20:57] these candlesticks and so forth
[1:20:58] represented both Jewish and church there
[1:21:00] were Olive branches the Olive Branch we
[1:21:02] are the wild branch that was grafted
[1:21:04] into the root of the tame Olive Tree
[1:21:06] Gentiles and out of these two branches
[1:21:08] come ascensor pipes seven colon cancer
[1:21:11] six to give light to 70 ages not
[1:21:13] remembering our teaching on the lessons
[1:21:15] and you talk about the pyramid he said
[1:21:17] the architecture the stones could weigh
[1:21:19] tons and tons and tons and that's the
[1:21:21] way the body of Jesus Christ should be
[1:21:23] so cut because they were so they cut so
[1:21:25] cleanly so the body of Jesus Christ
[1:21:27] should be so cut by the Holy Spirit by
[1:21:29] God grace instrument and tool that will
[1:21:31] be joined as one person we are not
[1:21:33] divided we shall be one person it goes
[1:21:36] to show that no Machinery can do it that
[1:21:39] way it takes God to do that no mechanics
[1:21:42] of organization no lodges none of these
[1:21:44] things that ever do it as God as it as
[1:21:47] good the intentions are they can never
[1:21:49] do it because they will take God
[1:21:51] to do this the Holy Spirit
[1:21:54] oh my
[1:21:56] God hallelujah
[1:21:58] glory to God
[1:21:59] let me see if I can tell him
[1:22:03] my Lord my Lord my Lord
[1:22:05] Hallelujah
[1:22:08] praise God
[1:22:13] verse 10 of this chapter two
[1:22:16] in the fourth and 20th day of the ninth
[1:22:18] month in the second year so it's still
[1:22:20] the second year of Darius
[1:22:21] all this happened in second year of the
[1:22:23] arrested King the word of the Lord said
[1:22:26] prophet Isaiah the prophet singing thus
[1:22:29] hear the Lord of hosts
[1:22:31] acts no the priests considering the law
[1:22:35] she's going to bowl them I want to say
[1:22:38] googly pull him a ball
[1:22:40] ask the concerning the law
[1:22:43] hear the question I was asked if one be
[1:22:46] a holy flesh
[1:22:47] in the scoot of His Garment
[1:22:50] and with this could do touch bread or
[1:22:53] pottage or wine or oil or any meat shall
[1:22:58] it be holy
[1:22:59] question
[1:23:01] you have holy flesh
[1:23:03] all right in the skirt of your garment
[1:23:06] and if we're discuss you touch bread or
[1:23:09] pottage or wine or meat shall I be holy
[1:23:12] the priest answered and said no
[1:23:15] then here guy he said if one that is
[1:23:17] unclean
[1:23:18] by a dead body
[1:23:20] touch any of these shall be unclean
[1:23:24] and the priest answered and said it
[1:23:26] shall be unclean
[1:23:28] so in other words your car transfer
[1:23:30] holiness
[1:23:31] you can't take Holiness and and convert
[1:23:34] something into Holiness but it could
[1:23:36] take corruption and everything is
[1:23:37] starting to get corrupt
[1:23:40] you hear what is a question here
[1:23:42] he said if one that is unclean by a dead
[1:23:45] body touch any of these things shall it
[1:23:46] be unclean they said it shall be unclean
[1:23:49] then answered and said so is this people
[1:23:54] so is this nation before me said the
[1:23:57] Lord so is every work of their hands
[1:24:00] that which they offer there is unclean
[1:24:04] oh God help us tonight
[1:24:06] help us tonight

[1:24:09] trying to get to

[1:24:18] hands on her your heart I'm hand not
[1:24:20] lift up his soul to vanity no sworn
[1:24:23] defeat for me because you see with

[1:24:44] temple of the Lord since those days were
[1:24:46] when one came in a heap of 20 measures
[1:24:49] and they were over 10. one came into

[1:29:28] from death and Creed unto a Living Word
[1:29:31] of the Living God God's only provided
[1:29:33] time for this age his sons in the word
[1:29:35] age quickened by the spirit like a spark
[1:29:39] that's lit over something to make it
[1:29:41] alive season now in Heavenly places

[1:29:59] among you that brings here we go the
[1:30:02] entire fullness of the Goddess bodily
[1:30:05] among you
[1:30:07] couldn't do them as they age couldn't do
[1:30:09] any particular age but in the day when
[1:30:11] the Sonoma will be manifest revealed
[1:30:13] brought back the church together with
[1:30:15] the entire deity of God among his people
[1:30:17] showing this invisible sign manifesting
[1:30:20] himself like he did at the beginning he
[1:30:22] was manifested on Earth in the form of a
[1:30:24] prophet God promised in Malachi 4 by the
[1:30:27] rest of the scriptures don't like so
[1:30:29] quickly and I'm finished here
[1:30:33] is God's reflector me knows that the
[1:30:36] reflector doesn't reflect
[1:30:37] is in his reflection is something have
[1:30:40] to strike the reflector to make it
[1:30:42] reflect so a prophet is a chosen vessel
[1:30:45] of God that can't reflect nothing at all
[1:30:48] but he's in a direct line of that
[1:30:51] reflection God to reflect the image of
[1:30:54] Christ in the word nothing can do it you
[1:30:58] are reflector and that's the reason the
[1:31:00] prophet has to eat the book that's the
[1:31:03] reason he had to eat the scroll he had
[1:31:05] to reflect that word for that age you
[1:31:06] got it there's a final quote notice
[1:31:09] Enoch God's perfect reflecting type when
[1:31:13] God was true with him he just translated
[1:31:15] them took him up the mechanic that he
[1:31:18] had reflected became Dynamic with the
[1:31:20] spirit and took him up
[1:31:23] friends is a prophecy
[1:31:25] that the church will be rebuilt
[1:31:27] under the party spirit
[1:31:29] every gift have to find its place every
[1:31:32] person have to find their position in
[1:31:34] the body of Christ
[1:31:35] can't sit back as if you're on a tea
[1:31:37] break you can't sit back as if we have
[1:31:40] all this time you're doing your own
[1:31:42] thing running your own show having your

[1:31:45] been neglected We Could Be Few but that
[1:31:49] doesn't mean we cannot make it go tell
[1:31:51] them be strong they are the enemies
[1:31:53] within an enemies without and they were
[1:31:55] still able to accomplish God papers
