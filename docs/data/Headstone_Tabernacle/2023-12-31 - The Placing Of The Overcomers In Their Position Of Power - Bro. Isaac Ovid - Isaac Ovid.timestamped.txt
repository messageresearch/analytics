[57:50] Jesus that's why he said if thou be and
[57:53] Jesus he said I don't owe you an
[57:55] explanation it is written man shall not
[57:58] live by bread alone but by every word
[58:01] that proceed out of the mouth of God I
[58:03] don't have to explain where I come from
[58:05] I don't have to explain where I'm going
[58:07] you're going to see for
[58:09] yourself and most of jesus' ministry he
[58:12] kept saying the hour is not come the
[58:14] hour is not yet come it's not midnight
[58:17] yet the season hasn't changed yet but
[58:19] there's coming a time when the season is
[58:21] going to change and when the season
[58:22] changes I can't help myself
[58:25] can the church say
[58:27] amen that's only 80% can the church say
[58:31] Amen we're going to make the church
[58:33] comfortable for some and uncomfortable
[58:36] for others Hallelujah the prophet taught
[58:38] us there's noise in heaven and there's
[58:40] noise in hell I'm going to pick the
[58:42] Heavenly noise any day any time under

[59:10] see who's in church tonight Hallelujah
[59:13] you know the devil gets Disturbed when
[59:14] you break the routine when you break the
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:22] ordinary anybody here
[59:25] you may be seated driving to church at
[59:28] one point I don't know what your
[59:29] experience was but part of the road had
[59:31] no electricity I say what is this I
[59:34] wonder if I have Curren in church then
[59:36] at one point your Reigns come and say
[59:38] but what is this all kind of say look is
[59:40] it the enemy fighting and I see them
[59:41] were Good Neighbor Next having a little
[59:43] party I say well what trouble is this
[59:45] every side the enemy trying to do
[59:47] something but listen when the Bride of
[59:49] Jesus Christ comes visible that's why
[59:52] listen there's no Victory without a
[59:53] battle
[59:57] you heard brother U said this morning
[59:59] God will bless the work of your hands
[1:00:02] you got to do something with your hands
[1:00:04] for God to bless without doing something
[1:00:06] the prophet said you got to do something
[1:00:08] for something to happen so I want to
[1:00:10] challenge you tonight give God a big
[1:00:12] shout of
[1:00:21] worship
[1:00:23] Hallelujah you may be
[1:00:25] there are people in here tonight who are
[1:00:27] sick with all kind of conditions do you
[1:00:29] know when you worship God those diseases
[1:00:31] start to
[1:00:33] tremble oh you don't hear me tonight you
[1:00:36] know when you give God praise demons
[1:00:38] those diseases start to say what going
[1:00:40] on here
[1:00:44] boy because you creating an atmosphere
[1:00:47] and especially when it defies the
[1:00:49] expectation oh those demons like it to
[1:00:51] stay normal and stressed out and
[1:00:54] frustrated
[1:00:55] but I believe we are changing a season
[1:00:57] and it takes the Holy Spirit to drop
[1:00:59] upon you to create an atmosphere for a
[1:01:02] new birth for the Holy Ghost himself to
[1:01:05] connect with your 16 elements drop down
[1:01:08] into the socket of your soul you may be
[1:01:14] seated I'm not going to be too long with
[1:01:16] you we just have a conversation into the
[1:01:19] new year can we talk about Jesus the
[1:01:22] prophet said when we talk about him he
[1:01:23] draws near you know he likes to be the
[1:01:26] center of our joy the center of our
[1:01:28] conversation the center of our
[1:01:31] [Applause]
[1:01:35] deliberation but teren the temperature
[1:01:38] has to feel
[1:01:40] comfortable we still have a few other
[1:01:41] people but I believe we have
[1:01:43] enough who brought their fire brother
[1:01:46] George to light up the rest of
[1:01:52] them Hallelujah
[1:01:55] brother Stephen hallelujah we're going
[1:01:57] to create an atmosphere and run them
[1:01:59] Devils out oh Hallelujah so I got a
[1:02:02] title for this evening the placing of
[1:02:05] the Overcomers in their position of
[1:02:09] power I'll say that one more time the
[1:02:12] placing of the Overcomers in their
[1:02:14] position of power God has an objective
[1:02:18] of this whole thing it may come as a
[1:02:20] surprise to you but God is not in the
[1:02:22] church business you know
[1:02:25] that's right right we are not here
[1:02:27] because God just wants to have a church
[1:02:30] he wants to have a church for an
[1:02:33] objective he says the fivefold ministry
[1:02:35] is for the perfecting of the Saints so
[1:02:37] what happens when the saints get
[1:02:38] perfect for the edifying of the body
[1:02:41] what happen when the body is edified for
[1:02:42] the unity of the FI what happens when it
[1:02:44] happens then the ministry of the fold is
[1:02:47] over because it's to an end God wants a
[1:02:50] direct relationship with you and to get
[1:02:52] you into that relationship that relation
[1:02:54] ship comes with
[1:02:55] power so God is looking to place some
[1:02:58] Overcomers not church
[1:03:00] members not people who made it to church
[1:03:03] on Hest night
[1:03:05] only but Overcomers you overcome the job
[1:03:09] you overcome what's happening in your
[1:03:11] home you overcome the financial issues
[1:03:14] you heard brother Olu speaking about the
[1:03:15] crisis don't waste your crisis you
[1:03:17] overcome the crisis you overcome
[1:03:19] negativity you overcome gossiping you
[1:03:22] overcome what people say about you you
[1:03:24] overcome how you feel you overcome your
[1:03:27] yesterday you overcome last week you

[1:03:57] devil but the BAM said you overcome
[1:03:59] false Christ you overcome false teaching
[1:04:02] you overcome it
[1:04:06] all and because you overcome there's a
[1:04:09] blessing that is just for the Overcomers
[1:04:12] can the church say
[1:04:18] Amen so my title the placing of the
[1:04:21] Overcomers in their position of power
[1:04:23] for a subject David's son David's key
[1:04:28] and David's
[1:04:30] Throne David's son David's key and
[1:04:34] David's throne and for an inspiration to
[1:04:37] him that overcome it and we read that
[1:04:41] scripture in Revelation to the angel of
[1:04:44] the church in Philadelphia
[1:04:46] right and mam taught us that each of
[1:04:49] these churches or church ages is this
[1:04:53] great bride of Jesus Jesus Christ to
[1:04:54] different that dispensations and all you
[1:04:56] were speaking to it could be said a
[1:04:59] geographical location what is said there
[1:05:01] in that spiritual age is also relevant
[1:05:03] to us
[1:05:04] today these things said he that is Holy
[1:05:08] we know he's talking about the Lord
[1:05:10] Jesus Christ himself he that is true he
[1:05:13] is truth he that hath the Key of David
[1:05:16] yes sir and in this one scripture here
[1:05:18] in the Book of Revelation picks up this
[1:05:20] key of David that is only mentioned one
[1:05:23] time in the Old
[1:05:26] Testament and we'll speak a little bit
[1:05:28] about it can the church say Amen so I
[1:05:31] believe tonight this evening that we are
[1:05:33] Mysteries you are
[1:05:34] mystery your mystery to the world your
[1:05:36] mystery to your family your mystery to
[1:05:38] your neighbors your mystery to a lot of
[1:05:40] people they don't understand what what
[1:05:42] has you going why would you leave your
[1:05:44] home in a night and come to a service
[1:05:45] like this why you come all year why you
[1:05:47] believe a prophet why I believe this
[1:05:49] message what and it's because you're
[1:05:51] mystery you have even been a mystery to
[1:05:53] yourself because you can't explain when
[1:05:56] the Revelation dropped into your soul
[1:05:58] the change that came over you that
[1:06:00] pushed you even when you didn't
[1:06:02] understand something kept you coming all
[1:06:04] [Applause]
[1:06:06] along something keeps you coming it's
[1:06:09] not you but there's something in you
[1:06:11] that's mysterious because God is a
[1:06:13] mystery and God that mysterious God put
[1:06:16] a mystery inside of you that even you
[1:06:18] can't figure out yet but during the
[1:06:20] fullness of time that mystery becomes
[1:06:22] plain and becomes visible to you you
[1:06:24] because Christ is a mystery of God
[1:06:25] revealed and Christ wants to make
[1:06:27] himself known to us your mystery to your
[1:06:30] family mystery to your friends mystery
[1:06:32] to your neighbors even when you make a
[1:06:34] mistake and the devil think you're
[1:06:36] finished you're mystery to him because
[1:06:38] somehow you still find yourself back in
[1:06:40] the house of God and he learn right you
[1:06:42] off already but punch you know what time
[1:06:44] the devil say well that is it he G
[1:06:46] through you know what time the devil say
[1:06:48] that sister finish but here you are this
[1:06:51] evening and he don't try to figure out
[1:06:54] what is
[1:06:55] this how come and after you went through
[1:06:58] that you still in church the devil
[1:07:01] confus this evening you know all of us
[1:07:03] have enough reasons to not be here
[1:07:05] tonight but we have more reasons to be
[1:07:08] here tonight oh you don't hear me this
[1:07:10] even the mystery in US is bigger than
[1:07:13] our
[1:07:16] problems anybody can identify with that
[1:07:19] you know much time listen you may be
[1:07:21] seated so you don't think eyes get
[1:07:22] depressed
[1:07:25] amen but punch they don't think I get
[1:07:28] depressed you I get
[1:07:31] frustrated I don't want to speak for the
[1:07:33] pastor
[1:07:35] but you don't think he get
[1:07:37] frustrated but didn't Elijah after the
[1:07:40] mount carel experience tried to commit
[1:07:43] suicide didn't the prophet try to commit
[1:07:45] suicide cuz he was so
[1:07:48] low Elijah says best you take my life
[1:07:51] this is after a great Victory you know
[1:07:54] so depression coming in the thing you
[1:07:56] know frustration is part of the thing
[1:07:58] you know being upset and frustrated
[1:08:00] that's part of the thing but something
[1:08:02] comes inside of you that overcomes the
[1:08:05] depression overcomes the frustration
[1:08:07] there's a voice saying don't bother to
[1:08:09] worship but something else kicks in and
[1:08:12] said he is worthy of the worship he is
[1:08:15] worthy of the praise and that's
[1:08:17] overcoming that's built inside of
[1:08:21] you anybody in the church tonight
[1:08:26] and but the BR said overcoming keeps
[1:08:28] life in you so when you get a hot trial
[1:08:31] you know what God is saying oh God
[1:08:32] giving them some
[1:08:34] life turn up the trial turn up the
[1:08:37] testing get a flat tire let your roof
[1:08:40] blow off something happened on the job
[1:08:43] this happened and when you're there some
[1:08:44] of you you have a fighting and and and
[1:08:46] it look as if you're fighting up but
[1:08:47] you're just staying
[1:08:49] alive you know if you sit down for hours
[1:08:52] and days and months and weeks and don't
[1:08:54] move after while you reckon you can't
[1:08:59] move but the pun of that sisters here
[1:09:02] afraid spider it don't matter how lazy
[1:09:05] somebody is if they see a spider and
[1:09:06] they afraid of it they get it up and
[1:09:07] moveing
[1:09:09] them so God has has send things in your
[1:09:11] life to get you moving and when you move
[1:09:13] your heart start to pump your muscles
[1:09:15] start to move and then before you
[1:09:16] realize you recognize that's when
[1:09:18] adrenaline kicks in and God sends things
[1:09:21] different things your way to keep you
[1:09:22] moving
[1:09:24] you move from here to move from there
[1:09:25] because your car stand still if God
[1:09:27] knows you're moving to the promised land
[1:09:29] because every place you put your foot is
[1:09:31] yours so if you stood still for MOS 2023
[1:09:35] let that die in 2023 because we moving
[1:09:38] into 2024 and we don't want to stop
[1:09:39] moving I might be moving slow but I want
[1:09:41] to keep
[1:09:43] moving I want to keep I don't want to
[1:09:45] stop I can't afford to stop can the
[1:09:47] church say Amen somebody give God a sh
[1:09:49] of
[1:09:52] praise
[1:09:57] hallah so God has promises just for
[1:10:00] Overcomers not for church
[1:10:04] members Adam could have never claimed
[1:10:06] these promises because he had nothing to
[1:10:09] overcome before the
[1:10:11] fall so the promises for Overcomers
[1:10:14] could not have been for
[1:10:16] Adam because he had no temptation he had
[1:10:19] no trial no test he had no back pain he
[1:10:22] had no rent he had no back pay he had
[1:10:26] nothing and God
[1:10:28] interrupt allowed it to be interrupted
[1:10:31] so that Adam had to overcome and you
[1:10:32] read script in Revelation because Jesus
[1:10:35] is saying there in the scripture to him
[1:10:37] that
[1:10:38] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:10:40] in my throne even as I also
[1:10:44] overcame so Jesus himself had to
[1:10:46] overcome Jesus himself had to learn
[1:10:49] obedience by the things that he suffered
[1:10:52] we have to learn learn obedience
[1:10:55] obedience to his word obedience to his
[1:10:58] will obedience to his purpose obedience
[1:11:01] to his vision for us obedience for what
[1:11:04] he wants us to
[1:11:06] do and if Jesus had to learn it by
[1:11:09] suffering how you want to learn
[1:11:13] it but over they see the amen just just
[1:11:19] disappear
[1:11:21] Hallelujah Adam could have never been an
[1:11:23] overcomer but we here this evening we
[1:11:25] are Overcomers and we will continue to
[1:11:27] be Overcomers can the church say amen
[1:11:30] hallelujah friends we must never forget
[1:11:32] the grace of God in our
[1:11:34] lives because our ability to overcome is
[1:11:37] only by the grace of God our ability to
[1:11:40] be here tonight is only by the grace of
[1:11:42] God can the church say Amen there's
[1:11:45] nobody here tonight because they earned
[1:11:47] it or they deserve it we are all here
[1:11:49] tonight as trophies of his grace if you
[1:11:52] are here in the house of God tonight you
[1:11:54] are here by the grace of God I am here
[1:11:56] by the grace of God that is enough for
[1:11:58] you to shout and worship the pastors
[1:12:01] here by the grace of God the assistant
[1:12:03] pastor is here by the grace of God the
[1:12:05] ministers the deacons ERS all by the
[1:12:07] grace of God nobody's better than nobody
[1:12:10] because the grace of God makes us equal
[1:12:13] through the blood God looks at us and
[1:12:15] say there's my bride coming into
[1:12:22] you
[1:12:24] let us not forget what God brought us
[1:12:26] from we may not be what we want to be
[1:12:29] but we certainly not what we used to be
[1:12:31] can the church say Amen it is not our
[1:12:33] ability it is not our effort it's the
[1:12:35] grace of God to us that he predestinated
[1:12:38] us to see what we see and to be part of
[1:12:40] this great unfolding of this mystery can
[1:12:42] the church say amen hallelujah so can I
[1:12:46] get to my thought a little
[1:12:52] bit in a message
[1:12:55] Revelations chapter 5 but the BAM said
[1:12:58] Jesus the name Jesus in The Gospel has
[1:13:00] four titles of son amen one is the son
[1:13:03] of David one is son of Abraham one is
[1:13:07] Son of Man and the other is Son of God
[1:13:10] when our kinsman redeemer become Jesus
[1:13:12] Christ he become the son of David which
[1:13:14] is heir to the throne he Heir the throne
[1:13:17] by being a son of David God told back
[1:13:20] there that he would never leave David
[1:13:23] without a seed and Christ is the son of
[1:13:25] David and he became our kinsman redeemer
[1:13:28] waiting getting a place ready to where
[1:13:30] he can reign with us as the son of David
[1:13:34] he's heir to the throne as the son of
[1:13:37] Abraham he's heir to the Royal
[1:13:40] Grant Palestine and all that's in her
[1:13:42] Abraham seed he is a son of Abraham as
[1:13:45] the son of man what does son of man what
[1:13:47] did man lose he lost the Earth so as a
[1:13:49] son of man he's air to everything in the
[1:13:51] Earth all this he's got and he has to
[1:13:54] give it back to us then he's returning
[1:13:56] back as he was now then a Son of God he
[1:13:58] inherits all things andam summarizes as
[1:14:01] the son of David air to the throne son
[1:14:03] of Abraham air to the Royal Grant son of
[1:14:06] man air to the Earth Son of God air to
[1:14:08] all things in heaven and earth now many
[1:14:10] years ago I preached a message that God
[1:14:13] gave jurisdiction to man for this Earth
[1:14:16] we have no jurisdiction in heaven amen
[1:14:19] Heaven belongs to God that's why the
[1:14:21] Bible says we shall reign on the
[1:14:24] we have no authority to re in heaven God
[1:14:26] has a throne in heaven it's a Heavenly
[1:14:29] Throne we don't have the authority to
[1:14:31] set in that Heavenly throne but there's
[1:14:33] a throne that CS this Earth and that's
[1:14:36] the throne that was given to King
[1:14:39] David can the church say Amen anybody
[1:14:42] with me so when Jesus came as son of
[1:14:45] David it gave him right and access to
[1:14:48] that Throne can the church say Amen but
[1:14:51] there has to be a way for us to get to
[1:14:53] that Throne because we are promised
[1:14:55] jurisdiction and authority and Power on
[1:14:57] this Earth can the church say Amen
[1:15:00] everybody with me so when man fell God
[1:15:03] couldn't even deal with a situation from
[1:15:05] up in
[1:15:05] heaven because as a spiritual being he
[1:15:08] had no jurisdiction to come on the earth
[1:15:11] and deal with the situation so you had
[1:15:13] to take the form of man because only a
[1:15:16] man who has the authority to be a heir
[1:15:18] to the Earth could come down and deal
[1:15:20] with Earth business so Jesus gave up his
[1:15:23] authority in heaven took on 16 elements
[1:15:26] and walked the Earth like you and I
[1:15:29] suffered like you and I ate food like
[1:15:31] you and I wept like you and I at the
[1:15:35] grave of Lazarus but when he dried his
[1:15:37] tears and said Lazarus Comfort it was
[1:15:41] more than
[1:15:45] man can the church say amen and but the
[1:15:49] Terence in that form he couldn't even go
[1:15:51] down to Hell because you needed to have
[1:15:53] sin on you to go down into hell so Jesus
[1:15:56] had to take your sin it wasn't a matter
[1:15:59] of he he wanted to take it he had to
[1:16:01] take your sin because he needed sin to
[1:16:04] be upon him so he could go down into
[1:16:06] hell and walk up to the devil and take
[1:16:09] away the
[1:16:11] keys of sin and hell can the church say
[1:16:14] amen and that's why remember the Brandon
[1:16:16] preach House of Hell give way to the
[1:16:18] name of Jesus because Jesus took the
[1:16:21] keys the devil doesn't even have keys
[1:16:23] for his own kingdom oh you don't hear me
[1:16:29] tonight no wonder we could preach and
[1:16:32] the word of God could set you free
[1:16:34] because the devil cannot lock you up
[1:16:36] Hallelujah Johnny CR the devil has no
[1:16:38] power to lock you up he has no right to
[1:16:41] keep sickness in your body he has no
[1:16:43] right to keep your son your daughter
[1:16:46] your finances your
[1:16:48] health you could walk out today if you
[1:16:51] want to go
[1:16:52] free or you don't hear me tonight you
[1:16:54] could walk free if you want to go free
[1:16:56] come and go with me to my father's house
[1:16:59] can the church say Amen somebody give
[1:17:01] God a shout of Praise anybody in the
[1:17:03] house
[1:17:04] [Music]
[1:17:09] tonight
[1:17:10] Hallelujah woo but brand continues in
[1:17:14] that same quot now notice oh this does
[1:17:16] me so good this is where I get a really
[1:17:19] good feeling now listen let your heart
[1:17:21] loose to God just for a few minutes
[1:17:23] Satan is a
[1:17:27] squatter this Earth has a owner this
[1:17:30] Earth have somebody who name comeing to
[1:17:32] sit down on the
[1:17:34] throne butam said he don't legally own
[1:17:37] this and he has had 2,000 years of fuss
[1:17:40] whether he owns it or somebody else owns
[1:17:44] it but a punch for 2,000 years he devil
[1:17:47] fussing with who own this thing
[1:17:52] boy
[1:17:54] but Christ came as the kinsman redeemer
[1:17:58] and redeeming back to us but Satan is
[1:18:00] currently in possession of it that's
[1:18:02] right but you know after a while this
[1:18:05] great fight is going to be over and
[1:18:07] he'll be cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:18:09] he'll be done away with and all them who
[1:18:11] worshiped with him but the HS of
[1:18:13] Salvation will come with Christ can the
[1:18:15] church say Amen oh
[1:18:17] Hallelujah so come on you Overcomers I
[1:18:20] want to let you know who you are tied to
[1:18:23] two Sundays or so ago I preached about
[1:18:25] the sacrifice the perfect sacrifice
[1:18:28] making a way for the living sacrifices
[1:18:31] and we spoke about the priesthood that
[1:18:33] you are born into we spoke about the
[1:18:35] fact that before there ever was a king
[1:18:37] God told Moses you going to have a
[1:18:39] kingdom of priests and he said something
[1:18:42] that nobody could have understood for
[1:18:44] hundreds of
[1:18:46] years to give individuals Gentiles
[1:18:49] Divine access to the priesthood but it's
[1:18:51] not just priests you are also
[1:18:53] Kings you are Kings and Priests so we
[1:18:56] spoke about the Divine priesthood that
[1:18:58] you belong to today I'm talking about
[1:19:00] the kingship that you belong to because
[1:19:02] you are
[1:19:03] royalty from the moment you were born
[1:19:06] you are royalty you could have been born
[1:19:08] in a hut you got to be born on top of
[1:19:10] tree you going to be I don't care where
[1:19:11] you're born your royalty and somebody
[1:19:13] who's born into royalty they don't even
[1:19:15] know their royalty until they are told
[1:19:18] that they are royalty you don't hear me
[1:19:19] this evening if you're born into royalty
[1:19:22] somebody hiding a village and you don't
[1:19:23] know who you are you will grow up
[1:19:24] thinking you're just normal in the
[1:19:26] village until somebody Whispers to you
[1:19:28] you know who your father is you know you
[1:19:30] own that land you know that castle
[1:19:32] belongs to you you know if they only
[1:19:33] realize who you are they have to open up
[1:19:36] because royalty runs in your veins you
[1:19:38] have legal right to walk in there
[1:19:40] anytime because your father was the king
[1:19:43] but your father died and he left it for
[1:19:45] you you can either stay in this Village
[1:19:47] for the rest of your life or you could
[1:19:48] shake yourself and walk to the castle
[1:19:50] and see a coming for what's mine and
[1:19:52] that's what our position is this
[1:19:55] evening our Kinsman Rea di wrote your
[1:19:59] name on the will and say come and take
[1:20:01] it whenever you want to take it come on
[1:20:02] now somebody give God a shout of
[1:20:05] [Applause]
[1:20:12] Praise so Jesus we know our great
[1:20:17] God when Jesus came he came as prophet
[1:20:21] he came as king and he came as priest
[1:20:24] amen this Great Divine mystery in three
[1:20:27] Hallelujah he's Father Son and Holy
[1:20:29] Ghost this mystery of tree he's a lamb
[1:20:32] he's a lion and he's a
[1:20:34] lamb a lion a lamb and he's an eagle
[1:20:37] come the church say Amen this Great
[1:20:39] Divine mystery but connected to us he's
[1:20:42] son of
[1:20:44] David that's connected to us because
[1:20:47] true sunship and being a son of David is
[1:20:49] about the kingly inheritance amen that
[1:20:52] we are in title too yes and David didn't
[1:20:55] know he was a
[1:20:56] King David grew up not knowing he was a
[1:20:59] king he grew up as somebody who couldn't
[1:21:01] be even in the Army he grew up as the
[1:21:04] one to raise the Sheep he was so
[1:21:06] overlooked that when Samuel came to
[1:21:08] anoint a a king they didn't even decide
[1:21:11] to call him they presented everybody
[1:21:14] else who look like king walk like King
[1:21:16] act like King and they say listen you
[1:21:18] don't have
[1:21:19] anymore they said we just have one more
[1:21:21] fell day I don't think he's he when
[1:21:23] looking for you know call
[1:21:25] David and when David come Samuel pour
[1:21:28] the whole horn oil the whole horn in Fr
[1:21:33] the brothers say but where is David boy
[1:21:35] going and David went back quietly to his
[1:21:38] sheep in the backside of the desert and
[1:21:41] God is unveiling a great mystery that he
[1:21:43] could take you from being hidden he
[1:21:46] could take you from being a nobody he
[1:21:47] could take you from being somebody
[1:21:49] people underestimate he could take you
[1:21:51] from being from a simple family from a
[1:21:53] simple position he wasn't a soldier he
[1:21:56] wasn't an overachiever you know in
[1:21:57] school there's right person most likely
[1:21:59] to succeed but that wasn't David they
[1:22:02] had no big expectation of David but when
[1:22:04] David got the Horn of oil upon him and
[1:22:06] he was anointed he was now an anointed
[1:22:09] shepherd He oh come on now somebody

[1:22:45] doesn't choose the way politician shoes
[1:22:47] he is different he looks at a heart and
[1:22:49] that's why he can say David a man after
[1:22:52] my own heart Elijah didn't get that
[1:22:55] Moses didn't get
[1:22:57] that just David and we'll understand why
[1:23:01] this thing is so important could you
[1:23:03] take some more anybody sleeping Deacon
[1:23:06] just check just take a quick
[1:23:08] [Applause]
[1:23:11] check God unfolding his great plan God
[1:23:15] hinting to what he was going to unfill
[1:23:17] all the way back to Genesis there was
[1:23:19] Abraham Abraham was no prophet he was a
[1:23:21] father of faith but yet God allowed me
[1:23:23] to meet MDC the king of Salem the great
[1:23:27] king priest and Abraham paid tith to
[1:23:30] mzed not even fully comprehending the
[1:23:32] great mystery unfolding that he was
[1:23:34] actually paying tis and this same mzc
[1:23:38] was the root and Offspring this was
[1:23:39] Christ meeting
[1:23:42] Abraham can the church say Amen but
[1:23:45] Abraham said he had no beginning he has
[1:23:46] no talking about mzc he had no father he
[1:23:49] had no mother he was simple Abraham with
[1:23:51] no books no tapes no Bible nothing and
[1:23:54] here he is the great prince prince of
[1:23:56] Salem can the church say
[1:23:58] Amen the king of Peace the king of
[1:24:00] righteousness he was not only a king he
[1:24:02] was a priest he was the Prince of Peace
[1:24:04] the rose of Sharon lily of the valley
[1:24:06] I'm reading from the Prophet The Morning
[1:24:08] Star the alpha omega he that was which
[1:24:11] is and shall come B the root and
[1:24:13] offspring of
[1:24:14] David but said he was before David in
[1:24:18] David and after David
[1:24:21] amen
[1:24:23] God was setting up brother Lyon this
[1:24:25] King thing a long time
[1:24:28] ago in Genesis 49 Jacob pronounced his
[1:24:32] blessings upon all his sons sometime I'm
[1:24:35] going to speak of
[1:24:40] it let me just read one scripture before
[1:24:42] I get to this one we have some time
[1:24:46] right check in to make
[1:24:48] sure there one verse I want to get to
[1:24:50] but before I want to get to something
[1:24:51] else first
[1:24:54] and Jacob called unto his sons and said
[1:24:56] Gather yourselves together that I may
[1:24:58] tell you that which shall befall you in
[1:25:00] the last
[1:25:03] days you imagine
[1:25:05] that come let me tell you what's going
[1:25:07] to happen to
[1:25:09] you listen to
[1:25:11] this gather yourselves together and hear
[1:25:14] ye sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel
[1:25:16] your father amen and he speaks to each
[1:25:19] one of them yes he sat up with Reuben
[1:25:23] Ruben Thou Art my
[1:25:26] firstborn my might and the beginning of
[1:25:29] my strength the Excellency of dignity
[1:25:33] and the Excellency of
[1:25:37] power unstable as
[1:25:43] water Thou shalt not
[1:25:47] Excel you
[1:25:49] imagine a father telling a son you shall
[1:25:52] not not
[1:25:54] Excel and that's prophecy you know we'll
[1:25:57] get our Bible study and that and why
[1:25:58] that is way but what I want to get to is
[1:26:00] verse 8
[1:26:02] Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren
[1:26:04] shall
[1:26:06] praise thy hand shall be in the neck of
[1:26:09] thine enemies thy father's children
[1:26:11] shall bow down before thee Judah is a
[1:26:14] lion's WEP from the pray my son thou had
[1:26:18] gone up he stooped down he crouched as a
[1:26:21] lion as a as an oh lion who shall Rous
[1:26:23] him up the scepter shall not depart from
[1:26:27] Judah nor a lawgiver from between his
[1:26:30] feet until Shiloh come can the church
[1:26:32] say Amen so God setting up this King
[1:26:35] thing he dropping a piece here he
[1:26:37] dropping a piece there he drop a piece
[1:26:39] on Judah and the king the scepter will
[1:26:42] live in Judah so now you wonder now when
[1:26:45] the children of Israel reach Point say
[1:26:46] we want a king you you remember that and
[1:26:49] he say Samuel we want a king because
[1:26:51] everybody else have
[1:26:53] King Samuel was grieved and God had to
[1:26:57] tell Samuel well they haven't rejected
[1:26:58] you no they rejected me and you know who
[1:27:00] they pick Saul what tribe was Saul from
[1:27:03] benjam how are
[1:27:06] benjamite getting
[1:27:08] thrown when the promise of the scepter
[1:27:11] is in Judah so it goes and and this is
[1:27:13] not something but upon today know you
[1:27:15] know I think I said it in the message
[1:27:16] last time people have the books and the
[1:27:18] tapes and you wonder if they already
[1:27:19] have the books and tapes you know
[1:27:20] because if those brethren had the books
[1:27:22] and the tapes they say but didn't they
[1:27:24] say that deceptor is from
[1:27:26] Judah but they weren't looking at the
[1:27:28] word they say sa
[1:27:30] tall that what the Bible said and he has
[1:27:32] a nice countenance he Head and Shoulders
[1:27:34] over everybody else we like
[1:27:38] that tall
[1:27:40] man so Saul is appointed King based on
[1:27:45] looks but they have quotes that supposed
[1:27:48] to say there's any King supposed to be
[1:27:49] from
[1:27:50] Judah amen am can the church say amen
[1:27:54] amen could you take some more good good
[1:27:59] good so David though what tribe is David
[1:28:02] from Judah the tribe of Judah but
[1:28:04] Terence rolling with me
[1:28:07] tonight so David meet the check mark of
[1:28:10] the right
[1:28:11] tribe now we have to go to the right
[1:28:13] training cuz all the time he just being
[1:28:15] Shepherd part but when we look at David
[1:28:18] we could think about many things and I
[1:28:19] preach about David a man after God's Own
[1:28:20] Heart before and when we think about we
[1:28:23] think about the Psalms of David the
[1:28:25] songs of David the worship of David the
[1:28:28] heart of David the leadership of David
[1:28:31] the repentance of David the faith of
[1:28:33] David the Covenant of David the
[1:28:36] anointing of David the Friendship of
[1:28:38] David the victories of David we think of
[1:28:41] Our Shepherd King we think of the legacy
[1:28:43] of David we think of the trials of David
[1:28:46] we think of the Poetry of David we think
[1:28:48] of David as a musician we think about
[1:28:50] David dancing there's no other biblical
[1:28:52] character who you see from a young man
[1:28:54] to an old man on his dead bed like David
[1:28:57] no wonder God could see he's a man after
[1:28:59] my own
[1:29:01] heart in so much that when Jesus come
[1:29:04] he's the son of David even though David
[1:29:07] had his mistake Jesus said I'm the son
[1:29:09] of David oh can the church say Amen oh
[1:29:14] hallelujah
[1:29:16] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:29:18] Lord and I preached this before when he
[1:29:20] thinking about David and this is so
[1:29:22] relevant to us as we end the year here
[1:29:24] David speak in Psalms 23 the Lord is my
[1:29:27] shepherd has he been your Shepherd for
[1:29:29] this year I shall not want he maketh me
[1:29:31] to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth
[1:29:34] me beside the Still Waters he restoreth
[1:29:37] my soul he leadth me in the paths of
[1:29:39] righteousness for his name's sake yeah
[1:29:42] do I walk through the valley of the
[1:29:44] shadow of death is not death know is the
[1:29:46] shadow of it I will fear no evil for
[1:29:49] thou art with me thy rod and thy staff
[1:29:52] is there anybody can testify of this

[1:30:04] run it over that's my prophecy for you
[1:30:07] as we go into 2024 may your cup run over
[1:30:12] can the church say
[1:30:15] Amen surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:30:18] follow me all the days of my life and I
[1:30:21] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:30:22] forever make this my permanent Dwelling
[1:30:25] Place I don't want to leave his presence
[1:30:27] I don't want to leave his house I don't
[1:30:29] want to leave his anointing I don't want
[1:30:31] to leave his safety I don't want to

[1:40:06] pages and this David we talking
[1:40:10] about I'm when your low moments and I
[1:40:12] want to encourage young people the
[1:40:14] Psalms is a great place to encourage
[1:40:18] yourself every day
[1:40:21] you should read something in
[1:40:26] there there are few things in this life
[1:40:29] you have control
[1:40:32] over and one of the most powerful things
[1:40:34] you have control over is your mindset
[1:40:37] your mind your
[1:40:39] thinking change your thinking you change
[1:40:43] your
[1:40:43] life that's why the Bible could say be
[1:40:46] transformed by
[1:40:49] the renewing of your mind
[1:40:52] mind be careful what you listen to and
[1:40:55] watch just before you go to
[1:40:58] sleep because you are programming your
[1:41:01] mind into certain
[1:41:04] things be careful what you do when you
[1:41:06] wake up in the
[1:41:08] morning because you're programming your
[1:41:10] whole
[1:41:14] day I encourage you as you go into this
[1:41:16] new year I know people who are not even
[1:41:19] churchgoers who commit to reading the
[1:41:21] Bible they have those apps now a Bible
[1:41:23] in a
[1:41:25] year a scripture every day brother
[1:41:27] Anthony and the purpose and they go to
[1:41:30] church one I say but look at the
[1:41:32] discipline and they will attribute their
[1:41:35] business success to that discipline and
[1:41:38] believers who supposed to know read your
[1:41:40] Bible and pray every day don't have
[1:41:44] the I can't say the word
[1:41:49] discipline because some of us didn't get
[1:41:52] enough
[1:41:55] discipline so life have to you see what
[1:41:57] brother preach this
[1:41:58] morning some of us don't have the
[1:42:00] finance you don't any finances
[1:42:08] in go listen to the message this morning
[1:42:10] again and the one from last
[1:42:12] week he said lot of money L for

[1:42:17] what I look
[1:42:18] like because only when the situation
[1:42:21] come and you really have money you could
[1:42:22] really have a chest about it you there
[1:42:26] with your
[1:42:29] $20 but let some let let somebody get a
[1:42:32] million dollars and you see you can't
[1:42:33] see you for a year USC church church
[1:42:36] where why chur address
[1:42:38] again you and cruise all of a sudden you
[1:42:42] are
[1:42:44] Cruiser give somebody enough money they
[1:42:47] will take her to rocket to space
[1:42:48] something you know I want I want new new
[1:42:50] experiences in life and that's why many
[1:42:53] of us God can't bless us too
[1:42:58] much a little bit of money and and your
[1:43:01] whole your thing
[1:43:03] change from rituals to Starbucks let me
[1:43:05] not
[1:43:12] start I whole life
[1:43:18] change and God is on the prepare you
[1:43:21] because God wants to bless you you know
[1:43:24] you know what Bram said you are God's

[1:43:31] comfortable to say that is my blessing
[1:43:34] and you could say well I'm only a trophy
[1:43:36] of his grace am but the moment God
[1:43:39] blessed some of us is like but if you
[1:43:41] know hard I
[1:43:43] study I say study had but it's how you
[1:43:46] say it see if it wasn't for the Lord who
[1:43:49] helped me study

[1:43:53] difference that's why the say in all thy
[1:43:56] ways but you know the thing
[1:43:59] man let me live the thing now in all thy
[1:44:03] ways acknowledge Him all your
[1:44:06] ways and this is the practicality of the
[1:44:09] Gospel some of us miss because if you're
[1:44:12] about to lose your handle and fly off
[1:44:14] your handle find a way to acknowledge
[1:44:17] Him just before you fly off try it just
[1:44:18] before you're about to fly off the
[1:44:20] handle acknowledge Him and watch what
[1:44:23] [Applause]
[1:44:25] happens you know but to go and answer
[1:44:28] the boss and before you answer back you

[1:44:34] presence all of a sudden you forget

[1:44:48] right words to talk talk to the
[1:44:53] neighbor I guarantee you you will talk
[1:44:57] different Lord I acknowledge you have a
[1:44:59] meeting today help me pick the right
[1:45:01] clothes oh Lord help
[1:45:03] me Lord I going to school I want to help
[1:45:06] me pick the right music to listen to
[1:45:09] now I see some of the younger people
[1:45:13] smiling because when you acknowledge Him
[1:45:15] in your music choice in
[1:45:18] your in your dress choice and all of a
[1:45:21] sudden you have to live like a Christian
[1:45:23] you
[1:45:23] know it no longer becomes a rules thing
[1:45:26] well I have a rule you know as a
[1:45:27] Christian you know I don't wear makeup
[1:45:29] and I don't wear earring and I don't
[1:45:30] wear pants no you acknowledging him and
[1:45:32] because you're conscious of his
[1:45:35] presence you're conscious of what he has
[1:45:37] done for you you're conscious of the
[1:45:39] fact that you were supposed to be
[1:45:42] dead but he said kill me
[1:45:45] instead to give you a chance to live let
[1:45:48] me take your place so you could take
[1:45:50] take my place and you can't acknowledge
[1:45:53] Him in all your
[1:45:55] ways I'm trying to close out can I but a
[1:45:59] punch I make a little progress I'm on
[1:46:03] 28 so this David I was just trying to
[1:46:06] make a point that's why I said David and
[1:46:07] see the Psalms and meditating and young
[1:46:10] people Proverbs there are 31 chapters in
[1:46:14] Proverbs as a young
[1:46:16] man I try to do one a
[1:46:19] day
[1:46:23] it'll preserve
[1:46:24] you it will guide you it'll give you
[1:46:28] wisdom so God told David through the
[1:46:30] prophet Nathan in 2 Samuel 7 and verse2
[1:46:33] when thy days be fulfilled and thou
[1:46:36] shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set
[1:46:39] up thy seed after thee which shall
[1:46:41] proceed out of thy bowels and I will
[1:46:43] establish his
[1:46:45] kingdom he shall build an house for my
[1:46:47] name and I will establish the Throne of
[1:46:50] his kingdom om forever I will be his
[1:46:52] father and he shall be my son if he
[1:46:55] commit iniquity I will chasen him with
[1:46:57] the rod of men and with the stripes of
[1:46:59] the children of men but my Mercy shall
[1:47:01] not depart away from him as I took it
[1:47:05] from Saul you you hear this I will
[1:47:09] chasen him but I will not take away
[1:47:13] Mercy because God will never stop
[1:47:15] correcting us am I want you to catch
[1:47:18] this lesson he will correct us he will
[1:47:20] chasten you he will tell you do in
[1:47:22] foolishness and you need to straighten
[1:47:23] up but he will extend
[1:47:27] Mercy but he said I took it from
[1:47:30] Saul in other words I cut Saul off from
[1:47:36] Mercy Lord help us tonight let me never
[1:47:39] be cut off from the mercy of
[1:47:44] God because Saul went too far and God
[1:47:48] cut him off there is such a Place Church
[1:47:51] as going too far but brandham talk about
[1:47:54] young people coming to the
[1:47:56] Altar and praying and God not even
[1:48:00] looking at them because they cross the
[1:48:04] line so if you're here tonight and
[1:48:07] you're one foot in the world and one
[1:48:09] foot in church I will say to you like
[1:48:12] Elijah why halt you between two
[1:48:16] opinions why you keep moving between
[1:48:19] church and the and because you know this
[1:48:21] is
[1:48:23] right I don't think anybody here
[1:48:29] mental so if you're here because you
[1:48:31] have enough sense to know that this
[1:48:33] thing is something that you need to
[1:48:34] investigate and understand to change
[1:48:36] your
[1:48:37] life but you have to want this more than
[1:48:40] you want the world you have to want this
[1:48:43] more than you want the Styles and the
[1:48:44] fashion and the music and the boy and
[1:48:47] the girl and whatever else there is out
[1:48:49] there
[1:48:51] am I'm trying to close out could you
[1:48:53] take some
[1:48:56] more so God through his Prophet Nathan
[1:49:00] established that through David his
[1:49:02] throne will be established forever so on
[1:49:05] the foundation of being of the tribe of
[1:49:07] Judah and the promise of the scepter
[1:49:09] always being in the tribe of Judah Here
[1:49:12] Comes David with a promise that his
[1:49:14] throne will be established forever can
[1:49:16] the church say amen amen in so much that
[1:49:20] by the time Jesus come to the Earth by
[1:49:23] the time reach Matthew 12:23 the Bible
[1:49:25] said and the people were amazed and said
[1:49:27] is this is is not this the son of David
[1:49:31] because jesus' Behavior was lining up
[1:49:33] with certain prophecies and certain
[1:49:35] things about his life he couldn't help
[1:49:36] himself can the church say
[1:49:39] Amen I'm trying to find a place to close
[1:49:41] up but I want to just bring this talk to
[1:49:42] you friends and originally I told
[1:49:45] Brother my title was going to be the
[1:49:47] city of David the son of David the key
[1:49:49] of David the Throne of David and and the
[1:49:51] David's Ministry and brother say that
[1:49:53] kind of
[1:49:58] long because I was trying to tie that
[1:50:00] the time to Christmas but the Lord had a
[1:50:03] plan and those messeng the all who came
[1:50:05] in perfectly to address not just needs
[1:50:07] in his church but needs here in the
[1:50:08] church as well but it was in my heart
[1:50:10] because it was Christmas message that
[1:50:13] Jesus born in Bethlehem the city of his
[1:50:16] which is also the city of where David
[1:50:17] was born in Bethlehem and the rulership
[1:50:19] was the city of M which also called the
[1:50:21] city of David so from the city of David
[1:50:24] to the throne of David because there's a
[1:50:26] prophecy that the son of David the son
[1:50:28] of David will sit on the throne of David
[1:50:32] amen so there more significant when
[1:50:35] Jesus came and says the a greater than
[1:50:37] Solomon is here because the son that's
[1:50:39] being spoken wasn't the lineage wasn't
[1:50:42] Solomon you talking
[1:50:44] about so it was more than talking about
[1:50:47] the wisdom of Solomon when he say the
[1:50:48] greater than Solomon is here because
[1:50:50] Solomon was the greatest King in terms
[1:50:52] of wisdom and wealth and it was the the
[1:50:53] peak after that is when the kingdom
[1:50:55] split into the northern kingdom and and
[1:50:58] Jud and Judah so the peak of David's
[1:51:01] kingdom was really under Solomon so when
[1:51:04] Jesus comes say greater than Solomon is
[1:51:06] here he was really saying the rightful
[1:51:08] heir to the promised son of David he he
[1:51:12] now reach can the church say
[1:51:15] amen and to see how powerful this is
[1:51:18] because we read the scripture in the
[1:51:19] Book of Revelation
[1:51:21] to him that overcome will sit with me in
[1:51:23] my throne even as I am in my father's
[1:51:26] Throne Jesus talking about now two
[1:51:28] Thrones The Father's Throne or the
[1:51:31] Heavenly throne and his throne which is
[1:51:33] the Throne of David So to him that
[1:51:36] overcometh who is he talking
[1:51:40] about will sit with me in my Throne
[1:51:43] because right now that Throne of David
[1:51:45] is still empty because Jesus is in the
[1:51:48] Heavenly Throne he's in his father's
[1:51:49] throne
[1:51:50] waiting for the bride to get into
[1:51:53] position David's Ministry on the scene
[1:51:56] to usher in the great Millennium oh come
[1:51:58] on now after the battle is over we shall
[1:52:01] wear a
[1:52:02] crown anybody with
[1:52:06] me but to sit on the throne of
[1:52:09] David you have to be your Overcomer and
[1:52:13] being an overcomer you are now grafted
[1:52:14] into the lineage of David part of the
[1:52:17] tribe of Judah a king priest come on now
[1:52:20] somebody help me I'm trying to find a
[1:52:22] place and that's the key to you saying
[1:52:24] we shall re on
[1:52:28] [Applause]
[1:52:29] [Music]
[1:52:32] the I'm trying to find a way to close
[1:52:34] the musici get get ready we we almost we
[1:52:36] almost
[1:52:38] done I want to quickly touch now the
[1:52:41] book of Isaiah is a powerful
[1:52:43] book Isaiah 1:1 says the vision of
[1:52:46] Isaiah the son of Amos which he saw
[1:52:50] concerning Judah and Jerusalem in other
[1:52:53] words the people and the
[1:52:55] place in the days of Uzziah jotham ahaz
[1:52:59] and Hezekiah Kings of Judah so I want
[1:53:01] you to understand Isaiah was prophet for
[1:53:03] four generations you
[1:53:05] know Hallelujah he watched Uzziah his
[1:53:09] son jotam his grandson ahaz and his
[1:53:12] great grandson
[1:53:15] Hezekiah and through 66 books of Isaiah
[1:53:19] which parallels to 66 chapters the 68
[1:53:23] books of the Bible Isaiah sits there as
[1:53:25] a spiritual pillar in scripture Behold a
[1:53:29] virgin shall conceive and speaking a lot
[1:53:32] of prophetic things so here in Isaiah
[1:53:35] 22:5 very quickly are you with
[1:53:39] me thus sayth the Lord God of hosts go
[1:53:42] get thee unto this Treasurer even shebna
[1:53:47] which is over the house and ask him what
[1:53:50] hast thou here and whom hast thou here
[1:53:53] that thou Hast hewed thee out a seula
[1:53:56] here as he that heed out a seula on high
[1:54:00] and that gravet and habitation for
[1:54:03] himself in a rock in other words what
[1:54:04] you
[1:54:07] doing in a way you shouldn't be doing it
[1:54:11] building things you shouldn't be
[1:54:12] building doing things you shouldn't be
[1:54:15] doing to try to protect yourself to try
[1:54:18] to preserve your legacy to try to
[1:54:20] preserve your future to try to secure
[1:54:23] your
[1:54:24] family anybody with me behold the Lord
[1:54:28] will carry thee away with a mighty
[1:54:30] captivity and will surely cover thee he
[1:54:33] will surely violently turn and Tossy
[1:54:36] like a ball into a large
[1:54:38] country there shall thou die so you say
[1:54:41] you're building a nice f a nice grave
[1:54:44] and the grave you're building for
[1:54:45] yourself you not going to go into that
[1:54:48] grave amen
[1:54:50] and some of us trying to set up our
[1:54:51] future and our Legacy and what we want
[1:54:53] to achieve and what we want to do and
[1:54:55] and that what I want to have and when I
[1:54:56] gone this is what need to
[1:54:58] happen anybody with me anybody in the
[1:55:00] house and God say all that planning and
[1:55:03] preparation and things you're doing is
[1:55:05] out of
[1:55:07] order he shall violently turn and TOS
[1:55:10] you like a ball into a large country
[1:55:12] there shall thou die and there the
[1:55:14] Chariot of thy Glory shall be the shame
[1:55:16] of thy Lord's House I will drive thee
[1:55:19] from th station be careful Church don't
[1:55:22] be in a station station means place
[1:55:24] don't be in a place it shouldn't be and
[1:55:26] from thy stage shall he pull thee
[1:55:29] down in other words he was elevating
[1:55:31] himself to a place that's like brother
[1:55:33] pre doing God a service without being
[1:55:34] his will you doing things it shouldn't
[1:55:37] be doing this is a warning to us and it
[1:55:40] shall come to pass in that day that I
[1:55:41] will call my servant Eliah Kim the son
[1:55:44] of hilia and I will clothe him with thy
[1:55:47] robe and strengthen him with thy girdle
[1:55:50] change of garment change of office and I
[1:55:52] will commit thy government into his hand
[1:55:54] and he shall be your father to the
[1:55:56] inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the
[1:55:58] house of Judah amen and the key of the
[1:56:01] House of David will I lay upon his
[1:56:04] shoulder and that's he only reference to
[1:56:06] the Key of David now when you read this
[1:56:08] you can read it in the context of Isaiah
[1:56:09] speaking to somebody but when you look
[1:56:10] at it again you see it's really Christ
[1:56:12] he talking about anybody with me can the
[1:56:15] church say Amen now we getting ready to
[1:56:17] close out in the Church ages
[1:56:20] Philadelphia Church age brother bam said
[1:56:22] he that had the Key of David this
[1:56:24] beautiful phrase follows and comes out
[1:56:25] of the preceding phrase we read it he
[1:56:27] that is true Christ the perfect
[1:56:30] realization contrasted with the partial
[1:56:33] realization here it is Moses was a
[1:56:36] prophet of God but Jesus was the prophet
[1:56:38] of God David a man after God's Own Heart
[1:56:41] was king of Israel but Jesus is the
[1:56:44] greater David king of kings and Lord of
[1:56:46] lords God very God now David was born
[1:56:49] born of the tribe of Judah out of whom
[1:56:51] no priest came yet he ate of the shoe
[1:56:54] bread reserved for priest in other words
[1:56:57] but trying to build a foundation now he
[1:56:58] said he was the great warrior overcoming
[1:57:01] the enemy establishing the people as
[1:57:03] king he sat on the throne he was a
[1:57:06] prophet he was a wonderful type of
[1:57:08] Christ now it says in Isaiah 22:22 and
[1:57:10] the key of the House of David will I lay
[1:57:13] upon his shoulder so he shall open and
[1:57:16] None Shall shut and he shall shut and
[1:57:18] None Shall open
[1:57:19] the spirit uses this Old Testament
[1:57:22] reference concerning the Lord Jesus
[1:57:25] Christ and his ministry in the church
[1:57:28] what the Key of David signified at that
[1:57:31] time listen carefully is a mere Shadow
[1:57:35] which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing
[1:57:37] in the midst of the lampstands it has to
[1:57:40] do with our Lord after his
[1:57:43] resurrection and not his Earthly
[1:57:45] pilgrimage but what does the key signify
[1:57:48] the answer lies in the position of the
[1:57:51] key it is not in his hand it is not worn
[1:57:54] around his neck it is not placed in the
[1:57:57] hands of other men or the verse could
[1:57:59] not be saying that he alone has the use
[1:58:02] of the key for he alone the Bible said
[1:58:05] opens and shuts and no man has that
[1:58:07] right but Jesus himself isn't that right
[1:58:10] but where is the key it is on his
[1:58:12] shoulder but what does shoulder have to
[1:58:14] do with it read Isaiah 9:6 and the
[1:58:17] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:58:19] but what does it mean and this is your
[1:58:21] promise I'm getting to you the answer is
[1:58:22] this the phrase government upon his
[1:58:24] shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony
[1:58:27] of the
[1:58:28] East we talking about brighting now we
[1:58:30] in brighting now when the bride has been
[1:58:33] committed to the groom she takes off her
[1:58:35] veil and places it over the groom's
[1:58:38] shoulders signifying that not only is
[1:58:41] she under his Dominion but she has
[1:58:44] transferred her rights to him that he is
[1:58:46] the head and also that he bearss the
[1:58:49] responsibility and the care and that he
[1:58:52] and he alone no one else no other man no
[1:58:56] other power has any right and
[1:58:59] responsibility and that beloved is the
[1:59:02] Key of David God being Sovereign he
[1:59:05] forew by Divine decree exactly who would
[1:59:09] be in his prde he chose her she did not
[1:59:13] choose him he called
[1:59:17] her so God
[1:59:20] the one who could open and the one who
[1:59:21] could shut he opened for you to be in
[1:59:24] the pride oh come on now Hallelujah and
[1:59:29] you didn't choose him but he chose
[1:59:32] you and we are trans have you
[1:59:34] transferred your
[1:59:36] rights have you transferred your rights
[1:59:39] to him is he your lord is he your king
[1:59:42] is he your leader is he your
[1:59:46] master I'm closing I'm done
[1:59:50] can the church say Amen give him praise
[1:59:52] last quote the Key of David was not
[1:59:55] David the king of Israel all
[2:00:00] Israel and is not Jesus the son of David
[2:00:02] according to the fact that he will sit
[2:00:04] upon the throne of David in the
[2:00:06] Millennium and Reign and rule over his
[2:00:09] Heritage surely so the Key of David
[2:00:12] signifies that it is Jesus who will
[2:00:14] bring in the Millennium he who has the
[2:00:16] keys to death and hell will raise up his
[2:00:19] own that they may share in his reign of
[2:00:22] righteousness upon the Earth we shall
[2:00:24] reign on the earth how wonderful that
[2:00:27] our Lord has all the answers friends I
[2:00:30] have no answers but our Lord has all the
[2:00:33] answers I'm done give him praise truly
[2:00:35] in him are all the promises of God
[2:00:38] fulfilled truly by being in him we are
[2:00:41] AES to what he has pushes us
[2:00:45] for
[2:00:46] oh Hallelujah
[2:00:50] Hallelujah and the government shall be
[2:00:53] upon his shoulder and his name Shall be
[2:00:55] Called wonderful Cel the Mighty God the
[2:00:59] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[2:01:02] in him is perfect fulfillment oh
[2:01:05] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:01:08] [Music]
[2:01:11] [Applause]
