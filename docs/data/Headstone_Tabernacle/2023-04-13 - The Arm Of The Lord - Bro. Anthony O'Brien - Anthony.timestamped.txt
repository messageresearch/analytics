[23:37] Deuteronomy 26 and verse 7 to 9.
[23:40] specifically
[23:43] we want to read from
[23:48] and look on our affliction
[23:51] and our labor
[23:53] and our oppression
[23:55] and the Lord brought us forth out of
[23:58] Egypt
[23:59] with a mighty hand
[24:01] and when an outstretched arm this place
[24:05] and had given us this land
[24:08] even a land that floweth with milk and
[24:12] honey
[24:13] and turning over now to Isaiah 53
[24:16] we want to read the first five verses
[24:18] there
[24:20] amen
[24:22] praise the Lord
[24:26] Isaiah 53 and verse 1.
[24:29] says who hath believed our report
[24:32] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[24:34] revealed
[24:36] for he shall grow up before him as a
[24:38] tender plant
[24:39] and as a root out of a dry ground
[24:42] he hath no form nor comeliness
[24:46] and when we shall see him there is no
[24:48] beauty that we should desire him
[24:50] he is the spies and rejected of man A
[24:54] Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief
[24:56] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[25:00] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[25:04] surely he hath borne on griefs and
[25:08] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[25:12] him stricken smitten of God and
[25:16] afflicted
[25:17] but he was wounded for our
[25:19] transgressions he was bruised for our
[25:22] iniquities the chastisement of all peace
[25:26] was upon him
[25:28] and with his stripes we are healed may
[25:31] God add blessing to the reading of his
[25:33] word let's bow our hands as we pray one

[27:17] the house of the lawn
[27:18] when we come into his house we are glad
[27:22] David said I was glad when they said
[27:23] unto me let us go into the house of the
[27:26] Lord
[27:27] amen and amen and amen praise God so we
[27:30] had to praise him we had to worship him
[27:32] tonight
[27:33] I have a title tonight the arm of the
[27:35] Lord amen that's my title tonight the
[27:39] arm of the Lord
[27:41] and uh
[27:43] I actually had this inspiration quite a
[27:46] long time
[27:47] but then when uh brotherhood last
[27:50] Wednesday I think he read the same
[27:52] scripture Isaiah 53
[27:55] and so uh when he struck it I said well
[27:58] we're on to something now amen so praise
[28:01] God and then last week with such an
[28:03] anointed week
[28:04] felt the presence of God in a special
[28:06] way
[28:07] in my own life remember the Terence
[28:09] praise God we know that uh God is here
[28:12] Among Us
[28:13] he's speaking to us and if we eat at an
[28:16] air let him hear what the spirit of God
[28:19] is saying to us we want to be in such a
[28:22] way that God could speak to us that God
[28:25] could tap us on the shoulder God is
[28:28] looking for such men and women tonight
[28:30] upon the face of the Earth that he could
[28:33] rest his hand on and say here is my
[28:36] spirit flowing freely he wants to be
[28:38] able to touch somebody in order to
[28:40] perform a work to perform an action to
[28:44] perform an activity there's things that
[28:46] God wants to do tonight but he's looking
[28:49] for Willing hearts willing Souls willing
[28:53] lives isn't that right William Marion
[28:56] Branham was such a life William Marion
[29:00] Branham was such a prophet that God
[29:03] could put his hand on and say come here
[29:05] I want you to Walk This Way don't ask
[29:09] any questions just come follow me and
[29:12] miracles would follow and power would
[29:15] follow and healing would follow because
[29:18] here is a man who is under the influence
[29:21] of the Holy Spirit and that is what we
[29:24] need tonight men and women who are under
[29:27] the influence of the holy spirit that
[29:30] God could move in such a way upon your
[29:34] life that you could be a blessing to
[29:37] somebody that you could be a help to
[29:39] somebody the gift is not for you it's
[29:42] for somebody else you were meant to
[29:45] reach somebody else to encourage
[29:48] somebody else to bless somebody else to
[29:52] heal somebody God wants to use somebody
[29:55] tonight may that be you my Christian
[29:58] brother may that be you my Christian
[30:00] friend let whom that is greatest among
[30:03] you
[30:04] let him be your servant
[30:08] can you say man God is looking for
[30:11] servants tonight amen to become Servants
[30:14] of the Lord
[30:15] in order to do that he has to break us
[30:18] he has to mold us he has to shape us he
[30:22] has to take us aside oh hallelujah
[30:25] hallelujah he has to pull us aside from
[30:27] all the distractions praise God and when
[30:30] I think about that I think about Moses
[30:32] because here was Moses a man of God
[30:35] called of God of course the call of God
[30:38] is upon his life
[30:40] it sound wonderful to be chosen but God
[30:44] allow rejection God allow us a certain
[30:48] level of scrutiny to come into His Life
[30:50] by the killing of the Egyptian isn't
[30:52] that right he fled Egypt and went out
[30:54] into the Wilderness he should have died
[30:57] when they were killing all of the
[30:59] firstborn males oh Hallelujah isn't that
[31:02] right oh hallelujah it's not right he
[31:04] was the only one of his generation that
[31:07] survived he was the only one of his age
[31:09] that survived oh hallelujah praise God
[31:13] is not right hallelujah hallelujah
[31:16] and God call him out many died and were
[31:19] killed and so forth like that isn't that
[31:20] right he's one of the very to go into
[31:22] something he had to be stripped he had
[31:25] to be beaten he had to be changed he had
[31:28] to be chastised he had to be brought
[31:30] into a certain uh order praise God had
[31:33] to break him subject to his own word and
[31:36] that's what we need tonight
[31:38] praise God hallelujah it's wonderful to
[31:41] say I'm chosen I'm a Child of God but in
[31:44] order for you to get into that adoption
[31:46] in order to get into that for his
[31:49] purpose and for his kingdom and for his
[31:53] glory in order for you to come into that
[31:55] state God has to take charge will
[31:58] subject you to his word subject you to
[32:01] what he once done what he once said even
[32:05] Jesus said
[32:07] Hallelujah
[32:09] the arm of the Lord so we serve our
[32:12] Supernatural God isn't that right
[32:14] God is a supernatural being
[32:18] you believe that tonight
[32:19] and because he is Supernatural it really
[32:22] exists outside of it isn't that right
[32:25] he's both within and without it isn't
[32:29] that right therefore it means so chooses
[32:33] he can step in and tonight it means that
[32:36] God could step into your circumstance
[32:39] tonight and some things that you were
[32:42] praying about maybe something that's
[32:44] upon your heart he can begin to perform
[32:48] Miracles because he exists outside of
[32:51] the natural he is Supernatural and
[32:55] anytime call a manifestation of the arm
[32:58] of the Lord coming into your life it's
[33:02] his hand his hand of predestination his
[33:06] hands are blessing his hands of guidance
[33:09] Earth is my footstool what how shall you
[33:13] build for me but God wants to dwell with
[33:17] you tonight and if he needs me to nudge
[33:20] he write down into your world
[33:35] abideth forever whatever his word says
[33:39] is forever and forever therefore if you
[33:41] answer and pull down the Eternal Word

[39:22] things to come into our lives that is
[39:24] the only way God could answer oh and if
