[12:03] Bernardet sending this request. Let's

[12:07] you for guiding us together tonight,
[12:10] giving us this opportunity to approach
[12:12] your throne in grace and to hear a word
[12:13] from you. And we pray that you'll come
[12:15] in a special way and minister to us and
[12:18] meet our every need. Lord, we bring Lord
[12:22] Marlene Muhammad before you with his

[12:29] Father Ni get a soul salvation and
[12:31] experience with you in your presence
[12:34] like a flash of light. Lord, people just
[12:37] move off the earth. Oh God, that flash
[12:39] is birth and death. 70 years is just
[12:42] like a flash. Oh God, help us tonight as
[12:44] we count our days and number our days
[12:46] that we could prepare our hearts and
[12:48] meet you. For we surely will meet you.
[12:50] Bless again the words that be shared
[12:53] tonight. Take me out of the way and be
[12:55] magnified in our midst and deal with the

[13:02] God bless you. Thanks again for being
[13:03] here. We always consider it a privilege
[13:06] to meet and if you could in a position
[13:07] to put on your your um your mirror, your
[13:11] screen, we appreciate it. see smiles
[13:13] tonight. So that is very very good.
[13:15] Okay. So there's something on my heart
[13:17] I'd like to share with you tonight. And
[13:20] um you want to turn our Bibles to 1
[13:22] Corinthians 5. We want to read verse 6
[13:26] and 8 6 to 8. And Paul was speaking to
[13:30] some condition in the church and he's
[13:33] saying in verse 6 of 1 Corinthians
[13:35] chapter 5:6
[13:37] your gloring is not good. Know ye not
[13:40] that a little leaven leavenveneth the
[13:43] whole lump?
[13:44] Purge out therefore the old leaven that
[13:47] he may be a new lump as ye are
[13:50] unleavened.
[13:52] For even Christ our passover is
[13:55] sacrificed for us. Therefore,
[13:59] let us keep the feast, not with leaven,
[14:04] neither with the leaven of malice and
[14:05] wickedness, but with the unleaven bread
[14:10] of sincerity and truth.
[14:15] This feast is a fasting.
[14:18] This verse eight here, I read it again.
[14:20] Therefore, let us keep the feast or the
[14:22] fast, not with old leaven,
[14:26] neither with the leaven of malice and
[14:28] wickedness, but the unleaven bread of
[14:32] sincerity and truth. So, I have a title
[14:36] tonight, the unleaven bread of sincerity
[14:41] and truth.
[14:43] Purge out therefore the old leaven is
[14:45] that that first one and the second one
[14:46] is purge the out there for the old
[14:49] leaven and Paul here is lightning malice
[14:55] and wickedness as living something that
[14:58] would make that lump of your life raise
[15:03] like a bread okay so let's go malice
[15:09] the word malice is a desire to harm
[15:11] someone. Malice is ill will. Malice is
[15:16] vicious intentions.
[15:18] It is one of the destructive fruit of
[15:21] the sinful human nature. Malice, a
[15:24] desire to harm someone or
[15:28] the feeling of pleasure
[15:31] at someone's misfortune.
[15:33] Like somebody said, "Good for him. Good,
[15:35] good, it happened." Malice is often the
[15:39] cause of false accusations.
[15:42] Malice is connected to corrupt inner
[15:45] motive and evil intent of the heart.
[15:50] You cannot have malice by accident.
[15:53] Malice by its nature is intentional.
[15:57] It's intentional. It's an intentional
[15:59] act to hurt others or get pleasure from
[16:03] the misfortune of others. Malice is
[16:06] likened unto yeast which raises the
[16:09] whole lump of dough. And that is why
[16:11] Paul said, "Purge out therefore the old
[16:14] leaven." In other words, get the leaven
[16:17] out of your system. Get the malice out.
[16:20] Get whatever it is. Then he used the
[16:23] word wickedness.
[16:25] and wickedness. The state of being
[16:27] wicked. A mental disregard for justice,
[16:29] righteousness, truth, honor, virtue,
[16:32] evil in thought and life, depravity,
[16:36] sinfulness, criminality.
[16:39] This is Proverbs 15:8.
[16:42] The sacrifice of the wicked is an
[16:45] abomination to the Lord, but the prayer
[16:48] of the upright is his delight.
[16:51] The way of the wicked is an abomination
[16:54] unto the Lord, but he loveth him that
[16:57] followeth after righteousness.
[17:00] Correction is grievous unto him that
[17:02] forsaketh the way, and he that hateth
[17:05] reproof shall die. Now, this malice and
[17:10] this wickedness that Paul was speaking
[17:12] about here, he wasn't talking to
[17:14] unbelievers. He wasn't talking to people
[17:17] outside the church. He was talking to
[17:18] church folks.
[17:20] And he is saying we need to get rid of
[17:23] all this stuff and replace it with or
[17:28] have the unleaven bread of sincerity and
[17:32] truth. Now sincere
[17:35] sincere means free from pretense or
[17:38] deceit
[17:39] proceeding from genuine feelings honest
[17:43] pure true. So the definition of sincere
[17:48] being in reality
[17:50] to be you know sometimes you hear me
[17:53] sometimes at funeral I say it was a
[17:54] story of a of people went to a funeral
[17:57] and and when they started to talk about
[17:58] the person in the box in the coffin
[18:00] somebody get have to look to see if
[18:02] they're in the right church because what
[18:04] they're saying about that person in that
[18:05] box and what they know the person to be
[18:08] is not the same thing. So being sincere
[18:11] is having the character which correspond
[18:14] with the appearance. So in other words,
[18:16] you line up with your testimony. You
[18:18] line up with what come out your mouth.
[18:20] Sincerity, the absence of pretense,
[18:24] deceit, hypocrisy,
[18:27] genuiness, truthfulness.
[18:30] Sincerity is the virtue of one who
[18:32] communicates and acts in accordance with
[18:35] the entirety of their feelings, belief,
[18:39] thoughts,
[18:40] desires in a manner that is honest
[18:44] and genuine.
[18:46] That is being sincere. Now the scripture
[18:49] we read speak about
[18:52] the unleaven bread of sincerity and
[18:56] truth.
[18:57] Now I wrote this here. Before you can be
[19:00] sincere,
[19:02] you have to come to the knowledge of the
[19:05] truth of what you are.
[19:08] You can't be sincere
[19:11] when you don't know you. When you are
[19:14] acting, when you are putting on a show
[19:17] or image. I remember years ago
[19:21] the Lord was speaking to my heart
[19:22] certain things and one of the things
[19:26] Lord dealt with me is considering
[19:28] impersonating or copying others and I
[19:31] saw it this way that if you are
[19:33] impersonating let's say I'm
[19:35] impersonating brother Clarence and I say
[19:39] Lord kill me then who is going to kill
[19:42] the Clarence I'm impersonating or me now
[19:45] if I am in Clarence B or operation or
[19:49] way or mannerism and I say Lord I want
[19:52] to die kill me Lord kill me which which
[19:54] God say which one you acting like
[19:56] Clarence yes they know who you are yet
[19:59] so to die you have to come to you
[20:05] this is very very important because this
[20:08] is where Jacob
[20:11] got to a place where he was alone
[20:14] and he could see himself
[20:17] and he could see the truth about
[20:19] himself. Now, when Jacob was ripping off
[20:22] his family, ripping off his
[20:23] father-in-law, ripping off anybody could
[20:26] rip off, he ripping off. He is a ripoff
[20:27] artist.
[20:29] In his mind, he is seeing himself as
[20:32] successful.
[20:34] In his mind, he is seeing himself as
[20:37] winning.
[20:39] He is seeing himself as achieving. And
[20:41] from a natural standpoint, when you look
[20:43] at Jacob, he is successful. His fox has
[20:46] grown, you know, spreading wide. I mean,
[20:50] the man is living large,
[20:53] but
[20:55] his fears of meeting his brother give
[20:58] him away as a defeated man, as a weak
[21:02] man, as a man despite his stature in
[21:06] life, despite the office that he held,
[21:11] he was weak and he knew it. And God got
[21:16] Jacob to a point where Jacob could see
[21:19] himself. And this is what I should say.
[21:22] Jacob could see himself. And
[21:26] the truth about himself and then he
[21:28] could confess. Who are you? I'm a
[21:30] trickster. I'm a deceiver.
[21:34] And then he can be sincere in wanting
[21:37] transformation. So you cannot really
[21:40] come to sincerity unless you come to
[21:41] truth. This is the same with the
[21:45] prodigal son. He was making style, have
[21:47] a fancy car, spend his money, buying the
[21:50] pizza and the works, having a lot of
[21:52] friends and so on. When misfortune hit
[21:54] him and he was pretending that
[21:57] everything was fine because he still had
[22:00] good clothes to display on the outside,
[22:03] but the pig food nobody was seeing him
[22:05] eating on the inside. But when the Bible
[22:07] said he came to himself,
[22:10] he came to the truth of where he was at
[22:13] and he recognized this is not right.
[22:15] This doesn't make sense. This is
[22:16] foolishness. I may as well be a servant
[22:18] in my father's house. And that is where
[22:22] something changed and something
[22:24] switched. So when Jacob came to the
[22:27] place where he could admit, I'm a
[22:31] trickster. I'm a deceit. He can be
[22:34] sincere. I will not let you go until you
[22:37] bless me. Until I'm transformed, and he
[22:40] was transformed. It will take God to
[22:42] reveal you.
[22:45] Making excuses. Listen carefully.
[22:48] Blaming others
[22:51] does not solve you
[22:53] or your problem. I want to repeat that
[22:56] again.
[22:58] Making excuses,
[23:00] blaming others does not solve you or
[23:04] your problem.
[23:06] You still have to see you in the
[23:11] So God brought them out of Egypt. God
[23:14] brought us out of the world. And he gave
[23:17] them this symbol of unleaven bread and
[23:22] no east, nothing added to it. And he
[23:25] tell them how he want them to eat it. So
[23:27] it's not a matter of what but how. And
[23:31] in all things of God there is always a
[23:34] fine print not just of what he wants but
[23:39] how he wants it done. Not what to do but
[23:43] how he wants it done. And I want to
[23:46] bring this part to a close here by
[23:48] saying this. This is David
[23:51] coming to his true self before God.
[23:54] He fell in sin. He fell with this woman
[23:57] Bashiba.
[23:59] No excuses,
[24:01] no blaming others, no sidehows,
[24:05] no deflections or deceitful
[24:06] disinformation. Just the truth from the
[24:09] inward parts from his heart. He had
[24:11] sinned and he is now before God. He's
[24:14] not saying, "Well, you know, if Bashiba
[24:16] didn't go up there, I might not look."
[24:18] And none of that. So, this is David in
[24:21] Psalms 51.
[24:24] David starts off, "Have mercy upon me,
[24:26] oh God,
[24:28] according to thy loving kindness.
[24:30] According to the multitude of thy tender
[24:33] mercies, blot out my transgressions.
[24:37] Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and
[24:40] cleanse me from my sin." Note, David not
[24:43] pointing his fingers at anybody. He's
[24:45] not blaming. He's not accusing. He's not
[24:47] saying this, that, and no, he's not
[24:48] doing that. Verse three, for I
[24:51] acknowledge my transgressions, and my
[24:54] sin is ever before me. Against thee, and
[24:57] thee only have I sinned, and done this
[25:01] evil in thy sight, that thou mightest be
[25:04] justified when thou speakest, and be
[25:06] clear when thou judgest. Behold, I was
[25:08] shapen iniquity. That's truth. In sin
[25:11] did my mother conceive me. That is also
[25:13] truth. Behold, thou desire in the inward
[25:19] parts. So God, we could pretend and try
[25:23] to impress people with the words we say,
[25:25] but God is who sees a heart. And David
[25:27] is identifying it here in this way. Thou
[25:30] desires truth in the inward parts and in
[25:32] the hidden part. Thou shall make me to
[25:33] know wisdom. David continues, purge me
[25:36] with hissup and I shall be clean. Wash
[25:39] me and I shall be whiter than snow. Make
[25:42] me to hear joy and gladness that the
[25:45] bones which thou has broken may rejoice.
[25:48] Hide thy face from my sins and blot out
[25:50] all mine iniquities. Create in me and
[25:53] that's we sing that song so much. Create
[25:54] in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a
[25:57] right spirit within me. Cast me not
[25:59] away. Cast me not away from thy presence
[26:01] and take not thy holy spirit from me.
[26:03] Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[26:07] and uphold me with thy free spirit. Then
[26:10] will I teach transgressions thy ways. So
[26:14] David understood in that condition he
[26:16] can't teach anybody except he be purged
[26:19] except he be cleansed. Then I will teach
[26:22] transgression thy ways and sinners shall
[26:25] be converted unto thee. Deliver me from
[26:27] blood guiltiness. Oh God, thou God of my
[26:29] salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud
[26:32] of thy righteousness. Oh Lord, open thou
[26:34] my lips and my mouth shall show forth
[26:36] thy praise. For thou desire not
[26:38] sacrifice else I would give it. So this
[26:40] is David. It's very clear to him.
[26:45] Listen to these words. For if thou
[26:48] desire not for thou desire not sacrifice
[26:51] as I would give it. In other words, he
[26:52] is saying if there is something I could
[26:54] do to bring me out of this condition to
[26:58] make an atonement for this condition, I
[26:59] will do it. Then he said these words,
[27:01] thou delightest not in burnt offering.
[27:05] So the physical efforts and your body to
[27:07] be burned and and killing oxen and goats
[27:09] and everything else. He said you know
[27:11] that delight is not in burnt offering.
[27:13] And then he said these words the
[27:15] sacrifices of God a broken spirit a
[27:19] broken and contrite heart. Oh God I will
[27:22] not despise.
[27:24] So we see here David clearly came to
[27:28] himself. David clearly wasn't making
[27:31] excuses and David was deeply.
[27:35] Now God's truth
[27:37] is the means by which he get things
[27:40] done.
[27:42] We are to become a reflection of the
[27:46] truths we believe and practice. Not just
[27:50] belief but the practice.
[27:53] What we practice is what would make the
[27:56] difference. Now
[27:59] many things are not innate in us. Many
[28:01] things are not built into us. We have to
[28:03] acquire them. Like the Bible say, put on
[28:06] the new man. Throw off the old man. We
[28:09] have to acquire skills, talents. We have
[28:11] to acquire, if you're learning a foreign
[28:13] language, acquire language, acquire new
[28:15] skill, acquire new information, study,
[28:18] application, and so on. Practice,
[28:21] not just a belief. And Boran said this
[28:24] in oneness. Now keep those things in
[28:26] mind. The church, here we go, must
[28:29] believe every word, every promise, every
[28:33] iota and claim it for themselves.
[28:38] One, two, here continuation and exercise
[28:42] themselves in it. So when Jesus washed
[28:46] disciples feet, he say don't understand.
[28:48] I don't know what I'm doing. Let me do
[28:50] my do. He wash their feet. Then he begin
[28:52] to give them a testimony on that. He
[28:55] said, "I am your lord and master. Look
[28:57] what I'm doing. I want you to do that
[28:59] for one another." It's not that they are
[29:00] accustomed doing that for one another.
[29:02] He is setting an example for it to
[29:04] practice, for they to exercise.
[29:07] Okay? We get that. So the church must
[29:10] believe every word, every promise, every
[29:13] iota and claim it for themselves and
[29:15] exercise themselves in it. Psalms 81 11
[29:20] God speaks but my people would not
[29:22] hearken to my voice and Israel would
[29:25] none of me they don't want me. Yes. So I
[29:30] give them up unto their own hearts lust
[29:36] and they walked in their own councils.
[29:40] Oh, that my people had hearkened unto me
[29:44] and Israel had walked in my
[29:48] and this is where God set up a ministry.
[29:50] God set up a pastor to bring counsel, to
[29:54] bring advice. And if people don't want
[29:57] to hear the voice of God which will come
[29:59] through the ministry, if they don't want
[30:02] to hear that, God would leave them up to
[30:05] their own hearts these hours and you'd
[30:07] find yourself in trouble making poor
[30:10] decisions, wrong decisions, off decision
[30:12] and sometime when you make a bad turn.
[30:14] Sometime it take not just months but
[30:15] years to get back on track.
[30:18] United States have some some long
[30:20] highways and so on and when you miss a
[30:22] turn to go way way way down sometime it
[30:25] throw you off half an hour hour two
[30:27] hours a round turn so friends we have to
[30:32] have a desire to hear God's voice to
[30:36] take to ask questions to ask information
[30:41] to ask for prayer ask for guidance
[30:44] that's what this is about
[30:46] oh Matthew eating tree going good. I
[30:51] said verily I say unto you this is Jesus
[30:52] speak except you be converted
[30:55] and become as little children he shall
[30:59] not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[31:02] This is Jesus bringing a compar of how
[31:06] we are to become.
[31:08] Let's look at a child. A child is
[31:10] completely honest.
[31:12] A child is without guile.
[31:15] A child is completely trusting.
[31:18] A child is completely sincere.
[31:22] A child is completely open,
[31:25] completely dependent.
[31:28] And Jesus said this, except you become
[31:31] as little children, you shall not enter
[31:33] into the kingdom of heaven. What is
[31:36] guile? Gu is shrewdness,
[31:40] being skilled in deception.
[31:44] The synonym of guile is craft, cunning,
[31:48] foxiness, craftiness, gilliness,
[31:53] deceptive cunning. Guile goes beyond
[31:56] simply lying to include insidious
[32:00] cunning craftiness and the use of
[32:03] trickery to mislead others.
[32:06] Guile deals with lack of integrity
[32:10] is a contrast to righteousness and guile
[32:12] have negative consequences.
[32:17] Psalms 32:2 blessed is the man to whom
[32:20] the Lord imputes no guile and in whose
[32:23] spirit there is no guile. 1 Peter 3:10,
[32:26] for he that would love life and see good
[32:29] deeds, let him refrain his tongue from
[32:31] evil
[32:32] that they speak no guile.
[32:35] So we have to get closer
[32:37] to what we speak on our heart to be the
[32:40] same. In other words, you become deeply
[32:44] sincere. Now this has nothing to do with
[32:46] ministry or post or position. This have
[32:50] nothing to do with prophet, pastor,
[32:51] teacher, evangelist, apostle. The office
[32:54] doesn't change this because when God
[32:56] look at the prophet's heart, he says you
[32:58] have been given power but be more
[33:00] sincere. It meant that the Lord himself
[33:04] sees something that needs attention and
[33:08] the prophet went and had a time of
[33:09] fasting to deal with what God saw as of
[33:14] lack of sincerity.
[33:17] And in trying to do God as it was
[33:18] without it being God's will, he says how
[33:21] we thank you God. As we set in this
[33:23] solemn moment almost like a funeral for
[33:26] we are facing a burial of a dying dead
[33:29] world, a dying dead church. Father we
[33:34] completely Lord Jesus bless thy people.
[33:36] Father bring sincerity and deepness to
[33:41] the hearts of the people. May we get off
[33:43] those fragile bubble dancing. Settle
[33:46] down into the deep riches of the honey
[33:47] of God. Grant it, Lord. Keep our hearts
[33:50] established with love.
[33:56] Okay, we almost there. Matthew 16.
[34:03] Are you hearing me clear out there? Are
[34:05] you hearing me? Okay. See, there's some
[34:07] kind of internet issue here. All right.
[34:09] Matthew 16. And when his disciples were
[34:11] come to the other side, they had
[34:12] forgotten to take bread, which is
[34:15] physical bread, literal bread. And Jesus
[34:17] said unto them, "Take heed and beware of
[34:19] the leaven of the Pharisees and the
[34:21] Sadducees."
[34:23] And Jesus is very interested in how he
[34:25] presents,
[34:27] you know, the word to the people and the
[34:30] reason among themselves saying, "Is it
[34:32] because we have take no bread?"
[34:34] Which when Jesus perceived
[34:37] faith, why reason among yourself?
[34:39] because you have brought no bread. Do
[34:41] you not understand? Neither remember the
[34:43] five loaves of the 5,000. How many
[34:45] basket you took up? Neither the seven
[34:47] loaves or the 4,000 and how many baskets
[34:49] you took up. How is it that you do not
[34:51] understand that what I speak? It is not
[34:54] to you concerning bread that he should
[34:56] beware of the le of the Pharisees and
[34:58] Sadducees. Then they understood how he
[35:02] bid them not beware of the leaven of
[35:04] bread but of the doctrine of the
[35:07] Pharisees and the Sadducees. So doctrine
[35:11] could come as le doctrine could come and
[35:16] pump people up the wrong way. It could
[35:18] make people feel superior, greater than,
[35:20] more revelation than more spiritual than
[35:22] closer to Jesus than more bright than.
[35:25] That is doctrine doing that. All of that
[35:28] is that's how Jesus saw it. Beware of
[35:32] the living of the Pharisees. Are you
[35:35] with me?
[35:36] All right.
[35:38] So, we talk about malice,
[35:40] destructive
[35:42] nature, desire to harm someone or
[35:45] pleasure someone's misfortune. But this
[35:48] is where I'm going to wrap up here. You
[35:50] know this story we touch it many a times
[35:54] and baram talk about a vision he had and
[35:58] this vision was that of this black
[36:00] mambber everybody was afraid of it and
[36:05] there was such a danger in these days
[36:07] and this great heist thing was death
[36:08] when it strikes you and he said there's
[36:11] nothing as poisonous as a mambber and
[36:13] the snake of course represents sin and
[36:15] death so that what this is about okay
[36:18] now he said, "Uh, going to skip now."
[36:22] And he said, "Um,"
[36:24] and he was on the highway. I thought,
[36:25] "Well, this is it." So, I look at him
[36:28] talking about the mamba. He was looked
[36:29] at angry at me. He licked his tongue and
[36:31] here he come and he got right close to
[36:34] me. He would run off fast and then he
[36:36] would get slower and slower, just
[36:38] quiver, stop. Then something would hold
[36:41] him off. He couldn't bite me. So even
[36:44] though this was a dangerous snake, a
[36:45] deadly snake, it couldn't harm but a
[36:47] brown and he would turn around the other
[36:50] side, try to approach on the other side.
[36:51] He would get back, get a start, swish
[36:53] right slower.
[36:56] Then he would shake like that and move
[36:58] back. He couldn't strike me. Then he
[37:01] turned and looked at my friend
[37:05] and always he went after my friend and I
[37:09] seen my friend just jumping way in the
[37:11] air over him over him and and trying and
[37:14] just trying to strike him. I thought,
[37:16] "Oh, if it ever hits him, it'll be
[37:18] instant death. No wonder everybody is so
[37:20] scared because when this it is instant
[37:24] death and it was just striking at him
[37:26] like that and I threw up my hands I said
[37:28] oh God have mercy on my brother. If that
[37:31] serpent ever strikes him it will kill
[37:34] him. And just then the serpent turned to
[37:37] me when I said that and look at me again
[37:43] and a voice came from above and said,
[37:45] "You have been given power to bind him
[37:49] the worst."
[37:53] And I said, "Well, God, what must I do?"
[37:56] He said, "There is one thing you must
[37:58] do. You must be more sincere.
[38:01] You must be more sincere." I said, "God,
[38:05] forgive me for my insincerity.
[38:07] Let me have sincerity."
[38:10] And when I raised up my hands to him
[38:11] again, there was a great something came
[38:14] over me and lifted me up. Seemed like it
[38:17] my whole body was charged with
[38:20] something. And I looked at the serpent
[38:22] and he started towards me and he
[38:24] couldn't do it. And I said, "Satan, in
[38:26] the name of the Lord Jesus, I bind you."
[38:29] And a blue smoke flew out of him. He
[38:32] curled up and make like a sign like a S
[38:35] a S backward and and means bind this one
[38:39] or anything below him because he was the
[38:41] worst. Blue smoke fell out of him. His
[38:44] tail choke his own self to death around
[38:46] his head and he made this backward S
[38:48] like a sign like a hand sign and the
[38:51] brother was free and I went over and
[38:54] mashed on it. I said, "Now, I've got to
[38:55] find out about this because it's a and
[38:59] and and and then a voice came unto me
[39:02] also." I said, "Satan, that I might
[39:05] know, I unbind you." And when it did, he
[39:10] started coming to life again, wiggling,
[39:12] and then I said, "I bind you back in the
[39:13] name of Jesus Christ." And when it did,
[39:15] the smoke flow of him again, and he
[39:17] choked himself right back and turned
[39:19] into crystal. And then when he did that,
[39:22] that voice said, Now you must be more
[39:26] sincere than what you are to do this.
[39:31] Then it left me and I was standing in
[39:34] the room. Now this is a very very
[39:38] important lesson because the issue
[39:42] wasn't but a brown. The snake couldn't
[39:45] strike him. The snake couldn't bite him.
[39:48] The snake couldn't kill him. But it
[39:51] could kill his friend. I'll say it this
[39:53] way to you tonight. It could kill your
[39:55] wife.
[39:56] It could kill your husband. It could
[39:59] kill your children if you are protected.
[40:03] It could kill a loved one, someone close
[40:05] to you. So what I'm saying to you, we,
[40:09] not just you, we in this room here
[40:11] tonight is confronted with the unleaven
[40:15] bread of sincerity and truth
[40:17] to be more sincere because you want God
[40:21] to hear and answer your prayer. Not just
[40:23] for you, but for those around you. Maybe
[40:26] you are fine, maybe you are covered,
[40:29] maybe you are protected, maybe all is
[40:31] well around you. We are not talking
[40:33] about that.
[40:34] How are you going to feel if you know
[40:36] this mamba that cannot bite you or hurt
[40:39] you could hurt your family, your
[40:41] friends, your loved ones, someone close
[40:44] to you
[40:46] all because it's given into your hands
[40:49] to be more sincere that God could work
[40:52] through you because he said by and
[40:54] through the bride will be fulfilled all
[40:57] that was promised. I'm going to close.
[41:00] Oh, praise the Lord.
[41:03] Oh yeah. All right. What about now?
[41:08] Then it left me. I was standing in the
[41:09] room.
[41:11] So I slipped off into the den room. I
[41:14] got down on my knees. I said, "Lord
[41:16] Jesus, I don't know these things. What
[41:17] must I do?
[41:20] The children will be calling me to take
[41:21] them to school in a few moments." I look
[41:24] around.
[41:25] I said, "Lord, if you will forgive me, I
[41:27] do not believe in open up the scripture
[41:29] and taking something out of the Bible.
[41:31] But Lord, in case of emergency, he said,
[41:34] "Uh, the kids will be in an hour yet
[41:36] before they be gone. Could you show me?"
[41:39] I took the Bible and pulled it open like
[41:42] that. My thumb was laying at 1
[41:45] Corinthians the 5th chapter in the 8th
[41:47] verse. Hallelujah. Tonight, and it says,
[41:50] "When you come to this feast, which a
[41:53] fast is in the body is a feast with the
[41:56] Lord." We know that. So when you come to
[41:58] this feast, don't come with the old
[42:02] leaven or the leaven of malice and so
[42:05] forth, but come with the unleaven bread
[42:09] of sincerity and truth. Just exactly
[42:12] what he told me in the vision. God is my
[42:14] solemn judge. Come with the unleaven
[42:18] bread of sincerity and truth. And that
[42:22] is the word. Then I seen what he meant
[42:25] as he years ago when I see the Bible
[42:28] come down. God, it wrote here and a hand
[42:30] came from heaven and pointed down to
[42:32] Joshua and I read the first nine verses
[42:34] and Joshua come out of the wilderness
[42:36] and he said, "This day I will begin to
[42:38] magnify you among the people." So I went
[42:43] to the woods and prayed and prayed and
[42:48] fasted
[42:49] in studying church history.
[42:52] And yesterday I wound up with the
[42:53] complete life of St. Martin and in the
[42:56] very secret of his power was in humility
[42:58] before God. And we find today that the
[43:01] church yet teaching its power and
[43:03] teaching the signs to follow the
[43:05] believer. Yet we find them puffed up.
[43:06] Big me little you. It isn't like that
[43:09] early church. You see they were humble,
[43:12] kind to one another, sweet
[43:15] understanding. It was so much different
[43:18] today. And I wonder if a lot of this
[43:20] hasn't sidetracked us from the real
[43:24] kernel of the message that we want to
[43:27] humble ourselves. The more humbler you
[43:30] can be, the better God can use you. And
[43:35] I'm finished for tonight. Let us bow.
[43:39] Almighty God, I was doing some work
[43:42] outside and these words came to my
[43:45] heart. the unleaven bread of sincerity
[43:49] and truth.
[43:51] I pray God that it will mean something
[43:53] to your people tonight
[43:55] that is not fasting because the church
[43:57] is fasting fasting because the pastor
[44:00] called fasting fasting because this is
[44:01] what we do and like we just stay hungry
[44:04] or stay without anything but it's not so
[44:07] much the what but the how. How you want
[44:11] us to do it. I remember brother Brandon
[44:14] give a story of a husband and wife and
[44:16] they're custom kissing each other and
[44:19] they had a fussing and quarreling and
[44:21] they just do it from a traditional
[44:22] standpoint. When the husband had left
[44:25] the house going his way, his wife, you
[44:28] know, his wife wasn't in a nice mood.
[44:30] Something wasn't right. He turned back
[44:34] and when he kissed it a second time, it
[44:35] was different. It had feelings in it. It
[44:38] wasn't a performance for the neighbors
[44:39] to see. It was real. Oh God, help us to
[44:44] come down from floating on this
[44:46] religious
[44:48] seesaw or Mary go wrong and on the
[44:53] ground to be sincere in heart, to be
[44:58] truthful, to be honest, to be genuine,
[45:00] to be real, to be authentic, to be
[45:02] original. No put on, no makeup, no
[45:07] acting, no performance. just what we
[45:10] are.
[45:12] David said it so beautifully. Have mercy
[45:16] upon me, oh God.
[45:18] Unto thee have I sinned.
[45:22] But Isaac mentioned it about confession
[45:24] even in the last Bible studies that we
[45:26] had.
[45:28] It's not fairy tale. Lord, you didn't
[45:31] put a ministry among your people for
[45:34] idol or just to waste time or to be a
[45:36] front, but you speak, you put it there
[45:40] that truth could come, Lord, present in
[45:42] truth that will minister to the needs of
[45:44] the people. You know exactly what is in
[45:45] each heart here tonight. And you know
[45:48] why the Holy Spirit brought these words
[45:50] to your people. May their praying
[45:53] tonight be different.
[45:56] God, we can't even get to that spot yet
[45:59] to pray for our enemies. That's what you
[46:01] tell us to do. Pray for those who
[46:03] despitefully use you and and so on.
[46:06] And and you you said how we supposed to
[46:08] be among the the children of darkness,
[46:10] among this world, that we should be like
[46:12] lights, not like darkness ourselves, but
[46:15] we should be reflectors of light, the
[46:17] true light that light up every man that
[46:19] comes into this world. and you send this
[46:21] end time message that we could be like
[46:23] real lamps, like real lighthouses,
[46:26] shining in our homes, shining in our
[46:28] communities, shining wherever we go.
[46:30] Father, I pray tonight that you bless
[46:31] your people. May your grace come to
[46:33] them. May they realize that if you could
[46:35] tell a prophet that is protected, that
[46:38] is covered, that the mama cannot bite
[46:40] him, to be more sincere, and that
[46:42] sincerity is to apply to see his
[46:45] brothers delivered, to see his brothers
[46:48] protected, to see his brothers covered
[46:50] much more for us. Oh God, help us
[46:52] tonight to take charge of this
[46:55] responsibility that you place upon us as
[46:58] called the elected in this hour. God,
[47:01] many has listened to tapes. Many have
[47:04] read books and that's as far as it
[47:06] reach. What they hear, what they read,
[47:09] what they know and understand. There is
[47:11] no application, there is no practice,
[47:13] there's no effort. But Lord, you said
[47:17] faith without works is dead. You call us
[47:20] to apply it. You call us to claim. You
[47:23] call us to believe. You call us to seek
[47:26] after you, Father. Oh God. Lord, you
[47:29] said that people seek after me, but
[47:31] their heart is far from me.
[47:33] Don't let it be so tonight. But create
[47:36] in me a clean heart with spirit. Create
[47:39] in us a revival. Renew a right spirit. A
[47:42] right quality of spirit that you could
[47:44] say, "Wow, this is my people. They
[47:47] getting right back on track with
[47:49] sincerity and truth." And remember the
[47:50] prophet talking about people sending
[47:53] others to offer up lambs for them. No
[47:55] sincerity at all. They just know it as a
[47:58] tradition. Offer up a lamb, offer up
[47:59] this, offer up that. They're not even
[48:01] going themselves to lay hands to be
[48:03] identified with the death of that man.
[48:06] Here we are tonight, Lord, after 50
[48:09] something plus years of this end time
[48:11] message on this earth. Here we are going
[48:13] on to a crucial time, going down to the
[48:16] end of time, the time of the end. Oh
[48:19] God, the closing of the gentile
[48:21] dispensation. And here we are asking for
[48:23] a supernatural intervention in homes, in
[48:26] marriages, in lives, in finances, in
[48:28] every condition in the church. For the
[48:30] sickest body on the earth is the bride
[48:33] of Jesus Christ. That's what the prophet
[48:35] said. And the only thing to heal it is
[48:38] brotherly love. It's the spirit of
[48:39] forgiveness. There's a
[48:43] even have to go to the person. If they
[48:45] know somebody have something on them,
[48:46] they could go to them and talk to them.
[48:48] But if they have a they could just
[48:49] simply drop it, let it go and do like if
[48:51] it doesn't exist, it doesn't is have no
[48:54] way to go back to it, Lord. and they
[48:56] could free themselves to enter into a
[48:58] perfect fate where you could honor their
[49:00] fate. Father, forgive us as we forgive
[49:02] those who trespass against us, oh God,
[49:05] for that is the kingdom upon the glory.
[49:07] Oh God, give us this day truly our daily
[49:10] bread. Give us daily strength. Give us
[49:12] your daily mercy. Give us your daily
[49:14] grace. Bless the elders. Bless the
[49:16] officers. Bless the ministry, Father.
[49:18] Bless all the helps, Father. Pour out
[49:20] your love upon them. Deliver the
[49:22] backsliders and restore them. Send a
[49:24] revival. I said a charge into the church
[49:26] this coming Sunday. Father, may your
[49:28] power explode. May people, oh God, hit
[49:30] the altar. Father, may lives be
[49:32] transform and change. Oh God, may the
[49:34] witness of the spirit come down. May the
[49:36] pillar of fire come down like it came
[49:37] down on Mount Si. May it come upon your
[49:40] people and may there be such a
[49:41] transformational experience in the lives
[49:43] of your children, Father. Oh God, as we
[49:45] said, Jacob came to his own before he
[49:48] could be sincere to said, I will not let
[49:50] you go till you bless me. and to show
[49:52] how sincere he was. When the angel tried
[49:54] to leave, he said, "No, no, no, no, no.
[49:56] You can't go now. Not, no, no, no. I
[49:57] need a touch. I need something more. I
[50:00] need a inner change in my heart. I need
[50:02] a transformation." And when the angel
[50:05] was finished with him, he had a new
[50:07] walk. He had a new talk. Fear had left
[50:09] him. He was ready to face any situation,
[50:12] any time, any place, on any condition.
[50:14] He was fearless. He was anointed. He was
[50:16] inspired because he had a supernatural
[50:18] encounter. Oh God, tonight I pray for
[50:21] your people. I pray for even the young
[50:23] people, supernatural encounter. Father,
[50:25] arrange it. Set it up, Lord. An
[50:27] appointment with the supernatural. May
[50:29] you come and confirm your word tonight
[50:31] with signs, wonders, and miracles. May
[50:32] you come and confirm your word tonight
[50:34] with healing and deliverances. May you
[50:35] come and confirm your word tonight with
[50:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost being
[50:38] poured out right in the homes and lives
[50:40] of your children. Oh God, revive the
[50:42] Calebs tonight. Send fire into their
[50:44] faith. Send fire into their heart. Send
[50:46] fire into their lives. Send fire into
[50:48] the homes tonight. Oh God, send down
[50:50] that quickening power. Oh God, send a
[50:52] revival that will strike the headstone
[50:53] tabernacle. Oh God will be noised, Lord
[50:55] Jesus. The voice of rejoicing is in the
[50:57] tabernacle of the righteous. The Lord
[50:59] had chasened me so but he had not given
[51:01] me over unto death. Oh God grant it,
[51:04] Father. Oh granted. We see it, Lord. The
[51:06] rejected stone is become the headstone.
[51:08] Lord send down the dynamics to the
[51:10] mechanics. Send on the Holy Ghost among
[51:12] your people and empower them in faith to
[51:14] believe you for all things granted God
[51:17] in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen.
[51:19] Give the Lord some praises right where
[51:21] you are. Praise the Lord. We love him
[51:23] tonight. We thank God for his mercy. We
[51:26] thank God for his grace and we looking
[51:27] to see exactly what this the Lord will
[51:29] do among us tonight. So God bless you as
[51:31] we get on in prayer. God be with you.
[51:33] Praise the Lord.
