shake somebody's hands next to your mind [Music] all together [Music] you you may be seated i don't want to start yet that that i see you may be seated if i started i'd continue right oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord o glory to god these are scripture i read in cameroon do you think i get to read it here and david after battle and david came back home so david and his men came to the city and behold he was born with fire their wives their sons their daughters were taking captives then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voices and wept until they had no more power to read and david two wives were taken captives and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stone in him when you're having victory people love you too by them when you come back to a situation of disaster and defeat they want to stone the same david the mighty man of allah they want to stone him his own people because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself nobody with you but david encouraged himself in the lord his god you hear all that is worded david encourage himself in the lord his god oh who you're serving this morning who you're worshiping this morning jesus told a woman we know what we worship do you know who you're worshiping this morning david said to abita the priest amalek's son i pray bring me here the ephod brought to the effort to david and david inquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered pursue for those shall surely overtake them and without fear recover all hallelujah hallelujah did you hear that hallelujah he came and see everything crashed his family held captive by ashby and david sought the lord and god told him pursue go after them don't sit down and mope don't sit down and cry don't sit down and give up don't sit down and let go don't sit down and look like if you don't have no authority to do what you have to do but man got to do what man got to do oh glory to god and this is what this is all about this morning we going to do all what we got to do could we stand if you want to turn to the scriptures to james chapter two we want to read from verse 15 to 26 and one verse of saint john chapter 4 verse 34. thank you musicians thank you brother gideon for that inspiring worship this morning everything needs to be inspired the singing must be inspired the specials must be inspired the musicians must be inspired the choir must be inspired the people must be inspired and the preacher must be inspired and and when all that inspiration come together oh my god will be inspired reading james 2 reading from verse 15. if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be warmed and filled you speak in the word notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what does it profit even so fate if it had not works is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou has faith and i have worked show me thy faith without thy works and i will surely my faith by my works don't believe us that there is one god don't do us well the devil also believe and tremble but will thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead wasn't abraham or father justified by works when he had offered isaac and his son upon the altar seeing thou how faith wrote with his works and by works was faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which said abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called a friend of god he see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rehab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so fate without works is death also a reading from saint john chapter four excuse me i want to read from one verse verse 34. and this is jesus disciples just before they came and said master eat he said i have meat to eat that you know i love and then verse 34 jesus said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work let's pray father we thank you for your word interpret it to our hearts inspire the word to your people and may this be a life-changing service lord may no one leave it the same way they came but may the word be effective to them in their spirits in their heart and may the word become flesh i may confirm the word with signs wonders and miracles but the anointing is so powerful that when they leave here it will go in their cars it will go in their houses it will go on the job wherever they go it will go with them and give them tremendous victory in jesus might ask it amen and amen you will be seated go praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord i have a title my faith in god promises is expressed by my works my faith in god's promises is expressed by my works i have an inspiration doing all we can do now last week's the title was let us provoke one another to love and good works and we asked a question who is responsible for the bright seventh and the revival and i brought it to the part that you must play but there's a path that the ministers have to play and there's a part that god has to play so all together is what going to produce that bride's revival isn't that right and i have a thought i thought of god expect results and action is caused action don't just happen action is caused and today i want to introduce a new word which is like opposite to action that is caused and that new word is inertia i n e r t i e initial and we're going to find out a little bit in a while what that is now i just have this written here my commission this is me is to go into all the world and preach the gospel that is the instructions that jesus have given us so on the fields i know i'm in the will of god and but i say one once a minister is on the field he is in the will of god now i know i could stay in the newsroom and give comments on what is happening on the battlefront because that is what newsroom people do sometimes they have hurricane and earthquake and different things and somebody outside in a hurricane and they report into headquarters and the person in the studio did not get wet they are commenting on who is getting wet outside of the day and it's now we have a report from so and so on they could talk and sometimes have a big table and this one talking to this one and this one talking this one but they're not in a hurricane place they're not getting wet they're not feeling the breeze nothing in the storm they're just commenters or talkers or just uh that's all i'm saying i wasn't ordained to be in the newsroom praise god i wasn't ordained to be in the commentary box i was ordained to be a wrong morning edition along a table and people said on a couch and discuss what is happening no no no i am going to be on the battlefield for my lord hallelujah are you with me so therefore there are three kind of people those who are wondering what is happening those who are watching what is happening and do the commentators they're in the box they're watching what is happening and the last bunch is the part that i am in those who are causing things to happen now you've got to pick your you got to pick what you want to be identified with because everybody going to be identified one way or the other or give the lord some praises people hallelujah isn't that something so you ever always heard about a tax a task that was supposed to be done and everybody had a chance to do it anybody could have done it somebody thought anybody will do it but in the end nobody did it so everybody was looking for anybody and anybody thought somebody was going to do it so we don't want to be anybody and everybody and somebody knows somebody going to do the task because jesus said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish the work god will just have things god will just have talk god have things to fulfill jesus was a man with a mission that's why what brother branham said is this when god speaks to a man he gives that man ambition and purpose two things he gives that man ambition and purpose and when that man's got revelation one evidence you're gonna see is two things you're gonna see humility and fearlessness oh glory to god could we give the lord some amens to be give the lord a shout when god speaks to a man he gave him ambition and purpose and after that when god reveals himself he will see two things a humble man and a man praise god with the drive hallelujah fearless because he has been in the presence of god and he has heard from the lord oh glory to god that's when elijah stumped up he said not even you or rain will fall till i call for it i don't care what the weather is saying i don't care what the weather man is saying i don't care what the people are saying i shut up heavens and you had to wait till i called for it to get the rain that you're looking for i stop your blessings i stop the anointing i stop everything hallelujah heaven is shut until i call [Applause] that's when a man yes from god oh hallelujah oh glory coming to crunch time now this is when the tire hit the road it's coming to crunch time now when you have to choose whether it will be part of the solution or you'll be part of the problem because if you're not part of the solution you are simply part of the very problem itself but jesus said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish the work he just finished handing the woman at the well oh glory to god he sent his disciples because he couldn't let them see what he was about to do he was about to call a name in the book and he had to push them guys away to always they get to speak to this woman and god will push this one away and push that one away to get to speak to you god will make sure you're in the right place and the right time to hear the right message come on shame and somebody god gonna make sure [Applause] because you have to hear from god you must you must hear from god hallelujah you see it has been so emphasized so much about ministers and ministers i have to push that straight into a corner known to bring it into balance have been too much about men and men have just messed up hallelujah but a real man messed up is not not that bad but you know yeah because in bible different men messed up but you know man uh who is real man man of god i should say they accept responsibility they don't blame they accept responsibility and they deal with where they messed up they confront with where they messed up they will handle where they messed up messed up is part of the package but it's if you're going to handle with what you're wearing messed up oh good counsel can somebody say amen oh praise the name of the lord so when god tells you something you have got to do it nobody else that's a quote when god tells you something you have got to do it nobody else oh we have to face up to it and do it it's our responsibility so that's why i challenge you to provoke one another not the rat not the anger not the backslide but the love and the good works come on you could make it not to talk not the yap yap yap yap yap we added for 40 years works oh glory that god is not right praise god from hearing him and this a part of this is on our facebook page i just love it so much and i said i'll bring back that to you unless i'm hearing him but iran says uh ministers he said watch god going to he gonna give a great watch if he give us this great sacred office he's going to require it at our hands so you think this is just standing up here preaching and i think but i'm saying am i going to be judged they say yes that's what they told brown then he said but i appreciate paul preach so it's not like just pass on okay okay i mean no no it's not that you know it there's a requirement that's why god said i require at the hands of those pastors who did not feed my flock and who fed themselves and did not feed the sheep they will answer for that my sheep that's what god sent the past feed my flock hallelujah oh glory to god amen so watch and we better preach the truth because god is going to if he's got a sacred office he's going to require it in our hands so what the tutor brought the message to the father oh this is good this is good the tutor reporting on your behavior not the deacon not the elder not the pastor the holy ghost he's the tutor he's reporting on your behavior not this man not somebody sending some drone over you looking where you're walking and whatnot no no no no this is the tutor he don't need drones he don't need somebody to walk behind you he knows where you are he knows where you have been he knows who you're talking to he knows the very thoughts itself hallelujah and he knows all about you and he can report on your very behavior oh glory to god what your wife is see what your husband don't see what the family don't see he sees [Applause] whether you say amen or not that ends up in what i'm preaching you know you don't ever hinder me you know hallelujah you are free and i am free if you are not free i am still free to tell you the truth because only the truth gonna set you free i am not here to tell you what you wanna hear i want to tell you what god put upon my heart oh hallelujah somebody got a revival in this place somebody gonna love the word all right so the tutor is reporting the child is progressing right or wrong so no matter what the outside people had to say about this child what the servants and the farmer to say he tried to work everywhere to please the father and no matter here we go no matter what the world has to say about you work to please god do everything you can to build the kingdom of god not to break it down to build it work to please god so i'm saying this for you to understand the beat that your pastor is in he's not trying to please anybody hallelujah i am not accountable to any man on planet earth so i am not beholden to any man to impress any man any group of men on earth i am only obligated to please my father [Applause] whose kingdom i represent when i go overseas i tell them i don't represent trinidad i represent the kingdom of the most high god that is what i represent a kingdom that cannot be moved oh give the lord some praises people hallelujah you see i am not preaching a private gospel customized for this country or for you jesus didn't say equal to all the world and preach your own private interpretation of what you think i am saying no he said preach the gospel and the gospel is the good news which is the word turn into power [Music] oh that music preaches in china in japan and asia in south america in canada in america in africa it doesn't matter i could preach the word because the word is god and the word can't return for it the word of power to deliver the way that power has set you free god sent his word to deliver his people the word of a hook on it he said my word shall not return unto me void you have got to believe that you are going to be delivered today because no faith is you have got to expect great things today because fear don't say next week say don't say tomorrow no faith is oh hallelujah [Applause] don't never divide it by the nominational barriers don't let those little things that man put over the church separate brotherhood because you're methodist she can't be the baptist because you're a presbyterian she came with a pentecostal we are brethren don't let little man barbwire's barriers separate you from the fellowship of the saints of the living god i will not let any man tell me i can't fellowship with brethren i reject that nobody can tell me you can't talk to this one and you can't talk to that one you have to be crazy lunatic aiming nuts i will talk to whoever i want to talk to smile [Applause] my god i would laugh i would smile i will eat i would fellowship with macgyver's but the pharisees with the sadducees with the herodians it doesn't matter who they are they can't change who i am i am who i am you are who you are come on give the lord some praises [Applause] so don't let little man by wire barrier separate you from the fellowship of the saints who are our brethren in like precious fate if they don't know just as much as you feel you pray for them and associate with them and fellowship with them and god will spread his love abroad in their hearts too all glory we have something to spread you know our testimony the love of god come into my heart i have a visa stamp to glory oh ha already approved oh hallelujah somebody passed through god's immigration you just pull out the passport and are you already stumped already you say come on true come on true come on through sealed till the day of redemption sealed oh glory to god possible stop jesus stamped you on your way to glory you're like abraham you're making you're looking for a situation builder is god you pick up a wife but you're still looking for that city it's not stop two children but you're looking for that city you're getting all but you're looking for that city degree here coming on but you're still looking for that city whose maker and builder is god oh john saw that city we are going to a city oh give the lord some praises people hallelujah praise god he said let's stay under the blood when that son had come to the age of 21 we call it a day if the tutor had brought with the father and told him everything was fine this boy was a gallant man he was zealous here we go of the father's kingdom not just you know uh i don't even know who my father business is jesus could have said that when he was 12 years old he said i am about my father's business now if you are about your father's business it means you have to know the father's business you're getting a revelation of the father's will to execute the father's plan for business because sun has to be approved you can't be doing nothing and get approval there's no approval for nothing the holy ghost signing you off for nothing how was he he did nothing he prayed nothing he worshipped nothing he actually did nothing he just came and occupied a seat in church and worshipped sometimes i got how he felt he was never interested in seeking the father's business and reading the word to get the father's will for his life now watch watch that he was zealous of the father kingdom and he done all here we go he's done all he could to improve and in better the kingdom that is what the father is looking for hallelujah to see the sons that want to improve and better the kingdom then this boy the father take them out in the public place that means every true ordained predestinated ministry of god must become publicly identified it can't be hidden in a corner hiding under bushel saying god is with me no some point in time god himself will take the mask off of all of that he will push you into the position where you have to be publicly identified as his son jesus had 18 years of silence but when the silence was about to be broken god loosed john the baptist to make a way for that announcement that the sun is about to come forth so when john the baptist said behold the lamb of god god was ready to say this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to publicly identify myself with come on somebody i'm going to pull him out from the bunch i'm going to pull him out from the rest and let the world know i'm with him oh give the lord a shout the praise people that's what god gonna do for you one day that's what god is about to do for you maybe today is your day maybe today that fire that dove of identification gonna come down upon your life oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah are you ready the father take them out into a public place set him up before the public his same son that had been born in his home years before all the time his son here we go but his character and his conduct had brought him to another office notice not his summons not his mighty revelation an unfolding of many hidden mysteries [Music] no his character and his conduct had brought him into another office or position so all these messages is only part of it so god is not so much interested in the newsroom dictation and reading the script off of the prom screen ah something kind of good behind her as the news coming in the slaving the news station she's reading off of a screen this is happening that is happening you can't get character reading off a screen you're reading news in the newsroom to get director you have to get up the newsroom i'm not hearing you i am not hearing you reading quotes that's that connect the newsroom but when you're loosed into the situations and they could come true oh hallelujah hallelujah my god because character is a victory glory to god you've got to overcome something that means god has designed conflict we need conflict we need battles we need sword fighting we need issues because that is how character comes forward okay my god i don't feel like preaching glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i told them in europe there are plenty people who don't like battles they don't like confusion they don't like to hurt anyone they still have anyone so they have no stand they don't ever sit they stand for nothing they have no witness in their mouth they please everybody they take no sides they hurt nobody they end up like dish rag you see i want the whole world to know what side i'm on i'm on the side of the word i will stand with any man who's with the world he don't even have to believe all that i believe but as much as he believed i will stand by him because the word is god i am not the revealer of the word the holy ghost is and if the holy ghost don't reveal it to that brother he can't get it because every man must minister according to the grace and fate that god gives that man and if god give me this small measure and give somebody a bigger measure god bless them but you see this little measure i have i'm going to use it because that's the measure god gave me glory you may be seated all those guys in the army had their sword some with nice hilt some with signature on it all of them sharps or some broad some silver hat sip some gold tip bronze tip what kind of tip and all david had was a little old sling and some stones just packing just in case he already killed a beer he already killed a lion in case a meat of anything i could handle myself i have something that i could use you may be seated that's the problem some of you have nothing to use safety bear come and call the pastor is the lion come you gotta call the elder if a mouse come and call your husband all right go there hallelujah but you have to call somebody because you're not prepared for issues and challenges you see if you understand this you would love when the issues hit you like that you will never back down you will say i born for this you know what it is to come back and meet your whole family taken your place burned down to the ground and all your mighty men depressed and discouraged and they want to stone you you know what the strategy that is but david encourage himself pull himself up by the bootstrap and sometimes you feel so battered and bruised so beat him to give up but don't give up not this morning not this morning not this morning not this morning no no no no not today no we're gonna push you we're gonna fight we're gonna press the battle you might be seated what do you mean about pursuit but over i prayed for my train before pray for them again but this time different you said you're going for them this time it's the only time you're praying that god break the foot break the hand do something to them they come back and house our god and whatnot no not that they're coming back [Applause] that's the first thing you have to declare they're coming back you have nothing to do with what they are now you know you're saying they're coming back are you serving the devil notice you let the devil know that you saying today by my word listen listen to what god told david not only but you getting back all right but i don't read all the scripture for you but david ride all night long all night long now watch here we go you might be seated david can i go and pray oh god are tired just come true but could you please help the philistines and the amalekites to bring back my wife inspire them turn around their heart impress them that you are god bring a vision to them god will and go see listen son wake up get on your horse and ride get some gallant men with you tell them tell them listen this you see fate tell sees the finished product tell them all will be restored everything oh so listen they had a victory before they even leave when they call on the horse to fix she was there when the first gallop started the victory was there didn't see the americas yet but the victory was there he is coming back because god said all will be restored and if god said all going to be restored all is going to be restored how many believe that inside of here this morning how many an expectation for full restoration oh hallelujah hallelujah oh could i get a brother to shout inside of here today i want to hear the men of god shout glory to god amen oh hallelujah it's conduct behavior brought him into another position inertia let's deal with that word calling nature last week he did about action is cause i want to deal with another word word called inertia inertia is a tendency to do nothing or remain unchanged it speaks of inactivity passivity stagnation idleness sluggishness liturgy populity indolence laziness and slutfulness that is initial in physics it is a property of matter by which it continues in existence state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless that state is changed by an external force so in inertia means when that comes to a rest it stays rest it don't move it is rested nothing changes inertia means when it continues along the line it see the straightening same speed same time same channel no change whatsoever 20 years no change 30 years no change it's the inertia i come to challenge that break that bust that rip into that chop down that action is caused ignition could just happen we are here to cause something to happen the prophet will take up a rapid treat up in the air and don't come a whirlwind oh hallelujah [Applause] the tendency of a body to preserve its state of rest or uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force imagine what bahrain says if love don't get you desperate the external force will it also carries lack of movement or activity when movement or activity is wanted or needed a feeling of not having the energy or desire that is needed to move or change one of the saddest thing for me as a pastor is to talk to christians who don't want to change they are religious and they are spiritual but not happy spiritual are visiting they are spiritual but the discontented spiritual the thing they are because they are spirit and they love jesus but the thing to move them to where they're supposed to go they're not moving because this is always been all these years you call that inertia this is what i know and change is always hard hallelujah oh glory hallelujah moses know what willingness but you know what glenn land joshua was a man was the landman moses was pushed out into the wilderness and there's a beautiful scripture where jeju take him and lead him and she was seen about jethro's sheep leading sheep you think moses no he had to leave all them bunch of people out there moses were even thinking about going back and then leading sheep so god had to strip him humble him give her an experience not knowing all of this is background for what he's going to do [Applause] what if moses said i you know who i am jetro come on former prince of egypt and joshua said correct former [Applause] that's what you used to have this is not egypt you're in my territory and you see my daughter there she's a nice lady so relax herself settle down and he gets settled down leading sheep no burden for egypt then they own back there until the lord called out to him in the burden bush but before god called unto him the god sent the attraction to see if he will turn aside and see and the bible says when he turn aside to see because some people are even taken aside they're so fixed in their ways and inertia all kind of things happening all around them but they're going down one way one way one way you got to turn some point in time i hope this service is a turning point a changing point a different kind of point yeah the devil condemned you of what you did on your past and what not turn aside to see what god is trying to tell you because you want you delivered if your mind is crippled up your spirit is crippled up you you up your side to see when you're telling us to see god spoke to moses and said moses time up fella head down to egypt new commission for you hallelujah go down and bring the people out hallelujah moses i don't make excuses lord i can't talk lord you know what it is i settle down right now i get new furniture i have a new tent i'm a crook i have new goats i have a whole fresh block of sheep and so on and lambs and so on but business going real good god said you didn't hear what i said uh do i have to repeat myself we pack up shop and get down to egypt and bring my people out then when moses started to accept watch that would accept now accept that there's nobody else could do what he has to do and when you begin to accept that nobody else could do what you have to do stop running and accept responsibility that you have got a job hallelujah when when moses recognized god not taking no excuses moses had to talk differently who shall i seize on me who who because this is both of us talking here now but when i get down there i mean what i will tell them you should tell them i am tell them i am that i am sent you you saw someone say good ago go nontell his wife zipporah get on the donkey we go in egypt when a month from now no tomorrow i don't have time to wait why wait time one time they could do no move now you think egypt is 24 hours it's not a train taking egypt it's a long journey get there and have to come one time and you know i mean god have the right timing for everything else when everybody coming up with their gifts and so on they want to know what moses bringing because those days egypt was the place all modern technology there was i mean they were the

believers got to let go how many know each other let go yeah yeah it's gonna be broken it's gonna be broken it's gonna be broken oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god you may be seated understand this the devil can't get stronger the devil has always been the devil but we can get stronger come on israel give the lord a shout the devil can't get stronger but we can glory hallelujah you may be seasoned so i want you to move from this inertia from this continue along the same path and get into activity into movement into becoming a dynamo because from that directive is where you get the word dynamics come from dynamo is to be in constant motion to produce a result isn't that right you got to have a movement in order to get something going for you you've got to have a stern up a worship up a praise up you've got to do something jesus said the works that i do shall you do also we are talking about works let's call it this way we talk enough i said talk done holy love god we're going to do something about all this talk that we talk that's why we're having a prayer line next week we are we are serving notice that we are going to do more than just preach we're going to pray we're going to cast devils out we are saying it before it happened we are going to heal the sick yes we have authority to do that yes how many believe that my god all right so works but abandoned preach is faith expressed works show that faith has already took a hole and paul wrote about justifying abraham by what god saw in abraham which is fate and james justified abraham by works and people thought it was a conflict or argument but then the prophet brought out that one was what god sees and the other is what man sees so the thing of it is this if you claim to have faith that's what god sees they have to be works to prove and bring evidence of the faith that you claim to have and if the word is bringing faith to you there got to be evidence by your work by your life by your actions and attitude that faith has truly taken a whole so if we don't see a behavior that matches up with the faith you claim then you maybe don't have the faith that you claim because once that faith inside of you take a whole there's a behavior that goes with it the bible said abraham started not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving praise to god so when faith take a hold it give praises the evidence of faith is the ability to worship because you can't be condemned and worshipped so when all condemnation is ripped out of you faith taking the whole of you going to give god praise because faith is saying it's already done faith have no need to be worried because faith is the very substance of what you're hoping for for good faith is already the victory you ready to see that so watch this the people depressed david man they want to stone him david said you know what let me go and seek the lord and call himself he go on and go to listen go push you you'll get back all david comedy smiling put a jaw a while ago he's depressed he's discouraged he is struggling and after god speak to him he's smiling his wife is not there yet but he's smiling his children but he's smiling the people has not retained it but he is smiling why faith is the victory and faith listen is a revelation from god come on now that is why people love group revelation they like to hide because it saves them the burden of seeking god it saves them but guess what that's a group thing and faith never belongs to a group faith never god never gave a group a revelation so when the pastors mess up the people and inductionize them for a personal gain manipulate them all the group the old bunch saying the same thing and sometimes it plumb off the word of god that's why jesus would say i am some say you're there some say that men always have opinions men always have interpretation men always have ideas i can't do what other brothers doing i i'm don't get it brahms says some culture is oats some call the red sheep some call her with goats he said the reason we can't be placed is because this one want to do what i want doing so god blessing that brother with corn and everyone on the planet corn too god say you're not called to plant corn your land is not a corn land your land is to go grass to feed the sheep grow your grass and feed your sheep let that other brother see what is corn come on say him and somebody said god give me corn leave me with the corn hallelujah glory to god it's that simple give the lord a shout of praise i am not in defend with nobody don't interfere with me messing with the wrong guy oh hallelujah glory to god in it hallelujah you may be seated so watch listen brother branham he's saying they are pentecost they say these men are full of new wine it was a great thing to do as it was happening too why it was god listen revealing himself to individuals yet was a hundred and twenty in the upper room but was god here we go reveal themselves to individuals noted it wasn't a group baptism everybody gave the liquor fire the baby said tongues of fire sat on each on every one of them everyone got their portion so when mary got a portion she didn't feel like to preach she feel led to make a nice apple pie you know what i'm saying all right so the anointing have to come to produce what god said supposed to produce okay now here we go here we go noah works expressed to man what his faith was in god's promise they couldn't see noah's fate they could see him building a act so man could say wait a minute he's serious he is acting upon what he believes now here we go david the shepherd sling expressed to the whole israelite army the faith he had in their god notice when it's revealed david become fearless so when i see people frightened and scared when i see minnesota shaking and they're saying things because they don't want to upset the apple god i know they do have a relationship they just follow him you see because they don't want to be punished because the food bowl might be taken away and they crack the preaching of the convention and if they need the attention of a convention they have to conform to the group theology to fit in but you know what the people have been denied genuine operation of gifts to minister effectively to the people by people trying to tell them what to preach and what inspiration to preach we don't need all of that all of us are different anthony is different from isaac eisen from me all different ministers they're different we want the difference we want that difference because that difference is how we could get the help you all sitting here everybody here don't have the same need can i hear a big man i am preaching here but everybody here don't have the same need then another minister come and preach and meet this one need another man preached means this one need the man preaches help this one and help that one and help that one we need help i have keep reading over and over i read for you he said the revelation and the hidden mysteries are for us to be able to know how to bring the members of our body in subjection to the word to know how to conduct ourselves the mystery is not to just argue and talk about behind mysteries i know more than you i am more russian on you i deeper than you i lighted on you i floated on you then people get up hook on a man what if i come and tell you this one falls that one falls that one have a fought that wanna fall this minister falls down missing out for diamonds and four diamonds you know what i'm doing there i'm messing everybody up i'm showing you i am the man now i'm not saying that direct i am seizing that at the subconscious level by messing everybody up nice poison that off that off that off that off and the way i off at the rate all them off because i seen them off so they are off and if they are off i have to be on no that's that's wrong that's just plain wrong church have falls of course it's a fault this church is open it can have an armchair critic out there sit and listen to the services i don't like that i don't like that he could have said that he got to say that of course i can say that by not saying that i can't see what you think i've seen out there come and say it for me send it for me for me to say it so anybody can see what they want because what we are saying we have no private gospel we preach the word that's why after service we could put up on the internet and who want to hear it hear it who don't want to hear it they don't listen to it that's fine but we are free this church is free and i am free to preach the gospel the gospel is not bad news the gospel is the good news come on same as somebody the gospel has got bad news about this one and that one all them pastors struggling you sit down a minute you today having a granted some of them have grand problems because the holy ghost not there so they'll take a human element they have turn lows are digging ushers spies assistance and associates people walking helping them nurturing them you had to want a ride home and everything else people almost live in an initiation all right so you never wouldn't get to them so i'm not even seeing other husbands the same body church they're serving the church they're like church nuns your daughter say amen it's destitute hallelujah and god wants to loose you out there to face the music wasn't god do jesus loose him into the wilderness let the devil tempt him amen do this do that you think god sorry god want to break your spirit yes god want to break this be too strong yes god went to break the spirit that he could get a yield in a position where you depend on him [Applause] it's good to be victorious but sometimes god has bring us to defeat for a purpose defeat this part of god's program i'm not hearing you some of you feeling dumb because you're defeated praise god defeat doesn't mean you're going to stay defeated defeat means you lost a battle that is not the war come on same as somebody that is only wrong number one give the lord a shout you're going to bounce back you're going to amen [Applause] struggling [Applause] you know i always preach just as the church of a vision or the prophet brought a vision a whom should have a vision that everybody have a vision connected to where we want to go what we want to achieve if i honed over vision the husband of a vision what do i help him into it is a man going nowhere because you're not seeking god for vision of where you want to go where you want to be what you want to accomplish because anytime you have purpose and you have a vision that is what will wake you up in the morning and say it is a great day because you are nearer than when you're first believer in other words sarah it was above for sure to get up because sarah was old and she didn't have a revelation so she had abraham saying don't worry sarah you're gonna make it and she problem is how and abram's story is i don't know but god said so so that that's the problem every so often does he fight with abram and syria because sarah don't understand why is abraham smiling like that because abraham only seen isaac and she can't see what he has seen because she don't have the revelation he has and that's a problem oh hallelujah so the stimulation of revelation that abraham had sarah liked [Music] so when abraham come home and saying i feel like traveling on ask me something to drink this system when abraham singing that kind of way she don't understand why he could sing like that when she is feeling all and feel to go and lie down oh give the lord some praises oh hallelujah oh glory hallelujah but you know what annoying sarah fate when the three men came down walking it was a hot day it was about 12 o'clock noon and three men came walking and sarah went to made some big because sarah taught by some other man talking and abraham began to talk to that man another alive and that man began to talk he said i will return to you and sarah gonna have that son and sarah laughs because she was here in the conversation and the man said why did sarah laugh and she knew she laughed within herself she knew not a man could have known that she was laughing in her heart that had to be god glory hallelujah then to hear those notable words i will return unto thee according to the time of life and say i shall have a son after that visitation sarah was changed all together because she knew something went between the bone and the mirror something went beyond her spirit and he's in the very torso intense of a heart she knew that was almighty god she knew that was elohim and everyone said i'm going to come back not as man anymore but as power as dynamic civil mechanics and abraham knew his wife caught the vision come on say him and somebody just had to wait on the feeling but the wife caught the vision and once the pride catch the vision you're only waiting for the visitation but the vision is for an appointed time oh i will surely visit you [Applause] it's going to be a mighty mighty visitation oh blessed be the name of the lord you may be seated oh hallelujah sometime i want to tell you something you talk about pulsation work on that pulsation that spear of the moment joshua did it mary magdalene did it when something is revealed to you grab it in the spirit of the moment my work shows my fate your faith is what god sees on you your works is what other people see in you isn't that right so faith that doesn't produce works anyone has a right to doubt your testimony isn't that right works is married to fate so if you say you're married raise your husband and you're not producing them we could don't you testimony but once you have faith works always are wrong works express the faith that you have they work together i i faith abraham who is not right you keep testifying is that right here this part no watch watch he considered not his own body now dead neither did this of sarah's womb it wasn't even brought under consideration that just shakes me body dead sarah's womb dead and he doesn't even consider that no here we go are you ready everybody ready no circumstances will be considered when faith finds its bedding ground [Applause] i want a bigger immune than that no circumstances is considered they was doing coke last night they were smoking marijuana last night that not even considered the doctors say is the last night tonight not even considered doctors give up not even considered doctors saying nothing could be done for you that's not even considered [Applause] you're speaking from faith you're walking from faith you're talking from faith you're living from inside faith by faith the justice oh i could give an example woman came and worshiped my daughters next to the devil she worked to be psyched she walked up jesus jesus is not fit to take the church but then casted a dog that didn't pack her up she didn't give up she stood right there where she's going the daughter that's with the devil if she go back you know that still gets for the devil [Applause] she know jesus could help her she's not going anywhere so instead of saying i'm not going anywhere she said lord oh she's enough to take his turn bread and caster the dogs then she bought truth lord i'm not going lord keep on talking lord i'm a dog lord i'll take whatever remain lord even the crumbs lord jesus said go thy way woman nice daughter it's healed go thy way woman that daughter is healed for their sin no prayer no prayer she said the right thing come on give the lord a shout our prayers you can say the writing today inertia not moving you never stand up in church never raise your hands never worship you raising this heist to the last five years and this morning you hear about inertia and is still at the same height that is inertia nothing could move you you move at nut you change it not and you're not god hallelujah when you're ready for change oh when you're ready for action see joshua was an action man david was an action man mark is 16 chapters in the book of mark but he's an action man jesus did jesus cast to cast out devils heal the sick action words to do to act not talk some people like the philosophical thing philosophy we want to get into the action part oh hallelujah no circumstance is considered oh man let me just skip down here remember joe they had no bible to read listen to this one he didn't have it as easy as we got today to read the words and see others who took it remember it's only by revelation joseph in genesis there was no bible moses or genesis leviticus deuteronomy none of those characters and they had any bible to read until after moses they didn't have a bible that we got to help us along in our crippled condition they were rugged men god revealed to them and they stood right there nothing moved them it's once nothing can move you once it's revealed to you but you just have to get a little start that's all you have to do just get your faith moving one time and god will do the rest oh hallelujah praise god he said the attitude is what brings the results if the attitude you take towards god here was a woman touches garment she was healed with a blood issue a soldier spit in his face and felt no virtue it's your approach the attitude is what it takes and that's what it is tonight dear friend it takes the attitude we are and believe that we are in the presence of jesus christ but it's our attitude that brings the results the mechanics is here here we go and so is the dynamics if you can just get started god will do the rest he didn't say get seated he said started in other words you got to get to moving i'm not hearing you that's why you said what we see should make a church that will make a revival you've got to want it you've got to want to make it [Applause] how to make a cake let there be a cake don't know how to make a gig you need eggs milk flour orange peel lime peel now if you feel i'm a cake exporter you just read it in the book i can make cake too but what i'm saying and you need all the things to mix it together then you beat it bring it in that's not the cake that the mixture it have to go in the oven and be baked at the right temperature isn't that right and when all that process you get the cake what it went through a process come on see him in somebody so if we have to get a revival come on you have to get the right mixture come on they were in the upper room they were praising god continually they have to mix it and blend in has to blend in blend in oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god has to blend in and does it blend in something being created around you an atmosphere is being created otherwise they're being created it attracts the holy ghost oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord all right praise god amen you will be seated hallelujah oh glory to god so watch something now as i as watch as god was brilliant bringing israel out his people a nation a nation out of a nation a beautiful time of the day god is calling here we go a bride out of a church a christian bride out of a church isn't that right it's sometimes called the chosen the elected the remnant it was called the bride the four ordained and so forth isn't that right praise be to jesus so brother branham says that he will call you a side church if you'll only obey him and stay on the word he will place into the church before the coming of jesus christ all the powers that was in christ will be in the church isn't that right god wanted his work done he sent his son his son wanted the work done he sent it into the church at that that you will know i and the father yield me and i knew isn't that right and the same power that was in jehovah god rested in jesus christ the same power that resident jesus christ rest in placed sons in the body of christ that's the prophecy isn't it right placing of a son there will be a power put into the church and now it's coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they will speak the word and it will create itself right there like that we haven't seen power likes coming into the church i know it as a fact he know it was coming the holy ghost going to anoint the people how could the holy ghost anoint the people that means the people must become the word because the spirit comes on the word oh hallelujah glory to god in the beginning was the word isn't that right then the word became flesh and jesus was anointed with the holy ghost but he was the word and the bride will become the word then the holy ghost have to come upon you the dynamics will strike you because the dynamic is for the bride and the church hallelujah is going to strike you oh blessed be of the lord no he listen to this adoption iframe don't want to stay one of them over there we said man manasuba there god said wait a minute i'm supposed to raise oats i'm gonna get corn too you ain't got nothing to do with corn get oats oats is your power to raise you ain't so you're supposed to hurt sheep and you are supposed to hurt cattle god wants to place the church listen carefully i don't want anybody to miss this god wants to place the church but every one of them wants to do the same thing and you can't tell them nothing about that hallelujah they got that coty gotti but but but but now watch god can take a man adopt him into the family and give him something first try that see if it is right the bible said try the spirit so if any minister pastor apostle whoever claim whatever claim anything and they don't want to be tried that is not the spirit of god because if you're having what is right it could be tried try that we're supposed to try the spirits nobody say accept this no try it see if it's right amanda claim a certain thing try it see if it is right if it is right move right with it and say lord send us something else and that's how god going to place the church isn't that right oh hallelujah now watch god could have chosen to preach the gospel by the sun by the moon by the stars by will nature but he chose men to preach the gospel and that is where the voice of god will come from and you can judge the voice according to the word it expresses then you can see what kind of voice you're listening to if it is contrary to the word don't listen to it but if it is the word then god is duty-bound to back it up so god will always back up and confirm his word moses pharaoh look out the window and saw these bunch of madoba's moses look out the same window and more they saw victory he had focus himself though he was a prince he was a heir but he knowed god promised abraham that he would visit his people moses looked out his window and he believed it because moses looked out by faith and when you are focused with the word of god you are directly in line and zirin then that fate of god is in you isn't that right look at the church today god wants us to watch for the supernatural when his word is made manifest and vindicated now if the devil says for you now wait a minute wait a minute maybe tonight you might be a little bit better when the revival starts might be fear might be good but don't wait till revival start become part of the revival right now god want to start it in you how many believe that go i want to start it in the church the holy spirit will take the messenger and send forth a message isn't that right and this quote i got it from pastor but a cliff chima in nigeria he said uh brother branham there's some why i'm praying for the sick he said i don't come as a fanatic i do not believe in fanaticism i wouldn't stand for it i know you don't believe in fanaticism you believe in the truth here we go and truth will always speak for itself you don't ever have to strain truth truth will always be true your doctor try to prove truth and thin truth no truth will speak for itself i love that oh praise god amen hallelujah you believe that praise god so here we go he said no wonder god can send a revival he has got nothing to build it on then he will take individuals and build it on them individuals and declare them before the world who will stay with the word from god called man he said we hear all this cry for revival and so forth and it's uplifting but god made a promise if my people has called by my name shall i send themselves to get on pray then they'll hear from heaven now this is the other half of what we're talking about the minister can't bring a revival but listen to this part and before we can have a revival god has to call out and train men god train men to carry this message and they describe the kind of men that they are they don't care what the opposition is they are willing to go into fiery furnace and defeat or to the lion's den or wherever it is because they have been in the presence of god and they know he is whether it's victory or defeat they will stand the same and that's the kind of training god gives his men isn't that right god very seldom call smart men educated and intellectual they play their part they are great men but usually when god wants the job done you know men who could explain the job they they could explain a job description they could conduct the interview they could explain all what you're supposed to do but when talking about the job done god have certain kind of men to get the job done hallelujah my meat is to do the work the will of god and to finish the work in other words i have a job to finish to do isn't that right so what's something usually he gets somebody who hardly knows his abc look to the histories men that amounted to something with god were not men of great education but men who had no education only desire in their heart to serve god he got a plow man he got a shepherd he got fishermen he get hunters and so forth oh what we need is that kind of man today not polish scholars but men who know god in the power of his resurrection oh blessed let's all stand and give god some worship musicians come up please oh hallelujah oh glory [Applause] oh praise the name of the lord oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god glory to god so let your works express your faith so we want to have a time of worship you didn't come forward oh praise the name of the lord we love you lord we worship you we adore you we magnify your name blessed be
