[35:56] somewhere isn't that right and listen to
[35:59] what the Prophet said influence you put
[36:00] one or two good members in a church that
[36:03] is really on fire for God it will do
[36:07] something for that church more than 40
[36:10] revivals could have we just need two

[37:06] here my lord send me let my influence be
[37:10] upon others let me live for Christ to

[37:16] so this prophet Isaiah that come into
[37:19] the presence of God it had an effect
[37:21] upon him and it's one kind of effect
[37:24] when you get into that kind of presence
[37:26] you recognize you are nothing you
[37:27] recognize you are unworthy you can't go
[37:30] in that presence uncovered any other
[37:31] story when your coin that presence is
[37:34] one in fact
[37:35] hallelujah and I will not hit Isaiah he
[37:38] said woe is me I'm undone I'm a man of
[37:41] unclean lips and I dwell among people of
[37:43] unclean lips Oh glory to God hallelujah
[37:45] then he got that calls come upon his

[38:32] has nothing to do with a fire will burn
[38:34] all of that
[38:35] holy fire from God that's what the
[38:39] church needs that's what the people
[38:41] needs that what the preacher means
[38:42] that's what the ministers need fire Holy
[38:45] Ghost fire real fire isn't that right
[38:47] hallelujah oh praise the name of the
[38:50] Lord I think now here is the truth of
[38:53] God I don't care what dream you had
[38:57] what kind of prophecy you give if it
[39:00] isn't God's Word it is wrong if it don't
[39:04] compare with the world that's the
[39:06] trouble today one has a dream one has a
[39:08] vision one has a tongue one of the
[39:10] revelation it got the whole thing's all
[39:11] messed up on everything else you got the
[39:13] nominations and broke everything up you
[39:14] ought to bring it to our final
[39:16] foundation that's God's Word churches
[39:18] will build upon one say Jesus is coming
[39:21] on a white horse daddy White Horse
[39:23] church and I've seen him in a vision
[39:25] they will make a choice of that kind
[39:27] then he's coming on a cloud they will
[39:29] make it that kind
[39:30] break them up separate it and call one
[39:33] another buzzer ruse loss hung out and
[39:35] everything like that white brother it
[39:37] goes to show in the first place your
[39:39] heart is not right with God when you do
[39:42] that
[39:43] we are brothers we must stick by one
[39:46] another we need one another
[39:49] oh praise the name of the Lord please
[39:53] God we skip down here quickly he's on
[39:56] the cat is true here now then but I was

[40:17] once was blind but now I see when I the
[40:19] sinner or not I don't know but I have a
[40:22] result of a testimony of proof of the
[40:25] effect of what this man is ministering
[40:27] and preaching he did something to me I
[40:29] was blind but now I see so if they want
[40:32] to talk your sinner talk and you're off
[40:33] talk but you could keep on talking but

[59:41] [Music]
[59:46] amen we want to turn our Bibles to
[59:48] Matthew chapter tree Galicians up the
[59:50] tree and we go over to colleges up to
[59:52] four and also Romans chapter eight we
[59:55] wanna read mature trees with 16 and 17
[59:58] Galatians tree from verse 26 to 29 and
[1:00:01] we read Galatians 4:1 2:7 and Romans
[1:00:04] 8:14 to nineteen we go to matthew
[1:00:08] chapter three 16 and 17 and Jesus when
[1:00:13] he was baptized went up straightway out
[1:00:15] of the water and lo the heavens were
[1:00:18] opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of
[1:00:21] God descending like a dove and lighting
[1:00:25] upon him and lo a voice of heaven saying
[1:00:28] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[1:00:33] pleased we go across to Galatians
[1:00:36] chapter 3 verse 26 for you're all the
[1:00:46] children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
[1:00:49] for as many of you as have been baptized
[1:00:52] into Christ have put on Christ there is
[1:00:56] neither Jew nor Greek there is neither
[1:01:00] bond nor free there is neither male nor
[1:01:03] female for ye are all one in Christ
[1:01:08] Jesus and if you be Christ's then are ye
[1:01:12] Abraham's seed and heirs according to
[1:01:16] promise chapter 4 now I say that the
[1:01:18] heir
[1:01:18] as long as he's a child different
[1:01:21] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[1:01:24] of all but is under tutors and governors
[1:01:26] until the time appointed of the Father
[1:01:29] even so we when will the children will
[1:01:32] bondage under the elements of the world
[1:01:34] but when the fullness of the time was
[1:01:36] come God sent forth his son made of a
[1:01:40] woman made under the law to redeem them
[1:01:43] that were under the law that we might
[1:01:46] receive the adoption of sons and because
[1:01:50] he has sons God hath sent forth the
[1:01:52] spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:01:55] crying
[1:01:56] crying our Father wherefore thou art no
[1:02:00] more a servant but a son and then and if
[1:02:04] a son then an heir of God through Christ
[1:02:07] we go to Romans 8 for in the nineteenth
[1:02:19] Force many as I led by the Spirit of God
[1:02:24] they are the sons of God for you have
[1:02:28] not received the spirit of bondage again
[1:02:30] to fear but you have received the spirit
[1:02:33] of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father
[1:02:37] the spirit itself bears witness with our
[1:02:40] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:02:43] and if children then heirs heirs of God
[1:02:46] and joint-heirs with Christ if so be
[1:02:49] that we suffer with him that we may be
[1:02:52] also glorified together for I reckon
[1:02:56] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:02:58] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:03:01] glory which shall be revealed in us for
[1:03:05] the earnest expectation of the creature
[1:03:06] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:03:09] sons of God let's have a word of Prayer

[1:05:06] about my father's business age 12 and
[1:05:09] he's talking about the father's business
[1:05:13] this is a prayer from adoption but a
[1:05:16] brand bless us now as we approach the
[1:05:18] word and father don't know it's the
[1:05:20] reason that I'm approaching the word
[1:05:22] from this very scripture here it's
[1:05:25] because that I feel you want me to do it
[1:05:27] this way
[1:05:28] it's your Divine Will it is your order
[1:05:30] is the order of the day to let the
[1:05:34] people positionally find their place and
[1:05:37] be ready for the hour of battle as our
[1:05:42] brother said in his prayer to you not
[1:05:44] long ago you have trained us so long
[1:05:46] Lord father give us our ranks put us out
[1:05:50] here so that week's supposed to do what
[1:05:53] we supposed to do so we can be about our
[1:05:56] father's business for we ask it in Jesus
[1:05:58] name thy son amen
[1:06:03] no Galatians 4 it says that the air as
[1:06:07] long as a child different nothing from a
[1:06:10] servant
[1:06:11] he's a son because he's born in the
[1:06:14] house he didn't join a house he was born
[1:06:18] in the house and there's an appointed
[1:06:21] time for the father to positionally
[1:06:23] please that son or that child but the
[1:06:28] child has to be trained trained tutored
[1:06:34] given special tests to see if he could
[1:06:38] handle the father's business because if
[1:06:41] he doesn't prove himself he will make a
[1:06:44] mess on the job
[1:06:46] the father don't want mess on the job
[1:06:49] the father want a son trained because
[1:06:52] before he put him in the position of
[1:06:54] authority and power are you with me
[1:06:58] hallelujah today forgive me I'm just
[1:07:05] blessed in my in my groove right now
[1:07:11] today I am NOT talking about a man's
[1:07:16] office position elder Deacon trustee
[1:07:23] pastor Bishop Pope I am talking about
[1:07:27] the man
[1:07:29] not the position so that covers all of
[1:07:34] us at the same level I'm not all my
[1:07:37] principal teacher taxi driver whatever
[1:07:40] work not not what you do not a job not a
[1:07:44] career I'm talking about who you are it
[1:07:53] is not the office that will be adopted
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:08:01] it is the man that's going to be adopted
[1:08:06] it's not the office that God said I am
[1:08:09] pleased it is the man that corset this
[1:08:14] is my son in whom I am well pleased
[1:08:21] it is the posture or teacher or parcel
[1:08:27] being adopted
[1:08:28] it is the son the right kind of a son or
[1:08:34] could we get a lot some praises
[1:08:35] [Applause]
[1:08:39] God has all kind of sons disobedient
[1:08:43] sons rebellious sons backslidin sons
[1:08:46] he's not looking for pastor bishop
[1:08:48] elders he's looking for sons that he
[1:08:50] could professionally please as pastors
[1:08:53] bishops elders whatever whatever
[1:08:56] position he's like of a son but he could
[1:08:59] place in a position of influence with
[1:09:02] power so this thing about son has to do
[1:09:09] with relationship with father
[1:09:14] so newer comes in relationship the way
[1:09:21] in which two or more people what things
[1:09:23] are connected a state of being connected
[1:09:27] state of being connected by blood or
[1:09:30] marriage and we have to be connected by
[1:09:33] both by Jesus blood and by Meritor of
[1:09:37] him blood our marriage so it was a trial
[1:09:42] for me to see how much Jesus was
[1:09:46] connected to the Father in every turn
[1:09:50] and I go back to the Bible you began as
[1:09:53] if Jesus was really into this
[1:09:55] relationship with his father the son can
[1:09:59] do nothing except the father show him
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:03] the father has given me all things in
[1:10:06] them by power it's not me to do it the
[1:10:09] works is the father in me that do it the
[1:10:12] words when you see me you see the father
[1:10:16] the father is greater than I oh
[1:10:18] hallelujah praise God the son can do
[1:10:22] nothing except to see the fur so Jesus
[1:10:24] was in debt this real no not notice
[1:10:29] there was no church inside Elena there's
[1:10:32] no office in Saturday I had a pastor
[1:10:34] marry another partially secretary and
[1:10:37] yet no this is just father and son
[1:10:42] whatever I was prayin is our Heavenly
[1:10:45] Father i tongue me tonight because we
[1:10:49] are living in the hour of preparation
[1:10:52] you are preparing the people to believe
[1:10:56] all things missing limbs will be
[1:11:01] restored I have never seen that before
[1:11:06] but it's gonna be
[1:11:07] [Applause]
[1:11:12] let me just shake your faith a little
[1:11:14] think about it now missing limbs will be
[1:11:18] restored by this power we are talking
[1:11:21] about by this manifestation of the sons
[1:11:24] of God this will be talking about when
[1:11:28] men speak and the work is created just
[1:11:30] like that
[1:11:33] jesus said bread and multiply it

[1:20:59] worship in spirit and truth jesus said
[1:21:02] so but we get so statue we just can't
[1:21:05] make a grunt
[1:21:09] hee hee whether he was that keep that
[1:21:16] for yourself keep upping him for
[1:21:18] yourself all the for Brees 24 hours they

[1:21:22] this one cast on the chrome this one
[1:21:25] side of worship on Towson Santa risen
[1:21:27] hallelujah glory lesson honor power
[1:21:30] might belong with alum forever ever
[1:21:33] [Applause]
[1:21:41] you NBC said nobody knew that trouble
[1:21:45] I've seen so I wish it right now nobody
[1:21:48] know about Jesus yeah your self continue
[1:21:50] with your own trouble
[1:21:51] you better start a worship because you
[1:21:53] have your troubles you can have your old
[1:21:54] troubles don't have to help you and he
[1:21:56] said to pusher
[1:22:00] oh give the law some praises
[1:22:04] let me see that worship expresses a
[1:22:09] level of faith because it's not about
[1:22:12] you it's not even about your feelings
[1:22:14] because you are actually making a
[1:22:16] sacrifice yeah belly pain yeah I've had
[1:22:19] pea stress pain of children pain your
[1:22:21] family pain your kind of pain but just
[1:22:23] decide to say hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:22:25] God knows there's a sacrifice you have
[1:22:28] defined gravity because pressure
[1:22:32] supposed to have your shoulder you know
[1:22:33] so oh god nobody knows the trouble I've
[1:22:36] seen nobody knows at the truth but when
[1:22:38] you shake yourself up shake back his
[1:22:40] shoulders he's paralyzed a man you take
[1:22:44] your pressure as a man so I reckon that
[1:22:48] the pressure and the child of this
[1:22:49] present world is not worthy to be
[1:22:52] compared with the glory that God is
[1:22:56] about to unveil on fall reveal manifest
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:12] let me see that we can say a manager how
[1:23:17] the horsemen must dread to say that to
[1:23:18] the father
[1:23:19] hold on II grunting go Hawks are
[1:23:26] reporting who is fritzy next humming let
[1:23:30] me talk about gee no matter what he let

[1:23:49] hunting like that but just if I get the
[1:23:53] guy inoculation or something so I'm not
[1:23:55] sure again operation hand stiff the hand
[1:23:57] stiff right they get some kind of
[1:23:58] injection or some diesel yes the devil
[1:24:00] in Jack you check your unbelief because
[1:24:03] we recognize that the devil deceive all
[1:24:05] or I worship the Beast all I worship
[1:24:09] Lucifer except those whose names on the
[1:24:12] book and a few see on him on the book
[1:24:14] you'll have to believe you have to
[1:24:16] behave like John when John saw is there
[1:24:19] John was filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:22] John could have behaved himself as I am
[1:24:24] John Phil but holy was let me take a
[1:24:26] seat and watch you misbehave in a cyber
[1:24:28] just like a mess man he was the first
[1:24:29] one he said all in heaven all under the
[1:24:33] earth the right John he wanted to give
[1:24:36] his own testimony about the power of
[1:24:38] worship the power of praise when you see
[1:24:42] your name
[1:24:48] let us nothing be with your sins that
[1:24:51] has nothing to with your sins that has
[1:24:54] nothing to do with your sins it has to
[1:24:57] do with you
[1:24:58] seeing ya
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:07] what you may be seated
[1:25:09] but when we are obedient and love him
[1:25:12] and praise Him and give him glory how
[1:25:17] the Holy Spirit must love to bring this
[1:25:19] him how is it father you know what your
[1:25:22] son is just thank you he said in a chip
[1:25:25] off the old block he loves you he's
[1:25:28] obedient now if that boy is no good yet
[1:25:31] he's a son he's never nothing but a son
[1:25:34] because he's born a son but if he's not
[1:25:37] obedient and the right kind of a son he
[1:25:41] just continues a son without any reward
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:46] so today choose your choice
[1:25:54] [Applause]
[1:25:58] once a Sun over the Sun but if you want
[1:26:03] to be a place son
[1:26:04] you have to be the right kind of us
[1:26:06] [Applause]
[1:26:10] so we are not questioning your sonship
[1:26:13] we left confession in your salvation
[1:26:15] you're not personally diag1 me the Lord
[1:26:18] and so on we're not questioning that you
[1:26:20] may be seated because this endtime
[1:26:23] rapture promise is a pheromone who died
[1:26:25] went on to be Lord we who are alive and
[1:26:30] remain we are the ones that have
[1:26:35] forgotten that channel to bring the rest
[1:26:38] up
[1:26:39] [Applause]
[1:26:45] so every believer every brother dadang
[1:26:48] going on is more burden on the bride is
[1:26:51] more pressure for perfection because it
[1:26:54] has to come to perfection to bring a
[1:26:55] resurrection nobody'd ever know one has
[1:26:57] to be perfect
[1:26:58] she wanted to be good a court here but
[1:27:05] perfections was promised not good good
[1:27:10] is the enemy of proofing Oh glory to God
[1:27:19] and I was perfection is his life in you
[1:27:22] it's not what you can do what you can do
[1:27:26] is very good but when his men come
[1:27:28] inside of you
[1:27:29] it's perfect so that obedience son he
[1:27:37] had a place in of that son when he gets
[1:27:40] in an age as an inch he's taken on into
[1:27:42] a public place and they're a great

[1:32:11] think God don't see what you're doing
[1:32:13] you're fooling me no oh you can fool me
[1:32:18] but you can't fool God so the end of it
[1:32:21] is not about your position you have the
[1:32:24] work you have your career position it's
[1:32:27] about who you are that's what I matter
[1:32:38] the church today the reason we don't
[1:32:40] have many mighty great manifestations
[1:32:42] the great Church of the Living God and
[1:32:44] these last days should be fired on the
[1:32:46] road with every divine gift set in order
[1:32:50] a great beautiful church but we are
[1:32:54] broke up in denomination isms little
[1:32:56] forces and everything else till the
[1:32:57] court can no more with us until we come
[1:33:00] together and get our hearts right with
[1:33:03] God
[1:33:04] that's why our blessings are both run
[1:33:07] out that's why in the churches is
[1:33:09] getting cold
[1:33:10] cooling off is because we have become
[1:33:12] indifferent towards God
[1:33:14] his Spirit and his word I'm just true we
[1:33:17] never welcome the Holy Spirit no more
[1:33:21] so when you come to church it's a great
[1:33:24] responsibility you see I want to get off
[1:33:27] at church I'm getting to your position
[1:33:29] of sons when you come to church as a son
[1:33:33] forget Church when you come to church as
[1:33:35] a son you come to worship you come to
[1:33:37] welcome the Holy Spirit you you you you
[1:33:40] I'm talking to that's under what nobody
[1:33:42] else you know within the group first
[1:33:44] time idol worship the whip you up
[1:33:47] everybody praying but you're not praying
[1:33:48] you mind man
[1:33:51] you open the prayer on you man you're
[1:33:57] the pretty one self let us take your
[1:34:01] wouldn't for God isn't that right
[1:34:04] that's when God's gonna see and welcome
[1:34:06] to mom bless second Timothy three all
[1:34:08] Scripture is given by inspiration of God
[1:34:12] and is profitable for doctrine for
[1:34:14] reproof for correction for instruction
[1:34:16] in righteousness that the man of God may
[1:34:20] be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[1:34:22] good works and the amplifier is every
[1:34:26] Scripture is god-breathed given by
[1:34:29] inspiration profitable for instruction
[1:34:33] reproof and conviction of sin correction
[1:34:39] of error and discipline in obedience and
[1:34:44] for training in righteousness which is
[1:34:48] in holy living in conformity to God's
[1:34:51] Word and with will and in thought
[1:34:54] purpose and action
[1:34:56] so the Scriptures itself that we bring
[1:34:59] is to print correction it's a big
[1:35:01] reproof is to rebuke you is to instruct
[1:35:04] you in to bring guidance to you and if
[1:35:07] you don't want it that's that's your
[1:35:10] kindness son
[1:35:12] but if you want to be the right kind of
[1:35:15] a son you'll respond to this because all
[1:35:18] Scripture is god-breathed all Scripture
[1:35:23] is inspired and there's a purpose behind
[1:35:25] the Scriptures the scriptures by the
[1:35:28] Holy Spirit
[1:35:29] bring the tutorship upon your life
[1:35:31] Sheila fights in a pulpit you're not
[1:35:33] fighting a man of God you're fighting
[1:35:35] your own blessing your own inheritance
[1:35:37] by wrestling with what God is beating
[1:35:39] through the word Oh hallelujah
[1:35:44] so Abraham he had was to come into full
[1:35:49] obedience God said separate yourself of
[1:35:53] my brethren and that's what you have to
[1:35:55] do a lot of times separate yourself from
[1:35:58] a lot of unbelief and remember here we
[1:36:00] go are you ready until Abraham fully
[1:36:05] obeyed God the blessing never come until
[1:36:10] he fully obey God
[1:36:12] think about your blessing being locked
[1:36:14] up and stored up nobody got take it is
[1:36:17] yours it mocking Niemann it it's it's
[1:36:20] there but because of your actions
[1:36:23] because you're not separated you can
[1:36:26] only get your instrument gotta open it
[1:36:28] folding he could cope Moloch creaks and
[1:36:31] something fallen here is yours nobody
[1:36:33] can take it is yours it's resolved but
[1:36:36] for that full window to open up
[1:36:39] you have to calm enter for obedience
[1:36:42] [Music]
[1:36:44] how do i running out know you somebody
[1:36:49] recognizes done no don't watch pc amen
[1:36:53] if i preach in he would see under
[1:36:57] watching me nobody's in a design you
[1:36:59] know what
[1:37:04] until abraham fully obeyed God the
[1:37:06] blessings never come until he fully
[1:37:09] obeyed God he took his daddy along and
[1:37:11] he caused trouble then a lot finally
[1:37:13] caused trouble who its Mun Gordon tell
[1:37:15] him bring the people in he system for
[1:37:17] yourself he's a dirty cop blood come but
[1:37:20] I'm the bring along to the long drag
[1:37:22] along always be on a toot along and his
[1:37:24] job let me same people he thought
[1:37:25] trouble he still having a separate from
[1:37:29] them 20% say even on that you don't
[1:37:37] wanna separate yet your choice that's
[1:37:42] your choice I want my blessing brother
[1:37:47] if are several myself of you I go on I
[1:37:52] want my blessing do you want your
[1:37:56] pleasure you have to have a burden for
[1:37:58] your father's business
[1:38:03] hallelujah fathers business and as soon
[1:38:11] as he got separated from everything when
[1:38:14] he fully obeyed then God brought the
[1:38:16] blessing then is when we see when full
[1:38:19] obedience come when he was about to take
[1:38:21] the life of his own son the image of the
[1:38:24] Lord call from the skies and held his
[1:38:25] hand there's I ran behind him he took
[1:38:27] them round and said where that ram come
[1:38:29] from Oh praising him of always skip that
[1:38:31] but if I'm said the only way you're
[1:38:33] gonna pay the price the top body token
[1:38:34] is accepted for obedience to the whole
[1:38:38] Word of God entitle you to the token
[1:38:40] full of pity is not part of it as far as
[1:38:42] information goes but all of it fold into
[1:38:45] the world which is Christ brings you to
[1:38:47] Christ
[1:38:48] oh follow billions complete obedience
[1:38:50] isn't that right so when God expect you
[1:38:53] to do a certain thing he demands a
[1:38:56] complete separation from any doubt you
[1:38:58] have got to come to follow billions to
[1:39:01] obey what he says God demands it you
[1:39:03] can't do it not away no we set an
[1:39:05] example and this was the example
[1:39:06] complete separation from all of his own
[1:39:10] family skin tread and walk a new life so
[1:39:16] if you're the right kind of son you will
[1:39:18] stay with the word Gorgona chastise you
[1:39:21] are going to bring down the whip you're
[1:39:23] gonna bring down the blues but you wanna
[1:39:25] stay with the word whatever arm says God
[1:39:28] was doing here we call a prison of a son
[1:39:30] and before he fell heir to the kingdom
[1:39:32] of his father possession the first that
[1:39:34] son had to be raised and tried he had to
[1:39:38] find out whether the son was a true son
[1:39:40] or just a roustabout this son will never
[1:39:43] be heir if he wasn't qualified to take
[1:39:47] the father's place
[1:39:49] so the God's objective is for the son to
[1:39:53] take his place so the test and the trial
[1:39:57] is to qualify you for position listen if
[1:40:02] you've been tested you have been
[1:40:04] considered worthy
[1:40:06] for the interview for this job if you
[1:40:14] are not being tested I think it should
[1:40:16] be worried I think you should be
[1:40:21] concerned because the tests and the try
[1:40:25] is because you have the potential you
[1:40:28] don't waste time and people who don't
[1:40:29] want the linen you leave them alone they
[1:40:31] under own but because the child is
[1:40:34] willing to give it a crack to give it a
[1:40:36] chance but as Isaac's Pitt spoke
[1:40:38] something he said as a head of the home
[1:40:41] or the house or you get a position or
[1:40:42] promotion he had a new doodlings step up
[1:40:45] or step out the position is always
[1:40:48] higher than you if you get a promotion
[1:40:51] it is always higher than you it is
[1:40:54] always more responsibilities it will be
[1:40:56] always more pressure and stress whether
[1:40:58] love you more peer to say one more pair
[1:41:04] but not more pressure
[1:41:05] well you don't master no pressure at all
[1:41:07] just go for no pee before Lupe and I get
[1:41:12] a load job and you have no pressure you
[1:41:14] have nobody under your you have no
[1:41:16] responsibilities you don't open the
[1:41:17] office close the office is nothing but
[1:41:22] this father's business it's a huge
[1:41:26] responsibility
[1:41:28] it's a tremendous responsibility and he
[1:41:32] can't give his business over the rascals
[1:41:35] most of all and people that just don't
[1:41:37] care so he has to have some kind of way
[1:41:43] to measure and to qualify and to ship my
[1:41:48] interview and buy tests the kind of
[1:41:52] want for the business the kind of
[1:41:54] wrong person to ruin your business your
[1:41:57] business will boss God business is not
[1:42:00] going to bus
[1:42:01] come on same as somebody Jesus as my
[1:42:05] father sent me so send I you
[1:42:09] hallelujah hallelujah I'm not sending
[1:42:12] you just to do your own thing it's a
[1:42:15] certain way I'm sending you as my father
[1:42:18] sent me to see me my father sent me I am
[1:42:21] sending you I thought that you wanna
[1:42:24] know I'm and the father you and me I am
[1:42:29] you or give the Lord some praises
[1:42:32] churches out of it
[1:42:35] Oh give the Lord some show-cell I could
[1:42:39] see you asking God and God answering
[1:42:41] your prayer for glory of God hallelujah
[1:42:44] hallelujah praise God praise God
[1:42:49] okay so you want to know if he's
[1:42:52] qualified it took them to take the
[1:42:54] father's place okay and then all the
[1:42:57] father had was given to the son and
[1:42:59] there is where I think that many of us
[1:43:02] Pentecostal people has made a mistake we
[1:43:05] think as surely as we become sons and
[1:43:09] daughters of God that settle it we just
[1:43:13] come into a place of trying and I don't
[1:43:18] think people appreciate that too much
[1:43:21] because I hear complaints I hear moomer
[1:43:24] ins
[1:43:24] yet people attitude and whatnot they
[1:43:27] don't see God they see this one affect
[1:43:32] me that one effect met this one knew me
[1:43:35] they did not see it God permit this one
[1:43:39] God allowed that one God permit this to
[1:43:43] happen and that to happen he's not
[1:43:45] destined am SoDo pointer finger them she
[1:43:48] and I and she cost me the ax show and I
[1:43:51] didn't want to do it you know but
[1:43:52] because II I was a little detail about
[1:43:57] when you said that
[1:43:58] that's about hittin no no you wanted to
[1:44:03] hit him you choose to hit him it have no
[1:44:07] excuses you have to make a choice
[1:44:09] because Dom has chosen you have to
[1:44:12] choose the right action because you no
[1:44:16] longer pleasing man come on now the peas
[1:44:19] are not the pasta forget about that your
[1:44:22] present God
[1:44:27] then every believer sat a match in step
[1:44:30] with the word March and step with the
[1:44:33] spirit margin and separate God when you
[1:44:36] open it just as an army walk inside
[1:44:41] when you praying you're not praying Lila
[1:44:43] and somebody prayer somebody praying
[1:44:45] desperate in you only true Lord Amen God
[1:44:47] that's right Lord thank you Jesus
[1:44:49] yes ha are you supporting up with some
[1:44:53] prayer when you when you use a dipper
[1:44:55] I mean free to open more betrayed or not
[1:44:58] the whole debris so how you in contact
[1:45:01] with your father without any
[1:45:02] communication well let's talk to a
[1:45:04] father where were two months ago wheels
[1:45:07] well after your Bible well since last
[1:45:09] year no no no no that's not fellowship
[1:45:13] that's not relationship if it was all
[1:45:15] Jesus was it I always do that with
[1:45:17] pieces of father father times our day
[1:45:19] and reveal yourself to them always
[1:45:22] talking about the we gonna get into
[1:45:23] it the Methodist said as soon as a
[1:45:30] shouted desolate somehow new name some
[1:45:36] say no deity who leave us someone paid
[1:45:38] three or four some is it some is the
[1:45:41] only bride and all kind of fun doctors
[1:45:44] my white horse cloud all you go wrong or
[1:45:46] indifferent doctrines that the pin on
[1:45:48] dogmatic that is it
[1:45:49] now I don't mind I say what I say you
[1:45:51] know but I covered a comma and let more
[1:45:54] unfold 100 Trump he blowing a trumpet
[1:45:58] one on this one on mysteries some people
[1:46:01] saying we do pushing of mysteries we
[1:46:04] shorten the mysteries same regulating
[1:46:06] Holy Ghost dynamics I don't know what
[1:46:08] the preacher give because Noah preached
[1:46:11] 120 years he same thing when you come
[1:46:14] for service Sunday morning to Noah Lois
[1:46:18] I take my Bibles it will ring subject it
[1:46:22] will rain inspiration it will read
[1:46:26] [Applause]
[1:46:34] because says will not tired yet up it's
[1:46:36] still gonna read when you're tired on a
[1:46:39] cell phone under it but if both are
[1:46:41] leaving here so how do you broadly then
[1:46:43] must reign for that to leave how we live
[1:46:46] in here
[1:46:46] howdy Seiko be healed how did I ever see
[1:46:49] how the Crippler gonna walk how did that
[1:46:52] will be raised up it hasta in
[1:46:55] [Applause]
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:07] some of them ago talk to their friends
[1:47:09] they could talk to their co-workers they
[1:47:10] could not lead ever themselves we
[1:47:11] wouldn't talk to you no fellowship I'm
[1:47:16] going to heaven
[1:47:18] whichever portably Tyrion which one but
[1:47:24] when we are what a day of rejoicing that
[1:47:30] will be
[1:47:31] the Bible said every cell we have no sin
[1:47:34] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[1:47:39] not in us but if we confess our sins he
[1:47:44] is faithful and just to forgive us of
[1:47:48] all our sins and to cleanse us of all
[1:47:51] unrighteousness
[1:47:52] then when we do that we cannot
[1:47:55] fellowship one with another and the
[1:47:58] blood of Jesus cleanses us o us who born
[1:48:03] in similar predicament us who common the
[1:48:05] world speaking lies the blood of Jesus
[1:48:08] cleanses us and we can have fellowship
[1:48:11] one with another or could we get a shout
[1:48:15] in the house
[1:48:19] if we say we have fellowship and we have
[1:48:22] blood and we cannot fellowship with our
[1:48:24] brother we lie and speak not the truth
[1:48:27] maybe Caesar so no matter what kind of
[1:48:41] position God put you in you are still
[1:48:43] growing towards perfection
[1:48:45] I will never reach that there Jesus
[1:48:48] comes now notice if God acted any one
[1:48:51] thing on a certain circumstance and that
[1:48:53] single circumstance arise again he's got
[1:48:56] to act the second time like he did the
[1:48:58] first time
[1:48:59] oh he's unjust so no matter how bad you
[1:49:02] are in sin how stupid we become he is
[1:49:06] got up to you like he did that fallen
[1:49:10] woman or he acted wrong then now hear
[1:49:13] about God's behavior is this person what
[1:49:19] he is in his behavior it is its person
[1:49:23] and that's the way you are in your
[1:49:25] behavior tell you what you are it
[1:49:28] doesn't tell you about your office
[1:49:29] somebody could be a prime minister be
[1:49:31] adulterer somebody could be a CEO and be
[1:49:34] a hater somebody could be a manager be a
[1:49:37] murderer it's not the office is the man
[1:49:40] so God is not interested in in this
[1:49:42] position in that position you want to
[1:49:44] know you who you are tell me about
[1:49:46] yourself
[1:49:49] some how many ago to interview they
[1:49:52] asked the question tell me what yourself
[1:49:57] you mean you mean you do know about you
[1:50:01] and when you can't talk about yourself

[1:56:59] doctrine no it has nothing to do with
[1:57:03] doctrine that is why barber and said I
[1:57:06] rather somebody write in their spirit
[1:57:10] and wrong in their doctrine than

[1:57:26] wrong in your spirit you cut correct
[1:57:32] when somebody writes me spirit you can
[1:57:34] correct me wrong doctrine that's the
[1:57:47] truth
[1:57:47] so God is not concerned with your spirit
[1:57:50] then you're teaching your spirit and
[1:57:53] your doctrine God is not concerned about

[2:00:11] tutorship
[2:00:11] was that the father is so busy in his
[2:00:13] business he have no time to teach his
[2:00:15] son so you have tutors to teach his son
[2:00:19] he used to get the best and the best is
[2:00:22] the Holy Spirit that he released to
[2:00:24] bring training and discipline to his
[2:00:26] sons and the Holy Spirit was sent to
[2:00:28] govern and guide the church God give the
[2:00:31] Holy Spirit to do that the father would
[2:00:33] seek not seek a man to try to get a
[2:00:35] fairness gap we call it now the father
[2:00:37] is a renegade and and and if the son of
[2:00:40] the renegade and he might not say it
[2:00:41] suddenly locate or he's he's fine he's

[2:00:53] for he wanted to know exactly the wealth
[2:00:55] of the boy at all times he sent the Holy
[2:00:59] Ghost upon the church to be the teacher
[2:01:01] and the razor of the church that is why
[2:01:04] a lot of men replace the Holy Ghost so
[2:01:06] the people don't even look for the Holy
[2:01:08] Ghost they don't expect the Holy Ghost
[2:01:10] they expect the man have the man dead

[2:06:31] block he does exactly like you
[2:06:33] he loves the thing you love he does the
[2:06:35] work exactly like you done it when you
[2:06:37] was out there that's a report that's the
[2:06:41] kind of church that the Holy Ghost likes
[2:06:42] to put it before God and if that child
[2:06:44] did not obey oh my I was an obedient
[2:06:48] child he was never was no more than a
[2:06:51] son it remain a son
[2:06:53] had no inheritance no we don't want to
[2:06:57] stay in that place you don't want to
[2:06:59] stay where you have no inheritance you
[2:07:01] want this inheritance
[2:07:03] I want to see a Church of God in deep
[2:07:07] sincerity don't lie to impress me
[2:07:14] impress God the impression sister your
[2:07:18] brother no no I want you to understand
[2:07:21] you have to get a relationship with your
[2:07:24] father if everybody do know certain
[2:07:26] things you don't have to do everybody
[2:07:27] with what you doing you want to do what
[2:07:29] God want you to do your sufen your
[2:07:32] father okay I want to see a Church of
[2:07:35] God in deep sincerity I want to see all
[2:07:38] fashion prayer meetings where the
[2:07:42] beginning on that one I want to see the
[2:07:46] times when they can't leave church you
[2:07:48] just see all night and pray and fast and
[2:07:50] call out until God answers instead of
[2:07:53] that it seemed like lovers Pindell away
[2:07:55] the love of God when this boy if he come
[2:07:58] up that way and did not become obedient
[2:07:59] didn't have that I like this one he did
[2:08:02] not have the action of his father did
[2:08:06] not try to courage his father's business
[2:08:07] on the way his father did then that
[2:08:10] child missed all his inheritance and
[2:08:14] another brother had to take his place
[2:08:16] well that's a big one that's a big one
[2:08:20] you could miss the inheritance and then
[2:08:22] somebody pick up just where you left off
[2:08:23] a lot of statement there's no missed
[2:08:27] opportunities you know somebody let's
[2:08:29] take up the ones you miss miss the
[2:08:35] opportunity you miss it they push you
[2:08:38] pick it up big one and run with it
[2:08:40] all right let's go so Jesus was always
[2:08:45] about the father's business doing that
[2:08:49] which was right in his sight not just
[2:08:51] about doing this and that and the church
[2:08:53] becomes to do that about the father's
[2:08:56] business I always do that which pleases
[2:08:57] my father no say and if the Pentecostals
[2:09:01] also if that child fails Gauri's run on
[2:09:03] a child
[2:09:04] son that's what we doing right he not we
[2:09:06] sometime if the pentecostal fail God
[2:09:09] raised up the stones on the Abraham what
[2:09:11] call God can call it from the Lutheran
[2:09:14] from the Baptist for the probably
[2:09:15] Presbyterian God is able of these stones
[2:09:17] or I said the Abraham somebody is going
[2:09:20] to see the vision and take it on God I
[2:09:24] hope to live to see that church when she
[2:09:27] rise in the power and the beauty of the
[2:09:29] Resurrection with the powers of God
[2:09:31] working through her signs and wonders
[2:09:33] following the believers like it did in
[2:09:35] the New Testament not sign that wonders
[2:09:38] following the pasta signs an wonders
[2:09:41] follow say it out again believers these
[2:09:47] signs shall follow them that believe and
[2:09:49] the Lord Himself went everywhere with
[2:09:52] them confirming the word so now watch
[2:10:04] when the church know then if they just
[2:10:06] didn't be how does she come and tell the
[2:10:07] father who is wonderful he is carrying
[2:10:10] out your work instructions letter by
[2:10:12] letter that's the kind of church that's
[2:10:14] the one the father says sure proud of
[2:10:16] that son you know what happens he's
[2:10:18] getting trained yet what here we go
[2:10:21] this tied into last week message yet he
[2:10:24] might not be able to exercise all
[2:10:27] authority he hasn't got it yet he is
[2:10:30] still a son but he hasn't been placed so
[2:10:34] he's working like all the other sons
[2:10:35] until God is ready at the appointed time
[2:10:39] if he's the right kind of son then God
[2:10:42] could take him aside and place him in a
[2:10:44] position of full authority Oh glory to
[2:10:47] God no God longing for that Oh
[2:10:49] hallelujah
[2:10:51] here we go are you ready if that son
[2:10:54] proven to be a right kind of a son love
[2:10:58] the father's business steered right with
[2:11:01] his instructions
[2:11:02] the father dn't on a certain day took
[2:11:05] the son out before the public stepping
[2:11:07] up on a high place clued him in a
[2:11:08] beautiful garment or what they call an
[2:11:10] adoption and positionally what he was
[2:11:13] Oh hallelujah
[2:11:14] you see Jesus had proven to God that he
[2:11:20] had been the right kind of son and God
[2:11:24] took him up on the mountain and what
[2:11:26] witnesses that's the thing that God will
[2:11:29] be to his sons here and good someday he
[2:11:31] will call you a side Church if you only
[2:11:33] obey Him and stay on the word he will
[2:11:36] please into the church before the coming
[2:11:39] of Jesus all the powers that Christ had

[2:31:51] those my son since he was born since if
[2:31:53] you see the Holy Ghost you buy my son
[2:31:55] but now I'm going to a position early
[2:31:57] placement Authority what he fires is
[2:32:00] fired or what he hires is hired when a
[2:32:10] member is born by the Holy Ghost into
[2:32:13] the family of God and has proven to have
[2:32:16] these virtues in him that God can see I
[2:32:20] want BER testified that brother I know
[2:32:23] it passed the whole Akitas life now okay

[2:32:50] member has proven that to have these
[2:32:53] virtues in him that the passer can see
[2:32:56] know that God can see virtue and
[2:32:59] knowledge and temperature and patience
[2:33:01] and brotherly kindness and Cronus on him
[2:33:04] then God seals and places him that is
[2:33:07] when you see sons and daughters of God
[2:33:10] note it does not speak about the man's
[2:33:14] office or gifts
[2:33:17] it didn't say where God can see a nice
[2:33:20] message he preached the mysteries
[2:33:22] unfolded the knowledge revealed he
[2:33:24] didn't say that when God can see these
[2:33:26] virtues he's not even talking about the
[2:33:30] revelation of the virtues we correlation
[2:33:33] are manifestations two different things
[2:33:38] do I have with this is in a house I feel
[2:33:42] empowered I feel a special anointing
[2:33:43] upon me to bring this message we're
[2:33:46] gonna finish it
[2:33:47] revelation and manifestation is not the
[2:33:49] same thing Abraham had a revision of
[2:33:53] Isaac he take 25 years in manifestation
[2:33:56] [Music]
[2:33:58] so claim in our revelation you had any
[2:34:01] tests Abram test was 25 years then he
[2:34:05] could produce Isaac and say here is what
[2:34:07] a higher or revelation all these years
[2:34:09] well random fortunes become real then
[2:34:12] you could be tested they think Gordon
[2:34:14] tests but Abraham he said to people in
[2:34:16] church to make a love in the church for
[2:34:19] Ramaswamy pulpit how are you could that
[2:34:21] be you you will happen to entrain Ayana
[2:34:27] they can fling them out poor easy boy

[2:35:10] practices son he have choices God didn't
[2:35:17] tell him do this do that no no no no no
[2:35:19] no no no no when you come to maturity
[2:35:21] God put the options on your table what

[2:37:33] things wrong - hallelujah why call just
[2:37:36] men when you could call mercy oh yeah
[2:37:38] why he wiped somebody out when they
[2:37:39] could restore him when it can restore
[2:37:41] them and bring them back when it could
[2:37:43] revive them why do that - so much power
[2:37:45] you have behind a pulpit just overpower
[2:37:47] having an elder or did know whatever why
[2:37:49] do that by Jesus to learn with his
[2:37:53] Gentiles have power over this one and
[2:37:55] for the one is I come and when he come
[2:37:56] to wash the feet on what happens don't
[2:37:58] wash my feet because they know who's to
[2:37:59] do that job that was the lowest job
[2:38:02] defeat washes to come into a hole wash
[2:38:04] your feet first where you come inside it
[2:38:06] join room Jesus bring a basin of water
[2:38:08] and say come and watch Fe know what
[2:38:10] Peter
[2:38:11] I'll get a Guinness company that was
[2:38:13] kinda Guyana not my feet when you're
[2:38:16] part with me you see what watch watch
[2:38:17] watch watch watch watch everything made
[2:38:20] me ready water
[2:38:23] competed to 1 del F del at all but my
[2:38:27] point is this
[2:38:28] Jesus shoot him 7 what a serpent is what
[2:38:32] the ministry supposed to be ok he that
[2:38:35] great among you let him sue put on a
[2:38:37] robe put on a plate come on she'll sir
[2:38:42] know these kings what a madam says it's
[2:38:47] up to me to walk on my own salvation
[2:38:48] with God until these things are proved
[2:38:51] of God then sealed into the king of God
[2:38:54] bears the Holy Spirit then you looks of
[2:38:57] God but then these things are operating
[2:39:00] in you by God then you are sealed you
[2:39:04] see by revelation you can operate it you
[2:39:06] can operate certain things somebody come
[2:39:08] in and it could be just me fussing with
[2:39:09] your wife and or not doc doc doc doc a
[2:39:11] widow
[2:39:12] bless you bless you but yes : anyways it
[2:39:15] wasn't so much blessing inside but
[2:39:18] because on who come to the door you give
[2:39:20] a different face so you work anything
[2:39:22] real nice but then when it begin to
[2:39:26] operate and you by God it's not you no
[2:39:28] more it thunders it lives itself right
[2:39:33] out because it's that you is him in you
[2:39:36] or praise the name of the Lord yet his
[2:39:39] bum until these things from ordination
[2:39:41] 1962 a scripturally prove and sealing to
[2:39:45] you as an individual then your son and
[2:39:47] daughter of God is the thing the fruits
[2:39:49] of the spirit that proves that you in
[2:39:51] God or here this one almost done he said
[2:39:55] now watch
[2:39:56] Pentecostals was born like a son but
[2:39:58] that seems someone born the family had
[2:40:00] to be adopted also that's right and
[2:40:02] there's no you missed your calling
[2:40:03] friend when the adoption time comes
[2:40:06] aha you mean is that time fact option
[2:40:09] yes when that time comes if the truth
[2:40:12] it'll raise a child from the chocolate
[2:40:13] worthy they remain a son but miss the
[2:40:16] adoption Oh hallelujah
[2:40:18] so Jesus was God example seed musicians
[2:40:23] coming please he was that example seed
[2:40:26] the works will be manifested in him the
[2:40:28] same way that seed would of God he was
[2:40:30] example seen aware the Holy Ghost came
[2:40:32] upon him it was manifested I just wanted
[2:40:35] to share with you a few thoughts
[2:40:37] scriptures to show you how much Jesus
[2:40:41] was connected to the father
[2:40:42] Booton Communion and fellowship and in
[2:40:46] release into the father this is from
[2:40:48] Saint John 5 so I wouldn't call all the
[2:40:49] scriptures a generally read on jesus
[2:40:51] answered and them said my father work
[2:40:53] here the two and I work therefore the
[2:40:55] Jews sought the more to kill him because
[2:40:56] he not only broken the Sabbath but said
[2:40:59] that God was his father making them
[2:41:02] equal with God ha I love that my father
[2:41:07] work and I work also my claim in God was
[2:41:09] his father
[2:41:10] they say you makers have echo with God
[2:41:12] and then I'm said jesus said unto them
[2:41:14] verily I say unto you the son can do
[2:41:16] nothing of himself but what do you see
[2:41:18] the father do for whatsoever things if I
[2:41:21] do it these also duet the sunlight
[2:41:24] here we go for the father loveth the son
[2:41:27] and shoot him all things that himself do
[2:41:31] it and he will show him greater works
[2:41:33] than these that you may Marvel for as
[2:41:35] the father raises up the dead and
[2:41:37] quickeneth them
[2:41:38] so the son quickeneth whom he will so he
[2:41:41] was constantly plugging in to how the
[2:41:44] father operate
[2:41:45] I am operating is right for the father
[2:41:48] judge had no man but I committed all
[2:41:50] judgment unto the son that all measured
[2:41:52] under the son even as they honor the
[2:41:53] father inherit not the son on another
[2:41:56] father which I sent him for as the
[2:41:58] father hath life in himself so what he
[2:42:00] given it to his son to have life in
[2:42:01] himself then jesus said unto them verily
[2:42:04] verily I say unto you Moses give you not
[2:42:06] that bread from heaven but my father
[2:42:08] giveth you the true bread from heaven
[2:42:10] and for the bread of God is he which
[2:42:12] cometh down from heaven which giveth
[2:42:14] life unto the world all the fire that
[2:42:16] given me shall come to me and him that
[2:42:18] coming to me I will no wise cast out he
[2:42:20] sent me he that sent me is with me and
[2:42:22] the father had not left me alone
[2:42:24] if I do those things which please him
[2:42:26] not that day you shall know I'm in the
[2:42:28] father yield me and I on you he that
[2:42:30] hath my commandment and keeping them he
[2:42:32] does not love at me and he that love me
[2:42:34] shall be loved of my father and I will
[2:42:35] love him I will manifest myself to him
[2:42:37] and Judah said unto Him not ask our Lord
[2:42:40] how is it that dog with manifest I said
[2:42:41] unto us are nothing to the world jesus
[2:42:43] answered and said to him if a man love
[2:42:45] me he will keep my words and my father
[2:42:47] will love him and we will come unto him
[2:42:49] and make our abode with him he that
[2:42:52] loveth me not keep it at my scenes and
[2:42:53] the word which he hear is not mine but
[2:42:55] the father which sent me these things
[2:42:58] have I spoken unto you that being yet
[2:43:00] present with you but the comforter which
[2:43:02] is the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[2:43:05] send in my name he shall teach you all
[2:43:07] things and bring all things to remember
[2:43:09] and oh my do you love him this morning

[2:43:24] pleased hear him is not right this is
[2:43:27] not right
[2:43:28] God was pleased to have the fullness
[2:43:30] dwell in him

[2:43:34] that in him should befall fullness 12
[2:43:37] isn't that right isaiah 53:10 God was

[2:43:57] the foolishness of preaching to save

[2:44:02] wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew
