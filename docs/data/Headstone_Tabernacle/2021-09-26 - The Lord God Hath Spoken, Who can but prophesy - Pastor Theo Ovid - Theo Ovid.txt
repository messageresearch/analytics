my human element out i made the divine element move in father this morning even the headstone the capstone the anointing the pillar of fire the amber light lord may take a hold upon my voice upon my thinking upon my thoughts i met the people here thus here the lord this morning in jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you thank you so much for being here for coming out and those who are connected god bless you praise god i trust you were blessed by the special service that on friday i feel there was it was one message that i believe was inspired and of the lord to speak to you was that message and i wanted to bring it back and uh there was no audience at that time and i really believe the lord gave the unction to release that message so this morning we want to turn to three's portion of scriptures revelation 10 we want to read from 8-11 and revelation 22 we want to read from 7 to 11 and amos chapter 3 you want to read from verse 6 to 8. oh blessed be the name of the lord all right reading from version 10 verse 8 and the voice which i heard from him speaking to me again and said go and take the little book which has opened the hand of the angel it standed upon the sea and upon the earth and i went under the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it ease it up i shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be nine monk tweeters honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand ate it up it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i'd eaten it my belly was bitter he said unto me down must prophesy again before many peoples nation tongues and kings revelation 22 i want to read from verse 7. behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the saiyans of the prophecy of this book elijah saw these things and i heard them when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel but showed me these things then said he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant and of the brethren the prophets and of them which keep the scenes of this book worship god hallelujah and he said unto me seal not the singings of the prophecy of this book for the times at hand he doesn't just let him be unjust still he did which is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still only from amos chapter 3 reading from verse 6. shall the trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in the city and the lord had not done it surely the lord god will do nothing but revealed a secret unto his servants the prophets the lion had roared who will not fear the lord god had spoken who can but prophesy let us pray one more time father we thank you lord and you know what's up in my heart and how this came and i pray a blessed interpreter to the hearts and lives of your people in jesus name i ask it amen on amen you may be seated praise god hallelujah thank you lord jesus blessed be the name of the lord glory to god hallelujah hallelujah just give him some worship and some praise hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah it's so good to feel his presence this morning praise be to jesus there's an echo we have here and in revelation 19 is the scripture here um you say right this is it from boost nine write blessed day which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sins of god and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see i'll do it if not i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy the testimony of jesus is what this period of prophecy to this morning i have a title uh the lord had the lord god had spoken who can but prophesied of a subject the bride will have thus saith the lord because he said the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and i have an inspiration the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy now you read the scripture that the time is at hand don't seals the saiyans of the prophecy of this book what makes the bible different from every other holy book it's because it's the book of prophecy this is not just a book of good behavior it show you what was what is and what is to come so this defines the scripture more than just a holy book more than just a book of ethics or behavior or attitude it's a book of prophecy hallelujah and the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of jesus because john was on the isle of pasmos for the testimony of jesus oh glory to god isn't that right no he read the scripture scene of the scene of the prophets of this book for the times at hand here is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous as me writer still here is holy letting me hold his still now regardless of what you do the clock still ticks whether you don't want to go to work whether they want to sleep where they want to do whatever the clock still ticking so this prophecy is still taken nothing stops it so there is prophesying of an hour coming where things will be set and nothing could change righteous righteous still holy holy still things move him but everything's said oh hallelujah do you believe that then he said he which is filthy let him be filthy still no you would want to think that maybe the 30 people outside and whatnot but that's not what you're talking about so that's why we need a prophet to interpret what this word really is isn't that right now who's the filthy you know who the filthy is the foolish virgins let's read it we're in the homeland the jews are in the homeland we are at the end of the age ready for the rapture the rapture comes watch the church goes up and we are caught up to meet him in the air we all know that the stone that was cut out of the mountain is ready to come at any time and when it comes what does it do it does away with the gentile age you heard me preach more than once the coming of the stone closes the gentile dispensation so when we talk about covenant with stone and dynamics and all of that you're talking about the closing of the gentile dispensation that he could go across to the jews are you with me now hallelujah watch and the stone that was cut out of the mountain is ready to come at any time and when it comes what does it do it doesn't work where the gentile is it's all over and god completely quits dealing with them let him that is filthy be filthy still let him be holy be holy still what does he do then he takes his church the holy ghost filled his church is what the holy ghost taught no the holy ghost filled holy ghost filled somebody shout out phil you have to be filled with this thing with the call the holy ghost go give the lord some praises let's continue what's the filthy the sleeping version and then that comes up for judgment way over and here we'll get back into another map when we continue to this one over when she comes up to the wide shown judgment and has to be judged by the redeemed the foolish virgin had to be judged by the redeemed you know who the redeemer is the elected the perfected the bride of jesus christ because your blood price was paid at calvary and you are redeemed you are in christ therefore god can't judge you you already judge he took your judgment already oh give the lord some praises that's why we could shout this morning that way we could praise god this morning that's why john can say all on earth all under the earth heard i john praise god saying blessing and honor mind power dominion he had a revelation that we shall reign on the earth oh glory to god the earth belongs to [Applause] redeemed oh hallelujah hallelujah who is going to be into that new city that premier city the redeemed hallelujah praise god so we he said no all right he said paul told us not to take a matter of the court because the saints were judged all right let's go now did you notice he said you you have among those or you say they are jews but you found them liars now remember the great angel what you were speaking to the last church this open door between two church ages now the first church was taught by who paul and they're going to romans 2 29 and for he is a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is of the heart and in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god what is a jew a spirit holy ghost still christian so the holy ghost christian is the real jew oh hallelujah praise god i know you were done there after an age of sanctification say they got the holy ghost but he said they said they never had the holy ghost without signs following they are a liar these signs shall follow them that believe you can't make him lie behold listen listen i will make them this is prophecy i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews they church they church folks in them you know what god called them the synagogue of satan who say they are jews which say they are spiritual christians say the synod of the organization i will make them that say they got the holy ghost and all organized up here they haven't got the revelation yet see all right them that say they are jews are christians and are not but do lie behold i will make them come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god thank you lord jesus thank you lord oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah praise god amen oh glory to god you're gonna make them bow at your feet and what he says the world will bow at the feet of men and women who cross jordan oh glory there's no person of bishop you know sons and daughters of god what are your grandchildren god have sons and daughters god have prophets after prophet praise god [Applause] oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus right here let me break in on this morning message that's the sleeping virgin right there can't you see what it was at the end time he said they are justified by faith sanctified justified true looter's message sanctified you here but missed the open door justified by faith true looter sanctified by the wesley age many of them precious nazarene pyramid holiness wesleyan methodist all of them live a good clean sanctified and think they got the holy ghost and here a fellow speak in tongues on something they laugh at him and make fun of him it's of the devil brother you seal your doom when you do that you blaspheme the holy ghost oh praise the name of the lord so the foolish version miss what the open door to get the holy ghost he said they missed the wisdom of revelation to get the spirit then hallelujah not get teachers and teaching but get the spirit behind the teachers and the teaching after you're taught you have to get the spirit of the word being taught oh give the lord a praise offering oh glory to god are we going to take some more this morning well god bless you i love you this brother man and if you i want if and if i want you to see the real i want and if you want to see real genuine gifts not impersonations if you want to see real solid christians walking so salty till the earth will be tested for them why the way people you can't go down the street and tell that they're christians anymore they all go down the street they all act the same they talk the same they crack the same jokes he said every idol word that you speak what happened because brother you were letting the devil come in and put it over your eyes then he prophesied the first thing you know the time will come when god will give a message and you'll be sealed in or out the kingdom of god what's the mark of god the seal of god and what's the mark of the beast to reject that hallelujah praise god the seal of god is what the holy ghost and the mark of the beast is what to reject that once you reject that you take on the seal of god the seal of the beating the mark of the beast and that mark sees you out the kingdom and the seal of god sees you into the kingdom and when god put you in the kingdom no devil could take you out no pastor no bishop no message pope no elder no deacon your wife can pull you out your husband can't pull you out your children can't pull you out when god has put a seal upon you glory to god hallelujah praise god hallelujah he said we need an old-fashioned gospel back in the church back to the word of god a lot of this nonsense and foolishness cut off oh my around the country the things that is done here in our country something coming here not long ago you can't even mention pentecost around our country anymore these news pentagons hallelujah first thing you know a message will come ceiling or seal out not which church you belong to yeah yeah i caught you i don't know which church who your pastor is no dynamic message the message the same either sealed in or sealed of the kingdom that's what he said press press your way the kingdom of god is what preached and every man press their way into it you have to want it you have to hunger for it you have to taste for it you have to reject church membership you don't want no church you you ain't want a church bench you don't want to be no good church member you want to be part of this bride made ready let us rejoice and be glad all glory to god hallelujah the objective the mind of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready the lord god had spoken because elias is already come he said i prophet to give you those here the lord and you're getting dusty the lord this morning oh hallelujah glory to god amen so the seal of god is the holy ghost mark of the beast's unbelief rejection foolish version and the examination of god call them filthy nice virgin you know but the holy spirit in the spirit realm call him filthy oh glory to god because then press on to the holy ghost hallelujah wait till the right turn judgment to be judged by fellow members in church who have blown bride that's something powerful church members had to be judged by fellow members who belong to the bright class hallelujah not sheep and goat class bright class the judgment coming for sheep and gold come this way come this way who judging that the bride hallelujah glory to god amen glory to god so we know that the mighty angel revelation 10 came along with a message and our message was for the bride when you open his mouth thunders through their voices out to get to the thunders the other seas had to be revealed six seas had to be revealed another the seventy was silenced and he took the tunnels on the back of the book and threw it under the silence and the devil can do nothing about it he could watch what that touch you don't know what happened in all these years but under that silence god was unveiling proving shaping molding getting the bride ready for his coming oh glory to god the lord god has spoken oh glory to god who can but prophesy and we are here to prophesy because we went to the angel and we took the book and the manifestation of the holy ghost is that angel oh give the lord a shout and from the book we can prophesy oh hallelujah has an order that's a commission god must prove his life again oh glory to god a fresh prophecy of the original prophecy oh hallelujah thank you jesus so this message was to make a bride ready prepare bride that she could be dressed in other words in the gong of his promised word could we give the lord a shout on that one how could these ministers be preaching this message and they can't quote what has been promised they can't prophesy the prophecy from the book they are their own messenger they have their own message they're on their own but the bride the spirit the bride and the prophet will say the same thing you could measure what we're saying word by word by word or give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to god how would a minister preach a message an entire message and not one promise i wasted three hours of my life listening to that because my ear is strained and built for you could say which way you want you know by listening for promise how much you're not take if it has none it's waste it wastes a time you know because only by these promises we can become partakers of his divine nature it's only by the prophecy the prophecy is when we have strength when i'm all people in moses day they heard about the deliverer coming and it's about 300 more years ago what what what what you're holding on to you're telling the son telling the next son the father telling the next son telling his grandson hold on i love you i'm almost on my way out but deliverer is coming 200 more years left father telling son son telling son ten talent grandson 40 more years left and i hear parents say one day god that can lie it's the god of abraham it's the court of life that god promised with a mighty hell he will deliver us and you see your son raised up to be 40 years old that son you're talking to and that generation here come baby moses it's the potential is prophecy in baby form it's the baby manifestation oh glory to god and one day this prophecy of the manifestation of the sons of god that the lord god has spoken it will come forth it started as a baby baby manifestation but it will come forth [Applause] glory glory glory to god i a hurry for no money no contrary manifestation i'm looking for no work up the sky toefl are real i wear too long to get full i wait too much years to get deceived i wait so long i want that reality joel prophesied that he shall come to pass afterwards i will pour out my spirit and young men chassis visions all men young men shall see vision old man who all men shall see visions young men gonna prophesy brother branham watch in the old testament he said in the new testament joy said i poured my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy now the word prophesy does not mean to teach the prophesy means to tell an experience on the inspiration or to foretell something that is fixing to take place oh glory to god for example listen to this i believe that the church of the living god is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world not trinidad the whole world the whole world is that whole corona virus shake the whole world right this is saying shake the whole world that's the first time it's been since the days of jesus nazareth to a human being act anything you will society right said the writing ask anything anything you want give me my sons he says it shall be given unto you anything you desire don't you see the words of jesus being fulfilled oh it's going to come to pass pretty soon i am looking for it to happen in this meeting oh you mean you have to come an expectation yes you mean if we have the same expectation we get the same results yes you mean people sitting down too long yes they have no expectation no but we won't have an expectation and faith give you expectation expectation give you faith or give the lord some praises i am wanting it to happen now watch watch that the teaching that the explanation no he didn't say that what does he want to happen now that the anointing shout out anointed some people don't know what that is you know they're dead so long they feel the priest behind the pulpits he is anointed that the anointing will strike the preacher no the whole church of the living god don't sit and watch me you know you better see your name inside there and start to shout because as you are talking about it's a non-destructive teacher i'm already anointed if i destroy the whole church if i'm not anointed i may as well leave the pulpit if i'm not inspired i may as well get out of here the anointing have to strike the whole church and what we have here is not even dynamics he said what we have what are you working in a small measure why the dynamics coming down do you understand what the anointing is when when samuel went and annoyed david with oil that i changed david position you know give it a few oh i feel annoyed i'll give you the troll now no he gonna see about sheep but he's anointed you have to be anointed for the job what did jesus say the spirit is upon me because he has anointed me to bring good tidings to the poor you have to find where this written to identify the spirit is upon me oh give the lord a shout and he was jesus all glory to god that same anointing have to come back upon you that you could know the spirit is upon me not looter not wesley not pentecost but the spirit itself come on now come we know what we're preaching they know intellectual pentecostal stuff no this is the word this is the message of the hour i'm wanting to happen now that the anointing will strike the whole church of the living god and she will rise to her feet so maybe we will listen that long time people are saying now in church they are moving but they say he was when bob was in the boat and nothing hit him so he stopped his feature now you've never seen already sit down she writes their feet like a mighty machinami the sick will be healed by a word that doesn't need any interpretation what what you mean by the sick anytime you know what you mean shut your mouth go away tell your story walking i don't know what you mean with that you know the sick will be healed by your word the blind will see the death will hear the dead will be raised up and the power of god will shape the world with the church of the living god we are in the process of it now i believe it's soon coming to pass and i say this morning that is thus saith the lord did you hear what i said dino fairy tale that is thus here to god oh glory to god amen hallelujah glory to god give the lord a shout hallelujah what are we on the expectation for malachi for prophecy behold i send you elijah the prophet what fought are books and tapes no that's part of it and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so we are under expectation return back to the fate and the faith bring us to ephesians and ephesians bring us the dynamics super church super race as we near the hedge toll give the lord some praises glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah revelation 10 i saw a mighty angel come come from heaven gloated with a cloud rainbow over his head having his hand a little book open and he roared like when a lion roared all gloried after the lion had roared who came but prophesied oh glory to god they must pick it up whenever the lion roar every other animal in the jungle have to shut up oh glory don't need a bride to pick up this prophecy because the seven thunders is the exclusive bright promise church member eagle near it the church members here touch it but this seventh on this prophecy going to gather the bride together gonna give the bright fate going to show the right heart repair are tired hearing that hear it again because we will prophesy again it could be the price revival what give the lord a shout i'm not tired preaching it i'm not tired hearing it because that is my prophecy that is my

turn what will change what will transform i don't know what anyone will say whether god will put worse and brought up in his mouth but i exact amount but i see it doesn't matter whose mouth could come out from but someday something going to turn something the right word could be spoken the right things go be done are we going to dash into the blessings of god i don't take service lightly oh glory to god hallelujah praise god glory to god glory to god you see what you don't know your words as identifying your bible study and your actions could affect your family your whole fall your deliverance your breakthrough inheritance your very attitude oh glory to god he likes to walk up that woman was about to make one more cake she baked me a cake first and she gotta argue and foster them she went to make a cake for him and when she turned god said dusty at the lord oh glory to god you have to have the right attitude god go match you up if you are part of this bride and you have a crazy attitude god go mash you up he go break you i ain't gonna break it i ain't gonna fight up with no flesh and blood business no no no no no no i for the kingdom thing i waited for the angels to escort me on this platform oh glory to god and bring your devils and come bring your sickness and come bring whatever and come oh give the lord a shout in the house oh god promised these things let me be seated 24th of november 1963. what shall i do with jesus call the christ buddha brown he said the book is already open that's right just waiting for the seventh seal to be identified of the coming of christ now he knew the seven sea wasn't truthful three phases thunders then he said invented unknown language and so on three steps right first step was seven dollars but he says waiting for the seventh seal to be identified in the coming of the lord now the coming of the lord is first thessalonians 4 16. the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice and with the trump and on the message the rapture just before he left it was all connected together then he said what is the shout he said that's the message of the hour the living bread so then we understood by revelation the shout is the seven thunders so then we could go back to revelation 10 and saw what the mighty angel came along with a message to gather the bride together to give the bride feet to show how to prepare to call a bride out the message is the shout out the message is the seven thunders not the seventh and there's a thing in it no it is the seven thunders and then seven thunders come from the mighty angel which is christ oh glory to god to catch a bride isn't that right oh glory to god isn't that right so it was the lord himself version 10 the living bread to gather the people together by those seven thunders so revelation 10 seven thunders the message the living bread the guy that i write together the shout the see of the lord a message of preparation danny we say the angel of the lord is unearthed now fixing things are wrong for the coming of the lord so this prophetic message of malachi 4 is a message of life l-i-f-e this l-i-f-e is what the pentecostal did not have because they couldn't have it because it's along the word end up with gifts so god sent the word in him was life and the life was the light of men and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and when the word became flesh the invisible become visible so therefore god sent a prophet with the word that when you receive the word you become the word when you receive the word that's the secret the word is in the bright the word is in you oh glory to god so the word is in you and you are crying out for something what are you crying out for second peter four two seven for fate virtue knowledge the church member not crying out for that the bride is because that's the goal of his promised word and that's the wedding garment look at the lord i showed hey hey what yes that's the wedding comment what are you talking about i'm talking about faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness bodily kindness that is the wedding comment oh glory to god and the bridegroom will come oh give the lord a shout his wife had made herself ready by putting on the gun of his promised word it is still promised that is why we prophesy we got it to get that is why we prophesy it's on its way that is why we prophesy all glory the dynamics is coming that is why we prophesy [Applause] let's continue you see why i've been so zealous of the kind of seed that i planted for the body the rain is going to fall pretty soon now i mean the real rain before you leave he said the church is not beginning to get the message he said your fate isn't ripe enough intellectually hear any message you know he put the seed out rika ready for rain i'm the pentecostals advancement because there's no god give some drying time plus 50 years and drop some lingering time and lingering you know what hypocrites pass through you know much slip and seed passed through you must crazy house and crazies pass through and nut cases and all kind of cuckoo spirits pass through that's all they do they just pass through because they shout call a mixed multitude oh glory to god but few many are chosen by the choke many are called by the shot but a few will be chosen by the next part of it which is the voice the voice of the archangel oh glory to god be coming on to the resurrection you know we coming on where we have to leave here oh glory to god do you want to be part of this bride or you want to be in a nice church i'm here specials or give the lord some shouts oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah is this shaking for you are we too rough could become a little smoother yes we'll get smooth when charity come ponder perfectness oh glory again nice bastard then oh gloria god ha sweet man hallelujah when the bond of perfectness come but right now we cut into devils yes we fight him hallelujah all kinds of demon powers we're fighting for revival we fight and let patchy we fight in backsliders people fighting the word people sitting there with unbelief oh glory to god people can't fight with me write down again fight oh glory to god pogba you've seen the wrong thing the cookie eye they seen the wrong thing he said the rain prophecy is going to fall pretty soon now i mean the real rain and it's got to have seed to fall on i hope i lived to see it he didn't live to see it he hoped to live to see it are you ready for the bomb it will be the living word as it was in the beginning and the spoken word of god have his power for it is in him in his own body working his own way and here what i want to get to in the evening time is shady light what is that gospel light what does it do the holy spirit what does it do right in the crop in the last days the holy spirit will pour out in time in the last days to bring in the latter in the real reign but first how are you going to have a rain when we are still planting the normal seeds so god wasn't one dropness of the rain in this message all them have cracked people with power god said no none for them that'll wait till the bright guy anointed first and then when i know you can drip off the bride they'll get some and they say we have it too because god has to identify the original dollar the true dollar first before they come defeat step forward don't have to give us space you know tell your true bride come forward you know then they're not informing everybody and then they come to you come back and say we have it too we need a message is that right what seed are you so it's not the unknown no it's the seed because the rain coming you see oh no we're going to a dry spell right now and try that cup's drying up and burning up and whatnot because this ptrm is is that is that dry time is it's unreal hot if you have grain you'll get right there's two weeks going here oh glory to god the sunrise you know they cook you all day you know but guess what rain coming in the sun it'll be hot all the time rain coming you could prophesy when coming you could play weatherman you could say you know incoming rain coming wouldn't have to come oh glory to god red must come hallelujah so you could prophesy but that's what the prophet did he know he brought a seed i see he's not to be just on the desk i see that to be buried you have to find people to bury that in the sea was thrown around the world and it caught you give the lord a shout if this don't make you shout this morning you're dead you're stoned dead you need resurrection you didn't find it it found you let me say it again you didn't find it it found you got through the seat around the world and it hooked your heart some fell on the wayside some fell among taunts some fell them on rocks but some fell on good ground let the good drunk shop this morning you and your host wherever you are you better shout if you're a good drunk this morning glory to god hallelujah are you ready are you ready for this prophecy but the word of god has been sown also and when not if when the spirit of god begins to fall not past the teaching not teacher teaching not a possible porcelain no when the spirit begins to fall the word of god will live in the people i can close off right here right now we could shut down service here right now when when so we have to make room for the spirit of all i can't come and beat you up here for four five hours preaching what i am the spirit i go fall on you you know how long peter's message was under their pentecost he said 15 minutes 15 minutes and the holy ghost fell at 3 000 people and then people said what shall we do to be saved fifteen minutes sermon oh glory to god hallelujah get a prophet he told me these men if they pick this up and go out with it they can make more sense to it to bring it to a place i just want a little seed then i hope they make it come to life but men make it more mysterious so mysterious yet i hear them to get the mystery but he was hoping to make these seas come to life oh glory to god in our power in these seeds it have power in the spoken word book is that power in the quotes is our power echoing what the prophet said without power in the prophecy it had power and thus here the lord oh glory the spirit is self-posed expressly through that prophet that's why i have confidence in what we are prophesying because god can't lie he said when the spirit begins to fall the same word you're fighting up with is gonna live in you i'm prophesying right now it's going to live in you oh glory to god the devil is a liar let me be seated i'll watch my time here let's get real you you called you you elected you you chose you he told peter and then point back to the face he said you have not chosen me i have chosen you and ordain you to bring forward fruit so if god chose you a rascal like you and i i slackered on you like you and i how are sinners like you and i and god chose us can god keep this word here he put the seed inside of you why are you looking at you why are you looking at your stinking rotten flesh why are you looking at your past why are you looking at your failures he wasn't looking at that when he called you he called you because he put your name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world [Music] yeah call him because he knows that he behaved good oh he'd be even good i could call him he's not sure he's working he knows he ends from the beginning that we can say before they was even born jacob by love he saw i hate and jacob is a rascal my god this place is too small for me we need a bigger church or i should say we need a bigger platform this platform too small for me before there was even born he said jacob i love he so i hate jacob below smart his mother father brother sister child he is not anybody he's a smart man because i love that man because when push come to shove he's shoving for the birthright oh glory to god you hear what i said when push come to shove jacob's shoving for the birthright he was one rascal church member but when you see he talked on birthright he said oh god is that what you're talking about my god go make peace rice callaloo cake anything to make eat that brother give me the birthright oh glory to god seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness oh glory to god seek the extra oil [Applause] where i go they don't make so much noise heaven will get a problem for you you know you'll get plenty problem in heaven you know you better get acquainted with the noise you know you should be rehearsing down here when the astronauts had to go up there they rehearsed things down here you know they got the atmosphere different in heaven have the four beasts 24 elders thousand time thousands and they had them seraphims flying day and night but holy holy lord god almighty and you're not gonna sell gosh lordy lower the temperature you're in trouble you're gonna make it there you know you will be too uncomfortable you better get comfortable this noise no noise no god wherever there is god there is noise i like this noise there is holy ghost noise yes there yesterday's victory noise when our ability shall shout for the lord had given us the victory oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah my god listen we are not here on our testimony we are not here in our righteousness we are here because of prophecy oh glory to god we are here because of prophecy the prophecies here the bride will be here glory to god the prophecy he said i'm gonna find true shepherds i'm gonna snatch them for glory to god through sheep from wonderful shepherd oh i'm gonna give them two shepherds oh god i feel inspired this morning there's a famine in the land farming farming not for books and tapes not for ministers message popes opposers and prophets no but for hearing these true word that's the famine people hearing all kind of thing the hearing vaccine the indie population they're hearing what france is doing at home actually they know who protesting who vex who said have a chipping vaccine who this and that that that message they have no holly i know people feeling safe says if i can't take it i'll take it and they will tell them you're safe lying to them normal normal normal being deceived from the only perfect normal normal normal when the baptism of the holy ghost is the seal of god and mary herself had to get it oh glory to god the brother branham said one day in an unexpected place among some colored negroes they're on the floor i can you can't forget when that colored man say have you received the holy ghost since you believe and dare among our people i got what i was looking for oh give the lord a shout and he was a prophet and he was on the floor and yeah he got the holy ghost get your little shot [Music] are you going to fight for your holy ghost your younger favorite is sexual oil oh glory to god hallelujah don't talk about deserve the holy ghost i don't want to deserve it you know come on you fighting for it wrestle with it oh glory to god when you're praying you're asking god for it he gave the holy ghost ask him i don't know what i'm saying here i'm pausing here my god so he said i want a little seed i then hope they make it come to life so when does he come to life who or what will be identified this is that that brother theo spoke of no i'm a prophet i just read for you a monastery surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealed the secrets i look like a prophet to you do make me a prophet you know i will call you a liar up front don't go there you know surely the lord god shall do nothing but he revealed the secrets to saving the prophets he ain't talking about no pastor and evangelist not he didn't talk with them them had to get it from the prophet but god talking to the prophet because the prophet is the more peace of god hallelujah so when we read this course we read it from god's mouthpiece because the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing people don't believe that you know nobody accept their lives from them preachers if they believe that they will say how come you're saying what the tips say because the spirit the prophet and the bride say the same thing and what they say already said the lord god has spoken [Applause] [Music] so that is why we have the confidence to preach what we preach oh hallelujah i can tell you this the reason the cat prophesied they never went to the angel they don't know what the book is their little book because one should eat that book you could only speak from the book oh you could eat that book and speak something different whatever you speak have to be from the book because you digest it what could come out of your belly oh glory to god have to be the book oh my hallelujah praise god my god my god talk about the bride are you ready tell you about this bride holy spirit told the prophet pick a venom right here there's a small quote here they will love him number one they pride in love not duty divided in love she loved to praise him she loved the worship stuff that gave god praise she had this kind of earthing a thing see people do that like this straight away goes i don't know who is that an emote demote seal i say there's no dumb dog in israel open your mouth and give god some praise hallelujah glory to god god to ask joe where was though whether the foundation of the earth are the mornings that sang together and the sons of god was whispering you know then the scripture like somebody else is like bible read that the song was shouting for joy you know what i see you know i'm driving up with my wife and i was thinking i see this devil love chaos and me him you know whenever you have cheers and me him he missed that you know he loved confusion buckingham disturbance he want to ruin your spirit mess up your life mess up your home he loves chaos is his thing chaos is his name how he is but but there was chaos and darkness in the beginning but god spoke and said let there be light and there was light so i missed all these scares looking i mean gross darkness covered here goes downstairs people go darkness coming over right you say rise and shine for the light has come god's always opposite to the darkness that is shining deer when people don't want press and gloom and they go comfortable we are closely dogs and they're frightened and they have more fear than faith clothes when they're doing that how are they doing that when the chinese shut jesus don't you say i always just come over here you shine shut down jesus he said my always not yet come you can't close down on me four times god had to give him permission to do that oh glory to god you mother bride i'm not here with seven thunders could shut the heavens open the heavens up you hear elijah do what unless there's no rain or two will fall till i call fire right now they still fight up a corona virus and there's a bride will have power to shut the heavens [Applause] could you imagine several bright to call for it one time barbara talked about a man a place had no rain for a long time and i hold my mind in the middle of the road frail man grey hair man he raised his hand and said lord god i serve you all these years people went for umbrella anything you know when they see that old man had a no rain coming i all sincere soul god can't out that he say if i poke if i shut up heavens if i cause plague and pestilence if i do this if i do that then he said if my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and turn from their wicked ways then they're gonna hear from heaven and i'm gonna heal their land oh glory to god some of you might be on the place right now on the disease right now their life like a blight but god said oh somebody say god said god had spoken that if you humble yourself and turn oh glory to god you're the humble first and then ten oh glory then healing gonna come blessing's gonna come you're gonna open the windows of heaven and take that blight off your life watch let's go they would love him and will have his potentials for he is their head they are his subjects subject to his head headship of christ was his notice what harmony jesus never did anything until he seen the father here's the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word she does it in his name she has thus saith the lord the church members don't have that but this bride she have the same lord then it is differentized so the holy spirit waters it until it has grown and serves its purpose they only do his will oh no one can persuade them different they have dusty as the lord or they keep still they do have a rare about every topic they don't have to talk and preach about every issue they want thus here the lord because you see god is behind dusty at the lord oh give the lord a shout like in bible study but isaac brought out oh isaiah came to hezekiah and told him your papers because the time up you're going to die and that is just hear the lord and isaiah start to walk out and isaiah walking out hezekiah turned to the wall and he said lord god i serve you all these years give me more time and god said oh glory to god god talk god come back to the prophet on his way out he says stop do the wrong go back tell ezekiah just said the lord i've given you 15 more years oh glory to god god could give you extension god could give a deliverance god can make a way where there is no way god could deliver you today deliver your family today heal you today seal you today that's the god we say [Music] why god shall talk to hezekiah any other prophet god breaking rank when is the prophet islam he talked to them and let them come and talk to the people so whenever a prophet comes time to tremble they only do his will no one can make them do otherwise listen to this song satan does make things appealing sin is appealing the enemy have to keep finding better beat he will strip off a little more do this do that and he said watch talk about woman hunting but satan keeps bringing sin in that's it but god doesn't have to do anything more to his to make it more appealing watch the only thing he has to do is just raise the standard of his own word against the enemy so when the bible said when the enemy come like a flood the spirit of god reads the standard against it what does he do he makes the word that he's already said more positive so the time is not yet so instead of you weight frustrated the anointing come this morning to make this same word more positive to you that the lord god had spoken and now you could prophesy i'm going to be free i'm going to be delivered i'm going to have a enough for revival you alone behind the property shouting i ain't shouting like that you go shout too [Applause] you could be free too when you see your enemies in the red sea why pharaoh coming for you they're coming behind near the chariots and they thought the way that god made was for them to oh glory to god the devil coming after you he feels run away slave he ain't see you sons and daughters of god he failed you want to get you back because you used to smoke drink life on equate adultery whatever but you are sons and daughters of god but the devil want to get you back he is fed up he is frustrated this morning because he could get some but not all that's why you're president this morning that will be excited about this world this morning because the lord god had spoken and we have just said the lord this morning glory to god so what god does he take the same word you're hearing the same boring word a brother said but you only predicted the same thing yeah the same thing but get more positive now you see i don't have my message i don't have my own message i don't want my own message you know how to just keep up with my one thing they have to remember what i say i remember you know i mean only 16 this happened i twentieth god happened i retired with it yet and then the first we don't need all of that he jesus christ saved me yesterday and forever i had to go last year and then 2016. you see what happens saints and this come down and you see that light and you see this and you see that i'm not here for that i have any prophecy here i want to say this this scripture is fulfilled not my thing my thing is for me oh glory to god you don't know who i met last night you know what god revealed to me i'm not telling you that that is my thing my hair my thing has to preach the word to you that you wouldn't have something happened to that man he's preaching like a madman something happened to him oh i don't know what it is but something happened to that man he come today and said the lord god hath spoken who can but prophesy he has prophesied my deliverance he has prophesied my healing he has prophesied my ceiling he has prophecy in the bright revival so i saved myself all that drama all right how about too i will stand up on my watch set me upon a tower i will watch to see what he will see unto me and what i shall answer when i am reproved and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he that run that readers it for the vision is yet for an appointed time we can lock god next to make it this time the vision is always for appointed time that's why we have to get the testimony of jesus and we have had the testimony of jesus which is the spirit of prophecy all these years we under the testimony of jesus which is the spirit of prophecy he said watch write the vision make it plain upon tables that he has run that rooted it for the vision it's yet for a point of time but at the end it shall speak and not lie do it terry that's where we are right now tyrion and when the ministers are cut upon her they're saying the lordly is coming do it terry wait for it it shall surely come oh there's a prophetic vision there's an appointed time the time of life when abraham spent all these years talking about isaac isaac isaac god came down himself to i come along to tell you there's a time of life coming and dynamics and spirit will hit you so he came down to abraham to make it more positive not to manifest like that yet he come to tell him i come to encourage your fate you're waiting 24 for some almost 25 years now i come to tell you that the promise is nigh i will return on today according to the time of life and sarah shall have that son oh glory to god sarah can laugh how much you want to laugh at her business if i said it it has to come to pass because my word shall not return unto me for it oh glory to god who want to laugh let them laugh oh glory to god praise god amen hallelujah glory thank you lord but abraham is it true that every jew born since christ will be saved who are 144 thousand are they the predestinated ones to be sealed with the holy ghost what is their mission there about three or four questions here no he said the first one is it true that every jew born since christ came to be saved no nothing would be saved only those whose names were put in the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world you are true or gentile that's so the book holds the mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it is called into his name the book doesn't say no level is to be saved in a time of church or all my never no it just shows the mystery or unfolds the mystery of what the thing is and we ourselves by faith believe it oh my god hallelujah i want to realize uh because this is coming next isaiah 28 16-22 therefore dost hear the lord god behold eileen zan for a foundation of stone a tried stone a precious corner stone short foundation either believer shall not make his judgment also relate to the to the line and righteousness to the planet and the hill shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the water shall overflow the hide in place and your covenant will death shall be disannulled and your agreement with hell shall not stand all this is prophecy this is the judgment part of this message hallelujah and and when the overflowing score shall pass through then you shall be trotted down by it from the time that it goes forth it shall take you for morning by morning shall it pass over by day and by night it shall be a vexation only to understand the report for the bed is shorter than the man can stretch himself on it that is very miserable you know you're lying on a short bit and your foot hanging out if you pull your head your head fall along this side very uncomfortable god describing the condition the bed is shorter than a man can stretch himself and the covering narrower than he can wrap himself in it and that in the armrest for they will find that the bed is too short for a man to stretch himself on and the covering too now of him to wrap himself in all the sources of confidence will fail then what a condition to be in when people begin to recognize their faith and confidence was in flesh and blood and god breaks that and now they have no confidence when their faith and confidence should have been the word because the word is god hallelujah for the lord shall rise up as in mong perism he shall be wrought as in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his act his strange act now therefore be not mockers at least your hands be made strong for i have heard from the lord god of hosts a consumption even determined upon the whole earth could i continue just halfway through but god is good first peter 4 17-18 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous case will be saved where shall the unconditional sin appear remember ezekiel 9. potamark then the suffering angels where god said the beginning of los angeles no he said bigger than my sanctuary that's what i say don't look outside look what is taking place inside look what the spirit is speaking expressly whether by pulpit whatever bible study is the spirit at work you know god trying to get something to his people don't take anything by just lightly it's god hallelujah god speaking listen he could use a donkey he could use me doesn't matter he donkey care it's what the voice speak lord god has spoken but a man i'm do you saying gonna stand outside your door and knock all the time there's a time he will get enough and turn away then you will do the knocking but you'll never find him come while there is time come while there's still a knock don't you compromise with anything less than the baptism of the holy ghost like the god of pentecost with the same type of baptism and so on oh my hallelujah praise god everyone say well this fellow died without a warning no no no god doesn't do it that way god never brings any man to his debt without first warning him about it he says that's the nature of god he wants before judging hallelujah god never ever brings judgment upon the earth without first giving the people a warning god never does nothing without declaring it first that he's going to do and it gives people a choice and you can do right or wrong oh blessed be the name of the lord do you believe that hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus no he doesn't always strike strike when he warns i want you to watch this quotation god gives a warning but he don't always strike the same time he warns did you notice that that when he doesn't strike then he sends a warning then the prophet is mocked you didn't have it you told a lie he wasn't right a prophet foresees way off the things that is coming he sees the cup of god's wrath full before it is filled he can say thus saith the lord god will destroy this city except you repent why he's an eagle he writes way in yonder he looks way off he sees the cup of iraq poured out and that's what the prophet is looking at he ain't looking what's going on here he can see the shade the world will be dark in darkness and god's darkness but he is high enough the sun is shining now but he sees the shade coming and he is saying what he's looking at he ain't here yet but he shall be here it's going to be here when he speaks of his vision whether it is rat where it is healing it may linger but it's got to come to pass if he speaks it in the name of the lord you see it might be a blessing that he speaks for you he might tell you a certain thing and you can't see it at all you say how can it be he told me dusty the lord this is going to happen that going to happen it ain't happened but the man is wrong no you'll be judged for this leaving it but it's going to happen anyhow it's got to happen do it linger yet it will speak in its season and time oh blessed be the name of the lord ezekiel chapter two we're in the home stretch and he said under me son of man stand up on your feet and i will speak unto thee and the spirit entered into me when he speak unto me and set me up on my feet and i heard him that speak unto me he said unto me son of man i send thee to the children of israel to a rebellious nation that have rebelled against me they and their fathers have transgressed against me even at this very day they are impudent children and stiff-hearted i do send it unto them and thou shall see unto them thus fear the lord god and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbid that's whether they're here they don't want to hear for their rebellious house yet shall they know they have been a prophet among them and those son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though buyers and thorns be with thee and doubt thus dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words or be dismayed at their looks do they be a rebellious house thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forbid for their most rebellious but those son of man hear what i see on today be not though rebellious like that rebellious house so he has parents on a man you know don't be rebellious like demon this is god talking to his prophet hallelujah are you with me open thy mouth and eat what i give thee glory and when i looked behold a hand was sentenced to me lo a role of a book was therein and he spread it before me and it was written within and without doesn't that sound familiar a book written written and without and therein lamentations and mourning and woe ezekiel chapter three moreover he said unto me son of man eat that they'll find this eat this rule and go and speak unto the house of israel you know what i told you somebody can eat it and speak something different you have to speak from the book so if you eat the role you have to speak from what the contents of the book he was going to speak judgment and lamentations and woes to the people and god gave him a school to eat to eat that then speak to them so i opened my mouth and it caused me to eat that rule he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill like bowls with this rule that i give thee then did i eat it it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness doesn't that sound familiar i heard a voice again say go to the angel and say give me the little book take it and eat it up it shall be my belly bitter but in my mouth it shall be sweet as honey oh glory to god and don't watch he's telling me son of man okay go get thee into the house of israel and speak with my words unto them for not center people of strange speech o had language but to the house of israel not to many people have strange speech but a higher language whose words though cancer understand surely had i sent thee to them they would have happened unto thee but the house of israel will not hack unto thee for they will not happen unto me for all the words of israel are impudent in this heart and behold i have made thy face strong against their faces and thy forehead strong against their foreheads as an adamant hardened and flint have i made thy forehead fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks though there be a rebellious house moreover he's saying to me son of man all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with an ears and go get thee to them of the captivity unto the chair of israel and speak unto them and tell them thus here the lord whether they will hear or whether we'll do not for beer whether they will hear or refuse to hear so people have to hear this word whether they hear or they don't want to hear because the bride of the preacher eternal loss that is people that cannot be saved that is after the door is shut or say this way after the book is closed this open book for the linden one day gonna be closed and there's no more names to be called everything is fixed and set like the ack when the door was shut the actors sit there nothing moving no rain falling the prophecy was still rolling it will rain the only thing happened now the door is shut so if you change your mind i said no no i already know i catch the revelation he couldn't open the door because he didn't shut it and what god what door god shot no man can open god shut the door of the ark noah himself couldn't open it for friend or family oh glory to god know some praises hallelujah let me see if i could hit the home stretch wrap up here and i believe that the age has come now the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit and power and signs and wonders this great pouring out of god's spirit in the last days that's the thing that will bring faith into the people that will take the rapture and fate people don't want to preach it they don't want to talk about this great outpouring of the spirit i'm only building you always throws at hand when you're going to see something happen when something's going to take place and all this background here has only been laying the foundation for a short quick message that will shape the whole nation not a long drawn ball message short quick message oh glory to god could i finish off here now the bride has no revival as yet there are no revival there no manifestation of god is to the bride we are looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders to wake up again oh my so let's continue here now brother branham he said the original wheat seed of pentecost was to come back in the last age it was buried at nicaea this prophet messenger of revelation 10 7 must be already in the land once more thus saith the lord must be here ready to be manifested with infallible vindication thus is the true seed already maturing and then the harvest harvest time the two vines that grew together for the past 50 plus years entwined their branches and now to be separated the fruits of those vines which were at such variants will be gutted into separate ghanas the two spirits will go to their separate destinations and when it is time to heed the final call that comes only to the wheat bride come out of her my people that should be not partakers of our sins that you receive not the plagues the great tribulation of the sixth seal matthew 24. so the plagues the tribulation sex seal that is what the foolish virgin's going to end up with but the seven seals dropped down between before the sixth seal to color the bride the lord himself descend the seventh sea with seven thunders under there they call you that's why we are privileged this morning glory to god this is the last warning he had an heir let him hear what the spirit said in churches there will be no other the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paved the gates of the gigantic poles are raised and hinged like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with a glory that is unearthly every facet of a beauty tells a story of amazing grace and jesus love she's a city prepared for prepared people she awares only for in her inhabitants and soon there will be a trunk of streets with joy yes it will be the last call the spirit will not speak at another age the ages are over thank god at this moment this age is not over he is yet crying and this cry is not only in the spiritual heirs of men by his spirit but once again a prophet is in the land once more god will reveal the truth as he did to paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of laodicea its messenger will reveal the mysteries of god as revealed to paul he will speak out and those that receive that prophet in his own name will receive the beneficial effect of that prophet's ministry until i will hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last days who are mentioned in revelation 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come yes listen to this authenticated prophet of god who appears in this last age what he says from god the bride will say oh glory to god the spirit and the prophet and the pride will be saying the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word and they're saying come out of here my people oh glory to god you shall come up please hallelujah glory i remember my last message in california where i thought i'd never go back again i predicted los angeles will go beneath the ocean thus saith the lord it will she is done she is washed she is finished well i don't know but it will be sunk oh glory to god look how many years ago he spoke dusty at the lord and the people going about their business as usual just like sodom was some kind of babies to the babysitter some going to the banks i'm going to school some taking a stroll in the park but judgment was fixed hallelujah shall i hide from abraham what i'm about to do oh my hallelujah what about the true seed it is dusty of the lord for that is what joel 2 said but be glad here and rejoice you shall know zion for i shall send among you to reign the former rain and the latter rain in the first month watch what he said migrate army he said no god is going to restore the lutheran age didn't restore the residence did not restore the pentacles did not restore god will take the church right back to pentecost of the beginning right back to what pentecost at the beginning i'm gonna close with this revelation the voice of many waters what does the waters represent version 17 the waters those sort of stickness and multitudes and people voice of many waters what is what is his voice is the judgment people do what thunders right the voice of god is the voice of judgment what makes the seed of mercy seed blood on it it's really a judgment seat god's seat is the judgment seat but only because blood is on it it's kept mercy one day the blood will remove and the same savior becomes a judge is the judgment the voice of the ministers to the holy spirit that cried out to the people in every area standing there the voice of many waters cried out thickness multitudes the voice of the seven stars to every church age preaching the baptism of the holy ghost the voice of many waters came forth from this one that looked like the son of man oh my he said the pharisees you hypocrites how can you speak good things and out of the abundance of the heart speak them out call me master and good oh what will it be on that day when that voice thunders out of many waters i want to ask you something else let me say something to you people you drifting soul
