[34:22] swear unto your fathers and thou sht
[34:25] remember all the way which the Lord thy
[34:28] God LED thee these 40 years in the
[34:31] wilderness to Humble thee and to prove
[34:34] thee to know what was in thine heart
[34:37] whether thou wouldest keep his
[34:38] Commandments or no and he humbled thee
[34:41] and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee
[34:45] with manner which thou knewest not
[34:47] neither did thy fathers know that he
[34:50] might make thee know that man do not
[34:53] live by bread only but by every word
[34:57] that was seed out of the mouth of the
[34:59] Lord do man
[35:02] live from Isaiah
[35:04] 55 reading from verse
[35:08] six seek the Lord while he may be found
[35:11] call upon him while he is near let the
[35:14] wicked forsake his way and the

[35:26] for he will this is a big deal tonight
[35:29] abundantly pardon for your my thoughts
[35:32] are not your thoughts neither are your
[35:34] ways my ways sayth the Lord for as the
[35:37] heavens higher than the earth so are my
[35:39] ways higher than your ways and my
[35:42] thoughts higher than your thoughts for
[35:44] as the rain cometh down and the snow
[35:46] from heaven and return it not thither
[35:49] but water the Earth and make it to bring
[35:52] forth and Bud that it may give bread
[35:55] give seed to the sewer and bread to the
[35:57] eater so shall my word be that goeth
[36:01] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[36:05] return unto me void but it shall
[36:08] accomplish that which I please and it
[36:11] shall prosper in the things where to I
[36:15] sent it and John last scripture 6
[36:19] reading from verse
[36:21] 57 Jesus
[36:24] speaking as the living father
[36:29] had sent me and I live by the father so
[36:33] he that eateth me even he shall live by
[36:36] me this is that bread which came down
[36:41] from heaven not as your fathers did
[36:43] Manner and a dead he that eateth of this
[36:47] bread shall live
[36:49] forever these things said he in the
[36:51] synagogue as he taught in Capernaum and
[36:55] many therefore of the disciples when
[36:56] they heard this said this is an hard
[36:59] saying who can hear it when Jesus knew
[37:02] in himself that his disciples murmured
[37:05] at it he said unto them do this offend
[37:09] you what and if he shall see the son of
[37:13] man Ascend up where he was before it is
[37:17] the spirit that Quicken the flesh
[37:20] profited nothing the words that I speak
[37:23] unto you they are spirit and their life
[37:26] let's go ahead father we thank you for
[37:28] your word tonight and I pray that your
[37:30] word will go out with power and heal the
[37:32] people those that are here that need a
[37:34] touch from you and those that are
[37:36] connected online in Jesus name we ask it
[37:39] amen and amen praise the Lord amen you
[37:42] may be seated blessed be the name of the
[37:44] Lord hallelujah
[37:47] hallelujah and I have a title and the
[37:50] title is my word that goeth forth out of
[37:53] my mouth this is what God Said the word
[37:56] that goes out of his mouth mouth that he
[37:58] might make thee know that man do not
[38:01] live by bread alone but by every word
[38:03] that proceed out of the mouth of God so
[38:06] shall my word be that go forth out of my
[38:08] mouth it shall not return unto me void
[38:12] and here we hear Jesus saying it is the
[38:15] spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[38:18] profited nothing the words that I speak
[38:21] unto you their spirit and their
[38:25] life he not talking about from rates and
[38:29] Plato and Buddha and man's word and
[38:33] philosopher's word that is not spirit
[38:35] and life he's talking about words from
[38:39] his mouth when it come out his mouth
[38:42] that makes a huge difference we read a
[38:45] scripture on Sunday for what man knowe
[38:48] the things of a man see the spirit of
[38:50] man which is in him even so the things
[38:53] of God knoweth no man but the spirit of
[38:56] God and he talk about the things that we
[38:59] speak with not with words of man's
[39:01] Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[39:04] teacheth so they are Holy Ghost words or
[39:08] spirit-given words or Spirit spoken
[39:11] words but the natural man receive not
[39:14] the things of the spirit of God but they
[39:16] are foolishness unto him neither can he
[39:19] know them because they are spiritually
[39:21] discerned praise God Amen you love him
[39:24] tonight oh praise God so I had this
[39:26] thing written here that your your your
[39:29] life is not a permanent thing your life
[39:32] is not a permanent thing your managing
[39:36] or management is only for a season you
[39:38] are not the owner God is the auor of
[39:43] Life the day of accountability is coming
[39:46] no had 120 years Jesus had 33 and a half
[39:50] years but AB BR had 56 years the
[39:53] question is are you Faithful are you
[39:55] faithful to the one who has called you
[39:57] you elected you predestinated you praise
[40:01] God because he find is rude it's
[40:03] disrespectful it's adulterous to be
[40:05] unfaithful to him because he brought you
[40:08] out he delivered you people is not right
[40:11] he tell them if if you do this I'll
[40:13] bless you and you blessed going out
[40:15] bless coming in I bless your feel I
[40:16] bless your flock I bless your I'll bless
[40:18] I bless I bless and after that he say if
[40:20] your ha fail to do it I will curse you I
[40:23] will shut the heavens over you things
[40:24] will not work I will shut the door in
[40:26] your face say God has sa bless them
[40:29] isn't that right for what obeying his
[40:31] word he said your thoughts are not my
[40:33] thoughts so when you come to church you
[40:35] come to get God thoughts on the matter
[40:38] not your feeling because your feeling
[40:40] have no application in the spiritual
[40:42] realm Hallelujah let me repeat that your
[40:45] feelings have no application whatsoever
[40:47] in the spiritual realm the currency of
[40:50] God is Faith that's what God here not
[40:52] tears not your feeling emotional and you
[40:54] hurt that that have nothing to do with
[40:56] God the only thing God recognizes is
[40:59] faith faith speaks back to him isn't
[41:01] that right and brother and the Bible
[41:03] said anybody that's trying for the
[41:05] Mastery but be temperate in all things
[41:07] or discipline so Mastery is adding to
[41:10] your gift and talent not just relying on
[41:13] the gift and talent some people are
[41:15] gifted talent talent to sing to preach
[41:16] whatever exalt whatever and and music
[41:19] and whatnot and they just stick right
[41:21] there with the gift that God give them
[41:22] nothing added to it but we talking about
[41:24] Mastery now that it have mechanic and it
[41:26] have massive mechanic it have engineers
[41:28] and master Engineers it have doctors and
[41:30] man it have specialized doctors why they
[41:33] get into Mastery have teachers they just
[41:35] getting a pay every month but have real
[41:37] teachers that want to see the teachers
[41:39] see the children bear fruit and learn we
[41:42] talk about striving for the Mastery
[41:44] striving for excellence and that's what
[41:45] God want us to be he's not satisfied
[41:48] that you give him back what you give you
[41:50] he say you're slothful servant a lazy
[41:52] servant come on now multiply what God
[41:54] give you act to your faith virtue
[41:57] multiply what your God don't expect you
[41:59] to you to show him what you give him
[42:01] Lord you give me this all these years
[42:02] and that no no no no no you got to do
[42:04] better than that isn't that right so
[42:06] good stewardship involves risk
[42:08] excellence and hard work stop living as
[42:11] if you have Surplus
[42:14] time that's a big one by punch stop
[42:18] living as if you are Surplus time what
[42:20] you could do today do today don't put
[42:23] off for tomorrow what you can do today
[42:25] because you don't know what's going to
[42:26] happen
[42:29] tomorrow a lot of people in that Los
[42:31] Angeles Fire they never thought that the
[42:33] whole place was burn down
[42:35] flat they never imagine that I saw old
[42:38] man crying he said he has lost
[42:42] everything is that your testimony lost
[42:46] everything
[42:51] wow some of them will get out of Los
[42:53] Angeles you because that going down into
[42:56] the sea
[42:58] there's preparation or know if they
[42:59] think this is bad and this has already
[43:01] crossed a100 billion dollar worth of
[43:03] damage the worst disaster out and it's
[43:06] like a
[43:07] Inferno it's the
[43:09] fire Hallelujah so God making a way for
[43:13] the next part because we know the next
[43:15] part is said to go down into the
[43:17] ocean that will be a whole different
[43:19] thing Al together stop living as if you
[43:21] have Surplus time you don't own that you
[43:25] don't control that it's un
[43:28] loone to you how are you using it
[43:33] treating it managing it what I'm talking
[43:36] about your time we give the Lord some
[43:41] Praises I'm happy to be here tonight
[43:44] something is riding me here
[43:47] tonight all right second Peter 2 and
[43:50] there will false prophets also among the
[43:52] people even as there will be shall be
[43:54] false teachers among you amen this is
[43:56] prophecy
[43:57] who priv shall bring in damnable
[44:00] heresies men opening the Bible and
[44:03] preaching
[44:05] false it's a spirit on them it's a
[44:08] spirit in them even denying the Lord
[44:11] that brought them and bring them upon
[44:13] themselves Swift destruction but many
[44:15] shall follow their pernicious Ways by
[44:18] reason of whom the way of truth shall be
[44:20] evil spoken of and through covetousness
[44:24] shall they with fake words make
[44:27] merchandise of you whose judgment now of
[44:30] a long time linger not and their
[44:33] damnation Slumber not quickly just a few
[44:36] and we'll get down to something 1
[44:38] Timothy 4 1 and two now the spirit
[44:42] speaketh
[44:43] expressly prophecy that in the latter
[44:46] times some shall depart from the fith
[44:50] now what what did the prophet come to do
[44:51] restore our hearts back to the Fai of
[44:54] the fathers in other words bring back
[44:56] the open book the open word being
[44:58] revealed and unfolded some will depart
[45:01] from the faith giving heed to seducing
[45:04] spirits and doctrines of devils these
[45:06] devils not working in the carnal B this
[45:09] is Pulpit Devils this is church Devils
[45:13] this is Devils upon men ministers
[45:15] pastors so-called Apostles prophets and
[45:20] teachers are you still with me speaking
[45:23] lies in hypocrisy have a conscience SE
[45:27] with a hot iron I didn't say that the
[45:29] Bible said that men with no conscience
[45:33] behind his death behind the
[45:36] pulpit 2 Corinthians 11:13 says for such
[45:39] are false Apostles deceitful workers
[45:43] transforming themselves into Apostles of
[45:45] Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself
[45:48] is transformed into an angel of Light
[45:51] therefore it is no great thing if his
[45:53] ministers also be transformed as
[45:55] Ministers of righteousness whose end
[45:57] shall be according to their works oh I
[46:00] didn't know Satan have ministers that's
[46:01] just read out to you he has ministers
[46:04] could somebody say Amen I'm not talking
[46:06] from newspaper and I'm reading from the
[46:07] Bible Satan have his ministers they're
[46:10] preaching Bible they're preaching
[46:12] scriptures with deception and and what
[46:14] kind a spirit and I'm saying that to get
[46:16] to something we going to get there
[46:18] Matthew 24112 many false prophet shall
[46:20] arise Jesus speaking and shall deceive
[46:22] many and because of iniquity shall
[46:25] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[46:29] Matthew 24:24 there shall arise false
[46:31] Christ and false prophets they shall
[46:33] show signs and wonders in so much if it
[46:36] were possible they shall deceive the
[46:37] very elect behold I have told you so so
[46:41] Jesus was making it quite clear is not a
[46:43] smooth sailing Everybody is one big
[46:45] family are we going down to the rapture
[46:47] we going to the resurrection no it's not
[46:48] that it's the devil laying snears and
[46:51] traps Hallelujah and our false teachers
[46:55] and false Revelation that people going
[46:57] to
[46:58] follow the prophet now
[47:00] speaks he said Christ not Christ uh not
[47:04] Christ but Christ plural not singular
[47:07] Christ mean the anointed otherwise you
[47:09] want to break it down so we'll
[47:11] understand it the word Christ means
[47:12] anointed false prophets it means
[47:15] anointed one one with a message and the
[47:18] only way the message can be brought out
[47:21] is by one that's anointed and that will
[47:23] be a prophet anointed there shall arise
[47:26] false teaching false anointed false
[47:29] teachings that what his message is
[47:31] Anointed teachers but anointed people
[47:35] with false teaching anointed ones
[47:38] there's a singular Christ but there will
[47:40] be many false anointed ones and their
[47:44] prophecy of what they were teaching
[47:47] would be the difference because they are
[47:50] anointed then he drop into this what is
[47:52] faith faith is something that revealed
[47:54] to you that is not yet but you believe
[47:57] it will be faith is a revelation of the
[47:59] will of God watch watch this I like that
[48:02] in other words he put Faith as an action
[48:05] not Faith as knowledge information but
[48:07] Faith as a revelation of the will
[48:09] because once Revelation hit you it puts
[48:11] you into action when when Revelation hit
[48:13] Abraham it put him to prepare for Isaac
[48:16] coming you understand I'm saying then
[48:18] when Faith hit Jacob he know he going to
[48:20] wrestle with the angel Hallelujah
[48:22] because Faith struck him he had to go
[48:24] back to his land and when he get fear as
[48:26] he near the land and he near his brother
[48:30] he start to get fearful then he decide
[48:32] to do something send his some I'm some
[48:35] here some here and then he was all alone
[48:37] Faith make him hold on to the angel I
[48:39] say I will not let you go till you bless
[48:41] me in other words Jacob wasn't saying
[48:44] it's business as usual okay the Lord
[48:46] some Praises so Faith does put something
[48:50] in your spirit something in your soul
[48:52] something to inspire you that raises you
[48:55] above your condition you're not here
[48:57] looking for God to pity you you're
[48:58] looking here for the word to give you
[49:00] Faith because Faith come by hearing and
[49:02] hearing by the word of God and when
[49:04] faith is apply you get a result you got
[49:07] a
[49:10] response the churches today don't
[49:12] believe in spiritual
[49:14] Revelation they believe in dogmatic
[49:17] teaching of some system now these words
[49:20] are important be dogmatic teachings
[49:23] means you have to believe it so if you
[49:25] don't believe it so you're out of
[49:31] it Matthew 7 says beware of false
[49:34] prophets which come to you in sheep
[49:37] clothing that that's the clothes alone
[49:40] but inwardly they are ravening wolves ye
[49:43] shall know them by their
[49:46] fruits Hallelujah but notice now it's
[49:50] what they produce that tell you the
[49:52] difference by their fruit man does not
[49:55] gather grapes off a tisle even though
[49:57] the T may be right in the grap Vine he
[49:59] said what is the fruit the word or the
[50:05] fruit for the season what is it their
[50:09] teaching the teaching of what the
[50:12] teaching of the Season what time is it
[50:15] man's Doctrine denominational Doctrine
[50:20] now God didn't send a last day Prophet
[50:23] for us to be right in our spirit and
[50:25] wrong in Doctrine
[50:27] no we have to be right in spirit and
[50:30] right in Doctrine because he brought the
[50:33] full interpretation or the full
[50:35] revelation of Jesus Christ nothing to be
[50:38] added nothing to be taken away it was
[50:41] the complete Revelation because man
[50:44] shall not live by bread alone but by
[50:46] every word that proceed out of the mouth
[50:48] of God and God's mouth is His prophets
[50:52] he sent Moses he sent Elijah he sent
[50:54] Isaiah he sent William Bram I send you
[50:57] Legend Prophet the if what the words
[50:59] that was coming out of his mouth was
[51:01] God's word hallelujah that word cannot
[51:05] fall to the ground because God himself
[51:07] said my word shall not return unto me
[51:10] void but it shall accomplish in other
[51:14] words the intent of the word what the
[51:16] word is to do it shall do because it's
[51:18] my word it's not man's word I am not a
[51:21] man that would lie Hallelujah words have
[51:25] to come out my mouth
[51:27] oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God
[51:30] do you get it now words must come out
[51:32] the mouth of God because when Jesus was
[51:35] in his temptation and Jesus said Satan
[51:38] come and tell him turn these Stone into
[51:40] bread because you know Jesus hungry you
[51:42] telling because you full you know that
[51:44] devil not
[51:45] stupid Jesus is hungry and he tell the
[51:49] devil if thou be turn the stone into
[51:52] bread this the Temptation is Right Rich
[51:54] you know it's right there you ready to
[51:56] eat and Jesus pressed through and said
[51:59] man shall not let by bread alone but by
[52:03] every word that proceed out of the mouth
[52:05] of God Satan dropped down in a certain
[52:07] gear now he he changed gears he start to
[52:10] go in the scriptures now he said okay
[52:12] Jesus the scriptures say if you shall
[52:15] jump down now that is scripture he's
[52:17] quoting it is the word he is quoting but
[52:20] that he is quoting but that is not the
[52:22] amount of
[52:25] God the qu what Satan is quoting is not
[52:29] God's mouth he is quoting a text that he
[52:33] read and he's trying to get Jesus to
[52:36] invig him to make a
[52:39] jump to show off to display power to
[52:44] listen to him
[52:46] amen now if Jesus did it and even is he
[52:49] listen to Satan you know it's not God
[52:52] telling that you know but yet it is
[52:55] scripture and Jesus brst him and say
[52:57] it's also written don't come with that
[53:00] don't try that so the bride will always
[53:03] have it is also written don't come with
[53:05] that don't try that Hallelujah hear a
[53:08] little dear little word on top of word
[53:11] on top of word and when you add all that
[53:13] word it has to be the statue of a
[53:15] perfect man oh give the Lord some
[53:18] Praises hallelujah
[53:20] hallelujah so now you could understand
[53:23] Jesus speaking in Matthew 15:9 but in
[53:27] vain they do worship me teaching for
[53:31] doctrines the Commandments of men oh
[53:35] praise the name of the Lord remember
[53:37] what we said on
[53:39] Sunday at the junction of each age when
[53:43] time runs out man ability
[53:48] Fades we read a scripture where God said
[53:52] the riches of people wouldn't even help
[53:54] them at that
[53:55] time so so the fire in Los
[53:58] Angeles all the money somebody homes is
[54:00] $20

[55:18] of the shaken but something going to B
[55:20] the shaking and either a part of the
[55:23] Shaker or part of the shaking but things
[55:25] are going to get rough things going to
[55:27] shake that amen hallelujah praise God
[55:31] Amen Jeremiah 175 big scripture thus
[55:35] sayith the Lord curse be the man that
[55:39] trusteth in
[55:42] man and maketh flesh's
[55:44] arm and whose dep heart departed from
[55:47] the
[55:48] Lord years ago Tech and science was just
[55:52] a a sidh show they make a phone they
[55:55] make a this because remember long time P
[55:58] beep and be have a p is a big
[56:04] thing you you think people are pan
[56:08] now so what has happened is this man has
[56:11] gone so far in achievement science that
[56:14] men trust them men trus in AI now
[56:18] artificial in the trust what they really
[56:20] want to bring is God to them you know
[56:22] yes their kind of God a God that they
[56:24] make that they could check they could
[56:27] rely and Trust the intelligence of man
[56:33] human but the Bible said Jeremiah 17:5
[56:36] thus sayth the Lord cursed be the man
[56:40] that trusted in man and make it flesh's
[56:43] arm whose heart depart from the Lord so
[56:46] Friends The Challenge is the
[56:48] heart it's a heart issue and something
[56:51] struck me the doctrines has become idols
[56:57] so what the churches have is Idol
[57:00] worshippers that is why they they they
[57:03] are bound in the church and some of
[57:06] those men are Witch Doctors because
[57:08] they're casting
[57:10] spells that's why Paul said who had
[57:12] Bewitched you you Galatians who had be
[57:17] Bewitched you to go into legalism to
[57:20] think that your behavior will justify
[57:23] who you are in that by your lord and by
[57:26] your rituals amen oh give the Lord some
[57:31] Praises amen amen so I have here written
[57:35] the devil is not intimidated by six
[57:36] SEALS or by six seal ministers who
[57:39] preach this message under the anointing
[57:41] of loose ends what intimidates the devil
[57:45] is the seventh seal because he don't
[57:47] know what it
[57:48] is the seven seal is a seal of life the
[57:52] life of
[57:53] Elohim seven perfect spirits
[57:56] that connects with the coming of the
[57:58] Lord there has to be something that the
[58:00] devil couldn't touch denominate or
[58:04] impersonate and the only thing he cannot
[58:07] impersonate is the
[58:08] life the life itself he could pretend to
[58:12] be a preacher he could be a pre pretend
[58:14] church and imperson whatever but he
[58:16] cannot pretend to be the life the life
[58:19] will speak for itself Oh Glory to God
[58:23] notice what Harmony Jesus never did
[58:25] anything until the of the father so will
[58:28] be the bride he shows her his Word of
[58:31] Life she receives it she never doubts it

[1:01:24] still
[1:01:27] no one can persuade them otherwise they
[1:01:29] have thust say the Lord the Bri will
[1:01:30] have thust say the Lord amen okay let's
[1:01:34] go Jesus was God made flesh dwelt Among
[1:01:39] Us the word made flesh he was the
[1:01:42] body and in that body come water the
[1:01:46] spirit so we are Washed by the Water of
[1:01:48] the word and then went in him dwelt in
[1:01:52] him and there come the life of God
[1:01:56] manifesting himself through Christ so
[1:01:59] God was in Christ the anointed one
[1:02:01] Christ means the anointed one a man that
[1:02:04] was
[1:02:05] Anointed God dwelling in him what was it
[1:02:09] the germ with the
[1:02:11] flesh the anointed
[1:02:14] one
[1:02:16] flesh being
[1:02:18] Anointed with the spirit of God produce
[1:02:22] the word of God made manifest so God is
[1:02:26] invisible until it become flesh the word
[1:02:29] that is so when the word becomes flesh
[1:02:32] all of a sudden you see something
[1:02:35] manifested because it's not the man it's
[1:02:38] the word made flesh it's the word The
[1:02:41] Germ activated in the man so Jesus from
[1:02:45] 12 to 30 years of Silence doing nothing
[1:02:48] he just in the scriptures when his time
[1:02:51] came he got baptized fire hit him John

[1:03:18] for three steps it is written it is
[1:03:21] written it is also written and the Bible
[1:03:24] said he returned in the power of the
[1:03:27] spirit he had the power and God take it
[1:03:30] off of him to face the

[1:17:31] something remember the seed is only
[1:17:33] bringing forth new life when it die it
[1:17:36] takes pain distress discomfort that's
[1:17:39] why I said to you Sunday I'm not here to
[1:17:41] make it comfortable and are people
[1:17:42] that's why they want to hear certain
[1:17:44] gospel and they will go by the ministers
[1:17:46] and pastors who preaching what they want
[1:17:48] to hear and the pastors are politicians
[1:17:50] that what is lie and just tell the
[1:17:53] people what you people want to hear for
[1:17:54] the votes
[1:17:55] but we are not here to get votes we're
[1:17:57] here to be popular we're here to tell

[1:18:13] the prophet and the bride say the same
[1:18:17] thing so how come Minister preaching for
[1:18:18] 4 hours and they saying nothing but the
[1:18:20] spirit right
[1:18:22] say they killing the people
[1:18:25] with their own interpretation they kill
[1:18:27] the people putting Idols in their heart
[1:18:30] because when they push them Revelations
[1:18:31] so the people see them big never a man

[1:18:37] the hour he's the fivefold ministry good

[1:30:07] old system and claim this but the old
[1:30:10] system must die and rot in order to
[1:30:14] bring forth a new one Hallelujah he said
[1:30:18] this here now I'm going to skip them
[1:30:19] quickly Hallelujah systems does not have
[1:30:23] life
[1:30:24] oh word Believers give to my message
[1:30:28] hear me not my message but his message
[1:30:30] that he firmly declares to be the truth
[1:30:32] you've got to choose him somewhere you
[1:30:34] can't sit still after this the Bible
[1:30:37] said his wife had made ready to become
[1:30:40] his wife what does she what kind of
[1:30:42] garment she had on his own word she was
[1:30:44] dressed up in his righteousness the
[1:30:47] churches they build so much systems
[1:30:50] around the word until he shook her off
[1:30:53] her rocker when she came she had bird
[1:30:54] pains what was it here we go back to the
[1:30:57] word back to the life systems doesn't
[1:31:01] have a
[1:31:02] life that's why church scrumble it's
[1:31:05] built around a man when a man die or or
[1:31:07] something happen everything fall apart
[1:31:10] because built as a system it doesn't not
[1:31:13] built correctly system doesn't have a
[1:31:15] life it's only God's word has life the
[1:31:19] systems are built around it where it
[1:31:22] does not have life it's the word that
[1:31:24] have life oh praise God and this is what
[1:31:26] I want to get to Hallelujah praise God
[1:31:29] he said talking about Book of Revelation
[1:31:32] 19 and this angel of Light remember the
[1:31:34] that last Angel the last angel came to
[1:31:36] bring light saying what calling him out
[1:31:38] of Babylon caught up in the CH in in in
[1:31:41] in the cage watch this now the church
[1:31:43] had rejected Christ and Christ is the
[1:31:45] word watch that had been rejected and
[1:31:48] this Angel's message messenger come from
[1:31:51] God was echoing his message on the Earth
[1:31:54] to come out of Babylon come out of the
[1:31:56] organization here we go this the part I
[1:31:58] want to get to the Holy Spirit today the
[1:32:01] manifestation of the holy spirit is that
[1:32:04] angel trying to get the people back to
[1:32:07] the word here's why because the holy
[1:32:10] spirit will only vindicate the word what
[1:32:13] word the word from the mouth of
[1:32:17] God that word will be
[1:32:20] Vindicated Hallelujah the holy spirit
[1:32:23] will only indicate the word holy spirit
[1:32:25] is not going to V
[1:32:26] churches we believe this it has to be
[1:32:30] the word do you get it and the word is
[1:32:33] not partial now every man is subject to
[1:32:36] the word watch this Messenger on Earth
[1:32:40] was so inclined to God that when he
[1:32:42] spoke on Earth God echoed the same thing
[1:32:45] from heaven so when a man claim yeah we
[1:32:48] go this is big when a man claim he hear
[1:32:51] from Heaven he had to Echo the same
[1:32:54] thing that this Prophet spoke because
[1:32:57] what the prophet spoke echoed in heaven
[1:32:59] so when Heaven dropped down a revelation
[1:33:01] it has to compare oh give the Lord some
[1:33:05] Praises let me say that
[1:33:07] again that word saying again the
[1:33:10] messenger on the Earth was so inclined
[1:33:14] to God that when he spoke on Earth God
[1:33:18] echoed the same thing out of Heaven what
[1:33:21] is the fourth verse translation what the
[1:33:23] it means God's voice speaking to his
[1:33:26] predestinated people so anytime the
[1:33:29] voice of God drops down from heaven to
[1:33:31] you anyone it will Echo the same thing
[1:33:35] that this Prophet was inclined because
[1:33:37] he was the seventh Messenger to the
[1:33:39] seventh age the final age and even
[1:33:42] though he's not here the word prophecy
[1:33:44] was given for the entire age oh give the
[1:33:47] Lord some Praises Hallelujah God took
[1:33:49] the prophet 1965 but the prophecy is for
[1:33:52] the entire age amen
[1:33:55] because he caught the mind of God for
[1:33:58] the age and put it on books and tapes
[1:34:00] that's what we preaching tonight oh
[1:34:02] blessed be the name of the Lord do you
[1:34:04] believe that tonight Hallelujah and the
[1:34:06] voice said and I took the book of The
[1:34:08] Angel's hand go and and and and the
[1:34:10] voice tell John which give me a little
[1:34:12] book take it eat it up and he said unto
[1:34:14] me thou must prophesy again before many
[1:34:17] people's nation and Tong that mean the
[1:34:19] bride will have the testimony of Jesus
[1:34:21] the bride will have the spirit of
[1:34:22] Prophecy but brandham he said he sending
[1:34:25] a Vindicated prophet he sending the
[1:34:27] prophet after almost 2,000 years he's
[1:34:29] sending someone who is far from
[1:34:31] organization and as John the Baptist
[1:34:33] Elijah old he will hear only from God he
[1:34:36] will have dust say at the Lord and speak
[1:34:38] for God he will be God's
[1:34:41] mouthpiece he as it is declared in
[1:34:43] Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the
[1:34:45] children back to the fathers he will
[1:34:47] bring back the elect of the last day and
[1:34:49] they will hear a Vindicated Prophet not
[1:34:53] no Vindicated man in Trinidad and man in
[1:34:55] Europe and a man every way and who
[1:34:56] Vindicated it and who want to correct
[1:34:58] the prophet and who want to say better
[1:34:59] than the prophet them is Liars them is
[1:35:01] just m Champions and so on it's one
[1:35:03] voice it's one messenger it's Seven
[1:35:05] Stars not 24 stars and one from Trinidad
[1:35:08] it don't have that it's seven stars that
[1:35:09] was in his right hand and William Mariam
[1:35:11] brandham was one of them Stars oh give
[1:35:13] the Lord some Praises that star still
[1:35:15] Shining Light that star still reflecting
[1:35:18] light go give the Lord a shout let's go
[1:35:21] he will bring back the elect of the last
[1:35:23] day and will hear a Vindicated Prophet
[1:35:25] give the exact truth as it word with
[1:35:27] Paul he will restore the truth as they
[1:35:29] had it here we go are you ready and
[1:35:32] those elect with him in that day will be
[1:35:35] the ones who truly manifest the Lord and
[1:35:38] be his body and be his voice and perform
[1:35:41] his works oh glory to God the church can
[1:35:45] no longer speak for God they could no
[1:35:47] longer speak for God then God sent
[1:35:49] Wesley he was the voice for that day the
[1:35:51] people took the Revelation become the
[1:35:52] word Methodist fail the now we say yes
[1:35:55] sir the church now now is no longer the
[1:35:57] mouthpiece of God it is its own
[1:36:01] mouthpiece they speak the Revelation and
[1:36:03] like salt and pepper and like tomato
[1:36:06] ketchup they sprinkle a little message
[1:36:07] on it a little brother brown on it just
[1:36:10] to make it look like it's messy you know
[1:36:11] what I
[1:36:12] mean sometime you shake her empty and
[1:36:14] all
[1:36:18] sprinkle so really and truly they have
[1:36:20] their own message as I told the
[1:36:22] ministers I said I ain't coming to this
[1:36:24] message for men to tell me their
[1:36:26] Revelation I'm not interested sorry I F
[1:36:29] that a long time I want to hear what
[1:36:31] this Prophet say I want to hear this
[1:36:34] word this is why I stayed with all these
[1:36:35] years I move from it from 1975 to now I
[1:36:38] want us I want this this is what God
[1:36:40] revealed to me to stay with this and it
[1:36:43] will be Vindicated I know this word we

[1:36:48] Vindicated God can't lie hallelujah
[1:36:52] hallelujah all right here what he say
[1:36:54] now the mus come please the church is no
[1:36:57] longer the mouthpiece of God it is his
[1:36:59] own mouthpiece so God is turning on her
[1:37:02] he will confound her to the prophet and
[1:37:04] the bride are you ready for the voice of
[1:37:07] God will be in
[1:37:09] her you know the some of the books Mark
[1:37:12] the voice of
