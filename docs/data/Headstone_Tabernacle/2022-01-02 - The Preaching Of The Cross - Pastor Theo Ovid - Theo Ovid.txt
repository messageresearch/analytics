your own way this morning in jason we ask it amen we want to avoid a prayer for the kangaroo family they come up with a virus and i want to pray for them and i guess there may be others that we may not know us yet so we just want to pray that god mercy will extend to his people let's pray father god we pray jesus that your holy spirit will visit the kangaroo family george and his wife rosemary and the children and stephen and his wife all of them father god made a holy ghost overshadowing them and making a complete deliverance on this virus and any others that may be in the church that we might be aware of may have visited with your mercy and your grace oh god is that covers the earth father and gross darkness cover the people but the promised light to shine in our pathway father may you shine when virtue may find in power may assign a supernatural strength granted lord in jesus may ask it amen and amen god bless you thanks for coming out praise god so if you have your bibles i'd like to turn to two portions of scripture first corinthians chapter one and we want to read from 17 to 29 and also luke chapter 9 we want to read from verse 23 oh praise the lord thank you jesus and this is paul speaking from first corinthians chapter 1 verse 17. for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel so paul is defining his calling baptism is part of the course requirement and by the way we have to service today we have four young people i believe they're going to be baptized in jesus name we have thank the lord for that so you say first time for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words least the cross of christ should be made of non-effect for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to understanding nothing understanding i will bring to understanding i i will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent where is the wise where is the sky where is the disputer of this world had not god made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the jews require a sign in the greek seeker after wisdom but we preach christ christ is crucified unto the jews a stumbling block unto the greeks foolishness but under them which are called and both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god is wiser than men the weakness of god is stronger than men for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god had chosen the foolishness of the world to confront the wise god had chosen the weak things of the world to confront the things which are mighty the bastions of the world and the things which are despised had god chosen ye and things which are not to bring to naught things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence hallelujah that no flesh should glory in his presence i don't want to turn to luke chapter 9 and you want to read verse 23 jesus and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me let's pray one more time father we thank you for your scriptures and your word and i pray that this be an anchor point for this year this service lord may be a turning point in lives of many here and those who connected to us in jesus and we ask it amen our name and god bless you may be seated we thank god for it being 20 22. oh blessed be the name of the lord so today i have a title the preaching of the cross that's the title i have the preaching of the cross i have an inspiration wearing his garment of sacrifice and debt to the things of the of this world that's the inspiration wearing his garment of sacrifice and debt to the things of this world with this virus affecting and infecting individuals around the world we can see that everything is being shaped reshaped or being fixed for the coming of the lord it's like the whole world system is being recalibrated for the coming of the lord and the prophet said the angel of the lord is on it now fixing things around for the coming of the lord is as if everything is being recalibrated a recalibration is to correct or to adjust the gradations or settings on a measuring instrument or sensor or other pieces of precision equipment recalibrate means to re-examine one's thinking a plan a system of values and correct it in accordance to new understanding or purpose this is amen so this is what recalibration is and you know the bible says except god cut the day short no flesh shall be saved so he has to cut the day short for the electic the discussion for who the elect so this world is being recalibrated for armageddon for the third world war for the great tribulation for the great earthquake and the rapture oh glory to god and only the holy ghost-filled bride goes in the rapture the rest have to contend with the great tribulation the great earthquake the third world war armageddon that's what the rest have to contend with but only the holy ghost phil bride goes in the rapture so press on brethren to receive the holy ghost the holy ghost itself what god expects what god require the measuring line that god alone could set and he has said that oh blessed be the name of the lord now the preaching of the cross as we titled it is very unique and distinctive to the apostle paul he of all persons keep hitting this thing called the cross and we don't hear much about it now but it's still there in the world isn't that right this was the gospel he preached that christ died for our sins and rose from the dead from all for our salvation and even when jesus peter on the day of pentecost they're going to preach they say what shall we do to be saved after jesus peter was explaining to them this man jesus that they have crucified with wicked hands god had raised from the dead so this gospel of the cross is a very powerful thing that we have to understand why this thing called the cross and you know people like to talk about how the prophet said there they crucified him the effect of the word and if guys this cross we're talking about is a distant foreign it is not this cross is why we are here today because the cross answered the sin question and that is still the question today the sin question i'm not talking about sin is doing bad things i'm talking about sin and unbelief and what god have said so you are challenged to come out of sin or come out of unbelief to believe exactly what god have said there's going to be a rapture god said so there's going to be revival god said so you are gonna be delivered god said so you're gonna be filled with the holy ghost god said so you're gonna be healed god said so you have to believe what god said not your feelings not your emotions not what somebody tell you you have to believe what god said oh glory to god hallelujah praise god blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god like somebody said something to me i think i said it before you have a legal issue you go to a lawyer you believe what a lawyer said isn't that right hallelujah you want to build a house you go to architect is that the expert in it no when you're when you know about sickness and disease they're not going to the doctor they go to the internet seek another advice but if you want to know what has happened in the world today you go to the word you don't go to no praise god because this gospel is foolishness to them that perish the preaching of the cross is foolishness to them that perish so don't let no perishing person advise you oh give the lord i shall hear what i said don't let no perishing person advise you glory to god but to us who believe it's the power of god all glory is the word of god it's god himself hallelujah praise god praise god first corinthians 15 hear our apostle paul like that our apostle paul who's age messenger moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preach unto you which also you have received and wherein you stand by which also you are saved if you keep in memory what i preach unto you unless you are believed in vain for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also receive that christ died for our sins according to the scripture and that he was buried that he rose again on the third day according to the scripture so this was paul gospel so when you're here i preach what paul preached we got to know what paul preached paul preached a cross the old rugged cross so stained with blood so divine have a wondrous attraction for me i will cherish that all rugged cross i will cling to that old rugged cross oh glory to god i would stay at the cross at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burdens of my heart roll away it was there by faith i received my sight oh glory to god where at the cross glory the god no arts bishop no pope no message pope no pastor no eventually have no cross let me pay no price they are sinners just like all of us believing for god for god's mercy and grace in his very hour as we say the same god that put man in power to stick man out of power same god the same god promised to bring them over the mighty and the same god judge them and they perish in the wilderness same god not a different god just a god we serve he's a god to keep his word whatever he says he's a god that keeps his word he must keep his word to you or do you believe that today hallelujah hallelujah let's go back again the scripture we read first corinthians 1 21 said for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel how how not with the wisdom of words please the cross of christ should be made of non-effect hallelujah and is he amplified and we're going to read an amplified here for christ the messiah set me up not to baptize but to evangelize by preaching the glad tizen the gospel and that not with verbal eloquence at least the cross of christ shall be deprived of force and emptied of its power and rendered vein fruitless void of value and of no effect oh glory to god this cross have to have an effect in your life before you condemn somebody look at the cross before you accuse somebody look at that cross before you hold your arse and grudge you look at that cross he pardoning you why you can't pardon others he forgives you why you can't forgive others he'd drop your hearts and drop your charges against you while you can't drop it against others come on now pump with me right right this morning we in the gospel there's the gospel that paul preached a gospel of repentance of gospel of making things right you can't sit down here angry and you're mean like the devil with your husband you're mean like the devil with your wife you're mean like the devil with your brothers and sisters and you can't make things right this is not it if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins come on now peace back to me he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness oh glory to god give the lord a shout in the house your glory look what you don't want to be under second timothy heavy and high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god you want to be under second peter one 1 4-7 oh glory to god without faith that is peace and forgiveness [Applause] glory to god hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] let's continue verse 18 number five for the story and message of the cross is sheer absurdity and folly to those who are perishing and on their way to perdition when the person on the way to hell you know them two dimensions here we have it like a hole in place and from here you have two places to go in two directions you know i had the reasons of the blessed originally lost you'd have no paradise you know as in the catholic church you had a good day to get that but in god's word we're in a holding day and it's either going up or down have no in-between you know think about it now we have no eye contact don't have an act you don't have that you know god don't know what he's doing no god don't know his word you know god doesn't know who that man is you know he is going to respect our persons you know look at the lord i shout you hear what i said you have no respect to our persons you know he'll respect your gray hair how long in the message how long you're in church when the mighty angel when that death angel was about to pass the slaughtering angels and the incorn writer was your about to ride they say start at my sanctuary and begin at the ancient men who were before the house oh give the lord a shout this is not drawing no message you know this is the word of the lord hear ye the word of the lord yeah yeah [Applause] you may be seated don't take god for granted don't take his word for granted you know many people do like that man i tell people long time appreciate if you want to be friends with god stay off the stream don't go and just sit down on your own and that you're doing like you used to go to that is what the devil told eve you shall be like god hallelujah there was a wait for further revelation how to multiply and replenish the earth and the devil coming and bringing that away sex come inside idea because they were supposed to speak the word and the son just like adam was supposed to be created that's when jesus come the first gospel was you must be born again because something had to hit you not you stop smoking stop drinking something had to happen on the inside you've got to get an experience with this god we talking about oh glory to god moses couldn't do it with all his intellectual understanding until that pillar of fire come on mount sinai and when that fire hit them so he was a changed man they said where are you going going down to egypt with what with the word he had spirit and he had word all the time you only had word but now we have the spirit with him now oh glory to god when god come and baptize you he might baptize you this morning he might baptize you today i am talking about the promise of god brother theo didn't make this promise brother oh they didn't make this promise god make this promise you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you we in year 2022 are many enemy coming like a flood the spirit of god raises standard against the enemy don't look at me like if we in 2021 win a new year win a new season the preaching of the cross is the preaching of the blood that's the preaching of the spirit [Applause] for the story and the message of the cross they share absurdity and folly to those who are persian and on their way to perdition but to us who are being saved it is the manifestation of the power of god for it is written i will baffle and render useless and destroy the learning of the land and the philosophy of the philosophers and the cleverness of the clever and the resentment of the diseasing i will frustrate and nullify them and bring them to nothing i the lord had spoken it oh glory to god he will bring to nothing the understanding of the wise and the learning that's why peter was ignorant and unlearned but the whole world had to take note that they had been with jesus that's why people could say silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give it unto thee okay the lord i shout i know there's a power coming oh they're going to anoint the church and the people only be anointed and they will speak the world they're gonna flash like lightning nobody gonna stop it no man can't start it and when it starts no man could stop it i see a stone cut out without the hands of man glory look good that stone is coming it's coming you better be positioned to receive it or it will crush you it will break you they could destroy you it will match you up but it's coming [Applause] we continue where is the wise the philosopher where is the scribe the scholar where is the investigator the logician and the debater the other people love to be beaten never give a division they can bring a debating contest they love to argue the spirit on them google shut them up no argument oh hallelujah the place the prophecy to shut the motor the critics and for the multiplication will be shut you have to be doing something for them to criticize oh glory help me jesus do you understand what i'm saying for the amount to be shot you have to be on a road where you look this for that fault that fault that fall let them check your faults while i'm checking the force you you checking the oil you're putting in your lamp get me all in my lamp hit me burning get me all in my lamp let him check your faults and you keep pointing out here checking you keep watching me i'm watching him oh glory to god keep watching me oh let your eyes be on me that's your business oh glory to god you will see the fulfillment of scriptures in my life could you give the lord some praises go tell them watch let them watch what is somebody watching you know yeah yeah because out of your mouth will have these words come on one day this day come on say this day this day this scripture is fulfilled your scripture gonna be fulfilled you are scriptures to fulfill you know oh give the lord i shall hear not rumbling don't you know you have scriptures to fulfill the devil didn't give you them scriptures it's god himself come on give the lord a shout i want to hear you open your mouth and give god some praises this morning [Music] [Applause] if god is finished with you yet nothing can harm you untouch you you know because your scriptures are fulfilled you know they try to grab jesus you know what jesus tell them my always not yet come you can't touch me don't touch me my always that yet come and when this time come he said my always come that the son of man be glorified oh glory to god when is our come they all come judas anointed to betray him with 30 pieces of silver little money a little money sell out jesus or give the lord a praise offering oh glory to god hallelujah but jesus knew where he was going he know where the three wise men bought gold frankincense and myrrh it was gordon's service to die you know his destination you know his purpose he knew his purpose i knew he was heading along to calvary along the way he fed the five thousand along the way he took five loads and two fishes and multiplied along the way he turned water into wine along the way he raised the dead along the way he cast out devils along the way healed the sick but he had a destination to get to the cross because the cross will do something for you and the cross must do something for him look at the lord and shout now we're getting excited you didn't think about that right [Applause] the cross wasn't only to do something for you and us and sin the cross was to do something for jesus it was to give jesus access to the book of names that was sealed since it slipped out the hands of adam all the names of the sons of god that was sealed in that book and the mighty angel said who is where they're to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and the only way it could be done no glory to god the only way it could be done is by the cross through the cross at calvary that is where you pay the price to access the book to call your name and if you never shouted before this ought to give you a shout in your soul [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] where is the investigator the logic under the data of this person time and age has not god shown up the nonsense and the folly of this world's wisdom for when the world with all his earthly wisdom failed to perceive and recognize and know god by means of his own philosophy god in his wisdom was pleased through the foolishness of preaching salvation procured by christ and to be had through him to save those who believe who clung and who trusted him we lied to him for the jews they manually asked for signs and miracles and the greek pursue philosophy and wisdom but we preach christ the messiah crucified preaching which to the jews is a scandal an offensive stumbling block that springs a snail trap unto the gentiles it is absurd and utterly unfair on philosophical nonsense but to those who are called whether jew and gent or gentile christ is the power of god and the wisdom of god oh glory to god this is because the foolish thing that has its source in god is wiser than men and the weak things that springs from god is stronger than men for simply consider your own call brethren that many of you were considered to be wise according to human estimates and standards not many influential and powerful not many of high noble birth no for god selected deliberately choose what in the world is foolish to put the wise to shame and what the world calls weak to put the strong to shame and god also selected deliberately chose what in the world is low-born and insignificant and branded and treated with contempt even the things that are nothing that he might be posed and bring to nothing the things that are so that no mortal man should have pretense for glory and boast in the presence of god oh but it is from him that you have your life in christ jesus whom god had made our wisdom from god revealed to us as knowledge and so on like that as is written let him who boasts oh glory god and proudly rejoice rejoice and glory boasts in the glory in the lord so our bow is supposed to be in the cross not how the church is and not how this is and we have the best pastor and we have the best church and best this no no that's not my foolishness god doing condemn things your books have to be in the cross who appointed the individual to the cross who's the first person that did that the first person that did that saint john 12 speaking but the greeks came to jesus and he said and there were greeks among them i came to worship at the feast the same came to philip which is of bethesda fellow commentary andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus and jesus answered so them say they come to this disciple and say so so we will see jesus we want to get into we want to talk to him we want to see him and jesus answered them saying they always come that the son of man should be glorified jesus already informed that them two guys already want to see him right this is jesus response verily verily i said to you except the corner will fall into the ground and die to abide alone but if it dies bring it forth much fruit amen do you know what jesus did right he is the one that pointed them to the cross he is yeah he can say i am jesus look me here where do you want to know hello brethren god bless you god bless you no you say you want to see me go to calvary you want to see me die you want to see me go to the cross that is what he did there a true disciple would take you into his presence those disciples didn't call him assad and said let me show you my revelation you know i dreamed last night no he did this happens then go there when he they asked to see jesus they brought him straight into christ's presence all right now listen to this now you see he pointed them here to his presence christ pointed them to the truth he said how to see him was to go to the cross there is ways at the cross except economic falls that dies and buys alone and it will bring forth abundance if it falls into the ground first it has to be a germanized green you take a wheat how could one grain or wheat here what happens one grain falls in bring forth 100 greens 100 grain falls in bring forth a thousand green a thousand green falls in bring forth a million greens what he meant is this if i live my life alone and die this way i just live my life alone well there'll be no fruit after me but if i fall into the ground this is christ now under the will of god i'll bring forth a new birth and in that new birth it will bring forth another new birth and another new birth until the whole world will be missionary the gospel preached this gospel will be preached in all the will for witness and then the end shall come so this cross and this debt and this going on to the ground was actually to produce the new birth because that is what it's about the evidence that christ has risen it's good to say he died and he rose again but where's the evidence the evidence has to be a new bit or a new life not your natural birth not what your five cents is feeding on t and t smell touch and whatnot that is the contact here the faith that god put in your soul in your heart is the contact above oh glory to god so god wants to baptize you into that faith into that power into that presence that give you a dual position then you're accessing natural and accessing the spirit source accessing god hallelujah amen so that if we know ourselves in our ministry in our thoughts and in our life if we are biters we are we can do no good we have got to die at the altar now you see what i preach in here and when you say amen and punctuate everything we say here once is the word come and say amen hallelujah when you say die say amen to that because you have to unless you prepare for the armageddon tribulation great earthquake hallelujah if you want to prepare for that you know what i say amen you could keep continuously but if you want to make it a rapture you have to say amen to this because this is the process to get to there oh glory to god amen do you believe that now if we if we are bad as we are we can do no good we have got to die at the altar or we will live alone we will lift to some denomination or some creed we lifted some organization there's a lot of people tied to the church tied to the group they can't go nowhere else some of them pin them home they can't go to another church because they see down that whatever church they're going to he dies heaven so if they have to go back they gotta go right back to him and that's a life on a picture head direct from hell someone believed in marriage to the pastor could you imagine that and i'll tell you all the time i have one wife her name is admiral i could name her for you i don't have many many wives situations are my wife sorry that is not what i preached that's not the gospel that i preaching i preach on the cross you have to die to yourself my god i always believe to blast the word and see who

oh glory i am a man of unclean lips you see yourself by that presence so glory to god [Applause] that's why i'm coming real to you oh glory to god before you pick on somebody else pick on you before you see somebody else find the faults and you clean your own eye out clean your own hat out [Music] you're rough preacher you're rough smooth not helping if we do the same thing that we always do we will get the same results you know do you understand that if you approach things the same way all the time you can get the same results you know to get different results like i'm not they're going to hold you looking for somebody to get it again you're getting nothing you're digging it again just going deeper in but at least dig somewhere else you're looking for something you dig dig dig in get it at least dig somewhere else but you dig having supposed to dig here how long ago did you dig six feet down afterwards you gotta bury yourself inside of that at least do something different and this is what i'm here to challenge you to think differently to approach life differently let 21 die with your phrase your faults your failures your mistakes your horrible behavior let it die say satan you ain't catching me this year oh glory to god i'm going to be a new creature in christ i got my own revival oh give the lord a shout my god [Music] listen if we ourselves in our ministry in our thoughts in our life if we are bad as we are we can do no good we have got to also die at the also who is talking about ministry ourselves church everybody so so ministers not uh exempt from this word ministers rather die that means the biggest the death penalty big out for the man that means they want to die first some minister don't they didn't know what that channel didn't know what you only got over them people taught in the bible call them as man of god they're trying to re-establish the priesthood avid on my nose here he said when when in our mind they're dying nothing up there they're just dead sometimes the dead people know that they're when christ died something happened you know he's the only man that happened to him the sun refused to shine veil every temperament from the top to the bottom all kinds of things had to happen in our graves had a shake god this man died oh glory to god when that veil ran from the top of the bottom god exposed the whole priesthood thing god killed that god did that right there and give direct access to whosoever will oh oh god help me this morning you hear that so when them watching christ listen christ monk on the mountain mon calvary the cross is there the solar said truly this is the son of god and thunders and lightning and darkness and so on like that but in the temple nice far from there you know veil rent nobody knows system come from the god make sure it come from the top to the bottom they know it wasn't man do that so god doing something symbolic that veil represent most holy place that they'll represent holy priests high priest going in once a year that they'll represent where god was dwelling behind in patchaka skin for hundreds of years that veil is where the cornerstone of their religion was at and god rip it down because he was no longer dear lord give the lord a shout his spirit was about to be released at calvary at the cross oh that's why paul could preach the cross the way he did because the spirit was going to be released all glory to god and giving access to jew or gentiles [Applause] listen listen guys when peter went to columbia's house and because god sent a vision to peter to go to cornelia's house and while peterson respected where the holy ghost fell that shock peter god didn't tell peter what he was gonna do but the holy ghost fell he said wait a minute this is not a jew thing no no it's not a shooting it's jew and gentile the holy ghost fell on pete on cornelius be it done unto me oh glory to god while period speak these words that gentile heart was ready and he had baptized yet that gentile heart was ready he was a forgiving person he was a person giving thanks given praise he was a worshiper he was a prayer warrior he had a sincere heart and he had come to church once yet but he was ready when the word began to go forth the spirit of god pick up the word out of the mouth of peter oh who was an angel of god who glory to god and the spirit baptized cornelius and he's the same yesterday and forever oh glory to god there'll be one more ride there'll be one more ride out of the mouth of men holy coast go glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so if you want to see him listen we must realize that we have got to die in order to bring forth new life so he said much in this if you want to see me you must die die to yourself and you bring forth new life and if you want to see him if you ever expect to see him you will never see him by joining a church or some book of laws that you keep or some creed that you serve you will see him when you die why it is that the ministers are lying to the people when you believe what they teach that you're going to live that's the new boot that's why paul said have you received since you believe paul asked a question that's part of what paul preached have you received the holy ghost and you believe because the spirit was not yet given when christ did not die has that had not yet died they had to wait for the titular dying for the spirit to be released christ told them if i don't go the comforter will not come so he knew he was with them but his spirits have to come in them so having him with them as a comforter oh god jesus look at jesus that can work that way tell peter get behind me satan that can't work because he was with them for a purpose he was with them to introduce them to promises as he was on his way to the cross to pay the price and make this thing available to them because it has to be made available to us you cannot pick it up yourself you are not worthy you can't take the book you can access the power somebody that access it so when christ access it he drop it in the hands of a 20th century prophet behold i sent you elijah the prophet revelation 10 7 william branham was there to cut the open book and the words of the book he put on books and tapes and that's how you come you come because you are part of the words on the book your name is on that book and as the minister get the book and keep the book he himself hallelujah begin to call names whoever he serves recalling names are you hearing your name this morning every service you are hearing something speaking to your heart you can't explain it but something is speaking to you god is speaking to you oh glory to god all that because of the cross so before when you come to calvary and are crucified to yourself then you will see jesus you would see him before he said anything jesus he pointed them to the place to find him like all gentiles or all people you find jesus at the cross when you crucified him today we try to find him in everything we try to find him at his building which i find him in nomination we try to find him by saying agreed we try to find him by keeping season days by obeying certain rituals but you cannot find him until you come to calvary there is where we are crucified fallen dust of the earth and die to ourselves and then reborn again then we find jesus when they come from that experience the first thing you see in your heart is humility you cannot come up from the presence of god and be proud and arrogant it's a humiliating thing glory to god the first thing when moses hid that presence oh god tell me this take off the shoes off your feet that grounds you on his holy ground like not you i put them grunge they you and make them wrong i am on this ground it's holy grounds you have to come according to what i want oh glory to god take off your shoes you create an atmosphere and think about that holy ground that atmosphere coming into the house coming into your home coming into your heart coming to your life oh glory to god so you saw peter was he was sanctified the throne of god was in peter's heart and anna sapphira coming to the church lion and the light of the holy ghost oh glory to god you see what was in peter's life oh glory to god i rested to the garden of eden the tree of life was inside of peter paul was inside a peter angelic hosts escorts all around peter when peter walked in just walking oh glory to god hallelujah cassie with the naked eye and when you walk the angel of the lord and camp around thought that for him oh glory to god they are dear oh god they brought you to church this morning no accident nothing couldn't stop you from coming to church this morning oh glory to god because you are here to be recharged you are here to get that unction for your soul you are here to get anointed oh glory to god you're here here to get revelation oh glory to god you are here to be stricken in the inner man that's what they're here for oh glory to god this is the bread this will give you a chance for the entire week oh glory to god and when you study the word and listen to the word you keep recharging your battery you put in extra oil oh give the lord a shout when you get that word is oil god to turn the word into spirit because the word and spirit is one oh glory to god do you hear me this morning hallelujah hallelujah glory to god disciples today they aren't bringing the people to christ to bring themselves themselves their ministries their influence oh my a real true disciple would bring you right straight to the presence of christ and from there christ would show you what to do so right now ministers tell you what to do and show them what they do but if you're coming to the presence of christ he will show you calvary brother christ brought them to the cross and when you get that really cyber will point you to christ christ will bring you to the cross where you are crucified with him and his eternal life and your life meet together your life dies and you take on his eternal life so when here's his life in your life come together your life died and you find yourself working with his own life oh my same outside house you have you know but a new inside man probably call it the inner man that they call it the new man it's an inner man it's a new man hallelujah praise god praise god christ himself pointed people to his debt except for corner we'd fallen wrong about it alone how different it is sir but your life and his life find each other not at the church here we go not in a building not in a creed not in good works but in the cross where you are crucified with him that is where you find christ you refine him by doing better by turning a new page starting a new life you don't find christ you find christ only in debt not in a manger not in a confession not to believe a certain creed and fable you don't find christ there that's why all the people that believe all what they believe over the years they find itself still lacking christ still lacking forgiveness and grace and love and forgiveness and balls of compassion and mercy is still empty the head full but the heart empty it is so sad because 40 plus years oh hallelujah hallelujah and as we grow in god we're supposed to get more gracious more humble when barbara met the bull he had carry on with the bull he said bull i'm sorry i disturbed you he was talking to the bull and the bull was understanding the language that was being spoken because that was a language of love oh glory not fear because love and fear can't work together perfect love cast out fear god allow him to forget his gun at the at the gate or whatever and he said if he had the gun he shoot the bull he's a man had the ground quick crack bam bam and pay for the bull but he forgot the gun god allow him to forget the gun so that he will deal with it head-on no he's a killer bull you don't get that title if you had killed before you know i'm saying that he's not that brick football a brick hand bull a bull that's kind of greasy it's a killer bull hallelujah it's killable we're talking about and he have to talk to that bull because he sees adam back and he ate again and i had power over dominion over every creeping thing everything upon the earth so i don't have to come back you have to see that we have to see that reflection to know this thing is back on the earth she's a bull i don't mean to disturb you i'm a servant of god i won't tell you both don't like you're not hearing that you're doing that hearing and again you buy an attack to run you get you rolling up he first gets second guy he's getting ready to run to do his thing that's his thing that's his grounds brahma apologized

back and lie down screech breasts break your breaks too fresh breaks turn around go back and lie down oh glory to god then he could come with a testimony listen to what happened to me saints i was walking through one day and here come a killer pull i forget my gun but something came over me don't forget that something you know you're the one challenging bullet oh that's something you know he says something came over him you have to have that something oh give the lord a shout that's something that is the thing we're talking about that's something oh glory to god hallelujah our man could be adopted oh that's something hallelujah you see you see um he said well you see but abram we learn it through the art of the bible no we don't if we learn it to the art of the bible then why didn't the pharisees have it it isn't linked to the art of the bible because we have got too much we have got too many artists trying to paint it the bible is right but god is the artist the artist painted and said that jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh my so what does depression of the cross bring what does the preaching because listen to what barack said here the preaching of the cross brings observation it brings troubles it brings stills up and we can't expect to be immune from all those things oh my where would you find true fellowship under the blood you say if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin why we don't have fellowship because of sin you mean in the message yes you can't get finished with that brother with that church and think because in sin because if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and then the blood of jesus cleanses us us us all of us is the same blood is one blood the blood for you is the blood for me it cleanse us and if it cleanses us we can have fellowship one with another only if we come under the blood or give the lord a shout and under the blood is where you find the spirit when i see the blood i'm going to pass over you because the blood stood as a token but now is the spirit as the token so you find the spirit under the blood you feel the spirit this morning in the church because we preach in blood oh give the lord a shout and where the spirit is you must know there is liberto there is liberty oh give the lord a shout where the spirit is there is [Applause] the spirit is there is liberty hallelujah hallelujah when christ was coming any donkey them guys that little bitty you know you know when king's coming the red carpet they started to take palm branches and drop it and they say oh king comet the barbie saw king come lowly humble oh meek and lowly everybody taking weaknesses weakness see jesus and a donkey coming down and the people chewing jump back hosanna and the pharisees say tell them stop that tell them stop that they're making too much a noise they're giving too much of worship just say if they don't cry the rocks will cry out and he continues to donkey oh god weakness is not weakness what give the lord i shout all them soldiers toward their great power with their swords and their spears had calvary at the cross and look at jesus in his weakness look at jesus in meekness but he was conquering the world he was conquering the horse of hell he was conquering down below and he was saying dear my god why has thought forsaken me and everybody thought he was so weak and he was dying but when he died he rose from the dead went down the hill went down to the grave went down and wrote the door open and let captivity captive and lose those believers and lose those saints or give the lord a shout and that same jesus going to loose you from your condition he's going to loose you from your bondage and lose your family too or give the lord some praises oh glory to god you and your house will get delivered you want your house to get free [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if the rapture was based upon forgiveness you see most people going to the i'm making a point you know i want to make a point if the rapture was based upon forgiveness just that virtue alone your goose cook holding your oats your ghost coke your bong directed by direct chain like a ticket to the jubilation hold that when you hold your horse you have a ticket to this revelation god put brotherly kindness in this age i just love him for that he put it right on the holy spirit and holy spirit is the oil for you to access brotherly kindness you cannot access it outside of coming true [Applause] you cannot accept access holy spirit except it comes through the blood of brotherly kindness he set it up he put a layer of public kindness you're one holy spirit and you ever order against brother of it your ghouls cook because i have no ought against anybody i will bust you but i love you too i will bless you but i have love for you i will tell you the truth because only the truth goes senior set you free you say i'll train hands like another old talk i'm not giving you no old talk i ain't talking no thing in that thing i tell you what the thing is i'll tell you the thing you need to hear the thing you need to know it's rough it's rugged but it's the truth and jesus said i love that jesus said you shall know the truth and the truth is what gonna set you free if i can't be honest with you i can't be honest with god oh give the lord a shout i have to be honest with you oh give the lord a praise hallelujah god only accepts a man through shed blood the only place of fellowship i i yeah i can have fellowship but he because he ability is saving i believe there's a pharisee and i said you see and i'm intellectuals talking there when jesus called disciples it's not it's not that's peter have a young people hey gang let me let's go no jesus said peter come john come he do the calling and whether they do like one another that another issue got to shake one of the hands and they had problems until the holy ghost game that issues think about it now who is greater than who who are more racial who they want to stop this brother outside because they brought enough with them and they're jealous but i'm saying jealousy taking them in a brother doing signs and wonders and not with them i said shall we stop him and next time he said shall we call him for fire like elijah did you say you do not know what spirit you have in other words trouble you know i they have nothing to do they feel an idol they want to call on fire they want to burn somebody them need burning heaven or snake inside the hat you know fire fire hit them yet you know it's just the anointing upon them and they're feeling so powerful jesus you know hey they were jesus jesus stop never preaching he said look that's it i said no no no wait wait wait until you perform a time this is a new season this is resurrection power now he is privately telling them no more preaching you you can't do this next phase you need power to go further so wait until you be doing power from one eye oh blessed be the name of the lord let's let's continue all right home shots you know i have to only halfway through wow the only place of fellowship the only way across the chasm is is not true religious organization not you either it's not true towers not true holy places not true cities not through anything else but the shed blood that's the only way back the preaching of the cross although as it despised as it is is god's provided way for sinners to come and fellowship with god or with each other we talk about sinners in this message what is being crucified with christ galatians says paul says but god forbid that i should glory saving the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me this paul and i unto the world galatians 2 20 paul said i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the fate of the son of god so god didn't allow any boasting in the flesh boasting in ministry boasting in money boasting in wealth and car boasting in house god didn't allow that he was glory in it in the cross isn't that right so this what is crucified with christ by the brown to be crucified with christ are you ready is to live for others then he qualified what kind of others those who hate you those who wouldn't like you somebody make a sweet bread for you and you you'll like them back and make us feel bad for them die i mean that's give each other sweet bread that's a sweet bread competition this crucifixion is when you could love somebody or treat somebody nice and right to hate you not this idea this life and hate is not the same thing hate is bad you know who all right those who wouldn't like you those who will make fun of you live for them be with them love them pray for those who despisefully use you and say all man of evil falsely for my name's sake i thought this brother branham the message would probably help the church this morning that you would see that we need a calvary we need a crucifixion no crucifixion no resurrection you want a resurrection but you have a good crucifixion isn't that right hallelujah philippians 3 18 for many walk of whom i have told you often and i'll tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ so paul was the man that's rocking this whole cross gospel he saw people who was the enemies of the cross because the cross takes away legalism the cross takes away what you can do and you see what christ has done and you accept the provision that christ did at calvary and then you are redeemed and then you are free and then you are forgiven and then you are cleansed because you accept his partner in grace oh my hallelujah first corinthians 1 23 but we but we preached christ crucified unto the jews of stumbling block unto greece the greeks foolishes how many homesteads the preaching of the cross is about sacrifice sacrifice of blood or blood and sacrifice the old testament was about the same the death of an innocent lamb it was the same in the garden of eden abel offered unto god a better sacrifice so this word sacrifice has always been dear even from the very beginning when god asked those two boys king and abel to bring an offering one brought fruits and flowers and whatever and i brought what a lamb that was killed and that blood was evidence the lamb died it was a sacrifice the blood price this currency of blood was to pay for sin to deal with the sin issue because this is our issue it's still an issue because that is how we were born in sin and see it in iniquity he wasn't born holy he wasn't born righteous he wasn't born a christian you were born in sin and the bible said there is none righteous no not one so a price had to be paid to address that issue oh glory and cancel that issue of sin isn't that right amen so paul himself reveal a mystery how the jews and gentiles will get together by the cross through the blood ephesians 2 12 he said here and that he might reconcile both unto god watch it and he is our peace verse 14 who had made both one and had broken down the middle wall a petition between us having abolished in his flesh jesus having abolished where in his flesh the enmity even the law of the commandments continually ordinance contained in ordinances for to make in himself a one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile brought unto god in one body so this was the mystery what paul was revealing here how true the one body of christ both jew and gentile going to be reconciled watch watch and that he might be reconciled brought unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity nearby oh blessed be the name of the lord and through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father and therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners so in other words all the time you talk about jews and gentiles he's now talking and preaching you are no longer strangers or foreigners praise god but fellow citizens with the saints and the household of god that are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in galatians 3 he said it this way that there is neither jew nor greek there is neither born or free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus according to the promise oh glory to god hallelujah and to give an anchor to this revelation that was given not to peter not to john not them to give him to paul paul in ephesians 3 said for this cause i paul a prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given to me you would that you by that by revelation he has made known unto me the mystery whereby ye read that you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which is in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as is not revealed on these holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel whereas i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god that's unto me oh glory to god so poor with establishing that this was a revelation given to him by god oh hallelujah praise god that unto me who are the least of the saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unseasonable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery oh glory to god hallelujah praise god thank you jesus so when the veil in the temple was rent no more special priesthood it's for whosoever will today they want a new priesthood they want man so-called fivefold i call it so-called title in apostrophes hallelujah to run after them this renting of the veil of the temple the veil of the temple was rent to cancel all and any intermediary if there's any goddamn mary god i know secretary god i know somebody between you and him oh god give the lord i shout on that one let me say it god got a hand on mary gloria no secretary god i have nobody to renew on him when that veil was busted from the top to the bottom he gave you direct access isn't that right the preaching of the cross is the preaching also of the blood oh glory to god for first corinthians 2 2 4 i am determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified oh gloria this is the gospel that paul preached have you received the holy ghost since you believe do you believe have you received because if you believe you shall receive have you received sins you believe oh glory to god we're almost done hallelujah it was the day of pentecost when 150 jews were in an upper room with the doors closed waiting for the promise cowardly afraid to testify the door shut because of the threat of the jews it was after the resurrected christ had come into the form of the holy spirit and given them an experience and licking tongues of fire set upon them it was then that they could run out into the streets not before when that fire hit them so is then they could go out and be a witness of the gospel oh glory to god hallelujah and peter could say ye men of israel and you that dwell in judea let this be known unto you and hack into my words it was after he had the experience of receiving the holy spirit so there is an experience or give the lord a shout of receiving the holy spirit we're not talking about joy in our church we're not talking about that we're talking about your father setting fire upon your life after he had the experience of receiving the holy spirit he could testify fearless and seal his testimony with his own blood oh my hallelujah oh glory to god and this is where i get the inspiration from oh glory to god the parable the man came in and with all the garment because when you get the wedding invitation then you'll get your wedding garment at the door and the wedding garment is the baptist of the holy ghost so when the man of the house came i am he saw a man there with all the government he's a friend he knew him friend oh you got inside of here like everybody they don't have the same garment because when you get that diamond everybody look alike you know who rich who poor who have who don't have everybody's sim garment no watches he said should he come some other way he come in the window he come in our back way but not through the door not through the door the way that jesus came to watch the way that jesus came through self-sacrifice then he dropped this here given your all to god and walk in the country and be crucified with him and rise again here we go to wear his garment of sacrifice and debt to the things of the world amen you know what the churches are today you live anyhow you want and go to church so god become like a ritual that would go there i hate the moon i hit a new feast at your new moon i hate it i hate it i have no sincerity in it but what we are called to do is to wear this garment of sacrifice you could do things but you prove you choose not to you could go certain places but you choose not to you could say say certain things but you choose not to to sacrifice even with what your mouth is a sacrifice hallelujah many quarrels don't have to go further but nobody want to give up and make a sacrifice to keep us still tongue so then you come a verbal war hallelujah oh my god jesus knew the cost of the cross jesus knew what the cross entailed because in matthew 24 39 he went a little further fell on his face and prayed saying father every possibility is compassion me nevertheless not my will but as thou wilt if he didn't know he never prayed that prayer he knew the suffering he knew the pain he knew the anguish but he was prepared to go all the way he asked perhaps he could be bypassing philippians to eat and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross mission camera please oh hallelujah praise god inclusion and i'm closing what obama's saying this not long ago there was a great american musician young fellow outstanding character and he could play that music and the man was so great everywhere until finally he went to europe to play before the great lovers of that kind of music and one night after he had played his music the audience was so excited until they stood on your feet and screamed and clapped their hands together and they expected the young man to walk out and bow to appreciate the applauding and they noticed he didn't say a word and they stopped to see what was the matter and they noticed the young man wasn't even noticing his audience he was looking up in the balcony way up high and they all turned to see what the young man was facing and up in the balcony set the old master teacher he the young man wasn't noticing what his audience was saying he wanted to get a bow head from the old master teacher and i think that is it today this old-fashioned preaching of the cross the baptism of the holy ghost signs and wonders are miracles in their true state isn't very attractive today people call you crazy lots of them think if your polishes up a little bit get a little order here a little bit there thousand time thousands will come and listen to some orator someone who is polishing grammar and they will applaud it but church today let's not listen to the applauding of the world let's keep our minds on the teacher the holy spirit you can play jesus keep me on the cross let's not listen to the applauding of the world let's keep our minds and the teacher the holy spirit see what he is bowing to will
