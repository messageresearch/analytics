[15:13] verse 24 to 27
[15:15] and proverbs 23 wanna read one booster
[15:18] verse seven
[15:21] reading from joshua chapter 14 reading
[15:24] from verse six then the children of
[15:25] judah
[15:26] came unto joshua and giggle
[15:28] and caleb the son of jeffrey the killer
[15:31] night said unto him don't know it's the
[15:33] thing that moses said unto me that the
[15:35] lord said unto moses the man of god
[15:36] considering me and thee in kinespania
[15:40] 40 years old was i when moses the
[15:42] servant of the lord sent me
[15:44] from kinespania to inspire the land
[15:47] and i brought
[15:49] him
[15:50] word
[15:51] again
[15:52] as it was in my heart
[15:54] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[15:56] with me made the heart of the people
[15:58] melt
[15:59] but i wholly followed the lord my god
[16:01] and moses sway on that day saying surely
[16:04] the land where thy feet have trotted
[16:05] shall be dying inheritance and thy
[16:08] children's forever
[16:10] because thou has holy followed the lord
[16:12] my god
[16:13] now behold the lord had kept me alive as
[16:15] he said these forty and five years
[16:18] even since the lord speak this word unto
[16:20] moses
[16:21] while the children of israel wandered in
[16:22] the wilderness and now lo
[16:24] i am this day four score and five years

[18:41] testimony he brought word
[18:43] as it was
[18:45] in his heart
[18:47] okay let's go
[18:49] there's something to the exodus but a
[18:50] man
[18:51] the spiritual man can look down in egypt
[18:53] and see persecution rise
[18:56] and see
[18:57] joseph taken away
[18:59] in order that persecution could rise
[19:04] the prophet said
[19:05] that
[19:06] and this here
[19:08] referring to is there raise up a pharaoh
[19:10] who knew not joseph
[19:12] now remember joseph saved egypt
[19:15] by his vision
[19:16] an interpretation of the vision that
[19:18] that the pharaoh had he actually saved
[19:21] egypt
[19:22] and his family came and got blessed and
[19:24] everything else now joseph was taken out
[19:27] that the prosecution could rise
[19:29] hallelujah
[19:31] and joseph will be removed
[19:33] and brother banham type joseph as
[19:34] freedom of religion
[19:36] and all this america which is revelation
[19:38] 13
[19:40] she was founded on freedom of religion
[19:42] isn't that right and we know that the b
[19:45] system going to be activated
[19:47] where the saints going to become
[19:49] persecuted or pressed
[19:51] this is our promise that we're going to
[19:53] have a press come down and at that time
[19:55] you're going to see the table in effect
[19:58] and brown give testimony what you see
[20:00] manifested temporarily will be
[20:02] manifested in its fullness
[20:04] so there's a manifestation to come but i
[20:06] want you to notice what god did
[20:08] when they came out of egypt
[20:10] he gave testimony to them go into the
[20:12] land these 12 brothers these 12
[20:14] ministers these 12 whatever you want to
[20:16] call them of the 12 tribes go into the
[20:18] land and bring back evidence to the
[20:20] people
[20:21] of what i promised
[20:22] so you can't just this talk this thing
[20:25] it have to have evidence of this thing
[20:27] you have to taste this thing you have to
[20:30] experience this thing you have to feel
[20:32] this thing it's not a book thing a talk
[20:34] thing a written thing it's a manifested
[20:36] thing
[20:38] it's real grapes
[20:39] hallelujah when god tells them the land
[20:41] full of milk and honey he wasn't the
[20:43] imagination it was a reality
[20:46] so these brothers had a testimony the
[20:48] land is the good land
[20:50] but it's just we can't take it because
[20:52] too much a giants in the land oh glory
[20:54] to god but caleb had something in his
[20:56] heart

[21:08] sickness he wasn't thinking about
[21:09] nothing around him hallelujah all he was

[22:23] nothing here like what the preachers say
[22:24] yeah you're fight with the preacher
[22:26] fight with this one and fight like your
[22:27] own old spirit but i'll give you a
[22:29] spirit that you can live with peacefully
[22:31] with your neighbor
[22:33] that you can behave yourself
[22:35] and then i'll put my spirit
[22:37] inside your spirit
[22:39] and then you're going to walk like me
[22:41] they're going to talk like me they're
[22:43] going to act like me because i'm going
[22:45] to be in you give the lord a shout
[22:47] this is your promise
[22:49] you are you
[22:51] born in sin shape iniquity but he
[22:53] promised you a new heart
[22:55] he promised you a new spirit he promised
[22:57] you his spirit so don't feel bad at
[22:59] night he promised
[23:02] let's negotiate
[23:04] don't your sins be a scarlet
[23:06] they shall be white as wool
[23:08] white as snow come on let's let's talk
[23:10] about it
[23:11] let's discuss this thing
[23:13] oh hallelujah
[23:15] so i want to see that now watch
[23:17] so for persecution to rise
[23:19] he said joseph had to be taken away in
[23:22] order that the position will rise
[23:24] something have to take place because
[23:25] barbara says they're going to close down
[23:27] these kind of churches
[23:30] now i know
[23:31] i know we're hearing that here
[23:35] but overnight
[23:37] you will show things just change
[23:38] suddenly
[23:41] overnight there's no game here
[23:47] this is prophecy you know
[23:49] remember the devil controlling all
[23:50] nations
[23:52] including trinidad
[23:55] on all all the laws they're setting up
[23:58] is to come against the christians
[24:01] you know the devil is a judge there you
[24:03] know barbara says they're waiting for
[24:05] dynamics and the united nations to
[24:08] enforce the law
[24:09] so their witness dynamics are we waiting
[24:11] on dynamics
[24:13] dynamics will bring in effect all things
[24:17] because dynamics is the spirit to bring
[24:19] the seeds to life
[24:23] los angeles thinking there's a seed
[24:25] that was spoken of a prophet
[24:28] but that spirit coming behind that sea
[24:30] to make it manifest
[24:32] in its season and time
[24:34] you being filled with the holy ghost is
[24:35] a seed
[24:39] your deliverance is a seed
[24:41] your healing is a seed
[24:43] and the spirit comes behind the seed to
[24:45] make it manifest in your life
[24:47] the question is if you believe it
[24:50] because sin is unbelief
[24:52] it's if you believe it because sin is
[24:54] not smoking and drinking sin is unbelief
[24:57] because if god is speaking and you

[33:16] girlfriend he's exposed are in perfect
[33:19] harmony like one soul and one man
[33:21] because they're going to be one flesh
[33:23] then so he's making a reference and then
[33:25] coming back to the church then when the
[33:27] church can get in such harmony with god
[33:32] until
[33:33] the manifestation of the bridegroom is
[33:36] manifested in the bride because they
[33:38] won't be one
[33:39] praise god i don't want to hear about
[33:41] wisdom being the greatest gift we had
[33:43] that for 50 years that is not like not
[33:46] no scripture
[33:47] greatest gift is to fit the word
[33:49] together oh yeah they would fit in
[33:50] together a long time we fitted so we
[33:52] fitted so we fitted so we fitted so it
[33:54] fit fit fit
[33:57] no
[33:59] the harmony
[34:01] with god
[34:02] until
[34:04] until what more revelations more
[34:06] mysteries until the manifestation
[34:09] of the bridegroom
[34:10] began to start to work into the pride he
[34:12] even said with the thunders he said then
[34:14] you are worshiping the living christ
[34:16] when them thunders begin to roar and
[34:19] manifest among the people then you're
[34:21] worshiping the living christ him moving
[34:23] in and out
[34:26] all glory to god are giving you the
[34:28] promises
[34:29] this is your promise your promises are
[34:31] no man on your own that's a promise
[34:35] if i dead any morning this is still
[34:37] truth
[34:40] this is what you have to look for
[34:46] there are three stages of the journey
[34:48] and there are three stages of the
[34:49] journey we are justified by faith
[34:52] believing in the lord jesus christ
[34:53] forsaken land of egypt come out
[34:55] sanctified by the offering of his blood
[34:57] washed from our sins and so and then we
[35:00] are seeking a land a city
[35:03] that's coming or a promise
[35:06] so did israel in the wilderness they
[35:08] were just types sojourners no place to
[35:10] rest traveling night after night
[35:13] following a pillar of fire so today up
[35:15] the mountain along the valley challenge
[35:17] of wilderness this happened to you that
[35:18] happened there you're journeying
[35:20] some people give up in your wilderness
[35:22] they know the land
[35:24] oh god it's hot it's hot i'm tired yes
[35:27] it's wilderness we want air conditioned
[35:29] breeze is wilderness
[35:32] a thirsty are thirsty we are finding
[35:34] water it's really nice
[35:35] whatever spring somewhere
[35:38] after you pass through a dry spell you
[35:39] come to church and the water will just
[35:40] break up on you
[35:44] my god your soul gets refreshed
[35:46] you all get revived
[35:49] you're going through a journey
[35:51] it's a personal journey it's not a
[35:52] church thing you know
[35:58] think that you're taking a retake
[35:59] everybody going through the same thing
[36:01] they're not 10 commandments the video
[36:03] movie you know they know that you know
[36:04] this is individual you know you're going
[36:06] to your own stages
[36:08] but you have a lambda promise
[36:10] oh hallelujah praise god
[36:14] so watch no place to rest traveling
[36:16] night after night watch following the
[36:18] pillar of fire but finally come down to
[36:20] the promised land where they settle down
[36:22] that is where the believer comes you
[36:24] first have to recognize he's a sinner
[36:27] then he's separated by the waters the
[36:28] washing of the water by the blood and by
[36:31] the word rather believe in the lord
[36:32] jesus being justified by faith and then
[36:35] what he becomes a journal he's on a
[36:37] journey to what a promise god made
[36:40] israel had not yet received the promise
[36:42] and they were on their journey please do
[36:45] understand that is where you nazarina
[36:47] and primaguni so forth fell because
[36:49] israel when they come to the spot of
[36:51] kenish baniya when the spies went over
[36:52] and said the land is great some of them
[36:54] come and say we can't take it because
[36:55] the cities are walled up and so forth
[36:57] but joshua caleb stood out he said we
[37:00] are more
[37:01] than able to take it
[37:06] now all here in the same gospel you know
[37:09] all of me and the same talk from prophet
[37:11] moses you know but these guys
[37:14] these joshua and caleb guys them saying
[37:16] them talking different
[37:18] from the rest of the ministers
[37:20] all them fellas and one man and one
[37:22] accord we can't take it the negative
[37:24] about the promises of god hallelujah to
[37:27] take the easy road
[37:29] of mechanics mechanics until they
[37:31] mechanically
[37:34] spirit me say it again
[37:37] this is easy to do nowhere now
[37:39] talk about the prophet what you probably
[37:40] speak before the doctrines and touching
[37:42] my wife the children will go down and
[37:44] this and that and that and
[37:45] his historic history
[37:49] because they're afraid to believe what
[37:50] god promised
[37:51] [Music]
[37:52] i don't want no false manifestation
[37:54] i want no impersonation i want a false
[37:58] manifestation i want to really promise
[37:59] that
[38:00] listen listen them guys could i say
[38:02] they're taking it by faith you know but
[38:03] he said tarry in the city of jerusalem
[38:07] until you be endured powerful and high
[38:10] he tell them that after mysteries open
[38:13] after understanding open brother george
[38:15] after the word open he leave nothing
[38:17] unopened you know everything was open
[38:19] you know he said we had to wait for this
[38:20] thing
[38:21] my father have to send this thing
[38:23] hallelujah if i know god the comforter
[38:25] will not come so i can't give this to
[38:27] you this is god have to bring this down
[38:30] oh glory the god and then went in the
[38:31] upper room and there was praising and
[38:33] blessing god continually every service
[38:35] they worshipping because they know what
[38:37] they promised they know what they
[38:39] believe didn't know what to expect and
[38:42] only god could set dynamics no man could
[38:44] bring long dynamics in that sense it
[38:46] take god to send them he said do all
[38:48] that you can do get your heart right get
[38:51] your mechanics right and if you get your
[38:53] heart right get the mechanics in order
[38:55] then only he can set up the dynamics oh
[38:58] glory to god once you catch that your
[39:00] job is to stay sanctified your job is to
[39:02] stay into worship you're stopping to
[39:04] stay in the word and you come to church
[39:06] and worship and watch firefall upon your
[39:09] life
[39:10] oh glory to god this is your promise
[39:12] because you created an atmosphere they
[39:14] did it in the upper room you've got to
[39:16] do it here you can sit here and expect
[39:18] the preacher to bring some wafer there
[39:20] ain't no catholic priest preaching to
[39:22] you or give the lord a shout
[39:25] oh you have to fight like caleb i am
[39:27] just as strong as i was
[39:36] oh you think i'd be preaching i could do
[39:37] all your work and you're nothing you're
[39:38] sitting about hallelujah
[39:48] the wise virgin saw something that the
[39:50] foolish version did not see
[39:53] the wise version was willing to do
[39:55] something
[39:56] was not willing to do
[39:57] the foolish virgins was willing to be
[39:59] ordinary christians
[40:00] ordinary church members or believers the
[40:02] wise virgin wanted something extra
[40:07] so then they come to barely make it
[40:09] barely hold on in church this will give
[40:11] me more
[40:12] you have more of that y'all more where
[40:14] that come from my cop feeling empty

[40:21] i want power on my job i want to see the
[40:23] power
[40:25] [Music]
[40:28] and when i see when i talk about power
[40:30] i'm not on what silent one is you know
[40:32] i'm done with power of life
[40:34] life
[40:35] that you could see overcoming
[40:37] you don't need to see no miracle you
[40:39] know what you want to know you're
[40:40] overcoming the lust of the eyes the lust
[40:43] of the flesh the pride of life a power
[40:45] to have life
[40:49] [Applause]
[40:54] may be seated
[40:56] like you are what you are waiting by
[40:57] yourself
[40:58] when you're in church you could play
[40:59] holy you can play righteous you can wear
[41:00] long tie wear long dress is it when you
[41:02] leave church is doing that same thing
[41:04] and behaving yourself
[41:05] that's what he told me
[41:08] it's how you live after you leave the
[41:09] church
[41:13] so the power are you talking about his
[41:14] power to live
[41:16] a holy life power to say i am sorry for
[41:19] what to say that's paul you know some
[41:21] people can't repent they can't even say
[41:23] i'm sorry i was wrong
[41:27] it's easier to say no mistakes were made
[41:30] [Music]
[41:31] and all things work together
[41:34] yeah but when you're wrong you're wrong
[41:37] when you're wrong you can't be right and
[41:39] wrong at the same time we were all wrong
[41:41] we were all born in censorship inequity
[41:44] that's why we all needed blood
[41:46] price paid and
[41:48] [Music]
[41:52] so i am fighting for more doctrine i'm
[41:54] not teaching no more mysteries and
[41:56] i want the mysteries and nutrition and
[41:57] reduction but i fight him for life
[42:00] there is something in me calling for
[42:01] something that i know god have
[42:03] there's a deep in me calling for
[42:04] something that god have
[42:06] man can supply that
[42:08] apostle prophet teacher pastor can't
[42:10] supply that
[42:14] i will think about that
[42:15] [Music]
[42:28] when you realize that the mancus applied
[42:30] that then you reckon wait a minute the
[42:33] man is a channel
[42:35] by which the word comes to me to go and
[42:38] get what god promised
[42:41] oh
[42:43] not even moses crossing to the land
[42:46] moses carry on and god said listen watch
[42:48] and don't touch you're not going across
[42:51] shut him down behind her because his
[42:52] behavior was kind of troublesome to god
[42:55] and moses was prophet
[42:57] and god said as is you okay
[43:00] moses is it a cabinet sophomore yeah
[43:01] crossover
[43:03] they cross over read your show right now
[43:06] read yourself one verse one moses my
[43:08] servant is dead
[43:13] not let me have some money for moses you
[43:14] know moses my servant is dead
[43:17] now joshua
[43:21] we have to go into ephesians no joshua
[43:24] you have to manifest and type because in
[43:26] the new testament we'll have a book
[43:28] called ephesians no joshua
[43:31] [Music]
[43:32] no appearing to preach
[43:34] no of hearing the preach
[43:35] hallelujah because joshua was typing the
[43:38] book of ephesians
[43:39] [Music]
[43:40] and ephesians is where the faith
[43:43] was anchored manifested ephesians was
[43:46] the standard
[43:47] the standard bearer of the age of
[43:49] ephesians where the light alpha light
[43:53] where the original apostolic church was
[43:55] at
[43:56] and we come to the last age we have gosh
[43:58] and a prophet to turn our hearts back
[44:02] to the faith of the father or give the
[44:04] lord a shout
[44:06] so the faith is to come right back to
[44:08] joshua
[44:09] or give the lord a shout
[44:11] right back to this caleb joshua of it
[44:14] to say give me my mountain
[44:18] [Music]
[44:23] how much pastors have the church
[44:25] fighting with next churches
[44:27] minister fighting with other groups i
[44:29] say we have no fight with no church

[53:59] my god i am start to go where i want to
[54:02] go tonight
[54:05] let's continue
[54:07] my god
[54:09] but the believers the caleb and joshua
[54:10] outfit are like that
[54:12] that was going on to the promise
[54:14] they moved over into the land
[54:16] took the land settled down in the land
[54:18] as a
[54:20] possession
[54:22] before they get it as a possession they
[54:24] had a profession
[54:26] that god promised us that they could say
[54:29] over there that's my land across there
[54:30] but when you see the god over this is a
[54:32] possession now now i could cut the grass
[54:35] i could put my house i could put my
[54:37] balcony i could put my shed i could
[54:39] plant my vine i could plant my fig i
[54:42] could do all of that because i'm knowing
[54:43] the land you can't plant no figure no
[54:45] wilderness you can't count down in the
[54:47] wilderness you can't build no house in
[54:49] the wilderness you're dreaming in the
[54:50] wilderness because you're going on to
[54:52] our promised land
[54:53] oh glory so don't put your stake down
[54:55] where you are right now get into the
[54:57] promised land
[54:58] and you'll find out what it is just now
[55:01] hallelujah so i'm saying let's not stop
[55:03] believing on the lord jesus being
[55:05] baptized let's not stop because they
[55:07] clean us up from the life of sin but now
[55:09] we press on into a position
[55:13] i like that
[55:14] the teacher is supposed to teach the
[55:16] people to get their position
[55:18] what position opposition
[55:20] to a promise of the baptism holy ghost
[55:25] so i don't know what the educational
[55:26] message is about if it not taken us to
[55:28] the baptism
[55:30] of the holy ghost he said to press on
[55:32] into a position
[55:34] because that is a position
[55:36] a position watch to a promise of the
[55:38] bible he goes for peter said that there
[55:40] of the dead pentecost for the promises
[55:42] unto you and your children and then that
[55:44] are fire off even as many as the lord of
[55:46] god shall call
[55:48] so therefore ephesus ephesus here says
[55:51] it's like joshua positionally you notice
[55:53] joshua and cross you know into the land
[55:55] taking the land he divides the land if
[55:57] from here manas are here this one here
[56:00] god here he divided the land and notice
[56:03] it just burns our hearts each one of
[56:05] those hebrew mothers giving birth to
[56:06] those children she spoke the very place
[56:09] in a labor pains that they will be
[56:11] positioned in the promised land
[56:13] so in her giving birth her birth pains
[56:16] cry
[56:17] named where they be placed
[56:21] so you are placed by labor pains
[56:28] [Music]
[56:31] do you hear that being preached
[56:34] i can't give you liberal pains i mean
[56:35] i'm in midwife
[56:39] liverpool's come on automatically
[56:41] when you're trying to bring forth when
[56:43] zion travailed
[56:45] zion broadford
[56:47] when you come to full term the baby have
[56:48] to come to maybe not resident in
[56:50] saturday it's a temporary place
[56:52] the baby holding on to come out
[56:56] so so therefore the whole world is
[56:58] travailing to give birth to the new
[56:59] world we have we have world war one
[57:01] world war ii gone just one month ago
[57:04] john already saw a new revenue earth so
[57:06] with another new thing
[57:07] you already saw it is in the bible
[57:09] but you have to get in your new world
[57:11] too
[57:12] a transformed life
[57:14] so he said a new heart a new spirit and
[57:16] i put my spirit within you
[57:18] and his spirit consists of seven parts
[57:21] oh don't get me started tonight
[57:23] i ain't talking about the baptism part
[57:24] are talking about them seven parts
[57:26] you're going to lay them several parts
[57:28] inside of you that you become a living
[57:30] moving monument
[57:32] you'll be a god on the earth
[57:35] [Applause]
[57:38] so ignorant man like peter when he knew
[57:40] what was in him he could say silver and
[57:43] gold i don't have but what i have what
[57:45] he had he had seven mysteries
[57:47] he had seven voices
[57:49] he had seven rainbows he had seven
[57:51] virtues oh glory to god hallelujah
[57:55] glory to god what was the mystery christ

[58:03] jesus christ and the manchester united
[58:06] what was in him power in him
[58:08] oh god he could give it to anybody he
[58:09] could handle it to anybody oh hallelujah
[58:12] jesus never did that you know jesus it
[58:13] will not be made whole
[58:15] will not be made perfect jesus asked him
[58:18] you want to be healed you know but peter
[58:19] say rise up and walk
[58:25] look at look at peter when peter got to
[58:27] the house of cornelius god didn't tell
[58:28] peter what was going to unfold
[58:31] he didn't want to go to those hebrew
[58:32] hiddens those gentiles and why jesus had
[58:35] to talk he just has to talk to the world
[58:36] talk to the world talk the word

[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:04] [Applause]
[1:00:06] when moses with a consciousness of his
[1:00:09] calling with an awareness from an
[1:00:11] intellectual conception that he's called
[1:00:13] for deliverer when he killed a man so
[1:00:14] you run through life you know possibly
[1:00:16] each of 40 years
[1:00:18] he ends up buying his newspapers

[1:00:22] wanted nothing but all he done he didn't
[1:00:23] want to hear no news
[1:00:26] or when god had enough for him which is
[1:00:28] her tempered wife
[1:00:30] when he gets flat out enough
[1:00:32] god sent him on top of the mountain
[1:00:34] by sending the pillar fine up burning
[1:00:35] bush i mean god finished with moses
[1:00:37] moses was done not even your wife could
[1:00:39] stop him

[1:00:42] so he said abraham said ask where you're
[1:00:44] going he's down to egypt we're going on

[1:02:41] want no lesser holy ghost
[1:02:43] you see in the upper room they fulfilled
[1:02:45] three steps they were justified they
[1:02:47] were sanctified they received the holy
[1:02:49] ghost and they were adopted
[1:02:51] in the upper room
[1:02:52] when come to us we get four steps
[1:02:55] little justification where's the
[1:02:57] signification pentecost the baptismal
[1:03:00] holy ghost and brethren by the word
[1:03:04] but once the fullness of the word be

[1:03:23] about a genuine typhoid ministry it
[1:03:25] would be christ in these men
[1:03:27] christ in the form of an apostle christ
[1:03:30] in the form of a prophet
[1:03:31] christ in the form of a pastor christ in
[1:03:33] the form of a teacher cries in a former
[1:03:35] evangelist

[1:03:50] hear from the pastor you would hear from
[1:03:52] the prophet you would hear from

[1:04:18] which will be the body of christ that's
[1:04:20] the mystical body of jesus christ and no
[1:04:22] man could control that
[1:04:24] no man could have that no man could
[1:04:26] govern that you could be working in that
[1:04:28] but you can't control that christ is the
[1:04:31] head of the body called the church
[1:04:33] okay the lord i shout let me say again
[1:04:34] christ is the head of the body called

[1:04:52] under the persecution of the outside
[1:04:53] world believing in the lord jesus that
[1:04:55] the promise of the holy ghost just as
[1:04:56] real to us and was a pentecost how they
[1:04:58] groan and cry under labor pains but when
[1:05:01] they are born one and positionally born

[1:05:07] ghost has set
[1:05:09] in the church some apostles some
[1:05:11] prophets some teachers some pastors some
[1:05:14] evangelists then he give into their
[1:05:17] speaking with tongues

[1:05:56] answers but all right
[1:05:58] today the church has come through
[1:05:59] justification through luther and through
[1:06:01] signification through the methodist and
[1:06:02] known to the land now listen
[1:06:05] to the time of the promise
[1:06:08] luther
[1:06:09] wesley and now
[1:06:11] the time
[1:06:13] of the promise
[1:06:14] the promise is
[1:06:16] the baptism of the spirit
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:22] no he's not talking about pentecost
[1:06:25] 1906
[1:06:26] he's not talking about that let's
[1:06:28] continue now watch
[1:06:30] the promise
[1:06:31] is the baptism of the spirit which is
[1:06:34] promised all to the old testament and
[1:06:37] new too
[1:06:38] the promise is behold
[1:06:41] i send the promise of my father upon you
[1:06:44] peter said that on the day of pentecost
[1:06:46] this that that is the promise the
[1:06:49] promised land here we go
[1:06:51] is to live in this land of the holy
[1:06:53] spirit
[1:06:58] church is out this is the holy spirit
[1:07:01] now this is not coming to church this is
[1:07:03] living
[1:07:04] with your husband living with your wife
[1:07:06] living with your children living on the
[1:07:08] street living in when you go to the
[1:07:10] grocery living
[1:07:12] in this land of the holy spirit
[1:07:15] listen
[1:07:17] that is god's promise for the church
[1:07:20] is to live here we go in the power of
[1:07:22] the spirit
[1:07:24] it's another world
[1:07:26] i love that the first thing is another
[1:07:28] world
[1:07:29] it's another land
[1:07:31] you have to come out of the condition
[1:07:32] you've been in to come out and live in
[1:07:35] this
[1:07:36] from islam
[1:07:38] hallelujah
[1:07:39] so just as the promised land was
[1:07:41] promised in the old testament to the
[1:07:43] children of israel which was canaan land
[1:07:45] we have a promise also which is the land
[1:07:47] of the holy spirit
[1:07:52] so what did he said he said means just
[1:07:53] from eternity for
[1:07:56] what he says he's standing for
[1:07:58] some angels
[1:07:59] he said to gather all
[1:08:02] the scattered words
[1:08:03] to tie it back
[1:08:05] into the word
[1:08:07] to do what
[1:08:08] to bring down the holy spirit
[1:08:10] let me say it again he sent some angels
[1:08:13] to gather all
[1:08:15] the scattered word to tie it back
[1:08:18] into the word
[1:08:19] to bring down the holy spirit because
[1:08:21] with the restoration of this word
[1:08:24] comes a restoration of the spirit
[1:08:27] because the word and spirit is one
[1:08:29] and the word was captured through seven
[1:08:30] ages so we have to bring the scattered
[1:08:32] word to bring back the fullness of the
[1:08:35] holy ghost
[1:08:36] in this hour to produce the ministry of
[1:08:39] the sons of god but the manifestation of
[1:08:41] the sons of god when born sons filth and
[1:08:44] speak and the word is created just like
[1:08:46] that
[1:08:47] oh give the lord a shout
[1:08:49] glory to god
[1:08:51] and the holy ghost being loosed in the
[1:08:54] last days because he released the word
[1:08:56] in the last days so god loosed the holy
[1:08:58] ghost in the form of bridal promises and
[1:09:01] when you receive them by their promises
[1:09:03] you receive the holy ghost in word form
[1:09:05] oh give the lord a shout
[1:09:07] you receive the mechanics of the pyramid
[1:09:09] in you in word form because the secret
[1:09:12] is the word
[1:09:14] is in the bride
[1:09:15] the word tonight is in you
[1:09:17] the mechanics already in you oh glory to
[1:09:20] god and the mind of christ is charity
[1:09:22] the holy spirit elohim the capstone
[1:09:25] coming upon you
[1:09:27] to quicken and make it alive
[1:09:30] oh hallelujah praise god could we give
[1:09:32] the girl some praises oh hallelujah
[1:09:35] hallelujah
[1:09:37] thank you lord
[1:09:39] glory it's another world it's another
[1:09:41] land you have to come with the condition
[1:09:42] you've been in to come to live in islam
[1:09:44] and to receive the promise remember you
[1:09:47] cherish the performance
[1:09:48] after this the holy spirit upon you
[1:09:51] afterward
[1:09:53] that is not looter
[1:09:55] that is not wesley that is not pentecost
[1:09:58] that is the person of the holy ghost
[1:10:00] himself which came in the evening time
[1:10:02] the problem came to introduce the person
[1:10:04] of christ
[1:10:05] because the pentecostal they don't have
[1:10:06] him
[1:10:07] oh give the lord a praise offering do
[1:10:10] you see that now
[1:10:11] so power is promised when
[1:10:13] after the holy ghost it's come upon you
[1:10:16] watch this he came unto his own
[1:10:19] his own receive him not
[1:10:21] but as many as receive him
[1:10:23] the damn
[1:10:24] give you power to become it doesn't mean
[1:10:27] you're adopted it's power to become its
[1:10:30] power to climb its power to grow its
[1:10:32] power to move the ladder of this pyramid
[1:10:35] or glory to god some little miracle and
[1:10:38] somehow miracle and your feeling tops
[1:10:40] among them somewhere you don't get them
[1:10:41] started that's why the prophet came to
[1:10:43] term the pentecostal all these tongues
[1:10:45] and speaking in tongues you know getting
[1:10:46] started but you're going to be co-placed
[1:10:49] in a place of trying to be tested
[1:10:52] to be approved as a son
[1:10:55] the right kind of a son
[1:10:57] oh give the lord a shout
[1:10:59] hallelujah there's gonna be sons placed
[1:11:02] positionally into our position of power
[1:11:05] because of the character because of
[1:11:07] their life
[1:11:11] [Music]
[1:11:16] so that is the backdrop of what i wanted
[1:11:17] to say tonight
[1:11:19] wanna punch
[1:11:21] that just keep curtaining
[1:11:24] no getting started
[1:11:28] hallelujah
[1:11:30] jesus is not going to ask me if i was a
[1:11:32] methodist
[1:11:33] lutheran baptist he's going to judge me
[1:11:37] to what i was in my heart
[1:11:42] that's right
[1:11:44] that is what he will judge us all by
[1:11:46] amen
[1:11:47] so you see after all he shouts amen
[1:11:50] you have to know what's in your
[1:11:52] heart because from the abundance of the
[1:11:55] heart
[1:11:57] the mouth speak
[1:11:59] if any heart corrupt corruption come out
[1:12:01] your mouth
[1:12:02] if you have evil evil come out your
[1:12:03] mouth
[1:12:04] oh you say out of the heart proceed
[1:12:06] adulteries and fornication all things
[1:12:07] inside
[1:12:08] comes out of our manhattan
[1:12:11] that's why i offer a new heart tonight
[1:12:14] new spirit
[1:12:15] [Applause]
[1:12:16] and his spirit amen
[1:12:18] hallelujah
[1:12:20] [Music]
[1:12:21] now don't think it's just one church
[1:12:24] we represent all the churches
[1:12:26] and many of the people that come into
[1:12:28] the line
[1:12:29] that is baptist catholic i have never
[1:12:32] seen one that come but what was healed
[1:12:35] when they come upon the basis of faith
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:41] so it wasn't like catholic not being
[1:12:42] healed methodist not being healed no no
[1:12:43] no no no let's continue i wouldn't go on
[1:12:46] that i have seen people come
[1:12:48] that were renowned christians
[1:12:51] and stand there
[1:12:53] and be told the reason that they
[1:12:55] couldn't be healed
[1:12:56] and i see street workers
[1:12:59] prostitutes
[1:13:00] people of in fame come off the street
[1:13:02] and be healed
[1:13:04] of crippled
[1:13:06] blindness and everything else sinners
[1:13:11] no you don't have to be a christian to
[1:13:12] be healed
[1:13:14] he's a big one you know
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:30] i like that it's true
[1:13:34] you don't have to be a christian to be
[1:13:35] healed but you have to be a christian to
[1:13:37] stay healed
[1:13:44] because from the bible jesus go and say
[1:13:46] no more police are worse than come upon
[1:13:48] you
[1:13:50] so to keep the healing you had to become
[1:13:51] a christian
[1:13:53] but god healed everybody who have faith
[1:13:55] to receive it
[1:13:57] they get it
[1:13:58] so you don't mean an angry god in that
[1:14:00] way he just let the sun shine
[1:14:03] that the son of righteousness arises
[1:14:04] here in his rings
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:08] but abraham
[1:14:10] he's in the prayer line i believe my
[1:14:12] dear friend my enemy become like a flood
[1:14:13] god raise the standard against it you
[1:14:15] read these magazines and things how
[1:14:16] satan's a rampage god there is no
[1:14:18] standard don't worry do you believe that
[1:14:20] he's always on the right side he's
[1:14:22] always above the enemy all the time
[1:14:24] do you believe that lady sitting right
[1:14:25] there
[1:14:26] yes you had more faith than you thought
[1:14:29] you had
[1:14:31] faith
[1:14:32] is a subconscious thing
[1:14:35] lady
[1:14:36] faith is not a mental act
[1:14:38] it is something that you subconsciously
[1:14:40] do it people try to look to the
[1:14:42] intellect for faith when faith doesn't
[1:14:45] lay in there
[1:14:47] reasonably is there
[1:14:49] faith lays in the soul
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:14:56] and i said
[1:14:58] that's what penicillin is it kills the
[1:15:00] flu germs but it doesn't patch the cells
[1:15:02] that are being torn
[1:15:03] god has to do that
[1:15:05] so he's the only healer
[1:15:06] god is the healer and then it's your
[1:15:09] faith in god and many people have faith
[1:15:12] subconsciously
[1:15:14] and doesn't know it
[1:15:19] you mean you could be sitting here with
[1:15:20] a whole big bunch of faith tonight i
[1:15:21] don't even know it
[1:15:23] yeah
[1:15:25] yeah
[1:15:27] because it's at the subconscious level
[1:15:29] let's continue
[1:15:30] you're talking about a woman
[1:15:32] there was a little german woman she got
[1:15:34] instructions on a little prayer cloth i
[1:15:36] think he was crippled it says here to
[1:15:38] call in your friends or your pastor
[1:15:41] if you can if not one of your neighbors
[1:15:43] confess all your wrongs and ask god to
[1:15:46] heal you
[1:15:48] and place it on you and then believe
[1:15:50] that was the instruction on the preclude
[1:15:53] the little german woman it was amazing
[1:15:56] she
[1:15:57] put it on an underneath garment like it
[1:15:59] was instructed
[1:16:01] she had the neighbors come in and pray
[1:16:04] she confessed all her wrongs
[1:16:06] and when she got it on there she put a
[1:16:08] hand over her heart
[1:16:10] and said no old man devil
[1:16:13] you get over me
[1:16:16] and right up she got and went walking
[1:16:18] across the floor after being in a
[1:16:21] wheelchair for 20 some odd years
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:28] it is that simple
[1:16:31] you know there are many times we try to
[1:16:33] reach out for something
[1:16:35] for a certain kind of a fate
[1:16:37] and you don't have to have some kind of
[1:16:38] super fate to be healed
[1:16:41] the only thing you have to have is just
[1:16:43] the faith that you got
[1:16:46] now you know in the bible the blood was
[1:16:47] applied to the doors by hyssop
[1:16:50] and it was ordinary you don't have to
[1:16:53] have a super fate how did you come here
[1:16:56] how do you know you're going to leave
[1:16:58] how can you drive your car
[1:17:00] how do you move your hand you do it
[1:17:03] subconsciously
[1:17:05] because you believe that you can do it
[1:17:06] that's the way you believe for your
[1:17:08] healing
[1:17:11] it's just settled
[1:17:12] it doesn't take some high education some
[1:17:14] super duper something it takes common
[1:17:16] faith in god just believe it like you
[1:17:18] would if your mother would say to you
[1:17:20] some get something just believe it like
[1:17:22] that they took blood ordinary hyssop dip
[1:17:25] it in blood and pass it on the door
[1:17:30] he said i will take the stony heart give
[1:17:32] you a new heart the heart is the
[1:17:33] dwelling place of the holy spirit i will
[1:17:36] give you a new spirit i want you to
[1:17:37] watch the order many people get mixed up
[1:17:40] here they think they got the holy ghost
[1:17:42] but they just get a new spirit i'll give
[1:17:44] you a new heart a new spirit then i'll
[1:17:46] put my spirit now the new spirit god
[1:17:49] give you a new spirit and that new
[1:17:50] spirit god gave you so you could get
[1:17:52] along with the holy ghost
[1:17:56] that's good that's good that's good
[1:17:57] that's good the new spirit is for you to
[1:17:59] get along with the holy ghost we go
[1:18:01] without a new spirit you're gonna fight
[1:18:02] the holy ghost
[1:18:08] with the old spirit you couldn't get
[1:18:10] along with your neighbor you couldn't
[1:18:12] get along with yourself so you know you
[1:18:14] couldn't get along with god
[1:18:15] so god gave you a new spirit
[1:18:17] and many times under enthusiasm if you
[1:18:19] watch the life that it bears i hope i'm
[1:18:21] not hurting but i hope i'm uncovering a
[1:18:24] lot of times you think you have the holy
[1:18:26] spirit you said i sung i spoke in
[1:18:28] tongues certainly being that close say
[1:18:30] it might do all that but that is no
[1:18:32] spirit yet the holy spirit bears record
[1:18:35] of jesus christ
[1:18:36] he give you a new heart give your new
[1:18:38] spirit then he puts his spirit his
[1:18:40] spirit in you it's like you don't have
[1:18:41] to go around pretending you're a
[1:18:43] christian man the new spirit brings new
[1:18:45] life the holy spirit in your new heart
[1:18:47] your new heart new spirit and the holy
[1:18:49] spirit goes right in the center of your
[1:18:51] new spirit
[1:18:52] oh glory and your new spirit goes in the
[1:18:54] center of your new heart new hack in
[1:18:56] your new act new spirit in your new
[1:18:58] spirit his spirit
[1:19:01] that's the main spring and when you
[1:19:03] receive the holy spirit it goes into the
[1:19:05] middle
[1:19:06] of the dispens dispositions of yours you
[1:19:09] say i quit drinking i quit smoking i
[1:19:12] feel like i live in a person oops wait a
[1:19:14] minute you just got a new spirit
[1:19:16] but the holy spirit comes in the middle
[1:19:18] of that spirit and when he come he make
[1:19:20] every main motion every intellectual
[1:19:22] everything agreeing right into this
[1:19:24] middle of the wheel god says if the days
[1:19:26] are miracles if jesus is the same
[1:19:28] yesterday forever the holy ghost will be
[1:19:30] a record and say amen
[1:19:32] oh do you believe that
[1:19:34] and when you have the little temper fits
[1:19:35] and you fly out and your taillights and
[1:19:37] your presser light and your jump fences
[1:19:39] and you're so selfish with your
[1:19:40] organization and you're so now reminded
[1:19:42] you can only hear you cannot hear
[1:19:44] another minister
[1:19:48] you mean that here boy yeah yeah yeah
[1:19:51] yeah let me read it again
[1:19:53] when you're so selfish
[1:19:54] with your organization that you're so
[1:19:56] narrow-minded you couldn't hear another
[1:19:59] minister just remember the holy spirit
[1:20:02] isn't ticking inside of you
[1:20:06] so anytime somebody looking to a man
[1:20:08] looking at it only my embarrassment here
[1:20:11] they messed up
[1:20:12] big time
[1:20:14] because your spirit holy spirit and you
[1:20:16] want to hear the word
[1:20:21] oh glory to god
[1:20:23] so the holy spirit will make every
[1:20:25] movement like christ it will make you
[1:20:26] christ-like the fruits of the spirit is
[1:20:28] love joy peace
[1:20:31] suffering goodness meekness gentleness
[1:20:34] patience faith all those things are
[1:20:36] whole controlled by the holy spirit
[1:20:39] so you can't say we don't know what's
[1:20:41] going on but you and this person a long
[1:20:42] time long time it is ought to grudge you
[1:20:44] had to drop it you have to forgive and
[1:20:46] hug the person and move on
[1:20:48] yes yes you have to do that you have to
[1:20:50] love
[1:20:50] you have to love enemies you have to
[1:20:51] look god has a blessing with enemies to
[1:20:53] love
[1:20:57] let me say that again god bless you with
[1:20:59] enemies that you could love
[1:21:01] i hear teaching that jesus teach that
[1:21:02] love your enemies if all you have
[1:21:04] christian believers we are no enemy
[1:21:06] challenge
[1:21:07] did their enemy come in your feeling
[1:21:08] more spiritual than everybody else
[1:21:10] because they're not in your group or not
[1:21:11] in your circle or not in your
[1:21:13] love your enemies mean just that
[1:21:20] so that means you ain't supposed to
[1:21:22] fight with nobody
[1:21:30] our emotions is not so much as jumping
[1:21:32] up and down you could do that a shindig
[1:21:34] will bring that to you
[1:21:44] music or something i think so could be
[1:21:46] somebody get to tap in the foot just
[1:21:47] like the music in church
[1:21:48] i shouldn't think we'll do better than
[1:21:49] you well here what are you saying here
[1:21:51] you say enough but the holy spirit
[1:21:53] brings you into operation
[1:21:56] or in control of god that you walk in
[1:21:58] peace and in love and joy with long
[1:22:00] suffering and gentleness you see it
[1:22:02] isn't something you do
[1:22:04] it is something the holy spirit does in
[1:22:06] you remember you could stop smoking a
[1:22:08] subject and that what you stopped doing
[1:22:10] but when you get the operation of god
[1:22:11] that takes it out that's different
[1:22:14] because if you can stop everything you
[1:22:16] don't need holy spirit you just need to
[1:22:18] be you need to be the stopper
[1:22:20] you stop cutting in here you stop
[1:22:22] smoking you stop drinking you stop lying
[1:22:24] you stop thinking in the smaller wine on
[1:22:25] the side and the fun things and stuff
[1:22:26] all other stuff
[1:22:31] it's up high many scriptures here oh why
[1:22:33] didn't good for you buddy or something
[1:22:36] and have a drinking anointing underneath
[1:22:38] that
[1:22:39] see devil deceive receive you stop all
[1:22:41] of that
[1:22:42] see
[1:22:44] so therefore
[1:22:45] you'll recognize this god's operation in
[1:22:47] your life
[1:22:48] then you want more of him
[1:22:50] you worship him you're grateful to him
[1:22:53] praise god amen so what you see it is no
[1:22:56] longer an intellectual thought of your
[1:22:58] own it's here we go it's a subconscious
[1:23:01] movement of the holy spirit
[1:23:03] yeah but i wish i could shout the
[1:23:05] praises of god around the world to that
[1:23:11] he said you wish he could shout the
[1:23:13] prisoner a little more again
[1:23:18] there are many times we have put
[1:23:19] emphasis too much on i think on one
[1:23:22] season thing we put too much emphasis on
[1:23:24] emotions
[1:23:25] um because a group of years here tonight
[1:23:27] i feel very much at home in this puppet
[1:23:29] i'm very welcome and i know i love you
[1:23:30] and that's why i say those things we
[1:23:32] have put too much emphasis on our
[1:23:34] emotions perhaps maybe we feel as long
[1:23:36] as we are shouting and praising the lord
[1:23:38] that's fine i think that's good you say
[1:23:40] but in this philadelphian church just
[1:23:42] receive me as god's servant let me
[1:23:44] you you would like to know what i think
[1:23:46] is the greatest need of the church today
[1:23:48] what i think where i think is lacking is
[1:23:50] no soul travail
[1:23:55] the people are not broke up enough
[1:23:57] there is no burden seemingly you give me
[1:24:00] someone that's so tall about lost souls
[1:24:03] they just cry wanting a revival so bad
[1:24:06] they could hardly eat
[1:24:08] people are so selfish they wouldn't even
[1:24:10] testify the people about the lord
[1:24:12] they wouldn't invite somebody to service
[1:24:15] as far as they can send this save and i
[1:24:16] said it's like the hell everybody go to
[1:24:18] hell
[1:24:21] there's no travel of soul
[1:24:23] but when you're broken
[1:24:26] right now i have
[1:24:29] my sons and
[1:24:30] grandchildren and so on like that
[1:24:32] and i as as a grandparent
[1:24:35] would want the children to be filled
[1:24:37] with the holy ghost
[1:24:38] be granted to be filled with the holy
[1:24:40] ghost
[1:24:41] i have to pray for them
[1:24:43] i have to be concerned about them i just
[1:24:44] say well you know because they are my
[1:24:45] children or grandchildren and take it
[1:24:47] for no no no i have to believe god that
[1:24:50] god will do something special for them
[1:24:52] because what what what they need i can't
[1:24:54] give them
[1:24:55] god alone could give them so then you
[1:24:58] have to pray with a burden
[1:25:00] and and say same thing with the church
[1:25:03] if i could have give it to you guilty
[1:25:04] already
[1:25:05] wha why hold him about four
[1:25:07] uh every service i come holding back
[1:25:09] i don't want it i share i'm feeling
[1:25:11] selfish no
[1:25:12] the bible said the kingdom is preached
[1:25:14] and heavy man
[1:25:15] [Music]
[1:25:17] let's continue
[1:25:19] every man
[1:25:20] uh-huh i thought the preacher bringing
[1:25:22] bring and bring in bringing
[1:25:24] because he said no minister could bring
[1:25:26] a revival
[1:25:27] we have for 45 years and we're ready
[1:25:29] rival he said the people have to bring
[1:25:31] it
[1:25:31] so i always understood the vision have
[1:25:34] to be transferred to the people
[1:25:36] and when you see the vision nobody could
[1:25:37] stop you no pass it could stop you i'm
[1:25:40] worshiping no nobody can stop you from
[1:25:41] approaching your god
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:46] like we say the president of america or
[1:25:48] even prime minister trailer their
[1:25:50] children when the children come they'd
[1:25:52] rather wait uh waiting or eating my
[1:25:55] child
[1:25:56] everywhere you know that a man child
[1:25:58] i come and see daddy
[1:26:01] that opening door oh your son is here to
[1:26:03] you your daughter's here to you
[1:26:05] so when you in your condition go to the
[1:26:07] father
[1:26:08] angels had to say like a son come and
[1:26:10] look at baxter as everybody coming
[1:26:14] see life she life terrible but she's
[1:26:16] coming there's you're right
[1:26:18] there's the father you're going to
[1:26:20] he can be president of the country he
[1:26:21] could be the ceo he could be whatever he
[1:26:23] is he could be not meeting he said daddy
[1:26:25] i want to talk to you sign a meeting
[1:26:27] this is an emergency he said okay he
[1:26:29] will stop the meeting because you have
[1:26:30] that son that your daughter
[1:26:33] so that was having us that's almost shut
[1:26:35] down for one sinner
[1:26:38] [Applause]
[1:26:41] when i say not come to repentantly hold
[1:26:42] him rejoicing
[1:26:44] they say oh they hear that look she's
[1:26:45] repenting only hear that look at
[1:26:47] repenting
[1:26:50] he will leave the 90 and nine to go
[1:26:51] after one
[1:26:53] that's heaven's behavior
[1:26:55] and said when the last name coming how
[1:26:57] do you not know your neighbor is not the
[1:26:59] last one
[1:27:00] door is shut everything is fixed after
[1:27:02] that
[1:27:03] you have to keep reaching out
[1:27:06] for christ up today i got an article i
[1:27:08] was sharing my wife they were seeing
[1:27:09] people
[1:27:10] they see they had some experiment with
[1:27:12] thousands of old people over 60
[1:27:15] those who give money and those who give
[1:27:16] service and he said the people that give
[1:27:18] service to others live longer
[1:27:20] than those who just give money
[1:27:23] those are helping each helping this one
[1:27:25] and they go into this home helping this
[1:27:26] one help in other words the joy of being
[1:27:29] selfless the joy of serving the joy of
[1:27:33] doing this extending life
[1:27:35] than just passing the books
[1:27:39] yesterday
[1:27:40] science community
[1:27:44] what brought them to life is
[1:27:46] living for others
[1:27:48] so when you as you you yourself and
[1:27:49] myself and i you know what's going on
[1:27:51] there your life's shortening
[1:27:54] don't let the gospel i just see it
[1:27:57] all right let's go
[1:28:02] you can say a little more tonight
[1:28:04] let me stretch a little bit now just a
[1:28:06] little bit
[1:28:09] if you notice
[1:28:11] the subconscious is where you live
[1:28:19] that is where
[1:28:21] you yourself live
[1:28:23] and that's the reason it's hard for them
[1:28:25] to have feet
[1:28:26] they say yes i could fit
[1:28:28] but down here some literally it's not
[1:28:30] for you
[1:28:32] you hear any words so you can go free
[1:28:34] yeah i know i know i know but don't you
[1:28:35] say no you can't go free
[1:28:40] because you have a conscience
[1:28:41] i never subconscious
[1:28:43] you're conscious hearing the word and
[1:28:44] your conscious want to agree with the
[1:28:45] word your conscience want to receive the
[1:28:47] word you can't just want to agree and
[1:28:49] work with the word but you're
[1:28:50] subconsciously in something else
[1:28:53] but you don't know what going through
[1:28:57] watch
[1:29:00] that's it friends
[1:29:02] oh just keep doing it
[1:29:04] many times in the meeting
[1:29:06] i noticed in the meeting watching these
[1:29:07] tips they will come back to the lines
[1:29:08] for the of this interment the people
[1:29:10] will be sitting there look like they are
[1:29:12] million miles away they don't think
[1:29:14] they're not even thinking about healing
[1:29:16] it's not their intellect is their
[1:29:17] subconscious working
[1:29:20] then he said your subconscious is your
[1:29:22] soul
[1:29:30] body
[1:29:32] spirit
[1:29:33] soul
[1:29:35] and that is why
[1:29:37] when somebody dies their human spirit
[1:29:39] breaks up
[1:29:40] and that human spirit is where you have
[1:29:42] cxe gc doctor degree
[1:29:44] ceo
[1:29:46] all your position your nice house your
[1:29:47] nice car all that's inside that spirit
[1:29:49] here
[1:29:50] when that breaks up now this soul comes
[1:29:52] up
[1:29:53] what you really are
[1:29:56] at the subconscious level
[1:29:58] the subconscious is really you
[1:30:02] the subconscious is really where the
[1:30:04] heart is at
[1:30:06] as a man think
[1:30:09] in his
[1:30:10] heart
[1:30:12] or his subconscious who is he
[1:30:14] see if you think you can't make it you
[1:30:15] can't
[1:30:17] if you think you could make it you could
[1:30:18] make it
[1:30:19] because that's in your heart
[1:30:21] hallelujah and caleb said i brought wood
[1:30:22] as it was in my heart
[1:30:24] so those other ministers couldn't
[1:30:26] deceive him
[1:30:27] because he had an awareness
[1:30:29] and a consciousness of the promise of
[1:30:31] god
[1:30:32] that was more powerful of any enemy any
[1:30:34] giant
[1:30:36] david also had the same thing
[1:30:38] he never met goliath before he shall cut
[1:30:40] your head off even without a sword he
[1:30:42] was so convinced because he was
[1:30:44] operating at the subconscious level
[1:30:49] on the subconscious level already no
[1:30:50] victory
[1:30:55] oh glory to god i just love it tonight
[1:30:58] david no one stone will do but you take
[1:31:00] up five and he ran to me goliath
[1:31:03] just won he needs it nobody take up five
[1:31:07] but he ran to me goliath he was
[1:31:09] operating on the subconscious level
[1:31:11] we get into something oh glory to god
[1:31:14] hallelujah brother branham says
[1:31:17] um
[1:31:18] no no not long ago to show a perfect god
[1:31:20] word is the bible says a man taken in
[1:31:22] his heart is that right the old time
[1:31:24] infidel users say no isn't that crazy
[1:31:26] there is no mental faculties in a manner
[1:31:29] little pump that bloods blood but last
[1:31:31] year he said the big hairline science
[1:31:33] found this listen to this as found in
[1:31:35] the human heart there's a little
[1:31:37] compartment that doesn't even have blood
[1:31:39] cells in it
[1:31:41] it isn't in the animal it's only in the
[1:31:44] human it's the occupant of the soul
[1:31:47] so when a man does think from his heart
[1:31:49] god was right
[1:31:50] oh glory to god so therefore there has
[1:31:53] become a consciousness i'm gonna be
[1:31:54] healed i'm gonna be delivered tonight is
[1:31:56] my night
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:04] it is amazing and this is subconscious
[1:32:07] i i decided to take a walk from where i
[1:32:08] lived arima
[1:32:10] to go up you know instead of driving and
[1:32:12] sit down walk think about 20 minutes and
[1:32:13] i'm walking i'm walking i want to walk
[1:32:15] up and i want to walk back down so i
[1:32:16] walk up into the bank come back down
[1:32:18] when i started coming right inside the
[1:32:19] fall
[1:32:20] i hadn't seen the rains on a wonderful
[1:32:23] field to complete to go back to walk
[1:32:25] back as rain falling and reaching a taxi
[1:32:28] stand where i could take attacks and go
[1:32:29] home i had a choice
[1:32:30] take attacks and go home or keep walking
[1:32:32] i keep walking i ain't going like you
[1:32:34] and after i pass like 80m around there
[1:32:36] not knowing
[1:32:37] i said look at that now boy what if i
[1:32:40] jump in that car i break my whole spirit
[1:32:42] i want to do this thing because my body
[1:32:44] need it
[1:32:46] i feel good
[1:32:48] i say look at that in life sometimes the
[1:32:49] choices you make i had a choice the taxi
[1:32:52] sun is there rain is falling wasn't
[1:32:53] falling hard but there's a choice i
[1:32:55] could come heavy something i mean come
[1:32:56] over here you know
[1:32:58] you'll come here you know rain drizzling
[1:33:00] it'll come heavier you know but i forget
[1:33:01] that
[1:33:02] i decide i want to walk i gonna keep on
[1:33:04] walking and i just walk straight through
[1:33:06] that
[1:33:07] you know what doing that is the level of
[1:33:09] the subconscious at work there if you're
[1:33:11] consciously watching the rain oh god
[1:33:12] ring go forward whether you had umbrella
[1:33:13] open up and whatnot i am not i'm walking
[1:33:16] many times that happen you go past your
[1:33:18] consciousness
[1:33:19] it's not what your eyes see
[1:33:21] it's what you deserve from what your eye
[1:33:23] sees not what you hear is what you
[1:33:25] deserve are we talking about delilah
[1:33:28] what samson didn't see is how the devil
[1:33:30] usually like you know
[1:33:32] she nice she good she look pretty
[1:33:34] everything else here you know and she's
[1:33:36] a nice person of good intention
[1:33:38] but the demon behind she had no good
[1:33:39] intention
[1:33:40] he intend to strip samson
[1:33:43] and the demon seed is a channel he could
[1:33:44] use
[1:33:45] so keep on fellowship and keep on going
[1:33:48] he will cut your head off
[1:33:54] don't be fooling
[1:33:56] a word flick like i don't know like oil
[1:34:01] but you lead into hell
[1:34:03] okay so watch so right
[1:34:08] all right so we're almost done thank you
[1:34:10] lord again
[1:34:14] i think we're almost done
[1:34:17] no
[1:34:19] tomorrow night you do you come and
[1:34:21] listen a while because you want to take
[1:34:23] our time and lay that word out so close
[1:34:26] that the devil won't even have a little
[1:34:28] speck of room to move
[1:34:29] and when you let your faith run to its
[1:34:32] end
[1:34:33] till hear this you begin to believe
[1:34:36] and let your subconscious go to acting
[1:34:38] then the fate of god will back it up
[1:34:43] so you come you let your feet run out
[1:34:46] until you come to the place where you
[1:34:47] begin to believe
[1:34:48] like i love the words he used he said
[1:34:50] when abram came to the fullness of
[1:34:52] believing
[1:34:53] so there are different degrees of
[1:34:54] believing you come into the fullness of
[1:34:57] belief and this promise is yours that
[1:34:59] when you understand you're not a serpent
[1:35:00] seed
[1:35:02] you're not a devil child then
[1:35:06] you are son your daughter and you cannot
[1:35:09] be denied
[1:35:12] even the backstage cannot be denied
[1:35:16] even if you're full you cannot be denied
[1:35:19] you have to understand it by revelation
[1:35:22] so when you say father coming home
[1:35:23] you're coming home you know
[1:35:25] because you know who your father is
[1:35:28] because your faith won't do too much he
[1:35:30] said your subconscious has to move in
[1:35:33] the direction your faith is moving and
[1:35:35] then god move faith moves behind him and
[1:35:38] confirms it
[1:35:44] the reason of a lie detector is because
[1:35:46] man wasn't made a lie
[1:35:48] so when they put the instrument on you
[1:35:50] and ask your question and what not on
[1:35:51] your and muslims have to do what kind of
[1:35:53] thing so they know like
[1:35:57] because your body wasn't made to lie
[1:35:59] why because it's picking up it at the
[1:36:02] level of your subconscious
[1:36:06] here this one i'll just hit the
[1:36:07] highlights here now
