be seated god bless you and welcome to this time and the presence of the Lord and singing that song Steve away I guess most of you was afraid about it - angèle sadder serious real quick say the worst one in 20 years 6.4 I'm eating just about 7.1 and I'm thinking about it good quick we have in here we haven't had a spiritual retreat praise God nothing is by chance now oh yes what if dos ángeles go down this week it changes everything yeah you'd realize how real this message is what this profit in the spirit realm went up and saw and where we supposed to be for such a time as this what kind of

precious but a solemn and a Gina from Ghana I'm gonna stick you this morning and you know many times people think being a leader you have to have a title a post a position but it's not really so I want to show you that you are called to lead you here this morning you you the people leaden is the behavior its attitude oh praise the name of the Lord the Bur mom says a minister now a minister cannot being a revival there is no preacher can being a revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can do is to be loyal to God and with his word and the revival has to come by the people in your home in your life revival isn't adding new members to the church is reviving what we have already got so when the church get in a rut we need a revival it doesn't have new but it changes and under what is already dear or glory to God and then he said isn't it strange that God would want the people to have patented it when Jesus looked out into the harvest he said the harvest is ripe the laborers are few you pray the lord of the harvest that was him you pray to me that I will send laborers into my harvest it is some part you have to do God is waiting for his church to call on him so you say you written on God and go reason the new his church to call on him he always did it God is waiting today for the people to call his servant into action so you hold a key every prayer every praise every right life and attitude there is a part in this glorious program that get caught servants into action listen to this he said God is waiting for the people to call his civil interaction and the servant can't get into action till the people please o blessed be the name of the Lord we believe that then he said what we see happen should put every soul in action it should make a church that will make a revival Iain Phoenix that people will be flying from Europe to see what taken place they will say there's a place in Arizona called Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix there is something broke out there until the seven thunders of Revelation ten that are not even written in the Bible is being manifested so there's a prophecy hanging over you for a manifestation of God or glory to God that there be a genuine witness that he is raised from the dead Oh hallelujah oh we appreciate that service last night but the daily or glory not brought it up or some day yesterday

I wish I could just move on Alleluia but what a time we have in Trinidad what can we say about yesterday the presence of the Lord the love of God the sweet fellowship of the Prairie this is what a prophet came for there's going to be a bride and there is a bride that was prophecy but this is the manifestation of what the Prophet SAW from different nations we don't come from Trinidad I don't

one Accord I was telling him that Avondale last night I said we see you on the TV you know we watch him with the Terios singing group and we're gonna enjoy but to see the man and shake his hand is a blessing and one of these days we are all gonna be never to party anymore water fellowship my precious brother my precious sister there's no gonna be no group there is going to be one sweet spirit hallelujah sister hope toward a profit this is what you preach this is the Holy Ghost soon and very soon amen so but once we are here we are now different locations we are defending the gospel we are defending the message we are keeping the devil away because there is a bride there is a bright body and we are sure part of that body this morning it means I want to salute on behalf of the church and my family and my wife will salute but the whole video at the church and all the offices and the local church here god bless you and thank you for having us I'm gonna salute all the ministers that has gone before me brother Chandler and relatively and all those that will come after me and those that I here this morning with their churches I'm certainly not ready to be here by just following on my lot to be here amen so to shoot the messenger now Alleluia I'm just here as a messenger of the Lord to bring you a message our main is that if you have a problem meet the one who sent the message but I trust this morning we are gonna enjoy ourselves so as we stand to our feet this morning shall we go straight to the word Matthew chapter 13 read verse 30 39 42 41 you know Jesus talking about the parable of the sower like into the kingdom of God rest a teaser let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles and bend them but gather the wheat into my barn verse 39 the enemy that sowed them is the devil the one that stood the test now is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the Reapers are the Angels amen verse 40 and I was there for the tests are carried and been in the fire so shall it be in the end of this well the Son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them that which do iniquity Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 and to that to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted made a lord are a blessing to the ring of his word you may please be seated a man I trust us you see give him praise here to worship Him he's the only one that deserves our praise and worship so this morning for a title the manifestation is the interpretation hallelujah what is in the ground let it come to the manifestation then it will give itself the interpretation my subject is at the appointed time and obviously the inspiration the harvest time hallelujah so the Prophet said this morning and I want to read from blasphemous names he said now coming from the Holy Spirit what is come then he will give you sue unnatural fate amen spiritual faith that here at the bottom then that's spiritual faith recognizes only the word no matter what anybody sees it turns to no good hallelujah the manifestation will only recognize the word which would be the interpretation it's not going to be theory is what the way it said but at where has an appointed time to be manifested it has an appointed time to be vindicated and you cannot let that weight come at the time that it is not appointed is that Abraham I will visit you according to the time of life and Sarah your wife will have a son now there had to be a time of life no matter how you know Abraham was in a hurry to have that son they had to come that appointed time that appointed season for Sarah to get in that condition to receive that child hallelujah Abraham was a man of faith but the appointed time had to come and it was according to God's own time Abraham could him push it for it to go here to contain 25 years on the promise it shall be it shall be I'm gonna have a son why God said so hallelujah hallelujah they opposition her to come the critics had to come but God hath spoken it and Abraham received a spiritual faith he wasn't looking at the circumstance of Sarah and this bride receives a promise hallelujah that is coming for a bride that bride is going to come for nothing will stop her hallelujah she is called she is predestinated she's ordained to come forth hallelujah but that bride cannot comfort until the appointed time but thank God this is the appointed time because we have gone through the denominational period hallelujah you may be seated but Abram said Amen that the way three group that way plantain and when you plant you are looking for the harvest you're not interested in the crop how beautiful the green crop is your focus is at the end what you are going to read from that crop hallelujah so three groups were planted when Abraham said Oral Roberts King he may I with me this morning on a road SK kilos wonky the Prophet came and they all planted and the Prophet that you wonder why you don't hear about Bill agree how many more you wonder why don't hear about Oral Roberts anymore is that an evil mind is the deadness of them all but it was gone into the ground it not being planted for a manifestation for a manifestation today you see the denominations are growing Indian numbers and numbers and numbers why it is a harvest time because a denominational seed was sold and now they are opinion numbers they were interested in the numbers they have the numbers but brother is coming for the price and that probably a minority but up prior her power that Brad wah power power from the Holy Ghost not power from her groups not power from denomination but power of the resurrected Christ but in the life of man again oh these signs shall follow them that believe the science follow the believer you may be seated so the Prophet said they were planted denominational sees were planted truble agree humming or aerobics so we see people you know coming into the machine like they used to you know the seeds have been planted and the profits that that bride will be in a minority because she'll be the Wed only hallelujah because she's gonna take back one her husband is and her husband is the word she knows no man made three hallelujah o blessed be the name of a living God and the Bible said and his bride has made herself what his wife Christ's wife not a man's wife Christ's wife and I'm looking at the wife of Christ today Oh glory be to the Living God some from Ghana some from Nigeria some from Trinidad what are we doing we're making ourselves ready for that bridegroom Oh glory be to the Living God so the prophet left the word in there hallelujah and he said he left a promise that the seven thunders will Cara the bride member dovi read this morning about how people were planning to see it manifested but there has to be a Katherine first hallelujah that is our seat after the prophets finish with the Pentecostals he still had to be three kinds of believers amen three kinds of believers that was coming three kinds of believers are left Pentecost bolita prophet but three kinds of believers but in death as believer best make believer that's unbeliever but the promise is to the believer that promise of the resurrection of Jesus Christ is to the believer Alleluia and the profit of the promise there wait till them seven thunders so there's a waiting for an appointed time for these seven thunders to alter their voices to that group this is a special group the pride group the pride group the elected group the chosen group the attain group the predestinated group that group that knows no man's greed wait till them seven thunders and what is the toughness Christ Himself the cup stole the headstone and he's coming for the harvest the harvest of the bride that I've waited long enough or to get a hot July Sun hot July Sun you might have wanted it in January but it's not time hallelujah you murabba wonder if in April but it was in time Oh glory to God that July Sun had to count and when he came it was time for the harvest is that come on the reapers let them put the sickle in before the enemy can do more damage and we are promised that is dynamics to our mechanics so all that we receive was mechanics hallelujah the Busan teams were mechanics but brother in the mechanical church members they were unbelievers they were big believers brother but the heavens had to come to separate a shock to separate a big believer to separate the unbeliever and to leave that bride alone because the Prophet said that bride has the material on the earth or to overcome that bride has the material on the earth to make you to perfection that bride has the material right now Oh glory be to the Living God to bring for the manifestation of the Holy Spirit that is why we are shouting we are not shouting because we are funny we are shouting because we know we have a revelation that our word is unfolded that our word is unveiled that God is unveiled in the word Oh give him prison small [Music] hallelujah hallelujah but a problem restore the Son of man reveal the son of man hallelujah and the Pharisees came tempting Jesus he's a wench on this the kingdom of God come Jesus told them it cometh not with observation there's no one day churches 1000 people then the kingdom is coming hallelujah I said they would tell you though here this is the man of the hour I said no don't listen to that hallelujah he's in a secret place thank you for unprotected the password [Applause] hallelujah I'm had a man I like a man that and protects himself you have nothing to hide I want you lock key down man there's some secret thing going on there hallelujah he said in the secret place I don't good here because the kingdom of God is within you that son of mine has been revealed is within you now and Brahm revealed the son of man as promises only to the bride the Prophet had to come be seated and tie up the loose ends of the entire Bible because the word will judge the world so judgment warning has to come before judgment so the pentecostal need to know the restore the full restored way to reject it then they can be jacked by that way the unbeliever has to see and know that the wear has been fully restored to reject it and then be jacked by that way so God sent the Prophet to tie up every loose end so Methodist has no excuse Catholic has no excuse the Pope has these books he has no excuse hallelujah but that was in their promise the promise was for the bride so after tying up the loose ends he then released the Son of Man as promises hallelujah and Peter said by these promises you become partakers of the divine nature of God divine nature divine me that you have nothing to do with it Mary had nothing to do with it be done to me according to your word I have nothing to do with it no man has nothing to do with the divine nature of God the problem revealing us promises and on the horizon the world God is obligated come on now pick back to do this more God is obligated at the appointed time to watch you suffer - what you get confused though he is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises hallelujah hallelujah on the basis of the promises and the profit outside of those promises you have catch yourself off Oh glory be to the Living God that is why when I really say the seven thunders shall gather the bride I'm looking wherever the brightest got it I know the seven thunders is being manifested that is the manifestation of the prophets prophesy because he spoke it but the thunders who got her the bride the thunders will show her how to prepare how to escape the judgment hard to escape false Christ how to escape false anointed who the tenders will show that bright how to prepare oh and we are grading the ruptor we shall be chained at pandas who show their pride and give that bride the great translation fake is heat to the world but review to the bride ooh hallelujah hallelujah it doesn't stop there he said the seven thunders would be the price we Viva so when the shock pulls away in the message we can have a revival because the seven thunders would have gathered you together showing you how to prepare giving you faith to know that you are gonna be chained nobody can hold you down no principality can hold you down you have a revelation Oh glory be to the Living God hallelujah hallelujah then when you begin to shout because you know the Son of Man is revealed the world will not understand a bunch of noisemakers but you have a revelation you know why you are shouted you know why you are rejoicing because the seven thunders give you a revival there is something kicking in your heart in your soul you can't keep still when the Son of man came riding into Jerusalem brother they couldn't help it they are to shout they are to rejoice because the word was riding into Jerusalem and the unbeliever aldershot that no hado revelation said tell these people to keep quiet jesus said I cannot do that I cannot do that if I do that these rocks will cry out the rock is gonna cry in my place the rock is gonna rejoice in my place the rock is gonna shout in my place Alleluia I'm gonna shout I'm gonna praise him because I have a revelation I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb I've been redeemed and set aside for such a time as this for the manifestation Oh blessed be the name of a living God hallelujah and I have a revelation that worship worship worship precedes the Holy Spirit Oh blessed be the name of a Living God that is why we are worshiping that is why we are praise it because worship precedes the Holy Spirit you want to know what other Holy Ghost is here the manifestation is the interpretation hallelujah when you get to a place brother brother went to a place one time and they said the people are making too much noise but a bronzy if there is no noise i cannot preach hallelujah Oh glory be to the Living God hallelujah Paul said the way they call heresy that is the way I I not your neighbor not your mama not your Papa that is how I I I worship worship the God of my father's that is how I praise Him that is why I worship Him Oh hallelujah imma look funny brother but that stone was a funny stone it was an odd stone oh but they needed it at the end of it it became the capstone became the headstone when the building was complete they had to look for a capstone or they remember the funny stone they rejected some time ago Oh glory to God but this rejected stone has become the headstone of the corner or it is marvelous in our eyes today it is marvelous in our eyes today or give him praise hallelujah Oh glory be to the Living God hallelujah hallelujah so that Son of Man is here as promises that is why I love the promises Oh glory to God amen I guess you are all parents most of your appearance here and you have children you may be seated when you make a promise your child hallelujah hey man I mean sister Wendy was telling us we don't promise the children you would take them out then they can sleep it's not time yet to go what what time I will leave it because they are holding on to a promise so Jesus told the disciples tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high oh brother they couldn't wait for that power because not Mandarin promises God promises they lock themselves there they were tri-c's but they were waiting on the promise of the vara and suddenly suddenly suddenly suddenly they came a sound when they were not expecting suddenly they came a sound not from the air not from a group no from the man of the hour suddenly they came a sound from heaven they came a sound from heaven or like a Russian yarmulke stop it no man could block it it came from heaven as of a rushing mighty mighty powerful wind Oh glory be to the Living God and it filled the house it filled a house where they were set it when that power comes Michael stop it when the power come no group can stop it when the power comes no body no situation no circumstance Oh hallelujah your situation cannot even stop it whether you are ready or not your name is in that book Michael himself will step down and the liver and the liver and the liver every name in the book and the Bible said at that day that was prophecy I said today today Michael is here to deliver every name every name every name every name in the book is gonna be delivered this is the appointed time glory to Corey man hallelujah who said that my father promised that and I can't wait for the promise to be manifested I can't wait for the promise to be vindicated it is my promise and when it was spoken it was a seat hallelujah hallelujah but the seed has an appointed time to come to a manifestation and this is the hour for the manifestation of whatever promise was given by my father who and he said there the dynamics of this change the dynamics of this church of this church of this church the dynamics of this change power of this church the supernatural power of this church will be a revealing of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a little measure so every minute I'm shouting I'm getting my revealing I'm getting my revealing every service is a measure every service is a measure one day I will get you the full measure Oh glory be to the Living God and when you break out come on Satan a son of God on display now that you cannot fight that you cannot argue with that you cannot debate that Oh glory be to the Living God when the day of Pentecost was fully come they took notice of Peter and it said men and brethren what shall we do hallelujah you know say repent change your mind change your thinking change your expectation hallelujah ooh and get my pies come back to the word hallelujah submit yourself to the word submit yourself under that word because our word was given at the beginning for your defense it was given at the beginning for your liberation it was given at the beginning for your fortification come down under that word and when you stand by that word that way will speak for you that word has power because that word is God that where is God himself and

oh and he's with us today he is with us today he said where two or three I got it a minor and I am with him oh he's here this morning he's here this morning oh I have no doubt this morning we are

it is it interprets itself a virgin shall conceive now a virgin conceived and brought for Christ but one said that don't need no interpretation his pocket Merrick brought forth that was the manifestation of the interpretation of Isaiah's prophecy params are nothing shadowy just a genuine unadulterated Word of God that is sons and daughters of God who is not born by the will of man or by a shaking of hand or some form of baptism but born of the Spirit of God by the Holy Spirit and the word manifested itself through them that is the genuine seed of God that is what goes into the harvest that the Holy Ghost can work through we're true we're true manifests in the word of the Living God that is the seed of God Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen now listen number drum continues in the seed of discrepancy amen he said but they finally came forth until proof is that by the finally came forth until both of two seeds the seed of discrepancy and the seed of God they put forth their genuine heads amen that wound up in Judas Iscariot and in Jesus Christ for he was the son of God Christ now he was the beginning of the creation of God he was nothing less than God and Judas is Carlos was born the son of perdition came from Hell returned back to hell the truth harvest time our scripture let both grow together at the harvest time at the showdown the manifestation will be the interpretation at that harvest time ah man but Abraham said amen Judas in his discrepancy was the seed of the devil come to the well for deceit am i preaching to somebody is born hallelujah Judas had a purpose Judas had a commission Jesus had a commission to you both seats so in the heart of men hallelujah also don't worry about what is going on in the message the elect will come to the hedge - nothing will stop the elect no matter how downtrodden how rejected how cut away they will come to the h2 called the up predestinated - it hallelujah Judas in his discrepancy was the seed of the table come to the world for this seat just like he was at the beginning Cain his former father Judas only play Church Judas knew how to clap and sing and dance and do all those which was though experienced with the Holy Ghost rather he wasn't really sincere he didn't actually have faith he have Evie had Hyrum never betrayed Jesus but see he sowed the seed of discrepancy he thought he could make friends with the world when there's no believer I can wear some pants he thought he could make friends with the world maman and have fellowship with Jesus but it was too late for him to do anything about it when the death hour came when he did this evil thing he crossed a separation line between going forward and retaining back all glory this is real there was a rupture your fate is on the tapes all that you need to make heaven is here order you need to gather Holy Ghost is here when the dead hour came when he did this evil thing he crossed the separation line between going forward and returning back he had to go on in the way that he went as a deceiver he sowed the seed of discrepancy he tried to find favor with those great big organizations of the day with the Pharisees and Sadducees and thought he would make himself some piece of money he will be popular among the people if he doesn't if he doesn't consume any people to get in that discrepancy trying to find a fever with man let's find favor with God this morning let me find favor with God not with man but that was what Judas done when this discrepancy headed up in him and we know that Jesus was the word st. John once said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us then the weight is a seed then the seed become flesh and dwelt among us if G if Judas was the seed of the enemy and discrepancy it also became flesh and dwelt among us in the passion of Judas Iscariot's the prophet s spirits don't die so they asked Jesus when will the kingdom come Jesus told them as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed remember before then they will tell you here don't go for cementing to follow I mean then the word is a seed then the word become flesh and blood among us Christ now if Judas was the seed of the enemy or amino acid of the enemy and the discrepancy it also became flesh and dwelt among us in the person of Jesus Judas Iscariot he never had no real faith Judas had no faith he had a make-believe fake man romanza he had he thought he had faith there is no such a thing as having faith in a big belief faith one like in church one leg in the world pride material hundred percent red material hot July Sun will green up as young people in those days they are blasting you

sit upon the head he gave it in the half of his children so go sow the seed of the habit in your heart his children his family to keep that word that was their only defense keep that way here come the
