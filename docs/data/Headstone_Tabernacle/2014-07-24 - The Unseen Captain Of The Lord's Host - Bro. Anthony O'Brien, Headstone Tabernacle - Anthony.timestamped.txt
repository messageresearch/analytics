[19:53] hallelujah amen isaac praise God raise
[19:57] the standard praise God hallelujah
[20:01] amen amen hallelujah
[20:08] and my subject is the angel with a
[20:11] little book open and my inspiration is
[20:14] the spirit of Elijah doth rest upon
[20:17] Elisha
[20:18] amen amen amen that's what we're under
[20:21] expectation for but that same spirit
[20:24] that spoke to the prophet when the
[20:26] prophet didn't know he was wondering
[20:28] where all these visions come from where
[20:30] did all these dreams come from there in
[20:32] a cave praying and he wanted to know if
[20:34] it was a devil if it was the Lord he
[20:37] didn't know he was so confused and then
[20:39] all of a sudden Brother Abraham saw a
[20:41] light come down into the room and that
[20:43] light begin to swirl and that light
[20:45] begin to swirl and out of that light
[20:48] stepped a man he said "A man could have
[20:50] been about 200 lb." He said "I am the
[20:53] angel of the Lord sent from the presence
[20:55] of the Lord to tell you that your
[20:57] strange and particular birth is for a
[21:00] purpose."
[21:02] Hallelujah
[21:04] glory to God oh man could speak to you
[21:08] your mother could speak to you come on
[21:09] now your brother could encourage you
[21:12] your sister could send a word of advice
[21:14] but it's something else when the angel
[21:16] of the Lord speaks to you
[21:20] personally that's a whole other thing
[21:22] entirely we try to encourage people we
[21:25] try to keep on pressing but it's
[21:27] something entirely different when the
[21:29] angel of the Lord makes his appearance
[21:32] when he makes his presence known to you
[21:35] when you know for yourself that you
[21:38] didn't come to church just by chance but
[21:40] you were summoned by an angel to come
[21:43] into the presence of God to receive the
[21:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[21:49] fire that's what you come for and I'm
[21:52] not going home without it i'm not going
[21:54] back without it i come too far i cannot
[21:58] turn back

[22:16] another dimension how can you go back to
