[26:42] city for without at dogs and Sorcerers
[26:45] and hungers and murderers idolators and
[26:48] who whosoever love it and make it a lie
[26:51] I Jesus have sent my angel to testify
[26:54] unto you these things in the churches I
[26:56] am the root and offspring of David and
[26:58] the the bright and morning star and the
[27:00] spirit in the bright say come let him

[27:04] thirst come and whosoever will let him
[27:06] take the Water of Life freely for I
[27:09] testify unto every man that he the words
[27:12] of the prophecy of this book If any man
[27:16] shall add unto these things God shall
[27:20] add unto him the plagues that are
[27:22] written in this book and if any man
[27:25] shall take away from the words of the
[27:27] book of this prophecy
[27:29] God shall take away his part out of the
[27:32] book of life and out of the holy city
[27:35] and from the things which are written in
[27:36] this book he that testified these things
[27:39] sayth surely I come quickly amen even so
[27:43] come Lord Jesus let us pray father we
[27:45] thank you for your word tonight and Lord
[27:47] I'm so needy of you and I pray that you
[27:49] would help me Lord and take me out of
[27:51] the way and all the different things may
[27:54] you place it together and present this
[27:56] Vision this picture of your present
[27:58] tense doings and Revelations father
[28:01] Grant it Lord in Jesus name I ask it
[28:04] amen and amen you may be seated praise
[28:08] God Amen so tonight I have a title
[28:13] judgments and
[28:15] rewards that's a title I have tonight
[28:18] judgments and
[28:21] rewards now God never brings any man to
[28:24] his debt without first warning him about
[28:27] it telling him something he knocks on
[28:30] the man heart man may have a funny
[28:32] feeling whatever but God and and and
[28:35] this is it God does nothing without
[28:38] declaring it first what he's going to do
[28:41] because it is his nature to do that it
[28:46] is God's nature to warn a man before
[28:49] judgment or to warn a nation before
[28:52] judgment or want a church or individual
[28:55] it doesn't matter it is just his nature
[28:58] to warn he always gives his warning a
[29:01] reminder to us who have a responsibility
[29:05] and we are responsible and God put us
[29:07] here on Earth for a reason and that
[29:10] reason that he put us here for we are
[29:12] responsible to him for that reason and
[29:15] therefore it is your duty to find out
[29:17] what he wants you to do you're not
[29:20] existing here it's not by chance it's
[29:22] specific that God put you here for a
[29:25] purpose and a reason and you want to
[29:27] find out what you are here for isn't
[29:30] that right and because we have a
[29:32] responsibility we have got to answer to
[29:35] God someday for that every man that come
[29:38] on the face of the Earth has to answer
[29:40] to God for a responsibility and to many
[29:43] of us a stewardship we have to answer
[29:46] for this responsibility is a stewardship
[29:50] that has been committed to us by God I
[29:53] don't care what it is it could be a
[29:55] housewife if it's a housewife be a genu
[29:58] housewife if it is to be a farmer be a
[30:01] genuine farmer whatever it is that God
[30:04] put us put you to do you got a
[30:06] stewardship that you got to answer for
[30:09] so each one of us have a responsibility
[30:11] each one of us have a stewardship each
[30:13] one of us have the give an account some
[30:14] point in time isn't that right now watch
[30:17] first what God does he sends his
[30:19] prophets to bring warning so that's why
[30:22] God sent Malachi 4 that's why God sent
[30:25] William maram Brown to bring a warning
[30:27] to the Earth
[30:28] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[30:31] when before the great and terity of the
[30:33] Lord because that day is coming so
[30:35] before that day strikes he sends Elijah
[30:38] to bring a message and this message have
[30:40] been echoing over the through the Earth
[30:42] around the world over 50 plus years
[30:45] isn't that right this is not this Yer
[30:47] this message is not a yesterday message
[30:49] this message is way back it's years upon
[30:52] years it is known around the world isn't
[30:56] that right now watch so he find he send
[30:58] his prophets with warning he doesn't
[31:00] change his way or his method of doing
[31:03] things he does not always strike when he
[31:07] warns I want you to watch this
[31:10] quotation God gives a warning but he
[31:14] don't always strike the same time he
[31:18] warns and then the prophet is mocked he
[31:22] didn't have it he told a lie wasn't
[31:24] right and that's what it is isn't that
[31:27] right because God have a timing and man
[31:30] don't know his timing so he gave them
[31:33] the opportunity to talk and laugh and
[31:34] mock but one thing we know God can't do
[31:37] is lie once it come out the mouth of God
[31:40] it cannot return void God going to bring
[31:43] it back with something so when God sent
[31:46] for you by his word it couldn't come out
[31:48] empty you came because of the call of
[31:51] God put upon your life isn't that right
[31:54] so once there's a Vindicated Prophet
[31:55] that word got to come to pass that
[31:57] judgment the only thing could stop it he
[31:59] said is quick repentance now here we go
[32:02] tonight now this what I'm about to read
[32:04] here now is something we have read many
[32:06] times before but tonight it just struck
[32:09] me so different and I want to bring it
[32:11] back
[32:12] again now
[32:14] watch during these Church
[32:17] ages there's two Spirits working almost
[32:22] alike right down through here one is the
[32:26] denomination the other one is the Holy
[32:28] Ghost and Jesus said they will be so
[32:32] close that they would receive the very
[32:34] elected was possible here we go these
[32:38] two Spirits are marking their people for
[32:43] future
[32:45] judgment now we heard that before but
[32:47] what you think about that now these two
[32:51] Spirits are
[32:53] [Music]
[32:54] marking their people for future
[32:58] judgment in other words there is the
[33:01] Judgment of
[33:02] reward and there is the judgments of
[33:05] God hallelujah for the bride or for the
[33:09] elect you have to be judged but to be
[33:13] rewarded Hallelujah so there will to be
[33:15] judgments and there will be rewards but
[33:18] people are being marked Now isn't that
[33:20] right marked by the attitude so people
[33:23] bad attitude inside of here that that
[33:25] not hurting me any Bullhead attitude
[33:28] people don't want to Humble theel that's
[33:29] not affecting me you know that affecting
[33:31] the people according to the word I could
[33:34] judge you God will judge me but you
[33:36] can't judge me you could pray for
[33:39] me to all those who figur that Moses
[33:41] seat both here and online I want to
[33:44] judge they better be careful because
[33:46] this is
[33:47] prophecy the two Spirits are marking
[33:51] their people for future judgment Satan
[33:55] promised that he would have more than
[33:56] Christ and now watch this close now
[33:59] praise God it will be a mark in the
[34:01] people and we know the two marks going
[34:03] out the mark of God and the mark of the
[34:04] beast it's two systems two spirits that
[34:07] will be working in the framework of the

[36:10] Brother BR say you want to wear earrings
[36:11] keep wearing them you want to do this
[36:13] keep doing it that is I have to read
[36:15] that back again you know I've never
[36:17] heard the prophet say say do it go and
[36:19] do
[36:20] it you want to do it go and do it God
[36:23] will give it his have your own heart but

[36:56] okay that's what they have any message
[36:59] message folks I'm not talking about
[37:00] denomination and Pentecost I'm talking
[37:02] about message folks who think they're
[37:05] right because they're in the right group
[37:07] they think is the right group and the
[37:09] prophet Clearly say every group have
[37:10] three
[37:12] kinds so have no right kind because the
[37:16] body is Christ and by one Spirit you're
[37:18] baptized into that one body nobody in
[37:20] trainer to change that that is just the

[40:48] sees and this this what I keep thinking
[40:50] Minister say this and carry on do this
[40:52] and what and ask a question how does God
[40:54] see
[40:55] this I see parents in this church act so

[41:01] God see that I see people get
[41:03] disrespectful and judged and they're not
[41:06] even thinking they're not even
[41:07] understanding what has
[41:08] happened and I can't say a word just
[41:11] leave it alone just keep pressing on
[41:14] because they know
[41:16] better it's a
[41:18] choice so the people who came out of
[41:20] Egypt and following Moses they don't
[41:23] know this God of Abraham Isaac they
[41:25] don't know this God of Moses they come
[41:27] to the mountain now they're dancing they
[41:29] partying until when they find Moses they
[41:31] can to Long say a make us a God now gosh
[41:34] man we need a
[41:37] God then they pull out all the earrings
[41:39] gold they make a golden calf they said
[41:42] this is the god that brought us out of
[41:45] Egypt and almighty God watching them
[41:47] here in this bunch of like idiots like
[41:51] fools see Power displayed see might
[41:55] displayed see Pharaoh humiliated yes in
[41:59] front of all the other nations see the
[42:01] Reds he open up and they make their own
[42:05] god what have been preaching for years
[42:07] people making their own God in this
[42:08] message I call it the god of their own
[42:11] imagination their message God they make
[42:13] that not the god of the
[42:19] Bible so you want to tell me after God
[42:22] come down Moses come down with with with
[42:24] with the Ten Commandments written by the
[42:26] Finger of God
[42:27] Throw Down The Commandments earthquake
[42:30] bust thing open people fall inside of
[42:32] there what are the other people
[42:34] remaining to
[42:36] think that this God not
[42:38] real you see partners and friends and
[42:41] arguments and talkers and and talkers
[42:43] and Walkers and everything else gone
[42:45] down in a big hole swallowed
[42:49] up God always displays his
[42:52] power his
[42:55] judgments and we'll get it
[42:57] he did it in the early
[43:00] church it wasn't you know I have a
[43:03] disagreement with the pastor I have a
[43:04] disagree no it wasn't that you know it
[43:07] was Jesus God wanted to keep that church
[43:10] so pure that any impure had to be cut
[43:15] offall cut out judged
[43:20] out
[43:23] hallu so because man have books and
[43:26] tapes and call ministers and call
[43:28] pastors they could see anything by the
[43:29] pulpit bind the people to themselves see
[43:32] the people against a next church and
[43:33] next Ministry and what not do all of
[43:35] that and say that God that bride
[43:38] Whispering Whispering
[43:43] Whispering two Spirits are now present
[43:49] tense marking their people for future
[43:54] judgment marking people to be judged
[43:57] and mocking people to be
[43:59] sealed because you cannot be in the
[44:01] bride if you're not sealed with the Holy
[44:04] Ghost it have no bride I'm in the
[44:05] message I am bride I'm the I am the
[44:07] bride that's only
[44:09] talk that's just talk we're not here to
[44:12] present talk we here to present what god
[44:15] require of us the bride will be the Holy
[44:18] Ghost
[44:21] filled do you get that the bride is not
[44:25] who take the corona the
[44:29] vaccine that the kind of dness that they
[44:32] had I the vaccine the
[44:36] Beast everybody take
[44:41] Max that kind of
[44:43] nonsense that educated intellect people
[44:46] think that and accept that
[44:48] nonsense equate Mark of the Beast with
[44:55] vaccine what an that have to do with
[44:57] what God
[44:58] Said go talk about vaccine in the
[45:01] Bible seal all those
[45:05] who cry and for what for the Abomination
[45:09] if you are in Abomination you can't cry
[45:11] for
[45:13] that if you're living an abominable life
[45:16] you can't cry for
[45:17] that you have to come above that and
[45:20] that's why I saying it is going beyond
[45:23] the sin question
[45:28] and getting into growing as a
[45:30] Christian because God want you to hate
[45:32] what he hates and love what he loves and
[45:36] to get back where Holiness becomes a way
[45:39] of
[45:41] life not something that is mentioned in
[45:44] the message Holiness becomes a way of
[45:46] life because he is Holy he said be holy
[45:49] because I am Holy oh give the Lord some
[45:51] Praises this is message this not wesle
[45:53] sanctification this is the word of God
[45:56] oh give the Lord awesome Praises this is
[45:58] the seven drops of blood sprinkled upon
[46:01] The Mercy Seat woo Oh Glory to God and
[46:05] this Mercy Seat was extended to Seven
[46:14] Ages so endless people in this message
[46:17] of the hour are
[46:19] deceived they are deceived they're
[46:21] deceived by the same books and tapes
[46:23] that they
[46:24] believe go they feel like old
[46:28] two
[46:29] Spirits marking their people for future
[46:32] judgment you're being
[46:34] marked if you are the bride for the
[46:36] Judgment of
[46:39] rewards Prophet
[46:41] speaks and what's the matter the day
[46:43] here we go the sleeping virgin or we
[46:46] call it the foolish virgin stayed long
[46:48] enough to get part of the
[46:51] word but
[46:53] not all of the word
[46:56] the deceived Church says long enough to
[46:58] get part of the word but not all of the
[47:02] word he had but and they were sincere
[47:05] and honest about it but they were
[47:08] deceived
[47:10] sincere
[47:11] honest
[47:14] deceived let's
[47:16] go Noah was a sign of Deliverance to his
[47:21] people and a sign of judgment to the
[47:23] Lost
[47:25] World Moses was a sign of
[47:29] Deliverance and a judgment to
[47:32] Egypt both wrapped up in the same
[47:36] man isn't that
[47:39] something Noah was a sign of Deliverance
[47:41] to his people a sign of judgment to the
[47:43] Lost World the
[47:45] unbeliever the very Waters that choked
[47:48] the world and drown the world was the
[47:52] only means of saving Noah
[47:57] the only thing that could save him was
[48:01] the
[48:01] Judgment but that's a powerful
[48:07] statement for nor to be saved the rain
[48:09] of to
[48:11] fall The Rain Fallen means the world
[48:14] being
[48:15] judged Noah salvation was judgment to
[48:19] everybody
[48:21] else the water is what was needed to
[48:25] raise the ark yes and that water was
[48:27] coming to
[48:29] kill so we talk about
[48:32] Dynamics we talking about the Holy Ghost
[48:36] the same Holy Ghost taking another bride
[48:37] killing the world you know judge the
[48:39] world

[48:47] dispensation do you understand the
[48:49] Gentile dispensation closes with the
[48:52] bride being

[1:00:26] oh praise God I want to turn to Acts
[1:00:29] chapter 5 for the scripture
[1:00:31] reading and we verse
[1:00:35] one acts 5 ver1 it says don't know they
[1:00:40] could get this in the back a certain man
[1:00:41] named anas his Sapphire's wife sto a
[1:00:45] possession kept back part of the price
[1:00:49] his wife also being privit so she know
[1:00:51] what's going on and brought a certain
[1:00:53] part and laid it at the Apostles feet
[1:00:57] but Peter said
[1:00:59] ananas why has Satan filled thy heart to
[1:01:04] lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back
[1:01:07] part of the price of the land whil it
[1:01:11] remain was it not thine own after it was
[1:01:15] sold was it not thine own power why H
[1:01:18] has thou conceived this thing in thine
[1:01:20] heart thou Hast not lied unto men but
[1:01:24] unto God so the thought was a man the
[1:01:26] lon to because the custom
[1:01:28] Lon a lion anointing was back
[1:01:31] there all right annias hearing these
[1:01:35] words fell down give up The Ghost and
[1:01:40] great fear came on all them that heard
[1:01:43] these things this a happen yet but it's
[1:01:46] going to
[1:01:48] happen six and the young men arose wed
[1:01:51] him up carry him out and buried him it
[1:01:53] was about a space of 3 hours after his
[1:01:55] wife
[1:01:56] not knowing what was done came in and
[1:02:00] Peter answered unto her tell me whether
[1:02:02] you sold the land for so much she said
[1:02:04] yeah for so much then pet said to her
[1:02:07] how is it that you have agreed together
[1:02:09] to tempt the spirit of the Lord behold
[1:02:13] the feet of them which have buried the
[1:02:14] husband at the door and shall carry thee
[1:02:17] out then fell she down straightway at
[1:02:21] his
[1:02:22] feet yielded up The Ghost and the young
[1:02:25] man came came in and found her dead
[1:02:27] carried her forth and buried her by her
[1:02:30] husband verse 11 said and great
[1:02:33] fear Came Upon all the church and upon
[1:02:37] as many as who these
[1:02:40] things it is notable and I never saw
[1:02:43] this before that judgment came forth
[1:02:47] first before great power was
[1:02:50] expressed so therefore this acts 5 up to
[1:02:55] verse 11
[1:02:56] was judgment on the church where God
[1:02:59] dealt with anas and Safara because they
[1:03:02] did not discern who was sitting on
[1:03:05] Peter's heart they did not discern they
[1:03:08] wasn't talking to a man it was the Holy
[1:03:11] Ghost that was veiled in a man isn't
[1:03:13] that right so he lighted the holy ghost
[1:03:16] look at verse 12 now of that same
[1:03:18] chapter so
[1:03:21] fear upon the people because of what
[1:03:23] happened but look at verse 12
[1:03:26] and by the hands of the apostle that
[1:03:29] after
[1:03:30] that were many signs and wonders wrought
[1:03:34] among the people and they were all with
[1:03:36] one Accord in Solomon's porch so after
[1:03:40] God cleaned that act out of the church
[1:03:43] signs wonders
[1:03:46] Miracles and verse 13 and the rest does
[1:03:50] no man join himself to them but the
[1:03:53] people magnify them and Believers were
[1:03:57] the more added to the Lord multitudes of
[1:04:01] men and women in so much verse 15 that
[1:04:05] they brought forth the sick into the
[1:04:06] streets and laid them on beds and
[1:04:09] couches that at least a shadow of Peter
[1:04:13] passing might overshadow some of them
[1:04:16] there came also a multitude out of the
[1:04:18] city wrong about Jerusalem bringing sick
[1:04:21] folks and them vexed with unclean
[1:04:23] spirits and they were healed
[1:04:27] everyone Dynamics to the mechanics
[1:04:30] adopted Sons Moving in power the church
[1:04:33] cleaned out of anas Safa and the prophet
[1:04:36] said we going to have some more of that
[1:04:37] again oh G we have a lot to look forward
[1:04:40] for judgments and rewards oh give the
[1:04:42] Lord some Praises
[1:04:45] Hallelujah want to go to Isaiah

[1:09:14] Godly shall
[1:09:18] [Music]
[1:09:21] perisho he made a provision for those
[1:09:25] who want to be
[1:09:26] redeemed he made a provision for those
[1:09:29] who want to be
[1:09:30] healed and then because he did this
[1:09:33] makes him rich in Mercy as he has always
[1:09:36] been rich in Mercy it must be and if he
[1:09:40] refuse this there is nothing left but
[1:09:43] the Judgment because sin must be judged
[1:09:49] many time we forget that Jesus Took upon
[1:09:51] him our sins
[1:09:52] in that's why he was judged do you know
[1:09:55] Christ was
[1:09:56] judged he was judged at Calvary because
[1:09:59] he had our sins upon
[1:10:01] him but sin couldn't just change or
[1:10:04] stain his character so when he went down
[1:10:07] to hell he could offload that sin on the
[1:10:08] devil Rose pure as ever to redeem us and
[1:10:13] to play our case so our judgment was in
[1:10:16] Christ so we don't have to be judged
[1:10:18] again oh give the Lord a shout say any
[1:10:21] man being Christ he's a new creature
[1:10:26] Hallelujah
[1:10:28] Glory Pharaoh went into the sea an
[1:10:32] impostor seeing that he could go in like
[1:10:34] Moses did Pharaoh think that se was that
[1:10:37] way was made for him that was made
[1:10:40] for God rich in Mercy made a way of
[1:10:42] Escape for the Hebrew children why
[1:10:45] because they followed in the line of
[1:10:47] duty they were following in the word now
[1:10:51] that's the only way to obtain Mercy is
[1:10:54] to follow the instruction that God give
[1:10:56] us to follow in that's the only way he
[1:10:59] can show Mercy is when we follow what he
[1:11:01] said do remember God can't go by our
[1:11:04] feelings whether you're feeling
[1:11:06] emotional you're feeling sad you're
[1:11:07] feeling the cry you're feeling depressed
[1:11:09] you're feeling D that's your feeling
[1:11:10] that another word God

[1:11:47] heal we have to come in that childlike
[1:11:50] obedience to believe just what God Said
[1:11:52] don't try to figure it out and figure it
[1:11:54] out in your head just accept what he
[1:11:56] said and walk in the light of the
[1:11:57] unfolding word and you will get your
[1:12:03] breakthrough God hates sin and sin must
[1:12:07] be
[1:12:09] judged he said I we got a fine president

[1:12:15] good it will take the comment of the
[1:12:17] Lord Jesus to do it sin must be judged
[1:12:20] and I say this with respect uh the
[1:12:22] Christian ministers if God let this
[1:12:24] generate
[1:12:26] get by without giving them a judgment he
[1:12:30] would as just God be juty bong to
