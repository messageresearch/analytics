the hearing of the word we want to pray a special blessing on your servant and Lord our pastor brother over that you would give him strength in his body that you would touch him from the crown of his head to the SS of his feet may you be with his wife may you be with the ministry may you be with all of the church in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen we do have a note of Praise uh prayer was offered by my cousin Errol rashford for high blood sugar and pressure he is out of the hospital and is doing much better we thank the Lord for that this morning from Sister kangi believe uh we do have a few prayer requests this morning from Brother Francis Timothy for my brother Edmund Timothy du you for an operation tomorrow on his vertebrae please pray that God

delivery the baby could be du any day now we want to remember her in prayer as well and if there's any Unwritten or unspoken requests you want to show by raise of hands as we approach the throne of God this morning our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we come to your throne Lord and knowing we have rights of access to you this morning Father and Lord we have seen the sick healed we have seen deliverances we have seen outpouring of the Holy Spirit and Lord we have a note of Praise right here from a prayer request that was offered father Lord this morning we come to you once again knowing

her in body even now from the crown of her head to the souls of her feet may she have a safe delivery and may all be well and for all the hands that were raised both here and maybe on the internet father may you touch your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen and amen you may be seated for a few minutes amen I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ greetings from Germany and from Brother zigma Co and Brena and the church there in Autumn back they send their greetings to The Headstone Tabernacle it was really a blessing to be there in fellowship with them and we are under great expectation for what God is doing and what God is about to do amen we do have some visitors this morning uh Josiah punch and janica punch we' like to welcome you to The Headstone Tabernacle invited by Brother Bavon punch welcome and we also have amila jila Olivia Ramada I'm not sure who invited but I see a name here welcome welcome uh so everybody feeling fine amen everybody prayed up this morning everybody read the Bible this morning everybody is on fire this morning everybody have their swords drawn this morning everybody under expectation this morning everybody doing your part this morning because you know the preacher cannot bring a Revival it takes the people to be under expectation to bring a Revival so we are not here just to wait and bring food for you but there's some fresh killed meat and there's some killing to be done of some meat that we got to eat this morning but it's an army this morning and we want every Soldier to do their part we want every brother to take his place because that's the promise that's over us where every man take his place every husband take his place every wife take her place every son take his place every daughter take her place can the church say amen and it's such a thing you know there was a situation in Paris about two weeks ago with a terrorist attack and uh having to travel through Europe to obviously get to Germany going through the airports you see the heightened tension and the the checks and the double checks and the triple checks because men's hearts are failing for fear because man doesn't know what to expect but what is taking place is only scripture being fulfilled so the bride is never surprised the bride is never worried the bride is never concerned because all of this is the Fulfillment of Prophecy and what takes place outside the church is really not the sign for the church what takes place inside the church is what we are looking for because we are under expectation for the coming of the Lord make sure your expectation is for the coming of the Lord because you're going to get what you expect can the church say amen and as the time brother Kang is getting shorter the devil is going to do everything he can to keep you from your promise as the time gets closer he knows he doesn't have too much time left so he's going to do everything everything he can to take your joy to take your peace to mess with your prayer life to take away your time from the scripture to influence when you come to church and he's going to do all in his power and that's why we came here this morning to do all in our power to get ready because his wife hath made herself ready can the church say amen amen so I'm other expectation this morning for what God is going to do I really want to salute brother ID for the last three messes you appreciate those messages the passion to know the word the cry to get in the spirit and the fervent desire to please God that should be your identification a passion to know the word a cry there's always a cry in your soul to be in the spirit you can exist if you're out of the spirit you don't want to live if you're out of the spirit you want to be in the word and you want to be in the spirit and more than that you want to have a f desire to please God when you wake up in the morning you want to please God uh before you go to bed at night you want to please God when you on the job you want to please God not please the neighbor not please your coworker not please your boss not please the pastor not please the Elder but please God can the church say Amen you know and uh when I heard him preach the first message the passion to know the word the Lord dropped a message in my heart since that week and I told him I have something and then he told me he wanted to do a three-part Series so I said well God knows how to unfold everything because the thought I had I was like my is going to be really fitting to follow what he brought so I want to kind of touch on something this morning a bit of teaching a bit of talking a bit of preaching but I believe that the Lord has given me something and God is going to bless this morning so everybody feeling fine can we give the Lord a hand of Praise this morning you may be seeded so before I read a scripture I kind of want to introduce where I'm going this morning now every biblical character everyone in the Bible has a unique place a unique role a unique purpose for some the story of their lives will span decades and for others in the Bible their Ministry would have lasted for just a few hours with the limited ability of our minds to fully comprehend every aspect of what transpired in this fraction of Eternity we call time it is impossible for us to place one character above the other how do you compare the life of Abraham with the life of Noah how do you compare the life of Noah with the life of Jeremiah amen how do you compare the life of the mighty Prophet Elijah with Nathan how do you compare Samuel with Barack How do you even compare one to the other how do you compare the Prophet Elijah for example with Simon of sirene everyone knows the story of Elijah Elijah shut the heavens Elijah called for fire Elijah took his mantle and struck Elisha the impact of Elijah's Ministry was so great that Ahab asked are you the one that troubles Israel Elijah was just special he was just unique there was just something about Elijah his role was for many many years and the life and the spirit of Elijah was found on Elisha it could be found on John the Baptist and we know it's found on William Mariam brandham a 20th century Prophet so Elijah stands out as a special kind of a prophet as a special kind of a man but in this drama of God God has players and he has individuals for a specific reason and for specific time and for a specific purpose but that's Elijah Hallelujah but how do you compare the life of someone like Elijah with Simon of syene Simon of sirene is not a prophet there were no books written about Simon of sirene his name is not found in Hebrews 11 when Paul recounts the heroes of Fate but in God's Great drama Simon of sirene finds himself at a familiar place at a unique time he is not a Jew he is not a Roman he is from sirene but yet he finds himself in Jerusalem in the closing days of Jesus's Ministry his ministry was not for months or years or weeks Simon's Ministry would be for for a few moments the entire Old Testament was pointing to a messiah the entire New Testament would speak of a messiah and how he would change the world but Simon of sirene finds himself self in the middle of a crowd of people in the days just after the Feast of the Passover and he Witnesses people carrying crosses he is a witness in that day and time the Bible isn't tell us if he understood what was taking place but he found himself there in that day crucifixions were common in Jerusalem but this day was different amen among the men to be crucified was a man called Jesus a man who did nothing to deserve this amen a man without sin a man who had done no wrong but he found himself in the middle of a situation watching this drama unfold he watched This Man Called Jesus being bruised being battered being scarred being mocked tap being spit upon bruised tired and wary he watch this man no longer able to carry his cross amen amen and This Man Called Simon of sirene is commanded to take the cross from Jesus and to Bear the wait for him how precious is it to carry the cross of Jesus with the weight of sin on Jesus's shoulders what a blessing to carry his cross and we could go on and on talking about different characters in The Bible and the roles that they play but as every biblical character stepped forward they played their role in God's drama each one having their part each one having their place and everyone here you have your place in God's drama it might be for a few moments like Simon of sirene or it could be for years like Elijah but I know that this bride is Promised a short quick message that would shake the whole nation in God's Great drama he is moving all the pieces at the right time at the right moment to achieve his plan so don't think for a moment that you are here by accident that you are here by chance there's a purpose this morning for being here there's a purpose that God called you there's a purpose this message came to you somebody said [Applause] amen I'm saying all of that to build a background that it's it's impossible Amen to compare one to the other it's extremely difficult to compare one Prophet to another amen but yet of all the biblical characters in The Bible there is one character that has a unique distinction amen this distinction is not given to Elijah it's not given to Moses not given to Noah but this distinction and this description is called a man after my own heart in the whole of the Bible throughout all of history there's only one man who has the distinction of being described by God as a man after my own heart God spoke lip to air to Moses but this man I'm talking about this morning was a man that God looked at and said there's a man after my own heart and I believe this morning once more God will have men after his own heart somebody say Amen hallelujah hallelujah so by the grace of God this morning I want to speak on that thought this morning a man after God's Own Heart so shall we take our Bibles read one scripture from the book of Acts chapter 13 and reading verse 16 I want to thank the musicians in particular brother John Mark for taking up the challenge this morning oh bless you you appreciate brother John Mark am reading from Acts chapter 13 and reading from verse 16 then Paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men of Israel and ye that fear God give audience the God of this people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt and with an high arm brought he them out of it and about the time of 40 years suffered he Their Manners in the wilderness and when he had destroyed Seven Nations in the land of Canaan he divided their land to them by lot and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of 450 years until until Samuel the prophet and afterward they desired a king and God gave unto them Saul the son of sis a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years and I like this and when he had removed him Saul was fired God fired Saul when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their King to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word can we pray one more time Heavenly Father Lord any man could read the scripture but it takes the Holy Spirit to bring it to life may you bring it to life this morning as a living reality for your people to go into action Lord may you bless the reading of the word bless the hearing of it may you you open the understanding of your people may you anoint me touch my vocal cords touch my weary body Lord May no flesh be Lord displayed this morning but may Spirit spoken words come from this sacred desk this morning Lord hide me behind calvary's cross and speak to your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen you may be seated amen amen amen [Music] hallelujah so for a title this morning a man after God's Own Heart and I'm going to take my time because I really want to drive a few things home this morning but our Story begins with as the scripture we read where Paul is reflecting on the history of of how they came to be in our story we find ourselves among the children of Israel they had seen all the works God took them out of Egypt God God blessed them but when you read the book of Samuel you find that the children of Israel were not satisfied with hearing from God they were not satisfied with hearing from the prophets and they looked internally they looked outside and they came to the prophet Samuel to the elders and say we want a king like the Philistines we want a king like the amalekites we want a man to rule us like these other tribes and Nations because talking to God we we really don't want to do that all the time we want to go to somebody my God Fallen man always looks to some man to guide them some man to lead him and God was pleased God was pleased with the way he had it before that's why he told Samuel they have not rejected you they have rejected me because I have sent my prophets to give the word of the Lord to my people So within the hearts of these people God say all right you want a king go find one and they looked and they had their election they had their voting they had their campaigning and they picked by their choice the man called Saul his resume looked good the school he went to was good his height was good his speech was good he was qualified for the job in their eyes but it was not God's choice it was man's choice and whenever man chooses man will make the wrong choice somebody say amen I don't think you got that whenever man chooses man will make the wrong choice because God has a will God has a way God has thoughts about everything and I want the thoughts of God I want the way of God I want the will of God somebody say amen God told Samuel don't stress about it don't worry about it they have not rejected you they have turned me upside down they have rejected me and there will be consequences and for 40 years Saul ruled 40 years and then the Bible said God removed him God took him out of office God moved him off the scene because God said I have found a better man now you have had your time to have your choice but I'm going to make a choice now and I have found a better man go to the house of Jesse a little village down somewhere and you will find my choice his name is not anywhere nobody knows about him he hasn't gone to school he doesn't have a degree he's not qualified but he is my choice oh you don't hear me this morning you may be seated but most importantly he's a man after my own heart there are people who are intellectually in the message but their heart is not of God we talking about a man after God's Own Heart am and God qualifies it Hallelujah he says which shall fulfill all my will so the designation the condition the link between those two statements is a man after my own heart who will fulfill all my will not his will not his ideas not his dreams not his Visions but my will oh somebody hear me this morning is there anybody in the house who wants a fulfill the will of God you may be seated you know what's hindering you amen your will that's right your belief your ideas your thoughts on the matter how you see things how you process things what you knew when you were a child when you all of that is what's hindering you but if you could shut your mind and shut your heart and shut your spirit to all that is you and TI out to yourself than the will of God it's something to get the will of God you may be seated is there anybody in the house this morning is there anybody in the church this morning the will of God is such a powerful thing that even Jesus when he walked on this Earth had to come face to face with a battle of wills you don't hear me this morning Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane it wasn't his first time there Jesus was very often in the Garden of Gethsemane but the few days before he was crucified as he traversed that area once more he came face to face with Lord not my will but thy will be done because my will would not be to get pain not have trials not have testings not have situations but not my will he said father if it is possible let this come pass father if it is possible let this trial pass let this test pass let this situation pass but nonetheless not my will but I will be done give me a church with individuals seeking the will of God we'll turn this country upside down give me a church with people without their will without their ambition without their desires and watch God move on the scene somebody say [Applause] Amen you may be seated man's choice amen man's Choice that's why the fful ministry cannot be man's Choice it has to be God's choice because God told Samuel when he went by the house of Jesse he said forget how they look forget how they speak I'm not looking at the external countenance I'm not looking at their background I'm not looking at how long their resume David had no Ministry David was unknown David didn't even wasn't even make the cut to be in the army but that was God's choice that was God's choice and the enemy might be looking at you right now and say you are failed so many times you have no great testimony but that doesn't change the fact that you are God's choice the trial that you have doesn't change the fact that you are God's choice you don't hear me this morning when the lion came to David he may have wondered why this lion coming here there are other Shepherds there are other sheep pastures but David didn't know that he was God's choice and his trials his testings Was preparing him for kingship that he didn't know he was going to carry one tape his trials his testing Was preparing him for what his purpose was in life but he was too young to understand it he didn't have the experience to appreciate it and he didn't know because it had never happened before can the church say Amen you may be seated God give us some moment after your own heart Hall when we think about the life of David many things come to mind are you with me this morning can I take my time this morning hope you got a good rest last night because when we come to church we come to church as brother over said I was I was connected to the service in Germany you know I was connected but said I'mma talk about closing Co we still open and the Believers over there who were connected say what said he's not closing yet so we come and the doors are open right now we're not closing right now but when we think about the life of David many things come to mind the little Shepherd boy the musician amen being anointed by Samuel and as you read the book of Psalms you see every emotion imaginable being displayed joy peace frustration fear pain anger anguish grief desire sadness every emotion that somebody could experience is captured in the life of David look at Moses Elijah we have glimpses of their lives not David David grows up as it were before our eyes as a boy as a man his feeles his UPS his down and all the way to his entire tapestry of his life spans Samuel to the Book of Psalms written in the old and the New Testament speak about [Applause] davidl he grows up before our very eyes we see him as a Shepherd a hunter a warrior a general a king a poet a champion an outlaw a ladiesman a musician a prophet a worship leader an adulterer a murderer a brother a husband a son a parent a leader a hero a builder an ancestor of Jesus Christ and a man after God's Own [Applause] Heart despite his UPS his Downs his failures his frustration in Hebrews 11 they don't speak about it he is numbered among the heroes of Fate what will your testimony be I'm telling you your ups and downs will not be remembered your failures will not be remembered what you did will not be remembered because it'll be put in a sea of forgetfulness there is nothing against you because you are the new Heroes of Faith men after God own heart can we have church this morning can we preach this morning can we enjoy the Lord this morning you may be seated so I want us to take a drive this morning with a Maron into the mind and heart of this man who had his heart like God you see it's difficult to really identify with Jesus because in your mind and heart he's Messiah Savior and you really as a human can relate to his experience the Bible says he didn't sin he was sented as we are but Jesus is still Jesus but Jesus left a secret for us he left an example to us after as a man after his own heart so when you feel frustrated there's no scripture of Jesus being frustrated but David he has frustration are you with me so David the shepherd the shepherd David says the Lord is my shepherd that is a profound statement because he knew what being a Shepherd was all about so with a deep and a reflective and internal understanding brother papular being a shepherd He said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want because David had experienced taking care of the sheep and he made sure his sheep did not want can you ride with me this morning he leadth me beside the Still Waters when I need a rest he knows exactly where to carry me he leadth me beside the Still Water he restoreth my soul is there anybody needs a restoring of the Soul this morning you may be seated he leadth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake it's not about me it's about him he will protect his name he will defend his name he said he may be seated maybe this is speaking to somebody this morning y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death death all around me I will feil no evil that's how we got to speak in the morning in the middle of the day I will fear no evil for thou art with me what a comfort to know that thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepar us a table before me in the presence of my enemies let me stop there for a moment you may be seated and you don't have any enemies God's got to get some enemies for you to prepare a table for you in the presence of your enemies so don't feel bad when you have enemies because God is waiting for the enemies to come around you to prepare a table for you in the presence as the young people would say in the presence of your haters he going to put a table for you oh you don't hear me this morning preach with me somebody ride with me this morning our God is a big God our God is a good God our God is a powerful God you may be seated thou preparest a table for me in the presence of my enemy while they're watching me while they're looking at me I'm going to be eating and it's not my doing when he sets the table you don't mess with the table when he sets the table by the Thomson you don't move the dishes around you don't take the chicken from me God put that there for me don't touch it don't mess with it get your own table somebody say Amen you may be seated thou anointest my head with oil my cup run it over oh when the blessing of the Lord pour the cup runs over you could always keep drinking there's no need for refill because he is my refilling he is my joy he is my peace how real are these words this morning from a man after God's Own Heart you may be seated surely surely most assuredly positively without hesitation without doubting without wondering without being perplexed surely goodness and mercy when I need Mercy it's going to be following me all the days of my life when I give up on God he's not going to give up on me because goodness and mercy will follow me when I think I can't make it good good and mercy is always with me when I'm backsliding goodness and mercy is there to carry me when everybody walks away goodness and [Applause] mercy you may be seated and David closes this sermon and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever there comes a time when backsliding is not even an option there comes a time where the world is not an option but you will dwell in the house of the Lord forever nobody could bring you in the Kingdom nobody could push you out of the Kingdom David had a revelation that all that the father has given me must come and the devil cannot take you he cannot push you out you belong to God you come from God you are going back to God set the Church Say [Applause] Amen my my my my my anybody love Jesus this morning anybody love the Lord this morning are you glad you in the house of God this morning Hallelujah so we're still taking a journey this morning wonderful through the Life Through The Eyes the emotions the handwriting the musical strings that are played by this man after God's Own Heart it's like a roller coaster amen following David's life Hallelujah because while he screams and he shouts the Adoration then you read Lord how are they increased that trouble me Hallelujah many are there that rise up against me many there be with say in the message of my soul there's no help for him in God but th oh Lord art a shield for me my glory and the lifter up of my head that's my testimony I Cried unto the Lord with my voice and he heard me out of his Holy Hill I laid me down and slipt I awake for the Lord sustain me I will not be afraid of 10,000s of people that have set them themselves against me round about is that your testimony being courage this morning hear how a man speaks when he's a man after God's Own Heart you may be seated this morning but the George I see you smiling this morning just takes you deep down and it it it helps you to rephrase your thinking and that's why reading the scripture sister Oliver is so powerful because when you are in this it hard to shake you it's hard for you to go and do foolishness in the world when you are in the word amen amen just a few more I'm not rushing I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help Hallelujah My Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth Hallelujah he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth the will not Slumber behold he that keepeth

Lord into which the writers shall enter I will praise thee for thou Hast heard me and I've become my salvation the stone which the builders refused has become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes amen this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad am Hallelujah can the church say amen and if David was here this morning he would say I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord aren't you happy you're in the house of the Lord this [Applause] morning hallelujah hallelujah so I encourage you this week spend some time in the Book of Psalms spend some time in the scriptures and be refreshed because that's what God wants you meditate on the word day and night and you will have good success so let's move on a bit talk about David some would say that David is most remembered for his encounter with Goliath for some it would be the definition of his greatest success for in the midst of a situation where the whole of Israel not like a house the whole of Israel was at pause no movement because we can't find any Minister any preacher any brother Elder Deacon truste help government to go and deal with this situation that the Philistines have brought about yes under the headship of this man called golad right Saul is still King and Saul is ready to give his daughter his money his house his left foot his right arm his cell phone anything to anybody who go and fight that man because sa man's choice is scared he wants nothing to do and this is the tallest man he was chosen because of his height one of his reason was his height and here he's tremlin saying take whoever whoever could fight that man let me know my daughter money title house Car Land cell phone you name it and here's this little Shepherd boy named David not in the Army not a soldier bringing food for his Brethren but the Bram said may have been raisins and he just happened to hear this cry from this man called Goliath send me a man to fight me and as he's walking I can imagine he didn't know what was going on he's like okay somebody going to go and then he nobody going I mean David has the greatest this is the army of Israel you know there's not no Palestine army or Egyptian Army this is Israel yes he didn't come to watch the fight he came to bring food as he's walking away he hears this cry look around somebody got to be nobody going and he ask the brother in back who is this uncircumcised Philistine yes how the Army pin now amen yeah he said let me go back and talk to Saul sa talking to anybody how does a Shepherd boy end up in the king's tent think about it this a big army Saul take anybody anybody come desperate so King David come and say well I think I can handle it he say well you're good enough enough take my armor take my shield take I had this the latest the latest one Tesla made this one this is the latest one all the solar powered everything David say I don't need that I need a slingshot and I need my God because when I was there with the Sheep nobody was watching me but a lion came and a beer came and I give it to them good because I know who my God is and he is my deliverer a man after God's Own Heart and we know the story David knocked out that giant but I want to talk about another Giant Hallelujah this giant called golad David conquered but in this life of this man called golad in his life of this man called David rather I want to talk a little bit about a giant he couldn't conquer yes because after his greatest Victory David also had to contend with his greatest defeat because as much as he was spiritual as as a singer there was a giant in his heart that led him to go after B yes and he couldn't conquer that giant because it took a greater power to overcome that giant than David had if David had the power at that time to overcome that giant we wouldn't need a mighty conqueror that's powerful so God through the tapestry of how he was unveiling things was creating these void to show there's a conqueror that will come that will overcome everything not just in the physical or the mind but in the body in the flesh hallelujah hallelujah there'll be a Christ that would come that David yes who would conquer and be the mighty conqueror the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life so that because he is the mighty conquerer we could also be more than conquerors so in the life of David being lived out huj he had to also show the need for a messiah I want you to understand this because many of us we try to do it on our own and but brandham said when he was preaching he say you can't do it huh or maybe you think you could do it he said that's right you can't do it it takes the Holy Ghost to give you the power to do it because if it's not the Holy Ghost it's your mind it's mental like people who go to the mountain and meditate and they block the world out and they're so focused they're watching a stone for like 82 hours to not think about anything else that's not what God want you to do he wants the Holy Ghost to be in the control tower of your heart Hallelujah and conquer the lust of the eyes conquer the lust of the flesh conquer the pride of life because he is living something out can the church say amen and after all David's ups and downs God looked beyond all that and says he will fulfill all my will when the devil thought he had David knocked out the will of God prevailed God wanted David to build the temple but David hand that so much blood he said no no no no no no no no no no Hallelujah but my will will be prevailed in your life and your son your seed Solomon he will he will build the temple through the prophet Nathan God told David in 2 Samuel and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee thy Throne shall be established forever great King David and his Lon and his seed can the church say Amen Give the Lord a hand of Praise this morning so through the line of David as you read the scripture we come right down to Jesus but the brand message crisis the mystery of God reveal said he talking about Jesus is the principal theme of The Bible he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history of the Bible the Bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and then there you find Christ he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history he also in the Bible is the things that is to come amen that's why it's so important that we spend time in the scripture to know what our scripture is what does that make him then B said the same yesterday today and forever and we know that Jesus came with three titles Son of God Son of Man and Son of David that's how powerful that King David line is the very first sentence in the New Testament in Matthew 1:1 says the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham am and as you look through Matthew Matthew 1 to Tre to for see everything Jesus is going through by the time Jesus is healing and delivering the People by the time you reach Matthew 12 the people the the scripture says in Matthew 12:23 and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of David because all of the Jews were awaiting this son from the line of David who would be a deliverer who would be a messiah and d and Jesus was troubling the water so much to say is not this the son of David can the church say amen and I believe that God will have another Ministry another David's Ministry on the Earth again can the church say Amen what is that Ministry men after God's Own Heart on the earth and Christ himself that David leading this Army straight to the resurrection straight to the Rapture can the church say Amen in the message perfect strength by Perfect weakness but said that's what's the matter today God's got a lot of sheep that's gone astray the organization and things have stole them out brought them out into psychology God give us Davids with the word of God and the power of God to direct it when we go to meet these intellectual Giants give me the word of God and the power of the Holy Ghost and and I tell you we can slay every Giant in the field can the church say amen that's what I'm looking for the word of God and the power of the Holy Ghost we need Dynamics and we need mechanics we need that same Jesus that David the stand and Lead his army can the church say [Applause] Amen Oh My My My and brother Bram saids in the same message and today we know we need a Revival we know we need a stirring amongst the people it will not take a doctor of divinity it'll take a week he talking about Hallelujah that'll take the word of God with weak people that'll take the word of God in the power of the resurrection of Christ and slay this thing it'll bring Christ to the country and let them see that he can still Open the Eyes of the blind he can still heal the sick he can still raise the dead he is God conqueror we need a David untrained in the theological School RS we need a man who knows nothing about that some little plow boy or something some little guy with his stoop shoulders not much to look at will come walking down the road with the power of God let me prophesy God will have some Davids walking this island walking around the world there W be much to look at but it'll be packing the power of God silver and gold I don't have but such as I have because Christ that David will be in them can the Church Say Amen brother the brandham said in the message this great warrior David he said you are Davids do do we have any Davids in the house this morning he said you are Davids you are called elected anointed positionally put in the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then brother Bram screams out Goliath you are defeated he's defeated tonight and I say this morning Goliath is defeated oh you don't hear me I know some of you still looking at golad but he's defeated golad was standing there and he was defeated he didn't even know it and this morning your Goliath is looking at you and he's defeated he is finished you have already overcome you are already conquerors you are already Victorious somebody give God a shout of [Applause] Praise Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah brother there's coming a time when adopted Sons will stand up and speak but the B said the pillar of fire will be veil in the adopted sons in that season of adoption all the Philistines with AB Bram said will go to backing up because the Philistines are the personal demons and I'm speaking to people this morning got some personal demons some personal issues but we're looking for a fire to burn these personal demons out the ones you've been carrying for a long time the ones nobody knows know about the ones you worry about these personal demons these Philistines Goliath his cousins his family his neighbors his relatives we come to serve them notice David is on the scene David is in the house David is in the camp we have heard the Declaration for a long time send me a man send me a man well there's been churches churches Brides brides churches churches but there's going to come another one there's going to come a David's Ministry another people who under their messenger would be the final voice to the final age we're going to begin to turn we're going to begin to swing five Stones five stones and we're just going to take one and begin to swing because if you only get started oh you don't hear me this morning if you only get started God is going to do the rest so this morning all the Davis get your sling out put that stone in that sling and you begin to worship you begin to turn you begin to praise and watch God do something in your life watch God do something in your family somebody say [Applause] Amen GL Hallelujah you may be seated who's the Goliath brother brandom question who's the Goliath brother the brandom said that cancer that's eating you up that tumor the Cataract in your eyes the arm everything looks at it and says it can't be done the devil might say you might as well quit believing you might as well backslide all at that Goliath you might as well settle down because you can't never no more get well the doctor said so all the rest of them said so you can get well but this morning hear the prophet but the cries that made you stop you're drinking smoking lying stealing that save saved you from a life of drunkenness from Rowling from sin and a devil's grave if God can do that for you he can save you from your TB from your cancer but the brother said he's a Goliath don't take his boast don't take what the devil is is telling you don't take his boast we are not listening to him this morning stand in the name of the Lord Jesus and challenge him to a showdown and that's what I'm doing in this church this morning I'm challenging lust I'm challenging lying I'm challenging fornication I'm challenging adultery I'm challenging that no praise demon I'm challenging backsliding I'm challenging cancer and high blood pressure and female condition I challenge diabetes high blood pressure low blood pressure high Shar low Shar every Goliath we come against you in the name of the Living God we come against you as the Church of the Living God and we serve you notice we will cut your head off can the church say Amen oh my stand in the name of the Lord Jesus and challenge him to assur them we have taken what the devil offered for too long but draw your swords all over the building draw your swords challenge the devil challenge that no praise demon challenge your doubt challenge your fear challenge your unbelief you are born to overcome you are more than conquerors you are [Applause] victorious hallu hallu I feel religious but B said I he religious positionally in Christ he said if the believer know his position he'd have it oh let me say that again if a Believer know his position he'd have it David knew his position his faith was not based on Saul his faith wasn't based on Jesse his father his faith was based on a living God who delivered him so you may not be where you're supposed to be but once you're not where you used to be it was God who took you from where you were to where you are now that's enough of a reason to shout because you couldn't bring yourself anywhere you couldn't even come to church this morning if the Lord didn't call you so once you have a testimony and know you're not where you're supposed to be but if you're not where you're used to be then you begin to shout if you're not where you used to be you could worship because he took me out of the Mary clay he put my foot on a roor state and the Bible says he who started the work in you is able more than aable to complete it because he's the auor and he's the finisher he's the alpha he is the Omega he is the beginning he is the end he is the first he is the last he is that David he is the Messiah he is the Redeemer he is the savior the mighty conqueror sickness has to listen doubt has to listen your son has to listen your daughter has to listen that demon has got to go because when he speaks every knee will bow every tongue will confess there's no name higher than the name of the Lord [Applause] Jesus you may be seated but the brandom said I want to see that again if the believer know his position he'd have it you have to know your position because your position means you have to conduct yourself a certain way if your father is the king you have to conduct yourself like your father is the king in fact in the Royal house if you study the house of the the the in England the queen and the family when Kate had to marry Prince Prince whatever her name was William right they had to take her to a certain train because she had never lived in the house before you have to know how to walk how to talk how to dress who is in charge of which Duke Dom and which kingdom and which which section and know them my name because you can appear to not know who's the Earl of nothing ham or the Duke of Rochester or whatever you got to know so God is taking us through some training this morning because we are sons of the king and you got to know who you are you got to know your position you got to know what powers you have so when the enemy comes so you you don't need to get permission to send a blood hound after your son you know you have access to the throne you know all that the father has given must come you know whatever you bind on Earth is bounding Bound in heaven whenever you loose on Earth loose in heaven you just have to speak because if you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt you're going to have it when you know your position all of a sudden your vocabulary will change your walk change your talk change why you know who you are you know where you come from you know where you are going somebody say Amen friends you may be seated this is not a game this is not a joke this is not us coming together just to have a good time and and we try to put together a great message to get you no this is about you coming into your position with God when the veil was Ren from top to bottom God broke the old system of the priesthood and say now you are priest you are Kings you have direct access you don't need to go through anybody you don't even need a preacher to pray for you you could go straight to the throne of God and say lord it's mine Lord you promise it's mine I need it this morning I need the Holy Ghost today I need my healing now I need Deliverance now I need my son this morning direct access you may be seated David didn't ask permission David didn't tell Saul Saul give me a script so I could read it to Goliath give me a quote so I could tell Goliath all David said was I will chop your head offall give me some more Christians who will begin to threaten the devil you you you you you did not hear me this morning some of you been under threat for so long you never even thought about threat to the devil threat say devil I'm coming to chop your head off and if you don't know who I am check David check David I'm just like David because I'm going to be a man after God's Own Heart but you fail David fail check his resume but in Hebrews 11 they didn't talk about the David backslid look at me I backslid but the Lord had delivered me the Lord have restored my soul Satan you better watch me but don't touch me because I'm still going to chop your head off Hallelujah you may be seated let the devil take time writing on all my mistakes all my failures all my shortcomings let him take his time and do that all I'm doing is this you write I'm swinging you talk I'm swinging you laugh I'm swinging I don't have a sword but I cha your head off oh somebody give God a shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated but the said God's great spirit is here and listen and His Holy Ghost is ready to fall on anybody that will believe it that's open to anybody this morning is a open invitation to anybody this morning who will believe that the Holy Ghost is yours it's open to anybody this morning who will believe that you could be delivered this morning it's open to anybody this morning who came in with a demon and you want to go free we could cast that demon out this morning it's open to you this morning you may have walked in past Liv but you can leave here free this morning it's open this [Applause] morning [Music] hallelujah hallelujah somebody give God praise somebody give God worship somebody thank him this morning he inhabits the Praises of his people he loves it when you worship David said as the heart panted after the water so my soul T have to De oh God thirst after the Living God is there a thirst in your heart this morning thirst is a painful desire David said created in me a clean heart renew a right Spirit make this your prayer this morning renew a right Spirit Lord you know my spirit has not been right but renew a right Spirit a right Spirit about your word a right Spirit about the Prophet a right Spirit about the message cast me not away from your presence oh take not thy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of my salvation yes you're saved but you got no joy but this morning restore unto me the joy the joy of when I first met you the joy when you first touched me give me back my joy this morning Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah God's great spirit is here amen and His Holy Ghost is ready to fall on anybody that will believe it do you believe it that's what that's that's the prophet do you believe it amen God has promised it God will do it you're in Christ brother Bram goes on goliad's are bragging he's talking golad says you see you was here last night and didn't get healed you came to Services before and nothing happened you was at the other meetings didn't get healed but the Propet said who is that uncircumcised devil but the said who is that devil listen that has no relationship with God at all no relationship with God who is that devil that stands with nothing but a defeated thing behind him his master Was Defeated at Calvary by our Lord and our conqueror Hallelujah he's a bluff that's all we won't believe him anymore and the prophet said down with him and if it's three words you go this week with is Da with him who da with the devil da with Goliath da with him this morning Hall enough is enough Dawn with him this morning enough is enough we're not taking it anymore I'm not taking my sickness anymore I'm not taking my fear anymore I'm not taking it anymore enough is enough down with him we serve noce I'm not going to be a Halfway Christian anymore I'm going to the resurrection I'm going to be adopted I'm going to be perfected I'm going to be filled with the holy ghost seven Living Voices will come out of my [Music] life can the church say Amen whether I T my whether I maintain my family let me maintain Christ let me maintain Christ you may be seated you see what made David unique he had a relationship with God and that's what's missing in the church today people have relationships with one another they want to call the pastor they want to fellowship with a brother but there's no relationship with God David didn't go and talk to Saul about his problems he went to the Lord about it prise God and that's why we need to talk to the Lord about it Hall you may be seated do you understand that the role and I said this in Germany last Sunday the fivefold Ministries role is limited because it's until we all come to the unity of the faith there a condition so there'll come a time when we'll all come to the unity of the faith so I'm just here to point point you and when you connect with God that's it you [Applause] know amen I'm not trying to keep you tired and come and no there come a time when there's my spirit flowing in phly how I could get between my spirit flu in Philly between you and God say Lord let me tell I want to make a break in the connection I want to connect in that line to no you connected to your father he's your father I'm not your father that's right that's why the Bible say call no man father you I I can be your father really Hallelujah he is your father father he is your lord he is your king he's your Redeemer it's just through the foolishness of preaching we are pointing you back to home back to your father back to our homecoming because like the prodigal son he's looking out for you a long time ago you walked away did your own thing and God set up a whole system waiting for you to come back waiting for you to come back home you forgot you had spiritual Amnesia you forgot you were back there before the foundation of the world you forgot you kick the devil you forgot you were fighting alongside Michael you forgot that but our job is to remind you where was now when I lay the foundation of the earth and the morning star sign together you were there you were there listen you may be seated there'll be no prayer request over there you know there's only Praises we would have no prayer request there'll be no worries there'll be no take it to the Lord in prayer do you have a perfect body a perfect perect Joy I can't wait to talk to David myself for him to explain what he was going through I could only understand a fraction of it but the one thing I know he was just like me he was just like me with his struggles is up and down and if God could deliver him he could deliver me if God could save him he could save me if God could restore him he could restore me and he was a man after God's own house Hall hallah M you may be see well you know me I'm not I'm not too long of a Preacher amen I told him in Germany I'll be maybe 3 4 hours more but after an hour Pastor said to stay open door starting to close Hallelujah amise God just a few more minutes H amen amen amen amen so God's wanting to place his church amen his sons and daughters of God but the brandham and adoption said God let me live to see it is my prayer so close till I can just feel it with my hands almost look it's right there that's where the Bram gesturing but the Bram was looking for sun but God didn't let him see it because he took him home and then he goes on that's what I've longed to see waiting for the time when walk down the street there lays a laying there from his mother's womb Silver and Gold Have I None oh waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God that's what this is about it's about a reality not being in the message not coming to the church but a living reality of the Living God when God but the will make himself known when they'll stop sickness when they'll stop cancer when they stop diseases but the B said right now we lay hands on the sick but in that time when that David is leading his people we will command the demons to leave no more pray in the name of Jesus if devil get out cancer get out can the church say Amen brother I long to see that day I'm looking for that day is there anybody looking for that day Hallelujah Lazarus was dead Hallelujah and Jesus said Lazarus come forth and Lazarus find himself back what about your son what about your daughter you don't think God could speak a word and bring them back is anything too hard for the Lord say at the appointed time I will return unto you according to the time of life and you're going to see your son come back your daughter come back your loved one come back just stay faithful to God's promise and watch God work through you live a life live the testimony anybody could speak but the Thunder that shakes the devil is that lived voice that humility sweetness forgiveness brotherly love it's still the same message it doesn't change it's the same gospel can the church say amenah I'm beginning to wind now the prophet introduced Messiah Hallelujah he introduced that David he introduced the deliverer He restored back the Fate he revealed every mystery and left us with a promise of Dynamics right but we have got to take the land and we know it's a good land we have the evidence of that land we have been living by the evidence of the new land the son of man and I believe the time has come the season has changed and the hour is upon us for David's but the said to step up we need these Davids to step up and take their position Satan told he could stop this he could stop this Mighty Revival but it's too late the Seven Seals seven T the land is a good land we already know us you can't tell us anything else about it we know what our possession is we know what our promise is we know Raptor and fate is laying in the message I say this morning let us not delay anymore let us go up at once and take what belongs to us can the church say [Applause] amen hallelujah Glory I'm getting ready to close now the musician can come up now how was that inheritance given to us through what predestination predestination is for knowledge how did God know he could trust you to be a preacher his for knowledge not he that will it or he that run it it's God that show it Mercy that's right predestination he knew what was in you just like he knew what was in David he knew what was in you before you even come on the earth he know what was in you before there was ever a Earth for you to come on that's him that's the infinite God the infinite we are finite we can only think finite can the church say Amen so let me put a prophecy in there in hearing him there'll be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people that's your promise till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen Powers like that come into the church now I know it for a fact say unto this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said shall come to pass you can have what you have saiden listen the placing of the church in position that's what we're looking for place the church in position where the fullness amen of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then critics mouth will be shutl it'll be a short time Jesus coming right up the mountain went straight to Calvary notice it won't last long but it'll be here can the church say Amen it know it it not but AB brandham said I'm only building the hour closer hand when you're going to see something happen when something's going to take place and all this background all these Services all these messages has only been laying a foundation for a short quick message that will shake the whole nation this world is going to shake this nation is going to shake I'm closing from the spoken word is the Original Seed then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin a version of his word and listen and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that was promised for his word in the Virgin now that does does that sound familiar through them and by them will be fulfilled all wasn't that was what was said of David a man after my own heart he will do all of my will and then brother brandham is saying a bride a virgin through them and by them will be fulfill all that was promised so that Ministry that David had will be a Ministry that the bride will have because she will have that nature to fulfill all of God's will so wait a minute all these years God has been waiting for somebody to come into the scene who could be so surrendered to him that they could do all of his will all of his plans and through that people this world will be finished through that people will be great Deliverance through that people this Earth will be burned in fire through that people the world once more will hear from God again can the church say Amen somebody give the Lord a shout of Praise You can begin to play Hall something softly friends a man after God's Own Heart Hallelujah I don't know what condition you came in here this morning but I pray that deep in your heart you want to be like Jesus Hallelujah there's a song I want to be a Christian in my heart I want to be like Jesus I want to be like Christ I want his nature I want his being I want his attributes so when he looks at you he sees a reflection he sees himself when he looked at David he saw himself Hallelujah a man after his own heart friends that's what our desire should be to be so surrendered so committed so dedicated with our will I want you to think about that in your prayer closet where your will your desires no longer exist and it's just his will if Jesus could pray the prayer and say
