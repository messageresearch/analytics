[36:55] Jesus one time you have played you have
[36:58] spoken plainly speak plainly to us

[37:08] you want to go straight into the wood St
[37:11] John 6 we want to read from 51 to 63 and

[37:24] blessing on Sunday
[37:27] [Applause]
[37:30] while the end is nearing
[37:33] so we can call a warning okay uh Saint
[37:36] John 6 reading from verse 51 I am the
[37:39] living bread this is Jesus which came
[37:40] down from heaven If any man eat of this
[37:43] bread he shall live forever and the
[37:45] bread which I shall that I shall will
[37:47] give is my flesh which I will give for
[37:49] the life of the world the Jews therefore
[37:52] stroll among themselves saying how can
[37:54] this man give us his flesh to eat then
[37:56] Jesus said unto them verily verily sun
[37:58] to you except he eat the Flesh of the
[38:00] son of man drink his blood you have no
[38:02] life in you whosoever eateth My Flesh
[38:04] and took it my blood had eternal life
[38:06] and I will raise him up at the last day
[38:09] for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood
[38:11] is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh
[38:14] and drinketh my blood to other than me
[38:16] and I in him as the living father had
[38:19] sent me and I lived by the father so he
[38:22] that heated me even he shall live by me
[38:24] this is that bread which came not from
[38:28] Heaven not as your father did eat mana
[38:31] and are dead either eat it of this bread
[38:33] shall live forever these things that he
[38:36] in the synagogue as he taught in caperna
[38:39] many therefore of his disciples when
[38:41] they had heard they says disa is a heart
[38:45] who can hear it and when Jesus knew in
[38:49] himself that the disciples murmured at
[38:52] it he said unto them does this offend

[39:23] virgins we took their lamps and went
[39:26] forth to meet the bridegroom five of
[39:28] them were wise five were foolish they
[39:30] that were foolish took their lambs took
[39:32] no oil with them but the wise took oil
[39:34] in their vessels put their lamps while
[39:37] the prayer groom tari they all slumbered
[39:40] and slept and at midnight there was a
[39:43] crime made behold the bridegroom cometh
[39:45] go here to meet him then all those
[39:48] versions of rules and trimmed the lamps
[39:50] and the foolish said unto the wines give

[39:56] and but the wise answered saying not so
[39:58] least there have been not enough for us

[40:05] sell and buy for yourselves and while
[40:08] they went to buy the bridegroom came and
[40:11] they that were already went in with him
[40:13] to the marriage and the door was shut
[40:15] and afterwards came also the other
[40:16] virgins saying Lord Lord open to us he
[40:18] answered and said verily I see unto you
[40:20] I know you're not watch therefore for
[40:23] you know neither The Deen or the hour
[40:26] where the Solomon commit father may God
[40:28] bless his word in Jesus name amen praise
[40:30] God he may be seated
[40:32] we have one prayer request we take after
[40:34] this
[40:35] okay
[40:36] so tonight I have
[40:39] uh these four words the oil the spirit
[40:44] so the message from uh Sunday and this
[40:48] message for tonight this came to me some
[40:51] while now when I was working on it but
[40:53] so that was part and this is like a
[40:55] continuation of it the oil
[40:57] the spirit the Holy Spirit
[41:00] praise God the oil
[41:03] the spirit
[41:04] the seed the rain
[41:07] season and time
[41:09] of habits
[41:11] seed need a sword
[41:13] son of man
[41:16] seed
[41:17] real
[41:18] mechanics Dynamics the word the spirit
[41:23] for marine Lottery
[41:26] husband man praise God seed need rain
[41:29] and then see go through process
[41:32] if there is no rain there's no process
[41:34] to go through the sea just remain a seed
[41:37] but once you have seed you need rain
[41:39] Hallelujah and as a for marine and
[41:42] lettering for marine is the dictionary
[41:45] so you have to have teaching room and
[41:47] then you have to have Harvest or
[41:48] lettering to make manifest what have
[41:50] been taught it can't be just teach and
[41:52] rain all these years it has to have a
[41:54] harvest ring it's not right
[41:57] the bread the message the book so if we
[42:00] talk about the book which is the bread
[42:01] that came along in relation 10 and 17
[42:04] destroy the voices out from that book
[42:06] now have the bread of life
[42:08] that the bride gonna partake of praise
[42:11] God so the book itself is seed but the
[42:14] back is spirit that means the seals the
[42:16] seed but the seven thunders of the
[42:18] spirit that they hit the seed from the
[42:21] inside the book
[42:22] the book was written within on the back
[42:25] side have no writing it was sealed with
[42:27] Seven Seals which are seven Thunders
[42:29] from under the seventh seal o glory to
[42:31] God so some point in time we have to go
[42:33] back to Spirit isn't that right no this
[42:37] seed we're talking about is not just any
[42:38] word it's so Original Seed an original
[42:41] seed only comes from the mouth of God
[42:43] and the Mountain of God Is His prophets
[42:45] not pastors not teachers not evangelists
[42:48] it's prophets so whatever said a prophet
[42:51] out of his mouth have Original Seed and
[42:53] other men have to take from his mouth Oh
[42:56] Glory for what's not the monk of God to
[42:58] preach the same thing that's why he said
[43:00] the spirit the prophet and the bride
[43:02] have to say the same thing because your
[43:05] Original Seed has to come from the Mount
[43:06] of God that's how you know his Original
[43:08] Seed other than that is intellectual and
[43:11] gray matter trying to interpret what is
[43:13] sealed in the book oh give the Lord a
[43:16] praise offering glory to God this
[43:19] Original Seed note my words original

[48:46] devil is still a liar there's gonna be a
[48:48] Rapture I'll give the Lord some Praises
[48:50] amen
[48:51] so the seed life the seed that need rain
[48:54] to activate the growth process is not
[48:57] what the same church it was about
[48:59] the seven Church Ages was the unfolding
[49:02] of God's seed that was planted on the
[49:04] day of Pentecost which was the original
[49:06] seed that is why brother Ram couldn't
[49:09] bring something new
[49:11] he had to turn our hearts back yeah
[49:15] to the feet of the fathers because the
[49:18] faith of the fathers was the original
[49:20] you can't go outside of the original you
[49:23] have to go back to the original Oh Glory
[49:25] the god things weren't perfected from
[49:26] the original so to go back you talk
[49:29] about the poor you have to go back to
[49:30] pay a Pentecost you have to go back to
[49:31] Spirit you have to go back to Power
[49:33] because that is where the church full
[49:34] started out okay the Lord that praise
[49:37] offering Oh Glory to God
[49:40] hallelujah hallelujah but that first
[49:43] church didn't live for the coming of the
[49:44] Lord
[49:45] we are going to be living for the coming
[49:47] of the Lord
[49:48] [Music]
[49:50] so that first church did not have the
[49:52] oil that is required now for who also
[49:54] have in our lamps
[49:56] and the reason is oil and land is
[49:58] nighttime
[50:03] they all stumble and set
[50:07] but at midnight a wake-up call came Oh
[50:11] Glory to God the bride had no Revival
[50:13] yet it will take them seven thumbnails
[50:16] to wake up the price wake up call not
[50:19] just by Revelation but by a
[50:21] manifestation he said what we see should
[50:23] make a church that will make a Revival
[50:25] that we would find from everywhere they
[50:27] say the seven thunders of Revelation is
[50:30] being made manifest
[50:33] manifest not resilience
[50:36] manifested the Lord some shout I know we
[50:38] don't have those words but we've seen it
[50:40] like it is oh glory to God it has to
[50:43] come to that spot
[50:44] my God hallelujah glory to God
[50:49] hallelujah so this seed is what God
[50:52] promised to restore to turn the hearts
[50:54] of the children back to the faith of the
[50:57] fathers to bring back the oil
[51:00] the spirit
[51:01] Jewish members with books and tapes
[51:05] messages

[1:07:52] and with the insecurity the preaching
[1:07:54] message to their level of insecurity
[1:07:57] to protect themselves and the prophet
[1:07:59] said Force anointed bang the People by

[1:08:44] purification
[1:08:47] which is sexy judgment well the
[1:08:49] tribulation is the reward of the foolish
[1:08:51] vision for being so foolish having a

[1:19:35] message or give the Lord some prisons I

[1:31:17] we can't have faith enough
[1:31:20] for Divine Healing
[1:31:22] how are we going to have rapture
[1:31:26] so there has to have a Revival of
[1:31:28] healing again
[1:31:30] it has to have I'll write this trailer
[1:31:32] once more it has to have the power of
[1:31:34] God demonstrated because let me read it

[1:31:38] partner
[1:31:39] yeah
[1:31:42] okay let's go to you
[1:32:01] there was a lie
[1:32:04] all right

[1:32:08] calling going forward
[1:32:09] you say when we see the hand of God
[1:32:11] moving on to signs and wonders let's
[1:32:14] start falling on
[1:32:16] I believe we are on the Borderland
[1:32:18] tonight and I was wondering about all my
[1:32:21] meetings and things I had to cancel them
[1:32:23] out I truly believe here we go before
[1:32:26] the church can have the Rapture it's got
[1:32:29] to have Rapture in feet we can't eat my
[1:32:31] faith for Divine Healing lesson Faith
[1:32:33] you've got to have faith that will
[1:32:35] change and Quicken this body and we take
[1:32:38] no way and I believe there's a
[1:32:39] children's root tonight a power of the
[1:32:42] Living God that men will speak the word
[1:32:44] here and there it will flush like
[1:32:46] lightning and our church is coming out
[1:32:48] not a psychologist not some put on make
[1:32:51] believe but a real genuine anointed Holy
[1:32:54] Ghost called out Church
[1:32:57] all right
[1:33:02] I have a little testimony before the
[1:33:04] prayer line just at the time they
[1:33:06] promised about to be fulfilled the
[1:33:07] Israelites were fearing presumptuously
[1:33:08] down in Egypt they were getting along
[1:33:10] all right a great Prestige that Joseph
[1:33:12] had before the King by Stephen Egypt in
[1:33:15] the seven years of family and God had
[1:33:16] given fever but when there come a time
[1:33:18] for the promise to be fulfilled there is
[1:33:20] about pharaoh who knew not Joseph
[1:33:22] and they begin a persecution and it
[1:33:25] caused in the persecution is that cause
[1:33:28] that the people had to go to crowding
[1:33:30] together and praying
[1:33:31] what did it
[1:33:33] the persecution no no the persecution
[1:33:37] caused the people to get together and
[1:33:40] praying and always always persecution
[1:33:45] strengthens the cause
[1:33:47] it's been to the age persecution
[1:33:50] I have there's an echo yeah
[1:33:52] I have a great faith to believe
[1:33:56] that one day
[1:34:00] our little
[1:34:06] [Applause]
[1:34:12] Liberty principle
[1:34:15] I got faith so he's talking about the
[1:34:16] persecution time right he said I have
[1:34:19] great faith to believe that one day
[1:34:21] before the coming of the Lord that our
[1:34:23] differences will be settled God may have
[1:34:26] to let communism sweep us together
[1:34:30] but something will take place
[1:34:32] that will make us all one heart in one
[1:34:34] Accord
[1:34:35] then he goes down if we cannot Faith No
[1:34:39] for healing how are we going to have
[1:34:41] Rapture and faith

[1:34:45] things please
[1:34:46] before the greetings

[1:34:53] there will be something that will cause
[1:34:55] he said okay I'll ask
[1:35:01] Jesus said to this mountain and so on he
[1:35:03] said we are now road now sooner coming
[1:35:05] to the Lord Jesus we have got to have
[1:35:06] Rapture and faith in a church that can
[1:35:08] be changed in a moment in the treatment
[1:35:09] of an eye to go out or we will not go
[1:35:12] but don't worry it will be there it will
[1:35:14] be there
[1:35:15] then here come the prophecy when the

[1:36:48] something fixing to happen yes that
[1:36:49] these old man five bodies are going to

[1:37:10] really them seven Thunders fixing out to
[1:37:12] utter something that the little group

[1:37:44] seal almost finished
[1:37:46] here we go it's something that we have
[1:37:49] heard for years but I hope that you hit
[1:37:51] a different way tonight
[1:37:53] and there's coming forth seven
[1:37:54] mysterious Thunders that are not even
[1:37:56] written at all and I believe
[1:37:59] that through those seven Thunders
[1:38:03] will be revealed in the last days in
[1:38:06] order to get the bride together
[1:38:08] for rapturing feet
[1:38:09] [Applause]
[1:38:17] what is the spirit
[1:38:18] so the seven times we revealed in order
[1:38:20] to get the bride together for what to
[1:38:22] hear some mighty man coming from me
[1:38:25] some oh Yoho
[1:38:28] he had to go right back to Oyo
[1:38:30] the seven Thunders
[1:38:31] Garden right together for the pride to
[1:38:34] get
[1:38:35] wrapped twin feet because what we got
[1:38:37] right now we wouldn't be able to do it
[1:38:42] who said so brother to you no the
[1:38:45] prophet said so he says there's
[1:38:49] something we have got to step further
[1:38:51] we can't have enough faith for Divine
[1:38:54] Healing hardly we have got to have
[1:38:56] enough Faith to be changed in a moment
[1:38:58] to be swept off of his Earth and after a
[1:39:01] while the Lord will find where it is
[1:39:03] written
[1:39:04] oh man

[1:39:22] hour the Rapture and feet to take the
[1:39:24] church out
[1:39:25] of this thing before judgment come
[1:39:28] judgment is fixing to strike
[1:39:30] and I say as my friend Jack Moore said
[1:39:32] if God lets America get by with the
[1:39:35] thing is doing now he'll be morally
[1:39:37] obligated to raise up song tomorrow and
[1:39:39] apologize to him for building up and we
[1:39:41] don't know as a man asked me a few
[1:39:43] moments ago please I bought it coming up
[1:39:46] and the rapture
[1:39:47] we have lived the time out
[1:39:50] at the time of the Raptors at hand
[1:39:53] and we are looking here we go
[1:39:56] for a rapturing faith that can pull the
[1:40:00] church together
[1:40:01] and give it some Supernatural strength
[1:40:04] that can change these bodies that we
[1:40:06] live in
[1:40:07] and then he
[1:40:08] dropping something here
[1:40:10] when we see a god
[1:40:13] that can raise the Dead
[1:40:15] off of the floor or out of the yard
[1:40:19] and bring him back to life again and
[1:40:22] present him before us when we see a God
[1:40:25] who can take a cancer that eats a man to
[1:40:29] a shadow and raise him up to a strong
[1:40:31] healthy man that
[1:40:33] ought to give Rapture and Faith to the
[1:40:36] people
[1:40:37] he doesn't say when we see a message
[1:40:39] preach and he rarely bring that good
[1:40:42] word
[1:40:43] he didn't say that
[1:40:44] he pointed to a manifestation that would
[1:40:47] light the people of Fire into a
[1:40:50] rapturing feet
[1:40:53] and I am looking for a Time
[1:40:57] fought of the spirit of God in last days
[1:40:59] that we're now living in for another
[1:41:01] search of the Holy Spirit into the
[1:41:04] church for a rapturing feet before it
[1:41:08] comes oh my Hallelujah
[1:41:12] my God let me close off of this
[1:41:15] begin to play something
[1:41:16] you know remember we earned horsepower
[1:41:19] too talk about calm down the church is
[1:41:21] moving up the holy ghost power is the
[1:41:24] holy ghost that we are justified by
[1:41:26] the Holy Ghost sanctify us
[1:41:28] your Holy Ghost fills us
[1:41:29] the Holy Ghost gives us Rapture and
[1:41:32] faith
[1:41:33] who does that
[1:41:35] the Holy Ghost gives us Rapture and
[1:41:37] Faith all right so we right down to the
[1:41:39] end here now
[1:41:40] did you notice how we backed up
[1:41:42] everywhere by his living presence
[1:41:43] consciously yes see that shows you don't
[1:41:47] have to just think we're just trying to
[1:41:48] say something some kind of mythical
[1:41:50] something what the what the Bible
[1:41:52] promised that's the truth
[1:41:53] let's talk about your anointing coming
[1:41:54] and confirming the word all right
[1:41:57] here it is bye
[1:41:59] we trust that God will give us great
[1:42:00] faith and tomorrow there will not be a
[1:42:03] feeble person left in the building when
[1:42:05] they come to you for prayer we just
[1:42:07] believe that no we will believe it no
