the house of the lord this morning you may please be seated amen what a time praise god the enemy is that what is the bible say when the enemy comes in like a flood then the spirit of god will raise a standard against him so satan can't keep the body down satan cannot keep the church down satan cannot keep the bride down we are destined for our time as days praise god that is why the world is

come to pass that whoso whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shalt be delivered in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance as the lord has said in the remnant whom the lord shall call praise god so we thank god amen may the lord add a blessing to the reign of his word we believe that we are being called we believe that we have been chosen we believe that god has destined us for this day there is no better time to have come than this day when everything is failing but god has planted you here to call upon his name that you will receive praise god so i want to take this opportunity to thank you and to greet each and everyone that is tuning this weekend we are inviting you to dine with us praise god let it not just be another social media program but let it be jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever streaming into your homes into your churches and blessing you this weekend so i certainly want to appreciate the ministers that will be ministering they are churches they are wives and all those that will be tuning in may the lord richly bless you praise god as we hook in this weekend now i want to read a quote praise god from the prophet believers now this 1960 you maybe see that but abraham said he said i am the vine and ye are the branches if a grapevine puts forth a shoot it comes up with plenty blue grapes the next vine it puts out will have pretty blue grapes on it if the first vine came out and they fell under the impact of the holy spirit and they did they did great miracles and signs and sealed their testimony praise god seal their testimony to a world even many of them with their own testimony with their blood they sealed their testimony they went through all kinds of perils and everything to bring the gospel praise god they went through storms hallelujah they went to perils they went through all kinds of trials but they drove home their testimonies that they are sons and daughters for their day praise god if they went through that they suffered they were beaten they were punished they said must we be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sell to bloody seas what do we expect to do i must fight if i must reign increase my courage lord praise god but abram said we don't need a new denomination hallelujah we don't need a new gathering we don't need a new convention we don't need a new denomination we don't need a new czech building what we need today is the old time backwood sky blue scene killing pentecostal revival praise god that was born at pentacles and is back into the church again the power of the holy spirit again to bring jesus christ on the scene we want jesus christ on the sin this weekend if the sick walk in here they shall be healed they shall be delivered if you are bound you shall be set free we want jesus christ on the scene praise god sons of god must be manifested praise god and that is why we are here that is our commission that is our purpose that is why god places us on the earth at this time praise god to call jesus on the scene praise god and we see how the world is confused but brother we are standing on the rock of ages we are standing on the rock that cannot be moved no virus can stop the bride no situation can stop the bride no no praise god no persecution no depression can stop that church of the living god praise be the name of the living god so we cry out tonight amen that we will find our place hallelujah amen the prophet said in a hidden light and i'm done praise god hallelujah oh praise god amen he said now i believe that the time that i believe that is the time that the church has arrived at today have we arrived everything is pointing that the coming of the lord is here but before we leave we must check this world with a short quick powerful message that will shake this world praise god and let them know that there are sons and daughters of god upon the face of the earth oh glory to god i believe that that it is the time that the church has arrived at today that the next great move in the church is for god it's not for you now the next great move in the church is for god so it is not your ideas it is not your expectations is what god has decreed for this weekend for sons and daughters of god the next great move is for god after we've seen false alarms praise god but now god will place in his church correctly apostles and prophets and teachers and evangelists not man-made seminary praise god protein but god will place into the church no theology runovers and overnights but god will place in the church as god has chosen god has some sons chosen he has got some children chosen and he's about to place them in this day praise god hallelujah oh glory be to the living god as god has chosen as the holy ghost has tuted his church and raised it up and in there god will adopt her god will adopt into the position of his sons they are already his sons but whatever they are is that but whether they are worthy of the position that he has for them praise god so that is why we are striving now we are sons but we are looking to be placed we are looking to be put in our position as sons and daughters of god hallelujah oh praise god and the last one the seed is not aired with the shock but the problem said the world is in the sudden condition and the church has went into sodom with it like lord and his wife that is why the love of many is what's cold but not the bride because we have got the material on the edge right now praise god to rise up about the deadness rise up about the sudden condition to find our position and i say that there is an electric somewhere in the world oh are you one of them i know you are one of them there is an electric somewhere in the world that is pulling out and set aside from those things praise god and the manifestation of god has attracted his attention we are at the last days praise god so we are here if we are at the last days we must see the manifestation we must see the signs we must see the wonders we must see the character of the spirit of god moving his sons and daughters of god positionally placing you in your place so this weekend i trust that the lord will bless you praise god open your heart open your mind don't come here fixated brother probably you come expecting what to receive don't treat it like another virtual service oh praise god but enter into the spirit for where two or three are guarded i am in the amazed in your homes being the spirit in the church being the spirit in your cast being the spirit if you

stretch your wings to the heavenlies and you don't have to struggle you don't have to fight to strive just straight showings in the grace of god the power is already in heaven it's already here it takes you see we have to know how to go into that channel into that condition to fly to fly away we have to know the rules of god god has helped us we were lost in sin finish there was nothing more for us and he came down and changed his situation through his precious blood gave his blood paid the price and came himself to dwell in us to bring us a new nature you must you must always remember this your old nature when you are born again see the stardust lord jesus i am wrong help me this is always a star to come in his presence i am wrong i cannot make it help me and he came to help and he is coming with his spiritual help and he will tell you words when you start to believe these words promises when you start to believe it when you start to receive it oh yes lord that's mine salvation is mine you start to enter in a divine channel in heavenly places and the kingdom of god opens for you this is god's way you can think about you can try to understand you can read read the whole bible you may know the whole bible that is this is this is not the dynamic you can explain the to others the kingdom of god but it needs a dynamic it's neither that personal to you you are my savior you see that's dynamic you are my healer you have healed me completely you are my all in all you see that's dynamic that's why the testimony of jesus christ is so important you testify in these heavenly places coming closer and closer down into your soul and your new creation starts when you are born again by the spirit of god by the word of god then a new creation starts and this creation is jesus christ and you become full of jesus christ there is a power in the wind of the holy spirit already so the holy spirit lays in the word in the promise when you read what jesus said speaks in the bible but the disciples speak inspired by the holy spirit there is a spirit and the bible says we are sealed by the spirit of promise in this promising spirit and you are sealed by it and you get filled every day every hour this is a normal christian life i am not there but i press to it and it will come stronger and stronger and people will not understand me because it will not be me anymore it will be him he will change us our situation our home our marriages everything our families he is doing this change and it is a new creation it is him personal it is his spirit in every detail which he lived in in in in two thousand years ago is in every detail coming into your soul sitting on the throne and you just surrender i'm not saying lord i'm wrong you see this is the start to tell him and send wait what he says and he will say i love you i forgive you i i forget it and and you enter this channel we have to know how to end this channel we have to know how to enter in the third realm of the kingdom of god it's all around us right away upon the power of the holy ghost how do you ride on this power how to take your wings and fly he is my healer personally sen sen you feel the power of the power is coming he is my savior he has filled me overflowing there's no unbelief anymore in me there is light the morning star has arise we stay alive is a new everything changing my personal experience and i can say this because you live by that you know this personal experience it's so important how to to know how to set the wings the power is already in the heavenly place is already there it's it's an you need to know how and it is not trying like a bird trying to run until you get speed to get up it's not cis it's by his grace i'm wrong but you have staying all the wrongness out of me and we are only a vessel we are not more than a vessel and 16 elements and it's him we are members of his body our wrestle is our 16 elements and he fills our emptiness he fills it and we ride away problems set sail into it free in jesus christ you begin to go inside god when the wind of the holy ghost lifts you we need that wind from pentecost from the original pentecost it's the same wind blowing again it's jesus christ in every detail coming into your soul and you fellowship with him and he starts to know you you open up he said this is my problem this is i have done since i still keep will you help me can you do this for me you become into a relationship and it and it's a growing and then he tells you believe that your old nature has left you brother brahms explained to to a browser he said it's still behind there not in front because in front you see christ crucified the world is crucified you see it it's but it's behind it's sticking behind you it's the old nature always try to stick on you but it's no more in here in your soul is no unbelief it's you see all these seeds from the word of god are already in you but sealed up but when his grace comes he has saved me it's it's a glory coming down he has saved me the glory he has filled me his glory he brings me through see when when this comes down it opens every word this glory comes and is opening what's already sealed in you it's opening and your face starts to shine all these thoughts are going all has left you isn't that wonderful let me trust this this one this two one quote and then i try to finish confess you're wrong we have to know how to sail into that wind and to to start is to confess you are wrong to him and brother ram said i am always wrong and we confess it birth pains it's hard to die but die right now die come out of your own unbelief come out of it this is the word of god made manifest just as it was when jesus come on the earth it's jesus christ again among you proven he was problem was a manifested son of god this new creation came into full power besides his mistakes christ knows he is a judge he has paid for all the mistakes all the failures all the sin he has paid it's gone and jesus is coming again says his spirit you see you must make sure that his spirit that comes to you is jesus christ personally to you in every aspect in every detail except his physical body brother branham said so he showed us away he showed us how to fly it's jesus coming again that's his spirit he's so close to the earth so close to coming that he is ready to receive you if you are ready to receive him how does receiving start lord i am wrong i cannot receive it in my condition cleans me and is cleaning you this is what he is doing by his grace and by the face once delivered to the saints we believe this [Applause] it's just knowing how to set your wings in the power of his face and when the holy ghost comes in rides and waves higher deeper more more more because is a longing in this new creature has a longing it wants to grow it wants to become adopted wants to become fully in charge fully in charge and this is what the process will preach i believe in this coming in this convention now to the manifestation of the sons of god dynamics revival virtue convention 2020 this is this is a convention to the manifestation of the sons of god dynamics revival sees a dynamic it's not about explaining it becomes life when you accept it and hallelujah you understand this in your heart you have experience you do the same and here let me close with this people put your heart in order with god and the heavens will come down in your presence we must do first things first this is how we come into the presence the prophet hell showed us this way the bible shows it to us and you will see the glory of god get your heart right get face yourself full see if you don't believe said in your heart can come a total face make a total love that jesus christ can fill you totally in your soul and in your spirit you have to believe this and then look for it look for it accept it get your heart right get face your sail full time sail for yourself and when god's wind of power moves through the building you will catch away in it and sail up out of your sickness and travel i'm finished let's pray lord jesus may this overwhelm us lord jesus see his promises you said the kingdom of god will open by it when we accept this grace when we accept his promises that my soul can be full of your virtue father you have promised this seven sunder revival a life revival with

you hey you have eaten the book you're mostly that manifest the time the manifesto to deliver all nature in nature itself is growing me amen waiting for the time of manifestation before the atonement

it it must be by the person he chose was he a man so placing amen when god chose paul because was he paul it shook up the people religion not him yes him we will be when god makes a choice when he chose peter but he's got such a temper but god chose peter the jewish was a pierre a man and another thing when it came to prayer god told those people you ask job they want their job to pray for you for him will i accept you you can't choose what suits you politically you have to do things according to god's will praise be to god can you say amen to these things and these are men in other words

knows it it knows the key amen hallelujah it doesn't know who's holding it hallelujah when we speak amen he says uh so you have to have this sharp tool the the word of god to shape them pull it for me if you're holding that key basically you can't be a hypocrite a man you you can't be just a church member houston i mean you you caught you caught you can't be a a secret sinner yeah you and squirrels so he must know who you are a man amen amen there must be a sharp tool the word of god to shape them only for me into the sons of the buildings hallelujah oh my god shoes to save this pedigree and we are we we are not back in 65 63 we say lord send something lord to save this this this church before you can see a miracle you have to become one praise be to his wonderful name amen may you shape us in you may you shape those rocks it's still fascinating that they may come together in solomon's you have to leave it totally see no hands amen hallelujah amen leave it let's learn let the plummet speak lest if the prophet said it i believe it is it says who has despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice be wrong and see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven alex is set and of course the prophet explained explicit they're the seven messengers read if and it makes you angry is it true if it's true sorry honey this is desolation you are right you are a zone amen if your children say something and you don't like it but it's true because say sorry guys now i see stay true amen keep me true lord jesus keep me true true songs is hallelujah you have to be born from the very beginning born again of incorruptible seeds what a revelation that is amen amen true sounds boring amen the gift should be in in you from from the parents elected hallelujah amen there's yeah you're sanctified by believing but when you are filled because it's humbly with the holy ghost i mean filled with your own plea it is the person the person of the holy ghost himself your sentence feeling remember man oh the person or a person not an imagination an imagination or some psychology psychology he said no but the person i'm in a person of the holy ghost you sentence me filled wrong please when you are filled with god oh please amen amen ain't no wonder brother branham made the statement oh cap off the pyramids of our lives when we are filled and that person said person lives in as we move along praise god we he said we've got to try the spirits back into adoption and this man claims a certain thing try it see if it's right keep moving amen that's right when the church gets into his mighty power please come on come on positionally hallelujah and the people god chooses it joshua amy we've had this in sunday school he called you the most is not what man thinks the basic lump bonds are men they thought well soul must be the man sorry to sit up and look at the son of jesus he is so strong oh this is amen hallelujah because david was the one pre-destinated and he was to take the place of king and he said there had to be a selection and went up to jesse's house amen that's god's choice well you can say that brother branham i i wasn't called to be a preacher you might be called to be a housewife domestic the kitchen sink is a powerful place some housewives more powerful than some preachers because they are in position my man says i wasn't called to be a preacher you're a powerful housewife a powerful mother train my mom present praise be to god you're in your position position praise be to god that's one way the placing of the placement of the feast adoption amen just as much as david david could kill goliath if we triggle you can kill those demons your prayer will be the stones that will stop that that giant amen praise be to [Music] before the foundation of the world he was bringing forth you to produce it knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body he says look you are to responsible he gives his warning he done to his advertisement warning then judgment is more sweet he gives his warning to we are new of a responsibility responsibility we are responsible and god has put us here in jerusalem on the earth for a reason and that reason he has put us here foreign [Applause] and then through this issue hallelujah the adoption do you know joshua was adopted adoptee when he met the captain until uncontrolled the captain the captain joshua was placed just created blessings he took his shoes off and he received orders how to go around jericho it's another another great subject praise be to god you can't play and he was killed in 83 usaid died was yesterday he was out of position amen even amen amen we must get that position knew the one wasn't positioned and be a prisoner of the lord jesus christ hallelujah look at peter amen when he was walking by he was just immortal he was born of sinful flesh just like i oru but people needed a healer so god sent peter to do that specific work specifically he had a position peter yeah didn't have the love wow in his heart that john had john was a different person was god's agency of love so when he took peter james and john was in james he said jacques he was the one who set the church in order faith was in peter charity was enjoyed amen amen and hope faith charity let's be honest on that position if god tells you legitimately to plant corn the plantain juice amen don't go in his fields he says he says he won't keep his ground in vapores ephraim won't keep his ground god won't keep his ground but i see that we do it benjamin won't keep his ground they're running with philistines but we have been and he says about speaking with tongues he says the person he was advising the permits speak in tongues or prophesy the prophet isaiah because excuse me it's the nature the prophet discerned them the prophet told them how to uh what to ask god for the quran that's you that's and then it puts them what it's a plus one under a four sue in catrion and puts them in a split condition they don't know what to do listen to this great discerning voice and they say oh the lord wants me to do this this is all the same because you see it is out of place you see how the prophet advised them so many things it's very important that we maintain our position what god made us to do then you will be powerful praise spirit of god just one way god is trying to place his peace you don't understand the whole church wants to be like that one please don't say i've heard welcome serena who have the same kind of things he said no [Music] we are positionally placed [Music] another for a large worker a doormat at the house of the lord you said yeah and to dwell in the tense of wickedness how many understands the point position of placing the plasma position adoption he says he that's right he says when god chooses a person congestion listen to this you see he says when god does it by his own choosing whether he's educated or not educated he fits the gift the manner that he will preach and the gifts that he will have and the message for that certain age god's predestinated that certain things it certainly shows to happen and not another thing can take his place he does his man exactly so amen it's very powerful when you are in line concert only as a true sound okay and i feel something this humply that's what you are let's get you here you are in your position doing our prayer meeting man i pray it is powerful man but even cornelius with the most powerful prayer meetings he had to call the right man because peter then the holy and then uh just like brother branham says we all want the ball because we all want to score that's gonna volunteer but it's better sometimes to pass the ball you feel a pass amen that he passed the ball for somebody else to score and then what happens [Music] we all want to pack the ball and then we all want to do yeah and then we missed the gold players hey i appreciate the goals moved all right knew he [Music] hallelujah is amen hallelujah amen even even when samuel died because he was still a prophet hallelujah amen when the witch but he was he says see the man when he dies it doesn't change his place status it's on statue he doesn't change his makeup moses who is still a prophet he says when brother branham got up to into heaven he said they're all hugging me why did you put me up here because you made me always see you were a and leader in life don't like v amen when you die don't you murder he was still a leader you're the mayor leader praise be to god still a prophet what can we say to these things church as i begin to close off now that god is here could you it is sea and the only thing that shows that he is waiting for that is for his army to get their position like the stars take to get to their position like the stars come visit the stars don't move visit one of the players they hold their position opposition and the sons of god songs defeats me uh feel some defeat it might be some weakness say charge the charge amen it might it might be sickness amen amen amen the is setting themselves in a race oh [Music] what can we amen these bones says
