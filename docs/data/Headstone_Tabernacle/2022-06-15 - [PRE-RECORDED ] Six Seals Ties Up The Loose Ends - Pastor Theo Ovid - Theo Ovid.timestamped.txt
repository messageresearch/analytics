[20:18] with brother message
[20:20] amen praise god amen
[20:24] our version five reading from verse one
[20:26] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[20:27] sat on the throne
[20:29] a book written within
[20:31] notice how the words are placed the
[20:34] the book is written within
[20:36] but on the back side
[20:38] sealed
[20:39] with seven seals
[20:41] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming a
[20:42] lord voice who is worthy to open the
[20:45] book and to loose the caesar of open
[20:49] and loose seals
[20:50] and no one in heaven knowing earth
[20:52] needed under the earth was able to open
[20:53] the book he doesn't look there on i wept
[20:55] much because no man was found worthy to
[20:57] open
[20:58] to read a book neither looked around
[21:00] one of the elders said unto me weep not
[21:02] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[21:04] the root of david had prevailed to open
[21:06] the book and to loose the seven seas
[21:08] thereof and i beheld and lo
[21:10] in the midst of the throne of the four
[21:12] beasts and in the midst of the elders to
[21:13] the lamb as it had been seen having
[21:15] seven horns and seven eyes
[21:18] which are the seven spirits of god sent
[21:20] forth
[21:21] into all the it and he came and took the
[21:22] book out of the right hand
[21:24] of him that sat upon the throne and when
[21:26] he had taken the book
[21:28] the four beasts formed when the elders
[21:29] fell down before the lamb having every
[21:31] one of them harps and golden virus full
[21:33] of waters which are the prayers of
[21:35] saints they saw a new song saying that
[21:38] was worthy to take the book and to open
[21:40] the seas thereof for dao
[21:43] has redeemed us to god by thy blood out
[21:46] of every kindred and tongue and people
[21:48] and nation and has made us unto our god
[21:51] kings and priests and we shall reign on
[21:54] the earth version 8
[21:56] verse 1.
[21:59] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[22:02] there was silence in heaven
[22:04] about a space
[22:05] of half an hour
[22:07] and a last scripture from version
[22:09] chapter 10
[22:10] reading
[22:13] another mighty angel come down from him
[22:15] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[22:17] upon his head his face had his wooden
[22:19] sun his feet and spills the fire he has
[22:21] in his hand
[22:22] a little book open and he set his right
[22:24] foot up on the sea his left foot on the
[22:27] earth and cried with a loud voice and
[22:28] when a lion roared and when he had cried
[22:31] seven thunders uttered the voices and
[22:33] when the seven thunders had uttered the
[22:34] voices i was about to write i heard a
[22:36] voice from heaven seen unto me seed up
[22:38] those things
[22:39] which the seven thunders uttered and
[22:41] write them not and the angel which i saw
[22:44] stand upon the sea and upon the earth
[22:46] lifted up his hands to heaven and swear
[22:49] by him that lived forever and ever who
[22:51] created heaven and the things that
[22:52] therein are on the earth and the things
[22:54] that are there and on the sea and the
[22:56] things which are therein that there
[22:58] should be time
[22:59] no longer but in the days of the voice
[23:02] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[23:05] to song the mystery of god to be
[23:07] finished as he had declared to serve as
[23:09] the prophets let's pray one more time

[23:53] ends
[23:54] that's the title
[23:56] i had a whole long thing to continue but
[23:59] we'll leave it for the next part of this
[24:01] consider the seventh seal but this part
[24:04] according six seals ties up the loose
[24:06] ends
[24:08] of a team
[24:09] let the main thing
[24:12] be the main thing
[24:14] that's the team let the main thing
[24:16] be the main thing
[24:18] another inspiration
[24:20] nothing else matters
[24:22] when you see the real message
[24:26] nothing else matters when you see
[24:29] the real message
[24:33] and you know
[24:35] it's something else when you see things
[24:38] in a way
[24:40] you can't unsee it
[24:42] or you think about that no you ever see
[24:44] a picture and they ask you do you see a
[24:46] woman in it or do you see an old woman
[24:48] in it or something else in it and you're
[24:50] looking looking and you see like a
[24:52] rabbit or something else and once you
[24:54] see the picture in it you can't unsee it
[24:57] because it's like you see it your cedar
[25:00] and this is what we want to get to
[25:01] tonight
[25:02] oh hallelujah when you see
[25:05] the real message

[25:19] friend or no friend live or die
[25:22] denomination or no denomination let

[25:38] and this is very unusual what i'm doing
[25:40] here this morning but i'm going to do it
[25:42] normally a way to get to this title or
[25:45] the inspiration or the subject but i'm
[25:47] going to take that up first
[25:49] what we're talking about the title the
[25:51] subject the team i'm going to deal with
[25:53] that at first
[25:55] this is the prophet here now
[25:57] he said now
[25:58] uh all right
[26:01] you're talking about world revival

[26:05] understand or figure out all the
[26:07] mechanics was in the revival during the
[26:08] world
[26:09] and they got off the ship with their
[26:11] tall hats on wrong color scene coming
[26:14] down the street a little policeman
[26:15] swinging his club around around like
[26:17] that whistling he said good good man

[26:24] standing in the middle of it
[26:28] you say you understand i am the world
[26:29] revival
[26:31] because the wealth revival is in me
[26:34] he said that sovereign that what god
[26:37] does he alone has a right to send a
[26:40] revival

[29:57] i'll skip let's get that let's do this
[29:59] i want to skip down a little bit
[30:01] but god has his words set

[30:08] people sitting things
[30:10] okay now jesus said father i thank thee
[30:13] father that was hid these things on the
[30:15] eyes of the wines and prudent and

[30:23] did it but you say i chose you but you
[30:25] and don't choose you but by his for
[30:27] knowledge he knowed what you would do
[30:30] but his full knowledge he know what you
[30:33] will do
[30:34] when he was party and vetting he knew
[30:35] you would repent when he was carrying on
[30:37] he knew you will come out of your
[30:38] nonsense you will cut your foolishness
[30:41] he knew you would come to that spot when
[30:42] i was a child i act like a child i speak
[30:44] like a child
[30:46] whatever but when i became a man i put
[30:47] away childish things there are things
[30:49] you have to put away he is not going to
[30:51] come and put it away for you
[30:53] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[30:56] oh god the pastor's in house this
[30:58] morning he's not going to come and put
[31:00] it away for you you have to put certain
[31:02] things away when i say put it put it
[31:04] kick it throw it out
[31:07] [Applause]
[31:09] all right
[31:10] here we go
[31:12] how many ever seen the picture of a car
[31:14] in the bush
[31:16] that you have to look and look
[31:18] did you ever see that
[31:20] or see the picture of christ in a bush
[31:22] or sky or clouds that the painter has
[31:25] got it so fixed
[31:26] till you have to look at it a certain
[31:28] way
[31:29] and when
[31:30] once you see it
[31:32] you can't see nothing else
[31:35] but that
[31:37] hallelujah
[31:39] every time you look there it is
[31:42] how many seen those pictures we're sure
[31:44] you have
[31:45] well that's the way christ is himself
[31:48] the gospel the message
[31:50] when you once see the message of the
[31:54] hour there is nothing else you can see
[31:56] but that
[31:59] everything else is gone
[32:02] the rest of it is filler
[32:06] when you won't see the message
[32:09] the rest of it is
[32:10] filler
[32:14] so when somebody gave you a gift
[32:16] this is how you get a gift like a gift
[32:18] bag this is a gift
[32:21] you don't have anything and say look
[32:22] look that is a gift
[32:24] this is how you get a gift
[32:27] the gift does get wrapped
[32:29] well
[32:30] you see this little paper thing here
[32:35] you see this here didn't have to give
[32:36] him
[32:38] this is way called fuller
[32:41] this just make it look nice and
[32:43] and so on all right
[32:57] [Applause]
[33:00] a punch is a sexy gift
[33:10] now to get to the gift you have to rip
[33:11] off
[33:13] only seals
[33:21] and then when you get here and always
[33:23] have more
[33:28] filler
[33:30] material
[33:35] and then
[33:36] they give it like something for my wife
[33:38] you know but this is a gift
[33:41] [Applause]
[33:50] so here i want to get you now
[33:54] the prophet brought a message
[33:56] are we going to get it
[33:58] it has superneed
[34:00] baptism in jesus name it have a lot of
[34:02] mysteries inside of it that is filler
[34:05] material
[34:08] you can go on the to the rapture until
[34:10] concede
[34:13] you can't go on the rapture on rome
[34:15] falls
[34:16] you can't go on the rapture on any
[34:17] nonsense and any little lighting no you
[34:20] can't go you have to get to the message
[34:25] so when you see the message the rest is
[34:27] filler
[34:30] so we want
[34:32] to let the main thing
[34:35] be the main thing
[34:37] say after me let the main thing
[34:39] be the main thing
[34:41] you know sometimes husband and wife have
[34:43] chorus and fusses
[34:44] another setup filler
[34:47] material
[34:49] that they fussing and carrying about
[34:50] it's not the main thing
[34:52] because everything have a main thing you
[34:54] know
[34:55] everything has a root cause
[34:57] the reason we're talking about seals
[35:00] and book is because something happened
[35:02] in gardner eden
[35:04] that is why we are dressing this thing
[35:06] called this book and they see it's not
[35:08] this great thing that you have to go and
[35:09] get a degree to understand each other
[35:12] man fell
[35:13] adam was supposed to call other sons
[35:16] by name
[35:20] you know before you you were born your
[35:22] mother father had a name for you
[35:25] for his other fight if his boy or girl
[35:28] then they had to get a boy name or girl
[35:30] name
[35:31] and they're waiting for you to come out
[35:32] to tag that name on you
[35:35] but your name was before you ah jesus
[35:38] oh give the lord a shout
[35:41] do you get that
[35:42] so god put your name before you
[35:45] he put your name in the book
[35:48] before he expressed you
[35:50] so when you come forth you come to
[35:51] connect with
[35:53] your name
[35:55] and when you see
[35:56] your name you're going to behave the
[35:59] same with john be here
[36:01] because he was crying a while ago but
[36:04] somebody said we'd not
[36:06] the land of the tribe of judah had
[36:08] prevailed to take the book and to loose
[36:11] the seals thereof
[36:14] oh glory to god hallelujah
[36:17] although we could pray from now to the
[36:18] end of the year on israel
[36:20] are we still touchy sufficient
[36:23] we could put israeli flag here
[36:27] still at the receivers of it
[36:29] we could preach our second seed and get
[36:30] the trailer that is separated and speak
[36:32] six months and serpent
[36:35] and that can help you
[36:37] all you're seeing is supports
[36:39] hallelujah but we commented on to the
[36:41] bride's message
[36:43] which is your message
[36:45] don't miss it
[36:46] and once you see it you can't unsee it
[36:49] once you see it nobody can take you out
[36:51] of it if this church disappear if you
[36:55] still see it
[36:56] oh glory to god hallelujah it doesn't
[36:59] matter who come who go you still see it
[37:01] no demon not devil paul said this way
[37:04] what can separate me from the love of
[37:06] god that in christ jesus shall things
[37:08] present things to come nothing going to
[37:10] separate me
[37:15] so i wanted to bring that to you this
[37:17] morning
[37:18] let's say it again when
[37:20] you won't see the message of the hour
[37:23] nothing else you can see but that
[37:26] everything else is gone the rest of it
[37:28] is filler
[37:30] when you want to see the message
[37:33] that is what is noah's time
[37:35] when noah and his group who
[37:37] when they saw the message nothing else
[37:39] mattered
[37:40] when moses group saw it nothing else
[37:42] mattered when john group saw it nothing
[37:45] else mattered headstone tabernacle when
[37:47] you see it nothing else matter
[37:50] [Applause]
[37:51] all your complexes go go
[37:54] hallelujah all the nonsense go fly out
[37:56] your head fly out your spirits nothing
[37:58] else matters this world is about finish
[38:01] america is finished the kingdoms of this
[38:04] world is finished
[38:06] egypt was in power greek was in power
[38:08] all of them was in power but daniel saw
[38:10] a stone that we are connecting with
[38:13] the coming of the headstone oh glory to
[38:15] god and the prophecy when the bride near
[38:18] the headstone she'll be a super race
[38:20] she'll be a super people it'll be a
[38:22] super church oh could we get a shout in
[38:24] the house this morning
[38:26] oh hallelujah this is what i'm looking
[38:28] for
[38:31] [Applause]
[38:31] [Music]
[38:34] when john group saw it nothing mattered
[38:36] when jesus group saw it nothing else
[38:38] matter
[38:40] them dropped their nets they dropped
[38:42] their fishing they dropped their
[38:43] business to follow jesus nothing else
[38:44] matter oh glory to god when looter group
[38:47] saw when the apostle group saw it
[38:49] nothing else mattered when luther's
[38:51] group saw it where's the group saw it
[38:52] pentecostal group saw it nothing else
[38:54] mattered they pulled away from
[38:55] everything why by for knowledge he
[38:58] predestinated these things to happen
[39:04] so you have to see it
[39:06] what does habakkuk say right
[39:09] the vision
[39:10] and make it
[39:12] not complex plane
[39:14] that he that read that may run
[39:16] not work
[39:17] you have to run
[39:19] run means you spurred on with the action
[39:21] you are motivating to do more than just
[39:23] drip drifting along with everybody else
[39:26] this is no slow walk this is getting
[39:28] desperate
[39:29] right division
[39:30] make it pain that's what the fivefold
[39:32] was supposed to be doing for the last 50
[39:34] years making it plain that you see it
[39:37] could run and act upon it because what
[39:40] we see should make a church that would
[39:41] be acting upon it that will make a
[39:43] revival are we on the word this morning
[39:46] are we going good so far
[39:48] you have to check me out by the way you
[39:49] know
[39:50] [Applause]
[39:54] why are you saying it because you're
[39:55] going to find out enticing spirits and
[39:57] the classical spirits and demon spirit
[39:59] follow lotions
[40:03] let me say that again
[40:05] eclassical spirits demon spirits and
[40:08] tyson spirit follow
[40:10] loose ends
[40:11] say if a preacher not preaching the
[40:13] complete vision or the prophetic vision
[40:16] and impression on the loose ends demon
[40:18] activity is present
[40:20] because the devil rides on loose ends
[40:22] but god has nothing to lose sense
[40:24] business he just come to tie it up
[40:26] [Applause]
[40:33] and as saying this to you know
[40:35] you have to begin to tie up
[40:38] your loose ends
[40:39] [Applause]
[40:41] you're not clapping
[40:43] you're afraid to say amen or what
[40:45] who you expect to tie it up for you
[40:48] god had to come and tie up the loose
[40:49] ends before the power of god could rock
[40:51] true because the word is a conduct of
[40:53] the spirit and the word was scattered
[40:55] through all the ages and god had to
[40:57] gather it up gather it up gather it up
[41:00] line it up and then drop the spirit
[41:02] inside of here that is why you are here
[41:05] [Applause]
[41:10] no i
[41:12] i truly believe i was given this to
[41:13] share with you this morning
[41:16] all right
[41:20] [Music]
[41:27] people say there'll be a mark it's
[41:28] already my heart
[41:30] you reject the holy ghost you are mocked
[41:34] that's why any doctrine that one to
[41:37] play down the holy ghost and now the
[41:39] holy ghost dismissed the holy ghost tell
[41:41] the holy ghost take a leave any doctrine
[41:43] is satanic
[41:47] any doctrine
[41:48] that want to put the holy ghost as
[41:50] out of play
[41:52] and let man come into play
[41:54] that is lucifer again
[41:57] and we will expose him
[41:59] because the problem says when the bride
[42:00] recognized the two spirits working in
[42:02] the church
[42:03] you know once somebody by the bar and
[42:05] the united church and the two spirits
[42:06] working in the church one is a loose and
[42:08] spirits and one of the spirit was loose
[42:10] from under the seventh seal
[42:12] it's two different spirits all together
[42:14] oh glory to god but the sixties come to
[42:17] tie up the loose ends to introduce a
[42:19] seventh seed because under their silence
[42:21] the devil don't know what happened on
[42:22] the deer but there's gonna be a bragg
[42:24] and to know exactly what is happening
[42:26] under there or give the lord a shout
[42:29] this is for you you're coming to your
[42:31] message
[42:31] [Music]
[42:32] [Applause]
[42:34] receive the holy ghost you are mocked
[42:37] receive it once see what take place
[42:39] that's the mark of god
[42:41] you are sealed to your eternal
[42:43] destination
[42:44] like a car on the road the inspector
[42:46] comes now you didn't get the holy ghost
[42:48] that's that last night that went in here
[42:50] check up the night
[42:53] the inspector of the holy ghost is here
[42:55] kindly inspecting you over
[42:59] i'm still reading
[43:01] i used to work for the pennsylvania
[43:02] railroad and we will load a car maybe
[43:05] with cans and so forth and the inspector
[43:07] comes around he would shake everything
[43:09] to see if there was any looseness
[43:12] [Music]
[43:13] the inspector
[43:16] is not the person
[43:19] sorry
[43:21] i am not the inspector
[43:23] the holy ghost is
[43:25] see when you're cussing
[43:27] you see when you're lying
[43:29] you see when you're cheating you see
[43:31] where you're doing on the hunting you
[43:32] see when you're not sincere you see when
[43:34] you're not honest he is seeing them
[43:36] things not me
[43:39] [Applause]
[43:41] but god send a messenger that will tie
[43:43] up the loose ends
[43:45] because christ have to come after the
[43:46] loosers have been tied up
[43:49] and your seal coming after
[43:52] your loose ends
[43:54] tied up
[43:57] that's the way god does this church
[43:59] see what's the matter with it see if
[44:01] there's any looseness in you
[44:04] before he pours the spirit into you and
[44:06] if the church is a little shaky he won't
[44:10] pour
[44:11] his spirit
[44:13] into it
[44:14] if you still love the world i want to do
[44:17] the things of the world you will never
[44:19] get the holy ghost upon that
[44:21] you might get a confusion you might get
[44:24] a stammering lip you might speak with
[44:26] tongues you know you talk about entice
[44:27] inspiration
[44:29] because that ride upon loosens
[44:34] oh you'll get manifestation
[44:36] but no life
[44:39] that is what they have now in preachers
[44:42] with doctors behind the reading bibles
[44:45] with manifestation and absolutely zero
[44:47] life
[44:49] and they're stomping up and down with no
[44:50] fear of god
[44:53] look at them good see if i see anything
[44:54] looking like fear
[44:56] when god said god tremble at the word
[44:59] no
[45:00] fear of god
[45:02] hallelujah they think they're
[45:03] controlling god because they're in that
[45:05] spirit realm
[45:07] hallelujah of demonic activity but god
[45:10] promised a bride
[45:11] that could be so lined up with god
[45:14] watching speaker nerd go echo in him
[45:16] what she buying and they'll go bang in
[45:17] here man watch it loose i'm not gonna be
[45:20] loose in heaven oh glory to god are
[45:22] bride so in tune with god
[45:24] oh hallelujah praise god praise god what
[45:27] you speak god honors
[45:30] what you speak god is pleased with what
[45:32] you're talking about if you abide in me
[45:34] and my words abide in you you can ask
[45:37] whatever you will whatever you will and
[45:40] it shall be done unto you
[45:42] so this will give us great confidence
[45:44] now in the god that we serve and the
[45:46] promise that he made he can't lie oh
[45:49] glory to god the secret is the word is
[45:51] in the bride and he put a divine
[45:53] connection between you as a branch and
[45:55] he has the vine and he's trying to
[45:57] challenge the life to flow from the vine
[45:59] into the branch because through you he
[46:02] gonna produce fruit true and bride the
[46:04] bride will be fulfilled all that was
[46:06] promised so close the lord has shout
[46:09] oh glory to god he must find hands he
[46:11] must find feet he must finish he must
[46:14] find a people in the land
[46:17] another people in the land
[46:19] under their messenger
[46:21] becoming the final voice at the final
[46:23] age
[46:24] oh glory to god god given an opportunity
[46:27] to become the voice of life
[46:31] my lord
[46:33] whoo
[46:34] my lord glory
[46:37] i want to spray and deal with this
[46:38] message i was praying i was thinking
[46:40] about the spirit of truth
[46:42] it's not just truth letter word written
[46:45] but there's a spirit of truth
[46:47] that's why ministers with demon activity
[46:49] behind their life could take scriptures
[46:51] but it's not the spirit of truth at work
[46:53] it's a different spirit at work but they
[46:54] read in scripture
[46:56] hallelujah and they're giving enough
[46:58] gospel to tantalize people taste that it
[47:00] could sparsely smell tests
[47:02] hallelujah it's something about god
[47:03] something about jesus but it can't test
[47:06] that it can't pass the test of the
[47:07] prophetic vision
[47:09] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god do
[47:11] you understand what i'm saying
[47:13] because if you caught this part and this
[47:15] filler that part is filler it's still
[47:16] the word
[47:17] but as you feel a part
[47:19] hallelujah there's a bright part that's
[47:21] only for the bride the prophet preached
[47:23] plenty messages plenty promises plenty
[47:25] information plenty knowledge but the
[47:27] bride have her message inside of there
[47:30] that's why he said alter a true group of
[47:31] the seed of the word god represent
[47:33] christ with a beloved bride there's a
[47:35] group coming out with the true seed
[47:39] of the word
[47:41] because son of man has come forth
[47:43] [Applause]
[47:45] soul of the good seed
[47:48] all right
[47:51] when they expect to come along and shut
[47:53] the thing and the car was good solid he
[47:55] shut the door then he sealed the car
[47:56] when god sees that you're ready so lord
[47:59] for him he fills it with the holy ghost
[48:00] you are sealed by the holy ghost until
[48:02] your destination grieving of the holy
[48:04] spirit of god whereby you are sealed
[48:06] until the day of redemption that's
[48:07] exactly what the scripture said don't

[49:10] as john the baptist
[49:11] our center for around the first coming
[49:13] of the christ
[49:14] you have a message message
[49:16] message
[49:18] that would forerun
[49:20] the second coming of christ
[49:22] so this is from
[49:24] as but isaac said it so beautifully
[49:27] december
[49:29] 1962.
[49:31] so i was amazed i don't know what he was
[49:32] going to preach
[49:33] and where he's coming from last week
[49:35] sunday and when he started i said wow
[49:37] he doesn't know what i'm going to preach
[49:39] but i'm continuing where he left off he
[49:42] said he's not going dear he going have i
[49:44] done enough
[49:45] but the place he said he's not going is
[49:47] where i'm going
[49:51] so
[49:52] what we preach is the word
[49:55] so this is from so this is time as john
[49:58] was sent
[50:00] to wind up the old testament
[50:05] you know sometimes you're driving fast
[50:06] you miss the flowers and you miss these
[50:08] trees and whatnot we're driving slow
[50:10] this morning because we want to soak in
[50:13] everything here we don't want to miss
[50:15] anything here
[50:16] as john was sent
[50:19] to wind up the old testament
[50:22] and to bring forth the introduction of
[50:24] christ
[50:26] a message will wind up the loose ends
[50:31] and will introduce
[50:33] the messiah
[50:35] just before his coming the message of
[50:37] the last days
[50:40] no john didn't just come up bring a
[50:41] message
[50:43] he bring a message and then introduce
[50:46] the messiah
[50:47] and the messiah took over from there
[50:50] well william branham he came with the
[50:52] spirit of elijah
[50:53] and he came not only to bring a message
[50:56] six seals you're gonna get it but here
[50:59] was to introduce christ
[51:01] the seventh
[51:02] seal
[51:04] or
[51:05] introduce luke 17 30
[51:08] even thus shall it be in the day when
[51:10] the son of man is revealed
[51:12] so william branham was malachi for
[51:14] elijah prophet
[51:16] but luke 17 30 is the god prophet
[51:18] himself
[51:20] but it happened that the god prophet was
[51:22] veiled in a prophet
[51:26] it wasn't two different men
[51:28] oh glory to god
[51:30] let's go
[51:31] let's go let's read
[51:33] he said moses
[51:35] david joseph elijah on down through we
[51:38] could take each one of those prophets
[51:39] and bring their lives out and she would
[51:40] express jesus christ perfectly yet
[51:43] never given his secret and full amen
[51:47] waiting for it to be made known in the
[51:49] last days as he promised waiting for it
[51:52] to be fully comprehended before he could
[51:54] express it
[51:56] no the coming of the lord is a mystery
[51:58] we don't know when he is coming
[52:00] how he is coming but we know he is
[52:02] coming and so was all the mysteries of
[52:05] god
[52:07] waiting for this last day
[52:09] after it's already been completed
[52:12] then
[52:13] he reveals and shows what he's done
[52:17] he never gave his mystery in full
[52:19] so it take this last day
[52:21] for a prophet to come at the end aloud
[52:23] this year
[52:24] and he steps at the end of laodicea and
[52:27] show you paul feet
[52:29] arenas martin columba he's showing you
[52:33] know the history
[52:34] what has already been lived
[52:36] that you can see where we are at
[52:39] seeing that all this has already been
[52:40] unfolded so you can't do like a lotus
[52:43] day or yesterday that's finished already
[52:45] that mystery completes already you come
[52:47] into your mystery you're coming to your
[52:49] day you're coming to your message do you
[52:51] see it now
[52:52] just like comparing the seven seals when
[52:55] god used martin luther
[52:57] for the coming out of the first church
[52:59] or that church age and he used john
[53:01] wesley he gradually brought them out and
[53:04] was revealing in them that church age
[53:09] in them
[53:10] they were living out something they
[53:12] didn't know
[53:13] and it was revealing in them
[53:15] that churches notice when the seas break
[53:17] right horse red horse black horse pay
[53:19] horse and an earthquake and everything
[53:21] else right
[53:22] but watch the seas never talk about the
[53:24] messengers
[53:27] because the messengers were hid in the
[53:28] seals
[53:32] don't forget that now this is very
[53:34] important
[53:35] if you read your bible you don't see
[53:36] anything but no paul arenas or any
[53:37] messenger no you seen red horse white
[53:39] horse well what he'd ever doing and what
[53:41] not but behind that what the devil
[53:43] couldn't see
[53:45] unknown to satan
[53:47] god had a messenger he says calling
[53:49] these people come on come on come on
[53:50] come on come on come on come on come on
[53:52] and they only go into the kingdom the
[53:53] king only filling out he calling me
[53:55] elect and dick slamming into the kingdom
[53:57] of god devil can't do nothing about that
[53:59] you only keep in his own but god keeping
[54:01] taking his people out
[54:03] oh glory to god so in the last there's
[54:05] god i need them that messenger to gather
[54:06] the bride together with a special
[54:08] message exclusive bright message oh
[54:11] glory to god hallelujah they're going to
[54:13] give the bride faith they're going to
[54:14] gather the right together oh glory to
[54:16] god to give the right faith for rapture
[54:18] and grace there's only for the bride
[54:20] church members can have whatever they
[54:22] want but the bible have the real message
[54:24] and when you see that message nothing
[54:25] else matter
[54:26] oh glory to god you get locked into that
[54:28] talk give the lord a shout
[54:30] hallelujah
[54:33] oh glory to god so he was revealing in
[54:35] them that church age and we find out but
[54:38] in the last days the reason that was
[54:40] such a tremendous thing he spoke of it
[54:42] here and showed those seven thunders in
[54:45] life magazine and pack a circular cloud
[54:48] yeah my god i'm gonna see it here come
[54:51] luta preach justification okay let's
[54:53] continue here come looter he only put
[54:55] justification he just spawned away in
[54:57] fact for that age he didn't know what
[54:59] age that was
[55:01] here come wesley he punked you is it
[55:03] true a lot of outfalls from it the other
[55:06] church is raising up and here comes
[55:07] pentecost pointing away and they
[55:09] organize right right back and then comes
[55:12] the revelation of the mystery
[55:14] to reveal what it has been all about
[55:18] and all these little doctrines like
[55:20] luther brought out catechism and
[55:22] everything else whereas we brought this
[55:24] remember luther was the one who called
[55:26] them justification right but they were
[55:27] drinking beers
[55:30] and i am saved hallelujah pass me a beer
[55:34] no that can't work when we're sleeping
[55:36] because we're sleeping to add something
[55:38] more
[55:39] to this justified beer drinking bunch
[55:42] he said you can't drink beer and be
[55:43] justified only you have to be cleaned
[55:44] that up
[55:45] you have to be sanctified so you drop
[55:47] another bomb on them to blow that up now
[55:50] all them justified people who want to
[55:51] continue drinking their beer they was
[55:52] out of it they get cut off
[55:54] loose and spirits take them
[55:59] oh glory to god you understand what i'm
[56:01] going on
[56:02] it was okay when luther was preaching
[56:05] justification and certification at it
[56:07] yet
[56:08] your beard drinking was acceptable that
[56:10] time because you're only getting
[56:11] justification by faith
[56:13] but when wesley come you can't continue
[56:15] drinking beer not when the god that said
[56:17] justification is the same god that said
[56:19] sanctification or give the lord a shout
[56:22] therefore justification was the token
[56:24] for that time
[56:25] and when wesley comes justification plus
[56:27] sanctification
[56:29] oh give the lord a show
[56:31] [Applause]
[56:34] [Music]
[56:41] so the pentecostal brought back
[56:42] organization fires and where he goes
[56:44] baptism and so on then come back in the
[56:46] last days and pick up all these
[56:47] mysteries the messenger and and clearly
[56:50] explain it and reveal it why
[56:52] it's all the last days when this great
[56:55] mystery that god has in his heart is
[56:57] being revealed
[56:58] now remember i don't know how much
[57:00] longer i'll be with you remember this is
[57:02] the truth thus yet the lord is the truth
[57:04] like the seven mysteries
[57:06] of the seven last seals
[57:08] the mysteries of them the seals had done
[57:10] been broke and every age had come down
[57:13] and they had been left off a lot of
[57:14] scattering
[57:16] and god not willing that it should be
[57:18] scattered he comes back
[57:20] and pick up those things those doctrines
[57:22] they started and brought it out and
[57:24] revealed the whole thing the same thing
[57:26] he's doing now revealing the mystery of
[57:27] christ
[57:29] so all the little pieces are little
[57:30] doctrines got her to go and pick those
[57:32] things up
[57:33] but all of that is still under six seals
[57:38] so when you see people arguing about
[57:40] filler material
[57:43] and denominate over filler material
[57:46] and teaching fuller material you know is
[57:49] a six seals is a loose end spirit
[57:51] anointing
[57:53] that is dear tying people up saying you
[57:56] have to believe it the way i see it
[57:58] because that is that is what happened
[58:00] you know um um
[58:02] baptize this way do baptize this way
[58:04] believe it so believe it so and if you
[58:06] don't believe it so you're out of it
[58:07] that was two changes
[58:10] that's loose and spirits and those
[58:12] spirits come back in the message
[58:14] still preaching loose ends they're
[58:16] preaching topics doctrines
[58:18] differences and debates they're not
[58:20] preaching a vision because vision is
[58:23] what inspires you to press on
[58:25] a vision is what gives you a wrong
[58:28] target a goal
[58:29] that was a vision i press towards
[58:33] the mark
[58:35] so the vision is what produced a mark i
[58:38] pressed towards the mark of the prize of
[58:40] the high calling in christ jesus
[58:42] oh glory to god without a vision the
[58:44] people perish
[58:45] sitting in church by the thousands this
[58:47] morning but no vision oh glory to god
[58:50] but once you have a vision oh glory to
[58:53] god you could strive
[58:55] oh glory to god if you pass your
[58:57] willingness you still have the vision
[58:59] they sell you to egypt you still have
[59:01] division they put you in prison you
[59:04] still have the vision
[59:05] they forget you in prison you still have
[59:07] the vision
[59:09] but the vision is for an appointed time
[59:11] nobody could change that vision
[59:13] or give the lord a shout in the house
[59:16] until his word came the word of the lord
[59:19] tried him when god gave you a vision you
[59:22] could perceive here when god give you a
[59:24] vision you could press god came and give
[59:26] the bride a vision and purpose it's the
[59:28] prophetic vision it's a vision of the
[59:30] end time it's a vision of the seventh
[59:32] seal and no devil in hell could
[59:35] cancel it change it upset it
[59:38] he doesn't know it
[59:40] because under that seven see the silence
[59:42] [Music]
[59:49] oh you love him tonight
[59:51] now watch
[59:53] there's a lot of truth loss out there
[59:55] where others compromise on truth
[59:57] and this seventh angel don't compromise
[1:00:00] on nothing
[1:00:01] he gathers up all the loose ends
[1:00:06] he gathers up all
[1:00:09] the loose ends
[1:00:10] he has to do that first
[1:00:12] hallelujah at the song then
[1:00:15] all the mystery of god should be
[1:00:16] finished
[1:00:18] what is he quoting revelation 10 7
[1:00:20] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:00:23] angel
[1:00:24] when he shall begin this song the
[1:00:25] mystery of god should be finished
[1:00:27] he's talking about all the rich
[1:00:28] mysteries
[1:00:29] all the loose end mysteries should be
[1:00:32] finished by that time
[1:00:34] and once that mystery is finished then
[1:00:37] we are ready for the mighty angel
[1:00:40] revelation 10 1
[1:00:42] i saw another mighty angel come down
[1:00:45] from heaven because this mighty angel
[1:00:47] coming down he coming down on a platform
[1:00:50] of the word being tied up
[1:00:54] the world already tied up the loose has
[1:00:57] already gathered up the platform is made
[1:00:59] ready for this mighty angel to come down
[1:01:02] oh one foot upon the land one foot upon
[1:01:05] the sea swore by himself time shall be
[1:01:08] no longer time is finished
[1:01:11] oh glory to god the
[1:01:13] the clock the conglom is on
[1:01:15] on time
[1:01:16] hallelujah praise god let's continue
[1:01:18] here
[1:01:19] the book
[1:01:20] that is written within
[1:01:23] is then completed
[1:01:26] when this angel ceases now please
[1:01:28] understand this
[1:01:30] when the seventh angel's message is
[1:01:33] completed
[1:01:34] the godhead mystery
[1:01:37] dissipancy mystery
[1:01:39] all the other mysteries of these things
[1:01:42] they will cast it but you don't like
[1:01:43] machines anymore
[1:01:44] cooperative preaching mysteries this
[1:01:46] morning
[1:01:54] notice here we go
[1:01:56] the book written
[1:01:58] when this angel finishes all these loose
[1:02:00] end mysteries
[1:02:02] that through the battle they thought
[1:02:04] luther fought wesley fought the
[1:02:06] pentacles of what but there was coming
[1:02:07] one in the days of the sounding of these
[1:02:09] mysteries the one is run off in jesus
[1:02:11] name the trinity went on fast and holy
[1:02:13] ghost a nicer concert they were both
[1:02:15] wrong now in the middle of the road in
[1:02:17] the scripture lays out the truth and you
[1:02:19] see where we are at notice
[1:02:21] revelation 5 1 we read the scripture
[1:02:24] i saw on the right hand of him that sat
[1:02:26] upon a throne a book written within
[1:02:29] and the prophet said is here the writing
[1:02:32] was on the inside
[1:02:35] oh we're driving past through
[1:02:38] and on the back side sealed with seven
[1:02:40] seals
[1:02:41] and we found those seven c with seven
[1:02:43] voices
[1:02:44] hallelujah
[1:02:46] that reveals what was inside the book
[1:02:48] but it was sealed with seven seals is
[1:02:50] right
[1:02:51] all right
[1:02:52] now let's continue now there is writing
[1:02:54] on the inside of the book but on the
[1:02:57] back side had seven c's on the back of
[1:02:59] it that wasn't written in the book this
[1:03:02] is the revelator talking john now
[1:03:04] remember it wasn't written in the book
[1:03:06] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:03:10] angel
[1:03:11] all this misuse written within
[1:03:14] should be finished it should be taken
[1:03:16] care of
[1:03:18] then is the time
[1:03:20] for the seven voices
[1:03:23] of revelation 10 to be revealed
[1:03:26] when
[1:03:27] the book is finished
[1:03:29] there's only one thing left and that is
[1:03:31] the seven mysterious voices of thunder
[1:03:34] that was wrote on the back side of the
[1:03:36] book
[1:03:37] that john was forbidden to write
[1:03:39] it's on the back side when the book is
[1:03:42] completed so when you spend the patience
[1:03:44] the book is completed voices on the back
[1:03:46] side
[1:03:47] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[1:03:49] don't write it john saw the same thing
[1:03:52] and watch daniel saw it john saw it it
[1:03:54] has already been written
[1:03:56] outside of the bible they had seven seas
[1:03:58] on the back of the book no michael
[1:03:59] opened those seas but that was them
[1:04:01] voices
[1:04:03] so brother branham identified the seals
[1:04:05] on the back of the book as
[1:04:07] them voices
[1:04:09] seven thunders
[1:04:11] seven voices
[1:04:12] seven thunders is them voices
[1:04:15] back there he said but on the back side
[1:04:17] of the bible the revelations are shown
[1:04:19] to daniel say that there is seven voices
[1:04:21] to be uttered that no man can open no
[1:04:24] man know what it was but the bible said
[1:04:26] it told daniel and also john in the last
[1:04:29] days these seven voices would be known
[1:04:32] by the real true church
[1:04:35] you get it
[1:04:36] can you see where the false and
[1:04:38] counterfeit is trying to their best to
[1:04:40] keep great men
[1:04:41] from places like that
[1:04:44] hallelujah
[1:04:45] so when i begin this song
[1:04:47] the mystery will be finished note
[1:04:50] then it's time for the seven sea voices
[1:04:53] of revelation 10 to be revealed
[1:04:55] do you understand
[1:04:57] when all the mysteries of the book has
[1:05:00] completed and the bible said here he
[1:05:02] would finish the mysteries
[1:05:04] and the seven thunders right here in the
[1:05:06] revelation here of jesus christ is some
[1:05:08] mystery
[1:05:09] does not the bible said that the
[1:05:10] revelation of jesus christ the
[1:05:12] conversation said amen he said why
[1:05:14] there's some hidden mystery in of it
[1:05:17] you say what is it the seventh unders
[1:05:18] have it
[1:05:19] for john was told was just about to
[1:05:21] write and a voice came from heaven
[1:05:23] saying don't write it but seal it seals
[1:05:25] up put it on the back side of the book
[1:05:27] it's got to be revealed it's the
[1:05:29] mysteries
[1:05:31] now is it plain
[1:05:33] when the first scene was opened the
[1:05:34] seals that was on the inside of the book
[1:05:36] these mysteries are strongly for
[1:05:38] justification signification he's
[1:05:39] identifying them roman catholic church
[1:05:41] protestants all these little battles and
[1:05:43] things left these loose ends in the word
[1:05:45] of god the seventh angel comes on
[1:05:48] gathers them all and explaining explains
[1:05:52] them then he finishes
[1:05:54] then seven thunders
[1:05:56] utters out
[1:05:58] then he went on to say this
[1:06:01] if the ministry of the mysteries of god
[1:06:03] is finished
[1:06:05] what if that is them seven mysteries
[1:06:06] coming forward
[1:06:08] you know what he said if all these new
[1:06:09] sins is tied up what if it is those
[1:06:11] seven thunders
[1:06:13] coming forth
[1:06:14] hallelujah and a humble little church
[1:06:16] like ours that almighty has come and
[1:06:19] regarded the lowest state of his people
[1:06:21] what i don't think so it might not be
[1:06:23] but what if it is then time has run out
[1:06:26] be serious it is later than we think
[1:06:29] oh praise the name of the lord
[1:06:31] hallelujah now listen
[1:06:33] the angel come down from heaven
[1:06:37] the other seven angels of the seven
[1:06:39] churches was earthly messengers
[1:06:42] but this angel
[1:06:45] version 10 1.
[1:06:46] all the messages finished
[1:06:49] the seven angels wind halting but this
[1:06:52] angel come down not of the earth
[1:06:54] he isn't a man from the earth
[1:06:57] as the messengers of the church ages
[1:06:59] that is finished but this angel brings
[1:07:01] the next announcement
[1:07:03] so after the seals are tied up after the
[1:07:06] loosens are tied up you have a next
[1:07:08] announcement
[1:07:12] and you know it had men human beings
[1:07:14] thought that they were that angel
[1:07:17] and the prophet came to introduce them
[1:07:21] loose end spirits just take them just
[1:07:23] like that and give them revelations and
[1:07:24] stuff and they think that they were the
[1:07:26] ones that were supposed to come

[1:07:40] pillar of light cloud a rainbow over his
[1:07:42] head rainbow is a covenant with christ
[1:07:44] with one foot upon the land where are we
[1:07:46] at science what is this about i'm asking
[1:07:48] you the other angel was messengers men
[1:07:50] of the earth but this one didn't come
[1:07:51] from the earth he come down from heaven
[1:07:53] because the mystery is all finished
[1:07:55] when the mystery is finished he just
[1:07:56] said time shall be no more what if
[1:07:58] there's something to let us know how to
[1:08:00] enter the rapture in faith
[1:08:02] is it
[1:08:03] will we run a leap over walls
[1:08:05] is there something fixing to happen that
[1:08:08] these old mad bodies are going to be
[1:08:10] changed no we have to believe that you
[1:08:11] know
[1:08:12] we can't just looking to get old and
[1:08:14] dead you know
[1:08:17] that is not that's not the promise
[1:08:19] you're getting old but you're looking
[1:08:20] for the promise to be changed
[1:08:23] you have to be on the expectation for
[1:08:24] that and if you're looking to be changed
[1:08:26] you'll give a rapture and fear to be
[1:08:27] changed because you have to have fear to
[1:08:29] be changed in a moment it'll become you
[1:08:31] have to have faith for that for you
[1:08:33] let me sting you a little bit
[1:08:35] you know that church thing you know

[1:09:05] has changed in you you know that the
[1:09:07] power that's in you could change outside
[1:09:10] you or give the lord a shout jesus
[1:09:13] himself said destroy this body in three
[1:09:15] days i will raise it up myself
[1:09:18] because he understood the revelation of
[1:09:20] mechanics and dynamics
[1:09:21] and he had resident dynamics in his
[1:09:24] mechanics
[1:09:27] [Applause]
[1:09:31] don't get trouble with that you know

[1:11:31] you don't know what kind of whitey man
[1:11:32] had
[1:11:33] but he was pleasing god
[1:11:35] fell an old friend
[1:11:37] whether i maintain my family enoch was
[1:11:40] maintained in christ and his mechanics
[1:11:42] became dynamics by the spirit
[1:11:46] let me say it again his mechanics became
[1:11:49] dynamics by the spirit and god took him
[1:11:53] and sit down say oh god when sitting
[1:11:54] looking for you not gone
[1:11:57] as a sign
[1:11:58] as i say
[1:12:00] that we will be gone
[1:12:02] [Laughter]
[1:12:04] all glory to god god take enoch and use
[1:12:06] him as a sign that we will be gone
[1:12:09] and he was his seventh from adam
[1:12:11] who killed the lord
[1:12:14] hallelujah
[1:12:16] he said can i lift the seer o lord
[1:12:18] is it so close that i'll see it
[1:12:21] is this degeneration so is my brethren
[1:12:23] what time is it where are we at it might
[1:12:26] be crucial and we think
[1:12:28] it has got me scared and this last week
[1:12:30] message oh i haven't done enough
[1:12:33] where are we at
[1:12:35] time shall be no more he announces the
[1:12:37] time's over
[1:12:39] what happens what happens could that be
[1:12:40] so no brethren seriously think if it is
[1:12:43] then the pyramid is capped by the seven
[1:12:46] thunders
[1:12:47] so he put the voices the seals on the
[1:12:49] back of the book as the cap of the
[1:12:50] pyramid
[1:12:52] hallelujah
[1:12:54] the back of the book the tongue is
[1:12:57] become the capstone
[1:12:59] that's our message
[1:13:01] that's where we are that's the doctrine
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:07] listen it had scribes they had a
[1:13:09] doctrine it had pharisees they had the
[1:13:11] doctrine they had
[1:13:13] sadducees and they were sad you see they
[1:13:15] had adoption too all of them had the
[1:13:17] doctrines but john didn't come to
[1:13:18] introduce another doctrine
[1:13:21] give the lord a shout on that
[1:13:23] john didn't come to have rejection
[1:13:25] according to john he come to introduce
[1:13:27] christ behold the lamb of god
[1:13:30] hallelujah
[1:13:31] not another teaching or doctrine christ
[1:13:34] and christ point them to the cross
[1:13:41] and then they struck the upper room
[1:13:43] where they were filled with the holy
[1:13:44] ghost
[1:13:46] of god
[1:13:48] then he said do you remember the proven
[1:13:50] message
[1:13:51] it's the capstone
[1:13:53] what did it do
[1:13:55] the holy spirit
[1:13:57] capped off the individual so we're not
[1:13:59] talking about church israel
[1:14:00] we're talking about the individual let's
[1:14:02] drive by and slow
[1:14:04] capped off the individual

[1:14:12] godliness

[1:19:27] [Applause]
[1:19:29] you
[1:19:30] you can't beat somebody hungry and
[1:19:31] tasting after god
[1:19:33] hannah was barren and hannah was crying
[1:19:35] another altar
[1:19:37] it's a plenty grace to do that you know
[1:19:39] because yeah one people know your
[1:19:40] condition
[1:19:41] but hannah didn't care she passed a
[1:19:43] certain barrier already
[1:19:45] other people tease and she and terrorize
[1:19:46] and she enters you all kind of thing
[1:19:48] i for her to begin to cry out
[1:19:50] she's had a grumble and mumble even in
[1:19:53] the pre-stall she'll take a little thing
[1:19:54] before she came by the altar
[1:19:56] thought she was all drunk
[1:19:58] hallelujah hannah was not drunk
[1:20:00] she was groaning in the spirit because
[1:20:02] she was desperate and when you get
[1:20:04] desperate you begin to groan because
[1:20:06] something you need a breakthrough you
[1:20:08] need a touch you need heaven to come
[1:20:09] down
[1:20:16] message too comfortable
[1:20:18] yeah the message is too easy
[1:20:21] so god said lock them down
[1:20:23] lock them down
[1:20:25] always say they have faith all you see
[1:20:26] there's this i know preachers who was
[1:20:28] pre-claiming to be god man and and all
[1:20:30] kind of powers and whatnot this corner
[1:20:32] virus the only man alone they leave the
[1:20:33] god part out
[1:20:36] they're fighting
[1:20:38] no more god money no
[1:20:40] no
[1:20:41] i can't
[1:20:42] i'm ordinary man yes i'm going outside
[1:20:46] all the godman all the powers they claim
[1:20:47] to have all the great gifts they claim
[1:20:49] to have while they get power and they
[1:20:51] are churches back in the day
[1:20:52] and once the people back in them up
[1:20:54] that's it
[1:20:55] i said they float up in space
[1:20:57] you see years ago early in my ministry
[1:20:59] very early god taught me and showed me
[1:21:01] that adoption is not based upon the
[1:21:02] people
[1:21:04] so i was never persuaded for the by the
[1:21:06] people
[1:21:07] i know adoption is father and son
[1:21:09] business
[1:21:10] because many men get deceived by the
[1:21:12] people that they preach too
[1:21:15] let's say it again they get deceived by
[1:21:17] the very people that they preach to
[1:21:19] because the people love them and hey
[1:21:23] and afterwards they do all kind of crazy
[1:21:25] stuff
[1:21:25] because they love the people and people
[1:21:27] love them and they're the man of god and
[1:21:28] man in the all right
[1:21:32] but when you understand that this
[1:21:34] adoption as i said it last week or a
[1:21:36] week before sometime was preaching
[1:21:38] nowhere adoption is based upon the man
[1:21:41] sermon message or teaching doctrine
[1:21:43] think about it think about it mighty
[1:21:45] messages share our messages firewall
[1:21:47] messages quality messages message they
[1:21:49] can dispute but they're not adoption
[1:21:52] i talk
[1:21:55] adoption have to do with behavior
[1:22:05] a wife could cook
[1:22:06] wash clean
[1:22:08] and still do love she has bananas
[1:22:11] and don't do it in any spirit and
[1:22:12] quality it was just banana she's doing
[1:22:14] duty
[1:22:18] you think god wants a bride that you're
[1:22:19] in duty
[1:22:21] she has a conversation
[1:22:22] all right take it or leave it
[1:22:25] he's not leaving it
[1:22:27] you're on your own
[1:22:28] he said he wants a brother but love him
[1:22:33] so it's not what you do
[1:22:35] is the spirit and how you do it
[1:22:39] [Applause]
[1:22:44] that's why paul bust him with the gifts
[1:22:46] he said do i speak with tons of men and
[1:22:48] angels do i have give my body to be
[1:22:50] burned do i have all knowledge do i know
[1:22:52] all mysteries i don't have this spirit
[1:22:54] called love charity the prize absolute
[1:22:57] you're the child of the chinese ticket
[1:22:59] the rainbow the cloud the glory the
[1:23:01] amber light whatever you want to call it
[1:23:03] if i don't have that i am not nothing
[1:23:06] zero not a waste of time
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:14] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:23:23] look look look israel in egypt right
[1:23:25] okay
[1:23:26] egypt moses come to deliver them so god
[1:23:28] dropped fate upon moses to speak deliver
[1:23:31] them they come out now they're happy to
[1:23:32] rejoice in

[1:29:42] it minor willingness
[1:29:44] what what what are they claiming
[1:29:45] generational blessings generational
[1:29:47] inheritance is our people oh fathers eat
[1:29:50] man and willingness and

[1:29:57] dead already

[1:30:03] i come that you might have light you
[1:30:05] turn me down you in darkness
[1:30:07] they can't come to bring light because
[1:30:09] you are on the loose ends all along i
[1:30:11] came in the light of my father's word
[1:30:14] and i'm manifesting my father's word
[1:30:17] i come that you might have life and have
[1:30:19] it more abundantly not the texts have
[1:30:21] life in him have life
[1:30:23] oh give the lord i shout
[1:30:25] oh glory to god you have to bring the
[1:30:27] disciples to him you have to come to him
[1:30:29] you have to come into his presence
[1:30:36] do you remember the premium message
[1:30:38] is the capstone what did it do the holy
[1:30:40] spirit capped off the individual and
[1:30:42] sealed it
[1:30:43] i don't hear ministers talking about
[1:30:44] that capped off the individual and
[1:30:46] sealed it man claiming to be adopted and
[1:30:48] organizing there's no signs no wonders
[1:30:50] they can't even hear a two take a
[1:30:51] headache
[1:30:53] and they're adopted
[1:30:55] i wonder how much of them challenging
[1:30:56] coronavirus right now
[1:30:59] okay
[1:31:01] they could make all the big boats
[1:31:03] when it's not running through the land
[1:31:05] when they run and shoot the land
[1:31:06] what are you going to pull people and
[1:31:07] say
[1:31:08] you see what i'm talking about now
[1:31:10] right
[1:31:12] you add righteousness and godliness you
[1:31:14] kept adding till we got seven things
[1:31:17] and the seventh one was love which is
[1:31:18] god and that's how he makes the
[1:31:20] individual and caps him and seize him
[1:31:23] with the holy spirit that is how he
[1:31:25] makes
[1:31:27] makes
[1:31:29] the individual
[1:31:30] this is not joining church i want you to
[1:31:33] see the message
[1:31:34] see what the prophet came to point us to
[1:31:37] not church
[1:31:39] but the distortion of a perfect man
[1:31:42] that these things could live in you
[1:31:48] and every time them virtues add into you
[1:31:50] did they ever have less room inside of
[1:31:51] you less room to use they assumed to
[1:31:53] influence you
[1:31:55] until one day you're full up
[1:31:57] when you see me
[1:32:00] you see my father
[1:32:01] when you see me you watch any word but
[1:32:03] what working in me is the spirit
[1:32:05] or give the lord a shout
[1:32:10] and that's not too hard to believe
[1:32:12] because in john 14 20 said that in that
[1:32:14] day you shall know
[1:32:16] i am in the father you and me and i and
[1:32:17] you
[1:32:19] all glory to god we are just flesh and
[1:32:20] blood we have a spirit we have a soul
[1:32:26] hallelujah
[1:32:28] when jesus died that ghost of jesus is
[1:32:31] the holy ghost he released his spirit
[1:32:34] throughout all the earth that's how you
[1:32:35] were found you were not found by a text
[1:32:37] the spirit called you no man could come
[1:32:39] except my father draw him the lord is
[1:32:42] that spirit oh give the lord a shout it
[1:32:44] was not text that called you it was the
[1:32:46] spirit that called you
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:49] let me say it again it was not text that
[1:32:51] called you
[1:32:53] it was the spirit that called you
[1:32:55] and the spirit i call you bring it to
[1:32:57] the text
[1:32:58] that you can be washed by the washing of
[1:33:00] the water of the word
[1:33:01] and through the text you could connect
[1:33:03] back to the spirit
[1:33:05] [Applause]
[1:33:11] then if he caps and seals then if that
[1:33:13] be so he has got seven two changes the
[1:33:16] individual has that he's that seven
[1:33:18] mysteries have been sung that away and
[1:33:19] they fought for to bring back and now
[1:33:21] the headstone comes the cap of the
[1:33:22] church does
[1:33:24] the ton doesn't mean that my brethren
[1:33:26] so this is that where we are at
[1:33:28] could it be that the mighty thunder or
[1:33:30] the seven angel in the seventh
[1:33:32] consolation seventh period constellation
[1:33:34] their pyramid in a form tree on our side
[1:33:36] one on top and the drop from eternity
[1:33:38] could it be is this the mystery of the
[1:33:41] thunders not return this now
[1:33:43] the mystery of it now
[1:33:45] that will bring back the headstone
[1:33:47] you know the pyramids never kept the
[1:33:49] headstone is yet to come
[1:33:51] so the mission of the thunders pulls
[1:33:53] down the capsule
[1:33:54] pulls down the headstone pulls down a
[1:33:56] power they're going to take the bride
[1:33:58] out of here he's talking about you're
[1:34:00] seeing the dead being raised up that
[1:34:01] ought to give you a fear to be changed
[1:34:04] that's why i know they must have signs
[1:34:06] and wonders it can't be talking talking
[1:34:09] explaining revealing mystery talking it
[1:34:11] can't be that it has to be a little more
[1:34:13] than that
[1:34:14] it has to be a power emanating in the
[1:34:16] church
[1:34:19] [Applause]
[1:34:21] why should god send power on man with no
[1:34:24] life
[1:34:26] or let's say no character
[1:34:31] the least the age gone by had that
[1:34:34] the pentecostals still have power
[1:34:36] still released
[1:34:38] they're losing you know
[1:34:39] they're lying marrying four or five
[1:34:41] times they're doing whatever they want
[1:34:42] to still doing disgust no devils and
[1:34:44] healing and whatnot it's a power
[1:34:47] yeah
[1:34:48] that paul connect with loose ends
[1:34:50] but this power we're talking about is
[1:34:52] where the angel come down
[1:34:53] and introduce the age of adoption
[1:34:56] and this age of adoption is the age of
[1:34:57] personal life
[1:34:59] you see all the other ages was church
[1:35:00] life
[1:35:01] but it's the age of personal life where
[1:35:03] you get them singled out
[1:35:05] so you can hide in the group
[1:35:08] you can't hide with your behavior you
[1:35:10] can't play a church here and religious
[1:35:11] here and like a devil in your house
[1:35:13] that can't work
[1:35:14] you have to tie up that loose end
[1:35:16] there's a loose end and a demon will
[1:35:18] drop down behind you an enticing spirit
[1:35:20] will drop down behind you and terrorize
[1:35:22] your life
[1:35:23] because you have to tie up the looseness
[1:35:25] in your life
[1:35:26] as pastor of this church i can't tithe
[1:35:28] up for you
[1:35:29] oh glory to god you have got to tie up
[1:35:31] your loose ends
[1:35:33] [Applause]

[1:36:40] that will be the other part of this
[1:36:42] message
[1:36:43] he have to appear
[1:36:45] among the bride
[1:36:47] all right let's continue now
[1:36:50] you say is this the mission of the
[1:36:51] thunders
[1:36:52] that would bring back the headstone you
[1:36:54] know the prayer was never capped the
[1:36:56] head soon has yet to come it's been

[1:37:44] the spirit
[1:37:46] and that fire that come down become
[1:37:48] resident inside of them he don't

[1:43:14] our hearts have been warm many times in
[1:43:16] the times that we have seen you do and
[1:43:19] unfold your mysteries to us
[1:43:21] but lord tonight i'm all wary
[1:43:24] woe is me
[1:43:26] and jacob when he saw those angels
[1:43:27] coming down the ladder and going back he
[1:43:29] said this is a dreadful place
[1:43:32] none other than the house of god
[1:43:34] and their battle was established
[1:43:36] god
[1:43:37] people don't understand that
[1:43:39] they think it would be so much joy but
[1:43:41] lord what a wary
[1:43:43] what a dreadful thing for a human being
[1:43:45] to come into the presence of a great
[1:43:48] mighty being
[1:43:49] of heaven
[1:43:51] i pray for forgiveness of my little

[1:44:20] life is over receive us into thy kingdom
[1:44:22] for we ask in jesus name
[1:44:25] amen

[1:44:39] there is nothing to be scared about
[1:44:42] if jesus is coming it's the moment the
[1:44:44] whole world has grown and cried for
[1:44:46] if it is something breaking fought now
[1:44:48] for a new coming a new comment of a new
[1:44:50] gift or something it will be wonderful
[1:44:52] if it's come in time for the revelation
[1:44:53] of the seven thunders to be revealed to
[1:44:55] the church how to go i don't know
[1:44:57] i just stated what i saw
[1:44:59] what a time
[1:45:00] it is serious
[1:45:02] solid thinking
[1:45:04] praise god you love him tonight
[1:45:07] you enjoying the word
[1:45:08] are you being edified this this today
[1:45:12] all right let's continue
[1:45:14] watch in the days of the voice of the
[1:45:16] seven angel when he begin to song
[1:45:19] the mystery of god should be finished as
[1:45:21] he had declared to his siblings the
[1:45:22] prophets he read the scripture now see
[1:45:24] the mystery of this seven sealed book
[1:45:26] will be revealed
[1:45:28] at the songing of the seven to each
[1:45:30] message
[1:45:31] the seven angels begin to song and there
[1:45:34] is a message wrote out there
[1:45:37] because it's unt and book form now
[1:45:39] at the beginning of the song of the
[1:45:41] message
[1:45:43] the mystery of god should be finished
[1:45:45] see at that time
[1:45:46] now we notice the book
[1:45:49] the mystery of god
[1:45:50] is not revealed until the seven angel
[1:45:53] messages sounded right now these points
[1:45:56] are important in the seals
[1:45:58] because it's tied together
[1:46:00] now it's wrote mysterious because no man
[1:46:02] nowhere god alone jesus is a mysterious
[1:46:06] book it's a book of redemption now we
[1:46:08] know here we go that this book of
[1:46:10] redemption will not be totally
[1:46:12] understood it is probe that through six
[1:46:14] church ages but at the end when the
[1:46:17] seventh angel begins the song is mystery
[1:46:20] he winds up all the loose ends
[1:46:22] that these fellows probed at
[1:46:25] and the mysteries come down from god
[1:46:29] as the word of god
[1:46:31] and reveals the entire revelation of god
[1:46:34] then the godhead and everything else is
[1:46:37] settled all the mysteries sip and see so
[1:46:40] in other words
[1:46:41] all the little loose doctrinal teachings
[1:46:44] will be sorted out by this seventh angel
[1:46:47] messenger
[1:46:49] are you with me
[1:46:50] all right here we go
[1:46:53] okay so at the song of the seventh
[1:46:54] church is
[1:46:56] the last church age
[1:46:57] all the loose ends that's true these
[1:47:00] church ages has been probed at will be
[1:47:02] wound up together
[1:47:03] and when the seals are broke and the
[1:47:05] mystery revealed down comes the angel
[1:47:09] the messenger
[1:47:10] christ
[1:47:12] setting his foot upon the land upon the
[1:47:14] sea
[1:47:14] with a rainbow over his head now here
[1:47:17] the part now remember
[1:47:19] this seventh angel
[1:47:21] is on earth
[1:47:23] at the time of this coming
[1:47:26] amen
[1:47:27] so this mighty angel version 10 1
[1:47:30] mix
[1:47:31] version 10
[1:47:32] 7.
[1:47:35] because version 10 7 is the messenger of
[1:47:37] this age
[1:47:38] russian 10 1 is christ the mighty angel
[1:47:41] coming down
[1:47:42] after all the mysteries written has been
[1:47:45] unfolded
[1:47:46] now as john was given his message
[1:47:49] the same time the messiah come in his
[1:47:51] day
[1:47:52] john knew he would see him because he
[1:47:54] was going to introduce him
[1:47:56] we realize in the scripture over malachi
[1:47:59] there is to be one like john and elijah
[1:48:01] to whom the word of god can come to and
[1:48:03] he is revealed by the holy spirit all
[1:48:06] the mysteries of god and restore the
[1:48:09] faith of the children back to the faith
[1:48:11] of the fathers
[1:48:12] he didn't say some man have to come
[1:48:14] after him to reveal mysteries
[1:48:16] this elijah prophet will reveal all
[1:48:19] the mysteries of god and turn our hearts
[1:48:21] back to the fate
[1:48:23] of the fathers to the fate of the
[1:48:25] apostle fathers we stood back all the
[1:48:27] mysteries that has been proved that
[1:48:29] now we see this seven seed book now is
[1:48:31] the mystery of redemption
[1:48:33] it's a book of redemption and all the
[1:48:35] mysteries at this time should be
[1:48:37] finished at the songing of this
[1:48:38] messenger
[1:48:40] and here is the angel on earth and
[1:48:42] another angel mighty messenger come down
[1:48:45] see this is an earthly angel but here
[1:48:47] come christ
[1:48:49] isn't that right
[1:48:50] this seven seal book let's continue it
[1:48:53] was closed here in version the fifth
[1:48:55] chapter and in revelation 10 it is open
[1:48:58] hallelujah
[1:49:00] and great signs in the heavens angels
[1:49:02] coming in the constellation scientists
[1:49:04] looking at it and there in a magazine
[1:49:06] told months before it happened
[1:49:08] seven angels come down and said the
[1:49:09] complete
[1:49:10] revelation of the sexy mystery of god
[1:49:14] should be unfolded
[1:49:15] so this is the prophet now explaining
[1:49:17] that all this mysteries is under
[1:49:20] six seals
[1:49:21] he called it the complete revelation
[1:49:24] of the six seals mystery would be
[1:49:26] unfolded
[1:49:27] and then he said now watch never before
[1:49:30] since the early church age did it ever
[1:49:31] see the things we are seeing today and
[1:49:34] this was only made possible when god
[1:49:36] sent us seven seals and gave us a sign
[1:49:38] by it and sent seven angels down out of
[1:49:40] heaven to come to bring back the
[1:49:42] scattered word in them denomination
[1:49:45] and tie it back down into the word again
[1:49:47] to bring down the holy spirit
[1:49:49] so it's more than just loose ends it's
[1:49:51] to gather the word to tie back into the
[1:49:53] word that he'll bring a channel to
[1:49:56] release
[1:49:57] the holy spirit
[1:49:59] okay i think we're in the home stretch
[1:50:01] now
[1:50:03] you believe we are living in the last
[1:50:04] days
[1:50:05] when the son of man was to be manifested
[1:50:08] so now he he's going in detail what son
[1:50:10] of man is
[1:50:12] he said that would be
[1:50:14] all the word
[1:50:15] that's been gathered up
[1:50:17] through luther wesley baptist all of
[1:50:20] that and the pentecostals
[1:50:23] all guided up to a revelation of what it
[1:50:25] had been
[1:50:27] are you ready
[1:50:28] the seventh angel was to open the six
[1:50:32] seal mystery
[1:50:37] it is all to be gathered up in the son
[1:50:39] of man
[1:50:41] who is that
[1:50:42] christ
[1:50:44] the seventh
[1:50:45] seal
[1:50:47] but the seventh earthly messenger could
[1:50:49] only open
[1:50:51] six seals
[1:50:52] because christ is the
[1:50:54] seventh
[1:50:56] seal do you understand that
[1:50:57] let me read it again think about this
[1:51:01] do you believe we are living in the last
[1:51:02] days when the son of man was to be
[1:51:04] manifested
[1:51:05] manifested
[1:51:07] that would be all the word
[1:51:09] that's gathered up
[1:51:11] through luther
[1:51:12] wesley
[1:51:14] baptist all of that
[1:51:15] and the pentecostal all gathered up to
[1:51:18] the revelation of what has been
[1:51:20] the seven angel
[1:51:22] was to open the sexy mystery
[1:51:25] it is
[1:51:26] to be guarded up
[1:51:28] into the son of man
[1:51:30] his fullness of time
[1:51:33] has come to the fullness of his word
[1:51:36] to manifest
[1:51:38] the fullness of his body
[1:51:40] that's the word then
[1:51:42] the spoken word made manifest by the
[1:51:45] word reveal the word
[1:51:47] so this 16 mysteries was gathered up

[2:01:36] [Applause]
[2:01:36] [Music]
[2:01:40] we are not confused
[2:01:42] and this person here he ain't confused
[2:01:43] at all
[2:01:46] let the main thing
[2:01:48] let the main thing let the main thing
[2:01:52] you have no time with fellow material
[2:01:53] right now we're too late for that
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:56] [Applause]
[2:01:58] [Music]
[2:02:00] [Applause]
[2:02:02] you go to our wedding there's something
[2:02:03] called orders
[2:02:05] french wood
[2:02:06] nice little peanut butter inside of the
[2:02:08] prunes
[2:02:10] a peanut butter biscuit
[2:02:12] the only thing with the sticks and it's
[2:02:14] you can eat alone because you're waiting
[2:02:16] for them to get over their business to
[2:02:17] bring all the food
[2:02:18] right
[2:02:20] now if you're bypassing orders yeah miss
[2:02:22] nothing else
[2:02:24] the
[2:02:24] ghost men you come in
[2:02:26] [Music]
[2:02:28] now sometimes i don't think i'll trick
[2:02:29] they overdo it for the orders
[2:02:32] i don't know they want to small you find
[2:02:33] the food that you want to get afterwards
[2:02:34] they give packets with i said that's a
[2:02:36] cake and little thing and that i think i
[2:02:38] don't think somebody can either dig it
[2:02:40] like a big hole
[2:02:44] so sometimes i leave all the things
[2:02:45] aside
[2:02:46] because i want the main thing
[2:02:51] no you're going to eat both you know you
[2:02:52] can have both don't don't follow me
[2:02:55] they just when we talk more
[2:02:58] but you have to let the main thing
[2:03:00] to be the main thing
[2:03:02] in other words you polish the car
[2:03:05] you rub it down
[2:03:06] you spray paint it
[2:03:08] but it can't cast that
[2:03:10] and you're bringing people to invite
[2:03:12] them to see how good
[2:03:13] the furniture inside you guys
[2:03:15] are you're just you're a pool seeker
[2:03:17] and when you say come for a spin
[2:03:19] you say what do you spend around it
[2:03:20] right now you're going to walk around
[2:03:23] with the car car start
[2:03:24] the car
[2:03:26] you have new tires on it but it's not
[2:03:28] going anywhere
[2:03:29] you have new rooms those rooms are
[2:03:31] extensive they were imported
[2:03:33] nobody doesn't train and have rooms like
[2:03:34] your rooms but the car can't stop
[2:03:37] the main thing is not any meeting there
[2:03:39] you are a joker
[2:03:41] because a car is supposed to just be on
[2:03:43] display a car supposed to move from
[2:03:45] point a to point b
[2:03:46] and if it's time moving point to point b
[2:03:48] you are a joker so the main thing is to
[2:03:51] find out how to get it started
[2:03:53] i want to tumble the engine you could
[2:03:55] have anything you want behind
[2:03:56] it could move
[2:03:58] so listen to this i love what about

[2:04:04] knowledge for this child to study
[2:04:06] but the whole syllabus not coming for
[2:04:08] exams
[2:04:09] so they give you a channel to approach
[2:04:11] what is coming for exams you have to

[2:04:15] you want in the past years i miss the
[2:04:17] botany you have to make the rapture you
[2:04:20] don't want to be with them drunk
[2:04:21] tribulation saints and they don't want
[2:04:23] with him because i'm never going to be
[2:04:25] drinking when they recognize they miss
[2:04:26] the boat

[2:05:15] wife
[2:05:33] something wrong
[2:05:34] your life off-key
[2:05:36] you're planting loose ends
[2:05:38] and you have to tie them up yet
[2:05:40] you must be in a position where anything
[2:05:41] somebody call it a prayer you could pray
[2:05:47] midnight 2 a.m 1 a.m it doesn't matter
[2:05:49] when hey somebody go pray for me you say

[2:06:00] what it means your heart is right your
[2:06:03] heart is in tune the holy spirit could
[2:06:05] avail himself to your heart
[2:06:07] because your heart is unfeelable that
[2:06:09] the spirit could speak and work through
[2:06:11] you
[2:06:12] by and through the bride will you
[2:06:14] fulfill all that was prophesied
[2:06:16] nobody else buy into the bride
[2:06:19] so you have to have your height
[2:06:20] mechanics which is making things right
[2:06:22] getting your heart right that is the
[2:06:23] right mechanic
[2:06:25] not coming to church
[2:06:27] i want to get in that sometime
[2:06:29] oh my god so at the end you received the
[2:06:31] whole secret of god tap the loose ends
[2:06:33] and reveal those shield of god represent
[2:06:35] this government fought several
[2:06:37] mysterious thunders that are not written
[2:06:38] on all and i believe that true those
[2:06:40] seven thunders will be revealed in those
[2:06:41] days in order to get the bride up and
[2:06:43] feed because what we have right now we
[2:06:45] could hardly uh we have got a step
[2:06:47] further you see we have got to step
[2:06:50] further
[2:06:51] we can't
[2:06:52] have enough faith
[2:06:54] for divine healing hardly
[2:06:58] this is that i trying to push down on
[2:07:00] somebody or talk somebody down you know
[2:07:01] this is the prophet saying we hardly
[2:07:04] have enough faith for divine healing
[2:07:05] hardly we have got to have enough faith
[2:07:09] to be changed
[2:07:11] so you're saying the faith to be changed
[2:07:13] is more than divine healing
[2:07:15] so we have to get divine healing plus
[2:07:17] [Music]
[2:07:19] that's why we had to go back to the
[2:07:20] faith of the fathers plus
[2:07:22] [Applause]
[2:07:24] we gotta go in the raptor without going
[2:07:26] back and forth in fathers you know the
[2:07:28] theater the fathers had signs wonders
[2:07:29] and miracles
[2:07:33] the faith of the fathers had paul a
[2:07:35] snake bite him and he shake it off and
[2:07:37] the people take the time and watch
[2:07:38] interference are there because there's a
[2:07:39] 10 second snake
[2:07:41] 10 seconds you're dead it's a highly
[2:07:43] poisonous stick and i see so paul living
[2:07:45] normal normal they say he's of god
[2:07:48] because the holy ghost running through
[2:07:49] them
[2:07:50] so he have the antidote
[2:07:53] on the inside
[2:07:56] he is virus protected
[2:07:58] snake bite protected
[2:08:00] drunk proof protected
[2:08:02] stoned protected
[2:08:05] he is just protected
[2:08:08] [Applause]
[2:08:10] that is dynamics
[2:08:12] that is original dynamics
[2:08:15] oh glory to god no weapon form against
[2:08:17] you
[2:08:18] oh god they shall even drink deadly
[2:08:21] thing and it shall not harm them
[2:08:23] if you drink poison by mistake
[2:08:26] it can harm you
[2:08:27] oh glory to god after you reckon it is
[2:08:29] poisonous but normal
[2:08:31] because what you are protected
[2:08:35] all your bloodstream charged
[2:08:38] with holy ghost life
[2:08:40] flowing through your members
[2:08:42] you don't even have to pray yourself lay
[2:08:44] hands upon the sick and they shall
[2:08:46] recover because the quickness power is
[2:08:48] usual to you

[2:09:50] i'm talking about we're we're presuming
[2:09:53] when preaching his time right he has
[2:09:55] ventured out you know he was
[2:09:57] saying he felt he had something to say
[2:09:59] but listen to what happened
[2:10:01] 25th of july 1965 how we described that
[2:10:04] same message
[2:10:05] what happened monson said god confirmed

[2:10:22] the hidden mystery
[2:10:24] of revelation 10 1-7
[2:10:26] the last message to the last church age
[2:10:29] fulfills exactly message
[2:10:32] since luke 17 30 the day when the son of
[2:10:35] man is revealed
[2:10:37] and the god of heaven promised the even
[2:10:39] time would have even light
[2:10:41] three years ago
[2:10:43] this mystery was a prophecy
[2:10:46] what time is it sir
[2:10:48] so when he's looking back he's not seen
[2:10:50] that as presuming
[2:10:52] he's seeing that as the prophecy
[2:10:54] he says now but how no it is history

[2:11:01] what time is it sir what is this
[2:11:03] attraction
[2:11:05] oh glory to god thank you jesus
[2:11:08] he said the great battles back there
[2:11:11] hallelujah praise god okay let me read
[2:11:13] this you know what we've seen
[2:11:16] should happen what we've seen happen
[2:11:18] should make put every soul in action it
[2:11:20] should make a church i know we hear this
[2:11:21] over and over but here again it should
[2:11:23] make a trade that would make a revival
[2:11:25] here in phoenix that people would say
[2:11:27] will be fine from europe to see what's
[2:11:29] taking place they would say there's a
[2:11:30] place in arizona called the maricopa
[2:11:32] valley a city called phoenix there is
[2:11:34] something broke out there until the
[2:11:36] seven thunders of revelation 10 that's
[2:11:39] not even wrote in the bible is being
[2:11:41] manifested the power of god the end time
[2:11:43] is here the angel has guided up the
[2:11:45] loose ends and we are here he's about to
[2:11:48] write those thunders he said don't write
[2:11:49] them and at the day of the son of the
[2:11:52] last seven angel he said god is not a
[2:11:54] big bunch of gods is one god all these
[2:11:56] things should be finished the great
[2:11:58] battles back there got all the loose
[2:12:00] ends hanging out it's ought to be
[2:12:02] wrapped up together in this last age
[2:12:04] then that song the angel come and said
[2:12:06] time shall be no more o praise the name
[2:12:09] of the lord
[2:12:10] hallelujah praise be to jesus so
[2:12:12] therefore after the sixth seal that
[2:12:15] explains away all the loose ends god
[2:12:18] take the whole thing and hide it under
[2:12:20] the seventh seal of silence
[2:12:22] and he took the thunders from version 10
[2:12:24] and put it right under the science 77
[2:12:26] seal isn't that something
[2:12:28] oh praise the name of the lord praise be
[2:12:31] to jesus i am finished could we please
[2:12:33] something praise the name of the lord
[2:12:35] hallelujah
[2:12:37] okay last quote i'm going to read
[2:12:40] i'm going to read i want to say back the
[2:12:42] same one
[2:12:43] he said do you believe we are living in
[2:12:45] the last days when the sun man was to be
[2:12:47] manifested that would be all the word
[2:12:50] that has been gathered up through luther
[2:12:52] wesley baptist all of that and the
[2:12:55] pentecostal all gathered up into the
[2:12:56] revelation of what has been
[2:12:58] the seventh angel was to open the sexy
[2:13:01] mystery
[2:13:02] it is all gathered up in the son of man
[2:13:05] his fullness of time has come to the
[2:13:07] fullness of the body of his word to
[2:13:09] manifest the fullness of body all praise
[2:13:12] the name of the lord i'm finished oh
[2:13:14] blessed be the name of the lord all the
[2:13:16] word gathered up
[2:13:17] so all the loose ends
[2:13:19] had to be gathered up
[2:13:20] so god is not interested in leaving
[2:13:22] loose ends
[2:13:23] he interested in tina blue's hands that
[2:13:26] you could get the full blessings
[2:13:28] of god the full blessing of god comes
[2:13:30] after the loose ends are tied up
[2:13:32] afterwards and tying up duncan the angel
[2:13:35] to reveal christ the seventh seal
[2:13:38] so baram said that's the one i was
[2:13:39] waiting for waiting on he said that 17th
[2:13:42] job hallelujah that's the one so
[2:13:44] important to me the seventh angel the
[2:13:46] seventh angel the mighty angel the one
[2:13:48] with the straight back wings let's all
[2:13:49] stand as you want to praise the lord
[2:13:50] tonight
[2:13:51] i praise the lord i trust the lord will
[2:13:53] help you and and see that the messenger
[2:13:55] came to
[2:13:56] break six seals as a man seven angel
[2:13:59] messenger
[2:14:00] but son of man christ
[2:14:02] veiled in that prophet luke 17 revealed
[2:14:05] the seven seal
[2:14:06] reveal all about himself
[2:14:08] he unveiled himself and god must all be
[2:14:10] veiled so once that god is unveiled he
[2:14:12] has to feel himself in a bride
[2:14:14] so what did he do he take that that
[2:14:17] whole word and bring it in seed form
[2:14:19] and put that seed inside of you
[2:14:21] as god's secret inside of you and that
[2:14:24] seed have to unfold
[2:14:25] now the seed doesn't look like the fruit
[2:14:28] the seed doesn't resemble the fruit the
[2:14:29] seed looks different
[2:14:31] but from seed to fruit
[2:14:33] is a space what i call process
[2:14:36] hallelujah so when you go to school and
[2:14:38] you're studying and you want to get to
[2:14:39] exams how you get there your study your
[2:14:42] study keep studying revising your work
[2:14:44] and that's the process
[2:14:45] and that process give it bring it to the
[2:14:47] exam room you get the fruit you get a
[2:14:48] certificate with all the subjects
[2:14:50] so when god put that seed he expects
[2:14:52] that seat to unfold and work itself out
[2:14:55] another way he said that joseph
[2:14:57] perfection seed
[2:14:59] is god
[2:15:00] in you
[2:15:01] working his way out
[2:15:03] to where from the inside
[2:15:05] to display himself on the outside so god
[2:15:08] lodge himself inside of you and the
[2:15:10] devil do have a clue because he can't go
[2:15:12] in your heart only the word could he say
[2:15:15] in your heart so when god dropped the
[2:15:16] seed in your heart devil can't touch
[2:15:18] that he could touch your flesh he could
[2:15:21] touch your spirit but he captures the
[2:15:23] sea that god put in your soul
[2:15:24] in your heart and your subconscious
[2:15:26] is anchored inside the deer
[2:15:28] he can't change that
[2:15:30] god himself can't change that that's
[2:15:32] original seed so therefore you connect
[2:15:34] with spoken word and when you understand
[2:15:37] by revelation the six seals tie up all
[2:15:40] the loose ends that the seven seekers
[2:15:42] step forward you will recognize this
[2:15:43] message is clean it is clear and we are
[2:15:46] on our way to the rapture let's bow our
[2:15:48] heads heavenly father we thank you to

[2:15:55] and the greatest of prevailing power is
[2:15:57] divine revelation and while the weight
[2:15:59] of dynamics or written power while
[2:16:01] writing your spirit may your spirit come
[2:16:03] and reveal your word to your people that
[2:16:04] they will have such a charge in their
[2:16:06] life because as you deal with the church
[2:16:08] ages so you deal with the individual as
