[53:55] there are so many conditions lord that i
[53:57] pray there god that he would minister to
[53:59] each one in the mighty precious name of
[54:02] jesus christ and the church says
[54:04] amen and amen amen you love the lord
[54:07] this
[54:08] morning amen so if you have your bibles
[54:13] would you turn with me to one portion of
[54:15] scripture
[54:16] i'd like to read from the book of
[54:18] colossians chapter three
[54:20] certainly welcome one and all in the
[54:22] precious name of jesus christ
[54:24] those that are here those that are
[54:25] connected online as well
[54:28] uh let's have church
[54:30] amen certainly appreciate the convention
[54:33] uh last weekend how many were blessed by
[54:35] the convention last weekend
[54:37] certainly thank god
[54:39] for his unfolding of his grace and his
[54:41] love to us
[54:42] as we near our departure from this
[54:46] this existence to what we are really
[54:48] called to do
[54:50] so we're going to read three verses
[54:51] there in colossians
[54:53] uh colossians three reading from verse
[54:55] one
[54:57] if ye then be risen with christ
[55:01] so this this scripture here is not
[55:03] addressed to everyone it's only
[55:06] expressed
[55:07] or addressed to this specific
[55:10] designation if ye be then risen with
[55:13] christ it means there are those who are
[55:15] not risen with christ but if
[55:17] it's a conditionality it's conditional
[55:20] if ye then be risen with christ
[55:23] then i have an expectation or a commando
[55:25] and instruction seek those things
[55:28] which are above
[55:30] where christ sit on the right hand of
[55:32] god set your affection on things above
[55:37] not on things on the earth for ye are
[55:40] dead and your life is hid with christ in
[55:44] god may the lord have a blessing to the
[55:46] reading of his word you may be seated in
[55:49] the presence of the lord this morning
[55:51] and i have a title this morning seek
[55:54] those things which are above
[55:58] seek those things which are above and
[56:02] it's a simple message i'll have a little
[56:04] almost a little bible teaching insider
[56:06] here as well because i believe this
[56:08] colossians 3 is a really powerful
[56:11] scripture to look at because so many
[56:14] times and we have to embrace the truth
[56:16] of the fact that we are constantly in a
[56:18] battle
[56:19] and we cannot take for granted if it's
[56:21] one thing that you see through the word
[56:23] you cannot take for granted your past
[56:26] experience with god
[56:28] as your present battle you can use your
[56:30] past experience to build your fate but
[56:33] it doesn't mean you won't have a new
[56:34] battle this morning a new battle
[56:36] tomorrow a new battle on wednesday a new
[56:39] battle on friday a new challenge and a
[56:41] new situation and all of the things that
[56:44] happen to us i believe are for
[56:46] distractions to keep our eyes away from
[56:49] what's most important
[56:51] and it's so easy to lose sight of what's
[56:53] most important so we want to reinforce
[56:56] this morning to seek those things which
[56:59] are above
[57:00] and to set our affection on things that
[57:03] are above not on things on the earth now
[57:06] bearing in mind paul is speaking to
[57:08] those who are risen with christ so he's
[57:10] also reminding them that it's easy for
[57:13] your affection to get set on the things
[57:15] on the earth but he's encouraging them
[57:17] here in this scripture to set and that
[57:20] set is a decision to make
[57:22] it's a choice to make it's a
[57:25] consciousness that you are making you're
[57:27] making it in the morning you're making
[57:28] it at lunch time you're making it in
[57:30] your home you're making it at a church
[57:32] you're making it when you feel the fly
[57:34] off the handle you're still remembering
[57:36] there's something higher that's going on
[57:38] right now i'm in a situation at the bank
[57:41] but there's something more important
[57:42] that's going on right now there's a
[57:44] situation in my family but there's
[57:46] something more important that's going on
[57:48] right now whenever you you get
[57:51] distracted and you and you fly off your
[57:53] handle and you you lose your temper and
[57:55] you get all upset and you have oughts
[57:58] and grudges and these things that will
[57:59] get it in the scripture it meant you
[58:01] have taken your eyes off of what's above
[58:03] and you are now focusing on what's lower
[58:05] than what's above but we are not called
[58:08] to operate in this existence we are not
[58:10] called to operate on our level we are
[58:13] being challenged to go a little higher
[58:16] so by the grace of god this morning we
[58:19] want to go a little higher because when
[58:21] you go higher all of your perspectives
[58:23] begin to change once you could break
[58:25] past the sound barrier and come out of
[58:28] this existence your worship changes your
[58:31] understanding changes your revelation
[58:34] changes your focus changes your desires
[58:37] changing what's your desire this morning
[58:40] what are you here for this morning
[58:42] what's your desire this week what's your
[58:44] focus this week how did you find
[58:46] yourself lost along the way somewhere
[58:49] you need to check what you are looking
[58:51] at because what you look at is what
[58:53] you're going to see hallelujah when you
[58:55] look what you're going to see this
[58:56] morning it depends on what you're
[58:58] looking for if you come here looking for
[59:00] mistakes you're going to find mistakes
[59:02] if you're looking for falls in yourself
[59:04] you're gonna find fault in yourself up
[59:06] you're gonna find fault in your brother
[59:08] you can spend all day looking at
[59:09] somebody else up but if you change your
[59:11] focus from the falls and the mistakes
[59:14] and the issues and the problems and all
[59:17] of these other things and focus on above
[59:20] then everything else begins to disappear
[59:23] hallelujah hallelujah seek those things
[59:27] up i'm not saying don't go after a house
[59:29] i'm not saying don't go after a car i'm
[59:32] not saying don't go after a better job
[59:34] but make sure in all you're getting you
[59:36] don't lose sight to seek those things
[59:39] which are above
[59:41] oh too many of us spend our daily living
[59:44] seeking to sort out the natural things
[59:47] and not enough focus is spent on seeking
[59:50] the things that are above
[59:52] oh hallelujah it is not something
[59:55] impossible to attain but it requires
[59:58] focus it requires dedication it requires
[1:00:01] commitment that's why paul could say to
[1:00:04] the church if you are risen with christ
[1:00:06] if you are identified with his
[1:00:08] resurrection if you are identified with
[1:00:11] why he came if you are identified with
[1:00:13] the fact that he died and he rose again
[1:00:16] and you know that you died with him and
[1:00:18] you are identified with calvary and you
[1:00:21] identify with when he was buried and you
[1:00:23] identified with when he rose from the
[1:00:25] dead
[1:00:26] now your work begins
[1:00:29] to seek
[1:00:30] to ask
[1:00:31] to knock
[1:00:32] to press
[1:00:33] to do something to cut things off to add
[1:00:36] certain things to adjust your position
[1:00:39] to change your attitude to change your
[1:00:41] focus oh hallelujah it takes effort to
[1:00:45] smile when you should be upset but
[1:00:48] that's part of seeking the things that
[1:00:49] are above us because on that side when
[1:00:52] things are above there is no sadness
[1:00:54] there there's no depression there yes
[1:00:57] you have to deal with the flesh but the
[1:00:59] bible says mortify that flesh
[1:01:01] mortify your feelings this morning
[1:01:04] mortify your body bring your body under
[1:01:06] subjection bring your emotions on the
[1:01:09] bring your feelings on the subjection
[1:01:12] bring your attitude on the subjection
[1:01:15] oh hallelujah
[1:01:17] hallelujah
[1:01:19] you have to forgive me this morning but
[1:01:21] i'm tired of living lower than my
[1:01:24] station i'm tired of living under my
[1:01:26] privilege that's what brother branham
[1:01:28] said the church of the body of christ is
[1:01:31] one of the sickest bodies on the face of
[1:01:33] the earth because we are living under
[1:01:35] our god-given privileges we should be
[1:01:37] living higher we should be flying higher
[1:01:40] we should be in a different realm we
[1:01:43] should be in a higher place oh
[1:01:45] hallelujah no wonder god could tell john
[1:01:47] come up hither come up higher he was in
[1:01:50] the spirit and god said there's still
[1:01:52] more
[1:01:53] they're still higher they're still
[1:01:55] higher whatever is the greatest
[1:01:57] experience you have ever had in the
[1:01:59] supernatural there's still more because
[1:02:02] it's an infinite god
[1:02:03] oh hallelujah you cannot figure him out
[1:02:06] up you he is distorted higher than our
[1:02:09] thoughts his ways are higher than always
[1:02:12] he said as the heaven is higher than the
[1:02:14] earth so am i taught above your thoughts
[1:02:16] but only those things which are revealed
[1:02:18] unto us they belong to us they are
[1:02:21] things that god has not unfolded to you
[1:02:23] yet but the mysteries of what we need to
[1:02:26] be changed
[1:02:28] that's revealed to us
[1:02:30] what are we doing about it
[1:02:32] what are we doing with it
[1:02:34] i'm tired of living is anybody this
[1:02:36] morning tired of living up and down
[1:02:38] tired of living under your privilege
[1:02:41] tired of not knowing where you're going
[1:02:43] and you have a revelation you know but
[1:02:45] there's something pulling you back and
[1:02:47] it's a constant battle and it's supposed
[1:02:49] to be a battle but you have to know that
[1:02:51] one day you're gonna break past this
[1:02:53] sound barrier it's a level of resistance
[1:02:56] hallelujah when a plane is trying to
[1:02:58] take off
[1:02:59] it has some trembling going on has some
[1:03:02] tremors going on it has some shaking
[1:03:04] going on until it break pass up so if
[1:03:07] you're strumbling this morning if there
[1:03:09] are tremors in your life if things are

[1:05:55] work it takes to stay angry at somebody
[1:05:57] you know how much work it is just to
[1:06:00] worry about your bills it takes effort
[1:06:02] to worry but if you put down the worry

[1:06:07] oh hallelujah seek ye first the kingdom
[1:06:10] of god
[1:06:11] i told you i don't have a complex
[1:06:13] message but i'm tired of seeing people

[1:06:17] message weighed down with situations
[1:06:20] don't you have faith that god could
[1:06:22] provide for you don't you have faith
[1:06:25] david said i'm young once i was young

[1:06:30] righteous forsaken don't you have faith
[1:06:32] in this god that you serve that you fly
[1:06:35] higher he could take care of your
[1:06:37] situations that you could never figure
[1:06:39] out don't wait until didn't get bad no
[1:06:42] fly up this morning
[1:06:45] mama eagle the holy ghost itself that
[1:06:48] mother eagle is hovering over the church
[1:06:50] this morning looking to catch anybody
[1:06:53] who is willing to break past their
[1:06:56] self-imposed limitations break past the
[1:06:58] limitations of their past break past the
[1:07:01] limitations of yes i don't care about
[1:07:04] yesterday i'm talking about no
[1:07:06] no faith is
[1:07:08] this is the beginning of the rest of
[1:07:10] your life i don't care about yesterday i
[1:07:12] don't care about last month i don't care
[1:07:14] about last week
[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:19] this here right now is all i know
[1:07:21] there's nothing you could do to change
[1:07:23] your past you cannot change it there's
[1:07:25] nothing you could do there is nothing
[1:07:27] you could do to change your passive you
[1:07:30] only have power today
[1:07:32] today
[1:07:33] today to worship power today to praise
[1:07:37] god power today to flap those wings
[1:07:40] and care how long you've been in the
[1:07:42] barnyard i don't care how long you
[1:07:44] thought you was a chicken i don't care
[1:07:46] how long you've eaten chicken food and
[1:07:48] played in chicken places
[1:07:50] [Music]
[1:07:51] [Applause]
[1:07:54] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:07:58] you may be seated
[1:08:00] when you go for a job
[1:08:02] what a job ask you for is your resume
[1:08:04] your job wants to know your history your
[1:08:06] job wants to know your background your
[1:08:08] job wants to know your experience to be
[1:08:11] employed by god he don't care about your
[1:08:12] resume he don't want to know where you
[1:08:14] come from he don't want to know your
[1:08:16] experience he don't want to know your
[1:08:17] qualifications to be employed to be part
[1:08:20] of this body of christ it has all to do
[1:08:23] with your destination
[1:08:24] not where you come from it has to do
[1:08:26] with where you're going do you know
[1:08:28] where you're going because my bible
[1:08:30] tells me we are called for something
[1:08:31] higher and because you're plain
[1:08:34] your body your heart your soul could go
[1:08:37] to higher altitudes that's why god
[1:08:40] called you
[1:08:42] you could rise above your situation you
[1:08:44] could rise above it hallelujah
[1:08:47] no wonder the brother branham said when
[1:08:49] you lift your hands you defy the laws of
[1:08:52] gravity it might be simple but just that
[1:08:55] act alone
[1:08:56] just that act alone is an act of faith
[1:08:59] and that's why i always say you may be
[1:09:01] seated we bring a sacrifice of praise
[1:09:06] it's a sacrifice because it costs
[1:09:08] something
[1:09:10] because there are times in your life you
[1:09:12] don't feel like it
[1:09:14] read the psalms david and many times he
[1:09:16] didn't feel like it
[1:09:19] there are many times david felt
[1:09:21] depressed and frustrated but somehow
[1:09:23] when you read it he'll find a way to
[1:09:25] work himself back into something
[1:09:28] many are there that rise up against me
[1:09:31] that's the part when he's he's looking
[1:09:32] at himself and looking many a day that
[1:09:35] say of my soul there's no help for him
[1:09:37] in god that that's what he's seeing but
[1:09:40] then another gear throws in and he
[1:09:42] remembers that he is born to fly and he
[1:09:44] said but thou o lord are a shield for me
[1:09:48] [Music]
[1:09:50] can you throw in another gear in your
[1:09:52] spiritual walk
[1:09:53] can you throw in another gear despite
[1:09:56] what's happening with your family can
[1:09:58] you throw in another gear despite what
[1:10:00] you're dealing with in your home yes i
[1:10:02] know they are home issues yes i know
[1:10:04] there are challenges but that's how god
[1:10:06] allowed it to be for your maturity for
[1:10:08] your perfection to force you to fly
[1:10:11] because if you if you get too
[1:10:12] comfortable you'll stay in the barnyard
[1:10:15] so god is coming this morning to shake
[1:10:17] up your barnyard for you to recognize
[1:10:19] you're not a chicken but you're an eagle
[1:10:22] and you're born to fly to receive the
[1:10:24] holy ghost to have your personal revival
[1:10:27] to have a new walk to have a new ho oh
[1:10:30] come on now
[1:10:32] [Applause]
[1:10:37] so i thank god for the situations i
[1:10:39] thank god for the child i thank god for
[1:10:42] the interruptions and the disruptions
[1:10:45] that's god's way of starting a revival
[1:10:47] in your soul it has nothing to do with
[1:10:50] anybody else i don't know what's going
[1:10:52] to happen this morning but i want
[1:10:53] somebody to break free to break loose to
[1:10:57] break out to break from to break towards
[1:11:00] hallelujah it's a great escape
[1:11:03] hallelujah if the devil can keep you in
[1:11:05] a barnyard he would if the devil can
[1:11:07] keep you tied up he would if he could
[1:11:10] keep him in bondage he would but you
[1:11:12] have the power this morning come on
[1:11:14] johnny crow let's fly
[1:11:16] [Applause]
[1:11:22] let's fly
[1:11:24] let's fly higher
[1:11:25] hallelujah
[1:11:29] i was looking at the study
[1:11:31] two studies i saw
[1:11:33] say if you take a baby elephant by the
[1:11:34] cliff and you tie that baby elephant to
[1:11:37] a pole and they do it for circus
[1:11:39] training
[1:11:40] that baby elephant when they tie him to
[1:11:42] the pole
[1:11:44] he learns to walk around the pole and
[1:11:46] he's tied to the pole they say no matter
[1:11:49] how much he grows and he gets bigger
[1:11:51] even when you cut the rope and you put
[1:11:52] him back near the pole he start to
[1:11:54] circle it again
[1:11:56] because he's been conditioned in his
[1:11:58] mind
[1:11:59] that that pole and that string
[1:12:02] even though he has the strength but a
[1:12:04] punch to break out he doesn't break out
[1:12:09] what's holding him back it's not the
[1:12:11] rope
[1:12:12] he's bigger he's stronger
[1:12:14] with one move he could rip out the rope
[1:12:17] but he believes that that rope that held
[1:12:19] him as a young baby
[1:12:20] is just as powerful as when he was young
[1:12:22] and he couldn't do it he didn't even
[1:12:24] realize he was growing
[1:12:26] he didn't realize the relationship
[1:12:28] between his growth and his ability to
[1:12:30] break free
[1:12:32] and you have to realize that as you grow
[1:12:34] in the world even though you're
[1:12:35] struggling with certain things don't
[1:12:37] underestimate the value of what every
[1:12:40] service does to you
[1:12:42] don't underestimate the value of what
[1:12:45] each word does to you because you are
[1:12:48] stronger and that's why the devil's job
[1:12:50] is to try to really mess up your mind
[1:12:53] and to reconnect your mind to your
[1:12:56] pastor your mistakes your failures but
[1:12:58] if you can just realize this morning
[1:13:00] that you are out listen you older and
[1:13:02] the devil you now
[1:13:07] i've preached it before you have
[1:13:08] seniority you know before the angels
[1:13:10] were created you when god oh do you know
[1:13:12] who you are
[1:13:15] and you had a representation when
[1:13:17] lucifer was kicked out
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:24] [Applause]
[1:13:25] oh hallelujah
[1:13:29] so catch a revelation this morning
[1:13:32] of who you are
[1:13:36] seek those things
[1:13:38] which are above
[1:13:40] how many people have lost themselves
[1:13:43] seeking the natural things
[1:13:46] and no matter how much money you have
[1:13:48] how much wealth you have how much of
[1:13:50] whatever you have
[1:13:52] there comes a point when it matters not
[1:13:59] listen to anybody who's on a deathbed
[1:14:01] anybody who is who is transitioning
[1:14:03] anybody and and they will tell you what
[1:14:05] they wish they had more of
[1:14:08] and what they would have done
[1:14:08] differently and it has nothing to do
[1:14:10] with the acquisition of more things that
[1:14:12] are of these
[1:14:14] nothing to do with it
[1:14:20] don't let the devil fool you with what's
[1:14:22] important
[1:14:23] don't let the devil take up your time
[1:14:26] over the last few days i was doing some
[1:14:27] research and i saw somebody speaking
[1:14:29] about how old and i mentioned how all
[1:14:31] the technology is rewiring our brains
[1:14:35] and there's a chemical part of it that
[1:14:37] the body of brain releases dopamine
[1:14:39] every time there's a short-term pleasure
[1:14:41] so you see a short-term video or
[1:14:43] whatever it is and every time it keeps
[1:14:45] you in this cycle of new things
[1:14:47] so that you're never bored and you
[1:14:49] always and people and young people in
[1:14:50] particular spending hours and hours and
[1:14:52] hours on social media and they're
[1:14:54] chasing this high
[1:14:56] this elusive high it's like taking a
[1:14:58] drug you know
[1:15:02] and people are addicted to technology
[1:15:04] addicted to all kinds of things and and
[1:15:06] it's becoming more difficult to focus
[1:15:09] to meditate
[1:15:10] to really understand and and it sounds
[1:15:12] simple but the reality is it affects
[1:15:15] your work because when you when it's
[1:15:16] time to pray your car pray
[1:15:20] you can't spend a half an hour an hour
[1:15:23] two hours or three hours in prayer no
[1:15:24] you can you spend 30 seconds because
[1:15:27] your brain has been trained to do things
[1:15:28] in 30 seconds
[1:15:30] sprints
[1:15:33] when the world says meditate on the word
[1:15:34] day and night
[1:15:36] let this be your source
[1:15:40] it doesn't say when you have a chance
[1:15:42] you know it's it doesn't it said seek
[1:15:44] those things
[1:15:46] seek is a active word
[1:15:48] it means you get up in the morning and
[1:15:50] you're seeking
[1:15:52] it means you're doing your job but you
[1:15:54] know you're seeking you're you're on
[1:15:56] this constant mission that doesn't ever
[1:15:58] turn off
[1:16:01] you're doing your job you're doing your
[1:16:02] work you're talking to family but in
[1:16:04] your heart you want to make sure that
[1:16:06] you're keeping your focus on the things
[1:16:08] that are above
[1:16:12] and that consciousness makes you adjust
[1:16:15] what words you use
[1:16:17] that consciousness makes you adjust who
[1:16:20] you spend time with
[1:16:21] that consciousness because you cannot be
[1:16:23] seeking the things that are above and
[1:16:26] watching movies that are taking you to
[1:16:27] hell
[1:16:29] anybody with me this morning don't tell
[1:16:32] me you're seeking the things that are
[1:16:33] above and you're spending time listening
[1:16:35] to music that is not going to take you
[1:16:38] above
[1:16:40] don't lie to yourself don't lie to god
[1:16:45] if you're really serious about seeking
[1:16:47] those things are above then the bible
[1:16:49] for you becomes a new book
[1:16:52] it doesn't become something you refer to
[1:16:54] in a service it becomes something you
[1:16:56] realize is the road map to get out of
[1:16:59] here
[1:17:00] [Applause]
[1:17:02] is not a ritual
[1:17:03] it is not a suggestion it's not a
[1:17:05] recommendation but it's a part of your
[1:17:08] life you don't know how you're going to
[1:17:10] live without it
[1:17:15] all of a sudden the spoken word books
[1:17:17] take on a new meaning
[1:17:22] because it's the currency to take you
[1:17:25] out of here
[1:17:27] hallelujah god help us this morning i
[1:17:29] don't know who is going to help but i
[1:17:30] want us to
[1:17:32] be reminded and to leave here with the
[1:17:34] whole focus
[1:17:35] it adjusts your prayer life is it just
[1:17:37] your approach how much time you lose
[1:17:39] yourself when you fly out of your hand
[1:17:41] when you get upset and then you end up
[1:17:42] in situations that you wish you didn't
[1:17:44] end up in
[1:17:46] and if you're really honest with
[1:17:47] yourself and look back at how i got
[1:17:49] there you'll realize you know if i was
[1:17:52] conscious of god's presence and my
[1:17:54] desire to be with him i wouldn't have
[1:17:56] said those words
[1:17:59] or wouldn't have said it that way
[1:18:01] or wouldn't have spoken about that
[1:18:02] person in that way or would it have
[1:18:04] acted that way or wouldn't have done
[1:18:07] that thing
[1:18:09] we have said it we can't change the past
[1:18:11] so it doesn't make sense going there but
[1:18:12] from this day forward i challenge you i
[1:18:15] encourage you let's press higher let's
[1:18:17] climb higher let's walk different
[1:18:21] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah as
[1:18:25] we move towards a transformation because
[1:18:27] this whole scripture seeking things are
[1:18:29] above for a year dead and your life is
[1:18:31] hit with god in christ with with with
[1:18:33] christ in god is a transformation a
[1:18:36] transformation of your mind your heart
[1:18:38] your desires your everything until
[1:18:40] people know you're a christian you don't
[1:18:41] even need to tell them
[1:18:43] because your life has said you are dead
[1:18:46] all of a sudden we're about with now
[1:18:47] that's the same brother who used to be
[1:18:49] that way but how are you you're really
[1:18:50] different and it's not a show it's not
[1:18:52] an act it's very difficult to act for a
[1:18:53] long time you know
[1:18:58] but it's so real you can't help yourself
[1:19:00] i preached this in a message for the
[1:19:02] convention your hand that didn't want to
[1:19:04] shake somebody's hand all of a sudden
[1:19:05] you find yourself shaking their
[1:19:06] hand because it's a different life
[1:19:08] working through you is it from behavior
[1:19:11] looking to you because you have climbed
[1:19:12] so much higher that all are your petty
[1:19:14] feelings about brothers so-and-so or
[1:19:16] sister so and so can it's not compatible
[1:19:19] with that level of altitude
[1:19:21] once you go that higher level those
[1:19:23] petty things don't matter anymore all
[1:19:26] you know is love because only perfect
[1:19:28] love could oh come on now all you know
[1:19:29] is love
[1:19:36] it is simple principles friends it was
[1:19:39] the love of god for god so loved the
[1:19:41] world that love that existed and that
[1:19:43] level was so great
[1:19:46] you know you better than i know you
[1:19:48] i know me better than you know me
[1:19:54] and god's love looked at all of us
[1:19:57] and say that one i want that one
[1:20:00] that one i want that one
[1:20:02] that one i won that one
[1:20:05] and we find ourselves on them looking at
[1:20:07] this one that one this one that one and
[1:20:09] their situation not realizing that the
[1:20:11] same love that is for them is what came
[1:20:13] to us
[1:20:14] found us met us overlooked our fault
[1:20:17] overlooked our situations and that's why
[1:20:20] i have hope for everybody here this
[1:20:21] morning i have faith for everybody here
[1:20:23] this morning i believe for every single
[1:20:26] one here this morning that you could get
[1:20:28] the holy ghost you could be changed you
[1:20:30] could be transformed oh hallelujah
[1:20:35] somebody give the lord a shout out
[1:20:36] praise everybody feeling fine
[1:20:38] [Applause]
[1:20:38] [Music]
[1:20:43] seek those things which are above you
[1:20:46] need to take control of your time church
[1:20:50] you need to take control of your time
[1:20:55] everybody here have the same 24 hours in
[1:20:58] a
[1:20:59] everybody in the world have you seen 24
[1:21:01] hours every day
[1:21:03] i was
[1:21:04] in the barber shop yesterday and
[1:21:06] somebody was talking about is struggling
[1:21:08] with something
[1:21:10] some business idea or something
[1:21:13] and it just came back to my mind and say
[1:21:15] i'm listening to them struggling
[1:21:17] just listening just over here in the
[1:21:18] conversation and i'm saying the same
[1:21:20] time they have
[1:21:22] it's the same time during the day that
[1:21:24] businessmen who are 5 10 20 five
[1:21:27] business self
[1:21:30] so the time is not the issue you know
[1:21:34] it's how you use the time
[1:21:38] i heard somebody say some time ago
[1:21:39] people complain about this complaint
[1:21:41] about this
[1:21:42] and he was speaking about somebody who
[1:21:43] reached out to him and he said complain
[1:21:45] how his business did well he asked him
[1:21:47] what are you doing right now he said
[1:21:48] well it's sunday evening i'm relaxing
[1:21:50] i'm watching some netflix
[1:21:52] he said you ready not worried about your
[1:21:54] business
[1:21:56] because if you're really worried about
[1:21:57] your business you wouldn't be spending
[1:21:58] time on us
[1:21:59] you you actually have time to relax
[1:22:05] because if it was really an issue then
[1:22:07] you would take it off and you would get
[1:22:08] down on your pen and your paper and
[1:22:10] write what are the problems what ideas
[1:22:12] do i have what can i implement what are
[1:22:15] the priorities what is it and that
[1:22:18] activity might take you 15 minutes 20
[1:22:20] minutes or what to do
[1:22:21] but you would be further down the road
[1:22:23] to progress than spending two three
[1:22:25] hours on netflix saying well you're so
[1:22:26] stressed out you need a break
[1:22:29] i'm not saying you don't have time to
[1:22:30] rest and take a break and and the
[1:22:32] prophet you went went to the forest or
[1:22:33] relaxing but there are certain things
[1:22:35] that you must do
[1:22:37] but that comes to you making a choice
[1:22:39] because this scripture is active seek
[1:22:41] those things and then verse two set your
[1:22:44] affection set is like you go to the
[1:22:46] microwave and you set it
[1:22:49] nobody can do it for you you know you
[1:22:52] have to program your affection
[1:22:55] set your affection on things above not
[1:22:58] on things on the earth
[1:23:00] how have you programmed yourself
[1:23:03] this is not god doing it for you
[1:23:08] can we talk about this this is not god
[1:23:10] coming and
[1:23:11] and force you to behave a certain way or
[1:23:13] force you to forgive or force you to
[1:23:15] pray where have you programmed and set
[1:23:19] your affection because wherever you set
[1:23:21] your affection or where your heart is
[1:23:26] that's who you are
[1:23:27] but that's something you need to set
[1:23:30] your father can't set it your mother
[1:23:31] can't set it your brother can't set it
[1:23:34] and as it is
[1:23:36] is in the spiritual isn't it in
[1:23:38] the natural
[1:23:41] so your parents had to beat you to study
[1:23:42] for school
[1:23:44] young brother young sister go and study
[1:23:46] now go on sarina so you don't want to
[1:23:48] study you don't want to succeed you
[1:23:49] don't want to be able to provide
[1:23:51] when a bible say a man who can't provide
[1:23:53] me families worse than an infidel i
[1:23:54] scripture too
[1:24:00] so it's not even to please your parents
[1:24:01] you know that's scripture
[1:24:04] so if there are certain steps to take
[1:24:06] how are you programming yourself why are
[1:24:08] you programming yourself for
[1:24:09] entertainment
[1:24:11] [Music]
[1:24:14] and entertainment in in in its broadest
[1:24:16] sense simply means spending time doing
[1:24:19] unimportant things for pleasure
[1:24:24] you're finding time because you see
[1:24:26] listen it's easier for some of us to
[1:24:27] relax and to confront issues to fix
[1:24:31] you're complaining well i don't have
[1:24:32] enough point to do this i don't mean you
[1:24:34] know i'm going to do that have you set a
[1:24:35] budget
[1:24:37] have you looked at the expenses
[1:24:40] do you have a plan for the month
[1:24:44] oh you're just taking there and go on
[1:24:46] and you take a complaining never have
[1:24:48] sold anything yet uh
[1:24:52] i could show you for every person who
[1:24:54] has a complaint there's somebody else
[1:24:55] with the exact same situation who has a
[1:24:57] different mindset a different approach a
[1:24:59] different attitude and living life
[1:25:01] differently and most of them not even in
[1:25:03] church
[1:25:07] but what are they they are prepared to
[1:25:09] confront the reality of their situation
[1:25:12] and make the changes in their lives why
[1:25:14] you're not praying every day
[1:25:17] what is your excuse
[1:25:19] what is your affection is the news in
[1:25:21] the morning in the evening more is that
[1:25:23] what the affection is you love to know
[1:25:25] what's going on
[1:25:27] well know what's going on straight into
[1:25:29] hell
[1:25:34] is that any kind of jump for joy message
[1:25:35] you have to forgive me you know but i am
[1:25:37] taking here what paul is teaching and
[1:25:39] trying to remind us with some clarity of
[1:25:43] what is our work what is god's
[1:25:45] responsibility what is the
[1:25:47] responsibility of the ministry
[1:25:50] but every individual has to make their
[1:25:52] calling and election sure
[1:25:54] and if they have things that i need to
[1:25:56] do
[1:25:57] to fix it i want to know and i want to
[1:25:59] do i don't just want to know what you
[1:26:00] know i want to do it
[1:26:02] because plenty people know what to do
[1:26:03] but they're not doing anything
[1:26:08] if you really want change you have to
[1:26:10] know and you have to do
[1:26:13] be not hearers of the word that's
[1:26:15] scripture but doers people hear any word
[1:26:18] here in the world and they don't want to
[1:26:19] fix the issue
[1:26:22] how long you'll hold oats and grudges
[1:26:24] and not forgive and not let go really in
[1:26:26] 2022
[1:26:28] after you hear it for years you're
[1:26:29] really struggling in 2022 to forgive
[1:26:34] you really strong in 2022
[1:26:37] is that people who not even christians
[1:26:40] don't understand talk about the law of
[1:26:42] attraction and forgiving and all kind of
[1:26:43] thing
[1:26:44] and you hear any message for all these
[1:26:46] years i know the virtue of the age is
[1:26:47] broadly kindness and can't forgive me
[1:26:50] it's a rebuke to some of us who's
[1:26:52] supposed to know better you know
[1:26:56] anybody with me
[1:26:59] it are people who consistent in the
[1:27:01] world with their morning affirmations
[1:27:03] their declarations i am a conqueror i'm
[1:27:06] gonna make it i'm gonna have a great day
[1:27:08] and and they spend they don't miss it
[1:27:11] for the morning
[1:27:14] and that is their version of their
[1:27:16] prayer
[1:27:17] but they are consistent with it and when
[1:27:19] they finish they feel the right to
[1:27:20] conquer the world
[1:27:21] what are you feeding on
[1:27:23] what is your affection on
[1:27:27] and for those of you who say well i am
[1:27:28] praying every morning well pray more
[1:27:32] push a little more because he could
[1:27:34] always go higher you can always go fly
[1:27:36] higher
[1:27:37] john said i was in the spirit on the
[1:27:39] lord's day and the word said come up
[1:27:40] hither
[1:27:42] come up higher let me show you the
[1:27:43] things that must be thereafter oh
[1:27:45] hallelujah somebody say man
[1:27:51] what are we talking about all of this
[1:27:52] friends is to turn you into a new
[1:27:54] creation you know
[1:27:57] that this old vile wretched body mind
[1:28:00] everything could be put under subjection
[1:28:02] and a new you started sharing out that
[1:28:05] god could use and tabernacle himself can
[1:28:08] the church say amen in the message and
[1:28:10] exposition of the seven church ages nine
[1:28:12] the laodicean church age he said but now
[1:28:15] he is standing in the midst of the
[1:28:16] church as he stands there revealing who
[1:28:19] he is in this last age he calls himself
[1:28:21] the author of the creation of god this
[1:28:24] is another creation
[1:28:26] this has to do with the church this is a
[1:28:28] special designation of himself he is the
[1:28:31] creator of that church the heavenly
[1:28:33] bridegroom created his own bride
[1:28:37] as a spirit of god he came down and
[1:28:39] created in the virgin mary the cells
[1:28:42] from which his body was born i want to
[1:28:44] repeat that he created the very cells in
[1:28:46] the womb of mary for that body
[1:28:49] it was not enough for the holy spirit to
[1:28:52] simply give life to a human ovum
[1:28:54] supplied by mary that would have been
[1:28:56] sinful man producing her body so you
[1:28:59] hear what brother man was bringing out
[1:29:00] here that the sperm and the egg in mary
[1:29:03] was all created by god mary had nothing
[1:29:05] to do with it
[1:29:07] that is how much involvement god wants
[1:29:09] in transforming you till it is not you
[1:29:11] at all but god is doing something in you
[1:29:14] so the life that's being produced in you
[1:29:17] is the seed of god
[1:29:19] being made manifest
[1:29:22] and if you could just get out of the way
[1:29:23] and climb higher
[1:29:25] automatically that seed oh come on now
[1:29:27] somebody help me the moment you get into
[1:29:30] the spirit
[1:29:31] that seed
[1:29:32] can't help itself because the cheese of
[1:29:35] that seed is god himself hallelujah it's
[1:29:39] not your father it's not your mother
[1:29:41] it's not your grandfather it's not your
[1:29:43] grandmother but there's a seed in you
[1:29:45] that is unstoppable there's a seed in
[1:29:47] you that cannot die
[1:29:49] there's a seed in you that can only
[1:29:51] produce the life of jesus christ there's
[1:29:53] a seed in you
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:29:56] but if you stay at this level all the
[1:29:58] time this carnal humanistic realm that
[1:30:01] seed can't do much but if you like the
[1:30:04] lily you press past the muck you press
[1:30:06] past the mire you press past the
[1:30:08] situation and you peep your head up to
[1:30:10] get a little higher then all of a sudden
[1:30:12] the sun
[1:30:14] could shine on that seed and that seed
[1:30:16] could only produce after its kind
[1:30:19] and we'll know what kind of seed it is
[1:30:21] because it'll show what type of life
[1:30:23] what type of fruit it is
[1:30:25] can the church say amen
[1:30:29] seek those things
[1:30:31] which are above
[1:30:37] that would have been sinful a reading
[1:30:39] against sinful mankind producing a body
[1:30:41] that would not have produced the last
[1:30:43] adam
[1:30:45] of him it was a law a body has thou
[1:30:47] father prepared for me god not mary but
[1:30:50] ireland said provided that body
[1:30:52] mary was the human incubator and she
[1:30:55] carried that holy child and brought him
[1:30:58] to birth he was a god man he was the son
[1:31:01] of god he was of the new creation
[1:31:04] hallelujah he was of the new creation
[1:31:07] because it wasn't the germ of man
[1:31:10] involved at all it was god who provided
[1:31:13] a sperm it was god who provided the egg
[1:31:15] and that made him of the new creation
[1:31:19] hallelujah
[1:31:20] [Applause]
[1:31:23] man and god met and joined and listen to
[1:31:26] the prophet he was the first of this new
[1:31:28] race he is the head of this new race
[1:31:32] colossians 1 18 and he is the head of
[1:31:34] the body the church who is the beginning
[1:31:36] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:31:38] things he might have the preeminence
[1:31:41] second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any
[1:31:44] man be in christ you heard the scripture
[1:31:46] you read in colossians we don't want
[1:31:48] being in christ if any man be in christ
[1:31:51] i don't care what your pastor says i
[1:31:53] don't care where he was born i don't
[1:31:54] care much money you have but if any man
[1:31:57] be in christ
[1:31:58] not your foot alone not your head alone
[1:32:01] not in christ on a sunday not in christ
[1:32:04] on a wednesday but all of you
[1:32:08] hid in christ if any man
[1:32:11] no limitation no restriction for anybody
[1:32:14] who climbs higher if any man be in
[1:32:16] christ he is a new creation
[1:32:19] automatically
[1:32:20] you connect to that new lineage
[1:32:23] that spirit walk that spirit talk that
[1:32:27] defying of your old nature anybody want
[1:32:29] to preach back to me this morning
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:31] [Music]
[1:32:38] hallelujah all things have passed away
[1:32:41] behold all things have become new there
[1:32:44] you can see in that that though man was
[1:32:47] of the old order or creation
[1:32:50] now in union with christ i'm reading a
[1:32:52] prophet he has become the new creation
[1:32:55] of god
[1:32:56] hallelujah ephesians 2 10 4 we are his
[1:32:59] workmanship
[1:33:00] created in union with christ jesus unto
[1:33:03] good works ephesians 4 24 and that he
[1:33:06] put on the new man which after god is
[1:33:09] created in righteousness and true
[1:33:11] holiness this new creation listen to the
[1:33:14] prophet is not the old creation made
[1:33:16] over
[1:33:18] or it could not be called a new creation
[1:33:21] this is exactly what it says it is it is
[1:33:24] a new creation it is another creation
[1:33:27] distinct from the old one
[1:33:29] no longer is he dealing by ways of the
[1:33:32] flesh
[1:33:33] hallelujah that was how he dealt with
[1:33:35] israel he chose abraham and of abraham's
[1:33:38] issue through the godly isaac line but
[1:33:40] now out of every kindred tribe a nation
[1:33:44] he has purposed a new creation
[1:33:46] is this what you're looking for is this
[1:33:48] what you're hoping for is this what you
[1:33:50] need in your life he is the first of
[1:33:52] that creation he was god created in the
[1:33:55] form of man but now by his spirit he is
[1:33:59] creating many sons unto himself god the
[1:34:03] creator creating himself a part of his
[1:34:06] creation this is the true revelation of
[1:34:09] god this was his purpose
[1:34:12] oh somebody give the lord a shout of
[1:34:14] praise
[1:34:16] and this purpose better brandon said
[1:34:18] took form through election
[1:34:21] that is why i'm reading he can look
[1:34:24] right down to the last age when all
[1:34:26] would be over and see himself still in
[1:34:30] the midst of the church as author of
[1:34:32] this new creation of god friends if he
[1:34:35] is the author and he's the one writing
[1:34:37] this new creation and he put my name
[1:34:39] down as part of this new creation no
[1:34:42] devil no demon no situation my mistakes
[1:34:45] my past my failures nothing past nothing
[1:34:48] present nothing to come could change
[1:34:51] this fact because he is the author of
[1:34:54] this creation of god
[1:34:56] [Applause]
[1:35:00] his sovereign power brought it to pass
[1:35:02] by his own decree he elected the members
[1:35:06] of this new creation you hear but the
[1:35:08] words the prophet said by his decree
[1:35:10] when a king or a lawmaker makes a decree
[1:35:13] it is settled you know i decree
[1:35:16] hallelujah that you are in this body i
[1:35:19] decree that you're gonna be a church
[1:35:21] without spot or wrinkle i decree sin
[1:35:24] will not be able to live in your members
[1:35:26] i decree that you are going to overcome
[1:35:28] i decree you're going to be in the
[1:35:30] rapture
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:33] but a man said by his own decree he
[1:35:36] elected the members of this new creation
[1:35:40] so i don't care if they're outside the
[1:35:42] church right now i don't care if they're
[1:35:44] backslidden right now i don't care if
[1:35:46] they're drunk somewhere i don't care if
[1:35:48] they don't want to hear about god they
[1:35:50] don't want to hear about church if god
[1:35:52] has decreed brother you that they are
[1:35:54] part of this new creation
[1:35:56] the devil has no power to even stop
[1:36:00] what god has decreed and declared to be
[1:36:02] made manifest it is going to come to
[1:36:04] pass
[1:36:05] there's a cow now that's going on
[1:36:08] hallelujah the clock is running because
[1:36:10] when the god decrees he sets a time he
[1:36:13] sets an appointed time he sets an
[1:36:15] appointed season i will return unto you
[1:36:17] according to the time of life
[1:36:20] and that promise
[1:36:22] for you and your family will be made
[1:36:24] manifest
[1:36:26] hallelujah by his own decree
[1:36:29] he elected the members of this new
[1:36:32] creation he predestinated them to the
[1:36:35] adoption of children according to the
[1:36:37] good pleasure of his will
[1:36:41] by his omniscience and omnipotence he
[1:36:44] brought it to pass
[1:36:46] time and time again god has never lost
[1:36:48] one you know
[1:36:52] god has never lost one
[1:36:54] never ever ever ever ever lost one
[1:36:57] hallelujah in every age he found a way
[1:36:59] he made a way he created a way he opened
[1:37:02] the door hallelujah my god don't help me
[1:37:05] oh somebody help me
[1:37:07] her in every age no matter the situation
[1:37:10] hallelujah and god had a way of bringing
[1:37:12] things together to work out hallelujah
[1:37:15] god could have destroyed the whole of
[1:37:17] jericho
[1:37:18] but there was a lady named rahab
[1:37:21] who was a prostitute who he needed for
[1:37:24] his long-term plan
[1:37:26] god could do what he wanted sovereign
[1:37:28] so he organized it that those spies that
[1:37:31] he sent had to go and meet rehab and
[1:37:34] they told rehab when we come back just
[1:37:36] hang this cord outside of your house and
[1:37:39] bring your family into this place
[1:37:41] hallelujah because god has a work for
[1:37:44] you rahab don't know what about to
[1:37:46] happen she don't know her destiny she
[1:37:48] don't know her part to play
[1:37:51] or somebody help me
[1:37:53] hallelujah but because she was on the
[1:37:56] book because she was written in the plan
[1:37:59] because she was known by the author
[1:38:02] hallelujah and the author knows how to
[1:38:04] write the story do you understand that
[1:38:06] the author writes and however you write
[1:38:08] it don't ever change from how he writes
[1:38:10] it oh come on somebody help me this
[1:38:12] morning hallelujah he knew what day you
[1:38:15] were going to be born you may be seated
[1:38:21] rahab didn't know she was going to marry
[1:38:22] one of joshua's officers
[1:38:24] and out of that line was going to lead
[1:38:26] all the way to ober to jesse to david a
[1:38:29] prostitute in jericho hallelujah god
[1:38:32] could have done anything and he could
[1:38:33] have chosen anybody but he wanted rehab
[1:38:36] because that's how we wrote the story
[1:38:38] and god is all about this story it's the
[1:38:40] best story that you could ever write is
[1:38:43] the best story you could ever tell and
[1:38:45] it's the only story that we know the end
[1:38:47] and we know the beginning we oh come on
[1:38:49] now come on now hallelujah we know how
[1:38:51] this story ends and that's why satan is
[1:38:54] so mad
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:38:56] because we can have confidence that we
[1:38:59] shall reign on this earth

[1:39:07] you realize that god already see you
[1:39:09] delivered and transformed god already
[1:39:12] see this take place you know
[1:39:14] when god looking at rahab he really
[1:39:16] seeing jesus you know
[1:39:18] because out of the aligner david house
[1:39:21] was jesus you know and every rahab
[1:39:23] wasn't sorted out in her prostitute
[1:39:25] condition
[1:39:28] and just think about it friends i
[1:39:29] preached this before gorkada chose a
[1:39:31] nice little sister
[1:39:34] but he find rehab
[1:39:37] how he can figure out god
[1:39:39] but but god why you choose do you hear
[1:39:42] read read rehab resume it
[1:39:46] oh you could do that
[1:39:47] i said thank god that it wasn't us
[1:39:49] because i make rehab go to all kind of
[1:39:51] things
[1:39:58] god had to be working on all sides
[1:39:59] because joshua blessed the marriage of
[1:40:01] rahab and one of his lieutenants
[1:40:04] and out of that marriage
[1:40:05] no time they open and jesse and
[1:40:08] they don't even know what is happening
[1:40:10] but god already unfolding
[1:40:12] and you don't even know how much
[1:40:13] generations
[1:40:15] gone past that god really thinking about
[1:40:17] you you know
[1:40:19] your great great great great great great
[1:40:22] great great great great great great
[1:40:24] grandfather somewhere doing something do
[1:40:27] something and you don't even know when
[1:40:29] god moved them there somewhere in the
[1:40:31] world it's really you he was getting at
[1:40:33] you know
[1:40:36] you will never know the whole story
[1:40:39] hallelujah and that's why we have we
[1:40:41] will have things to talk about when we
[1:40:43] get to the other side because you don't
[1:40:45] know the story of how i got here oh come
[1:40:49] on now but it's the author because he
[1:40:51] know every piece of the story
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:56] we can look back in scripture and make
[1:40:59] sense out of it because we can look back
[1:41:04] but at the point in time when these
[1:41:06] people were living their lives out they
[1:41:08] had no idea what was happening but they
[1:41:12] were walking by fate and they were
[1:41:13] listening to that still small voice and
[1:41:16] for abraham he was seeking a city whose
[1:41:19] builder and maker was god his was
[1:41:21] seeking things that were above he had
[1:41:23] cattle he had family he had situation
[1:41:26] even how he dealt with his with his
[1:41:28] nephew lot spoke to his focus on things
[1:41:31] above because he said listen lot don't
[1:41:33] let your men and my men fight i really
[1:41:36] trying to seek the things above i keep
[1:41:38] getting interrupted with all these
[1:41:40] stories about my men and your men
[1:41:42] fighting you pick east-west notes out
[1:41:44] and take your people and go you're going
[1:41:46] with my blessing because i too focus on
[1:41:48] things above to get interrupted with
[1:41:50] this argument every tuesday morning
[1:41:52] every thursday morning
[1:41:55] and lot goes his way
[1:41:57] and abraham is focused on things above
[1:42:00] and it's because he is focusing things
[1:42:02] above
[1:42:03] when god comes and visit him and say how
[1:42:05] shall i hide from myself on abraham what
[1:42:08] i'm about to do hallelujah i have a man
[1:42:11] on the earth who seeking things above
[1:42:13] and because you're on the earth i'm not
[1:42:15] going to do anything without talking to
[1:42:16] you so i'm letting you know about to go
[1:42:18] down to sodom and bring judgment to
[1:42:20] sodom because if anybody look into
[1:42:22] things above is you so i letting you
[1:42:24] know before i had a time whatsoever to
[1:42:26] happen and because abraham's heart
[1:42:29] was not done why not do that boy that
[1:42:31] was real stupid on him and no he was
[1:42:34] that was in he had any family no he said
[1:42:36] lord if brad mentioned my ass your
[1:42:37] wanting
[1:42:41] and when you read the scriptures it's as
[1:42:42] if it's as if iran is coming across i
[1:42:45] don't want to step above my bones eh but
[1:42:47] let me ask you if it would have 50
[1:42:49] righteous
[1:42:50] would you would you spare them
[1:42:53] and god say well yes you say well
[1:42:55] overstepped my bones every time dirty
[1:42:57] right just would you
[1:42:59] what what it was in abraham's heart
[1:43:03] to forgive to love to see just to see
[1:43:06] reconciliation to see his family in
[1:43:08] order he said good for autumn
[1:43:12] i told him to keep praying no no no no
[1:43:14] he said he's hyper adventure
[1:43:19] because he's seeking things that are
[1:43:20] above
[1:43:21] you can't be seeking around buff and
[1:43:23] you're walking around grumpy and sad
[1:43:27] you have to look up your redemptions
[1:43:28] right now you know
[1:43:29] i don't care what's happening around you
[1:43:31] you're supposed to be the happiest
[1:43:32] people but the man says so you supposed
[1:43:34] to be happy as you're gonna face idiots

[1:43:44] smile

[1:43:48] every day a bigger bigger smile
[1:43:50] every day you're getting happier because
[1:43:52] you know your redemption draenei
[1:43:54] you're looking up because you know your
[1:43:55] redemption right now every service
[1:43:57] you're looking up
[1:44:01] anybody feeling fine
[1:44:03] could you take a little more i am on ph
[1:44:05] one
[1:44:06] pretty much of this message this morning
[1:44:09] but if you are you enjoying the word
[1:44:13] are you being challenged to reprogram
[1:44:16] your life
[1:44:22] friends it comes back to decisions and
[1:44:24] choices you know
[1:44:26] decisions and choices this whole message
[1:44:29] this whole gospel is about choices you
[1:44:30] know jesus said come follow me and those
[1:44:33] who he called had a choice
[1:44:36] they had a choice
[1:44:38] you gonna stand do what you're doing or
[1:44:39] i cannot follow
[1:44:41] but thank god they made the right choice
[1:44:43] you know life and your whole life is
[1:44:45] about decisions
[1:44:49] your decisions in life to this point is
[1:44:51] why you are where you are in every area
[1:44:53] of your life
[1:44:55] there are people who save
[1:44:57] consistently a small amount of money and
[1:44:58] when they look is the product of the
[1:45:00] decision to make that that's that one
[1:45:02] decision and people who consistently
[1:45:04] support kfc
[1:45:07] consistent
[1:45:11] whatever you do you are the sum total of
[1:45:13] all the decisions you know
[1:45:17] decision to maintain relationships and
[1:45:19] friendships and phone calls and contact
[1:45:21] and support
[1:45:23] decisions
[1:45:27] and that's why you can't look at anybody
[1:45:28] in any kind of way you know because
[1:45:30] everybody is responsible for their
[1:45:31] decisions
[1:45:33] the real question is
[1:45:34] isn't it time you made better decisions
[1:45:39] isn't it time you made better choices
[1:45:42] the bible said choose you this day whom
[1:45:44] you will serve
[1:45:49] but rather you're hot or you're cold
[1:45:52] rather your heart or your cold but you
[1:45:53] see that warm in between thing all that
[1:45:56] is a choice
[1:45:57] you could choose to be hot or you could
[1:45:59] choose to be cool
[1:46:01] god isn't saying i will set how you
[1:46:03] behave for you no what are you going to
[1:46:05] choose
[1:46:08] and it shakes me to my core how much of
[1:46:12] this journey
[1:46:13] god keeps to himself and how much he
[1:46:15] leaves to us in our daily living
[1:46:20] of what we make important
[1:46:23] years ago
[1:46:24] so many young people here might remember
[1:46:26] when i preached a new service i saw all
[1:46:27] this speech about opportunity cost
[1:46:30] an opportunity cost is what you give up
[1:46:32] to do anything else
[1:46:35] so you have one hour and you have two
[1:46:37] choices
[1:46:38] if you're in school you could take that
[1:46:40] one hour to study your schoolwork or it
[1:46:42] could be one hour to go and play
[1:46:43] football it is your choice yes
[1:46:46] i am saying don't play football
[1:46:48] and i'm not saying study every single
[1:46:49] hour of the day but it is your choice
[1:46:52] the outcome that you get after that
[1:46:55] decision made over and over and over and
[1:46:58] over again equals the result you're
[1:47:00] going to get
[1:47:03] because for everybody you say my parent
[1:47:05] held me to study there's somebody who
[1:47:07] had no parents at all who study
[1:47:10] for somebody who said i had no
[1:47:11] electricity study there's somebody with
[1:47:13] no legacy do you have a scholarship
[1:47:18] that's it for everybody who has an
[1:47:19] excuse about something there's somebody
[1:47:21] else with the exact same situation or
[1:47:23] worse who made up their minds to do
[1:47:26] something about it
[1:47:30] how many orphans became extremely
[1:47:32] successful at business they had no
[1:47:34] mentor they had no person they went
[1:47:36] through the orphanage and they struggled
[1:47:37] through life but they made a list they
[1:47:39] might say i am not going to have to be
[1:47:41] depend and they made a choice
[1:47:46] a few years ago in brazil or something
[1:47:48] there's a young boy caught in a picture
[1:47:50] studying under a street light
[1:47:53] it went worldwide one of the magazines
[1:47:55] picked it up because he said he had no
[1:47:57] electricity at home
[1:47:59] and while people could be sitting on and
[1:48:01] complaining about it something within
[1:48:03] him whatever it was led him to sitting
[1:48:05] on the street light and study
[1:48:08] what is different about him and somebody
[1:48:09] else who accept the situation say well i
[1:48:11] have no current you know
[1:48:14] and how is that as much in a natural as
[1:48:17] amount in the spiritual
[1:48:20] how much complaining so i want to
[1:48:22] challenge you i've preached before stop
[1:48:23] complaining
[1:48:25] find a solution
[1:48:26] find a way
[1:48:28] make a way
[1:48:33] god put man on the earth to have
[1:48:35] dominion
[1:48:37] god will come in the cooler the evening
[1:48:38] to find out what adam did
[1:48:41] but adam had a choice of what he named
[1:48:43] what he did during the day and he had to
[1:48:45] figure it out
[1:48:48] and life as a journey in the natural and
[1:48:51] in his spiritual is figuring it out
[1:48:54] and we have no excuse because all of the
[1:48:57] information is there in the bible in the
[1:48:59] revealed world and test there's courses
[1:49:01] on everything else
[1:49:03] you can't cook you could learn
[1:49:09] i could tell i could make some of the
[1:49:10] best meals on the planet
[1:49:13] if you give me the recipe
[1:49:19] i could challenge the best chefs
[1:49:22] just give me the recipe
[1:49:24] give me their secret ingredients huh
[1:49:27] tell me what you love with herbs and
[1:49:28] spices the secret ones huh
[1:49:31] and i could challenge anybody if you
[1:49:33] know the formula
[1:49:38] if you're doing the formula you could do
[1:49:39] anything you know
[1:49:40] if you could follow instructions and i
[1:49:42] might tell you do this do this do this
[1:49:44] do this do this do this do this you'll
[1:49:46] be able to build x y and z
[1:49:53] and friends you don't have to remember
[1:49:54] everything you know you just have to
[1:49:55] understand how to follow instructions
[1:49:57] because that's what a recipe is i can't
[1:49:59] remember every recipe you speak to
[1:50:00] anybody you can't remember every single
[1:50:02] recipe but as we have a recipe book
[1:50:04] maybe it's your grammar book maybe it's
[1:50:05] your mother book we have a book and you
[1:50:06] follow because you know that things how
[1:50:08] much essence and make sure it's just so
[1:50:10] much essence and it's make sure to add
[1:50:12] this only in at this time
[1:50:16] the skill you are displaying is the
[1:50:18] ability to read and follow instructions
[1:50:22] as he's saying what he wanted though if
[1:50:24] you're meditating on this word day and
[1:50:26] night and you keep going through this
[1:50:27] word and you look in this word for
[1:50:29] solutions to your situations and you
[1:50:31] follow it step by step by step when you
[1:50:33] need a recipe to deal with your children
[1:50:35] go to the word and find the recipe
[1:50:41] that's what the bible is as a guide
[1:50:44] simple but i am really big on living
[1:50:47] life as a christian i'm not hearing word
[1:50:49] word word and can't translate this thing
[1:50:51] into dealing with your boss and in
[1:50:53] situations on your neighbor and you're a
[1:50:54] christian any message you know but you
[1:50:56] and your neighbor arguing it out shout
[1:50:57] out to the top of your lungs
[1:50:59] that can't be christianity to me
[1:51:01] there has to be a better way
[1:51:03] there has to be a way to live that
[1:51:04] people say no that is christ
[1:51:07] that's christ living out of there
[1:51:11] i challenge you friends your neighbors
[1:51:13] must know you're a christian i'm not
[1:51:14] saying you're you're you're taking abuse
[1:51:16] so you're taking no no but they must
[1:51:17] know you're you're christian
[1:51:19] because you're flying higher
[1:51:20] you're not caught up in these things can
[1:51:22] the church take some more
[1:51:26] this purpose took form through election
[1:51:28] that is why he could look right down to
[1:51:30] the last age when all would be over and
[1:51:33] see himself still in the midst of the
[1:51:36] church as author of this new creation of
[1:51:38] god his sovereign power brought to the
[1:51:40] past by his own decree he elected the
[1:51:44] members of this new creation he
[1:51:45] predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:51:48] children according to the good pleasure
[1:51:50] of his will by his omniscience
[1:51:53] that's all knowing and omnipotence
[1:51:56] that's all power he brought it to pass
[1:51:59] how else could he know that he would be
[1:52:01] standing in the midst of the church
[1:52:02] receiving glory from his bridges if he
[1:52:05] did not make sure that's brother branham
[1:52:08] all things he knew and all things he
[1:52:11] worked out
[1:52:13] according to what he knew in order that
[1:52:15] his purpose and good pleasure be brought
[1:52:18] to pass
[1:52:20] ephesians 1 11 in whom also we have
[1:52:21] obtained an inheritance being
[1:52:23] predestined according to the purpose of
[1:52:25] him who work in all things after the
[1:52:27] council of his own will aren't you glad
[1:52:30] that you belong to him can the church
[1:52:32] say amen
[1:52:36] hallelujah i'm not going to be too much
[1:52:37] longer with you
[1:52:39] in the message feature home of the
[1:52:40] heavenly bridegroom
[1:52:42] and the earthly bride i'll be changed
[1:52:44] from this creature that i am when that
[1:52:46] day comes
[1:52:48] from going to that city i'm bound for
[1:52:50] that beautiful city i feel the redeeming
[1:52:53] power in my whole heart now if this
[1:52:56] isn't so then i've throwed my life away
[1:52:59] i've taught others this suitful thing
[1:53:01] but when i look down and see that the
[1:53:03] promise he made of this day and see it
[1:53:05] vindicated and look at this 1500 mile
[1:53:08] square congregation set here an elect
[1:53:11] that's been called from the nominations
[1:53:13] and races and creeds and things gathered
[1:53:15] together as i see the word vindicating
[1:53:17] itself i know beyond one shadow of a
[1:53:20] doubt the jewels of my crown will
[1:53:23] outshine everything in the world at that
[1:53:25] day
[1:53:27] there will come a time people we're not
[1:53:29] gathering here foreign we're only
[1:53:31] waiting for that time it is very very
[1:53:33] late but jesus is still very very near
[1:53:36] and his glory it's wonderful his name
[1:53:39] shall be called counselor hallelujah oh
[1:53:42] blessed be the name of the lord you
[1:53:45] appreciate the lord this morning
[1:53:47] oh hallelujah john in revelation 4. he
[1:53:49] said after this i looked and behold a
[1:53:51] door was open in heaven and the first
[1:53:53] voice which i heard was as it were of a
[1:53:56] trumpet talking with me which said come
[1:53:58] up hither and i will show thee things
[1:54:00] which must be hereafter and immediately
[1:54:03] i was in the spirit and behold a throne
[1:54:04] was set in heaven and one sat on the
[1:54:07] throne friends we need to take our focus
[1:54:10] our gaze higher above the natural and
[1:54:12] simple things to look higher into that
[1:54:15] throne room to look higher into the
[1:54:17] tapestry and the plan of god to look at
[1:54:19] the unfolding of the plan of redemption
[1:54:21] to look at what john saw what paul saw
[1:54:23] what brother branham saw because we have
[1:54:25] a place reserved for us at the throne
[1:54:27] that we didn't work to get it was not by
[1:54:30] our merit but by the grace of god he
[1:54:33] allowed it to be so that we as his
[1:54:35] children could be predestinated
[1:54:37] hallelujah from before there was a world
[1:54:39] before there was a time hallelujah and
[1:54:42] although john was in prison on the isle
[1:54:44] of patmos as it were he was not looking
[1:54:47] at the situation but he was caught up
[1:54:49] looking at things above when the cry
[1:54:51] went up come up hither
[1:54:53] above your situation
[1:54:55] he could have said i'm in prison and i'm
[1:54:57] not depressed and i don't know why i
[1:54:59] hear and why me and poor me
[1:55:04] but he didn't look at his situation
[1:55:06] hallelujah he didn't look at the
[1:55:08] situation he just responded come up
[1:55:09] hither he wasn't looking at his natural
[1:55:12] imprisonment he wasn't looking at how
[1:55:14] what he was eating he wasn't looking at
[1:55:15] what he was going through yes responded
[1:55:17] to the call to come up hither and it's
[1:55:19] the same call i'm making this morning to
[1:55:22] look higher to come up here to look at
[1:55:24] your redemption to look at the promise
[1:55:26] to look at your family the way god sees
[1:55:28] your family delivered shouting
[1:55:30] worshiping having the baptism of the
[1:55:32] holy ghost and fire
[1:55:35] oh
[1:55:36] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:55:39] oh brother branham said now tonight with
[1:55:40] the fourth chapter we're leaving out now
[1:55:42] john had spoken to the laodicean church
[1:55:44] age and in this layout of cn church it
[1:55:47] was the most messed up church age of all
[1:55:49] the rest of them and we found the most
[1:55:51] pathetic thing in the last part of the
[1:55:54] laodicean church jesus standing on the
[1:55:57] outside of his own church
[1:55:59] where he had been put out
[1:56:00] knocking at the door trying to get back
[1:56:03] in is not sinful
[1:56:06] i think that's about one of the most
[1:56:07] pathetic scriptures that i've ever read
[1:56:09] jesus standing outside of his own door
[1:56:12] his church had put him out and he was
[1:56:14] trying to get back in to save them
[1:56:18] any man i will open let me back in my
[1:56:20] own house he said i stand at the door i
[1:56:22] knock you know the scripture
[1:56:24] i'll support him and he with me isn't it
[1:56:26] pathetic the god of heaven put out of
[1:56:29] his own church by their creeds and
[1:56:31] denominations the way they are doing put
[1:56:33] them out and accepted it
[1:56:35] hallelujah immediately after this on the
[1:56:37] isle of patmos how many remembers
[1:56:39] hallelujah how can anything happen to a
[1:56:43] christian without it being for the best
[1:56:45] god but the enemy is speaking about
[1:56:47] about john on the isle of patmos he says
[1:56:49] so what did god get him out there alone
[1:56:51] in the island for
[1:56:53] to give us this book of revelation see
[1:56:55] god just could pull a world over the
[1:56:57] devil's eyes sometimes so what is better
[1:57:00] what is
[1:57:00] brother branham saying here that
[1:57:02] john's whole trial on the isle of patmos
[1:57:05] was to pull wool over the devil's eyes
[1:57:08] your whole trial your situation your
[1:57:09] confusion whatever you're going through
[1:57:11] it's pulling hole over the devil's eyes
[1:57:12] you know
[1:57:13] hallelujah but everybody said i just
[1:57:15] love him because i don't have to be
[1:57:17] smart see if i had smart i tried to
[1:57:19] forget all about it because i no one
[1:57:20] could be as smart as him whatever i got
[1:57:22] i surrender myself to him just do what
[1:57:25] he says to do that's all sometimes it's
[1:57:27] very contrary to the way i think it is
[1:57:29] but i know if he's leaving it he's smart
[1:57:32] he knows what he's doing i don't so i
[1:57:34] just let him do it you see that's it
[1:57:37] hallelujah he's the one knows what he's
[1:57:39] doing so i just don't try to have any
[1:57:41] great big flowers and things i just
[1:57:43] humble myself
[1:57:45] hallelujah
[1:57:47] we're getting ready to close out now
[1:57:48] after this i looked and behold a voice
[1:57:50] was open in heaven and the first voice
[1:57:52] which i heard was as it were trumpet
[1:57:54] talking with me saying come up here and
[1:57:56] i will show these things which must be
[1:57:57] here after we're going to take it first
[1:57:59] by first i've got a lot of scriptures
[1:58:01] written down here i'm just going to
[1:58:02] touch a few of them as we close out
[1:58:04] i don't know how far we're going to get
[1:58:05] into it may the lord lead us
[1:58:07] after the church and all of this from
[1:58:09] here after now will be pertaining will
[1:58:11] take place on earth after the rapture

[1:58:36] be arrayed and fine linen and clean and
[1:58:38] white for the fine line in his
[1:58:40] righteousness of sins
[1:58:42] and he said unto me blessed that day
[1:58:44] which are called to the marriage sup of
[1:58:45] the lamb and he said unto me these are

[2:01:10] oh i just want to close out you could
[2:01:13] begin to play something softly we're
[2:01:14] just reading through this scripture in
[2:01:16] colossians
[2:01:19] not going to spend too much time on it
[2:01:20] but
[2:01:21] we read it if he be then risen with
[2:01:23] christ
[2:01:24] colossians 3 verse 1
[2:01:26] seek those things with our above where
[2:01:28] christ set it on the right hand of god
[2:01:30] set your affection on things above
[2:01:33] not on things on the earth
[2:01:39] that
[2:01:39] chapter that verse two there in the
[2:01:41] amplified set your mind you know i i use
[2:01:44] the reference of using like a microwave
[2:01:46] and you're programming you're setting it
[2:01:48] in the am device has set your mind and
[2:01:51] keep focus habitually
[2:01:53] so it must be a habit
[2:01:57] it must become a habit
[2:01:59] it must become something that's normal
[2:02:01] for you
[2:02:02] it is who you are is what you do
[2:02:04] prayer is what you do worship is what
[2:02:06] you do reading the word is what you do
[2:02:08] it it becomes a habit
[2:02:10] set your mind and keep focused
[2:02:12] habitually on the things above the
[2:02:14] heavenly things not on things that are
[2:02:17] on the earth which have only temporal
[2:02:20] value
[2:02:22] for you are dead and your life is hidden
[2:02:24] with christ in god
[2:02:27] in the amplified for you die to this
[2:02:29] world and your new real life
[2:02:33] friends there's a real life you know
[2:02:37] your whole life is on the real one
[2:02:39] but only when you die out to the old
[2:02:41] life you can have a real life
[2:02:45] is hidden with christ in god
[2:02:48] chapter four when christ who is our life
[2:02:51] shall appear
[2:02:52] then shall you also appear with him and
[2:02:54] glory
[2:02:55] and paul is now billion mortified here
[2:02:58] for your members i've taught this in
[2:03:00] bible study mortified this is on you
[2:03:04] in seeking the things that are above
[2:03:06] this is all part of that teaching
[2:03:08] mortified therefore your members which
[2:03:11] are upon the earth
[2:03:15] which in the amplified so put to death
[2:03:17] and deprive of power
[2:03:19] the evil longings of your earthly body
[2:03:23] that's a choice that you make
[2:03:27] to kill it
[2:03:30] put the debt and deprive of power the
[2:03:32] evil longings of your earthly body which
[2:03:35] it sends you all self-centered instincts
[2:03:39] don't tell me you're not dealing with it
[2:03:41] it's the truth of this body
[2:03:44] but to win means you make a choice to
[2:03:46] mortify
[2:03:49] or kill
[2:03:51] self-sentencing immorality impurity
[2:03:54] sinful passion evil desire and greed
[2:03:57] which is a kind of idolatry because it
[2:04:00] replaces your devotion to god
[2:04:03] how many of our young people how many
[2:04:04] people they're going they're walking
[2:04:06] they're walking they're walking walking
[2:04:07] and not realizing that it's an idol
[2:04:12] you're so exhausted you have no time to
[2:04:14] pray
[2:04:15] so exhausted you have no time to spend
[2:04:17] time thinking about god
[2:04:20] mortified there for your members which
[2:04:21] are upon the earth fornication
[2:04:24] uncleanness in order to affection evil
[2:04:27] conscience and covetousness which is
[2:04:30] idolatry for which things take the wrath
[2:04:33] of god comment on the children of
[2:04:34] disobedience so paul is saying these are
[2:04:37] the reasons these are the things because
[2:04:40] of these sinful things the divine life
[2:04:43] of god is coming on the sons of
[2:04:45] disobedience
[2:04:47] those who fear to listen
[2:04:50] to god's word
[2:04:53] greed you didn't realize greed itself is
[2:04:56] bringing judgment
[2:04:58] you say well i'm not fornicating but is
[2:04:59] there greed
[2:05:01] and when you look at your life you're so
[2:05:03] trying to
[2:05:04] succeed and accomplish and acquire and
[2:05:06] grieve is what has eaten you up
[2:05:09] anything that replaces your devotion to
[2:05:12] god
[2:05:13] friends set
[2:05:16] your affection
[2:05:18] on things above seek those things that
[2:05:21] are above
[2:05:23] verse 8
[2:05:25] but now he also
[2:05:27] so beyond these things that paul speaks
[2:05:29] about
[2:05:30] put off all these
[2:05:33] anger are you an angry christian
[2:05:38] you find myself always upset you're
[2:05:39] always angry just angry
[2:05:44] are you ready to put it off
[2:05:46] and drop that anger
[2:05:49] sitting in a message for years ago and
[2:05:51] angry
[2:05:52] angry at your parents angry at whatever
[2:05:55] angry at your boss angry at your job
[2:05:57] angry at your past
[2:06:00] put off these things you can't carry it
[2:06:02] with you you know friends
[2:06:04] put it off
[2:06:06] nobody quit it off for you you know you
[2:06:08] have to choose i'm not going to be angry
[2:06:10] anymore
[2:06:12] like that song said i'm no longer a
[2:06:13] slave to fear i'm no longer sin a slave
[2:06:15] to sin i'm no longer a slave to anger
[2:06:19] friends you could know the whole message
[2:06:21] anger cannot go with you
[2:06:23] it doesn't make sense you know any
[2:06:24] message and you're carrying this anger
[2:06:25] because this anger
[2:06:27] even though you know the message will
[2:06:29] prevent you from going where you want to
[2:06:30] go
[2:06:32] so you have to put it off
[2:06:33] you're angry with your wife you're angry
[2:06:35] with your children
[2:06:37] can you let it go today
[2:06:40] can you drop the anger
[2:06:41] you say brother isaac i don't have any
[2:06:42] odds to do but of course i just upset
[2:06:44] that just angry
[2:06:46] can you let the anger just go and let
[2:06:48] that dark feeling of anger just
[2:06:51] come out your body
[2:06:53] out your mind on your heart
[2:06:55] wrath
[2:06:58] rat is rage
[2:06:59] [Music]
[2:07:00] when you lose control you get so upset
[2:07:02] that you lose control
[2:07:06] you throw stuff around the house
[2:07:10] young brother young sister you're so
[2:07:12] upset you don't understand why your
[2:07:13] parents tell you something and you break
[2:07:15] something you do something you mash up
[2:07:17] something here
[2:07:21] are you ready to live higher
[2:07:23] are you ready to seek the things which
[2:07:25] are above
[2:07:26] malice
[2:07:30] blasphemy
[2:07:32] filthy communication out of your mouth
[2:07:36] do you realize that your words that you
[2:07:38] speak
[2:07:40] will judge you
[2:07:44] your very words is what will judge you
[2:07:49] friends
[2:07:50] put it off
[2:07:53] lying not one to another
[2:07:55] seeing that you have put off the old man
[2:07:58] with his deeds
[2:08:04] you remember the time brother branham
[2:08:06] was coming over the border into the u.s
[2:08:09] and he had access children and yeah at
[2:08:11] the customs border they asked him if he
[2:08:13] had something and not so whatever it was
[2:08:15] i can't remember what it was
[2:08:16] and to the best of his knowledge he knew
[2:08:19] he didn't have it
[2:08:22] not realizing one of his children had it
[2:08:25] and on the way driving
[2:08:27] when he was a witner but you made me
[2:08:29] tell them at the border we didn't have
[2:08:31] it
[2:08:32] but random turn around his car
[2:08:35] and that wasn't a christianity
[2:08:36] documentary
[2:08:38] that that was a border you know
[2:08:40] but because your words have such power
[2:08:44] it was not deliberate lie
[2:08:47] but it was not true
[2:08:49] brother branham wanted it corrected
[2:08:52] and here paul is speaking to believers
[2:08:54] because this whole scripture here is the
[2:08:56] you know how it started if he began
[2:08:58] rising with christ this is the believers
[2:09:01] and now paul is finding himself coming
[2:09:03] back to believers
[2:09:06] lying not one to another
[2:09:08] seeing seeing that you have put off the
[2:09:11] old man with his deeds
[2:09:14] if this thing be true that you have
[2:09:16] really put the old man away
[2:09:19] make sure and put a witty lion
[2:09:21] and i've put on a new man which is
[2:09:24] renewed in knowledge
[2:09:27] like this service this morning is
[2:09:28] renewing your knowledge renew their
[2:09:30] knowledge after the image of him that
[2:09:32] created him where there is neither greek
[2:09:34] nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision
[2:09:38] barbarian skitty and bond nor free but
[2:09:40] christ is all and in all
[2:09:44] put on therefore as the elect of god so
[2:09:47] paul is saying put off certain things
[2:09:49] and now put on certain things
[2:09:53] as brother branham when he was preaching
[2:09:54] and put on the whole armor of god he
[2:09:56] said you have to take off your stuff
[2:09:59] to put on the armor
[2:10:01] don't try to put the armor on on top of
[2:10:03] your stuff
[2:10:05] so if you're putting off these things
[2:10:06] then let me tell you what to replace it
[2:10:08] with
[2:10:09] put on therefore as the elect of god how
[2:10:12] many are identified with the elect of
[2:10:14] god you
[2:10:17] put on therefore as the elect of god
[2:10:20] holy and beloved bowels of mercies
[2:10:25] kindness
[2:10:26] humbleness of mind
[2:10:28] meekness
[2:10:30] long-suffering
[2:10:31] for bearing one another
[2:10:33] and forgiving one another if
[2:10:36] any man have a quarrel against any even
[2:10:39] as christ forgave you
[2:10:43] also so also do ye
[2:10:46] and above all these things put on
[2:10:47] charity which is the bond of perfectness
[2:10:51] and let the peace of god rule in your
[2:10:54] hearts to the witch also you are calling
[2:10:57] one body and be thankful
[2:11:00] so paul this is a powerful message paul
[2:11:03] is preaching in is one chapter you know
[2:11:05] he's telling you what to take off what
[2:11:07] to put on how to treat one another how
[2:11:09] to be how to live how to act let the
[2:11:12] peace of god rule in your heart what's
[2:11:14] ruling in your heart
[2:11:17] be thankful are you thankful
[2:11:20] let the word of christ dwell in you
[2:11:21] richly in all wisdom teaching and
[2:11:24] admonishing one another in psalms and
[2:11:26] hymns and spiritual songs that's why we
[2:11:28] have our worship and our song services
[2:11:30] and these things
[2:11:33] singing with the grace in your heart to
[2:11:35] the lord and whatsoever you do in word
[2:11:38] or deed whatsoever you do
[2:11:40] on your job in your school to your
[2:11:42] family whatever you do in word or deed
[2:11:45] in what you say or in your action do all
[2:11:48] in the name of the lord jesus
[2:11:51] can you do everything in the name of the
[2:11:53] lord
[2:11:54] then it makes you really think of what
[2:11:55] you're doing right makes you think of
[2:11:57] what you're saying because you have to
[2:11:58] do it in the name of the lord
[2:12:00] giving thanks to god and the father by
[2:12:02] him why submit yourselves unto your
[2:12:05] husbands
[2:12:06] as it is fit in the lord
[2:12:09] husbands love your wives and be not
[2:12:11] bitter against them
[2:12:13] children obey your parents in all things
[2:12:16] for this is well pleasing unto the lord
[2:12:20] is a gospel here in this one chapter for
[2:12:22] everybody
[2:12:23] fathers provoke not your children to
[2:12:25] anger lest they be discouraged
[2:12:29] servants obey and all things your
[2:12:30] masters according to the flesh not with
[2:12:33] eye service as men pleasers but in
[2:12:36] singleness of heart fear in god
[2:12:38] and whatsoever you do do it heartily as
[2:12:41] to the lord and not unto men
[2:12:43] knowing that of the lord you shall
[2:12:45] receive the reward of the inheritance so
[2:12:47] you're not working on your job and
[2:12:49] you're a christian and you're working
[2:12:50] and you're working with a man that is
[2:12:51] against scripture
[2:12:53] you're under the man walk
[2:12:55] that's not scripture
[2:12:57] whatever you do do it unto the lord
[2:12:58] knowing the lord will give you your
[2:13:00] inheritance
[2:13:03] hallelujah
[2:13:06] for he served the lord christ but he
[2:13:07] that do it wrong shall receive for the
[2:13:09] wrong which he had done and there is no
[2:13:11] respect of prisons may the lord have a
[2:13:13] blessing to the reading of his word
[2:13:15] shall we bow our heads a word of prayer
[2:13:18] heavenly father this simple message this
[2:13:19] morning
[2:13:20] lord and to seek those things which are
[2:13:23] above to remind us through your word and
[2:13:26] to your scripture and to your prophet's
[2:13:27] message and true lord these words of
[2:13:29] encouragement that we have to climb so
[2:13:32] high that these petty things can't go
[2:13:34] with us
[2:13:35] lord help us to break past the sound
[2:13:37] barriers in our lives
[2:13:39] lord and to realize that we have much
[2:13:42] more room to climb and much more land to
[2:13:44] be taken and father may you bless your
[2:13:47] people
[2:13:48] lord and may you touch each one those
[2:13:50] that are here those that are online in
[2:13:52] the precious name of jesus christ amen
[2:13:55] and amen may the lord richie bless you
[2:14:05] [Music]
[2:14:07] hallelujah thank you jesus
