saturday this morning thank you brother until amen the song service and amen and amen just give the lord a shout in the house amen amen amen oh glory shall i get to the bibles this morning to three portion of scriptures revelation chapter want 13 read from verse 7 to 12. revelation chapter 7 i want to read from verse 1 to 4 and matthew chapter 26 we want to read from verse 53 to 56. revelation 13 verse 7 speaking about the beast and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations and all the dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man had an ear let him hear he that leadeth unto captivity shall go into captivity he that kill it with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the fate of the saints and i beheld another beast coming out of the earth he had two horns like a lamb and he speak as a dragon and he exercises all the power of the first beast before him and causes the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed revelation chapter 7 we didn't want to fall and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and i saw another angel ascended from the east having the seal of the living god and requiring a lord voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saiyan hood not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads and was for the first part and i heard the number of them which was sealed matthew chapter 25 18 53 matthew chapter 26 rather want to read verse 53 to 56. this is jesus this is judas coming to kiss him to identify who he was to the high priest and so on verse 53 jesus speaking to them think as though i cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than 12 legion of angels but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled for thus it must be in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes i come out as against a thief with swords and staffs to take me i sat daily with you teaching in the temple and you laid no hold on me but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples forsook him and fled let us pray father we thank you for those scriptures the bread of life that we come to feed on god this word is food for our souls feed us the bread of life for you said man shall not live my bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of god feed us from your mouth lord we want to hear only thus saith the lord we come for bread this morning you said i am the living bread that come down from heaven and if a man eat of this bread he shall not die may we feast on the unfeeling body word of the son of man may we feel so much till our cup run over father may you strengthen the inner man take away fears and doubt reason unbelief break bands of wickedness break the chain hole of hell upon the lead lives of people here father god break canality break unbelief break the natural living day-to-day you said they eat the drunk they build their soul they got married but lord god that they love end up get out fire fell god help us to come out of the ordinary and to break into the supernatural anoint the people with the faith this morning lord it looked like silent it looked like things nothing seemed to be moving but lord the scriptures is being fulfilled have your own way and speak to our hearts and maybe not leave it the same way we came but may you so inspire our hearts and our lives that we will do something about what we have been hearing in jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise god and worship the lord oh glory to god oh it's good to be here this morning i feel the anointing of god i feel his spirit here this morning and that's that's the most important thing that's the most important thing if we have two words to speak but the spirit is here to witness those words to your soul that's the most important thing oh hallelujah oh my that song here i might a worship that was really something here am i to bow down to say that i am your god that you are my god oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord that's what we come to do friends so worship the lord and to receive of his spirit and to soak in and to be blessed amen i have a strange title this morning but the title is that the scriptures might be fulfilled as a title that the scriptures might be fulfilled of a subject every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that is what we must live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and i have an inspiration it's up to us to see that all god's righteousness is fulfilled bear in mind the holy spirit told the prophet when he said pick up a pen and write he said by and through the brain will be fulfilled all that was written by and through the bride amen i say get by and true the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you love of god jesus confronted by people he fellowship with talk with help bless strengthen heal and touch and on that night he had to say come to me like thieves i was there teaching you i was there encouraging you why you come like that he said but this happened that the scriptures might be fulfilled and you have to begin to understand that everything has to do with scripture being fulfilled isn't that right and the inspiration is up to us to see all god's righteousness is fulfilled that come of the scripture matthew 3 when then come at jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of john and john forbade him and said i have need to be baptized of thee cometh down to me and jesus said suffer that to be so but it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness so even though john could have been baptized by jesus jesus submitted himself that the scriptures might be fulfilled o blessed be the name of the lord so god will judge the world by jesus christ the word isn't that right and he says he will judge the church by their attitude towards christ who is the word you see the challenge today is people making their own gods and they're worshiping that's why god cursed that that you make a god of your own hand you can make a god of your own imagination you could paint your own god and have your own god that you know you have to hear the pastor or hear the scriptures or hear anything you have your own god and you do things according to what you like and what you feel and what you feel and what you feel and what come to you that's what you think but that's not god god is the word and god have a mouth and god does speak and that's why jesus said man shall live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded from where from some theologian no from the mouth of god and the mouth of god is his prophets so once a prophet commanders on the scene and begin to speak that is mouth of god that's why the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing don't ever forget that i want to say it again the spirit and the prophet and the pride will be saying the same thing and what they say will be already said in the word don't you forget that hallelujah hallelujah don't you forget that we are on the word this is going to be a word church nothing added nothing taken away no funny business no funny idea no opinion i'm not here to project myself i'm not here to project the church i'm here to project the word christ jesus we have no man to raise up we have no man to build up we have no man to promote we don't have that inside of him there's only one man we have to worship and that's the lord jesus christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever brother branham said i did not come to make another denomination i came to bring individuals into the statue of a perfect man come and give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god hallelujah praise the name of the lord oh praise god praise god hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord supreme say here in harvest time god word runs in continuity continuity god always does everything he does on the same scale he decides at the beginning when man lost his fellowship with him he would save him by the shed blood of the innocent one and he has never changed this method we try to educate them into it denominate them into it beg them into it beat them into it shout them into it and it still remains the same it's under the shed blood so nobody can beat the people into it shove them into air bet them into it legalize them into earth grace them into it they can't do it it is simply the shed blood that's why there is a poet a murderer this a that and a man after god's own heart because it's the shed blood he come to redeem those names in the book i don't care if they are prostitute drug addicts i homemongers liars i don't care what they are what condition they are he came to redeem those names in the book and they will be redeemed come on anybody anybody want to worship and tell you this morning glory love god hallelujah hallelujah my god hallelujah i sure you sit down many times and said why me lord what you see in me why me why me why are you still in church why i still have like something pulling me and pulling me and pulling me whine me glory to god your sin your fall your failure get back up and you say why me i will tell you why are you who he forned you he called who he called he justified and we justify already glorified glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my god oh my man you could but a man said god choose noah not because he was tall not because he was handsome not because he was good looking or whatever it is but by the grace of god he noah found grace [Applause] how do you understand what was happening you can write somebody out write somebody in put somebody in concrete free yourself this morning and worship the living god [Applause] i read a scripture all that dwell on the earth shall worship the beast you're going to find out today it's not about muslim and isis that's not the issue that's only smoking mirrors that's only a distraction it's not about them it's not about protecting the miracle from muslim man it's not that no 200 000 devils has been loosed not against muslims not against america no against the bride this battle is against the pride praise god today sunday the 13th december the 13th right and america is in revelation 13 right oh glory to god and all that dwell in the earth shall worship him the peace oh glory to god hallelujah and events are happening and things are changing and flipping around that the scriptures might be fulfilled oh come on say it man somebody you know what i said so you sit down in church this morning think you are just in church but i'm telling you scripture or god if you only know what's jumping out and popping up you will understand the battle that's in your house the battle that's in your life the backlash in your home the back that's in your mind it's a battle oh glory to god hallelujah oh come on now it's a war going on glory to god hallelujah [Applause] look we have one prophet one message and endless interpretation different groups everybody the same books [Music] it's not ten prophets no it's one it's not an american prophet uh a a a spanish prophet a french prophet a african prophet and a nigerian prophet it is one prophet god said behold i i god send you the world elijah the prophet not elijah's prophets and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers elijah said rapturing fate is laying in the messages he put it there he said that said he said this is the complete revelation of jesus christ it has nothing to add to it it don't have more action it has no fightful committee behind that every man has to go under that you're not hearing me this morning people because they find that blast in fightful and blast and kind of thing you know why i'm sick and fed up on men for reading their beef i am sick and fed up of people trying to push some man man of the oh man [Music] [Applause] you always want to manifest jesus christ with one floor he tell them he's no good this that he said you know what i'm waiting on i'm waiting on the angel of the lord he never said i'm waiting on me i am the man of the hour i am the prophet he said oh sorry he said the spirit said that i hear one they call him a prophet [Music] running for his life [Music] so quotation by the bad shakespeare how could you find that now blow your mind talk about climbing up the ladder and start very humble but when you come to the last room you head up in the air and you forget from where you come from i see evil that is working man's heart they come very humble at the bottom of the ladder and they climb in slowly but when they really laughs are wrong and they look up they go on because they have arrived that's when jesus got the spirit upon him without without measure he was led by the spirit to go to the grain sit and offer him natural if they'll be there turn these stone into bread come with the natural you get car you get hoes you get a bigger stove a bigger fridge and a large back area fenced so you got to know what pulling you you hear what i'm saying you have to know what deep is inside of you because you have to give it up all up i'm coming free you know oh yes i'm getting lighter praise less things troubling me bothering me i'm just raising up one day i just walk out just like enoch one day he was walking and was not for god took him but i said one day coming into the fine and pasta gone go say amen amen i will say amen i will say amen to that one day literally pastor calling the person before he's not even answering his phone there's a voicemail voicemail vote pastor are you preaching to stay back here to what them tribulation says you really think i want to be among them tribulation said then bunch of deadbeat people then bunch of blacks and people winning worship god wouldn't praise god wouldn't press their way wouldn't overcome nothing i want to be with them god praise god get out of here hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but i want to be among them who overcome him i want when david with me said tell me tell me give me me give me a testimony i won't say him and somebody that's that's it oh glory david let me ask you for your testimony ezekiel will be asking for the testimony [Applause] my god we got playing testimony though boy god much evil devils you overcome and you're bounced back up and you get knocked down on you get pushed and sign on your whatever it is but you keep pressing on hallelujah hallelujah oh praise god let's go a little further now we cannot make one council of churches and everybody meet they'll never work so therefore manage to emphasize this is the bride and we are the bride this is the move of god and if you're not in the movie god you're out of the move you will be out of that move watch it will never work it never did it never will that is the way why i am against that system god has got a system you heard it said today all the jesus comes together is going to be working on the churches and jesus prayed for that that we might be one no that's kind of minded without knowing the spirit jesus said that there might be one father as you and i are one not for some man to be over something it will never work we have seen that we are 40 years of example of producing man over and you know what it has not worked hallelujah one denomination wants to take over the other one man over the other one then you might be one with god like christ and god was one that's what his prayer is and he was the word and jesus prayed that we might be the word reflecting him that's when his prayer would be answered he wants us to be one with god and god is the word each individual in his heart must be one with god now he says let's go back to the beginning and when they stayed with this word and lived by this word when they broke it just one link of the chain of promises that struck them that was promised also the day you eat thereof that day you die you live by the word you live you break it you die death was a promise the day you eat that day you died so not just life was a promise that was a promise also it's not right it's not right so if god could see the suffering that children go through little nice innocent babies and people in the health and whatnot you think he couldn't say oh gosh my heart feels sorry oh god all right okay go ahead no his righteousness demanded he keep his word so they had to die who talking about his son let us make man in our image and like this that son had to die because of his word oh hallelujah so don't put no bishop over it let the holy ghost take over it the holy ghost was sent to keep the weeds and things out not what the bishop thinks or the overseers it take the holy spirit to keep that church in its condition adam had a choice at the word and live disbelieve the word and die he have given the same choice we have to be so god give us the same choice isn't that right and if god okay o praise the name of the lord it's not something you have a choice to live with that word to stay with that word i want to encourage you stay with the world listen if i try to shoot every false doctrine forced to afford an idea it's going to be will be popular we can't afford to do that we waste time just shooting all stills will be just bullets and your soul will not be fed so my job is to give you the right dollar [Applause] because they have endless machine sprinting unless people do know kind of thing like that but they train with the right money and we repent too so afterwards you just keep passing sweep their funny color convincing her these people are right that's something to check that what kind of things and as long as man is man he will find some kind of trick to do something so that i have some other body to outsmart that so they have to train them with the writing so we are here to train you with the right thing [Applause] i really don't want to comment i'm gonna gun itching for things that have that to do the hardest thing what i said there to content for the faith hold on until they have this thing coming every sunday i'm preaching the same thing we flip it we boil it we bake it we fry it whatever it is put some ketchup in it put some things on it but it's the same gospel it's the same word we have to wait [Applause] [Music] till dynamics strike okay the lord i shout hallelujah so you can't be bored and tired i'm not bored and tired hallelujah i'm excited because i'm seeing things coming into view [Applause] so can i continue now are you with me this morning ezra chapter one you don't have to find it listen now in the first day of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord by the mount of jeremiah might be fulfilled did you hear that amen in the first year of cyrus king of pleasure that the word of the lord by the mount of jeremiah might be fulfilled for that to be fulfilled god stirred up the spirit of cyrus yes king of persia amen and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it in right and sin thus saith cyrus king of persia the lord god of heaven had given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has charged me to build him you're not hearing me you're not here all of that is that the scriptures from the mouth of jeremiah to be fulfilled god stirred up this man not even a christian not even a prophet stirred up in spirit to build house of god in jerusalem what a mighty god [Applause] hallelujah glory to god everything is in channel that the scriptures might be fulfilled so he said who is there among you all of his people his god be with him let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and build the house of the lord of god of israel he is the god which is in jerusalem amen cyrus amen god stop his spirit that is scripture amen going to be fulfilled in this last day is going to draw two hats from everywhere no matter how much counterfeit and chaff the devil has god will rise up his church right out of it it will be a ceiling for a show i'm standing on this platform oh hallelujah praise god so the church of the living god has been born in the mother fanaticism and chaos she's won away to grind until she's top of the thing just waiting for wings for the flight many shall run to and fro and the people that know that god shall do export in that day god's revelation to the church little flock positionally stay where you are don't worry god is waiting and trying and pressing to get the mystery of god revealed to his church and that is what is holding back the coming of the lord and the great millennium is the great supernatural power that really lays dormant in the church you hear what the prophet said that's falling back the millennium and the coming of the lord the great supernatural power that is laying dormant in the church oh harley the great supernatural power that is laying dormant in the church but everything is for time that the scriptures might be fulfilled well matthew 2 23 and he came deeper jesus he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene oh hallelujah praise god for him to be called a nazarene he has to go into nazareth that the scripture might be fulfilled i wonder what scripture we in right now i wonder what vein we in right now i want this revelation tittiness in effect and brother branham said america is revelation to dean started out as a lamb but then stick like a dragon that's a sharp contrast from a lamb to a dragon that's a huge difference what would make a lamb comforter dragon i feel to see into the dragon oh holla the dragon has begun to speak oh hallelujah praise god praise the name of the lord and i believe and i'm seeing it that once the words start to come out the mouth things change right on me oh hallelujah so one of the politicians in america says you should take out the families of the terrorists take them out saw a clip on the internet a woman being interviewed what you think about that about killing babies and killing children of terrorists she said yes because they were grouped with big terrorists and that woman in america is saying that normal as could i get a a jar of ice cream she's saying that as normal and all you could always wow is that normal the conversation has now changed the narrative have no change yes we need to do something stop this cut that off but you know what that is about it's not about that it's about the brain oh hallelujah some of you barely want to say amen it's still about the bride whether you say amen or don't it's still about the brand it's not about protecting america it's about the war that started in genesis and about the climax in revelation it's about isaac and ishmael hallelujah praise god is why god alone abraham to go with sarah hallelujah and what's the purpose of that seed come to the end time what will it produce because every event now going forward is for scriptures to be fulfilled we have to come into opposition and i feel this morning we are doing just that oh glory to god hallelujah praise god are you with me this has to be by the word it has to be that this could have been fulfilled oh blessed be the lord matthew 4 and when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee and leaving nazareth he came and dwelled in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabalon and nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of isa saying the land of zabalan the land of naphthalene by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people that sat in there saw a great light and to them that sat in the region and shadow of that light is sprung up jesus leave from one place and go to the next place why that the scriptures might fulfill every scripture have to be fulfilled because the word is god and i'm saying this morning it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness it's up to us to fulfill what god promised in this hour you can't wait on some other church you can't wait on some other person you can't wait in your sister behind you in front of you what about you when are you gonna pick up your cross and follow jesus come on now come on now help me somebody help me what about you [Applause] no blaming no excuses don't talk about your husband i don't want to hear about it don't talk about your wife don't talk about the children don't talk about the job talk about you and your scriptures don't talk about your house but i'm already talking about all that whether i maintain my family or not let me maintain christ oh is there anybody gonna i don't care if you have no food to go back to after their service let me maintain christ [Applause] if you have to eat hard crackers and water after service let me maintain christ if the crackers still and you still have to eat it let me maintain christ if you have no crackers and you have to beg for crackers let me maintain christ friend or no friend let christ work in me church or no church wife or no wife husband or no husband let christ work in me oh lord is my prayer live or die hallelujah sing or swim go give the lord a shout in the house glory to god my my mind might be having a revival this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah glory glory hallelujah hallelujah do you understand that america was built core value of america was built on freedom of religion that's what the lamb represented that's what the lamb is about you know what the dragon is about no freedom of religion and the prophet was praying that oh how long it will leave although it will hold for that freedom of religion you better sit down sit down and start to worship the lord right now right now you better start to worship your god [Applause] [Applause] when you start to walk in the word then you could truly understand the footsteps of the righteous [Music] order by god [Applause] he will not let your foot to be moved the lord that keeper dee will not stumble or sleep [Applause] oh glory to god my god i feel i do you feel what i feel i hope you're feeling what i feel the whole day oh glory

kingdom of god as quick as you can the seal in time is on remember friend it might seem strange the religion of jesus christ was ever popular it's always been unpopular the ways of god because the devil is the prince of the power of the air he has all the governments every government is controlled by the devil so when putin say the fighting terrorists demolish terrorists you have powers and principalities higher powers just a different realm it's demon powers on this level and that level and that level and ruling one another and we just have one king general his name is jesus feister

near every man with us just joined up in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lied towards the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was cloned with linen with a writer's ink one by his side and they went in and stood beside the prison altar and the glory of the god of israel had gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house he called to the man clone with lynn which are the righteous ink on by his side and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof unto the others he said in my hearing go ye after him through the city smite let not your eyes spear neither have he pity slay utterly old and young both maids little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they begin at the ancient men which were before the house oh hallelujah is this real is this god that we're talking about receiving looking to put a mark where does i am in the message come with this where does i believe brother branham to sit down and think because they're in church and they believe a message of the hour that they are bright that everything is fine you understand what god did to jerusalem he said i bless them i do this fear i do fear but if you don't hear i will do i will increase your sins i will make a heaven like brass i will do this i will just he told him all of that this is a prayer from testimony brother branham he's praying god give us one more great revival before judgment comes granted lord we realize we are certainly wasting the balance tonight either a bum up either a blow up of a bomb or one of the greatest panics that ever struck the country have mercy bless us tonight he's talking about the vision at gotcha and how he's praying he's a either a blow up of a bomb or one of the greatest panics that ever struck the country many that stand around congregation for god made a wonder touristy go away film many critics be ashamed but it seems to be blessed i mean the sick be healed listen america this is both i say this not to individuals but to america in full your all of judgment is near hand you are just assured this nation will be judged by god if it isn't so i'm a false prophet and a liar at the pulpit just watch for it it's coming mark it in your books and say brother branham said so in the name of the lord and you're going to see that it's going to be just that way because god's bible said so the other day i made a statement to you i said if god doesn't judge this nation for its sin he is obligated to raise up son and more and apologize for sinking them certainly god is obligated he is just and honest he is true his judgments are true and god has no respect of prison we have weighed in the balance and found wanting ways in the balance the handwriting is on the wall we are the end times our eyes are blind to it so it is today the very god that america claims to serve will bring judgment upon the nation and destroy it i hope that gets so deep you'll never wiggle out of it the very one that you claim that you love and with your own man-made dogmas and immoral life and decay that you got in you away from the word of god will destroy you someday that's thus saith the lord that is what god see of the lord nothing else left for them oh my he said now the word of the bitter lamb that rose up in revelation 13 a lamb civil and the classical power but after islam freedom of religion and so forth but after a while you speak like a beast like the dragon and exercise all the power of the dragon did before him and a bitter persecution we are nearing that time amen now i want you to look at what bahrain put together he is describing america amen he was describing lamb to the dragon and listen to what he says you remember church you are living in the best day you ever will live in right now until jesus comes it will get rapidly worse and worse when russia goes down there to get that oil look out that's all she needs that's what the prophet said it would do we are ready for it then amen look at russia position today look at russia movements today they already position them themselves because the prophet saw russia making a move he said we are ready for it then and the same breath he's talking about america oh bean lamb dragon oh hallelujah someone asked me today brother branham speaking on the back of the beat don't you believe there's a tattoo or number on your head a tattoo on your hand no sir don't never look for that it will be a boycott no man could buy or sell unless it belongs to the confederation of churches there will come a union a unionizing of the thing bringing it to unionize religion mark my word it in the far off you'll see it is just around the corner and the bible speaks that united states watch come up like a lamb freedom of religion and he's break like a dragon and exercise the same power that dragon had before that's the usa our minister said to me long ago a friend of mine but the brand of gold will never let the united states fall because of the basis of our forefathers and former religion i said he let the jews show carried away they had a lot better standing than we had that's right god no respect of some generation that passed you either walk the line or you are out of the kingdom that's pretty rough but that's good for you that's the scripture oh praise the name of the lord are you with me what is a seal i see it cannot be put on anything unless it's complete the lutherans wasn't sealed the day of dispensation of grace wasn't completed they preached justification they were not sealed because it wasn't completed but the baptism of the holy ghost is the completion of the works of god oh hallelujah isn't that right praise the name of the lord so watch he said now watch what is america america was established at plymouth rock for one purpose freedom of religion the bible said she fled from the dragon had a place prepared and that what was america she come here for where she was nourished for time and a time and divided up time about 165 70 years she was prepared then this nation raised up and formed images to the beast and spoke like the beast did to the confederation of organized church religion the church is getting so she can't have a freedom no more and with the recent laws and the person is pressure on christianity isn't that right hallelujah we'll unionize the thing and make an organization open did you notice this united states is number 13 and everything established with 13 colonies little beast the lamb lamb was

the americas being full so sometimes you see god is waiting lingering because there's a there's a cup of judgment there's a couple iniquities that have to be full one is full then he acts then he responds the iniquity wasn't full yet the amorites would have to linger and wait before the exodus and when the amorites got iniquity filled to lead the people to a natural land and the iniquity of the american denomination has called themselves the church so long till the iniquities that were fulfilled there's coming an exodus there we go where god will show who is who where the church oh here we go the church itself the bride of jesus christ will be exited us out into the land that's promised oh hallelujah praise god watch now we have to go down further watch joseph there is a pharaoh who didn't know who joseph was that's right what was joseph representing the spiritual part of the spirit of exodus now look who iran types it he's talking about a pharaoh that nuna joseph listen to what he says here now there raises up now we are freedom the woman nourished for time and dividing the time talk about america but finally a fair dictator who knew not freedom of religion he typed in that as a pharaoh that knew not jesus he said we'll let it pass there will come a time where there was a fear of force had to come and there was a fear who raised up who did not know joseph oh my hallelujah and ramses was born after and ramses was the one who knew not the blessings of joseph he didn't know the spiritual side was he was only a political genius that he could take ethiopia and the rest of the countries with military might and i think if any man spiritual could see what's taking place now we are getting a pharaoh who knows not freedom of religion when our president took office he would not swear that he believed in freedom of religion this is about abandoned time but there's coming a persecution a persecution coming upon all those who won't unite with it and a boycott it'll be too late then you already took the mark you better do it now ramses was growing but remember while ramses is going into power in egypt god had moses in the wilderness he was growing too so while that power is growing there's a bride that is growing also hallelujah no longer infant bride but a mature bride a bride ready for that press to come down oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord god had a spiritual assistant do you ever say no the boat growing again it will be a showdown one of these days the time ain't far my lord hallelujah praise god had moses his prophet the enemies will propose a system and unbelief will accept it because the enemy is the intellectual sign and right in this message you have intellect and spiritual yes oh hallelujah isn't that right now remember there's only two don't forget this there are only two powers one is spiritual power of the holy spirit the other one is the devil working through intellectual power oh hallelujah bottom and quote both call in scripture but one is the holy spirit spiritual power the other is intellectual oh praise god you've seen it this morning hallelujah so there's intellectual power working in ramses to bring him into power who knows not the freedom to let joseph what joseph had done oh praise the name of the lord and we see the same thing okay hallelujah and we see the same thing an electoral power weaving among the churches is raised up to the ecclesical head that don't care what the bible said they got their own system it's not what the bible said it's what the church said and the protestants breathe right into that till all little groups well sure i know but i tell you them this is gone former godless denying the power thereof the intellectual part looks perfect it's perfect it's exactly but perfect the inspiration of satan an iron never ceased from the knees down to the end and praise god is room the deadly woman was deadly won't kill him in his head and he revived from pagan room to purple rome and they make an image unto the beast revelation chapter 13 and here we are today forming a system a system we can't wait we try everybody to become a lutheran and couldn't do it trying them to make all them baptists we couldn't do it all because methodists couldn't do it so in order to do this they have to form a consul a head an image to the beast that's exactly what they have done the crucifixion of the word again is at hand oh praise the name of the lord could you take a little more when hitler and then persecuted the jews and did the things they done under there under stalin hitler all those dictators we had the time to rehearse it to newcomers he said under the age was a bitter persecution against the jews it's been a bitter persecution against israel because it's been a time of calling them back to the atonement isn't that right praise the name of the lord notice making the people ready by the trumpets blessed being of the lord noticed in the 9th chapter 13 verse notice 200 000 horsemen born by the river euphrates was turned loose under the sixth trumpet that is not two hundred thousand national horsemen in the world that was two hundred thousand horsemen that wasn't natural horses they breed fire and breastfeed that is the roman empire being revived that have been bombed for two thousand years at the river if you were euphrates can't cross into the promised land oh blessed be the name of the lord oh praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah remember under the sixth seal every one of those matches are calling according to the word of god receive ropes because it was given to them by grace because they were blinded six million jews slaughtered and whatnot but they have been given robes because they were blinded isn't that right for us gentiles to get what we're getting right now isn't that right hallelujah praise the name of the lord oh hallelujah praise be to jesus they were given robes the reason they are is because the bible said they were blinded and they were blinded for your sake and the just god knows that they would receive it but they were made blind for your sake the bible said so praise the name of the lord praise be to jesus so watch this now is the same ungodly pagan spirit and that spirit caught into the nation of the world according to the prophecies of ezekiel and they were loosed upon the jew who know nothing of the spirit there is your mysteries hit under that seal notice these trumpets are let loose on the jews not on the gentiles the gentiles when them seal open is sealed away time is in the churches called two thousand years this spirit to the roman people the roman church watch it come down through muslim in rome the dictator as a spirit you know rome is not rome rome rome is a spirit it's a spirit that comes and do things isn't that right now he showed me 1933 five other things already passed five things perfectly two more things gonna happen and the sixth thing is moving in exactly the wars exactly to the duck oh praise the name of the lord he said listen folks we ought to take adventuring every hour you don't know where we are standing real close oh blessed be the name of the lord now we lose upon the under the sixth seal 200 spiritual thousand spiritual demons started in rome germany hitler now watch a dictator is not a crown king he just received power as a king notice two hundred thousand thousand demons turn loose upon those jews when they burn them crucify them put bubbles in their veins kill them till they have no more gas to kill them with they shut them take that normal bullets to shoot them with and they they did everything they could do created their bodies and everything else but god said he would give each one of them a robe undeserving as they was but his grace to blind them so that we could see so you talk about they went through all what they went through and said it was the gentle hand of jehovah guiding them back to the promised land that is what all that was about oh glory to get the people in position because they were scattered when they said that cro at the cross may his blood be upon us and our children god scattered them but he promised in the last days to bring them back to their homeland and he promised in the last days to bring the christ church back to the homeland which is the day of pentecost that's why malachi 4 was sent to turn our hearts back to the homeland to the faith of the fathers or give the lord a shout in the house and the faith of fathers is living still oh glory to
