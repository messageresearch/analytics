Easter morning in this state somewhere lead our bodies at that time for we had a dust of the earth and in heaven there was a book of memory and his attribute was in him knowing that because this son

names God took the names upon Adam and animals to express sons from the book by the word but because he fell it fell in her sex and become her under natural birth which is the first bit so Jesus first message was you must be born again of the word and spirit so when you are born again of the word and spirit is bring you back to the original bit that we should have had if Adam had the book but he lost the book and it went back in the hands of Arizona but he not only lost the book which was the rights inheritance he lost his inheritance or glory also in the book him dollar inheritance has been restored not will be it has been restored so butter Branham says son come on and shine for days it was evidence the book has been restored literal fish I give you back your life it was a me next the

God for this last days or give the Lord a show I will say it again there's a boy that will manifest all the dimensions of the power of God in this last days that's why missing limbs will be restored or give the Lord some praise his people did hear what I said missing limbs will be restored prophet said Oh hallelujah we are justified by the blood hallelujah but he sent his will to redeem us Oh

Christ on the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and feel it that away reserved in heaven for you this inheritance is reserved nobody can touch it nobody got interfere with it nobody got claim what is yours or kill the Lord a shout that's why you are here to annoyed what is rightfully yours or give the Lord a shout this inheritance is resolved never went to a parking lot and she

culture so that that's reserved that's your stuff don't mess with my stuff Oh give the Lord a shout don't mess with my inheritance don't fool with it God give it to me feeling good tonight that's why Samson listen listen listen you may be seated that's why when Sam saw spring Delilah he wasn't in that channel he's the Lord avenge me of my twice then I make it damn they might not like to take it all glory to God they say right oh I fail I for that's not irrelevant his name was on the book he wanted to access power he wanted to be redeemed he wanted up I am an to reconcile himself back to God

image of his son who he foreknew he calls we call it justified who eat justify you already glorified its purpose is that you be conformed that Jesus be the firstborn of many brethren so we ever see some little Jesus is all around no sons of God not humans not Trinidadians not your national spirit he'll get busted god I want your human spirit that had a get ripped apart you have to get a new spirit his spirit fire commenced a little red orange yellow green them colors have to be freshness are you your spirit dead your spirit gone if you see a dead man in a coffin and you say hi I mean I'd say about hi Ronnie because something not right because when someone they report them a warning you a moving they could kiss them you could because of you no response no you had to become dead the ax men disappear and you might be so dead that somebody could spit in your face on you so that you can rebound yeah you can react somebody could say what I want to say about you you don't wanna tell somebody oh god look what he say and he like I need this and you're gonna defend your human spirit they defend it and I gotta defend yourself because you get upset one time they tell Barnum hawked anything they call him all kind of names and the man say you know what one day I guess a better banner use a Christian why he had a correct behavior his I can remember story one time man who was a newspaper publisher and he decided to go on the streets and buy one of his papers and woman who was selling papers was so terrible towards him and whatnot and the man's and somebody noticed that he brought the papers and asking but why you tolerate that he's I don't allow people's behave an action that to change the attitude that I have he was in control he was in charge it all was his newspaper is what ha ha haven't makin a living at the side of the road selling the paper that she was carrying all and carrying on and caring but he didn't let it affect him that is when you're getting mature that is when he gets in write them the Bible said he opened not his mouth do a trick Jesus show a trick they want used to entertain him when he said I could help you I could do some of you he said no no no my father put you did you you can't do anything unless my father allow it he know when to speak you know when to react he was in charge when you see you have to act and dance the people music you not in charge so when I want to make it move slow they make a slow tune for you I'm moving blue when they wanna move fast and you're always making an excuse because somebody has pull any string like a puppet and I develop it will tie up like puppets and they dance into the string work and they don't you understand how their lives are being influenced by these demon activity they're like puppets really just puppets hallelujah that's why just expose the hats of the Pharisees when they caught the woman caught in adultery they said Moses law says she's supposed to be stoned and here they are as I said in as you know one calf won't call he forget to buy milk for his bike always suddenly pretending you get him phone call no phone call one by one day left leave the woman in tears jesus said where Dyne accusers neither do i condemn be her name was on the book I am sure where them guide to God a most hypocrites because they were just as guilty as that woman maybe not of that but he said which one of you without sin cast the first stone so he was showing that from a hot condition the Hat was the right from a hot condition from a costume condition the robes of looking real nice from a religious condition they were well respected but from a hat condition they were wretched miserable poor brain naked and don't even know it or glory to God he comes your hot condition as the condition got your heart God your heart your heart condition is more important than you think or glory no God hallelujah Lloyd of God amen praise God the redemption is holy of God redemption is true a person redemption is by blood and redemption is by power and Jesus Christ I'm to redeem you from the guilt of sin the guilt of shame and who the Son of Man set free is free indeed Oh glory to God from the third seal when that last soul comes in then the time of redemption is finished finished then the lamb comes forth to claim his rights to what he has redeemed so he enters coming to save this bride he's coming to redeem this bride is a redeemed bride leaving this earth I want to hear bigger a man that I want you to understand what God requires to make the rapture is a redeemed people a people brought back to the inheritance or glory to God Adamic going back to your other mixed eat hallelujah from the third seal now he found out a slain lamb is the bloody lamb bleeding all over after I been slain and raised again or sitting on the throne and back in behind the tree like this in the season for all those souls that would come so the intercessory work of the lamb was waiting until these souls come in then when the last one was here it was completed God still held the book of redemption who was in prison under the sixth seal there were trumpets open this one quickly he had left the mercy seat his work of redemption was finished he came forth and took the book on the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and time was no more and admittedly I angel appeared you see in this book here we go was what was redeemed so he put all those names to be redeemed in a book and sealed it that they will have no access to it access denied they have no access to that book but God the Lamb took the book break the seals give it to a prophet the prophet chopped it up on the earth far brighter take give me that book - my name is on that book I want you understand and see on him on that book your life change wherever the bat becomes a brand new book this is a book of God there's a book with your name no devil can put the devil and put it you can't take it out no man you put it no man can put it out no Manta put you in and no man to put you out or kill the Lord pray is offering that is right a night you pass into the kingdom of God you strive into the kingdom of God or the kingdom of God is preached and every man passed away into it or give the Lord some praises or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Laurel everything that he has redeemed was written in that book and all sorry all that he died for was written in the book and he could not leave his military seat until he had thoroughly redeemed and he couldn't redeem it at the cross because they were predestinated in the Lamb's Book of Life you have to stay on and make intercession until the last person was finished that's why God is merciful that's why God is gracious that's Mike Warren so forgiving because he has to wait until that last name coming what is waiting on you God his beat him let's go get that last name Oh hallelujah there is one more name on that book oh boy we love God as a last them rather on that book Oh sitting idle oh god is great of you to testify to give a witness to invite somebody you don't know who is who we don't know who is who or everybody not is it not members of the body of Christ everybody not everybody not names on the book or globe we don't know who is you I have a book to take off people name or cross on anybody name don't know who is all but you see I got the father given to me if you know your name is on that book you have a writer singing show until God praises I don't care what problem is going to that have nothing with you praise and I'm giving God glory I look at the doctors give up on you that has nothing very good doctor say yeah one more week give God praise tonight because God could cancel all of that and change all that but a man say Redemption only come when the Redeemer died they were potentially under the blood of lambs not the Redeemer had not redeemed yet until the Redeemer came John look around here sat on the throne with the book in his hand have been seated with seven seas and the whole plan of redemption was in it it has been lost by the foot by the human race Adam I knew and it went back where season couldn't take it he just calls himself to lose it and where did the book go to didn't belong to the human race the blessings didn't belong there here the human race has lost it it went back in the hands of the original owner that is why the voice said who can take the book who is will so the book of Revelation is a real mysterious book that book witnesses before the function of the world who is what is take the book until loosely seven seals no human could take it no more special Pope as Bishop Minister so called faithful pastor probably not no I'm not wanna could take the book anyways Rascals O'Hara's got to take that book the Kami look upon a book no human could take that book but a human had to be the Redeemer a kinsman redeemer one her back into mankind is not right so the world had become flesh and as old Jesus pick up this robot flesh to become the kinsman redeemer the horn take the book and we didn't you and I and he could only access the book to Calvary all glory to God true death or glory price had to be paid so the access rights to this book was to the cross so when he came to that Junction in the cabinet at cemani if it is possible let this cup pass he pressed on I said not my will die will be done

the book yet the stand there because it was God's purpose to redeem them their names were put on the lands book of life before the foundation of the world here comes the lamb watch him oh praise the name of the Lord the lamb came for what he had redeemed so it's almost like if his past tense so you're not just gonna be justified as that it will be redeemed that means you will be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ so forget your present image right know that you can handle your own self when you look you skill at you you can handle you you are too much for you and yet there's a prophecy hanging over you that's you you deceive you wanna be conformed to the image of his son Obion you are predestinated so that that means it is predetermined that you won't become that not delicate stop it nothing past nothing present nothing future withstanding this week what could stop William Rand I'm coming for when the Bible prophesy behold I send you Elijah his drunken father his drinking parents or family not even the family condition could stop it or give the Lord a shout sometimes we make so much excuses about environment you may be seated whether I'm in Argentina that African man

Africa his father is the king of the tribe and he knows he's the son of a king that leaves three on the floor doesn't affect his son or his revelation that he's a prince and I'm saying when you get that your condition where they are money where they have roof where they have morals when it rather better sleep on that doesn't change who you are or glow because who you are is not subjected by the condition along you or glory lily is always a lily but they pressured about the mock under my eye will tire sweep down all trash in the muck but the lily keep pushing up what kind of full coming on that river but the lily keep pushing up pushing up pushing up that flower gonna come to the very top Oh hallelujah praise God alright in the book he's coming to receive what he has redeemed oh my hallelujah I've always taught the Church wasn't haphazard Jesus never claimed eight and a half miles away he never died in happens haphazard way he come for a purpose that purpose it will fulfill the commandment of God that he might purchase to himself a church without spot or wrinkle wrinkle or glory to God I all believe in the election and so ireenie us here we go was one of the end of the
