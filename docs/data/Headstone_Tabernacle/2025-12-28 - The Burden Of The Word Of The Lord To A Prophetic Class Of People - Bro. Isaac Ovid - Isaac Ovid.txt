Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning? Are you happy that you made it to the end of another year? By his grace and his mercy, by his love, by his goodness, by his gracious heavenly father, we thank you this morning of pray and training and teaching and healing refuge, a house of peace, a house of safety, a house of God's bread, a house of comfort, Lord, a house where we can come and we can leave different than the way we came. Whenever we come into your presence, we either leave better or we leave, but we never leave the same way that we came. Heavenly Father, we leave this house, Lord, not just change, but change for the better. Change in the inner man, not just change in our feelings, our emotions Lord just to feel good about ourselves but something on the inside that Lord a new creation has been activated the seed in us has been quickened to life by the word of God that comes in contact with the spirit of God father we thank you for the grace and the mercy that you have Lord placed upon us and we thank you in advance for the healing that's about to take place breakthrough that's about to take place deliverance that's about to take place that are to go free because that's what you came to do. To set the captives free to Lord to put that liberty them that are bound to loose the bands of wickedness and break the shackles that have held the people back, Father. Lord, and as we come to the end of another year and prepare for a new year, Father, Lord, where your word teaches us to forgetting the things that have passed and to look to the things that up ahead, Father, we come to your house, Lord, to Lord, for this final service of 2025 of last Sunday as it were of the year. Father, we give you glory. We give you honor to your holy name in the precious, marvelous, wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; and the church says, &gt;&gt; amen and amen. You may be seated for a few minutes in the presence of the Lord. And certainly want to greet you, greet one and all in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And it's certainly a privilege to be in the land of the living. It's not something to take for granted. It's not something that you could take casually because there are many people did not make it to this point. They didn't make it to this day. They didn't make it to this month. They didn't make it to this year. But God through his grace and mercy has seen it fit that we would be counted worthy to be present to see what we see and to hear what we hear and to be a part of what God is doing in this season and this hour. So we want to just give the Lord a hand of praise and thanksgiving that he who has started the work in us is more than able to bring it to pass to bring it to completion. He said, "I know the plans I have for you, the thoughts I have for you to bring you to an expected end. It's an end that is expected. He knows the expectation of the end before you were even born. He had an expected end in mind of how you should look when you leave here. How you should look when you come to the house of God. How you should look when the Holy Spirit comes upon your life. I want to greet one and all and salute one and all by the grace of God. It feels good in the house of God. It feels like you're here because you know who you are. You know where you come from. You know where you're going. You know what God expects of you and your expectation should be rising by the grace of God. So I greet one and all those that are here. I know there are few people who are not well and they're downstairs. And I went to brother Hugh. I said brother Hugh why are there so many people downstairs? He says some people are not well. As I left hearing those words, I see maybe as the word goes forth this morning, the people downstairs will be quickened to come upstairs because the healing power that's not limited to time and space and limited by four walls can reach downstairs and quicken and heal and transform and deliver, regularize blood pressure. Come on. Destroy the virus and the flu and female condition, male condition, whatever condition it is. destroy cancer, destroy arthritis, DESTROY LEUKEMIA, DESTROY EVERY DEMON BECAUSE EVERY SPIRIT, EVERY PRINCIPALITY HAS A NAME. AND IF WE COULD IDENTIFY WHAT IT IS, WE COULD CALL IT OUT AND DEAL WITH IT. Can the church say amen? Even to reach the internet, to those that are connected online, may the quickening power of God touch you where you are. May your house, your home, your office, your desk, where you be, may the pillar of fire drop down because the spirit is promised to follow the word of the living God. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; So by the grace of God, on behalf of the pastor, I'd like to thank the church for their commitment to this year 2025, for the grace of God and for your faithfulness to the message of the hour. We don't preach our own message. We preach another man's message. Can the church say amen? So we salute you, the church, those that have made that choice to make this your home church. You know the prophet said you ought to have a home church, a place you call your home, a place where you identify. There are many people who profess this message and home church. You know, we're going into a new season. So, we're not holding back on anything anymore. We we're not dealing with children. Brother Clarence, when I was a child, I speak as a child, I understood as a child, and but when I became a man, we put away childish things. So, we want to eat some real food. You know, people coming out of the Christmas season, they had all kind of food, but there's some real spiritual food. That's not cereal. That's not milk. That's not soy milk or this kind of milk or but it's the real food of the word of God that quickens us and strengthens us and prepares us for battle because there's a great battle that lays ahead. There's a war that lays ahead. There's a there's challenges that lays ahead. But by the grace of God, he has raised up another generation who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age. I really want to salute brother Oid. You appreciate your pastor this morning. I'm moving by inspiration this morning. He doesn't I'm doing this but we appreciate we appreciate you. We love you. We thank you for the vision. And I heard somebody say, you know, recently in the last few days, we are grateful for the ministry that we are under. And that is I could speak that from myself. There are God called men in this season. Ephesians say therefor God has set in the church. It's not man voting. It's not man electing. It's not man choosing. But when God sets and puts something upon a man's life that you be identified with in then you know is the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes. And brother Renham taught us you can't go where your pastor can't take you. You can't live higher than your pastor. So by the grace of God as we come to this end of the year we want to keep praying for our pastor that the Lord would strengthen him and like an eagle he would fly even higher so we could fly as a church. Hallelujah. To where the food is gathered and the where the carcass is there. the eagles gathered together to get strong meat so we could deal with the issues of life. Can the church say amen? So we want to salute our pastor and all the ministers and the elders in the church who stand faithful, who are committed, who are dedicated, brother Anthony, Jason, all the elders, the deacons, the trustees, the ushers, the technical team, the Sunday school team, the kitchen team, the Hospitality team, the parking attendants, the gardening team, the welcoming committee, the prayer warriors, the mothers, the fathers, the grandfathers, the children, the young, the old, the healed, those that are about to be healed, the delivered, those that ARE ABOUT TO BE DELIVERED, THE FREE, THOSE THAT ARE ABOUT TO BE FREE. IT DOESN'T MATTER. WE GIVE THE LORD PRAISE. HE SAID, "THANK HIM. IN THE GOOD TIME, PRAISE HIS NAME. IN THE BAD TIME, DO THE SAME." HALLELUJAH. GLORY. I'm telling you, we have preached many times before, but this season is different. We don't have much time left. When you look and see America has put their troops in this place, and this arm is in this place, and all these things they are doing has to wait on you and I to come into position. &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT UP TO SOME WAR ROOM AND SOME POLITICAL DEBATE TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS DETERMINED BY THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. SHE IS GOD'S AUTHORITY ON THE EARTH. OH, you don't hear me this morning. Nothing moves UNTIL WE SAY SO. HALLELUJAH. ELIJAH, SHUT UP THE HEAVENS. THERE'LL BE NEITHER DUE NOR RAIN UNTIL I CALL FOR IT. AND THE BRIDE ON THE EARTH WILL HAVE THE POWER TO SHUT UP THE HEAVENS. NOTHING WILL MOVE UNTIL WE SPEAK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'VE GOT TO REALIZE WHO YOU ARE. YOU GOT TO REALIZE THE POWER THAT'S LOCKED UP IN YOU. AND THAT POWER WANTS TO COME FORTH BECAUSE WHEN TWO OMNIPOTENT MEET, THE MIRACULOUS MUST TAKE PLACE. AND THERE'S AN OMNIPOTENT THIS MORNING IN THE PERSON OF THE HOLY GHOST. THAT SAME ANGEL THAT NEVER LEFT THE EARTH WHEN THE PROPHET LEFT IS ON THE EARTH NOW FIXING THINGS AROUND FOR THE COMING OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; But there's another omnipotent here this morning locked up in the seeds of the elect. in that elect push his bride of Jesus Christ who WILL BE WASHED BY THE WORD, WASHED BY THE BLOOD, CLEANSED BY THE SPIRIT THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT HIMSELF WILL MAKE himself known. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may be seated. So want to salute the church. I want to appreciate my wife who has put up with me and my daughter Isabelle. The Lord has blessed me with we could be of service and of fellowship with the body of Jesus Christ. And friends, it's later than we think. When brother Brandham said these words, he said, "It's got me scared that we haven't done enough. Have we done enough?" You know, and on December the 24th, just about four days ago. 60 years ago to be exact, 1965 to 2025. It's been 60 years since God in his wisdom took the prophet. But the Brandham couldn't stay one more minute longer because his mission was finished. His purpose was finished. Every mystery had been revealed. Everything that this messenger was supposed to do had been accomplished because God will never take you off the earth unless your mission is accomplished. So if you are still here, &gt;&gt; can I say it one more time? God can never take you off the earth until your mission is accomplished. So if those who are not here are not here, it's because their mission has been accomplished. But once there's still a mission in your life, God cannot take you off the earth. You could be sick. YOU COULD BE TIRED. YOU COULD BE WALKING THIS WAY, THAT WAY. BUT IF THERE'S A PURPOSE UPON your life, then you'll be in the house OF GOD. YOU'LL BE FIGHTING DEVILS. YOU'LL BE DEALING WITH THE WORLD. You'll be DEALING WITH ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. BUT NOTHING'S GOING TO STOP YOU BECAUSE there's a purpose upon your life. Can the church say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor and tell them there's a purpose upon your life. I'm just warming up this morning. It's the last Sunday, church. There are no more Sundays left. So, we want to put our all into it this morning. There are no more Sundays left. So, this is it. What you didn't do in the first Sunday, you'll do today. What you didn't do IN THE THIRD SUNDAY, YOU'LL DO TODAY. WHAT YOU didn't do in the 15th SUNDAY, YOU'LL DO TODAY. THERE'S NO MORE SUNDAYS LEFT IN THIS YEAR. So if YOU DIDN'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE THE DEVIL A KNOCKOUT PUNCH ON A SUNDAY, THEN THIS IS THE SUNDAY TO DO IT. YEAH, YOU YOU HAVE NO OTHER SUNDAY LEFT IN THIS YEAR TO DO IT. OH, YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. IF YOU DIDN'T KICK THE DEVIL, PUNCH THE DEVIL, BUT THE BRAND SAY SAY BOO BACK. IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT IN THE WHOLE YEAR, THEN TODAY IS THE ONLY DAY YOU HAVE LEFT. LET US DO WHAT WE COULD DO WHILE WE COULD DO IT. We must work while it is day. &gt;&gt; Everybody feeling fine? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. You know, but you know, I'm still under mentorship. I'm still under training. But to say, don't say it won't be too long with you. So, I'm taking instruction this morning. I'm not going to say that this morning. But by the grace of the Lord, when we come to the house of God, friends, it's the distress. But the man preach said letting of the pressure &gt;&gt; because this year was a lot of pressure. You know, &gt;&gt; so wait now that was just for me. This year was a lot of pressure and that how it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be a lot of pressure because the pressure is what proves the character in you. If there's no pressure, there's no character to be proven. We don't know who you are until the pressure comes. And when THE PRESSURE COMES, THEN WE COULD SEE IF THAT LOOKS LIKE A SON, that looks like a daughter. LOOK AT PRESSURE. LOOK AT STRESS. AND THEY'RE STILL STANDING. THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN UP, BUT THEY'RE STILL IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. THEY SHOULD HAVE BACKSLID, BUT THEY DRAGGED THEMSELVES INTO THE HOUSE OF THE GOD. THEY MAYBE THEIR MAMA BROUGHT THEM. MAYBE THEIR DADDY BROUGHT THEM. I DON'T CARE. BUT THEY'RE STILL HERE. SO, WHICH MEAN THE DEVIL DON'T HAVE THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. CAN THE CHURCH say amen? Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I'm excited by the grace of God this morning. Can we stand to our feet just to read three portions of scripture? A little encouragement this morning from the word of God. I want to read Malachi 1 second. Malachi 1 verse one. The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. Reading second Timothy 3 and reading verse 16. All scripture is given by inspiration of God. Not some scriptures, but all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. And lastly, Revelation 10:7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he had declared to his servants, the prophets. May the Lord add his blessing to the reading of his word. Shall we just pray one more time? Heavenly Father, we thank you to be in your house on this final Sunday of 2025, Father. And Lord, there are so many who did not make it into this day. And Lord, we pray a special blessing, Lord, and everyone that's here, Lord, in the sanctuary downstairs, connected online, and who may watch this tape that the grace that and peace and mercy and blessing of the Lord that surpass it all understanding would be with them. Father, any man could read the scriptures, but it takes the Holy Spirit to open it and divide it and to rightly present it. So, may you drop down, Lord, and speak to your people. Take me out of the way completely, Lord. Bring my ideas and thoughts under subjection to the spirit. Let nothing be said that you don't once said. And father let what you once said be said. Father Lord have an impact and effect on the hearts of your people. May you pour out your Holy Spirit to confirm the word with signs, wonders, and miracles. We Lord pray for your people and pray for me also. Touch my body. Touch your people. Touch those that are weary. Touch those that are sick. Touch those that are tired. Touch those that are struggling. Touch those that the enemy Lord has almost had them on the back of a wall. But father, may strength and virtue and grace come unto your people even now and have your perfect way. Bless the word one more time and the reading of it we ask in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen and amen." You may be seated in the presence of the Lord. Hallelujah. Glory. So, I have a title this morning, the burden of the word of the Lord to a prophetic class of people. The burden of the word of the Lord to a prophetic class of people. And we are taking that from that scripture we read in Malachi 1:1, the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. We're going to position it this morning as the burden of the word of the Lord to a prophetic class of people just to lay a foundation. We said it, but I want to just reinforce it as we end this year and prepare for a new year. On December 24th, Christmas Eve, 1965, 60 years ago, Brother Brandon went on to be with the Lord. unknown, almost unrecognized and unacknowledged by the world at large. Outside of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, the greatest prophet had silently slipped away. Many names such as Abraham, Moses, Noah, David, Daniel, Elijah, Elisha had long been established as necessary actors in God's great drama. But this time was different. This name was not to be written on buildings, universities, schools of theology. The ministry of this great prophet Elijah of Malachi 4:5 and six was different. As God unfolded the story of his life through three poles, there was a great purpose for this prophet. This prophet was to deliver a seven seals, seven thunder message to prepare an elect Omega word bride for the rapture, for the wedding supper, and for the millennium. God has always had an order, and God will never break his order. From the beginning of time, the word of the Lord has always come to the prophets. Amos 3:7 says, "Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealth his secret unto his servants, the prophets." I am not a prophet, so I'm not trying to attempt to be a prophet. But we thank God that there was a prophet in our day, a prophet in our time who almighty God spoke to and spoke through and used to point clarity to the word. &gt;&gt; Kings were made subject TO THE PROPHETS. THE HIGH PRIESTS AND ALL the Levites were made subject to the prophet. Those who went to war were subject to the prophet. The word of the prophet would stand until the next prophet would come along. Is this age to be any different? According to my Bible, there is no other major prophet to come. There's no other messenger to come. The last messenger has already come and the last messenger has already gone. And as we established, he could not have left unless his mission and his purpose was accomplished. There will be no other ministry like his ministry for what he was called to do. But the ministry of Jesus Christ that operated in him is promised to operate through an end time bride, an end time people. And it will be not their might or their power, but it will be by the spirit of the Lord. When brother Brandham spoke, it was not a man speaking. When brother Brandham spoke, it was the son of man veiled in a son of man. No wonder brother Brham would say in the message the Leodysian church age. Yes, listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age. What he says from God, the bride will say. The spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing. and what they will say will have already been said in the word. This brings us back to the Bible because what they say will have already been said in the word. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; I'm laying a foundation. Why I'm against organized religion? Remember Brandham said the Holy Spirit today, the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word. Not back to church, not back to denomination, not back to gathering, but back to the word. Because the Holy Spirit will only vindicate the word. If I come this morning and present my dream, my idea, my thought, there is no confirmation or no vindication of that. But if I present the word to you, then the Holy Spirit has to vindicate the word because the Holy Spirit and the word is one. Can the church say amen? Back to THE WORD MEANS BACK TO the Bible. But the Bible has always been a sealed book. WITHOUT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, THE BIBLE IS CLOSED TO YOU. THIS IS WHY WE ARE NOT A PENTECOSTAL CHURCH or a Methodist church OR AN EVANGELICAL CHURCH OR JUST AN APOSTOLIC CHURCH OR JUST SEEN WE A MESSAGE CHURCH BECAUSE THE BOOK IS CLOSED OUTSIDE OF THE PROPHET. BUT WHEN THAT GREAT ELIJAH PROPHET STOOD ON THE EARTH THEN THE BOOK BECAME AN OPEN BOOK. THE BOOK BECAME A NEW BOOK AND WHEN WE LOOK AT SCRIPTURE IN THE BOOK IT LOOKS DIFFERENT TO US BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THROUGH THE EYES THROUGH THE PROPHETIC EYES. CAN THE church say amen? Let us be clear. The Bible is closed to the Pentecostals. I don't care how anointed they are, how many signs and wonders they are, it's still a closed book to them. There are things they could see that's obvious, but there are things that are hidden that they could never see. Because what they cannot see is reserved only for a prophetic class, &gt;&gt; A PROPHETIC CLASS OF PEOPLE. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? NOT EVERYBODY'S IN A PROPHETIC CLASS. THERE'S A SPECIAL CATEGORY THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM CALL A PROPHETIC CLASS OF PEOPLE. THESE PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT. They could see what others cannot see. THEY COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT OTHERS CANNOT UNDERSTAND. THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN IT, BUT WHEN THEY SEE IT, THEY CANNOT UNSEE IT. OH, you don't hear me this morning. Can the church say amen? The Bible is close to the Pentecostals. The Bible is CLOSE TO THE BAPTISTS. THE BIBLE IS CLOSE TO THE METHODISTS. THE BIBLE IS CLOSE TO PEOPLE IN THE MESSAGE WHO DON'T really believe BECAUSE IN EVERY CHURCH THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF BELIEVERS. THERE ARE MAKE BELIEVERS, THERE are unbelievers, AND THERE'S A PROPHETIC CLASS. BECAUSE THE TRUE believers are the prophetic class. THEY ACCEPT THE PROPHET. THEY ACCEPT THE PROPHET'S WORDS. THEY EXPECT OH, COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME THIS MORNING. THE BIBLE IS CLOSED TO THOSE IN A MESSAGE WHO DON'T DIG DEEP ENOUGH IN THE PROPHET'S MESSAGE TO PULL UP THE HIDDEN MYSTERIES ALREADY REVEALED. YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. ALREADY REVEALED BY MALACHI 4. We are not preaching a message of salvation this morning. WE ARE HIGHER THAN SALVATION. WE ARE NOT PREACHING A MESSAGE OF JUST COME OUT TO THE WORLD. THIS IS AN AGE OF ADOPTION. WE ARE NOT PREDESTINATED TO SALVATION. WE ARE PREDESTINATED TO ADOPTION BECAUSE ADOPTION IS BRINGING BACK AUTHORITY, &gt;&gt; POWER, PERMISSION. You don't hear me this morning. A police officer, brother man said, has no power to stop a vehicle. But when you see the uniform, you know that uniform represents all that the government has. It represents the commissioner of police. It represents the attorney general. It represents the prime MINISTER AND THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE A UNIFORM RECOGNIZES THE AUTHORITY THAT COMES FROM BEHIND THE UNIFORM. AND WHEN YOU PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD, THERE COMES A CERTAIN AUTHORITY WITH THAT ARMOR. &gt;&gt; GLORY. I'm warming up. I'm warming up. &gt;&gt; Glory. Thank you. Everybody feeling fine? last Sunday, right? &gt;&gt; Because we don't want to be coming to church and we don't know where we come from, what we going or somebody you MEET SOMEBODY AND WHY you believe this and you can't explain why you believe this, why you operate the way you do, why there's a covenant upon your life. And we preach about Samson. Even though Samson messed up, there was a covenant upon him. You messing up doesn't take away the covenant. God called you. THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. YOU CAN'T UNDO IT. HE ALREADY CALLED YOU. THE CALLING PART TAKE PLACE. HE SAID WHO HE FOR YOU, HE CALLED. WHO WE CALL HE JUSTIFIED? WHO WE JUSTIFIED? HEATH ALREADY GLORIFIED. YOU BEING BACKSITTING THIS MORNING DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE STILL CALLED ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE. THAT YOU ARE STILL GOING TO BE HEALED, STILL GOING TO RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST, STILL GOING TO BE CHANGED, STILL GOING TO BE TRANSFORMED. OH, YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. HALLELUJAH. YOUR MISTAKES CANNOT STOP GOD. HE ALREADY SAW EVERY MISTAKE YOU WOULD MAKE AND HE STILL WROTE YOUR NAME. OH, YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. But preacher, I messed up. I made mistake. I doubted. I didn't believe. Peter made mistakes. Peter doubted. PETER WENT TO DENY CHRIST AND HE WAS STILL THE ONE ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST. These men are not drunk as you suppose. But this is that WHICH WAS THE PROPHET JOEL SPOKE ABOUT ONE OF THESE DAYS THE HOLY GHOST IS GOING TO GET UPON YOU. AND WHEN IT DOES, NOBODY HAS to tell you to worship. Nobody has to tell you to shout. NOBODY TELL TO LIFT YOUR HANDS. YOU WILL DO IT INVOLUNTARILY BECAUSE THE SPIRIT WILL MAKE YOU DANCE. THE SPIRIT WILL MAKE YOU SHOUT. THE SPIRIT WILL MAKE YOU SING. THE SPIRIT WILL MAKE YOU WORSHIP. THE SPIRIT WILL MAKE YOU FORGIVE YOUR BROTHER. THIS WILL MAKE YOU TROD CLOTHES FROM YOUR WARDROBE THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE. &gt;&gt; But I want to make it CLEAR CHURCH. AND WE HAVE THE QUOTE. THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY. This is only FOR A PROPHETIC CLASS OF PEOPLE. OH, I feel good this morning. &gt;&gt; So, Malachi 4 revealed many things. Now, there are three main scriptures that identify brother Brandham's ministry. There's Malachi 45 and 6, which is the first one you'll find in scripture in the cannon of scripture. Then you'll go across to St. Luke 17:30 and then Revelation 10:7. We're going to touch on Malachi 4 because if you don't know young brother, young sister why you believe what you believe then anybody can sway you. You know somebody tell you something said but he say something and people talking a lot of stuff these days and they have to fact check a lot of things. Got people saying things and they have no facteing behind it. Presenting ideas, concepts this and that. And when you ready dig recognize who say that? Who already say that? I see it on the internet. Really? Somebody sent a video to me. It had like four views. That is the man who post it. Your friend who say check it and see if it up. No, you have to be careful because people sharing all kind of foolishness. And now in this AI age of artificial intelligence, people taking your voice and twisting it, taking words. And if you there people even the President Trump and all say it wasn't him, it was AI. So you have to know what your foundation is in. This is why I still thank God for the written books because no AI could interfere with this. You could share a link that AI inter but you see the original book when you go open the book and read it for yourself and recognize wait a minute this is where the prophet said that's the way THE CHURCH IS. THE VINE HAS BEEN SPLIT AND YOU could read it for yourself and KNOW THIS IS WHAT HE SAID. CAN THE CHURCH say amen? Glory. I'm laying a foundation. I see I hear me stream down. See why I need to be in church. I think it's still that they'll hear. Don't take church for granted. People have gotten too casual. We'll get to it in the script. People have gotten too casual. I understand. If you have no choice and you have then you have no choice. But if you have an opportunity to be the house of God, then why forsake the assembly? Why are you not in the house of God to put your shoulder to the wheel? And we're going to get it IN SCRIPTURE. SO MALACHI 4 REVEALED MANY THINGS. HE swed seeds that spoke of things that are about to unfold. There's nothing that's happening now that's a surprise to us. THINGS THAT ARE TO BE WARS, RUMORS OF WARS AND ALL THESE THINGS. THESE ARE NOT SURPRISE TO US. WE ARE NOT MARCHING TO THE BEAT OF THE WORLD. The world is marching to our beat because nothing, HE SAID, THIS GOSPEL WILL BE PREACHED AND THEN THE END SHALL COME. SO WHEN THIS GOSPEL IS FINISHED PREACHING, ONLY THEN COULD THE END COME. AND THIS GOSPEL WILL BE PREACHED UNTIL EVERY NAME THAT'S ON THE BOOK HAS BEEN DELIVERED. YOUR SON, YOUR DAUGHTER, YOUR WIFE, YOUR BROTHER, YOUR NEIGHBOR, YOUR COWORKER, I DON'T CARE WHO THEY ARE. IF THEIR NAME IS IN THE BOOK, THIS GOSPEL MUST AND WILL BE PREACHED. AND ONLY WHEN THE NAME IS IN THE BOOK HAS BEEN CALLED AND THE DOOR IS SHUT, THEN THE JUDGMENT CAN BEGIN. CAN the church say amen? GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT OF PRAISE. &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 swed seed that spoke of things that are to be. He swed seed that tied up all the LOOSE ENDS. SO THERE ARE NO LOOSE ENDS IN THE WORLD. in the word. We have loose ends, but there's no loose end in the message. The loose ends is not ON THE PROPHET'S SIDE, CHURCH. IT'S ON OUR SIDE. WE HAVE TO TIE UP OUR LOOSE ENDS BECAUSE ALL THE LOOSE END OF THE WORD HAS ALREADY BEEN TIED UP. &gt;&gt; SO, WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR ANYBODY TO TIE UP LOOSE ENDS IN THE WORD, IT'S ALREADY TIED UP. EVERY MYSTERY REVEALED, BUT THE MYSTERY OF WHO YOU ARE AND HOW YOU LIVE AND HOW YOU ADD THE VIRTUES. THAT'S WHAT'S BEING UNFOLDED BEFORE US THROUGH YOUR TRIALS, THROUGH YOUR TESTING, THROUGH YOUR SITUATION, THROUGH WHAT'S GOING ON. HALLELUJAH. HE THROW YOU IN A BETTER SICKNESS. HE TURNED THE CHURCH AGAINST YOU. HE TURNED YOUR WIFE AGAINST YOU. WHAT IS HE DOING? WAITING TO POUR OUT YOUR SPIRIT TO SAY, "THERE IS MY SPIRIT FLOWING FREELY." &gt;&gt; Can the church say, "Amen. He swed the seeds that revealed every mystery, &gt;&gt; special seeds for the bride. He said, "You see why I'm so zealous in the message spoken with the original seed. See why I'm been so zealous of the kind of seed that have been planted for the body. The rain's going to fall pretty soon. I mean, the real rain, and it's got to have seed to fall on. I hope I live to see it." Do you understand now? It will be the living word as it was at the beginning. The spoken word of God have his power for it is in him in his own body working his own way. So this morning we are speaking to those about those seeds that are for the bride body. You see what brother Andrew Glover said he not preaching about hell because he have no plan to go there. There's nothing wrong with preaching about hell. No, but why be spending time preaching about where we not going? WE COULD A WHOLE SERVICE ABOUT THE POPE AND about Rome and about this. But why not going into the tribulation period? I want to know what PROMISE IS MINE. TELL ME WHAT IS MINE. TELL ME WHAT BELONGS TO ME. BUT THE BRANDON PRESENTED MANY THINGS BECAUSE HIS PURPOSE WAS TO TIE UP ALL THE LOOSE ENDS. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT I WANT TO HEAR THIS MORNING IS TELL ME WHAT I GOT TO DO TO BE IN THE RAPTURE. TELL ME WHAT I GOT TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT MY FAMILY BRINGS IN COMES IN. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; It's good. I know about the tribulation and the plagues and the wars and all these things, but I have no plans to be here for the tribulation and you shouldn't plan either. What I want is the seeds, the promises, the word that the bride must produce. That's what's important to me. And this morning, those things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children. Brother Brandham, hallelujah, he revealed that there's a power coming into the church. There'll come a time, church, when we won't be preaching it. We'll see it actually come in. Right now, we are in the ministry of the word, speaking about it, speaking about it. But one of these days, we'll shift from the ministry of the word to the ministry of the spirit. Can the church say amen? He's prophesied that there'll be a manifestation of the sons of God. That by and through the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised. There will be an omega bride with the same signs, wonders, and miracles like the ALPHA BRIDE. ONCE MORE, the world will hear direct from God. There will be an Ephesians 4 ministry ON THE EARTH. ALL WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. There'll be a perfect church. There'll be a church with Jesus Christ walking in it. There'll be a church where sin cannot stay IN THAT CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT MALACHI 4 SPOKE ABOUT. There'll be a church where sin cannot stay in the church. SEVEN THUNDERS IS A BRIDES REVIVAL IN THAT CHURCH. RAPTURE AND FAITH IS LAYING IN THE MESSAGE IN THAT CHURCH. The same Jesus WHO HEALED THE SICK, RAISED THE DEAD, MADE THE LAME WALK, MADE THE DUMB TALK, WALK ON WATER, FED 5,000 WILL BE IN THAT CHURCH. THAT SAME JESUS WILL BE VEILED IN A PEOPLE. The mystery that HAS BEEN HID FROM GENERATION WHICH IS CHRIST IN YOU, THE HOPE OF glory will be in that church. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. It is only through the prophetic message of the seventh angel that we can go back to the Bible. That's why we read that scripture, Revelation 10:7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets. So the ministry of that Elijah, Malachi 4, St. Luke 17:30, Revelation 10:7, the seven angel was to gather all the scattered word and tie up all the loose ends as a seven seal, seventh thunder message so that an elected bride can come to perfection, adoption, and go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Are we together this morning? &gt;&gt; Let's go in the message of revelation of Jesus Christ. Brother said, if Satan hates any book in the Bible, it's the revelation BROTHER SAID HE HATES ALL scripture &gt;&gt; and it's the WHOLE CANNON OF SCRIPTURE but if anything he despises mostly is revelation and Genesis because Genesis tells the beginning and Revelation reveals what's going to happen to him in the last days going to be bound a thousand years. Then him and the false prophet and the beast is going to be throwed alive into the lake of fire. SO THE DEVIL HAS READ THAT AND HE KNOWS IT. HE BELIEVES and it trembles and HE HATES IT BECAUSE it speaks about him. But the BOOK ALSO SPEAKS ABOUT US. HE HATES IT BUT WE LOVE IT BECAUSE THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE WILL SAY COME. HALLELUJAH. IN THERE IS A BRIDE. HIS WIFE HAD MADE HERSELF READY. THAT'S ALSO IN THAT BOOK. COME ON NOW CHURCH. Brother Brennham goes on, he'll attack the book of Genesis upon it being authentic. Brother Brandham is saying this in 1960 and people HAVE ATTACKED SCRIPTURE. THEY'VE ATTACKED THE PROPHET MESSAGE. THEY ATTACKED JESUS WHERE HE WAS WHEN HE WAS ON EARTH. So why should IT BE A SURPRISE TO US WHEN PEOPLE ATTACK SCRIPTURE OR TO ATTACK the message? They call Jesus BL. Could you imagine the audacity of man to look at God made flesh and say it's the devil? He'll attack the book of Genesis upon it being authentic. He'll say that it isn't authentic and he'll stir the minds of people. Watch where the devil lays. That book of Genesis or the book of Revelation, the first and the last. Let's go on. And the book of Revelation has more symbols in it than all the rest of the books in the Bible. It has more symbols because it is a book of prophecy. It's a prophetic book. Therefore, IT HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY A PROPHETIC CLASS. SO, nobody could UNDERSTAND THIS BOOK. BUT UNLESS YOU BELONG TO A PROPHETIC CLASS. HALLELUJAH. THANK GOD THAT I'M PART OF A PROPHETIC CLASS THAT WE COULD LOOK AT THE BOOK AND SEE THE FIRST SEAL, SECOND SEAL, third seal, FOURTH SEAL, SEVEN THUNDERS, REVELATION. I SEE A MIGHTY ANGEL COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN CALL WITH A CLOUD, RAINBOW UPON HIS HEAD, FACE AS IT WOULD HAVE FEET. OH, COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME. THE PENTECOSTALS COULD READ THAT, BUT THEY DON'T SEE IT. BUT YOU, YOU SEE IT, YOU READ IT. AND THEN YOU SEE REVELATION 10:7, IN THE DAYS OF THE VOICE OF THE SEVEN ANGEL, WHEN HE SHALL BEGIN TO SOUND, THE MYSTERY SHOULD BE FINISHED, GO ASK THE PENTECOSTAL ABOUT THAT. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. &gt;&gt; AND REVELATION 28, GO TO THE ANGEL AND TAKE THE BOOK. OH, HALLELUJAH. JOHN IS A TYPE OF THE PRIDE REPRESENTING YOU AND I. SWEET IN THE MOUTH, BITTER IN THE BELLY, BEARING THE REPROACH FOR 60 YEARS. BUT HERE WE STAND. WE ARE NOT MOVING FROM IT. IF THIS IS WRONG, THEN I DON'T WANT TO BE RIGHT. IF THIS IS NOT THAT, I'LL KEEP THIS UNTIL THAT COMES. &gt;&gt; Brother said this book is not meant for everybody. &gt;&gt; Can I say IT AGAIN? THIS BOOK OF REVELATION IS NOT MEANT FOR EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW HOW MANY BIBLES IT HAVE IN THE WORLD? PEOPLE HAVE BIBLE ON THEIR PHONE, BIBLE ON THEIR BED, BIBLE ON THEIR BANISTER, BUT WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE BOOK OF REVELATION, THAT BOOK IS NOT FOR THEM. IT'S FOR A PROPHETIC CLASS OF PEOPLE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU READ IT, YOU'RE NOT READING WORDS. IT'S THE DIVINE MYSTERY OF GOD. It's the ORACLES OF GOD. IT'S THE PLAN OF GOD. IT'S THE PURPOSE OF GOD TO A PROPHETIC class of people. &gt;&gt; But everybody say this book is made for a certain class. I want to be in that class. I NEED TO BE IN THAT CLASS. I CAN BE OUTSIDE OF THAT CLASS. I DON'T WANT TO BE CLUELESS TO WHAT'S ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE. I don't want nobody tell ME WHAT IT IS. BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROPHET WHO REVEALED EVERY MYSTERY OF WHAT IT is &gt;&gt; and that mystery shows me who I am. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "The cannal mind cannot comprehend them great things. There are some people of cannally mind be minded is they in the flesh everything for them is everything for them is everything there's human emotion human feeling they see things just they don't see God in everything that's why say if you read the Bible and don't see Jesus in every verse go and read it again because when you're now spiritually minded, you operate different. You look at things different. YOU PROCESS TRIALS DIFFERENT. You possess situations differently because you're spiritually minded. The cannal mind cannot comprehend them great things of scripture because it's foolish to them. But to the ones who are lovers of the word of God, are there any who love the word of God. &gt;&gt; Notice it didn't hear here say people who love church people who love church enough. &gt;&gt; You know what they call that? A church spirit. They love church. And we'll get into that in a second. But to the ones who are the lovers of the word of God, that's who the book is written due to the church, the revelation of Jesus Christ. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; So we are back to the Bible. The devil's greatest fear is when the bride gets back to the Bible. It is written. It is written. It is also written. You know the devil still has PTSD from that encounter when he met Jesus in the wilderness. Say if thou be, if thou be, do this, do this, do this. And Jesus just say it is written. Now church, you cannot say it is written. If you don't know what written or not, this is why the Bible and the message of the hour is supposed to be your book that guides your life. It is written. Hold on. Hold on. What is written again, buddy? The word is supposed to be your weapon. The word is supposed to be YOUR DEFENSE. YOU HAVE TO KNOW BECAUSE when the devil bring a doubt to your mind. This is why when that man came to the prophet and he came back again for prayer and I say I pray for you already. Just keep saying by stripes I'm healed. What was he saying? Keep saying it is written and he show him the word that applied to his situation. You can't read the next scripture and apply it. You have to know the scripture that applies to your situation. But back to the word means back to the scripture. In the message the end time sign said Jesus said that the scriptures has to be fulfilled. Every word has to come to pass. Today we have gotten so far away from it. We've just mixed ourselves up with creeds and so forth until we just got a wild tantrum just as the Bible said we would do. And this is why church is so important to have the right balance. This is why we thank God for the ministry that we under. Because there are those who have word, word, word, word, word and no spirit. And you have spirit, spirit, spirit, spirit and no word. When you have word and spirit together, then you have something because the word is meant to be anointed. We in the word. We try biscuit just nothing. Then you just jumping up and down. Jumping up and down. What you hear in church? I don't know. Just jump up and down. But balance, hearing the word, seeing your name, responding to the word, being quickened to you, coming alive by it. It's driving you. You're listening to tape. You're in the atmosphere. You're fellowshipping around it. It's your driving force. It's your motivating force. It's propelling you. It's pushing you. That's a different thing. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; But the random goes on. But in the face of all of that, there's a real bride that God's bringing forth. Each generation gets its time. Did you ever notice there'll be a man of God come along that'll strike fire with God and there'll be a great revival sweep the land and what happens immediately after that they take the man's idea and denominate it and bring in creeds and mix with it there she dies and never rises again always has been always will be every time but coming back to the Bible is to produce a word bride because there has never been and will never be a bride like this bride but the random said there'll be brides brides churches churches brides bride but they must become one that has got the mechanics and dynamics together. Brother Brandham's ministry was limited by scripture because he could not go outside of scripture. But the Brandham said in a message, perfect strength by perfect weakness. I don't care what any angel would say. If it ain't according to the word, I don't believe it. So brother Brham himself was auditing the angels when it come to speak with him. He said if that angel told me, this is the PROPHET SPEAKING, "IF THAT angel told me something different from that, I wouldn't believe the angel." God's word first above all angels and everything else. Are we together? &gt;&gt; WHICH REINFORCES WHY YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR MESSAGE. You have to know the word and you have to look in scripture to know what he says here. I'm almost done this part. Then we get into our text in the message. Speak to this mountain. And he says when he stands before me in that light that you see on the picture and reveals it every time is perfect with the scripture through and through. So brother but the Brandom everything that he presented had to be able to be run through scripture. THIS IS WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM HIMSELF SAID BACK TO THE BIBLE. And I've said it many times there are a lot of message people who don't know the Bible. God's word is THE BIBLE. BROTHER BRHAM'S MINISTRY WAS TO BRING LIGHT unto the written word. Show the revealed word in the written word. That's the reason brother Bam said, "I know it's the angel of the Lord because he bears record of his word." And if that angel told me one thing that wasn't scriptural, I would not believe him. It has to be with the word first. God's word is eternal because an angel could come and preach something else. PAUL SAID THAT WASN'T RIGHT. BUT IF IT'S THE word of God, the angel of God will verify that word every time to be the truth. If it's a true angel from the Lord, if it's something off color, then don't you listen to it. But if an angel come and speaks and says just exactly what the word says, then that angel's from God. And church, the reason I'm saying it because certain things cannot go into 2026. Not because somebody stand behind sacred desk mean they're speaking the truth. Just think about it friends. 12 ministers went to the promised land. These were not noviceses, amateurs. These were the best men from every tribe. It was 12 men who were the best from every tribe, who would have had song doctrine, who would have had experiences, who would have BEEN TRUSTED. THE WHOLE TRIBE. THEY SAID THIS IS THE ONE BROTHER to go and witness this and bring back testimony of the land. It was Caleb, Joshua, and 10 good men from each tribe. Think about it in the whole tribe. You didn't send a a a random brother. They send THE BEST AND THE BEST WENT AND only two come back with a good report. And the other 10 OF THE BEST COME BACK AND SAY WE CAN'T TAKE IT. HALLELUJAH. GLORY. So this is why I am so careful because not everybody who say Christ Christ is is not all Israel is Israel and there are many in this message who believe a portion of it or is the agenda of it or their version of it. But I want the whole scroll. Tell me what I need to do to make it. I don't want to feel GOOD AND FEEL COMFORTABLE AND FEEL AND THEN I recognize I can't I can't I I I'm not qualified. Anybody with me this morning? That's why me I don't profess to be in the five-fold ministry. We having a conversation because that is God choosing. You can't get PROMOTED IN THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY. GOD places in the church. GOD HAS TO SET YOU IN THERE. Brother Brandon DID THE WORK OF AN EVANGELIST BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A PROPHET. So we HAVE TO BE SO CAREFUL BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO HOLDING ON TO TWO BOOKS, three books, get their eyes open with something. But the mystery of God's mind for the age, they don't see it. I'm not speaking about anybody in particular. I'm just saying that THERE HAS TO BE A CLARITY TO YOU BECAUSE PAUL TAUGHT US WHO WAS THE GOLD STANDARD. FOLLOW ME AS I FOLLOW CHRIST. AND WE WANT TO be a word church, A BIBLEBASED CHURCH, A SCRIPTURAL CHURCH, A CHURCH THAT KNOWS THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. CAN THE CHURCH say amen? &gt;&gt; I'm almost finished this part. In a message, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. That's the trouble today. WE TRY TO GET AHEAD OF THE WORD and bypass and make the word to fit this, the word to fit that. It be scary. You meet somebody and they quoting this and they plum all the beaten parts but they know enough of the message scripture to justify foolishness when THE BIBLE IS VERY CLEAR ON CERTAIN THINGS. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; What we need is follow the word inuza jubilee. Brother man said what we need to do is get rid of a lot of our fancy fandangos. Anybody know what a fandango is? But whatever it is you have to get rid of it. He said, "What we need to do is get rid of a lot of our fancy fandangos trying to check fandango and GET BACK TO THE BIBLE AND BACK TO THE OLDFASHIONED HOLY GHOST. BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE MAN and woman look and act and walk like Christians. NOT JUST ON SUNDAYS, BUT EVERY DAY." AMEN. AND YOU MIGHT THINK I'M A LITTLE EXCITED. I'M JUST A LITTLE CRAZY. BUT I TELL YOU, I LOVE to be this way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the man goes on, some time ago, going down the streets here in Los Angeles, I seen a man had a sign on the front of him. He said, "I'm a fool for Christ." And on his back, he said, "Whose fool are you?" So, I'd just rather be a fool for Christ than a fool for the devil anytime. HALLELUJAH. CALL ME WHAT YOU WANT. I WANT TO BE A FOOL FOR CHRIST. CALL ME OLDFASHIONED. CALL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL ME. YOUNG PEOPLE, IT DOESN'T MATTER. CALL ME THAT WANT. I'M PART OF THE PROPHETIC CLASS. CALL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT BECAUSE I KNOW I'M GOING TO THE RAPTURE. I KNOW I'M LEAVING THIS WORLD BEHIND. I KNOW SICKNESS CANNOT HOLD ME. I KNOW DEATH CANNOT HOLD ME. I KNOW DOUBT CANNOT HOLD ME. HALLELUJAH. I KNOW SIN CANNOT HOLD ME. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout of praise. Brother Brandham goes on, "What we need today ministers, what we need today, brothers and sisters, is this one thing. The devil has got into our church and got us all formal, indifferent." You know what formal mean? It's just a routine. You come to church, everything formal. You know, people say that how normal and formal everything become a ritual in different in different meaning. You don't already care. It don't already bother you. You come church and it is whatever it is. What we need is a calling back. What we need is a oldfashioned gathering together again. The sounding of the jubilee, the pouring forth of the Holy Ghost, the outcoming of the spirit. Sure, there's caused to come back to a prayer meeting. It's true. We have just begun to fashion off just like the world do just the same things the world does. How it happened is a lot of Hollywood evangelism and a lot of television staying home at night watching television instead of going to prayer meeting watching who loves Lucy. Young people don't know about who loves Lucy but watching Netflix and all these things. Oh yes. And staying away from the word of God and away from church. And I tell you brother that's the reason you know that's the truth. God, help us today to come back to the oldfashioned Pentecostal experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; So, let's touch the text a little bit. The burden of the word of the Lord to a prophetic class of people. Anybody has a burden for anything? Everybody has a burden. Some people have good burdens. Some people have bad burden. They have the burden for the wrong thing. But here we have a scripture the Lord speaking in Malachi 1:1, the burden of the word of the Lord. Not just the word, but the burden of the word. In other words, with this word, there was a burden coming with this word. When the word becomes a reality to you, it brings a burden with it. A burden for your family, a burden for lost souls, a burden for revival, a burden to pray. You cannot even pray without a burden. If you really want to pray for somebody, you have to catch a burden for them. If someone in your family is sick, you could pray with a burden or you could pray without a burden. You could sing with a burden or you could sing without a burden. THERE'S SOMETHING COMES OVER YOU when you have a burden. Lord, let us have a burden. &gt;&gt; A burden for revival. A burden for the Holy Ghost. A burden FOR THE SPIRIT. A BURDEN to see something change. Malachi is the last book of the Old Testament. And this is where I want to kind of bring it to us. Now he speaks to Israel in a time when the temple worship and the priestly service is functioning. He speaks through the scripture by declaring almost an accusation to the people. We read the message of Malachi but we know nothing about the man. Most of the prophets in scripture there are some identifiers about them. Isaiah son of Amos had access to kings. He was involved in national affairs. Jeremiah was from a priestly family. He was called young. We could read all of that. Ezekiel was a priest in exile by the river Chibba. We know about Hosea, his marriage and his children becoming a part of the prophecy. We know about Amos being a herdsman. We know his location in Takcoa. We know about Jonah and his travels and we have preached about these THINGS. WE KNOW ABOUT DANIEL AND HIS EXILE AND HIS ROYAL COURT AND THE PRAYERS OF DANIEL. Are we together? &gt;&gt; But Malachi, we know who his father is. Nothing is said about him. We don't know his tribe. We don't know his hometown. We don't know any kings he interacted with. We don't know anything about his personal story. We don't know how he was called. We don't know when he was called. There are NO MIRACLES RECORDED. ALL WE HAVE WITH MALACHI IS THE WORD. This is not accidental because it means with GOD AND PLACING MALACHI IN THAT SPOT BECAUSE REALIZE THIS CHURCH MALACHI was the last prophet of the Old Testament and God wasn't playing. WE SAY IT IN THIS DAY GOD COULD HAVE CHOSEN ANYBODY from this day but he chose a special group of people for this day. So when GOD LOOKED THROUGH ALL THE PROPHETS HE WOULD HAVE, HE PICKED A MAN FOR THE JOB THAT HE DIDN'T want us focus on the man. He didn't want us to get HUNG UP IN HIS PERSONALITY and his experiences. He wanted to just FOCUS ON ONE THING AND WANTING ONLY THE WORD OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AND NOT JUST THE WORD, BUT IT'S THE ONLY TIME IN SCRIPTURE WHERE WE SEE THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD. SO WHEN IT COMES TO MALACHI, WE CAN'T PREACH ABOUT HIS AGE, HIS WIFE, HIS CHILDREN, HIS BACKGROUND, WHO ORDAINED HIM, WHO CALL HIM, WHERE HE WAS, IF HE WAS IN JERUSALEM, IF HE WAS IN JUDEA. WE DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. ALL WE HAVE IS A MAN WITH A BURDEN. &gt;&gt; This is not accidental. THE FACT THAT MALACHI IS NOT KNOWN mean God don't want us focus on a man. THE MESSENGER IS NOT THE IMPORTANT THING. THE MESSAGE IS COME ON NOW, SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME. BECAUSE IT WASN'T MALACHI'S MESSAGE. IT WAS THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD. IT WASN'T MALACHI SPEAKING. YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. THIS WAS THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD. MALACHI WAS JUST A MICROPHONE. ALL MALACHI WAS WAS JUST A MICROPHONE. YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; SO NOBODY COULD COME AND QUESTION WHAT WAS MALACHI'S PERSPECTIVE. WHAT WAS MALACHI'S EXPERIENCES? MAYBE MALACHI HAVE BIAS. WAS HE FROM THE TRIBE OF JUDAH OR THE TRIBE OF LEVITE? WAS HE FROM THE TRIBE OF WHATEVER? WE HAVE NOTHING ABOUT IT. ALL WE HAVE IS A MAN SPEAKING THE WORD OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; And this word was so critical. THIS WORD WOULD be the LAST WORD THEY WOULD HEAR FOR 400 YEARS. BECAUSE AFTER MALACHI, THERE WAS NO PROPHET FOR 400 YEARS. SO GOD WAS BEING VERY DELIBERATE IN WHO HE would choose TO BE THE MAN TO CLOSE OFF THE OLD TESTAMENT. YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. HE WASN'T CHOOSING ANY AND ANYBODY. HE WANTED A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN. AND IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM. THIS MAN HAD TO HAVE NO EGO, NO AMBITION, NO STORY, NO I WAS HERE AND I WAS HERE AND I WENT HERE AND I PREACH HERE. NOTHING LIKE THAT. COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME. ALL HE HAD WAS THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD BECAUSE HIS PEOPLE WERE IN TROUBLE. OH, COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY PREACH back to me. Anybody with me this morning? Can we go ON A BIT? HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; MALACHI'S PLACEMENT WAS ALSO UNIQUE. Malachi's message &gt;&gt; was also important because it was after restoration. When you LOOK BACK AT ISAIAH AND JEREMIAH and Ezekiel, brother Terren, they were either warning of destruction, speaking in the midst of exile, TELLING THE PEOPLE, "DON'T GET INTO TROUBLE." BUT MALACHI WAS DIFFERENT. THE TEMPLE HAD BEEN RESTORED. THE PRIESTS HAD BEEN NOW BACK IN THEIR POSITION. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING STILL WRONG. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Isaiah had warned before captivity. Jeremiah had warned during collapse. Ezekiel had warned from exile. But Malachi was bringing a warning after restoration. The temple was rebuilt. But Malachi was there to say you could rebuild the temple and still have no fear of the Lord. We're going to get to it in scripture in a minute. Let's go to the Bible. Malachi 1 verse one and let's read the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. It's a burden. This is God having a burden. &gt;&gt; All through scripture, God has had a burden. He said, "I've heard the cries of my people and I've come down to deliver." Moses didn't have his own message. His message was in fact a burden of the Lord. God came down and the burden of the Lord became Moses burden. You don't hear me this morning. And Moses burden became a burden that he took HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILD AND SAID, "WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE PLACE WE RAN FROM BECAUSE I HAVE A BURDEN. YOU CAN'T OPERATE WITHOUT HAVING A BURDEN." SO WHEN MOSES GOT THERE, HE COME WITH A BURDEN. THUS SAID THE LORD, LET MY PEOPLE GO. AND THE BURDEN IN HIM COVERED HIS FEAR BECAUSE THE BURDEN WAS BIGGER THAN HIS FEAR. THE BURDEN WAS BIGGER THAN HIS PAST. THE BURDEN WAS BIGGER THAN HIS FAILURES. THE BURDEN WAS BIGGER THAN THE FACT THAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR HIM AS A WANTED MAN BECAUSE HE HAD A BURDEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO GOD. SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME THIS MORNING. EVERY PROPHET OF GOD HAD TO PREACH WITH A BURDEN. YOU CAN'T BE A PROPHET WITHOUT A BURDEN. YOU CAN'T BE A PASTOR WITHOUT A BURDEN BECAUSE A PASTOR IS A BURDEN BEARER. YOU CAN'T BE A MOTHER IF YOU CAN'T HAVE A BURDEN. BECAUSE AS A MOTHER, YOU OUGHT TO BE A BURDEN BEARER. OH, YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. WITHOUT A BURDEN, WE ARE FINISHED. &gt;&gt; But we live in A WORLD WITH FATHERS WITH NO BURDENS, MINISTERS with no burdens, deacons with no burdens, SONG LEADERS WITH NO BURDENS, CHILDREN WITH NO BURDENS. MALACHI. That's the only time we see his name in the Old Testament. And that's one verse right there. The burden of the word of the Lord. God needed a mouthpiece. Hallelujah. You know when Moses was around, he say don't let God speak, let Moses speak. So God can't come and speak to the people. He needed a mouthpiece. So he picked up a man called Malachi. Just as he picked up a man called William Brandom. He picked up a mouthpiece. He said, "Malachi, I have a burden and the word of the Lord IS MY BURDEN. GO AND SPEAK." &gt;&gt; They had already been restored, but Clarence THE TEMPLE ALREADY RESTORED. BUT CLARENCE, THE PRIESTS ALREADY PERFORMING DUTIES AND SACRIFICES, BUT GOD STILL SAY, "I WATCHING THE RESTORATION. I'M WATCHING DELIVERANCE. I'VE DONE ALL THESE THINGS WITH THE PEOPLE, BUT I STILL HAVE A BURDEN BECAUSE SOMETHING'S STILL NOT RIGHT. BUT I CAN'T LEAVE IT THIS WAY." BECAUSE THE BURDEN IN GOD COULDN'T HAVE HIM SIT DOWN AND WATCH THE PEOPLE FALL APART. THE BURDEN GOT HIM TO PICK SOMEBODY ELSE. &gt;&gt; And when you have a burden, you can't SIT STILL. WHEN YOU HAVE A BURDEN, YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. I KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A BURDEN. WE KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A BURDEN, YOU CAN'T WAIT TO COME TO CHURCH. YOU CAN'T MISS A PRAYER MEETING BECAUSE THE BURDEN DRIVES YOU TO THE ALTAR. THE BURDEN GETS YOU TO HOLD ON TO THE HALL OF THE ALTAR. THE BURDEN PUTS IT ASIDE AND CRY FOR THE ABOMINATION IN THE CITY. WHAT IS IT? IT'S A BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; What are you saying, preacher? When the word of God is preached, it should bring a burden. It should make you move. IT SHOULD MAKE YOU GROAN. IT SHOULD MAKE YOU TRAVAIL. UH IT SHOULD MAKE YOU SIGH. IT SHOULD MAKE YOU SAY, "LORD, DON'T PASS ME BY. SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE. I HAVE A BURDEN." THE WORD BEING PREACHED BRINGS A BURDEN. A BURDEN FOR LOST SOULS. A BURDEN FOR HEALING. A BURDEN FOR DELIVERANCE. A BURDEN TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT. Are we here this morning? &gt;&gt; The question is what what burden did God have? This wasn't Malachi's burden, church. This is God's burden. IS THE BURDEN of the word of the Lord &gt;&gt; to Israel by Malachi &gt;&gt; OR IN OTHER WORDS TO THE PROPHETIC CLASS OF THAT DAY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WASN'T SPEAKING TO EVERYBODY IN NO AGE DID GOD EVER SPEAK TO EVERYBODY WHEN MOSES WAS THERE HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE GENERATION THAT WAS GOING TO COME FROM THE PEOPLE IT WAS NOT TO THOSE people &gt;&gt; and this is God's burden I have loved you sayeth the Lord. Malachi is not speaking his words own words here. Now I have loved you sayeth the Lord. And Malachi is saying what the people are saying. Yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us? So this is the burden of God. NOW GOD IS SAYING I'VE LOVED YOU. But the people are saying, "What love you talking about? WHAT YOU MEAN YOU LOVE ME? And I have trials and I have testings." &gt;&gt; BUT THE BRANDON WOULD SPEAK ABOUT THIS IS ELECTIVE LOVE BEING DESCRIBED HERE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BRIGHT SKIES ARE NO SIGNS OF GOD APPROVAL AND DARK SKIES ARE NO SIGNS OF HIS DISAPPROVAL. BUT HIS APPROVAL is in the beloved. The audacity of man to say, "Lord, you really love me." That's what they were saying here. THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD IS TABERNACLE WITH A CURRENT IN MALACHI. &gt;&gt; AND GOD WANTS TO EXPRESS TO HIS PEOPLE, I HAVE LOVED YOU. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT GOD REALIZES IS THEY HAVE NOT ACCEPTED IT. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT GOD LOVED THEM. OH, YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. HE SAID, "I HAVE LOVED YOU." AND WHEN HE'S SAYING THAT, THEY'RE SAYING, "WHAT LOVE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M NOT FEELING THE LOVE. I DON'T KNOW THE LOVE." YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. HAVE YOU ACCEPTED THE LOVE OF GOD? THIS WAS THE LAST PROPHET OF THE OLD TESTAMENT. AND GOD WAS STILL HAVING ISSUES WITH THE PEOPLE ACCEPTING THE LOVE OF GOD. BECAUSE IF YOU ACCEPT THE LOVE OF GOD, THE MERCY OF GOD, THE GRACE OF GOD, IT'LL MAKE YOU MOVE DIFFERENT, TALK DIFFERENT, IT'LL MAKE YOU MORE LOVELY. IT'LL MAKE YOU MORE GRACIOUS. &gt;&gt; So I declare to you this morning THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD TO A PROPHETIC CLASS OF PEOPLE. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. THAT'S THE WORD OF THE LORD TO YOU THIS MORNING. I LOVE YOU IN YOUR FILTH, IN YOUR MISTAKES, IN YOUR SIN, IN YOUR CORRUPTION. IT'S AN ELECTIVE LOVE. IT'S A PERFECT LOVE. Have you accepted the love of God? &gt;&gt; People live this world trying to find love in all the wrong places. Looking for love in all the wrong places. LOOKING FOR AFFIRMATION, LOOKING FOR RECOGNITION, looking for acknowledgement, LOOKING FOR APPRECIATION, LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO TELL US SOMETHING GOOD. AND HERE IT IS AFTER ALL THESE YEARS OR EVERY SINGLE PROPHET GONE. HE'S NOT TO THE LAST MAN ON THE BOARD AND HE'S STILL SAYING THE FIRST THING. I HAVE LOVED you Israel. &gt;&gt; I've been TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT FROM GENESIS WHEN NOAH WAS HERE, WHEN ABRAHAM WAS HERE, WHEN MOSES WAS HERE, WHEN JOSHUA WAS HERE, WHEN ELIJAH WAS HERE, WHEN DANIEL WAS HERE, WHEN JEREMIAH WAS HERE, IT'S BEEN THE SAME MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; I love you. &gt;&gt; I'm coming for you. YOU ARE THE REASON. YOU ARE MY CHOICE. YOU ARE MY BRIDE. YOU ARE MY CHOSEN. MY LOVE IS BIGGER THAN YOU. MY LOVE IS BIGGER THAN YOUR FAILURES, BIGGER THAN YOUR SIN, BIGGER THAN YOU. I HAVE LOVED YOU. So don't come into the church. Lord, you really love me. He was saying to them, don't doubt my love for you. DON'T QUESTION MY LOVE FOR YOU. DON'T TAKE MY LOVE FOR YOU FOR GRANTED. OH, COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY HELP ME. HALLELUJAH. DON'T TRY TO MEASURE MY LOVE. ACCEPT IT FOR WHAT IT IS. I HAVE LOVED YOU. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU. LOVE LIFTED ME. FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, HE WOULD GIVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON. &gt;&gt; CHURCH, last Sunday of 2025. You may be seated. I always say God had choices. When you read the book of Matthew, the book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son, and it goes on and it lists the genealogy. In there, he lists Ruth. In there, he lists Tamar. In there, HE LISTS FIVE SISTERS AS IT WERE IN A time when female names not included. AND EVERY ONE OF THEM HAD ISSUES. RAHAB WAS IN THERE AS A PROSTITUTE. HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN A VIRGIN. HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN A SISTER WHO NEVER LEFT CHURCH. BUT HE CHOSE RAHAB. HE CHOSE TAMAR. HE CHOSE RUTH WHO WAS A MOABITIS BECAUSE IT WAS HIS ELECTIVE LOVE. HE HAS NEVER COME LOOKING TO FIND A PERFECT PEOPLE. HE TAKES IMPERFECT PEOPLE TO MAKE THEM PER OH, SOMEBODY HELP BACK TO ME. THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOD'S WAY. HE SAID, "THEY THAT ARE WELL HAVE NO NEED OF A PHYSICIAN. THEY THAT ARE OH, COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY HELP ME THIS MORNING. THE LOVE OF GOD, HOW RICH AND PURE. &gt;&gt; The very definition of God IS LOVE. THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE Lord &gt;&gt; to Israel. &gt;&gt; Malachi is standing there AND HE STARTS OFF BY ACCUSING THEM. LISTEN, I HAVE LOVED YOU SAYETH THE LORD. Yet ye say, &gt;&gt; not God saying. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING THINGS GOD DID NOT SAY. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS NEVER CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT LOVING YOU. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE REINTERPRETING THE WORD. OH, YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. HE SAID, "I LOVE YOU." AND THEY SAY, "WHEREIN?" HOW? HOW? SHOW ME. &gt;&gt; What do you mean by this thing? Anybody with me? And God answered them in a way to bully to prove the election of God. You see God don't need to defend himself. He said I have loved you sayeth the Lord yet he say so I want you to envision like a court case the accusations. You have here brother Clark Malachi saying I have loved you said the Lord. But the people responding what are you talking about? Wherein hast thou loved us? And then God through Malachi presents a rebuttal to the question how you love me. And the rebuttal is, was not Esau, Jacob's brother? And God start to unveil here a mystery about election and choice? Because before them boys was born, he say Jacob, I love, even I hate. AND IF I SAY I love you, I REALLY LOVE YOU. BECAUSE IF I HATE YOU, I WILL FINISH YOU. You don't hear me this morning. AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE NOT FINISHED MEANS I LOVE YOU. OH GOD, YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. BECAUSE IF I WANTED TO FINISH YOU, YOU HAVE BEEN FINISHED A LONG TIME AGO. BUT THE GRACE OF GOD IS THE EXPRESSION OF THE LOVE OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. IN OTHER WORDS, GOD DIDN'T SAY, "I love you. Look how I wake you up this morning and look how I give you food in your table and look how I put money in the bank account." And that's not how God expressed his love at all. his love. HE SHOWED THEM HOW GREAT HE IS. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "ALL THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHO I AM." WHEN I SAY I LOVE AND I HATE, WHAT I MEAN, HE SAID, "WASN'T it Esau, Jacob, brother?" He said, "IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND MY LOVE, LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT HATE LOOKS LIKE." BECAUSE HATE IS THE OPPOSITE OF LOVE. SO WHEN YOU SEE WHAT MY HATE LOOKS LIKE, TELL ME IF I LOVE YOU. HE SAID, "I HATED ESAU AND I LAID HIS MOUNTAINS AND HIS HERITAGE WASTE FOR THE DRAGONS OF THE WILDERNESS." &gt;&gt; But George, your heritage is not waste for the dragons of the wilderness. Your heritage is your children. Your heritage IS YOUR GRANDCHILDREN. OR SOMEBODY HELP ME THIS MORNING. HE SAID, "WHEREAS," LOOK AT GOD'S RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION, "HOW YOU LOVE ME?" AND GOD SAID, "LET ME SHOW YOU HOW WHAT THE OPPOSITE OF MY LOVE LOOKS LIKE." &gt;&gt; He said, "Whereas Edom," we preached this before. Edom is Esau. "Whereas Edom say it, we are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places. Thus say the Lord of hosts, they shall build, but I will throw down." In other words, they will never see the way. When God doesn't love you, you will never see your way. But when GOD LOVES YOU, YOU WILL BUILD AND IT WILL STAY STANDING. OH, COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME THIS MORNING. GOD SAYING, "THE ESAU I HATE, THEY SHALL BUILD, but I will throw down, and they shall call them the border of wickedness, and the people against whom the Lord hath indignation forever." and your eyes shall see and ye shall see the Lord WILL BE MAGNIFIED FROM THE BORDER OF ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you know the name of the Lord is great? &gt;&gt; The name of the Lord IS A MIGHTY TOWER. TODAY HE THE NAME OF THE LORD IS TERRIBLE &gt;&gt; CUZ HE DESTROYS THE WORKS OF DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY BE SEATED. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I heard somebody say recently, if you want to be feared, you have to be friends with the baddest man in the room or be the baddest man in the room. &gt;&gt; If you want to be feared, you need to be friends with the baddest man in the room or you be the baddest man in the room. Well, I got news for you. The God I serve is the baddest man in the room and he's my friend. HE'S MY FATHER. HE'S MY LORD. He's my king. HE'S THE KING OF KINGS. DON'T MESS WITH ME. HAVE YOU SEEN MY FRIEND? WHAT A FRIEND WE HAVE IN JESUS. ALL OUR SINS AND GRIEFS TO BEAR. LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIEND THIS MORNING. HE STICKS CLOSER THAN A BROTHER. I COULD LEAD ON HIS SHOULDER. YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. SOMEBODY GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT OF PRAISE. &gt;&gt; Could you take some more? &gt;&gt; Could you take some more? &gt;&gt; IT'S THE LAST SUNDAY OF THE YEAR WE GOING IN. So from verse one to verse five, God dealt with the issue of love. He said, "I love you. If I didn't love you, trust me, you wouldn't guess about you. You will know it." &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? I love you. If I didn't love you, you wouldn't be wondering. You will know it. BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE OF MY LOVE IS HATE. &gt;&gt; JACOB, I LOVE ESAU. I HATE AND I WIPE HIM OUT. HE CAN'T COP NOW. WE CAN'T CATCH HIS WAY. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU, you're still here. You're still in the HOUSE OF GOD. YOU MIGHT BE BROKEN, BRUISED, OR BATTERED, BUT YOU'RE STILL HERE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE MY LOVE IS ELECTIVE LOVE. AS MANY AS I LOVE, I REBUKE, I CHASEN, I CORRECT, I STRAIGHTEN OUT, BUT DON'T GET IT TWISTED. I LOVE YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO, there's a progression. Brother Clarence, &gt;&gt; bear in mind you could have issue with different prophets and tribe and the father and the but Malachi is different. We know nothing about the man. He just packing a burden. So he he starts almost top down. He start with the love of God as the first accusation in this courtroom. Brother Steven and he goes deeper. Are you with me? Anybody sleeping? Just look and look person next to you and make sure everybody awake. &gt;&gt; GOD THROUGH Malachi and he says in verse six, "A son honorth his father and a servant his master." Now I want us to look at the word honor. Because if you are a son, do you honor your father? God is making an assumption here through Malachi that sons honor their fathers because the assumption is a foundation for where he wants to go next. So I want to tell you, you're really out of pocket if you're not honoring your father. and as a servant honoring your master because that is scripture. Anybody here? &gt;&gt; Now we have nobody to get vexed with in Malachi because we know nothing about him. We don't know his address. We don't know his tribe. We don't know his location. So don't get vexed with me or with him. You can't find him. You can't find me. He said, son honorth his father and a servant his master. IF THEN I be a father. &gt;&gt; This is God talking NOW BECAUSE I WATCHING WHAT HAPPENING AND I SEEING SONS honoring fathers and SERVANTS HONORING MASTERS. IF I BE A father where is my honor? &gt;&gt; Do we still honor the Lord? BECAUSE WHAT GOD WAS SEEING, BROTHER GEORGE, IS I'm not getting the honor. I'm watching and in the human context, I'm seeing honoring taking place, but I'm not seeing the equivalent honor to me because I'm watching the natural man operating in their homes. I see what they do for Christmas. They buy Christmas gift, they do this, THEY HAVE THING AND ALL THAT HAPPEN IN THE CARNAL REALM. What about me? How could we have God asking where is my honor? This is the burden of the word of the Lord through the last prophet of the Old Testament. In other words, as you said, before God drops the mic, before the last prophet finishes speaking AND BEFORE GOD SAYS AFTER THIS, I'M DONE TALKING. BECAUSE WHEN MALACHI FINISHED 400 YEARS OF SILENCE, THE ONLY person who CAME AFTER HIM WAS THE LORD HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; The next prophet that came after Malachi, everybody, the Lord Jesus Christ, A SON OF MAN. &gt;&gt; JOHN WAS JUST A FORERUNNER. JOHN WAS THE appetizer to the meal. &gt;&gt; JOHN WAS JUST CLEARING THE PATH. JOHN WAS ROLLING ON THE RED CARPET. But when God was done, he said after man, I have nothing to say because I I can't leave man to deal with this anymore because I need to come for myself. You don't hear me this morning. Malachi ended the age of the Old Testament prophets AND FOR 400 YEARS GOD SAY no more talking. Can we go on? The Lord saying, and I want you to get this, a son honoreth his father. I hope you're with me. I hope you &gt;&gt; and a servant his master. If then I be a father, where is mine honor? And if I be a master, where's my fear? Say the Lord of hosts unto you, oh priests that despise my name. The Lord speaking of Can we go on? And the same way in the first time they asked, "How you love us? These people don't even know how to despise his name. So they ask the question and you say wherein have we despised thy name? Listen to this now church. Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar and ye say on top OF THAT TO SHOW YOU HOW PEOPLE DON'T EVEN understand the sacredness of the things of God. the sacred because you are priest in your home. YOU ARE ROYAL PRIESTHOOD. SO THIS is addressing the old testament priests but we are priests in our own right. So there's an application to us here now. Are we together? You offer polluted bread upon mine altar and you say wherein have we polluted thee? In that you say the table of the Lord is contemptable. In other words, you don't have to pay it much mind. You can come to church how you want. You could approach the house of God any way. As a priest, you don't have to take things too seriously. It's not that serious. Verse eight. AND HE OFFERED THE BLIND FOR SACRIFICE. Is it not evil? What is he referring to here? You would remember church that when the priest had to offer a lamb for a house, you had to inspect the lamb to make sure there was no blemish. The lamb wasn't crippled, there was no deformity. It had to be a perfect lamb. He was saying, "You are so backsliden. Nobody could accuse you of not bringing your offering or your sacrifice, but what you bring is not worthy. IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S A FORM OF GODLINESS, but denying the power. So you you can say, well, but I was in church, but how are you in church? BUT I BRING A SACRIFICE. WHAT SACRIFICE DID you bring? BECAUSE THE SACRIFICE SUPPOSED TO BE WITHOUT BLEMISH. It's supposed to BE A PURE SACRIFICE. SO LISTEN TO GOD. ADDRESSING THE WAY THAT THEY APPROACH NOW AND I WANT TO BRING it to the message. If you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if you offer the lame and THE SICK, IN OTHER WORDS, they're just doing the priestly duty and they they don't care. Anything is anything. You have a lamb, bring it. They're not even inspecting it anymore. Are we together? They lost the sincerity. They lost the burden. They lost the sacredness. It's not that THEY DON'T KNOW BETTER. THEY KNOW BETTER, but they're not doing better. And we'll see now a scripture in a short while. And listen, and this I want to bring this to a point here because we talk about son, father, servant, master. And then God through Malachi SAYING, "OFFER IT NOW UNTO THY GOVERNOR." In other words, the government you're treating better than me. often if now unto the governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person said the Lord of hosts SO GOD IS USING OTHER WORDS TO SAY YOU YOU'RE NOT even going to do that for the government BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOUSE of God anything is anything say the Lord of hosts and now I pray you beseech God that he will be gracious unto us this had been by your means will regard your person, said the Lord of hosts. Who is there even among you in verse 10 that should that would shut the doors for not? In other words, he's saying who will scream to shut it down so you don't do this filthiness. In other words, someone to shut down the foolishness. Say enough is enough. Is there even among you that would shut the doors for not. Neither do ye kindle fire on my altar for not. I have no pleasure in you, said the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. And this is where we get the scripture. FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering. For my name shall be great among the heathen, say the Lord of hosts. But ye have profained it in that ye say the Lord, the table of the Lord is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even his meat is contemptable. And listen to this part. He said also, behold, what a weariness is it. In other words, he is saying the church is saying this thing tiring boy God watching their attitude towards the things of God and he's saying you say what is so much work had to go into this thing so much effort so much sacrifice so much praying so much seeking so much reading so much work into the ministry. So much work into this thing. Talk about the spirit of the age that we're dealing with. And he have snuffed at it, sayeth the Lord of hosts. And he brought that which was torn and the lame and the sick. Thus he brought an offering. Should I accept this of your hand? Say the Lord. Verse 14. But curse be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male and voweth and sacrifice it unto the Lord a corrupt thing. What is God saying here? He's saying in other words, you are not giving God your best. You're choosing to give God the extra whatever remain. You're giving God the extra time, the extra resources, the after YOU FIX UP YOURSELF and your family. Whatever left over is what God get. &gt;&gt; He say CURSED BE THE MAN WHO HAVE SOMETHING THAT HE COULD OFFER to the Lord and instead OF OFFERING YOUR BEST TO THE LORD, you just offering something AND YOU HAVE BETTER to give. In other words, you have more time, more commitment, you have more interest. So something. So this is why it HAS TO BE A BURDEN TO YOU TO RECOGNIZE. Am I doing enough for the Lord? I was about to say I have too much more left. But but over say preacher before I can even get this. But the reason I'm saying this is we're coming to the end of another year and I want you to ask yourself the question, did I give the Lord my best in this? Did I really give the Lord my best? Did I really give God his honor? That's due to his name. If you were to order, you know, when you go to school, you have a end of term report. If there was a end of year report for 2025 and God was saying let me how this brother did for the year. How the sister did for the year. Let me give end the year report of who really give their all. They really give their all in prayer and worship and their offering and their tithes and their support to the church and ministry and prayer and offering themselves and not just the way they want to but in every aspect. They have given God their all and their best and the first Not as you say blind and lame and you have a meal but you even give a meal because you're giving something else whatever you're just grabbing anything. In other words, you wake up in the morning to go to church and whoever just putting on anything and I'm going up and no sincerity, no passion, no zeal. This is not to accuse anybody. This is this is a reflection because this was the last message God left with the Old Testament before he say I'm not talking anymore. Jesus himself have to come to deal with what happens next. Anybody with me this morning? The burden of the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That last verse there, verse 14, be c but cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male and boweth and sacrifice it unto the Lord a corrupt thing. For I am a great king, sayeth the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heen. I don't think we're going to get to finish all of it in this service. I think I have to some Bible study. We can take a little more. We can take a little more. I will skip part of Malachi 2 and go to I want to go to 2 verse 10 before we move on to three and then we touch four. So Malachi 2 verse 10. Have we not all one father. So that is that's the word. Now have we not all one father? Have not one god created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaining the covenant of our fathers? Judah had dealt treacherously and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Jerusalem had profained the holiness of the Lord which he loved and had married the daughter of a strange court. So I'm placing it in scripture where brother Brandham says under no circumstance should a believer marry an unbeliever to show you this thing is all true scripture because God is saying aren't we brothers under the covenant? Why would you step outside of the covenant to marry someone of a strange God? Because the word is your defense. The scripture is your protection. If you don't understand these things, you'll find yourself in problems. Listen to God in verse 12. The Lord will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar out of the tabernacles of Jacob and him that offered an offering unto the Lord of hosts. Let's go on. He's coming into the home. It's a lot. Malachi dealt with it. Verse 14. Yet you say, "WHEREFORE, BECAUSE THE LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth," he coming into marriage now. YOU SEE, THE LORD IS WITNESS TO THE MARRIAGE. Against whom thou hast dealt treacherously, yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant, and did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit, and wherefore one, that you might seek a godly seed. Therefore, take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. FOR THE LORD, THE GOD OF ISRAEL, SAID HE HATED putting away. You see much stuff Malachi presents as the last message. Malachi 3 verse one, BEHOLD I WILL SEND MY messenger and he shall prepare the way before me. We know this is John the Baptist. And the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in. Behold he shall come say the Lord of hosts. But who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeared? For he is like a refiner's fire and like full of soap. And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver. AND HE SHALL PURIFY THE SONS OF LEVI AND PURGE THEM AS GOLD and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering of righteousness. So he was speaking now about the Lord Jesus himself coming now. Are we there? And when he comes, he will set everything right. When Jesus comes, he'll put everything in order. Verse four, then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant under the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years. And I will come near to you to judgment. And I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swears, and against those that oppress the hiling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, that turn aside a stranger from his right. and fear not me, sayeth the Lord of hosts, for I AM THE LORD. I CHANGE NOT. THEREFORE, YE sons of Jacob are not consumed. Are we together? Verse seven, even from the days of your fathers are ye gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them. So this whole passage of Malachi is trying to straighten out the people for whom God has done things from Genesis all the way to then. And God is going to put in the final statement before the Lord Jesus comes. Return unto me. If anybody has lost their way, return unto me. And he promises and I will return unto you. Friends, this is here is a promisory. He says, "Return unto me and I will return unto you, sayeth the Lord of hosts." But he said, "Wherein shall we return?" In other words, was the passage back to return. This is scripture. Then he goes on. So this is now all in context because people read scriptures in bits and pieces and they don't understand the context of God. Will a man rob God? Yet he have robbed me. But he say wherein have we robbed thee? tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed me even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now herewith, sayeth the Lord of hosts. SO THERE IS A ASPECT OF THIS THAT PEOPLE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND. WHEN YOU BRING YOUR TITHES AND OFFERINGS, YOU HAVE TO NOW prove God. Hold him to his word. PROVE ME NOW HEREWITH. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY, I want to prove you, Lord, BECAUSE I'M DOING YOUR WORD. ALL OF THIS, I WANT YOU TO STUDY THIS out for yourself because you have to know this. Prove me. Now, hear it, say the Lord of hosts. If in doing this, I will not open you the windows of heaven. So, there is a blessing in obedience. This is why obedience is better THAN SACRIFICE BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT TO OBEY. BUT HERE IN THE SHOW, PROVE ME. IN other words, put me to the test. Do this and watch me work for you. This is the word now. Say, IF I WILL NOT OPEN YOU THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN, LISTEN, AND POUR YOU OUT A BLESSING THAT THERE shall not be room enough to receive it. Listen church, this was the burden of the word of the Lord. So this was important to God to ensure that the people understand that they are the only ones hindering their blessing here. He said, "Return unto me. If that's on you, return to me. I'll return to you. CLEAN UP YOUR SACRIFICE. UNDERSTAND MY LOVE. DO YOUR PART. I'LL DO MY PART. Prove me. AND SEE IF THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN DON'T GET OPENED UP FOR YOU TILL YOU HAVE BLESSING THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN RECEIVE. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't end there. He says in doing this, he said, "And I will rebuke the devourer." So it's not even up to you to rebuke the devourer. What is the devourer? That thing draining out your life, eating out your resources, eating out your mind, eating out devouring you. word or I will rebuke the for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground. You trying to do things in this world, you trying to achieve things and there's a destruction of the fruit of the ground. Neither shall your vine cast off fruit before the time in the field. In other words, you're expecting a crop is a TYPE HERE AND BEFORE THE TIME IT MASH UP. He's saying there's a PRINCIPLE IN THERE BECAUSE GOD THROUGHOUT EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS WHAT GOD IS LOOKING FOR your best to know the best your best worship your best attitude put God first people put in there he he blasted there you putting the government first you're putting your employer first you're putting your family first you're putting everything else first and God is BEING SECOND PLACE IN EVERY ONE OF THESE scriptures I trust out of this service you will leave here pledging to put God first not just in well I love God or no put God against your job. Put God first over your family. Put God first over the government. Put God first over your marriage. Put God first over your children. Put God first over your finances. PUT GOD FIRST OVER THE DOCTOR. PUT GOD FIRST OVER EVERY OPPRESSION. PUT GOD FIRST. AND WATCH EVERY PRINCIPALITY. BOW. WATCH EVERY SITUATION. BOW. HE SAID, "SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WILL BE ADDED UNTO YOU." THAT IS STILL THE WORD OF THE LIVING GOD. AND IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME TO GO BACK TO THE WORD, IT'S NOW. &gt;&gt; He said, "I WILL REBUKE THE DEVOURER." SO, IN OTHER WORDS, GOD BATTLE FOR YOU ONCE YOU PUT HIM FIRST. &gt;&gt; It is not that God needs you to do things, but God's love for you comes with something. You tell me you love God. How you love God? By you have to show it. You have to do things. You have to act it. AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A LEVEL OF FAITH AND TRUST IN GOD. &gt;&gt; But you want to trust yourself and trust your ability and trust what you could do and trust what you could achieve. And God is saying, "Put me first and watch me work. Acknowledge me in all your ways and I will direct your path. You don't know how to go, acknowledge me. You don't know what to do, acknowledge me. You don't know where to go, acknowledge me. You don't know how to approach your situation, BRING ME BRING ME IN. BRING ME IN. PUT HIM ON YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. COME ON NOW, SOMEBODY HELP ME. PUT HIM IN YOUR CAR AND WATCH HIM WORK. &gt;&gt; INVITE HIM INTO YOUR HOUSE AND WATCH HIM WORK. DON'T LEAVE HIM OUTSIDE. HE WANTS FULL PERMISSION TO move into your life. Move into your heart. GOD HAS SAID, "WHERE'S MY HONOR? Where is my honor?" Is there honor for the Lord in your home? I'm not trying to make you feel guilty or feel bad, but over the Christmas season, could the Lord have walked into your home? Could you have invited him to your Christmas lunch? Would you have been comfortable him to sit at the table of your Christmas dinner? If it wasn't that way this year, fix it. &gt;&gt; Because he promised to come suddenly into this temple. If you're not going to honor God, who will? Because the world not going to do it? Honor me with your time, with your effort. See, I say to young people, what what job you have, what education you have. If God didn't give you brains to write an exam, you could study all you want and if your brain shut up in the exam day, write nothing. If your hand freeze in the exam room, you write nothing. If it's not for the grace of God, you have nothing to write. Nothing to get. Nothing to do. YOU HAVE NO CREDIT TO GET. IT'S NOT YOURS. IT'S THE LORD'S DOING. IT'S NOT YOUR CAR. IT'S THE LORD'S CAR. THAT'S FOR HIS GLORY AND HIS HONOR. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T ICE. Do you understand? In this realm, nothing belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? Nothing belongs to you. You don't even belong to you. &gt;&gt; YOU BELONG TO GOD. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING BELONGS TO GOD. YOUR BODY IS A TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST. YOUR BODY BELONGS TO GOD. YOUR HOUSE BELONGS TO GOD. YOUR CAR BELONGS TO GOD. YOUR CHILDREN BELONG TO GOD. Honor him &gt;&gt; AND WATCH GOD BLESS YOU. People want to honor God in part. Honoring God is honoring his word. People leave quotes of well you have to have a home church. That is the word. How you operate out of a home church. How you operate outside the five-fold ministry who are ordained for the perfecting of the saints, the work of the ministry until we all COME IN. HOW YOU GOING TO STEP OUT OF THAT AND FEEL going into into the rapture is delusional? I don't want to be bad, but you realize there are more people outside of I didn't say it. Let it not be said, I said it. It have more people outside and inside wherever that place is because a spirit of delusion because people want to the god of their own imagination. It's either you want God or you don't want God. It's either you believe the message or you do not believe the message. It's either you want to go into the rapture, you don't want TO GO TO THE RAPTURE. IS IT YOU ACCEPT ALL THE WORD OR YOU'RE PLAYING GAMES? And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground. Neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, sayeth the Lord of hosts. And all nation shall call you blessed, for ye shall be a delightome land, sayeth the Lord of hosts. You don't want that blessing. Young people, listen here now. Verse 13. Your words have been stout against me, sayeth the Lord. Stout means harsh. In other words, you have spoken harsh against God. So God is weighing what you say about him. You know the other day I tease my daughter and I say we have church this even church again don't worry she under the age of account she's six but many times but you know young people if you tell them we go and lime again or we going and have a fun time again you say let's go as brother Andrew Glover preached He said when you have an expectation with even when you go to sleep you remember the expectation. If I tell my daughter we go to walk the park in the morning and I tell in the night when you wake up in the morning the first thing you say daddy we still going to the park sleep air change the expectation or many of us have tiresome it is we have church again after I went to Uganda in September and had 17 services in three four days. It redefined what tiredness ever looked like. You know, it was four services per day. Sister Emran, to be honest, when I saw the schedule, I'm a faith shaker. And I'm a preacher. I don't want to say I had unbelief, but it was it was close. four services a day and I had a morning devotion before the four services. I asked the host pastor I said the ministers need to go to the morning devotion because we had flown in the night was got very early in the morning. What time in the morning was it on? Friday. I think it was 5 a.m. But it reframes you because by the time I got there into the service, well, he gave us a pass on that particular that morning wipes out. But by the last service reach, I was blown away at the zeal and the enthusiasm of the people. And you know what was amazing and mind-blowing? The place we had the meeting was a school with almost like a uh you know one of those like beaches. So it's like seats into like a stadium. But at Pwell there was no back to the seat. So you couldn't lean back. Maybe that's what we need. Maybe that's what we need. Maybe church just too comfortable. But with Lynon 16 services with no back rest. You either you have to be on your toes. You have to be on your toes. But it's an awareness because when you realize and this is why for some of us God has to treat us and put us in certain places because if things all right our nature is to get lazy and comfortable and complacent but when you go to places where people have it tough and they're rough and the situation is there and you have to now trust God because you really don't know where your next meal coming from. And there's a level of gratefulness with I don't know how it worked out but it worked out is a different operation. So this is why sometimes God allows situation to come and is unfortunate because sometime it takes sickness to get us more sincere. It takes something happening with the family. It takes losing job. It happen with your wife. WHATEVER IT IS TO DRIVE US BECAUSE GOD SAYS nothing must take the place of relationship with you and I. I AM YOUR FATHER. I AM YOUR LORD. I AM YOUR SUPPLIER. How could God be the source of your supply? But you more respectful to your boss on the job. And the Bible say give honor to the boss in the job. But the honor for God must be higher than brother but George is a lesson to all of us to know because people freed. You see how the Bible said in Malachi where is my fear? God asked the question would he say if I'm a master where is my fear people fear to reach later on in the job and you see we looking like we heading into recession here now people job on the line our oil production is lower our gas production is lower they just come January the 1st they're going to raise import duties customs duties this in the news what does that mean it means economically the cost of everything being imported will now be more exp expensive So what what who who who you going to trust? But I can guarantee you if God opened doors for you, then no man could trust it enough. If it have five deals to get in your business and it have 15 competitors, if God on your side, brother Papwell, God make it that when you drive down the road, BY THE TIME YOU DROP ONE PERSON OFF HERE, THE PERSON WAITING RIGHT there to go in and WHEN YOU GO LOWER DOWN, somebody leaves, SOMEBODY ELSE COME IN. ALL THEM OTHER MAXIM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HE ALWAYS IS DOING THAT. BUT THE LORD CLEARING A PATH, SLOWING DOWN CARS HERE, STOPPING TRAFFIC LIGHT HERE. YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. GOD IS ABLE TO ENSURE THAT YOU ARE BLESSED WHEN YOU PUT HIM FIRST. THAT'S HIS OBLIGATION TO YOU. HE SAID, "I WILL REBUKE THE DEVOURER. ANYTHING COMING AFTER YOU, I WILL COME AFTER IT. I WILL REBUKE IT MYSELF. I WILL STOP THE ATTACK OF THE ENEMY. THAT'S THE COVERING UNDER WHICH I WANT TO LIVE ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; We sing this song. I don't feel no way tired. Friends, I'm not talking about tiredness of body here because we will get tired. Jesus got tired. But you can't get tired of the mission. You can't get tired of the call upon your life. &gt;&gt; Yes, you get physically tired. You're you're human. Let's not let's not paint the picture that you in church and you didn't work. You woke the whole night in church and I No, no. Humanness. There'll be tired moments, but don't get tired of this fight. Don't get tired of the prayers. Don't get tired of the promise. Don't get tired of the word of the Lord. Don't get tired being IN THE MESSAGE. DON'T GET TIRED BELIEVING. DON'T GET TIRED ON OF HOLDING ON FOR THE PROMISE OF GOD FOR YOUR FAMILY TO BE DELIVERED. DON'T GET TIRED OF THAT. DON'T GET TIRED OF WAITING FOR YOUR HEALING. LET IT NOT BE A WEARY SOMETHING. YOUR FAMILY HAS GOT TO COME. YOUR HEALING HAS GOT TO COME. YOUR BREAKTHROUGH HAS GOT TO COME. GOD IS GOING TO REWARD YOU. &gt;&gt; THEY THAT WAIT UPON THE LORD SHALL renew their strength. &gt;&gt; The musician going to get ready. I'm almost done. HALLELUJAH. HOLD THE LINE. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Hold the line. We're not giving up. We're not giving up. We're not giving UP THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD TO A prophetic class of people. Your words, verse 13 in chapter three, your words have been stout against me. God saying you have been harsh against me. Why are you talking about me like that? Yet you say what have we spoken so much against thee? So God is saying all you're saying things about me in a harsh way and people saying but what are you talking about? Ye have said it is vain to serve God. This is like young people saying but why I should go to church and God sees it as a harsh statement. Yet it is vain to serve. And what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts? And now we call the proud happy. Y they that work within this asset of Y that temp God are even delivered. I want to dig into this a little bit before we close out. In the amplified it says your words have been harsh against me says the Lord. But you say what have we spoken against you? You have said it is useless to serve God. What profit is it if we keep his ordinances and walk around like mourers before the Lord of hosts? Being a Christian is boring. When you say foolish just like that, God is saying what kind of harsh thing you say. We walk like mourers sad and and we don't have any fun. So now we call the arrogant happy and blessed. evildoers are exalted and prosper and when they test God they escape unpunished. So God is saying that's the kind of stuff Paul is saying that I find offensive. Be very careful what you say. Be very careful how you see things because sometime only experiences come to reframe your view. Because David found himself in the same spot TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE AROUND THEM AND WHAT GOD HAS ASKED HIM, have you considered their end? YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW BLESSED THIS ONE IS AND HOW BLESSED I WAS. HAVE YOU considered their end looking after THE THINGS I WANT TO HAVE FUN, I WANT TO ENJOY LIFE. The most foolish things you hear young people say, well, they tell their parents, well, when you was young, you get to live and then decide what you want to do. &gt;&gt; Nonsense. the grace of God to you that your parents could be in this thing THAT YOU NEVER HAVE TO GO and taste this thing. &gt;&gt; Taste the world &gt;&gt; until people make the missing and cross a line from which they could never return BECAUSE YOU OPERATE AS YOU COULD WALK OUT FROM God and come back whenever you want. There are people who have walked out and never made it back. walked out from the grace of God and never made it back. THEY CAN'T EVEN COME BACK BECAUSE THEY ALREADY CROSSED THE LINE. THERE'S NO HOPE FOR THEM. THAT'S THE PROPHET'S WORD. I'm seeing a DAY WHEN THERE'LL BE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE ALTAR CRYING OUT FOR GOD, BUT THEY HAVE DONE CROSSED THE LINE. NO MORE MERCY FOR THEM. THIS IS WHY THE BIBLE SAID, "SEEK YE THE LORD WHILE HE MAY BE FOUND. CALL UPON HIM WHILE HE IS NEAR." THERE'S A TIME LIMIT FOR MERCY. You want to go see the world and even when you step OUT THE DOOR SHUTS BEHIND YOU AND WHEN THEY TRY TO COME IN YOU CAN'T EVEN COME IN ANYMORE. DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH THE WORLD. Don't take church for granted. Don't take this gospel for granted. Don't take mercy for granted. DON'T TAKE SIN FOR GRANTED. DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. THERE'S A TIME LIMIT. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE, YOUNG BROTHER. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE, YOUNG SISTER. THE JUDGMENT IS BEING HELD BACK. HE SAYS, "SEAL UP THE FOUR WINDS. &gt;&gt; PUT A MARK UPON THOSE THAT SIGH AND CRY FOR THE ABOMINATION IN MY CITY AND BEGIN AT my sanctuary at the ancient men at those who have sat IN THE MESSAGE FOR ALL THESE YEARS." God took offense for how they SPOKE ABOUT HIS LOVE AND HIS MERCY AND HIS grace and say it's a sad thing. Christians don't have no fun. ALL THE BOYS OUTSIDE LYING AND I IN HERE I have to be in a zoom prayer meeting. I have to have a Bible study. I could never get to do what I want. NOBODY THINK ANYTHING AND ALL THAT NONSENSE. AND YOU PARENTS THERE NOT EVEN BLASTING IT IN YOUR HOME AND SAY THE DEVIL IS AFTER YOU. THE DEVIL WANTS YOU BUT NOT IN THIS HOUSE. Not in this house. &gt;&gt; Some of you parents ARE TOO WEAK. NO BACKBONE. No backbone. &gt;&gt; THERE'S DEATH HANGING OVER THE YOUNG PEOPLE. DEATH. The devil himself. THE DEVIL NOT AFTER THE WORLD. HE HAS THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; HE HAS THEM IN THE WORLD. HE HAS NICKI MINAJ. HE HAS BEYONCE. HE HAS ALL OF THEM. Many have already given THEIR SOULS TO THE DEVIL. They could never be delivered, NEVER BEEN REDEEMED. BUT YOU, THERE'S A PROMISE OVER YOU OF REDEMPTION, OF THE HOLY GHOST, OF ADOPTION, OF THE POWER OF GOD COMING INTO YOU TO CHANGE YOU. BUT YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO SAY, "We mourning. We have no fun. Die young, die rich, die foolish. &gt;&gt; You have the opportunity to speak to someone incarcerated, someone on a bed, shut up. Somebody sick in a bed and hear what THEY SAY. THE MONEY DOESN'T MATTER. The girls doesn't matter. The popularity DOESN'T MATTER. THE FOLLOWERS DOESN'T MATTER. IT HAS NO MATTER BECAUSE THEY FACE DEBT. AND WHEN THEY FACE DEATH, THEY REALIZE THEIR MORTALITY. Where is my fear? The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The fear of the Lord will make a husband love his wife. The fear of the Lord will make a wife reverence A HUSBAND. THE FEAR OF THE LORD will make children obey their parents. The fear of THE LORD WILL MAKE YOU LISTEN TO THE DEACON. THE FEAR OF THE LORD WILL MAKE YOU WORSHIP. THE FEAR OF THE LORD WILL MAKE YOU PRAY. THE FEAR OF THE LORD WILL MAKE YOU FORGIVE. THE FEAR OF THE LORD WILL BRING YOU INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHERE IS MY FEAR? WHERE IS MY HONOR?" &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. What profit is it that we have kept his ordinance? &gt;&gt; Bible said, "What profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?" You want to talk about profit? People rushing into marriage, rushing into this, rushing into this without prayer, without advice. At the same TIME, PEOPLE RUSHING OUT OF IT. Because if GOD IS NOT THERE, IT'LL FAIL. IF GOD IS NOT THERE, IT'LL FALL APART. WITHOUT GOD, YOU'RE FINISHED. THE WHOLE BOOK OF MALACHI IS ABOUT WHAT GOD WANTS TO DO, WHAT GOD WANTS TO SAY, WHAT GOD WANTS TO ACHIEVE. Your gift, your talent, your expertise is a gift from God. &gt;&gt; Gifts and callings are without repentance. God is not going to take the gift back, but he could shut down the gift. He has done it to many. Oh yes. Oh yes. He could shut down the gift. Judas had power and God shut him down because he was the son of predition. He walked with Jesus. He healed the sick with Jesus. He was in the upper room with Jesus. He was there in the church WITH JESUS. AND HE HAS BEEN STRICKEN. HIS NAME WRITTEN OFF. There is a limit to grace. There's a limit to mercy. I'm trying to close out, but maybe somebody in here is about to go free in a way you've never been free before because has NOTHING WITH YOUR FATHER, YOUR MOTHER, THE DEACON, THE TITOR. NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. BUT YOU, IF YOU'RE ON THE WAY TO HELL, I CHALLENGE YOU. FIX IT today before it's too late. Between now and early as night, there people will not see the new year. We speak positive. see you in a new year. This will not see it. They will not see it because God's will already cut them off. Whether good, whether bad, indifferent, and the things they should have said, the things they should have fixed, the things they should have made right, they have not made it right. And however that picture is taken, that picture now becomes unchangeable. Nothing else could change. Church, if you have things to fix, fix it today. Fix it today. Don't wait until tomorrow. Don't carry stuff into 2026. Your healing depends on it. Your deliverance depends on it. Your breakthrough depends on it. Mercy depends on it. Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Verse 16 of Malachi 3. I know many of you, you only know Malachi, Malachi 4:5 and 6. And we haven't touched all of it. We skipped through some parts. But is it why you have to study scripture? Because when you do, then when the winds blow, you're rooted and grounded in the love of God. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Glory. Verse 16. Then they that fear the Lord. Do we have any that fear the Lord in the house? Not a scared he fear but the fear of the Lord because he is holy. &gt;&gt; The fear of the Lord because we are unworthy. The fear of the LORD BECAUSE WE ARE SINNERS. THE FEAR OF THE LORD BECAUSE HE IS GOD AND HE CAN STRIKE YOU DOWN AT ANY POINT IN TIME. BUT IF IT'S NOT FOR HIS LOVE AND HIS MERCY AND HIS GRACE AND HIS PREDESTINATION, WE ARE FINISHED. &gt;&gt; We fear the Lord. Then they that fear the Lord spake often one to another. And the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the Lord. And that thought upon his name, just thinking on his name, there's a blessing in there. Just to think about him, just to TALK ABOUT HIM, JUST TO FELLOWSHIP ABOUT HIM, JUST TO BE IN HIS PRESENCE, JUST TO BE IN ATMOSPHERE JUST TO GREET YOUR BROTHER AND SAY, "THE LORD IS GOOD. THE LORD IS MERCIFUL. HEALING IS COMING. DELIVERANCE IS COMING. A REVIVAL. THERE'S SOMETHING BUBBLING IN YOUR SOUL. ALL OF THIS IS BEING MEASURED. YOUR LIFE CANNOT JUST BE politics and the news and Venezuela and Trump and this. But when your conversation become the king coming suddenly to his temple WHEN YOUR LIFE BECOMES I'm looking to come to my home not just a church I would say come to my HOUSE OH GOD FIND MY HOUSE LORD COME TO MY HOUSE MEET ME WHEN I'M DRIVING IN THE CAR MEET ME WHEN I'M WALKING IN THE BANK MEET ME WHEN I'm &gt;&gt; if you ever needed a Lord is now I'm trying to close out &gt;&gt; Hallelujah verse seven and they shall shall be mine, say the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels, AND I WILL SPARE THEM as a man spareth HIS OWN SON THAT SERVETH HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Listen to that verse in the amplified. They shall be mine, says the Lord of hosts. Who shall be mine? those that fear the Lord, those that sing upon his name, those that talk about him, those that make HIM A PRIORITY, THOSE THAT LOVE THE WORD, THOSE THAT LOVE THE BRETHREN, THOSE THAT LOVE THE FELLOWSHIP, THOSE THAT LOVE THE HOUSE OF GOD, THOSE THAT LOVE THE THINGS OF GOD, THOSE THAT LOVE THE WORSHIP OF GOD, THEY SHALL BE MINE, SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS. ON THAT DAY. LISTEN, when I publicly recognize them and openly declare them to be MY OWN POSSESSION, THAT IS MY VERY SPECIAL TREASURE. &gt;&gt; Then shall you return in verse 18 and discern between the righteous and the wicked. Don't you know the saints will judge the earth? Then shall you return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth not. Because you will not be judged. You're already judged. HALLELUJAH. AND THE last chapter of Malachi, we'll close with this. For behold, the day cometh. So Malachi without knowing his tribe, his family, his background, his trade, where he lived, the house he had, whether he was married or not, if he had children or not, we know nothing about him. But yet within his ministry, he speaks about Christ. John the Baptist, Brother Brandham, he speaks about judgment. He speaks about redemption. He speaks about grace. He speaks about love. He speaks about mercy. HE SPEAKS ABOUT PROMISE, THE FEAR OF THE LORD. HE SPEAKS ABOUT WISDOM. He speaks to the YOUNG PEOPLE. HE SPEAKS TO THE CALEBS. TALK ABOUT THE GREATEST WAY TO END THE OLD TESTAMENT. Isn't God good? &gt;&gt; For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yay, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble. They'll be burnt. Who? All the proud. And all that do wickedly shall be stubble. and the day that come it shall burn them up, say the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. BUT UNTO YOU THAT FEAR MY NAME SHALL THE SON OF RIGHTEOUSNESS ARISE WITH HEALING IN his wings, and he shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall, AND HE SHALL TREAD DOWN THE WICKED, FOR THEY SHALL be ashes under the shoulder of your feet in the day that I shall do this, sayeth the Lord OF HOSTS. REMEMBER YE the law of Moses my servant which I commanded UNTO HIM IN HOREB FOR ALL ISRAEL WITH THE STATUTES AND JUDGMENTS.
