[6:23] amen
[6:24] uh certainly happy to be here tonight on
[6:28] another tuesday night for our
[6:29] our bible study and um
[6:32] it's not a preaching service it is a
[6:34] study around scripture
[6:36] where we go to the sacred scriptures and
[6:39] we encourage one another
[6:40] around the word of god and you know we
[6:43] fulfill
[6:44] that part of that responsibility that we
[6:47] should all be undertaking to meditate
[6:50] on the word day and night and i trust
[6:52] that
[6:53] in your own uh secret closet as it were
[6:56] your own
[6:57] personal time that you take
[7:00] heed to the word of god and you get
[7:02] encouragement
[7:03] from how god has operated uh through
[7:06] time and
[7:06] and how he has unfolded himself in in in
[7:09] so many ways
[7:10] are so certainly happy to see everybody
[7:13] here out tonight
[7:14] and certainly want to welcome i see
[7:16] brother kelly salt is here certainly
[7:17] want to welcome you on by the nick
[7:18] edmonds
[7:19] and i i don't know mr lois is here as
[7:21] well we certainly welcome you
[7:23] uh to our bible study tonight happy to
[7:25] have you here with us all from
[7:27] uh in the us so we we thank you for
[7:29] joining us tonight
[7:30] and our our church uh for
[7:33] being faithful to the cause and the call
[7:36] of the gospel
[7:37] um we don't take it for granted there
[7:39] are a lot of
[7:40] things that we could be doing but we
[7:42] respond to the call
[7:44] towards getting closer to god it is what
[7:46] sustains us it is what
[7:47] drives us and to know that we read the
[7:50] bible
[7:50] not as you know someone reading it from
[7:53] an intellectual perspective
[7:55] but we thank god for the prophetic
[7:57] ministry and message
[7:58] of william branham that messenger of
[8:01] malachi 4 5 and 6 in luke 17 30
[8:04] revelation 10 7 that we could read from
[8:07] this book as an open book
[8:09] and we can go through and see you know
[8:11] how about ibrahim brought certain things
[8:13] out
[8:13] and see how we can now take this in our
[8:16] daily lives because
[8:17] the reality is is god is interested
[8:21] in every aspect of our lives he's
[8:23] interested in our spiritual walk he's
[8:25] interested in our
[8:26] you know our natural work he's
[8:27] interested in the very simple things
[8:29] um in life you know and and and once you
[8:32] catch that balance and that focus
[8:34] and you realize that he is in in every
[8:37] aspect of our lives it
[8:38] it makes us so conscious and it also
[8:40] humbles us and makes us so grateful
[8:43] that we are we become totally dependent
[8:45] upon him you know so
[8:47] tonight i uh want to spend some time in
[8:51] the book of second kings
[8:53] and uh i had of i have if i call it a
[8:56] mean
[8:56] text but um i i went this evening
[9:00] to to kind of do a little background to
[9:02] it
[9:03] and i was saying that when you read this
[9:05] it's like
[9:06] it is really bible days or special days
[9:10] god knows god knows what day to put us
[9:12] in
[9:13] you know but when you read through
[9:15] particularly the old testament and so
[9:17] how those days were
[9:18] you know sometimes you say you have
[9:20] trials and you have testing that when
[9:21] you read what
[9:22] what uh took place in those times you
[9:25] know
[9:26] it makes you really see god knows who to
[9:29] put where and how and what their purpose
[9:31] is
[9:31] and and how this whole big plan of
[9:33] redemption would come together
[9:35] and how god would see it fit that little
[9:38] you little me
[9:39] could be the final you know leg of this
[9:42] really race
[9:43] you know to win the final battle so
[9:45] we're gonna be
[9:46] in second kings tonight and um
[9:50] i encourage you to to when when you do
[9:53] have time
[9:54] you know to spend time reading second
[9:56] kings from the beginning we wouldn't
[9:57] have time tonight to get all of it
[9:59] our our main reading will be in in
[10:02] second kings uh
[10:03] six into seven um but i did want to kind
[10:06] of just talk a little bit
[10:08] about what led up to that context so you
[10:10] would understand
[10:11] you know as we get a little deeper into
[10:13] this particular aspect of scripture
[10:15] you know kind of what was playing out um
[10:18] at that time
[10:19] and um i will give my title now
[10:22] sometimes i
[10:23] i choose not to give it too early so to
[10:26] not telegraph exactly where i'll be
[10:28] um but uh just to put it on note
[10:31] um my my text tonight is why
[10:34] sit here until we die um and i think it
[10:38] is a
[10:38] it's something that is appropriate um
[10:41] not just spiritual but it's also a
[10:42] natural
[10:43] encouragement um to believers um in such
[10:46] a time as this so
[10:48] um just kind of as just of a quick
[10:50] overview
[10:51] the book of of second kings you know
[10:54] really starts up with a lot happening
[10:56] um we have this transition that's taking
[10:58] place
[10:59] in the realm of the kings
[11:02] of leadership uh there's our there's
[11:04] transitions of power taking place we
[11:06] also see
[11:08] in the beginning of of second kings we
[11:10] see
[11:11] elijah and the mantle
[11:14] being passed on to elisha and in and
[11:17] around that time
[11:18] we have king ahab who is leaving the
[11:21] scene
[11:22] and his son who would be his son
[11:26] with jezebel jehoram becoming
[11:30] the king of israel who at that time
[11:33] would be in
[11:34] in samaria at this time as well the
[11:37] kingdom of judah
[11:38] would have already been separated from
[11:40] israel so you would have
[11:42] multiple kings over what was once the
[11:44] entire domain of king david
[11:47] had already begun to separate so judah
[11:50] is being led by jehoshaphat and you have
[11:54] israel for the most part in samaria
[11:56] being led
[11:57] by jehoram and when you look at it and
[12:00] how
[12:01] second kings three introduces the
[12:04] description they say now jehoram
[12:06] the son of ahab began to reign
[12:09] i'm reading second kings three verse one
[12:11] just quickly touching through
[12:13] a few scriptures to bring us to our
[12:14] point so let's you see you know
[12:16] just how how we get to where we're at
[12:18] now jehoram the son of ahab
[12:21] began to reign over israel in samaria
[12:25] the 18th year of jehoshaphat king of
[12:27] judah
[12:28] and urane for 12 years and
[12:31] it's written and he wrought evil in the
[12:33] sight of the lord
[12:34] so you have a king over israel
[12:38] and it is defined that you wrote evil in
[12:40] the sight of the lord
[12:41] but not like his father you know so this
[12:44] is like
[12:44] a really a structured description so he
[12:47] was bad but not as bad as his father
[12:51] and like his mother for he put away
[12:54] the image of baal or baal that his
[12:57] father had made so at least he
[12:58] took down the idols but all of his
[13:01] actions in trying to
[13:03] correct what had been going on that was
[13:05] wrong was still not seen
[13:07] as enough because nevertheless in verse
[13:09] 3 he cleaved unto the sins
[13:12] of jeroboam the son of nibert which made
[13:14] israel a sin
[13:15] he departed not there from so we have a
[13:19] king
[13:20] and this is not a king of of of of uh
[13:23] uh people who are not connected from god
[13:26] this is
[13:27] the children of israel being led by a
[13:29] king who is clearly out of order he is
[13:31] he is not spirit he is not in the spirit
[13:34] but this is all
[13:35] unfolding and in along this time elisha
[13:39] is coming into his own he has just
[13:41] gotten the mantle so
[13:42] all of this is happening and it's
[13:44] happening in parallel it's it's
[13:46] happening and you have
[13:48] now as you begin to move from from
[13:50] second kings three and second kings four
[13:53] you see elisha minisester the woman
[13:56] who said all she had was one bit of oil
[13:59] and
[13:59] elijah tells her you know go and borrow
[14:02] as
[14:02] many vessels as possible and close the
[14:05] door and pour the oil and
[14:07] and she obeys she is humble and as she
[14:10] pours
[14:11] into all of the envious vessels everyone
[14:13] gets filled up
[14:15] and he tells her go pay all your debts
[14:17] and live happy so
[14:18] we see elijah as it were beginning to be
[14:21] recognized beginning to be observed
[14:22] beginning to be
[14:23] noticed we have the tsunamite woman
[14:27] who would be a fantastic cook according
[14:29] to scripture
[14:30] and she would tell her husband this is
[14:32] in second kings four
[14:34] you know this man of god who is in the
[14:36] area let's invite him to eaton
[14:37] and elisha would have this way he would
[14:39] drop by for a good meal
[14:41] and there was something about this woman
[14:43] that she said she told her husband
[14:45] let's put a little side room for the
[14:47] house so that whenever he comes by
[14:49] to eat he could kind of rest and stuff
[14:51] like that and and
[14:52] elijah is so blown away by this he asked
[14:55] her what you want
[14:56] and she said you know well grab a child
[14:58] and
[14:59] and and like you say well you're going
[15:00] to have a child you say why would you
[15:02] why would you tell me something that can
[15:03] happen almost similar in parallel to
[15:05] what what sierra would have almost gone
[15:07] through
[15:08] and the story went unfold and you know
[15:10] it one day the boy ended up seeing his
[15:12] head hurting him and then he dies
[15:14] and she says put him on the same bed
[15:17] where elisha does sleep and she gets a
[15:19] horse and rides the elisha all of this
[15:21] is there so this is
[15:22] building up into a momentum of of
[15:24] understanding the the context
[15:27] and of course we know the story elisha
[15:30] gives his staff to his servant
[15:32] he said if somebody wave at you don't
[15:33] wave back if somebody call you don't
[15:35] call back go straight to that boy
[15:37] and put my staff on him and and the
[15:39] servant came back and said he's still
[15:40] dead elisha goes he put his
[15:42] his mouth out he put his whole body on
[15:44] him and the boy comes to life so this is
[15:46] building
[15:47] elisha's recognition his his reputation
[15:51] and by the time he reached second kings
[15:52] five which is one
[15:54] chapter before where we will spend some
[15:56] time this evening
[15:58] we have neyman and we dealt with neyman
[16:00] a few
[16:01] months or so ago that neyman as a syrian
[16:05] you know with his leprosy condition was
[16:07] able to catch the eye of a little
[16:09] of a little servant girl and he would
[16:12] interact with elijah and we spent a lot
[16:14] of time going
[16:15] uh through that you know so this is now
[16:18] building so by this time now elisha is a
[16:20] known entity
[16:21] everyone knows that elisha is a man of
[16:23] god he's a he's a prophet of god
[16:25] everybody is clear on that
[16:27] and then we reach to second kings six
[16:31] where later in second king six um
[16:34] we will really find where we want to
[16:36] start tonight but even within second
[16:38] king six
[16:40] you know we have this very famous
[16:41] scripture that we refer to
[16:43] when in and this is second king six and
[16:45] verse eight and when the king of syria
[16:47] ward against israel so there was already
[16:50] a bit of a contention
[16:52] by this time between israel
[16:55] and syria so israel and syria is at war
[16:59] and so i'm reading now from second kings
[17:02] eight
[17:03] second king six verse eight and then the
[17:05] king of syria ward against israel
[17:07] and took counsel with his servant saying
[17:10] in such and such a place shall be my
[17:12] camp
[17:13] and the man of god sent unto the king of
[17:16] israel
[17:17] saying beware that thou pass not such a
[17:19] place
[17:20] for viva the syrians are come down so
[17:23] basically in this whole story here
[17:26] every time the king of syria is planning
[17:29] his attack
[17:30] against children of israel
[17:33] elisha is getting clear instructions
[17:37] from god
[17:38] clear vision from god of exactly what is
[17:41] being planned by the king of syria
[17:43] in so much that by verse 11 the bible
[17:46] says therefore the heart of the king of
[17:47] syria
[17:48] was so troubled for this thing and he
[17:51] called his servant and said unto them
[17:53] will ye not show me which of us is for
[17:55] the king of israel
[17:57] and one of his servants said not my lord
[18:00] o king
[18:01] but elisha the prophet that is in israel
[18:04] tell it the king of israel the words
[18:06] that those speakers in thy bed chamber
[18:10] and that is a powerful thing to see
[18:13] no matter the attack that the syrians
[18:16] were trying to do
[18:17] against israel god was stopping it every
[18:20] single time
[18:21] and this is what led to him saying let's
[18:23] go find him
[18:24] and we find elisha and we have preachers
[18:26] many times there you know he is he's
[18:29] about his business and his servants a
[18:31] master master
[18:32] they're all around us and he likes to
[18:34] say open this boy eyes
[18:36] they're more for us stand against us and
[18:39] we know that story
[18:41] we're getting closer to where we want to
[18:42] be at so i want us to understand that
[18:44] all of this is what is leading up to
[18:46] this particular situation now bear in
[18:48] mind friends
[18:49] that god is a god who
[18:53] is a god of his word now many times
[18:56] and as christians we have to be very
[18:58] careful of this as believers
[18:59] we have to be very very careful of this
[19:02] once
[19:03] you step out of the will of god or you
[19:05] disobey god
[19:07] there are consequences to that and
[19:10] even if you repent of it repentance
[19:13] doesn't necessarily change
[19:15] consequences of breaking god's law god
[19:18] will accept your
[19:19] your your your repentance he will accept
[19:22] you coming back
[19:23] but he is still in his right to take
[19:25] action to disobedience
[19:27] because his word says if you disobey me
[19:29] certain things will happen to you
[19:31] i want us to to catch that right so
[19:34] in as much as and i want to make the
[19:36] point here elisha
[19:38] is a prophet and he's operating and
[19:41] working with the children of israel
[19:43] the fact is the children of israel they
[19:45] are still
[19:46] under judgment because they are
[19:50] fundamentally and truthfully out of
[19:52] order
[19:54] and you you need to be very very clear
[19:56] that
[19:57] even if there are signs of god working
[20:00] with you
[20:01] doesn't change the fact that you have to
[20:03] get your life in order
[20:05] i want to say that one more time many
[20:07] times we operate and say well i was
[20:09] blessed with this
[20:10] i was blessed with that god did this for
[20:12] me and this happened for me
[20:14] and and and we made the assumption that
[20:17] because things
[20:18] are working out or things seem positive
[20:21] that the things that we do that we
[20:24] should not do that god is somehow
[20:25] ignoring it
[20:28] i want to i want to make sure we get
[20:29] that point clear
[20:31] because god is sovereign he can do what
[20:34] he wants to do
[20:35] so he can open a door for you and allow
[20:37] you to run a certain way for some time
[20:40] and still decide now is not the time to
[20:43] deal with the other issues you have
[20:44] going on
[20:47] and and and that's a that's a serious
[20:49] serious thing and it
[20:50] reminds me um and i know my grandfather
[20:54] gonna use a natural example was
[20:55] more of this than my own father but
[20:58] my dad i'll share something with you he
[21:01] had this ability when i was younger
[21:03] to distance himself from the discipline
[21:07] and it is the most unnerving disturbing
[21:10] thing you can go through
[21:12] it is as if to say i'm gonna you see
[21:14] what you just did i will deal with that
[21:15] you know
[21:16] but not today
[21:19] and listen when you hear that that can
[21:22] mess up your whole weakener
[21:25] because you're no judgment coming you
[21:27] don't know when it will strike
[21:30] but you know it's going to strike so
[21:33] it's as if you said you see
[21:35] you know don't take any cake from the
[21:37] fridge that cake
[21:38] is for saturday but you know certain
[21:41] people like cake
[21:42] so you end up taking the cake earlier
[21:44] than saturday and he says i will deal
[21:46] with that and i wouldn't deal with it
[21:48] today
[21:49] so you have a situation where you know
[21:51] jobbing is coming you're living your
[21:53] life normal
[21:54] tuesday friday it could be monday
[21:57] and and the reality is it is up to him
[22:01] to decide
[22:02] how he will deal with the discipline
[22:04] because he make a statement i don't want
[22:06] to touch i just give you an example of
[22:08] this
[22:09] so all that being said when the syrian
[22:12] army
[22:13] came around elisha and
[22:16] elisha said open this boy jahazi's eyes
[22:20] and they are more for us than against us
[22:23] many times we don't really go into what
[22:24] happened after that the bible says
[22:27] and when they came down to him this is
[22:29] second kings six and verse 18 and when
[22:31] they came down to him
[22:33] elisha prayed unto the lord and said
[22:35] smite
[22:36] this people i pray thee with blindness
[22:39] so this syrian army that came for
[22:43] elisha not only was it a situation of
[22:46] more force than against us but he
[22:47] actually smote them with blindness
[22:49] and elijah said unto them this is not
[22:52] the way
[22:53] neither is this the city follow me and i
[22:57] will bring you to the man whom you seek
[23:00] but he led them to samaria so i want you
[23:02] to remember they came looking for elijah
[23:04] you know
[23:05] and elisha smote them with blindness and
[23:08] say this is
[23:08] you're in the wrong place and know who
[23:10] you're looking for
[23:12] i know where he is let me carry you to
[23:15] meet him
[23:16] and elijah led them to samaria
[23:19] which is the city or the area or the
[23:22] territory
[23:23] that israel is at under the kingship of
[23:25] king jehoram
[23:27] and it came to pass verse 20 when they
[23:30] came into samaria
[23:31] that elisha said lord open the eyes of
[23:34] these men
[23:35] that they may see i'm reading verse 20
[23:37] and the lord opened their eyes and they
[23:39] saw
[23:40] and behold they were in the midst of
[23:42] samaria
[23:43] and the king of israel jehoram said unto
[23:47] elisha when he saw them
[23:48] my father shall i smite them shall i
[23:51] smite them
[23:53] no this is this is a serious situation
[23:55] here because they were at war
[23:59] and he said and he answered now this is
[24:01] elisha
[24:03] because this is the context we need to
[24:05] get that
[24:06] leads into what happens next so i want
[24:08] you to understand
[24:09] there's war going on every time the
[24:12] children
[24:12] of israel coming under attack by the
[24:15] syrians they have the hedge of elisha's
[24:17] protection the syrians are upset they
[24:20] come to get
[24:21] elisha elisha says i'm not demanding any
[24:24] place let me carry it in the place
[24:25] takes them to samaria head to head so
[24:28] the two armies effectively facing off at
[24:30] this point in time
[24:32] and the king of israel jehoram has the
[24:36] opportunity
[24:38] to take out the syrian army and elisha
[24:41] says
[24:43] and he answered verse 22 thou shalt not
[24:45] smite them what has doused
[24:46] my those whom thou has taken captive
[24:48] with thy sword and with thy bow
[24:50] select bread and water before them that
[24:53] they may eat and drink and go to their
[24:55] master
[24:56] so elisha steered the hand
[24:59] at that time of the king of israel
[25:01] against the syrian army
[25:04] and ibrahimovic said and he prepared
[25:05] great provision for them and when they
[25:07] had eaten and drunk he sent them away
[25:09] and they went to the master so the bands
[25:11] of syria came
[25:12] no more into the land of israel
[25:16] so it would appear at that point as if
[25:19] okay
[25:20] there's peace and there was no reason
[25:23] for
[25:23] any contention as it were between
[25:25] jehoram the king of israel and elijah
[25:28] and this right here is the full
[25:31] background into our text tonight so
[25:33] thank you for being a great audience for
[25:35] the background now let's get into
[25:37] into where we're going now so we clear
[25:40] on the background verse 24
[25:43] and it came to pass this is our teaching
[25:45] that now we
[25:46] we we now starting to get down into what
[25:48] we want to get into tonight
[25:50] so we are in second king six and verse
[25:52] 24 and it came to pass
[25:54] after this so after some time had passed
[25:57] that ben had that king of syria
[26:00] and i'm going to put in some elements as
[26:03] we read it
[26:04] clearly forgetting the grace that was
[26:07] extended to him
[26:08] by the king of israel when his army was
[26:11] eaten
[26:12] in front of them and he they had the
[26:14] opportunity to kill them
[26:15] all right the king of syria gathered all
[26:17] his hosts
[26:18] and went up and besieged samaria
[26:24] so the men who had eaten
[26:27] been fed relax
[26:30] went back home to their master who was a
[26:32] king of syria and now
[26:33] rallied and they besieged sumaria the
[26:38] word besiege
[26:39] means to surround
[26:42] and when you surround a city effectively
[26:45] you cut off supply
[26:47] you cut off transportation you cut off
[26:51] access
[26:53] those who are inside can't come out
[26:56] if you're outside your car come in you
[26:59] are besieged
[27:00] if you have products you cannot export
[27:03] it
[27:03] if you need product you cannot import it
[27:07] if the doctor who you need to operate on
[27:09] you happens to be outside you have to do
[27:11] without that doctor
[27:12] if you are a doctor and your patient
[27:14] happened to be outside you can't go out
[27:16] because you are besieged
[27:18] so in other words you're in lockdown
[27:20] does this sound familiar
[27:22] at all i i i don't know and it came to
[27:25] pass
[27:26] that ben haddad king of syria gathered
[27:28] all his hosts and went up and besieged
[27:32] samaria when you besiege
[27:34] a city again whatever you have
[27:38] is what you have to live with the longer
[27:41] the siege continues
[27:44] what begins to happen is you begin to
[27:46] lose resources
[27:49] because you have a limited supply if you
[27:51] happen to be an environment
[27:53] you could grow things you could grow for
[27:54] as long as you could but if you're
[27:56] running a seed
[27:57] or it's a dry period or whatever it is
[27:59] you're limited so we are clear on that
[28:02] and there was a great famine in samaria
[28:05] who was 25. and behold they besieged it
[28:08] until and as his head was sold for four
[28:11] score pieces of silver
[28:13] and the fourth part of a cab of doves
[28:15] dung
[28:16] for five pieces of silver dove's dung is
[28:18] dull is dove's extra
[28:20] excrement so in other words this pricing
[28:23] in history
[28:25] is basically saying it was so bad that
[28:28] you had to be extremely
[28:30] wealthy to buy the excrement of a dog
[28:33] of a dove that's how bad it was
[28:36] prices would have skyrocketed because
[28:40] of the economic scarcity that existed
[28:44] is either you really really had and if
[28:46] you had yours you had
[28:47] little purchasing power so this was a
[28:51] economic crisis brought about by the war
[28:55] between two nations israel
[28:58] and the enemies of israel
[29:01] verse 26 and sometimes you know
[29:05] you think things are bad let's go on in
[29:08] verse 26 and as the king of israel
[29:11] backslidden brother jehoram son of ahab
[29:13] and jezebel
[29:14] was passing by upon the wall
[29:17] they cried a woman unto him saying help
[29:20] my lord o king you know whenever people
[29:24] are in trouble
[29:26] you look towards some level of
[29:27] leadership you look to somebody who is
[29:29] in a position
[29:30] who can do something about the situation
[29:33] that is
[29:33] human nature so you would think that
[29:36] in seeing the king person the belief
[29:39] would be that
[29:40] the king could maybe step in and do
[29:42] something about whatever this woman's
[29:44] issue
[29:45] was i'm not going to be too long with
[29:46] you just taking us through this and
[29:48] seeing what we could catch from it
[29:51] and this is the king's response and he
[29:53] said if the lord
[29:54] do not have thee when shall i
[29:57] help thee out of the barn floor
[30:01] or out of the wine press in other words
[30:04] if the lord not intervening in your
[30:07] situation where you want me to get help
[30:08] from
[30:09] the band floor because the bands are
[30:11] empty your wine press we have nothing in
[30:13] there in other words
[30:14] i can't help you don't look to me
[30:16] because if the lord
[30:18] who is bigger than me can i help you you
[30:19] can't look to me for help so
[30:21] it's a helpless situation it's a
[30:24] hopeless situation
[30:25] i don't think anybody in this room has
[30:28] ever been in a situation
[30:30] as helpless and as hopeless as this
[30:32] particular situation
[30:35] and the king said unto her now listen to
[30:38] the problem
[30:39] what a let me so in other words still
[30:42] tell me
[30:43] still tell me what the problem is and
[30:46] i'm trusting most of you would have
[30:47] studied this before already before but
[30:49] if you
[30:49] never encountered the details here then
[30:52] it's a it's a really really
[30:53] interesting you know it's really really
[30:56] something else and the king said under
[30:58] what led and she answered
[31:00] so if you're reading this slowly and you
[31:02] don't continue so i don't want to rush
[31:04] ahead
[31:04] i want to take it slowly if you're
[31:07] starving
[31:08] and you see the king passing and you
[31:10] can't say how can i help you
[31:12] logically speaking you will say well i
[31:14] want some food
[31:15] i have no money what assistance can you
[31:18] give me can you help me out
[31:20] this woman and she answered
[31:23] this woman said unto me
[31:26] give thy son that we may eat him today
[31:32] and we will eat my son tomorrow
[31:36] so this is the help she was looking for
[31:39] so we boiled my son and did eat him
[31:43] and i said unto her on the next day give
[31:45] thy son
[31:46] that we may eat him and she had hid
[31:50] her son so when i read this and i slowed
[31:54] down and i started to think because
[31:56] meditate on your word means sitting on
[31:58] think about it because your kite has
[31:59] readers this
[32:00] is this is not this is not a novel
[32:04] things had gotten so bad that there was
[32:07] no vegetation to eat
[32:09] there was no animals to eat until
[32:12] they had reached the point that they
[32:14] were eating their own children
[32:18] the help she was asking from the king
[32:20] wasn't helped for grief
[32:24] she wasn't saying i am in grief
[32:28] because i ate my son
[32:32] things were so bad that she was beyond
[32:34] the issue
[32:35] of her son being dead she wasn't asking
[32:39] for help
[32:40] from the king for her dead son
[32:43] she wasn't asking for help because of
[32:44] the situation and i want you to see how
[32:48] when you're out of the will of god how
[32:50] bad things can get
[32:52] because the only reason this was
[32:54] happening was because they were out of
[32:56] the will of god
[32:58] and this what we're reading here in
[32:59] second kings was actually foretold in
[33:02] scripture
[33:03] so if you go back to deuteronomy 28
[33:07] indulge me for one second in deuteronomy
[33:10] 28
[33:11] which is the book in the old testament
[33:14] that deals with the blessings and the
[33:15] curses
[33:17] deuteronomy 28 and verse 52.
[33:24] is a a strong just bible teaching
[33:26] tonight
[33:27] deuteronomy 28 and verse 52
[33:30] and he shall besiege thee in all thy
[33:32] gates
[33:34] until thy high and fence walls come down
[33:38] wherein thou trusted throughout all thy
[33:40] land
[33:42] and he shall besiege thee and all thy
[33:43] gates throughout all thy land which the
[33:45] lord thy god had given thee
[33:47] and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine
[33:50] own body
[33:51] the flesh of thy sons and of thy
[33:53] daughters which the lord thy god had
[33:55] given thee
[33:56] in the siege and in the straightness
[33:58] where it an enemy shall distress thee
[34:01] and all of these curses here in
[34:03] deuteronomy was as a result of one thing
[34:06] and one thing only disobedience to god's
[34:09] word
[34:10] so for anybody who was in israel
[34:14] who would have known what was in the
[34:16] torah
[34:18] because the five sacred books of moses
[34:21] would have included all of these things
[34:24] so
[34:24] it was it should have been no surprise
[34:26] to the spiritual
[34:28] of that day that this was not a natural
[34:31] issue
[34:32] it was not a natural situation this was
[34:35] in direct response to blatant
[34:39] disobedience of god's word so from that
[34:42] perspective
[34:45] i want us to understand that it was not
[34:47] hunger that this woman
[34:48] was asking for help was looking for she
[34:51] wasn't even saying king
[34:53] i need help or king why don't we repent
[34:59] i want us to stop for a minute because
[35:01] at this point in time there's no
[35:03] attempt to you know what this is
[35:06] judgment
[35:06] why don't we try to fix it
[35:11] there was no discussion about this has
[35:13] befallen us because we have left god's
[35:15] word
[35:18] the commentary was not a discussion
[35:20] about we have left
[35:21] something undone that should be done and
[35:24] as a result there are consequences
[35:25] because god is a god of his word
[35:27] and he is no respecter of persons
[35:31] this is scripture being fulfilled
[35:35] the situation was so bad that she was
[35:38] still trying to get the king
[35:40] to enforce but this woman promised
[35:44] that after we eat my son we will eat her
[35:46] son
[35:47] and now she having second thoughts so in
[35:49] other words king
[35:50] i want you to make her bring her son out
[35:53] of hiding wherever she finds wherever
[35:55] she had him
[35:55] bring him out so we can boil him and eat
[35:58] him too
[36:01] friends this this is not a fairy tale
[36:04] you know
[36:07] you have to really slow down there are
[36:09] people who say
[36:10] i don't eat this i don't eat that
[36:13] this is not that you know how bad does
[36:17] it get
[36:18] that you could even conceptualize eating
[36:20] your child
[36:23] so i wanted to understand that it is
[36:26] beyond
[36:26] sin in this case it is beyond that and
[36:28] bad it meant that
[36:30] it got so bad at logic and reason
[36:33] and family life and purpose and destiny
[36:37] and legacy because this is a sun being
[36:39] eaten a sun
[36:40] is is is delineates being continued
[36:45] so eating your children is tantamount to
[36:47] cutting off your descendants
[36:51] so in other words they have gotten so
[36:53] far from god
[36:54] this is bible so far from god that they
[36:58] were willing to eat their children
[37:01] and it came to pass verse 30 when the
[37:04] king heard the words of the woman
[37:07] that he rent his clothes in other words
[37:10] he felt the grief he felt the grief that
[37:13] she didn't feel
[37:16] the reality of the situation because
[37:18] understand this in this time
[37:20] the king would have been in a in a
[37:22] different room so to speak than iman on
[37:24] the street
[37:26] especially in those days if there was
[37:28] anything to eat
[37:30] something would go to the king so maybe
[37:34] he's walking there trying to get a feel
[37:35] of what's happening in the kingdom
[37:37] and the reality of it strikes
[37:40] this thing is worse than i thought
[37:44] and maybe he is reflecting on himself
[37:47] maybe he is reflecting on his leadership
[37:50] maybe he is reflecting on his decision
[37:52] making
[37:53] and he rents his clothes which in that
[37:55] day is a is a great sign of
[37:57] oh this is this is too much renting
[38:00] closes
[38:01] is a combination of grief and anger
[38:03] mixed into one
[38:05] and he passed by upon the wall and the
[38:07] people looked and beheld
[38:09] he had sackcloth within upon his flesh
[38:12] so the king is going through his own
[38:14] turmoil because
[38:15] at the end of the day it is not as if
[38:18] the man on the street really has a
[38:20] position in this context to change it
[38:23] it had to be leadership make a decision
[38:26] we need to repent we need to fix this we
[38:27] need to get this in order
[38:29] in order for us to fix what has gone
[38:31] wrong
[38:38] then he said god do so
[38:41] and more also to me listen
[38:46] so let me finish and i'll talk about it
[38:48] if the head
[38:49] of elisha the son of shafa
[38:52] shall stand on him this day
[38:56] so i wanted to see the switch now
[38:59] because this is powerful this here is a
[39:02] lot
[39:02] in here and we still building up to our
[39:04] teacher we have reached
[39:05] the core of it here this is still
[39:07] background so
[39:08] the king sees this and he does
[39:12] what most people do when they can't
[39:15] seem to understand the role that they
[39:18] have to play
[39:19] in fixing the issues of their life
[39:23] the king's response is i have to blame
[39:26] somebody
[39:31] the king is the only one who is in
[39:33] position to do something about it
[39:36] and his response to the situation is
[39:40] god do so and more also to me in other
[39:43] words
[39:44] god better do the same thing to me you
[39:46] know if i don't see elisha head
[39:49] on this day god bless my head
[39:52] so he say listen elisha have to die
[39:55] in other words not only did he not take
[39:58] responsibility
[39:59] for the condition that they were in
[40:03] he said the man of god have to pay a
[40:06] price for this
[40:08] maybe he was saying to himself you know
[40:10] if i had killed them
[40:12] earlier on when they came in front of me
[40:15] and elijah didn't steal my hand they
[40:17] would not have had the strength to be
[40:18] seen just now
[40:24] understand this he's not seeing the sin
[40:28] the sin and the failures the spiritual
[40:31] issue that was a real problem
[40:33] was not his issue he is focused on what
[40:36] he believed
[40:37] he could have controlled while living
[40:39] the way he was living all along i want
[40:42] us to kind of
[40:42] hold on to that thought a little bit
[40:44] there in other words
[40:46] he is saying i want to live my life
[40:49] breaking the spiritual rules but you
[40:52] know what i had the opportunity to take
[40:54] all these syrians
[40:55] and when i had the opportunity i didn't
[40:56] take it it was elijah's fault
[40:59] that held my hand if i had done what i
[41:01] wanted to do
[41:02] the city would never be besieged
[41:07] but god is not trying to get is not
[41:10] victory over the syrians is the
[41:12] objective here it's repentance
[41:14] it is the change of behavior i want us
[41:17] to catch that now
[41:23] friends
[41:26] many times when we are looking outward
[41:31] to blame anybody for our situation
[41:35] most times we should be looking inward
[41:40] i'm not trying to bring it to us for us
[41:42] to get into a pity party
[41:44] or for us to get into depression or or
[41:47] feeling frustrated
[41:48] i want us to understand that no matter
[41:50] what we have a choice
[41:54] and the best choice the king had was to
[41:56] do what he should have known
[41:58] which was to repent get the people in in
[42:01] order do these spiritual things
[42:05] but that was not his focus he didn't see
[42:08] it as a
[42:09] spiritual problem so he was trying to
[42:11] solve it with a
[42:12] natural solution
[42:17] so i want us to catch now we we just
[42:19] finished in verse 31
[42:22] verse 32 but elisha sat in his house
[42:27] and the elders sat with him and the king
[42:31] sent a man from before him
[42:36] in other words the king himself wants to
[42:39] come and deal with elisha
[42:41] but the king bigner so yeah just showing
[42:43] up he's sending somebody in front a
[42:45] forerunner
[42:47] but uh the messenger came to him he said
[42:49] to the elders see
[42:51] he how this son of a murderer but
[42:54] uh but elijah sat in his house and the
[42:56] ella sat with him and the king
[42:58] sent a man be from before him but uh the
[43:01] messenger came to him he said
[43:03] so in other words before the messenger
[43:06] that the king was sending in advance
[43:08] could even reach elisha this is elijah
[43:13] see how this son of a murderer had sent
[43:16] to take away my head
[43:19] now this is a paradox that i don't
[43:21] understand with the enemy
[43:24] this is the same elisha that was
[43:26] advising the same jehoram
[43:29] when the syrian army do this do this
[43:31] when a syrian army go in here move here
[43:34] you jehoram don't understand that he
[43:36] can't just roll up on elijah
[43:41] so the same way elisha
[43:44] could have seen where the syrian army
[43:46] was is the same elijah in his home
[43:48] fellowship with the brothers and you see
[43:50] you see all this murderer trying to come
[43:51] from ahead
[43:52] before he before jehoram and his make it
[43:55] even reach
[43:56] elijah and see the whole thing happen
[43:58] and he said look when the messenger
[44:00] cometh shut the door and hold him fast
[44:02] at the door
[44:03] it's not the sound of his master's feet
[44:05] behind him
[44:06] and while he yet talked with them behold
[44:10] the messenger came down unto him
[44:12] so in other words elijah explaining
[44:15] what's about to happen
[44:16] and as he finished explaining here
[44:18] playing out in real time is what he was
[44:20] explaining to the brothers
[44:21] man you see what would happen whenever
[44:22] prophet any land
[44:24] the man of god fellowshipping and as
[44:26] he's saying you know this is about to
[44:27] happen
[44:27] and as he's saying it it's as if you
[44:29] rewind the tape and see the tape play
[44:31] out
[44:32] what what a vindicat this would have a
[44:34] vindicated prophet in your image
[44:36] anybody with me tonight and while he yet
[44:40] talked with them behold the messenger
[44:41] came down unto him
[44:42] and he said behold this evil is of the
[44:45] lord what
[44:46] what should i wait for the lord any
[44:47] longer and elisha said
[44:50] hear ye the word of the lord this is
[44:53] seven verse one so elijah as a prophet
[44:56] is now
[44:56] prophesying and we know whenever a
[44:58] prophet speaks
[45:00] it must come to pass then elisha said
[45:03] hear ye
[45:04] the word of the lord thus saith the lord
[45:07] hallelujah tomorrow about this time
[45:11] now you know how the brothers around
[45:13] elijah must feel
[45:16] this is the peak in other words the the
[45:19] the timeline of this thing
[45:21] is almost immediate the king
[45:24] gets so upset this is the same day we
[45:26] can we actually reading all year in the
[45:28] same day
[45:29] because the king said this day mustn't
[45:31] end until i see he lies ahead
[45:34] so in the very same day this whole thing
[45:36] playing all right here
[45:38] the the the king is heading down to
[45:41] elisha
[45:42] with his men he's setting things up and
[45:45] elijah is saying
[45:46] hear the word of the lord thus see the
[45:48] lord tomorrow
[45:50] about this same time shall a measure of
[45:54] fine flower
[45:55] be sold for a shekel and two measures of
[45:59] valley
[45:59] for a shekel in the gate of samaria in
[46:02] other words
[46:03] by this time tomorrow the market will
[46:06] crash
[46:06] in other words by this time tomorrow
[46:09] there'll be
[46:10] so much food that the man who have no
[46:13] money will have plenty
[46:15] by this time tomorrow the man who
[46:19] just have a shekel alone will get two
[46:22] measures of valley
[46:24] earlier on that same day it say you
[46:26] couldn't even
[46:27] buy the excrement of a dove unless
[46:30] you're a millionaire
[46:31] but by this time tomorrow the market
[46:34] conditions will change
[46:35] the environment will change your
[46:38] situation will change
[46:40] hallelujah and listen now
[46:43] no this in this context i want us to
[46:46] understand this in this context
[46:48] this prophecy would qualify as a
[46:51] virtual impossibility because it is
[46:54] and this is where you have to be careful
[46:56] now it is it is
[46:58] so unreasonable because
[47:03] you're on a day when your people dying
[47:05] nobody has strength to fight
[47:08] the city is surrounded armies are around
[47:11] you
[47:11] you have no food you have no army
[47:14] what could possibly change overnight
[47:18] i want this again you said this is not
[47:20] the situation being changed in a week
[47:23] in two weeks in a month over the next
[47:25] three months don't worry
[47:26] this is by this same time you're coming
[47:29] from my head
[47:29] by this same time tomorrow all your
[47:31] problems gone
[47:34] whatever trouble you're going through
[47:35] could you have faith to believe
[47:37] that god can move so quickly in your
[47:40] situation
[47:41] by this time tomorrow hallelujah the
[47:43] athletic pain you have in your body
[47:45] could be gone
[47:46] that you could have faith to believe
[47:48] that by this time tomorrow
[47:50] hallelujah that high blood pressure
[47:52] could be normal
[47:54] do you have fear to believe by this time
[47:56] tomorrow there could be reconciliation
[47:58] between your family
[48:00] do you have faith to believe and this is
[48:02] the prophetic ministry
[48:04] of elisha who came after elijah
[48:08] now listen then a lord
[48:12] on whose hand the king leaned in other
[48:15] words
[48:16] lord on whose handy king lean is like a
[48:18] right-hand man
[48:19] is the way he would write a right-hand
[48:21] manner advisor
[48:22] senior man to the king one of j jerome
[48:26] topman listen now answered the man of
[48:30] god and said behold
[48:32] if the lord would make windows in heaven
[48:34] my distinct be
[48:35] in other words what you saying can
[48:37] happen
[48:40] oh my and this is a challenge for us in
[48:42] this room tonight
[48:45] this man who this i want us to
[48:47] understand
[48:48] these people we're talking about is not
[48:49] unbelievers and this is not people
[48:51] out outside the household of the of the
[48:54] tribes of israel
[48:55] these are people who born into this
[48:57] thing but living outside of the
[48:59] privileges of god
[49:00] because they have broken the covenants
[49:01] of god they're broken the laws of god in
[49:03] other words they should know better
[49:06] and the reality is no matter how
[49:08] backslidden you find yourself in
[49:10] you should know better because once you
[49:12] have come in contact
[49:13] with your jain and who you are and where
[49:16] you come from
[49:16] and where your heritage is your
[49:19] temporary mishap and your fall and
[49:21] failure
[49:22] doesn't change the fact that you know
[49:24] better
[49:26] and you know god is the god of the
[49:28] impossible the
[49:30] challenge and the prophecy was too great
[49:33] for this right-hand man of jehoram to
[49:36] process
[49:37] and i want to challenge the church
[49:39] tonight that your faith has to climb
[49:42] higher
[49:43] to believe that just like that god could
[49:45] change your situation
[49:48] if it's anything this is to teach us is
[49:50] god is serious
[49:52] about the impossibility of his word
[49:54] being made possible
[49:56] let me say that one more time if it's
[49:58] anything this teaches us
[50:00] it is when god says something and
[50:02] brother branham speaks about it he says
[50:04] when god
[50:04] does something like this you just have
[50:06] to say amen
[50:09] he said respond quickly don't even try
[50:12] to figure it out
[50:14] don't try to figure out how the
[50:16] situation in your life will change
[50:18] the situation in your business will
[50:20] change what god will move around
[50:22] for your benefit how it will happen is
[50:25] not your concern
[50:26] if he said it's going to happen it's
[50:27] going to happen you'd have to figure out
[50:29] how he has to want to respond and say
[50:30] yes sir
[50:32] but look how much god was upset
[50:35] with this negative response and i want
[50:38] to challenge the church tonight
[50:40] you cannot be negative let me say that
[50:42] one more time
[50:44] you cannot be negative not you not us
[50:47] not after we serve a god of miracles not
[50:50] after god sent our elijah to give us
[50:54] promises
[50:55] that he's interested in every aspect of
[50:57] our lives we cannot be negative
[50:59] you can't speak negative you can't
[51:01] respond negative
[51:02] this might sound too exciting for you
[51:04] you say well oh god just choose the
[51:05] night here
[51:06] but isaac just this is a bit much to me
[51:08] i want you to see that your city which
[51:10] you could change overnight
[51:12] it is one thing i want you to catch is
[51:14] that your situation can change overnight
[51:17] your marriage could change overnight
[51:19] your business could change overnight
[51:21] your life could change overnight your
[51:23] joy could change overnight your peace
[51:25] could change overnight and god wants to
[51:27] do it for you
[51:28] in this season when this world is
[51:30] besieged
[51:31] oh come on now when this world is
[51:34] surrounded by the virus by
[51:36] economic siege by political siege by
[51:38] siege of
[51:39] bad doctrine and teaching and this and
[51:41] that god could do something overnight
[51:43] why
[51:44] because that's how he is he's a god of
[51:46] promises he's a god of his word
[51:48] he said the message would seem broken
[51:50] down but yet in the midst of that time
[51:52] he will raise up a people he'll raise up
[51:54] a bride
[51:56] for such a time as this just like esther
[51:58] for such a time as
[51:59] this oh anybody with me tonight
[52:03] hallelujah people say nothing moving
[52:05] nothing moving
[52:06] oh come on now in the midst of that
[52:09] there's something moving
[52:10] there's a rustle in the mulberry b
[52:12] there's still there's a stillness that's
[52:14] being broken tonight
[52:15] in the atmosphere don't take this for
[52:17] granted tonight
[52:18] don't take it light tonight i don't care
[52:20] what's going on out there
[52:22] i don't care what's happening out there
[52:24] we are dealing with the promise of god
[52:26] the individual who received the promise
[52:28] because this man
[52:29] this man we're going to talk about him
[52:31] he heard the promise but he didn't
[52:33] receive it
[52:33] i'm not speaking to those who hear it
[52:35] and don't receive it this was not about
[52:37] hearing it
[52:38] or listening to it this was about
[52:40] believing it and taking action about it
[52:42] and this man said
[52:43] good god could god open a window and do
[52:46] this
[52:46] or tonight i say yes he could open a
[52:49] window he could open a door
[52:50] he could change things around he can
[52:52] make a road at the back of your house
[52:54] i have to pay you to to to do a bigger
[52:57] house i don't care
[52:58] what has to happen have faith in god
[53:01] this is a message of faith tonight
[53:03] in the darkest of hours in the darkest
[53:05] of moments when things are so depressing
[53:08] and things are so down and people are so
[53:10] gloomy somebody told me yesterday it's a
[53:12] mental strain the world is under
[53:15] it's it's every day is a bad news it's
[53:16] this it's that it's how
[53:18] it's uncertainty and in the midst of
[53:20] that these people in the midst of
[53:21] uncertainty
[53:23] and one day a mother is saying oh gosh i
[53:26] eat my child
[53:28] my only child i thought i would get food
[53:30] but and
[53:31] they don't even know they don't even
[53:33] know that in in
[53:35] in in a few hours by the next day
[53:38] they have too much food they can't even
[53:40] have room for food anybody with me
[53:41] tonight
[53:44] be careful then a lord
[53:47] on whose hand the king lean answered the
[53:50] man of god
[53:52] their answer was you have the audacity
[53:54] to answer the man of god and said behold
[53:58] if the lord would make windows in the
[54:00] heaven
[54:01] my destiny be and he said
[54:04] listen to elisha's response
[54:08] to the negativity so and i'm making it a
[54:11] call of action to the church
[54:12] please don't bring your negativity
[54:15] listen to how elisha responded
[54:17] and he said behold thou shalt see it
[54:21] with thine eyes but shalt not eat
[54:24] thereof
[54:25] in other words you will see it because
[54:28] the prophecy is coming to you
[54:30] and you must know that when a prophet
[54:31] speaks the prophecy must come to pass
[54:33] so you're going to see the prophecy
[54:35] fulfilled in 24 hours
[54:37] you're gonna see me change don't doubt
[54:39] it believe it
[54:40] but you will not be able to eat thereof
[54:44] now everybody feeling fine
[54:47] how is this so far is this is this any
[54:50] kind of encouragement to you overnight i
[54:52] want to see the testimonies you know
[54:54] of of of who have enough faith to
[54:56] believe that overnight
[54:58] your day your mind going you're trying
[55:00] to figure things out and you trying to
[55:01] solve it
[55:02] not even knowing that god already
[55:04] planned the overnight
[55:06] hallelujah you don't even know that your
[55:09] efforts
[55:09] as best as it could be could never
[55:11] compare to you overnight
[55:13] hallelujah what god has in store for you
[55:16] as a child
[55:17] as a mother as a father as a businessman
[55:20] as an employee whatever your station in
[55:22] life wherever you
[55:23] are in life god has a plan for your life
[55:26] glory to god but but isaac this is not a
[55:29] mystery tonight this is nothing no this
[55:31] is real tonight
[55:32] because people are in their struggles
[55:35] and you have to realize that you might
[55:36] be on top of your mountain but there's
[55:38] somebody in their valley
[55:39] and i say if tonight is for one person
[55:42] may that one person
[55:44] lift their head up and rise above their
[55:45] situation and begin to claim their
[55:47] promise in god
[55:50] verse 3 i don't know who this is for and
[55:52] there were four
[55:54] leprous men at the entering in
[55:58] of the gate i want to stop right there
[56:01] there were four leprous men so context
[56:05] these four leprous men were actually in
[56:08] a worse position
[56:11] than the lady who was fighting to eat a
[56:13] friend's son
[56:17] if you're taught that that lady added
[56:19] bad these men
[56:20] had it worth and i find it very
[56:23] interesting
[56:25] four leprous men and the bible puts them
[56:28] together
[56:29] so it's not like a leprous man here
[56:32] makes one over here
[56:33] and everyone over here it's the truest
[56:35] sense of misery like company
[56:38] these four men all in trouble
[56:42] these four men have to deal with this
[56:45] incurable disease called leprosy these
[56:48] four men
[56:49] are equally privileged to not have
[56:51] access into the city
[56:53] i want you to get this the reason
[56:55] they're outside is because they were not
[56:57] welcome inside
[56:58] not as if inside had anything for them
[56:59] anyway so they're outside
[57:02] they actually buffering they are between
[57:05] the city and the syrians and they're
[57:08] just
[57:08] out there fellowshipping
[57:12] and they said to one another
[57:16] i heard somebody say this was a
[57:17] management meeting
[57:19] this was one of the most strategic
[57:21] meetings in bible history
[57:24] right here in the midst of this is four
[57:28] leprous men who the odds are against
[57:31] them
[57:33] they can't go and talk even to the king
[57:35] so the woman who
[57:36] had to get her her food tried to get his
[57:38] son
[57:39] she had access to the kingdom these four
[57:41] men have no access to the king
[57:44] they're outside the city they said to
[57:47] one another
[57:49] why sit we here until we die
[57:55] i want you to process that for a minute
[57:57] in other words
[57:58] they don't even know what's happening
[57:59] they don't know about elisha
[58:01] they don't know the king stomp of vex
[58:03] they don't know the king palliator
[58:05] kill elisha they don't know a miracle
[58:07] about to happen they just there
[58:10] all of these circumstances around them
[58:13] and they just say
[58:13] wait a minute hold up hold up hold up
[58:15] one minute hold up one minute
[58:20] you know we're going to die you know
[58:23] they tell us to stay here the reason
[58:24] they were there because they couldn't go
[58:26] inside so they had to be outside so
[58:28] they tell us come outside we have to die
[58:31] but do we have to stay here
[58:34] in other words is there anything we
[58:36] could do about the situation
[58:39] and this is what i want us to capture
[58:41] tonight and i
[58:42] and i and i said it on sunday and i said
[58:44] i would address this tonight
[58:46] if the lord would help me that they
[58:49] began
[58:50] to strategize they start to analyze the
[58:53] situation
[58:54] and i'm saying before many times a lot
[58:57] of us don't sit
[58:58] and analyze our situation these men sat
[59:01] there
[59:02] long enough to do all of the possible
[59:05] analysis that they could do
[59:07] they understood in their mind that all
[59:10] of the options
[59:12] has depth at the end of the equation
[59:17] so if debt is the equal sign
[59:20] the variable is sitting here or moving
[59:24] it's some real logic and analysis so
[59:28] in other words the equal sign is die die
[59:30] die
[59:31] from all appearances but we have a
[59:33] choice
[59:34] and i was making the point that no
[59:36] matter what
[59:37] you have a choice you have a choice
[59:41] tonight
[59:42] to leave this room depressed or with
[59:43] hope
[59:45] you have a choice tonight to leave this
[59:47] room saying my family will be delivered
[59:49] or you can leave this room going back
[59:51] and do what i used to do before
[59:53] you can leave this room speaking totally
[59:55] positive
[59:56] and kill negativity from your language
[1:00:00] you can leave this room tonight saying
[1:00:01] by his stripes i'm healed
[1:00:04] you can leave this room tonight saying i
[1:00:06] am going to have a revival
[1:00:08] you can leave this room tonight saying
[1:00:09] things might be bad but i'm not going to
[1:00:11] sit here and just let it get worse
[1:00:13] come on now you could leave this room
[1:00:16] tonight
[1:00:16] saying i'm not what i used to be but i'm
[1:00:20] i'm not where i'm supposed to be but i'm
[1:00:22] not where i used to be
[1:00:23] but no matter what i'm not just going to
[1:00:24] sit down and let life happen to me
[1:00:27] oh come on now i'm not gonna let what is
[1:00:30] happening around me determine
[1:00:32] what my mo i'm not gonna just sit down
[1:00:34] here and do nothing
[1:00:35] about my family i'm not gonna sit here
[1:00:38] and hope something changes what can i do
[1:00:42] different anybody with me tonight what
[1:00:44] can i do about my situation
[1:00:46] i could sit down here you know many
[1:00:48] people just freeze
[1:00:53] can we go on a little bit
[1:00:56] why sit we here until we die it's a real
[1:00:59] deep question
[1:01:01] if we say look at the analysis and i
[1:01:03] want you to go through it
[1:01:04] whether it's in your business in your
[1:01:05] life in your family
[1:01:07] whatever it is if we say we will enter
[1:01:10] into the city then the famine is in the
[1:01:14] city
[1:01:14] and we shall die there let's pause for a
[1:01:17] minute
[1:01:17] in other words first option
[1:01:20] they analyze was let us go
[1:01:24] back into what was familiar ground
[1:01:27] we could go back in the city where we
[1:01:29] may have lived there before i don't know
[1:01:31] go back into what we know we write
[1:01:33] outside at least
[1:01:35] even if we go back inside and they he
[1:01:38] wasn't gonna do is push us back out
[1:01:41] but at least i saw millia ground at
[1:01:44] least we know
[1:01:45] fred and joe and harry on the inside and
[1:01:48] at least even if we die we can say hey
[1:01:50] fred
[1:01:50] it's a long time i see you because you
[1:01:51] know out here and i can't see you
[1:01:55] but they understood the famine is also
[1:01:58] in the city
[1:01:59] and we shall die there so it is an
[1:02:02] option
[1:02:03] going into the city and dying there
[1:02:06] the reason is still better than sitting
[1:02:08] on here and dying here
[1:02:13] sitting down dying here i don't even get
[1:02:15] to see what change in the city
[1:02:18] but if i go inside at least if they
[1:02:19] change the color repeat
[1:02:21] at least i will die knowing it used to
[1:02:23] be orange and now it's blue
[1:02:25] it's still a better position in other
[1:02:27] words i'm showing you
[1:02:28] in this doing something was better than
[1:02:31] doing nothing so if we say we will enter
[1:02:35] into the city
[1:02:36] then the families in there and we shall
[1:02:38] die there and if we still
[1:02:40] sit here or sit still here we die also
[1:02:42] now
[1:02:43] therefore come and let us fall
[1:02:48] i said fall unto the host the whole host
[1:02:51] of the syrians if they save us alive
[1:02:55] we shall live and if they kill us
[1:02:59] we shall die so let us
[1:03:03] is a 50-50 situation here
[1:03:06] so these brothers analyze and i want us
[1:03:09] to
[1:03:10] take this whole analysis in our lives
[1:03:12] because a lot of people
[1:03:14] when things happen they just curl up and
[1:03:17] say okay that's it i've given up
[1:03:20] i i done i don't know i don't know what
[1:03:21] to do again i try this i try that
[1:03:24] i do it i do that you know what i just
[1:03:25] don't yes wherever i'm at
[1:03:27] you ever hear anybody talk so i can't be
[1:03:29] the only one who hear that
[1:03:31] wherever i'll put my parents let's live
[1:03:32] just taking school says i i work too
[1:03:35] hard
[1:03:35] i try too much i think the thing i just
[1:03:37] go and sit down here and
[1:03:38] you know die is it yes whatever happened
[1:03:41] virus if it was a virus if it's not
[1:03:43] embarrassing something
[1:03:44] else is that people talking so
[1:03:47] but these lepers who knew
[1:03:50] death was their portion by virtue of the
[1:03:52] disease they had
[1:03:53] still but abandonment called a dingy
[1:03:55] feet he said
[1:03:57] it wasn't much of it it was a little bit
[1:03:59] of it
[1:04:00] fade based on pure reasoning facebook
[1:04:02] and logic it was logically never
[1:04:05] put pen on paper i said i do the
[1:04:06] calculation first equation equal debt
[1:04:09] hundred percent debt if we go in into
[1:04:12] the city
[1:04:13] second question if we stay here hundred
[1:04:16] percent debt
[1:04:17] because matter time anyway because we
[1:04:19] have no food
[1:04:20] so understand this is not just the debt
[1:04:22] of the leprosy you know
[1:04:25] it's famine they were not the fear they
[1:04:27] had let me make sure i clear on this
[1:04:29] the fear they had was not dead from
[1:04:30] leprosy
[1:04:32] their fellows over that they don't
[1:04:34] accept that as a reality they were
[1:04:36] trying to extend their lapras life
[1:04:38] oh god lord help us i may have never
[1:04:41] heard it like that before
[1:04:43] the leprosy wasn't concerned the fear
[1:04:45] let me read it again
[1:04:46] if we say we will enter into the city
[1:04:48] then the famine is in the city
[1:04:50] they were concerned about the famine not
[1:04:52] their leprosy
[1:04:55] i want you to catch that so they were
[1:04:57] saying even though i have a problem
[1:05:02] i want to deal with the area of my life
[1:05:04] i can fix
[1:05:05] i can't fix the leprosy but you see my
[1:05:07] belly empty
[1:05:08] high trying to find food if we go
[1:05:11] into the city there's no food if we stay
[1:05:14] here there is no
[1:05:15] food the syrians they are not deceived i
[1:05:18] want food i want you to understand
[1:05:23] if they save us alive we shall live in
[1:05:26] other words
[1:05:27] because you will get food we will live
[1:05:29] and if they kill us we shall but die
[1:05:31] we'll be back to the same position but
[1:05:34] unlike
[1:05:35] equation one which was a hundred percent
[1:05:36] debt and equation two which is a hundred
[1:05:38] percent dead
[1:05:39] this was 50 50. we have
[1:05:42] an opportunity to make it through this
[1:05:45] thing anybody with me tonight
[1:05:47] amber branham in preaching this short
[1:05:50] about the possibility of saying you have
[1:05:52] an option to run out
[1:05:53] of where you act and run into your
[1:05:55] blessing and he showed it as christ okay
[1:05:58] and they rose up in the twilight could
[1:06:01] somebody say twilight they rose up in
[1:06:04] the twilight
[1:06:05] which was that period because they don't
[1:06:08] want nobody see them they don't want
[1:06:09] their people to see them because they're
[1:06:10] not supposed to be moving they don't
[1:06:11] want the enemy to see them
[1:06:12] to go into the camp of the syrians
[1:06:16] and when they will come to the utmost
[1:06:18] part of the camp of syria behold there
[1:06:20] was no man there
[1:06:22] hallelujah for listen for the lord
[1:06:25] had made the host of the syrians to hear
[1:06:28] a
[1:06:29] noise of chariots and a noise of horses
[1:06:32] even the noise of a great host and they
[1:06:35] said to one another
[1:06:38] oh my i don't think i'll finish tonight
[1:06:41] they said to one another lord the king
[1:06:44] of israel
[1:06:45] had hired against us the kings of the
[1:06:48] hittites
[1:06:49] and the kings of the egyptians to come
[1:06:51] upon us so
[1:06:53] the magnitude of this situation
[1:06:58] so let me let me read this other verse
[1:06:59] and then talk about it wherefore they
[1:07:01] arose and fled in the twilight
[1:07:03] and left their tents and their horses
[1:07:07] and their asses even the camp as it was
[1:07:09] and fled for their life
[1:07:10] so here it is and this
[1:07:14] i'm going to try to close up soon god
[1:07:17] is so great at fulfilling his word there
[1:07:20] are a few things here
[1:07:21] it doesn't matter to god who he uses
[1:07:23] first point
[1:07:25] god is so interested in his word being
[1:07:28] fulfilled
[1:07:28] that he could take the four most
[1:07:30] unlikely people
[1:07:32] four lepers who using logic they're not
[1:07:34] in the spirit
[1:07:35] they're not saying is the lord tell me
[1:07:36] to go they are being purely motivated
[1:07:39] by their hunger and they decide
[1:07:42] to just step out and fit as they move in
[1:07:45] the twilight
[1:07:46] lepers are not known for being
[1:07:48] physically fit
[1:07:50] it's not that they were running up on
[1:07:51] the enemy but by the branham said as
[1:07:53] they begin to move
[1:07:54] god caused a rumble so their men
[1:07:58] shuffling down taking their little choir
[1:08:00] time
[1:08:01] and as they're shuffling god amplified
[1:08:03] that shuffle into a rumble
[1:08:05] in so much that the syrians who know
[1:08:09] that the israelites have no army say
[1:08:11] vietnam
[1:08:12] you mean them fellas go and hire the
[1:08:14] hittites and hire the egyptians
[1:08:17] because they can't fight they go on and
[1:08:18] get reinforcements and those fellas
[1:08:21] run they even jump on the horses that
[1:08:24] has to be fair
[1:08:25] great fear when you even say well i'm a
[1:08:28] ride away
[1:08:29] they love their horses
[1:08:32] you see when god wants to do something
[1:08:34] how we can bring such fear to the enemy
[1:08:37] that the enemy can even catch itself
[1:08:39] they start to invent a story
[1:08:41] of what happened you know they said to
[1:08:43] themselves that the israelites
[1:08:45] hired the hittites higher the egyptians
[1:08:47] they were so
[1:08:48] running for fear fever their life they
[1:08:51] leave their horse
[1:08:52] they leave their donkey they leave the
[1:08:54] tent they leave everything
[1:08:55] and when these lepers
[1:08:59] came to the uttermost part of the camp
[1:09:02] they went into one tent
[1:09:05] i can imagine i want you to imagine they
[1:09:06] state these
[1:09:08] are men who are used to when you come
[1:09:11] a certain amount of feet from somebody
[1:09:12] say unclean unclean that was in law
[1:09:15] in fact under the law if you didn't say
[1:09:17] unclean
[1:09:18] you could have been put to death
[1:09:19] basically because as a leper you had to
[1:09:22] say unclean
[1:09:23] because it was contagious these were men
[1:09:25] who were used to tentatively
[1:09:27] easily being very careful with their
[1:09:29] movement so
[1:09:30] so they're not rushing because they
[1:09:32] ready they come and they themselves
[1:09:35] understand and this is what it is when
[1:09:37] god began to bless you
[1:09:38] you might even understand how it
[1:09:40] happened
[1:09:41] these men and the easily imagine they
[1:09:44] slowly
[1:09:45] pull back the top lane or whatever one
[1:09:47] tent and say is this real boy let me
[1:09:49] just let me just peek inside
[1:09:51] and see if some people are eventually
[1:09:53] hiding inside here
[1:09:54] and they just waiting to trap us and
[1:09:57] these leopards came in
[1:09:58] and they went into one tent they'd eat
[1:10:02] and drink and they carried them silver
[1:10:05] and gold
[1:10:06] and raiment and they went and hit it
[1:10:08] they never doesn't have a revival
[1:10:10] they they eat they get clothes they get
[1:10:13] silver
[1:10:14] they get cold and then they came again
[1:10:17] you know what nfl i say listen listen
[1:10:18] hold up hold up hold up
[1:10:20] we can go back in there they came again
[1:10:22] and entered into another tent
[1:10:24] and carried dents also and went and hit
[1:10:26] that too
[1:10:27] and then they said to one another they
[1:10:29] call another management meeting
[1:10:32] but this one was not like the first one
[1:10:35] they call another management meeting and
[1:10:38] say we do not do well
[1:10:39] we do not well we do not well this
[1:10:42] day is a day of good tidings and this
[1:10:45] good tiding is
[1:10:46] the same thing i say in the gospel and
[1:10:49] we hold our peace
[1:10:50] if we tarry till the morning light some
[1:10:53] mischief will come upon us now therefore
[1:10:57] come and we may go and tell the king's
[1:10:59] household
[1:11:00] so these men say listen this blessing is
[1:11:02] too good to keep it a secret
[1:11:06] what god has done for me is too good to
[1:11:08] keep it a secret
[1:11:10] and when god does something for you you
[1:11:12] always know
[1:11:13] when god does something for somebody you
[1:11:15] know
[1:11:16] you can't keep it a secret if you can
[1:11:19] keep it a secret
[1:11:20] then you need to get a bigger miracle
[1:11:24] you need to ask god for big things you
[1:11:25] know brother branham said that ask god
[1:11:27] for big things because i got for small
[1:11:28] things
[1:11:28] because that woman who was at the well
[1:11:31] when she found out who she was
[1:11:32] in the economy of god she said come see
[1:11:35] a man it drove her
[1:11:37] i don't know if she was shy but clearly
[1:11:39] the time she went she really didn't want
[1:11:40] to be observed
[1:11:41] so she broke all of her own rules of
[1:11:44] going when nobody else was there
[1:11:45] because what had happened to her was so
[1:11:48] tremendous
[1:11:49] she had to tell somebody and these men
[1:11:51] had such an experience that they say we
[1:11:53] cannot keep it to ourselves
[1:11:55] god gave us believers with such
[1:11:57] experiences in the supernatural realm
[1:11:59] that you were excited to tell somebody
[1:12:01] about the goodness of jesus can somebody
[1:12:03] say amen
[1:12:04] i'm trying to find a place to close out
[1:12:06] here soon
[1:12:08] so they came and called
[1:12:12] onto the porter of the city
[1:12:16] and they told him they came and called
[1:12:18] him because remember they already
[1:12:20] you know walking like normal people we
[1:12:22] came to the camp of the syrians and
[1:12:24] behold
[1:12:24] there was a man there there was no man
[1:12:27] there
[1:12:28] neither voice of a man but horses tied
[1:12:31] and ashes tied and the tents as they
[1:12:33] were
[1:12:34] and he called the porters and they tore
[1:12:37] it to the king's house
[1:12:38] within and the king arose in the night
[1:12:41] now remember friends this is
[1:12:46] hours now this is remember with a day
[1:12:48] and 24 hours
[1:12:50] it was twilight so now we're in the
[1:12:51] night time it's a lot happening
[1:12:53] quickly right so the king arose in the
[1:12:55] night and said unto his servants
[1:12:57] i will now show you what the syrians
[1:12:59] have done to us
[1:13:01] so now this is the interpretation now
[1:13:02] this year it's interpretation
[1:13:06] they know that we be hungry therefore
[1:13:09] are they going out of the camp to hide
[1:13:11] themselves in the field
[1:13:12] saying when they come out of the city we
[1:13:15] shall catch them alive and get
[1:13:16] into the city now you can imagine
[1:13:20] when the leopards here is this here
[1:13:23] this you you you could see how somebody
[1:13:25] fear
[1:13:26] and somebody perspective and somebody
[1:13:28] opinion you see like i listen to opinion
[1:13:31] the king have no clue but look how we
[1:13:33] invent a scenario
[1:13:36] and one of his servants
[1:13:39] maybe this servant had more hope maybe
[1:13:42] this woman had a little more feet
[1:13:44] one of his servants answered and said
[1:13:46] let some
[1:13:47] take i pray five of the horses
[1:13:51] that remain which are left in the city
[1:13:55] behold they are as all the material of
[1:13:57] israel that are left in it behold i say
[1:13:59] they are even as all the modular
[1:14:00] israelites
[1:14:01] that are consumed and let us send and
[1:14:04] see in other words 17 things are so bad
[1:14:06] at least you can try 75 and see
[1:14:08] if there's any truth to this thing and
[1:14:10] they took there for
[1:14:11] two chariot horses and the king sent
[1:14:14] after the horse of the syrians saying go
[1:14:16] and see
[1:14:17] and they went after them unto jordan and
[1:14:19] low all the way
[1:14:22] was full of garments and vessels in
[1:14:24] other words
[1:14:25] these men went even beyond the camp that
[1:14:28] was there
[1:14:29] and they realized that and they went
[1:14:32] unto them under jordan and lo
[1:14:33] all the way was full of garments and
[1:14:35] vessels with the syrians had cast
[1:14:37] away in their east in other words
[1:14:40] them fellas left so fast that
[1:14:43] whatever they were hearing even the
[1:14:45] little they took
[1:14:46] they drop it and was running harder so
[1:14:49] god already had them he has something
[1:14:52] because
[1:14:52] they love the horses they left things
[1:14:55] they might
[1:14:56] have whatever court they had whatever
[1:14:58] wallet they had never let's say listen
[1:14:59] wherever come in
[1:15:00] it's worse than we thought drop
[1:15:02] everything you have what even you have
[1:15:04] you're willing
[1:15:04] and run and the messengers returned and
[1:15:08] told the king
[1:15:09] and the people went out and spoiled the
[1:15:11] tents of the syrians
[1:15:12] so a measure of fine flower was sold for
[1:15:15] a shekel
[1:15:16] and two measures of barley for a shekel
[1:15:20] according to the word of the lord
[1:15:23] hallelujah
[1:15:24] you see prophecy fulfilled word for word
[1:15:27] what the prophet said
[1:15:29] and the king appointed the lord
[1:15:32] on whose hand he leaned in other words
[1:15:35] he might have a big work in the ministry
[1:15:38] he appointed
[1:15:40] the lord on whose hand he leaned to have
[1:15:42] the charge of the gate
[1:15:46] and the people when they saw the food
[1:15:51] they lost all sense of reason
[1:15:54] and thrown upon him in the gate and he
[1:15:56] died
[1:15:57] as the man of god had said so he saw it
[1:16:01] he saw the fulfillment of prophecy he
[1:16:03] saw it
[1:16:04] so this would have been now just a day
[1:16:06] later
[1:16:08] as the man of god had said who speak
[1:16:10] when the king
[1:16:11] came down to him and it came to pass
[1:16:15] as the man of god had spoken to the king
[1:16:17] saying two measures of barley for a
[1:16:19] shekel
[1:16:20] and a measure of fine flour for a shekel
[1:16:23] shall
[1:16:23] be tomorrow about this time in the gate
[1:16:26] of samaria
[1:16:28] and the lord answered the man of god and
[1:16:31] said no behold
[1:16:32] if the lord should make windows in
[1:16:34] heaven might such a thing be and he said
[1:16:35] behold thou shalt see with thine eyes
[1:16:37] but shall not
[1:16:38] eat thereof and so it fell out upon him
[1:16:41] for the people trod upon him
[1:16:43] in the gate and he died
[1:16:46] i just wanted to read one quote from the
[1:16:48] prophet
[1:16:49] before we close out from the message as
[1:16:52] the eagle stir it up
[1:16:53] her nest but ibrahim said like the
[1:16:56] lepers at the gate
[1:16:57] they said why do we lay here until we
[1:16:59] die why they said
[1:17:01] if we go in the city how many knows the
[1:17:03] story samaria was being sieged by the
[1:17:06] syrians and they were so hungry they
[1:17:07] were starving
[1:17:08] till they either back off the tree the
[1:17:10] grass off the ground
[1:17:12] and they boiled one another's children
[1:17:13] to eat do you remember that
[1:17:15] and these lepers couldn't come into the
[1:17:16] city they were leopards
[1:17:18] they thought it was contagious and so
[1:17:19] they set at the city
[1:17:21] and they said why do we sit here till we
[1:17:23] die now listen close
[1:17:24] if we go into this city we can't get
[1:17:26] nothing to eat they are dying in there
[1:17:29] if we sit here we'll die if we go down
[1:17:32] to the syrians if they kill us
[1:17:33] what if it we're going to die anyhow sit
[1:17:35] in here and they just save us
[1:17:37] why we be made whole how many remember
[1:17:39] the story
[1:17:40] all of you sure now they had to take a
[1:17:43] chance
[1:17:44] you know what the story was but that
[1:17:46] feat they started down towards the
[1:17:49] syrians
[1:17:49] and god had a big rumble to come on the
[1:17:52] desert
[1:17:53] and they ran away and left their tents
[1:17:55] and left their food
[1:17:57] they found plenty to eat and not only
[1:18:00] and i want you to catch this now
[1:18:02] and not only did it save their own life
[1:18:05] but they saved the life of the city the
[1:18:08] people
[1:18:08] how many knows that now look what a
[1:18:11] chance they had to take
[1:18:13] you don't have to take that chance but
[1:18:15] if you sit where you are
[1:18:16] your sickness if your doctors give up on
[1:18:18] you you'll die and that's all
[1:18:20] you cannot lose by trusting god and
[1:18:23] you're not
[1:18:24] asked to go down to the camp of an enemy
[1:18:27] but you're invited to the house of god
[1:18:29] who is waiting for you there's no losing
[1:18:32] there's only
[1:18:32] one way to lose that sit still
[1:18:36] and don't act on it how many says that's
[1:18:39] true amen
[1:18:40] is there's one thing god can do yes
[1:18:43] there's one thing god can do did you
[1:18:45] ever know that
[1:18:45] he can't feel that's one thing he can do
[1:18:48] he cannot feel he has to win every
[1:18:52] single time
[1:18:53] because hold on he has to win every
[1:18:57] single time because he is god heaven and
[1:19:00] earth will pass away
[1:19:01] but my word shall never fail i love what
[1:19:04] the prophet said
[1:19:05] there's only one way to lose and that's
[1:19:08] the
[1:19:08] don't act upon it that's to sit there
[1:19:11] and use the type
[1:19:12] if your doctor give up on you don't sit
[1:19:14] there do something about it
[1:19:16] and he also said listen friends when
[1:19:18] those lepers stepped out
[1:19:20] they must have had family they must have
[1:19:22] had friends they must have had
[1:19:24] connections
[1:19:24] in the city that they were kicked about
[1:19:26] because of the leprous condition
[1:19:28] but the faith that they had to do
[1:19:30] something about their situation
[1:19:33] was what led to the salvation of their
[1:19:35] family of their loved ones of the people
[1:19:37] of israel
[1:19:38] so i come tonight to challenge you to
[1:19:40] encourage you
[1:19:41] to motivate you with this simple
[1:19:43] scripture yet a powerful story
[1:19:46] as part of spiritual history because
[1:19:48] it's not a fairy tale
[1:19:50] this actually took place this is history
[1:19:52] that we're talking about
[1:19:54] without this we wouldn't have this to
[1:19:55] even talk about we wouldn't be where we
[1:19:57] at
[1:19:57] but this is how god allowed it to play
[1:20:00] out
[1:20:00] and we could look back to this day and
[1:20:03] say you know what
[1:20:04] yes i have a choice yes you have a
[1:20:07] choice and yes
[1:20:08] there's a choice to do nothing but i
[1:20:10] choose to do something
[1:20:11] i choose to make a church that will make
[1:20:14] a revival
[1:20:15] i choose to double up on praying i
[1:20:17] choose to
[1:20:18] believe that god could change every
[1:20:20] situation around
[1:20:21] i choose to believe that he didn't bring
[1:20:24] us this far to leave us
[1:20:25] i choose to believe that he is in
[1:20:27] control of my house
[1:20:29] he's in control of your house i choose
[1:20:31] to believe
[1:20:32] that the prophecy of adoption is over me
[1:20:34] it's over you
[1:20:35] i choose to believe that the promise of
[1:20:37] the holy ghost is just as real
[1:20:40] as it was in the day of pentecost i
[1:20:42] choose to believe
[1:20:43] i don't have to sit here and die but we
[1:20:45] have strength
[1:20:46] we have faith with the little we have if
[1:20:48] we have to die at all
[1:20:50] let me die out there fighting don't let
[1:20:52] me die doing nothing
[1:20:54] if i have to die let me die fighting if
[1:20:57] i have to die
[1:20:58] let me die making every effort oh
[1:21:00] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:21:02] lord remember that testimony
[1:21:04] of of that man who wanted the holy ghost
[1:21:06] he said lord if you want to fill me with
[1:21:08] the holy ghost you're going to find my
[1:21:09] bones
[1:21:10] right here in other words these lepers
[1:21:13] are willing to lay
[1:21:14] it all on the line
[1:21:18] for the chance for the chance
[1:21:21] to see things turn around are you
[1:21:23] willing to lay it all on the line
[1:21:26] not just for a chance but now for a
[1:21:28] promise because we're not playing by
[1:21:30] chance
[1:21:31] it's a promise and the promise is unto
[1:21:33] you it's unto your children
[1:21:34] it's for your family it's for your house
[1:21:37] a promise of the holy ghost
[1:21:39] a promise of revival a promise of him
[1:21:41] providing for you
[1:21:43] because you are children of the most
[1:21:44] high
[1:21:47] and if you are out of order tonight
[1:21:50] if you are not in the position you
[1:21:51] should be in spiritually
