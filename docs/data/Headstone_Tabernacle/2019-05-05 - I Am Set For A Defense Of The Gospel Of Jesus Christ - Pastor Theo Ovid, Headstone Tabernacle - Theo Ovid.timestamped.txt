[1:13:17] but mushroom
[1:13:19] the word this morning for the pin
[1:13:21] chapter one wanna read verse 19
[1:13:24] Romans chapter 1 1 first it was 16 and
[1:13:28] Matthew 24:11 2:14
[1:13:31] Philippians chapter 1 this main
[1:13:44] and this is Paul speaking and this I
[1:13:48] pray that your love may abound yet more
[1:13:51] and more knowledge and in all judgment
[1:13:54] that you may approve things that are
[1:13:57] excellent that you may be sincere
[1:14:00] our total fence till the day of Christ
[1:14:03] being filled with the fruits of
[1:14:05] righteousness which are by Jesus Christ
[1:14:07] unto the glory and praise of God but I
[1:14:10] would you should understand brethren
[1:14:13] that the things which happen unto me
[1:14:15] have fallen out rather under the
[1:14:17] furtherance of the gospel so that my
[1:14:20] bonds in Christ are manifest in all the
[1:14:24] palace and in all other places and many
[1:14:28] of the Brethren and the Lord works and
[1:14:30] confident in my buns are much more bold
[1:14:33] to speak the word without fear
[1:14:36] so you see Oh Paul is interpreting has
[1:14:39] been in prison and so on some indeed
[1:14:41] preach Christ even of envy and strife
[1:14:45] and some also of good will one preach
[1:14:49] Christ of contention not sincerely
[1:14:50] supposing to add affliction to my buns
[1:14:54] but the other of love knowing that I am
[1:14:58] set for the defense of the gospel what
[1:15:02] then notwithstanding every way whether
[1:15:05] in pretence or in truth Christ is
[1:15:07] preached and I hear and do rejoice ye
[1:15:10] and will rejoice Romans chapter 1 verse
[1:15:15] 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:15:19] Christ for it is the power of God on the
[1:15:21] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[1:15:24] the Jew first and also to the Greek and
[1:15:28] our last scripture from Matthew 24
[1:15:30] reading from verse 11 and many false
[1:15:35] prophets shall arise shall rise and
[1:15:39] shall deceive many
[1:15:40] so as many false prophets and those many
[1:15:44] guys out to deceive many
[1:15:48] first twelve and because iniquity shall
[1:15:51] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:15:56] but he that shall endure unto the end
[1:15:59] the same shall be saved and this gospel
[1:16:04] of the kingdom shall be preached in all
[1:16:07] the world for a witness unto all nations
[1:16:10] and then shall the end come let's pray
[1:16:14] father we thank you for your word and
[1:16:16] it's such a beautiful atmosphere this
[1:16:17] morning we are so unworthy but we thank
[1:16:19] you for your presence and because the
[1:16:22] blood is here father
[1:16:23] your presence is upon the blood and it
[1:16:26] give us this opportunity to have
[1:16:28] fellowship this morning may come down
[1:16:30] like you came down and a cool of the
[1:16:31] evening to Adam and a fellowship with
[1:16:33] your son may come down this evening
[1:16:35] today and have fellowship with your
[1:16:36] people around your word in Jesus name I
[1:16:39] ask it
[1:16:39] amen a name and you may be seated oh
[1:16:41] praise the Lord we have communion this
[1:16:45] evening and it's such a blessing again
[1:16:48] to be here in the presence of God that
[1:16:51] part is very important in the presence
[1:16:54] of the Lord well this morning our title
[1:16:58] I want to take it from there was
[1:17:00] seventeen of that scripture in
[1:17:01] Philippians and the title is I am set
[1:17:05] for a defense of the gospel of Jesus
[1:17:08] Christ I have an inspiration the feet of
[1:17:12] the fathers Malachi 4:5 and 6b who'll I
[1:17:15] send you Elijah the Prophet before the
[1:17:17] coming of the Great and dreadful day of
[1:17:18] the Lord he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:17:20] father's to the children and the hearts
[1:17:22] of the children to their fathers lest I
[1:17:24] come and smite the earth with a curse
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:27] so I ready for the word this morning all
[1:17:29] right something upon my heart like to
[1:17:31] share with you and the trust will be
[1:17:33] heavy fine and strengthen and build you
[1:17:35] up and the small holy feet okay the
[1:17:40] position of price was revealed in and
[1:17:43] was revealed by brother Branham that
[1:17:46] prophet of Malachi for therefore he
[1:17:48] could not build a denomination or name
[1:17:51] for himself so once you see Jesus you
[1:17:55] can't build your own tabernacle and
[1:17:57] that's what Peter and then when Jesus
[1:17:59] was adopted this is how we want to build
[1:18:01] one for you one for Moses was Elijah a
[1:18:03] voice said shut up a voice said hear him
[1:18:06] doorbell no tabernacle all this he
[1:18:09] afterwards was Jesus and that's what we
[1:18:12] have to come to that spot to see Jesus
[1:18:14] therefore he could nibble in
[1:18:16] denomination on in himself he knew that
[1:18:19] denominational spirit organization
[1:18:21] spirit a man is not of God even though
[1:18:24] it means well and it looks good he knew
[1:18:27] that man inspired systems of churches
[1:18:29] that fall from the word system of
[1:18:32] intellect command would fail and fall so
[1:18:36] he could declare this statement and this
[1:18:38] is from this data public man Christ
[1:18:40] never sent me to build an organization
[1:18:44] Christ sent me to build individuals to
[1:18:49] the stature of Jesus Christ that there
[1:18:51] might be a power house and a dwelling
[1:18:54] place of the Spirit by the word
[1:18:58] individual to that place not build an
[1:19:01] organization or a greater denomination
[1:19:04] but to build individuals the sons and
[1:19:06] daughters of God could we give the Lord
[1:19:08] a shout the Bible teaches us he came
[1:19:11] unto his own his own received him not
[1:19:13] but as many as received him to them gave
[1:19:16] he power to become so the power is given
[1:19:19] for you to become that you can make

[1:38:55] bitterness of course and human all kind
[1:38:57] of thing like bitterness and a guy was
[1:38:59] telling me about this alternative
[1:39:03] medicine place in central
[1:39:05] woody with cancer cases and stuff on the
[1:39:07] city number one cause a Kansas is oats
[1:39:09] oats or is another imaginary thing or
[1:39:15] just love you know he said a place
[1:39:17] called here be hot lunch and these odds
[1:39:21] does produce chemicals
[1:39:23] just as forgiveness has produced
[1:39:26] chemical so when somebody ever ought it
[1:39:29] has produced something inside idea that
[1:39:31] is bring get negative on the body or
[1:39:34] since I done a grudge that lunch I
[1:39:38] crunch like a decisional or tan your
[1:39:41] long time I guess it Costner gives your
[1:39:43] family again somebody ever audio you
[1:39:45] don't want to drop it your mind in it
[1:39:47] you grow in it you take and rent free

[1:40:22] or the in church ball in a man but they
[1:40:25] up to no good but will be like that no
[1:40:28] because if you want to break into the
[1:40:30] realm of this third full promise of the
[1:40:32] rapture you have to break in the realm
[1:40:34] of the Spirit and say this based upon
[1:40:37] forgiveness to pull you on the illusion
[1:40:39] of charity because only child he could

[1:41:07] pow I'm preferable that's easy just
[1:41:11] Killebrew common I kill him but when God
[1:41:17] along to forget the gun and then
[1:41:19] something came over here he said we
[1:41:22] should happen all the time something
[1:41:24] came over him he fell a love for the
[1:41:27] pull and he pull no comment because they
[1:41:29] see as far as the bullets concerned but
[1:41:30] a Panem on his territory as far as
[1:41:33] butter brown is concern
[1:41:35] where you have dominion over every
[1:41:37] creeping thing everything that creepeth
[1:41:39] upon the earth he's going back to Eden
[1:41:40] so the birds evils in the atmosphere and
[1:41:43] burn around getting his atmosphere and
[1:41:45] then there's a class of atmospheres
[1:41:47] which who have the power now who have
[1:41:50] the power now most fear versus
[1:41:52] atmosphere the bull in his atmosphere
[1:41:54] he's coming down

[1:43:34] behalf

[1:43:54] a man god no Coloma his Moses wasn't
[1:43:56] that messy all Moses is a new Moses with
[1:43:59] Moses they're talking about not all
[1:44:01] Moses was fighting up back there they
[1:44:03] knew he was there's a new man here I'm
[1:44:05] gonna make you a new man this morning
[1:44:07] the old man go get killed dead you
[1:44:11] become a new man this morning a real son
[1:44:13] of God or chlorine ago there was a
[1:44:16] runaway my no you have noted he is
[1:44:19] commissioned to bring the pure back to
[1:44:21] that mountain and we are noted and we
[1:44:24] are her mission to bring you the
[1:44:26] dynamics because dynamics are gonna
[1:44:28] strike you have to be ready for dynamics
[1:44:31] because dynamics is coming I thought we
[1:44:36] were dedicated for brother the gospel of
[1:44:37] the kingdom but a Branham said this
[1:44:46] thing can actually change
[1:44:48] she had the life of the devil in her as
[1:44:51] soon as she disbelieve God's Word she
[1:44:53] accepted a life of the devil
[1:44:55] because she accepted his teachings so
[1:44:57] teachings and false teaching have a
[1:44:59] false life tradition of a true life oh
[1:45:02] my commentary and now God's and the Holy
[1:45:05] Ghost and Holy Ghost is God himself he's
[1:45:07] the one that makes oneness between God
[1:45:09] and man
[1:45:10] what makes oneness the Holy Ghost what
[1:45:14] make oneness the Holy Ghost not we all
[1:45:17] teach and believe in the same thing no
[1:45:18] no the Holy Ghost priest one is no watch
[1:45:22] and then but Iran said this year stay
[1:45:24] with the word is the seer the Lord the
[1:45:27] separate from the it is to break your
[1:45:28] fellowship with God so I prefer to brick
[1:45:30] foolish red man that a big fat red God
[1:45:32] is the word first I tell associate
[1:45:36] ministers me and say listen we
[1:45:37] fellowship together here but as I preach
[1:45:39] what I said once all I can call you over
[1:45:41] the wood that's it would mean I say I am
[1:45:43] with you because already wood once
[1:45:45] you're off the wood that is eternal
[1:45:46] I draw my line with the wisdom we sell
[1:45:48] brethren still love you
[1:45:50] what is the wood I cannot compromise on
[1:45:52] that word I'm a word son halleluyah
[1:45:56] scriptures son you have to show me the
[1:45:59] new scripture
[1:46:00] you're just for me in butter brown
[1:46:01] decision oh yeah sorry scripture first
[1:46:02] because when a Branham came to review
[1:46:04] the scripture say if you can't put it in
[1:46:06] Scripture Ino we're bringing your no
[1:46:09] mystery offside you scriptures have to
[1:46:10] be in the world because I'm mysterious
[1:46:12] picture a previously hidden truth no
[1:46:15] divinely revealed so any mystery man
[1:46:17] bringing her to have 54 a mystery no
[1:46:20] scripture away by that ministry yes I
[1:46:22] enjoy predictive my angel come on heaven
[1:46:24] much of some some states of Europe or
[1:46:27] somewhere if I ain't no homo heaven
[1:46:30] would wings they know normal they don't
[1:46:34] normal walking in general is about wings
[1:46:36] yeah they check em out know when butter
[1:46:44] man am wasn't getting me seven seals he
[1:46:46] say compared what he ends it was telling
[1:46:49] them with the scriptures so he was just
[1:46:51] say the angel said he just said no in
[1:46:53] psycho neato according to the scripture
[1:46:54] because the Bible was written before the
[1:46:57] foundation of the world that's the new
[1:46:59] book there's a whole book did you get
[1:47:05] that your name was in that book the only
[1:47:08] reason you are here because your name is
[1:47:10] in the book the only reason you could
[1:47:12] respond to the gospel to call your name
[1:47:13] had to be in that book the devil is it
[1:47:16] all except those whose names written and
[1:47:20] those things were written go rejoice and
[1:47:22] shall prevail because I'm John choice
[1:47:25] Danny was shortened or give the Lord
[1:47:28] some praise as people my God my God
[1:47:34] you see - you shout a neon worship and
[1:47:37] this is normal atmosphere this is what
[1:47:39] we do this where we live but you were
[1:47:41] some churches there you forget about it
[1:47:42] you say Amen to have the available
[1:47:45] I don't know comfortable you're feeling
[1:47:48] the different kind of thing once I got
[1:47:50] there because the only N word word would
[1:47:52] know nothing about the spirit
[1:47:53] but when Easter rose when Jesus rose
[1:47:55] from the dead he rose to bring life into
[1:47:57] the church dive on the Upper Room there
[1:48:00] wasn't say number in a fire fallen upon

[1:48:14] the room was too small in the upper room
[1:48:16] that the busted open impedance toggle
[1:48:19] out but what this fell asleep beside to
[1:48:24] correct that he said these people are
[1:48:26] not drunk as you suppose it's not that
[1:48:29] kind of liquor

[1:48:32] kind of wine altogether yes the high yes
[1:48:36] yes yes justify the high on Jesus the
[1:48:40] high on the Holy Ghost
[1:48:42] just as high on the spirit the high
[1:48:44] already anointed but this is that that
[1:48:51] the Prophet Joel speaker it shall come
[1:48:53] to pass I poured my spirit oh but you
[1:48:56] know what up on this whole time Holy
[1:48:57] Spirit and the devil won't go near it

[1:49:05] chuckle I am it will save you when

[1:59:53] Barbara is called feet 1953 he said that
[2:00:00] I believe that the Church of the Living
[2:00:02] God
[2:00:03] I want you to see it I believe the
[2:00:06] Church of the Living God has come out to
[2:00:08] Kennish Barnea
[2:00:09] I believe we had a judgment seat now
[2:00:11] just before crossing over let's not make
[2:00:13] that mistake that they made when they
[2:00:15] got it out over the elect out of each
[2:00:17] Drive men and send them over twelve
[2:00:19] spies ten of them come back same cannot
[2:00:21] be done we are just grasshoppers in
[2:00:23] their sight they see the world but this
[2:00:25] is a good idea when men go into the same
[2:00:28] land and then come back with an e report
[2:00:31] and to come up with a different port and
[2:00:33] all of them world 12 saw the same thing
[2:00:35] all twelve short irons all 12 saw creeps
[2:00:38] all all 12 all the land but then come
[2:00:39] back quickly
[2:00:40] and said we can't take it because em
[2:00:42] fellas real big ten fellows pump in some
[2:00:44] heavy ayah and the mustard if you see
[2:00:47] their muscles
[2:00:48] Caleb and Joshua however have nothing to
[2:00:50] do with the muscles and height and
[2:00:52] condition they I'm not doing that so
[2:00:55] when they came up to the cap always
[2:00:57] dramatize it
[2:00:58] they camp in a depressed mode called
[2:01:00] when people negative and noise community
[2:01:02] everybody chaotic a Catholic our humble
[2:01:04] church camp we can take it home come
[2:01:05] Karthik it cannot be shortest man get up
[2:01:08] box by Ramesses he was very sure he got
[2:01:11] talk from be a way to honor him take a
[2:01:13] box and star upon it
[2:01:14] I said we are wherever to one get em
[2:01:16] John so that's the God we serve
[2:01:19] take a short man same available and
[2:01:22] seamless at shorty short is man he came
[2:01:30] to mobility job but he was right
[2:01:34] because as long as war with us we can do
[2:01:38] all things
[2:01:40] do you believe that that's the good
[2:01:43] enough literally like I wanna have to
[2:01:45] aim and I believe that all things Joshua
[2:01:55] wasn't no trained experienced man on the
[2:01:58] decline
[2:01:59] Moses died and go to go there cries oh
[2:02:01] God about 40 days mourning on Moses got
[2:02:06] on the time without him God always have
[2:02:09] ahead of the game he said Moses my
[2:02:11] servant is dead no Joshua take the
[2:02:13] people over go tell Josh for three days
[2:02:16] because one over Barnsley the elders
[2:02:18] come to judgments if we read final month
[2:02:20] again the river was go down we go we'd
[2:02:22] across we Jordan weed legally the cross
[2:02:26] and especially go have Joshua tell them
[2:02:28] three days began over then them Levites
[2:02:32] had the a cassette device AK would go
[2:02:34] first and then fellas go along in a
[2:02:36] water high you know and then so let's
[2:02:38] take the best fit thanks men who believe
[2:02:41] and listen behind you they walking
[2:02:43] straight down shut down
[2:02:44] like I guess I guess everything is fine
[2:02:46] and once the foot hit Jordan River or an
[2:02:50] open up

[2:04:54] a step up coming for the church these
[2:04:58] things that you're now seeing are going
[2:05:00] to be just little things after a while
[2:05:02] something is moving and I say this by
[2:05:06] the power of the revelation of Jesus
[2:05:08] Christ and whom I everyone in our
[2:05:11] adoption in our baptism we have come to
[2:05:13] place but there is some key that will
[2:05:16] unlock something here now he saw the
[2:05:18] book see with seven seals
[2:05:20] daniel saw the same and when the seven
[2:05:23] thunders uttered their voices is it all
[2:05:24] right that was what was in the scripture
[2:05:27] it will be revealed elastic we at that
[2:05:29] time we are Kalish right now so he was
[2:05:33] saying that under smaller key to unlock
[2:05:35] something there oh my oh my hallelujah
[2:05:40] yeah a few nights ago I went about his
[2:05:43] foot over the Pataca Kentucky and where
[2:05:46] a bottle was at me I said it's just kept
[2:05:49] burning in my heart a message that I
[2:05:51] know that something God has promised on
[2:05:53] the open of of the power yet I am
[2:06:00] waiting off for him
[2:06:02] which I believe will appear to me
[2:06:03] visibly I see it with reverence I've
[2:06:06] seen him twice pause it was a vision he
[2:06:09] was standing in the air
[2:06:10] one night I stood I even broke a straw
[2:06:12] off the feet put in my mouth and chewed
[2:06:14] it look again
[2:06:15] I said sure it is another vision I stood
[2:06:17] there in the broom sedge looking I've
[2:06:19] been praying all night and I look again
[2:06:21] I seen him with his foot like that is
[2:06:23] unfolded looking towards the east
[2:06:25] I walk along this way and cleared my
[2:06:27] truth then he looking wrong at me
[2:06:28] raised on his arms and I fainted and
[2:06:30] didn't come till next morning and I have
[2:06:33] an idea what he looks like I've been
[2:06:36] feeling for the last few months that I
[2:06:38] will see him again and pretty soon he
[2:06:40] revealed something that's fixin to
[2:06:43] comfort or brother if I have it right
[2:06:45] God forgive me if I'm wrong but serious
[2:06:47] in the scripture seeing that when he
[2:06:50] rolls on a senator he received a new
[2:06:52] name no one know about it then I see him
[2:06:54] common in his power
[2:06:55] I went over don't know other bother me
[2:06:58] today let me alone and that night I in
[2:07:02] which I prayed I cried I called Billy I
[2:07:04] said what pray cause he give out and he
[2:07:06] called out 25 so but abandoned know
[2:07:09] something about a break for what what
[2:07:10] her feet does look he's looking for
[2:07:13] something he's like over something to
[2:07:15] happen listen to his approach I say what
[2:07:18] Prakash yeah you said call 25 all don't
[2:07:21] chew that line there was nothing that he
[2:07:22] could see that I looked at only a woman
[2:07:24] I was hard of hearing in one ear so I
[2:07:26] keep talking as a corner group and when
[2:07:29] I got to the other group the very first
[2:07:32] one in line a poor daddy leading his boy
[2:07:34] he said brother branham I come from
[2:07:36] Cincinnati
[2:07:37] I brought my boy over to Orange borrow
[2:07:39] brought him down my bus said I'll never
[2:07:41] could get a prayer card and get in the
[2:07:43] line I'm so happy to be here now I
[2:07:45] looked I said what's the matter with
[2:07:48] your boy he had his head dong-young fell
[2:07:50] about 18 he said when he was about eight
[2:07:52] years old he hit a dynamite clap with a
[2:07:56] hammer and it blowed his eye completely
[2:08:00] out it wasn't nothing but a socket on
[2:08:03] his eye the end of the cap pasted right
[2:08:06] into the site
[2:08:07] shattered every nerve and said ever
[2:08:09] since we have built about you we believe
[2:08:12] God would answer your prayer if you pray
[2:08:14] for my boy they just suck it's not the
[2:08:18] ice blown out since he's eat he's not
[2:08:22] eating so he's in that condition ten
[2:08:25] years standing there with her all Biddy
[2:08:28] Jackie no not dirty I don't mean to see
[2:08:30] that washed out they should open his
[2:08:32] underclothes here just a typical
[2:08:34] old daddy holding his boy so Reverend
[2:08:37] fine-looking young man stand in there as
[2:08:38] well come here brother let me pray for
[2:08:40] you I put my hands on him and said
[2:08:43] Heavenly Father I pray thee if thou will
[2:08:45] corner moonshee upon him and open his
[2:08:47] blinded eye when I asked it was too big
[2:08:50] in the auditorium had two big lights
[2:08:53] shining like this I said son look up
[2:08:54] that light and see if you can see the
[2:08:57] poor fellow look along this way trying
[2:08:59] to see the light in a dark corner I turn
[2:09:01] his head I said no up this way and I got
[2:09:03] his face too and a back way he said I'm
[2:09:05] sorry kind sir I can't see nothing his
[2:09:08] dad said brother branham if you want a
[2:09:11] powerful flashlight right in his eye he
[2:09:13] will never know it every nerve in his
[2:09:16] eye is boosted I said and you still have
[2:09:20] faith
[2:09:27] you know watch this but run prevail he
[2:09:30] sealed my father tell him if you put a
[2:09:34] shot in his eye he can see that and he
[2:09:37] still see your feet to believe let's
[2:09:42] continue no usually I would let the boy
[2:09:47] go see and said no son the Lord bless
[2:09:50] you may give you a sight but yeah what I
[2:09:53] had in my heart that's a different thing
[2:09:57] so normally you pray bless the people
[2:09:59] and go go do this I don't want that but
[2:10:02] because of something in his heart which
[2:10:04] connected to this pull this power this
[2:10:09] expectation this acting upon what you
[2:10:12] know God is about to unfold or break or
[2:10:15] reveal or manifest he is that not a
[2:10:18] lesson go no swatches so usually that
[2:10:23] says Lord bless you may give you your
[2:10:25] sight but dear what I had in my heart
[2:10:28] down there he said what he did to that
[2:10:31] tree could be that tree demands it from
[2:10:33] you if you shall see this mountain
[2:10:35] I said who ought to have feet if anybody
[2:10:39] or traffic a machine back yonder from a
[2:10:42] little baby the fullest thing I remember
[2:10:43] was God speaking to me in a vision don't
[2:10:45] really age you never feel one time when
[2:10:47] he met with me in the person of the
[2:10:49] angel he said I'll never fail you I'll
[2:10:51] never I'll be with you I thought who
[2:10:53] ought to have faith I ought to be
[2:10:55] ashamed so he is dealing with himself
[2:10:58] and he is challenging himself hallelujah
[2:11:02] are you with me I kept standing there I
[2:11:05] thought if this is true if God said I am
[2:11:07] the vine ye are the branches
[2:11:09] if BP in court then we are energized by
[2:11:12] a spirit then my hands are his hands so
[2:11:16] put around is going too much I don't
[2:11:17] know he has taken the scripture he has
[2:11:20] taken a whole of faith he is challenging
[2:11:22] himself a condition and said ten years
[2:11:25] demand blind he have no ideas either
[2:11:27] there or glory to God hallelujah
[2:11:36] I look at the boy again and I begin to
[2:11:39] feel something inside of me no friends I
[2:11:45] know it will work I've seen it in the
[2:11:48] other child when something would
[2:11:49] actually happen you can't Bluff it it's
[2:11:52] got to be there it's got to be the thing
[2:11:59] so this is not bluffing is this huh ah
[2:12:01] hallelujah
[2:12:03] then he just talked a little bit I
[2:12:04] remember the night the maniac walked in
[2:12:06] a platform in Portland Oregon many of
[2:12:09] you have read it he said cause the man
[2:12:11] will walk in a compact form in seen a
[2:12:12] hundred and two hundred forty pounds 7
[2:12:15] foot tall walk to the platform five
[2:12:18] hundred preachers run back he spit in my
[2:12:20] face and say you hypocrite you receive
[2:12:22] love man you call yourself a man of God
[2:12:24] I break every bone in your miserable
[2:12:26] body tonight we just jump off the
[2:12:29] platform if you hear enough with your
[2:12:34] ears and you do have a spirit with them
[2:12:36] I'll break every bone but watch this and
[2:12:43] they scatter back and usually I would
[2:12:45] have done nor what to have done but when
[2:12:48] I turned to that man I know he was right
[2:12:50] there he turned to the man you know that
[2:12:53] my was defeated right there it's

[2:19:11] Lord will gonna give me a tabernacle to
[2:19:14] preacher I was merely a young boy then
[2:19:16] the girl I was going with which was soon

[2:19:39] Baptist at me about that so he's in a
[2:19:40] vision actually so you see in this year
[2:19:42] and then while I was there there was a
[2:19:47] voice spoke to me and took me up so he's
[2:19:51] going to next level now I noticed his
[2:19:53] Tabernacle just about his titties in
[2:19:55] right now and there was so many people
[2:19:57] till they were just packed all in in the
[2:19:59] Tabernacle in this condition about his

[2:20:03] behind the pulpit saying God how good
[2:20:05] you are you ought to give me this top
[2:20:07] anarcho at that time the angel of the
[2:20:11] Lord speak to me and said but this is
[2:20:13] not your tabernacle I said then Lord

[2:20:24] don't in a grove through a trees setting
[2:20:26] just level 20 feet or 30 and they looked
[2:20:29] like fruit trees and there were great
[2:20:30] big green pockets I noticed a my right
[2:20:33] hand until my left hand
[2:20:35] there was an empty bucket on either side
[2:20:37] I said what about these he said you were
[2:20:39] to plant in them so I pull a limb from
[2:20:42] the tree to my right places in the
[2:20:44] bucket to the right side I live on the
[2:20:46] left placing the Box in a left side
[2:20:47] quickly it grows all the way to the
[2:20:49] skies so always envision are you with me

[2:20:55] he said holding hands and Canada to to
[2:20:58] food there of cigars they planted he

[2:21:12] right and the other hand fell a great
[2:21:14] ello plum mellow and right he said eat
[2:21:16] the fruit thereof because it is present
[2:21:18] and I ate from one and from the other
[2:21:21] very delicious you know the vision and
[2:21:23] just then I held my hands up was a shout
[2:21:26] in the glory of God all of a sudden that
[2:21:28] pillar of fire came down over the top of
[2:21:30] those trees and a roar lightning flash
[2:21:33] I'm the wind's blowing hard and the
[2:21:35] leaves began blowing on the trees and I
[2:21:36] looked way down there stood the shape of
[2:21:39] this Tabernacle the whitsett's know the
[2:21:42] end where the purple would be there were
[2:21:44] tree trees on those three trees taking
[2:21:47] shape of tree crosses and I noticed that
[2:21:49] both plums and apples were gathered in
[2:21:52] clusters around the middle cross so this
[2:21:56] this vision of trees no was transferred
[2:21:59] to tree crosses where he said the middle
[2:22:01] crosses where the fruits on both sides
[2:22:03] was gotta at that cross are you at me
[2:22:06] separately okay

[2:22:15] cross do my arms around it and the
[2:22:17] wind's begin to shake and the fruit on
[2:22:18] the cross it fell all over me I was so
[2:22:20] happy and rejoicing he said eat the
[2:22:22] fruit thereof because it is pleasant and

[2:22:28] said the harvest is right the labors of
[2:22:31] few he said no when you come to yourself

[2:45:49] of false teaching and that teaching
[2:45:51] become a doctrine know that doctrine
[2:45:55] become incarnate and a false prophet and
[2:45:59] then he went on to Rome nice your own no
[2:46:04] the council was held they elected a head
[2:46:07] Bishop and by doing this the United the
[2:46:10] church and state together and he chopped
[2:46:12] this ball off the white horse jump on
[2:46:14] his red horse and he could kill anybody
[2:46:17] now in false teaching they're killing
[2:46:19] over you know because in addition false
[2:46:21] prophet mode but when you see they kept
[2:46:24] connected
[2:46:25] but sticked then they have power and
[2:46:27] authority they jump from the white horse
[2:46:30] to the red horse nobody coming to kill

[2:46:49] out hallelujah 68 million was put to the
[2:46:53] death on the room no wonder he couldn't
[2:46:55] person himself in the personified name
[2:46:58] called dead he show us no god only knows
[2:47:02] here we go god only knows how many he
[2:47:08] cost the spiritually day by his auntie
[2:47:11] by the word teaching this is the one he
[2:47:15] put the sixty-eight million to the sword
[2:47:17] and killed but there are billions died
[2:47:19] spiritual on this false teaching
[2:47:24] no wonder you could take the name called
[2:47:27] dead when the scripture you could find I
[2:47:31] am the holy ghost where in the Bible
[2:47:34] they even that there isn't one script
[2:47:36] not even one to support that damnable
[2:47:39] doctrine they could find it under
[2:47:41] Hinduism I am God you could find it
[2:47:44] under other religions but not one
[2:47:46] scripture Oh hallelujah praise God you
[2:47:52] see the writer you see what taken place
[2:47:54] the Antichrist he was dead to begin with
[2:47:57] he was innocent then they only receive a
[2:48:00] crown a chakram
[2:48:01] see the United States and state and he
[2:48:03] was over bother them Antichrist was
[2:48:05] Satan in the form of man then we find
[2:48:09] out this mystery and the church the four
[2:48:10] states of his ministry he is called the
[2:48:13] beasts so first was the Antichrist then
[2:48:16] was false prophet then the final
[2:48:19] incarnation of this being is called all
[2:48:24] that Pelin it shall worship the peace
[2:48:28] whose names are not written in the
[2:48:30] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[2:48:33] foundation of the world
[2:48:34] Oh glory to God therefore when the
[2:48:36] competition know who we worship you know
[2:48:39] why you're worshiping you know what your
[2:48:41] worship or glory they're gonna always
[2:48:43] gonna be system to come to worship the
[2:48:45] Christ Oh hallelujah come to worship the
[2:48:48] Lord who put your name on that Lamb's
[2:48:50] Book hallelujah now I want you to notice
[2:48:54] the fourth horse was peeled the first
[2:48:57] one was white
[2:48:57] next was red next was black and the
[2:49:01] fourth one was all three together mixed
[2:49:04] up make up the peel it's mixed up
[2:49:07] pierced but become four but Istrian one
[2:49:12] all mixed up notice the Antichrist
[2:49:15] pregnant hold on his beasts ministry God
[2:49:17] sent for a beast to combat it
[2:49:19] every time the Beast rode on his horse
[2:49:21] God unknowns a ministry and God sent his
[2:49:25] beast to combat it because whenever the
[2:49:27] enemy come like a flood the Spirit of
[2:49:29] God wins a standard no remember when the
[2:49:32] Antichrist spirit Road he was in a
[2:49:34] teaching ministry the Antichrist first
[2:49:36] wrote in a teaching ministry watch what
[2:49:39] window to meet him the land of his high
[2:49:41] batida for glory record so when is a
[2:49:44] false teaching called a sandal an
[2:49:46] anointed the challenge false teaching
[2:49:48] and set it in the sense of the gospel or
[2:49:51] glory of God are you with me tonight so
[2:49:54] once that anointing comes a false
[2:49:56] teaching what's your poison

[2:50:02] through it all glory of God hallelujah
[2:50:05] praise God there is gonna be a glorious
[2:50:08] church that's why the professor when the
[2:50:10] bride get to know the two spirits
[2:50:13] working in a friend of the church and
[2:50:15] discern the two spirits and by God's
[2:50:18] Spirit he's in and which time she been
[2:50:22] invincible army it's not just a deserted
[2:50:25] estimate static
[2:50:26] it's the bus it is to come against it
[2:50:29] it's the rapture it iced and sat in the
[2:50:34] sense of the gospel this is the gospel
[2:50:36] of Jesus Christ this is what the early
[2:50:38] fathers had early fathers reason church
[2:50:45] he said have found those who say they're
[2:50:46] Jews are not wanted to be liars liars
[2:50:49] lying on God Saint Martin when the
[2:50:53] Antichrist riding the false teaching God
[2:50:55] sent his teaching of the word the Lion
[2:50:57] of the tribe of Judah which is the word
[2:50:59] made manifest in the Holy Spirit and the
[2:51:02] Holy Spirit is here the man is magnified
[2:51:05] himself which is the word and that's the
[2:51:07] reason the early church had healings and
[2:51:09] miracles and visions and powers is
[2:51:11] because it was the Living Word listen in
[2:51:13] the form of the Lion of the tribe of
[2:51:16] Judah rise not to come back that they
[2:51:19] got it he sends his power Antichrist God
[2:51:22] sends his word Antichrist false teaching

[3:00:03] be right I know he has blessed you I
[3:00:05] didn't either
[3:00:06] but it was the same organizational route
[3:00:09] that Balaam took is defiance the
[3:00:10] godswood is false teaching how long were
[3:00:13] the people know we can't all be one
[3:00:15] group we can't all be one church God
[3:00:18] never set it up up to knows its it
[3:00:20] seemed like a lack of revelation that
[3:00:22] what we call Israel is twelve tribes
[3:00:25] it's not one people it's 12 types Judah
[3:00:29] different either all of them Judah
[3:00:33] tribes that had their banners that are
[3:00:37] the culture in the way of things
[3:00:39] God they take our twelve sons it's the
[3:00:43] strength of Israel that make up Israel

[3:01:36] okay you see what what understand
[3:01:41] there's no one knows what we need to
[3:01:43] know you need to know we will take a
[3:01:44] profit to get a revelation because God
[3:01:46] has no other way of bringing out the
[3:01:48] scriptural revelations except by a
[3:01:51] prophet
[3:01:51] the would always comes to a prophet
[3:01:53] always will and this is a law of God as
[3:01:55] evident by his casual search of the
[3:01:57] scripture the unchanging God with
[3:02:00] unchanging ways invariably sent his
[3:02:02] prophet in every age where the people
[3:02:04] have strayed from divine order that
[3:02:06] booty illusions and the people have any
[3:02:07] part from the word called always send a
[3:02:09] servant to these people that order to
[3:02:12] correct false teaching and lead the
[3:02:15] people back to God
[3:02:16] what is sin righteousness polluted what
[3:02:19] is the dull tree the right act polluted
[3:02:20] what is a lie the treatment
[3:02:22] misrepresented a perversion look at
[3:02:24] Hananiah a profusion of the original
[3:02:26] world look at Balaam a profusion
[3:02:28] original world look at Zedekiah a
[3:02:29] perversion of the original world so
[3:02:32] there is a regional world and the
[3:02:33] original world the spoken word is the
[3:02:35] original seed once it has changed once
[3:02:38] is perfected it's not more original then
[3:02:42] you get a different result altogether
[3:02:43] isn't that right hallelujah praise God
[3:02:45] and what all unbelief is a perversion of
[3:02:48] belief you have to deny the truth in
[3:02:51] order to take a position therefore to
[3:02:53] reject Jews you have to accept a lie you
[3:02:56] have to reject truth before you can
[3:02:58] except a lie
[3:02:59] oh praise God and but Isaac said
[3:03:01] exceptional life changes you Oh glory to
[3:03:04] God what will happen when you accept the
[3:03:05] truth you shall know the truth and the
[3:03:09] truth shall make you free

[3:10:20] signs shall follow them that believe the
[3:10:23] Lord Himself went everywhere with them
[3:10:24] confirming the word with signs following
[3:10:27] the purpose of the gospel is to prove he
[3:10:30] is raised from the dead

[3:15:38] Christ is being preached all glory to
[3:15:41] God acts 20:24 it is called the gospel

[3:15:49] that I might finish my course with joy
[3:15:51] that the ministry which I have received
[3:15:53] the Lord Jesus to testify of the gospel
[3:15:55] of the grace of God Romans 1:16 is
[3:15:58] called the gospel of Christ he said for
[3:16:01] I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ
[3:16:02] for it is the power of God on the
[3:16:04] salvation Ephesians 1:13 called the
[3:16:07] gospel of salvation in whom you also
[3:16:09] trusted after you heard a word of truth
[3:16:11] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[3:16:13] after you believed you were sealed with
[3:16:15] the Holy Spirit of promise the gospel
[3:16:19] brings the captive out of prison the
[3:16:22] cocktail the gospel comes and free the
[3:16:24] prisoners isn't that right
[3:16:25] Oh glory to God hallelujah
[3:16:27] praise God almost done praise God
[3:16:31] Paul said hallelujah in the last days
[3:16:34] perilous times I'm come for men shall be
[3:16:36] lovers of their own selves covetous
[3:16:37] boasters proud plasters blasphemers true
[3:16:40] speakers false accusers incontinent
[3:16:42] fierce of pleasures more than lovers of
[3:16:44] god having a form of godliness but
[3:16:46] denying the power thereof detour
[3:16:50] Galatians I marvel that you soon move
[3:16:52] from from the grace of Christ to another
[3:16:54] gospel which is not another there is
[3:16:57] some that trouble you who would prefer
[3:16:58] the gospel of Christ and don't we on a
[3:17:01] heaven
[3:17:03] I say unto you if any man preach any
[3:17:05] other gospel unto you that what we have
[3:17:07] received let him be a kiss
[3:17:09] oh my 2nd Corinthians 13 says but I fear
[3:17:13] least by any means as the serpent
[3:17:15] beguiled Eve through his subtlety so
[3:17:18] your minds should be corrupted from the
[3:17:20] simplicity that is in Christ he call it
[3:17:23] equals but the simplicity that is in
[3:17:25] Christ and that's why we said the
[3:17:27] revelation of Jesus Christ is not my
[3:17:28] simplicity in the most illiterate person
[3:17:31] it is not know my how to explain it
[3:17:34] it is ruined by your revelation of Jesus
[3:17:36] Christ glory to God
[3:17:38] so the gospel watch the gospel common I
[3:17:41] believe is the Word of God that is true
[3:17:43] in one sense but the Word of God is not
[3:17:45] gospel alone the Word of God is a seed
[3:17:48] that produces the gospel or give the
[3:17:51] Lord a shout so the word is not a gospel
[3:17:54] the word by itself is not the gospel the
[3:17:57] word is the seed that produces the
[3:17:59] gospel when you're sowing seed you don't
[3:18:02] dig it up every morning there's even
[3:18:03] come to pass if you do your she will
[3:18:05] never come up you got to plant it and
[3:18:06] committed to the earth and let it come
[3:18:08] up alone or glory the endtime message
[3:18:10] and messenger should meet with intent
[3:18:12] conditions Oh glory to God you say look
[3:18:15] brother branham the gospel is the will
[3:18:17] of God not altogether brother the Bible
[3:18:19] said the gospel coming up they would
[3:18:20] only but to power and demonstration of
[3:18:22] the Holy Ghost I want any Minister
[3:18:24] challenge me on that this is the gospel
[3:18:26] the gospel is nothing but only that's
[3:18:29] what the Bible teaches
[3:18:30] so if they're not preaching with signs
[3:18:31] and wonders in the power of God it's not
[3:18:33] the gospel yet so don't fight me because
[3:18:35] this is what I'm fighting for this is
[3:18:37] what I'm pressing for or chlorine is why
[3:18:39] are you with me
[3:18:41] hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said
[3:18:43] that God will come to us nothing will
[3:18:45] only but to power and demonstration of
[3:18:47] the Holy Ghost
[3:18:48] the preacher wouldn't let her kill it
[3:18:50] but the spirit giveth life he said go
[3:18:53] into all the world and preach the gospel
[3:18:55] to every creature
[3:18:56] then interpret it and back reforms go
[3:18:58] into the world demonstrate the power of
[3:19:02] the Holy Ghost so when he was in India a
[3:19:08] man come up here brain we're gonna look
[3:19:10] another Sun worshiping the Sun he said
[3:19:11] all who would give to Jesus Christ and
[3:19:13] caught the bandhas back this man his
[3:19:15] sight and God give back the man in sight
[3:19:17] and thousands give the heart to the Lord
[3:19:19] that is the gospel gospel of Jesus
[3:19:21] Christ he did not say teach the word he
[3:19:24] said preach the gospel so the customer
[3:19:26] consists yet but I charge more than
[3:19:28] teaching the word together on our show
[3:19:32] [Applause]
[3:19:33] [Music]
[3:19:34] that's why I want to challenge all this
[3:19:36] teacher let's place you I know if
[3:19:38] Angeles mine and it's all that kind of
[3:19:41] talk like a field evangelist is like you
[3:19:42] know maintain teacher position it please
[3:19:45] you for what you put in place for power
[3:19:49] the would have to push so when you begin
[3:19:51] to see some Aquila oh Jesus well punch
[3:19:55] so charged this morning didn't everybody
[3:19:59] knows this he goes back hallelujah my
[3:20:08] god
[3:20:09] I'm trying to finish it off but this
[3:20:12] thing going so good like my Grenada but
[3:20:14] I was it easy nice praise God
[3:20:21] so let's not do the gospel is not
[3:20:23] baloney it's the word made manifest the
[3:20:27] power and demonstration of the Holy
[3:20:30] Spirit bringing the word to pass so the
[3:20:32] cluster consists more than teaching the
[3:20:34] word for Paul confirming that said the
[3:20:37] gospel came to us not in word only but
[3:20:39] power under my vision so even Paul said
[3:20:41] his preached on teacher was not with
[3:20:43] enticing words but with the power of God
[3:20:46] that your faith my anchor not in me or
[3:20:49] my words but in the power of God
[3:20:51] Oh hallelujah the gospel is the power of
[3:20:55] God to meet the would act what it's say
[3:20:58] it will do preach the gospel all over
[3:21:00] preach the gospel to every white people
[3:21:03] wrong people yellow black every creature
[3:21:05] every creature you believe that I seen
[3:21:08] God baffle a bull one day I see them
[3:21:10] cause the Hornets not to sting I see
[3:21:12] there is a possum that be lame dead all
[3:21:14] night every creature I went that fish
[3:21:18] was there is a little fishy I give you
[3:21:20] back your life in the name of Jesus
[3:21:22] Christ
[3:21:23] and that fish turn up and just drag yo
[3:21:29] yo
[3:21:30] we have many creeds but there's one
[3:21:33] gospel or kiss a lot of shout many
[3:21:37] interpretations but there is one gospel
[3:21:40] the gospel came of him would only and if
[3:21:43] anything we have approached that not
[3:21:45] Scripture you are duty-bound to come
[3:21:47] tell us about it it must come from the
[3:21:51] Bible through the Bible it must cope
[3:21:54] with the rest of the scriptures and be
[3:21:55] right and if we are ready to say it's
[3:21:57] wrong then we are racist wrong
[3:21:59] and if I angel of heaven would preach
[3:22:02] anything that's not in the Bible to
[3:22:03] listen to it this is God's Word and
[3:22:06] quartz worse only we know it is true in
[3:22:09] order to preach the gospel neutrons come
[3:22:12] up please your toes I'm gonna finish my
[3:22:17] hallelujah song leader come to the side
[3:22:21] musicians from a please we are ready
[3:22:24] this is a beauty for me in order to
[3:22:27] preach the gospel before you make it
[3:22:30] across the bridge you have got to have
[3:22:32] the power and demonstration of the Holy
[3:22:35] Spirit to prove the gospel the letter
[3:22:38] killeth the spirit make it alive so it's
[3:22:41] not just a ritualistic affair but it is
[3:22:43] absolutely a real living reality of the
[3:22:47] resurrection of Jesus Christ living
[3:22:49] among men and that's the faith that I'm
[3:22:52] trying my best to contend for today that
[3:22:56] is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[3:22:59] today and forever and his power Europe
[3:23:02] is
[3:23:03] see unlimited talk unlimited yes again
[3:23:09] unlimited his power is unlimited if you
[3:23:13] can limit God you can limit Christ but
[3:23:16] if you limit the church to Danis
[3:23:17] possibilities your limits and God but
[3:23:20] all things whatsoever you desire when
[3:23:22] you pray believe you receive it and you
[3:23:25] shall have it and someone asks me it was
[3:23:27] the same man why did I associate myself
[3:23:30] with Pentecostal people
[3:23:31] no there's a reason I know there are
[3:23:33] many things and I think they ought to be
[3:23:35] straight not under some doctrine but my
[3:23:37] own opinion that I think they might I
[3:23:39] think I ought to do bidders I might
[3:23:41] think I ought to be sued too but there
[3:23:43] is one thing I've found in those people
[3:23:45] they have a living feet they have
[3:23:48] absolutely caught a hole or something
[3:23:50] God's got there and give them the new
[3:23:52] built and put Gordon to a person and
[3:23:54] that makes them believe in the
[3:23:56] supernatural so that is why I brother
[3:23:58] Branham was so delighted to as suited
[3:24:01] with a Pentecostal because they believe
[3:24:03] in the supernatural
[3:24:04] I feel the messengers come so natural no
[3:24:07] it's just words and more words and more
[3:24:09] preachers and more ministers and more
[3:24:10] explainers and more teachers and more
[3:24:12] whatever and nobody seemed to be crying
[3:24:15] and sign and groaning travailing Zion to
[3:24:18] bring forth Messiah
[3:24:19] Oh glory to God when Zion travailed Zion
[3:24:22] brought forth and God in his labor pains
[3:24:25] when you were spinning you fort so corn
[3:24:28] on Levi beans and in quite a labor pains
