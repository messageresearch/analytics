[15:27] have all of you out here tonight i want
[15:29] to really appreciate and thank you for
[15:32] coming out to the bible studies
[15:34] on tuesdays and if you haven't and you
[15:36] come out we appreciate that so much
[15:39] last
[15:40] tuesday
[15:42] i believe we shared something concerned
[15:44] in the book of jude
[15:45] and that book just before the book of
[15:47] revelation
[15:49] and this book of jude is i believe a
[15:51] very important book there are some keys
[15:53] there
[15:54] and i want to
[15:56] look again
[15:57] at one of those keys
[16:00] and the title i have tonight as if your
[16:02] brother sins against you
[16:04] i want to look at forgiveness
[16:06] forgiveness if
[16:08] your brother sins against you and i
[16:11] want to anchor that from the point
[16:14] in the book of jude which has
[16:16] contending for defeat
[16:18] and and of some of compassion
[16:21] making a difference making a difference
[16:23] between the arrogant
[16:25] the proud
[16:26] the broad beast
[16:27] and those who are slipping and sliding
[16:30] feeling struggling
[16:31] they want to get close to god they want
[16:33] to break through
[16:35] but they are really struggling make a
[16:37] difference put yourself
[16:39] in your brother's place on the matter
[16:42] and to that end i want to share
[16:45] something to you tonight
[16:47] now we identify
[16:49] that this
[16:50] forgiveness in this book of jude
[16:53] and a son of compassion
[16:55] is just before
[16:57] revelation which is the unveiling the
[17:00] unveiling the capstone book of the bible
[17:02] the book of revelation
[17:04] now the thing of it is
[17:07] forgiveness and healing
[17:09] goes hand in hand
[17:11] and there's a scripture
[17:13] matthew 9 if you want to find it you
[17:15] want to take it down was to said and
[17:17] behold
[17:19] talking about coming to jesus now they
[17:21] brought to him a man sick of the palsy
[17:24] lying on a bed
[17:26] and jesus
[17:27] seeing their face
[17:29] said unto the sick of the palaces son
[17:32] be of good cheer
[17:34] thy sins be forgiven day
[17:36] so jesus
[17:38] didn't address the sick question he
[17:39] addressed the same question thy sins be
[17:43] forgiven thee and behold certain of the
[17:46] scribes celebrating themselves
[17:49] not openly not verbally this man
[17:52] blasphemed
[17:54] and jesus
[17:56] knowing their thoughts said
[17:58] wherefore tinky evil in your hearts
[18:01] for whether is it easier to say
[18:04] thy sense be forgiven thee
[18:06] or to say
[18:07] arise
[18:08] and walk
[18:10] but ye may know
[18:11] but that he may know
[18:13] that the son of man
[18:15] had power on earth to forgive sins
[18:17] then saith he to the sick of the passing
[18:20] arise
[18:22] take up thy bed
[18:24] and go into thy house
[18:26] so this scripture clearly shows the
[18:29] connection
[18:30] between
[18:32] forgiveness
[18:34] and healing
[18:36] or should i say it this way
[18:38] forgiveness
[18:40] and your healing especially you who
[18:43] are looking to be healed
[18:45] or looking to be made whole
[18:48] there's another scripture
[18:49] in the book of acts acts 28
[18:52] it says here was 25
[18:55] and when they agreed not many themselves
[18:57] they departed after that paul had spoken
[18:58] one word
[19:00] well speak the holy ghost by his ass the
[19:03] prophet under our father singing verse
[19:05] 26
[19:06] go on to this people and say
[19:08] hearing ye shall hear
[19:10] i shall not understand
[19:12] seeing
[19:14] he shall see and not perceive
[19:17] for the heart of this people
[19:19] is wax gross
[19:21] and their ears
[19:23] a dull of hearing
[19:24] and the eyes have the closed list they
[19:27] should see with their eyes
[19:29] one two
[19:31] here with their ears
[19:34] tree and understand
[19:36] with their heart
[19:38] and should be converted
[19:41] that i should heal them
[19:43] so you could see is a thread there
[19:46] of this heart experience with god
[19:49] forgiveness
[19:51] and healing
[19:52] so all of this what we are doing tonight
[19:55] and sharing is to help to bring
[19:58] our lives in order in the order of the
[20:00] scripture
[20:02] or the order of the spirit
[20:05] sees so because the church has to be
[20:07] set in order
[20:09] now
[20:10] there's a prophecy
[20:12] concerning when the church finds his
[20:14] broadly love
[20:15] there's a prophecy
[20:17] of the honey coming among the believers
[20:20] and the honey looks like it won't stick
[20:21] but it will stick
[20:23] but there's got to be some mechanics
[20:27] behind the full
[20:28] experience of this honey that is
[20:31] prophesied
[20:32] and maybe just maybe perhaps the lord
[20:34] will help us tonight to identify
[20:37] some of the mechanics and the mechanics
[20:38] is what you can do
[20:40] there are certain things that are above
[20:41] your prerogative you can't uh uh uh uh
[20:45] you know i see when charities to come
[20:47] you could prepare your heart god is the
[20:49] one that's in rain you could prepare the
[20:51] seed you could plant the seed but the
[20:53] rain and the sun
[20:55] god is in charge of that so what we are
[20:58] responsible for we want to take up that
[21:00] responsibility and be dear ready having
[21:03] all the mechanics ready
[21:05] amen
[21:06] so
[21:07] jesus gave a parable about the lost coin
[21:10] and
[21:11] you know obviously the woman searched
[21:13] diligently to find that coin and that
[21:16] coin represented for us for our purpose
[21:19] brotherly love
[21:20] we have to have that honey that brother
[21:23] love and i'm not saying that as a text
[21:26] i'm not saying that as a phrase i'm
[21:28] seeing that as a manifestation the honey
[21:32] have to stick there has to be a genuine
[21:36] manifestation of the spirit of
[21:38] forgiveness
[21:40] okay
[21:40] now remember but abraham had his wife
[21:44] was upset with him
[21:46] and kind of answered him in a kind of
[21:48] way where the spirit was not pleased
[21:51] and after that she got this tumor
[21:53] you see and afterwards now
[21:56] um
[21:57] the holy spirit come back now for him to
[21:59] speak and said speak for your wife
[22:01] and he says before the doctor's
[22:04] untouched my
[22:06] doctor statue is my wife the tumor will
[22:08] go down
[22:09] so there was an attitude and a behavior
[22:12] there was a reaction to that because
[22:14] things happen in the realm of the spirit
[22:16] and we our actions and attitude it have
[22:19] consequences seen and unseen known and
[22:21] unknown
[22:22] so there has to be
[22:24] a genuine
[22:25] forgiveness to come among god's people
[22:29] and this revolution of brotherly
[22:30] kindness
[22:31] really shows that we are nothing we are
[22:33] nobody we need god's forgiveness and
[22:36] because we ourselves need god's
[22:38] forgiveness we supposed to be able to
[22:39] share
[22:41] and and give that out to others
[22:44] okay
[22:44] so the revelation and we're going to get
[22:47] into the scriptures just how the main
[22:49] text of what we're going to read and we
[22:51] but i am seeing something really uh
[22:53] powerful
[22:55] in that
[22:56] the devil
[22:58] works first on the inside
[23:01] inside meaning
[23:02] inside the church inside people's heart
[23:04] lies you know and when you have the
[23:06] church
[23:07] and you have people coming to church all
[23:08] here in the world
[23:09] then once they are unconverted hearts
[23:12] once they are unforgiving lies and
[23:15] people with autism grudge the devil have
[23:17] a channel that he could use to gossip to
[23:20] spread rumors to talk
[23:22] and break scriptures because there's an
[23:24] approach that the bible identify
[23:28] how to deal with issues how to deal with
[23:31] if a brother sins against you if someone
[23:34] offends you and if you bring offense how
[23:38] to deal with it sometimes we do things
[23:40] intentionally sometimes we do things
[23:43] unintentionally and the bible talk about
[23:45] and we read at some point in time david
[23:47] asks god for help and pray from for
[23:49] secret faults false that he may not be
[23:51] aware of he asks god to keep him from
[23:53] presumptuous sins thy sins that are
[23:55] deliberate
[23:56] so
[23:57] there are areas in our hearts and our
[23:59] lives that we have to deal with in order
[24:02] to be effective in the body of christ
[24:05] so when
[24:07] the people was making love in the church
[24:09] and brother branham told them stop it
[24:11] please stop it don't do that behave
[24:13] yourself have respect everything else
[24:15] and then the holy spirit drop down and
[24:16] say whatever you see will happen if you
[24:18] stay blind you will be blind if you said
[24:19] death they will die
[24:20] whatever you see
[24:22] it was given into his mouth to see
[24:25] whatever he wants to say to them
[24:27] and he didn't take none of the options
[24:29] that was
[24:30] spoken to him he said i forgive you
[24:33] and
[24:34] god was pleased
[24:36] god was pleased because here is a son
[24:38] you know they have a statement if you
[24:40] want to see what in somebody give them
[24:41] power
[24:42] a lot of people have a loss for power
[24:44] love i love to be in charge i love i
[24:47] lost to being over love i love to rule
[24:50] and um they can't wait to take your
[24:51] place envy jealousy like a residence in
[24:54] their spirit to wish
[24:56] they could take where you what you have
[24:58] and be in your position and so on like
[25:00] that but when you give somebody power
[25:03] then you see what's really in their
[25:05] heart
[25:06] and that is why it is spoken that power
[25:09] without character is satanic
[25:11] and power with character is fit to rule
[25:14] so therefore god's objective over the
[25:17] years has been to try to get character
[25:21] into his people
[25:23] and the character is not a gift
[25:25] so here is sort of cast 22 between a
[25:28] rock and a half please you want
[25:29] character but it's not a gift you can't
[25:31] slip it to you know envelope he can't
[25:33] slip it to you at the side
[25:34] it's
[25:35] the formation of the word image is
[25:38] character formation or character
[25:40] development
[25:41] and the only way note what i'm saying
[25:43] the only way
[25:45] it could come
[25:46] is by the trial of your feet dustin's
[25:49] trials tribulations sufferings
[25:52] pain
[25:53] challenges upsets you name it this is
[25:57] what produces character not blessings
[25:59] not money not houseland car bigger bank
[26:02] account that doesn't produce character
[26:04] is when the tests come and only listen
[26:07] only when the tests come you could see
[26:10] where you stand
[26:12] only when the test count will vindicate
[26:14] or prove or show what you are convinced
[26:18] of
[26:19] that is where your character comes in
[26:21] not your reputation repetition is who
[26:24] people think you are
[26:26] the your correct is is who you are
[26:29] who are you that's your character it
[26:31] speaks your character speaks when nobody
[26:33] else is wrong your character speaks when
[26:35] the church people are wrong with no god
[26:36] bless you the character speaks when he's
[26:38] all alone what you think what you do
[26:41] what you see how you act that speaks of
[26:43] your character and that character is is
[26:46] with your
[26:48] values and and what you have resident
[26:50] within retaining
[26:52] okay now
[26:54] here it is
[26:55] if
[26:57] we could get
[26:59] or the church could come to us please
[27:03] where there's no oats and no grudges and
[27:05] so on
[27:06] then there is no place for the devil to
[27:09] operate within the church
[27:11] there is no room
[27:13] there is harmony
[27:14] there is praying one for another in the
[27:17] truest sense of train one for another
[27:18] because you could hardly pray for
[27:20] somebody and hold something against them
[27:23] so if you have an issue with somebody
[27:26] start by praying for them
[27:29] no if you're not praying for them and
[27:31] you're talking ill of them that's one
[27:33] thing
[27:34] but but i want you to make a switch
[27:36] tonight instead of talking ill about
[27:38] your brother or sister or your pastor or
[27:40] elder or deacon or whoever
[27:42] and you begin to pray
[27:43] and you enter into a compassion you
[27:45] could hardly continue to hold anything
[27:48] against them because i believe
[27:51] that when the devil
[27:54] realized
[27:55] that he cannot move amongst the elect
[27:58] because the prophecy is there'll be no
[28:00] love left except among the elect
[28:04] when the devil recognizes
[28:06] that he cannot move among the elect
[28:10] then he will have no other option to
[28:12] bring external force
[28:15] actually crush
[28:17] and press the bride being left by force
[28:20] so he using a triple power satanic power
[28:23] political power and religious power
[28:26] physical force just as the church and
[28:28] the early believers they perish on the
[28:31] end of rome and the physical force
[28:33] because you see once the devil works on
[28:35] the inside there's no need really to
[28:37] pressure any physical force the force is
[28:39] already dear
[28:41] he has taken over the church jesus finds
[28:43] himself outside the church and that is
[28:46] why he said behold i stand at the door
[28:48] and knock what door is he knocking at
[28:51] where are we pleased and if we are
[28:53] pleased
[28:54] in the position to have brotherly
[28:56] kindness and then on top of that as the
[28:59] holy spirit's thought then it means
[29:01] there's absolutely no way we could
[29:04] really enter into
[29:06] how to say rapturing feat
[29:08] or rapturing condition
[29:10] outside of passion through that door
[29:13] of
[29:14] broadly love
[29:15] which is the spirit of forgiveness
[29:18] okay
[29:19] so i believe
[29:21] that we we this prophecy is is going to
[29:24] be real
[29:25] it's going to be manifested in and
[29:27] through our hearts and lives so tonight
[29:30] if your bible says i get to enter two
[29:32] portions of scripture we're going to
[29:32] start with or we're going to take it one
[29:34] by one mark 11 from this scripture verse
[29:37] 22 to 26 we want to read our scripture
[29:40] phrase mark 11 open bibles read the
[29:42] barriers i'm so happy that we can have
[29:45] studies they could
[29:47] scroll your scriptures and read it and
[29:49] may every seed because it's spirit given
[29:52] words
[29:53] inspired by god and every seed strike
[29:56] your soul
[29:57] okay jesus speaker
[29:59] this is jesus after the curse of victory
[30:01] he wanted figs and there was none he
[30:03] kissed the next day they saw the tree
[30:06] dried up from the roots
[30:07] and jesus
[30:08] there was a means master
[30:10] the tree is dried up from the roots
[30:13] and i want you to understand when a
[30:14] cancer is cursed a tumor is cursed
[30:17] sickness is cursed in your body it is
[30:20] dried up from the very roots itself
[30:22] the cancer the tumor is a demon inside
[30:25] the deer
[30:26] extending itself in sickness when the
[30:28] spirit leaves
[30:29] then everything as it dries out let's go
[30:32] mark 11 22 jesus
[30:35] sentenced to them have faith in god
[30:37] for verily i sent to you
[30:39] that
[30:40] whosoever shall see unto this mountain
[30:42] video removed and be thou cast into the
[30:45] sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[30:47] but shall believe that those things
[30:49] which he said shall come to pass
[30:52] he shall have what shall they see
[30:54] so i call this the purple jesus give
[30:57] what sun supposed to manifest peace be
[30:59] still he spoke to the storm
[31:01] so this is the third level then those 24
[31:05] he drops to the second level
[31:07] so you can't go directly to three you
[31:10] have to come to two and you go to one so
[31:12] let's go to two now therefore i say unto
[31:14] you
[31:15] whatever things you desire
[31:18] when you pray
[31:19] believe
[31:20] that you receive them and you shall have
[31:23] them
[31:23] so he is challenging them
[31:25] to believe in advance that they got it
[31:28] and they will get it
[31:29] okay let's go to number one verse 25 but
[31:32] when you stand praying so first you
[31:34] speak if you shall see then you pray but
[31:38] it's not just praying so he's bringing
[31:40] down the fine print of prayer
[31:43] when you stand praying
[31:45] you're not just saying prayers
[31:48] when you stand praying
[31:51] forgive
[31:52] if you have ought against any
[31:55] in other words it's almost as if before
[31:58] you approach god
[32:00] you search your heart
[32:03] to see
[32:04] if you have an issue
[32:07] against anyone
[32:09] and if you find and it pops up yes
[32:12] against sister so and so brother
[32:14] so-and-so my uncle my hand my neighbor
[32:16] whatever whatever drop it he said then
[32:19] if you have ought against any
[32:20] let me see i said you say when you stand
[32:23] praying forgive
[32:24] if you have ought against any and the
[32:27] reason for it is that your father also
[32:30] which is in heaven
[32:32] may forgive you your trespasses
[32:36] jesus drilling down further in verse 26
[32:38] but if you do not forgive
[32:40] neither will your father
[32:42] which is in heaven
[32:44] forgive your trespasses
[32:46] so is it that
[32:47] if you do not forgive you're wasting
[32:50] prayer you're wasting time you're
[32:51] wasting your time every single god time
[32:53] you're just killing time because your
[32:55] prayer is not going anywhere
[32:57] you're not right you're praying like
[32:58] good anyway
[33:00] and that's true
[33:01] because it has to start
[33:03] with god's condition now remember
[33:06] if you serve in the god of your
[33:08] imagination of the god of your own touch
[33:10] then you could say words and say prayers
[33:11] and taking it up unto god these are
[33:13] people who idols
[33:15] just eat this and that and all kind of
[33:17] stuff they just see words and say into
[33:18] whatever god they believe that is there
[33:20] but this god of the bible or god of the
[33:22] word we have to approach it based upon
[33:25] his thinking his thought on the matter
[33:27] let's switch now to matthew chapter 18
[33:30] and this
[33:31] is where i get
[33:32] the whole thought from matthew chapter
[33:34] 18 we're going to read from verse 15 of
[33:37] matthew chapter 18.
[33:42] moreover
[33:45] if thy brother shall trespass against
[33:48] thee
[33:50] this is
[33:50] someone
[33:52] do
[33:53] offend you
[33:55] sin against you
[33:58] go
[33:59] and tell him
[34:01] his fault
[34:03] between thee and him
[34:05] alone
[34:08] let's pause there a minute
[34:11] you didn't say go and tell your mother
[34:13] your father go and tell some of that
[34:14] brother your country don't
[34:16] tell you you're good partner
[34:18] no somebody do you something
[34:22] the first order of scripture
[34:26] is to go
[34:27] to that person alone
[34:29] so let me bring it down
[34:31] so if
[34:33] brother a offend by the beat
[34:36] or treat must be badly
[34:39] but be not supposed to hold
[34:41] a meeting with
[34:43] his comrades or whatever
[34:45] and discuss how
[34:47] this brother move like this because what
[34:49] that does
[34:50] it brings a bad spirit
[34:53] among the people that you're talking
[34:54] that too
[34:56] now
[34:57] you know who might be telling you things
[35:00] and based upon the scripture you know
[35:02] that who talking that way the off
[35:05] the genuinely off
[35:08] of the scriptures
[35:09] because the guidelines are clear
[35:12] if thy brother
[35:13] shall trespass against thee
[35:16] go
[35:17] and tell him his fault
[35:19] between thee and him alone
[35:22] what people do
[35:23] they go and tell others
[35:25] they vex and i get dicks and this is
[35:28] what you do and and
[35:30] and then
[35:32] you don't know
[35:34] the condition of that person's heart
[35:36] that you are telling that to
[35:38] that person may buy or fight
[35:41] and when they buy that fight now is two
[35:43] against one
[35:44] and then that person will tell somebody
[35:46] else then a tree against one then when
[35:48] they come everybody's seen that person
[35:52] koki eye or badai
[35:54] everybody watching that person with an
[35:55] attitude
[35:56] i have seen that
[35:58] i have experienced that and that
[36:01] has to stop
[36:04] so let's look again at the scripture if
[36:06] thy brother shall trespass against thee
[36:09] the fullest thing to do tell him his
[36:11] fault between he and him alone
[36:15] if he hear thee
[36:17] though has gained thy brother
[36:19] end of story
[36:22] if you listen say i'm sorry i i i didn't
[36:26] mean to do that forgive me
[36:28] that's ended right here you don't need
[36:30] no more
[36:31] but if he will not hear thee this is the
[36:34] bible now
[36:35] telling you the approach
[36:37] if he will not hear
[36:39] he's arrogant he has an attitude okay
[36:42] then
[36:43] this is where he somebody has come take
[36:45] with the one
[36:47] or two more
[36:49] that in the mount of two or three
[36:51] witnesses
[36:53] every word
[36:54] may be established
[36:56] so then
[36:57] you get somebody else and you go to that
[36:59] brother and say brother i brought this
[37:01] brother x or what not with me
[37:03] and i want to let you know that this is
[37:06] what happened so on like that
[37:08] all right
[37:09] verse 17
[37:11] and if you shall neglect to hear them
[37:13] which is two or three tell it unto the
[37:16] church
[37:17] and if you neglect to hear the church
[37:19] let him be as unheathen
[37:21] or public
[37:23] and jesus put
[37:25] scriptural authority in these words to
[37:27] the church
[37:29] he said very nice unto you whatsoever
[37:30] you shall be in it shall be born in
[37:33] heaven whatsoever you shall loosen it
[37:36] shall be loosed in heaven again i say
[37:38] unto you that if two of you shall agree
[37:41] on it as touching anything that they
[37:42] shall ask
[37:44] it shall be done
[37:46] of them of my father which is in them
[37:49] for where the two or three that gathered
[37:50] together in my name they am in the midst
[37:52] of that
[37:53] okay
[37:54] so jesus
[37:56] lose this
[37:57] and then verse 21
[37:59] brother peter came to him
[38:02] so jesus is teaching unforgiveness
[38:04] he is teaching and put an order
[38:07] that people wouldn't have bad spirit and
[38:09] bad attitude one was another with issues
[38:12] and faults and things that will happen
[38:15] as we all know it what it does so peter
[38:18] in verse 21
[38:20] then came peter to him and said lord how
[38:22] oft shall my brother sin against me and
[38:24] i forgive it just seven times
[38:27] that was a big number in peace
[38:28] i mean that's explosive
[38:30] i mean people no don't forgive and peter
[38:33] says seven times
[38:35] look at jesus response in verse 23 22
[38:39] jesus answers him i say not unto thee
[38:41] until seven times but till until 70
[38:44] times seven
[38:48] so jesus answered the question of
[38:52] forgiveness
[38:53] how much times
[38:55] peter taught a number
[38:57] and jesus multiplied that number but 70
[39:00] times that number 70 times seven
[39:02] so in other words there's no excuse
[39:05] to have an unforgiving spirit
[39:08] there's no excuse
[39:09] which i keep holding on like i see
[39:11] people seem to be renewing the yearly
[39:13] grudge like they renewing the
[39:15] driver's permit or the passport or
[39:17] something so they were new in the grudge
[39:18] they were doing the oath they continue
[39:20] with their foolishness
[39:22] and i think i've done if i mentioned
[39:24] before when i was in school days
[39:26] there was they accused me of being with
[39:27] somebody girlfriend or something like
[39:29] that really young boys in secondary
[39:31] school
[39:32] and the guy who did that to me
[39:34] i i know him i know his name never
[39:36] forget his name everything else see but
[39:37] that's not true and we stop talking
[39:40] later on in life i met him as an adult
[39:43] and so like that
[39:44] and when i saw him
[39:47] the first thought struck me was you know
[39:49] what he did me in school and whatnot and
[39:51] then i that off and say man that is
[39:53] foolishness and i went and meet him and
[39:55] talk to him i said it's cool boys
[39:56] japanese and whatnot and you know we are
[39:59] done snow and you move on now if i
[40:02] i'm gonna be petty and i'm gonna go back
[40:04] and say you know he do me this and he'll
[40:06] lie and do something you go nowhere with
[40:08] that
[40:09] and especially coming to christ as a
[40:10] christian
[40:11] you want to know
[40:13] that
[40:14] you are practicing you are emulating you
[40:17] are making the effort to be like christ
[40:20] now right after this when jesus saves
[40:23] him jesus break a parable on them
[40:26] and this parable as we say parables are
[40:28] like mysteries
[40:30] jesus was one of the greatest
[40:31] storytellers out
[40:33] so
[40:34] he will tell a story
[40:36] without telling you about you
[40:39] and when you hear the parable you could
[40:41] see yourself in that part
[40:43] so jesus break this power but therefore
[40:46] the is the kingdom of heaven like not
[40:47] the second king
[40:50] which would take account of his servants
[40:53] and when he had begun to reckon one was
[40:56] brought unto him which owed him ten
[40:58] thousand talents
[41:00] but for as much as he had not to pay
[41:03] his lord commanded him to be sold
[41:06] and his wife
[41:08] and children
[41:09] and all that he had
[41:11] and payment to be made
[41:13] the servant therefore fell down and
[41:15] worshipped him saying lord have patience
[41:17] with me i will pay thee all
[41:20] then the lord of that silver was moved
[41:23] with compassion
[41:24] and loosed him one
[41:27] and forgive him
[41:29] the dead
[41:31] but the same servant went out
[41:34] so this man
[41:36] who owned ten thousand talents
[41:38] got forgiven
[41:40] he was and he was released from his
[41:42] death but this same man went out and
[41:45] found one of his fellow servants which
[41:48] owed him a hundred pence
[41:50] and he laid hands on him
[41:52] and took him by the truth saying pay me
[41:55] that dark voice
[41:57] and his fellow servant fell along at his
[41:59] feet and be sought and saved have
[42:01] patience with me
[42:03] i will pay thee all
[42:05] and he would not
[42:07] but went and cast him into prison
[42:09] till he should pay the debt
[42:11] you see all human hearts desperately
[42:14] wicked
[42:15] this man
[42:16] god forgive him
[42:17] release from ten thousand
[42:19] his
[42:20] local next man through it for a hundred
[42:23] pence or whatever
[42:25] verse
[42:26] 31 so when this
[42:28] his fellow even saw what was done
[42:31] they were very sorry and came and told
[42:34] their lord
[42:35] all that was done
[42:36] then his lord
[42:38] after he had called him senator him oh
[42:41] duh wicked servant
[42:43] i forgive thee
[42:45] all that debt
[42:46] because thou desirest me
[42:49] she does not know also have compassion
[42:52] on thy fellow servant
[42:54] even
[42:55] as i have pity on thee
[42:58] and his lord was wrought
[43:00] and delivered him to the tormentors till
[43:02] he peed all that virtue unto him
[43:05] so likewise jesus capping it over
[43:09] so likewise
[43:11] shall your heavenly father
[43:13] do also unto you
[43:15] if
[43:16] and listen
[43:18] and you know but i always talk about
[43:19] driving slow wrong scriptures not just
[43:21] russian the truth
[43:23] listen to these words
[43:24] so likewise shall my heavenly father do
[43:27] also unto you if
[43:30] you
[43:32] from your heart these words are not just
[43:35] placed there by chance
[43:37] he's not talking about your mouth
[43:39] running if ye from your hearts forgive
[43:42] not your everyone
[43:44] forgive not everyone his brother dear
[43:47] trespasses
[43:49] forgive from where
[43:50] the heart
[43:52] so that is where true forgiveness
[43:54] is out
[43:56] when somebody say i forgive i can't
[43:58] forget you know that this problem is
[44:00] there because if god wants to treat us
[44:02] like that god shall forgive all of you i
[44:04] forget you know i forget i know no i
[44:06] know you do this no no
[44:09] that's why the bible describe it he has
[44:11] this
[44:12] sea of forgetfulness
[44:14] and when you see god take things and put
[44:16] it in the sea of forgetfulness the devil
[44:19] fish and lion and fish on the road can't
[44:20] pull up
[44:22] because he put it in a sea god himself
[44:24] doesn't remember we don't have that kind
[44:26] of mind or that kind of a
[44:28] level of intelligence and so on to have
[44:31] that consciousness of forgetfulness from
[44:33] yes you remember somebody done but your
[44:35] heart
[44:36] you understand what god has done for you
[44:38] and as god release you you could release
[44:41] your brother and his sister and so on
[44:42] like
[44:43] amen so you get out tonight i will pick
[44:46] it up tonight let's look at galatians
[44:48] chapter six these are these scriptures
[44:49] now and i pray
[44:51] that god and grave these things into
[44:53] your heart you want to be a scriptural
[44:55] church you want to be a world church
[44:57] want a church that loves the word love
[45:00] god
[45:01] and reject traditions the traditions of
[45:04] the elders and how this one do it and we
[45:06] don't want to care about what this
[45:08] church is doing on that other that you
[45:09] are doing we want the scriptures that
[45:11] we're reading make manifest in and
[45:13] through our hearts in our lives
[45:14] galatians chapter 6 i want to read from
[45:17] verse one
[45:18] this one is a big one
[45:20] and i want to read this also in the
[45:21] amplified
[45:23] so let's read it galatians chapter six
[45:25] define it reading from this one brethren
[45:28] if a man be overtaken in a fault
[45:34] those are
[45:36] precious words
[45:37] somebody could be overtaken
[45:40] ye which are spiritual
[45:43] restore
[45:44] such a one
[45:46] in the spirit of meekness
[45:49] considering thyself least
[45:52] thou also be tempted
[45:54] number one
[45:56] if
[45:56] somebody is overtaken enough
[46:00] the gospel
[46:02] what they do
[46:04] they will call
[46:05] on the phone or text or talk or whatsapp
[46:08] or whatever to tell others about this
[46:10] person overthinking
[46:13] and they're getting excited for the day
[46:15] they they revive this
[46:18] you have to understand that the gospels
[46:20] feed on negative you ever hear any
[46:22] gospel gossiping positives no
[46:25] that is not what they are about that
[46:27] doesn't stimulate the spirit when you
[46:29] hear some canal some kind of confusion
[46:33] they get that like a revolution
[46:36] because they know get something
[46:38] you hear
[46:39] um you hear that
[46:42] you you're here
[46:43] you know what i hear
[46:46] and
[46:47] what you hear
[46:49] but this is what the scriptures tell us
[46:50] to do
[46:52] somebody could be overthinking
[46:54] you didn't expect them to be
[46:55] overthinking
[46:56] you didn't expect them to be in a ditch
[46:59] or to be in sin not to be enough fault
[47:01] but let's say they can overtake
[47:03] what are they supposed to do
[47:06] how
[47:07] are we supposed to treat them
[47:09] beat them up
[47:11] go beyond your pulpit and expose them
[47:14] let the whole church know look at this
[47:15] person in our fault
[47:18] listen to what the scripture says
[47:21] ye which are spiritual
[47:23] restore
[47:25] such a one
[47:26] and hear how this is drilling down it
[47:29] says driving slow not just restoring you
[47:31] know why are you swimming i'll bring it
[47:32] back i went and bring him back
[47:34] no this is not all these people here in
[47:37] spiderman all these superman and all
[47:39] these characters that will keep this is
[47:41] not
[47:43] restore such a one in the spirit of
[47:46] meekness
[47:48] considering thyself
[47:50] least
[47:51] thou
[47:52] also be tempted in the amplified it says
[47:55] brethren if any person is overtaken in
[47:58] misconduct or sin of any sort
[48:02] you who are spiritual
[48:04] who are responsible to
[48:07] uncontrolled by the spirit
[48:10] should set him right
[48:12] and restore
[48:14] and reinstate him
[48:16] without
[48:18] any sense of superiority love that
[48:22] and with all gentleness
[48:25] keeping an attentive eye on yourself at
[48:28] least you should be tempted also
[48:31] so you kind of say boy he sinned he fall
[48:34] if i was he i was going to do that and i
[48:37] know and no no you can't talk that way
[48:40] so this is the amplified here let me
[48:42] read it again if any person is overtaken
[48:44] in a misconduct
[48:46] or sin of any soul
[48:49] you who are spiritual
[48:52] who are responsive to
[48:54] and controlled by the spirit should set
[48:57] him right and restore and reinstate him
[49:01] without
[49:02] any sense of superiority
[49:05] and all with all gentleness keeping an
[49:08] attentive eye
[49:10] on yourself at least you should be
[49:12] tempted also that is just this one
[49:15] now
[49:17] this is where po boy
[49:20] this is self-righteous get challenged
[49:23] because the people who are
[49:24] self-righteous
[49:26] they are righteous
[49:28] in their own eyes in their own self not
[49:32] god's righteousness their own
[49:33] righteousness and they use that as a
[49:36] gauge to judge others they'll use that
[49:39] as a gauge to look down on others and to
[49:42] criticize others and to be little
[49:45] to pull others down
[49:47] that is how they try to gain influence
[49:48] they try to get influence by breaking
[49:51] people's confidence in people and gifts
[49:54] and talents that god have placed
[49:56] first two of that same script of
[49:58] galatians six
[50:00] verse two
[50:01] bae one of the burdens
[50:04] and so forth you see that there being a
[50:07] one another's burdens that there's a
[50:08] whole text by itself that could be a
[50:10] whole
[50:11] continue for if
[50:14] a man thinks himself to be something
[50:17] when he is nothing
[50:19] he deceive it himself
[50:21] but let every man prove his own work
[50:24] then shall you have rejoiced in himself
[50:26] alone and not with another for every man
[50:29] shall be his own burdens let him that is
[50:31] taught in the word communicate with him
[50:34] that teach it in all the things be not
[50:36] deceived
[50:37] god is not mocked for whatsoever man
[50:39] swear dutch i reap
[50:41] for he that swear to his flesh shall the
[50:43] flesh reap corruption
[50:44] he that swears to the spirit shall the
[50:46] spirit reap life everlasting let us not
[50:49] be wary in well doing for in due season
[50:51] we shall reap if we fear not
[50:53] as we have therefore opportunity let us
[50:56] do good unto all men especially unto
[50:59] them who are the household of feet
[51:02] the amplified beer endure carry one
[51:04] another's burdens and trouble some moral
[51:08] faults
[51:09] and in this way fulfill and observe
[51:12] perfectly the law of christ the messiah
[51:14] and complete what is lacking in your
[51:16] obedience to it
[51:17] for if a person thinks himself to be
[51:19] somebody too important to condescend to
[51:22] shoulder another load you see the
[51:23] context here
[51:25] so when you're talking about
[51:27] um
[51:28] if
[51:28] or how is it up here here if a man
[51:31] thinks himself to be
[51:32] something when he is nothing he deceive
[51:34] deceived himself and the amplified and
[51:37] bring it in the context of
[51:40] you feeling so high
[51:41] you feeling so mighty you feeling so
[51:44] self-righteous that you cannot humble
[51:46] yourself to reach down and pick somebody
[51:49] up it says here now watch
[51:52] if any person thinks himself to be
[51:54] somebody
[51:55] too
[51:56] important to condescend to shoulder
[52:00] another's load when he's nobody of
[52:02] superiority except in his own estimation
[52:04] he deceives and deludes and cheats
[52:07] himself
[52:08] but let every man
[52:10] carefully scrutinize and examine and
[52:13] test his own conduct and his own work he
[52:15] can then have the personal satisfaction
[52:17] and joy of doing something commendable
[52:20] in him itself alone without resorting to
[52:23] boastful comparison with his neighbor
[52:26] and jesus gave
[52:27] a story about that publican who didn't
[52:31] even go into temple and the priest in
[52:33] terms of saying lord i'm not like that
[52:35] man only i pay my tights i do this i
[52:37] threw that and that and that republican
[52:39] hung his head and said lord have mercy
[52:40] upon me a sinner and jesus said that
[52:44] republican that sinner man that man went
[52:47] away more righteous than the priest was
[52:48] saying i do this i do that i do the
[52:50] other only acknowledge lord i have mercy
[52:53] upon me a sinner
[52:55] my god
[52:56] every one of you every person
[52:59] have to be a
[53:01] be equal to understanding and calmly
[53:03] receive his own load
[53:05] of oppressive thoughts so when i hear a
[53:07] young man want to blame his parents
[53:09] young woman will blame my parents
[53:11] blaming this one and blaming that one
[53:13] for your condition you're sick
[53:15] something really really wrong with you
[53:18] if you have to blame this one on that
[53:19] one you don't want to take
[53:20] responsibility for yourself you want to
[53:23] be a permanent child a permanent student
[53:26] a permanent
[53:41] then you have the pacifier to put in
[53:42] your motor quiet you don't you want to
[53:44] bowl and rant and carry on because you
[53:47] don't want to accept responsibility for
[53:48] yourself
[53:49] growing up
[53:50] you have to accept responsibility
[53:52] independence is a responsibility and i
[53:56] think we preach another already we talk
[53:57] about it already israel just some of
[53:59] them it's easier to be a slave than to
[54:01] be on your own because with the slave
[54:03] you get the food from the master you get
[54:05] food from the master you get food
[54:07] clothing shelter and so on when they in
[54:09] the land have to build houses that turn
[54:12] the ground you have to work you have to
[54:14] earn your steel little by little take
[54:15] the land some people don't want they
[54:17] don't want to work
[54:18] they want to labor
[54:20] be not deceived or is not mocked let us
[54:22] not lose heart and weary and faint and
[54:25] acting nobly
[54:26] and doing right for in due time and at
[54:28] the appointed season we shall reap if we
[54:30] do not loosen and relax our courage and
[54:33] faint
[54:34] so then on occasion
[54:37] so then as occasion and opportunity
[54:40] opens up to us
[54:41] let us do good morally to all people
[54:45] not just the budget you know what people
[54:47] are like in the family to all people not
[54:50] only being useful and profitable to them
[54:53] but also doing what is also for their
[54:55] spiritual good and advantage be mindful
[54:57] to be a blessing
[54:59] especially to those of the household of
[55:01] faith
[55:03] those who belong to god's family with
[55:04] you the believers
[55:06] are you a blessing to believe in
[55:09] or you are
[55:12] no comment
[55:14] i don't understand why
[55:16] are you a blessing james five
[55:19] return to james 5.
[55:23] james 5 being verse 16 the major
[55:27] scripture
[55:29] confess your faults
[55:31] one to
[55:32] another fault one to another
[55:36] and pray one for another that you may be
[55:39] healed
[55:40] so confession and prayer
[55:42] is also tied to healing
[55:45] the effectual proven prayer of a
[55:47] righteous man
[55:48] are they not much
[55:49] and a righteous man
[55:52] is righteous because of the blood
[55:54] not because he is righteous in himself
[55:56] but that man hasn't a blood atonement
[55:59] that speaks in his being elias was a man
[56:01] subjected like passions as we are
[56:04] and he prayed earnestly that it might
[56:05] not rain and his reign not on earth by
[56:08] the speech of three years and six months
[56:10] he prayed again and heaven gave rain and
[56:12] the earth brought forth a fruit
[56:14] brethren if any of you do
[56:17] from the truth and one convert him
[56:20] let him know that he which converted the
[56:23] sinner from the error of his way shall
[56:25] save a soul from death
[56:27] and shall hide
[56:28] a multitude of sense
[56:31] amplified confess
[56:33] to one another there for your faults
[56:36] your slips
[56:37] your false steps
[56:39] your offenses
[56:41] your sins and pray to one another that
[56:43] you may be healed and restored to a
[56:46] spiritual tone of mind and heart
[56:49] the earnest
[56:50] heartfelt
[56:52] continued prayer of a righteous mind
[56:54] makes tremendous power viewable
[56:57] dynamic in his working
[57:00] and verse 19 amplifies my brethren if
[57:02] anyone among you streams from the truth
[57:04] and falls into error and another person
[57:06] brings them back to god
[57:08] let the latter one be sure that
[57:10] whosoever turns a sinner from evil
[57:12] course will receive that one soul from
[57:14] death and will cover
[57:16] a multitude of sins procure the pardon
[57:20] of the many sins committed by the
[57:22] conflict
[57:24] okay
[57:25] matthew 5
[57:27] you want to look at verse 22 24 45
[57:33] open it one should be too fast
[57:36] if i say unto you
[57:38] this is jesus now he's talking to his
[57:39] disciples
[57:41] he's trying to get them a little higher
[57:43] he's trying to get them to see a little
[57:45] further
[57:47] they are on day with the master they
[57:51] with jesus
[57:52] so oh my they're having a great time he
[57:55] multiplied bread and fish
[57:57] you're hearing the sick everybody see
[57:59] these guys identifying with the messiah
[58:02] jesus talking to them now i say unto you
[58:04] who is that the believers
[58:06] the disciples
[58:07] his converts is his people under him i
[58:10] said to you that accept your
[58:12] righteousness shall exceed
[58:14] the righteousness of the scribe and
[58:16] pharisees he shall know you shall have
[58:18] no case entering the kingdom of heaven
[58:21] then he drilling down now you have heard
[58:23] he was said that by them in all time
[58:24] though shall not kill
[58:26] and whosoever shall kill shall be deemed
[58:28] of judgment
[58:30] but i say unto you this is not about
[58:32] over teaching this this is not brother
[58:33] ovid speaking this is jesus saying this
[58:35] but i said to you
[58:37] that whosoever is angry with his brother
[58:41] without a cause
[58:43] shall be in danger of judgment
[58:47] now jesus
[58:48] is wean this anger
[58:52] with the old testament
[58:54] that says thou shalt not kill
[58:57] no
[58:58] you could kill somebody
[59:01] by
[59:02] your words by breaking
[59:06] their influence
[59:08] so let's say
[59:10] um
[59:11] somebody gossip into somebody else in
[59:13] the church
[59:14] and that person lose confidence in the
[59:16] ministry consistent with me and whatnot
[59:19] what i speak then the puppet have no
[59:21] effect at this
[59:23] because they see me
[59:24] they're seeing me with crosstalk they
[59:26] see me negative
[59:28] so regardless of how sincere regardless
[59:30] of what was i share it is not
[59:34] hitting the heart
[59:35] because there's a mind blocked here
[59:37] because of things that people have heard
[59:40] no did we not talking yes
[59:42] we are not talking here this is
[59:44] real i had this my own experience
[59:49] being against a minister
[59:51] because of what i heard about that man
[59:53] and i was a young believer and i didn't
[59:55] even know the man but the
[59:57] preacher presented certain things behind
[59:59] the property certainly about that man
[1:00:02] he was wrong to do that
[1:00:04] because my heart which was like
[1:00:06] a innocent child heart uh newbie a
[1:00:10] newborn a new convert
[1:00:13] i
[1:00:14] received it
[1:00:16] and it had a negative impact upon my
[1:00:18] life when i met that brother i
[1:00:20] recognized that i couldn't you know it
[1:00:22] was was not right
[1:00:24] eventually
[1:00:25] that brother became my pastor and i
[1:00:27] actually repented to him and said
[1:00:29] forgive me i have these thoughts about
[1:00:30] it
[1:00:32] and sometimes i wonder
[1:00:34] people who never say forgive me
[1:00:36] i can't understand that though i can't
[1:00:39] see you as a christian
[1:00:41] and you go to this christian journey
[1:00:43] without saying forgive me
[1:00:45] or i forgive you that's okay let it go
[1:00:47] i'm not against you
[1:00:49] you it has to be part of your experience
[1:00:51] because one wife bites your husband
[1:00:54] father to son
[1:00:55] mother daughter
[1:00:57] you know it has to have that kind of
[1:00:59] experience but i'm sorry
[1:01:02] so jesus
[1:01:03] says
[1:01:05] i see unto you
[1:01:07] whosoever's anger is his brother with
[1:01:09] all the cause shall be in danger of
[1:01:11] judgment and usually say to his brother
[1:01:13] shall be in danger of the church but
[1:01:14] whosoever shall say the fool shall be in
[1:01:17] danger of help
[1:01:18] therefore if thou bring thy gift to the
[1:01:20] altar
[1:01:21] so no
[1:01:22] he is drilling don't know you want to
[1:01:24] bring an offering to the lord you want
[1:01:25] to bring your children you want to bring
[1:01:28] your family you want them to be healed
[1:01:29] you want them to be safe you want to be
[1:01:31] delivered you're bringing stuff to god
[1:01:33] you're bringing your prayer to god no
[1:01:36] now we've seen all of this because we
[1:01:38] want your prayer to be answered we are
[1:01:39] seeing all the over this because we want
[1:01:41] the church to be set in order we say all
[1:01:43] of this because we want your heart to be
[1:01:44] right
[1:01:46] jesus saying this
[1:01:48] if
[1:01:49] thou bring thy gift to the altar and
[1:01:51] dare rememberist
[1:01:53] that thy brother had an ought against
[1:01:55] your brother now
[1:01:57] leave therefore thy gift before the
[1:01:59] altar
[1:02:01] go thy way
[1:02:02] first
[1:02:04] be
[1:02:04] reconciled to thy brother
[1:02:07] and then come
[1:02:09] and offer that gift now if you ignore
[1:02:10] this
[1:02:12] if you ignore this scripture
[1:02:15] do like this does not exist
[1:02:17] and you bring in your gift you've been
[1:02:19] in your offering you bring in your
[1:02:20] prayer
[1:02:21] will god answer that
[1:02:23] how that's supposed to
[1:02:25] so friends we have to come to the spot
[1:02:28] where we want to obey the scriptures
[1:02:30] where the bible is back to the bible
[1:02:33] back to the word
[1:02:34] so then
[1:02:35] in the amplified this one is an
[1:02:37] important one
[1:02:39] how it is placed here
[1:02:41] jesus in verse 22
[1:02:43] but i say unto you that everyone who
[1:02:47] here we go
[1:02:48] continues to be angry with his brother
[1:02:53] or harbors malice
[1:02:56] enmity of heart against him
[1:02:59] shall be liable to and unable to escape
[1:03:04] the punishment
[1:03:05] imposed by the call now
[1:03:08] you know
[1:03:10] sometimes we read something about family
[1:03:12] feuds
[1:03:13] family feuds and this one tell this one
[1:03:15] and this generation tells this one a
[1:03:17] little grandchild come and say
[1:03:19] grandma
[1:03:20] why why we don't talk to that other one
[1:03:22] again
[1:03:23] she's she serious with that
[1:03:26] it's so long a carrying member
[1:03:28] and that's such a shame because things
[1:03:31] are passed on and people don't even know
[1:03:33] why
[1:03:34] now i have got myself in some hot waters
[1:03:38] with ministers with pastors and so on
[1:03:40] because
[1:03:41] um i don't buy people's fight i say very
[1:03:45] plain
[1:03:46] if you have an issue with somebody
[1:03:48] and you are my friend
[1:03:51] don't expect me to have an issue with
[1:03:53] that person
[1:03:55] if you no longer want to be my friend
[1:03:56] that's okay god bless you
[1:03:59] you could keep on walking
[1:04:01] but i am not going to buy your fight
[1:04:04] so you have a fight with this one and i
[1:04:06] fight with that one and we're supposed
[1:04:08] to be friends and i supposed to fight
[1:04:10] fight with them fight you with them no
[1:04:12] no no you straighten out your fight you
[1:04:14] clear up your stories
[1:04:16] so this is where it is
[1:04:18] you cannot
[1:04:20] buy people fight
[1:04:22] if i was you are you this one thunder
[1:04:24] and i give this one dish and i do this
[1:04:26] and like this and you're putting seeds
[1:04:28] in people's minds and hearts and spirits
[1:04:31] messing up families messing up i know
[1:04:35] sister who
[1:04:36] marriage never worked never started
[1:04:39] and every time she have to tell somebody
[1:04:41] about marriage leave your husband leave
[1:04:42] your wife leave leave leave leave it's
[1:04:44] almost as if because her own work she
[1:04:46] doesn't want anybody else
[1:04:48] it is so
[1:04:49] unfortunate when the bible teachers let
[1:04:53] the older women teach the younger women
[1:04:55] how
[1:04:56] to love their husbands how to manage
[1:04:59] their homes well
[1:05:01] isn't that something so let's leave a
[1:05:04] gift for the altar
[1:05:05] so
[1:05:06] let's go to matthew chapter six
[1:05:10] and um
[1:05:12] be coming down
[1:05:13] see what time it is okay we're doing
[1:05:15] that matthew chapter six when i read
[1:05:17] from verse
[1:05:18] one
[1:05:20] jesus
[1:05:21] speaking
[1:05:23] and
[1:05:24] you know this
[1:05:26] what we call islam unto the mount
[1:05:29] is christianity in action
[1:05:32] it's not lectures it's not just talk is
[1:05:36] is bringing to life
[1:05:38] our behavior or attitude because
[1:05:41] this new way this new way
[1:05:44] is supposed to be reflected in us
[1:05:47] this is how we bring witness that christ
[1:05:49] was raised from the dead
[1:05:51] this is how we bring witness that this
[1:05:53] is a new way it's not the same we
[1:05:56] so jesus said take heed
[1:05:58] that you do not your arms before men to
[1:06:00] be seen up there otherwise
[1:06:02] you have no reward of your father which
[1:06:04] isn't it
[1:06:05] therefore
[1:06:06] when thou doest dying arms
[1:06:09] do not summon trumpet before thee as the
[1:06:12] hypocrites do in the synagogues and in
[1:06:14] the streets that they may have glory of
[1:06:16] men relation to you they have their
[1:06:18] reward
[1:06:20] but one when don't do his ass
[1:06:23] let not thy left hand know what i right
[1:06:25] hand to it
[1:06:26] that thy arms may be in secret
[1:06:29] and thy father would see it in secret
[1:06:31] himself
[1:06:32] shall reward thee openly
[1:06:35] when oppressed
[1:06:36] those shall not be as the hypocrites are
[1:06:39] for they love to pray standing in the
[1:06:41] synagogues in the corner of the street
[1:06:43] that they may be seen of men their likes
[1:06:45] unto you they have their reward but down
[1:06:48] window prayers
[1:06:50] enter into thy closet and when do i shut
[1:06:53] thy door pray to thy father which is in
[1:06:56] secret and thy father which season
[1:06:58] secret shall reward thee openly and when
[1:07:00] you pray use not vain repetitions as the
[1:07:03] hidden do for they think that them shall
[1:07:06] be heard by their much speaking
[1:07:09] be not therefore
[1:07:11] like unto them
[1:07:12] for your father
[1:07:14] knowing what things you have need of
[1:07:17] before you ask it
[1:07:19] jesus is drilling down
[1:07:20] after this manner
[1:07:23] therefore pray
[1:07:25] and he begins
[1:07:27] he's teaching them
[1:07:28] how to pray
[1:07:30] our father
[1:07:32] which asked in him
[1:07:34] hallowed be thy need
[1:07:36] yeah didn't they find where their father
[1:07:38] is
[1:07:40] you showing your respects
[1:07:42] thy kingdom come
[1:07:44] thy will be done and
[1:07:46] answers in heaven
[1:07:47] there is no request there yet
[1:07:49] that is identifying his kingdom
[1:07:52] and identifying his will to be done
[1:07:55] then it says give us this day
[1:07:58] our daily prayer this is jesus prayer
[1:08:00] teaching them
[1:08:02] and
[1:08:03] forgive us our debts
[1:08:05] condition
[1:08:07] as we
[1:08:08] forgive our debtors
[1:08:10] he didn't say and forgive us our debts
[1:08:12] period
[1:08:13] the bible have it and forgive us our
[1:08:16] debt is a comma dear
[1:08:18] as we forgive our debtors you have to
[1:08:20] get the whole line
[1:08:22] and lead us not
[1:08:24] into temptation
[1:08:26] but deliver us from evil
[1:08:29] for dying is the kingdom and the power
[1:08:31] and the glory for every email
[1:08:33] then he put in this clause he's got to
[1:08:34] call this way
[1:08:36] for if you forgive men
[1:08:38] their trespasses
[1:08:40] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:08:42] you
[1:08:44] but if you forgive not mend the
[1:08:47] trespasses neither
[1:08:49] will your father
[1:08:51] forgive your trespass
[1:08:53] but we need god forgiveness
[1:08:56] why
[1:08:58] because faith
[1:08:59] for your healing
[1:09:01] is based on forgiveness
[1:09:04] for your breakthrough is based upon
[1:09:06] forgiveness faith
[1:09:08] all things of god is of faith
[1:09:10] we need faith that's why gauchos are
[1:09:12] missing in the last days to turn our
[1:09:13] hearts
[1:09:14] back to the fate of the fathers we need
[1:09:15] fear to leave here
[1:09:17] putin is making his move
[1:09:19] in ukraine
[1:09:21] he's anointed
[1:09:22] he's inspired
[1:09:24] he has the power he has the capacity to
[1:09:26] do whatever he wants to do at this point
[1:09:28] in time
[1:09:29] the world is just looking on
[1:09:32] the bride has to be anointed
[1:09:34] inspired
[1:09:37] prophet said
[1:09:38] when the church the bride
[1:09:40] get to know who she is
[1:09:42] and she can do
[1:09:44] the greater works
[1:09:46] if we have to get to the greater works
[1:09:47] we have to do the lesser works first
[1:09:50] lesser works
[1:09:51] let's call that brotherly kindness for
[1:09:53] now
[1:09:54] if you're going to forgive your brother
[1:09:56] so jesus in the abbey fight said take
[1:09:58] care
[1:09:59] not to do your good deeds publicly or
[1:10:01] before men in order to be seen by them
[1:10:04] otherwise you'll have no reward so this
[1:10:07] here
[1:10:07] brings us to
[1:10:09] applied christianity
[1:10:11] where you don't want to parade your beef
[1:10:14] it's called beef your flesh yourself
[1:10:16] you know you want credit you want people
[1:10:18] to upload you you want you want this you
[1:10:20] want that and if you don't get that if
[1:10:22] you're a whole and you feel like
[1:10:24] pressure and then people are grateful
[1:10:26] no he's seeing here
[1:10:29] you don't
[1:10:31] when you
[1:10:32] do your good deeds publicly or before
[1:10:34] men in order to be seen by them
[1:10:36] otherwise you have no reward reserved
[1:10:38] for waiting for you
[1:10:40] when you give to the poor
[1:10:42] do not blow a trumpet before you as
[1:10:44] hypocrites in the synagogues and streets
[1:10:45] like to do for they may be recognized
[1:10:47] and honored and praised by men
[1:10:50] so when people do this and recognize
[1:10:52] them praised by men that boosts their
[1:10:55] reputation
[1:10:56] but it doesn't identify the character
[1:10:59] jesus by saying don't look for men's
[1:11:02] recognition
[1:11:03] don't look for that reputation part
[1:11:06] get the character path that you could
[1:11:08] help
[1:11:09] support
[1:11:10] do
[1:11:11] bless encourage live up without anybody
[1:11:15] knowing
[1:11:16] you are doing it from your heart
[1:11:19] you're not doing this as an investment
[1:11:20] i'm doing this and i'm doing for them
[1:11:22] and i'm looking to see what they could
[1:11:23] do back for me this is not that
[1:11:25] this is not that i scratching your back
[1:11:29] because i'll expect you to scratch back
[1:11:30] mines no this is not i scratch your back
[1:11:32] you scratch it no this is not that
[1:11:33] either
[1:11:34] you scratch the back because you need
[1:11:36] scratches
[1:11:37] he says now when you do charity or gift
[1:11:40] to charity do not let your left hand
[1:11:42] know what your right hand is doing so
[1:11:44] that your deeds of charity may be in
[1:11:46] secret and your father who sees in
[1:11:48] secret
[1:11:49] shall reward you openly and never stop
[1:11:51] the idea
[1:11:53] when jesus prayed forgive us our debts
[1:11:55] as we forgive
[1:11:58] forgive us our debts as we also have
[1:12:00] forgiven
[1:12:02] left
[1:12:02] remitted and let go of the debts and
[1:12:06] have given up resentment
[1:12:08] against our debtors
[1:12:10] that is the amplified
[1:12:12] forgive us of our debts as we also have
[1:12:14] forgiven
[1:12:15] left remitted let go of the debts and
[1:12:19] have given up resentment against our
[1:12:20] debtors and leaders not in temptation
[1:12:23] there's some old evil and something like
[1:12:24] that but faith
[1:12:26] is based upon forgiveness we read the
[1:12:28] scripture in mark 11 we read the
[1:12:31] scripture do you say have faith in god
[1:12:33] for if you shall say to this mountain
[1:12:35] then he said when you pray this when you
[1:12:37] pray believe that you you receive what
[1:12:40] what desire when you pray believe you
[1:12:41] have received it you shall have them but
[1:12:43] when you stand praying
[1:12:45] forgive
[1:12:46] when you stand praying before your utter
[1:12:48] words and waste your prayer forgive you
[1:12:50] have to act now you have to begin to act
[1:12:53] upon what you're hearing
[1:12:54] you see you cannot say no you don't know
[1:12:57] because we brought it to you tonight
[1:12:59] this is the scriptures all right
[1:13:01] psalms
[1:13:03] this is david
[1:13:05] and this one here is
[1:13:08] is is a special one this is psalms 19
[1:13:12] here david
[1:13:14] the heavens declare the glory of god
[1:13:17] the filament showed his handiwork
[1:13:20] day on today utterance speech
[1:13:23] night unto night shred knowledge
[1:13:26] there is no speech nor language where
[1:13:28] their voice is not heard
[1:13:30] their line is going up through all the
[1:13:33] earth and their words to the end of the
[1:13:35] world in them that he said a tabernacle
[1:13:37] for the sun
[1:13:39] which is as a bridegroom coming out of
[1:13:40] his chamber and rejoices as a strong man
[1:13:43] running a race
[1:13:44] he goes fort
[1:13:46] is from the end of the heaven and is
[1:13:47] freaking to the ends of it and there is
[1:13:49] nothing hid from the heat thereof
[1:13:52] david now
[1:13:53] the law of the lord is perfect
[1:13:56] converting the soul
[1:13:58] the testimony of the lord is sure making
[1:14:01] wise and simple
[1:14:03] the statutes of the lord are right
[1:14:06] rejoice in the heart
[1:14:08] the commandment of the lord is pure
[1:14:11] enlightening the eyes
[1:14:13] the fear of the lord is clean
[1:14:15] and joined forever
[1:14:17] the judgments of the lord are true
[1:14:19] and righteous all together
[1:14:22] more
[1:14:22] to be desired are they than gold here
[1:14:26] than much fangirl sweeter also than
[1:14:29] honey and honey
[1:14:30] moreover by them
[1:14:32] is thy seven warned
[1:14:34] and in keeping of them there is great
[1:14:36] reward
[1:14:38] who can understand his errors
[1:14:42] cleansed though me from secret faults
[1:14:45] this is david
[1:14:47] asking god to cleanse him from secret
[1:14:49] forms
[1:14:50] and then he said that line
[1:14:53] keep back thy servant also
[1:14:56] from
[1:14:57] presumptuous sins
[1:15:00] let them not have dominion over me
[1:15:02] then shall i be upright
[1:15:05] i shall be innocent from the great
[1:15:07] transgression
[1:15:08] let the words of my mouth
[1:15:11] and the meditation of my heart
[1:15:13] be acceptable in thy sight oh lord my
[1:15:16] strength and my redeemer oh could you
[1:15:18] give the lord some praises tonight
[1:15:20] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:15:22] thank you jesus give the lord some
[1:15:24] praises tonight
[1:15:25] hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord
[1:15:28] jesus
[1:15:29] praise god praise god blessed be the
[1:15:32] name of the lord
[1:15:33] thank you lord
[1:15:35] hallelujah
[1:15:36] thank you lord jesus
[1:15:40] i want to get something here
[1:15:43] i want to take a look at this
[1:15:45] example
[1:15:46] who can discern
[1:15:48] his lapses
[1:15:50] and errors
[1:15:52] clear me from hidden and unconscious
[1:15:54] thoughts is he amplified
[1:15:57] who can discern his lapses
[1:15:59] and errors
[1:16:01] clear me from hidden and unconscious
[1:16:04] faults
[1:16:05] keep back your servant
[1:16:07] also
[1:16:09] from
[1:16:10] presumptuous sins
[1:16:11] let them not have dominion over me then
[1:16:13] i shall be blameless
[1:16:15] and i shall say innocent and clear of
[1:16:17] great transgression as the amplifier
[1:16:20] my
[1:16:21] presumptuous
[1:16:24] what is presumptuous
[1:16:26] overstepping due bonds
[1:16:28] overconfident
[1:16:30] arrogant
[1:16:32] presumptuous
[1:16:33] so they are too tight to sin that david
[1:16:35] identify here
[1:16:37] hidden
[1:16:38] unintentional
[1:16:40] accidental
[1:16:42] secret unseen unknown
[1:16:45] but presumptuous is deliberate
[1:16:48] intentional
[1:16:49] and that's one of my david
[1:16:51] when david comes adultery bathsheba
[1:16:54] that was intentional
[1:16:57] presumptuous
[1:16:58] is a serious thing and david asking god
[1:17:02] to help him
[1:17:03] declare him from the one he is
[1:17:05] unconscious of and that's why every day
[1:17:08] we need to repent
[1:17:09] every day we need to ask god for
[1:17:10] forgiveness every day we supposed to ask
[1:17:12] for christmas see and let the blood
[1:17:14] cover us and something like that
[1:17:16] because this is what you know it will
[1:17:18] affect our lives and even we did it
[1:17:21] sometime again about the study the whole
[1:17:23] husband preaches wife and the bible
[1:17:25] speak about that your prayer may not be
[1:17:28] hindered
[1:17:29] so could you imagine
[1:17:30] your attitude towards your wife
[1:17:34] or towards your husband
[1:17:36] actually affecting your prayer
[1:17:38] your prayer to god
[1:17:40] so no wonder sometimes things not as
[1:17:42] it's supposed to be
[1:17:44] we are not effective are we supposed to
[1:17:46] be because there are too much
[1:17:48] you know issues
[1:17:50] at the home level
[1:17:52] and then it comes into the church
[1:17:54] and that is why the revival have to
[1:17:56] start in your home there are people that
[1:17:58] come and they come and they bring their
[1:18:00] weight and their burden and their
[1:18:01] negative their negative spirit
[1:18:04] negative rights nothing positive about
[1:18:05] them at all without even speaking to
[1:18:07] them their vibes are negative
[1:18:10] and if you are negative
[1:18:12] you have to come out of that because
[1:18:14] with that negative you can't really get
[1:18:16] your prayer answered you can't get your
[1:18:18] healing and that kind of a way
[1:18:20] the guy who had the policy i believe it
[1:18:22] was the friends who taught him on that
[1:18:25] crutch on that stretcher and they walk
[1:18:27] all those miles because those days
[1:18:29] they're not taxi and whatnot
[1:18:31] and they when they came
[1:18:34] they
[1:18:35] the crowd was all around the house
[1:18:37] they couldn't get into the entrance to
[1:18:39] the back don't know where they decided
[1:18:40] to climb up and pull him and break up
[1:18:43] the roof and let him down in front of
[1:18:45] jesus
[1:18:46] jesus said i sent me forgively
[1:18:49] and so therefore the man
[1:18:50] caught forgiveness first
[1:18:52] the man got released from his guilt what
[1:18:55] forgiveness really is release from your
[1:18:57] guilt release from your past that's what
[1:18:59] what what is all about
[1:19:01] and that's why the bible teaches us how
[1:19:03] and of some of compassion note the
[1:19:05] arrogant the peace the attitudes that
[1:19:07] you don't care and nobody can't tell you
[1:19:09] nothing and you you're standing
[1:19:11] everything else
[1:19:12] you're in rebellion mood
[1:19:14] and rebellion is at least in a
[1:19:15] witchcraft
[1:19:17] you in that rebellion move you better
[1:19:18] against god
[1:19:20] and you could talk conviction talk you
[1:19:22] could talk um you know you're seeing it
[1:19:24] and that's what we open up you could
[1:19:25] talk that whole whatever longer talk it
[1:19:26] doesn't change that rebellious spirit
[1:19:28] because not just what you say is it's
[1:19:30] how you say
[1:19:32] see
[1:19:33] so we don't want that presumptuous just
[1:19:35] going forward
[1:19:37] and together so how about the clothes
[1:19:39] believe it or not
[1:19:40] i want to close with a quote
[1:19:43] for a message by faith moses
[1:19:45] this message was the 20th of june july
[1:19:48] 1958
[1:19:49] the branham
[1:19:51] we want a meeting with this tabernacle
[1:19:55] so that everything
[1:19:57] and every mistake
[1:19:59] all things that have been carrying on
[1:20:01] and maybe little feelings from one to
[1:20:03] another those
[1:20:06] i'm going to get every one of them
[1:20:09] and bring them right
[1:20:11] face to face
[1:20:13] if you don't want to face it
[1:20:16] you better leave the country
[1:20:18] because you are coming
[1:20:20] face to face with every bit of it like
[1:20:23] we used to do here at the tamina
[1:20:26] and all to be smoothed out
[1:20:29] because
[1:20:30] we are brothers and sisters
[1:20:32] who are broke communion
[1:20:34] the body of christ across the table of
[1:20:36] blessings
[1:20:37] and is nothing but the devil would make
[1:20:40] anything that would be wrong
[1:20:42] and would cause
[1:20:43] feelings
[1:20:45] or tear up
[1:20:46] or anything like that
[1:20:48] and i am taken
[1:20:50] i am taking our brother neville
[1:20:53] and we are going from place to place
[1:20:56] and bring people
[1:20:58] the people together till the old
[1:21:00] tabernacle is back
[1:21:03] established again on its feet to go
[1:21:05] along for the kingdom of god
[1:21:07] now this is the reason i have said this
[1:21:11] is because it's with our own little
[1:21:13] group here
[1:21:14] this morning
[1:21:16] so we said these things because we
[1:21:17] intend to do something
[1:21:19] about your feelings and issues people
[1:21:21] and family and and people have
[1:21:24] and to be honest
[1:21:26] a lot of stuff can't be resolved
[1:21:29] i know
[1:21:30] sometimes we need to air ourselves i
[1:21:32] need to speak what in our hearts and so
[1:21:34] on
[1:21:35] but the reality is at the end of the day
[1:21:38] each one of us have to come to the place
[1:21:41] to drop things
[1:21:43] drop your oats simply drop it
[1:21:46] let it go
[1:21:47] forgive your brother
[1:21:49] forgive your sister
[1:21:50] and press on in jesus name
[1:21:52] that's the only way
[1:21:54] if you go with a list
[1:21:56] it has sub list
[1:21:58] it has part one i have par 10 in that
[1:22:02] part one and under the part one to ten
[1:22:04] have more paths and
[1:22:05] the paths are gonna finish
[1:22:08] the talk is not gonna finish the bat is
[1:22:10] not going to finish until we could
[1:22:11] understand
[1:22:13] that if we catch a real revelation
[1:22:16] that we are nothing that's what isaiah
[1:22:18] saw i believe when he entered
[1:22:21] the presence of god in isaiah 6 he will
[1:22:23] go with me i'm undone i have a man on
[1:22:25] clean lips i draw among people around
[1:22:27] clean ups he's finished here he's on the
[1:22:29] floor he saw the tree hand lifted up
[1:22:32] the lord fill the temple the glory dear
[1:22:34] who is me
[1:22:36] all the time when was you was you with
[1:22:38] you when the glory hit him
[1:22:40] he balled with me
[1:22:42] because truly the fear of the lord is
[1:22:45] the beginning of wisdom
[1:22:46] do you fear god
[1:22:49] do we have the fear of god our hearts
[1:22:51] and our lives
[1:22:53] we hear prophecy that
[1:22:55] perfection will be so much in the church
[1:22:58] that a nasty sapphire will come back
[1:23:00] again with the lying self and they'll be
[1:23:02] judged
[1:23:03] take no death
[1:23:05] that's a real church
[1:23:07] that's the church jesus is going for a
[1:23:09] genuine another book of accessibility
[1:23:12] heavenly father i thank you for tonight
[1:23:15] and in going through jude
[1:23:18] last week
[1:23:19] and just before revelation just before
[1:23:21] the capstone comes down just before the
[1:23:24] unveiling
[1:23:25] you stick in that book called jude
[1:23:27] where
[1:23:29] the fate was already slipping
[1:23:31] and he said argue for it debate
[1:23:35] lord some people as
[1:23:37] they haven't begun to fight and they
[1:23:39] want to give up
[1:23:40] luther fought
[1:23:42] wesley fought
[1:23:43] through the dark ages they fought
[1:23:45] someone else in sheepskin and cold skin
[1:23:48] in caves and dense destitute afflicted
[1:23:51] sons of god
[1:23:53] some to the water some through the flood
[1:23:55] some good trials and altered the blood
[1:23:57] but ram lost his wife lost his daughter
[1:24:00] mostly anointed so much challenges but
[1:24:03] it didn't change him from being a
[1:24:05] prophet and being that elijah according
[1:24:06] to malachi 4 and here we are
[1:24:09] lord we are facing the challenges as we
[1:24:12] gather together around your word i thank
[1:24:14] you for your people here tonight bless
