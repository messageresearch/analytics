[8:29] thank you brother anthony god bless you
[8:31] friends god bless your church
[8:32] certainly a great privilege to be here
[8:34] once again tonight
[8:36] let's just bow our heads forward of
[8:38] prayer oh gracious heavenly father we
[8:41] thank you tonight
[8:42] lord to come one more time into your
[8:45] presence
[8:46] lord united lord in this
[8:49] lord this realm father where we are
[8:51] connected lord through
[8:52] technology but we more importantly are
[8:55] connected through by the
[8:57] love core the bonds of perfection and
[8:59] your love and your grace and your mercy
[9:01] and your blood and that's brought us
[9:04] together
[9:05] lord to fellowship around your word lord
[9:07] in this bible study father where
[9:09] lord we come to see your mind to see
[9:12] your thoughts your prophet taught us
[9:14] that if we read the bible and don't see
[9:16] jesus christ in every verse
[9:18] in every chapter we need to go read it
[9:20] again so father you found this
[9:22] secret way to take your mind and reveal
[9:25] your thoughts to us through your
[9:27] written word father and you sent
[9:30] prophets through the ages even
[9:32] lord the great mighty prophet of malachi
[9:35] 4
[9:35] 5 and 6 in luke 17 30 and revelation 10
[9:39] father to
[9:40] be able to speak to us father that we
[9:42] could lord be able to
[9:44] see the light in the written word father
[9:47] that we can read from an open book so
[9:48] may you speak from the open book tonight
[9:50] may you open our understanding may you
[9:53] encourage your people may you lift us up
[9:55] father father through this whole time of
[9:57] this
[9:58] pandemic and all the other terminologies
[10:01] that are used to describe it we have
[10:02] found peace and refuge
[10:04] in your word we have found comfort in
[10:06] your word we have found encouragement in
[10:08] your word so father may you
[10:09] speak to us once more tonight lord we
[10:11] thank you for the opportunity
[10:13] may you bless the time this evening in
[10:16] the precious name of jesus christ amen
[10:18] and amen and amen well we are
[10:21] together again just praising the lord
[10:24] and
[10:24] um thanking god for another time where
[10:28] we can have bible study
[10:29] and i always like to preface it by
[10:31] saying that it's not a preaching service
[10:33] um that is for us to kind of go through
[10:35] the scripture and find something to
[10:37] encourage us to push us along the way
[10:40] and i was kind of
[10:42] uh going back and forth you know
[10:45] weighing you know trying to get to catch
[10:47] the mind of the lord for tonight
[10:49] and um i don't know at one point it
[10:53] struck
[10:54] um but i want to before getting that i
[10:56] want to wish
[10:57] uh my brother gideon happy birthday
[10:58] today
[11:00] how many appreciate brother gideon a
[11:02] tremendous blessing
[11:03] as a song leader and as a musician and
[11:06] um you know i don't know at what point
[11:10] it kind of clicked
[11:11] but at some point in time i told my wife
[11:15] i said the lord is putting something on
[11:17] my heart for a study of gideon
[11:19] so i don't know if it's how it's
[11:21] connected to him but
[11:23] um we're gonna do a study of gideon that
[11:26] that would be my text tonight a study of
[11:28] gideon and uh
[11:29] i will be a blessing to you because i
[11:30] know many people have not
[11:32] as as we have done in many sessions slow
[11:35] down
[11:36] and kind of take it um drive slowly to
[11:39] really observe
[11:40] all that god wants us to observe in this
[11:43] passage of scripture
[11:44] so that's where we'll be tonight will be
[11:47] in the book of judges tonight
[11:49] by the grace of god and just so we can
[11:52] kind of
[11:52] get some context some background and um
[11:55] uh the book of judges
[11:57] you know is right after the book of
[11:59] joshua you know and
[12:01] judges is that period after the mighty
[12:04] warrior joshua
[12:06] and before the great mighty king david
[12:09] where for the most part i mean
[12:11] king saul kind of steps in before david
[12:13] but david is the next major stopping
[12:15] point
[12:16] but between joshua and david for about
[12:19] 300 years or so
[12:21] we have a period where there is no king
[12:25] the concept of a king doesn't exist um
[12:28] and isn't there any major prophet
[12:31] operating
[12:32] during that time and it's a it's a
[12:34] period
[12:35] of i guess a new young nation
[12:39] you know coming out of bondage for 400
[12:42] years
[12:43] you know trying to find themselves so to
[12:45] speak you know so
[12:46] over this period of almost 300 years or
[12:49] so
[12:49] we have a almost a cycle
[12:52] of you know victory servitude sorrow
[12:55] salvation
[12:56] uh you know after 40 years of going
[12:59] through the wilderness
[13:01] after egypt you know they they are they
[13:03] are they have entered into the promised
[13:04] land as it were
[13:06] the 12 tribes of israel have sort of
[13:08] settled into certain areas
[13:10] you know physical locations uh that was
[13:13] assigned to them
[13:15] and the book of judges sort of picks up
[13:18] you know
[13:18] after the book of joshua and kind of
[13:21] delves
[13:22] into this this new land new experiences
[13:25] and and certain challenges begin to
[13:28] arise in there
[13:29] because while joshua was alive the
[13:31] people served the lord
[13:32] you know and you'll see that in joshua
[13:34] 24 but after joshua
[13:36] died it seems that there was nobody with
[13:38] strong leadership
[13:41] great spiritual conviction to take his
[13:44] place to sort of hold the people
[13:46] together
[13:46] and as the generations grew and the
[13:49] bible said they
[13:50] they did not know the lord or they knew
[13:51] not the lord and they did not obey his
[13:53] commandments
[13:54] and having recently settled in this land
[13:57] of israel
[13:59] repeatedly we see this that started in
[14:01] joshua they did not
[14:02] completely drive out and that is where
[14:05] the problem
[14:06] that would have accelerated in judges
[14:09] stemmed from the fact that they did not
[14:11] completely do what god tell him to do
[14:13] with his drive out
[14:14] you know you would recall i would have
[14:16] preached a message
[14:18] one time uh for such a time as this with
[14:20] esther
[14:21] and i would have taken a text you should
[14:24] have killed all your malachites
[14:25] to show how amalek and the amalekites
[14:28] would have run all through scripture
[14:30] even unto esther's time and had israel
[14:32] done
[14:33] what they were supposed to do then amon
[14:36] should not have even existed because he
[14:37] should have been wiped out
[14:38] you know so the children of israel
[14:40] almost collectively
[14:42] for failed to utterly drive out because
[14:44] that's the way the language was written
[14:46] you know and when god gives an
[14:47] instruction
[14:48] he expects a hundred percent effort to
[14:50] it he doesn't expect you to do it
[14:52] halfway or partway
[14:53] you know so you say utterly destroy
[14:54] utterly wipe out you know so that would
[14:56] have been
[14:57] the instruction but the children of
[14:59] israel fear to utterly
[15:00] drive out all of the canaanite
[15:02] inhabitants and they
[15:04] call it incomplete victories led to
[15:07] scatterings of enemies and these
[15:10] canaanites
[15:11] tribes in between and betwixt
[15:15] the various tribes and this will lead to
[15:19] invasions skirmishes ambushes crops
[15:22] being stolen
[15:23] and and the blurring and this is where
[15:26] the problem is a blurring of the
[15:28] lines of the teaching they would have
[15:30] gotten from moses
[15:31] that would have been followed through by
[15:33] joshua of a clean line of teaching
[15:35] to a blending in of what they were
[15:37] taught with
[15:38] forced doctrine and pagan worship and
[15:41] idolatry
[15:42] and heathenism and all of this would
[15:44] have slipped in
[15:45] and the bible said by the time you read
[15:47] judges too they forsook the lord god of
[15:49] their fathers
[15:50] which brought them out of the land of
[15:52] egypt and followed other gods plural
[15:55] the gods of the people that were around
[15:57] them and bow themselves
[16:00] unto them and provoke the lord to anger
[16:04] you know and so that is the kind of kind
[16:06] of the backdrop there you know so
[16:08] we're going to begin to build into
[16:09] gideon but before i even get there i
[16:12] want to
[16:12] firstly just bring context that during
[16:15] this time and it's so wonderful when you
[16:17] could see it through how the prophet
[16:18] brought it and then true how scripture
[16:20] is
[16:20] that throughout history every man of god
[16:24] was chosen could have only done up to
[16:26] the point that was
[16:27] revealed to him and as much as someone
[16:30] had a desire to do the best that he
[16:32] could
[16:33] god would have allowed certain things to
[16:36] happen
[16:36] because only christ was to fulfill that
[16:38] perfection all right
[16:40] so as you look through it you see man
[16:42] making his very best effort
[16:44] and we thank god because after the
[16:46] ministry of jesus christ
[16:47] now perfection now is open to us that
[16:50] day without us
[16:51] are not made perfect so we would be the
[16:53] perfection that they would have but
[16:54] we are comforted by the fact that in the
[16:57] book of hebrews
[16:58] all those heroes of faith were justified
[17:01] you know and when you read hebrews 11
[17:03] you know you read about by faith moses
[17:05] and you go down and and what shall i say
[17:06] by verse 32
[17:08] for for for the time would fail me to
[17:10] tell of gideon and of baroque and of
[17:12] samson and
[17:12] and goes on and on and on and on so
[17:15] let's kind of
[17:16] dive uh into it tonight um and see what
[17:19] the lord
[17:20] will do for us this evening so we are in
[17:23] judges we are in judges chapter six
[17:27] and we're going to read from verse one
[17:30] all right so let's go
[17:34] and the children of israel did evil in
[17:36] the sight of the lord
[17:38] and the lord delivered them into the
[17:40] hand of media in seven years
[17:43] so because of the evil in the sight of
[17:46] the lord
[17:47] the lord allowed them to be
[17:51] captured controlled pressured
[17:57] put under pressure by median not for one
[17:59] month not for a year
[18:01] but for seven years and the bible says
[18:05] in verse two and the hand of media and
[18:06] prevailed against israel
[18:09] and because of the media nights the
[18:10] churn of israel
[18:12] made them the dens which are in the
[18:14] mountains and caves and strongholds
[18:17] so the pressure of the medianites was so
[18:20] great
[18:21] that the dens and the caves that were in
[18:24] the mountains was because the children
[18:26] of israel
[18:27] went and hide and and and create these
[18:30] hiding spaces i want us to understand
[18:33] how what pressure could make people do
[18:36] because they were out of order because
[18:38] they were out of the will of god god
[18:40] allowed the media night to take over
[18:42] to take possession to have the upper
[18:45] hand so to speak
[18:47] and in the amplified in verse 2 it says
[18:49] the powerful hand
[18:50] of media prevailed against israel and
[18:53] because of media and the sons of israel
[18:55] made of themselves
[18:57] or hideouts which were in the mountains
[18:59] and caves
[19:00] verse 3 and so it was when israel had
[19:03] sown
[19:03] so israel still trying to operate now i
[19:05] want us to understand the backdrop
[19:07] they are out of order the reason they
[19:09] are in this position
[19:11] is because they have stepped away from
[19:12] what god wanted i wanted to catch this
[19:15] so it's not as if they are in order it's
[19:16] not as if they are any will of god
[19:18] because here it is it is because they
[19:20] did evil in the sight of god
[19:22] so you see people here doing evil inside
[19:25] of god but they're still trying they're
[19:26] still trying to live it's still trying
[19:28] to operate
[19:28] verse 3 and so it was when israel had
[19:30] sown
[19:32] so they planned their crop or whatever
[19:34] that the media knights came up
[19:36] and the medianites just so you get some
[19:39] perspective of
[19:40] emilianize themselves median
[19:43] was one of the sons of abraham so we
[19:45] know abraham's first son was ishmael
[19:47] he would have had isaac as a son through
[19:49] sarah one of abraham's wife
[19:51] named katura had a son named miriam all
[19:54] right
[19:55] so median is is is actually relatives
[19:59] of the israelites all right so he would
[20:01] also be
[20:02] sons of abraham you will also remember
[20:05] that in the time of moses
[20:07] when moses ran out of egypt he ended up
[20:10] in the land of me
[20:11] of median in fact
[20:14] jetro who was his father-in-law was
[20:17] a priest of million so there was a time
[20:20] when
[20:21] moses coming out of egypt you would
[20:24] recall if you recall ten commandments
[20:26] that when he came in to median and
[20:29] that's where he would have seen
[20:30] the wife and the wife would have explain
[20:33] the burden bush and all this stuff was
[20:34] taking place in the context of
[20:37] of that but the bible would say later on
[20:39] that the medianites allowed idolatry
[20:42] idolatry was found within this so so
[20:44] just to get a backdrop of who these
[20:46] media knights are
[20:48] and god would have told moses to punish
[20:51] the media knights
[20:52] that was coming out of of of egypt and
[20:55] all this stuff so there's history there
[20:56] with israel and the media knights but we
[20:59] see in blue street
[21:00] it was when israel had sown that the
[21:02] midianites came
[21:04] but not just the millionaires only and
[21:05] this is what i want to get at
[21:07] media or the media knights were not
[21:10] known for being the real
[21:11] warrior warrior type you got throughout
[21:14] biblical history
[21:16] you hear about the amalekites the
[21:18] philistines
[21:19] jebusites all of these different heights
[21:21] all right
[21:22] out of all the ice if you want to call
[21:24] it the worst height
[21:25] you can find was the amalekites out of
[21:28] amalek
[21:29] and god particularly had issue with
[21:32] amalek and the amalekites
[21:34] because when the children of israel had
[21:36] left egypt
[21:38] they had no army they didn't know how to
[21:40] fight
[21:41] they were coming out of 400 years of
[21:43] slavery they had no
[21:44] military strategy the bible said that in
[21:47] their wounded defeated condition
[21:49] basically
[21:50] the amalekites attacked them and god was
[21:53] so upset
[21:54] that the amalekites were trying to
[21:56] pounce on weakness or the perception of
[21:58] weakness
[21:59] that he he wanted to blot them out more
[22:01] than once in scripture
[22:02] you see the command to block out the
[22:04] amalekites but he pointed with the
[22:06] highlight here is
[22:07] they are under oppression of the
[22:09] medianites but right behind immediate
[22:11] nights
[22:12] the bible says and the amalekites are
[22:14] there and the amalekites and the
[22:16] children of the east
[22:17] the children of the east here will be
[22:19] talking about descendants of ishmael
[22:21] or the ishmaelites all right east of
[22:24] palestine all right
[22:25] even they came up against them so it
[22:28] shows here that
[22:29] although i want us to capture the
[22:30] trajectory here
[22:32] they fell out to the will of god they
[22:34] begin to adopt idolatry they begin to
[22:37] accept hedonism
[22:38] they walk away from god and god put them
[22:40] under the midianites
[22:41] but under the media nights they are not
[22:44] correcting their behavior
[22:45] and along with the millionaires come in
[22:47] words and i want us to understand that
[22:50] when you walk out to the will of god it
[22:52] is not as if they didn't know what to do
[22:54] this is judges this is not too far after
[22:57] joshua this is not too far
[22:59] after moses understand this 400 years of
[23:02] bondage
[23:03] god put them here for seven years seven
[23:05] years is a fraction of the time
[23:07] there would have been enough stories
[23:09] enough history
[23:10] enough of what you went through in egypt
[23:13] for you to
[23:13] just throw away the great deliverer
[23:17] and forget the god who took your true 40
[23:19] years in the wilderness and the god who
[23:21] gave you the land
[23:22] they were too close to enough
[23:24] testimonies about god
[23:26] and miracles to end up in this position
[23:28] and yet still i wanted to stick edges
[23:32] so and so it was when israel had sown
[23:34] that the media knights came
[23:36] up and the amalekites and the churning
[23:37] of the east even they came up against
[23:39] them
[23:40] and verse 4 and they encount against
[23:42] them and destroy the increase of the
[23:44] earth
[23:45] so whenever they plant whenever it reach
[23:48] harvest
[23:48] they come and destroy it till don't come
[23:51] under gaza so in other words everything
[23:53] they do
[23:54] was taken from them and left no
[23:56] sustenance
[23:59] for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass
[24:02] no i want us to get something here when
[24:05] you're planting anybody one time
[24:07] planting and harvest
[24:08] if you plant something you expect to
[24:10] reap now i could understand
[24:12] if you do it one year and you lose it
[24:13] after one year
[24:15] that will make you feel a certain kind
[24:16] of way let's say you do it for another
[24:18] year
[24:18] it'll make you feel a certain kind of
[24:20] way but it was year after year this is
[24:23] going on
[24:24] for verse 5 for they came up with their
[24:26] cattle this is how the enemy came
[24:28] with their cattle and their tents
[24:31] so they just come and they they just
[24:33] arrive through you know become an
[24:34] established presence
[24:36] for they came up with their cattle and
[24:38] their tents and they came as
[24:40] grasshoppers for a multitude
[24:42] for both they and their camels were
[24:44] without number so when they
[24:46] invaded they came and in the amplified
[24:49] it says they were innumerable
[24:50] so the children of israel couldn't even
[24:52] count the sight of the enemy
[24:55] for a multitude for brody and their
[24:57] comments were outnumbered and they
[24:58] entered into the land to destroy it
[25:01] and israel verse 6 was greatly
[25:03] impoverished
[25:04] because of the media knights and the
[25:07] children of israel cried
[25:08] unto the lord
[25:13] seven years and it came to pass
[25:17] so i wanted to catch a little teaching
[25:19] here and it came to pass
[25:20] when the churning vessel cried unto the
[25:22] lord because of the media nights
[25:25] so in other words
[25:29] yeah one they wasn't crying year two
[25:32] they wasn't crying
[25:34] he had three they wasn't crying he had
[25:36] four they wasn't crying
[25:37] because the bible said as soon as they
[25:39] cried unto the lord the lord took action
[25:42] so the question is how much pressure are
[25:44] people willing to
[25:45] trying to solve in their own way before
[25:48] they want to correct their ways
[25:50] i want us to catch this and we're going
[25:51] to go a little deeper we're going to see
[25:53] where the teaching is going to go
[25:55] and it came to pass when the children of
[25:57] israel cried unto the lord because of
[25:59] the media knights that the lord sent a
[26:01] prophet
[26:02] this is not a major prophet it doesn't
[26:03] call his name this is a minor prophet
[26:05] that the lord sent a prophet unto the
[26:07] children of israel
[26:08] which said unto them thus saith the lord
[26:11] god of israel
[26:12] i brought you up from egypt and brought
[26:15] you
[26:15] forth out of the house of bondage so the
[26:18] prophet is reminding them
[26:19] and i deliver you out of the hand of the
[26:21] egyptians
[26:22] and out of the hand of all that
[26:24] oppressed you
[26:25] and drave them out from before you and
[26:28] gave
[26:28] you their land and i said unto you i am
[26:32] the lord your god fear not
[26:34] the gods of the amorites in whose land
[26:36] he dwelt
[26:37] but he have not obeyed my voice
[26:41] so all of their cries was being met with
[26:43] context
[26:45] because all of the crying still didn't
[26:47] come with repentance i want
[26:49] us to catch this all of the crying
[26:52] did not come with repentance so god is
[26:55] responding to the cry
[26:57] but he's telling them i'm not hearing
[26:58] you're repenting you're crying
[27:00] but you're not ready to change the
[27:01] behavior
[27:05] you're crying but you're not ready to
[27:06] change your ways you're crying but
[27:08] you're not saying to me
[27:09] you're willing to put me back where i'm
[27:11] supposed to be and get rid of the
[27:13] idolatry
[27:14] i want this to catch it so he's
[27:17] responding and saying i've done
[27:19] all these things but you have not obeyed
[27:22] my voice
[27:23] nevertheless we come to verse 11
[27:26] which is sort of the context of
[27:29] beginning to build this
[27:30] god begins to say okay let me do
[27:32] something about this
[27:36] let me begin to take some action and
[27:38] they came
[27:39] in verse 11 an angel of the lord and sat
[27:42] under an
[27:43] oak which was an opera that pertained
[27:46] unto joash
[27:48] the abyssalite and his son gideon trash
[27:51] wheat
[27:52] by the wine press to hide it from the
[27:54] media night so i wanted to see a picture
[27:56] here
[27:57] you have gideon he is working
[28:01] he is stressing wheat not on the
[28:04] tressing floor
[28:06] he is stretching wheat wheat is normally
[28:08] trash in the open so that the wind
[28:10] would drive the shaft away gideon
[28:13] is working in hiding
[28:17] he is doing the job of wheat in a wine
[28:20] press
[28:21] because a wine press is normally just
[28:22] normally have wine in the underground
[28:24] kind of environment
[28:26] the wine cellars are kind of underground
[28:27] things so
[28:29] gideon is hiding
[28:33] gideon is scared for his life
[28:36] he is petrified that if the media
[28:38] knights only see what he is doing
[28:40] that they will come and take it from
[28:42] before even finished
[28:45] while gideon is hiding trying to trash
[28:48] his wheat
[28:48] call it on the ground there is an angel
[28:51] of the lord who is sitting
[28:52] under a tree he's just sitting there
[28:56] i guess waiting for the right moment
[28:58] maybe tell gideon
[28:59] stop doing what he's doing to pay
[29:00] attention and the bible said in verse 12
[29:03] when the angel of the lord appeared unto
[29:05] him
[29:05] and said unto him the lord is with thee
[29:07] the mighty man of allah
[29:10] and many times we preach on this and we
[29:12] talk about the mighty man of allah
[29:15] and verse 13 and he then said unto him
[29:17] oh my lord
[29:18] if the lord be with us why then is all
[29:21] this befall in us
[29:23] and he goes on and where he all the
[29:25] miracles which our fathers told us of
[29:28] saying
[29:28] did not the lord bring us up from egypt
[29:31] but now the lord
[29:32] had forsaken us and delivered us into
[29:35] the hand of the medianites
[29:37] but abraham said he loves this because
[29:40] he didn't was a
[29:41] man of scripture he knew the word israel
[29:44] is backslidden
[29:45] but gideon has not forgotten you would
[29:48] israel is in a bacterium condition
[29:50] but he hasn't forgotten what god took
[29:51] him from what god took him through
[29:53] so he's saying if god is ready for us
[29:55] then where are all the miracles where
[29:57] where are all these signs why are we
[29:59] going through this now bear in mind to
[30:00] this point
[30:02] we still haven't heard the word
[30:03] repentance
[30:07] i want us to to know that there's no
[30:09] mental
[30:11] because if i'm saying where all the
[30:13] miracles and i'm not talking about
[30:15] changing my way
[30:16] to what got me in this place in the
[30:17] first place i want us to catch that
[30:21] and and i remember years ago a brother
[30:24] called me and said but where are all
[30:25] these signs and he wanders
[30:27] and is when i was studying this i really
[30:29] get the answer that i wanted to get
[30:32] because people sit down in church and
[30:35] they have their idols and they say where
[30:37] are the miracles or the signs or
[30:39] something to my life
[30:40] and there's no place or no attempt
[30:43] to truly repent and put god where he's
[30:46] supposed to be
[30:47] and we're gonna get into what people
[30:50] normally do and how god began to correct
[30:52] the pieces of it are you with me
[30:53] tonight anybody catching this
[30:56] and the lord looked upon him so the lord
[30:59] in the face and by the banana made it
[31:01] clear he's saying see this lord is
[31:02] capital
[31:03] so he said it's not an angel now this is
[31:05] the lord now
[31:06] speaking to gideon all right
[31:10] the lord looked upon him and said go in
[31:12] this
[31:15] thy might and thou shalt save israel
[31:18] from the hand of the media knights
[31:19] have not i send thee
[31:22] so all the talk that gideon given god
[31:25] push it back on him
[31:26] and say go with your might you
[31:29] you go with your might go in this and
[31:33] thou shalt steal israel from the hand of
[31:35] the media knights have not i send thee
[31:38] and verse 15 and he said unto him o my
[31:40] lord
[31:41] wherewit shall i save israel behold
[31:45] my family is poor in manasseh and i am
[31:48] the least
[31:49] in my father's house so gideon
[31:53] i want to stop paying this picture of
[31:55] this i want to use in quotations at this
[31:57] point quote unquote
[31:58] mighty manavalo i want us to take
[32:01] snapshots
[32:02] of the life of this mighty man of allah
[32:05] first snapshot is him hiding
[32:07] trying to do some wheat in hawaiian
[32:10] press because he doesn't want anybody to
[32:12] see him
[32:13] then the next shot of this mighty man of
[32:16] allah
[32:16] is him identifying his tribe now
[32:19] manasseh when you look at the tribes
[32:21] there are
[32:21] tribes whose names are recognized for
[32:23] different reasons
[32:24] so you hear the tribe of levite the line
[32:26] of the priest the
[32:28] tribe of judah the lion of the child but
[32:29] judah the judah and the kings you hear
[32:31] about
[32:32] god was a warrior tribe so you hear all
[32:34] how much you hear about the time of
[32:36] manasseh you have a tribal benjamin
[32:39] manasseh is not
[32:40] it's not a big tribe but out in the
[32:42] tribe of manasseh he's saying but listen
[32:44] my family is poor and in my family i'm
[32:47] the least
[32:48] in my father's house so at this point i
[32:50] wanted to catch the fact
[32:52] that we have so far to meet this
[32:55] description
[32:56] of mighty man of allah we have a man who
[32:58] is afraid to go outside
[32:59] to show he's working we have a man who
[33:02] is petrified
[33:04] who know enough word to be able to say
[33:07] well we're supposed to be doing better
[33:09] than we doing right
[33:10] now you know and then he further goes to
[33:13] say but the reality of my situation is
[33:15] i'm a nobody
[33:17] my family is nobody the line i'm in the
[33:20] tribe i'm in
[33:20] and me within my family i really got the
[33:23] credentials for this job description
[33:24] that you're given to me
[33:26] all right everybody with me and the lord
[33:29] said unto him
[33:30] surely i will be with thee and thou
[33:33] shalt smite the media knights as one man
[33:37] now this here is a powerful scripture
[33:40] you know what it is for the lord to say
[33:41] i will be with you
[33:44] so the lord is telling you that i will
[33:45] be with you and i
[33:47] and thou shalt smite the media knights
[33:49] as one man
[33:50] in the amplified that is saying and i
[33:53] will be with you and
[33:54] strike down the media knights as if they
[33:56] were only one man
[33:58] in other words he is taking the whole
[34:01] army of the armenian knights
[34:03] and say imagine all of the immediate
[34:06] knights
[34:06] is one man you guys have to strike you
[34:08] know one man and this this this thing is
[34:10] finished
[34:11] so i want to see the perspective so
[34:13] gideon is wrestling with this because
[34:14] god is saying
[34:15] is as if anything just one man this
[34:17] whole great army which we just described
[34:19] earlier as
[34:20] innumerable you can't con them they come
[34:23] and set up their tent they come in and
[34:24] take everything for seven years you have
[34:26] no food
[34:27] and you who nobody will regard as a
[34:30] soldier
[34:31] you're really a farmer you're not you're
[34:33] not in the army
[34:34] anybody with me tonight but you are the
[34:36] one i'm going to use and i'm going to be
[34:38] with you
[34:38] all right let's build verse 17
[34:42] and he said unto him if the if no i have
[34:45] found grace in thy
[34:47] then show me a sign that thou talkers
[34:50] with me
[34:52] so gideon one thing he is he he won the
[34:54] he writer challenge and tester
[34:56] so he said the path not hence in other
[34:58] words don't go anywhere
[35:00] i pray that until i come unto thee and
[35:02] bring forth my present
[35:04] and set it before thee and he said the
[35:07] angel said i will tarry until thou come
[35:09] again
[35:10] so gideon is saying i want to present
[35:12] something to to kind of verify who you
[35:14] are
[35:14] don't go anywhere i'm coming back just
[35:16] know and the angel
[35:18] says to him wherever he had to do go and
[35:22] do it i waited right here
[35:24] any bible said in verse 19 and gideon
[35:27] went in
[35:28] and made ready a kid and 11 cakes
[35:31] of an ifa or flour the flesh he put in a
[35:34] basket
[35:35] and he put the broth in a pot and
[35:37] brought it out
[35:38] under the oak and presented it
[35:41] so he bring this food here and the angel
[35:44] of the lord said unto him
[35:45] take the flesh and the 11 cakes and lay
[35:48] them upon this rock
[35:49] and pour out the broth and he did so
[35:52] verse 21
[35:53] and the angel of the lord put forth the
[35:56] end of the staff
[35:57] that was in his hand and touched the
[35:59] flesh
[36:00] and the eleven cakes and their rose up
[36:03] fire out of the rock
[36:05] and consumed the flesh and the
[36:07] unleavened cakes
[36:08] then the angel of the lord departed out
[36:10] of his sight
[36:12] so that there is already a manifestation
[36:14] right there now friends
[36:16] if you somebody come and talk to you and
[36:18] you positive challenge
[36:19] and you see fire come out and you see a
[36:21] sign like that
[36:23] that for me that's enough for me i am i
[36:25] am completely completely
[36:27] i am sold you don't need to convince me
[36:28] any more than that
[36:30] so at that point gideon's fate or belief
[36:34] like i said belief starting to kill a
[36:35] little bit because the bible says
[36:38] and verse 22 and when gideon perceived
[36:41] that he was an
[36:42] angel of the lord he then said alas o
[36:44] lord god but because i've seen an angel
[36:46] of the lord face to face
[36:48] so gideon is scared petrified no because
[36:51] there's this fear of seeing an angel
[36:54] and the consequences of seeing an angel
[36:57] all right
[36:58] and the lord said unto him peace be unto
[37:00] thee fear not
[37:01] thou shalt not die so that was gideon's
[37:03] fear that because he witnessed
[37:05] and see an angel face of this he was
[37:07] going to die on this spot
[37:09] then we start to build here verse 24.
[37:12] and verse 24 is what many believers
[37:17] begin to do in their journey so let's
[37:19] kind of bring it home here now
[37:21] then gideon built an altar there unto
[37:23] the lord
[37:24] and called it jehovah shalom so he is
[37:27] giving god a name now
[37:29] lord is peace jehovah shalom and unto
[37:32] this day it is yet an offer
[37:33] of the abyssal right so that testimony
[37:36] of jehovah
[37:37] shalom and the altar that gideon built
[37:40] there is still a testimony to this day
[37:41] according to scripture everybody with me
[37:44] can we church say amen so i want us to
[37:48] now catch what is happening here now so
[37:50] gideon built an
[37:51] altar which building an
[37:54] altar and worshiping is two different
[37:56] things i want us to begin to
[37:58] connect some things here because when
[37:59] you have an altar your purpose of
[38:01] alter is free to do worship not so so
[38:04] the bible says here that gideon
[38:06] built an altar but it doesn't say
[38:08] anything about worship
[38:11] further to which the bible says here now
[38:14] verse 25 and it came to pass the
[38:18] same night so the same day
[38:21] that he build the altar unite god have
[38:23] to come back to him
[38:24] and i wanted to see why god is coming
[38:26] back to him
[38:28] and i pray this will help somebody here
[38:29] tonight and it came to pass the same
[38:32] night
[38:32] that the lord said unto him take thy
[38:35] father's young bullock
[38:37] even the second bullock of seven years
[38:39] old and throw down the altar of baal
[38:42] that thy father had and cut down the
[38:45] groove
[38:46] that is by it so i want us to understand
[38:49] something
[38:51] how hard it is for people to give up
[38:52] certain things
[38:54] so here it was we started back from the
[38:56] beginning
[38:57] israel did evil in the sight of the lord
[39:01] it is because of the doing evil and
[39:03] insight of the lord
[39:04] they are under the media knights they go
[39:08] through
[39:08] seven years of trial seven years of
[39:10] pressure
[39:11] it took them a while to cry loud enough
[39:14] for god to send a prophet to answer
[39:16] and say even though you're crying i want
[39:17] you to catch you even though you're
[39:18] crying
[39:19] you still haven't obeyed my voice
[39:22] because if you obey my voice you would
[39:24] follow me and me only
[39:25] if you obey my voice you would have no
[39:27] other god before me if you obey my voice
[39:29] you would serve no graven image
[39:32] god begins to deal with gideon
[39:35] he begins to say gideon mighty man of
[39:38] allah
[39:39] he begins to speak prophetic words over
[39:42] him or you can say it another way he
[39:44] begins to speak of a future gideon that
[39:45] gideon hasn't met yet
[39:48] gideon's revelation of the world is
[39:50] enough to know that something more than
[39:52] what he's going through should be
[39:53] possible
[39:54] because he knows of the old times but
[39:56] gideon doesn't understand
[39:57] how to get to where he needs to be
[39:59] anybody with me tonight
[40:03] god gives him a sign and he does what
[40:07] i guess most people do let me start to
[40:09] do something for the lord
[40:11] what is it just so he builds an altar in
[40:13] so much
[40:14] that he calls jehovah shalom and to this
[40:17] day it's still one of the seven
[40:18] redemptive names of god but in
[40:22] doing so there's an issue that gideon
[40:24] has to resolve
[40:26] it's not his own just personal issue is
[40:29] the fact that
[40:30] he has now been growing in an
[40:32] environment
[40:33] where the idolatry has not been cast
[40:35] down i want us to catch us
[40:38] so god is saying i see your altar you
[40:40] know
[40:41] i see you start to pray i see you start
[40:44] to read the books
[40:45] i see you're trying to make things right
[40:47] but i need to talk to you
[40:49] about the alter you haven't struck down
[40:51] anybody with me tonight
[40:53] all right i kind of i kind of pushed
[40:54] into your home a little bit now right
[40:56] so anybody who would have talked to
[40:59] gideon at that point
[41:00] could get a testimony the lord came to
[41:03] me
[41:04] i had an experience i tried him
[41:07] i brought certain things to him i saw
[41:10] the fire strike it
[41:12] something came over me i said this has
[41:14] to be jehovah shalom
[41:15] this has to be god is my peace and he
[41:17] missing his war here's my peace
[41:19] i'm building an altar for him
[41:23] of his own choosing gideon didn't turn
[41:26] and say i need to get rid of baal
[41:29] it took god coming to him and say
[41:34] in verse 25 and it came to pass the same
[41:37] night
[41:37] that the lord said unto him and i pray
[41:40] tonight the lord is saying unto you
[41:42] because many of us we have built the
[41:45] right altar so to speak
[41:46] in doing things to change our work
[41:48] change our talk and acknowledge god
[41:51] but if you have any hidden idols this is
[41:54] what this message is for tonight
[41:56] the lord say go get your father's young
[41:59] bullock even the second bullock of seven
[42:01] years old
[42:02] and threw down the altar of bail
[42:06] that thy father had had and listen and
[42:09] cut down the grove
[42:10] in the amplified it says cut down the
[42:13] asirah
[42:14] ashira is actually the grove that
[42:17] they're talking about here
[42:18] was another structure built with wood
[42:22] for the goddess ashira which was
[42:24] considered the wife of veil
[42:27] so i want us to understand the children
[42:28] of israel had gotten so backslidden
[42:31] it was not just baal worship was going
[42:33] on
[42:34] it was baal and the goddess of shira
[42:36] which they called the grove
[42:38] so it was two deities so this is why god
[42:41] say get
[42:41] two bullocks all right let's go further
[42:45] the instruction and build an altar unto
[42:48] the lord
[42:49] thy god upon the top of this rock
[42:52] in the order place in the ordered place
[42:55] here
[42:55] in the amplified speaks to
[42:58] in an orderly way meaning in the in the
[43:00] right system and you write order the way
[43:02] this thing is supposed to be done
[43:04] and take the second bullock and offer a
[43:07] burn
[43:08] sacrifice with the wood of the grove
[43:10] which thou shalt cut down in other
[43:12] words you're making an altar to destroy
[43:14] this altar of bill
[43:15] and making another altar to destroy on
[43:18] top of the wood of ashira on top of the
[43:20] wood of the grove
[43:21] on top of all of the traditions in other
[43:24] words before i could use you
[43:26] more before i could further this
[43:28] revelation before you could go into
[43:29] action
[43:30] you can't just make an altar to me alone
[43:32] you have to destroy completely
[43:34] that thing that had you consumed before
[43:36] anybody with me
[43:38] anybody anybody with me tonight so
[43:41] gideon is called he has chosen
[43:43] he's about to walk into one of the
[43:45] greatest ministries that the earth would
[43:47] have ever seen
[43:49] he doesn't know better because he is
[43:50] following what his fathers would have
[43:52] done
[43:53] can the church say amen so god is saying
[43:55] i'm going to use you
[43:56] but in case you don't know i've given
[43:58] you are giving an instruction
[44:00] people wouldn't like it we'll get to it
[44:02] people will have issue with it
[44:04] but i want you to break down this altar
[44:06] of bill in your family
[44:09] this is not the whole of israel he's
[44:11] dealing with right now come on now
[44:13] this is not the tribe of judah and the
[44:15] tribe of isaka
[44:16] and the tribe of dan and the tribe of
[44:19] god and the tribe of
[44:20] levi he is speaking to one man in a
[44:23] small
[44:23] family in the tribe of maniser
[44:29] god will get to the other tribes he will
[44:32] get to the other houses
[44:33] but right now this is one man hallelujah
[44:36] in his house
[44:37] amongst his family and god is starting
[44:39] to carve his way out
[44:41] just like luther god pulled luther out
[44:43] of the catholic church
[44:45] just he just take one man and start to
[44:47] do a work with him you think there's one
[44:49] man named gideon
[44:50] give him a sign use fire he didn't catch
[44:53] a revelation
[44:54] jehovah shalom and god say yes there's
[44:56] more to it i want you to go and destroy
[44:58] bal
[44:58] i want you to go and destroy ashira i
[45:00] want you to build new altars
[45:02] now listen carefully and i want you to
[45:04] understand now the empowerment of this
[45:06] man
[45:07] i want you to see the struggles he's
[45:08] going through as he's coming into his
[45:10] destiny
[45:11] and i want us for each of us to
[45:13] understand his struggles we may have to
[45:15] do
[45:15] in climbing to our destiny he is called
[45:18] a mighty man of valor
[45:20] but every move he's making is one of
[45:22] timidity caution
[45:23] care keep moving tentatively listen
[45:26] dan gideon verse 27 took ten men of his
[45:30] servants
[45:31] and did as the lord had said unto him
[45:34] and so it was listen because he feared
[45:40] you have a mighty man of valor and look
[45:42] at the description because he feared
[45:46] his father's household
[45:49] and the men of the city that he could
[45:52] not do it by day
[45:53] that he did it by night so we seen a
[45:57] pattern of behavior
[45:59] hiding in your wine press threaten fresh
[46:01] and wheat
[46:02] god god tell you do something and gideon
[46:06] there
[46:06] for fear of his father's household and
[46:09] remain
[46:10] he is now procrastinating god waiting
[46:12] for him to go into action
[46:14] but he is being moved back by fear what
[46:16] does it catch something here
[46:19] so he waited he waited all day all day
[46:23] all day and do any night he do it
[46:25] and let's build let's build and when the
[46:28] men of the city arose early in the
[46:30] morning
[46:30] this is the 20 this is 20 years now
[46:33] behold the altar of baal was cast down
[46:36] and the grove called the grove of ashira
[46:39] was cut down
[46:40] that was by it and the second bullock
[46:43] was offered upon the altar that was
[46:44] built
[46:45] and they said to one another
[46:49] who had done this thing so you can see
[46:53] now why gideon is operating fearful
[46:55] because the initial response is who did
[46:58] this thing
[46:59] and when they inquired and asked they
[47:02] said gideon the son of joash
[47:04] had done this thing so i wanted to see
[47:08] the building of this this evolution here
[47:12] then the men of the city said unto joash
[47:14] they went to thank you grandfather
[47:17] bring out thy son that he may die
[47:20] you see your backslidden israel was you
[47:23] see why god has had to operate where he
[47:25] he he operates the whole of israel
[47:29] listen this is not the the ten
[47:31] commandment
[47:32] the one no other gods before me
[47:35] no graven images this is foundational
[47:38] commandments
[47:40] gideon did what should have been done a
[47:42] long time ago and these
[47:43] backslidden israelites of the tribe of
[47:45] monastery the best response they could
[47:48] get
[47:48] to tearing down idols is let us kill him
[47:52] you understand what happens in his
[47:54] spiritual realm
[47:55] when in your house you begin to tear the
[47:57] idols oh come on now let's push let's
[47:59] push
[47:59] you understand how the demons get angry
[48:01] when you begin to begin to set your
[48:03] house in order
[48:04] when they begin to set your family in
[48:06] order when you begin to make you write
[48:08] moves holy demons say let's kill him
[48:10] oh come on now somebody help me tonight
[48:13] hallelujah then the men of the teacher
[48:16] said
[48:17] unto george bring out thy son that he
[48:19] may die because he had cast down the
[48:21] altar of bill
[48:22] and because he had cut down the grove
[48:24] that was by it
[48:25] he had just destroyed battle to be cut
[48:27] on the grove too oh he could do that
[48:30] and joe has said unto all that stood
[48:32] against him
[48:34] will he plead for baal will he save him
[48:38] he that will plead for him let him be
[48:41] put to death
[48:42] while it is yet mourning listen to
[48:44] joao's revelation
[48:45] if he be a god let him plead for himself
[48:49] because one had cast down his altar let
[48:52] me read that
[48:53] in the amplified
[48:57] hallelujah but joe i said to all who
[49:00] stood against him
[49:02] if if bale is a god let him defend
[49:05] himself because someone has torn down
[49:07] his water so he said
[49:09] oh you're riling up trying to kill my
[49:11] son
[49:12] olivia plead in for this god well if
[49:14] he's like oh well him he fell he said he
[49:16] can't defend himself
[49:17] so joe has started to get a little
[49:18] courage he never had a courage before
[49:21] he he he son who hide in all the time
[49:24] who have no reputation
[49:25] go and do the bravest thing you ever do
[49:26] in your life enjoy us like he like he
[49:29] looked courage he lost long time come
[49:31] back
[49:31] he said brethren bred you don't i don't
[49:33] want to do it ollie plead in for this
[49:35] idol i'm a son
[49:36] will any either defend yourself no
[49:39] anybody with me
[49:41] i wanted to see the context on as if
[49:43] we'd be there watching his whole thing
[49:44] play out right
[49:46] therefore on that day come on now on
[49:49] that day he called him
[49:51] so josh
[49:54] gave his son a whole new name
[49:58] therefore on that day he called him
[50:00] jerubal
[50:01] saying let ball plead against him
[50:04] because he had thrown down his altar
[50:06] so if you want to know who jerubal is
[50:08] that is gideon next name
[50:11] so he became gideon jerubal himano
[50:13] tierre dumbell
[50:15] anybody with me tonight seems power
[50:17] names
[50:20] let's go then all the media nights
[50:24] verse 33 and all the amalekites
[50:27] and the churn of the east a whole
[50:29] there's a consortium this is a united
[50:31] move here all the media knights if they
[50:35] say some
[50:35] all the media knights and the amalekites
[50:38] and the churn of the east
[50:40] were gathering together and went over
[50:43] and pitched in the valley of jezreel you
[50:45] remember we talked about the valley of
[50:46] jezreel a couple weeks ago
[50:47] that way hab house was and so this is
[50:50] familiar territory we unfamiliar
[50:52] territory you know
[50:53] the pitch by the valley of jezreel you
[50:56] will remember if you can
[50:58] that jezreel is under the jurisdiction
[51:01] of the tribe of issachar
[51:03] so they are rich they reach manasseh yet
[51:06] they have reached gideon area yet the
[51:08] average has jurisdiction yet
[51:11] but that move closer touch
[51:14] is god and the bible says but the spirit
[51:16] of the lord came upon gideon
[51:19] and he blew a trumpet and ibiza was
[51:22] gathered after him so this man who was
[51:25] afraid
[51:26] who now coming into his own he have a
[51:28] little strength now because his name
[51:29] changed already
[51:30] people no longer call him gideon decide
[51:33] to now mix his name
[51:35] because you'll read it later on then
[51:37] jerubal
[51:38] who is gideon so decide to call him the
[51:41] mixing name no
[51:42] daisy man who break down the idol if
[51:43] only i hear about him hear about him
[51:45] today
[51:45] this is a man and he blew his trumpet
[51:47] you have a farmer
[51:49] because that's what he was a farmer not
[51:51] blew a trumpet and he barbara says
[51:53] and ebiza aviaza is a piece of the tribe
[51:56] of manasseh so it's not the whole tribe
[51:58] yet
[51:59] just his immediate family rally around
[52:01] him
[52:02] and if yes i was gathered after him and
[52:04] he sent messengers
[52:07] listen true all manasseh so you're
[52:08] getting the rest of the tribe
[52:11] so again i want you to see how when we
[52:13] talk about a revival
[52:14] start in your own home come on now it
[52:17] air reached
[52:18] all eternal israel it already holds
[52:20] tribe yet he start with his
[52:21] own house and he say our house gonna do
[52:25] something
[52:25] we hear the enemy gathering on that
[52:28] other side
[52:29] we go and do something about it so he
[52:31] blow his trumpet
[52:32] and his family the family of ebiaza
[52:35] which is his
[52:36] is almost like that was his original
[52:37] surname they gathered together
[52:39] and he sent word through the tribe of
[52:42] manasseh
[52:43] to say let's extend this to our tribe if
[52:46] no other tribe going
[52:47] we're not ready to sit down and take
[52:49] licks no more anybody with me tonight
[52:51] if no other tribe ready to fight i don't
[52:53] care how big the enemy is
[52:55] no anybody with me and he sent
[52:59] messengers visited if i threw out
[53:01] all manasseh who also was guarded after
[53:04] him
[53:04] and now listen look at the outward
[53:07] movement
[53:08] and he send messengers unto asha another
[53:11] tribe now we start to bring the other
[53:13] tribes involved
[53:14] and enter zebulun and enter naftali
[53:17] and they came up to meet him so now we
[53:20] have a situation we have four tribes
[53:22] in action the tribe of manasseh the
[53:25] tribe of
[53:25] usher he tried of zebulun and the tribe
[53:29] of naftali
[53:30] right around a man who a short while ago
[53:33] was hiding in a cave
[53:34] trying to do wheat without the enemy
[53:36] seeing him because he had an experience
[53:39] anybody with me tonight and gideon
[53:42] said unto god now this is how i like to
[53:45] see at the same time the fate is
[53:47] building
[53:47] and the character is forming we see the
[53:50] humanity we see the human aspect we see
[53:53] the original native demand still
[53:55] wrestling with his future destiny
[53:58] and gideon said unto god if thou will
[54:00] save israel by my
[54:01] hand as thou has said he go and put god
[54:05] and next us behold
[54:09] i will put a fleece of wool in the floor
[54:12] so i fleece it like a little piece
[54:13] from a sheep a little piece of wool it's
[54:15] very it it will absorb water
[54:19] be all i will put a fleece of wall in
[54:21] the floor and if the dew be on the
[54:24] fleece only
[54:25] and it'd be dry upon all the earth
[54:27] beside then shall i know
[54:29] that god will save israel by mine hand
[54:32] as dao has said
[54:35] so gideon i wanted to see the changing
[54:38] scenario
[54:40] he was one man in a cave talking to the
[54:42] angel of the lord the lord spoke with
[54:44] him
[54:46] here believe he has sure he need a sign
[54:49] situation already changing upon him he
[54:52] now
[54:52] leading an army of four tribes but he's
[54:55] still battling
[54:56] in security there are people who are
[54:59] around him who believe in him
[55:00] they have confidence in him his name has
[55:03] already been changed and identified as
[55:04] jeroboa the man who could cast down bail
[55:08] and he is there wondering lord should i
[55:10] move forward
[55:11] and if you're ready with me give me a
[55:13] sign
[55:15] and it was so verse 38 for he rose up
[55:18] early on the morrow
[55:20] the next day and trust the fleece
[55:22] together in other words grab it
[55:24] and ring the dew out of the fleece so
[55:26] you pick up the wall
[55:27] it's heavy with water he squeezed it out
[55:30] a bowl full of water
[55:31] the earth was dry the fleece alone had
[55:34] water
[55:35] no many of us in this room would say
[55:37] well that would that should be enough
[55:39] saying what more i need to see
[55:41] and gideon so i wanted to understand now
[55:43] the uncertainty
[55:44] and how far this mighty man of valor was
[55:47] from how
[55:48] his thinking was and his condition was
[55:50] he said
[55:51] and gideon verse 39 said unto god left
[55:54] not that in
[55:54] anger be hot against me but i really
[55:57] want to be sure
[55:58] i am ready to go there because that
[56:01] enemy
[56:02] is a lot all right and i won't speak but
[56:05] this once let me prove i pray thee
[56:07] but this once with the fleece let it now
[56:10] be
[56:10] dry only on the fleece so let's reverse
[56:13] the scenario
[56:14] just in case somebody tricked me just in
[56:17] case it wasn't really real
[56:19] let me get a reverse all right so what i
[56:21] want to see lord
[56:23] he said now be dry only upon the fleece
[56:27] and upon holy ground let there be you in
[56:29] other words wet
[56:30] everything around the fleece and let it
[56:31] freeze stay dry
[56:33] so i want to see if the reverse is also
[56:35] possible and god did so that night
[56:38] for it was dry upon the fleece only and
[56:41] there was dew on all the ground
[56:43] verse seven or chapter seven verse one
[56:46] are you with me
[56:47] tonight then jerubal
[56:50] your city name there you name change
[56:52] scripture is clear so identifying his
[56:55] rank his position
[56:56] understanding the authority with which
[56:57] he's moving forward then jeroboam who is
[56:59] gideon
[57:01] and all the people that were with him
[57:03] his four tribes
[57:05] so four tribes are fighting men 32
[57:08] 000 men three two zero zero zero
[57:12] thirty two thousand men then jeroboam
[57:15] who is gideon
[57:16] and all the people that were with him
[57:19] rose up early
[57:20] and pitched beside the well of herod so
[57:23] that the hosts of the media midianites
[57:25] were on the
[57:26] north side of them by the valley by the
[57:28] hill of morocco in the valley
[57:30] are you with me are you ready naughty
[57:32] drama going on pick up yeah
[57:34] buckle your seat belts let's get ready
[57:37] and the lord said unto gideon and i love
[57:40] this
[57:41] the people that are with thee are too
[57:44] many
[57:44] for me to give the midianites into thy
[57:47] hands
[57:48] lest israel vaughn themselves against me
[57:51] saying my own hands had saved me in the
[57:53] amplifier they say
[57:54] my own power had saved me and the lord
[57:57] struck here with me he said listen
[57:59] plenty times god has to strip people
[58:01] away from us
[58:03] strict people away from you because if
[58:05] you have too much people in your court
[58:07] you can claim you did it oh god somebody
[58:09] helped me tonight
[58:11] many times we're looking for people to
[58:12] support us we want friends to support us
[58:15] we want family to support us we want our
[58:17] soul satan and our network
[58:19] and and the people are leaning on and
[58:21] god is looking at gideon
[58:23] surrounded by 32 000 men and say you
[58:25] have too much people
[58:26] in your circle you have too many people
[58:29] around you
[58:30] in so much that you could take credit
[58:32] for what i'm about to do
[58:33] and i want you to catch a picture i
[58:36] don't want you to take credit
[58:37] i don't want man to take credit i want
[58:39] to get holy credit i want us to catch
[58:41] this tonight
[58:43] so sometimes you wonder wonder why god
[58:46] allow people to walk away from you
[58:48] because i realize the more people you
[58:50] have around you the less peace it have
[58:52] for god
[58:53] can i say that one more time the more
[58:56] people it have around you the less space
[58:58] you have for god the less
[58:59] room it has for god to operate and god
[59:02] is looking for plenty of room
[59:03] because he wanted to i wanted to catch
[59:06] this
[59:07] no matter how bad things get with
[59:09] godzilla you see when god ready to start
[59:11] to
[59:12] do war on behalf of his children god
[59:15] doing war good
[59:17] when are you ready to fight for your
[59:19] battles he's fighting the battles
[59:20] completely
[59:21] he's not fighting a button on a in a
[59:23] half pass that way he's gonna fight it
[59:24] for real all right
[59:26] so he said now therefore this is verse
[59:29] three
[59:30] go to proclaim in the heirs of the
[59:33] people saying
[59:34] whosoever is fearful and afraid let him
[59:38] return
[59:38] and depart early from mount gilead
[59:42] and their return of the people 20 and
[59:45] thousand
[59:45] and they remain ten thousand listen
[59:48] friends when you process that for a
[59:49] minute i seriously
[59:50] imagine brother thompson you they're
[59:52] going to go with a war
[59:54] you have thirty two thousand soldiers
[59:56] you really don't know what they had to
[59:58] know
[1:00:01] you there ready for war but adjacent 32
[1:00:04] 000 men with you
[1:00:06] and you thinking that all these 32 000
[1:00:09] ready to pop off they're ready to fight
[1:00:11] they're ready at the drop of a hat
[1:00:12] they're ready to go to war
[1:00:14] and when you ask them ought to be 32 000
[1:00:17] of all you
[1:00:18] anybody scared and 22
[1:00:22] 000 say are you already scared of them
[1:00:27] that's scary totally don't you want
[1:00:30] people who in your core two not scared
[1:00:33] don't you want to go to war and go into
[1:00:36] a war or enter a battle
[1:00:37] with people who already have your back
[1:00:39] because if you have people who scared
[1:00:41] with you
[1:00:42] the moment and get too much pressure
[1:00:44] they turn around and leave you know
[1:00:47] anybody with me tonight and this is what
[1:00:49] god didn't want here let's build
[1:00:50] right and the lord said unto gideon
[1:00:54] the people are here too many so 22 000
[1:00:57] go on they're scared they want to fight
[1:00:59] their freight battle they've afraid walk
[1:01:02] it's ten thousand you say this is still
[1:01:04] too much you lost into gideon
[1:01:06] uh the people are yet too many bring
[1:01:08] them down
[1:01:09] until the water and i will try them for
[1:01:12] thee there
[1:01:13] now i love this this is the first time
[1:01:15] god do in the interviews because you see
[1:01:17] i'm not trying them for me you know i'm
[1:01:18] trying them for v
[1:01:19] in other words i am helping pick the
[1:01:22] team that go into this war i go and do
[1:01:24] the interview
[1:01:25] i will try them in the ambition test
[1:01:28] them
[1:01:30] for thee there and it shall be that whom
[1:01:32] i say unto thee
[1:01:33] this shall go with thee the same shall
[1:01:35] go with thee
[1:01:36] and of whomsoever i see unto thee this
[1:01:38] shall not go with thee the same shall
[1:01:40] not go
[1:01:40] so god is saying when i finish this test
[1:01:43] whoever tell you go in
[1:01:45] they're going so it's not your call it's
[1:01:47] not your choice you're not picking
[1:01:48] anybody
[1:01:49] who i say go in go in who i say i'm not
[1:01:52] going did not go in
[1:01:54] so he brought down the people verse five
[1:01:56] so he brought down the people unto the
[1:01:58] water
[1:01:59] and the lord said unto gideon everyone
[1:02:01] that lapid of the water with his tongue
[1:02:04] as a dog lapit him shall thou set by
[1:02:07] himself
[1:02:08] likewise everyone that bow it down upon
[1:02:10] his knees
[1:02:11] to drink so those that's how you're
[1:02:12] dividing them
[1:02:14] and the number of them that lapped
[1:02:16] putting their hand to their mouth
[1:02:18] were 300 men but all of the rest of the
[1:02:21] people
[1:02:22] bowed down upon their knees to drink
[1:02:25] water
[1:02:26] now this here is a real serious
[1:02:27] scripture and a lot of people
[1:02:29] theologians have fought on this
[1:02:31] particular verse
[1:02:32] and i will bring some of the arguments
[1:02:34] and then i'll show you how the prophet
[1:02:36] cleared this answer up
[1:02:37] and why we thank god for the prophet now
[1:02:40] if you go down to
[1:02:41] a river to drink water
[1:02:44] no matter what nobody i i have never
[1:02:47] seen a human
[1:02:48] being just bury their head in water to
[1:02:49] drink
[1:02:51] nobody does that so
[1:02:54] he lapping whether you were
[1:02:58] lapping with your hand because he said
[1:03:00] lap with your hand and on your knee
[1:03:02] it is it is almost expected that in both
[1:03:06] scenarios
[1:03:06] people would have to use their hand to
[1:03:08] help drink because men don't have
[1:03:10] tongues like dogs
[1:03:11] so to understand this you have to
[1:03:13] understand how a dog actually drinks
[1:03:14] water
[1:03:15] the tongue of a dog is different from
[1:03:17] the tongue of a human
[1:03:19] the dog would curve his stronger city
[1:03:21] and he can actually lift water out
[1:03:23] himself with your stone you know
[1:03:24] you can do that so the lapping is not
[1:03:27] really a physiological weapon
[1:03:30] it's a principle god was having here and
[1:03:33] where the brahmana was pushing further
[1:03:36] to say that
[1:03:36] god was watching the me in this case
[1:03:40] god was actually doing he was weaving
[1:03:42] out the idolatry in the heart of the
[1:03:44] people
[1:03:45] so those who were kneeling he was
[1:03:48] actually going against the idolatry so
[1:03:50] the first group of people was people who
[1:03:53] were afraid who went
[1:03:55] those who left he was pulling the people
[1:03:58] who had
[1:03:59] i guess ease of idolatry out but at the
[1:04:01] same time
[1:04:02] those that were lapping when you really
[1:04:05] understand
[1:04:06] a concept of lapping in this context it
[1:04:08] also means people who
[1:04:10] i've heard some people present that they
[1:04:12] were super alert
[1:04:13] and it was elite soldiers and they were
[1:04:15] super vigilant
[1:04:17] super vigilance doesn't fit the context
[1:04:19] of this narrative
[1:04:20] because god was fighting in this whole
[1:04:23] teaching
[1:04:24] to show how he can take nothing and make
[1:04:26] it something
[1:04:28] i want this to get just carefully so god
[1:04:30] is telling gideon
[1:04:31] i don't want man to take credit too much
[1:04:34] people with many people
[1:04:35] will say oh they win it if this was a
[1:04:38] team of navy seals
[1:04:39] then he could say well we really are the
[1:04:40] best man i know that why we win
[1:04:42] i want you to catch this so it's not
[1:04:45] that god was trying to float along 300
[1:04:47] elite soldiers
[1:04:48] the 300 men who were lapping like dogs
[1:04:50] when you you ever watch a dog
[1:04:53] a dog lapping literally goes all in in
[1:04:55] her
[1:04:58] so the alertness here is in question
[1:05:01] in the teaching of people being super
[1:05:03] alert these 300 was lapping was people
[1:05:06] who was willing to
[1:05:07] almost get on into it and go and drink
[1:05:09] and they really care what's going on
[1:05:10] around them
[1:05:12] in other words god was saying you see
[1:05:14] the three hundred most unlikely people
[1:05:16] who have no idolatry and they had died
[1:05:18] in chile should i go and choose
[1:05:20] because i want all the glory from this
[1:05:23] anybody with me we're pushing we're
[1:05:26] pushing
[1:05:27] all right and the number for six of them
[1:05:30] that lapped
[1:05:31] putting their hand to their mouth were
[1:05:33] 300 men but all the rest of the people
[1:05:35] bow down upon their knees to drink water
[1:05:39] and the lord told them to give you by
[1:05:40] the 300 men that lacked will i save you
[1:05:43] and deliver the media knights into thine
[1:05:45] hand and let
[1:05:47] all the other people go every man into
[1:05:49] his place
[1:05:50] all right so we building so the people
[1:05:53] took rituals food
[1:05:54] in their hand and their trumpets and he
[1:05:56] sent all the rest of israel
[1:05:58] every man unto his tent and retained
[1:06:01] those
[1:06:01] 300 men and the host of million was
[1:06:04] beneath him in the valley
[1:06:06] let's build first nine
[1:06:10] and it came to pass the same night
[1:06:13] so god is beginning to sort of move in a
[1:06:16] piece here right the same night
[1:06:17] that he loads it unto him arise get thee
[1:06:20] down so he's speaking directly to gideon
[1:06:24] he won't start yet he battles start yet
[1:06:27] gideon
[1:06:28] jerubal arise get thee down
[1:06:31] unto the host for i have delivered it
[1:06:34] into thine hand
[1:06:35] and to show that gideon was still coming
[1:06:38] onto his own
[1:06:39] listen to the next voice when i saw this
[1:06:40] i was like wait boy
[1:06:42] he lost 70 gideon but if thou fear to go
[1:06:45] down
[1:06:48] go down with purer thy servant dumb dude
[1:06:51] in other words if you're scared to go by
[1:06:52] yourself
[1:06:55] hallelujah in in
[1:07:00] in the amplified it says it clearly but
[1:07:02] if you're afraid to go down by yourself
[1:07:05] go with pure your servant don't you
[1:07:07] decamp all right
[1:07:11] and thou shalt hear what they see and
[1:07:13] afterwards shall die hands be
[1:07:15] strengthened to go
[1:07:16] down unto the host now if this was
[1:07:20] a mighty man of allah his scripture
[1:07:23] should say
[1:07:23] and gideon went on by himself
[1:07:29] next words then when he done with pure
[1:07:31] or his servant
[1:07:32] the only reason he went with europe
[1:07:34] because he's frightening
[1:07:36] because god said before he said if
[1:07:37] you're scared carry this man with you
[1:07:40] so you have a little company then he
[1:07:43] went down with pure his servant
[1:07:45] onto the outside of the army that were
[1:07:47] in the house
[1:07:50] and listen and the media knights and the
[1:07:53] amalekites
[1:07:54] and all the children of the east lay
[1:07:57] along in the valley like grasshoppers
[1:08:00] for multitude that their camels were
[1:08:03] without
[1:08:04] number i wanted to get this how much
[1:08:06] people were talking about
[1:08:08] and their cameras were without them as
[1:08:10] the sand by the sea side for multitude
[1:08:13] i wanted to see the picture of this
[1:08:14] later on we'll hear how much it was
[1:08:17] and when gideon was come behold
[1:08:20] there was a man that told a dreamer to
[1:08:22] his fellow so i wanted to see the drama
[1:08:23] here
[1:08:24] gideon sneaked down by the camp with his
[1:08:26] servant they are the edge of the enemy
[1:08:29] camp
[1:08:29] of a multitude they are defense
[1:08:33] nobody's seeing them and they they are
[1:08:35] listening no are talking about the
[1:08:36] transformation of a man now
[1:08:40] and there was a man that told a dream
[1:08:41] unto his fellow
[1:08:44] and said so this is the bible doesn't
[1:08:46] say if it's a media night
[1:08:48] tell a talking another media night or
[1:08:50] the midnight talking to
[1:08:51] anna malachite or a malachi talking to a
[1:08:55] child of the east
[1:08:56] it just says two fellows from the camp
[1:08:58] it have
[1:08:59] millionaires there it have america's
[1:09:01] attachments two of them having this
[1:09:02] conversation
[1:09:04] and one fellow said unto the other and
[1:09:06] told them a dream and said behold
[1:09:07] i dreamed a dream and lo
[1:09:10] a cake of barley bread tumbled into the
[1:09:14] host of medium
[1:09:15] and came under a tent and smote it
[1:09:18] that it fell and overturned it and he
[1:09:21] turned layer along
[1:09:22] so one fell again dream he see a piece
[1:09:26] of bread a cake of barley bread
[1:09:28] tumble down into the house come upon a
[1:09:31] tent
[1:09:32] strike the tent you ten fall down and he
[1:09:35] there
[1:09:35] wondering what it means his partner
[1:09:39] verse 14 and his fellow answered and
[1:09:42] said this is nothing
[1:09:43] else he said the interpretation save the
[1:09:46] sword of gideon
[1:09:48] the son of joash a man of israel
[1:09:52] for enter his hand had god the level
[1:09:54] median
[1:09:55] and all used so here it is god
[1:09:59] brings in the entire spot that he is
[1:10:01] hearing the enemy
[1:10:03] talking among themselves getting a dream
[1:10:06] and interpreting the dream that he wins
[1:10:09] and you remember he said earlier that
[1:10:11] gideon built an altar
[1:10:13] but there was no mention of worship that
[1:10:15] after you build the altar goal of still
[1:10:17] cleaning up so god is taking him through
[1:10:18] a process as well
[1:10:20] listen to verse 13 verse 15. first time
[1:10:23] and it was so when gideon heard the
[1:10:26] telling of the dream
[1:10:28] and the interpretation thereof that he
[1:10:31] worshipped the first time he hear
[1:10:32] wishing
[1:10:33] so in other words he had to go through
[1:10:37] the angel coming fire on his sacrifice
[1:10:40] he had to go through one fleece as a
[1:10:42] sign go to the next place
[1:10:44] as i say go through all of this and tell
[1:10:46] god to lead him
[1:10:47] to hear one man testify to him forgive
[1:10:50] you unto
[1:10:51] worship and
[1:10:54] worship and returned into the horse of
[1:10:56] israel
[1:10:58] and said arise so now his confidence no
[1:11:00] he finally i can get his confirmation
[1:11:02] you waiting on
[1:11:03] i wanted to see this picture of this man
[1:11:05] who rises to mighty man of allah
[1:11:07] he's not there yet he's rising you know
[1:11:09] he gained more confidence right
[1:11:11] a rise where the lord had delivered into
[1:11:13] your hand the whole submedian
[1:11:15] so now he you're ready to share his
[1:11:17] excitement about this though right
[1:11:19] so now it's it's as if a shift takes
[1:11:22] place
[1:11:24] he divided the 300 men into three
[1:11:27] companies 100
[1:11:28] 100 100. so battle formations done right
[1:11:32] and he put a trumpet in every man's hand
[1:11:34] with empty pictures and lambs within the
[1:11:36] pictures
[1:11:37] and he said to them look on me and do
[1:11:39] likewise
[1:11:40] so the way this has been expressed
[1:11:44] is it's not like it's an elite team of
[1:11:48] soldiers who know exactly what they're
[1:11:50] doing
[1:11:50] and and they can operate on their own
[1:11:52] this is he didn't say listen
[1:11:54] just follow my lead so this comes across
[1:11:57] as a team of guys
[1:11:59] who really not ready to train in in this
[1:12:01] thing right
[1:12:02] look on me and do likewise and behold
[1:12:04] when i come to the outside of the camp
[1:12:06] it shall be that
[1:12:07] as i do so shall you do so let's just
[1:12:09] follow me
[1:12:10] when i blow with a trumpet i and all
[1:12:12] that are with me
[1:12:14] then blow you the trumpets also on every
[1:12:17] side of all the camp and say the sword
[1:12:19] of the lord and of gideon
[1:12:22] so gideon and the hundred men that were
[1:12:24] with him so it's it's
[1:12:26] three companies hundred hundred hundred
[1:12:28] so gideon there's a hundred men
[1:12:30] so getting the hundred men away with him
[1:12:32] came onto the outside of the camp
[1:12:34] in the beginning of the middle watch
[1:12:37] all right so the middle watch the
[1:12:40] watches change
[1:12:41] under the romans to four watches but
[1:12:43] here in judges
[1:12:44] there were only three watches between 6
[1:12:47] p.m
[1:12:48] to 6 a.m with three watches 6 p.m to 10
[1:12:52] p.m
[1:12:53] 10 p.m to 2 a.m 2 a.m to 6 a.m
[1:12:56] so the so the first watch was 6 00 p.m
[1:12:59] to 10 p.m
[1:13:01] so the beginning of the middle watch was
[1:13:04] around 10 pm at night so god is so good
[1:13:06] he can get any time he do this thing
[1:13:08] all right and if you're wondering how
[1:13:10] specific it is
[1:13:13] came onto the outside of the camp in the
[1:13:15] beginning of the middle watch
[1:13:17] so it's not just what i saying just
[1:13:19] between 10 and 2 you know but it's here
[1:13:21] around 10 p.m
[1:13:22] that's the exact time this attack took
[1:13:24] place
[1:13:25] and they had but newly set the watch so
[1:13:28] it's like 1001
[1:13:29] 1002 three just after they watch
[1:13:32] just after they saw let's take their
[1:13:34] place and they blew their trumpets
[1:13:36] and braved the pictures that were in
[1:13:38] their hands
[1:13:40] and the three companies of a hundred men
[1:13:43] each
[1:13:43] blew their trumpets and break the
[1:13:45] pictures and held the lambs in their
[1:13:47] left hands
[1:13:48] and the trumpets in their right hands to
[1:13:50] blow with all and they cried the sword
[1:13:52] of the lord and of gideon
[1:13:54] and they stood every man in his place
[1:13:57] round about the camp
[1:13:58] so it is clear here that they have
[1:14:00] nothing to do with it they stood in
[1:14:02] their place they didn't move
[1:14:04] and all the hosts this piece of
[1:14:06] scripture here
[1:14:08] i was studying and i started to laugh
[1:14:10] listen to the description the bible says
[1:14:11] and all he was run
[1:14:13] first thing they did and cried second
[1:14:16] thing to death
[1:14:17] and fled is the first time you see was
[1:14:19] ran and fled in the same
[1:14:21] sentence these 300 men
[1:14:25] surround the camp blowing their horns
[1:14:27] hitting their vessels and
[1:14:29] the baby says all the hosts not some
[1:14:32] all the others ran and when you see the
[1:14:35] picture
[1:14:36] people get up and they're running i
[1:14:38] don't know at what point they start to
[1:14:39] cry and cried
[1:14:41] and then fled run
[1:14:44] cry fled and the 300 blew the trumpets
[1:14:49] and the lord set every man's sword
[1:14:51] against his fellow
[1:14:52] so they the midianites the amalekites
[1:14:55] and the children of the east began to
[1:14:57] cloud
[1:14:58] one another gideon's men have nothing to
[1:15:00] do with it at this point
[1:15:03] said every man's sword against his
[1:15:04] fellow even threw out all the hosts
[1:15:07] and the horse fled to bachelor in zara
[1:15:11] rat and to the border of amel meloha
[1:15:13] onto taba
[1:15:14] now i checked this geographically all
[1:15:16] right if you check this
[1:15:18] they say this is about 10 miles
[1:15:21] so these fellas run in fact they fled
[1:15:23] you know there's a run for 10 minutes a
[1:15:25] 10 mile run
[1:15:27] it takes you between about 45 minutes
[1:15:29] that or if you're physically fit
[1:15:31] to run that denfel has run non-stop
[1:15:35] for about an hour to get away from those
[1:15:37] 300 men there
[1:15:39] you see when god started to do something
[1:15:40] how powerful it is
[1:15:42] anybody with me tonight and listen now
[1:15:45] listen to
[1:15:46] notice since that change with gideon
[1:15:49] when he heard that dream
[1:15:50] and he began to take action that was a
[1:15:53] turning point for him
[1:15:54] from this point on there's no there's no
[1:15:57] questioning the authority he has now
[1:15:59] stepped into his own
[1:16:02] and the men of israel guarded themselves
[1:16:04] together out of naftali
[1:16:06] out of asha and out of manasser and
[1:16:09] pursued
[1:16:10] after the media knights so now we begin
[1:16:12] to build here
[1:16:13] and gideon so gideon now in ripping form
[1:16:17] so they're running and he'd say now
[1:16:20] we're going after them
[1:16:22] now god is so good dubai and gideon sent
[1:16:25] messengers
[1:16:26] throughout all monk ephraim so ephraim
[1:16:29] is his brother tribe
[1:16:30] they didn't know what's going on but he
[1:16:32] said word ephraim
[1:16:34] their land is on a mountain their
[1:16:37] mountain connects to the sea
[1:16:39] so he send messengers throughout all
[1:16:41] mount ephraim
[1:16:42] saying come down against the midianites
[1:16:45] and take before them the waters
[1:16:47] onto bed burra and jordan in other words
[1:16:50] we chasing them i want you to cut them
[1:16:53] off by the water
[1:16:54] so ephraim who didn't know what going on
[1:16:57] suddenly pick up their weapons
[1:16:59] and they headed down to the jordan river
[1:17:01] running off the mountains
[1:17:03] to cut off the medianites anybody with
[1:17:05] me
[1:17:06] then all the men of ephraim gathered
[1:17:09] themselves together
[1:17:10] and took the waters onto bedbury and
[1:17:12] jordan
[1:17:13] and they took two princes of the
[1:17:15] midianites so
[1:17:17] they chased these men to catch down two
[1:17:19] princes of the medianites
[1:17:21] oreb and zebra
[1:17:25] and they slew aurep upon the rock of orb
[1:17:28] so whoever rocky name they go and find
[1:17:31] the rock and he sees his rock
[1:17:34] and they threw him on the rock that had
[1:17:37] his name
[1:17:38] and zeb they slew at the wine press of
[1:17:40] zebu
[1:17:42] you wine press whoever they want to call
[1:17:44] up they'll sue him there too
[1:17:46] and they pursued million and brought the
[1:17:49] heads of orb and zee to gideon
[1:17:51] on the other side of jordan could he
[1:17:54] take a little more
[1:17:55] we cannot drive in a car stop now kind
[1:17:57] of finished bringing the car home right
[1:17:59] and the man of ephraim now this is where
[1:18:02] i find it interesting
[1:18:03] and the man of ephraim said to him why
[1:18:05] has those served us does in other words
[1:18:07] why i treat her so that dog cut us
[1:18:10] that don't call us us not in other words
[1:18:13] why you went to war and here tell us
[1:18:16] wendell went is to fight with the media
[1:18:18] knights all the time ephraim
[1:18:20] there with everybody else backside all
[1:18:22] did not try doing anything
[1:18:24] now they see what happened they're
[1:18:26] jumping up saying we're really fighting
[1:18:27] now too
[1:18:29] and the man of ephraim said unto him why
[1:18:31] has dogs saved us thus
[1:18:33] that thou cut us us not here call us
[1:18:37] when they went just to fight with the
[1:18:38] minionites and they did chide
[1:18:40] with him sharply that would child which
[1:18:43] means quarrel
[1:18:44] vehemently so they were so angry that
[1:18:47] gideon
[1:18:47] rallied the other tribe and didn't
[1:18:49] invite the tribe of ephraim
[1:18:51] to join this fight because now now
[1:18:53] they're feeling good
[1:18:54] that they have the enemy on the run you
[1:18:56] see you should have called us earlier
[1:18:57] why why the intelligence having a
[1:18:59] revival why didn't tell us it was it was
[1:19:01] it was enemy cleaning time
[1:19:03] we cannot join the fight late you should
[1:19:04] have called us before
[1:19:06] look at the wisdom of gideon and he said
[1:19:09] unto them
[1:19:10] what have i done now in comparison of
[1:19:13] you
[1:19:14] he said it's not the gleaving of the
[1:19:16] graves of ephraim
[1:19:18] better than the vintage of abhieza
[1:19:21] you don't know what he said sweet talk
[1:19:22] the brothers from ephraim he said
[1:19:24] it's not the green and the gleaming it's
[1:19:27] translated as the leftovers
[1:19:28] so in the amplified they say it's not
[1:19:30] the leftovers
[1:19:32] of the grapes of your tribe better than
[1:19:34] the entire harvest of my tribe
[1:19:36] so he said i wouldn't call a big mighty
[1:19:39] tribe like you
[1:19:40] when he's a little is a small child i
[1:19:41] got the power to call this big tribe to
[1:19:43] come
[1:19:44] and help us god and listen listen
[1:19:47] gideon positioning god had delivered
[1:19:50] into your hands
[1:19:51] so gideon no because you remember
[1:19:54] it was ephraim who cut them off and
[1:19:56] grabbed the two princes
[1:19:58] so gideon used a national he said god
[1:20:00] delivered into your hands
[1:20:02] he prince of media and aurora benzema if
[1:20:04] you catch it
[1:20:05] the two of them it wasn't me so don't go
[1:20:08] don't get vectored me when without you
[1:20:09] we couldn't win this thing what was i
[1:20:12] able to do in comparison of you so here
[1:20:15] leaving some wisdom this is not
[1:20:17] this is no i want to pay the pitch you
[1:20:18] know this is no longer the gideon
[1:20:20] of chapter six and i'm chapter seven
[1:20:23] this is now a gideon who
[1:20:24] is now stepping into such a level of
[1:20:26] operation
[1:20:27] that although ephraim upset with his
[1:20:30] administration
[1:20:31] he's able to bring them in line and say
[1:20:32] but look at the situation my tribe is a
[1:20:34] small child you're a big tribe
[1:20:36] i've got the power to call you further
[1:20:37] to that the fact is
[1:20:39] when we was chasing them we couldn't get
[1:20:40] them it was you who catch them
[1:20:42] so and look what the bible said then
[1:20:45] their
[1:20:45] anger was abated toward him when he had
[1:20:47] said that what if he didn't say the
[1:20:49] wrong thing
[1:20:50] but he said the right thing you see how
[1:20:52] god has just been dropping these things
[1:20:54] to kind of just show us
[1:20:55] behavior conduct wisdom order
[1:20:58] and listen and gideon came to jordan and
[1:21:01] passed over he and the 300 men that were
[1:21:04] with him
[1:21:05] and i love this scripture faint yet
[1:21:07] pursuing them i love that
[1:21:09] i love that i love that in the amplified
[1:21:13] so gideon came to the jordan
[1:21:14] and crossed over the river he and the
[1:21:17] 300 men who were with him
[1:21:18] exhausted yet pursuing the enemy and
[1:21:21] that's how i feel tonight
[1:21:22] something you feel exhausted but you're
[1:21:24] not giving up
[1:21:26] faint then brothers tired they're wary
[1:21:29] but they say
[1:21:29] we have to finish this fight faint but
[1:21:32] they're not giving up
[1:21:33] tired but they're not giving up they run
[1:21:35] a long time but they're not giving up
[1:21:37] they know the enemy has been routed we
[1:21:39] have the enemy on the ropes
[1:21:41] we have the enemy running we can't
[1:21:43] afford to stop now
[1:21:44] because we could finish this thing
[1:21:46] tonight we can finish this battle
[1:21:48] now you see the context so i want you to
[1:21:51] see
[1:21:52] the whole character how his character
[1:21:53] has formed this is not a given of six or
[1:21:55] seven now
[1:21:58] so gideon came to jordan and passed over
[1:22:01] he and the 300 men that were with him
[1:22:03] faint yet pursuing them tired but
[1:22:05] they're not giving up
[1:22:06] and he said unto the men of sokkat
[1:22:10] soccer is in the land of god and
[1:22:13] sukkot is similar to this area at that
[1:22:16] time would have been in a hall
[1:22:18] by the savannah have all them food hut
[1:22:20] singh
[1:22:21] where people go and buy food by the
[1:22:23] savannah and
[1:22:24] you have different areas in the country
[1:22:26] ever said the huts of food so this
[1:22:28] sukkat at that time
[1:22:29] would have been like an area with a set
[1:22:30] of huts of food in in
[1:22:32] during under the jerusalem of the tribe
[1:22:34] of god
[1:22:36] he said give i pray you loaves so he's
[1:22:39] telling them give me some bread
[1:22:41] onto the people that follow me the 300
[1:22:43] men are following me for they be faint
[1:22:45] retired
[1:22:45] we hungry we chasing the enemy this
[1:22:48] enemy has been oppressing us for a long
[1:22:49] time
[1:22:50] and i am pursuing after i want you to
[1:22:52] catch this the prince is already there
[1:22:55] remember the princess or rib and zeb
[1:22:57] then fellas done dead but they're going
[1:22:58] after the kings
[1:23:00] he then said i want everybody so you say
[1:23:02] i pray thee
[1:23:03] for they be feeling i am pursuing after
[1:23:05] zebra
[1:23:06] and salmonella kings of millions we want
[1:23:09] the kings we're going after the kings of
[1:23:11] the media knights now
[1:23:12] and the princes of sukkot said at the
[1:23:16] hands of zebra and zamunda now
[1:23:19] in dine hand that we should give bread
[1:23:21] onto dynami
[1:23:22] so the men in sukkot saying you have no
[1:23:25] evidence
[1:23:26] there's no evidence that you could win
[1:23:28] that's what they say to him
[1:23:30] and are they in your hands we have no
[1:23:32] proof
[1:23:33] in other words what if you lose what if
[1:23:35] we give you bread
[1:23:37] and you get licks the kings of media
[1:23:39] will come and kill us
[1:23:40] so go your way no food for you
[1:23:43] and gideon said therefore when the lord
[1:23:47] had delivered zebra and zamunda into my
[1:23:50] hands
[1:23:51] then i will tear your flesh with the
[1:23:53] torns of the wilderness and with briars
[1:23:56] you see that then he went up then so
[1:23:59] gideon is moving he's not stopping i
[1:24:01] want you to catch this
[1:24:02] it was a lesson on finishing the mission
[1:24:04] go take a farmer and put in a mission
[1:24:07] over here he ain't getting food but he
[1:24:08] has stopped him yesterday hello god
[1:24:09] i need food look what they tell me a
[1:24:11] discourage you know we're fighting all
[1:24:12] night you know we chase and all night we
[1:24:13] need to eat
[1:24:14] and and then and the enemy running and a
[1:24:16] car find food
[1:24:17] then fellas say no food for you he's
[1:24:19] still moving on and he went
[1:24:21] up against the pen you will samuel
[1:24:24] you'll find it in genesis that didn't
[1:24:26] seem much pernier
[1:24:27] this was the area where jacob wrestled
[1:24:29] with the angel
[1:24:30] so he's moving now he's moving and it's
[1:24:33] a bear in mind there's no king
[1:24:34] israel is divided but god is having it
[1:24:37] in such a way
[1:24:38] that he is moving through territories of
[1:24:40] the different tribes
[1:24:42] and he went up against the penul and
[1:24:44] spake unto them likewise
[1:24:46] and a man of penul answered him as the
[1:24:48] men of sukkot had answered him so the
[1:24:50] men there too
[1:24:51] so back satan they afraid to give gideon
[1:24:54] food
[1:24:55] because they don't know are believe that
[1:24:58] ginogan win this battle
[1:24:59] i want this to get just now let's go and
[1:25:02] he speak
[1:25:03] also bear in mind i want you to see the
[1:25:05] language of gideon now
[1:25:06] there's no fear there's no hesitation
[1:25:09] there's no
[1:25:10] wandering and he speak unto them he said
[1:25:12] when i come again in peace i would break
[1:25:14] down this tower
[1:25:15] so he just listened tricks he making
[1:25:18] statements he's only war part now
[1:25:20] now zebra and zamunda we're almost done
[1:25:23] zebra and zamuna were in kakoa and they
[1:25:26] host with them about fifteen thousand
[1:25:28] men
[1:25:30] all that were left of all the hosts of
[1:25:32] the children of the east
[1:25:34] for their fell and hundred and twenty
[1:25:36] thousand men that judy saw
[1:25:37] well they see that oliver knew what the
[1:25:40] horse was that was in that in that army
[1:25:43] so in other words it was a hundred
[1:25:46] and thirty-five thousand molecular
[1:25:49] dramats
[1:25:50] it was 135 000 soldiers when gideon's
[1:25:54] three hundred men
[1:25:55] had attacked oh look at that
[1:25:59] a hundred and thirty-five thousand was
[1:26:02] the army that was there
[1:26:04] against three hundred hallelujah
[1:26:08] and god had it that's a hundred and
[1:26:10] twenty thousand of them killed to kill
[1:26:13] one another that itself is a
[1:26:14] mind-boggling thing
[1:26:16] a hundred and twenty thousand fell by
[1:26:19] the sword
[1:26:21] and running from gideon and his men
[1:26:24] fifteen thousand left and gideon went up
[1:26:26] by the way of them
[1:26:28] that dwelt in tens verse eleven on the
[1:26:30] east of noba
[1:26:31] and jorge so gideon now
[1:26:34] sneaking he's not a military he's not
[1:26:37] moving like
[1:26:38] navy seals all right so now we we're at
[1:26:40] verse 11
[1:26:41] and the and smoothie holds for the horse
[1:26:44] was secure
[1:26:46] in the amplified it says when the camp
[1:26:48] was unsuspecting so
[1:26:50] notice this is the first time we see an
[1:26:53] actual
[1:26:53] attack again of gideon he has been
[1:26:56] chasing all along
[1:26:57] but now he got into full-scale war he
[1:26:59] gone into attack mode
[1:27:00] this is very different from his first
[1:27:02] encounter with a much
[1:27:04] bigger army this is now gideon now
[1:27:06] operating in the anointing of mighty
[1:27:08] manavalo
[1:27:10] his first encounter was experience chess
[1:27:14] proof this way just how we do it but now
[1:27:16] he in total attack mode
[1:27:19] and when zebra and zamuna fled
[1:27:23] so it's 15 000 men he attacked when
[1:27:26] zebra and zamunda fled he pursued after
[1:27:28] them
[1:27:28] and took the two kings of media
[1:27:32] zebra and zamuna and the bible said and
[1:27:35] discomforted
[1:27:36] all the hosts in the amplified it said
[1:27:38] terrify the entire army
[1:27:40] how does a man go from hiding in the
[1:27:43] cave
[1:27:44] to terrifying our whole army and gideon
[1:27:47] the son of joash returned from battle
[1:27:50] before the sun was up
[1:27:53] and uh and i love this part it's just
[1:27:55] the way god unfolds it and he caught
[1:27:57] verse 14
[1:27:58] a young man of the men of sukkot do you
[1:28:00] remember when he passed
[1:28:02] and they said no food for you and then
[1:28:04] he passed your pen here and he said no
[1:28:05] are you tell them i will come back
[1:28:06] let me go back to that verse just to
[1:28:08] make sure we see the context
[1:28:10] and gideon said this is eight verse
[1:28:12] seven therefore when the land had
[1:28:14] delivered when the lord had delivered
[1:28:16] zebra and zul dalmun into my hand
[1:28:19] then i will tear your flesh with the
[1:28:20] torn of the wilderness and with briars
[1:28:23] back to verse 14 and quote a young man
[1:28:26] of the men of sukkot and inquired of him
[1:28:29] and he described unto him the princes of
[1:28:32] sukkot
[1:28:33] in the amplified it says it like this
[1:28:37] he captured a young man and questioned
[1:28:39] it and the young man wrote down for him
[1:28:41] the names
[1:28:43] of the leaders of the sukkot and its
[1:28:46] elders
[1:28:46] 77 men
[1:28:50] even three score and 17 men we see in
[1:28:53] the king james right
[1:28:54] and the bible says and he came unto the
[1:28:56] men of sukit
[1:28:57] and said behold zebra and salmonella in
[1:29:00] other words look the kings i went after
[1:29:03] with whom you did upgrade me saying at
[1:29:06] the hands of zebra and zamunda now in
[1:29:08] nine hand
[1:29:09] that we should give bread unto thy men
[1:29:11] that are wary
[1:29:12] listen if you ever was trying to find a
[1:29:15] scripture when men get relics like
[1:29:16] actual licks this is not like kill lick
[1:29:18] this is
[1:29:19] licks like bell clicks and he took the
[1:29:22] elders of the city and he tore under the
[1:29:24] weatherless and bright and with them he
[1:29:26] taught
[1:29:26] the men of sukkot in the in the
[1:29:29] amplified
[1:29:31] he took the allies and and and with them
[1:29:33] he punished the men of sukkot so he
[1:29:35] basically make the men stand up and
[1:29:36] give them licks
[1:29:39] like take a belt and he get on it
[1:29:42] licks for the disrespect when he was
[1:29:45] riding through and he was faint and he
[1:29:47] was tired and he wanted something to eat
[1:29:48] and he beat down verse 17 the tower of
[1:29:50] penuel and saw the man of the city
[1:29:54] then he said unto zebra and zamunda
[1:29:58] what manner of men were they whom he
[1:30:01] slew a tabo
[1:30:02] tabor was a mountain now you remember
[1:30:05] that these israelites were hiding in
[1:30:07] caves
[1:30:08] and hiding in the hills and hiding from
[1:30:10] them so
[1:30:11] gideon at that point was also
[1:30:14] locked up in him was his own pain
[1:30:17] his own tragedy his own story
[1:30:21] his own expertise witness that would
[1:30:24] have led him to be hiding
[1:30:25] doing his his whole threshing he said
[1:30:28] what
[1:30:28] manner of men were they whom you sue
[1:30:31] and they answered as thou art in other
[1:30:34] words he was asking them there was some
[1:30:35] men you killed
[1:30:36] on a certain mountain called tabo how
[1:30:38] did they look
[1:30:41] and they answered as thou art in other
[1:30:42] words they look like you
[1:30:44] so were they each one resembled the
[1:30:47] children of a king
[1:30:48] so there's a lot being said here because
[1:30:50] these kings were watching gideon
[1:30:53] and they were saying they resembled
[1:30:54] children of a king like you
[1:30:56] so they were looking at gideon's
[1:30:57] countenance this man
[1:30:59] who early on say a list of my family
[1:31:02] list
[1:31:03] house lowest tribe they were saying they
[1:31:05] look like a son of a king the way you
[1:31:07] look like the son of a king
[1:31:09] you see that there oh his whole
[1:31:11] countenance is all
[1:31:12] manner these kings these were two kings
[1:31:15] talking to gideon
[1:31:16] recognizing they see in kingship they
[1:31:19] seen an anointing upon gideon and seeing
[1:31:21] the men who we kill they actually look
[1:31:23] like you two you know
[1:31:24] you look like royalty but let's go on
[1:31:28] as though i saw were they each more
[1:31:31] resemble the children of the king
[1:31:32] and he said they were my children
[1:31:36] all right so in the amplified they were
[1:31:38] my brothers
[1:31:39] even the sons of my mother so it means
[1:31:41] gideon he was actually
[1:31:42] gideon's own brothers these two kings
[1:31:45] had killed his own brothers
[1:31:48] as the lord lived if he had saved them
[1:31:50] alive
[1:31:51] in other words if you had let my own
[1:31:53] brothers live
[1:31:55] i would not slay you and he said
[1:31:58] unto jesus his firstborn so there's the
[1:32:00] first time we hear gideon had a child
[1:32:03] his first born jitter a little boy was
[1:32:07] actually with him
[1:32:09] as part of that unit that was chasing
[1:32:11] these kings
[1:32:12] and he said unto jesus his firstborn up
[1:32:15] and slay them
[1:32:16] but the youth just like his father
[1:32:19] usually
[1:32:20] drew not his sword for he feared because
[1:32:23] he was yet a youth
[1:32:25] then zebra and zamuna said rise down and
[1:32:27] fall upon us
[1:32:28] for as the man is so is his strength so
[1:32:30] he's saying this little boy calculus
[1:32:32] and the bible said i'm hiding a rose and
[1:32:34] slow zebra and zalmuna
[1:32:36] and took away the ornaments that were on
[1:32:38] their camels
[1:32:39] necks let's try to quickly close off
[1:32:42] here
[1:32:43] then the men of israel said unto gideon
[1:32:45] rule thou over us
[1:32:47] both thou and thy son and thy son's son
[1:32:50] also
[1:32:51] for thou has delivered us from the hand
[1:32:52] of medium
[1:32:54] and gideon said unto them i will not
[1:32:56] rule over you
[1:32:57] neither shall my son rule over you the
[1:32:59] lord shall rule over you
[1:33:01] you see how powerful that was and how
[1:33:03] honestly the context of this
[1:33:05] and gideon said unto them i would
[1:33:08] desire a request of you and he would
[1:33:10] give me every man the earrings of his
[1:33:12] prey for their golden earrings because
[1:33:13] they were ishmaelites
[1:33:15] children of the east and the answer we
[1:33:17] will willingly give them
[1:33:18] and they spread our garment and their
[1:33:20] cast he was collecting all his jewelry
[1:33:22] there every man the earrings of his prey
[1:33:24] and the weight of the golden earring
[1:33:26] that he requested
[1:33:27] was a thousand and seven hundred shekels
[1:33:29] of gold beside
[1:33:30] ornaments and colors and purple
[1:33:32] arraignment that was on the kings of
[1:33:33] median
[1:33:34] and beside the chains they were about
[1:33:36] the cameras next and gideon made an
[1:33:38] effort
[1:33:38] you remember the e4 when david went
[1:33:40] through the e4 when they took his
[1:33:42] his family with a a robe that the priest
[1:33:45] would use
[1:33:47] a role that is a garment that a
[1:33:49] magistrate will use
[1:33:50] a robe a judge will use a robot leader
[1:33:52] will use
[1:33:54] thereof and put it in a city even an
[1:33:56] opera
[1:33:57] and all israel when fiddler are warring
[1:33:59] after it
[1:34:00] so in other words soon they see a next
[1:34:03] thing
[1:34:04] to to admire they went after it soon
[1:34:06] they said next idol
[1:34:07] and that was his cycle in the book of
[1:34:09] judges which thing became a snare on to
[1:34:11] gideon to his house
[1:34:13] thus medion was subdued before the
[1:34:16] children
[1:34:17] of israel so that they lifted up their
[1:34:19] heads no more
[1:34:20] so did the media night this was the end
[1:34:22] of the
[1:34:23] the militarized inscription after this
[1:34:25] there's no significant if any mention of
[1:34:28] the media night after this gideon
[1:34:29] destroyed them completely
[1:34:31] and the country was in quietness 40
[1:34:34] years
[1:34:34] in the days of gideon and jeroboam the
[1:34:38] son of joash went
[1:34:39] and dwelt in his own house may the lord
[1:34:41] had a blessing
[1:34:42] to the reading of his word and he's
[1:34:43] going to close off with one quote
[1:34:46] whereby branham said here god can't use
[1:34:49] anything that's afraid you know
[1:34:51] in the message towards the father it
[1:34:52] will satisfy us you know gideon had to
[1:34:54] send them all back that was scared
[1:34:56] and if you're afraid to testify of your
[1:34:59] healing before it comes
[1:35:00] god can't use you if you're afraid to
[1:35:02] tell the people
[1:35:03] you've received the holy ghost don't
[1:35:05] worry i doubt whether you ever got it or
[1:35:07] not see
[1:35:08] god wants heroes he wants something
[1:35:10] that's brave
[1:35:11] god wants someone that'll stand up and
[1:35:12] talk i'm not scared to tell your boss
[1:35:14] or anyone else jesus christ the son of
[1:35:16] god has saved me
[1:35:18] from a life of sin so i just want to
[1:35:20] kneel down friends
[1:35:21] that god was fighting through that
[1:35:23] period and we'd see what god will do
[1:35:25] with other teachings through
[1:35:26] the judges and stuff like that but god
[1:35:29] was fighting not just to
[1:35:31] take his children out of the oppression
[1:35:33] that when they were in by the media
[1:35:34] nights
[1:35:35] but we saw how he fought to cast down
[1:35:37] bail and to cast
[1:35:39] down ashira and to restore the altar
[1:35:42] and we see and i think it's a powerful
[1:35:44] teaching friends how
[1:35:45] gideon one man in his house could
[1:35:48] influence his house then influence his
[1:35:51] tribe
[1:35:52] then extend to other tribes even the
[1:35:54] tribe of ephraim who in a whole next
[1:35:56] area
[1:35:57] but they get caught up in calling this
[1:35:59] revival
[1:36:00] that started with one man who had an
[1:36:02] experience with god
[1:36:03] that god had to show him that yes you
[1:36:05] have to build an altar unto me
[1:36:07] yes you have to worship me but yes you
[1:36:09] need to cut down everything that you
[1:36:11] should not be doing
[1:36:12] and the prophecy or the command that god
[1:36:16] placed above your life such as
[1:36:17] mighty man or valor or overcomer or or
[1:36:21] bride or predestinated unto adoption
[1:36:24] it may not look as what it should be yet
[1:36:27] but it will happen because that's how
[1:36:28] god operates let us bow our heads to our
[1:36:30] word of prayer
[1:36:32] or heavenly father the teaching tonight
[1:36:35] lord from the book of judges on
[1:36:36] gideon and how you use them so mightily
[1:36:40] lord someone who didn't know who he was
[1:36:42] but rose to the challenge
[1:36:44] and was able to be a mighty testimony
[1:36:46] lord i was able to
[1:36:48] row the enemy even the media knights
[1:36:50] lord in his day and lord how you
[1:36:53] father justified him through scripture
[1:36:55] that he is counted and numbered
[1:36:57] in hebrews 11 lord how lord paul would
[1:37:00] say if time would only tell
[1:37:01] i'll speak of so many others who also
[1:37:03] had a powerful testimony
[1:37:05] so lord may you touch your people
[1:37:07] tonight and may you give them the
[1:37:08] courage
[1:37:09] to live up to this word declaration that
[1:37:12] you have spoken over our lives
[1:37:13] of who we are to be a lord a chosen
[1:37:16] generation
[1:37:17] a royal priesthood a holy nation a
[1:37:20] peculiar people
[1:37:21] lord rich and time past with other
[1:37:23] people but but now we are people
[1:37:25] and we come from different backgrounds
[1:37:26] from different families from different
[1:37:28] walks of life and we find ourselves
[1:37:31] father hiding in caves
[1:37:33] lord to get away from different
[1:37:34] situations as gideon was hiding in a
[1:37:36] cave and
[1:37:37] we try our best to build an altar and to
[1:37:40] do our worship and to put you
[1:37:42] first but give us the strength to
[1:37:43] destroy the hidden works of darkness
[1:37:46] give us the strength to
[1:37:47] shut down the enemy completely and lord
[1:37:49] give us the faith and the courage
[1:37:51] to take your word as real to us lord and
[1:37:54] lord we see how hesitant he didn't want
[1:37:56] to even believe
[1:37:57] lord and to see through scripture lord
[1:38:00] see even when jesus rose from the dead
[1:38:02] oh thomas wanted to to touch to
[1:38:06] experience if this thing was even real
[1:38:08] and he said blessed that day that that
[1:38:09] believe without having to see
[1:38:11] so father may you give our faith to rise
[1:38:14] to rise to the occasion
[1:38:16] lord that this word is real and the same
[1:38:18] way you operated
[1:38:19] for your children through the ages and
[1:38:21] raised people up
[1:38:22] out of their condition to embrace their
[1:38:25] spiritual destiny

[1:38:38] the battle
[1:38:39] and father may we keep the enemy on the
[1:38:41] run lord one of the most powerful
[1:38:43] scriptures
