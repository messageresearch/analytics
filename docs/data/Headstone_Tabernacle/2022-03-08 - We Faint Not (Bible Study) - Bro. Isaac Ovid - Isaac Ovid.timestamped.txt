[13:25] lift him up and as well as anyone
[13:29] under the sound of my voice tonight in
[13:31] this room
[13:32] maybe you have a physical need
[13:34] maybe you have a spiritual need maybe
[13:36] you have a family need maybe you have a
[13:40] financial need
[13:41] i think we all come here tonight because
[13:43] we have some kind
[13:45] of a need and we want to acknowledge the
[13:48] fact that god is more than able to meet
[13:51] us at the point of our need
[13:54] and our needs are nice so shall we pray
[13:56] gracious heavenly father we thank you
[13:58] for
[13:59] your love
[14:01] for your mercy
[14:02] for your grace
[14:04] lord that there's nothing we could have
[14:07] ever done
[14:08] could do tonight or will ever do
[14:11] lord that would qualify us to deserve
[14:14] anything from you
[14:16] lord we could only connect to you and we
[14:20] could only
[14:21] show forth a measure of love to you
[14:23] because you first loved us
[14:26] lord it's so many things we have to go
[14:28] through in life to come to an
[14:30] appreciation of what love really is
[14:32] because you are love
[14:34] and we come tonight because there's a
[14:36] gap between the way we live
[14:38] and the way you want us to live
[14:41] and the more we close that gap is the
[14:43] deeper of an understanding of this great
[14:46] mystery of love as it unfolds to us
[14:49] lord just as it were

[15:12] presence father and recognize who is me

[15:18] mindset and condition knowing that lord
[15:20] we are a needy people we're in need of a

[15:27] need of healings lord physical healings
[15:31] mental healings healings for different
[15:33] situations and
[15:34] lordy acknowledging that we can open the
[15:37] doors of our hearts and our lives and
[15:38] our situations and to allow you to walk
[15:41] freely in so we welcome you tonight

[15:49] lord to break from lord this dimension

[15:55] allow your holy spirit to move farther
[15:57] because if two shall agree touching

[16:29] father by the revelation that you are
[16:31] placed in our hearts father your century
[16:33] a prophet the message would fall into
[16:36] the hands of the predestinated and
[16:37] father we are so grateful tonight
[16:40] lord for the opening of the word this
[16:42] revealed word this fought light as it
[16:45] were that opens our understanding to
[16:47] every scripture that we could go into
[16:48] the wood tonight and
[16:50] lord be encouraged with an insight that
[16:52] theologians still debate about so father
[16:55] may you speak to us tonight and help us
[16:57] along the way take me out of the way in
[16:59] the precious name of jesus christ amen
[17:01] and amen and amen
[17:03] certainly like to greet one on all
[17:05] tonight in the precious name
[17:07] of our lord and savior jesus christ uh
[17:09] we don't take it for granted uh to be
[17:12] able to come together like this
[17:14] and it's it's every time we come
[17:16] together it is a great privilege it is a
[17:19] great honor to be able to come together
[17:21] and fellowship around the word of god
[17:24] looking for us to get stronger and to
[17:27] grow and sometimes it's for reproof
[17:29] sometimes it's for encouragement
[17:30] sometimes it's for teaching sometimes
[17:32] it's for admonition but it's all love
[17:34] and it's god's love expressed to us in
[17:36] different ways so that we could see
[17:38] either true characters in scripture or
[17:41] through words shared in different ways
[17:43] that we could be better christians you
[17:46] know and time is is swiftly moving on
[17:48] and we see the world events and and
[17:50] these things and and and uh as beloved
[17:53] would have preached i believe was last
[17:54] week or so um the issue is not what's
[17:57] happening
[17:58] around us the real issue is what's
[18:00] happening in us i want to say that one
[18:02] more time the issue is not what's
[18:04] happening around us the issue is what's
[18:07] happening
[18:08] um in us you know
[18:10] you know and i i initially had a
[18:12] thought for tonight um you know kind of
[18:15] meditating and then only late this
[18:17] evening you know the lord showed me
[18:19] something and i want to kind of go into
[18:20] that
[18:21] um a bit tonight
[18:24] but i do want to kind of speak sometime
[18:27] soon on this topic of
[18:30] of
[18:30] being alone
[18:32] and
[18:33] dealing with the issue of who you are
[18:35] when no one else is around
[18:37] i think it's something that we need to
[18:39] kind of talk about a little bit you know
[18:41] we talk about jacob being
[18:43] left alone you know away from family and
[18:46] support systems and these things and
[18:48] i've come to a deep realization that
[18:50] real christianity
[18:52] is really when nobody else is there
[18:55] you know when nobody who could hold you
[18:58] accountable because a lot of us we are
[18:59] held to a level of accountability by
[19:02] people around us be it on the workplace
[19:04] sometimes it's the rules on the job
[19:06] holders to an account and if the rule
[19:09] makers on the job are no longer there
[19:11] then you do things any way you want
[19:13] because the the
[19:14] the lawmakers as it who are not there
[19:17] you know so if you are at office late in
[19:20] the evening and nobody is there and you
[19:21] decide to put your foot in the microwave
[19:24] or decide to do some craziness because
[19:26] you know nobody there watching
[19:28] that is who you are a foot in microwave
[19:30] person
[19:31] you know
[19:32] you have to understand what is inside of
[19:35] you
[19:36] that drives you
[19:38] you know and then i had another question
[19:41] tied to that
[19:43] can you live with yourself
[19:46] can you live with you you know brother
[19:48] branham said when he was speaking about
[19:51] you know i'll give you a new heart i'll
[19:53] give you a new spirit and i'll put my
[19:55] spirit in you he made a really powerful
[19:58] statement along the lines of you have to
[20:00] get a new heart and a new spirit because
[20:02] he says you can't even get along with
[20:04] yourself
[20:07] you say you can't even get along with
[20:08] your neighbor
[20:10] how we could even get along with god
[20:12] and he brought this powerful type
[20:15] to be able to relate to god that's why
[20:17] you have to get a new heart
[20:19] a new spirit and he places his spirit
[20:22] inside of you you can't say because i
[20:24] know you say you cannot get along with
[20:26] god you can't get along with your
[20:28] neighbor and he said you kind of get
[20:29] along with yourself
[20:31] and sometimes we don't spend time really
[20:33] thinking about it and and realizing that
[20:36] sometimes you having a war with
[20:38] yourselves you know
[20:40] you kind of agree with your own self
[20:42] this we're not dealing with the yv
[20:43] husband nature and the co-worker the
[20:45] neighbor we may be delivering we're
[20:46] dealing with and you can't even agree
[20:48] with you
[20:50] one day you ask somebody to you the
[20:52] other day you are somebody else to you
[20:54] you know so we'll spend some time on
[20:56] that at some other point but tonight
[20:59] by the grace of god i have a
[21:01] thought i want to share
[21:02] um to encourage you a little bit you
[21:05] know and the title for tonight is we
[21:06] faint not
[21:08] we faint
[21:10] not
[21:13] we feint not
[21:14] and i want to start just by background
[21:16] i'm not going to be too long with you
[21:17] but i want to start in isaiah 40
[21:21] if you will isaiah 40.
[21:26] and the bible says isaiah 40
[21:29] has thou not known
[21:31] it's a question
[21:33] in other words you don't know this has
[21:35] thou not known
[21:37] has thou not heard
[21:40] that the everlasting god the lord
[21:43] the creator of the ends of the earth
[21:46] fainted not
[21:48] so it is impossible
[21:51] for
[21:52] the everlasting god the lord the creator
[21:55] of the ends of the earth it is
[21:56] impossible
[21:59] for him to fiend
[22:01] neither is he wary there is no searching
[22:04] for his understanding
[22:07] and then the scripture goes on in verse
[22:09] 29 he give it power to the fiend
[22:14] and to them that have no might he
[22:16] increase its strength
[22:19] and then the bible goes on even the
[22:21] youth shall faint and be wary
[22:25] the young men shall utterly fall
[22:29] but they that wait upon the lord shall
[22:31] renew their strength they shall mount up
[22:34] with wings as eagles
[22:36] they shall run
[22:37] and not be wary
[22:39] they shall walk
[22:41] and not faint
[22:43] we will notice that in each of these
[22:46] four
[22:46] verses of scripture
[22:49] there's this mentioning of this word
[22:51] fainting
[22:54] see in the first scripture you read
[22:55] isaiah 40 28
[22:57] it speaks of the everlasting god the law
[23:00] the creator of the ends of the earth
[23:01] that it is impossible for him to faint
[23:05] and then the next verse talks about
[23:06] giving power to defense
[23:08] and the word faint
[23:10] is titled losing consciousness so
[23:12] somebody fiends when they lose
[23:14] consciousness
[23:15] or you're about to feel and faint
[23:17] you're losing your sense of awareness
[23:20] you lose your sense of where you're at
[23:21] if you ever
[23:22] experience somebody you feel in somebody
[23:23] ask them they ask you what happened
[23:26] because they lost consciousness and they
[23:28] and they might lose cut just for a
[23:29] minute a few seconds a few minutes
[23:32] but the reality is in that period when
[23:34] you lose consciousness you're not aware
[23:36] of your surroundings
[23:38] you're not aware of your you lose
[23:39] control over your body so somebody who
[23:41] faints it's a it's a very delicate thing
[23:43] because some people faint and they fall
[23:44] in a bad way and they and they hit their
[23:46] head and they hurt themselves in
[23:47] different ways
[23:49] fainting is also a separation or
[23:51] detachment for what's happening present
[23:53] tense
[23:56] you get disconnected
[23:58] you shut yourself off your
[24:00] you separate yourself from the
[24:02] consciousness of being aware of what's
[24:04] happening right now
[24:07] and the next verse you read even the
[24:09] youth challenge
[24:12] and the youth is supposed to be
[24:14] representing strength
[24:16] and representing fitness
[24:18] and representing health so the even the
[24:21] youths the way it is presented is like a
[24:24] shocking discovery that even the youth
[24:26] will faint
[24:28] so it's not just a matter of you being
[24:30] tired and you're wary and he
[24:31] disconnected and you end up seeing well
[24:33] i've given up but even the youth shall
[24:34] have their struggles so i want you to
[24:37] put that faint as in giving up losing
[24:40] consciousness no longer being aware
[24:42] you're feeling so tired that you want to
[24:44] get disconnected
[24:46] and the young men shall utterly fall but
[24:48] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[24:50] their strength they shall mount up the
[24:52] wings as eagles they shall run and not
[24:54] be wary they shall walk and many
[24:56] reinforces and will not fit
[24:59] and i want to use it as a background to
[25:02] us tonight
[25:04] to now use the words of paul in
[25:07] corinthians to speak about we
[25:10] faint not
[25:12] in other words i want to type this
[25:14] fainting as
[25:16] losing consciousness
[25:17] giving up being disconnected having a
[25:21] sense of of your you don't want to deal
[25:23] with the situation at hand so you faint
[25:26] and there are many people that come to
[25:28] church and they're really in a condition
[25:30] where they are fainted you know
[25:32] they're really not participating because
[25:34] you know when when you're faint you're
[25:36] you're just not president
[25:38] your body could be there but if you're
[25:39] feeding your body there but you're not
[25:41] hearing what's going on you're not
[25:42] seeing what's going on you're not aware
[25:43] of what's going on and it's a dangerous
[25:45] state to be because
[25:47] one of the reasons people faint is
[25:48] because they say oxygen not reaching
[25:50] into your to to your brain your your
[25:53] kind of a circulation issue all of these
[25:55] things contribute to you feeling faint
[25:59] maybe you didn't eat properly all these
[26:00] things affect you
[26:02] that leads you to being faint but i want
[26:05] to go to second corinthians 4
[26:08] and
[26:09] for the bulk of our time tonight
[26:11] we'll spend time here tonight
[26:13] we faint not
[26:16] paul is speaking in second second
[26:18] corinthians 4
[26:20] therefore
[26:22] seeing we have received this ministry
[26:25] do you believe tonight we have received
[26:27] a ministry
[26:28] do you believe you're called for
[26:30] ministry do you believe you're called
[26:31] for a purpose
[26:34] therefore seeing we have received this
[26:36] ministry
[26:38] as we have received mercy we faint not
[26:42] so paul is saying because we have
[26:44] received this ministry
[26:46] because we have received mercy we faint
[26:49] not
[26:51] so it means that fainting giving up
[26:53] losing consciousness zoning out not
[26:56] wanting to confront the issues of life
[26:58] as a believer is not an option for us
[27:01] because compared to what isaiah is
[27:03] saying about men will faint and these
[27:05] things paul is now saying we faint not
[27:07] he's now speaking to
[27:09] those
[27:10] who have received this ministry
[27:13] this is not being addressed to every and
[27:15] anybody he is specifically dealing with
[27:18] we who have this ministry and we have
[27:21] received mercy
[27:23] we faint not
[27:26] we are not going to give up
[27:27] we are not going to backslide we are not
[27:30] going to throw in the towel we are not
[27:31] going to separate we are not gonna run
[27:33] and hide from these situations we faint
[27:36] not
[27:37] but this is what we have done
[27:39] we have renounced the hidden things of
[27:41] dishonesty
[27:43] not working in craftiness
[27:47] nor handling the word of god deceitfully
[27:51] but by manifestation of the truth
[27:54] commending ourselves to every man's
[27:57] conscience in the sight of god
[28:01] i want to read these first two verses in
[28:03] the amplified
[28:05] so we can kind of understand what paul
[28:07] is trying to bring out here
[28:10] therefore since we have this ministry
[28:13] just as we receive mercy from god
[28:16] granting us salvation opportunities and
[28:18] blessings we do not get discouraged
[28:21] so i wanted to see that this word fiend
[28:23] that we're reading here in the amplified
[28:25] it now brings some more light to where
[28:28] we're going now
[28:29] we do not get discouraged nor lose our
[28:32] motivation
[28:33] so that is what is meant by we faint not
[28:36] because many times believers
[28:39] get discouraged
[28:41] believers lose their motivation
[28:44] anybody with me tonight
[28:46] you lose easier for fighting
[28:49] it's not that you don't believe it's not
[28:51] that you don't want to make it it's not
[28:53] that you have doubt in your heart but
[28:55] sometimes you just feel a little down
[28:57] you feel a little discouraged you feel a
[28:58] little tired you feel a little bit wary
[29:00] but here's saying
[29:02] we do not get discouraged nor lose our
[29:04] motivation so it forces us to reframe or
[29:07] have a paradigm shift as it were about
[29:10] how we approach things because once we
[29:13] understand this ministry we can't allow
[29:15] ourselves to get demotivated
[29:18] we can't allow situations to get under
[29:20] our skin so much that we don't want to
[29:22] do what we're supposed to do
[29:25] verse 2 but we have renounced
[29:28] the disgraceful things hidden because of
[29:31] sheep
[29:32] not walking in trickery or adulterating
[29:35] the word of god but by stating the truth
[29:38] openly and plainly we commend ourselves
[29:41] to everyone's conscience in the sight of
[29:43] god
[29:44] powerful let's go verse 3.
[29:47] but if our gospel be hid
[29:50] it is head to them that are lost
[29:53] that's a powerful statement
[29:56] i want to read that one more time but if
[29:58] our gospel be hit it is hit to them that
[30:00] are lost
[30:02] in the amplified but even if our gospel
[30:05] is listen to this in some sense hidden
[30:08] behind a veil
[30:10] it is hidden only to those who are
[30:12] perishing
[30:13] i want to unpack this a little bit
[30:19] are you hiding your testimony
[30:22] because paul is declaring
[30:24] that
[30:26] his gospel his message his life his
[30:28] ministry is on display
[30:31] that anybody could see it except those
[30:34] who are not allowed to see it
[30:37] those that are lost are the ones who are
[30:39] blinded from seeing it
[30:42] but those who are allowed to see it
[30:44] should see it
[30:46] anybody with me
[30:48] it reminds me about open preaching when
[30:50] you go into our workplace you throw your
[30:51] hatchet you throw your your your your
[30:54] grenade because you want a testimony you
[30:57] want to to bring yourself to an
[30:58] accountability that you're living for
[31:00] something
[31:02] and one of the challenges we face now is
[31:04] people don't want to live for anything
[31:06] but here it is paul is comfortable to
[31:09] say but if our gospel is hid
[31:11] it is hit to them that are lost
[31:13] in whom the god of this world had
[31:16] blinded the minds of them which believe
[31:19] not
[31:20] in and i want to say just friends and
[31:22] this here should be a place where you
[31:25] begin to thank god for even being here
[31:27] and seeing this because paul is saying
[31:30] the god lowercase g
[31:33] which is satan of this world had blinded
[31:36] the minds of them which believed not in
[31:38] other words they can't even believe if
[31:40] they wanted to because they have been
[31:42] blinded
[31:43] they could never see the truth you could
[31:46] explain it you could preach it you could
[31:48] show them you could but they will never
[31:50] see it because they have been blinded
[31:52] aren't you glad your eyes are open
[31:54] tonight
[31:55] and you glad that i saw from
[31:59] the presence of god has been placed upon
[32:01] me that he could see that it's a
[32:02] separation between this natural world
[32:05] and a supernatural world that you are
[32:07] really a supernatural being
[32:10] that comes from god and going back to
[32:11] god and there's a supernatural god
[32:13] operating through supernatural people
[32:17] many people so caught up in news and
[32:19] science and technology blinded by
[32:21] science blinded by technology blinded by
[32:24] information because knowledge increase
[32:27] and they do even know they're blind
[32:31] can the church say amen
[32:33] so we're still there but if our gospel
[32:35] be hid
[32:36] it is only hated them that are lost
[32:40] and he is defining those that are lost
[32:42] in whom the god of this world g o d
[32:45] lower case g o d god of this world had
[32:48] blinded the minds of them which believe
[32:51] not
[32:53] lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[32:56] christ
[32:57] who is the image of god should shine
[32:59] unto them
[33:01] so what this shows is that the devil is
[33:03] not a
[33:04] inactive or the devil is not a a a a a a
[33:09] participant in this disengagement
[33:12] he is going around blinding people
[33:17] let me make that resonate a bit he is
[33:19] actively blinding people paul said lest
[33:22] the light of the glorious gospel of
[33:25] christ who is the image of god should
[33:27] shine upon them
[33:28] in other words if it had not been for
[33:31] the devil blinding people the glorious
[33:34] light of this gospel would have a
[33:35] greater impact
[33:38] is that is that
[33:41] so sometimes this this understanding
[33:43] helps us to be able to deal on
[33:45] confronted situations including our
[33:47] families
[33:49] because you can actually be praying
[33:51] wrong at times
[33:54] if you don't understand the issue
[33:56] and i draw a parallel to when elisha
[33:59] when when when they say elijah was
[34:01] seeing what is going on in the king of
[34:03] syria do you remember that we went
[34:05] through that and when they came to get
[34:07] him
[34:08] and jahazi
[34:09] the young servant see but look at how
[34:11] much around us
[34:15] and elisha what do you say he said lord
[34:17] open up this boy eyes
[34:20] because he don't see any spiritual
[34:22] things
[34:25] this young boy wasn't in need of healing
[34:27] he wasn't in need of of a missing limb
[34:30] to be restored he was in need of his
[34:32] eyes being opened because he was blinded
[34:38] his eyes being open allowed him to see
[34:40] what he couldn't see previously
[34:43] and the reality of it is this
[34:45] it cannot be words that would unlock
[34:48] the eyes of your children it has to be
[34:50] the power of god
[34:53] that would unlock the eyes of your
[34:54] family to see the truth
[34:57] anybody with me
[35:00] so again reinforcing this so there are
[35:02] two things we're trying to get here your
[35:04] gospel is supposed to be on display
[35:08] because paul is saying if our gospel be
[35:10] hid
[35:12] it is only hate to them that are lost
[35:14] who they can't even see if they wanted
[35:16] to because they have been blinded by
[35:18] satan's lies his deception his
[35:21] technology his careers all of his time
[35:23] consumption social media technology
[35:26] auditing to blind them that they cannot
[35:27] see that there's a resurrected christ
[35:30] and a ministry on display on the earth
[35:32] through a bride called by her anybody
[35:35] with me
[35:38] lest the light of the glorious gospel
[35:40] who is the image of god should shine
[35:42] unto them
[35:43] paul goes on for we preach not ourselves
[35:47] and for those who have been here for
[35:49] some time we know how much but over
[35:51] takes the
[35:52] shotgun to shoot against these man-made
[35:55] kingdoms
[35:56] we're not preaching ourselves
[35:59] but christ jesus
[36:00] the lord
[36:02] i want to reinforce this because this is
[36:04] what holds us as a people this is what
[36:07] holds us as a church it is all about
[36:10] christ
[36:12] anybody with me the reason we are here
[36:14] is not because we want to be part of a
[36:16] church and because no it is because of
[36:18] christ
[36:19] he is the reason for us he loves when we
[36:22] talk about him he loves when we
[36:24] fellowship about him and we have to make
[36:25] sure that he is in his place
[36:29] every prophet every apostle every
[36:32] teacher every evangelist every king
[36:34] every priest whatever the role a title
[36:36] is has to point towards christ
[36:40] we are not here to even lift up the
[36:42] prophet we are here to point to christ
[36:44] but abraham's message was to point to
[36:45] christ
[36:49] people spend a lot of time spending time
[36:51] on the prophet and this minister and
[36:52] that minister here it is paul
[36:55] who but ibraham would have taught was
[36:56] the gold standard by which we measure
[36:59] every office that came after and every
[37:01] messenger that came after said we
[37:03] preached not ourselves
[37:06] but would always say i don't have to be
[37:08] here tomorrow i'd want to be here next
[37:10] year but this gospel is real christ is
[37:12] real for we preach on ourselves but
[37:14] christ jesus the lord and ourselves your
[37:16] servants for jesus sake
[37:20] for god listen who commanded the light
[37:24] to shine out of darkness
[37:26] hallelujah had shine in our hearts
[37:29] we were just talking about the light
[37:31] shining that the devil walking to blind
[37:33] you
[37:34] and friends you have to understand the
[37:36] devil at all of his tricks you know
[37:39] the blinding of your eyes is
[37:42] making your vision so blurry you can't
[37:44] see what's happening in front of you
[37:46] instead of seeing the promise you see in
[37:47] the political realm until i see any
[37:49] promise you're seeing what is happening
[37:51] economically instead of seeing you
[37:52] promise you've seen what's happening in
[37:54] society instead i see any promise and
[37:56] you're you're
[37:56] you're before long you're you're losing
[37:59] focus on what is most important
[38:04] how many people have been in the message
[38:06] for years and you can't see them now why
[38:07] they end up blinded
[38:10] anybody with me but paul is saying for
[38:12] god who commanded the light to shine out
[38:15] of darkness had shine in our hearts
[38:18] so his showing is not even our effort to
[38:20] know
[38:21] but the god who commanded the light let
[38:23] there be light to shine out of darkness
[38:26] had shine in our hearts to give the
[38:28] light
[38:29] of the
[38:30] knowledge of the glory of god in the
[38:33] face of jesus christ isn't that powerful
[38:38] let's go
[38:39] but we have this treasure
[38:42] in earthen vessels
[38:46] that the excellency of the power may be
[38:50] of god and not of us
[38:52] so we are not here boasting of
[38:54] anything but it is the power of god and
[38:57] not of us
[38:59] in that verse seven in the amplified
[39:01] says but we have this precious treasure
[39:04] the good news about salvation in
[39:07] unworthy earthen vessels of human
[39:10] frailty my lord so that the grandeur and
[39:14] surpassing greatness of the power will
[39:17] be shown to be from god his sufficiency
[39:20] and not from ourselves
[39:23] friends do you know there's nothing you
[39:25] could do to deserve this
[39:27] there's nothing you could do to earn
[39:28] this
[39:29] this certain vessel this vessel that
[39:32] that is a pest house that's where the
[39:33] brandon would say this vessel had always
[39:35] wanted to give trouble this vessel that
[39:37] is hard to bring under subjection if it
[39:40] wasn't for the light of this gospel
[39:42] what testimony would we have
[39:44] and paul is acknowledging this
[39:47] paul is saying i'm doing better than
[39:48] anybody if it wasn't for the light of
[39:51] the god that commanded light to cut to
[39:53] the darkness i would be lost also i
[39:55] would be blind also
[39:59] i'm building into something verse 8
[40:03] and and this is where he's building it
[40:04] because
[40:06] he says no we are troubled on every side
[40:10] is there anybody
[40:12] most of you have your cameras off so you
[40:13] could you could acknowledge if you don't
[40:15] act on legend
[40:17] he said we are trouble in every side yet
[40:19] not distressed
[40:22] anybody anybody can identify
[40:25] you need to add the yet not the stress
[40:27] part in them
[40:28] don't leave the sentence that we are
[40:30] troubled in every side you need to add
[40:32] yet not distressed
[40:34] plenty trouble but not distressed
[40:37] he said we are perplexed but not in
[40:39] despair
[40:42] persecuted but not forsaken anybody can
[40:45] testify about this
[40:48] cast down but not destroyed
[40:52] this was such an encouragement to me i
[40:54] don't know about you but this is an
[40:55] encouragement to be
[40:57] trouble on every side
[40:59] we're in a time of trouble
[41:01] it's trouble everywhere
[41:03] trouble with the economy trouble with
[41:04] your life trouble with your family
[41:06] trouble with your neighbor someone
[41:07] really catch over your house
[41:11] a little brother say the devil always
[41:13] attacking the car
[41:14] i told somebody you have a demon
[41:16] assigned the car i say well you are
[41:18] special category trouble on every side
[41:23] but what is it is to stress you out
[41:25] to get you so overwhelmed and and that
[41:28] is why when david said we bring a
[41:30] sacrifice of praise it means something
[41:33] when
[41:34] you don't really have a
[41:36] you don't feel like you have a reason to
[41:38] pray
[41:39] you ever feel like you're so tired so
[41:41] stressed out and then it becomes such a
[41:43] contrary thing to say lord i praise you
[41:45] and i thank you
[41:47] it is the hardest thing to give god
[41:49] thanks and praise when you get bad news
[41:51] you know
[41:54] it is not an easy thing friends when
[41:56] they get bad news depressing news and
[41:58] they say lord i thank you i just
[41:59] praise you anyhow i just glorify your
[42:02] name listen that goes against
[42:05] in the heat of your emotions in the heat
[42:07] of being disappointed or upset
[42:11] and you know that is what making us
[42:12] sacrifice our praise because they're
[42:14] costing you your human response it's
[42:17] costing you having a pity party so
[42:19] before you try the pizza party and order
[42:21] the balloons and the cake for the pizza
[42:23] party shut down the pity party early
[42:25] until the praise god anybody with meat
[42:27] tonight
[42:28] paul
[42:29] is not saying we don't have issues i
[42:32] want us to i want this to resonate paul
[42:34] is not saying we don't have problems or
[42:35] we don't have child and testing that
[42:37] situation he is saying we are and we as
[42:40] a present tense term we are troubled on
[42:43] every side i look to the left is trouble
[42:45] i looked at you right in trouble i look
[42:47] in front is trouble i look behind this
[42:49] trouble i look up his trouble i look
[42:51] dawn is trouble
[42:52] but he has no distress
[42:55] what does it take us to reach that state
[42:57] where in the face of that much trouble
[42:59] we can say i'm not distressed
[43:02] though he slay me yet still i'll trust
[43:04] him
[43:04] oh god give us more believers who can
[43:07] look at trouble and not be distressed
[43:11] and you know just by declaring this your
[43:13] situation begins to change
[43:17] but i want to even go more important
[43:19] than that
[43:20] sometimes it's not even your situation
[43:22] needs to change you know but you change
[43:24] in the situation and all of a sudden
[43:26] things change
[43:28] let me say that one more time
[43:30] many times you're looking for god to
[43:32] change the situation when the real
[43:34] change that is needed is for us to
[43:36] change in this situation
[43:39] and then all of a sudden we see the
[43:41] situation differently
[43:42] to what it really is an opportunity for
[43:45] character development character
[43:47] formation no wonder paul can say we
[43:49] faint not
[43:51] because we we have rare reasons to find
[43:53] you know oh come on now if you want to
[43:56] list how much reasons you have to give
[43:57] up and say well i don't want to do this
[43:58] thing anymore i i know why i still come
[44:01] in the church and it's all these years
[44:03] people can list all kind of reasons but
[44:05] paul saying because we have received
[44:07] this ministry because of that and we
[44:09] understand what this great call is that
[44:11] here without us cannot be made perfect
[44:13] we faint not
[44:16] we acknowledge the fact that we have
[44:18] trouble on every side but we are not
[44:20] distressed
[44:23] we are perplexed perplexed mean confused
[44:26] sometimes i get confused
[44:29] you don't get confused you don't get
[44:30] perplexed you don't wonder what's going
[44:32] on but how and why and thing and that
[44:35] was job and how and why and
[44:38] perplexed
[44:39] but not in despair
[44:42] i want you to begin to speak it walk in
[44:44] it
[44:46] because sometimes somebody is super
[44:48] spiritual and that is an external super
[44:50] spiritual thing yeah
[44:52] he's super spiritual i want to welcome
[44:54] everything is all right and and and on
[44:56] top the mountain and i gave the example
[44:58] last sunday and closing out my brother
[45:00] said are between revivals i like that
[45:02] kind of honesty
[45:05] are between revivals
[45:09] are working on my next revival
[45:11] hallelujah i walk in towards my next
[45:13] revival
[45:15] what trouble is supposed to
[45:16] come and if we accept the fact that
[45:19] trouble is guaranteed to come and what
[45:22] god really is trying to do is change us
[45:23] in the trouble because that is the
[45:25] refining of the gift that is the
[45:27] character formation that's how a diamond
[45:29] is formed under pressure he pulled his
[45:32] form under pressure
[45:33] oh god sends some more pressure anybody
[45:35] with me on that one
[45:38] we're saying lord yes lord yes lord
[45:41] send more pressure
[45:43] because the more pressure is is is is
[45:46] the equality of the pull
[45:49] the more pressure the people expand on
[45:51] it and it takes tremendous pressure to
[45:54] form a diamond
[45:56] you think i like pressure i listen
[45:59] i don't like it you know
[46:00] i don't know anybody
[46:02] who like depression but if you
[46:04] understand the ministry hallelujah
[46:07] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[46:10] and the expectation of what this
[46:12] ministry brings the understanding of
[46:15] what this ministry is supposed to
[46:16] produce
[46:17] and the power that is coming with this
[46:19] ministry that requires a certain kind of
[46:21] character you imagine by the clearance
[46:24] if power comes and you get so
[46:27] in trouble on every side that you end up
[46:30] getting the stress with the power what
[46:31] you will do with distress power
[46:35] power under stress
[46:38] power in despair
[46:42] power that's
[46:43] forsaken
[46:45] power that's destroyed because this is
[46:47] what paul is trying to bring us a
[46:48] consciousness of that there's a higher
[46:51] expectation of our conduct
[46:55] in the face of trouble
[46:57] oh anybody with me tonight this is not
[47:00] the kind of jump and shout kind of
[47:02] teaching but it's to prepare your mind
[47:04] and your heart and your spirit and your
[47:06] approach
[47:07] so because the reality is friends
[47:10] if you're training to become a pilot or
[47:13] a navy seal or solely or something the
[47:15] training ground is not the real thing
[47:17] you know
[47:21] think about it friends you have to train
[47:24] a pile out how to deal with a plane
[47:25] going down and a pilot may go through
[47:27] his entire career with the plane never
[47:29] going down
[47:31] but there's training that the pilot has
[47:33] to go through just in case
[47:36] and the training must be so real
[47:39] that if the real thing happens
[47:42] they wouldn't be so out of it that they
[47:44] wouldn't know what to do i wanted to
[47:45] appreciate the impact of this
[47:48] so it means then to train a fighter
[47:50] pilot or a pilot or something like that
[47:52] you have to take them through such a
[47:54] grueling process of testing
[47:57] and trials because a trial is a test so
[47:59] that when the real situation come if it
[48:01] were to come it would not be unfamiliar
[48:03] to them
[48:05] it's the same reason to be able to go
[48:07] out in space to put you in a chamber
[48:09] here and eat
[48:11] with all the gravity and your float and
[48:12] your float and your float so that when
[48:14] you go up there you won't throw it off
[48:16] in this space and never come back so
[48:18] they take it to a training a
[48:19] pressurization or familiarization of
[48:22] certain things so that when the real
[48:24] thing comes it is not foreign to you
[48:28] are you with me
[48:30] so count it in a joyous way friends
[48:33] when we look at this we are troubled in
[48:35] every side don't give up yet not
[48:37] distressed
[48:41] we are perplexed but not in despair
[48:44] persecuted but not forsaken
[48:48] cast down but not destroyed
[48:54] always bearing about in the body the
[48:57] dying of the lord jesus
[49:00] that the life also of jesus
[49:03] might be made manifest in our body
[49:10] for we which live
[49:12] are always delivered unto death for
[49:15] jesus sake
[49:18] i want to read this
[49:19] entire thing in the amplified
[49:25] so that we can see it using some other
[49:27] words
[49:30] from verse eight again now in the
[49:31] amplified we are pressured in every way
[49:37] friends
[49:39] the only way god could know
[49:42] how you will respond in a given
[49:44] situation with power is a test you
[49:46] on similar situations before you get the
[49:48] power
[49:52] you
[49:53] and i
[49:54] we don't know what's in us unless
[49:57] experiences help bring it out i want to
[49:59] say that one more time
[50:03] you might say to me but i don't ever
[50:05] lose my temper i may not get angry you
[50:08] don't know
[50:10] if certain buttons are pushed in your
[50:12] life how you will respond
[50:16] you might think you do
[50:18] you know how many stories they tell
[50:20] people who say well he's a quiet man you
[50:21] know he was a quiet woman
[50:24] and she was a quiet and then but but
[50:25] something happened when they fell there
[50:27] was a trigger
[50:29] that brought out another side of that
[50:30] person that they that that person would
[50:32] say i didn't even know that i could do
[50:34] it
[50:36] but situations bring out stuff in us
[50:40] the power that god has reserved for this
[50:42] bride
[50:43] is so nuclear in nature
[50:46] it's so powerful in nature
[50:49] that now the scripture can say here
[50:51] but we are pressured in every way
[50:55] that's life pressure that god allows
[50:57] it's not god not in control of them the
[50:59] pressure is allowed
[51:01] we are pressured in every way hedged in
[51:03] but not crushed
[51:04] perplexed
[51:06] listen to the amplified unsure of
[51:08] finding a way out but not driven to
[51:10] despair
[51:11] you know how much times in life you find
[51:13] myself trying to figure something out
[51:15] how i'm gonna approach this how am i
[51:16] gonna do this i haven't been this way
[51:17] before i'm not sure should i do this
[51:20] should i not do this should i talk to
[51:21] somebody
[51:24] hunted down and persecuted but not
[51:27] deserted to stand alone struck down but
[51:30] never destroyed
[51:32] always carrying around in the body the
[51:34] dying of jesus so that the resurrection
[51:36] life of jesus also may be shown in our
[51:38] body let's go verse 11
[51:41] for we which live are always delivered
[51:43] unto death for jesus seek that the life
[51:46] also of jesus might be made manifest in
[51:48] our mortal flesh
[51:50] so then death worked in us but life in
[51:52] you
[51:53] we having the same spirit of faith
[51:56] according as it is written i believe and
[51:58] therefore have i spoken we also believe
[52:01] and therefore speak knowing that he
[52:04] which raise up the lord jesus shall
[52:06] raise up us
[52:08] also by jesus and shall present us with
[52:10] you
[52:13] for all things are for your sakes
[52:16] that's powerful
[52:18] for all these things in the amplified
[52:20] are for your sakes
[52:22] that the abundant grace
[52:25] my true the thanksgiving of many redound
[52:28] to the glory of god
[52:32] which cause he said again we feel not
[52:36] so poor re unfortunately we faint not
[52:39] which is just the title of this short
[52:41] exhortation tonight
[52:43] for which cause in other words with all
[52:45] that i just said
[52:47] for this cause we faint not
[52:50] giving up is not an option backsliding
[52:52] is not an option turning back is not an
[52:54] option losing hope is not an option
[52:57] wondering if you're gonna make it it's
[52:59] not an option
[53:01] for which cause we faith not
[53:03] but though our outward man perish
[53:07] though this flesh give in trouble
[53:10] hallelujah
[53:13] therefore in the ambulance therefore
[53:17] we do not become discouraged spiritless
[53:20] disappointed or afraid
[53:22] all of that is the word to describe
[53:26] for which cause we faint not
[53:29] therefore we do not become discouraged
[53:32] spiritless disappointed or afraid
[53:34] though our outer self
[53:37] is progressively wasting away
[53:41] though our outer man paris yet the
[53:43] inward man is renewed day by day
[53:46] hallelujah day by day there's a renewal
[53:49] in the inner man this in one man that's
[53:52] why we come yet tonight to get renewed
[53:54] to get reminded to get encouraged to
[53:56] feed this man on the inside the inside
[53:58] man with food
[54:00] you're feeding outward man with
[54:02] something today
[54:04] whether they eat healthy or they need
[54:05] healthy or feeding out old man
[54:08] we come tonight to feed the inner man
[54:10] the inward man with real food food
[54:12] that's tied to your destiny your purpose
[54:15] your call your life your predestination
[54:17] can the church say amen
[54:20] and now listen to the context i'm almost
[54:22] done
[54:26] just one other place we're gonna go
[54:27] after this
[54:32] for our light affliction
[54:35] after all of
[54:36] that paul calls it light affliction
[54:42] anybody repeats tonight he said for our
[54:44] light affliction
[54:47] can we look at our hardship and try to
[54:49] go that light affliction
[54:52] you see what this mystery of god is
[54:54] making is making a change of vocabulary
[54:56] and
[54:56] people are saying but look how he
[54:58] catching it and look out you see this
[54:59] light affliction
[55:01] posing for our light affliction which is
[55:04] but for a moment
[55:07] work it for us a far more exceeding
[55:11] and eternal weight of glory
[55:16] in the amplified for our momentary
[55:18] light distress this passing trouble
[55:22] is producing for us an eternal weight of
[55:25] glory of fullness beyond all measure
[55:29] surpassing all comparison
[55:32] or transcendent splendor and endless
[55:35] blessedness verse 18
[55:38] while we look not at the things which
[55:40] are seen
[55:41] but are the things which are not seen
[55:44] for the things which are seen are
[55:45] temporal but the things which are not
[55:48] seen are eternal you believe that this
[55:51] evening
[55:52] may the lord have a blessing to the
[55:54] reading of his word
[55:55] so just to close us out for a bit i want
[55:59] to go to the book of romans
[56:03] you're going to go to romans 12.
[56:09] it's an encouragement to you
[56:14] still on this
[56:15] we feed not we're not giving up we're
[56:17] not letting down we're not backing up
[56:19] we're not getting discouraged we're not
[56:21] losing hope and now this is more of a
[56:24] challenge now to us
[56:26] so not only is it that we
[56:28] will not faint but there's an
[56:30] expectation of our conduct or behavior
[56:32] and more than ever it's about this
[56:35] personal life and a revelation
[56:37] understanding of this personal life so
[56:39] here it is still paul speaking now
[56:43] romans 12 verse 1.
[56:45] just a few more minutes and we're done
[56:48] i beseech you therefore brethren
[56:53] that beseech is the urge it's like the
[56:55] beg
[56:57] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[57:00] mercies of god
[57:01] that he present your bodies are living
[57:04] sacrifice
[57:06] holy
[57:07] acceptable unto god
[57:10] which is your reasonable
[57:12] service
[57:15] in the amplified therefore i urge you
[57:18] brothers and sisters by the mercies of
[57:20] god to present your bodies dedicating
[57:23] all of yourselves set apart as a living
[57:26] sacrifice holy and well pleasing to god
[57:30] which is your rational logical
[57:32] intelligent act of worship that's in the
[57:34] amplifier
[57:36] all of this is tied to not just not
[57:38] giving up but now you're pushing forward
[57:41] i beseech you he's challenging them now
[57:43] to go higher to climb higher to not just
[57:47] deal with issues around your life but
[57:49] there's a higher expectation of us as we
[57:52] near this finish line of your pursuing
[57:54] friends
[57:55] because more and more plugging into what
[57:57] would orbit preach the reality is
[57:59] many times we get caught up with the
[58:01] externals and what's happening around us
[58:03] and we're not looking at ourselves
[58:06] so paul is saying here's what i want you
[58:08] to
[58:09] look at your life
[58:11] look at how you live
[58:12] look at how you talk look at how you
[58:14] walk
[58:15] look at how your your carry yourself
[58:17] how are you presenting your body
[58:20] are you a living sacrifice are you are
[58:22] you is there an aroma coming from your
[58:24] life a fragrance coming from your life
[58:26] that god is pleased with that is holy
[58:29] that is acceptable unto god
[58:32] what is it which is your reasonable
[58:33] service
[58:35] meaning meaning friends is not a
[58:37] difficult impossible to attain goal
[58:40] anybody with me
[58:42] don't feign from this you know
[58:45] don't back down from this standard
[58:47] i'm challenging you tonight
[58:50] encouraging you probing
[58:52] using the words of a port i beseech you
[58:55] i urge you
[58:57] and it goes on and be not conformed to
[58:58] this world
[59:00] but be you transformed by the renewing
[59:03] of your mind
[59:04] that you may prove what is that good and
[59:07] acceptable and perfect will of god
[59:11] listen to that in the amplified
[59:13] and do not be conformed to this world
[59:16] any longer with its superficial values
[59:19] and customs
[59:22] but be transformed and progressively
[59:25] change as you mature spiritually by the
[59:29] renewing of
[59:30] your mind focusing on godly values and
[59:33] ethical attitudes so that you may prove
[59:35] for yourselves
[59:37] what the will of god is that which is
[59:39] good and acceptable and perfect in his
[59:42] plan and purpose for you
[59:44] now
[59:47] i want to unpack a few things here
[59:49] friends
[59:51] and this is the challenge that we face
[59:54] when brother branham was here
[59:57] he said take a shotgun to the tv
[1:00:01] because he saw what was coming on
[1:00:03] television
[1:00:04] as
[1:00:05] a as a distraction
[1:00:07] as a destruction
[1:00:09] as an influence
[1:00:11] on the lives and minds and hearts of the
[1:00:14] people
[1:00:17] years have gone on
[1:00:19] that the tv is not just tv anymore it's
[1:00:21] on your phone it's the it's social media
[1:00:24] it's content it's information and it's
[1:00:26] it's
[1:00:29] and the reality is
[1:00:30] many of us don't even understand how
[1:00:33] social media and technology and
[1:00:35] information and what we consider social
[1:00:38] norms and customs
[1:00:40] how it is actually changing us
[1:00:46] how our appetite for content our
[1:00:48] sensitivity for truth and righteousness
[1:00:50] and holiness has changed because the
[1:00:52] bars have been dropped
[1:00:54] so much by so much content
[1:00:58] i don't know who this is for
[1:01:00] but if you find yourselves living on
[1:01:02] social media more than having an anxiety
[1:01:04] would something is wrong with your life
[1:01:08] you're not going to make it you know
[1:01:13] be not conformed to this will conform
[1:01:15] means take the shape of
[1:01:18] so you're trying to fit in you're trying
[1:01:19] to be a part of you don't want to be an
[1:01:21] oddball you don't want to be an
[1:01:22] exception so so you want to be in
[1:01:24] whatever is the thing that's going on
[1:01:26] now
[1:01:28] and you have to know you whatever it is
[1:01:31] that you're trying to be like are you
[1:01:33] trying to be like guard each other
[1:01:39] it's easy to come at the night and speak
[1:01:41] about the promises and it's easy to come
[1:01:42] tonight but i really want to talk about
[1:01:44] you tonight and me us us as individuals
[1:01:49] because we are the product of our
[1:01:50] decisions every single day
[1:01:54] our decisions and our actions every day
[1:01:56] is equals us
[1:02:01] did you make time to pray today how much
[1:02:03] time did you make to pray are you
[1:02:05] holding yourself to a level of
[1:02:06] accountability
[1:02:08] or are you conforming to the way the
[1:02:10] world operates
[1:02:16] people don't want to hear these things
[1:02:17] you know
[1:02:18] did you read the bible today just i
[1:02:21] talked about yesterday i talked about
[1:02:23] the plan for tomorrow i'm talking about
[1:02:24] today
[1:02:26] did you make time to pray today did you
[1:02:28] make time to read the bible today did
[1:02:30] you make time to
[1:02:31] to meditate on the word today
[1:02:35] what about yesterday what about the day
[1:02:37] before what about the day before that
[1:02:40] and when you analyze your time and i'm
[1:02:42] i'm coming to our point here friends
[1:02:44] when you analyze your time and where
[1:02:46] your time is spent what is the equal
[1:02:49] sign for using your time because time we
[1:02:52] all have
[1:02:53] the same amount of time when a day comes
[1:02:57] and years ago i was doing a study and i
[1:02:59] realized that there are certain people
[1:03:01] who have made a decision to not read the
[1:03:04] newspaper
[1:03:06] to not use social media this is not
[1:03:07] christians
[1:03:09] these are people who are just so
[1:03:10] interested in goals and their life goals
[1:03:12] and achievements and things that they
[1:03:14] say they don't have time for social
[1:03:16] media
[1:03:16] they don't have time to even read the
[1:03:18] news you don't have time to watch
[1:03:20] television
[1:03:21] i see motivational speakers saying
[1:03:24] don't waste time watching tv and movies
[1:03:26] and these things because you can't
[1:03:27] achieve your personal life goals because
[1:03:30] when you do that you help them put money
[1:03:32] on a movie maker's account
[1:03:35] and then use it you know i'm saying they
[1:03:36] don't have this isn't natural listen i
[1:03:38] read spiritual yet
[1:03:42] but the real question becomes because
[1:03:44] for somebody who is being challenged in
[1:03:46] the natural to live their lives a
[1:03:48] certain way
[1:03:50] to achieve certain things has to make
[1:03:52] decisions on how they use their time
[1:03:56] if you don't know certain scriptures but
[1:03:58] you know i posted on other things
[1:04:00] who is responsible for that is it the
[1:04:02] ministry's responsibility
[1:04:04] if you don't spend the appropriate time
[1:04:06] with your children then make sure you
[1:04:07] know sitting who is responsible for that
[1:04:14] how are you using because the resource
[1:04:16] you have
[1:04:17] you talk about spending time with god
[1:04:21] spending time on the things of god
[1:04:24] even spending time on your family
[1:04:26] spending time for your business
[1:04:28] could you really afford to to spend time
[1:04:30] watching movies and and content and
[1:04:32] these things
[1:04:34] what is the real value of that
[1:04:36] and when you bring it to a spiritual
[1:04:38] perspective to temporal things against
[1:04:41] e2 and all things
[1:04:43] and if you were to do a balance sheet or
[1:04:45] profit and loss statement around what
[1:04:48] you do every day are you adding to the
[1:04:50] account that's on the eternal side or
[1:04:52] are you adding into the account of the
[1:04:53] temporary side
[1:04:57] i'm not seeing anything wrong and
[1:04:58] watching and using them
[1:05:00] i'm talking about having the right
[1:05:01] balance
[1:05:04] because you want to make progress where
[1:05:06] it matters the most
[1:05:09] you don't want to be here well i believe
[1:05:11] and yeah yeah but but and the reality is
[1:05:13] anything could move you because you're
[1:05:15] not grounded because you're not spending
[1:05:16] the time to do it comes back to
[1:05:18] discipline
[1:05:20] almost two years ago i did a teaching on
[1:05:22] the discipline of the word
[1:05:25] and the reality is success all success
[1:05:28] natural and spiritual has to do with
[1:05:30] discipline
[1:05:34] i want to say it one more time all
[1:05:36] success has to do with discipline
[1:05:39] go to joshua meditate on your word day
[1:05:41] and night and you should have good
[1:05:43] success the issue is not just meditating
[1:05:45] it's a discipline on doing it
[1:05:47] consistently
[1:05:50] it's two pieces there it is what the
[1:05:51] meditation was on and the process of the
[1:05:55] consistency of do it day and night
[1:05:59] do it consistently you want success do
[1:06:01] it consistently day and night and see
[1:06:04] the result of it
[1:06:06] are we challenging ourselves to be now
[1:06:09] more consistent more diligent
[1:06:13] i don't know who this is for i don't
[1:06:14] know how it is helping you
[1:06:16] but i trust it's an encouragement to you
[1:06:19] about the discipline of living a
[1:06:21] christian life the discipline of prayer
[1:06:24] the discipline of supplication the
[1:06:26] discipline of intercession the
[1:06:28] discipline of being the discipline of
[1:06:30] bridle in your tongue
[1:06:34] and it perplexes me how people in the
[1:06:36] natural can make choices around their
[1:06:38] lives and believers who are called a
[1:06:40] higher calling to this great ministry as
[1:06:42] policy can can be so indisciplined
[1:06:49] i challenge you don't think that this or
[1:06:51] no
[1:06:52] let's go on almost done
[1:06:57] for i say it through the grace given
[1:06:59] unto me with street to every man that is
[1:07:01] among you
[1:07:02] not to think of himself more highly than
[1:07:05] he ought to think
[1:07:07] but to think soberly
[1:07:09] is a sober conversation tonight
[1:07:12] to think soberly
[1:07:14] do you spend time thinking soberly
[1:07:17] because the opposite of thinking soberly
[1:07:18] is thinking unknown influence of
[1:07:20] something
[1:07:21] the opposite of sober is is drunk you're
[1:07:23] under some kind of delusion some kind of
[1:07:25] influence but soberly bring the level of
[1:07:28] rationality
[1:07:30] a level of measure according as god had
[1:07:33] dealt to every man the measure of faith
[1:07:38] listen to this in the amplified for by
[1:07:39] the grace of god given to me i say it to
[1:07:42] every one of you not to think more
[1:07:44] highly of himself and of his importance
[1:07:47] and ability than he ought to think but
[1:07:49] to think so as to have his own judgment
[1:07:53] you'll see what he saw but he is sound
[1:07:54] judgment as god has a portion to each a
[1:07:57] degree of faith and a purpose designed
[1:08:00] for service
[1:08:02] friends you have a purpose
[1:08:06] don't ever walk around think you don't
[1:08:07] have a
[1:08:08] purpose we have to live by purpose live
[1:08:12] with purpose and if you really
[1:08:14] understand your purpose it makes you
[1:08:16] raise a sharp on doing the things that
[1:08:19] matter to your purpose
[1:08:22] and there are levels of it and at a
[1:08:24] foundational level it is to worship god
[1:08:26] it is a very reflection of his power to
[1:08:28] be god's advertisement
[1:08:30] those are some of the general purposes
[1:08:32] that we share so there's a part of this
[1:08:34] ministry of purpose that we share but
[1:08:36] then there are also specific purpose
[1:08:38] that is tied to you as a parent as a
[1:08:40] wife as a husband as a deacon as an
[1:08:42] elder in your job
[1:08:44] you don't know if on the job the purpose
[1:08:46] for you being there is to testify to
[1:08:48] somebody by your life
[1:08:51] but meanwhile you there having fun and
[1:08:53] tick tock
[1:08:55] you they are spending all their time on
[1:08:56] facebook and not in a position to have
[1:08:59] an influence on their life by being a
[1:09:02] display board that god trying to use you
[1:09:04] but you're not in your purpose
[1:09:06] you're coming to church you know but in
[1:09:08] the workplace you're not in your purpose
[1:09:12] anybody with me tonight
[1:09:17] verse 4
[1:09:19] for we
[1:09:20] for as we have many members in one body
[1:09:24] and all members have not the same office
[1:09:28] so we being many are one body in christ
[1:09:31] and everyone remembers one of another
[1:09:35] so paul is saying listen everybody in
[1:09:37] here everybody in this room tonight have
[1:09:39] a purpose
[1:09:40] is one body many members we are
[1:09:42] connected
[1:09:45] each of us have a responsibility this
[1:09:48] body could only move well if every part
[1:09:51] of the body does what it's supposed to
[1:09:53] do
[1:09:55] and you have to understand that you have
[1:09:56] a role to play
[1:09:58] in the context of the church when you
[1:10:00] breastfeed with the believers you can't
[1:10:02] be an island because
[1:10:03] you can be a tour and we leaving the
[1:10:05] tour anybody going we all have to go
[1:10:08] and you can say well i'm a passive i'm a
[1:10:10] passive member what is that that doesn't
[1:10:12] exist
[1:10:15] i'm not really involved i just come and
[1:10:16] worship really where's your purpose
[1:10:20] because everybody ever ministry you know
[1:10:22] even the housewife have a ministry
[1:10:25] it could be intercession it could be
[1:10:27] praying it could be something but you
[1:10:28] have to know what is your contribution
[1:10:30] to the body
[1:10:31] listen the human body every piece of the
[1:10:34] body even if man don't understand and
[1:10:37] the scientists understand god designed
[1:10:39] this body a certain way that parts that
[1:10:41] man now figuring out have things to do
[1:10:43] with things realize everything about
[1:10:44] reason for being there
[1:10:48] because god doesn't happen
[1:10:50] when god designed the human body he
[1:10:52] didn't say well i go parting here and i
[1:10:54] will party i will try something here and
[1:10:56] let me attach this side no it's a
[1:10:58] purpose
[1:11:01] and and paul is bringing a parallel
[1:11:03] between the human body having different
[1:11:06] members of that body and this mystical
[1:11:08] body having a role and a purpose so
[1:11:10] there's nothing like a passive
[1:11:12] participant you have a role to play and
[1:11:14] if you have a role to play you have to
[1:11:16] be able to give an account
[1:11:17] and that is what people avoid giving an
[1:11:19] account for the part of this role of
[1:11:22] this mystical body that you have to play
[1:11:24] for some people their role is small a
[1:11:28] short period of time but it's a long
[1:11:29] period of time but they still have a
[1:11:30] purpose
[1:11:31] friends
[1:11:32] i challenge you don't faint
[1:11:35] don't faint at your purpose
[1:11:37] don't faint at your calling
[1:11:39] don't get demoralized and demotivated
[1:11:41] with your children with the situation
[1:11:43] with your business with your with
[1:11:44] whatever it is keep on track
[1:11:50] almost done
[1:11:53] so we being many are one body in christ
[1:11:56] and everyone remembers one of another
[1:11:58] having their gifts differing
[1:12:01] according to the grace that is given to
[1:12:02] us
[1:12:04] so all of us have different gifts
[1:12:06] to the grace given to us
[1:12:09] whether prophecy let us prophesy
[1:12:11] according to the proportion of faith
[1:12:13] or ministry let us wait on our
[1:12:15] ministering or he that teach it on
[1:12:17] teaching or he that extorted on
[1:12:19] exhortation he that give it let him do
[1:12:21] it with simplicity he'd have to rule it
[1:12:23] with diligence he that showed mercy with
[1:12:26] cheerfulness
[1:12:28] all these are to the body
[1:12:43] let love be without this simulation in
[1:12:45] other words that this is something to me
[1:12:47] he is doing it because he was a greedy
[1:12:48] person so paul is cutting through that
[1:12:50] age and that time to even already
[1:12:53] let love be without the simulation
[1:12:58] abhor that which is evil this is
[1:13:01] christian living don't fail from this
[1:13:04] this is what we don't want to feign from
[1:13:06] i know
[1:13:07] it is easy you know just ourselves from
[1:13:09] the trouble and say okay well i'm not
[1:13:10] discouraged but but let us not feed also
[1:13:12] from this thing
[1:13:14] abhor that which is evil cleave to that
[1:13:16] which is good we're almost done
[1:13:20] be kindly affection one to another with
[1:13:22] brotherly love
[1:13:24] can we
[1:13:25] do a personal checklist and check all
[1:13:28] these things
[1:13:30] are we living these things
[1:13:34] and the reality friends is if we're not
[1:13:36] living these things knowing about russia
[1:13:38] unveiling ukraine
[1:13:40] really not bringing us closer you know
[1:13:42] because this is the checklist
[1:13:46] these are the things that god really
[1:13:47] measuring against
[1:13:49] i'm almost done
[1:13:51] be kindly affecting one to another with
[1:13:53] broadly love in honor preferring one
[1:13:55] another
[1:13:56] not thoughtful in business
[1:13:59] so even the business people here can't
[1:14:01] be stopped suffer in
[1:14:03] business you lay any business do it once
[1:14:05] he do whenever you want
[1:14:08] when you're on top of him because god is
[1:14:10] on top of things
[1:14:11] fervent in spirit you have a zeal you
[1:14:15] have an enthusiasm you're you're fervent
[1:14:18] you see we wish brother antoine happy
[1:14:20] birthday sunday at 86 years old he
[1:14:22] fulfilled his spirit
[1:14:25] serving the lord rejoicing in hope
[1:14:30] i know if you're still going to talk
[1:14:31] about it i think he will tell you all
[1:14:32] the issues because everybody have
[1:14:34] but he makes a choice
[1:14:37] he makes a choice that when he entered
[1:14:39] that house of the lord he ever sit in
[1:14:40] this position
[1:14:43] lord give us that same disposition
[1:14:45] the lord allow me to be at age 86 i want
[1:14:47] to be just so
[1:14:50] anybody with me be almost done
[1:14:53] patient in tribulation
[1:14:56] continuing instant in prayer
[1:14:59] distributing to the necessity of these
[1:15:01] scenes
[1:15:02] given to hospitality
[1:15:05] well i do like to talk to people now
[1:15:07] i like to be by myself yes because
[1:15:10] given to hospitality are you hospitable
[1:15:13] this is not to select people this is a
[1:15:16] corporate responsibility and
[1:15:19] it have people that have no hospitality
[1:15:21] that is not my portion really
[1:15:25] your dispositions must be hospitable
[1:15:29] be almost done bless them which
[1:15:31] persecute you
[1:15:35] it's not saying when i'm people who
[1:15:37] persecuted you but bless them who
[1:15:39] persecute you
[1:15:40] don't fade from this
[1:15:43] we faint not
[1:15:44] [Music]
[1:15:47] bless and curse not
[1:15:49] rejoice with them that do rejoice
[1:15:52] and weep with them that weep in other
[1:15:54] words have a heart for your brethren
[1:15:57] have a heart
[1:15:59] be of the same mind one to one another
[1:16:03] mind not high things but condescend to
[1:16:06] men of low estate
[1:16:09] in other words true of your your fancy
[1:16:11] degree and your fancy perception of
[1:16:13] yourself and all these things
[1:16:16] paul said to be stronger became stronger
[1:16:17] than weaker became weak
[1:16:20] because there's one body
[1:16:23] anybody with me
[1:16:27] being unwise in your own conceits
[1:16:32] rick recompense to no man evil for evil
[1:16:35] well because he domained that that is
[1:16:37] why i go in and that is not christian
[1:16:39] behavior
[1:16:41] if you only know what you do you will
[1:16:42] understand why i'm doing this that is
[1:16:44] not christian behavior
[1:16:47] you can know all the mysteries if you
[1:16:48] can't live this you're missing the mark
[1:16:51] don't let's clean from this go back down
[1:16:53] from this church i'm almost done
[1:16:58] provide things honest in the sight of
[1:17:01] all men
[1:17:02] if it be possible as much as light in
[1:17:05] you live peaceably with all men
[1:17:08] if it is in your power in other words
[1:17:10] you're endeavoring to do all your code
[1:17:12] to maintain the peace
[1:17:14] you're not trying to turn off your war
[1:17:16] you're trying to be a peacemaker blessed
[1:17:18] are the peacemakers
[1:17:23] daily beloved avenge not yourself but
[1:17:25] rather give place unto rat for it is
[1:17:27] written vengeance is mine i will repeat
[1:17:29] say the lord in other words it is not
[1:17:31] your job
[1:17:33] to bring vengeance it has its place and
[1:17:35] it's not your place
[1:17:38] give place
[1:17:40] put it on the lord let him handle it
[1:17:43] therefore in other words with that
[1:17:45] consciousness if the enemy hunger
[1:17:49] feed him
[1:17:52] if he first give him drink
[1:17:55] for in so doing thou shall he calls a
[1:17:57] fire on his head

[1:18:10] i trust that these
[1:18:12] three portions of scripture we read from
[1:18:14] isaiah from
[1:18:16] second corinthians from romans would
[1:18:18] give us an encouragement
[1:18:20] to relook at our lives and not faint
[1:18:23] at the great responsibility that lays
[1:18:25] ahead of us
[1:18:26] i trust in some ways an encouragement to
[1:18:29] you
[1:18:29] that we have more climbing to do we can
[1:18:31] climb higher we can shake past our
[1:18:34] limitations we can pray not only for god
[1:18:37] to change situations that we are in but
[1:18:39] more importantly pray for god to change
[1:18:41] us
